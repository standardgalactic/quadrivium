PREFACE 
Research in starch biosynthesis is likely to have a great impact on agricul- 
ture and industry in coming years. Although the original purpose of research 
into starch synthesis was not industrial application, it is an example of how 
science, while trying to answer fundamental questions, may lead to the 
manipulation of nature for beneficial purposes. 
Although the basic studies of starch synthesis were carried out in England 
during the 1940s, and led to the discovery of phosphorylase and Q-enzyme 
(branching enzyme), the basis of our modern ideas originated in Argentina 
from the work of Luis F. Leloir and Carlos E. Cardini. They founded in 
1947 the Institute for Biochemical Research and during the late 1950s 
established that nucleoside diphosphate glucoses were involved in the bio- 
synthesis of both glycogen and starch. These pioneers, “refugees” from a 
university system decimated by a dictatorial government, achieved great 
scientific advancement under difficult and very modest conditions. They 
were supported by private citizens at a time when the government would 
only employ members of the ruling party. Leloir and Cardini’s group discov- 
ered the starch synthase reaction, first with uridine diphosphate glucose 
(UDPGlc) as a glucose donor (de Fekete et aL, 1960, 1961) and then with 
adenine diphosphate glucose (ADPGlc, Recondo and Leloir, 1961). 
This group isolated ADPGlc from corn grains and discovered the enzyme 
ADPGlc pyrophosphorylase (Espada, 1962). For some recollections of 
those romantic but dangerous times, please see Paladini (1996). 
Our aim in writing this book has been to provide an up-to-date account 
of the biochemistry and molecular biology of starch. The chemistry of the 
starch granule and the biochemistry, molecular biology, plant physiology, 
and genetics of plant starch synthesis are discussed, and the recent findings 
regarding the properties of the starch biosynthetic enzymes and the studies 
describing their localization in the plant cell are emphasized. The implica- 
tions of these studies for the seed, biotechnology, and modified starch 
industries are also discussed. We concentrate mainly on developments pub- 
lished since 1992, discussed against an historical background. For many of

PREFACE 
the more important discoveries, the authors’ names and the dates are 
included so that the reader is introduced to most of the important workers 
in the field. For the subjects treated more succinctly, such as starch structure 
and degradation, reviews and books are cited as further reading. At the 
end of the book we include numerous references to the original literature 
but have not tried to be comprehensive. 
Most starch is used as food, but about one-third of the total production 
is employed in a variety of industrial purposes that take advantage of its 
unique properties. We include a chapter in which the commercial uses of 
starch and its chemical and physical processing are summarily discussed. 
Clearly, how the raw material is used is important for the scientist who 
works in the basic sciences. Much can be gained by increasing the starch 
content in some plants andor by manipulating its quality (e.g., by modifying 
the ratio of amylose to amylopectin). Starch content has already been 
increased in tomato fruit and potato tubers by using recombinant DNA 
and molecular biology techniques, and in the not too distant future it should 
be possible to alter its Composition. 
This book has been written with a broad readership in mind: starch has 
always been an important product, but now the capacity to modify its 
structure and increase the starch content of crops is attracting the attention 
of the seed companies, the chemical industry, and the research agencies. 
Because global warming is likely to affect the starch content in some plant 
species-a 
change that would, in turn, affect photosynthesis-this 
subject 
is of interest to physiologists, ecologists, and environmental agencies. All 
of this new attention has increased the flow of research papers in the field. 
In the next few years many of the basic questions posed here will be 
answered, leading, we hope, to advances in biotechnology and benefits 
for all.

OCCURRENCE OF STARCH 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Starch is a plant reserve polysaccharide, an end product of carbon fixation 
by photosynthesis, in which D-glucose residues are linked predominantly 
by a-(1,4) glucosidic bonds. It is present in most green plants and in practi- 
cally every type of tissue: leaves, fruit, pollen grains, roots, shoots, and 
stems. Starch has a negligible osmotic pressure and thus allows plants to 
store large reserves of D-glucose without disturbing the water relations in 
the cell. All fruits contain starch, but in many of them only traces can be 
detected, and in most of them the starch is restricted to the chlorophyllous 
layers. Bananas and plantains have a relatively high starch content, espe- 
cially before the onset of the climacteric, when nearly 90% of the dry weight 
of the fruit is starch. Starch present in pollen grains provides the energy 
required during germination and tube growth. 
II. SEEDS 
Members of the Gramineae (grasses) produce dry, one-seeded fruits, 
called caryopsis, commonly referred to as kernels or grains. The caryopsis 
(Fig. 1) consists of a fruit coat or pericarp, which surrounds the seed and 
adheres tightly to the seed coat. The seed consists of an embryo (or germ) 
and an endosperm enclosed by a nucellar epidermis and a seed coat. The 
main site of starch synthesis and accumulation is the endosperm, whose 
cels are packed with starch granules that form within the amyloplasts. 
Some starch is deposited in the embryo and pericarp early in development 
but later disappears. The starchy endosperm provides carbon skeletons and 
energy to the germinating embryo. Starch normally accounts for 65%-75% 
of the dry weight of the caryopsis in the mature, dry state. The embryo 
and the pericarp contain little starch, and values for the endosperm alone 
exceed 80%. The contents and cell walls of the endosperm make up the 
flour after the drying and processing of the grains. The baking properties 
of the flour are determined not only by the starch but also by the cell 
proteins that constitute the gluten.

OCCURRENCE OF STARCH

The seeds of legumes have a lower percentage of starch than grass seeds: 
around 30% of dry weight for garden peas and 50% for cow peas. The study 
of the variations in seed morphology in maize and in peas, starting with 
Mendel, resulted in major contributions to the understanding of plant genet- 
ics. Some of these variations are caused by mutations affecting enzymes 
involved in the synthesis of starch and are discussed in the chapters corre- 
sponding to each enzyme. 
Ill. 
STORAGE ROOTS AND TUBERS 
Starch content in potato (Solanurn tuberosurn) tuber, in cocoyam corm 
(Xanthosoma sugittifolium and Colocusia esculentu), and in the roots of 
yam (Dioscorea esculentu), cassava (Munihor esculentu), and sweet potato 
(Zpomea batatus) ranges between 65 and 90% of the total dry matter, a 
result of a period of starch deposition that varies between 8 and 30 weeks. 
The dividing cells in newly initiated potato tubers, which are derived from 
stolons, contain little starch; however, once tuberization progresses, starch 
accumulation also progresses. Early in the development of the potato tu- 
bers, starch is distributed rather uniformly throughout the parenchyma. 
Later, two gradients of starch deposition appear and, as a result, the cortical 
parenchyma is richer in starch than the central part of the tuber, and the 
more mature, basal end of the tuber contains more starch than the younger 
distal tissues. Yams and cassava also display specific patterns of starch 
accumulation that are related to the particular pattern of differentiation 
of the organ. 
IV. STARCH IN THE GRAVITATIONAL RESPONSE OF ROOTS 
AND STEMS 
Sedimentation of amyloplasts within the cell has been correlated with the 
capacity of the plant to perceive gravity. The buoyant mass of amyloplasts 
present in specialized cells in the center of the root cap and in the stem (de- 
pending on the plant species, in the endodermis, the bundle sheath, or in the 
parenchyma to the inside of the vascular bundle) would allow the amyloplasts 
to sediment inside the cell, where the cytosol would have a relatively low 
viscosity. This sedimentation would translate into a signal of an unknown 
nature, maybe through pressure onto a sensitive part of the cell or acting as 
a mechano transducer, etc. Whatever the nature of the signal, it eventually 
results in the asymmetry of the organ and its curvature. The isolation of 
starchless mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotianu sylvestris has made 

4 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
it possible to compare the gravitational responses of plants differing only in 
the amount of starch, as plastids are present in both wild-type and starchless 
mutants. Although it was initially believed that the responses were identical 
(Caspar and Pickard, 1989), apparently the starchless mutants in both species 
are less sensitive to gravity (Sack and Kiss, 1989). 
V. LEAVES 
In leaves, starch is deposited in granules in the chloroplasts during active 
carbon dioxide fixation by photosynthesis throughout the day and is de- 
graded by respiration at night. Starch remobilization ensures the constant 
availability of photosynthates to the whole plant. Mutants of A. thaliana 
that are able to synthesize sucrose but unable to synthesize starch grow at 
the same rate as the wild type in a continuous light regime, but growth 
rate is drastically reduced if they are grown in a day-night regime (Caspar 
et a/., 1986). The biosynthesis and degradation of starch in the leaf are, 
therefore, more dynamic than the metabolism in reserve tissues. Chloroplast 
starch granules are smaller than those in reserve tissues and their shapes 
are not species specific and are likely to be determined simply by the space 
available at the site where they are formed. 
VI. GREEN ALGAE 
The presence of starch has been demonstrated in several species of green 
algae (Chlorophyceae). Starch content in four genera of green algae studied 
by Love rt al. (1963) contained about 1% starch. The viscosity of algal 
starch solutions was lower than that of potato starch, indicating a lower 
degree of polymerization, but the percentage of amylose was not very 
different. Extraction of algal starch is complicated by the presence of a 
large amount of other polysaccharides, especially sulfated ones. 
Algae lack differentiated organs and one would expect the role of starch 
and its structure to resemble those of leaf starch rather than those of reserve 
tissues. In this decade, a green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has 
become a system of choice for the study of starch synthesis. Ball and his 
collaborators (1990) studied this algae under sets of conditions that favor 
accumulation of “storage” starch (N depletion, dark, carbon, and energy 
supplied as acetate) or “photosynthetic” starch (light, complete nutrient 
solution). The structure and site of accumulation within the cells vary 
according to the growth conditions. 

OCCURRENCE OF STARCH

VII. OTHER RESERVE POLYSACCHARIDES 
Starch is not the only storage polysaccharide found in plants. A storage 
substance is one that can be broken down rapidly to provide energy and/ 
or building blocks for new growth by respiration. Reserve polysaccharides 
are stored in plastids (as in the case of starch), in the cell vacuole, or outside 
the plasmalemma, in the cell-wall region. The presence in the plant of 
enzymes capable of degrading the substance is a good indicator of its role 
as reserve. This definition can be applied with ease to starch in higher 
plants or to glycogen in cyanobacteria, but for other polysaccharides found 
in some algae, the role is less clear (Percival and McDowell, 1985). For 
example, xylans-polymers of xylose present in Rhodophyta, the red algae, 
and in Chlorophyta, the green algae-may fulfill more than a single function 
in the same algae (i.e., as reserve and as part of the cell-wall structure). 
Cell-wall polysaccharides in some senescent tissues, such as ripening fruits, 
can be turned over and the monosaccharides produced can be incorporated 
into polysaccharides. An arabinogalactan mucilage present within the style 
canal of Lilium acts as a source of carbohydrate precursor for the growing 
pollen cell wall (Loewus and Labarca, 1973). 
Laminarin, a linear glucan containing mainly &D-( 1-3) linked glucose, 
with some p-~-(1+6) branching points, is found in Laminaria, a brown 
seaweed. 
Mannans, in which mannose units are linked predominantly in p-~-(1+4) 
bonds, are found in the red seaweed Porphyra umbilicalis, in the seed of 
the tagua palm (Phytelephas macrocurpa) in the form of massive thickening 
of the cell walls of the endosperm, and in the endosperm of members of 
the Umbelliferae and of the Compositae (e.g., lettuce seed). 
Other reserve glucans have been described (Meier and Reid, 1982), but 
in higher plants only starch and fructan, a water-soluble polymer of D- 
fructose that is osmotically active, are widespread. Hendry (1987) estimated 
that fructans are present in about 12% of vascular plants, many of them 
from temperate climates. It has been proposed that fructans, which are 
located in the cell vacuole and are osmotically active, can decrease the 
freezing point of the cell sap, slow the rate of freeze-dehydration, and 
afford frost hardiness to the plants that store them. Long-term storage of 
fructan can occur in specialized organs (e.g., the tubers of the Jerusalem 
artichoke) (Jefford and Edelman, 1961), in the stems and developing inflo- 
rescences of temperate grasses and cereals during periods of reproductive 
development (Archbold, 1940), and in the seeds of some Gramineae dur- 
ing the early stages of grain development, before starch synthesis begins. 
Pollock and Chatterton (1988) discussed the possible advantages afforded 
to plants by fructan accumulation in leaves as compared to starch. 

6 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
Floridean starch containing a-~(1-+4), a-~-(1-+6), 
and possibly some a- 
D-( 1-3) bonds is the characteristic reserve polysaccharide in the Rhodo- 
phyceae (red algae) and is present as granules in the cytosol. The presence 
of a-~-( 
1+3) bonds, if confirmed, would clearly differentiate floridean 
starch from both starch and glycogen, but they could be an artifact. Flori- 
dean starch has been detected in many species of red algae (Meeuse et at., 
1960) but has been characterized in only a few cases. In its viscosity and 
molecular weight (MW) of approximately lo8, it resembles amylopectin 
(Greenwood and Thomson, 1961), but in other respects, (e.g., average chain 
length) it resembles glycogen (although chain lengths can vary from about 
10 to 18). 
Glycogen. an a-1 
,4-glucan with a-l,6 branching points, is the storage 
polysaccharide for cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). Cyanobacteria are 
prokaryotes and, although they are photosynthetic, they have no plastids 
and their glycogen is present as small granules in the cytosol. In thin sections 
seen under the electron microscope, they appear as spheres of 25 to 
30-nm-diameter or rods (31 by 65 nm in Nostoc) that stain densely with 
lead citrate and are often located between the thylakoids and are more 
prominent in nitrogen-limited photosynthesizing cells (Shively, 1988). 
Vlll. EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS IN THE STUDY 
OF STARCH METABOLISM 
The model experimental systems mentioned more frequently in this book 
are the kernels of maize and rice, the potato tuber, the pea seed, the aerial 
parts (leaves and stem) of Arabidopsis thaliunu, and the alga Chlomydomo- 
nas reinhardfii. Some of these systems (e.g., rice, potato) have been chosen 
by researchers for their economic importance, whereas other plants have 
been chosen because many mutant lines are available for study (e.g., pea) 
or because they are particularly amenable to genetic studies (Arubidopsk). 
It should not be expected, however, that these few species represent “per- 
fect” models (if such a thing exists) of how starch synthesis operates in 
plants in general, and one should be cautious when extrapolating to other 
species the information obtained using one system. For example, potato 
and maize have been selected for centuries in the search of high starch 
production, and we could expect that breeding has introduced some peculiar 
characteristics leading to high starch accumulation that may not be typical 
of what the species was before domestication. However, Arubidopsk is a 
good system in the sense that it has not been subject to selective pressure, 
but the plant is very small, making biochemical studies dif6cult and limited 
mostly to the leaves.

It is worth noting that bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), one of the most 
important world crops, is far from an ideal experimental system. Wheat is 
a natural allopolyploid. It has 21 pairs of chromosomes, which represent 
three sets of chromosomes that come from three different wild relatives, 
possibly T. monococcum, T. searsii, and T. tauschii. The bread wheat as 
we know it is the result of a combination of naturally arising mutations, 
such as the gene Ph that allows the coexistence of the three related sets 
of chromosomes, and cultivation by humans for more than 10,000 years. 
Breeding has resulted in a very high harvest index; that is, a gradual increase 
in the proportion of above-ground assimilates going to the grains, the 
harvested sink organs. The molecular bases for this ever-increasing harvest 
index are probably related to increased starch synthesis selected by breed- 
ing. However, the hexaploidy of wheat makes genetic manipulation compli- 
cated, and biochemical study of the kernel enzymes is also difficult. 
A. MAIZE 
Maize (Zea mays) is a cross-pollinated plant that has evolved (with great 
help from humans) into thousands of varieties or races that are composed 
of a great deal of genetic variability; the wild relatives of maize are teosinte 
(Zea mexicana) and Tripsacum. The maize cultivated in commercial agricul- 
ture represents a very small fraction of this genetic variability and consist 
of a few hybrids obtained by the systematic crossing of a few inbred lines. 
Besides its commercial importance, another reason why maize is frequently 
used as a model system is that it bears male and female flowers on separate 
structures (Fig. 2). This characteristic facilitates controlled pollinations and 
genetic studies, and also the outcrossing responsible in part for the enor- 
mous genetic variability of the species. Maize produces a large ear with 
500 or more individual kernels (the main site of starch deposition), each 
containing a prominent endosperm and a large embryo, facilitating bio- 
chemical studies. There is also a large amount of data available on the 
physiology of the whole plant and its ultrastructure, and maize is the most 
extensively characterized flowering plant from a genetic and cytogenetic 
point of view. 
The development of the kernel following fertilization takes 40-50 days 
and is accompanied by a 1400-fold increase in the volume of the embryo 
sac; the growth of the embryo and accumulation of food reserves in the 
endosperm is completed by about day 40. A mature kernel has three parts: 
pericarp, endosperm, and embryo (Fig. 1). The pericarp, the tough, trans- 
parent, outer layer of the kernel, is derived from the ovary wall and is, 
therefore, genetically identical to the maternal parent; the endosperm and 
embryo represent the next generation.

Besides the usual forms of genetic change present in other p h t s  (Le., 
gene mutation and recombination), transposable genetic elements, also 
called jumping genes, are an additional source of genetic variation in maize. 
These are genetic elements that can occasionally move (transjxme) from one 
position in the chromosome to another position in the same cbromome or 
in a different chromosome. Transposable elements can mediate chromo- 
somal rearrangements, and were 6rst discovered in maize by M. Rhoades, 

OCCURRENCE OF STARCH

where they manifested themselves as unstable mutant alleles, i.e. alleles 
for which reverse mutation occurs at a very high rate. In the 195Os, Barbara 
McClintock found a genetic factor Ds (Dissociation) that causes a high 
tendency towards chromosome breakage at the location in which it appears. 
Controlling elements in maize can inactivate the gene in which they reside, 
cause chromosome breaks, and transpose to other locations within the 
genome. Complete elements can perform these functions unaided; other 
forms with partial deletions can only transpose with the aid of a complete 
element located elsewhere in the genome. 
One locus related to starch synthesis, waxy, has been the object of 
intense study on the effects of the Ds element. The Ds element can move 
into a gene making it into an unstable mutant dependent on the other 
element, Ac. The wx locus is one example and was studied in detail by 
Oliver Nelson, who paired many different unstable wx alleles in the absence 
of the Ac mutation. He then screened the heterozygotes for the rare wild- 
type recombinants by staining the pollen with iodine reagent (Wx pollen, 
containing normal starch, stains black; wx pollen, lacking amylose, stains 
red) and, by counting the frequency of the wild-type recombinants, he 
obtained a fine structure map of the waxy gene. Nelson also showed that 
the different mutable waxy mutant alleles were caused by the insertion of 
the Ds element in different positions within the waxy gene. 
Maize is a particularly favorable material for the investigation of the 
biochemical effects of genetic lesions because of the large size of its seeds 
and because of the translucent pericarp, which allows detection of any 
deviation from normal development. The substantial background of genetic 
information is also very helpful. Some of the mutants available for study 
are amylose extender, dull, sugary 2, and wary, all of which affect the 
ratio of amylopectin to amylose. The shrunken-1, shrunken-2, and brittle- 
2 mutations reduce starch content of the endosperm. The sugary-l mutant 
is unique in that the principal storage polysaccharide is not starch but the 
highly branched and water soluble phytoglycogen. Besides the mutants that 
have been biochemically characterized, 0. Nelson (1985) mentions many 
more mutants (not allelic to those mentioned previously) that even now 
are awaiting identification. 
B. POTATO 
The potato plant (Solanum tuberosum) is bushy, sprawling, and dark 
green, with compund leaves that resemble those of a close species, the 
tomato. The leaves are arranged in a spiral around the stem, and the flowers 
are arranged in clusters. They are about 1-inch wide and 5-petaled, and 
range in color from white to pale blue to purple. The plant is completely

family. which includes potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplants. contain the poi- 
sonous alkaloid called solanine. a natural defense against its many pred- 
ators. 
The life cycle of the potato plants cultivated today is completely asexual 
(i.e.. tuber to sprout to plant to tuber). When rapid leaf growth slows down, 
the plant begins to form Rowers, and underground stems (stolons) begin 
to branch out and swell at their tips. Sucrose 1s sent from the mature leaves,

facilitating genetic analysis. The small size of the plants facilitates its cultiva-

mutants after chemical mutagenesis. Another advantage is that it is rela- 
tively easy to transform some lines of Arnhidupsis thaliana using the Agro-

about 10’ bp of DNA. and most of this genetic material is single copy

D. ANTIRRHYNUM MAJUS 
.4ntirrhyntrm rnajus is a common cultured garden plant, the snapdragon. 
The normal typus or wild type of A. ntujiis is defined to be the Sippe 50 strain. 
Gene inactivations and reactivations caused by the insertion and excision 
of transposable elements of the kind first discovered in maize. also appear 
in Anfirrhynztm, facilitating the identification and molecular analysis of 
genes involved in flower development and organ identity. Although in 
Aritirrhynirm the best studied genes are those involved in the synthesis of 
pigments and in flowering. it is now being used in the investigation of the 
mechanism of starch biosynthesis by Romero and colieagues. 
Gene disruption is an experimental tool used for “reverse genetics,” in 
which a gene is specifically inactivated, as pioneered in yeast, so that the 
precise function of the gene may be determined. A “cryptic” DNA or 
protein sequence is used to discover the normal role of the gene at the 

OCCURRENCE OF STARCH 
11 
phenotypic level. Another gene with a selectable function can be inserted 
into the middle of a wild-type allele of the gene of interest carried on a 
plasmid. A linear derivative of such a construct would insert itself specifi- 
cally at the wild-type locus, automatically disrupting it and at the same 
time allowing the selection of the recombinant via the selectable gene. In 
the case of starch biosynthesis, study is still limited to the specific effects 
of the relevant genes for which mutants have been obtained, but the use 
of gene disruption in plants such as Antirrhynurn would greatly expand the 
options available to the biochemist in search of the role of enzymes of starch 
metabolism and multiforms in the final architecture of the starch granule. 
E. CHLAMYDOMONAS REINHARDTII 
Although cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae) are often used 
as a model system for plants because they are photosynthetic, they are 
prokaryotic and more similar to bacteria than to plants in many ways. 
Cyanobacteria, for example, accumulate glycogen rather than starch and 
have no organelles. Conversely, Chlumydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular 
organism used since 1990 in the study of starch synthesis is a green algae, 
is a better system to study the effect of mutations in the relevant enzymes 
on starch structure. Chfumydomonus is a large genus of green flagellates; 
rnore than 600 species have been described worldwide from marine and 
freshwaters, soil, and even snow. Until the 1970s, Chlamydomonas was 
considered by many to be the most ancient of the green plants, but according 
to the current opinion they are considered nonancestral members of the 
chlorophyte lineage (Chlorophyceae) of green algae. Several species of 
Chturnydornonus have become important experimental organisms in fields 
such as cell and molecular biology, genetics, plant physiology, and biotech- 
nology. 
Swimming cells have a single nucleus and two flagella inserted into a 
minute papilla at the anterior end of the cell: the cell wall is thin. Most of 
the cell volume is occupied by one or more grass-green chloroplasts. In the 
most frequently used species. C. reinhardtii, only one cup-shaped chloro- 
plast is present; one or more pyrenoids are present within the chloroplast: 
starch grains surround the pyrenoid. 
Vegetative cells are usually haploid, and reproduce asexually by division 
into two, or some small multiple of two, progeny cells. Under certain 
conditions, usually involving induction of vegetative cell growth under nitro- 
gen limitation, vegetative cells divide to form gametes. Gametes look like 
vegetative cells, but have differentiated mating structures near their apices. 
Cysts are usually diploid, formed by fusion of gametes. Meiosis in the cysts 

12

usually yields four vegetative cells. The life cycle of Chhmydomonus is 
easy to manipulate under controlled culture conditions.

PHYSICOCHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF THE 
STARCH GRANULE 
I. THE STARCH GRANULE 
Starch and glycogen (the storage material in animals and bacteria) are 
both polymers of a-D-glucose, but starch differs from glycogen in that starch 
consists of a highly ordered and dense packing of glucan chains organized 
within large, insoluble granules. The starch granules are formed in the 
amyloplast (see the chapter, “The Site of Starch Synthesis in Nonphotosyn- 
thetic Plant Tissues; The Amyloplast”), specialized in the synthesis and 
long-term storage of starch, or in the chloroplast (see the chapter, “Starch 
Accumulation in Photosynthesis Cells”), where starch serves as a temporary 
store of energy and carbon. 
Starch granules vary in size, shape, composition, and properties (Table 
I), and they are a semicrystalline material. Because the starch granule has 
a high degree of order, when viewed in polarized light it shows birefringence, 
the maltese cross of Fig. 1. 
The shape and size of the granules depend on the source. For example, 
pollen starch granules are about 2 pm in diameter and those from canna 
starch have diameters of up to 175 pm. Although the microscopic appearance 
of starch granules (Fig. 2) is sufficiently characteristic to allow the identifica- 
tion of the botanical source of the polysaccharide, in each tissue there is a 
range of sizes and shapes. For example, in barley starch there are two popula- 
tions of granules: one is composed of large lenticular granules with diameters 
between 15 and 35 pm, and another of small spherical granules with diameters 
between 1 and 10 pm. In general, the diameter of the starch granule changes 
during the development of the reserve tissue. In addition to size and shape, 
there are also some fine features that are characteristic of each species (e.g., 
the “growth rings” seen in potato starch), which help to identify the botanical 
source of the starch upon microscopic examination. 
II. AMYLOSE AND AMYLOPECTIN 
At least two polymers can be distinguished within the starch granule: 
amylose, which is essentially linear; and amylopectin, which is highly

branched (Fig. 3, Table 11). Amylose is found mainly as linear chains of 
about 1500 units of a-D-glucopyranosyl residues linked by a!-( 1+4) bonds 
(molecular weight around 250,000; the molecular weight of an anhydroglu- 
cose residue is 162), but the number of anhydroglucose units varies widely 
with plant species and stage of development. Some molecules found in the 
amylose fraction are branched to a small extent (1 -+6 a-D-glucopyranose; 
1 per lo00 or 1500 glucose residues). In contrast, amylopectin, which usually 
constitutes about 70% of the starch granule, is more highly branched, with 
about 4 to 5% of the glucosidic linkages being a-1-4 (Fig. 3). Methylation 
followed by acid hydrolysis shows that there is one nonreducing end group 
for every 20 to 25 D-glucose residues; this has been confirmed by the 
periodate oxidation method. These results are only compatible with a highly 
branched molecule and explain why amylopectin does not form threads or 
films in the same way as amylose. From the hydrolysis products, about 3% 
are 2,3-di-O-methyl-~-glucose, 
indicating that some glucose residues are 
joined to others through C(6) as well as through C(,) and C(4), and these 
units constitute the branch points. This is confirmed by the isolation of 
isomaltose and panose (cY-D-G,~ 
-6a-~-G,1-4-~-G,) 
after partial hydrolysis 
of amylopectin. Thus, the average chain length of amylose is about 1500

glucose residues and, for amylopectin, the average chain length is about 
20 to 25 units. A typical molecular weight for amylopectin is around lo8, 
with about 600,000 glucose residues. 
It should be noted that the different structures of amylose and amylopec- 
tin confer distinctive properties to these polysaccharides (Table 11). The 
linear nature of amylose is responsible for its ability to form complexes 
with fatty acids, low-molecular-weight alcohols, and iodine; these complexes 
are called clathrates or helical inclusion compounds. This property is the 
basis for the separation of amylose from amylopectin: when starch is solubi- 
lized with alkali or with dimethylsulfoxide, amylose can be precipitated by 
adding 1-butanol and amylopectin remains in solution. 
When an aqueous starch solution is left to stand for some time, partial 
precipitation occurs. This is known as retrogradation and is due to the 
separation of the amylose fraction. The linear molecules align themselves 
parallel to each other and become held together by hydrogen bonds. The 
aggregates increase in size until they exceed colloidal dimensions and there- 
fore precipitate. Because of this tendency, it is difficult to work with amy- 
lose, and to keep it in solution, it is often necessary to keep it at a high 
pH and at relatively high temperatures. Conversely, amylopectin does not 
generally form complexes and is stable in aqueous solutions. In some plant 
varieties. a minor third fraction, referred to as “anomalous amylopectin” or 
.‘intermediate fraction” (Table 11), may also be present and can complicate 
fractionation. This fraction has fewer branch linkages than normal amylo- 
pectin: that is, it has greater average chain length (Hizukuri, 1995). 
The early work of Katz and colleagues in the 1930s established that 
starch can give a number of distinct types of X-ray patterns, depending on 
the source of the starch and the treatment to which the granules were 
subjected. In intact starch granules, three dominant patterns, named A, B, 
and C, can be observed (Fig. 4). In the 194Os, French and his co-workers, 
using flow dichroism and X-ray examination of the amylose-iodine com- 
plex. showed that the amylose molecule is in the form of a helix, as had 
been proposed earlier by Hanes. French et al. suggested that there were 
six D-glucose units in each turn, with the iodine atoms lying along the axis 
of the helix. In 1972, Kainuma and French pointed out that models based 
on a sixfold helix could not satisfy the experimental values obtained by X- 
ray crystallography for B-amylose, and they postulated the presence of 
double helices. In solutions containing suitable “guest” molecules, segments 
of amylose would complex to form single left-handed V-type helices with 
a hydrophobic cavity of about 0.5 nm in diameter. In IdKI solution, the 
guest molecules are polyiodide ions (mostly 13- or Is-). The color and A,,, 
of the complexes vary with chain length and analytic conditions, and the 
iodine binding capacity is around 20 g/lOO g amylose.

FIG. 4. (a) Diffractometer patterns of starch showing typical A, B, and C types of X-ray

types of starch. The C type would be a mixture (in varying amounts for different species) of 
A and B type of packing. After Hizukuri (1995). 
The capacity of starch to stain blue-black with iodine suggests that some 
of the amylose is present in the starch in the V-form. The lipids present 
in cereal starch would bind to amylose if it were in the V-form, and yet 
X-ray analysis does not show the presence of the V-polymorph in cereal 
starches (i.e., most of the amylose would be in the amorphous form). The 
conclusion is that although a significant part of the amylose is probably in 
the helical form, the three-dimensional order necessary to give a crystalline 
diffraction pattern is absent. Indeed, the crystalline nature of starch is now 
attributed to the presence of amylopectin and not to amylose. Starch from 
waxy mutants contains only amylopectin (and no amylose), but this starch 
has the same degree of crystallinity and the same X-ray pattern as the 
regular starches that contain both components. 
Starch granules are microcrystalline, comprising crystalline domains, non- 
crystalline domains, and possibly transitional regions. Native starch granules 

22 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK A N D  JACK PREISS 
have crystallinities estimated to range between 20 and 40%; this relatively 
low crystallinity is responsible for the low-quality X-ray diffractograms. 
Although it is generally thought that branching in a molecule is detrimental 
to crystallization, it seems that in the case of starch, amylopectin, which is 
the branched molecule, and not the almost linear amylose, is the fraction 
responsible for the crystalline nature of starch. Indeed, Hizukuri (1985) 
found that the chain length of amylopectin is a basic factor in the determina- 
tion of the crystalline type of the starch. 
On the basis of the double helix concept (Kainuma and French, 1972), 
several molecular models have been proposed for the unit cell structures 
that would satisfy the X-ray and electron diffraction experimental data. As 
proposed by Imberty et al. (1987, 1988), the double helices in both A and 
B types would be identical, but the mode of packing of the helices and the 
water content would differ (Fig. 4b). The A and B patterns represent 
true crystalline forms of starch, but the C form is a composite, containing 
elements of A and B. Many different structures have been proposed to 
explain the crystalline patterns (Banks and Muir, 1980 French, 1984), but 
it seems that the patterns are a result of a combination of factors, including 
the chain length of the amylopectin, helix packing, and water of crystalliza- 
tion (Hizukuri, 1986). The A pattern is more frequent in cereal starches, 
whereas the B pattern is found in potato and amylomaize starch. The C 
pattern can be obtained by mixing maize and potato starches (Hizukuri et 
al., 1961), but it is also found in nature-for 
example, in smooth-seeded 
peas and in bean starches. Heat-moisture treatment can change the X-ray 
diffraction pattern from the B to the A pattern. Plants producing starch 
giving a B pattern can produce starch with an A pattern if they are grown 
at higher temperatures or if the isolated starch is partly dehydrated. The 
crystallinity of starch granules can be destroyed mcchanically; for example, 
ball milling at room temperature will destroy both the birefringence and 
the X-ray pattern. 
The orientation of the principal axis of the crystallites is radial with 
respect to the hilum (center) of the granule (French, 1972). Small-angle 
X-ray scattering data suggest the existence of a 9-nm repetitive unit that 
is found in all plants, implying the presence of a highly ordered biosynthetic 
pathway that is well conserved throughout the plant kingdom (Jenkins et 
a!., 1993). This repetitive unit is composed of an amorphous and a crystalline 
lamella. Although the sum of both lamellae remains constant (9 nm), the 
relative size of each in the repetitive unit is under genetic control. Lengths 
of 4 to 6 nm have been reported for the size of the crystalline lamella, and 
this would amount to a linear a-1,4-glucan of a size ranging from 12 to 18 
glucose residues. Powder diffraction patterns of native starch have been 
used to determine the three-dimensional structures of the crystalline lamella

(reviewed by French, 1984; Imberty et al., 1991; Hizukuri, 1995), and three 
types of diffraction patterns (A, B, C) were obtained. Each of these patterns 
is interpreted as the packing of linear (unbranched) parallel glucan dou- 
ble helices. 
Amylopectin molecules are very large, flattened disks consisting of a- 
(1,4)-glucan chains joined by frequent a-(1,6)-branch points (Fig. 3). The 
chain that contains the single reducing end group is called the C-chain, to 
which all the other chains are ultimately attached (Fig. 5). The A-chains 
carry no branch points and are attached to B-chains, which have one or 
more branch points and are themselves attached to other B-chains or to 
the one C-chain (Peat et al., 1952). Many models of amylopectin structure 
have been proposed (Fig. 5a), but of these the most satisfactory models, 
those that fit the experimental data available, are those proposed by Robin 
et al. (1974), Manners and Matheson (1981), and Hizukuri (1986; Fig. 5b). 
The arrowheads indicate the presence of a branching point [i.e., an e- 
(1,6) bond], and the branched regions of amylopectin are amorphous. The 
potentially crystalline clusters of A- and B-chains-the 
short, linear chains 
beyond the branch points that can form left-handed, parallel-stranded dou- 
ble helices-are 
also shown. The size of the crystallites is derived from the 
average chain length determined experimentally, and the ratio of A- to B- 
chains in the model can also be measured by enzymatic hydrolysis. Highly 
purified forms of the debranching enzymes isoamylase and pullulanase, 
and the chain-shortening @-amylase, each with well-defined specificities, 
are used to elucidate structural features of amylose, amylopectin, and the 
intermediate fraction. The products of these treatments are then identified 
by chromatography (Fig. 6; Table 111). Hizukuri (1986) observed that size- 
exclusion chromatography of the products of isoamylase action on amylo- 
pectin had a polymodal distribution (Fig. 6a); there are essentially five 
peaks (A, B1, B2, B3, and B4) with chain lengths as indicated. The model 
proposed by Hizukuri (Fig. 5b) takes into account this information, as the 
polymodal distribution in the chromatogram supports his idea of a cluster 
structure: 80 to 90% of the chains (A + B1) span a single cluster, about 
10% (B2) would span (and connect) two clusters, 1 to 3% would span three 
clusters, and only 0.1 to 0.6% would connect four or more clusters. High- 
performance anion chromatograhy (HPAC) is another methodology that 
has proven to be a useful and sensitive tool for studying the structure of 
the linear chains released by debranching amylopectin and related carbohy- 
drates (Fig. 6b). 
The adjacent branch structures in amylopectin would form double helices 
that are organized in a crystalline structure (see preceding), provided that 
the various chains are of suitable length.

B2-, B3-. and B4-chains extend into 2, 3, and 4 cluster regions, respectively. The average 
chain lengths are 19 for B1. 41 for B2. 69 for B3, and 104 for B4. The shortest chain length 
is for the A-chains, which have no branch points.

The linear chains in the amylopectin form red to purple polyiodide 
complexes (Krisman, 1972) with a A,, 
of between 530 and 585 nm. Alto- 
gether, the iodine binding capacity of amylopectin is very low, varying 
between 0 and 2.5 g/g depending on the botanical source of the amylopectin 
(Table IV). There are different kinds of atypical (anomalous) amylopectins 
(Baba et al., 1987; Hizukuri, 1986; Takeda and Hizukuri, 1987), but they 
all bind more iodine and give a higher A,,, 
with 12/KI solutions, leading 
to errors in determining the amylose content in starch when using the blue 
value (BV) or iodine affinity (IA) in the calculations. The IA is measured 
by amperometric titration; as iodine is added, the electric current does 
not increase until all the amylose molecules are saturated with iodine. 
Conversely, amylopectin cannot easily form the helical complex because 
the short chains and many branch linkages interfere with its formation. 
The BV is the absorbance at 680 nm of the iodine-glucan complex, under 
defined conditions, and can also be used to calculate the approximate 
proportion of amylose and amylopectin. One of the factors that affects the 
reliability of the IA and the BV as indicators of the proportion of amylose 
in the starch is the presence of lipids (relatively high in cereals), which also 
bind iodine.

Ill. MOLECULAR ORIENTATION IN THE GRANULE 
Several levels of structural organization exist within the starch granule, 
as shown by the use of different methodologies. For example, starch gran- 
ules show birefringence patterns in plane-polarized light that resemble 
maltese crosses (Fig. 1). Birefringence indicates a great degree of order in 
the molecular orientation, a characteristic that is independent of crystallin- 
ity; that is, noncrystalline polymers can show birefringence if their long 
axes are oriented by applied stress. The analysis of starch birefringence 
indicates that the chain axis of the polysaccharide is radially arranged. The

constraints imposed on the growth of the starch granule by the shape of 
the plastid in which it is formed determine its shape, but do not seem to 
affect the internal arrangement of the molecules, which is analogous to 
that shown by semicrystalline polymers growing in solution. 
Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, or transmission elec- 
tron micrographs of etched and stained thin sections of starch granules 
show a layered “growth ring” structure with ring spacings on the order of 
1 pm. These rings are particularly visible after chemical treatment, and 
they represent shells of higher and lower starch content produced by the 
rate or mode of starch deposition. According to French (1984), growth 
rings would represent periodic growth and, with the cereal starches, daily 
fluctuations in the amount of carbohydrate available for starch deposition. 
The arms of the polarization cross are always perpendicular to the growth 
rings, indicating that the optic axes of the starch crystallites are aligned 
perpendicularly to the growth rings and the granule surface. 
It seems that the molecules of amylose and amylopectin are arranged 
radially within the granule, at a right angle with the surface, and with their 
hypothetical single reducing end group toward the hilum or center of the 
granule (see Chapter 7, Initiation of Starch Synthesis). Growth of the 
granule is by aposition at the outer nonreducing end. 

STRUCTURE OF THE STARCH GRANULE 
29 
Scattering and diffraction measurements coupled with electron micros- 
copy have shown layering within the granule, with unit blocks spaced at 
regular intervals of about 10 nm. These would be the result of regular 
spacing between clusters of partially crystalline amylopectin branches 
(Manners, 1989; Oostergetel and van Bruggen, 1989). 
The model proposed by Kainuma and French (1972) attempts to explain 
the structure of the granule in relation to the polysaccharides that constitute 
it. The model shows the direction of growth of the amylopectin molecule; 
the crystal would grow at a right angle to the length of the molecule. 
Striations in the granule are caused by alternations of crystalline and amor- 
phous zones, and these striations can be better observed with scanning 
electron microscopy of sections of granules partially digested with amylases 
or by acid treatment, which preferentially attacks the amorphous regions. 
At even higher magnification, and using transmission electron microscopy, 
it is possible to distinguish heterogeneities that are of the same magnitude 
as the A- and B-chain segments of amylopectin that are capable of forming 
crystalline parallel-stranded double helices. Order of the crystallites is prob- 
ably responsible for the birefringence mentioned previously. 
IV. METHODOLOGY AND NOMENCLATURE USED IN 
STARCH ANALYSIS 
Much of what we know about starch structure is the result of the painstak- 
ing research of the pioneers of polysaccharide chemistry in the 1930s and 
1940s: W. N. Haworth, E. L. Hirst, D. J. Bell, E. G. V. Percival, and others, 
who by using periodate oxidation, methylation, and paper chromatography 
established the basis for others, such as D. French, W. J. Whelan, and 
D. J. Manners to build on in the 1950s and 1960s. The purification and 
characterization of amylolytic enzymes from several sources have made 
possible the use of enzymatic, rather than chemical, identification of the 
starch components. Why is a detailed identification of the starch compo- 
nents so important? When a mutation affecting a particular enzyme results 
in changes in the seed appearance, the resulting changes in starch structure 
may be subtle: for example, a slight decrease in the average chain length 
of amylopectin or a small increase in the proportion of amylose to amylopec- 
tin. The resulting changes in the pasting quality of the starch, and/or its 
temperature of gelatinization, may be important to the industrial users. 
Identification of the enzymatic changes and of the consequent modification 
of the starch formed will help to illuminate the process of starch biosynthesis 
and to facilitate the task of “designing” a raw material that matches the 
needs of the industrial user. 

30 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
V. OTHER CONSTITUENTS OF THE STARCH GRANULE 
Although the proportion of amylose and arnylopectin and their properties 
are paramount in determining the characteristics of the starch, minor con- 
stituents of the starch granule seem to affect the properties relevant to its 
use as food and in industrial applications. These minor constituents are not 
just contaminants (e.g., particles of bran that remained after scraping the 
wheat grain from the outer bran layer), but materials that are associated 
with the surface of the grain or are true internal components. The surface 
components may be remainders of the amyloplast in which the starch grain 
was formed (during the grain maturation, the amyloplast envelopes are 
disrupted and may remain on the surface of the granule), or the components 
may be endosperm proteins that became strongly attached to the granule 
during the maturation and drying of the grain. The surface components 
can be washed with water or salt solutions. Conversely, the internal compo- 
nents are part of the granule, and to extract them the starch granule must 
be disrupted. 
VI. LIPIDS 
Cereal starches contain low levels of lipids (0.5-1%). which are generally 
polar lipids requiring polar solvents such as methanol-water for extraction. 
Lipid content increases with amylose content, and unless the granule integ- 
rity is disrupted, the lipids remain inaccessible to normal fat solvents, sug- 
gesting that they are present as an amylose inclusion complex. Noncereal 
starches contain essentially no lipids. 
Starches contain phosphorus, nitrogen, and very low amounts of other 
minerals. In the cereals, most of the phosphorus is in the form of phospholip- 
ids, whereas in potato starch the phosphorus is esterified to certain glucose 
residues in the polysaccharide. 
VII. 
PHOSPHORUS 
Generally, the phosphorus content in starches is associated with different 
pasting properties, and it confers a larger ion binding capacity. In wheat 
and corn starch, phosphorus is present largely or wholly as adsorbed phos- 
phatides (extractable with boiling 85% methanol) associated preferentially 
with the amylose fraction. 
Many amylopectins, but not amyloses, contain small amounts of esterified 
phosphate groups, present as residues of glucose 6-phosphate. Adsorbed 

STRUCTURE OF THE STARCH GRANULE 
31 
phosphatides can be removed with suitable solvents, but esterified phos- 
phate, such as that present in potato amylopectin, remains. The content of 
esterified phosphate varies between 200 and loo0 ppm in potato amylopec- 
tin and 40 and 150 ppm in starch from other tubers and roots but is very 
low in cereal starch (less than 20 pprn), with the exception of amylomaize, 
which contains 110-260 ppm (Takeda et aZ., 1993). 
Esterified phosphates have a marked effect on the physical properties 
of amylopectin and the extent of degradation by a- and /?-amylase. After 
amylolysis, phosphorus is concentrated into the limit dextrins. The origin 
of the esterified phosphate, which would be close to the branching points, 
is not known. In general, glucose 6-phosphate and other glycolytic interme- 
diates are not substrates for starch-synthesizing enzymes, and it still remains 
to be determined whether the glucose 6-phosphate residues are incorpo- 
rated into a growing (1+4)--a-~-glucan chain or arise from enzymatic 
phosphorylation of certain residues in amylopectin. Whatever the mecha- 
nism, it is not random, since one-third of the phosphate groups are present 
in the inner regions of B-chains and two-thirds are present in the outer 
parts of the B-chains and in the A-chains. 
The position of the esterified phosphates at C-6 can be determined using 
acid hydrolysis followed by enzymatic methods, but 31P NMR has been 
used to determine the position of ester linkages at other positions, such as 
C-3 and C-2 (Lim and Seib, 1993; Kasemsuwan and Jane, 1994). 
Phosphorus content of potato starch (Geddes et aL, 1965) varies during 
development of the tubers; it increases from being undetectable in the 
amylose of tubers of l-cm diameter, to 0.005% in tubers 8 to 9 cm in 
diameter, and, in amylopectin, from 0.029% in the l-cm diameter to 0.049% 
in the largest (8- to 9-cm tubers). 
Total phosphorus is determined as inorganic phosphate after treatment 
with hot perchloric acid. Phosphorus in ~-glucose-6-phosphate residues is 
assayed using ~-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. 
VIII. PROTEINS 
It has been known for many years that even after exhaustive washes, 
starch still contains small amounts of noncarbohydrate elements. Lipids 
account for most of the phosphorus and about one-third of the nitrogen 
present in wheat starch (Table I). However, amino acids have been recov- 
ered from hydrolyzed starch, indicating that the balance of nitrogen is 
present as proteins. In the case of well-isolated, nondamaged wheat starch, 
proteins represent 0.15 to 0.2% of its weight. This is a very small proportion 
of the flour protein, which comprises all the proteins contained in the 

32 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
endosperm, including storage proteins. However, small, granule-bound pro- 
teins have attracted attention for several reasons. Some, if not all, of the 
starch proteins are likely to be implicated in the formation of the granule. 
The drastic methodology required to extract these proteins from the granule 
makes their purification and characterization a difficult task. Some informa- 
tion is available on the waxy protein (see the chapter, “Starch Synthases”) 
and on the pollen starch protein implicated in human allergy. 
Proteins affect the milling and baking properties of the starch (Gough 
et nl., 1985; Greenwell et al., 1985); the presence of one polypeptide in 
particular, of Molecular Weight 15,000, seems to determine the degree of 
“hardness” of wheat endosperm. 
Inhalation of pollen present in the air provokes IgE-mediated responses 
of hay fever and allergic asthma in about 20% of humans. The allergens 
present in the pollen of rye grass (Loliurn perenne, one of the grasses 
implicated in this response and the one that produces the greatest amount 
of pollen) are a group of low-molecular-weight proteins (Singh et al., 1990). 
Electron microscopy shows that one of them, LolpIb, of Molecular Weight 
31,000 and isoelectric point 9.0, is associated with the starch granules. 
LolpIb accumulates as the pollen grain matures, but its physiologic role is 
unknown. On contact with water the pollen grains burst, releasing the 
starch granules (about loo0 per grain), which are small enough to pass the 
barriers present in the mucose membranes, and amplifying the allergic 
response (Singh et al., 1991).

BIOSYNTHETIC REACTIONS OF STARCH SYNTHESIS 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The metabolic routes leading to polyglucan synthesis were elucidated 
after the discovery of nucleoside-diphosphate sugars by L. F. Leloir and 
co-workers in 1955. This finding led to the conclusion that biosynthesis and 
degradation of glycogen and starch occur by different pathways. 
In mammalian cells, glycogen synthesis is relatively well understood; 
glycogen synthase is specific for UDPglucose and is regulated through 
hormonally induced posttranslational protein modification. Textbooks of 
biochemistry usually describe these metabolite schemes in detail. The bio- 
synthesis of polysaccharides in bacteria and plants is, in contrast, usually 
described in less detail. These organisms accumulate glycogen (bacteria) 
or starch (plants) by metabolic pathways that are different than those 
occurring in animals. Despite the difference in the final product (glycogen 
or starch), in bacteria and in plants ADPglucose is the glucosyl donor for 
the elongation of the a-1,4-glucosidic chain. Moreover, in both plants and 
bacteria, the main regulatory step of the metabolism takes place at the 
level of ADPglucose synthesis. 
II. PIONEERING STUDIES 
The formation of a-1,4-glucosidic linkages in vitro by plant enzymes was 
first demonstrated in 1940, when Hanes showed that potato tuber extracts 
formed an amylose-like product with glucose-1-P as a glucosyl donor (reac- 
tion 1). 
glucose-1-P + a-glucan primer w Pi + (1-~4)-cu-glucosyl-glucan (1) 
Since then, phosphorylase activity has been found to be ubiquitous in plant 
extracts, but its role in vivo is now believed to be starch degradation rather 
than synthesis. 
In the 1960s, L. F. Leloir, C. E. Cardini, and their collaborators in Buenos 
Aires, Argentina, demonstrated the synthesis of a-1,4-glucosidic linkages by 
33

MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
a plant extract using either UDPglucose (Leloir et al., 1961) or ADPglucose 
(Recondo and Leloir, 1961; Frydman and Cardini, 1967) as glucosyl donors 
(reaction 2), which is catalyzed by the starch synthase (EC 2.4.1.21). 
ADP(UDP)glucose + a-glucan + ADP(UDP) 
+ (l-+4)-a-glucosyl-glucan (2) 
Since then. starch synthase activity has been reported to be present in many 
plant extracts (for reviews, see Preiss and Levi, 1980; Preiss and Sivak, 1996). 
The sugar nucleotides UDPglucose and ADPglucose can be synthesized 
in plants either by a pyrophosphorylase-type reaction (reactions 3a and 3b; 
Espada, 1962) or via a reversal of the sucrose synthase reaction (reaction 
4; Cardini ef af., 1955; de Fekete and Cardini, 1964)

I l l .  THE ADPglucose PATHWAY IS THE MAJOR PATHWAY OF 
STARCH SYNTHESIS in Vivo 
Which of the enzymatic activities mentioned previously are involved in 
starch synthesis in vivo? To accept that an enzyme is a likely component 
of the pathway in the plant itself, it must fulfill the following criteria: 
1. On careful extraction (i.e., avoiding proteolysis, inactivation by pheno- 
lics), from the plant tissue, the maximal activities measured in vilro (i.e., 
in the presence of activators at optimum pH) should at least equal the rates 
of starch synthesis measured in viva 
2. The enzyme should be in the right compartment within the cell. 
3. The kinetic characteristics (i.e., affinity for the substrate, effect of 
activators and inhibitors, pH optimum of the enzyme should be compared 

BIOSYNTHETIC REACTIONS OF STARCH SYNTHESIS 
35 
with the concentrations of these substrates and modifiers in the site of 
starch synthesis (i.e., the chloroplast or amyloplast). This comparison will 
help in determining whether the activity in situ is likely to be sufficient to 
support the actual rate of synthesis measured in vivo. Calculation of the 
in vivo concentration of a particular metabolite is not an easy task; it 
involves the isolation of the organelle in question with minimum disruption 
and the avoidance of postisolation changes. With the nonaqueous tech- 
niques, the tissue is quickly frozen and the composition of the different 
components is assumed to be unchanged throughout the nonaqueous frac- 
tionation. The aqueous methods rely on fast separation of the different 
compartments with minimal cross-contamination. 
4. Mutations resulting in the loss of a relevant enzyme should result 
in a commensurate decrease in starch content or a significant change in 
starch structure. 
5. There should be a correlation between increases in the relevant enzy- 
matic activities and the accumulation of starch during the development of 
the tissue (e.g., the potato tuber or the maize seed). 
With these statements in mind, it is easier to address the reports proposing 
that UDPglucose-specific starch synthases and starch phosphorylases may 
be involved in starch synthesis. Their high K,,, values for their substrates 
(UDPglucose and glucose-l-P, respectively), as compared to concentration 
in the relevant cellular compartments, argues against a significant role in 
starch biosynthesis. In addition, the synthesis of UDPglucose, at least in 
the starch-synthesizing plant tissues studied so far, occurs in the cytosol 
and not in the amyloplast, and no significant transport of UDPglucose 
into the plastid has been reported. Phosphorylase catalyzes an equilibrium 
reaction in cells that have Pi concentrations in excess of glucose-l-P, indicat- 
ing that it plays a role in starch degradation rather than in synthesis. 
Data from a number of genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the 
ADPglucose pathway, involving the reactions described in the preceding 
text is very important for starch synthesis. Mutants of maize endosperm 
shrunken 2 and brittle 2 (Tsai and Nelson, 1966; Dickinson and Preiss, 
1969b), which are deficient in ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase (ADPGlc 
PPase) activity, are also deficient in starch. Smith et al. (1989) have shown 
that a pea line having recessive rb genes (genes controlling the level of 
ADPGlc PPase activity in developing pea embryos), containing 3-5% of 
the ADPGlc PPase activity, had only 38 to 72% of the starch found in the 
normal pea line. In Arabidopsis thaliana, Lin et al. (1988b) isolated a mutant 
containing less than 2% of the starch seen in the normal strain and less 
than 2% of the ADPGlc PPase activity. Immunoblots indicated that the 
enzyme was absent from the Arabidopsis extracts. In the potato tuber, 

36 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
Muller-Rober and colleagues (1992) expressed a chimeric gene encoding 
antisense RNA for the ADPGlc PPase small subunit, which caused a reduc- 
tion in enzymatic activity of 2 to 5% of the normal levels, which led to a 
reduction in starch content. 
Thus, in four different plant systems, a reduction of ADPGlc PPase 
activity led to a reduction in starch accumulation. Alternatively, an increase 
in ADPGlc PPase activity was achieved by transformation of the potato 
tuber with a mutant E. coli ADPGlc PPase gene that was insensitive to 
the regulatory effectors of the plant enzyme (Stark el al., 1992). This in- 
creased the potato tuber starch content by 30 to 60%, suggesting not only 
that the role of the ADPGlc PPase in starch synthesis is important, but 
also that the enzyme activity is normally rate limiting. The introduction of 
the bacterial gene into tomato fruit (Stark et af., 1992) and into safflower 
seed (G. Kishore, personal communication, 1997) also increased their starch 
content dramatically. Other data showing a relationship between activity 
of the ADPGlc PPase and starch accumulation in other plant species have 
been previously reviewed (Preiss and Levi, 1980; Preiss, 1988, 1991; Okita, 
1992; Sivak and Preiss, 1995; Preiss and Sivak, 1996). Thus, the ADPGlc 
PPase and the subsequent reactions utilizing ADPglucose are the dominant 
routes for starch synthesis in plants, and ADPglucose synthesis is perhaps 
rate limiting. In the case of starch phosphorylase, the first criterion is 
fulfilled, but the concentrations of Pi and glucose-l-P in the amyloplast and 
chloroplast are considered to be more compatible with a role of the enzyme 
in degradation rather than in synthesis. No correlation between plastid 
phosphorylase activity and starch accumulation has been found. No mutants 
deficient in starch synthesis have been found that are deficient in phospho- 
rylase. Some reports suggest that phosphorylase may play some role in 
starch synthesis (Obata-Sasamoto and Suzuki, 1979; Mengel and Judel, 
1981), a conclusion based on the fact that phosphorylase levels were higher 
than starch synthase andlor ADPGlc PPase. It should be noted, however, 
that insensitive assays for the ADPglucose enzymes were frequently used, 
and that although phosphorylase was found to be higher in activity, the 
physiologic concentrations of Pi and glucose-l-P make it unlikely to ever 
function in a synthetic pathway. The equilibrium constant for phosphorylase 
is 2.4 at pH 7.3 (Cohn, 1961). The ratio of Pi to glucose-l-P has been 
estimated at about 3 : 300 (Heber and Santarius, 1965; Bassham and Krause, 
1969). and subsequent studies agree with this ratio. The K, values measured 
for glucose-l-P are one to two orders of magnitude higher than the glucose- 
l-P concentration calculated for the whole cell. Thus, although the phospho- 
rylase activity, when tested at saturating concentrations of substrate, ap- 
pears to be higher than starch synthase, in physiologic conditions this may 
not be the case. Still, it is possible that in conditions favoring starch synthesis, 

BIOSYNTHETIC REACTIONS OF STARCH SYNTHESIS 
37 
and in the site of starch synthesis (the chloroplast or amyloplast), concentra- 
tions of Pi may be lower and concentrations of glucose-l-P may be higher 
than the whole-cell concentrations averaged over time. 
One approach that would be useful in finding the physiologic role(s) of 
the starch phosphorylase would be the expression of antisense RNA in an 
organ such as the potato tuber [as Muller-Rober and colleagues (1992) have 
done for the AdPGlc PPase; see the following], followed by measurement of 
the corresponding enzyme (plastidial or cytosolic), and a thorough study 
of the effects (if any) of the consequence deficiency of the amyloplast 
phosphorylase on the amount and structure of the starch formed. 
IV. ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS 
In studies reviewed previously (Preiss and Levi, 1980; Preiss, 1988), no 
relationship was noted between starch synthesis and UDPglucose pyro- 
phosphorylase (UDPGlc PPase) (reaction 3b) activity. The high K ,  values 
of starch synthase for UDPglucose, as compared to the measured cellular 
levels, strongly argue against a significant role for UDPGlc PPase in starch 
synthesis. It would seem that the major part, if not all, of UDPGlc PPase 
activity is localized in the cytosol and not in the organelle involved in starch 
synthesis-the 
amyloplast (Bird et al., 1974; Robinson and Walker, 1979; 
Macdonald and ap Rees, 1983). Thus, this high activity does not appear to 
be localized where active starch synthesis occurs. In contrast, the maximum 
activities of ADPGlc PPase and ADPglucose-starch synthase, which are 
localized in the amyloplasts, are at least three times greater than the rate 
of starch accumulation in soybean cultures and 1.3 to 2.7 times greater than 
the rate of starch accumulation in the developing club of the spadix of 
Arum maculatum (ap Rees el aL, 1984). 
An alternate pathway for starch synthesis has been proposed, which is 
based on the finding of a putative ADPGlc translocator in the envelope 
of both amyloplasts and chloroplasts. Akazawa et al. (1991) proposed that 
ADPglucose is synthesized in the cytosol by the sucrose synthase (rather 
than in the plastid by the action of the ADPGlc PPase, as is widely accepted), 
and is then transported into the plastid where it is converted into starch 
by the starch synthase. A critique of this hypothesis is presented in the 
chapter, “The Site of Starch Synthesis in Nonphotosynthetic Plant Tissues: 
The Amyloplast,” where metabolite transport into the plastids is discussed, 
but it is worth mentioning here that this pathway does not fulfill the criteria 
mentioned in the preceding-that 
is, the experimental evidence does not 
support this alternative pathway. 

38 
MIRTA NOEMl SlVAK AND JACK PREISS 
Conversely, a large body of evidence strongly indicates that the main, if 
not the only, pathway of starch synthesis consists of the enzymatic reactions 
catalyzed respectively by ADPGlc PPase (reaction 3a), the starch synthase 
reaction (reaction 2), and the branching enzyme (reaction 5). The data 
supporting this view are from a number of biochemical and genetic studies. 
V. RATE OF STARCH SYNTHESIS VERSUS ACTIVITIES OF THE 
STARCH BIOSYNTHETIC ENZYMES 
A direct relationship between the increase in the activities of starch 
synthase and ADPGlc PPase, and the rate of starch accumulation, has been 
reported for developing maize endosperm (Ozbun et al., 1973), wheat grain 
(Moore and Turner, 1969; Turner, 1969), and potato tubers (Sowokinos, 
1976) (for a review of these, see Preiss and Levi, 1980). 
The man-made intergenic hybrid, triticale (X-Triticosecale Wittmarck), 
may produce in development either plump or shriveled seeds (Dedio et al., 
1975). The difference between the two seeds was originally postulated to 
be due to higher amylase content. However, studies in which the activities 
of the starch biosynthetic enzymes and amylase were measured during seed 
development showed that even though the shriveled seeds contained more 
amylase than the plump seeds, the shriveled appearance occurred earlier 
than the increase in amylase activity (Ching et al., 1983). Starch synthase 
and ADPGlc PPase activities, extracted at different stages of the seed devel- 
opment, were in excess of the measured rates of starch accumulation, indicat- 
ing that these enzymes could play an important role in starch synthesis. 
Similar results were obtained with germinating seeds of Ricinus commu- 
nis (Reibach and Benedict, 1982). Starch levels increased about two-fold 
in the imbibed seed in 5 days. The starch synthase and ADPGlc PPase 
activities increased to a maximum 4 to 5 days after germination and were 
high enough to account for the observed rates of starch synthesis. In this 
study, the ADPGlc PPase activity was 1000-fold higher than the previously 
reported UDPGlc PPase activity (Nishimura and Beevers, 1979). 
In maize ears, the apical kernels develop and pollinate several days after 
basal kernels: the kernels that are formed earlier may have higher survival 
probability, longer growth duration, and higher growth rates. Ou-Lee and 
Setter (1985b) compared the activities of the starch biosynthetic enzymes 
in the apical and basal kernels during development of synchronously polli- 
nated ears. During the period of maximal starch synthesis, the ADPGlc 
PPase and starch synthase activities could account for the observed starch 
accumulation rate in basal kernels, but were slightly less than adequate to 
account for starch synthesis in apical kernels. It should be pointed out, 

BIOSYNTHETIC REACTIONS OF STARCH SYNTHESIS 
39 
however, that it was later shown (Plaxton and Preiss, 1987) that during 
extraction, maize endosperm ADPGlc PPase is particularly sensitive to 
endogenous protease activity, which significantly changes the regulatory 
properties of the enzyme and decreases its stability. It is therefore possible, 
as Ou-Lee and Setter (1985b) suggested, that their assays may have underes- 
timated the starch biosynthetic enzyme activities but, nevertheless, a rough 
correlation between maximal starch accumulation and the levels of the 
starch biosynthetic enzymes was noted. In an extension of this study, the 
effect of differential temperature increases on the growth rate and size of 
the apical kernels was examined (Ou-Lee and Setter, 1985a). The tempera- 
ture was increased to 25°C at 7 days after pollination, as opposed to the 
lower temperatures normally experienced by the plant at nights and in cool 
weather. The tip-heated treatment slightly increased the size of the apical 
kernels at the expense of slightly decreasing the size of more numerous 
basal and middle position kernels, and some of the developmental events 
in the apical kernels were accelerated. The maximal levels of ADPGlc 
PPase and starch synthase activities occurred earlier and correlated well 
with the earlier rise of starch levels in the heated apical kernels, and the 
ADPGlc PPase activities were sufficient to account for the starch content 
measured. Starch synthase activities, measured as granule-bound enzymes, 
were insufficient. Soluble starch synthase activity was not measured. 
Addition of adenine (0.1 mM) to cultures containing tobacco callus 
cells increased the starch content almost 4-fold in 3 days (Gamanetz and 
Gamburg, 1981). Addition of other purine or pyrimidine bases had no 
effect on the starch content. In the cells grown with adenine, there was a 
100-fold increase in the ADPglucose content (there was no effect on the 
UDPglucose content) and a 2.5-fold increase in the specific activity of 
ADPGlc PPase. Adenine has been shown to increase the starch content 
of other plant cells in suspension cultures (i.e., soybean, potato, Atripfex 
sp., dewberry) (Gamanetz and Gamburg, 1981), and it was concluded that 
in the plant cells the adenine pool may be limiting for ADPglucose synthesis. 
Addition of adenine would stimulate ADPglucose synthesis and, therefore, 
starch synthesis. 
In a series of experiments to determine which sugar nucleotide- 
ADPglucose or UDPglucose-plays 
the major role in starch synthesis in 
nonphotosynthetic plant cells, ap Rees et al. (1984) estimated the in vivo 
rates of starch synthesis in the developing club of the spadix of Arum 
maculatum and in suspension cultures of soybean. They compared these 
estimates with the maximum catalytic activities of four enzymes: ADPglu- 
cose- and UDPglucose-starch synthase, ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase, 
and UDPglucose pyrophosphorylase; the amounts of ADPglucose and 
UDPglucose in these cells were also determined. The conclusion was that 

40 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
in Arum clubs and soybean cultures, starch synthesis proceeds almost en- 
tirely via ADPglucose. 
VI. A MISSING STEP? 
As discussed previously, only three reactions-those catalyzed by ADP- 
Glc PPase, starch synthase, and branching enzyme-are 
needed to synthe- 
size all the glucosidic linkages found in the starch granule. However, it is 
interesting to note that the sugary (su) 1 mutation in the maize endosperm 
does not affect the expression of the genes of any of the three activities, 
but still results in a significant reduction in starch granule formation. This 
decrease in starch accumulation is accompanied by an increase in the con- 
tent and an increase in the content of a water-soluble a-1,4-glucan phytogly- 
cogen in such a way that the total polysaccharide content approaches that 
of normal maize. Thus, another enzyme activity may be required to com- 
plete the formation of the starch granule. Pan and Nelson (1984) showed 
that maize endosperm displaying the su 1 mutation was defective in de- 
branching enzyme activity. More recently, the su 1 was cloned (James et 
al., 1995), and sequence analysis of its cDNA showed that it has a high 
degree of homology with a bacterial isoamylase (Yang et al., 1996). Thus, 
Ball et al. (1996) proposed that the su 1 gene, believed to be the structural 
gene for isoamylase activity, is required for formation of the finished amylo- 
pectin product. In other words, a fourth enzyme would be needed to convert 
the product of the branching enzymes into amylopectin, which is able to 
crystallize, trapping the amorphous amylose to form the starch granule. 
This subject is discussed more extensively in the chapter, “Open Questions 
and Hypotheses in Starch.” 
VII. SUMMARY 
The major route to starch biosynthesis involves three reactions. The first 
reaction, catalyzed by ADPGlc PPase (glucose-1-P adenylyltransferase; EC 
2.7.7.27), results in the synthesis of the glucosyl donor ADPglucose. The 
second reaction, catalyzed by starch synthase (ADPglucose: 1,4-a-~-glucan 
4-(r-~-glucosyltransferase; EC 2.4.1 .Zl), transfers the glucosyl group of 
ADPglucose to the nonreducing end of an a-l,lt-glucan primer to form a 
new a-l,4-glucosidic bond. The synthesis of the a-l,6-branch linkages found 
in amylopectin is catalyzed by branching enzyme (1,4-a-~-glucan: 1-4-a-~- 
glucan 6-glycosyl-transferase; EC 2.4.1.18). 

BIOSYNTHETIC REACTIONS OF STARCH SYNTHESIS 
41 
The kinetic properties of the enzymes in the ADPglucose pathway (K, 
and V,,, values), together with the concentrations of substrate and effector 
metabolites in plant cells, are consistent with a major role for the pathway 
in starch synthesis. Conversely, the properties of the UDPglucose-specific 
starch synthases and starch phosphorylases (i.e., the high K, values for 
their substrates, UDPglucose and glucose-1-P, respectively), as compared 
to the concentration in the relevant cellular compartments, argue against 
a significant role or UDPglucose starch synthase and starch phosphorylase 
in starch biosynthesis. No relationship has been observed between starch 
synthesis and the activities of starch phosphorylase or UDPGlc PPase in 
the tissues studied. Moreover, in some starch-synthesizing plant tissues, the 
synthesis of UDPglucose only occurs in the cytosol and not in the amy- 
loplast, where starch is made. 
Analyses of the starch biosynthetic system in a number of plants and 
green algae indicate that an important site of regulation of starch synthesis 
is at the ADPGlc PPase and that 3PGA and Pi are important regulatory 
metabolites of that enzyme.

SYNTHESIS OF THE GLUCOSYL DONOR: 
ADPglucose PYROPHOSPHORYLASE 
I. 
REGULATORY PROPERTIES 
In the biosynthesis of starch and bacterial glycogen, the glucose donor, 
ADPglucose, is formed from ATP and glucose-l-P via a reaction catalyzed 
by ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase ( ADPGlc PPase; glucose-1-1' adenylyl- 
transferase; E.C. 2.7.7.27). This reaction was first described by Espada 
(1962) in soybean and was subsequently found in many plant tissues and 
in bacterial extracts. ADPGlc PPases have been isolated from many plants 
and bacteria, and their regulatory properties have been studied. Although 
the major activators vary according to the source, they share a common 
characteristic: The activator specificity of the enzyme is determined by the 
major pathway of carbon assimilation in the organism. The relationship of 
activator specificity of the ADPGlc PPase of the various organisms with 
the pathways is summarized in Table I. 
The reaction catalyzed by ADPGlc PPase is reversible, and it should be 
noted that regulatory properties can be different in the two directions. For 
example, pyrophosphorolysis is usually much less affected by allosteric 
activators than is the synthesis of the sugar nucleotide (e.g., see Ghosh and 
Preiss, 1966; Preiss et al., 1967). 
Enteric bacteria, such as Escherichiu coli, assimilate glucose via glycolysis 
and regulation of the glycolytic pathway is at the site of fructose-l,6-bis-P 
synthesis (the phosphofructokinase step), and this is the major activator 
for the E. coli ADPGlc PPase (Preiss, 1984; Preiss and Romeo, 1989,1994). 
For organisms where the predominant pathway is the Entner-Doudoroff 
pathway, fructose-l,6-bis-P is not a major metabolite in glucose degradation 
(because glucose-6-P is converted first into 6-P-gluconate and then to 2- 
keto,3-deoxy,6-P-gluconate); 
the activators for their ADPGlc PPase are 
fructose-6-P and pyruvate (Preiss, 1969, 1984; Preiss and Romeo, 1989). 
Rhodospirillum rubrum cannot metabolize glucose but grows anaerobi- 
cally on pyruvate, lactate, or on C02. Pyruvate has been shown to be a 
product of C02 fixation, and it is also the sole activator of the R. rubrum 
ADPGlc PPase (Furlong and Preiss, 1969).

Rhodobacrer spheroides, a highly adaptable organism, can metabolize 
glucose by glycolysis or, under other physiologic conditions, by the Entner- 
Doudoroff pathway, and it can also assimilate C02 during anaerobic photo- 
synthesis. It has an ADPGlc PPase that is effectively activated either by 
fructose-1,6-bis-P, fructose-6-P, or pyruvate (Greenberg et al., 1983) (i.e., 
its adaptability in carbon assimilation is associated with an ADPGlc PPase 
with flexible activation specificity). 
Cyanobacteria, green algae, and higher plants assimilate C02 during 
photosynthesis to form 3-P-glycerate (3PGA). By 1982, ADPGlc PPases 
from several plant species-13 
from leaf and 9 from nonphotosynthetic 
tissues-had 
been shown to be activated by 3PGA (Preiss, 1982b), which 
in most cases increases the affinity for the substrates, ATP and glucose-l- 
P, and reverses the inhibition caused by Pi. Since 1982, ADPGlc PPases from 
other nonphotosynthetic tissues have been studied (e.g., maize endosperm, 
potato tuber, cassava root, rice endosperm), and these tissues were highly 
dependent on the presence of 3PGA and were inhibited by Pi. Some excep- 
tions to this rule have been reported. In the ADPGlc PPases from pea 
embryos (Hylton and Smith, 1992), barley endosperm (Kleczkowski et al., 
1993), and bean cotyledon (Weber et al., 1995), activation by 3PGA is not 
as high, ranging between 1.5- and 3-fold. However, ADPGlc PPases are 
usually much less affected by allosteric activators in the pyrophosphorolysis 
direction than in the synthesis direction (Ghosh and Preiss, 1966; Preiss et 
al., 1967). Activation for the “anomalous” enzymes would likely be higher 
if assayed in the synthesis direction, which is, after all, the direction in 
which the glucose donor is formed. 
In the first studies of maize endosperm ADPGlc PPase, it was thought 
that the enzyme was insensitive to 3PGA activation and Pi inhibition (Dick- 

SYNTHESIS OF THE GLUCOSYL DONOR 
45 
inson and Preiss, 1969a,b). It was found later, however, that if protease 
inhibitors were added to the maize endosperm extracts, activity was then 
very sensitive to activation by 3PGA and to inhibition by Pi (Plaxton and 
Preiss, 1987). It was also shown that if the activity of proteases was not 
prevented, the size of the 54-kDa subunit was reduced to 53 kDa, a small 
but reproducible change in size. Thus, partial proteolysis during enzyme 
isolation can strongly affect ADPGlc PPase regulatory properties, and 
proteolysis may be one reason behind the allosteric insensitivity found in 
the atypical ADPGlc PPases. 
Figure 1 illustrates how relatively small changes in the 3PGA and Pi 
concentrations can greatly affect the rate of ADPglucose synthesis, particu- 
larly at low concentrations of 3PGA, where the activation is minimal, and 
in the presence of Pi. At 1.2 mM Pi and 0.2 mM 3PGA, ADPglucose 
synthesis is inhibited by more than 95%. However, if the Pi concentration 
decreases 33% to 0.8 mM, and the 3PGA concentration increases 50% to 
0.3 mM, there is an 8.5-fold increase in the rate of ADPglucose synthesis.

synthesis is 7.5 nmol per 10 minutes. This is reduced to 2.2 nmol (70% 
decrease) if the 3PGA concentration decreases 50%, to 0.2 mM. If the Pi 
concentration increases to 1.2 mM, the synthetic rate is then reduced to 
0.65 nmol, which is a reduction in ADPglucose synthesis of 91%. The reason 
that small changes in the effector concentrations produce such large effects 
in the synthetic rate is due to the sigmoidal nature of the curves particularly 
at the low concentrations of 3PGA. 
II. 
PHYSIOLOGIC RELEVANCE OF THE ADPGlc PPase 
REGULATORY PROPERTIES 
In vivo and in situ experiments strongly indicate that the activation 
by 3PGA and inhibition by P, observed in vitro are also physiologically 
important. Many experiments have been cited in reviews (Preiss and Levi, 
1980; Preiss, 1982a,b, 1988, 1991, 1996; Sivak and Preiss, 1995; Preiss and 
Sivak, 1996) showing a direct correlation between the concentration of 
3PGA and starch accumulation, and an inverse one between P, concentra- 
tion and starch content. This is true for photosynthetic tissues, in which PI 
and PGA concentrations within the chloroplast are good indicators of the 
energy and carbon status, and in this way the ADPGlc PPase provides a 
good regulatory mechanism for the flux of photosynthate into starch. It 
has been found that the regulatory properties of the enzyme of nonphoto- 
synthetic tissue, such as potato tuber and maize endosperm, are such that 
the ADPGlc PPase is almost completely dependent on the presence of the 
activator. but in these tissues it is still uncertain how 3PGA and PI can signal 
the availability of carbon and energy for starch synthesis, since transport of 
carbon in the amyloplast is via hexose-phosphates rather than by triose- 
phosphates as seen in chloroplasts (Keeling et al., 1988; Heldt et al., 1991; 
Hill and Smith, 1991; Viola ef al., 1991). 
If this activation mechanism is indeed important physiologically, its fail- 
ure should have important consequences in vivo. This has been confirmed 
by chemical mutagenesis in bacteria (Preiss, 1969,1984, 1996), Arabidopsis 
thaliana (Lin et a!., 1988a,b), and in the green algae Chlamydomonas rein- 
hardtii (Ball er al., 1991). More recently, an allosterically altered ADPGlc 
PPase has been reported in maize endosperm (Giroux et al., 1996). In the 
Chfamydomonus system, starch-deficient mutants have been isolated and 
characterized, and have been shown defective in the ADPGlc PPase, which 
could not be effectively activated by 3PGA. The maize endosperm ADPGlc 
PPase allosteric mutant is less sensitive to Pi inhibition than the normal 
enzyme and the mutant endosperm has 15% more dry weight than the 
normal endosperm (Giroux ef al., 1996). The Chlamydomonas starch- 

SYNTHESIS OF THE GLUCOSYL DONOR 
47 
deficient and higher dry-weight maize endosperm mutants ADPGlc PPases 
strongly suggest that the in vitro regulatory effects observed with the photo- 
synthetic and nonphotosynthetic plant ADPGlc PPases are highly func- 
tional in vivo, and that ADPGlc synthesis is rate limiting for starch synthesis. 
Ill. SUBUNIT STRUCTURE 
To study subunit structure, it is essential to determine the molecular 
mass of the holoenzyme by gel filtration and/or sucrose density gradient 
followed by determination of enzymatic activity. The size of the subunits 
can be determined by sodium dodecyl phosphate-polyacrylamide gel elec- 
trophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Put together, this information will show whether 
the enzyme is a monomer or a polymer and, if the latter, how many subunits 
make up the holoenzyme and whether there is only one kind of subunit 
or more than one kind. 
Many bacterial ADPGlc PPases have been purified and in many their 
subunit structure has been determined. Invariably the native enzymes are 
tetrameric with only one kind of subunit, with a molecular mass ranging 
from 49,000 to 54,000, according to the species. 
In contrast, the plant enzyme consists of two related but different subunits 
with masses in the 50,000 to 60,000 range. The “small” subunits have 
molecular masses of about 50,000 to 54,000, whereas the other, “large” 
subunits have molecular masses of 51,000 to 60,000. Although the difference 
in mass between the two subunits in one enzyme can be small, it is still 
convenient to designate them as small and large; they differ in many other 
characteristics, and this is discussed as follows. 
The potato tuber, spinach leaf, and maize endosperm enzymes have small 
subunit masses of 50,OOO, 51,000, and 54,000, respectively, and large subunit 
masses of 51,000, 54,000, and 60,000, respectively. The small and large 
subunits have about 50 to 60% identity with each other and have about 30 
to 40% identity with the procaryotic ADPGlc PPases. 
An ADPGlc PPase that is well studied with respect to structural proper- 
ties is the spinach leaf enzyme (Morel1 et al., 1987, 1988; Ball and Preiss, 
1994). This enzyme has a molecular mass of 206,000 and is composed of 
two different subunits, with molecular masses 51,000 and 54,000. These 
subunits, which can be separated by chromatography after denaturating 
the holoenzyme with urea, can be distinguished not only by their molecular 
masses but also with respect to amino acid composition, amino-terminal 
sequences, peptide patterns on high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) of their tryptic digests, and antigenic properties. The polyclonal 
antibody prepared against the 51-kDa subunit reacted very strongly, in 

48 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
immunoblots, with the 51,000 subunit, but weakly with the 54,000 subunit. 
Conversely, antibodies raised against the large subunit reacted only weakly 
with the small subunit and strongly with the large. Thus, on the basis of 
the protein chemistry and immunologic analyses, the two subunits are 
distinct and probably are the products of two genes. 
Preiss et at. (1990) showed that the maize endosperm ADPGlc PPase, 
which has a molecular mass of 230,000, could react with the antibody 
prepared against the native spinach leaf enzyme in immunoblot experi- 
ments. In SDS gel electrophoresis of endosperm extracts or of the highly 
purified enzyme, two polypeptides of 55 and 60 kDa reacted with the 
antiserum raised against the spinach holoenzyme. The results were different 
when antibodies raised against the separate subunits (large or small) were 
used. The antibody prepared against the spinach leaf large subunit cross- 
reacted mainly with the endosperm large subunit and to a small extent 
with the 55-kDa subunit. The antibody against the spinach leaf small subunit 
antibody cross-reacted well with the endosperm 55-kDa subunit and weakly 
with the 60-kDa subunit. The maize endosperm starch-deficient mutants, 
shrunken 2 (sh 2) and brittle 2 (bt 2), were also studied. In immunoblotting 
experiments and while using antibodies against the native or subunit anti- 
bodies of the spinach leaf enzyme, the mutant bf 2 endosperm lacked the 
55-kDa subunit and the mutant sh 2 endosperm lacks the 60-kDa subunit. 
These results indicate that the maize endosperm ADPGlc PPase is com- 
posed of two immunologically distinctive subunits, and that the sh 2 and bt 
2 mutations cause reduction in ADPGlc PPase activity (and the consequent 
deficiency in starch content) through the lack of one of the subunits. Thus, 
the sh 2 gene would be the structural gene for the 60-kDa, large subunit, 
whereas the bt 2 gene would be the structural gene for the 55-kDa, small 
subunit. 
An ADPGlc PPase cDNA clone, isolated from a maize endosperm library 
(Barton et af., 1986), hybridized with the small subunit cDNA clone from 
rice (Anderson et al., 1989). This maize ADPGlc PPase cDNA clone hybrid- 
izes to a transcript that is present in maize endosperm but absent in bt 2 
endosperm. Thus, the bt 2 mutant appears to be the structural gene of the 
55-kDa subunit of the ADPGlc PPase. These data also indicate that the 
nonphotosynthetic tissue ADPGlc PPase is also composed of two subunits 
and, on the basis of immunoreactivity, there is homology between the large 
and small subunits in the leaf enzyme with the subunits of a reserve tissue 
enzyme, respectively. 
The potato tuber ADPGlc PPase has been highly purified and, by two- 
dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two polypeptides could be 
distinguished by their slight differences in molecular mass, 50,000 and 
51,000, and in net charge (Okita et al., 1990). The tuber small subunit is

reactive with the antibody prepared against the spinach leaf small subunit. 
The antiserum prepared against the spinch leaf large subunit, however, 
does not react with either potato tuber enzyme subunit. The potato tuber 
enzyme is composed of two distinct subunits and is not a homomer as 
initially thought (Sowokinos and Preiss, 1982). 
The ADPGlc PPase of A. thaliana is composed of two subunits, with 
molecular masses of 51,000 and 54,000. One A. thaliana mutant, TL25, 
lacks both subunits of the ADPGlc PPase (it is thought that the mutation 
affects a regulatory locus), whereas another mutant, TL46, lacks the large, 
54-kDa subunit only. The TL46 mutation provides further evidence that 
the larger subunit is a necessary component of the native ADPGlc PPase 
for optimal activity since the mutant has only 7% of the wild-type activity. 
The mutant synthesizes starch at 9% of the rate displayed by the wild type 
in high light, and at 26% of the wild-type rate measured at low light (Neu- 
haus and Stitt, 1990). 
IV. STRUCTURE-FUNCTION RELATIONSHIPS 
The researcher who wants to elucidate the mechanism of action and the 
regulation of an enzyme has many methodological tools at his disposal, 
and more become available every year. 
Chemical modification can supply information on the amino acids in- 
volved in the active and regulatory sites. The amino acid sequences obtained 
by Edman degradation of the proteins purified from different tissues and 
species, and/or by cloning followed by deduction of amino acid sequences, 
can be compared. This exercise will point out the amino acid sequences 
well conserved in enzymes from different sources, which are likely to be 
essential for enzyme function. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the amino 
acids deemed to be crucial are replaced by others, and the effect of these 
changes on the properties of the enzyme are studied. To achieve this objec- 
tive, E. coli is transformed with the mutated gene in a suitable vector, the 
overexpressed enzyme is purified, and its properties are compared with 
those of the enzyme obtained from bacteria transformed with the nonmu- 
tated gene. 
Chemical mutagenesis, followed by screening for starch with iodine re- 
agent, can help identify amino acids crucial for binding or catalysis in an 
approach similar to that used for the ADPGlc PPase of E. coli. In plants, 
chemical mutagenesis has been used with A. thafiana, (Lin et al., 1988a,b), 
with C. reinhardtii (Ball et al., 1991), and with the potato enzyme expressed 
in E. coli (Greene et al., 1996). As for any methodology intending to identify 
a crucial amino acid, the effect of the mutation in a single amino acid must 

SO 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
be specific for a particular substrate or modulator. A generalized effect 
indicates that the amino acid in question affects the general conformation 
of the enzyme. 
V. FUNCTION OF THE HIGHER PLANT ADPGlc PPase SUBUNITS 
After discovering that the plant native ADPGlc PPases were tetrameric 
and composed of two different subunits, the next step was to determine 
why the two subunits were required for optimal catalytic activity. Since the 
enzyme must contain ligand binding sites for the activator (3PGA), inhibitor 
(P,). sites for the two substrates (ATP and glucose-1-P), as well as a catalytic 
site. it is possible that these sites could be located on different subunits. 
Two cDNAs encoding the mature large subunit and small subunits of 
the potato tuber (Solanurn trrberosum L.) ADPGlc PPase have been ex- 
pressed in E, coli (Iglesias et al., 1993; Ballicora et al., 1995). The large 
subunit and small subunits could be expressed separately as well as together. 
As seen in Table 11, considerable activity of ADPGlc PPase is obtained 
when the cDNA of the large subunit is expressed along with the cDNA of 
the small subunit enzyme in an E. coli mutant devoid of ADPGlc PPase 
activity. The purified recombinant enzyme, containing both the large and 
small subunits. has a specific activity of 64 pmol . min-' 
* mg-.' when 
measured in the presence of the activator (3 mM 3PGA). If the large sub- 
unit is expressed alone, little activity is observed. However, expression of the 
small subunit alone leads to significant ADPGlc PPase activity (Ballicora et 
al., 1995). This homomeric (four small subunits) enzyme has been puri-

mg-l when measured in the presence of a high concentration (4 mM) of 
3PGA. As shown in Table 11, the enzyme composed exclusively of small 
subunits has a lower apparent affinity (f& 
= 2.4 mM) for the activator, 
3PGA, than the heterotetramer. The enzyme with only the small subunit 
is also more sensitive to Pi inhibition (10.5 of 0.08 mM in the presence 
of 3 mM 3PGA) as compared with the heteromeric enzyme (Io.5 value of 
0.63 mM). The &values for the substrates and Mgt2 are essentially the same 
whether the enzyme is composed of only one subunit, the small subunit, or 
two subunits, small and large. In every case the native enzyme is a tetra- 
mer-a 
homotetramer in the case of the small subunit alone and a heterote- 
tramer in the case of the large and small subunits (Ballicora et af., 1995). 
These data suggest that the small subunit is primarily involved in catalysis; 
it has substantial activity in the absence of the large subunit if the concentra- 
tion of 3PGA, the activator, is high. The large subunit, when expressed 
alone, has little activity, but if expressed with the small subunit, the resulting 
enzyme has similar regulatory kinetic constants as does the native potato 
enzyme. This suggests that the prime function of the large subunit would 
be to regulate the activity of the small subunit, increasing the apparent 
affinity for the activator, and decreasing the affinity for the inhibitor Pi. 
This information agrees with results obtained with A. fhalianu, in which 
the mutant ADPGlc PPase lacking the large subunit had activity but its 
affinity for the activator, 3PGA, was lower and the affinity for Pi was higher 
than for the wild-type heterotetrameric enzyme (Li and Preiss, 1992). 
The small subunit of the higher plant ADPGlc PPases is highly conserved 
(85-95% identity), whereas the large subunit is less conserved (50-60% 
identity; Smith-White and Preiss, 1992). The higher heterogeneity seen 
in the large subunit sequence probably reflects different demands in the 
modulation of the small subunit sensitivity to allosteric activation and inhibi- 
tion posed by different demands of the tissue and species. Expression of 
large subunits would differ during development or in different plants and 
tissues (e.g., leaf, stem, guard cells, tuber, endosperm, root, embryo), provid- 
ing the resulting ADPGlc PPases with differing sensitivities to regulators. 
VI. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SUBSTRATE BINDING SITES 
Chemical modification can be used to obtain information on the catalytic 
mechanism and on the catalytic site of the enzyme of interest. One goal in 
the design of affinity labels for enzymes is to determine the catalytically 
important residues. First, the affinity label has to behave as an analogue of 
the substrate (or of the activator or inhibitor) by competition experiments. 

52 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PRESS 
Second, the enzyme is covalently bound to the affinity label in conditions 
chosen according to the enzyme in question and the chemical nature of 
the analogue, so as to decrease nonspecific labeling. Third, the labeled 
enzyme is subjected to proteolysis and the radioactive peptide(s) are iso- 
lated by HPLC. The labeled peptide(s) are then sequenced, providing 
information about the domains of the enzyme involved in the interaction 
with the substrate (or with the modulators). 
Chemical modification studies on ADPGlc PPase have involved the use 
of the following affinity labels: 
1. Pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP), an analog of 3PGA or phosphorylated 
sugars that can be covalently bound to the enzyme by reduction with 
NaBH,, 
2. The photoaffinity substrate analogs, 8-azido-ATP and 8-azido-ADPglu- 
cose. When ultraviolet (UV) light (257 nm) irradiates 8-azido com- 
pounds, a nitrene radical is formed, which can react with electron-rich 
residues and inactivate the enzyme. 
3. Phenylglyoxal, for the identification of arginine residues 
These studies have provided information on the catalytic and regulatory 
sites of the spinach and cyanobacterial ADPGlc PPases, and on the role 
of the large and small subunits (Morel1 et al., 1988; Smith-White and Preiss, 
1992; Ball and Preiss, 1994; Charng et af., 1994). 
In addition, residues that chemical modification suggested were involved 
in substrate binding have been subjected to site-directed mutagenesis (Ku- 
mar et al., 1989; Hill et al., 1991; Charng et al., 1994, 1995; Sheng et al., 
1996). These studies have provided information on the catalytic and regula- 
tory sites of the spinach ADPGlc PPase and on the role of the large and 
small subunits. They have also shown that many of the studies initiated 
with the bacterial ADPGlc PPases are highly relevant for studies on the 
higher plant enzyme (Kumar el al., 1988; Hill et al., 1991; Charng et al., 
1994; Sheng et al., 1996). 
In the ADPGlc PPase from E. coli, the Lys residue 195 has been identified 
as the binding site for the phosphate of glucose-1-P (Hill et af., 1991), and 
tyrosine (Tyr) residue 114 has been identified as involved in the binding 
of the adenosine portion of the other substrate, ATP (Lee and Preiss, 1986). 
When the amino acid sequence of the E. coli enzyme is aligned with those 
from the plant and cyanobacterial ADPGlc PPases, the identity ranges 
from 30 to 33% (Smith-White and Preiss, 1992). Sequence identity is much 
higher when only the ATP and glucose-1-P binding sites (Table 111) are 
compared with the corresponding sequences of the plant and cyanobacterial 
enzymes, suggesting that those sequences are still important in the plant 
enzyme, probably having the same function.

The binding site for pyridoxal phosphate in the small subunit was isolated, 
revealing a lysine (Lys) residue close to the C terminus, which may be 
important for 3PGA activation (Morel1 etal., 1988). When PLP is covalently 
bound (Fig. 2), the plant ADPGlc PPase no longer requires 3PGA for 
activation; and the binding of PLP is prevented by the allosteric effectors, 
3PGA and Pi. These observations indicate that the activator analog, PLP, 
is binding at the activator site. In addition, Preiss et al. (1992) and Ball and 
Preiss (1994) showed that three Lys residues of the spinach leaf large 
subunit are also involved or are close to the binding site of pyridoxal-P 
and, presumably, to the activator, 3PGA (Table IV). The chemical modifi- 
cation of these Lys residues by pyridoxal-P was prevented by the presence

FIG. 2. Chemical modification is one of the tools used to identify the amino acid residues 
involved in the binding of a substrate. activator. or inhibitor. In the case of the ADPglucose 
pvrophosphorylase ( ADPGlc PPase), the allosteric sites can be modified using pyridoxal-5- 
phosphate (PLP). PLP forms a Schiff base with an E-amino group of a Lys residue. This Schiff 
base is converted to a stable secondary arnine by reduction with NaBH4. The modified enzyme 
no longer requires activator for catalysis, indicating that a Lys residue participates in the 
binding of the activator. This evidence is supported by the fact that modification of the enzyme 
with PLP can be prevented if an allosteric effector (i.e.. 3PGA or PI) is present when the 
enzyme is incubated with PLP. 
of 3PGA during the reductive pyridoxylation process and, in the case of 
the Lys residue of site 1 of the small subunit and site 2 of the large subunit, 
Pi also prevented them from being modified by reductive pyridoxylation. 
Thus, it is believed that the most important sites involved are sites 1 and 
2. Similar results were obtained with the Anabaena ADPGlc PPase (Charng 
et af., 1994). Chemical modification of the enzyme with PLP caused the 
cyanobacterial enzyme no longer to require activator for maximal activity; 
chemical modification was prevented by 3PGA and Pi. The modified Lys 
residue was identified as Lys-419 and the sequence adjacent to that residue 
is similar to that observed for site 1 sequences in the higher plants. Site- 
directed mutagenesis of Lys-419 to either Arginine (Arg), Alanine (Ala), 
Glutamine (Gln), or glutamic acid (Glu) produced mutant enzymes (ex-

a The sequences listed in one-letter code are from Smith-White and Preiss (1992). 
The sequences of the barley endosperm enzyme are from Villand et al. (1992). The 
Lys residues underlined indicate they are covalently modified by pyridoxal-P and the 
chemical modification of the Lys residue is prevented by 3PGA and Pi, or site-directed 
mutagenesis has identified them to be involved in binding the activator. The numbers 
441 and 417 correspond to the Lys residues in the potato tuber ADPGlc PPase small 
subunit. Site 1 is present both in the large and in the small subunits of the plant ADPGlc 
PPase, whereas site 2 is only in the large subunit even though similar sites are observed 
in the small subunit. 
pressed in E. coli) with lowered affinities, 25- to 150-fold lower than that 
of the wild-type enzyme. No other kinetic constants, such as affinity for 
substrates and the inhibitor, Pi, were affected, nor was the heat stability or 
the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme affected. These mutant enzymes, 
however, were still activated to a great extent at higher concentrations of 
3PGA, suggesting that an additional site was involved in the binding of 
the activator. The Lys-419 in the Arg mutant was chemically modified 
with the activator analog, PLP, and Lys 382 was the amino acid that was 
reductively phosphopyridoxylated. Modification of Lys-382 in the Arg mu- 
tant also caused a dramatic alteration in the allosteric properties of the 
enzyme, which could be prevented by the presence of 3PGA or Pi during 
the chemical modification process. Therefore, Lys-382 was identified as the 
additional site involved in the binding of the activator and, as seen in Table 
IV, the adjacent sequence about Lys-382 in the Anabaena enzyme is similar 
to that seen for site 2. 
In the ADPGlc PPases of Anabaena and higher plants, there are five 
highly conserved Arg residues that are not present in the enteric bacterial 
ADPGlc PPases. As discussed previously, the regulatory characteristic of 
enteric bacteria are different from those of cyanobacteria and higher plants: 

56 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
for example, the enteric ADPGlc PPases are not inhibited by Pi, but by 5- 
AMP. Phenylglyoxal inactivation of the spinach enzyme can be prevented 
by 3PGA or by Pi, which is evidence that one or more Arg residues are 
present in the allosteric sites of the spinach leaf enzyme. Both subunits of 
the spinach leaf enzyme were labeled when ['4C]phenylglyoxal was used 
(Ball and Preiss, 1992). Thus, Arg residues may also be involved in the 
binding of the allosteric ligands, particularly Pi. Site-directed mutagenesis 
was used to find out whether these five Arg residues were in some way 
responsible for the different regulatory properties. All five conserved Arg 
residues in the Anabaena ADPGlc PPase-that 
is, Arg 66, 105, 171, 294, 
and 385 were mutagenized to Ala (Sheng and Preiss, 1998). As shown in 
Table V, the Arg 294 Ala mutation resulted in a mutant enzyme with a 
much lower affinity for the inhibitor, phosphate, measured in the absence 
or presence of 3PGA. This mutation had no (or little) effect on the kinetic 
constants for the substrates or for the activator, 3PGA (Sheng and Preiss, 
1998), and it can be concluded that Arg 294 of the Anabaena enzyme is 
involved in the binding of Pi. The activator, 3PGA, and the inhibitor, Pi, 
probably bind to different sites, although there could be some overlapping. 
Another effect of the site-directed mutagenesis was that the purified 
mutant enzyme Arg 294 Ala had a 3-fold higher specific activity than 
the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that with disappearance of the inhibitor 
binding site there was also a conformational change, resulting in an enzyme 
with a higher catalytic efficiency. These results not only clarified another 
aspect of the structure-function relationships of the ADPGlc PPase, but 
also resulted in the creation of an enzyme that might be useful in the 
development of transgenic crops with higher starch production.

SYNTHESIS OF THE GLUCOSYL DONOR 
57 
As discussed previously, cDNA clones encoding the putative mature 
forms of the large and small subunits of the potato tuber ADPGlc PPase 
have been expressed together, using two different compatible vectors, in 
an E. coli mutant deficient in ADPGlc PPase activity (Iglesias et al., 1993; 
Ballicora et al., 1995; Table 11). This expression system was then used 
for site-directed mutagenesis experiments aiming to test whether the Lys 
residues in the potato tuber ADPGlc PPase have a role in activation, as 
suggested by the chemical modification (with pyridoxal-P) experiments of 
the spinach enzyme. 
As shown in Table VI, site-directed mutagenesis of Lys 441 of the potato 
ADPGlc PPase small subunit to Glu and Ala results in mutant enzymes 
with lower affinity, 30- to 83-fold, respectively, for 3PGA (Ballicora et al., 
1996; Preiss et al., 1996). A conservative mutation to arginine resulted in 
only a two-fold increase in &.s, indicating that the positive charge of the 
cationic amino acid is important for the binding of the activator. Mutagene- 
sis of Lys residue 417 in the large subunit (the residue homologous to the 
Anabaena Lys residue 382 and to site 2 of the spinach leaf large subunit 
Lys residue modified by PLP) was also done. When Lys 417 was replaced 
by either Ala or Glu, the affinity for 3PGA decreased (Table V) but the 
increase in A0.5 was only 3- to 13-fold and not as high as seen with the 
mutations of the small, 50-kDa subunit Lys 441 residue. When both Lys 
residues in the large (51-kDa) and small subunits were mutated, the de- 
crease in affinity or increase in A0.5 was additive. Thus, Lys residues in 
both subunits seem to contribute to the binding of the activator.

Random mutagenesis has also been used to determine whether other 
sequence regions or amino acids in the large subunit are important for the 
allosteric function (Greene et al., 1996a,b). In one study (Greene et al., 
1996b), the Asp residue 416 (413 in the special notation used by Greene 
et a/.) was mutated to an Ala residue and the affinity for 3PGA decreased 
about 6-fold, similar to the decrease observed when Lys 417 was mutated 
to Ala (Ballicora et al., 1996; Table IV). In a second mutant isolated via 
random mutagenesis, Leu had replaced the proline residue 52 (Greene 
et af., 1996a). The mutant enzyme's affinity for 3PGA was substantially 
decreased; the A,,5 being increased 45-fold in mutant P52L, suggesting that 
a region of the large subunit N-terminal may also be involved in the forma- 
tion of the allosteric activator binding site. 
Giroux et al. (1996) described the effect of a single gene mutation in the 
sh 2 locus of maize (coding for the large subunit of the ADPGIc PPase), 
which increases seed weight by 11 to 18% without changing the proportion 
of the seed weight taken by starch. The direct effect of the mutation is the 
addition of two amino acids, tyrosine and serine, that seem to decrease the 
sensitivity of the ADPGlc PPase to inhibition by phosphate. This change 
in regulatory properties was found in the ADPGlc PPase measured in the 
seed extract and in the enzyme expressed in E. coli. When the researchers 
placed the two extra amino acids in the corresponding position of the potato 
tuber ADPGlc PPase, expressed in E. coli, they observed a similar decrease 
in sensitivity to Pi. 
VII. CLONING OF THE ADPGlc PPase GENES AND COMPARISON 
OF THEIR SEQUENCES 
Many cDNA or genomic clones for the small subunit ADPGlc PPase 
gene of rice endosperm (Krishnan et ul., 1986; Anderson et ul., 1989,1990), 
maize endosperm (Barton et d, 
1986), spinach leaf (Preiss et ul., 1989), A. 
thaliana (B. Smith-White and J. Preiss, unpublished results, 1998), and 
potato tuber (Anderson et uL, 1990; Nakata et d, 
1991) have been isolated. 
In addition, a cDNA clone for the maize endosperm ADPGlc PPase large 
molecular subunit (Sh 2 locus) has also been isolated (Barton et uf., 1986). 
Olive et al. (1989) isolated cDNA clones from wheat leaf and wheat endo- 
sperm, which are now considered to represent the large subunit gene of the 
ADPGlc PPase, as suggested by the deduced amino acid sequence. 
Although the isolation of the spinach leaf large subunit cDNA clone 
has not been reported, the major portion of the spinach leaf large subunit 
(54 kDa) has been sequenced by the Edmann degradation technique (B. 
Smith-White and J. Preiss, 1992). Since 1991, many other ADPGlc PPase 

SYNTHESIS OF THE GLUCOSYL DONOR

genes, either genomic or represented by a cDNA, have been isolated from 
many plants and different tissues, and they are too numerous to cite here. 
Figure 3 shows the deduced amino acid sequences of 45 subunits of ADPGlc 
PPases obtained from the EMBL nucleotide sequence library and 
GenBank. 
At the DNA level, the isolated genes are dissimilar. For example, in 
wheat leaf and wheat endosperm, there is only 55.7% identity (Olive et al., 
1989) and, on the basis of Southern blot hybridization analyses and restric- 
tion enzyme mapping, it is concluded that there are at least two distinct 
gene families in wheat. For spinach leaf and rice endosperm, there is only 
approximately a 50% identity (B. S. White and J. Preiss, unpublished re- 
sults, 1998). 
Good identity is observed in comparing amino acid sequences of similar 
subunits of the ADPGlc PPase from the different plants, and this is expected 
since the spinach leaf lower-molecular-weight subunit antibody reacts well 
with the equivalent subunits of maize endosperm (Plaxton and Preiss, 1987; 
Preiss et al., 1990), rice seed (Krishnan et al., 1986; Anderson et al., 1989), 
Arabidopsis leaf (Lin et al., 1988a,b), and potato tuber (Okita et al., 1990) 
enzymes. The lower-molecular-weight antibody does not react well with 
the higher-molecular-mass subunit of the ADPGlc PPase of these various 
plants. Therefore, it was not expected that much homology would be seen 
between the lower- and higher-molecular-weight subunits. However, there 
appears to be some identity (approximately 40-60%) between the large 
and small subunits of the higher plant ADPGlc PPase (Fig. 3). 
Because of the relatively low but certain homology between the two 
subunits of the ADPGlc PPase, it can be speculated that they may have 
arisen originally from the same gene. The bacterial ADPGlc PPase is a 
homotetramer composed of only one subunit (Preiss, 1984). The cyanobac- 
terial ADPGlc PPase has 3PGA as an allosteric activator and Pi as an 
inhibitor, similar to the enzyme from higher plants (Levi and Preiss, 1976), 
and unlike the bacterial enzymes (e.g., fructose-1,6-biphosphate 
is the acti- 
vator in enteric bacteria). Both bacterial (Preiss, 1984; Preiss and Romeo, 
1989) and cyanobacterial (Iglesias etal., 1991) ADPGlc PPases are homotet- 
rameric, unlike the higher plant enzymes, indicating that regulation by 
3PGA and Pi (a good signaling system for a photosynthetic organism) is 
not related to the heterotetrameric nature of the higher plant enzyme. It 
is possible that during evolution there was duplication of the ADPGlc 
PPase gene, and divergence of the genes then produced two different genes 
coding for the two peptides, both of which were required for optimal activity 
of the native higher plant enzyme. 
As indicated in the preceding, one can tentatively assign catalytic function 
to the small subunit of the ADPGlc PPase. The extensive identity and

FIG. 3. Alignment of the primary structures of ADPGlc PPase proteins from various plants. The sequences were obtained from either GenBank or EMBL 
nucleotide sequence library. except for Zeu mays bride 2 (obtained from L. C. Hannah) and Arabidopsis thaliana large and small subunits (B. S. White and 
J. Preiss, unpublished results. 1998). Alignment of the sequences was done essentially as described by Smith-White and Preiss (1992). The small subunit 
sequences are shown in the top and the large subunit in the bottom. Also shown are five diagnostic classes that have been formulated for residues in the 
sequence, which are residues in sequences found only in the small subunit, residues found in all members of the small subunit class sequences, residues 
found in sequences present only in the large subunit. residues found in all members of the large subunit class, and residues found in all plant ADPGIc PPases.

similarity in sequence between the small subunits isolated from different 
plants and tissues supports this view. In the case of the large subunit, in 
which amino acid sequences have less similarity to what is observed for the 
small subunits. it is possible that the different large subunits lend different 
regulatory properties for the heterotetrameric ADPGlc PPases of different 
species and/or tissues. Thus, because the different sequences of the large 
subunit reflect their occurrences in different plant tissues (e.g., leaf, stem, 
guard cells, tuber, endosperm, root) (Smith-White and Preiss, 1992), it is 
possible that these sequence differences render the isolated enzyme from 
different tissues to have different allosterk properties. 
VIII. HYDROPHOBIC CLUSTER ANALYSIS 
Preparation of single crystals followed by X-ray diffraction analysis can 
picture accurately the structure of a protein at a high, atomic resolution. 
Computing advances have accelerated the process of converting a diffrac- 
tion pattern into a molecular model. However, crystallization is far from 
a routine procedure, as the conditions required by a particular protein can 
only be found by screening a multitude of media (now available commer- 
cially) known to favor crystallization. Obtaining a crystal is a hit-or-miss 
business with no theory; the proteins whose structures have been revealed 
so far have not been chosen for their interest but because of their propensity 
to crystallize. Sometimes good crystals can be grown, but they do not 
diffract because they have very large unit cell dimensions or they decay 
rapidly in the X-ray beam. Some proteins are easier to crystallize than 
others, and the ADPGlc PPase from E. cofi and Anabaena are among the 
more difficult ones. One factor affecting crystallization is the high degree 
of hydration of the molecule, and so far only small crystals have been 
obtained, and these were unstable under X-ray diffraction (Mulichak et 
af., 1988). 
Until good crystals have been obtained, there are other avenues for 
obtaining information about the structure of proteins that are difficult to 
crystallize. As observed by Kendrew when he solved the structure of the 
myoglobin, the main driving force for folding water-soluble globular protein 
molecules is to pack hydrophobic side chains into the interior of the mole- 
cule, thus creating a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic surface. The main 
chain in the interior is arranged in secondary structures to neutralize its 
polar atoms through hydrogen bonds. There are two main types of second- 
ary structure: alpha- (a-) 
helices and beta- (&) sheets. Protein structures 
are built up by a combination of secondary structural elements, a-helices, 
and &strands. These form the core regions-the 
interior of the molecule-

69 
and are connected by loop regions at the surface. Schematic diagrams where 
these structures are highlighted are useful; in addition, a-helices and p- 
strands that are adjacent in the amino acid sequence are usually adjacent 
in the tertiary structure. 
Hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) is a technique that displays the 
clusters of hydrophobic amino acids present within the primary sequence. 
It has been used to align amino acid sequences, to predict secondary struc- 
tures, and to help find similar structures in proteins with a low homology 
(Lemesle-Varloot et al., 1990). The amino acids are plotted as an a-helix 
and the representation is duplicated to avoid cutting off clusters with the 
“wrapping” that occurs when one turn of the helix is completed. In the 
original method, hydrophobic amino acids are highlighted and encircled to 
signal the presence of a hydrophobic cluster. This technique was applied 
to the ADPGlc PPase from E. coli (Ballicora et al., 1996) and, since the 
technique is most useful when homologous proteins are compared, the 
sequence of the enzyme from a cyanobacteria (Anabaena) was also ana- 
lyzed. The modification by Rost and Sander (1993) of the original technique 
facilitates the identification of clusters and, in the case of ADPGlc PPases 
from E. coli and Anabaena, it stresses the similarities between the two 
proteins. Proline and glycine are known “breakers” of helices and sheets, 
and a cluster is not drawn when one of these amino acids is included in it. 
From the hydrophobic analysis using the profile neural network (PHD) 
program, it is clear that the ADPGlc PPases from E. coli and Anabaena 
are identical in the position of many clusters, and in some others the 
differences are small. There are some insertions and deletions in the se- 
quence, but they do not alter the general pattern of the clusters because, 
in these insertions, the analysis shows no buried amino acids. This suggests 
that the small insertions seen among ADPGlc PPases are not part of the 
“core” of the protein. Analysis of higher plant ADPGlc PPases show a 
similar pattern of clusters. For example, even though the homology in 
amino acid sequence is lower between the enzyme from E. coli and the 
small and large subunits of the potato tuber enzyme, all the clusters present 
in the bacterial enzyme are also present in both subunits of the plant 
ADPGlc PPase. This indicates that the ADPGlc PPases from different 
sources share a common folding pattern, despite a different quaternary 
structure (heterotetramer in plants, homotetramer in bacteria) and a differ- 
ent specificity for the activator. 
If the ADPGlc PPases from different sources have similar three- 
dimensional structures, the structure of one should help predict the second- 
ary structure of another. The sequence of enzymes from E. coli and Ana- 
baenu, and also from the two subunits of the potato tuber enzyme, were 
analyzed using the PHD program. One general structure that fits all of 

70

these proteins was predicted (Fig. 4). The ADPGlc PPase is an d p  protein, 
but some parts of it are mainly beta, such as the C-terminal and the domain 
denoted as 3. To verify whether the model is valid, it was tested against 
the biochemical data available, including the results of partial proteolysis 
that is, trypsin treatment of the Anabaena and the E. coli enzymes (Y. Y. 
Charng and J. Preiss, unpublished results, 1992) and proteinase K (M. Wu 
and J. Preiss, unpublished results, 1997) digestion of the E. coli enzyme. 
The peptides obtained by protease treatment were analyzed (Fig. 5). Ex- 
posed loops would be more sensitive to proteolysis, and the protease studies, 
which actually cut in sites predicted as loops by the model, confirm the 
structure proposed. The only exception is the a-helix predicted near the

FIG. 5. Controlled digestion of the ADPGlc PPase from E. coli by protease K. The full 
segment PO represents the sequence of the native enzyme; the amino acid residues known to 
be important in enzyme function, binding of the substrates, or of the allosteric ligands are 
shown. Protease K cleaves first the more accessible peptidic linkages 181 to 182 and 192 to 
193, inactivating the enzyme and originating the peptides P1 and P2. Cleavage also occurs at 
the N-terminal side of the polypeptide at the 4-5,8-9, and 11-12 bonds, giving rise to peptides 
P3, P4, and P5. When the enzyme is incubated with the protease in the presence of ADPGlc, 
fructose-l,&bis-P and Mg”, the internal peptide bonds are protected, and only degradation 
at the N-terminal is observed. 
C-terminal of the Anabaena enzyme. Since this is an insertion (20 aa) that 
is absent in E. coli, and it is not predicted as buried in Anabaena, most 
likely this helix is not part of the core and is part of a loop. It is also worth 
noting that most of the conserved amino acids known to have roles in the 
binding of substrates (E. coli Y114, K195) and activators (E. coli K39, 
Anabaena K382, K419) are located in loops or are very close to loops. 
The residues P295 and G336 that are involved in areas important for the 
regulation of the E. coli enzyme (Preiss and Romeo, 1989, 1994; Preiss, 
1996) are also in loops. 
A common supersecondary structure (“motif ”) seen in nucleotide bind- 
ing proteins in general (Rossman et al., 1974) is also present in this model- 
that is, the glycine loop in the domain 1, which would bind the phosphates 
of the ATP, and the region 2, with three P-sheets and a-helices compatible 
with a Rossmann fold. It is likely that regions 1, 2, and 3 form a catalytic 
domain, composed of a typical crlp structure where the substrates bind on 
the top of the model as depicted in Fig. 4. The prediction of the secondary 
structure of the ADPGlc PPase in region 1 + 2, is identical to the accepted 
structure of the oncogenic protein H-Ras (p21), which is used as one of the 
folding models for nucleotide phosphate binding GTP (Tong et al., 1991). 
In region 2, the loops on the N side of the 6-sheets (C end of the helices) 
have no amino acids conserved in all the sequences of the ADPGlc PPases 

72 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
known. This is compatible with the idea that the binding of ATP is located 
in the other side of the a/@ structure. For topological reasons, these loops 
would not be accessible to the substrate and, as a consequence, evolutionary 
pressure to conserve the amino acids in these loops is lower than in the 
loops located at the C end of the @sheets. 
IX. TRANSCRI PTlON 
Reeves et nl. (1986) determined the levels of the wheat gliadin and 
ADPGlc PPase polypeptides, and of their respective mRNAs, using gliadin 
cDNAs and antibody to the spinach leaf ADPGlc PPase during wheat 
endosperm development. The mRNA contents for these proteins accumu- 
lated coordinately during endosperm development. Gliadin mRNA could 
be detected at 1% of the maximum level as early as 3 days after flowering 
(DAF). The mRNA levels for both the gliadins and ADPGlc PPase reached 
a maximum at about 14 DAF. Thereafter, the mRNA for the ADPGlc 
PPase decreased whereas the gliadin mRNAs decreased only after 18 DAF. 
The pyrophosphorylase enzyme increased to a maximum together with its 
mRNA until 14 to 18 DAF, and then decreased. In contrast, there seemed 
to be a delay in the expression of the gliadin proteins, and the maximum 
level was not reached until 31 DAF. Thus, there may be additional levels 
of control at the translational level since the gliadin proteins were not 
observed until several days after the appearance of the mRNA. Even though 
the mRNA levels of the ADPGic PPase and gliadins appear to be regulated 
in the same manner, at the translational or posttranslational levels there 
may be different regulation modes for the two protein families. 
The developmental pattern of the ADPGlc PPase gene was determined 
by Northern and dot blot hybridization analyses (Anderson ef al., 1991). 
The gene is transcribed at the highest level during early development, about 
5 to 7 DAF, attaining a level of about 0.2% of the total mRNA, which 
declines during the later periods of seed development. This pattern of 
transcription is consistent with the rate of starch accumulation, which is at 
its highest 7 to 9 DAF (Perez et af., 1975). 
The developmental expression of the gene encoding the potato 50-kDa 
subunit was studied, and the pattern of accumulation of the corresponding 
mRNA closely followed ADPGlc PPase activity. Thus, the gene appears 
to be regulated at the transcriptional level for the wheat. It is evident that 
the regulation of starch synthesis during development in wheat, rice seeds, 
and potato tuber is similar. There is a close correlation in the activity of 
ADPGlc PPase and the starch synthetic rate-results 
that are consistent 
with the view that gene expression regulates the rate of starch accumulation. 

SYNTHESIS OF THE GLUCOSYL DONOR 
73 
Thus, regulation of ADPGlc PPase, at both the transcriptional level and 
by allosteric control of the enzyme, modulates the rate of ADPglucose 
synthesis and starch synthesis. 
Northern blot analysis of mRNA isolated from potato leaf, stolon, and 
tuber against cDNA for the small subunit, indicated that the ADPGlc PPase 
gene is expressed in the tuber and leaf, but not in the stolon tissue. Thus, 
regulation at the transcriptional level during tuber development occurs in 
a tissue-specific manner (Anderson et al., 1990). The size of the mRNA 
transcripts are 1.8 kb, both in leaf and tuber, on the basis of Northern blot 
hybridization, suggesting that the same gene may be expressed in both 
tissues. Conversely, in rice (Krishnan et al., 1986) and wheat (Olive et al., 
1989), different genes seem to be encoding the same type of subunit ex- 
pressed in different parts of the plant (leaf or endosperm). Further analysis 
is needed to determine if the same or different genes are expressed in 
different tissues, and whether the situation is different for the large and 
small subunits and for different species. 
In this decade, several authors have reported evidence of changes in 
ADPGlc PPase and other starch and carbohydrate enzyme expressions 
brought about by increased availability of sugar (for review, see Koch, 
1996). The sugar-inducible enzymes (“feast genes”) can be phosphorylase 
(St. Pierre and Brisson, 1995), ADPGlc PPase (Muller-Rober et al., 1990; 
Krapp and Stitt, 1995), granule-bound starch synthase, branching enzyme 
(Kobmann et al., 1991), sucrose synthase (Sus 1) (Muller-Rober et al., 1990; 
Karrer and Rodriguez, 1992; Koch et al., 1995), invertase (Kobmann et al., 
1991), and sucrose-P synthase (Hesse et al., 1995). Examples include those 
found to be repressible (“famine genes” induced by sugar starvation or 
depletion), the a-amylase (Karrer and Rodriguez, 1992), and another 
sucrose synthase isozyme, sh 1 (Koch et al., 1992). 
X. GENOMIC DNA 
Treatment of the rice genomic DNA with EcoR1, BamH 1, and Hind 
I11 produced two or three bands of DNA fragments ranging from 3 to 
5 kb, which hybridized in Southern blots with the rice ADPGlc PPase 
cDNA. Based on the cDNA copy standards run on the same gel, it was 
concluded that there are about three gene copies per haploid genome, and 
the ADPGlc PPase genes are organized in a small family that could be 
divided into at least two groups on the basis of the restriction fragments 
obtained (Krishnan et al., 1986). 
Using the cDNA clone for the small subunit of the rice ADPGlc PPase 
(Krishnan et al., 1986) as a probe, the genomic DNA corresponding to the 

74 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
small subunit of ADPGlc PPase was isolated (Anderson et al., 1991) and 
its structure was determined by nucleotide sequencing. A comparison of the 
genomic nucleotide sequence with the isolated cDNA sequence revealed 
a complex gene structure with 10 exons and 9 introns in a size of about 
6 kb. The exon sizes are in a range of 99 to 293 base pairs (bp) and the in- 
tron sizes range from 84 to 1435 bp. The first intron was the largest, with 
1435 bp. The intron splice sites, with the exception of intron 2, contain GT/ 
AG borders and are similar to the splice site consensus sequences (Mount, 
1982; Brown, 1986). The intron-2 site did not follow the GT/AG rule 
(Breathnach and Chambon, 1981) but did show some similarity to the splice 
site consensus sequences. Thus it is possible, as suggested by Aebi el af. 
(1987). that the overall splice site sequence rather than the particular bases 
are necessary for correct splicing. The transcription start point is 30 bp 
downstream of the TATA box and the polyadenylation site was 188 bp 
downstream of the stop codon. The TATA or Hogness box is a nearly 
universal sequence. about 25 bp upstream from the transcription start site, 
reading TATAAAT, and is probably a site of binding for transcription 
factors. 
In Southern blot analysis, only nuclear DNA hybridized with the tuber 
cDNA corresponding to the potato tuber ADPGlc PPase small subunit, 
indicating that the gene encoding the enzyme is localized in the nucleus. 
It is estimated that there are one to two gene copies per haploid genome, 
and digestion of the potato nuclear DNA with the restriction enzymes 
EcoRl and Hind 111 yielded two or three hybridizable fragments totaling 
3.6 (EcoR1) or 6.7 kb (Hind 111) in size. The structure of a genomic clone 
encoding the analogous rice endosperm small subunit-specific gene has 
been determined and is almost 6.5 kb in size (Anderson er af., 1991). This 
rice endosperm gene is interrupted by 9 introns, indicating a structure that 
is more complex than that of most plant genes. The estimated length of 
the potato tuber small subunit PPase gene suggests that it may have a 
complex exonhntron structure, which is a complexity also observed in two 
other genes involved in starch metabolism-sucrose 
synthase (Werr er 
al., 1985) and the granule-bound starch synthase (from maize endosperm; 
Klosgen et al., 1986). which have 16 and 14 exons, respectively. The multiple 
introns present in the ADPGlc PPase, and other genes coding for enzymes 
of starch metabolism, may have a role in gene expression as in the case of 
the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Callis et al., 1987).

INTRODUCTION 
After the synthesis of the glucosyl donor by the ADPglucose pyrophos- 
phorylase (ADPGlc PPase), the next reaction in the starch biosynthetic 
pathway involves the transfer of the glucosyl moiety of the sugar nucleotide 
to a maltosaccharide, glycogen, or starch, forming a new a-1,4-glucosidic 
linkage. In this step, there are some differences between the bacterial 
and plant systems. In bacteria such as Escherichia coli, only one glycogen 
synthase, encoded by one glycogen synthase gene, has been found (Kumar 
et af., 1986). Conversely, in every plant tissue studied, more than one starch 
synthase has been identified (Preiss, 1982a,b, 1991; Preiss and Romeo, 1989; 
Sivak and Preiss, 1994; Preiss and Sivak, 1996) and they are encoded by 
more than just one gene. Some starch synthases are bound to the starch 
and can only be solubilized by a-amylase digestion of the granule, whereas 
others, designated as soluble starch synthases (SSS), are found in the soluble 
portion of the extract. 
The biochemical and molecular biology characterization of the multiple 
forms of starch lags behind that of the other enzymes in starch biosynthesis, 
a problem that can be attributed to the instability of some of the isoforms. 
11. 
SOLUBLE STARCH SYNTHASES 
Work with a variety of plant systems has shown that multiple forms of 
SSS are present. Studies on barley endosperm, pea seeds, wheat endosperm, 
sorghum seeds, teosinte seeds, spinach leaf, maize endosperm, potato tuber, 
and rice seed extracts have indicated the presence of at least two major 
forms of SSS (reviewed in Preiss and Levi, 1980; Preiss, 1988; Preiss and 
Sivak, 1996), designated as types I and 11. In maize leaf (Dang and Boyer, 
1988) and castor bean endosperm (Goldner and Beevers, 1989), only one 
form of starch synthase was found, but since no extensive purification 
was attempted, the possibility remained that existing multiforms were not 
separated. Indeed, Downton and Hawker (1973) did find two forms of 
starch synthase in maize leaf, and thus the issue of the number of forms 
15 

76 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
in maize leaf remains unresolved. It is important to note that Downton 
and Hawker (1973) found much greater activity in their extracts than that 
reported by Dang and Boyer (1988), and the possibility of incomplete 
extraction by the latter remains. 
In maize kernels, soluble starch synthase I (SSSI) elutes from anion 
exchange columns at lower salt concentrations than soluble starch synthase 
I1 (SSSII). Although SSSI has been partly purified from maize kernels, 
SSSII is more unstable and has been more difficult to purify. In our labora- 
tory, the use of several purification steps has resulted in enzymatic fractions 
with relatively high specific activities (2.6 and 4.2 pmol glucose incorporated 
per minute per mg protein for SSSI and SSSII, respectively), and these 
enzymatic fractions were free from amylases and branching enzyme. The 
apparent affinity for ADPglucose, measured by the K,, is similar for the 
two forms (Table I). The maximal velocity of the type I enzyme is greater 
with rabbit liver glycogen than with amylopectin, and the type I1 enzyme 
is less active with glycogen than with amylopectin. Citrate stimulation of 
the primed reaction is greater for type I than for type 11. Both forms can 
use the oligosaccharides maltose and maltotriose as primers when present 
at high concentrations. Starch synthase I seemed to have more activity than 
SSSII with these acceptors (Macdonald and Preiss, 1985). 
The lower activity for SSSI with amylopectin as a primer, as compared 
with glycogen, suggests that SSSI may have a higher preference for the 
short exterior chains (A-chains) that are more prevalent in glycogen than 
in amylopectin. The reverse may be true for SSSII, where SSSII may have 
preference for the longer A-chains and B-chains seen in amylopectin. Dif-

ferences were also noted in the apparent affinities with respect to the glucan 
primer. For example, the K, for the type I enzyme for amylopectin is nine 
times lower than that of the type I1 enzyme. It is worth noting that the 
type I enzyme is active without added primer in the presence of 0.5 M 
citrate, whereas the type I1 enzyme is inactive. Citrate decreases the K ,  
of amylopectin for both types of enzymes; 160-fold for the type I enzyme 
and about 16-fold for the type I1 starch synthase with 0.5 M citrate. SSSI 
and SSSII enzymes also have different molecular masses based on sucrose 
density ultracentrifugation: SSSI of maize endosperm is about 70 kDa and 
SSSII is 95 kDa, and they may be immunologically distinct. Antibody 
prepared against maize endosperm SSSI showed little reaction with SSSII 
in neutralization tests. In summary, the two soluble forms of maize starch 
synthase seem to be distinct on the basis of their physical, kinetic, and 
immunologic properties, and thus are probably products of two different 
genes. Because of their different kinetic properties and different specificities 
with respect to primer activities, they may have different functions in the 
formation of the starch granule (Macdonald and Preiss, 1985). The proper- 
ties listed in Table I for the maize isoenzymes are likely to represent the 
situation in other species and tissues. Both types of synthases can use the 
oligosaccharides-maltose and maltotriose-as 
primers at high concentra- 
tions. For maltose, the immediate new product was maltotriose; for maltotri- 
ose, the product was maltotetraose. Starch synthase I seemed to have more 
activity with the oligosaccharides than did the type I1 form. It is worth 
noting that for most (but not all) plant tissues, starch synthase I elutes 
from an anion exchange column at lower salt concentrations than starch 
synthase 11. 
Native type I and type I1 enzymes also have different molecular masses 
based on sucrose density ultracentrifugation (Hawker et al., 1974). 
It is possible to study the products formed by the action of the enzymes 
studied, and this is extremely useful for both starch synthase and branching 
enzyme. After incubation of the substrates with the enzyme, the product 
is isolated and debranched by the action of isoamylase (from Pseudornonas 
sp.), which hydrolyses the a-1,6 bonds but not the a-1,4 bonds, yielding 
relatively short linear chains. The chains obtained are characterized using 
high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC, with a Dio- 
nex CarboPac PAI, 250 X 4 mm column); maltodextrin chains with a DP 
of up to at least 40 units can be easily separated in less than 50 minutes 
using as eluting solvent a linear gradient in 150 mM NaOH of 0 to 
500 mM sodium acetate (Guan et al., 1995). Other useful methods include 
Smith degradation, measurement of the blue value (BV), determination of 
carbohydrates by the phenolsulfuric method (Takeda et al., 1983), and beta 
amylolysis limit.

MIRTA NOEMl SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
In rice. three isoforms of SSS were separated by anion exchange chroma- 
tography, which. in immunoblot, reacted with antibodies raised to the rice 
waxy protein (Baba et al., 1993). After affinity chromatography of the active 
fractions. amino-terminal sequences were obtained for the protein bands of 
55 to 57 kD (separated by SDS-PAGE) that cross-reacted weakly with serum 
raised against the rice waxy protein. It is worth noting that this experimental 
approach does not exclude the possibility that other soluble starch iso- 
form(s) were present that did not cross-react with the antiserum. and other 
results from Baba era[. (1993) indicate that another SSS isoform of 66 kDa 
is also present in seed extracts. The same authors isolated cDNA clones 
coding for the putative SSS from maize from an immature rice seed library 
in hgt 11, using as probes synthetic oligonucleotides designed on the basis 
of the amino-terminal amino acid sequences available. The longer insert, 
of about 2.5 kb. was sequenced and was shown to code for a 1878-nucleotide 
open reading frame. Comparison with the corresponding amino-terminal 
sequences led the authors to conclude that the protein is initially synthesized 
as a precursor carrying a long transit peptide at the amino-acid terminus 
and that the same gene would be expressed in both seeds and leaves. 
Ill. STARCH SYNTHASES BOUND TO THE STARCH GRANULE 
Attempts to elute or solubilize the activity had met with little success 
until Macdonald and Preiss (1983, 1985) incubated ground maize starch 
granules with a-amylase and glucoamylase. The solubilized starch synthase 
activity was chromatographed on an anion exchange column and two peaks 
of activity were obtained, with 80% of the activity residing with starch 
synthase I, which eluted from the DEAE-cellulose column at a lower salt 
concentration than the starch synthase I1 fraction. 
The solubilized, granule-bound enzymes showed apparent affinities for 
ADPGlc approximately ten times higher than those measured before solu- 
bilization (0.96 mM for the intact granule activity; F. D. Macdonald and 
J. Preiss, 1985). The granule-bound enzyme is also active with UDPglucose 
(Macdonald and Preiss, 1983); in the presence of 0.5 M citrate and amylo- 
pectin primer. the granule-bound activity with 1 mM UDPGlc exhibits 
about 7% of the activity seen with 1 mM ADPGlc. If the concentration of 
UDPGlc is raised to 20 mM, then the activity is about 73% of that of 
ADPGlc. Upon digestion of the granule with a-amylase and glucoamylase, 
the UDPGlc activity essentially disappears. Thus, either the appreciable 
activity observed with high concentrations of UDPGlc was not solubilized 
(which would suggest that the UDPGlc activity is catalyzed by a different 
enzyme than the ADPGlc activity) or was denatured during the amylase 

STARCH SYNTHASES 
79 
treatment, or the ability of the starch-bound starch synthase to use UDPGlc 
is dependent on the close association of the enzyme with the starch granule. 
Once solubilized, the granule-associated enzyme is specific for the sugar 
nucleotide, ADPGlc, and thus is similar to the SSS. 
Other properties of the granule-solubilized starch synthases are seen in 
Table I1 and can be compared with the SSS. The granule-bound enzymes 
freed of starch now require a primer for activity. The granule-bound starch 
synthase 11, in contrast to the SSSII, has a higher apparent affinity (lower 
K,) for amylopectin than the granule type I enzyme. This is opposite to 
the soluble enzyme forms. However, as seen for the SSSI, the granule- 
bound starch synthase I has a higher activity with rabbit liver glycogen 
than with amylopectin. The starch synthases 11, soluble or granule-bound, 
have less activity with rabbit liver glycogen than with amylopectin. The 
solubilized granule starch synthase I also has activity without added amylo- 
pectin in the presence of 0.5 M citrate, whereas the solubilized granule 
starch synthase I1 shows little activity in the presence of citrate and 
absence of primer. The solubilized granule starch synthases I and I1 can 
use oligosaccharide primers as do the soluble starch synthases; Table I1 
shows the activities with respect to maltose and maltotriose. Other maltosac- 
charides can be used as primers and the products of the reaction observed 
with maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltopentaose, maltohexaose, 
and maltononaose are the maltosaccharides with an additional glucosyl 
unit (e.g., the product with maltopentaose was maltohexaose). 
The molecular weight of the native enzymes can be determined in a 
number of ways, even in the presence of protein contaminants, by using 
sucrose density gradients or size exclusion chromatography. The major 
granule starch synthase, I, has a mass of 61,000, which is different than the

molecular mass of the soluble starch synthase I, which is 72,000. Both starch 
synthases 11, soluble or granule-bound, have similar mass; approximately 
93,000 (Macdonald and Preiss, 1985). 
Antibody prepared against SSSI effectively neutralized SSSI activity, but 
has little or no effect on either the activities of granule-bound starch syn- 
thases I or I1 or even on SSSII. A result consistent with that obtained with 
the SSS antiserum is the observation that antibody prepared against the 
starch granule-bound proteins effectively inhibits granule-bound starch syn- 
thase I activity. but has little effect on the SSS (Macdonald and Preiss, 1985). 
Classification of starch synthases is primarily based on work done on the 
maize endosperm enzymes, but work on other species supports, at least 
qualitatively, similar classifications. Thus, two broad categories of starch 
synthases can be defined depending on whether the enzymes are soluble 
or starch granule-bound. Within these categories, two classes of starch 
synthases I and I1 can be defined on the basis of their behavior on ion 
exchange and hydrophobic chromatography. In summary, type I elutes from 
DEAE-sepharose and aminobutyl-sepharose, at lower salt concentrations, 
have lower molecular masses, show higher activity with glycogen than with 
amylopectin, and show higher activities in the absence of primer with citrate 
or with amylopectin as primer and citrate when compared to the type I1 
class. The two classes are also immunologically distinct. The starch granule- 
bound enzymes can also be distinguished immunologically from their solu- 
ble starch synthase counterparts. There are also differences in their molecu- 
lar weights and in their kinetic properties. Synthesis of a starch granule 
has not been obtained in vitro. In vivo, synthesis occurs by deposition on the 
granule surface by the concerted action of starch synthases and branching 
enzyme. On centrifugation of a crude extract, starch synthase activity is 
found associated with the starch granules or in the supernatant. It is assumed 
that this partition is a result of differences in the structure of the isozymes 
and/or differences in the role they play in the synthesis of the starch compo- 
nents, amylose and amylopectin. Also, for storage organs such as seeds 
and tubers. the starch granule is formed and grows for several weeks, and 
it is likely that different isozymes vary in importance during this period. 
In maize endosperm there are at least four starch synthases: two soluble 
(Ozbun et af., 1971) and at least two granule-bound (Macdonald and Preiss, 
1985). The number of isoforms may vary with the plant species and the 
developmental stage, but those that have been studied more carefully seem 
to have a similar number of isoforms. Indeed, as in the case of the pea 
embryo, an isozyme of starch synthase-starch 
synthase 11-can 
exist as 
a soluble and starch-granule bound isozyme (Edwards et af., 1996). The 
question remains as to whether the soluble and granule-bound forms are 
both functional. Indeed, Mu-Forster et al. (1996) has reported that in maize 

STARCH SYNTHASES 
81 
endosperm, more than 85% of the starch synthase I protein may be associ- 
ated with the starch granule. This was determined by using an antibody 
prepared against the starch synthase, but no evidence was presented to 
indicate that the protein had starch synthase activity. 
The cDNA clones that encode the two isozymes of granule-bound starch 
synthase of the pea embryo are optimally expressed at different times 
during development (Dry et al., 1992); although isozyme I1 is expressed in 
every organ, isozyme I is not expressed in roots, stipules, or flowers (Dry 
et al., 1992). 
It is worth noting that the understanding of the starch synthases lags 
behind that of the ADPGlc PPase and the branching enzymes. To cover 
that ground, it will be necessary to achieve expression of the plant enzymes 
in E. coli so that studies of structure-function relationships can be facili- 
tated. 
IV. ISOLATION OF THE WAXY PROTEIN STRUCTURAL GENE 
Amylose content determines the degree of translucency of the endosperm 
(hence the name “waxy”), and it affects the cooking and eating qualities 
of the grains and the industrial properties of the starch extracted from 
those grains. 
Because of extensive genetic evidence, it is widely accepted that granule- 
bound starch synthase (GBSS) activity is a function of the protein coded 
by the waxy gene. The final product of the waxy locus is a protein of 
molecular weight 58,000 associated with the starch granule. This protein 
can be extracted by heating the starch with SDS or by incubating at 37°C 
with 9 M urea, but these methods are too drastic for the extraction of starch 
synthase activity. In mutants containing the wx alelle, there is virtually no 
amylose, GBSS activity is very low (Nelson and Rines, 1962; Tsai, 1974; 
Nelson et a[., 1978), and the waxy protein is missing. One of the two GBSS, 
partly purified from maize kernels (Macdonald and Preiss, 1983,1985), had 
a molecular weight as determined by sucrose density gradients of 60,000. 
Shure et al. (1983) prepared cDNA clones homologous to Wx mRNA. 
In subsequent experiments (Federoff er a[., 1983), restriction endonuclease 
fragments containing part of the Wx locus were cloned from strains carrying 
the ac wx-M9, wx-M9, and wx-M6 alleles to characterize further the control- 
ling insertion elements activator (ac) and dissociation (ds). Excision of the 
ds element from the certain wx alleles produces two new alleles (S5 and S9) 
that are encoding the wx proteins having altered starch synthase activities 
(Wessler et al., 1986). Two of these, S9 and S5, had 53 and 32% of the 
starch synthase activity, respectively, seen in the normal endosperm. Mutant 

82 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
S9, with higher starch synthase activity, had 36% of the amylose content 
observed in the nonmutant endosperm, whereas mutant S5, with an even 
lower starch synthase activity of 32%, had only 21% of the nonmutant maize 
amylose content. These data further support the view that the waxy protein 
is involved in amylose synthesis. 
The DNA sequence of the Waxy locus of Zea mays was determined by 
analysis of both a genomic and an almost full-length cDNA clone (Klosgen 
er al., 1986). and the Waxy locus from barley has been cloned and its DNA 
has been sequenced (Rohde etal., 1988). Figure 1 shows the deduced amino- 
acid sequences from the maize and barley clones and compares them with 
the amino-acid sequence for the E. coli ADPglucose-specific glycogen syn- 
thase (Kumar et al., 1986). Of interest is that 13 of the first 27 amino acids 
in the E. coli glycogen synthase are identical to the amino-acid sequences 
found in the plant enzymes. Moreover, for the three plant starch synthases, 
18 of the first 30 amino acids are identical and others may be considered 
homologous. The sequence starting at residue Lys 15 of the bacterial en- 
zyme, . . . KTGGL . . ., is particularly significant. The lysine in the bacte- 
rial glycogen synthase has been implicated in the binding of the substrate, 
ADPglucose (Furukawa et al., 1990), due to the chemical modification of 
that site by the substrate analogue. ADP-pyridoxal. The finding of similarity 
of sequences between the bacterial glycogen synthase and the putative 
plant starch synthases provides more and stronger suggestive evidence 
that the waxy gene is indeed the structural gene for the granule-bound 
starch synthase. 
The complete deduced amino-acid sequences of the open reading frames 
of the Waxy genes from maize and barley are known. About 75% identity 
can be seen in the sequence with respect to amino acids. If functionally 
similar amino acids are considered, then the homology is about 81%. Thus, 
these two proteins are similar in sequence and probably carry out the 
same function in the starch granule. There is, however, very little sequence 
homology with the bacterial glycogen synthase beyond the N-terminal se- 
quence. 
Genetically based evidence indicates that the protein product of the Wx 
gene. the waxy protein, is likely to be a GBSS, and biochemical evidence 
of the identity of the GBSS and the waxy protein has also been obtained 
(Sivak ef al., 1993). Starch-bound proteins from developing maize endo- 
sperm were solubilized by digesting the starch with amylases, fractionated 
by chromatography, and analyzed by electrophoresis and immunoblot (Si- 
vak et af., 1993). In maize endosperm, there are at least four starch synthases: 
two soluble (Ozbun et al., 1971) and two granule-bound (Macdonald and 
Preiss, 1985). The number of isoforms may vary with the plant species and 
the developmental stage, but those that have been studied more carefully

seem to have a similar number of isoforms. Purification of the starch syn- 
thase and branching enzymes in large amounts and to a high specific activity 
has proved to be difficult, and partly for this reason it has not been possible 
so far to determine how the enzymes interact to produce the two polysaccha- 
rides, amylose and amylopectin, that form the starch granule. Starch ex- 
tracted from developing pea embryos contained starch synthase activity 
that was associated with the waxy protein, and the molecular weight of the 
pea starch synthase is about 59,000, as determined by ultracentrifugation 
in sucrose density gradients. A pea GBSS preparation displayed a relatively 
high specific activity (more than 10 pmol glucose incorporated per minute 
per mg protein). When this enzymatic fraction was subjected to SDS poly- 
acrylamide gel electrophoresis and was followed either by protein staining 
or immunoblot, only the Wx protein was visible (Sivak et al., 1993). 
Thus, the biochemical examination of starch synthase present in starch 
granules from two species, maize and pea, strengthens the genetic evidence 
supporting the role of the Wx protein as a GBSS with a major role in the 
determination of the amylose content of starch. It is still not clear, however, 
how the loss of starch synthase present in the starch granule causes the 
disappearane of amylose. It is possible that the interior of the granule is 
devoid of branching enzyme or, if branching enzyme is in the granule itself, 
it is not appreciably active. The presence of an active, chain-elongating 
enzyme (i.e., starch synthase), without an active branching enzyme present 
(in the presence or absence of some debranching activity), could lead to 
amylose formation. For a discussion of how the primer is formed, see the 
chapter, “Open Questions and Hypotheses in Starch.” 
The starch synthase isozymes in maize endosperm have different molecu- 
lar masses. The GBSS isozyme I has a molecular mass of 60,000; GBSSII 
is 95,000. The SSSI has a molecular mass of 72,000, and SSSII is 95,000. 
Mu et ~ l .  
(1994) have reported the molecular mass of maize endosperm 
SSSI as 76,000, which is similar to the value reported previously for SSSI 
(reviewed in Sivak and Preiss, 1994; Preiss and Sivak, 1996). These molecu- 
lar mass values for the starch synthases are all higher than that of the 
E. cofi glycogen synthase with a molecular weight of 52,000 (Kumar et 
al., 1986). 
There is a report that in pea embryo, some of the SSSs may also be 
bound to the starch granule (Denyer et al., 1993) and that in maize endo- 
sperm, some of SSSI adheres to the starch granule (Mu et af., 1994). The 
conclusions in the pea embryo study (Denyer et al., 1993) are based on 
positive immunoblots obtained after electrophoresis of the SSS with anti- 
body prepared against the GBSS, and also on the similarity of the amino- 
acid sequence of three peptides obtained from protease SV8 digests of the 
SSS. This clearly shows there is a close relationship between SSSII and 
GBSSII, but does not indicate that they are identical proteins. It is also 

STARCH SYNTHASES 
85 
not clear how much of the SSSII activity is present as granule-bound activity 
and how much is soluble activity. It is also not surprising that some of the 
SSSII is present as starch-granule-bound, as SSSII does have an affinity 
for its substrate, starch. 
The evidence for the maize study rests on the ,observation of a positive 
immunoblot with antibody prepared against a 76 kDa protein obtained 
from the starch granule with the SSSI on electrophoresis; the antibody also 
neutralized the SSSI activity. Since SSSI has affinity for the granule, one 
would expect to have some of the SSSI protein bound to the granule, and 
the question is how much is bound and whether the binding is similar to 
the binding of the GBSS to the starch granule. There is no question that 
in maize, the GBSSI is immunologically distinct from the SSSI (reviewed 
in Sivak and Preiss, 1995; Preiss and Sivak, 1996). 
The amino-acid sequences of the bacterial glycogen synthase and the 
plant starch synthases have been compared (Fig. 1). There are three regions 
of high conservation and at least one of them is involved in binding the 
substrate, ADPglucose (Furukawa et al., 1990, 1993). This region (region 
I) is at the N-terminal. The possible functions for regions I1 and 111 are 
not known. However, the high degree of conservation of amino acids in 
region I1 (only one or two amino acids, at most, differ from those in the 
sequence of glycogen synthase of E. coli) suggesting that this is likely to 
be an important site. In region 111, all the GBSSs are identical with respect 
to the amino-acid sequence, whereas the E. coli sequence differs in only 
two of the nine amino acids: Arg for Ser and Ala for Val. The SSS has 
Gly for that Ser and an Arg residue instead of Val. In addition, Lys residue 
277 of the E. coli glycogen synthase is also involved in catalysis (Furukawa 
et al., 1994) and is also conserved in the GBSS and SSS. Many questions 
remain with respect to protein-structure-function relationships among the 
three types of a-1,4 glucan synthases and the primer binding site and amino- 
acid residues involved in catalysis. In rice seed, there is no question that 
the SSSs are different than the granule-bound starch synthases in that there 
are only 29 to 37% identities with the rice GBSSs (Baba et al., 1993). 
Thus far, the only a-1,4 glucan synthase reported to be overexpressed 
with high activity is the E. coli enzyme. This system should be further 
exploited with respect to the methodologies of chemical modification, site- 
directed mutagenesis, and attempts to determine its three-dimensional 
structure. 
V. 
STUDIES OF Chlamydomonas reinhardtii MUTANTS 
It is to be expected that different enzymes must have different functions 
in the synthesis of the starch components, amylose and amylopectin, 

86 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
and this is what the work with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii of Ball and 
his collaborators (1991) indicates (Delrue et al., 1992; Fontaine et al., 
1993; Maddelein er al., 1994). These authors showed that SSSII may be 
involved in the synthesis of the intermediate sized chains of amylopec- 
tin (Fontaine et al., 1993) and that GBSS is not only involved in amy- 
lose synthesis. but also in amylopectin synthesis (Maddelein et al., 1994). 
The process to follow is to separate the various granule-bound and sol- 
uble starch synthases from each other and to examine their properties. 
The properties that must be studied are their specificities (their chain- 
lengthening properties), to what chains they prefer to transfer glucosyl 
residues (the A-, B1-, B2-. B3-, or B4-chains of amylopectin; Hizukuri, 
1986). as well as the optimal length of glucosyl residues they can synthesize 
efficiently. Amylose synthesis depends on the concentration of ADPGlc, 
as GBSS has a high K, for the substrate as compared to the soluble 
starch synthases (Van den Koornhuyse er al., 1996). The phosphogluco- 
mutase (PGM)-deficient mutants can make amylopectin but not amylose, 
as shown by detailed structure studies of the starch accumulated by 
the algae (Libessart et al., 1995), even though the algae have GBSS. 
A similar structure effect can be seen when the algae have defective 
ADPGlc PPase (Van den Koornhuyse et al., 1996). 
Ball and associates (1991) have isolated various mutants of Chlumydomo- 
nus that are deficient in starch synthase activities. These are a GBSS- 
deficient mutant (Delrue et al., 1992), an SSSII-deficient mutant (Fontaine 
er al., 1993), and a double mutant-that 
is, a mutant deficient both in GBSS 
and in SSSII (Maddelein ef al., 1994). The SSSII mutant had only 20 to 
40% of the wild-type starch content, and the amylose fraction of the starch 
increased from 25 to 55%. This mutant also had a modified amylopectin 
with an increased amount of short chains of DP 2 to 7, and a decrease of 
intermediate size chains of DP 8 to 60. This suggests that the SSSII is 
involved in the synthesis or maintenance of the intermediate size chains 
(mainly B-chains) in amylopectin. The higher amylose content could be 
explained because of the failure of the SSSII mutant to make extended 
chains. 
The double mutants, defective in SSSII and GBSS (Maddelein ef al., 
1994). had a starch content of only 2 to 16% of the wild-type. The severity 
of the GBSS defect of the double mutant dictated the amount of starch 
present in the double mutant, with an almost null mutant having little 
starch. The authors suggest that GBSS is important for synthesis of the 
internal structure of the amylopectin, and the effect of GBSS deficiency is 
worsened by the diminished SSSII activity. 

STARCH SYNTHASES 
87 
These studies, using Chlamydomonas mutants, provide evidence for the 
involvement of the GBSS, not only in amylose, but also in amylopectin 
synthesis, and suggest that a function for SSSII is in the synthesis of the 
intermediate size B-branch chains in amylopectin.

BRANCHING ENZYMES 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The third reaction in the starch biosynthetic pathway is catalyzed by the 
1,4-a-~-glucan: l-Ca-~-glucan 6-glycosyl-transferase (branching enzyme, 
BE; E.C. 2.4.1.18), responsible for the synthesis of the (w-1,6 linkages found 
in amylopectin and in glycogen. In E. coli or other bacteria, only one 
branching enzyme and one gene are present, whereas in plants, genetic 
and biochemical evidence indicates there can be two or more forms of 
branching enzyme. The challenge is to identify the role of each multiform 
in the synthesis of the complex structure of starch and to understand how 
differences in enzyme structure determine the specificities in acceptor and 
branching modes. As usual with plant enzymes, this task is made more 
difficult by the presence of proteases in crude extracts, and also by the fact 
that proteolyzed enzymes can still have activity even when their specific 
properties have been altered in an irreversible manner. 
II. ASSAY 
Several assays (Fig. 1) are available to measure branching enzyme activ- 
ity. The iodine assay is based on the decrease in absorbance of the glucan- 
iodine complex (Krisman, 1962) resulting from the branching of amylose 
or amylopectin by the enzyme, provided that a-amylases are absent from 
the enzyme preparation or their activity is greatly reduced by adjusting the 
assay conditions. 
The phosphorylase-stimulation assay (Hawker et al., 1974) is based on 
the stimulation of the “unprimed” (without added glucan) phosphorylase 
activity (Fig. 2) of the phosphorylase from a rabbit muscle, as the branching 
enzyme present in the assay mixture increases the number of nonreducing 
ends available to the phosphorylase for elongation. It was made more 
sensitive by using I4C-labeled glucose-1-P and measuring its incorporation 
into starch, rather than by measuring the formation of Pi.

The new branching-linkage assay ("BL assay"; Takeda et al., 1993) is 
the only one that measures the number of events catalyzed by the branching 
enzyme (rather than an indirect effect of its action as in the two assays 
described in the preceding) (Fig. 3). The enzyme fraction is incubated with 
the substrate, NaBH4-reduced amylose, the reaction is then stopped by 
boiling, and the product is then incubated with Pseudomonas isoamylase 
for debranching. Finally, the reducing power of the oligosaccharide chains 
transferred by the enzyme is measured. Reduced amylose is used as the 
substrate to eliminate or minimize the reducing power of the amylose itself.

The branching-linkage assay is the most quantitative assay for the 
branching enzyme, but amylolytic activity interferes most with this assay; 
the phosphorylase-stimulation assay is the most sensitive and the iodine 
assay is not very sensitive but allows the testing of branching enzyme 
specificity with various a-1 ,Cdextrins, providing information on the possible 
role of the different branching enzyme isoforms. For complete characteriza- 
tion, it may be best to employ all three assays when studying the properties 
of the branching enzymes. Above all, however, if reliable information is 
being sought, the branching enzymes must be purified to the extent that 
all starch degradative enzymes are eliminated before studying the properties 
of branching enzymes. 
I l l .  
PURIFICATION OF BRANCHING ENZYME MULTIFORMS 
Multiple forms of branching enzyme have been found in many plants, 
for example, spinach leaf, maize endosperm, maize leaf (Dang and Boyer, 
1988), castor bean (Goldner and Beevers, 1989), developing seeds of pea 
and sorghum, and teosinte seeds (for reviews see Preiss, 1988). Smyth 
(1988) resolved two or three peaks of Indica rice starch-branching enzyme 
on an anion-exchange column. The properties of these fractions are similar 
to those reported for other plants, except that their molecular weights were 
determined to be only 40,000. 
In maize endosperm, there are three BE isoforms (Singh and Preiss, 
1985; Guan and Preiss, 1993), and reports on other tissues are consistent 
with the presence of more than one isoform. A procedure described by 
Boyer and Preiss (1978a,b) and by Singh and Preiss (1985), which resulted 
in enzyme fractions with high specific activity but with traces of amylases, 
was further improved in our laboratory (Guan and Preiss, 1993). The purifi- 
cation steps involve homogenization, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and 
chromatography on DEAE-sepharose (“fast-flow”), in which the three 
isoforms are first separated. BE1 is further purified by chromatography on o- 
aminodecyl agarose, and by FPLC using MonoQ and Superose 12. Further 
purification of both BEIIa and BEIIb requires chromatography on o- 
aminooctyl agarose and MonoQ. The resulting preparation of BEIIa re- 
quires chromatography on BioGel P10 to remove contaminating carbohy- 
drate. Monoclonal antibodies were prepared against BE1 and a mixture of 
BEs IIa and IIb. Singh and Preiss (1985) concluded that although some 
homology exists among the three starch BEs, there are major differences 
in the structure of BE1 when compared with BEIIa and BEIIb, as shown 
by its different reactivity with some monoclonal antibodies, and there are 
differences in amino-acid composition and in proteolytic digest maps. It 

BRANCHING ENZYMES 
93 
was also concluded (Singh and Preiss, 1985) that BEs IIa and IIb are similar 
and possibly are the products of the same gene. Further evidence (Fisher 
et al., l993,1996a), however, suggests that BEIIa and BEIIb may, after all, 
be products of two different genes (see the later section, “How Many Genes 
for Three Maize-Branching Enzymes?”). 
Because of the difficulties involved in separating the isoenzymes among 
themselves and from other enzymes such as amylases, it is not yet clear 
what the best acceptors are and what the products are for each isoenzyme, 
but some characterization of the enzymes has been done (e.g., K, for a- 
glucans such as amylopectin, different animal glycogens, and maltosaccha- 
rides). Characterization of the products has been minimal, but some prog- 
ress has been made in our laboratory (see the next section, “Mode of 
Action”). 
In potato tubers, Vos-Scheperkeuter ef al. (1989) purified a single form 
of branching activity of molecular mass 79,000, confirming the previous 
work of Borovsky ef al. (1975). Antibodies were prepared to the native 
potato enzyme and it was found they reacted strongly only with maize 
enzyme I and weakly with IIb. In neutralization tests, they inhibited the 
activities of both the potato tuber-branching enzyme and of maize- 
branching enzyme I. Antibodies prepared against denatured potato- 
branching enzyme reacted with all forms of denatured maize- and potato- 
branching enzyme in immunoblots, but not with the native enzyme forms. 
It was concluded that the potato-branching enzyme shows a high degree 
of similarity to the maize-branching enzyme form I and, to a lesser extent, 
to the other forms of maize-branching enzyme. 
IV. MODE OF ACTION 
Some subtle differences among BE1 and BE11 of maize, in the K ,  for 
several primers, and their response to citrate have been described (see 
Preiss, 1991). More recently, Takeda et al. (1993) have analyzed the 
branched products made from amylose by each BE isoform. This was done 
by debranching the products of each isoform using isoamylase, followed 
by gel filtration. 
BEIIa and BEIIb are similar in their affinity for amylose and the proper- 
ties of the products (Tables I and 11). When presented with amyloses of 
different average chain lengths, all the BEs have higher activity with the 
longer chain amylose. BE1 can still catalyze the branching of an amylose 
of average chain length (c.1.) of 197 with 89% of the activity shown for the 
c.1. 405. The activity of BE11 drops sharply with a reduction in c.1. The 
action of BEIIa and BEIIb results in the transfer of chains shorter than

For this experiment, it is not essential to use enzyme purified to homogeneity, 
hence the relatively low specific activities. The enzymatic fraction, however, must 
be free of amylases or contaminating branching activities.

studied by Guan and Preiss (1993). Of the three isoforms, BE1 had the 
highest activity in branching amylose and its rate of branching amylopectin

"The substrates. either 1 mg/ml amylose (c.1. 405) or amylopectin (c.1. 21), were incubated 
with 5 units/ml maize-branchingenzyme (measured as by stimulation of phosphorylase u; Guan 
and Preiss. 1993). The decrease in absorbance by the iodinelglucan complex was measured at 
660 nm.

was less than 5% of that for amylose. In contrast, the BEIIa and BEIIb 
isoforms branched amylopectin at twice the rate they branched amylose, 
and catalyzed branching of amylopectin at six times the rate observed for 
BEI. The assay used was iodine staining (Boyer and Preiss, 1978a,b). These 
results are consistent with those of Takeda et al. (1993) in suggesting that 
BE1 catalyzes the transfer of longer branched chains and that BEIIa and 
IIb catalyze the transfer of shorter chains. Thus, it is possible that BE1 may 
produce lightly branched polysaccharides, which then serve as substrates 
for enzyme complexes of branching enzyme I1 isoforms and starch synthases 
to synthesize amylopectin. Branching enzyme I1 isoforms may play a ma- 
jor role in forming the short chains present in amylopectin (Guan and 
Preiss, 1993). 
The study of the reaction products showed that the action of BEIIa and 
BEIIb resulted in the transfer of chains shorter than those transferred by 
BEI. The action of the isoforms on amylopectin has been studied by Guan 
and Preiss (1993) and, of the three isoforms. BE1 had the highest activity 
(using the iodine assay) on amylose, and its rate of branching amylopectin 
was less than 5% of that with amylose. In contrast, the BEIIa and BEIIb 
isoforms branched amylopectin at twice the rate of amylose, and catalyzed 
the branching of amylopectin at six times the rate observed for BEI. In 
short, the experimental evidence suggests that BE1 may be more involved 
in producing the more interior (B-) chains of the amylopectin, whereas 
BEIIa and BEIIb would be involved in forming the exterior (A-) chains. 
V. 
HOW MANY GENES FOR THREE 
MAIZE-BRANCHING ENZYMES? 
In neutralization tests, antibody raised against form I inhibits BE1 
but not BEIIa or BEIIb, and antibody prepared against IIa and IIb in- 
hibits IIa and IIb but not BEI, confirming earlier reports by Fisher and 
Boyer (1983). However, when an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay 
(ELISA) was used, some reaction of BEIIa and BEIIb was detected when 
using antiserum raised against BE1 (Singh and Preiss, 1985). The antisera 
prepared with IIa and IIb, however, reacted only to a very small extent 
with BEI. This was also observed in using purified monoclonal antibodies 
raised against BEIIa and BEIIb (Singh and Preiss, 1985). Three monoclonal 
antibodies could react with all three branching enzymes in the ELISA 
assay, whereas three other lines produced monoclonal antibodies specific 
for forms IIa or IIb (Fig. 4). Neutralization of enzyme activity of all three 
branching enzymes was seen with the antibody that reacted with all three 
in the ELISA test, whereas the monoclonal antibody that reacted with only

IIa and IIb inhibited their activities in neutralization tests but did not inhibit 
enzyme I activity. 
Amino-acid composition studies also indicate major differences between 
BE1 and the other two forms, whereas only minor differences are observed 
between IIa and IIb (Singh and Preiss, 1985). High-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) patterns of a BE1 peptide digest (whether trypsin 
or chymotrypsin were used) are very different in both the number of 
peptides and their retention times than those obtained with BEIIa or BEIIb 
digests. The digest patterns produced by trypsin are shown in Fig. 5. In 
contrast, no differences in HPLC are observed between the peptide maps 
of BEIIa and BEIIb forms using either trypsin (Fig. 5) or chymotrypsin 
(Singh and Preiss, 1985). It was concluded that some homology exists among 
the three starch-branching enzymes, but major differences exist between

the structure of branching enzyme I when compared to the pair IIa and 
IIb, as shown by the absence of reaction with some monoclonal antibodies, 
differences in amino acid composition, and differences in their proteolytic 
digest maps. There were significant differences between BE1 and the pair 
BEIIa and BEIIb, but these two are similar in their reactions to polyclonal 
and monoclonal antibodies, molecular weight, K,,, for substrates, and so 
on. In maize endosperm (Fisher et al., 1993; Guan et al., 1994a,b) and in 
rice seed (Mizuno et al., 1992, 1993; Nakamura and Yamanouchi, 1992), 
two different cDNAs were isolated encoding two branching enzyme iso- 
zymes, BE1 and BEII. 
Results obtained with the maize endosperm mutant, amylose extender 
(ae), suggested that Ae was the structural gene for either BEII or BEIIb 
(Boyer and Preiss, 1978b, 1981; Preiss and Boyer, 1980). BE1 levels were 

98 
MlRTA NOEMI SIVAK A N D  JACK PREISS 
not affected. In gene dosage experiments, Hedman and Boyer (1982) 
showed that there is a nearly linear relationship between increasing the 
dosage of the dominant Ae allele and BEIIb activity. Since the separation 
of form IIa from IIb was not optimal, it was still possible that the Ae locus 
was also affecting the level of Ha. 
In short. the evidence accumulated by 1982 suggested that only two genes 
were coding for branching enzymes, and that the slight differences between 
BEIIa and BEIIb could be attributed to posttranscriptional processing. 
However, on the basis of the analysis of 16 isogenic lines that have indepen- 
dent alleles of the maize amylose extender (ae) locus, Fisher et al. (1996a) 
suggested that BEIIa and BEIIb are encoded by separate genes; the BEIIb 
enzyme would be encoded by the Ae gene. They isolated a cDNA clone 
labeled Sbe 2b with a predicted amino-acid sequence between residues 58 
and 65 as the N-terminal sequence of the maize BEIIb that they had purified 
(Fisher rt al., 1996a,b). Moreover, they could not detect any mRNA in ae 
endosperm extracts using the Sbe 2b cDNA clone. Some BE activity that 
chromatographed as BEIIa was detected in the ae extracts. Although the 
results of Fisher et al. are suggestive, it remains to be shown that the activity 
they labeled as BEIIa in the ae mutant is the same as what has been termed 
as BEIIa in wild-type maize. It is possible that the residual enzyme activity 
seen in the cie mutant is another BE isozyme, additional to the BE11 iso- 
zymes studied previously, especially because the maize lines Fisher and his 
collaborators used are of different genetic background from those used in 
the classic studies. 
VI. OTHER SPECIES 
In potato tubers. Vos-Scheperkeuter et d. 
(1989) purified a single form 
of branching activity of molecular mass 79.000. Antibodies to the native 
potato enzyme were prepared and the enzyme was found to react strongly 
only with maize BE1 and very weakly with BEIIb. In neutralization tests, 
the enzyme inhibited the activities of both the potato tuber BE and 
of maize BEI. It was concluded that the potato BE shows a high de- 
gree of similarity to the maize BE1 and, to a lesser extent, to the other 
maize BE. 
However. whether potato tubers have two isoforms of BE had not 
been resolved. Borovsky et al. (1975) isolated from potato tubers a BE of 
molecular mass 85.000. This is close to the mass of 79.000 found by Vos- 
Scheperkeuter et al. (1989). It has been claimed that a BE of molecular 
mass 97.000 and 103,000 can be isolated (Blennow and Johansson, 1991; 
Khoshnoodi et al., 1993). It is still not resolved whether the previous lower 

BRANCHING ENZYMES 
99 
molecular mass values of 79,000 and 85,000 are the results of proteolysis 
during purification of the 103,000 BE or whether these proteins could be 
the products of different allelic forms of the BE gene or different BE genes. 
It is of interest to note that BEs isolated from other plants, bacteria, or 
mammals have molecular masses ranging from 75,000 to approximately 
85,000. These molecular masses have been consistent with the molecular 
weights obtained from deduced amino-acid sequences obtained from iso- 
lated genes or cDNA clones. 
In potato and cassava, there is no clear evidence yet for the existence 
of more than one isoform. Antisense experiments in potato tuber did not 
eliminate BE activity completely. If there were two genes coding for en- 
zymes, antisense neutralization if one of them would not affect the expres- 
sion of the other. However, this result is inconclusive because antisense 
experiments usually decrease the amounts of the protein encoded but do 
not reduce it to zero. Purification and characterization of the remaining 
activity in antisense experiments could resolve the matter, but was not done 
in this particular case. 
Smyth (1988), using Indica rice, resolved two or three peaks of BE on 
an anion-exchange chromatography. Although the molecular weight of the 
BE seemed to be only about 40,000, activity was determined using the 
iodine assay and a crude extract, and amylase contamination or possible 
proteolysis apparently were not taken into account. 
Mizuno et al. (1992) has reported four forms of BE from immature rice 
seeds that were separated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose chro- 
matography. It seems that two of the forms, BE1 and BE2 (composed 
of BE2a and BE2b) were the major forms, whereas BE3 and BE4 were mi- 
nor forms comprising less than 10% of the total BE activity. The molec- 
ular weight of the BEs were: BE1, 82,000; BE2a, 85,000; BE2b, 82,000; 
BE3, 87,000; BE4a, 93,000; and BE4b, 83,000. However, BE1, 2a, and b 
seem to be immunologically similar in their reaction to maize endosperm 
BE1 antibody. Moreover, the rice seed BE1, BE2a, and BE2b had similar 
N-terminal amino acid sequences. All three BEs had two N-terminal se- 
quences, TMVXVVEEVDHLPIT and VXVVEEVDHLPITDL. The latter 
sequence is similar to the first sequence, lacking just the first two N-terminal 
amino acids. Thus, although these activities came out in separate fractions 
from the DEAE-cellulose column, they seem to be the same protein on 
the basis of immunology and N-terminal sequences. BE2a, however, was 
3 kDa larger. The antibody against BE3 reacted strongly against BE3 but 
not toward BE1 and 2a, 2b. Thus, rice endosperm, as noted for maize 
endosperm, had essentially two different isoforms of BE. 
Because of the many isoforms existing for the rice seed branching en- 
zymes. Yamanouchi and Nakamura (1992) studied and compared the BEs 

100 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
from rice endosperm, leaf blade, leaf sheath, culm, and root. The BE activity 
could be resolved into two fractions, BE1 and BE2, and both fractions 
were found in all tissues studied in different ratios of activity. The specific 
activity of the endosperm activity, either on the basis of fresh weight or 
protein, was 100- to 1000-fold greater than other tissues studied. On native 
gel electrophoresis, rice endosperm BE2 could be resolved into two frac- 
tions: BE2a and BE2b. Of interest was the fact that for electrophoresis of 
the other tissue BE2 forms, only BE2b was found. BE2a was only detected 
in the endosperm tissue. It appears that in rice there could be tissue-specific 
isoforms of BE. 
Fisher et al. (1996b) were able to isolate two cDNAs from an Arabidopsis 
thaliana hypocotyl library that seemed to be those coding for BEIIa and 
BEIlb. The two cDNAs had diverged 5' and 3' ends, but the amino-acid 
sequences encoded by them were 90% identical. The two cDNAs hybridized 
to transcripts that showed similar expression patterns in the vegetative and 
reproductive tissues. 
A pea variety with wrinkled seeds has a reduced starch level, about 
66-7596 of that seen in the round seed: also, the amylose content is about 
33% in the round form, but is much higher (60-70%) in the wrinkled pea 
seed. Edwards et al. (1988) measured the activities of several enzymes 
involved in starch metabolism in wrinkled peas at four different develop- 
mental stages and found that BE activity was, at its highest, only 14% of 
that seen for the round seed, The activities of other starch biosynthetic 
enzymes and phosphorylase were similar in the wrinkled and round seeds. 
These results were confirmed by Smith (1988), who also showed that the 
rfrugosus) lesion (as found in the wrinkled pea of genotype rr) was associ- 
ated with the absence of one isoform of branching enzyme. Edwards et al. 
(1988) proposed that the reduction in starch content observed in the mutant 
seeds is caused indirectly by the reduction in BE activity through an effect 
on the starch synthase, suggesting that, in the absence of branching enzyme 
activity. the starch synthase activity is not optimal in a-l-+4-glucan synthe- 
sis. Indeed, in a study of rabbit muscle glycogen synthase (Carter and Smith, 
1978) it was found that prolonged elongation of the outer chains of glycogen 
caused it to become an ineffective primer, thus decreasing the apparent 
affinity of the glycogen synthase for the primer. It was also found that the 
concentration of ADPglucose was higher in the wrinkled pea than in the 
normal pea, suggesting that activity of the starch synthase was restricted 
in vivo. Under optimal in vitro conditions, in which a suitable primer such 
as amylopectin or glycogen is added, starch synthase activity in the wrinkled 
pea was equivalent to that found in the wild type. 
The r locus of the pea seed was cloned using an antibody toward one of 
the pea-branching enzyme isoforms and screening a cDNA library (Bhatta- 

BRANCHING ENZYMES

charyya et al., 1990). It appears that the branching enzyme gene in the 
wrinkled pea contains an 800-bp insertion, causing it to express an inactive 
branching enzyme. The sequence of the 2.7-kb clone showed more than a 
50% homology to the glycogen-branching enzyme of E. coli (Baecker et 
al., 1986), and the authors concluded that the cDNA that they had cloned 
corresponded to the starch-branching enzyme gene of the pea seed. 
VII. 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION 
After purifying and characterizing the enzymes and cloning the genes, 
the next step is to understand the relationship between the structure of 
the branching enzymes and catalysis-in 
other words, the way in which 
variations in protein structure affect the substrate preference, the length 
of the branches formed, and the pattern of branching. This knowledge 
would obviously facilitate the manipulation of the branching enzyme gene 
to obtain the desired change in enzyme function. Subsequent transforma- 
tion of the altered gene into plants would result in starch granules with 
altered structure and physical properties that could be used by the starch 
industry with positive economic effects. 
In addition to the studies discussed in the preceding (e.g., the size of the 
chains transferred by the maize endosperm BE to form the a-1,6 linkages), 
no studies have been conducted with respect to identifying amino-acid 
residues involved in catalysis. However, amino-acid sequences deduced for 
the branching enzymes from several bacterial genes, and for many plant 
BE isozymes (from the cDNA clones), show high identity, leading to some 
information on possible amino-acid sequences that may be important for 
catalysis. It is of interest that the glycogen-branching enzyme from the 
photosynthetic cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. PCC7942, has been 
cloned (Kiel et al., 1989) by using the glgB gene from E. coli (Baecker et 
al., 1986) as a hybridization probe. The sequence for the cyanobacterial 
glgB gene was determined (Kiel et al., 1990) and its deduced amino-acid 
sequence has extensive similarity to the amino-acid sequence (62% identical 
amino acids) in the middle area of the E. coli protein. It appears, therefore, 
that branching enzymes in nature have extensive homology, whether their 
specificity is for high branching, as observed in glycogen (-10% a-1,6 
linkages), or a lower degree of branching, as that seen in amylopectin (-5% 
a-1,6 linkages). 
Sequence comparisons done by a number of groups, most notably by 
Svensson and her colleagues (Svensson, 1994), indicate that the various 
starch- and glycogen-branching enzymes contain consensus sequences to 
the four regions that are postulated to be the catalytic regions of the a- 

102 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
amylase family of enzymes. This family includes pullulanase, isoamylase, 
glucosyl transferase, and cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (Fig. 6). The four 
regions are in the central portion of the amino-acid sequences of these en- 
zymes. 
The conservation of the putative catalytic sites of the a-amylase family 
in the starch- and glycogen-branching enzymes should be no surprise, as 
BE catalyzes two consecutive reactions for the synthesis of a-1,6 
glucosidic 
linkages: cleavage of a-l,4 glucosidic linkages and then transfer to C-6 
hydroxyl groups of a glucose residue in the growing polysaccharide. These 
reactions are probably similar to those catalyzed by the other a-amylase 
family enzymes. namely cleavage and transfer to another glucose residue 
or to water. 
Some of the eight highly conserved amino-acid residues of the a-amylase 
family may also be functional in branching enzyme catalysis. Research using

FIG. 6. Primary structures of several branching enzymes compared with the four conserved 
regions of the a-amylase family. The sequences have been derived from references cited in 
this text and in Svensson (1994). Four types of enzymes from the amylase family are compared 
with the branching enzymes. Svensson (1994) compared more than 40 enzymes ranging from 
amylases, glucosidases, several a-1,6-debrauching enzymes, and four branching enzymes. The 
conserved amino-acid residues are in bold letters. 

BRANCHING ENZYMES

site-directed mutagenesis (Kuriki et al., 1996) suggests that the conserved 
Asp residues of regions I1 and IV and the Glu residue of region I11 are 
important for BE activity. Their exact functions are unknown, and fur- 
ther experiments, such as chemical modification and analysis of the three- 
dimensional structure of BE, are required for determination of their role 
as catalytic residues and for detailing the mechanism of reaction. Other 
studies with phenylglyoxal, a reagent for modification of Arg residues, have 
shown that the maize endosperm BEs can be inactivated (Cao and Preiss, 
1996). The phenylglyoxal inactivation can be prevented by the addition of 
amylose to the modification reaction mixture. Thus, arginine residues in 
BE may be involved in the binding of the substrate or in catalysis. Similarly, 
diethyl pyrocarbonate, a reagent specific for histidine residues, also inacti- 
vates maize BE activity, and this inactivation can also be prevented by the 
presence of amylose (Funane and Preiss, unpublished experiments, 1996). 
It should also be noted that the amino-acid sequences at the N- and C- 
termini of the various BEs are dissimilar; these regions may be important 
with respect to substrate specificity as well as to the sue of chain transferred 
and to the extent of branching. 
Kuriki et al. (1997) described the construction of chimeric enzymes made 
from the maize branching-enzymes. The maize branching-enzymes differ 
in specificity of substrate and pattern of branching of the substrate. Compar- 
ing the amino-acid sequences BE1 and mBEII of maize, the identity is 58%, 
with the identity higher (67%) in the central portion of the enzymes, which 
contains the regions I-IV highly conserved in the a-amylase family (Baba 
et al., 1991; Takata et aL, 1992; Jespersen et al., 1993; Guan et al., 1994b). 
When amino-acid residues with similar functional side chains are taken 
into consideration, the two enzymes are 75% similar, with similarity 94% 
for the central region. Conversely, the amino and carboxy-terminal sides 
are quite dissimilar, suggesting that these structural differences may be 
responsible for the functional differences between the isozimes. To test this 
hypothesis, several different chimeric enzymes were constructed (Fig. 7). 
Several of the chimeric enzymes constructed and expressed in E. cofi 
were inactive and some had little activity, but the purified mBEII-I BspH1, 
in which the carboxy-terminal part of mBEII was exchanged for that of 
mBEI at the BspHl restriction site (Fig. 7) was active. The resulting enzyme 
had properties different from both mBEI and mBEII (Table 111). Activity 
was higher when assayed with the phosphorylase stimulation assay. In its 
preference for amylose (rather than amylopectin), the chimera was similar 
to mBEI, suggesting that the carboxy-terminal end is the region involved 
in determining substrate specificity and catalytic capacity. Conversely, the 
chimeric enzyme transferred shorter chains (d.p. around 6) than mBEI, 
mimicking mBEII and suggesting that the amino terminal of maize

Schematic diagram representing the structure of the branching enzymes from wild- 
type maize, mBE I, and mBE 11, and of the chimeric enzymes built by genetic manipulation. 
The figures show amino- and carboxy-terminuses and the four conserved regions (R1 to R4) 
in rhe central portion. Some of the restriction sites used to build the chimeras were already 
present in the cDNAs of the branching enzymes (e.g. HindIII, NcoI and BspHI), but one 
restriction site had to be introduced in the sequence of mBE I by site-directed mutagenesis. 
The mutation introduced with the purpose of facilitating genetic manipulation has no effect 
on the amino-acid sequence of the wild-type enzyme and is called a "silent" mutation. The 
portions of the chimeric enzyme from the N- and/or C-terminal of mBE I are shown in white, 
whereas those from mBE I1 are shown in black. The central portion from mBE I is striped 
and from mBE 11 has squares. Molecular weights are in Daltons.

branching-enzymes plays an important role in the size of the oligosaccharide 
chain transferred. 
In all branching enzymes, but not in other amylolytic enzymes, an acidic 
amino acid such as Glu or Asp follows region three. In E. coli this acidic 
amino acid is Glu-459, which follows the amino acids that form part of the 
catalytic site and is located in a region predicted as a P-strand-a-helix loop 
known to host the reaction center of a/D-barrels. However, although the 
conservation of an amino acid throughout evolution suggests that the amino 
acid may be significant for the activity of the enzyme, only site-directed 
mutagenesis can corroborate such a hypothesis. Binderup and Preiss (in 
press) constructed the mutants E459A, E459D, E459K, and E459Q of the 
E. coli branching enzyme, expressed the mutated genes, and purified the 
mutant enzymes. The purified enzymes were then characterized using the 
different activity assays available for branching enzyme. Mutation of Glu- 
459 did not result in loss of activity. Some activity remained even when 
Glu-459 was substituted with an amino acid of opposite charge (E459K). 
The similar responses of activity to changes in pH by the wild type and 
the E459A mutant also ruled out the possibility that Glu-459 may be 
involved in acid-base catalysis. Binderup and Preiss (in press) also con- 
cluded that Glu-459 is unlikely to be involved in chain transfer, as the 
HPAEC-PAD chromatograms were practically identical for all con- 
structed mutants. 
A three-dimensional structure is required before a specific role can be 
assigned to Glu-459 and to understand why this residue is a conserved

acidic amino acid in all known branching-enzymes. Although Binderup 
(1997) has obtained crystals of E. coli branching enzymes, an essential 
step in constructing a reliable three-dimensional model of the enzyme, the 
crystals are of the needle cluster kind, unsuitable for X-ray diffraction 
studies. Because the only possible approach in obtaining suitable enzyme 
crystal is trial and error, it is impossible to predict when (and if) a three- 
dimensional model will be obtained. 
It is worth noting that a conservative change from Glu to Asp resulted 
in higher specific activities in all three types of assays. It is interesting that 
all higher plant branching-enzymes have an Asp at the position occupied 
by Glu-459 in E. coli. 
The branching enzyme from Bacillus stearornophilus decreased the mo- 
lecular size of synthetic amylose. On studying the product of this reaction, 
it was found that BE had catalyzed the intramolecular transglycosylation 
to form a cyclic structure with a side chain. After removing the cyclic part 
of the molecule (using isoamylase) from the rest of the molecule, its cyclic 
nature was confirmed by the use of mass spectrometry. The authors pro- 
posed a new mechanism for the action of BE and suggested that plant BE 
may catalyze the cyclization of amylose and amylopectin. 
The understanding of how branching enzymes work is progressing 
quickly. and this progress is likely to lead to applications to biotechnology 
in the near future, with the transformation of altered branching enzyme 
genes into crop plants resulting in starch with an altered structure and 
physical properties that are advantageous to the starch industry.

OPEN QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES IN 
STARCH BIOSYNTHESIS 
What roles do the starch synthase isoforms play in the formation of 
the crystalline starch granule and amylopectin structures? How is amylose 
formed? Why are starch granules from different species different in size 
and in the number per cell? New methodology and much effort have 
resulted in major advances in the understanding of starch biosynthesis, but 
many questions remain unanswered. Here we discuss some of these open 
questions and possible answers. 
I. INITIATION OF STARCH BIOSYNTHESIS 
The synthesis of starch as described in the chapter, “The Biosynthetic 
Reactions of Starch Synthesis,” requires the presence of a glucan primer, 
that is, a glucan chain that is then elongated by the addition of a glucosyl 
group in the following reaction: 
ADP-glucose + [glucosyl], + ADP + [gluco~yl],,~ 
This equation, as written, poses the question of how the primer glucosyl, 
is first formed. It seems, however, that many enzymes capable of elongating 
glucans can display activity independent of added primer when assayed 
under suitable conditions, especially in the presence of citrate. Whether 
these unprimed reactions proceed in vivo is unknown. Citrate has been 
shown to decrease, by a large factor, the K, for primer of several enzymes: 
the chloroplastic starch phosphorylase (Sivak, 1992), and some starch 
(Boyer and Preiss, 1979; Pollock and Preiss, 1980) and glycogen (Fox et 
al., 1976; Holmes and Preiss, 1979) synthases. Because enzyme preparations 
often contain some glucan brought from the material from which they were 
isolated, activity independent of added primer is unlikely to represent de 
novo synthesis of carbohydrates in most of the systems examined. In the 
case of the glycogen synthase from Escherichia coli, which was studied in 
great detail, the glucose is incorporated into minute amounts of glucan 
primer that is associated (Fox et al., 1976), but is not covalently bound 
107

(Holmes and Preiss, 1979) with the enzyme. A similar situation is that of 
the chloroplastic phosphorylase of spinach leaf (Sivak, 1992). 
Common criteria for the identification of an unprimed product as a 
proteoglucan have been tested and are discussed elsewhere (see, e.g., Sivak, 
1992)-that 
is, precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (TCA), hydrolysis 
with dilute acid, and extensive treatment with proteases-and 
they have 
been shown to be unsuitable for the identification of an unprimed product 
of phosphorylases or glycogen or starch synthases as proteoglucans. A 
property of many amyloses, and of starches in general, can lead to confusion 
and artifacts. During electrophoresis, a small part of the polysaccharide 
migrates into the polyacrylamide gel in the presence of the sodium dodecyl 
sulfate and the urea used to break noncovalent bonds. The presence of the 
polysaccharide can be revealed by using an iodine reagent, with the color 
depending on the degree of ramification of the polyglucose chain. This 
peculiar property of polysaccharides, which mimics protein behavior, has 
been attributed to the capacity of these glucans to form complexes with 
the negatively charged sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (as they do with 
iodine). Also, the products of phosphorylase and of glycogen and starch 
synthase independent of added primer are long, mostly linear a-1 ,4-glucans, 
which because of their linearity, tend to precipitate in aqueous 5% or 10% 
TCA, a property that can mislead researchers into believing them to be 
glucosylated proteins. 
Is the reaction independent of added primer relevant? This question 
cannot be answered, but mention can be made of some matters that must 
be resolved before it can be answered. The first is whether in vivo glycogen 
and starch synthases are able to use ADPGlc in the absence of glucan 
(i.e., whether the conditions are favorable for the reaction). The second is 
whether the site of starch synthesis, the amyloplast, is ever completely 
devoid of glucans that could act as primers for the starch synthase. 
Speculation notwithstanding, enzymes have been isolated from potato 
tuber and maize endosperm, which catalyze the formation of a primer 
suitable for starch synthases. Studies using a particulate (sedimentable 
at high speed, membrane-containing) fraction of potato tuber provided 
evidence for the synthesis of a-1,4-glucosidic chains covalently bound to 
protein. The glucosyl donors in these reactions were UDPglucose, ADPglu- 
cose, and glucose-1-P (Lavintman and Cardini, 1973; Lavintman el al., 
1974). On the basis of other studies (Tandecarz and Cardini, 1978, 1979), 
it was proposed that, at least in potato tuber, a two-step reaction occurred 
involving a protein glucosyl acceptor, as follows: 
1. UDPglucose + acceptor protein + acceptor protein-glucose + UDP 
2. acceptor protein-glucose + nADP(UDP)glucose/glucose 1-P + acceptor 
protein-glucose-(g1c)n + nADP(UDP) or nPi 

HYPOTHESES IN STARCH BIOSYNTHESIS 
109 
The first reaction would be catalyzed by a UDPglucose : protein transglu- 
cosylase (UPTG), and the second reaction by either a starch synthase or 
a phosphorylase. Moreno el al. (1986) solubilized and partially purified the 
components that catalyzed reaction 1. Ardila and Tandecarz (1992) and 
Bocca et al. (1997) purified UPTG to electrophoretic homogeneity. It is 
not certain whether the transglycosylase and the acceptor protein are differ- 
ent or the same molecule. If they are one, then the transglucosylase must 
self-glucosylate, as suggested by the fact that an apparently pure fraction 
conserved catalytic activity. The acceptor protein was determined to have 
a molecular mass of 38,000, and only one glucose moiety was transferred 
to the protein. A p-elimination reaction carried out in the presence of a 
reducing agent showed that an 0-glucosidic linkage was formed and that 
the amino acids Ser and Thr were involved the reaction required MnC12. 
Specific phosphorylases and starch synthases in the potato tuber were able 
to use the product of reaction 1, the glucosylated acceptor protein, as a 
primer to synthesize a-1,Cglucan chains (Moreno et al., 1987). 
The reactions involving the UDPglucose : protein transglucosylase are 
similar to the reactions proposed for the initiation of glycogen synthesis 
in mammals (Pitcher et al., 1987,1988; Lomako et al., 1988). Glycogenin, a 
37-kDa protein, in association with glycogen synthase, self-glucosylates to 
form a glucosyl protein that can act as a primer for the glycogen synthase. 
The glycogenin protein has been sequenced (Campbell and Cohen, 1989) 
and, in contrast to the plant acceptor protein, the glucosidic linkage formed 
is with a tyrosine hydroxyl group (Smyth, 1988). Krisman (1972) was the first 
to postulate that the de novo synthesis of glycogen required an initiating pro- 
tein factor. 
The results obtained by Cardini, Tandecarz, and their collaborators in 
the plant system are exciting, but some important questions remain. As we 
know, starch synthesis occurs in plastids (i.e., chloroplast or amyloplast). 
Where in the cell is the transglucosylase/acceptor protein located? If it is 
in the plastid, then the glucosyl donor, UDPglucose, is not available for 
glucosylation because it is made in the cytosol and does not enter readily 
the chloroplast or amyloplast. It is possible, however, that the glucosylation 
may occur in the cytosol and then the glucosylated acceptor protein translo- 
cates into the plastid. It is also important to note that thus far these reactions 
have only been demonstrated in potato tuber and maize endosperm and 
not in other species or organs. When cDNA coding for this protein is cloned 
(antibodies against the protein have been raised; J. Tandecarz, personal 
communication), antisense experiments will be possible. Antisense RNA 
is a transcript that has a high degree of complementation with a target 
mRNA so that it can hybridize with the mRNA in vivo. In this way, the 
antisense RNA acts as a repressor of the function of the target RNA. 
These experiments, however, are difficult to interpret because it is virtually 
impossible to obtain zero expression and because often plant metabolism 

110 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
accommodates by using an alternative pathway. If the 38-kDa protein 
associated with UPTG is also present in Chlumydomonas reinhardtii then 
the next step would be to find mutants lacking the 38-kDa protein and see 
whether starch is still synthesized in the mutant. The use of gene disruption 
in Antirrhynum nafus is also an attractive possibility (see Experimental 
Systems in the study of starch metabolism). 
I I .  
HOW IS THE STARCH GRANULE FORMED? 
The glycogen-synthesizing enzymes from E. coli are not much different 
from those in plants, but bacteria make glycogen and not starch. When 
the maize-branching enzymes are expressed in E. coli, they conserve the 
properties they have in the plant, but the resulting glucan is glycogen; not 
starch. How is the intrincate structure of the starch granule formed in vivo? 
The sugary mutants of maize have been known since the beginning of 
the twentieth century. The mutant accumulates about 35% of its dry weight 
as phytoglycogen, a highly branched, water-soluble polysaccharide. Phyto- 
glycogen has 7 to 10% of its glucosidic linkages as a-1 + 6, and is there- 
fore more highly branched than amylopectin (Manners, 1985). Pan and 
Nelson (1984) found that all the su 1 mutants were deficient in a particular 
endosperm-debranching enzyme activity, pullulanase, suggesting that the 
debranching activity is the biochemical deficiency leading to phytoglycogen 
formation. The debranching enzymes of normal maize endosperm were 
separated into three peaks of activity on a hydroxyapatite column and it 
was found that the su 1 mutant lacked one of the activity peaks toward 
pullulan, whereas the other two peaks were also much reduced in activity. 
The debranching enzyme activity of developing endosperms is proportional 
to the number of copies of the Su 1 gene, suggesting that the Su 1 gene is 
the structural gene for the debranching enzyme. The debranching enzymes, 
however, have not been characterized to a great extent (but see Lee et 
al., 1971). 
The observation that debranching enzyme deficiency was associated with 
the presence of phytoglycogen in the sii 1 mutants (Pan and Nelson, 1984) 
revived a hypothesis of Erlander (1958), who proposed that amylopectin 
synthesis was due to debranching of phytoglycogen, which was first formed 
via starch synthase and branching enzyme catalysis. Although phytoglyco- 
gen may not be a normal intermediate in the synthesis of amylopectin, this 
may occur from a more highly branched 0-1 + 4-glucan that is formed via 
the action of the starch synthase and branching enzyme isoforms. If the 
activity of the debranching enzyme is insufficient, then a more highly 
branched, water-soluble glucan could accumulate with a concomitant de-

111 
crease in the amylopectin component of the starch granule and, possibly, 
an increase in the relative amylose content of the granule. 
The hypothesis that the sugary 1 mutation affects the structural gene for 
a debranching enzyme is further supported by the isolation of a cDNA of 
the su 1 gene. However, its deduced amino-acid sequence is similar to a 
bacterial isoamylase (James et af., 1995) rather than to a pullulanase. 
In C. reinhardtii, Ball and his collaborators (Mouille etal., 1996) generated 
seven independent alleles in the sta7 locus. All mutants lacked granular 
starch, but contained a water-soluble polysaccharide, similar to maize phy- 
toglycogen, in an amount equivalent to 5% of the starch content of the 
wild type. This defect was associated with the disappearance of a specific 
debranching activity. All other starch-related enzyme activities were 
normal. 
It remains to be shown whether the su 1 gene product debranching 
enzyme activity is actually an isoamylase or a pullulanase (Hizukuri, 1995). 
Isoamylases, such as that present in Bacillus amyloderamosa, readily de- 
branch amylopectin. Pullulanase, such as that present in Aerobacter aero- 
genes, completely debranches amylopectin, but its action on glycogen is 
usually incomplete. The specificity of these reactions should be studied 
further with respect to the factors that determine which a-1,6 linkages are 
cleaved and which remain resistant to debranching action. It is possible 
that the crowding of the a-1,6 linkages in a cluster region in amylopectin 
causes some steric difficulties for the debranching of the linkages in the 
cluster region, but at present this is only conjecture. As for the problem 
of starch initiation, this is a research field that would benefit greatly from 
gene disruption experiments. 
Ill. A COMPLETE PATHWAY 
From the information available on the branching enzyme and starch 
synthase isozymes, a possible route for the synthesis of amylopectin and 
amylose can be proposed as shown in Fig. 1. 
A reaction with the potential of being the initiating reaction for synthesis 
has been observed in potato tuber and maize endosperm (see preceding). 
The resulting glucosylated 38-kDa protein can serve as a primer for the 
synthesis of starch via the starch synthase reactions. Whether there is an 
acceptor protein that could be glucosylated by ADPGlc has not been dem- 
onstrated; the proposed initiating reaction and acceptor protein have not 
been characterized as well as the other reactions in starch synthesis. 
After the formation of the unbranched maltosaccharide-protein primer 
of undetermined size, high rates of polysaccharide formation may occur at

glucan then can accept glucose from ADPGlc, either via GBSS catalysis to form an amylose 
structure, or in combination with BEI, SSSII. and (possibly) GBSS to form a polysaccharide 
having the internal structure of the final amylopectin product. BE11 and SSSI carry out the 
reactions to form the exterior of the amylopectin structure. The enlargement of the amylopectin 
could proceed further by continuing participation of BEl, SSSII, and (possibly) GBSS, by 
repeat of reactions 2 and 3. Production of amylopectin in reaction 5 is caused by dehranching 
enzyme, which also generates oligosaccharide chains, which are elongated by GBSS to form 
the amvlose fraction. 
the surface of the developing starch granule, where granule-bound starch 
synthase (GBSS), soluble starch synthase I1 (SSSII), and branching enzyme 
I (BEI) interact with the glucosylated protein primer to form a branched 
a-glucan containing both long and intermediate-size chains. 
The postulation of phase 2 in Fig. 1 is based on the studies of the 
polysaccharide structures observed in the C. reinhardtii mutants deficient 
in SSSII and GBSS (Fontaine et al., 1993; Maddelein et al., 1994a,b), as 
well as the ae mutants of rice (Mizuno ef af., 1993) and maize (Boyer and 
Preiss, 1981). which are defective in branching enzyme I1 (BEII). BE11 
deficient mutants have altered polysaccharides with fewer branches and 
longer sized branched chains. In phase 3, SSSI and BE11 are responsible 
for the synthesis of the A- and exterior B-chains to complete the first cluster 
region in the glucan. Continued synthesis in phase 4 is essentially a repeat 
of phases 2 and 3 to synthesize a highly branched a-glucan, termed proamy- 
lopectin. This highly a-branched glucan is water soluble and noncrystalline. 
In phase 5, a debranching enzyme debranches the preamylopectin to form 
amylopectin, which can now crystallize. In phase 6, the chains, liberated 
by debranching action of the proamylopectin could be used as primers by 
GBSS to form amylose. Amylose synthesis may occur only inside the starch

granule, and only GBSS would be involved because it may be the only 
starch synthase present at the site of amylose synthesis. 
These reactions do not have to occur in perfect sequence, and the phases 
may have some overlap (e.g., phases 2,3, and 4 may overlap, and possibly 
even 5 and 6). However, the present evidence, such as intermediate products 
formed by starch mutants of C. reinhardfii and of higher plants, supports 
the sequence of reactions shown in Fig. 1 for amylopectin and amylose 
biosynthesis. Further experiments are required to test this hypothetic 
scheme, and attempts to purify and characterize the debranching enzyme, 
crucial to this hypothesis, are under way. 
It should be noted that the proamylopectin in this still hypothetical 
pathway would be larger than the phytoglycogen found in the mutants 
lacking debranching activity. This is because proamylopectin would have 
a size comparable to amylopectin, while phytoglycogen, much smaller, may 
be the product of degradation of a proamylopectin unable to crystallize 
into amylopectin and may be so unprotected that it would be subject to 
the action of amylases.

THE SITE OF STARCH SYNTHESIS IN 
NONPHOTOSYNTHETIC PLANT TISSUES: 
THE AMYLOPLAST 
A hypothetic metabolic pathway must pass a crucial test to be accepted by 
the scientific community: Are the enzymes in the “right” compartment within 
the cell so that the product of one reaction can be used by the next enzyme 
in the pathway? Starchgranulesare large enough to be observed with amicro- 
scope (see Fig. 2 in the chapter, “Physicochemical Structure of the Starch 
Granule”). With good techniques, it is possible to see that the starch granule 
is enclosed within a defined structure within the cell. Are the ADPGlc PPase, 
the starch synthase, and the branching enzyme also there? 
A large part of the biosynthetic capacity of a plant cell is localized 
in plastids, which are self-replicating organelles surrounded by a double- 
membrane envelope. Plastids are present in most cells of photosynthetic 
eukaryotes. In most angiosperms, however, sperm cells lack plastids, a fact 
that makes plastid inheritance solely maternal. The envelope is composed 
of an outer and inner membranes, which differ in their permeability, sepa- 
rated by a 10 to 20-nm gap. The plastids contain DNA that is concentrated 
in a section of the stroma, which is the background matrix of the plastid. 
The plastidial ribosomes are smaller that the cytoplasmic ribosomes. 
The green chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis; chromoplasts con- 
tain carotenoid pigments and can be found in flowers, fruits, senescing 
leaves, and sometimes in roots; etioplasts are present in seedlings grown 
in the dark. Storage plastids are designated according to the nature of the 
product they accumulate (i.e., protein in proteinoplasts, lipids in elaioplasts, 
and starch in amyloplasts). Plastids from different tissues can differ both 
in morphology and biochemistry, but the DNA they contain is identical 
(Dennis et al., 1985). This indicates that all plastids arise from the same 
precursor plastids and later differentiate in response to the development 
of the tissue. For a proposal of how proplastids develop into the different 
types of plastids in a plastid cycle, see Whatley (1978). 
Amyloplasts are characterized by the presence of one or more starch 
granules that grow in size as the storage organ develops, distending the 
plastid. The structure of the amyloplast can be studied using microscopy, 
115

but preparation of the samples requires great care to avoid artifacts. Micros- 
copy can also help in the localization of enzymes within the amyloplast. 
The study of amyloplast biochemistry and transport demands “good” amy- 
loplasts (i.e., functional, whole plastids, clean of contaminating enzymes 
belonging to other cellular fractions, and with intact envelopes). 
I .  MICROSCOPY AND IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL STUDIES 
Kim et al. (1989) employed immunocytochemistry at the light microscopy 
level. An antibody raised against the spinach leaf ADPGlc PPase (which spe- 
cifically reacts with the potato ADPGlc PPase in immunoblotting experi- 
ments) was used on thin sections of the potato tuber, and the bound antibody 
was detected with either a secondary fluorescent antibody or with protein 
A tagged with gold particles (Fig. 1). The ADPGlc PPase was specifically 
localized within the amyloplast, confirming the results obtained by others 
(Mohabir and John, 1988) using a different methodology (see later). 
Ultrathin sections for electron microscopy (thickness approximately 
100 nm) must be able to withstand the electron beam and the vacuum in 
the microscope. For this, it is first necessary to stabilize the ultrastructure 
of the fresh tissue by fixation, then to dehydrate it with an organic solvent, 
and finally to embed it in a resin. The resulting hard block can be cut into 
ultrathin sections, which are then mounted on a grid and stained. For 
immunogold labeling, free-aldehyde groups and nonspecific binding sites

are saturated with buffers containing glycine and gelatin, and the grids are 
incubated with a suitable concentration of the antiserum. After washing 
excess serum, the sections are incubated with protein A-gold, then washed, 
dried, and stained with aqueous uranyl acetate (Kram, 1995). 
Starch storage tissues are difficult to prepare for ultramicroscopy, because 
starch granules are often incompletely fixed, and as a consequence, they 
fold and detach from the rest of the section. Kram (1995) obtained good 
sections for ultrastructural research using conventional embedding of po- 
tato microtubers in Epon resin (Fig. 2). For immunolocalization, she found 
that slow cooling during dehydration and embedding in Lowicryl K4M 
(Norticon, Breda, The Netherlands) at -30°C gave the best results. Amy- 
loplasts in potato microtubers are not identical to those present in normal 
tubers but are, in many respects, a good experimental system. Indeed, 
starch granules in potato tubers are very large, adding to the difficulty in 
preparing good-quality sections, but the granules in microtubers are smaller. 
Electron micrographs of castor bean endosperm tissue showed the pres- 
ence of proplastids with starch grains. Starch synthase was shown to be 
associated with the proplastid fraction of the endosperm tissue along with 
the starch granule (Reibach and Benedict, 1982).

CELL FRACTIONATION 
Fractionation techniques relying on differential centrifugation, of the 
kind used for isolation of chloroplasts (see the chapter, “Starch Accumula- 
tion in Photosynthesis Cells). are inadequate because the amyloplast con- 
tains large starch granules that disrupt the integrity of the membranes 
even under mild centrifugal forces. Macdonald and ap Rees (1983) were 
successful in isolating intact amyloplasts not seriously contaminated by 
cytosol, from soybean cell protoplasts and showed that ADPGlc PPase and 
starch synthase were confined to the amyloplast. Echeverria et al. (1985, 
1988) isolated amyloplasts from protoplasts prepared from maize endo- 
sperm harvested 14 to 17 days after pollination (DAP). Similarly, Journet 
and Douce (1985) isolated amyloplasts from cauliflower buds, and Macheral 
et al. (1985) and Journet et af. (1986) isolated them from sycamore (Acer 
pertdoplatanus) cells. Entwistle el af. (1988) and Entwistle and ap Rees 
(1988) were able to isolate amyloplasts from lysates of protoplasts obtained 
from the endosperm of developing grains of wheat, and Mohabir and John 
(1988) obtained a fraction enriched in intact potato tuber amyloplasts. The 
findings and conclusions reached by all these groups were similar to those 
of Macdonald and ap Rees (1983) (i.e.. that the starch biosynthetic enzymes 
are primarily, if not exclusively. confined to the amyloplasts of those tissues). 
In short, cell fractionation, which is composed of three steps-homog- 
enization, fractionation, and analysis-can 
be an excellent way to locate 
an enzyme within the cell. The reader is referred to the excellent commen- 
tary by ap Rees (1995), in which the rigorous criteria to follow so that a 
cell fractionation provides good, reliable information is summarized. The 
author concludes that work done on soybean protoplasts (Macdonald and 
ap Rees, 1983), wheat endosperm protoplasts (Entwistle and ap Rees, 
1988), wheat endosperm (Tetlow el al., 1993), pea embryos (Denyer and 
Smith, 1988), and pea roots (Borchert et al., 1993) provides further support 
for the view that ADPGlc PPase essentially is confined to the plastid. 
In short, authors using a variety of methods and plant systems reported 
that in nonphotosynthetic tissues the enzymes of starch biosynthesis appear 
to be restricted to the amyloplast. However, two reports have proposed 
that a significant portion of the ADPGlc PPase activity may be present in 
the cytosol. Amyloplasts were isolated from wheat endosperm by Thorn- 
bjmnsen et af. (1996), with intactness ranging from 41 to 89%. The propor- 
tion of enzymatic activity recovered in the amyloplast fraction, in relation 
to total activity, was 13 to 17% for starch synthase and alkaline pyrophospha- 
tase, and only 2.5% for the ADPGlc PPase. On this basis, the authors 
calculated that of ADPGlc PPase activity residing in the amyloplast was 
15% of the total, and that the rest was in the cytosol. Immunologic studies 

STARCH SYNTHESIS IN NONPHOTOSYNTHETIC TISSUES 
119 
by the same authors detected two different isoforms of the ADPGlc PPase: 
one mainly cytosolic and the other mainly plastidial. The authors indicated 
that there is an excess of ADPGlc PPase activity in the amyloplast to 
account for the starch synthetic rate, and they were uncertain about the 
function of the putative cytosolic ADPGlc PPase. 
In a report by Denyer et al., 1996, preparations enriched in maize endo- 
sperm plastids contained 24 to 47% of the total activity of the plastid- 
marker enzymes, starch synthase and alkaline pyrophosphatase, but they 
contained only 3% of the total ADPGlc PPase activity. On this basis, the 
authors estimated that more than 95% of the ADPGlc PPase activity was 
nonplastidial. Using antibodies prepared against the Bt 2 subunit of the 
maize endosperm ADPGlc PPase, they showed that most of the Bt 2 protein 
was confined to the supernatant, and some was in the plastid. In bt 2 mutant 
kernels, the cytosolic protein that reacted with the Bt 2 antiserum was not 
detected, but there was a plastidial form of ADPGlc PPase. These data 
are somewhat different than what has been obtained by Miller and Chourey 
(1995) and by J. L. Prioul (personal communication, 1997) who, using 
immunogold labeling, detected the Bt 2 protein in the amyloplast. If the 
data from Denyer et al. (1996) are not artifactual, this would mean that 
there is more than one route for synthesis of ADPGlc in maize endosperm. 
Most authors believe that carbon translocated into the plastid via a glucose- 
6-P translocator is converted to ADPGlc by the action of the (plastidial) 
phosphoglucomutase and the ADPGlc PPase (Neuhaus et al., 1993). Con- 
versely, Denyer et al. (1996) believe that some ADPGlc synthesis goes on 
in the amyloplast, catalyzed via a plastidial ADPGlc PPase, but since in 
their model most of the ADPGlc is synthesized in the cytosol, it must be 
translocated into the plastid for starch synthesis; thus their model demands 
an ADPGlc transporter. 
111. 
TRANSPORT OF CARBON INTO AMYLOPLASTS 
As discussed previously, the model of Denyer et al. (1996), in which 
most of the ADPGlc is synthesized in the cytosol, demands an ADPGlc 
transporter if starch synthesis is to proceed (as it does) within the amy- 
loplast. However, no protein with those properties has yet been identified. 
Although ADPGlc uptake by the A. pseudoplatanus amyloplasts has been 
reported (Pozueta-Romero et al., 1991), Borchert et al. (1993) and Batz et 
al. (1994) showed that this ADPGlc transport may not be relevant phys- 
iologically. In vitro ADPGlc may be translocated via the ATP/ADP trans- 
locator, but since both ADP and ATP effectively inhibit ADPGlc uptake 
at concentrations lower than their physiologic concentrations (in pea-root 

120 
MlRTA NOEMl SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
and cauliflower-bud amyloplasts), in vivo transport of ADPGlc by the ATP/ 
ADP translocator is unlikely to be relevant. 
It has been suggested that the Bt 1 gene product may be the ADPGlc 
transporter. The Bt 1 gene encodes a plastidial membrane-associated pro- 
tein (Cao et al., 1995; Sullivan and Kaneko, 1995), whose deduced amino- 
acid sequence shows similarity to known adenine nucleotide transporters 
(Sullivan ef al., 1991). The bt 1 mutant is starch deficient and shows a high 
level of ADPGlc concentration in the endosperm as compared with the 
normal endosperm (Shannon et al., 1996). However, this is highly specula- 
tive and the Bt 1 protein remains to be studied and characterized, and its 
function remains to be determined. In conclusion, the hypothetic ADPGlc 
transporter required by the model used by Denyer et al. (1996) remains to 
be found. 
Hypothetic models aside studies employing a variety of methods have 
shown that the starch biosynthetic enzymes in leaf tissue are localized in 
the chloroplast (see the chapter. “Starch Accumulation in Photosynthesis 
Cells”), and in nonphotosynthetic tissue they are localized in the amyloplast. 
However, an important question remains to be answered What metabolite 
is transported into the amyloplast to provide carbon and energy for starch 
synthesis? For the chloroplast, it is clear that the main transport system 
for carbon is the triose-P/Pi translocator (Heber and Heldt, 1981). It had 
been assumed that a similar process would also be functional in the amy- 
loplast envelope, based on the rationale that amyloplasts could develop 
into chloroplasts and vice versa, and some data seemed to support this 
view. For example, Echeverria et al. (1988) isolated amyloplasts from maize 
endosperm able to convert labeled triose-P into starch. Mohabir and Johns 
(1988) also suggested that potato tuber amyloplasts have a triose-P/P, trans- 
locator when triose-P, generated by the addition of labeled fructose-l,6- 
bisP with aldolase, triose-P isomerase, and fructose-2,6-bisP to an intact 
amyloplast fraction, was converted into starch. The plastids from cauliflower 
buds were shown to contain all the enzymes necessary to convert triose- 
P to starch (Journet and Douce, 1985). Borchert et al. (1989) prepared 
arnyloplasts from pea roots and identified a translocator that exchanged 
P, with glucose-6-P, dihydroxyacetone-P, or 3PGA. The translocator had 
low affinity for 2PGA or glucose-1-P. The highest affinity was seen with 
dihydroxyacetone-P and P,, and then with 3PGA and glucose-6-P. It is 
possible, however, that contamination from other cellular fractions may 
have led to artifacts. 
Other evidence, however, supports the presence of a different transport 
system in the amyloplast envelope. Keeling et al. (1988) studied starch 
synthesis in isolated wheat endosperm tissue or in the intact plant by incuba- 
tion with [l-”C]- and [6-13C]-glucose and by looking at the extent of the 

STARCH SYNTHESIS IN NONPHOTOSYNTHETIC TISSUES 
121 
redistribution in the glucose moieties of the starch formed. The starch was 
isolated and the distribution of the 13C isotope was determined. If carbon 
flow into starch were via the triose-P isomerase, the redistribution would 
have been extensive. However, there was very little increase of the incidence 
of 13C in carbons 2-5. A redistribution of 15 to 20% of label, between 
carbons 1 and 6 of glucose recovered, is consistent with some conversion 
of glucose into triose-P, resynthesis of the hexose, and its conversion into 
starch. Since the same redistribution was observed for sucrose, it was con- 
cluded that the redistribution occurred in the cytosol and not in the amy- 
loplast. These data did not support a triose-P/Pi translocator as a major 
transport system of carbon into the amyloplast for starch synthesis, indicat- 
ing that the major carbon transport system involves a sugar-P: glucose-1- 
P, glucosed-P, or fructose-6-P. 
Entwistle and ap Rees (1988) found that wheat endosperm lacked sig- 
nificant amyloplastic fructose-l,6-bisphosphatase, 
an enzyme that would 
be required if a triose-P/Pi transport system were involved in starch synthe- 
sis. In the search for a transport system to supply carbon for starch synthesis 
in the wheat endosperm, Tyson and ap Rees (1988) incubated intact 
amyloplasts with different I4C-labeled compounds (i.e., glucose, glucose- 
1-P, glucosed-P, fructose-6-P, fructose-l,6-bisP, dihydroxyacetone-P, and 
glycerol-P). Only glucose-1-P was incorporated into starch, and this incorpo- 
ration was dependent on the integrity of the amyloplast. These results are 
consistent with the results of Keeling et af. (1988). Direct import of C-6 
compounds has been reported for amyloplasts of potato tubers, fava beans 
(Viola et al., 1991), maize endosperm, and suspension cells of Chenopodium 
rubrum (Hatzfeldt and Stitt, 1990). Labeled hexose monophosphates can 
be converted into starch by plastids isolated from wheat endosperm (Tyson 
and ap Rees, 1988), soybean suspension cultures (Coates and ap Rees, 
1994), pea cotyledons (Hill and Smith, 1991), and cauliflower florets (Batz 
et a/., 1994). 
Is there an explanation for the contradictory results obtained by different 
research groups? An easy explanation is the existence of very different 
transport systems in amyloplasts of different tissues. Another explanation 
is that some workers studied amyloplasts that had been damaged and/or 
contaminated during isolation. The permeability properties of the isolated 
amyloplasts depend on the degree of intactness, and the present methodol- 
ogy to evaluate plastid intactness measures enzyme latency (ap Rees and 
Entwistle, 1989) or relies on microscopic examination (Pozueta Romero et 
al., 1991). None of these methods are sufficient to evaluate the extent of 
the damage suffered by the plastid envelopes or the degree of contamination 
of the amyloplast by other cellular components. Although intact amyloplasts 
are far more difficult to isolate than spinach or pea chloroplasts, it is hoped 

122 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
that the more recently developed methodology will be further improved, 
resulting in more reliable experimental results. 
Although it appears that the major carbon transport system for the wheat 
grain amyloplast does not involve triose-P, and most likely involves hexose- 
P (Fig. 3), the major carbon transport systems for other amyloplasts are 
not certain. More recent evidence does indicate that what is true for wheat 
is also true for pea embryo amyloplasts, for maize, and for potato. Thus, it 
may be that the major transport system for most reserve, nonphotosynthetic 
plant systems is at the hexose-P level and not at the triose-P level. The 
glycolytic scheme in the amyloplast may then take on a more important 
function than is observed in the chloroplast, in that the scheme aids in the 
production of amyloplastic ATP. Amyloplastic 3PGA may then also be an 
indicator of the state of ATP level in the amyloplast and, on its accumula-

tion, may be an indicator of high ATP concentration and/or carbon excess, 
thus stimulating starch synthesis by stimulating the ADPGlc PPase or re- 
versing its Pi inhibition. 
From the controversies that persist in the biochemistry and molecular 
biology of starch biosynthesis, that regarding the localization of ADPGlc 
PPase has been visited and revisited by researchers several times since the 
mid-1970s. Biochemical studies clearly indicate that the enzyme is located 
in the chloroplasts of leaves (see the chapter, “Starch Accumulation in 
Photosynthesis Cells”). Conversely (as discussed in this chapter), there is 
less agreement concerning the localization of the enzyme in nonphotosyn- 
thetic tissue; several methods have been used in the cereals, including 
immunolocalization at the electron microscopy level (Miller and Chourey, 
1995) and cell fractionation followed by enzyme assay (Echeverria et al., 
1988); contradictory results have been published (Villand and Kleczkowski, 
1994). The data obtained by Brangeon et al. (1997) confirm the earlier 
results of Miller and Chourey (1995) and provide detailed information 
on the correlation between the expression of ADPGlc PPase and starch 
accumulation within the endosperm, showing how the tissue- and cell- 
specific expression varies throughout the grain-filling period, as the endo- 
sperm and amyloplasts mature. 
Brangeon and his collaborators (1997) studied maize kernels using light 
microscopy to determine the citologic structure of the fruit wall (pericarp 
and nucellus) and endosperm during development and filling of the grain. 
The authors chose four different stages representing late cellularization 
[8-9 days after pollination (DAP)], cell differentiation and enlargement 
(15 DAP and 23 DAP, respectively), and maturation of the endosperm 
tissue (35 DAP). For immunolocalization of the ADPGlc PPase, they used 
antibodies against the small or the large subunit, and they also did in situ 
hybridization of the corresponding mRNA transcripts. 
In very young kernels, immunolabel was observed exclusively in cells of 
the pericarp layer, with no staining visible in the endosperm. At this early 
stage, there were no starch-bearing plastids in the young developing endo- 
sperm cells. By the next stage of development examined (14 DAP), the 
endosperm had expanded to some extent. The outer meristematic layer of 
cells underwent tangential divisions to produce cells to the inside, and 
radial divisions to extend its surface. The meristematic cells ceased to 
divide by 16 or 17 DAP; the outer layer cells gave raise to aleurone and 
subaleurone cell layers, which contained protein and lipid globules. Con- 
versely, the endosperm contained starch, displaying a gradient of matura- 
tion in which the outer layers containing small vacuoles and storage bodies 
but no starch-bearing plastids; the cells toward the center were larger, 
with denser cytoplasm and larger starch granules within the amyloplasts. 
Throughout the endosperm, the strength of immunolabeling was correlated 

124 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
with the number and size of the starch granules. Under high magnification, 
a circular pattern was seen in young amyloplasts (Kim et al., 1989, in 
potato) interpreted by Brangeon et al. (1997) as reflecting a higher enzyme 
concentration in zones active in starch synthesis. 
Cytoplasmic strands were clearly immunonegative, and the immunolabel 
was associated exclusively with the amyloplasts. When using cDNA probes 
for mRNA coding for the small or large subunits of ADPGlc PPase, the 
label was dispersed throughout the cytosol, as expected for an enzyme 
encoded by nuclear genes. 
By 23 DAP, cell division had ceased, as increase in endosperm volume 
was by cell expansion only. The pericarp had collapsed and the aleurone 
and subaleurone cell layers were fully differentiated. The outer layers of 
the starchy endosperm contained small, rounded granules embedded in 
cytosol, and the more central cells were filled with starch and had very 
little cytosol. 
At 35 DAP. the endosperm had reached its maximum size and had 
started drying-the 
cells eventually dying, with starch grains filling them 
completely. The pericarp was crushed by expanding endosperm, becoming 
the final outer fruit coat composed of thick-walled dead cells. 
In short, the data obtained by Brangeon et al. (1997) confirm the previous 
work of Miller and Chourey (1995) concerning the localization of the 
ADPGlc PPase within the amyloplasts. It is worth noting that these two 
groups came to similar conclusions after working with different lines, using 
different methodology and different antibodies against ADPGlc PPase. 
Conversely, the data of Denyer et al. (1996), proposing that most of the 
ADPGlc PPase in maize endosperm is associated with the cytosol, are still to 
be confirmed by other laboratories. Although Brangeon and collaborators 
(1997) suggests a number of explanations for the results of Denyer and 
colleagues (1996). in our view the most likely problem was the inability of 
Denyer ef al. (1996) to obtain intact amyloplasts and to take into account this 
lack of intactness in their interpretation of the data. Until good amyloplast 
preparations displaying intact envelopes are obtained, immunolocalization 
data such as those obtained by Brangeon et al. (1997) and Miller and 
Chourey (1995) should be preferred to data such as that from Denyer and 
colleagues, especially in the context of all the other evidence available. 
To conclude: despite proposals presented by some authors and discussed 
in this chapter. the experimental evidence available supports mechanisms 
for the transport of carbon into the amyloplast and its conversion into 
starch, as depicted in Fig. 3.

REGULATION OF THE STARCH SYNTHESIS PATHWAY: 
TARGETS FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Glycogen synthesis in mammalian cells is relatively well understood, 
including the specificity of glycogen synthase for UDPglucose as well as 
its regulation through hormonally induced posttranslational protein modi- 
fication. Textbooks of biochemistry usually describe these metabolic 
schemes in detail. Conversely, the biosynthesis of polysaccharides in bacte- 
ria and plants is usually described only superficially. These organisms accu- 
mulate glycogen (bacteria) or starch (plants) by metabolic pathways that 
are different in a number of respects from those occurring in animals. 
Despite the different structures of the final products, in both bacteria and 
plants ADPglucose is the glucose donor for the elongation of the a-1,4- 
glucan chain. Moreover, in both systems, the main regulatory step of the 
metabolism takes place at the level of ADPglucose synthesis. 
II. GENETIC ENGINEERING 
The gene technology developed in the past few decades can be used to test 
scientific hypotheses and to alter plant metabolic pathways for commercial 
advantage. These two uses of technology go hand in hand: unless it is 
understood how a pathway works, it is very difficult to change that pathway 
in a particular direction. 
Plant transformation is now an experimental tool that can be used 
on many species; a large number of genes, viral genomes, and plant- 
transposable elements have been transferred to the genomes of species 
such as potato, tobacco, oilseed rape, and so on. 
Transforming a plant with a foreign DNA involves a number of steps. 
Exogenously added DNA has to be taken up by isolated plant cells, and 
the transformed cells must be able to regenerate a plant; the exogenous 
DNA can originate in bacteria, animals, or other plants. Breeding is no 
longer limited to existing varieties within the species but is limited only by 
imagination and good biochemistry. 
125 

126 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
The methodology required for successful modification of plant metabo- 
lism has been perfected for some plant species and for specific enzymes. 
This methodology includes transformation of plant cells or tissues: regenera- 
tion of a healthy plant from the transformed cells: isolation of the gene 
encoding the enzyme of interest; identification of promoter sequences for 
tissue-specific expression: and targetting of the protein into the cellular 
compartment desired. 
A transgenic organism is defined as one whose genome has been modified 
by the addition of exogenous DNA. This exogenous DNA can be a manipu- 
lated sequence from the same species or DNA from another species (plant 
or otherwise) that has a desirable property. The operational gene in the 
exogenous DNA is called the transgene. The DNA can be introduced 
into a cell by a variety of techniques (e.g., injection, transformation, viral 
infection). Biotechnology refers to the area of research in which recombi- 
nant DNA techniques are used to design and produce genotypes profitable 
for agriculture or other commercial enterprises. 
Ill. VECTORS 
The vectors used routinely to produce transgenic plants are derived from 
the soil bacterium Agrobacteriurn tumefuciens. In its natural form, this 
bacterium causes the crown gall disease in which the infected plant produces 
tumors (”galls”) usually at the base (“crown”) of the plant. 
Part of the process of infection and tumor formation requires the insertion 
of the T, plasmid of the bacterium into the genome of the plant, a character- 
istic that makes the Ti plasmid an ideal vector for the introduction of foreign 
DNA into the plant. The DNA of interest is “spliced” into the Ti plasmid, 
and then the whole segment is inserted into a plant chromosome. To achieve 
this objective, some modifications must be made to the Ti plasmid-for 
example, its attenuation (deletion of tumor-inducing genes), the insertion 
of cloning sites so that the DNA of interest can be inserted easily into the 
vector. and the addition of selectable genes. 
The gene of interest is spliced into the modified T-DNA by conjugation of 
Agrobacteriurn with Escherichia coli containing an “intermediate vector.” 
Then, Agrobacferirtm cells containing the recombinant plasmid are selected 
after conjugation by growing the culture in the presence of a suitable 
antibiotic, and these are the cells used to infect cut segments of plant tissues. 
The infected plant tissue (e.g., leaf discs) is placed in a medium containing 
the other antibiotic (e.g., kanamycin) so that only plant cells that acquired 
antibiotic resistance from the T-DNA transfer survive. The transformed 
cells grow into clumps of cells that can be induced to form roots and shoots 

STARCH SYNTHESIS PATHWAY REGULATION 
127 
when plant hormones and nutrients are present in suitable quantities in the 
growth medium. The plants obtained in this manner can then be screened to 
see whether the DNA of interest has been incorporated in their genomes. 
DNA that have been incorporated using this methodology include those 
that confer resistance to glyphosate (a herbicide) and a gene that delays 
ripening. Genes relevant to starch synthesis have been transformed into 
potato, tobacco, and tomato using A. tumefaciens Ti plasmid-derived vec- 
tors. Agrobacterium has also been used to transform seeds, and transgenic 
plants of Arabidopsis thaliana have been obtained by cocultivation of im- 
bibed seeds with Agrobacteriurn (Feldman and Marks, 1987). 
The majority of the attempts to transform plants in the 1970s failed or 
remained unsubstantiated. A major advance occurred when chimeric genes 
were constructed in which the coding regions of foreign genes were inserted 
between the signals controlling gene expression in plants-upstream 
pro- 
moters and downstream adenylation sites (Downey et al., 1983). The criteria 
confirming the successful integration and expression of the chimeric gene 
in the plant cells included the phenotypic expression of the desired charac- 
teristic, Southern blots to demonstrate the presence of the DNA in trans- 
formed tissue, Northern blots to confirm the presence of the RNA transcript 
of the correct size, and activity of the enzyme. Later studies established 
the sexual transmission of the foreign DNA to progeny of the transgenic 
plants in segregation ratios typical of simply inherited genes. 
IV. PROTOPLAST ISOLATION AND TRANSFORMATION 
Not all plant species are amenable to transformation using the Ti-plasmid. 
In this case, protoplasts are prepared and then induced to take up exoge- 
nously applied DNA. Protoplasts can be isolated from a variety of plant 
tissues, although usually leaves are used. Protoplast isolation involves the 
enzymatic removal of the cell wall by incubating tissue slices in a medium 
including fungal cellulases, pectinases, and hemicellulases. The medium is 
prepared at a high osmotic potential to prevent the bursting of the proto- 
plasts once the cell wall has been digested. The conditions required to 
prepare viable protoplasts depend on the plant species and the tissue, and 
must be determined empirically-that 
is, by trial and error. Once purified 
from cell debris and the enzymatic solution, the protoplasts are ready for 
transformation. A number of methods can be used in order to get the 
protoplasts to take up the exogenous DNA, including the use of polyvalent 
cations and electroporation, fusion of protoplasts with liposomes containing 
the foreign DNA, and microinjection. 

128 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
If the DNA is maintained stably within the cell and if the protoplasts can 
be induced to regenerate a whole plant, transgenic plants can be obtained. 
V. 
PLANT REGENERATION 
A few days after isolation, the protoplasts in their culture medium begin 
to regenerate their cell walls and divide to form a microcallus. A callus is 
a mass of undifferentiated plant cells, and its formation is dependent on 
the presence in the culture medium of the plant hormones auxins and 
cytokinins. The callus may eventually differentiate to form shoots and/or 
roots, depending on the balance of plant hormones in the culture medium, 
as demonstrated by Skoog and Miller (1957) with tobacco callus. When 
the ratio of auxins to cytokinins in the culture medium was high, the calluses 
were induced to form roots. Conversely, a low ratio of auxins to citokinins 
induced the formation of shoots. Intermediate ratios promoted the growth 
as callus. 
For some plant species it has not yet been possible to regenerate plants 
from protoplasts, and in these cases protocols have been designed to trans- 
form ernbryogenic explants rather than protoplasts. When using embryo- 
genic explants, it may be necessary for the foreign DNA to travel through 
several layers before reaching the cells that will originate the germ line, 
and for this reason the DNA coating very small particles or tungsten or 
gold is delivered into the target cells using an explosive force. This approach 
has been used successfully on maize and soybean. 
VI. TISSUE- AND ORGANELLE-SPECIFIC EXPRESSION 
A promoter used for many applications in plant molecular biology is 
that from the cauliflower mosaic virus S35, which is very strongly expressed 
in plant cells, but this promoter does not provide the control over transcrip- 
tion required for successful expression. To express a foreign gene or to 
overexpress an endogenous gene it is essential to be able to control tran- 
scription. The best way to obtain this control is to use the plants own 
promoters, and the first step is to characterize these promoters. 
Promoter sequences have been isolated and fused to reporter genes so 
that the expression pattern can be monitored easily. Many promoters that 
differ in their expression pattern with respect to tissues, environmental 
conditions, or developmental stages have been characterized following 
this approach. 

STARCH SYNTKESIS PATHWAY REGULATION 
129 
Another problem in protein expression is how to obtain a subcellular 
targetting. The plant cells (like all eukaryotic cells) consist of several com- 
partments (e.g., nucleus, chloroplasts, mitochondria). The proteins that 
are expressed in compartments other than the cytosol usually have signal 
sequences that direct them to their subcellular destination. To direct a 
protein to the desired compartment, a fusion is effected between the signal 
sequence and the mature protein. Many such signal sequences have been 
identified and are available to direct proteins to practically any com- 
partment. 
VII. ANTISENSE TECHNOLOGY 
Genes encoding enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis or other relevant 
pathways (e.g., synthesis of sucrose) can be used for the overexpression of 
enzyme activity, as described in this chapter for ADPGlc PPase. Another 
approach is the use of antisense (complementary) DNA or RNA to decrease 
gene expression, a good way to assess the role of an enzyme and whether 
it limits the rate of the overall pathway. 
A chimeric gene encoding antisense RNA for ADPGlc PPase, reducing 
the expression of the enzyme (Miiller-Rober ef al., 1992) to between 2 and 
5% of the wild type, reduced starch content of potato tubers by the same 
percentage; the number of tubers increased, but their weight decreased. 
In wild type potatoes the amylose content varies from 18 to 23%, but 
potato plants with altered starch composition and content have been ob- 
tained by a number of different approaches. By using the antisense technol- 
ogy for genes encoding granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) and 
branching enzyme, potato starches with different ratios of amylose and 
amylopectin were obtained (Visser et al., 1991). Using antisense technology 
to decrease the expression of Waxy protein, it was seen that the amount 
of amylose deposited in the starch granule was related to the activity of 
the GBSS protein. The little amylose present in starch granules from such 
tubers was shown to be located at the hilum of the granule in a core of 
varying size that is surrounded by amylose-free starch (Visser ef al., 1991). 
To test the hypothesis that phosphate supply from the can limit the rate 
of photosynthesis (Sivak and Walker, 1986), antisense experiments were 
performed by Schultz et al. (1993). A cDNA for the potato triose phosphate 
translocator was identified and a fragment of this cDNA in reverse orienta- 
tion was expressed in trangenic potato plants under the control of the 
constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter (Rismeier et al., 1993). 
This experiment confirmed that Pi supply can limit photosynthesis since a 

130 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
reduction of just 30% of Pi transport activity resulted in a decrease of 50% 
in the maximum rate of photosynthesis. As predicted (Sivak and Walker, 
1986), this limitation if Pi supply also resulted in an accumulation of transi- 
tory starch in the leaves. 
VIII. OTHER USES OF GENE TECHNOLOGY 
Foreign enzymes-that 
is, with no plant equivalent. have been introduced 
into plants; one of the uses of this approach was to address the nature of 
sucrose transport into the phloem. An invertase derived from the yeast 
enzyme was targetted to the cell wall of tobacco, potato, tomato, and A. 
thaliana (Sonnewald et al., 1994). The introduction of invertase decreased 
vield, presumably through the inhibition of sucrose transport. 
The inorganic pyrophosphatase of E. coli was expressed in the cytosol 
of transgenic tobacco and potato plants, using the constitutive promoter 
of 35s cauliflower mosaic virus and the poly-A site of the octopine synthase 
gene terminator. Pyrophosphatase activity increased twofold in the trans- 
genic plants relative to the controls, and the concentrations of pyrophos- 
phate and pyruvate (indicating flow of photosynthates towards glycolysis) 
decreased. Sucrose content increased more than tenfold in the source leaves 
of the transgenic tobacco plants. 
It should be noted that it is not enough to increase the amount of enzyme 
protein in a plant tissue to ensure higher activity of the enzyme. This is 
because individual enzymes may be regulated by several metabolites and the 
concentration of these cannot be controlled easily. Also, plant metabolism is 
integrated in ways that may escape control by the plant technologist, and 
altering one pathway may somehow affect alternative pathways in unpre- 
dictable ways. For example, Zrenner et al. (1993) managed to reduce the 
amount of UDPGlc PPase in potato tuber to just 4% of the wild-type level 
without any visible effect on carbohydrate metabolism. 
Genetic modification of many dicotyledoneous crops such as potato using 
gene transfer via A. tumefaciens is, at present, an efficient and reliable 
technique: the application of the antisense route to limit or neutralize the 
action of undesirable genes has also been applied successfully to potatoes. 
Conversely, for monocotyledoneous crops such as maize, wheat, and rice, 
transformation can be accomplished by the much less efficient particle gun 
technique. This technique has been improved, resulting in rapid progress 
in the development of maize and later wheat with improved agronomic 
properties and/or altered starch composition. 
Modification of wheat is also hampered for commercial reasons: unlike 
maize, wheat seeds have no male sterility, allowing the farmer to obtain 

STARCH SYNTHESIS PATHWAY REGULATION 
131 
new seeds from his wheat harvest. Introduction of male sterility into wheat 
by genetic engineering would make wheat breeding as attractive economi- 
cally as maize breeding. In wheat the large variation in starch granule size 
is a negative factor for optimal use of wheat starch, a characteristic that is 
unlikely to be modified by conventional breeding and is awaiting a more 
original approach. 
The information provided in this chapter is limited not only by matters 
of space and relevance, but also by an additional reason. A number of 
biotechnological companies and institutions are working in the develop- 
ment of new cultivars with altered starch compositions. Research done by, 
or on behalf of, commercial enterprises generally is not published in refered 
journals and is kept secret by the companies until applying for a patent. 
This policy of secrecy clearly slows down the dissemination of scientific 
information and deprives scientists of the very helpful peer review (affecting 
negatively the quality of the research). This tendency, unfortunately, is 
likely to become more dominant. Limited information is sometimes offered 
in scientific conferences, but hard data are often missing. 
Most of our knowledge on storage starch and its biosynthetic enzymes 
comes from crop plants that have been genetically manipulated to increase 
starch content for thousands of years through plant breeding. It would not 
be surprising, then, if some of the peculiarities of the genetics of ADPGlc 
PPase (number of gene families; even variations in subcellular localization) 
were “artifacts“ introduced by the selection towards high yield and high 
starch selection pressure by humans. 
IX. TRANSFORMATION OF PLANTS WITH AN Escherichia coli 
ALLOSTERIC MUTANT glg C GENE INCREASES STARCH CONTENT 
As discussed in the chapter, “The Biosynthetic Reactions of Starch Syn- 
thesis,” there is a preponderanc: of evidence indicating that the rate- 
limiting and regulatory enzyme of starch synthesis in algae or bacterial 
glycogen synthesis is the ADPGlc PPase. With respect to higher plants, 
control analysis experiments have shown that ADPGlc PPase is important 
in the regulation of leaf starch synthesis (see the chapter, “Starch Accumula- 
tion in Photosynthesis Cells). Also, reduced ADPGlc PPase activity in 
mutants led to a reduction in the rate of starch synthesis in potato tubers 
(Miiller-Rober et al., 1992). Therefore, it was of interest to see if the starch 
content in a plant could be augmented by increased expression of activity 
of one of the enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis. Overexpression of 
a plant ADPGlc PPase activity, however, would require the expression of 
two distinct genes to reconstitute its ADPGlc PPase activity. Moreover, it 

132 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
is possible that the plant would compensate for the overexpression by 
altering the ratio of the effector metabolites, 3PGA and Pi, so that starch 
synthesis would not increase. Thus, a different strategy was chosen: an E. 
coli ADPGlc PPase, glg C gene of allosteric mutant 618, referred to as Glg 
C16 (Leung et al., 1986), which encodes for an enzyme independent of the 
presence of activator for activity was used for the transformation. Expres- 
sion of the bacterial mutant gene would have two advantages. Only one 
gene has to be expressed for ADPGlc PPase activity, and the mutant 
enzyme would be less sensitive to inhibition by its allosteric inhibitor, 
S'AMP, insensitive to the inhibitor of the plant enzyme, Pi and independent 
of the activator for good activity (Leung et al., 1986) (Table I). A collabora- 
tion with the Monsanto group was initiated to transfect plant systems with 
Glg C16 to see if the starch content of plants could be increased (Stark et al., 
1992). Because starch synthesis occurs in the plastid, a nucleotide sequence 
encoding the transit peptide of the A. thaliana ribulose 1,S-bisphosphate 
carboxylase chloroplast transit peptide was fused to the translation initiation 
site of the gig C16 gene (Fig. 1). A promoter was also needed; the chimeric 
gene was cloned behind a cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV)-enhanced 35s 
promoter, or a tuber-specific patatin promoter, or, in the case of tomato 
plants, the Arabidopsls plant promoter from the rbcS gene was used (Stark 
et al., 1992; Fig. 1). A polyadenylation signal from the nopaline synthase 
gene (Nos) was fused on at the 3' end of the chimeric gene. The chimeric 
gene-containing promoter was placed in a cloning vector with a 35s- 
neomycin phosphotransferase gene as a selectable marker (Stark et a!., 
1992) and was used for the transformation of tobacco calli, tomato cotyle- 
dons, and potato plants.

ribulose bis-P carboxylase gene modified to have an extra cleavage site to eliminate the 23 
amino acids of the N-terminal of the small subunit (Stark ef al., 1992) to prevent its possible 
interference with the catalytic or regulatory activity of the glg C16 gene product. The Nos 
terminator is the nopaline synthase 3’ poly A signal. The promoter can be either a constitutive 
promoter or a tissue-specific promoter. 
In tobacco calli where the glgC gene product activity was detected, starch 
content was 1.7 to 8.7 times higher than in the controls lacking the glgC 
gene product (Stark et al., 1992). The Cam-chimeric gene was electropor- 
ated into tobacco protoplasts, and extracts of the transformed protoplasts 
gave rise to ADPGlc synthesis resistant to Pi inhibition and activated by 
fructose 1,6-bis-P (Table I). The synthesis of ADPGlc in the control proto- 
plast extract was totally inhibited by Pi as expected since the tobacco and 
almost all plant ADPGlc PPases are most sensitive to inhibition by Pi. When 
the transgenic tobacco was examined by light microscopy and was compared 
with control calli, it showed a large increase in the number of starch granules 
(Stark et al., 1992). Similarly, when tomato was transformed, with a construct 
transit peptide-Glg C16 gene, shoots excised from calli stained black with 
iodine reagent, whereas the controls were essentially negative. 
Similar results have been obtained for Russet-Burbank potato tubers in 
which the chimeric gene, with its transit peptide under the control of a 
tuber-specific patatin promoter, increased starch in the tuber 25 to 60% 
over controls not containing the bacterial enzyme (Stark et al., 1992; Table 
11). If the bacterial ADPGlc PPase Glg C16 gene was expressed in the 
tuber lacking the transit peptide gene portion, no increase in starch content 
was noted (Table 11). Probably, ADPGlc PPase was expressed, but was 
not present in the amyloplast and, for this reason, was not able to supply 
ADPGlc to the starch synthases that are localized in the amyloplast. 
A positive relationship between the expression levels of the ADPGlc 
PPase of Glg C16, as measured by immunoblotting of the potato extracts, 
and the increase in starch content was demonstrated, particularly in tubers 
at lower ranges of starch content. Lower levels of the expressed ADPGlc 
PPase resulted in increases of 21 to 63% in starch, intermediate levels of 
the expressed ADPGlc PPase gave increases of 33 to 118% in starch, and

the high expressed levels of the transit peptide-Clg C16 resulted in increases 
of 33 to 167%. It is of interest that when the wild-type E. coli ADPGlc 
PPase gene was expressed in the tuber, no increase in starch was noted 
(Table 11). Thus, an important factor in increasing starch synthesis is to 
transform the tuber with an ADPGlc PPase with allosteric properties opti- 
mized to permit higher rates of ADPGlc synthesis under physiologic condi- 
tions. 
X. ARE OTHER STARCH BIOSYNTHETIC 
ENZYMES RATE LIMITING? 
Smith (1988) showed that in mutant rr pea leaves, in high light intensity, 
there was a 40% decrease in the rate of starch synthesis. A control coefficient 
analysis reported later (Smith et al., 1990) showed that in low light intensity, 
there was essentially no effect on the rate of starch synthesis, whereas in 
high light intensity, the flux control coefficient value was 0.13, which is a 
small value (meaning very little control) and is only one-fifth the value 
seen for ADPGlc PPase (Neuhaus and Stitt, 1990). Thus an 86% reduction 
of branching enzyme activity had a small effect on regulation of starch syn- 
thesis. 
It has been suggested that when plants are subjected to high temperature, 
starch synthase activity may be rate limiting. At temperatures higher than 
30T, both maize (Singletary et al., 1994) and wheat endosperm (Hawker 
and Jenner. 1993; Keeling et al., 1993, 1994: Jenner, 1994) had a reduction 
of starch deposition as compared with lower temperatures. In wheat, the 
starch biosynthetic enzyme affected was soluble starch synthase (SSS). 

STARCH SYNTHESIS PATHWAY REGULATION 
135 
Using flux control coefficient analysis, Keeling el al. (1993) showed a control 
coefficient close to 1 between the rate of starch synthesis and the level of 
starch synthase activity in wheat endosperm extracts. It was also shown 
that in vitro, the endosperm starch synthase activity was sensitive to heat 
treatment in the range of 30 to 40°C if the treatment was for longer than 
15 minutes. A similar study with maize endosperm showed a reduction of 
starch synthetic rate and a decrease in starch synthase activity in the heat- 
stressed maize endosperm (Singletary er al., 1994). It was also noted, how- 
ever, that in the heat-stressed maize, the endosperm ADPGlc PPase activity 
was also reduced to an even greater extent than the SSS (Singletary et 
al., 1994). 
Thus, in wheat and maize, under some environmental conditions, there 
might be a correlation between reduction of starch synthase activity and 
decreased starch synthesis. However, as the data obtained with maize sug- 
gest (Singletary et al., 1994), other unknown factors, beside starch synthase 
activity, may be the primary reason for the reduction of starch synthesis 
in the heat-stressed plants. In the case of maize endosperm, another enzyme 
involved in starch synthesis. ADPGlc PPase, is also affected in the heat- 
stressed plant. It is also possible that other critical steps leading to starch 
biosynthesis are affected in both plants, such as carbon flow from source 
to sink tissues and invertase activity. Those processes were not studied in 
the heat-stressed plants. Thus, we believe that the published evidence does 
not warrant the designation of starch synthase as a major control point. Flux 
control coefficients for an enzyme within a process can only be determined if 
the activity of only that enzyme is affected. In the case of heat-stressed 
plants, it has not yet been shown that only the starch synthase activity is 
affected. A crucial test is whether the starch synthetic rate can be increased 
by overexpressing soluble starch synthase activity in the amyloplast. As 
shown in the preceding, starch accumulation can be increased by expressing 
a bacterial ADPGlc PPase allosteric mutant in plants (Stark et al., 1992). 
XI. OTHER PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF MANIPULATION OF 
STARCH SYNTHESIS 
Starch phosphorylase and amylolytic enzymes are responsible for starch 
degradation during cold storage of potato tubers (see the chapter, “Starch 
Degradation”), and result in the formation of glucose-1-P and glucose from 
starch. Glucose-1-P may also be formed from the products of degradation 
of sucrose via invertase or sucrose synthase. Sugar accumulation, or “sweet- 
ening,” decreases the quality of the tubers and makes them unsuitable €or 
frying. Also, accumulation of sugars is eventually followed by the end of 

136 
MlRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
dormancy, which is signaled by the onset of respiration and sprouting. 
Barry et af. (1994) found that by overexpressing ADPG PPase during cold 
storage they could delay cold sweetening and sprouting. They proposed 
that ADPG PPase would act as an active sink for the glucose-1-P and 
glucose (which can be converted into glucose-1-P) products of starch degra- 
dation and the ADPGlc formed is then converted back into starch. Overex- 
pression of ADPG PPase during cold storage is achieved by a variation of 
the method used by Stark er al. (1992) and by using an A. thaliana cold- 
inducible promoter. The potato tubers obtained in this manner had better 
frying properties than the control after cold storage. 
Giroux et af. (1996) described the effect of a single gene mutation in the 
shrunken 2 locus of maize (coding for the large subunit of the ADPGlc 
PPase), which involved the addition of 2 amino acids-tyrosine 
and serine. 
The mutation decreased the sensitivity of the enzyme to inhibition by 
phosphate and was introduced by using an in vivo, site-specific mutagenesis 
system that involved the use of the transposable element ds (dissociation). 
The mutated gene, named Rev6, increased seed weight by 11 to 18% without 
changing the proportion of the seed weight taken by starch. The authors 
proposed that increased ADPGlc PPase activity would affect the overall 
sink strength of the seeds, as it increased not just starch content but also 
other constituents of the seed. 
XII. CONCLUSIONS 
It is conceivable that methodology such as that used to increase starch 
quantity could be used to influence starch quality by manipulation of starch 
synthase and branching isoforms. These “new starches” may have greater 
usefulness in food and industrial processes. The production of modified 
”specialty” starches via molecular biology techniques is promising, and 
perhaps more beneficial and more economical than the chemical modifica- 
tion of starch for industrial purposes. 
Because there has been an increased demand for starch for both special- 
ized industrial and food uses since the mid-1980s (Katz, 1991), it appears 
that the study of basic questions on the structure-function relationships of 
the allosteric regulation of an enzyme involved in sugar nucleotide synthesis 
now may have a great impact on both agriculture and industry. It is of 
interest that this research on the routes and mechanism of regulation of 
bacterial glycogen and starch synthesis at the molecular level, which began 
in the mid-1960s. has led to opportunities for improving the quality of the 
uses for starch in industrial and food processes. This was never the original 
purpose of the studies, but is an example of how basic science, which 

STARCH SYNTHESIS PATHWAY REGULATION 
137 
tries to answer basic questions, may lead to methods where nature can be 
manipulated for beneficial purposes. 
In addition to altering quantity, starch quality could be changed via 
expression of the isoforms of starch synthase and branching enzymes in 
plants. These “designer” starches would be used in the food and other 
industries. One possible approach to modifying starch structure in a crop 
would be the replacement of the plant branching isozymes with other 
different properties. The foreign enzyme could be a chimeric construct. 
Although construction of chimeric enzymes is done to elucidate the 
domains that determine the different properties of the isoforms (see the 
chapter, “Branching Enzymes”), a secondary benefit is that novel enzymes 
may be capable of branching starch differently than the wild-type enzymes, 
resulting in the production of starch with novel properties.

STARCH ACCUMULATION IN PHOTOSYNTHETIC CELLS 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The classic equation for photosynthesis is often written as 
6C02 + 6Hz0 -+ C6HI2O6 + 602 
(1) 
The most likely end product, designated in the equation by C6HI2O6, is not 
actually hexose. Originally, starch seemed the most likely end product, and 
the historic observations of Sachs, Pfeffer, and Godlewski established an inti- 
mate relationship between photosynthesis and the process of starch accumu- 
lation in green leaves (see Rabinowitch, 1945). However, even in the time of 
Sachs, it was known that some plants do not accumulate starch within their 
leaves under any circumstances and, in addition, an almost insoluble polysac- 
charide could clearly not be moved about the plant. Eventually, it became 
increasingly accepted that sucrose was the real end product of photosynthesis 
(Rabinowitch, 1956), whereas starch was relegated to the role of a temporary 
storage compound. Even when it became evident that sugar phosphates 
played a central role in photosynthetic carbon metabolism (Benson et al., 
1950,1952; Benson and Calvin, 1950; Bassham and Calvin, 1957), sugarphos- 
phates were regarded as intermediates. Conversely, the percentage of radio- 
active carbon in sucrose extrapolated to zero at zero time, and the percentage 
increased thereafter in a way that might have been predicted for an end prod- 
uct awaiting movement to other parts of the plant. 
The rate of photosynthesis does not depend on the amount of a single 
component (e.g., the activity of a particular enzyme). There is a wide range 
of possible regulatory factors, proven to exist in vitro, but the importance 
of which in vivo has still to be determined. In particular, there is a multitude 
of factors affecting the activity of the enzymes involved, with pH, ions, 
coenzymes, and metabolite effectors modulating the activity of every en- 
zyme studied thus far. Compartmentation is the other key factor. The role 
of metabolite transport in the cell, particularly between chloroplast and 
cytosol, but also to and from mitochondria, vacuole, and other organelles, 
is now considered to be fundamental to the regulation of photosynthesis. 
In this chapter, we look at the factors considered to be of major importance 
139

in the determination of the nature of the products of photosynthesis, and 
we look at the partition of carbon and energy between sucrose and starch. 
II. THE REDUCTIVE PENTOSE PHOSPHATE PATHWAY 
The reductive pentose phosphate pathway (RPPP), also called the 
Benson-Calvin cycle, is the only pathway in plants that can catalyze the 
net fixation of C02. The entire cycle can be divided into three phases 
(Fig. 1): 
1. Carboxylation of ribulose-lJ-bisphosphate by ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate 
carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) with the formation of two molecules of 
glycerate-3-P. 
2. Reduction of the two molecules of glycerate-3-P to triose phosphate 
at the expense of 2 ATP and 2 NADPH. 
3. Regeneration of the primary acceptor, RuBP, from triose phosphate 
in the sugar phosphate shuffle. 
Autocatalysis is a crucial property of the FWPP, and it refers to the 
fact that the product, triose phosphate, can be recycled, generating more 
substrate for carboxylation. If the cycle turns over five times, the amount 
of the primary acceptor, RuBP, doubles. During steady-state photosynthesis 
(after the induction is over), one-sixth of the triose phosphate generated 
from C02 is available for product synthesis. There is, however, a relatively 
major drain on fixed carbon because photorespiration results in the net 
loss of carbon and energy. Photorespiration refers to the fact that C3 plants 
evolve COP when illuminated in C02-free air (apparently, it is absent in 
C4 plants). Glycollate is considered the primary substrate of this “light 
respiration”: Rubisco is a branch point between photorespiratory and pho- 
tosynthetic metabolism. Oxygen, reacting with RuBP, leads to glycollate 
synthesis and photorespiration, whereas C02, reacting with RuBP, leads 
to photosynthesis. The glycollate formed by Rubisco when it oxygenates 
RuBP cannot be used directly in the RPPP, although it is salvaged to some 
extent by the photorespiratory pathway. 
Some of the triose phosphate available for product synthesis will be 
transported into the cytosol and converted into sucrose (Fig. 2). In both 
photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic cells, sucrose is synthesized via su- 
crose phosphate synthase, which catalyses the reaction 
UDP-glucose + fructose-6-phosphate + sucrose-6-phosphate + UDP. 
The sucrose phosphate formed is hydrolyzed by a specific phosphatase to

FIG. 1. The reactions that lead to the regeneration of RuBP and the formation of triose 
phosphate. On the right, three molecules of RuBP combine with three molecules of C02 and 
three molecules of water to give six molecules of PGA. These are phosphorylated at the 
expense of ATP, and the resulting DPGA is reduced by NADPH to G3P. The major part 
of this is converted to its isomer DHAP. Aldol condensation of these two triose phosphates 
give a molecule of FBP, which undergoes hydrolysis to F6P. This hexose phosphate is also 
the precursor of G6P and GlP, which, after further transformation, give rise to starch. The 
F6P also enters the first transketolase reaction donating a 2-carbon unit to G3P to form XuSP 
and E4P. The process of condensation, phosphorylation, and 2-carbon transfer is repeated, 
yielding SBP, S7P, and two more molecules of pentose phosphate, respectively. All three 
molecules of pentose monophosphate are finally converted to RuSP, which is phosphorylated 
to RuBP. 
give free sucrose. The formation of UDPglucose is analogous to the forma- 
tion of ADPglucose in starch synthesis. 
It is worth noting that the two sucrose metabolizing enzymes, sucrose 
synthase and sucrose-phosphate synthase, were both discovered by Leloir 
and Cardini (1955) (see “Preface”). 
There is yet another possible route for the triose phosphate formed in 
the RPPP, and that is starch synthesis within the chloroplast. Stromal starch

is formed primarily from triose phosphate released from the RPPP. If triose 
phosphate is retained within the chloroplast, the initial reactions are the 
same as those involved in sucrose synthesis in the cytoplasm (i.e., a propor- 
tion of the triose phosphate undergoes aldol condensation to Frul ,6P2, 
which is then hydrolyzed to Fru6P). This is then converted into its isomer 
by hexose phosphate isomerase. In the reaction catalyzed by phosphogluco- 
mutase, Glc6P is converted into GlclP. At equilibrium, a mixture of the 
enzymes mentioned previously would yield hexose phosphates in the pro- 
portions of approximately Fru6P (9) to Glc6P (17) to GlclP (1). Although 
these reactions are considered freely reversible, the overall equilibrium 
may still be important in determining the distribution of carbon between 
starch and pentose monophosphate in the illuminated chloroplast. Both 
Fru6P and triose phosphate are substrates for the first transketolase reac- 
tion, and this, in turn, influences the amount of triose phosphate entering 
the second aldolase condensation and the second transketolase reaction. 
An active sink for GlclP would therefore tend to deflect carbon toward 
starch. This sink could be provided by ADPGlc PPase, which catalyses 
the reaction 
glucose-1-P + ATP + ADPglucose + PPi 
when low external Pi decreases triose phosphate and PGA export. 
Few studies on the localization of the starch biosynthetic enzymes were 
done before 1978, when it was found that ADPGlc PPase was located 
exclusively in the chloroplast fraction in both spinach (Mares et al., 1978) 
and pea (Levi and Preiss, 1978). The first detailed study was done by Okita 
et al. (1979), in which spinach leaf chloroplasts were isolated either by 
differential centrifugation (Walker, 1971; see also later) or from protoplasts 
(Nishimura et al., 1976). These plastid preparations contained essentially 
all of the activity of the starch biosynthetic enzymes, ADPGlc PPase, starch 
synthase, and branching enzyme. Subsequently, in guard cells of Cornrnelina 
comrnunis, Robinson and Preiss (1987) showed that the starch biosynthetic 
enzymes were present exclusively in the chloroplast fraction. 
Ill. THE CHLOROPLAST AS A TRANSPORTING ORGANELLE 
The chloroplast must operate its carbon cycle as an autocatalytic breeder 
reaction, but it must export elaborated carbon and chemical energy to its 
cellular environment. In order to export, it must produce more than it uses, 
but can only do this by returning newly synthesized intermediates to the 
cycle. In order to satisfy the needs of the cell, it must release newly made 
products to the cytoplasm. These competing processes can be accomplished 

1 44 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
efficiently because the choloroplast keeps a delicate balance among recycl- 
ing, export, and internal storage. 
Chloroplasts are enclosed by two membranes. The outer membrane is 
freely permeable to small molecules (up to about 10 kDa) due to the 
presence of a porin and the inner membrane is the osmotic barrier and the 
site where specific transport occurs. The specificity of envelope permeability 
is strikingly highlighted by the contrast between Pi and PPi, the former 
being among the most rapidly translocated molecules and the latter among 
those to which the envelope is relatively impermeable. Carrier-mediated 
anion transport can be classified as: 
1. Electroneutral, involving exchange of one anion with another of equal 
charge 
2. Electroneutral proton compensated, in which the different charge is 
compensated by cotransport of a proton 
3. Electrogenic, involving an exchange between anions of different charges 
(which requires energy as membrane potential or proton electrochemi- 
cal gradient) 
The study of transport by isolated chloroplasts requires the use of “good” 
organelles. and the criteria for this are photosynthetic rate and chloroplast 
intactness. If isolated chloroplasts are capable of rapid electron transport 
and photophosphorylation, but have lost the ability to assimilate CO? when 
illuminated in a suitable reaction mixture, they have then been damaged 
or have been irreversibly inhibited during isolation. Because there is often 
a clear correlation between envelope integrity and function, results obtained 
with relatively inactive chloroplasts are unlikely to reflect the behavior of 
chloroplasts in situ. 
Techniques developed with the aim of separating intact chloroplasts from 
leaf tissues (Walker. 1971) yield preparations containing, on average, some 
70 to 80% (or higher, depending on the species and quality of the material) 
of class A chloroplasts (Hall, 1972). 
IV. CONTROL OF CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM 
During the day, the rates of starch and sucrose synthesis and the rate of 
photosynthetic carbon assimilation must be coordinated. There is a clear 
need to determine how much assimilated carbon can be diverted into 
sucrose and starch synthesis without decreasing too much the amount that 
returns to the RPPP. Conversely, when sucrose accumulates in the cytosol 
because the rate of export diminishes (and/or photosynthesis increases), 
starch begins to accumulate inside the chloroplast. During the night, the 

STARCH ACCUMULATION IN PHOTOSYNTHETIC CELLS

sucrose accumulated in the vacuole during the day and the starch accumu- 
lated in the chloroplast are remobilized to be used to support the metabo- 
lism of the leaf itself or to be exported as sucrose (Stitt et al., 1987a). 
Stromal amylases and phosphorylases degrade starch, and GlclP is then 
converted into triose phosphate, which can be exported from the chloro- 
plast. 
In this way, photosynthates are constantly available. The importance of 
these remobilization mechanisms is highlighted when they are disturbed. 
For example, mutants of the crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana, which are unable 
to synthesize starch but can still synthesize sucrose, grow at the same rate 
as the wild type under continuous light, but the growth rate is drastically 
diminished if placed in a day-night regime (Caspar er al., 1986). 
V. REGULATION OF THE ADPGlc PATHWAY IN 
THE CHLOROPLAST 
As discussed elsewhere (see the chapter, “Synthesis of the Glucosyl 
Donor: ADPglucose Pyrophosphorylase”), for every leaf system studied, 
whether the leaf source is from a plant using the C3 or C4 pathway or 
Crassulacean metabolism, the major activator is still 3PGA and the 
inhibitor is Pi. There is much evidence obtained in vitro suggesting that 
ADPGlc synthesis is regulated by activation of the plant ADPGlc PPase 
by 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA) and inhibition by Pi. In vivo and in situ 
experiments showed a correlation between the concentrations of 3PGA 
and starch, and inverse correlations between Pi and starch levels (see 
the chapter, “Regulation of the Starch Synthesis Pathway: Targets for 
Biotechnology”). 
The increasing availability of mutant and transgenic plants now facilitates 
the study of how plant metabolism is controlled. In particular, control 
analysis involves asking how much a flux changes for a given change in 
enzyme activity, such that the flux control coefficient. 
UlJ 
c,, = - 
dElE 
In this equation, E is the original amount of enzyme, J is the original 
pathway flux, and dJ is the change that results from a relatively small change 
in the amount of the enzyme dE. For an enzyme in a simple, unbranched 
pathway, if CJE = 1, then CJE can vary between 0 (no control) to 1 (total 
control), that particular enzyme limits the rate of the overall pathway (see 
Kacser and Burns, 1973; Heinrich and Rapoport, 1974). 

146 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
The availability of chloroplast mutants of phosphoglucose isomerase of 
Clarkia xuntiana (Kruckeberg et al., 1989; Neuhaus et al., 1989), of phospho- 
glucomutase (Caspar et al., 1986), and of ADPGlc PPase of A. thaliuna 
(Lin el al., 1988a,b; Neuhaus and Stitt, 1990). has allowed the analysis of the 
extent of control that these enzymes exert on chloroplast starch synthesis. 
Mutant plants with reduced activity of both cytosolic (64%, 36%, 18% of 
wild type) and chloroplastic (75%, 50% of wild type) phosphoglucoisomer- 
ase were used to determine the effect of these enzymes on fluxes toward 
starch and sucrose synthesis as well as on photosynthetic rate and control 
coefficients (Kacser and Burns, 1973; Kruckeberg et al., 1989). The plastid 
phosphoglucoisomerase exerted little control over starch or sucrose synthe- 
sis in low light, but did exert control of starch synthesis in saturating light. 
Lowering the cytosolic enzyme activity had little effect on either starch or 
sucrose synthesis in saturating light, but increased starch synthetic rate and 
decreased sucrose synthesis in low light. Thus variation of the cytosolic 
phosphoglucoisomerase affected the partitioning of carbon between sucrose 
and starch. Further studies (Neuhaus et al., 1989) confirmed that reduction 
of plastid phosphoglucoisomerase had little effect in low light, but reduced 
starch synthesis by 50% in saturating light with no corresponding increase 
in sucrose synthesis. Reduced levels of cytosolic enzyme (18% of wild 
type) lowered the sucrose synthetic rates and increased the rate of starch 
synthesis. Metabolite levels were also affected in these mutants. In the 
mutant containing only 18% of the wild type cytosolic phosphoglucoisomer- 
ase activity. both fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and 3PGA levels increased ap- 
proximately 100%. Neuhaus et al. (1989) suggested that the lower rate of 
sucrose synthesis rate is due to the increased Fru-2,6-P2 concentration, 
which causes increased inhibition of cytosolic fructose-l,6-bisphosphatase 
(for reviews on sucrose synthesis and its regulation, see ap Rees. 1987; Stitt 
ef af., 1987b). which is on the pathway toward sucrose synthesis (Fig. 2). 
Their data strongly support the view that increased starch synthesis in the 
mutants with reduced levels of phosphoglucoisomerase is due to activation 
of the ADPGlc PPase by the increased 3PGA concentration and 3PGA/ 
Pi ratio. 
These experiments have been extended to the null chloroplast phospho- 
glucomutase (Caspar el al., 1986) and the low activity (7% of wild type) 
ADPGlc PPase mutants (Lin et al., 1988a,b) of A. thaliuna. Neuhaus 
and Stitt (1990) used the alleles to construct hybrid plants containing, 
respectively, SO% of wild-type phosphoglucomutase activity and 50% of 
wild-type ADPGlc PPase activity. The effects of these reduced activities 
on starch and sucrose fluxes and on C 0 2  fixation in low-light and 
high-light intensities were measured. In low light, a SO% decrease in 
phosphoglucomutase activity had no significant effect on the fluxes 

STARCH ACCUMULATION IN PHOTOSYNTHETIC CELLS 
147 
mentioned previously. However, a 50% and 93% decrease of ADPGlc 
PPase activity resulted in a 23% and 74% decrease in flux of starch 
synthesis, with a concomitant increase of a 17% and 42% increase in 
sucrose synthetic rate. Thus, a decrease in the synthesis of ADPGlc 
not only affected starch synthesis but also affected the partitioning of 
photosynthetic carbon, causing more to be directed toward sucrose 
biosynthesis. In high light a 50% decrease in phosphoglucomutase activity 
resulted in a 20% decrease in starch synthesis with little effect on the 
sucrose synthesis rate. However, reduction of the the ADPGlc synthesizing 
activity by 50% and 93% resulted in a 39% and 90% decrease in starch 
synthesis flux. The flux of photosynthetic carbon under these conditions 
was not redirected toward sucrose synthesis but rather the photosynthetic 
rate was inhibited approximately 46%. The flux control coefficients (Burns 
et al., 1985) for the enzymes for starch synthesis were calculated to 
determine the distribution of control and were compared with previous 
results obtained with the C. xantiuna phosphoglucoisomerase. 
A kinetic model was developed by Petersson and Ryde-Peterson (1989) 
that was consistent with the metabolite concentrations and mass action 
ratios measured in vivo and with enzyme properties and equilibria. These 
authors reached the conclusion that 3PGA and Pi play important roles in 
regulating starch synthesis with significant contributions made by ATP, 
glucose-1-P, and fructose-6-P. Since these metabolites are either substrates 
or effectors of the ADPGlc PPase, the analysis is consistent with the view 
that 3PGA is a positive effector and Pi is a negative effector of ADPGlc 
synthesis and, therefore, that the 3PGA/Pi ratio regulates starch synthesis 
via regulation of ADPGlc PPase. 
In summary, analysis of the starch biosynthetic system in a number of 
plants or using data obtained in vivo from different plants and applying 
the control analysis method of Kacser and Burns (1973; see also Kacser, 
1987) show that the major site of regulation of starch synthesis is at ADPGlc 
PPase and that 3PGA and Pi are important regulatory metabolites of that 
enzyme. A decisive proof that this regulatory mechanism is functional in 
vivo would be the isolation of a plant containing an ADPGlc PPase with 
altered allosteric properties that would correlate with its starch content. 
So far, such mutations have not been found in higher plants but have been 
reported for E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium (reviewed in Preiss and 
Romeo, 1989), and for Chlumydomonas reinhardtii. Ball and his collabora- 
tors at Lille have obtained mutants of this unicellular green algae that have 
an ADPGlc PPase with a low sensitivity to PGA activation; these mutants 
display a low starch content. The genetic manipulation of either the struc- 
tural or regulatory genes of the starch biosynthetic enzymes may provide 
means for alteration of the starch levels in a plant, and a significant advance

is described in the chapter, “Regulation of the Starch Synthesis Pathway: 
Targets for Biotechnology.” 
VI. STARCH SYNTHESIS IN YOUNG LEAVES 
In young developing leaves that still behave as sinks (rather than sources), 
sucrose is first hydrolyzed in the cytosol by the action of the invertase or by 
the sucrose synthase followed by UDPGlc pyrophosphorylase. The hexose 
sugars formed are then metabolized via glycolysis into C3 intermediates 
that are then transported into the chloroplast via the Pi translocator, where 
they can be used or stored as starch. 
VII. SYNTHESIS OF STARCH AND SUCROSE IN C, PLANTS 
The C3 cycle can be viewed as an ATP-dependent C02 pump that delivers 
COz from the mesophyll cells to the bundle-sheath cells, thereby suppress- 
ing photorespiration (Hatch and Osmond, 1976). The development of the 
C4 syndrome has resulted in considerable modifications of inter- and intra- 
cellular transport processes. Perhaps the most striking development with 
regard to the formation of assimilates is that sucrose and starch formation 
are not only compartmented within cells, but in C4 plants also may be 
largely compartmented between mesophyll and bundle-sheath cells. This 
has been achieved together with a profound alteration of the Benson-Calvin 
cycle function, in that 3PGA reduction is shared between the bundle-sheath 
and mesophyll chloroplasts in all the C4 subtypes. Moreover, since C4 plants 
are polyphyletic in origin, several different metabolic and structural answers 
have arisen in response to the same problem of how to concentrate COz. 
C4 plants have three distinct mechanisms based on decarboxylation by 
NADP+-malic enzyme, by NAD +-malic enzyme, or by phosphoenolpy- 
ruvate (PEP) carboxykinase in the bundle-sheath (Hatch and Osmond, 
1976). 
Downton and Hawker (1973), showed that starch, starch synthase, 
and ADPGlc PPase were much higher in bundle-sheath cells than in 
mesophyll cells on a protein basis or on a chlorophyll basis. The mesophyll 
cell is able to synthesize starch on exposure of the leaf to continuous 
light for approximately 2.5 days. Under these conditions, starch synthase 
levels in the mesophyll cell increased. Thus the mesophyll cell is capable 
of starch synthesis under certain conditions. Later reports on other C4 
plants (e.g., nutsledge leaves, Chen et uf., 1974; Digituriu pentzii, Mbaku 
et al., 1978) also indicate that both tissues are capable of starch synthesis. 

STARCH ACCUMULATION IN PHOTOSYNTHETIC CELLS 
149 
Although starch synthase is present in both tissues, in Digitaria pentzii 
activity of the starch synthase is 10 times higher (calculated on a 
chlorophyll basis) in the bundle sheath. The studies on the maize leaf 
have been confirmed by more recent research, which is also more 
comprehensive since it also includes the measurement of branching 
enzyme activity (Preiss et al., 1985; Echeverria and Boyer, 1986; Spilatro 
and Preiss, 1987). Their results are in agreement with the earlier conclusion 
that starch and the starch biosynthetic enzymes are primarily in the 
bundle sheath. Moreover, the exclusive localization of the starch biosyn- 
thetic enzymes in the bundle sheath chloroplast has been reported 
(Echeverria and Boyer, 1986). Thus, the discovery that the leaf starch 
biosynthetic is located solely in the chloroplast is in keeping with the 
finding that starch in higher plants is found exclusively in the chloroplast. 
Although in a species such as maize the synthesis of sucrose appears to 
occur largely in the mesophyll cells: whereas the synthesis of starch occurs 
largely in the bundle-sheath cells, it is clear that there is a good deal of flexibil- 
ity both within maize and between C4plants in general. For example, although 
the mesophyll tissue of maize grown under normal conditions contains no 
detectable starch, growth of plants in continuous light induces starch forma- 
tion in the mesophyll (Downton and Hawker, 1973). However, Digitaria spp. 
(which, like maize, are also NADP+-malic enzyme-type C4 plants) synthe- 
size both sucrose and starch in the mesophyll compartment (Mbaku et al., 
1978; Hallberg and Larsson, 1983). A number of pieces of evidence support 
the contention that sucrose synthesis is confined to the mesophyll cells in 
leaves of at least some C4 plants. Bucke and Oliver (1975) and Furbank et al. 
(1985) found that the majority of the sucrose-phosphate synthesis is located 
in the mesophyll of maize, Pennisetum purpureum, and Muhlenbergiu mon- 
tuna. Other studies have shown the cytosolic fructose bisphosphatase to be 
confined largely to the mesophyll (Furbank et al., 1985) as well as Fru6P, 2- 
kinase, fructose-2,6 bisphosphatase (Sol1 et al., 1983), and fructose-2,6- 
bisphosphate itself (Stitt and Heldt, 1985). However, Ohsugi and Huber 
(1987) have shown that sucrose-phosphate synthase activity is present in 
both mesophyll and bundle-sheath cells in all C4 subtypes, including maize. 
In addition, the response of the enzyme to light was different in the two com- 
partments, with the bundle-sheath enzyme requiring higher irradiance for 
activation. Ohsugi and Huber (1987) suggest that sucrose-phosphate syn- 
thase may function in both mesophyll cells and bundle-sheath cellsfor sucrose 
synthesis in the light, particularly at high light intensity, whereas in the dark 
the major function of bundle-sheath cell sucrose-phosphate synthetase may 
be in sucrose formation following starch degradation, which is a function that 
has been largely overlooked. Perhaps the safest conclusion is that starch and 
sucrose synthesis may predominate in one or the other compartment in 

150 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
maize, but that this compartmentation may readily be overridden when envi- 
ronmental conditions (e.g., high light intensity) require it. 
VIII. THE REGULATION OF STARCH SYNTHESIS IN C, PLANTS 
A number of studies have shown that the activities of starch synthase, 
branching enzyme, and ADPGlc PPase are higher in the bundle-sheath 
cells than in the mesophyll cells. However, the enzymes of starch degrada- 
tion. starch phosphorylase, and amylase are more evenly distributed and 
are slightly higher in the mesophyll (Huber et al., 1969: Downton and 
Hawker, 1973; Echeverria and Boyer, 1986; Spilatro and Preiss, 1987). 
ADPGlc PPase from spinach is activated by 3PGA and inhibited by Pi, 
with ratios of 3PGA/Pi for half-maximal activation typically being less than 
1.5 (Ghosh and Preiss, 1966). ADPGlc PPase from maize leaves requires 
much higher ratios of 3PGA to Pi for half-maximal activation, with the 
enzyme from the mesophyll cells requiring a higher ratio (9 to 16) than 
the enzyme from the bundle-sheath cells (7 to 10) (Spilatro and Preiss. 
1987). Measurements show that 3PGA may be as high as 15 to 16 mol - 
m-3 in the bundle sheath and 5 to 7 mol . m-3 in the mesophyll (Leegood, 
1985; Stitt and Heldt, 1985) due to the requirement for metabolite gradients 
during photosynthesis. Thus 3PGA/Pi ratios in the mesophyll are likely to 
be considerably lower than in the bundle sheath. This factor, and the 
relatively low activities of the enzymes of starch synthesis in the mesophyll, 
would appear to limit synthesis of starch in the mesophyll relative to the 
bundle sheath, but this factor is a relationship that could be modified readily 
with fluctuations in physiologic and developmental conditions, and could 
therefore account for variations in the capacity of the mesophyll to 
make starch. 
IX. STARCH IN CAM PLANTS 
Metabolism in CAM plants involves the transfer of large amounts of 
carbon between two storage pools: malic acid and storage carbohydrates 
(Fig. 3). Although malate is invariably stored in the vacuole, the carbohy- 
drate store may be either chloroplastic (e.g., starch-storers such as 
Bryophyllum tubiflorum, Kalanchoe diagremontiana) or extrachloroplastic 
[as in Ananas comosus (pineapple) and Aloe arborescens]. This transfer 
of carbon involves glycolytic carbohydrate breakdown in the dark and 
gluconeogenic carbohydrate synthesis during the light. In starch-formers, 
large amounts of carbon must therefore enter the chloroplast during

FIG. 3. Operation of the C4 pathway in a NADP+-malic enzyme-type plant such as maize. 
The C4 pathways, essentially C02 concentrating mechanisms, are classified according to the 
enzyme that decarboxylates the C4 acid in the bundle-sheath chloroplast, decreasing the 
oxygenation reaction of Rubisco. In maize, the decarboxylating enzyme is a malic enzyme 
(3) that uses oxidized NADP (NADP+) as a cofactor. Hatched areas indicate carrier-mediated 
transporters of metabolites across the chloroplast envelope. Between cytosols of the two cell 
types, metabolites and phosphate move along diffusion-driven concentration gradients. For 
most reactions, cofactors and transaminations have been omitted for clarity. 1, phosphoenolpyr- 
uvate (PEP) carboxylase; 2, malate dehydrogenase; 3, malic enzyme; 4, Ribulose bisphosphate

mentation and control of sucrose and starch synthesis is greatly modified with respect to the 
scheme shown in Fig. 2 in this chapter; for example, sucrose is synthesized mainly in the 
cytosol of mesophyll cells, and starch in the chloroplasts of bundle sheath cells. 
deacidification. Fahrendorf et al. (1987) have proposed, as a working 
hypothesis, that in CAM plants (which are primarily starch-formers): 1. 
Malic enzyme is the principal decarboxylase, whereas pyruvate Pi dikinase 
is present in amounts sufficient to convert the pyruvate formed back 
into PEP; and 2. the capacity for conversion of FruBP into Fru6P in 
the cytosol is low and levels of Fru2, 6P2 are low during deacidification. 
It is suggested that this apparent paradox may be due to a very low 
affinity of the FruBPase for FruBP, as occurs in the CAM but not in

the C3 form of Mesembryanthemum crystallinurn (Keiller et al., 1987) 
nor in C4 plants such as maize (Stitt and Heldt, 1985).

ADVANCES IN FOOD AND NUTRITION RESEARCH, VOL. 41 
STARCH DEGRADATION 
I. PLANT AMYLASES AND PHOSPHORYLASES 
Many starch-degrading enzymes have been isolated from fungi, yeasts, 
and bacteria, and their mode of action varies greatly. Glucoamylase occurs 
almost exclusively in fungi, pullulanase in bacteria, and a-D-glucosidase 
and isoamylase are produced by both fungi and bacteria. Although these 
enzymes are used by the biochemist as research tools and their mode of 
action is clearly relevant to the subject of this chapter, only the starch- 
degrading enzymes found in plants are described here. The reader is re- 
ferred to the excellent review of Galliard (1987) for information on the 
fungal and bacterial amylases. 
Plants have a number of enzymes that can contribute to starch breakdown 
and they have been studied in some detail. Endoamylases such as a-amylase 
(EC 3.2.1.1) can cleave hydrolytically 1,4-a-glucosidic bonds, producing a 
mixture of linear and branched oligosaccharides, and eventually maltotri- 
ose, maltose, glucose, and a range of branched a-limit dextrins. Starch 
and other a-glucans can be hydrolyzed by P-amylase (EC 3.2.1.2), which 
catalyzes the removal of successive maltose units from the nonreducing end 
of a-glucan chains. The maltooligosaccharides produced by these amylolytic 
enzymes can be further hydrolyzed to glucose by a-glucosidase (EC 
3.2.1.20). Manners (1985) presents a good discussion of the need for exten- 
sive purification before characterization of starch degradative enzymes (see 
also the chapter, “Branching Enzymes,” for similar points on the character- 
ization of branching enzymes) and the artifacts encountered by workers 
who did not follow this rule. 
For a glucan to be a substrate for starch phosphorylase, it must be longer 
than maltotetraose. Shorter oligosaccharides, however, can be used by 
glucosyltransferases such as D-enzyme (EC 2.4.1.25) in the reaction 
a-glucan + a-glucan w a-glucan(,+,-l) + glucose 
These enzymes increase the degree of polymerization of short oligosaccha- 
rides, converting them into suitable substrates for starch phosphorylase. 
153 

154 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
None of the enzymes discussed so far can hydrolyze the a-1,6 bonds 
present in starch. These branch points are cleaved hydrolytically by the 
debranching enzyme (EC 3.2.1.41), which releases linear oligosaccharides 
for further metabolism by amylases or phosphorylase. 
II. DEBRANCHING ENZYMES 
The enzymes that hydrolyze (1 -+ 6)-a-D-glucosidic linkages in starch and 
glycogen and in related a- and 0-dextrins are called debranching enzymes. 
The nomenclature for this type of enzyme was confusing, but has been clarified. 
The latest International Union Biochemicals report includes an enzyme 
3.2.1.41 a-dextrin endo-1,6-a-glucosidase, other names limit dextrinase, 
amylopectin 6-glucanohydrolase, pullulanase. 
Dohlert and Knutson (1991) and D. J. Manners (personal communica- 
tion) reported that extracts of sugary maize contain a mixture of limit 
dextrinase and isoamylase. However, James et al. (1995) reported that su 
1 codes for the isoamylase. 
The plant and bacterial enzymes capable of hydrolyzing pullulan do not 
have identical specificities. In particular, the plant enzymes have little or 
no action on glycogen and phytoglycogen under conditions in which they 
readily hydrolyze amylopectin and its P-dextrin. To stress this difference 
(the bacterial enzymes are capable of degrading both glycogen and phyto- 
glycogen), Manners (1997) recommended different nomenclature for bacte- 
rial enzymes, to be called pullulanase, and the plant enzymes, to be called 
limit dextrinases. 
Manners’ (1997) classification is based on the specificity for the substrate 
[e.g., how readily they hydrolyze glycogen or pullulan-a 
glucan synthesized 
by Pullularia pullulans (Aureobasidium pullu1ans)-consisting 
essentially 
of a linear chain of (1 + 6)-linked a-maltotriose residues]. According to 
this classification, higher plant debranching enzymes are called either limit 
dextrinases, which hydrolyze amylopectin, pullulan, and a-dextrins, but do 
not hydrolyze glycogen, or isoamylases, which act on amylopectin, glycogen, 
and some a-dextrins, but not on pullulan. A third debranching activity, R- 
enzyme, was discovered independently of limit dextrinases but was later 
found to be the same enzyme. Hizukuri (1995) classifies them (according 
to their mode of action) direct and indirect debranching enzymes. The 
enzymes belong to the first-group if they hydrolyze (1 + 6)a-branch link- 
ages in one step (e.g., isoamylase and pullulanase). The second group has 
an indirect action (e.g., an enzyme from rabbit muscle, the amylo 1,6- 
glucosidase 4-cx-D-glucanotransferase, hydrolyzes only a single glucosyl side-

chain residue after the other residues of the chain have been transferred 
to other chains); it also has activity as a 1,4-a-glucanotransferase. 
James et al. (1995) cloned the Sugary 1 (Su 1) gene of maize; when 
this gene is disrupted, the endosperm has reduced amounts of starch and 
substantial amounts of a water-soluble polysaccharide reminiscent of glyco- 
gen (hence its name, phyfoglycogen). The Su l cDNA was expressed in 
Escherichia coli, where it displayed debranching activity. The deduced 
amino-acid sequence of the product of Su 1 had strong homology with the 
bacterial isoamylases. Thus, preliminary evidence suggests that this enzyme 
could participate in the debranching of a amylopectin precursor, leading 
to the formation of an amylopectin capable of crystallizing and forming 
the water-insoluble starch granule (see the chapter, “Open Questions and 
Hypotheses in Starch”). 
It is likely that, as research on the structure and function of the plant 
debranching enzymes progresses, and as the enzymes are compared with 
their bacterial and fungal counterparts, classification will be based on both 
mode of action and structure. 
111. 
THE PATHWAY OF STARCH DEGRADATION IN PLANTS 
The enzymes capable of degrading starch have been discussed, but the 
steps required to convert the intact starch granule into soluble maltooligo- 
saccharides have not been addressed yet. Which of the enzyme(s) named 
in the preceding text are actually involved in the initial degradation of the 
intact and insoluble starch granule? Is degradation initiated by a particular 
a-amylase or by one of the phosphorylases? Although some thought that 
only endoamylases were capable of catalyzing the initial steps of starch 
degradation, it is known that phosphorylase from pea chloroplasts can 
release labeled glucose l-phosphate from I4C-labeled starch granules (Kru- 
ger and ap Rees, 1983). It is worth noting that because starch is accumulated 
in many different tissues, some variation in the pathway of degradation 
should be expected, if only to accommodate the different metabolic de- 
mands of those tissues. For example, reserve starch is compartmentalized 
differently within legume cotyledon and cereal endosperm. Within the 
living cotyledon cells, the amyloplast membranes disintegrate during seed 
maturation and the granules are exposed to the cytosolic enzymes. In 
the endosperm of cereal seeds, the cells die early and, at maturity, the 
starch granules are embedded in a matrix of storage protein and are sur- 
rounded by a net of dead cell walls. During germination of cereal grains, 
starch breakdown is associated with the destruction of the endosperm, 
which softens and eventually liquifies. Starch degradation in these circum- 

156 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
stances can be considered to be extracellular, and it seems to occur via a hy- 
drolytic route rather than by phosphorolysis (Boyer, 1985b). The glucose 
released by the combined action of a-amylases, debranching enzymes, and 
a-glucosidases is absorbed by the scutellum, converted into sucrose, and 
transported to the embryo. In other seeds, germination occurs without the 
destruction of storage tissue, although it is likely that amyloplast membranes 
are broken down, making starch accessible to cytosolic enzymes. In one of 
these cases, which is similar to that in pea cotyledons, starch breakdown 
may be phosphorolytic, but in soybeans and lentils it seems that a-amylolysis 
may be the major route of starch breakdown. The role of &amylase in the 
many seeds is uncertain and, although it may contribute to the degradation 
of oligosaccharides released by a-amylase, P-amylase does not seem to be 
essential for starch breakdown (ap Rees, 1988). 
The onset of the dark period induces an amylolytic enzyme in the leaves 
of Arubidopsis fhuliunu plants grown under a light-dark cycle (Kakefuda 
and Preiss, 1997). Zymograms, obtained from samples harvested over a 24- 
hour period, indicated that the activity of this hydrolase is induced by the 
onset of darkness, is higher after 1 hour, and then rapidly disappears from 
the soluble protein fraction. The peak of activity of this amylase coincides 
with a decrease in starch content in the leaf. The dark-induced amylase 
was separated from other, noninducible hydrolases, using polyethylene 
glycol precipitation, DE-52 ion exchange, Bio-Gel A-0.5M gel filtration, 
and amylose affinity chromatography. The partially purified enzyme was 
characterized using the release of Remazol brilliant blue dye from starch 
azure, hydrolysis of beta-limit dextrin and periodated amylose, and the 
results obtained indicate that it is an endo-(a)amylase. Activity was inhib- 
ited by dialysis of the enzyme preparation against buffers containing EDTA 
or EGTA, and calcium protected the activity from this inhibition. This 
amylase differs from other amylolytic enzymes in that it has a relatively 
high pH optimum for activity (pH 7.0). 
Although native starch granules from storage organs seem to be first 
eroded by amylases before other enzymes can further hydrolyze it, the 
chloroplastic phosphorylase can release labeled glucose l-phosphate from 
“C-labeled starch granules, at least in pea leaves (Kruger and ap Rees, 
1 983). 
IV. STARCH DEGRADATIVE ENZYMES LOCATED OUTSIDE THE 
CHLOROPLAST: POSSIBLE FUNCTION 
In germinating seeds and tubers, starch degradation is essentially an 
irreversible process and continues until all the starch is metabolized. This 

STARCH DEGRADATION 
157 
is not so in young and mature leaves, in which starch is a temporary reserve 
and cellular and organelle integrity is maintained. In the case of young and 
mature leaves, at least the initial stages of starch breakdown occur inside 
the chloroplast, and breakdown seems to be mobilized by the joint action of 
endoamylases and the chloroplastic phosphorylase (Stitt and Steup, 1984). 
Incubation of spinach leaf starch granules with extrachloroplastic phos- 
phorylase resulted in the formation of glucose 1-phosphate (Steup er al., 
1983). Hammond and Preiss (1983) reported a large increase in cytosolic 
phosphorylase from spinach leaf in a time course that approximates the 
time of leaf senescence (i.e., when starch chloroplast must be hydrolyzed 
and exported to active sinks). 
The localization of P-amylase has been a matter of discussion for some 
time. Okamoto and Akazawa (1979) found &amylase to be associated with 
starch granules, an obvious location for an enzyme capable of metabolizing 
starch, but later, cell fractionation (Beck and Ziegler, 1989) indicated that 
P-amylase was localized in the vacuole. Wang el al. (1995), using monoclonal 
antibodies selected for phloem-specificity, proposed that the &amylase of 
A. thaliana is localized in the phloem. They attributed the putative localiza- 
tion of the enzyme in the vacuole and its association with starch granules 
to the similarity in epitopes between P-amylase and phosphorylase (i.e., it 
was the starch phosphorylase that had been located and had been described 
in previous publications). Regarding the possible role for the &amylase, 
Wang er al. (1995) suggested that it might be there to prevent buildup of 
starch in the sieve elements during sugar translocation. In seeds, it has been 
suggested that the enzyme does not fulfill any significant metabolic role 
(mutants deficient in P-amylase can germinate and grow normally), but is 
rather a storage protein. 
V. DIGESTION OF STARCH IN HUMANS 
Starch is a major nutrient in human diet. Digestion of starch consists in 
the breaking up of the glycosidic bonds linking the glucose residues by 
glycosidases in order to liberate the reducing components; cooking hydrates 
starch, making its digestion more efficient. 
The principal locations for digestion of starch in humans are the mouth, 
the lumen of the small intestine, and the brush border of the epithelial 
cells of the intestinal mucosa. Food is masticated in the mouth, forming a 
bolus ready for swallowing, while the salivary a-amylase attacks the hy- 
drated starch. The enzyme breaks the starch at random intervals, hydrolyz- 
ing internal a-1,4 bonds (and not the a-1,6 bonds constituting the branching 
points). The a-amylase will not break the bonds nearest the nonreducing 

158 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
ends, nor the bonds next to the a-1,6 branch points, and for this reason 
the product of its action is a mixture of glucose, maltose, and smaller units 
of the starch molecule called starch dextrins, which contain all of the original 
a-1.6 bonds. 
When food that has been thoroughly chewed reaches the stomach, acidity 
inactivates the salivary a-amylase, but by then the large starch molecules 
have been reduced from several thousands to a few glucose units, provided 
the food has been chewed thoroughly. Little hydrolysis of the carbohydrate 
occurs in the stomach, although sucrose can be broken up to some extent 
because the linkage between glucose and fructose, a /3-D-fructofuranoside 
bond, is sensitive to acidity (“acid-labile”). 
As the stomach empties, the hydrochloric acid in the material entering 
the small intestine is neutralized by secretions from the pancreatic ducts, 
bile, and pancreatic juice. The digestion of the starch dextrins is continued 
by the action of the pancreatic a-amylase. 
The pancreatic amylase is very similar to the salivary amylase; indeed, 
there is only a 1% difference in amino acid composition between the two. 
Pancreatic amylase is secreted in excess relative to starch intake; it is more 
important that the salivary enzyme be from a digestive point of view, 
because food generally does not remain in the mouth long enough to be 
digested thoroughly by salivary a-amylase. The products of the digestion 
by a-amylase are mainly maltose and maltotriose, and a-limit dextrins 
containing about eight glucose units with one or more a-1,6 glucosidic 
bonds. 
It is worth noting that ingested cellulose cannot be digested by humans. 
Although cellulose is also a polymer of glucose, the linkages between 
glucose residues are by means of (1 += 
4)-/3-~-glycosidic linkages (rather 
than an a-glycosidic linkages as in starch), and there is no human enzyme 
capable of hydrolyzing them. 
Final hydrolysis of di- and oligosaccharides is carried out by surface 
enzymes of the small intestinal epithelial cells, called the brush border, a 
term that comes from the appearance of the enterocytes, in which the 
luminal plasma membrane is enlarged by a regular array of projections 
called microvilli. The enzymes are not secreted into the lumen, but are 
embedded in the cell membrane, many of these enzymes can protrude into 
the intestinal lumen up to 10 pm, as they are attached to the plasma 
membrane by an anchoring polypeptide that has no role by itself in the hy- 
drolysis. 
The saccharidases present in the surface of the small intestine relevant 
to the digestion of starch and its components are: 
1. exo-1 ,Ca-glucosidase (glucoamylase), specific for a-( 
1,4)glucose 
bonds 

STARCH DEGRADATION 
159 
2. oligo-1,6-glucosidase (isomaltase), which acts on a-(l-6)glucose bonds 
and breaks down isomaltose and a-dextrins 
3. a-glucosidase (maltase), which acts specifically on a(l4)glucose 
bonds, breaking down maltose and maltotriose 
Most of the surface oligosaccharidases are exoenzymes, which clip off 
one monosaccharide at a time from the nonreducing end. The capacity of the 
a-glucosidases normally is much greater than that needed for completion of 
starch digestion. Absorption of the glucose resulting from digestion in the 
intestinal lumen into the cell is mediated by substrate-specific carriers in 
the plasma membrane. Glucose transport is the rate-limiting step of carbo- 
hydrate at the brush border membrane. Conversely, the duodenal amylase 
content of an adult is capable of hydrolyzing the starch content of a whole 
meal in a matter of minutes. Eventually, glucose passes into the portal 
blood system, through which it is transported first to the liver and then to 
the remainder of the body. 
Because amylase activity is not rate limiting, blood glucose and insulin 
levels in a healthy adult will be similar if he is fed soluble starch, hydrolyzed 
starch, low molecular weight maltooligosaccharides, or glucose. Different 
types of starchy foods can, however, differ in the glycemic responses they 
elicit because of differences in factors such as particle size (determined in 
part by milling), amylase inhibitors, amylose-amylopectin ratio, starch- 
lipid interactions, and starch-protein interactions. Processing may have a 
large effect on starch availability. For example, raw wheat flour gives a 
very low sugar and insulin blood levels as compared with the same flour 
after gelatinization of starch by boiling, and roasting of beans increases the 
systemic response as compared with boiled beans. In other studies, extrusion 
cooking of whole grain crisp bread increased starch availability more than 
conventional baking. 
Di-, oligo-, and polysaccharides that are not hydrolized by a-amylase 
and/or intestinal surface enzymes cannot be absorbed, and they reach the 
lower tract of the intestine, which, from the lower ileum onward, contains 
bacteria. Because bacteria contain a larger variety of saccharidases than 
humans, they can use many of the remaining carbohydrates. 
VI. MECHANISM OF ACTION OF AMYLASES 
AND PHOSPHORYLASES 
The nomenclature a- and fl- for amylases had its origin in the optical 
properties of the hydrolysis products of starch. Another nomenclature, 
proposed in the 1950s, had its basis in the mode of action: endo- and 

160 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
exoamylases. Since that time, research on amylases has moved toward an 
understanding of the detailed mechanism of action and the crystal structure 
of the enzymes involved (Yamamoto, 1995). This scientific field is active, 
partly because of the commercial importance of enzymatic starch degrada- 
tion for the food and brewing industries. 
Polysaccharides, such as starch, phytoglycogen, glycogen, and maltodex- 
trin, are degraded by glucosylhydrolases. Despite large variations in the com- 
position of their substrates, all polysaccharide hydrolases are thought to act 
by a general acid catalysis mechanism, in which two acidic amino-acid resi- 
dues participate in either a single or double displacement reaction, resulting 
in the inversion or retention of configuration at the anomeric carbon atom 
of the glucosidic bond (Henrissat and Bairoch, 1993). As exemplified by glu- 
coamylase, the nature of the polysaccharide binding site is generally well 
characterized and consists of several subsites. It is assumed that the total 
affinity of the oligomeric substrate corresponds to the sum of the individual 
subsite affinities. Cleavage occurs between subsites 1 and 2, where subsite 2 
has the highest affinity of the oligomeric substrate. 
In contrast to polysaccharide hydrolases, starch and glycogen phosphoryl- 
ases (E.C. 2.4.1.1) transfer a glucosyl residue to a phosphate group rather 
than to water, resulting in the phosphorolytic cleavage of an a-l,6linked 
glucose unit and the formation of cY-D-glucose 1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) ac- 
cording to the equation 
[glucose], + Pi t) [glucose],-, + glucose 1-phosphate 
Another major difference between the phosphorylase-catalyzed reaction 
and the reaction of hydrolases is the free reversibility of the phosphorolytic 
cleavage. However, under certain conditions, the reaction of the hydrolysis 
is reversible, and may result in the synthesis of higher oligosaccharides 
from maltose and related di- and trioligosaccharides (as studied by French 
and Hehre in the 1960s and 1970s). 
The polysaccharide phosphorylases and the other depolymerizing en- 
zymes differ in both mechanism of action and structure, although it is 
generally accepted that phosphorylases share the general acid catalysis.

INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS OF STARCH 
Most of the starch produced in the world is used as food, but about one- 
third of the total production is employed for a variety of industrial purposes 
that take advantage of starch’s unique properties. The ability to induce 
starch accumulation in plant organs unable to synthesize it, or to increase 
starch content at will, would be of great nutritional importance, and some 
progress has already been made in this respect (see the chapter, “Regulation 
of the Starch Synthesis Pathway: Targets for Biotechnology”). But quality 
is as important as quantity. The properties of starch isolated from different 
sources (e.g., the size of the granules, viscosity, degree of branching, gelation 
properties) vary greatly and affect the digestibility of the starch and its use 
in food and nonfood products. Much could be gained by manipulating starch 
quality-for 
example, by modifying the ratio of amylose to amylopectin. So 
far this has been achieved to some extent and in some species by genetic 
improvement, but in the not-too-distant future, it could be better achieved 
using recombinant DNA and molecular biology techniques. 
It is important for the scientist who works with the basics of carbohydrate 
metabolism to know how the raw material is used by the industry, and for 
this reason, here we comment briefly on the use and manipulation of starch 
in the industrial setting. 
I. INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS OF STARCH 
Estimates (Rabinowitch, 1945) of the total amount of carbon fixed in 
photosynthesis by land plants is on the order of 2 X 10’’ tons per year. 
Three grain crops (wheat, rice, and maize) and three tuber crops (potato, 
yam, and cassava) provide 3 of the world’s food calculated as calories. The 
amount of starch produced by the edible portions of these crops in one 
year exceeds 7 X 10’ tons, of which about 6 X 108 tons are contributed by 
cereal grains. 
Most of the starch used in the food and beverage industries is in the 
form of starch hydrolysates (e.g., glucose, maltose, and isoglucose syrups). 
In syrup production, yield, ease of processing, color, and flavor are the 
163 

164 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
factors that determine the choice of the raw material. The main application 
for nonhydrolyzed starch is as a thickener. and for this use the rheologic 
characteristics of starch pastes are important. These characteristics depend 
on the botanical source of the starch and include temperature of gelatiniza- 
tion, whether on gelatinization they produce a gel or a sol, whether the gel 
is opaque or clear, and the gel thickness. 
About one-third of the total starch production is used for a variety of 
industrial purposes that take advantage of its properties (e.g.. sizing of 
paper and board; adhesive in the paper, packaging, and textile industries). 
In the chemical industry, starch is used as a starting material in fermentative 
processes to produce polyols, acids, amino acids, cyclodextrins, and fructose. 
II. 
MANUFACTURE AND PROPERTIES OF STARCH 
Different processes are used in the manufacture of starch, depending on 
the plant source, but they all essentially involve freeing the starch granules 
from the other constituents (e.g., fiber, germ, proteins). Purification is usu- 
ally done by screening, washing, and centrifugal separation, and the starch 
obtained is then dried. In the case of maize starch, mechanical separation 
is facilitated by steeping the grain in warm water in the presence of sulfite. 
Further processing of starch is carried out on starch suspensions because 
native starch is insoluble in water. 
Little is known about the molecular bases for the differences in the 
behavior of starches from different sources, but some important factors 
are the proportion of amylose and amylopectin, the size of the amylose 
and amylopectin molecules, and the presence of phosphate ester groups 
(as in potato amylopectin). Potato starch has some favorable characteristics 
(e.g., its high water retention, slow retrogradation, formation of clear pastes, 
and lack of a distinctive flavor). Starch from a particular source may have 
shortcomings that make it inappropriate for a particular use: lack of free 
flow or water repellency, insolubility or failure to swell and develop viscosity 
in cold water. excess of viscosity after cooking, cohesive or rubbery texture 
of cooked starch, tendency to break down during extensive cooking, shear 
at low pH, lack of clarity, or tendency to become opaque and gel when 
cooked. The solution in these cases is either to change the source of the 
raw material or to modify the starch by chemical or physical methods. In 
maize. sorghum, rice, and barley, waxy mutants that have starches essen- 
tially free of amylose have been discovered. Starches with high levels of 
amylose are also known, and some lines of corn have been developed in 
genetic programs (starting with Whistler and Kramer in the 1940s) with 

INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS OF STARCH 
165 
starch containing up to 70% amylose (the normal is around 25%); such 
cereals are called mylotypes. 
Viscosity and “mouth-feel” of gravies and other prepared foods, and 
the behavior of baked products, are determined primarily by the behavior 
of the starch present in those foods. Starch is responsible for the viscosity 
and mouth-feel of gravies and puddings and the texture of gumdrops 
and pie fillings. Baking products “set”-that 
is, there is a temperature 
at which the dough no longer expands under the gas pressure generated 
by the increasing temperature-and 
the changes experienced by the starch 
in the dough are responsible to a great degree for that setting. Thus, 
a great deal of attention has been devoted to the behavior of starch in 
water. Dried starch granules swell when they are suspended in water; 
starch can hold up to approximately 30% of its dry weight in moisture. 
If the temperature is increased slowly, the granules continue to expand 
slowly. At that stage, they still maintain their crystalline and birefringent 
properties, and the temperature-induced swelling is still reversible. How- 
ever, if the temperature is further increased, irreversible swelling occurs, 
and the granules lose their birefringence. This phenomenon, called 
gelatinization occurs over a range of 5 to 10°C and can be tracked in 
a number of ways. The optical properties can be examined using a 
microscope equipped with a hot stage. As temperature is increased, 
viscosity can be followed using an amylograph (Fig. l), and as the 
swelling progresses, so does viscosity, which is measured in Brabender 
units. Then, as temperature is increased further, the swollen granule 
breaks down, causing a decrease in viscosity. Starch gelatinization is 
defined as the loss of birefringence, and this change coincides with a 
large increase in viscosity. An amylograph measures the relative viscosity 
of a system as it is heated at a constant rate (l.S”C/min). With continued 
heating, the starch granule becomes distorted, and soluble starch is 
released into the solution. The viscosity changes shown by the starch 
as temperature increases after gelatinization (i.e., after the loss of birefrin- 
gence) are called pasting behavior and vary with the source of the starch 
and with the amylose content. Heating in the amylograph is stopped at 
95”C, the temperature is left constant at that value for some time, and 
the starch is said to be cooked. During “cooking,” the viscosity drops 
if the system is stirred, because the starch molecules orient themselves 
in the direction of stirring, a phenomenon called “shear thinning.” 
Another property varies with the source of the starch: The more soluble 
the starch, the more it “thins” (the more the viscosity drops) on stirring. 
After the period of time at constant temperature, cooling of the system 
leads to a rapid increase in viscosity, the “setback,” which increases as 
the hydrogen bonding between the starch molecules increases. This paste

FIG. 1. Pasting behavior of different starches as measured using a Brabender arnylograph. 
Viscosity is measured at varying temperatures: a standard program starts at SOT, then heats 
at 1 .S”Clmin until a temperature of 95°C is reached, and then the temperature is kept constant 
at 95°C for 30 min. The sources of the different starches is as follows: -, 
potato; .-.-. waxy 
maize: - - -. maize: 0 0, amylomaize. The first rise in viscosity is linked to the initial swelling 
of the starch granule, and is followed by a breakdown of swollen granules and a consequent 
decrease in viscosity. On gelatinization. potato starch swells greatly and then bursts open; 
cereal starches swell. but tend not to burst. and amylomaize starch swells very little. After

is a gel holding large quantities of water. As the paste is cooled, the 
interactions increase and the gel becomes firmer. If the gel is frozen 
and thawed, or when it ages, interactions among the starch molecules 
increase and those with the water decrease, resulting in the loss of water 
by the gel, which is a phenomenon called syneresis. Longer storage leads 
to even stronger interaction among the starch molecules and eventually 
to the formation of crystals, a process called rerrogradatiort. Crystallization 
changes the refractive index and the aged gel is more opaque, rigid, 
and rubbery. Retrogradation is thought to be responsible, at least in 
part, for the staling of bread, the setback of starch gels, and the skinning 
of pastes. Waxy starches do not retrograde. 
The heat of gelatinization, which can be measured using differential 
scanning calorimetry. seems to be related directly to the amylopectin con- 
tent. indicating that amylopectin (and not amylose) is the component re- 
sponsible for the crystalline structure of starch (see the chapter, “Physico- 
chemical Structure of the Starch Granule”).

167 
Ill. PHYSICAL ANALYSIS OF STARCH AND DERIVATIVES IN THE 
INDUSTRIAL SETING 
X-ray analysis can be used to differentiate between native starches or 
to detect changes brought about by physical or chemical treatment of 
granular starch. Cereal starches give the A pattern, with the exception of 
amylomaizes, which have an amylose content greater than 40 or 45%. 
Starch precipitated from pastes by evaporation exhibit different patterns 
depending on the temperature of evaporation, B if below 50"C, B or C if 
above 50°C. 
Light microscopy supplies information on the dimensions and shape 
of the granule, and helps to identify the botanical source of the starch 
and to monitor processing conditions and modifications. The progress 
of gelatinization can be followed using a polarizing microscope to observe 
the disappearance of birefringence using a Kofler hot stage, or by using 
Congo red, which stains gelatinized or broken granules but not native 
ones. Iodine staining is used to determine the degree of contamination 
of waxy starch (which stains red) with normal blue-staining granules. 
Granule size range and diameters can also be measured using a Coulter 
particle size counter. 
The Brabender amylograph is a rotational instrument that permits the 
measurement of viscosity while cooking and cooling the starch paste. 
An aqueous dispersion of starch (10% w/w dry basis) is heated to 95°C 
at a rate of lS"C/min. Viscosity is recorded continuously during heating 
to give the hot-paste viscosity measurements. The peak viscosity indicates 
the highest viscosity that the industrial user will encounter on preparing 
a usable paste. The viscosity on reaching 95"C, relative to the peak 
viscosity, reflects the ease of cooking the starch. After cooking the paste 
for some time (e.g., 1 hour), the viscosity indicates the stability or degree 
of breakdown of the paste. Samples in the Brabender amylograph can 
later be cooled to approximately 50°C for the assessment of the "setback" 
characteristics (i.e., increased viscosity on cooling). The gels can also be 
prepared using a viscometer; the gels are cast in molds and, after storage 
at 20°C for 24 hours, the gel strength is measured as the energy required 
to compress the gel and the resistance of the gels to rupture. 
Polarimetry takes advantage of the high specific rotation of starch, about 
+200, and is used mainly to measure concentration. It is affected by molecu- 
lar structure, solvent, and hydrolytic degradation. 
Differential scanning calorimetry measures heat flow as a function of 
temperature. When starch is heated in the presence of excess water, a sharp 
peak (an endotherm) is obtained, which is caused by the disordering of 

168 
MIRTA NOEMI SIVAK AND JACK PREISS 
amylopectin during the gelatinization. The starches that contain lipid give 
a second endotherm due to the dissociation of an amylose-lipid complex. 
IV. CHEMICAL MODIFICATION OF STARCH 
Lintner and Naegeli used acid treatment of starch in the late 1800s 
and, for this reason, acid-treated starches are called lintnerized or Nuegeli 
starches. In this method, a concentrated starch slurry is heated in 1 to 3% 
HCl at about 50°C for 12-14 hours, leading to partial acid hydrolysis of 
the glucosidic bonds in the amorphous portion of the starch. The crystalline 
areas are not freely accessible to the acid and remain intact. After neutral- 
ization and recovery by filtration, the modified starch, with a lower molecu- 
lar weight but with its crystalline structure intact, displays different charac- 
teristics on heating it in water. The granules fragment more and swell less, 
and the temperature range of gelatinization increases and, on gelatinization, 
the starch becomes soluble. The resulting paste is less viscous and the gels 
are more rigid. Acid-modified starches are used in jelly beans and other 
gum confectioneries. 
Crosslinking of starch molecules to make larger ones is performed by 
forming a diester with phosphoric acid or an ether bond with epichlorohy- 
drin. In a large molecule such as amylopectin, crosslinking can also occur 
internally. A high degree of crosslinking increases the gelatinization 
temperature to such an extent that starch can be boiled in water or 
sterilized in an autoclave and will not gelatinize. A lower degree of 
crosslinking (which is measured by “degree of substitution”) does not 
affect gelatinization, but strongly affects pasting properties (e.g., viscosity 
on pasting is decreased and shear thinning decreases-viscosity 
is not 
decreased much by shear and pumping) and allows gelatinization in an 
acidic medium such as that of a cherry pie. Crosslinking slows retrograda- 
tion and decreases the changes suffered by the. gel on freezing and thawing. 
Starch molecules that are modified by forming monoesters of phosphoric 
acid repel one another because of the added charge, leading to higher 
swelling and solubilization during gelatinization, and to less interaction 
during pasting. The resulting starch paste has a higher viscosity, lower 
resistance to shear thinning, and lower retrogradation and opaqueness. 
Depending on the degree of substitution, gelatinization can even occur at 
room temperature, and these starches are useful in the making of instant 
puddings. Oxidized starches. obtained by treatment with hypochlorite, give 
better adhesion to meat products but are generally used for nonfood pur- 
poses such as the manufacture of paper. 

INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS OF STARCH 
169 
Other useful modifications include acetylation, hydroxyethylation, hydro- 
xypropylation, cationic starches, succinate, and substituted succinate deriva- 
tives of starch. In starch-grafted copolymers, free radicals are initiated on 
the starch that then act as macroinitiators for the acryl or vinyl monomers. 
These products are used in firefighting fluids, electrolyte solutions for alka-

V. CONVERSION OF STARCH INTO SWEETENERS 
In the industry, the degree of hydrolysis is measured as dextrose (glucose) 
equivalents, or DE, which is a measure of the reducing power of the mixture 
relative to the number of glucose residues. Simple acid hydrolysis of starch 
leads to the formation of glucose syrup, because both the a-1,4 and the a- 
1,6 bonds are susceptible to the acid. However, after a certain DE is ob- 
tained, side reactions can occur that can affect the quality of the syrup 
obtained. For this reason, acid treatment is often used for thinning (i.e,, 
for partial hydrolysis rather than a total degradation). The resulting dextrins 
can be used directly for increasing the viscosity of a number of products, 
but for the production of sweeteners, they must be further degraded using 
enzymes such as a-amylase, P-amylase, and/or glucoamylase. If a very high 
degree of sweetness is desired, glucose can be converted into fructose by 
the action of glucose isomerase. 
VI. BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS 
Starch and starch derivatives can improve the biodegradability of a 
polymer as a whole when incorporated as fillers or functional additives 
(Booma et al., 1994). Although starch-based polymers have also been 
developed, research continues with the following aims: to increase the 
speed and degree of degradability, to increase compatibility with inks, 
to decrease toxicity and hygroscopy, and to improve mechanical and 
rheologic properties. High amylose starch can be processed by extrusion 
or injection molding under highly controlled environmental conditions 
to give biodegradable thermoplastic materials (Fanta and Doane, 1986; 
Booma et al., 1994). All industrial applications require some modification 
of the starch (e.g., the addition of plasticizers, chemical bonding, addition 
of high cost ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers). Although a variety of 
starches are being used for the manufacture of biodegradable polymers, 
it is likely that starches from some plants may be more suitable than 
others for a particular purpose. Indeed, a number of specialty starches

(such as amylose and waxy starch) are being increasingly recognized for 
their specific properties and biodegradability, and there is certainly room 
for other novel products. Thus, a greater understanding of the critical 
components of the plant starch biosynthetic machinery could have a 
major impact on agriculture and industry.
