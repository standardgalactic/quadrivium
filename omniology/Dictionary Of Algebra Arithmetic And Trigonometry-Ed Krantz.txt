PREFACE 
The second volume of the CRC Press Comprehensive Dictionary of Mathematics covers algebra, 
arithmetic and trigonometry broadly, with an overlap into differential geometry, algebraic geometry, 
topology and other related fields. The authorship is by well over 30 mathematicians, active in 
teaching and research, including the editor. 
Because it is a dictionary and not an encyclopedia, definitions are only occasionally accompanied 
by a discussion or example. In a dictionary of mathematics, the primary goal is to define each term 
rigorously. The derivation of a term is almost never attempted. 
The dictionary is written to be a useful reference for a readership that includes students, scientists, 
and engineers with a wide range of backgrounds, as well as specialists in areas of analysis and 
differential equations and mathematicians in related fields. Therefore, the definitions are intended 
to be accessible, as well as rigorous. To be sure, the degree of accessibility may depend upon the 
individual term, in a dictionary with terms ranging from Abelian cohomology to z intercept. 
Occasionally a term must be omitted because it is archaic. Care was taken when such circum- 
stances arose to ensure that the term was obsolete. An example of an archaic term deemed to be 
obsolete, and hence not included, is “right line”. This term was used throughout a turn-of-the-century 
analytic geometry textbook we needed to consult, but it was not defined there. Finally, reference to 
a contemporary English language dictionary yielded “straight line” as a synonym for “right line”. 
The authors are grateful to the series editor, Stanley Gibilisco, for dealing with our seemingly 
endless procedural questions and to Nora Konopka, for always acting efficiently and cheerfully with 
CRC Press liaison matters.

Let M be a right mod-
ule over the ring A, and let N be a left module
over the same ring A. A mapping φ from M×N
to an Abelian group G is said to be A-balanced
if φ(x, ·) is a group homomorphism from N to
G for each x ∈M, if φ(·, y) is a group homo-
morphism from M to G for each y ∈N, and
if
φ(xa, y) = φ(x, ay)
holds for all x ∈M, y ∈N, and a ∈A.
A-B-bimodule
An Abelian group G that is a
left module over the ring A and a right module
over the ring B and satisﬁes the associative law
(ax)b = a(xb) for all a ∈A, b ∈B, and all
x ∈G.
Abelian cohomology

with coefﬁcients in an Abelian group; used if
the context requires one to distinguish between

morphic function with only 0 residues.
Abelian differential of the third kind

f (X) = 0 is said to be an Abelian equation if
its Galois group is an Abelian group. See Galois
group. See also Abelian group.

A function f (z1, z2, z3,
. . . , zn) meromorphic on Cn for which there ex-
ist 2n vectors ωk ∈Cn, k = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 2n,
called period vectors, that are linearly indepen-
dent over R and are such that
f (z + ωk) = f (z)
holds for k = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 2n and z ∈Cn.
Abelian function ﬁeld
The set of Abelian
functions on Cn corresponding to a given set of
period vectors forms a ﬁeld called an Abelian
function ﬁeld.

More completely, a set G, together with a binary
operation, usually denoted “+,” a unary opera-
tion usually denoted “−,” and a distinguished
element usually denoted “0” satisfying the fol-
lowing axioms:

a, b, c ∈G,
(ii.) a + 0 = a for all a ∈G,
(iii.) a + (−a) = 0 for all a ∈G,
(iv.) a + b = b + a for all a, b ∈G.
The element 0 is called the identity, −a is
called the inverse of a, axiom (i.) is called the
associative axiom, and axiom (iv.) is called the

An indef-
inite integral W(p) =

Abelian variety
A complete algebraic vari-
ety G that also forms a commutative algebraic
group. That is, G is a group under group oper-
ations that are regular functions. The fact that
an algebraic group is complete as an algebraic
variety implies that the group is commutative.
See also regular function.
Abel’s Theorem
Niels Henrik Abel (1802-
1829) proved several results now known as
“Abel’s Theorem,” but perhaps preeminent
among these is Abel’s proof that the general
quintic equation cannot be solved algebraically.
Other theorems that may be found under the
heading “Abel’s Theorem” concern power se-
ries, Dirichlet series, and divisors on Riemann
surfaces.
absolute class ﬁeld
Let k be an algebraic
number ﬁeld. A Galois extension K of k is an
absolute class ﬁeld if it satisﬁes the following
property regarding prime ideals of k: A prime
ideal p of k of absolute degree 1 decomposes
as the product of prime ideals of K of absolute
degree 1 if and only if p is a principal ideal.
The term “absolute class ﬁeld” is used to dis-
tinguish the Galois extensions described above,
which were introduced by Hilbert, from a more
general concept of “class ﬁeld” deﬁned by
Tagaki. See also class ﬁeld.
absolute covariant
A covariant of weight 0.
See also covariant.

variables that is valid for all possible substitu-
tions of real numbers for the variables.

of an algebraic variety that is preserved under
birational transformations.

representation is absolutely irreducible if it is
irreducible and if the representation obtained by
making an extension of the ground ﬁeld remains
irreducible.

tains no serial subgroup. The notion of an ab-
solutely simple group is a strengthening of the
concept of a simple group that is appropriate for
inﬁnite groups. See serial subgroup.
absolutely uniserial algebra
Let A be an al-
gebra over the ﬁeld K, and let L be an extension
ﬁeld of K. Then L ⊗K A can be regarded as
an algebra over L. If, for every choice of L,
L ⊗K A can be decomposed into a direct sum
of ideals which are primary rings, then A is an
absolutely uniserial algebra.

variant of weight 0. See also multiple covari-
ants.

trast with a literal number which is a number

ogous to an ordinary algebraic variety, but de-
ﬁned only locally and without an imbedding.
abstract function
(1) In the theory of gen-
eralized almost-periodic functions, a function
mapping R to a Banach space other than the
complex numbers.
(2) A function from one Banach space to an-
other Banach space that is everywhere differen-
tiable in the sense of Fréchet.
abstract variety
A generalization of the no-
tion of an algebraic variety introduced by Weil,
in analogy with the deﬁnition of a differentiable
manifold. An abstract variety (also called an
abstract algebraic variety) consists of (i.)
a
family {Vα}α∈A of afﬁne algebraic sets over a
given ﬁeld k, (ii.) for each α ∈A a family of
open subsets {Wαβ}β∈A of Vα, and (iii.) for each
pair α and β in A a birational transformation be-
tween Wαβ and Wαβ such that the composition
of the birational transformations between sub-
sets of Vα and Vβ and between subsets of Vβ
and Vγ are consistent with those between sub-
sets of Vα and Vγ .

with L the lower triangular submatrix of A, D
the diagonal of A, and 0 < ω < 2. Here, ω

that the kernel of ∂n equals the image of ∂n+1
for n ≥1, the kernel of ϵ equals the image of
∂1, and ϵ is surjective. Here the Xi and A are
modules over a commutative unitary ring.
addend
In arithmetic, a number that is to be
added to another number. In general, one of the
operands of an operation of addition. See also
addition.

(1) A basic arithmetic operation
that expresses the relationship between the
number of elements in each of two disjoint sets
and the number of elements in the union of those
two sets.

Abelian group, when the notation “+” is used
for that operation. See also Abelian group.

mulas

addition of algebraic expressions
One of
the fundamental ways of forming new algebraic
expressionsfromexistingalgebraicexpressions;
the other methods of forming new expressions
from old being subtraction, multiplication, divi-
sion, and root extraction.
addition of angles
In elementary geometry
or trigonometry, the angle resulting from the
process of following rotation through one an-
gle about a center by rotation through another
angle about the same center.
addition of complex numbers
One of the
fundamental operations under which the com-
plex numbers C form a ﬁeld. If w = a + ib,
z = c + id ∈C, with a, b, c, and d real, then
w +z = (a +c)+i(b +d) is the result of addi-
tion, or the sum, of those two complex numbers.
addition of vectors
One of the fundamental
operations in a vector space, under which the set
of vectors form an Abelian group. For vectors
in Rn or Cn, if x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) and y =
(y1, y2, . . . , yn), then x + y = (x1 + y1, x2 +
y2, . . . , xn + yn).
additive group
(1) Any group, usually
Abelian, where the operation is denoted +. See
group, Abelian group.
(2) In discussing a ring R, the commutative
group formed by the elements of R under the
addition operation.
additive identity
In an Abelian group G, the
unique element (usually denoted 0) such that
g + 0 = g for all g ∈G.
additive identity
a binary operation that is
called addition and is denoted by “+.” In this
situation, an additive identity is an element i ∈S
that satisﬁes the equation
i + s = s + i = s
for all s ∈S. Such an additive identity is nec-
essarily unique and usually is denoted by “0.”
In ordinary arithmetic, the number 0 is the
additive identity because 0 + n = n + 0 = n
holds for all numbers n.
additive inverse
In any algebraic structure
with a commutative operation referred to as ad-
dition and denoted by “+,” for which there is
an additive identity 0, the additive inverse of an
element a is the element b for which a + b =
b + a = 0. The additive inverse of a is usu-
ally denoted by −a. In arithmetic, the additive
inverse of a number is also called its opposite.
See additive identity.
additive set function
Let X be a set and let A
be a collection of subsets of X that is closed un-
der the union operation. Let φ : A →F, where
F is a ﬁeld of scalars. We say that φ is ﬁnitely
additive if, whenever S1, . . . , Sk ∈A are pair-
wise disjoint then φ(∪k
j=1Sj) = k
j=1 φ(Sj).
We say that φ is countably additive if, when-
ever S1, S2, · · · ∈A are pairwise disjoint then
φ(∪∞
j=1Sj) = ∞
j=1 φ(Sj).
additive valuation
Let F be a ﬁeld and G
be a totally ordered additive group. An addi-
tive valuation is a function v : F →G ∪{∞}
satisfying
(i.) v(a) = ∞if and only if a = 0,
(ii.) v(ab) = v(a) + v(b),
(iii.) v(a + b) ≥min{v(a), v(b)}.
adele
Following Weil, let k be either a ﬁnite
algebraic extension of Q or a ﬁnitely generated
extension of a ﬁnite prime ﬁeld of transcendency
degree 1 over that ﬁeld. By a place of k is meant
the completion of the image of an isomorphic
embedding of k into a local ﬁeld (actually the
equivalence class of such completions under the
equivalence relation induced by isomorphisms
of the local ﬁelds). A place is inﬁnite if the local
ﬁeld is R or C, otherwise the place is ﬁnite. For
a place v, kv will denote the completion, and if
v is a ﬁnite place, rv will denote the maximal
compact subring of kv. An adele is an element
of

v∈P


v/∈P
rv ,
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

where P is a ﬁnite set of places containing the
inﬁnite places.
adele group
Let V be the set of valuations
on the global ﬁeld k.
For v ∈V , let kv be
the completion of k with respect to v, and let
Ov be the ring of integer elements in kv. The
adele group of the linear algebraic group G is
the restricted direct product

v∈V
Gkv
	
GOv

which, as a set, consists of all sequences of el-
ements of Gkv, indexed by v ∈V , with all but
ﬁnitely many terms in each sequence being ele-
ments of GOv.
adele ring
Following Weil, let k be either a
ﬁnite algebraic extension of Q or a ﬁnitely gen-
erated extension of a ﬁnite prime ﬁeld of tran-
scendency degree 1 over that ﬁeld. Set
kA(P ) =

v∈P
kv ×

v/∈P
rv ,
where P is a ﬁnite set of places of k contain-
ing the inﬁnite places. A ring structure is put
on kA(P ) deﬁning addition and multiplication
componentwise. The adele ring is
kA =

P
kA(P) .
A locally compact topology is deﬁned on kA by
requiring each kA(P) to be an open subring and
using the product topology on kA(P).
adjoining
(1) Assuming K is a ﬁeld exten-
sion of k and S ⊂K, the ﬁeld obtained by ad-
joining S to k is the smallest ﬁeld F satisfying
k ⊂F ⊂K and containing S.
(2) If R is a commutative ring, then the ring
of polynomials R[X] is said to be obtained by
adjoining X to R.
adjoint group
The image of a Lie group G,
under the adjoint representation into the space
of linear endomorphisms of the associated Lie
algebra g. See also adjoint representation.
adjoint Lie algebra
Let g be a Lie algebra.
The adjoint Lie algebra is the image of g under
the adjoint representation into the space of linear
endomorphisms of g. See also adjoint represen-
tation.
adjoint matrix
For a matrix M with complex
entries, the adjoint of M is denoted by M∗and
is the complex conjugate of the transpose of M;
so if M =
	
mij

, then M∗has ¯mji as the entry
in its ith row and jth column.
adjoint representation
(1) In the context of
Lie algebras, the adjoint representation is the
mapping sending X to [X, ·].
(2) In the context of Lie groups, the adjoint
representation is the mapping sending σ to the
differential of the automorphism ασ : G →G
deﬁned by ασ(τ) = στσ −1.
(3) In the context of representations of an al-
gebra over a ﬁeld, the term adjoint representa-
tion is a synonym for dual representation. See
dual representation.
adjoint system
Let D be a curve on a non-
singular surface S. The adjoint system of D is
|D + K|, where K is a canonical divisor on S.
adjunction formula
The formula
2g −2 = C.(C + K)
relating the genus g of a non-singular curve C
on a surface S with the intersection pairing of C
and C + K, where K is a canonical divisor on
S.
admissible homomorphism
For a group G
with a set of operators , a group homomor-
phism from G to a group G′ on which the same
operators act, such that
ω(ab) = (ωa)(ωb)
holds for all a, b ∈G and all ω ∈. Also called
an -homomorphism or an operator homomor-
phism.
admissible isomorphism
For a group G with
a set of operators , a group isomorphism from
G onto a group G′, on which the same operators
act, such that
ω(ab) = (ωa)(ωb)
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

holds for all a, b ∈G and all ω ∈. Also called
an -isomorphism or an operator isomorphism.
admissible normal subgroup
Let G be a
group. It is easily seen that a subset N of G is
a normal subgroup if and only if there is some
equivalence relation ∼on G such that ∼is com-
patible with the multiplication on G, meaning
a ∼b, c ∼d ⇒(ac) ∼(bd) ,
and N is the equivalence class of the identity.
In case G also has an operator domain , an
admissible normal subgroup is deﬁned to be the
equivalence class of the identity for an equiva-
lence relation ∼that is compatible with the mul-
tiplication as above and that also satisﬁes
a ∼b ⇒(ωa) ∼(ωb) for all ω ∈ .
admissible representation
Let π be a uni-
tary representation of the group G in a Hilbert
space, and let M be the von Neumann algebra
generated by π(G). The representation π is said
to be an admissible representation or a trace ad-
missible representation if there exists a trace on
M+ which is a character for π.
Ado-Iwasawa Theorem
The theorem that
every ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra (over a ﬁeld
of characteristic p) has a faithful ﬁnite dimen-
sional representation. The characteristic p = 0
case of this is Ado’s Theorem and the charac-
teristic p ̸= 0 case is Iwasawa’s Theorem. See
also Lie algebra.
Ado’s Theorem
A ﬁnite dimensional Lie al-
gebra g has a representation of ﬁnite degree ρ
such that g ∼= ρ(g).
While originally proved for Lie algebras
over ﬁelds of characteristic 0, the result was
extended to characteristic p by Iwasawa. See
Ado-Iwasawa Theorem.
affect
For a polynomial equation P(X) = 0,
the Galois group of the equation can be consid-
ered as a group of permutations of the roots of
the equation. The affect of the equation is the
index of the Galois group in the group of all
permutations of the roots of the equation.
affectless equation

for which the Galois group consists of all per-
mutations. See also affect.

afﬁne morphism of schemes
Let X and Y
be schemes and f : X →Y be a morphism. If
there is an open afﬁne cover {Vi} of the scheme
Y for which f −1(Vi) is afﬁne for each i, then f
is an afﬁne morphism of schemes.
afﬁne scheme
Let A be a commutative ring,
and let Spec(A) = X be the set of all prime

algebra class
An equivalence class of central
simple algebras under the relation that relates a
pair of algebras if they are both isomorphic to
full matrix rings over the same division algebra.
Algebras in the same algebra class are said to be
“similar.” See also central simple algebra.
algebra class group
Let K be a ﬁeld. Two
central simple algebras over K are said to be
similar if they are isomorphic to full matrix rings
over the same division algebra. Similarity is an
equivalence
relation,
and
the
equivalence
classes are called algebra classes. The product
of a pair of algebra classes is deﬁned by choos-
ing an algebra from each class, say A and B, and
letting the product of the classes be the algebra
class containing A ⊗K B. This product is well
deﬁned, and the algebra classes form a group un-
der this multiplication, called the algebra class
group or Brauer group.
algebra extension
Let A be an algebra over
the commutative ring R. Then by an algebra
extension of A is meant either
(i.) an algebra over R that contains A; or
(ii.) an algebra A′ containing a two-sided R-
module M which is a two-sided ideal in A′ and
is such that
A′/M = A .
In this case, M is called the kernel of the ex-
tension because it is the kernel of the canonical
homomorphism.
algebra homomorphism
Suppose A and B
are algebras of the same type, meaning that for
each n-ary operation fA on A there is a corre-
sponding n-ary operation fB on B. A mapping
φ : A →B is called a homomorphism from A
to B if, for each pair of corresponding operations
fA and fB,
φ (fA (a1, a2, . . . , an))
= fB (φ (a1) , φ (a2) , . . . , φ (an))
holds for all a1, a2, . . . , an ∈A.
Typically, an algebra A is a ring that also has
the structure of a module over another ring R, so
that an algebra homomorphism φ must satisfy
(i.) φ(a1 +a2) = φ(a1)+φ(a2) for a1, a2 ∈A,
(ii.) φ(a1a2) = φ(a1)φ(a2) for a1, a2 ∈A,
(iii.) φ(ra) = rφ(a), for r ∈R and a ∈A.

braic variety, such that there is a cycle Z in V ×T
for which each X(t) is the projection to V of the
intersection of Z and V × {t}, and X1 = X(t1),
X2 = X(t2), for some t1, t2 ∈T . Such a family
of cycles X(t) is called an algebraic family.
algebraic equivalence of divisors
Two di-
visors f and g on an irreducible variety X are
algebraically equivalent if there exists an alge-
braic family of divisors, ft, t ∈T , and points
t1 and t2 ∈T , such that f = ft1, and g = ft2.
Thus, algebraic equivalence is an algebraic ana-
log of homotopy, though the analogy is not par-
ticularly fruitful.
Algebraic equivalence has the important
property of preserving the degree of divisors;
thatis, twoalgebraicallyequivalentdivisorshave
the same degree.
It also preserves principal
divisors; that is, if one divisor of an algebrai-
cally equivalent pair is principal, then so is the
other one. (A divisor is principal if it is the di-
visor of a rational function.) Thus, the group
D0/P is a subgroup of the divisor class group
Cl0(X) = D/P . Here, D0 is the group of divi-
sors algebraically equivalent to 0, P is the group
of principal divisors, and D is the group of di-
visors of degree 0. The group D0/p is exactly
the subgroup of the divisor class group realized
by the group of points of the Picard variety of
X. See algebraic family of divisors, divisor. See
also integral divisor, irreducible variety, Picard
variety.

arc cosecant
The multiple-valued inverse of
the trigonometric function csc θ, e.g., arccsc(2)
= π/6 + 2kπ where k is an arbitrary integer
(k = 0 speciﬁes the principal value of arc cose-
cant). The principal value yields the length of
the arc on the unit circle, subtending an angle,
whose cosecant equals a given value.
The arc cosecant function is also denoted
csc−1x.
arc cosine
The multiple-valued inverse of the
trigonometric function cos θ, e.g., arccos(−1)
= π+2kπ where k is an arbitrary integer (k = 0
speciﬁes the principal value of arc cosine). The
principal value yields the length of the arc on the
unit circle, subtending an angle, whose cosine
equals a given value.
The arc cosine function is also denoted

of the trigonometric function cotan θ, e.g., arc-
cot (

3) = π/6 + 2kπ where k is an arbitrary
integer (k = 0 speciﬁes the principal value of
arc cotangent). The principal value yields the

Archimedian ordered ﬁeld
If K is an or-
dered ﬁeld and F a subﬁeld with the property
that no element of K is inﬁnitely large over F,
then we say that K is Archimedian.
Archimedian ordered ﬁeld
A set which, in
addition to satisfying the axioms for a ﬁeld, also
possesses an Archimedian ordering. That is, the
ﬁeld F is ordered in that it contains a subset P
and the following properties hold:
(i.) F is the disjoint union of P, {0}, and −P.
In other words, each x ∈F belongs either to P,
or equals 0, or −x belongs to P, and these three
possibilities are mutually exclusive.
(ii.) If x, y ∈P, then x+y ∈P and xy ∈P.
The ordered ﬁeld is also Archimedian in that
the absolute value function
|x| =



x,
if x ∈P
0,
if x = 0
−x,
if x ∈−P
is satisﬁed.
(iii.) For each x ∈F there exists a positive
integer n such that n · 1 > x.
The rational numbers are an Archimedian or-
dered ﬁeld, and so are the real numbers. The
p-adic numbers are a non-Archimedian ordered
ﬁeld.

arc sine
The multiple-valued inverse of the
trigonometric function sin θ, e.g., arcsin(1) =
π/2+2kπ where k is an arbitrary integer (k = 0
speciﬁes the principal value of arc sine). The

the unit circle, subtending an angle, whose sine
equals a given value.
The arc sine function is also denoted sin−1x.
arc tangent
The multiple-valued inverse of
the trigonometric function tan θ, e.g., arctan
(
√
3) = π/3 + 2kπ where k is an arbitrary in-
teger (k = 0 speciﬁes the principal value of arc
tangent). The principal value yields the length
of the arc on the unit circle, subtending an angle,
whose tangent equals a given value.
The arc tangent function is also denoted
tan−1x.

bounded homogeneous domain
A bounded
domain with a transitive group of auto-
morphisms. In more detail, a domain is a con-
nected open subset of complex N space CN.
A domain is homogeneous if it has a transi-

phisms. This means that any pair of points z
and w can be interchanged, i.e., φ(z) = w, by
an invertible analytic map φ carrying the do-
main onto itself. For example, the unit ball in
complex N space, {z = (z1, . . . , zN) : |z1|2 +
· · · + |zN|2 < 1}, is homogeneous. A domain
is bounded if it is contained in a ball of ﬁnite

Cauchy problem

differential equation (PDE) in z with two inde-
pendent variables, x and y, and a curve @ in the
xy-plane, a Cauchy problem for the PDE con-
sists of ﬁnding a solution z = φ(x, y) which
meets prescribed conditions
∂j+kz
∂xj∂yk = fjk
j + k ≤n −1, j, k = 0, 1, . . . , n −1 on @.

If A =  an and B =  bn, then  cn = AB

and at least one of them converges absolutely
(Merten’s Theorem).
Cauchy sequence

ement c + im δi−1 of H i(C) is called the coho-
mology class of c. Two i-cocycles belong to the
same cohomology class if and only if they dif-
fer by an i-coboundary; such cocycles are called
cohomologous.
cochain equivalence
Two cochain com-
plexes C and ˜C are said to be equivalent if
there exist cochain mappings φ : C →˜C and
ψ : ˜C →C such that φψ and ψφ are homo-
topic to the identity mappings on C and ˜C, re-
spectively.

and ˜C = { ˜Ci, ϵi : i ∈Z} be two cochain com-

mappings. A homotopy ζ : φ →ψ is a se-
quence of mappings {ζ i : i ∈Z} such that, for
each i, ζ i is a homomorphism from Ci to ˜Ci and
φi −ψi = δiζ i+1 + ζ iϵi−1 .
When such a homotopy exists, φ and ψ are said
to be homotopic and H(φ) = H(ψ), where
H(φ) and H(ψ) are the morphisms from the
cohomology module H(C) to the cohomology
module H( ˜C) induced by φ and ψ.
cochain mapping
Let C = {Ci, δi : i ∈
Z} and ˜C = { ˜Ci, ϵi : i ∈Z} be two cochain
complexes. A cochain mapping φ : C →˜C is
a sequence of mappings {φi : i ∈Z} such that,
for each i, φi is a homomorphism from Ci to ˜Ci
and
φiϵi = δiφi+1 .
The mapping φi induces a homomorphism from
the ith cohomology module H i(C) to the ith
cohomology module H i( ˜C). Hence φ can be
regarded as inducing a morphism φ∗from the
cohomology module H(C) to the cohomology
module H( ˜C). The morphism φ∗is also de-
noted H(φ). This enables H(·) to be regarded as
a functor from the category of chain complexes
to a category of graded modules; it is called the
cohomological functor.
cocommutative algebra
A coalgebra C, in
which the comultiplication 0 is cocommutative,
i.e., has the property that δτ = δ, where τ is the
ﬂip mapping, i.e., the mapping from C ⊗C to
itself that interchanges the two C factors.

sion. For example, if X is a subspace of a vector
space V and V is the direct sum of subspaces X
and X′, then the dimension of X′ is the codi-

2, 3, and 4.)
coefﬁcient of linear representation
When a
representation χ (of a group or ring) is isomor-
phic to a direct sum of linear representations and
other irreducible representations, the number of
times that a particular linear or irreducible rep-
resentation φ occurs in the direct sum is called
the coefﬁcient of φ in χ.
coefﬁcient of polynomial term
In a polyno-
mial
a0 + a1x + a2x2 + . . . + anxn ,
the constants a0, a1, . . . , an are called the coef-
ﬁcients of the polynomial. More speciﬁcally, a0
is called the constant term, a1 the coefﬁcient of
x, a2 the coefﬁcient of x2, . . . , an the coefﬁcient
of xn; an is also called the leading coefﬁcient.
coefﬁcient ring
Consider the set of numbers
or constants that are being used as coefﬁcients in
some algebraic expressions. If that set happens
to be a ring (such as the set of integers), it is
called the coefﬁcient ring. Likewise, if that set
happens to be a ﬁeld (such as the set of real
numbers) or a module, it is called the coefﬁcient
ﬁeld or coefﬁcient module, respectively.

selected from a collection of n objects, the r
selected objects are called a combination of r
objects from the collection of n objects, pro-
vided that the selected objects are all regarded
as having equal status and not as being in any
particular order. (If the r objects are put into a

plication is commutative, i.e., xy = yx, for all
elements x, y. (The axioms for a ring ensure
that addition is always commutative.) The real
numbers are a commutative ring. Rings of ma-
trices are generally not commutative.

y−1xy or xyx−1y−1 in a group. Such an el-
ement is usually denoted [x, y] and it has the
property that it equals the identity element if
and only if xy = yx, i.e., if and only if x and y
commute.
(2) An element of the form xy −yx in a ring.
Such an element is denoted [x.y] and is also
called the Lie product of x and y. It equals zero
if and only if xy = yx.

cisely of those elements of G that are expressible
as a product of a ﬁnite number of commutators.
So G′ may contain elements that are not them-
selves commutators. G′ is a characteristic sub-
group of G. G/G′ is Abelian and in fact G′ is

Corona Theorem
If f1, . . . , fn belong to
H ∞, the set of bounded analytic functions in
the unit disk D in the complex plane, and if
|f1(z)|+· · ·+|fn(z)| ≥δ > 0 in D, then there
exist g1, . . . , gn ∈H ∞with  fjgj = 1 in D.
In functional analytic terms, the theorem says
this. H ∞is a vector space under pointwise ad-
dition and scalar multiplication and a Banach
space with the norm ∥f ∥= sup |f (z)|, for z ∈
D. Further, since the pointwise product of two
bounded functions is bounded it is an algebra
with pointwise multiplication.
As a Banach
space, H ∞has a dual space H ∞′, which is
the set of all continuous linear mappings from
H ∞into the complex numbers C. A functional
λ ∈H ∞′ may have the added property of being
multiplicative, λ(fg) = λ(f )λ(g). We denote
the set of all such multiplicative linear function-
als by M. For example, if a ∈D, then the linear
functional λ(f ) = f (a) is in M and is called a
point evaluation. The set H ∞′ has a topology
whereby λa converges to λ if, for each f ∈H ∞,

The addition in this ring is addition of divisors,
and the multiplication is deﬁned by composi-
tion, that is, if C1, C2 are correspondences of X
and x ∈X, then C1 ◦C2 is the correspondence

Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams. These are used to

Coxeter group
A group with generators ri,
i ∈I, and relations of the form (rirj)aij = 1,
where all aii = 1 and whenever i ̸= j, aij > 1
(aij may be inﬁnite, implying no relation be-
tween ri and rj in such a case).
Cramer’s rule
Assume we are given n linear
equations in n unknowns. That is, we are given
the linear equations Li(X) = n
j=1 CijXj,
where the Cij are given numbers, the Xj are
unknowns and i = 1, . . . , n.
We are asked
to solve the n equations Li(X) = bj, where
j = 1, . . . , n. One can write these equations in
matricial form AX = B, where A is a square
n × n matrix and X = (X1, . . . , Xn) and B =
(b1, . . . , bn) are vectors in Rn. Cramer gave
a formula for solving these equations provid-
ing the matrix A has an inverse. Let | · | de-
note the determinant of a matrix, which maps a
square matrix to a number. (See determinant.)
The matrix A will have an inverse provided the
number |A| is not zero. So, assuming A has an
inverse (this is also referred to by saying that A
is non-singular), the solution values of Xj are
given as follows. In the matrix A, replace the
ith column of A (that is, the column made up of
Ci1, . . . , Cin) by B. We again obtain a square
matrix Ai and the solution numbers Xi = |Ai|
|A| .
If X is the n vector made up of these numbers,
it will solve the system and this is the only so-
lution.

with respect to a factor set

then the induced extension of G given by 1 →
H/[H, H] →F/[H, H] →G →1 is a 2-

If ϕ ∈H r(G, Hom(K, A)), the cup product
ϕ ∪ζ ∈H r+2(G, A) (which makes use of the

digit, d1 the tens digit, d2 the hundreds digit, d3
the thousands digit, etc.; also, d−1 is the tenths

shown that, precisely when x is rational, the se-
quence of digits of x eventually repeats. That is,
there is a smallest integer p for which di−p = di
for every i less than some ﬁxed index. Here we
call the string of digits di−1di−2 · · · di−p a re-
peating block and p the period of the represen-
tation of x. In the special case that the repeating
block is the single digit 0, the convention is to
dropallthetrailingzerosfromtherepresentation
and say that x has a ﬁnite or terminating decimal
expansion. Further, it is possible in this case to
give a second, distinct expansion of x: if x has
ﬁnite decimal expansion with ﬁnal nonzero digit
di, then another representation of x can be ob-
tained by replacing di with di −1 and deﬁning
di−1 = di−2 = · · · = 9. For example, 238.75 =

GB is the subgroup of G consisting of those

in a natural way on the residue class ﬁeld B/B

can associate an element σ ∈B/B over A/℘;
the map
σ −→σ
thereby induces a homomorphism of GB into
the group of automorphisms of B/B over A/℘.
The ﬁxed ﬁeld in GB is called the decompo-

Dedekind cut
One of the original ways of
deﬁning irrational numbers from rational ones.
A Dedekind cut (L, R) is a decomposition of
the rational numbers into two sets L and R such
that (i.) L and R are nonempty and disjoint; (ii.)
if x ∈L and y ∈R then x < y; (iii.) L has no
largest element. Thus, a rational number can be
identiﬁed with a Dedekind cut (L, R) for which
R has a least member and an irrational number
can be identiﬁed with a Dedekind cut (L, R) for
which R has no least element.

d) be a pure cubic ﬁeld and let d =

If F is of the ﬁrst
kind, then the discriminant of F is given by
d(F) = −27(ab)2 and if F is of the second

Dedekind zeta function
Let k be a number
ﬁeld and Ok be the ring of all algebraic integers

defect
If k is a ﬁeld which is complete under
an arbitrary valuation, and if E is a ﬁnite exten-
sion of degree n, with ramiﬁcation e and residue
class degree f , then ef divides n: n = ef δ, and
δ is called the defect of the extension.
defective equation
An equation, derived
from another equation, which has fewer roots
than the original equation. For example, if x2 +
x = 0 is divided by x, the resulting equation
x + 1 = 0 is defective because the root 0 was
lost in the process of division by x.
defective number
A positive integer which
is greater than the sum of all its factors (except
itself). For example, the number 10 is defective,
since the sum of its factors (except itself) is 1 +
2 + 5 = 8.
If a positive integer is equal to the sum of
all its factors (except itself), then it is called a
perfect number. If the number is less than the
sum of its factors (except itself), then it is called
abundant.
deﬁciency
Let R →F →G be a free pre-
sentation of a group G. Let {xk} be a set of
generators of F and {rk} be a set of elements
of F generating R as a normal subgroup. Then
the data P = ({xk}, {rk}) is called a group pre-
sentation of G, xk are called generators, and rk
are called relators. The group presentation P is
called ﬁnite if both {xk} and {rk} are ﬁnite. A
group G is ﬁnitely presentable if there exists a
ﬁnite group presentation for G.
The deﬁciency of a ﬁnite group presentation
P is the integer
def(P) = #{generators} −#{relators} .
The deﬁciency of a ﬁnitely presentable group G,
denoted def(G), is the maximum deﬁciency of

Av = λ1v, with v a nonzero (column) vector,
then, for any other vector u, the eigenvalues of
the matrix B = A −vuT are

By choosing uT to be a multiple of the ﬁrst row

deformation
A deformation is a transfor-

mation of a vector space V into itself which can
be represented by a diagonal matrix with respect
to some basis of V . An operator is diagonaliz-
able if and only if there is a basis for V made
up entirely of eigenvectors of the operator. See

sion one subvarieties of X (these are called “di-
visors”), modulo divisors of the form (f ) =
(f )0 −(f )∞, for all rational (or meromorphic)
functions f on X; here (f )0 is the divisor of
zeros and (f )∞is the divisor of poles.

way a new statement ˆT , called the dual of T .
Then T is true if and only if ˆT is true.
Duality Theorem
A theorem in the study
of linear programming. The Duality Theorem
states that the minimum value of c1x1 + c2x2 +
· · ·+cnxn in the original problem is equal to the
maximum value of b1y1 + b2y2 + · · · + bmym
in the dual problem, provided an optimal solu-
tion exists. If an optimal solution does not exist,
then there are two possibilities: either both fea-
sible sets are empty, or else one is empty and
the other is unbounded.
See dual linear pro-
gramming problem.

other linear programming problem which is in-
timately related to a given one. Consider the

(2) The deﬁnition above may also be stated
in matrix notation. If ⃗c is an 1 × n vector, ⃗b is
a m × 1 vector, and A is an m × n matrix, then
the original linear programming problem above
can be stated as follows: Find the n × 1 vector
⃗x which minimizes ⃗c⃗x, subject to ⃗x ≥0 and
A⃗x ≥⃗b. The dual problem is to maximize ⃗y⃗b,
subject to ⃗y ≥0 and ⃗yA ≤c.

dual module
For a module M over an ar-
bitrary ring R, the module denoted M∗, equal
to the set of all module homomorphisms (also
called linear functionals) from M to R. This
dual module is also denoted HomR(M, R) and
is, itself, a module. See also homomorphism,

dual quadratic programming problem
Suppose that P is the quadratic programming
problem:

Rn.
Then the dual quadratic programming prob-
lem PD is:
minimize
w = bT y + (1/2)xT Dx ,
subject to the constraints AT y + Dx ≥c, all
components xi ≥0, yi ≥0.
It can be shown that if x∗solves P, then PD
has solution x∗, y∗, and max z = max w.
dual representation
Let π : G →GL(V )
be a representation of the group G in the linear
space V .
Then the dual representation π∨:
G →GL(V ∗

A number sys-

bic numerals 0 through 9 are utilized, along with
two other symbols X and Q, which are used to
represent 10 (base 10) and 11 (base 10). The

dynamic programming
An approach to a
multistep decision process, in which an outcome
is calculated for each stage. In Richard Bell-
man’s approach to dynamic programming, an
optimal policy has the property that, for each ini-
tial state and decision, the subsequent decisions
must generate an optimal policy with respect to
the outcome of the initial state and initial deci-
sion. This is now the most widely used approach
to dynamic programming.

effective genus
Suppose that  is an irre-
ducible algebraic curve and ˜ is a nonsingular
curve that is birationally equivalent to . Then
the genus of ˜ is the effective genus of . An al-

eigenfunction
A function f which satisﬁes
the equation T (f ) = λf , for some number λ,
where T is a linear transformation from a space
of functions into itself. For example, if T is
the linear transformation on the space of twice
differentiable functions of one variable:
T (f ) = d2f

then cos(x) is an eigenfunction of T , with λ =
−1. Eigenfunctions arise in the analysis of par-
tial differential equations such as the heat equa-
tion. See also eigenvalue.

For an eigenvalue λ of a matrix
(or linear operator) A, the set of all eigenvectors
associated with λ, along with the zero vector.
The eigenspace is the space of all possible solu-
tions of the vector equation

See also eigenvalue, eigenvector.
eigenspace in the weaker sense
Suppose
that L is a linear space, T is a linear transfor-
mation on L, and λ is an eigenvalue of T . Then
the collection of all elements v in L such that
(T −λI)kv = 0, for some integer k > 0, is the
eigenspace in the weaker sense, corresponding
to the eigenvalue λ. Such an element v is some-
times called a root vector of T .

For an n × n matrix (or a linear
operator) A, a number λ, such that there exists a

be factored into the product of two polynomials
with rational coefﬁcients and positive degrees.
elementary divisor (of square matrix)
For
a matrix A with entries in a ﬁeld F, one of the
ﬁnitely many monic polynomials hi, 1 ≤i ≤s,
over F, such that h1|h2| · · · |hs, and A is simi-
lar to the block diagonal sum of the companion

1 ≤i ≤s, such that I1 ⊆I2 ⊆· · · ⊆Is

In the special case where n = 1, every matrix
(λ) is an elementary Jordan matrix. (In other
words, one can forget about the 1s below the
diagonal if there is no room for them.)
It is easier to understand this if we phrase it in
the language of linear operators rather than ma-
trices. An elementary Jordan matrix is a square
matrix representing a linear operator T with re-
spect to a basis e1, . . . , en, such that T e1 =
λe1+e2, T e2 = λe2+e3, . . . , T en−1 = λen−1+
en, and T en = λen. Thus (T −λI)n = 0, that
is T −λI must be nilpotent, but n is the smallest
positive integer for which this is true. Here, I is
the identity operator, and the scalar λ is called
the generalized eigenvalue for T .
It is a theorem of linear algebra that every
matrix with entries in an algebraically complete
ﬁeld, such as the complex numbers, is similar
to a direct sum of elementary Jordan matrices.
See Jordan canonical form. The inﬁnite dimen-
sional analog of this theorem is false.
How-
ever, shift operators, that is operators S such that
Sei = ei+1, for i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , play a promi-
nent role in operator theory on inﬁnite dimen-
sional Hilbert and Banach spaces. The connec-
tion between shift operators and elementary Jor-
dan matrices is that the nilpotent operator T −λI
may be thought of as the ﬁnite dimensional ana-
log of the shift S.
elementary symmetric polynomial

nomial of several variables that is invariant un-
der permutation of its variables, and which can-

variables x1, . . . , xn, the elementary symmetric
polynomialsareσ1, · · · , σn, whereσk isthesum
of all products of k of the variables x1, . . . , xn.
For example, if n = 3, then σ1 = x1 + x2 + x3,
σ2 = x1x2 + x1x3 + x2x3 and σ3 = x1x2x3.
elimination of variable
A method used to
solve a system of equations in more than one
variable. First, in one of the equations, we solve
for one of the variables. We then substitute that
solution into the rest of the equations. For ex-
ample, when solving the system of equations:
2x + 4y
= 10
8x + 9y
= 47
we can solve the ﬁrst equation for x, yielding:
x = 5−2y. Then, substituting this solution into
the second equation, we have 8(5 −2y) + 9y =
47, which we can then solve for y. Once we
have a value for y, we can then determine the
value for x. See also Gaussian elimination.
elliptic curve
A curve given by the equation
y2 + a1xy + a2y = x3 + a3x2 + a4x + a5
where each ai is an integer. Elliptic curves were
important in the recent proof of Fermat’s Last
Theorem. See Fermat’s Last Theorem.
elliptic function ﬁeld
The ﬁeld of functions
of an elliptic curve;
a ﬁeld of the form
k(x, √f (x)), where k is a ﬁeld, x is an inde-
terminant over k, and f (x) is a separable, cubic
polynomial, with coefﬁcients in k.

Here 0 < k2 < 1 and a is an arbitrary con-
stant. The constant k is called the modulus. If
x = 1, or equivalently, if φ = π/2, then the
elliptic integral is called complete; otherwise, it
is incomplete.
elliptic transformation
A linear fractional
transformation w = T z of the complex plane
which can be written as
w −a
w −b = k z −a
z −b
for some unimodular constant k.
endomorphism
(1) A function from a space
into itself, satisfying additional conditions de-
pending on the nature of the space. For exam-
ple, when one studies groups, an endomorphism
is a function F from a group G into itself such
that F(x + y) = F(x) + F(y) for all x and y in
G.
(2) A morphism in a category, with the prop-
erty that its domain and range coincide.
endomorphism ring
The ring consisting of
all endomorphisms (from a space A with an
additive structure to itself) with addition given
by the addition in A and multiplication coming
from composition. See endomorphism.
entire algebroidal function
An algebroidal
function f (z) that has no pole in |z| < ∞. See
algebroidal function.
entire linear transformation
Consider a lin-
ear fractional transformation (also known as a
Möbius transformation) in the complex plane;
that is, a function given by
S(z) = az + b
cz + d ,
where a, b, c, and d are complex numbers. If
c = 0 and d ̸= 0, S(z) becomes a typical linear
transformation, which is also an entire function.
enveloping algebra
Let B be a subset of an
associative algebra A with multiplicative iden-
tity 1. The subalgebra B† of A containing 1 and
generated by B is called the enveloping algebra
of B in A. See associative algebra.
enveloping von Neumann algebra
Let A de-
note a C∗-algebra and S denote the state space
of A. For each state φ ∈S, let (πφ, Hφ, ψφ)
denote the cyclic representation of φ. Here πφ
is a representation of A on the Hilbert space Hφ.
The linear span of vectors of the form πφ(a)ψφ,
for a ∈A, is dense in Hφ. Let HS be the direct
sum Hilbert space of the spaces Hφ, as φ varies
through S, and let πS be the representation of
A on HS obtained from the direct sum of the
representations πφ, for φ ∈S. The enveloping
von Neumann algebra of A is the closure A′′ of
πS(A) with respect to the weak operator topol-
ogy. Because πS is a faithful representation, A
can now be viewed as a C∗-subalgebra of the
von Neumann algebra A′′.
The enveloping von Neumann algebra A′′
of a C∗-algebra A is isomorphic, as a Banach
space, to the second dual of A. If m is a von Neu-
mann algebra, G is a locally compact group and
if α : G →Aut(m) is a continuous group homo-
morphism, where the automorphism group
Aut(m) has the topology of weak convergence,
then the W ∗-crossed product algebra m ×α G
arises as the enveloping von Neumann algebra
of a certain C∗-crossed product afﬁliated with
the W ∗-dynamical system (m, G, α).
epimorphism
A morphism e in a category,
such that the equation f ◦e = g ◦e for mor-
phisms f and g in the category implies that
f = g. In most familiar categories, such as
the category of sets and functions, an epimor-
phism is simply a surjective or onto function in
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

the category. A function e from set X to set
Y is surjective or onto if e(X) = Y, that is if
every element y ∈Y is the image e(x) of an el-
ement x ∈X. See also morphism in a category,
monomorphism, surjection.
Epstein zeta function
A function, ζQ(s, M),
deﬁned by Epstein in 1903. Let V be a vector
space over R having dimension n. Let M be a
lattice in V and Q(X) a positive deﬁnite qua-
dratic form deﬁned on V . Then, ζQ(s, M) is
deﬁned for complex numbers s by
ζQ(s, M) =

x∈M\{0}

gent when ℜs > m

where a(k) denotes the number of distinct x ∈
M with Q(x) = k. The Epstein zeta function,
in general, has no Euler product expansion. See
also Riemann zeta function.
equal fractions
Two fractions (of positive
integers), m
n and k
ℓ, are equal if mℓ= nk. If
the greatest common divisor of m and n is 1 and
the greatest common divisor of k and ℓis also
1, then the two fractions are equal if and only if
m = k and n = ℓ.
equality
(1) The property that two mathemat-
ical objects are identical. For example, two sets
A, B are equal if they have the same elements;
we write A = B. Two vectors in a ﬁnite dimen-
sional vector space are equal if their coefﬁcients
with respect to a ﬁxed basis of the vector space
are the same.
(2) An equation. See equation.
equation
An assertion of equality, usually
between two mathematical expressions f , g in-
volvingnumbers, parameters, andvariables. We
write f = g. When the equation involves one
or more variables, the equality asserted may be
true for some or all values of the variables. A
natural question then arises: For which values
of the variables is the equality true? The task of
answering this question is referred to as solving
the equation.
equivalence class
Given an equivalence re-
lation R on a set S and an x ∈S, the equivalence
class of x, usually denoted by [x], consists of all
y ∈S such that (x, y) ∈R. Clearly, x ∈[x],
and (x, y) ∈R if and only if [x] = [y]. As
a consequence, the equivalence classes of R in-
duce a partition of the set S into non-overlapping
subsets.
equivalence properties
The deﬁning prop-
erties of an equivalence relation R ⊆S × S;
namely, thatR isreﬂexive((x, x) ∈R forallx ∈
S), symmetric ((x, y) ∈R whenever (y, x) ∈
R), and transitive ((x, z) ∈R whenever (x, y) ∈
R and (y, z) ∈R). See also relation, equiva-
lence class.
equivalence relation
A relation R on a set
S (that is, a subset of S × S), which is reﬂex-
ive, symmetric, and transitive. (See equivalence
properties.) For example, let S be the set of all
integers and R the subset of S × S deﬁned by
(x, y) ∈R if x −y is a multiple of 2. Then R is
an equivalence relation because for all x, y, z ∈
S, (x, x) ∈R (reﬂexive), (x, y) ∈R whenever
(y, x) ∈R (symmetric), and (x, z) ∈R when-
ever (x, y) ∈R and (y, z) ∈R (transitive).
equivalent divisors
See algebraic equiva-
lence of divisors.
equivalent equations
Equations that are sat-
isﬁed by the same set of values of their respec-
tive variables. For example, the equation x2 =
3y−1 is equivalent to the equation 6w−2z2 = 2
because their solutions coincide.
equivalent valuations
Let φ : F →R+ be
a valuation on a ﬁeld F (here R+ denotes the set
of all nonnegative real numbers). The valuation
φ gives rise to a metric on F, where the open
neighborhoods are the open spheres centered at
a ∈F deﬁned by
{b ∈F | φ(b −a) < ϵ}, ϵ ∈R+ .
Two valuations are called equivalent if they in-
duce the same topology on F.

error
In the context of numerical analysis, an
error occurs when a real number x is being ap-
proximated by another real number ˆx. A typical
example arises in the implementation of numeri-
caloperationsoncomputingmachines, wherean
error occurs whenever a real number x is made
machine representable either by rounding off or
by truncating at a certain digit. For example, if
x = 4.567, truncation at the third digit yields
ˆx = 4.56 while rounding off at the third digit
yields ˆx = 4.57.
There are two common ways to measure the
error in approximating x by ˆx: The quantity
|x −ˆx|
is referred to as the absolute error, and the quan-
tity
|x −ˆx|
|x|
(x ̸= 0)
is referred to as the relative error. The concept
of error is also used in the approximation of a
vector x ∈Rn by ˆx ∈Rn; the absolute value in
the formulae above are then replaced by some
vector norm. In particular, if we use the inﬁnity
norm, and if the relative error is approximately
10−k, then we can deduce that the largest in ab-
solute value entry of ˆx has approximately k cor-
rect signiﬁcant digits.
étale
Let X and Y be schemes of ﬁnite type
over k. A morphism f : X →Y is called étale
if it is smooth of relative dimension 0.
étale morphism
A morphism f : X →Y is
said to be étale at a point x ∈X if dxf induces
an isomorphism CxX →Cf (x)Y of the corre-
sponding tangent cones (viewed as schemes).
étale site
Let X be a scheme, let S/X be
the category of schemes over X and let C/X
be a full subcategory of S/X that is closed un-
der ﬁber products and is such that, for any mor-
phism Y →X in C/X and any étale morphism
U →Y, the composite U →X is in C/X. The
category C/X, together with the étale topology
of C/X, is the étale site over X. See étale topol-
ogy.
étale topology
Let Y be a connected, closed
subscheme of a normal variety X and assume
that Y is G2 in X. Let X′ be the normaliza-
tion of X in K(
X), and let f : X′ →X be
the natural map. Then there is a subvariety Y ′
of X′ which is G3 in X′ and such that f

Y ′ is
an isomorphism of Y ′ onto Y, and such that f
is étale at points of X′ in a suitable neighbor-
hood of Y ′. Then (X′, Y ′) is an étale neighbor-
hood of (X, Y). The étale neighborhoods form
a subbasis for the étale topology. See also étale
morphism.
Euclidean domain
Let R be a ring. Then R
is an integral domain if x, y ∈R and xy = 0
implies either x = 0 or y = 0. An integral
domain is Euclidean if there is a function d from
the non-zero elements of R to the non-negative
integers such that
(i.) For x ̸= 0, y ̸= 0, both elements of R, we
have d(x) ≤d(xy);
(ii.) Given non-zero elements x, y ∈R, there
exists s, t ∈R such that y = sx + t, where
either t = 0 or d(t) < d(x).
Euclidian Algorithm
An algorithm for ﬁnd-
ing the greatest common divisor g.c.d. (m, n),
of two positive integers m, n satisfying m > n.
It can be described as follows:
1. Divide n into m, i.e., ﬁnd a positive
integer p and a real number r so that
m = pn + r, 0 ≤r < n.
2. If r = 0, then g.c.d. (m, n) = n.
3. If r ̸= 0, then g.c.d. (m, n) = g.c.d. (n, r);
replace m by n and n by r and
repeat step 1.
After possibly several iterations, the process al-
ways terminates by detecting a zero remainder
r. Then g.c.d. (m, n) equals the value of the
last nonzero remainder detected. The following
example illustrates this algorithm:
954 = 29 × 32 + 26,
32 = 1 × 26 + 6,
26 = 4 × 6 + 2,
6 = 3 × 2 + 0.
Hence g.c.d. (954, 32) = 2. The algorithm can
be modiﬁed so that the remainder in step 1 is the
smallest number r (in absolute value) satisfying
0 ≤|r| ≤n. This may lead to fewer required
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

iterations. For example, the modiﬁed algorithm
for the above numbers yields
954 = 30 × 32 −6,
32 = 5 × 6 + 2,
6 = 3 × 2 + 0.
Hence g.c.d. (954, 32) = 2 in three iterations.
Euclid ring
An integral domain R such that
there exists a function d(·) from the nonzero el-
ements of R into the nonnegative integers which
satisﬁes the following properties:
(i.) For all nonzero a, b ∈R, d(a) ≤d(ab).
(ii.)
For any nonzero a, b ∈R, there exist
p, r ∈R such that a = pb + r, where either
r = 0 or d(r) < d(b).
The integers with ordinary absolute value as
the function d(·) is an example of a Euclid ring.
Also the Gaussian integers, consisting of all the
complex numbers x+iy where x, y are integers,
form a Euclid ring; d(x + iy) = x2 + y2 serves
as the required function.
Also called Euclidian ring.

simplicial complex of dimension n, and let αr
denote the number of r-simplexes of K. The
Euler-Poincaré characteristic is

χ(K) is a generalization of the Euler charac-

spectively, the numbers of vertices, edges, and
faces of a simple closed polyhedron (namely, a
polyhedron that is topologically equivalent to
a sphere).
Euler’s Theorem in combinatorial

Euler product
Consider the Riemann zeta

Euler observed that

1 −p−s ,
where p runs over all prime numbers. This in-
ﬁnite product is called the Euler product. One
of the main questions regarding zeta functions
is whether they have similar inﬁnite product ex-
pansions, usually referred to as Euler product
expansions.
Euler’s formula
The expression
eiz = cos z + i sin z ,
where i =

ing the inﬁnite series expansions of ez, sin z and

even element
Let Q be a quadratic form with
nonzero discriminant on an n-dimensional vec-
tor space V , over a ﬁeld F, of characteristic
not equal to 2. Let C(Q) denote the Clifford
algebra of Q.
Then C(Q) is the direct sum
C+(Q) + C−(Q), where
C+(Q)
=

The elements of C+(Q) and C−(Q) are called

the method for addition of integers. Consider
the sum

The sum of digits of 683, 256, and 939 are 17 ≡

mally deﬁned by

where Sn denotes the symmetric group of de-
gree n (the group of all n! permutations of the
set {1, 2, . . . , n}), and where sgn(σ) denotes the
sign of the permutation σ. (sgn(σ) = 1 if σ is
an even permutation and sgn(σ) = −1 if σ is
an odd permutation.) The formula in the equa-
tion above is referred to as the expansion of the
determinant of A.
exponent
Given an element a of a multiplica-
tivealgebraicstructure, theproductofa·a·. . .·a,
in which a appears k times, is written as ak and
k is referred to as the exponent of ak. The sim-
plest example is when a is a real number. In
this case, we can also give meaning to negative
exponents by a−k = 1/ak (assuming that k is
a positive integer and that a ̸= 0). We deﬁne
a0 = 1. The basic laws of exponents of real
numbers are the following:
(1) akam = ak+m,
(2) ak/am = ak−m (a ̸= 0),
(3) (ak)m = akm,
where k and m are nonnegative integers. We
can extend the deﬁnition to rational exponents
m/n, where m is any integer and n is a positive
integer, by deﬁning am/n = n√
am. Synonyms
for the exponent are the words index and power.
See also exponential mapping.
exponential function of a matrix
Let A be
an n × n matrix over the complex numbers C.
The exponential function f (A) = eA is deﬁned

Letting ∥· ∥denote the Euclidean vector norm,
as well as the induced matrix norm, we can show
that the exponential function of a matrix is well
deﬁned (i.e., the series is convergent) by show-
ing that it is absolutely convergent. Indeed, in-
voking well-known inequalities, and the deﬁni-
tion of the real exponential function ex, we have
that ∥eA∥equals

One basic property of eA is that its eigenval-
ues are of the form eλ, where λ is an eigenvalue
of A.
It follows that eA is always a nonsin-
gular matrix.
Also, the exponential property
eA+B = eAeB holds if and only if A and B
commute, that is, AB = BA.
The exponential function of a matrix arises
in the solution of systems of linear differential
equations in the vector form dx(t)/dt = Ax(t),
t ≥0, where x(t) ∈Cn. If the initial condition
x(0) = x0 is speciﬁed, then the unique solution
to this differential problem is given by x(t) =
etAx0.
exponential mapping
The mapping (func-
tion) f (x) = ex, where x ∈R and e is the base
of the natural logarithm. (See e.) The expo-
nential mapping is the inverse mapping of the
natural logarithm function: y = ex if and only
if x = ln y. Mclaurin’s Theorem yields

in which a appears k times. See also exponent.
expression

mathematical quantities such as scalars, vari-
ables, parameters, functions, and sets, as well as
relational and logical operators such as equality,
conjunction, existence, union, etc.
exsecant function
A trigonometric function
deﬁned via the secant of an angle as exsecθ =
secθ −1. Similarly, we deﬁne the excosecant
function as excosecθ = cscθ −1.
extension
Given a subﬁeld E of a ﬁeld F,
namely, a subset of F that is a ﬁeld with respect
to the operations deﬁned in F, we call F an
extension ﬁeld of E. The ﬁeld F can be regarded
as a vector space over E.
The dimension of
F over E is called the degree of the extension
ﬁeld F over E. If f1, . . . , fp ∈F, then by
E(f1, . . . , fp) we denote the smallest subﬁeld
of F containing E and f1, . . . , fp. E(f1) is
called a simple extension of E.
If every element of E is algebraic over F, we
call E an algebraic extension. Otherwise, we
call E a transcendental extension.
The notion of extension also applies to rings.
See also number ﬁeld.
extension of coefﬁcient ring
Let R[t] be the
ring of polynomials over the (coefﬁcient) ring
R in the indeterminate t. As the notion of ex-
tension can also concern a ring, an extension of
R is usually referred to as the extension of the
coefﬁcient ring of R[t]. See extension, ring of
polynomials.
extension of valuation
If v is a valuation on
a ﬁeld F and if K is an extension of F, then an
extension of v to K is a valuation w on K such
that w(x) = v(x), for x ∈F. See valuation.
exterior algebra
Let V be a vector space
over a ﬁeld F. Let also T0(V ) denote the direct
sum of the tensor products V ⊗. . . ⊗V . T0(V )
is called the contravariant tensor algebra over
V and is equipped with the product ⊗as well
as addition and scalar multiplication. Let S be
formed by all elements of T0(V ) of the type v ⊗
v, as well as their sums, scalar multiples and
their products with arbitrary elements in T0(V ).
Then S is a subgroup of (the Abelian group)
T0(V ) and the quotient group T0(V )/S can be
c

considered. This quotient group can be made
into an algebra by deﬁning the operations · and
 as follows:
c · (t + S) = ct + S (c ∈F) ,
(t1 + S)

(t2 + S) = (t1 ⊗t2) + S .
The operation  is called the exterior product
of the exterior algebra T0(V )/S of V , which is
denoted by  V .
 V is also known as the
Grassmann algebra of V . The image of v1 ⊗
. . . ⊗vp under the natural mapping T0(V ) →
 V is denoted by v1 ∧. . .∧vp and is called the
exterior product of v1, . . . , vp ∈V . In general,
the image of V ⊗. . . ⊗V with p factors under
the above natural mapping is called the p-fold
exterior power of V and is denoted by p V .
The exterior product satisﬁes some important
rules and properties. For example, it is multilin-
ear, v1 ∧. . . ∧vp = 0 if and only if v1, . . . , vp
are linearly dependent, and u∧v = (−1)pq v∧u
whenever u ∈p V and v ∈q V .

external product
Given two groups G1, G2,
the external (direct) product of G1, G2 is the
group G = G1 × G2 formed by the set of all
pairs (g1, g2) with g1 ∈G1 and g2 ∈G2; the
operation in G is deﬁned to be
(g1, g2)

g′

This deﬁnition can be extended in the obvious
way to any collection of groups G1, G2, . . . .
The operation in each component is carried out
in the corresponding group. The external prod-
uct coincides with the external sum of groups if
the number of groups is ﬁnite. See also internal
product.
Ext group
The Ext group is deﬁned in several
subjects. For example, if A is an Abelian group
and if
0 →R →F →A →0
is any free resolution of A, then for every Abel-
ian group B, there exists a group Ext(A, B) such
that
0 →Hom(A, B) →Hom(F, B)
→Hom(R, B) →Ext(A, B) →0
is exact; moreover, the group is independent of
the choice of the free resolution of A. The el-
ements of Ext(A, B) are equivalence classes of
short exact sequences 0 →B →M →A →0
and addition is induced by Baer sum.
The Ext group is also deﬁned in homological
algebra, topology, and operator algebras. The
group Ext(A, B) is called the group of exten-
sions of B by A.

(1) An integer n is a factor (or divisor)
of an integer m if m = nk for some integer k.
Thus, ±1, ±2, and ±4 are all the factors of 4.
More generally, given a commutative monoid
M that satisﬁes the cancellation law, b ∈M is a
factor of a ∈M if a = bc for some c ∈M. We
then usually write b|a. See also prime, factor of
polynomial.
(2) A von Neumann algebra whose center is

factor group
Let G be a group and let H
denote a normal subgroup of G. The set of left
(or right) cosets of G, denoted by
G/H = {aH : a ∈G} ,
forms a group under the operation (aH)(bH) =
(ab)H and is called the factor group or the quo-
tient group of G relative to H.
The factor groups of a group G can be useful
in revealing important information about G. For
example, letting C(G) represent the center of
G, if G/C(G) is cyclic it follows that G is an
Abelian group.
factorial
The factorial of a positive integer n

an integer n > 1, the Fundamental Theorem
of Arithmetic states that n can be expressed as
a product of positive prime numbers, uniquely,
apart from the order of the factors. The process
of ﬁnding these prime factors is referred to as
the prime factoring or the prime factorization
of n. See also division algorithm, factoring of
polynomials.
factoring of polynomials
The process of
ﬁnding factors of a polynomial f (x) ∈F[x]
over a ﬁeld F. If f (x) has positive degree, then
f (x) can be expressed as a product
f (x) = cg1(x)g2(x) . . . gr(x) ,
where c ∈F and g1, g2, . . . , gr are irreducible
and monic polynomials in F[x]. This is referred
to as the prime factoring or the prime factoriza-
tion of f (x) and is unique apart from the order
of the factors.
If f (x) ∈F[x] is monic and has positive
degree, then there is an extension ﬁeld E of F,
so that f (x) can be factored into
f (x) = (x −r1) (x −r2) . . . (x −rk)
in E[x]. The ﬁeld E is the splitting ﬁeld of f (x)
and it satisﬁes E = F(r1, r2, . . . , rk), where
r1, r2, . . . , rk are the roots of f (x) in E.
If
the ﬁeld F is algebraically closed (for example
the complex numbers), then E = F. See also
Factor Theorem, division algorithm.
factor of polynomial
A polynomial g(x) ∈
F[x] over a ﬁeld F is a factor of f (x) ∈F[x]
if f (x) = g(x)h(x) for some h(x) ∈F[x]. For
example, g(x) = x −1 is a factor of f (x) =
x2 −1. See also factoring of polynomials.

⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

(i.e., a group with the structure of a topological
space so that the mappings (x, y) →xy and
x →x−1 are continuous). Let U be a unitary
representation of G, namely, a homomorphism
of G into the group of unitary operators on H
that is strongly continuous. If the von Neumann
algebra M generated by {Ug : g ∈G} and its
commutant M′ satisfy
M ∩M′ = {z1 : z ∈C} ,
then U is called a factor representation of G.
factor set
Suppose A is an Abelian group
and G is an operator group acting on A. Then
every element σ ∈G deﬁnes an automorphism
a →aσ ofAsuchthat(atau)σ = aστ. Afactor
set is a collection of elements {aσ,τ : σ, τ ∈G}
in A such that

Factor Theorem
The linear term (x −a) is
a factor of the polynomial f (x) ∈F[x] over a
ﬁeld F if and only if f (a) = 0.
It is an immediate corollary of the Remainder
Theorem. ( See Remainder Theorem.) The Fac-
tor Theorem can be useful in ﬁnding factors of
polynomials: If f (x) = x4 + x3 + x2 + 3x −6,
thenoneknowsthatifa isaninteger, then(x−a)
is a factor of f (x) only if a divides 6. Hence it
makes sense to search for integer roots of f (x)
among the factors of 6.
faithful function
Let V and W be partially
ordered vector spaces with positive proper cones
V + and W +, respectively. A function f : V →
W is said to be faithful if f (x) = 0, with x ∈
V +, occurs only in the case where x = 0.
As an example, let V be the complex vec-
tor space of n × n matrices with positive cone
V + consisting of all positive semideﬁnite ma-
trices. Let W be the complex ﬁeld and W + =
[0, ∞), and let f : V →W be the trace func-
tion: f (x) = trace(x) = n
i=1 xii, for all
x = (xij) ∈V . Then f is a faithful function.
Faithful functions arise in the theory of C∗-
algebras, as follows: Let A be a C∗-algebra.
By a theorem of Gelfand, Naimark, and Segal,
there is a faithful C∗-algebra homomorphism
ρ : A →B(H), where B(H) is the C∗-algebra
of bounded linear operators acting on a Hilbert
space H. See partially ordered space.
faithful R-module
A module M over a ring
R such that, whenever r ∈R satisﬁes rM = 0,
then r = 0. Also called faithfully ﬂat.
false position
The method of false position
(or regular falsi method) is a numerical method
for approximating a root r of a function f (x),
given initial approximations r0 and r1 that sat-
isfy f (r0)f (r1) < 0. The next approximation
r2 is chosen to be the x-intercept of the line
through the points (r0, f (r0)) and (r1, f (r1)).
Then r3 is chosen as follows: If f (r1)f (r2) < 0
we choose r3 to be the x-intercept of the line
through the points (r1, f (r1)) and (r2, f (r2)).
Otherwise, we choose r3 as the x-intercept
of the line through the points (r0, f (r0)) and
(r2, f (r2)), and swap the indices of p0 and p1
to continue. This process ensures that succes-
sive approximations enclose the root r. See also
secant method.

Pierre Fermat wrote a version of this theo-
rem in the margin of his copy of Diophantus’

marvelous proof but that there was not enough
space in the margin to present it.
This assertion is known as Fermat’s Last The-
orem, because it was the last unresolved piece
of Fermat’s work. A proof eluded mathemati-
cians for over 300 years. In 1993, A. J. Wiles
announced a proof of the conjecture. Some gaps
and errors that were found in the original proof
were corrected and published in the Annals of
Mathematics in 1995.

ﬁeld
A commutative ring F with multiplica-
tion identity 1, all of whose nonzero elements
are invertible with respect to multiplication: for
any nonzero a ∈F there exists c ∈F such that
ac = 1. We usually write c = a−1. It fol-
lows that if a, b ∈F are nonzero elements of a
ﬁeld, then so is ab, namely, every ﬁeld is an inte-
gral domain. Well-known examples of ﬁelds are
the rational numbers, the real numbers, and the
complex numbers with the familiar operations
of multiplication and addition. Also the residue
ring modulo p, Zp, is a ﬁeld when p is a prime
integer. See ring.
ﬁeld of quotients
Let D ̸= 0 be a com-
mutative integral domain and let D∗denote its
nonzero elements. Consider the relation ≡in
D × D∗deﬁned by (a, b) ≡(c, d) if ad = bc.
It can be shown that ≡is an equivalence relation.
(See equivalence relation.) Denote the equiva-
lence class determined by (a, b) as a/b (called
a quotient or a fraction) and let F = {a/b} be
the quotient set determined by ≡. We can now
equip F with addition, multiplication, an ele-
ment 0, and an element 1 so that it becomes a
ﬁeld as follows:
a/b + c/d = (ad + bc)/bd ,
(a/b) · (c/d) = ac/bd ,
0 = 0/1, and 1 = 1/1 .
It can be shown that the above operations +, ·
deﬁne single-valued compositions in F and that
F with the above 0 and 1 is a commutative ring.
Moreover, if a/b ̸= 0, then a ̸= 0 and b/a is
the inverse of b/a. This shows that F is a ﬁeld;
it is called the ﬁeld of quotients or the ﬁeld of
fractions (or rational expressions) of D.

A ﬁltration of a module M is a

such that Mk+1 ⊂Mk for all k ∈Z. See also

ﬁnite
A term associated with the number of
elements in a set. A set S is ﬁnite if there ex-
ists a natural number n and a one-to-one corre-
spondence between the elements of S and the
elements of the set {1, 2, . . . , n}. We may then
write |S| = n. The fact that a set S is ﬁnite is de-
noted by |S| < ∞and we say that S consists of a
ﬁnite number of elements. See also cardinality,
ﬁnite function.
ﬁnite Abelian group
A group G that is ﬁnite,
as a set, and commutative; namely for any a, b ∈
G, ab = ba. See also ﬁnite, Abelian group.
ﬁnite basis
A basis of a vector space V over
a ﬁeld F, comprising a ﬁnite number of vectors.
More precisely, a ﬁnite basis of V is a ﬁnite set
of vectors B = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} ⊂V with two
properties:
(i.) B is a spanning set of V , that is, every
vector of V is a linear combination of the vectors
in B.
(ii.) B consists of linearly independent vec-
tors (over the speciﬁed ﬁeld F).
A (ﬁnite) basis of a vector space is not, in
general, unique. However, all the bases of V
have the same number of vectors. This number
is called the dimension of V . Here the dimen-
sion of V is n and thus V is referred to as a ﬁnite
dimensional vector space.
The set of vectors {ei}n
i=1, consisting of the
vectors ei ∈Rn whose ith entry is one and all
other entries equal zero, is a ﬁnite basis for the
vector space Rn. It is usually called the standard
basis of Rn.
ﬁnite continued fraction
Let q be a contin-
ued fraction deﬁned by q = p1 + 1/q1, where
q1 = p2 + 1/q2, q2 = p3 + 1/q3, . . . , and
where pi, qi are numbers or functions of a vari-
able. See continued fraction. If the expression
q terminates after a ﬁnite number of terms, then
q is a ﬁnite continued fraction. For example,
q = 1 +

ﬁnite ﬁeld
A ﬁeld F which is a ﬁnite set. In
such a case, the prime ﬁeld of F can be identiﬁed
with Zp, the ﬁeld of residue classes, modulo p,
for some prime integer p. (See prime ﬁeld.) It
follows that |F| = pn for some integer n. We
c

thus have the fundamental fact that the num-
ber of elements (cardinality) of a ﬁnite ﬁeld is
a power of a prime integer. Moreover, all ﬁnite
ﬁelds of the same cardinality are isomorphic.
ﬁnite function
(1) A function f : X →Y
which is ﬁnite, when thought of as a subset of
the Cartesian product X × Y. It follows that f
is ﬁnite if and only if its domain X is a ﬁnite set.
(2) A function from a set X to the extended
real or complex numbers (R ∪{±∞} or C ∪
{±∞}), never taking the values ±∞. See also
semiﬁnite function.
ﬁnite graded module
See graded module.
ﬁnite group
A group, which is ﬁnite as a set.
An example of a ﬁnite group is the symmetric
group, Sn, of degree n, having n! elements. In
fact, any ﬁnite group with n elements is isomor-
phic to some subgroup of Sn. See symmetric
group.
ﬁnitely generated group
A group G that
consists of all possible ﬁnite products of the el-
ements of a ﬁnite set S. We usually write
G = ⟨S⟩= {s1s2 . . . sk : si ∈S}
and we call S a set of generators of S.
The
simplest example is a cyclic group, namely, a
group G generated by one element a. We then
write G = ⟨{a}⟩= {ak : k ∈Z}.
ﬁnitelygeneratedideal
AnidealI inaringR
such that I contains elements i1, . . . , ik which,

ﬁnitely generated module
Let A be a ring
and M an A-module. We say that M is ﬁnitely
generated if there is a ﬁnite set {x1, x2, . . . , xk}
of elements of M such that, for each element
x ∈M, there exist scalars ai ∈A, so that
x =

We refer to {x1, x2, . . . , xk} as a system of gen-
erators of M.
ﬁnitely presented group
Let F be the free
group generated by a1, a2, . . . , an and G be a
group generated by b1, b2, . . . , bn. Then there
is a homomorphism h of F onto G. If the ker-
nel of h is the minimal normal subgroup of F
containing the classes of words
w1 (a1 . . . , an) , . . . , wm (a1 . . . , an) ,
then
w1 (b1 . . . , bn) = 1, . . . , wm (b1 . . . , bn) = 1
are the deﬁning relations of G. If m and n are
both ﬁnite, we call G a ﬁnitely presented group.
Finiteness Theorem
(1) (Finiteness theo-
rem of Hilbert concerning ﬁrst syzygies) There
are only ﬁnitely many ﬁrst syzygies. See ﬁrst
syzygy.
(2) (Completeness of predicate calculus) If a
proposition H is provable (derivable) from a set
of statements X, then there exists a ﬁnite subset
X∗⊂X from which H can also be derived.
ﬁnite nilpotent group
A group G, which
is both ﬁnite and nilpotent. See nilpotent group.
The following conditions are equivalent to being
nilpotent for a ﬁnite group:
(i.) G has at least one central series.
(ii.) The upper central series of subgroups Zi
of G,
{e} ≡Z0 ⊂Z1 ⊂Z2 ⊂. . .
ends with Zn ≡G for some ﬁnite n ∈N.
(iii.) The lower central series of G

whose factor groups Gi/Gi+1, i = 0, . . . , n −

(i.e., cyclic groups of prime order).
ﬁrst factor of class number
The class num-
ber h of the p-th cyclotomic ﬁeld Kp, where p
is a prime, is a product h = h1h2 of two factors
h1 and h2, called, respectively, the ﬁrst and the
second factor of the class number h.

plicatively independent units εi (i = 0, . . . , r −

Remark: Km = Q(ξm), ξm = e2πi/m is an al-
gebraic number ﬁeld obtained by adjoining an
m-th primitive root of unity to Q. It is a Ga-
lois extension over Q of degree φ(m), where φ

ﬁrst syzygy
Let R = k[x1, . . . , xn] be a poly-
nomial ring of n variables x1, . . . , xn over a ﬁeld
k and, relying on the natural gradation of R [i.e.,
deg (xi) = 1, deg (c) = 0 for c ∈k], let M be
a ﬁnitely generated graded R-module. Desig-
nate by (f1, . . . , fm) a minimal basis of M over
R consisting of homogeneous elements. Intro-
duce m indeterminates gi (i = 1, . . . , m) and

them. Requiring that deg (gj) = deg (fj), j =

graded R-module. The kernel of a graded R-
homomorphism φ : F →M, M = φ(F), de-
ﬁned by φ(gj) = fj is referred to as the ﬁrst
syzygy. It is uniquely determined by M up to a
graded R-module isomorphism.
(More generally: Let R be a Noetherian ring,
M a ﬁnitely generated R-module. Then one can
ﬁnd a ﬁnitely generated free R-module F and an
R-homomorphism φ : F →M (onto), whose
kernel deﬁnes the ﬁrst syzygy of M.)
ﬁxed component
The maximal positive divi-
sor <0 that is contained in all divisors of a linear
system < is called the ﬁxed component of <.
Let V be a complete irreducible variety, f0,
f1, . . . , fn the elements of the function ﬁeld
k(V ) of V , and D a divisor ring on V such that
(fi) + D ≥0, for all i. Then the set < of the
divisors of the form (<aifi) + D, with ai ∈k
not all zero, is called a linear system.
ﬂat dimension
A left R module B, where R
is a ring with unit, has ﬂat dimension n if there
is a ﬂat resolution
0 −→En −→· · · −→E0 −→B −→0 ,
but no shorter ﬂat resolution of B. The deﬁni-
tion of the ﬂat dimension of a right R module
is entirely similar. See ﬂat resolution. Flat di-
mensions have little relation to more elementary
notions of dimension, such as the dimension of
a vector space, but they are related to the idea of
injective dimension. See also injective dimen-
sion, projective dimension.
ﬂat module
Let R be a ring and M a right
R-module. If for any exact sequence
0 →N′ →N →N′′ →0 ,
the induced sequence
0 →M ⊗R N′ →M ⊗R N →M ⊗R N′′ →0
is exact, then R is a ﬂat R-module.
Here M ⊗R N is a tensor product of a right
R-module M and a left R-module N.
Remark: In view of the isomorphism between
M ⊗R N and N ⊗R M, we could drop the qual-
iﬁers left and right.

ﬂat morphism of schemes
A morphism of
schemes f : X →Y such that, for each point
x ∈X, a stalk OX,x at that point is a ﬂat OY,f (x)-
module. If f is surjective, f is faithfully ﬂat.

a companion notion for right R modules. Flat
resolutions are important in homological alge-
bra and enter into the dimension theory of rings
and modules. See also ﬂat dimension, ﬂat mod-
ule, injective resolution, projective resolution.
An exact sequence is a sequence of left R
modules, such as the one above, where every φi
is a left R module homomorphism (the φi are
called connecting homomorphisms), such that
Im(φi+1) = Ker(φi). Here Im(φi+1) is the im-
age of φi+1, and Ker(φi) is the kernel of φi. In
the particular case above, because the sequence
ends with 0, it is understood that the image of
φ0 is B, that is φ0 is onto. There is a companion
notion for right R modules.

Here V (I) is a set of primitive ideals of R con-
taining I, D(f ) = Spec(R) −V (f ), f ∈R
are elementary open sets forming a base of the
Zariski topology, and >(Q, O) designates the
set of sections over Q of a sheaf space O over
X. A section of O over Q is a continuous map
σ : A ⊂X →O such that π ◦σ = 1A, where
π : O →X is such that π(Ox) = x, Ox being

(1) (Of an algebraic num-

the principle order of k (i.e., an integral domain

order p). Then a fractional ideal of k is a p-

two words α and β, we attach β to the end of
α; to obtain the inverse of α reverse the order of

free module
For a ring R, an R-module that
has a basis.
Remarks: (i.)
If R is a ﬁeld, then every R-
module is free (i.e., a linear space over R).
(ii.) A ﬁnitely generated module V is free if
there is an isomorphism φ : Rn →V , where R
is a commutator ring with unity.
(iii.) A free Z-module is also called a free
Abelian ring.

free product
Consider a family of groups
{Gi}i∈C and their disjoint union as sets S. A
word is either empty (or void) or a ﬁnite se-
quence a1a2 . . . an, of the elements of S. Des-
ignate by W the set of all words and deﬁne the
following binary relations on W:
(i.) The product of two words w and w′ is
obtained by juxtaposition of w and w′.
(ii.) w ≻w′ if either w contains successive
elements akak+1 belonging to the same Gi and
w′ results from w by replacing akak+1 by their
product a = akak+1, or if w contains an identity
element and w′ results by deleting it.
(iii.) w ∼w′ if there exists a ﬁnite sequence
of words w = w0, w1, . . . , wn = w′ such that
for each j (j = 0, . . . , n−1) either wj ≻wj+1
or wj+1 ≻wj.
Clearly, the deﬁnition of the product imme-
diately implies the associativity and “∼” rep-
resents an equivalence relation that is compati-
ble with multiplication. We can thus deﬁne the
product for the quotient set G of W by the equiv-
alence relation ∼, and take as the identity the
equivalence class containing the empty word.
The resulting group G is called the free product
of the system of groups {Gi}i∈C.
Remarks: (i.) The free product is the dual con-
cept to that of the direct product (and is called
the coproduct in the theory of categories and
functors).
(ii.) If each Gi is an inﬁnite cyclic group
generated by ai, then the free product of {Gi}i∈C
is the free group generated by {ai}i∈C.
free resolution
(Of Z) A certain cohomo-
logical functor, deﬁned by Artin and Tate, that
can be described as a set of cohomology groups
concerning a certain complex in a non-Abelian
theory of homological algebras.
free semigroup
All words (i.e., ﬁnite strings
of symbols from a set of symbols S
=
{a1, a2, . . . }) with the product deﬁned by jux-
taposition of words [and the identity being the
empty (void) word when a semigroup with iden-
tity is considered]. See also free group.
free special Jordan algebra
Let A = k[x1,
. . . , xn] be a noncommutative free ring in the in-
determinates x1, . . . xn (i.e., the associative al-
gebra over k). Deﬁning a new product by
x ∗y = (xy + yx)/2 ,
weobtainaJordanalgebraA(J). Thesubalgebra
of A(J) generated by 1 and the xi is called the
free special Jordan algebra (of n generators).
Remark: A special Jordan algebra A(J) arises
from an associative algebra A by deﬁning a new
product x ∗y, as above.
Frobenius algebra
An algebra A over a ﬁeld
k such that its regular and coregular representa-
tions are similar.
Remarks: (i.)
Any ﬁnite dimensional semi-
simple algebra is a Frobenius algebra.
(ii.) An algebra A is a Frobenius algebra,
if the left A-module A and a dual module A∗
of the right A-module A are isomorphic as left
A-modules.
Frobenius automorphism
An element of a
Galois group of a special kind that plays an im-
portant role in algebraic number ﬁeld theory.
Designate by K/F a relative algebraic num-
ber ﬁeld, with K a Galois extension of F of
degree [K : F] = n, G = G(K/F) the cor-
responding Galois group, and F the principal
order of K. In Hilbert’s decomposition theory
of prime ideals of F, for a Galois extension K/F
in terms of the Galois group G, the subgroup
H =

σ ∈G : Pσ = P

,
called the decomposition group of a prime ideal
P of F over F, plays an important role. The nor-
mal subgroup H of H, called the inertia group
of P over F, is deﬁned by
H =

σ ∈H : aσ ≡a(modP), a ∈F

.
The quotient group H/H is a cyclic group
of order k, where k is the relative degree of P.
This cyclic group is generated by an element
σo ∈H that is uniquely determined (modH) by
the requirement
aσo ≡aN(π)(modP),
a ∈F
where π is a prime ideal of F that is being de-
composed. This element σo is referred to as the
Frobenius automorphism or the Frobenius sub-
stitution of P over F.

Frobenius endomorphism
For a commuta-

p, the ring homomorphisn F : R →R, deﬁned
by
F(a) = ap,

Clearly, for any a, b ∈R, we have that
(a + b)p = ap + bp and (a · b)p = ap · bp .

distinct elements), referred to as Galois ﬁeld Fq
of order q, the Frobenius endomorphism

(See also Frobenius automorphism.) In fact, F
generates the cyclic Galois group G(Fq/Fp).
Generally, for a scheme X over a ﬁnite ﬁeld
Fq of q(= pn) elements, the Frobenius endo-
morphism is an endomorphism ψ : X →X
such that ψ = Id (the identity mapping) on the

Frobenius group
A (nonregular) transitive
permutation group on a set M, each element of
which has at most one ﬁxed point, i.e., the iden-
tity of the group is its only element that leaves
more than one element of M invariant. See reg-

Frobenius homomorphism
(For commuta-
tive rings.)
Let A be a commutative ring of
prime characteristic p, so that (a + b)pn =
apn + bpn for any a, b ∈A and any n ∈N.
Thus, the map φ : a (→ap is an endomorphism
of the additive group of A. Since further 1p = 1
and (ab)p = apbp for a, b ∈A, this is also an
endomorphism of A, which is referred to as the
Frobenius homomorphism of A. It is injective
when 0 is the only nilpotent element of A, which
is the case when A is an integral domain. See
also Frobenius endomorphism for schemes.

Frobenius normal form
An n × n matrix
A = (aij) that is block (upper) triangular, with
the diagonal blocks being square irreducible ma-
trices that correspond to the strongly connected
components of G(A).
Here, G(A) is the di-
rected graph (digraph), G(A) = (V, E), con-
sisting of vertices V = {1, 2, . . . , n} and di-
rected edges E = {(i, j)
: aij ̸= 0}.
The
set V admits a partition into disjoint subsets of
vertices so that in each such subset the vertices
have access to each other via a directed path (se-
quence of edges). The subsets of this partition
are called the strongly connected components of
G(A).
If there is only one strongly connected com-
ponent, we call A irreducible.
Otherwise, A
is reducible. If A is reducible, there exists a
permutation matrix P such that PAP T , is in
Frobenius normal form. For instance, if G(A)
has t strongly connected components, then its
Frobenius normal form is

where each Aii for i = 1, 2, . . . , t is square
and irreducible. The Frobenius normal form is
not, in general, unique. As for any permutation
matrix P, P −1 = P T , spectral properties of A
can be studied by studying spectral properties
of the irreducible blocks Aii in its Frobenius
normal form.
Frobenius Reciprocity Theorem
Let G and
H be ﬁnite groups, > and γ some irreducible
representations of G and H, respectively, and
H a subgroup of G, H ⊂G. Designate by (γ ↑
G) the representation of G induced by γ and
by (> ↓H) the representation of H subduced
(restricted) from >. Then the multiplicity of >
in (γ↑G) equals the multiplicity of γ in (>↓H).
Equivalently,
⟨χ(>), χ(γ ↑G)⟩G = ⟨χ(>↓H), χ(γ )⟩H ,

Frobenius Theorem
There are a number of
theoremsassociatedwiththenameofFrobenius.
(See also Frobenius Theorem on Non-Negative
Matrices, Frobenius Reciprocity Theorem.)
(1) (Frobenius Theorem on Division Alge-
bras.) The ﬁelds R (the ﬁeld of real numbers)
and C (the ﬁeld of complex numbers) are the
onlyﬁnitedimensionalrealassociativeandcom-
mutative algebras without zero divisors (i.e., di-
vision algebras), while H (the skew-ﬁeld of
quaternions or Hamilton’s quaternion algebra)
is the only ﬁnite dimensional real associative,
but noncommutative, division algebra.
For nonassociative algebras, the only alterna-
tive algebra without zero divisors is the Cayley
algebra. SeeCayleyalgebra, alternativealgebra.
(2) (Frobenius Theorem for Finite Groups.)
For a ﬁnite group G of order |G| = g, the num-
ber of solutions of the equation xn = c, where
c belongs to a class C having h conjugated ele-
ments, is given by g.c.d. (hn, g).
The original, simpler version of this theorem
states that the number m of solutions of xn = 1,
where n|g, is divisible by n, i.e., n|m.
(3) (Frobenius Theorem for Transitive Per-
mutation Groups.) For a transitive permutation
group G of degree n, whose elements, other than
the identity, leave at most one of the permuted
symbols invariant, the elements of G displacing
all the symbols form, together with the identity,
a normal subgroup of order n.
(4) (Also called Zolotarev-Frobenius Theo-
rem.) Let a be an arbitrary integer and b any odd
integer such that a and b are relatively prime,
i.e., g.c.d.(a, b) = 1.
Further, let πa desig-
nate multiplication by a in the additive group
H := Z/bZ. Then πa (regarded as an automor-
phism of H) represents a permutation of the set
H and as such possesses the parity (or sign) δ
given by
δ (πa) =
a
b

,
where
 a
b

is the Jacobi (generalized Legendre)
symbol.
(5) (Frobenius Theorem in Finite Group The-
ory.) Let H be a selfnormalizing subgroup of a
ﬁnite group G, NG(H) = H, and
H ∩x−1Hx = {e} ,
for all x ∈G. Then the elements of G that do
not lie in H, together with the identity element
e, form a normal subgroup N of G,
N = (G\H) ∪{e} ,
such that G = NH, H ∩N = {e} and G/N ∼=
H. See also Frobenius group.
(6)(FrobeniusTheoremonAbelianVarieties.)
Let G be an additive group of divisors on an
Abelian variety A, X a divisor on A, and ˆA the
Picard variety of A. Denote by φX a rational
homomorphism of A into ˆA that maps a ∈A
into the linear equivalence class of the divisor
Xa −X, where Xa is the image of X under the
translation A →A deﬁned by b (→a+b. There
are elements a1, . . . , an such that the product
(intersection) Xa1 • · · · • Xan, n = dim A is de-
ﬁned. Designating the degree of the zero cycle
Xa1 • · · · • Xan by (X(n)), the degree of φx is
given by (X(n))/n!
(7) (Frobenius Theorem on Subduced Repre-
sentations.) Let G be a (ﬁnite) group having
r classes Cℓ, (ℓ= 1, . . . , r) with rℓelements
each, |Cℓ| = rℓ. Further, let {>i} be the set of
irreducible representations (irreps) of G, and χi
the character of >i. Similarly, let H be a sub-
group of G having s classes Dk with sk elements
each, and having the irreps {Jj} and characters

Frobenius Theorem on Non-Negative Matri-
ces
(Also called Peron-Frobenius Theorem.)
Let A be an indecomposable (or irreducible),
non-negative n×n matrix over R, A ≡∥aij∥n×n
(i.e., all entries aij of A are non-negative and
there are no invariant coordinate subspaces
when we regard A as an operator on Rn; in other

and
ρB := max

with µ0, µ1, . . . , µn−1 the eigenvalues of B, we
have that
ρB ≤ρ .
(ii.) A always has a positive eigenvalue ρ that
is a simple root of the characteristic polynomial
of A and ρ majorizes the moduli of all other
eigenvalues as the above introduced notation (i)
implies. The coordinates ci (1 ≤i ≤n) of
an eigenvector c, c = (c1, c2, . . . , cn)T that is
associated with this “maximal” eigenvalue ρ are
either all positive (ci > 0) or all negative (ci <
0).
(iii.) If A has h characteristic values λ0 =
ρ, λ1, . . . , λh−1 of modulus r, as in (i), then
these eigenvalues are all distinct and are given
by the roots of the equation λh −ρh = 0, i.e.,
λj = ωiρ,
(j = 0, 1, . . . , h −1)
where ω is the hth root of unity, ω = e2πi/h.
Moreover, any eigenvalue of A, multiplied by
ω, is again an eigenvalue of A. Thus, the entire
spectrum {λi, 0 ≤i < n} of A is invariant with
respect to a rotation by 2π/h when represented
by points in the complex plane.

Fuchsian group
A special case of a Kleinian
group, i.e., a ﬁnitely generated discontinuous
group of linear fractional transformations acting
on some domain in the complex plane.
(See
Kleinian group, linear fractional function.)
Generally, a Fuchsian group is a discrete (or
discontinuous) transformation group of an open
disc X in C onto the Riemann sphere. More
speciﬁcally, one considers transformations of
the upper half-plane Xu = {z ∈C : ℑz > 0} or
of the unit disc Xd = {z ∈C : |z| < 1} onto the
complex plane. In the former case (X = Xu),
the elements of a Fuchsian group are Möbius
(linearfractional)transformations(orconformal
mappings)
z (→az + b
cz + d , a, b, c, d ∈R, ad −bc = 1 ,
so that the relevant group is a subgroup of
PSL(2). In the latter case (X = Xd), the group
elements are Möbius transformations with
pseudo-unitary matrices.
When one considers the disc X as a con-
formal model of the Lobachevski plane, then
a Fuchsian group can be regarded as a discrete
group of motions in this plane that preserve the
orientation. A Fuchsian group is referred to as
elementary if it preserves a straight line in the
Lobachevski plane (or, equivalently, some point
in the closure X of X). For a nonelementary
Fuchsian group >, one then deﬁnes the limit set
of >, designated as L(>), as the set of limit
points of the orbit of a point x ∈X located on
the circle ∂X and independent of x. We then
distinguish Fuchsian groups of the ﬁrst and sec-
ond kind: for the former kind, we require that

plex plane) and any sequence {γi} of distinct
elements of >, we deﬁne a limit point of > as a
cluster point of {γiz}. If there are at most two
limit points, > is conjugate to a group of mo-
tions of a plane. Otherwise, the set L of all limit
points of > is inﬁnite, and > is called a Fuchsoid
group. Such a group is Fuchsian if it is ﬁnitely
generated.
Fuchsoid group
See Fuchsian group. Also

function
One of the most fundamental con-
cepts in mathematics.
Also referred to as a
mapping, correspondence, transformation, or
morphism, particularly when dealing with ab-
stract objects. This concept gradually crystal-
ized from its early implicit use into the present
day abstract form. The term “function” was ﬁrst
used by Leibniz, and it gradually developed into
a general concept through the work of Bernoulli,
Euler, Dirichlet, Bolzano, Cauchy, and others.
The modern-day deﬁnition as a correspondence
between two abstract sets is due to Dedekind.
Generally, a function f is a relation between
two sets, say X and Y, that associates a unique
element f (x) ∈Y to an element x ∈X. (See
relation.) The sets X and Y need not be distinct.
Formally, this many-to-one relation is a set of or-
dered pairs f = {(x, y)}, x ∈X, y ∈Y, that is,
a subset of the Cartesian product X×Y, with the
property that for any (x′, y′) and (x′′, y′′) from
f , the inequality y′ ̸= y′′ implies that x′ ̸= x′′.
The ﬁrst element x ∈X of each pair (x, y) ∈f
is called the argument or the independent vari-
able of f and the second element y ∈Y is re-
ferred to as the abscissa, dependent variable or
the value of f for the argument x.
The sets Xf and Yf of the ﬁrst and second
elements of ordered pairs (x, y) ∈f are called
the domain (or the set) of deﬁnition of f and the
range (or the set) of values of f , respectively,
whiletheentiresetX issimplycalledthedomain
and Y the codomain of f . For any subset A ⊂
X, the set of values of f , {y = f (x) ∈Y :
x ∈A} is called the image of A under f and is
designated by f (A). In particular, the image of
the domain of f is f (Xf ), i.e., Yf = f (Xf ) or
Yf = f (X), and the image of the element x ∈
Xf under f is y = f (x). Often one simply sets
X = Xf . The set of ordered pairs f = {(x, y)},
regarded as a subset of X × Y, is referred to as
the graph of f . (See graph.)
The mapping property of a function f is usu-
ally expressed by writing f : X →Y, and
for (x, y) ∈f one often writes y = f (x) or
f : x (→y, or even y = f x or y = xf . In lieu
of the symbol f (x0) one also writes f (x)|x=x0,
and often the function itself is denoted by the
symbol f (x) rather than f : x (→y, since this
notation is more convenient for actual computa-
tions.
The set of elements of X that are mapped into
a given y0 ∈Y is called the pre-image of y0 and
is designated by f −1(y0), so that
f −1 (y0) = {x ∈X : f (x) = y0} .
For y0 ∈Y\Yf we have clearly f −1(y0) = ∅
(the empty set).
The notation f : X →Y indicates that the
set X is mapped into the set Y. When X = Y, we
say that X is mapped into itself. When Y = Yf ,
we say that f maps X onto Y or that f is sur-
jective (or a surjection). Thus, f : X →Y is a
surjection (or onto) if for each y ∈Y there ex-
ists at least one x ∈X such that f : x (→y. If
the images of distinct elements of X are distinct,
i.e., if x′ ̸= x′′ implies that f (x′) ̸= f (x′′) for
any x′, x′′ ∈X, we say that f is one-to-one, or
univalent, or injective (or an injection). Thus, f
is injective if the preimage of any y ∈Yf con-
tains precisely one element from X, i.e., card
f −1(y) = 1, y ∈Yf . The mapping f : X →Y
that is simultaneously injective and surjective
(or one-to-one and onto) is referred to as bi-
jective (or a bijection).
For a bijective func-
tion one deﬁnes the inverse function by f −1 =
{(y, f −1(y)), y ∈Yf . See inverse function.
For two functions f : X →Y and g : Y →
Z, with Yf ⊂Yg, the function h : X →Z that
is deﬁned as
h(x) = g(f (x)),
for all x ∈Xf ,
is called the composite function of f and g (also
the superposition or composition of f and g),
and is designated by h = g ◦f .
function algebra
For a compact Hausdorff
space X, let C(X) [or CR(X)] be the algebra
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

of all complex- [or real-] valued functions on X.
Then a closed subalgebra A of C(X) [or CR(X)]
is referred to as a function algebra on X if it
contains the constant functions and separates the
points of X [i.e., for any x, y ∈X, x ̸= y, there
exists an f ∈A such that f (x) ̸= f (y)]. A
typical example is the disk algebra, that is, the
complex-valued functions, analytic in the unit
disk D = {|z| < 1}, which extend continuously
to the closure of D, with the supremum norm.
Alternatively, a function algebra is a semi-
simple, commutative Banach algebra, realized
as an algebra of continuous functions on the
space of its maximal ideals (recall that a com-
mutative Banach algebra is semi-simple if its
radical reduces to {0}, the radical being the set
of generalized nilpotent elements).
function ﬁeld
A type of extension of the ﬁeld
of rational functions C(x) that plays an impor-
tant role in algebraic geometry and the theory of
analytic functions.
For an (irreducible) afﬁne variety V (P),
where P is a prime ideal in C[x] ≡C[x1, . . . ,
xn], the function ﬁeld of V (P) is the ﬁeld of
quotients of the afﬁne coordinate ring C[x]/P.
Similarly, for a projective variety V (P), where
P is a homogeneous prime ideal in a projective
n-spacePn, thefunctionﬁeldofV (P)isthesub-
ﬁeld of the quotient ﬁeld of the homogeneous
coordinate ring C[x]/P of zero degree [i.e., the
ringofrationalfunctionsf (x0, x1, . . . xn)/g(x0,
x1, . . . , xn) (f, g being homogeneous polyno-
mials of the same degree and g /∈P) modulo
the ideal of functions (f/g), with f ∈P]. See

ﬁeld, rational function ﬁeld.
function group
A Kleinian group > whose
region of discontinuity has a nonempty, con-
nected component, invariant under >.
functor
A mapping from one category into
another that is compatible with their structure.
Speciﬁcally, a covariant functor (or simply a
functor) F : C →D, from a category C into a
category D, represents a pair of mappings (usu-
ally designated by the same letter, i.e., F).
F : Ob C →ObD,
F : Mor C →MorD ,
associating with each object X of C, X ∈Ob C
an object F(X) of D, F(X) ∈ObD, and with
each morphism α : X →Y in C, α ∈Mor C, a
morphismF(α) : F(X) →F(Y)inD, F(α) ∈
MorD, in such a way that the following hold:
(i.) F(1X) = 1F(X), for all X ∈Ob C and
(ii.) F(α ◦β) = F(α) ◦F(β) for all mor-
phismsα ∈HomC(X, Y)andβ ∈HomC(Y, Z).
Note that a functor F : C →D deﬁnes a
mapping of each set of morphisms HomC(X, Y)
into HomD(F(X), F(Y)), associating the mor-
phism F(α) : F(X) →F(Y) to each morphism
α : X →Y. It is called faithful if all these maps
are injective, and full if they are surjective. The
identity functor IdC or 1C of a category C is the
identity mapping of C into itself.
A contravariant functor F : C →D asso-
ciates with a morphism α : X →Y in C a mor-
phism F(α) : F(Y) →F(X) in D (or, equiva-
lently, acts as a covariant functor from the dual
category C∗to D), with the second condition
(ii.) replaced by (ii.′) F(α ◦β) = F(β) ◦F(α)
for all morphisms α
∈HomC(X, Y), β
∈
HomC(Y, Z).
A generalization involving a ﬁnite number
of categories is an n-place functor from n cate-
gories C1, . . . Cn into D that is covariant for the
indices i1, i2, . . . , ik and contravariant in the re-
maining ones. This is a functor from the Carte-
sian product ⊗n
i=1 ˜Ci into D where ˜Ci = Ci for
i = i1, . . . , ik and ˜Ci = C∗
i otherwise. A two-
place functor that is covariant in both arguments
is called a bifunctor.
fundamental curve
A concept in the theory
of birational mappings (or correspondences) of
algebraic varieties. See birational mapping.
Consider complete, irreducible varieties V
and W and a birational mapping F between
them, F : V →W. A subvariety V ′ of V is
called fundamental if dim F[V ′] > dim V ′.
When V ′ is a point, it is called a fundamental
point with respect to F and, likewise, when V ′ is
a curve, it is referred to as a fundamental curve
with respect to F.

tional mapping between projective planes.

A concept in
the theory of homological algebras.
Let H i(G, A) be the ith cohomology group
of G with coefﬁcients in A, where A is a left G-
module (that can be identiﬁed with a left Z[G]-
module). (See cohomology group.) Designate,
further, the submodule of G-invariant elements
inAbyAG andassumethatH i(H, A) = 0, i =
1, . . . , n, for some normal subgroup H of G.
Then the sequence

H, AG

(composed of inﬂation, restriction, and trans-
gression mappings) is exact and is referred to as
the fundamental exact sequence.
fundamental operations of arithmetic
The
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplica-
tion, and division. See operation. Often, extrac-
tion of square roots is added to this list.
Starting with the set N of natural numbers,
which is closed with respect to the ﬁrst three
fundamental operations, one carries out an ex-
tension to the ﬁeld of rational numbers Q rep-
resenting the smallest domain in which the four
fundamental operations can be carried out in-
discriminately, excepting division by zero. Ad-
joining the operation of square root extractions,
we arrive at the ﬁeld of complex numbers C.
These operations can be deﬁned for various
algebraic systems, in which case the commuta-
tive and associative laws may not hold.

fundamental root system
(of a (complex)
semi-simple Lie algebra g) A similar concept
arises in Kac-Moody algebras, in algebraic
groups, algebraicgeometry, andotherﬁelds. Let
T be a subset of the root system J of a semi-
simple Lie algebra g, relative to a chosen Cartan
subalgebra h, T = {α1, α2, . . . , αr}. Then T
is called a fundamental root system of J if

miαi,
mi ∈Z ,
and
(ii.) the mi are either all non-negative (when
α ∈J+ is a positive root) or all non-positive.
The roots belonging to T are usually referred
to as simple roots. They can be deﬁned as pos-
itive roots that are not expressible as a sum of
two positive roots. They are linearly indepen-
dent and constitute a basis of the Euclidean vec-
tor space spanned by J whose (real) dimension
equals the rank of g.

of V by d, d = dim V , we can distinguish the
following cases:
(i.) d = 0: In this case the system (1) has
only the trivial solution x = 0.
(ii.) d > 0: Choosing a basis {x1, . . . , xd}
for V , we see that any solution of (1) is a (right)
linear combination of the xk, (k = 1, . . . , d).
One then says that x1, . . . , xd form a fundamen-
tal system of solutions of (1). Clearly, a nontriv-

Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory
Let K be a Galois extension of a ﬁeld M with a
Galois group G = G(K/M). Then there exists
a bijection H ↔L between the set of subgroups
{H} of G and the set of intermediate ﬁelds {L},
K ⊃L ⊃M. For a given H, the corresponding
subﬁeld L = L(H) is given by a ﬁxed ﬁeld
KH of H (consisting of all the elements of K
that are ﬁxed by all the automorphisms of H).
Conversely, to a given L corresponds a subgroup
H = H(L) of G that leaves each element of
L ﬁxed, i.e., H(L) = G(K/L), so that [K :
L] = |H|. This bijection has the property that
[L : M] = [G : H], where [L : M] is the
degree of the extension L/M and [G : H] is the
index of H in G.

Fundamental trigonometric identities
Re-
call that in a plane R2 with a Cartesian coordi-
nate system O −xy (i.e., with the origin O ≡
(0, 0) and the x- and y- axes representing the
abscissa and the ordinate), any point P ∈R2 is
uniquely represented by its coordinates (x, y).
Designating the radial distance OP by r, r =

x2 + y2, and the angle POx (i.e., angle be-
tween the line PO and the x-axis) by α, we
deﬁne six ratios as follows:
sin α

sec α =

cos α ,
csc α =

sin α ,
1 + tan2 α = sec2 α,
1 + cot2 α = csc2α.
Furthermore, we have that
sin2 α + cos2 α = 1 ,
implying that the points P = (x, y) lying on
the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1 with its center at the
origin (0, 0) can be expressed in terms of the
angle α as P = (cos α, sin α).
The important addition formulas read
sin(α ± β) = sin α cos β ± cos α sin β,
cos(α ± β) = cos α cos β ∓sin α sin β,
tan(α ± β) = (tan α ± tan β)/(1 ∓tan α tan β).
When α = β we have

r1 and r2 designate, respectively, the number of

G
Galois cohomology
Let K/k be a ﬁnite Ga-
lois extension with the Galois group G(K/k).
Suppose, further, that G(K/k) acts on some
Abelian group A.
The Galois cohomology
groups H n(G(K/k), A) ≡H n(K/k, A), n ≥
0 are then the cohomology groups deﬁned by the
(cochain) complex (F n, d), with F n consisting
of all mappings G(K/k)n →A and d designat-
ing the coboundary operator (see cohomology
groups). When the extension K/k is of an in-
ﬁnite degree, one also requires that the Galois
topological group acts continuously on the dis-
crete group A and the mappings for the cochains
in F n are also continuous.
One also deﬁnes Galois cohomology for a
non-Abelian group A, in which case one usually
restricts oneself to zero- and one-dimensional
cohomology groups, H 0 and H 1, respectively.
In the ﬁrst case, H 0(K/k, A) = AG(K/k) repre-
sents a set of ﬁxed points in A under the action
of the Galois group G(K/k), while in the sec-
ond case H 1(K/k, A) is the quotient set of the
set of 1-dimensional cocycles.
The concept of Galois cohomology enables
one to deﬁne the cohomological dimension of
the Galois group Gk of a ﬁeld k.
See coho-
mological dimension. Non-Abelian Galois co-
homology enables the classiﬁcation of principal
homogeneous spaces of group schemes and, in
particular, to classify types of algebraic varieties
(using Galois cohomology groups of algebraic
groups).
Also called cohomology of a Galois group.
See also Tamagawa number, Tate-Shafarevich
group.
Galois equation
Let K/k be a ﬁnite Galois
extension with the Galois group G(K/k). Then
K is a minimal splitting ﬁeld of a separable poly-
nomial f (X) ∈k[X], and we call G(K/k) the
Galois group of f (X) or the Galois group of
the algebraic equation f (X) = 0. (See min-
imal splitting ﬁeld, separable polynomial.) If
G(K/k) is Abelian or cyclic, we call the equa-
tion f (X) = 0 an Abelian equation or a cyclic
equation, respectively. (See Abelian equation.)
When the extension ﬁeld K can be obtained by
adjoining a root α of f (X) to k, K = k[α],
then the equation f (X) = 0 is called a Galois
equation.

is equal to the degree [K : k] = dimk K of the
ﬁeld extension K, i.e.,
|G(K/k)| = [K : k] = dimk K .
Remarks:
(i.) The degree [K : k] of the ﬁeld exten-
sion K/k, k ⊂K, equals the dimension of K
as a k-vector space, [K : k] = dimk K. One
distinguishes quadratic ([K : k) = 2), cubic
([K : k] = 3), biquadratic (K : k] = 4), ﬁnite
([K : k] < ∞), etc., extensions.
(ii.) All quadratic and biquadratic extensions
are Galois extensions.
(iii.) For any ﬁnite ﬁeld extension K/k, the
order of the Galois group g ≡|G(K/k)| divides
the degree of the extension [K : k], i.e., g|[K :
k].
(iv.) For a Galois extension K/k with the Ga-
lois group G(K/k), the ﬁxed ﬁeld KG is given
by k, i.e., KG = k. See also Galois theory.
Galois ﬁeld
Finite ﬁelds Fq, q = pn, are
also called Galois ﬁelds. See ﬁnite ﬁeld.
Galois group
For an extension K of a ﬁeld k,
the group of all k-automorphisms of K is called
the Galois group of the ﬁeld extension K/k and
is denoted by G(K/k).
Remarks:
(i.) A k-automorphism of an extension ﬁeld
K is an automorphism that acts as the identity
on the subﬁeld k. It is also referred to as an
automorphism of a ﬁeld extension K.
(ii.) Since every Galois extension is a split-
ting ﬁeld of some polynomial f (x) ∈k[x],
and any two splitting ﬁelds K of a polynomial
f (x) ∈k[x] are isomorphic, the Galois group
G(K/k)dependsonlyonf (uptoisomorphism).
See Galois extension. Thus, if K is the splitting
ﬁeld of f (x) ∈k[x], the Galois group G(K/k)
is also referred to as the Galois group of the

Galois theory
In a broad sense, a theory
studying various mathematical objects on the
basis of their automorphism groups (e.g., Galois
theories of rings, topological spaces, etc.). In a
narrower sense, it is the Galois theory of ﬁelds
that originated in the problem of ﬁnding of roots
of algebraic equations of higher degrees (e.g.,
quintic and higher). This problem was solved
by Galois in his famous letter that he wrote on
the eve of his execution (1832) and laid unread
for more than a decade. In today’s language,
this theory may be summarized as follows.
Consider an arbitrary ﬁeld k. An extension
(ﬁeld) K of k is any ﬁeld containing k as a sub-
ﬁeld, k ⊂K, and may be regarded as a lin-
ear space over k (ﬁnite or inﬁnite dimensional;
dimk K ≡[K : k] is called the degree of the ex-
tension K/k). One says that α ∈K is algebraic
over k if it is a root of a non-zero (irreducible)
polynomial p(x) ∈k[x] from a polynomial ring
k[x] (i.e., with coefﬁcients from k). The small-
est extension of k containing α is usually de-
noted by k(α), and the smallest extension of k
that contains all the roots of an irreducible poly-
nomial p(x) ∈k[x] is called the splitting ﬁeld
of p(x). The degree of such an extension is di-
visible by the degree of p(x) and is equal to this
degree if all the roots of p(x) can be expressed
as polynomials in one of these roots. A ﬁnite ex-
tension K/k is separable if K = k(α) and the
irreducible polynomial p(x) with α as a root has
no multiple roots, and normal if it is the split-
ting ﬁeld of some polynomial in k[x]. When
the extension is both separable and normal it is
called a Galois extension. See Galois extension.
If char k = 0 (e.g., k is a number ﬁeld), any
ﬁnite extension is separable.
The group of all automorphisms of a Galois
extension K, leaving all elements of k invari-
ant, is the Galois group G(K/k). The relation-
ship between its subgroups H, H ⊂G, and the
corresponding intermediate extension ﬁelds L,
k ⊂L ⊂K, is described by the Fundamental
(or Main) Theorem of Galois theory. See Funda-
mental Theorem of Galois Theory. In this way,
the difﬁcult problem of ﬁnding all subﬁelds of K
is reduced to a much simpler problem of deter-
mining the subgroups of G(K/k). Moreover, if
H is normal, L is a Galois extension. These re-
sults are then exploited in studying the solutions
of algebraic equations. If K is the splitting ﬁeld
of an irreducible polynomial p(x) ∈k[x] with-
out multiple roots, the Galois group G(K/k) is
referred to as the Galois group of the equation
(or polynomial) p(x) = 0. This group can be
computed without actually solving the equation
and can be regarded as a subgroup of the group
of permutations of the roots of p(x). In the gen-
eral case, it is simply the permutation group of
all the roots, i.e., the symmetric group of de-
gree n = deg[p(x)]. Since such a group is not
solvable for n ≥5, there are no solutions in rad-
icals for the quintic and higher degree algebraic
equations. This theory can also be employed to
decide which problems of geometry are solvable
by ruler and compass (by reducing them to an
equivalent problem of solving some algebraic
equation over the ﬁeld of rational numbers in
terms of quadratic radicals).
Galois theory had an enormous impact on the
development of algebra during the nineteenth
century. It was extended and generalized in var-
ious directions (Galois topological groups, class
ﬁeld theory, inverse problem of Galois theory,
etc.), even though many important problems of
the classical Galois theory remain unsolved.
Galois theory of differential ﬁelds
Let K be
a differential ﬁeld and N a ﬁeld extension. The
corresponding Galois group, G(N/K), is the set
of all differential isomorphisms of N over K.
gap value
A concept from the theory of al-
gebraic functions.
Consider a closed Riemann surface R of
genus g. When R carries no meromorphic func-
tion whose only pole of multiplicity m is at a
point p ∈R, then m is called a gap value of
p ∈R.
The Riemann-Roch Theorem implies that if
g = 0, then no point has gap values, while if
g ≥1, then every p ∈R has exactly g gap
values. A point p ∈R is an ordinary point
if m at p equals 1, 2, . . . , g and a Weierstrass
point otherwise. See ordinary point, Weierstrass
point. See also Riemann-Roch Theorem.
gauge transformation
A concept which
arose in Maxwell’s formulation of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld theory and was later extended to
more general ﬁeld theories. In mathematics, it
is used to designate bundle automorphisms of a
c

principle ﬁber bundle over a (space-time) man-
ifold that is endowed with a group structure.
In general, gauge transformations (in both clas-
sical and quantum ﬁeld theories) change non-
observable ﬁeld properties (potentials) without
affecting the physically observable quantities
(observables).
In electromagnetic ﬁeld theory, the gauge
transformation (also called gradient transfor-
mation or gauge transformation of the second
kind) has the form
φ →φ′ = φ + ∂f
∂t ,
A →A′ = A −gradf ,
where φ and A designate, respectively, the scalar
and vector potentials of the ﬁeld and f is an ar-
bitrary (twice differentiable) scalar function of
space and time. Equivalently, using the formal-
ism of special relativity, the 4-component elec-
tromagneticvectorpotentialAj(x), j = 0, 1, 2,
3 and x = (x0, x1, x2, x3), transforms as fol-
lows:
Aj(x) →A′
j(x) = Aj(x) + ∂f
∂xj .
This transformation does not change the ﬁelds
involved implying the gauge invariance of the
underlying ﬁeld theory. It may be used to sim-
plify the relevant ﬁeld equations through a suit-
able choice of gauge, i.e., of a function f (x)
(Coulomb gauge, Lorentz gauge, etc.).
In Weyl’s uniﬁed ﬁeld theory (which origi-
nated from the theory of Cartan’s connections),
one employs a space (time) whose structure is
deﬁned by the fundamental tensor gij, the co-
variant derivative of which is deﬁned in terms
of the electromagnetic potential Ai as follows:
∇igjk = 2Aigjk .
This equation is invariant with respect to the
scale transformation gij →g′
ij = ρ2gij and
the gauge transformation
Ai →A′
i = Ai −∂log ρ
∂xi
.
For complex valued ﬁelds (required in quan-
tum ﬁeld theories), the theory must also be in-
variant with respect to gauge transformations (of
the ﬁrst kind) of the wave functions (x) in-
volved, which have the general form
(x) →′(x) = eig(x)(x) .
For example, for the complex valued ﬁelds (x)
interactingviatheelectromagnetﬁeldAi(x)that
is generated by the electric charges, the theory
(i.e., the ﬁeld equations and the Lagrangians)
should be invariant with respect to gauge trans-
formations of the type
(x) →′(x)
=
eif (x)(x) ,
∗(x) →′∗(x)
=
e−if (x)∗(x) ,
Aj(x) →A′
j(x)
=
Aj(x) + ∂f (x)
∂xj .
Such gauge transformations form an Abelian
group of transformations [with the binary op-
eration f (x) = g(x) + h(x) for two successive
gauge transformations g and h].
The concept of gauge transformations has
been generalized to various ﬁeld theories. In
mathematics, one employs this concept in ex-
ploring principle ﬁber bundles over a manifold
endowed with the group structure. A (gauge)
potential is then a connection on this bundle
and a gauge transformation is a bundle auto-
morphism that leaves the underlying manifold
pointwiseinvariant. Theseautomorphismsform
a group of gauge transformations.

sive elimination of unknowns when solving a
system of linear algebraic equations ("0),

j=1
aijxj −ai0 = 0,
i = 1, . . . , m,
("0)
where aij are elements of some ﬁeld F. As-
suming that a11 ̸= 0 (otherwise, renumber the
equations), the key algorithmic step can be de-
scribed as follows:
Multiply the ﬁrst equation by (a21/a11) and
subtract it (term by term) from the second equa-
tion. Next, multiply the ﬁrst equation by (a31/
a11) and subtract it from the third equation, etc.,
untiltheﬁrstequationismultipliedby(am1/a11)
and subtracted from the last (i = m) equation
of the system ("0).
Designate the resulting system of equations
with the ﬁrst equation deleted by ("1), and carry
out the same set of operations on ("1) obtain-
ing ("2), etc. Assuming that the rank of the
coefﬁcient matrix of ("0) [which is also called
the rank of the system of equations ("0)], r =
rank("0), is smaller than m, r < m, we obtain,
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

after the rth step, a system ("r) in which all the
coefﬁcients of the unknowns vanish. The sys-
tem ("0) [or ("r)] is called compatible, if in
("r) all the absolute terms vanish as well (i.e.,
when the rank of the coefﬁcient matrix equals
the rank of the augmented matrix); otherwise it
is incompatible and has no solution.
To obtain a solution of a compatible system,
we choose some solution (x(0)
r , · · · , x(0)
n ) of the
system ("r−1) and proceed by the back sub-
stitution to ("r−2), ("r−3), etc., until ("0) is
reached. See back substitution. In general, we

= cj−r for j = r + 1, . . . , n. The
(general) solution will then depend on r −n
arbitrary parameters cj ∈F, j = 1, . . . , n −r.
Once we have a solution of ("r−1), the back
substitution proceeds by assigning the values
x(0)
r , . . . , x(0)
n
to the unknowns xr, . . . , xn in
the ﬁrst equation of ("r−2), obtaining xr−1 =
x(0)
r−1, and thus a solution (x(0)
r−1, x(0)
r , . . . , x(0)
n )
of ("r−2). These values for xr−1, . . . , xn are
then substituted into the ﬁrst equation of ("r−3),
obtaining xr−2 = x(0)
r−2, etc., until a solution
(x(0)
1 , x(0)
2 , . . . , x(0)
n ) of ("0) is obtained. The
general solution results when the cj (j = 1, . . . ,
n −r) are regarded as free parameters.
This method can be generalized in various
ways. (See Gauss-Jordan elimination.) It can
also be formulated in terms of a general m × n
(or m×n+1) matrix A over F [representing the
coefﬁcient (or augmented) matrix of a system
("0)], in which case it is normally referred to as
the row reduction of A. The algorithm can then
be conveniently expressed through the so-called
elementary row operations, which in turn can be
represented by the elementary matrices of three
basic types [(I + aeij), i ̸= j, replacing the ith
rowXi byXi+aXj, I+eij+eji−eii−ejj, inter-
changing rows i and j, and I +(c−1)eii, c ̸= 0,
multiplying the ith row by c] acting from the left
on A. Clearly, the action of the elementary ma-
trices and of their inverses on the augmented
matrix A of a system ("0) produces an equiv-
alent system of linear algebraic equations, and
the process of Gauss elimination can thus be
represented by a product of corresponding ele-
mentary matrices.
In practical applications, when numerical ac-
curacy is at stake, one can also require that the
diagonal coefﬁcients (the so-called pivots) are
not only different from zero, but the largest ones
possible: in partial pivoting one chooses the ab-
solutely largest aii (from the ith column), and in
complete pivoting the absolutely largest element
of the entire coefﬁcient matrix (by appropriately
renumbering the unknowns).
Also called Gauss method, Gauss elimina-
tion method or Gauss algorithm for solving lin-
ear systems of algebraic equations. See also
forward elimination.
Gaussian integer
A complex number (a +
bi) with integer a and b. The Gaussian inte-
gers are thus the points of a square lattice in the
complex plane, forming the ring
Z[i] = {a + bi : a, b ∈Z} .
In fact, Z[i] is an integral domain (with four
units ±1, ±i) and, using the absolute value
squared as a size function, it is also a Euclidean
domain (and, hence, principal ideal domain and
thus a unique factorization domain). The prime
elements (called Gauss primes) are either ra-
tional primes that are congruent to 3 modulo 4
(i.e., 3, 7, 11, 19, etc.), or the complex numbers
(a + ib) whose norm squared N = a2 + b2 is
either a rational prime congruent to 1 modulo 4
or 2 (i.e., 1 + i, 1 + 2i, 3 + 4i, etc.).
(Also called Gauss integer or Gauss number.)
Gaussian ring

main. See unique factorization domain.
Gaussian sum

character modulo k. Then a trigonometric sum
of the form
G(a, χ) =

χ(n, k)e

k
is referred to as the Gauss(ian) sum modulo k. It
is thus fully deﬁned by specifying the character
χ(n, k) and the number a. Note that when a ≡
b(mod k), then G(a, χ) = G(b, χ).

The Gauss sum is exploited in number the-
ory where it enables one to establish a relation
between the multiplicative and additive charac-
ters.
Gauss-Jordan elimination
A variant of the
Gauss elimination method, in which one zeros
out the elements in the entire column, rather than
only below the diagonal. See Gaussian elimina-
tion.
The initial step is identical with that of Gauss
elimination, while in the subsequent steps one
subtractstheithequationmultipliedby(aji/aii)
from all the other equations. Consequently, the
upper left submatrix of the coefﬁcient matrix
after the ith iteration is diagonal or, by dividing
each equation by the diagonal coefﬁcient, it is a
unit matrix. In this way, one obtains the solution
of the system directly, without performing the
substitution.
The coding of this algorithm is
simpler than for Gauss elimination, although the
required computational effort is larger.
Also called sweeping-out method.
Gauss-Manin connection

entiate cohomology classes with respect to pa-
rameters. See cohomology class.

entials. Each derivative θ of K can be lifted in a
canonical way to a mapping ∇θ of H 1

∇θ(f ω) = f ∇θ(ω) + θ(f )ω ,
where f ∈K and ω ∈H 1

Gauss-Seidel method for solving linear equa-
tions
An iterative numerical method, also
called the single step method, for approximat-
ing the solution to a system of linear equations.
In more detail, suppose we wish to approximate
the solution to the equation Ax = b, where A
is an n × n square matrix, and x and b are n
dimensional column vectors. Write A = L +
D + U, where L is lower triangular, D is di-
agonal, and U is upper triangular. The matrix
L + D is easy to invert, so replace the exact
equation (L + D)x = −Ux + b by the relation
(L + D)xk = −Uxk−1 + b, and solve for xk in
terms of xk−1:
xk = −(L + D)−1Uxk−1 + (L + D)−1b .
This gives us the core of the Gauss-Seidel iter-
ation method. We choose a convenient starting
vector x0 and use the above formula to compute
successive approximations x1, x2, x3, . . . to the
actual solution x. Under suitable conditions, the
sequence of successive approximations does in-
deed converge to x. See also iteration matrix.
Gauss’s Theorem
(1) See Fundamental The-
orem of Algebra.
(2) Let R be a unique factorization domain.
Every polynomial from
R[X]
or R[X1, . . . ,
Xn] (which are also unique factorization do-
mains) can be uniquely expressed as a product
of certain primitive polynomials and an element
of R. See primitive polynomial. Then a product
of primitive polynomials is primitive.
A number of other theorems in analysis are
associated with Gauss’s name, e.g., the so-called
“Theorema Egregium” or Gauss curvature for
regular surfaces in E3, Mean Value Theorem for
Harmonic Functions, Gauss-Bonnet Theorem,
etc.
GCRalgebra
AgeneralizationofCCR[com-
pletely continuous (= compact) representation]
algebras that are also referred to as liminal or
liminary algebras. See CCR algebra.
A GCR algebra is a C∗-algebra having a
(possibly transﬁnite) composition series whose
factor algebras are CCR (i.e., if Iλ is a compo-
sition series of our C∗-algebra, then Iλ+1/Iλ is
CCR). See composition series. This is equiva-
lent to requiring that the trace quotients be con-
tinuous.
Equivalently, a C∗-algebra is GCR if the im-
age of every nontrivial representation contains
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

some nonzero compact operator. Thus, starting
withalargestCCRidealI0 ofagivenC∗-algebra
A that consists of all elements a ∈A whose im-
age π(a) is compact for all irreducible represen-
tations π, we construct the factor algebra A/I0.
Continuing this process, we eventually obtain
the largest GCR ideal of A. This will turn out to
be the C∗-algebra A itself if it is GCR. Clearly,
any CCR algebra is GCR while the converse is
false.
Also called postliminary algebra.
Gel’fand-Mazur Theorem
A complex Ba-
nach algebra is a ﬁeld if and only if it coincides
with the ﬁeld of complex numbers C.
See Banach algebra.
Gel’fand-Naimark Theorem
Any C∗-alge-
bra admits a faithful (i.e., injective) representa-
tion on some Hilbert space.
More precisely, any C∗-algebra A is isomet-
rically ∗-isomorphic to a C∗-subalgebra of some
algebra B(H) of bounded linear operators on a
Hilbert space H. Thus, a C∗-algebra is a Ba-
nach algebra of (bounded linear) operators on
a Hilbert space H (with the usual operations of
addition, multiplication by scalars, and product
of operators) which is closed under the taking
of adjoints.
Moreover, if A is separable, then H can be
assumed to be separable as well.
Gel’fand-Pyatetski-Shapiro Reciprocity Law
Let G be a connected semisimple Lie group, 3 a
discrete subgroup of G and T the regular repre-
sentation of G on 3\G [deﬁned by (Tgf )(x) =
f (xg), f ∈L2(3\G)]. Then the multiplicity
of a unitary, irreducible representation γ in the
regular representation T on 3\G equals the di-
mension of the vector space formed by all auto-
morphic forms of 3 of type γ . See automorphic
form.
Gel’fand representation
A correspondence
between the elements of a commutative Banach
algebra R and the continuous functions on the
space of regular maximal ideals M of R.
Recall that a maximal ideal M of R is called
regular if the quotient algebra R/M is a ﬁeld,
in which case R/M is isomorphic to C, the ﬁeld
of complex numbers. Thus, each coset x(M)
[i.e., the coset containing x ∈R] can be re-
garded as a complex number and the functional
ˆx : x →x(M) is multiplicative and linear,
i.e., xy(M) = x(M)y(M). Conversely, with
each multiplicative linear functional one can as-
sociate a regular maximal ideal. Designating by
X, the set of all multiplicative functionals on
R, endowed with Gel’fand topology, we obtain
the Gel’fand representation, associating with an
element of R a continuous function on X vanish-
ing at inﬁnity. See Gel’fand topology. In fact,
X is a locally compact Hausdorff space and,
when R has a unit element, a compact Haus-
dorff space.

a3 = a1(a2a3) = a1a2a3 (representing the bi-

mines their “product” a1a2 · · · an, irrespective
of the sequence of binary operations employed.
general equation
See also Galois equation,
Galois group, Galois theory. Recall that the Ga-
lois group G(K/k) of the ﬁnite ﬁeld extension
K/k is also called the Galois group of the alge-
braic equation f (X) = 0, when K is a minimal
splitting ﬁeld of a separable polynomial f (X)
∈k[X]. The algebraic equation f (X) = 0 is
also called a Galois equation when the exten-
sion ﬁeld K can be obtained by adjoining some
root of f (X) to k, i.e., when K = k(α) for some
root α of f (x). We also note that G(K/k) has a
faithful permutation representation based on the
permutation group of the roots of f (X). When
this representation is primitive, f (X) = 0 is
called a primitive equation. See primitive equa-
tion. See also affect (of f (X)).
Now, when α1, α2, . . . , αn are algebraically
independent elements over k, then the equation
F (n)(X) = 0 for the nth degree polynomial
F (n)(X) = Xn −α1Xn−1 + α2Xn−2
−α3Xn−3 ± · · · + (−1)nαn
from k(α1, α2, . . . , αn)[X] is called a general
equation of degree n. See algebraic indepen-
dence. The Galois group of this equation is then
isomorphic with Sn, the symmetric (or permu-
tation) group of degree n. Moreover, if char k ̸=
2, then the quadratic subﬁeld L corresponding
to the alternating group An of the same degree
is obtained by adjoining the square root of the
discriminant D of F (n)(X), i.e., L = k(

esting properties when 3\H is compact and 3

a more general case, when 3\G is noncompact
(though has a ﬁnite volume), the decomposition
of L2(3\G) into the irreducible representation
spaces has a continuous spectrum. Generalized
Eisenstein series (deﬁned by Selberg) give the

generalized Hardy class
A concept arising
in the theory of function algebras (or uniform
algebras) generalizing that of the Hardy class
from the theory of analytic functions.
[Recall that the Hardy class H p (p > 0) con-
sists of analytic functions on the open unit disc
D = {z : |z| < 1} having the property
sup
0<r<1
{

∂D
|f (rζ)|pdµ(ζ)}1/p < ∞,
where dµ = |dζ|/2π is normalized Lebesgue
measure on the boundary ∂D = {ζ : |ζ| = 1}
of D. This concept is important for harmonic
analysis, theory of power series, linear opera-
tors, random processes, approximation theory,
control theory (in particular the so-called H ∞
controltheory; notethatH ∞representstheclass
of bounded analytic functions in D), etc. Their
importance stems from the fact that they are pre-
cisely the classes of analytic functions in D with
boundary values (of class Lp) from which they
can be recovered by means of the Cauchy inte-
gral.]
For a function (uniform) algebra A with a
positive multiplicative measure µ, one deﬁnes
the generalized Hardy classes H p as the closure
of A in Lp(µ) for 1 ≤p < ∞, while for p =
∞, H ∞(µ) represents the weak ∗-closure of A
in L∞(µ).
Remark: Here one considers a ﬁxed uniform
algebra A on a compact Hausdorff space X, the
maximal ideal space MA of A, and a ﬁxed homo-
morphism φ ∈MA. It is important to recall
that there exists a correspondence between non-
zero complex-valued homomorphisms φ of A
and maximal ideals Aφ in A that are given by the
kernel of φ. In fact, MA is a compact Hausdorff
space. Then, designating by µ a measure for φ,
one deﬁnes H p(µ) as the closure of A in Lp(µ)
and, similarly, H ∞(µ) as the weak-star closure
of A in L∞(µ). Note that L∞(µ) is a com-
mutative Banach ∗-algebra (with the pointwise
multiplication and the involution given by com-
plex conjugation), which is isometrically iso-
morphic to the algebra of complex-valued con-
tinuous functions on the maximal ideal space of
L∞(µ).
generalized inverse
For an m × n matrix A,
with entries from the complex ﬁeld, the unique
n × m matrix A+ satisfying
(i.) AA+A = A,
(ii.) A+AA+ = A+,
(iii.) (AA+)∗= AA+,
(iv.) (A+A)∗= A+A.
This deﬁnition (by Penrose) is equivalent to
the deﬁnition (by Moore) that A+ is the unique
matrix so that
(1)AA+ isthe(orthogonal)projectionmatrix
onto the range of A,
(2)A+Aisthe(orthogonal)projectionmatrix
onto the range of A+.
The matrix A+ is also referred to as the Moore-
Penrose inverse (or pseudo inverse) of A.
There are other types of generalized inverses.
More usually encountered are the group inverse
A# ofasquarematrixA(AA#A = A, A#AA# =
A#, AA# = A#A), and the Drazin inverse AD
(ADAAD
=
AD, AAD
=
ADA, Ak
=
ADAk+1, k = 0, 1, . . . ). AD is unique and A#
is unique if it exists.
All generalized inverses coincide with A−1
when A is invertible.
generalized law of reciprocity

a ﬁnite Galois extension L/K, the reciprocity

a Frobenius lift ˜σ ∈φ( ˜L/K) of σ ∈G(L/K)

K and a multiplicative G-module A one deﬁnes
AK = AGK = {a ∈A : σa = a, ∀σ ∈GK} ,

⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

where GK is a closed subgroup of the proﬁnite
group G that is associated with the ﬁeld K and
AG/NGA is the norm residue group relative to
the norm group NGA = {NGa = 
σ∈G σa :
a ∈A}. One further deﬁnes the Galois group of
L/K as
G(L/K) = GK/GL ,
assuming that GL is a normal subgroup of GK.
In such a case, the extension L/K is called a
normal or Galois extension. See Galois exten-
sion. Note that for a ﬁnite extension L/K, when
AK ⊆AL, there is a normal map
NL/K : AL →AK,
NL/K(a) =

σ
σa ,
with σ ranging over the right representatives
of GK/GL.
When L/K is Galois, AL is a
G(L/K)-module and AK = AG(L/K)
L
.
Recall also that a prime element πK of AK,
πK ∈AK, is an element with vK(πK) = 1,
where vK designates a homomorphism
vK = 1

Z = lim

where
lim
←denotes projective limit. In fact, Z =

p Zp, where p is a prime.
Finally, for every ﬁnite extension K/k of the
ground ﬁeld, one deﬁnes ˜K = K · ˜k,
fK = [K ∩˜k : k]

An element
from the kernel of the Gel’fand representation
of a commutative Banach algebra R, i.e., an el-
ement x ∈R such that

The kernel of R is referred to as the radical of
R. When this radical reduces to {0}, R is said to
be semisimple.
generalized nilpotent group
An extension
of the concept of nilpotency to inﬁnite groups,
in a nonstandard manner. Thus, a group G is a
generalized nilpotent group if any homomorphic
image of G that is different from {e} has a center
that is different from {e}. This deﬁnition reduces
to the standard one when G is ﬁnite, but not
when G is an inﬁnite group.
generalized peak point
A point x in a com-

alized peak set. See peak set, generalized peak

generalized peak set
An intersection of peak

generalized quaternion group
A general-
ization of the quaternion group G, which is the
group of order 8 with two generators σ and τ
satisfying the relations σ 4 = e, τ 2 = σ 2 and
τστ −1 = σ −1, which is isomorphic to the mul-
tiplicative group of quaternion units {±1, ±i,
±j, ±k}. The generalized quaternion group is
a group of order 2n, (n ≥3), again with two
generators σ and τ, which, however, satisfy the
following relations:
σ 2n−1 = e, τ 2 = σ 2n−2
and
τστ −1 = σ −1 .
The standard quaternion group corresponds to
n = 3.

the form (z, 0) where z ∈Cn. (iii.) D is in-
variant under the following holomorphic trans-
formations of Cn × Cm for some c ∈R, and
for all s ∈Rn and t ∈R : (z, u) →(z + s, u),
(z, u) →(z, eitu), and (z, u) →(etz, ectu). In
the above situation, D is said to be a generalized
Siegel domain with exponent c.
generalized solvable group
An extension of
the concept of solvability to inﬁnite groups in a
nonstandard way. For example, a group G is a
generalized solvable group if any homomorphic
image of G that is different from {e} contains a
nontrivial (i.e., different from {e}) Abelian nor-
mal subgroup. As with generalized nilpotency,
this deﬁnition reduces to a standard one for ﬁ-
nite groups but not in the case of inﬁnite groups.
See generalized nilpotent group.
Generalized Tauberian Theorem
A theo-
rem, due to Wiener, originating in the theory of
the Fourier transform. Here we give a version
that is pertinent for the exploitation of Banach
algebras in the theory of topological groups.
The theorem pertains to the following prob-
lem of spectral synthesis. See spectral synthesis.
ConsideranAbeliantopologicalgroupGand
its L1-algebra (or group algebra) R. Let, further,

G designate the character group of G. Then any
closed ideal I in R determines a set Z(I) in

G consisting of common zeros of the Fourier
transforms of the elements of I. [Recall that
the Fourier transform of x ∈R is given by its
Gel’fand transform, in the present case by
ˆx(γ ) =

x(g)γ (g)dµ(g) ,
where γ is a character of G and µ is a (left-
invariant) measure on G (with G regarded as a
locally compact Hausdorff group).] The above-
mentioned problem then asks whether the con-
verse also holds, namely, whether I can be
uniquely characterized by Z(I).
A special case when Z(I) is empty is ad-
dressed by the Generalized Tauberian Theorem
which states that I must coincide with R when
Z(I) = ∅.

simply
by ei.
We call A a generalized uniserial algebra if
each indecomposable left (right) ideal Aei (eiA)
of A has a unique composition series. See com-
position series.
An algebra A is a generalized uniserial alge-
bra if its radical N is a principal left and right
ideal, and a uniserial algebra if and only if every
two-sided ideal of A is a principal left and right
ideal, i.e., if and only if every quotient algebra of
A is a Frobenius algebra. See uniserial algebra,
Frobenius algebra.
An algebra A is an absolutely uniserial al-
gebra if the algebra AK over K, where K is an
extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F, is uniserial for any
such extension K/F. This is the case if and
only if the radical N of A is a principal ideal
generated by an element from the center Z of A
and Z decomposes into a direct sum of simple
extensions F[α] of F.

eral rank. See valuation.

of a valuation) v : F →G∪{∞} of the ﬁeld F,

general linear group
On a ﬁnite dimensional
linear space V , with dimV = n, over a ﬁeld K,
the group of (nonsingular) linear mappings of
V onto V , the group operation being deﬁned
as composition of mappings, denoted GL(V ).
More

the
automorphism
group
AutK(V ) of the free right K-module V with n
generators, for K an associative ring with unit.
Equivalently, a general linear group of de-
gree n over K, usually designated GL(n, K)
or GLn(K), is a group of n × n invertible ma-
trices with entries in K. Clearly, GL(V ) and
GL(n, K) are isomorphic. When viewed as an
afﬁnite variety, GL(n, K) can also be regarded
as an algebraic group. See algebraic group. In
most applications, K is a ﬁeld. The structure of
GL(n, K) over a ring K is studied in algebraic
K-theory.
Also called full linear group. See also special
linear group, projective general linear group.
general linear Lie algebra
(Of degree n over
a commutative ring with unity [or over a ﬁeld]
K), a Lie algebra, denoted gl(n, K), which re-
sults from the total matrix algebra M(n, K) of
(all) n × n matrices with entries from K, when
endowed with a Lie (or bracket) product deﬁned
bythecommutator[X, Y] := XY−YX. SeeLie
algebra. A general linear Lie algebra gl(n, K)
is the Lie algebra of GL(n, K), a general lin-
ear group, and may thus also be regarded as the
tangent space to GL(n, K) at the identity (repre-
sented by the identity matrix). See also general
linear group.
general position
Let x0, . . . , xk be points in
Euclidean space. These points are said to be
in general position if they are not contained in
any plane of dimension less than k. This con-
cept may be generalized to geometric objects of
higher dimension.
general solution
As a rule, the general solu-
tion of a problem is a solution involving a cer-
tain number of parameters from which any other
solution (except for singular solutions) can be
obtained, through a suitable choice of these pa-

sion or an object that forms a separable part of

expressions separated by the plus sign (in a se-
ries or a polynomial), comma (in a sequence),
inequality or identity sign (in an inequality or a
chain of inequalities or equation(s)), etc. Also

generating representation
Let G be a com-
pact Lie group.
Designate, further, the com-
mutative, associative algebra of complex-valued
continuous functions on G by C(0)(G, C) ≡
C(0)(G), and its subalgebra of representative
functions referred to as the representative ring
of G by R(G, C) ≡R(G).
See representa-
tive function, representative ring.
Note that,
withthesupremumnorm∥f ∥= supg∈G |f (g)|,
C(0)(G) is a Banach space and the actions of
G on this space (given by left and right transla-
tions)arecontinuous. Atthesametime, C(0)(G)
may be completed with respect to the norm aris-
ing from the inner product (u, v) =

In view of the Peter-Weyl theorem, R(G)
is dense in both C(0)(G) and L2(G) so that
there exists a faithful (i.e., injective) represen-
tation ρ : G →GL(n, C) of G and R(G) may
be regarded as a ﬁnitely generated algebra over
C. Thus, there exists a faithful representation
g →{rij(g)} such that the functions rij and rij
generateR(G). Sucharepresentationisreferred
to as a generating representation.
generator(s)
(1) In group theory, the ele-
ments of a nonempty subset S of a group G such
that G is generated by S, i.e., G = ⟨S⟩, where
⟨S⟩consists of all possible products of the ele-
ments of S and of their inverses that are possibly
subject to a certain number of conditions (called
relations) of the type
sn1
1 sn2
2 · · · snm
m = e,
si ∈S, ni ∈Z .
When S is ﬁnite, G is said to be ﬁnitely gener-
ated or ﬁnitely presented. See relation, ﬁnitely
presented group. For a cyclic group, S consists
of a single element.
More precisely, let G be a group generated
by some set S ≡{s1, s2, . . . , sn} and let us des-
ignate by F the free group on S. Further, let T
be a subset of F, T ≡{t1, t2, . . . , tm} ⊂F, and
NT the smallest normal subgroup of F contain-
ing T (given by the intersection of all normal
subgroups of F containing T ). Then, G is said
to be given by the generators si, (i = 1, . . . , n)
subject to the relations t1 = t2 = · · · = tm = e,
if there is an isomorphism G ≈F/NT that as-
sociates si with siNT . This is usually expressed
by writing
G = ⟨s1, . . . , sn : t1 = t2 = · · · = tm = e⟩,
(1)
and one also says that G has the presentation
given by the right-hand side of (1).
Remarks: (i.) Although we have used a ﬁnite
number of generators and relations in the above
deﬁnition, this is not necessary.
(ii.) The relation ri = e, e.g., a−1b−2ab =
e, is often more convenient to write in the form
avoiding inverses, i.e., ab = b2a in our exam-
ple.
(iii.)
Recall that a free group is “free" of
relations, so that we can regard any element in
NT as the identity, as in fact the notation of (1)
suggests.
(iv.) Cyclic groups are generated by a single
generator (which, clearly, is not unique), e.g.,
Z8 = ⟨1⟩= ⟨3⟩= ⟨5⟩= ⟨7⟩.
(v.) See also ﬁnitely generated group.
(1a) In the analytic theory of semigroups,
one deﬁnes the inﬁnitesimal generator F of an
equicontinuous semigroup T of class (C0), T ≡
{Tt | t ≥0}, as a limit
Fx = lim
t→0+ t−1 (Tt −e) x .
(2) In ring theory, we say that an ideal I of
a (commutative) ring R is generated by a ﬁnite
subset S = {s1, . . . , sn} of R, when
I =
 n

i=1
risi : ri ∈R

in which case we also write
I = (s1, . . . , sn)
or
I =


i=1
Rsi ,
and refer to the ring elements si, i = 1, . . . , n,
as generators of I.
An ideal generated by a
single generator, I = (s), is called a principal
ideal. An extension to noncommutative rings is
obvious.
(3) An analogous deﬁnition also applies to
modules over a ring (or a ﬁeld).
Consider an A-module M (i.e., a module over
a ring A) and a family X = {xi}i∈I of elements
of M. The smallest sub-A-module N of M con-
taining all the elements of X consists of all linear
combinations of these elements and we write
N =

i∈I
Axi =

i∈I
aixi : ai ∈A, i ∈I

.
The family X is then referred to as a system of
generators for N. We also say that N is gener-
ated by X. When X is ﬁnite, i.e., Card(X) <
∞, N is said to be ﬁnitely generated, and an
A-module Ax, generated by a single element
x ∈M, is called a monomial.
When A is a ﬁeld, the A-module M becomes
a linear space over A, and the same terminol-
ogy is sometimes employed even in this case, al-
though one often deﬁnes M to be spanned rather
than generated by X, and X is referred to as a
spanning set (or a basis, if linearly independent).

(4) The method of deﬁning groups by gen-
erators and relations can be also applied to Lie
algebras. Let L be a Lie algebra over a ﬁeld F
generated by a set X = {Xi}i∈I. If L is free on
X (in which case the vector space V = Span(x)
can be given an L-module structure by assign-
ing to each x ∈X an element of the general
linear Lie algebra gl(V ) and extending canon-
ically to L) and M is the ideal of L generated
by a family of elements A = {aj}j∈J , J being
some index set, then the quotient algebra L/M
is referred to as the Lie algebra with generators
Xi, (i ∈I) and relations aj = 0, (j ∈J), with
Xi the image of the element xi ∈X in L/M.
This is referred to as a presentation of L.
Remarks: (i.) For semisimple Lie algebras
L over an algebraically closed ﬁeld F, charF =
0, one can give a presentation of L in terms of
generators and relations that depends only on
the root system of L. (See Serre’s Theorem.)
(ii.) In the physics literature, one often refers
to the basis elements of the deﬁning (or stan-
dard) representation of matrix Lie groups or al-
gebras as generators. Thus, for example, the
matrix units eij = ∥δikδjℓ∥of gl(n, F) are re-
ferred to as raising (i < j), lowering (i > j),
and weight (i = j) generators according as they
raise, lower, or preserve the weight of a repre-
sentation involved.
(5) In homological algebra, an object G of
an Abelian category A (with all functions be-
ing additive) is called a generator if the natural
mapping
Hom(A, B) →Hom (hG(A), hG(B))
is one to one. Here Hom designates the functor
deﬁning the category A,
Hom : A × A →(Ab) ,
with (Ab) designating the category of Abelian
groups, and with
hG(·) := Hom(G, ·) .
Similarly, one deﬁnes a cogenerator G when
Hom(A, B) →Hom

hG(B), hG(A)
	
is one to one, where now
hG(·) := Hom(·, G) .
(6) In coding theory, with a linear code de-
ﬁned as a subspace W of Vn = {0, 1, . . . , q −
1}n, with q being a prime power q = pα, one
associates with each element a ∈Vn the poly-
nomial
a(X) = a1 + a2X + · · · + anXn−1
over a Galois ﬁeld GF(q) [note that Vn can be
regarded as an n-dimensional vector space over
GF(q)]. Then the cyclic code W modulo g(X)
is deﬁned by
W = {a ∈Vn : a(X) ≡0(modg(X))}
and g(X) is referred to as the generator of N.
generic point
Consider an irreducible vari-
ety V in Kn, where K is the universal domain
and designate by k a ﬁeld of deﬁnition for V
(which is a subﬁeld of K, k ⊂K), having a ﬁnite
transcendence degree over the underlying prime
ﬁeld. See irreducible variety, universal domain,
transcendence degree, prime ﬁeld. Then a point
(x) ≡(x1, . . . , xn) of V , (x) ∈V , with the
property that all points of V are specializations
of (x) over k, is called a generic point of V over
k. See specialization. Note that in general a
generic point of V is not unique.
Remarks:
(i.) In some texts, generic point refers to an
arbitrary point of a nonempty Zariski open set
of a variety V . See Zariski open set.
(ii.) A generic point x in a topological (sub)-
space A is a generic point of A when A = {x}
(where the bar designates the closure in the hull-
kernel topology).
genus
(1) For an algebraic variety, a discrete,
numerical invariant representing an important
parameter then enables a classiﬁcation of such
varieties. These invariants may be deﬁned in
various ways, the most useful ones being based
on the concept of differential forms on a vari-
ety and on the cohomology of coherent sheaves.
One distinguishes the algebraic genus pa(X)
and the geometric genus pg(X) of a variety X.
See geometric genus.
For a one-dimensional algebraic variety C
over a ﬁeld k, referred to as an algebraic curve,
the genus g of C is deﬁned as the dimension
of the space of regular differential 1-forms on

C, assuming that C is smooth and complete.
See algebraic curve. We recall here that an al-
gebraic curve can be transformed into a plane
curve with only ordinary multiple points by a ﬁ-
nite number of plane Cremona transformations
(quadratic transformations of a projective plane
into itself).
See Cremona transformation.
A
plane algebraic curve C of degree n is a point
set in an afﬁne 2-space deﬁned by the zero set
f (X, Y) = 0, of an nth degree polynomial f (X,
Y) in X and Y. Setting F(X0, X1, X2) = Xn
0
f (X1/X0, X2/X0), the homogeneous polyno-
mial F deﬁnes an algebraic curve C of degree
n in a projective plane P2. We say that C is ir-
reducible if f (X, Y) is irreducible. Clearly, a
curve of degree 1 is a line. A point P = (a, b)
on C is an r-ple point if f (X +a, Y +b) has no
terms of degree less than r in X and Y. There
are r tangent straight lines (counting multiplic-
ity) at such a point: if these tangents are all dis-
tinct, P is referred to as an ordinary point and
an ordinary double point is called a node. An
r-ple point with r > 1 is called a multiple or a
singular point.
For a nonsingular irreducible curve C, we de-
ﬁne a divisor a as an element of the free Abelian
group G(C) generated by the points of C that is
of the form
a =

i
niPi,
(ni ∈Z)
(1)
and has a degree deg(a) = 
i ni. We say that
the representation (1) for a is reduced if Pi ̸= Pj
for i ̸= j. A positive or an integral divisor, writ-
ten as a ≻0, involves only positive coefﬁcients
ni, (ni > 0). We further designate by w a dis-
crete valuation whose value group is the additive
group of integers, thus representing a normal (or
normalized) valuation wP of K(C) deﬁned by
a valuation ring RP given by the subset of the
function ﬁeld K(C) of C (K designating the uni-
versal domain) consisting of those functions f
that are regular at P. The integer wP (f ) is re-
ferred to as the order of f at P, and P is said
to be a zero of f when wP (f ) > 0 and a pole
when wP (f ) < 0. The linear combination
"wP (f )P =: (f )
(2)
is called the divisor of the function f , and the set
of all positive divisors that are linearly equiva-
lent to a given divisor a is referred to as a com-
plete linear system determined by a and is des-
ignated by |a|. Further, one deﬁnes a ﬁnite di-
mensional vector space V(a) over K as follows:
V(a) := {f ∈K(C) : (f ) + a ≻0} ,
whose one-dimensional subspaces are in a bi-
jective correspondence with the elements of |a|.
We then deﬁne the dimension of |a|, dim|a|, by
dim|a| := dimKV(a) −1 ,
and the genus of C, g ≡g(C), as the supremum
of non-negative and bounded integers deg(a) −
dim |a|,
g :=
sup
a∈G(C)
(deg(a) −dim |a|) .
One can show that for any g > 0, g ∈Z,
there exists an algebraic curve of genus g. The
curves with g = 1 are the so-called elliptic
curves and those with g > 1 are subdivided into
theclassesofhyperelliptic andnon-hyperelliptic
curves. See elliptic curve, hyperelliptic curve.

For an r-dimensional projective variety Y in
Pn (a projective n-space over an algebraically
closed ﬁeld k), the arithmetic genus of Y can
be deﬁned in terms of the constant term of the
Hilbert polynomial PY (X), X = (X0, X1, . . . ,
Xn), of Y, as follows:
pa(Y) = (−1)r (PY (0) −1) .
It can be shown that pa(Y) is independent of
projective embeddings of Y. When Y is a plane
curve of degree d (see above), then
pa(Y) = 1
2(d −1)(d −2) ,
and when it is a hypersurface of degree d, then
pa(Y) =

d−1
n
	
.
Equivalently, for a projective scheme Y over a
ﬁeld k, the arithmetic genus pa(Y) can be de-
ﬁned by
pa(Y) = (−1)r [χ (OY ) −1] ,
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

where OY designates a sheaf of rings of regular
functions from Y to k and χ(F) is the so-called
Euler characteristic of a coherent sheaf F on
Y that is deﬁned in terms of the cohomology
groups H i(Y, F) of F as follows:
χ(F) := "(−1)i dimk H i(Y, F) .
See projective scheme. Thus, when Y is a curve,
we have that
pa(Y) = dimk H 1 (Y, OY ) ,
while for a complete smooth algebraic surface
Y, we have
pa(Y) = χ (OY ) −1
= dimk H 2 (Y, OY ) −dimk H 1 (Y, OY ) .
Ontheotherhand, thegeometricgenuspg(Y)
of a nonsingular projective variety Y over k is
deﬁned as the dimension of the (global) section
of the canonical sheaf ωY of Y (deﬁned as the
nth exterior power of the sheaf of differentials
where n = dim Y), 3(Y, ωY ), i.e.,
pg(Y) := dimk 3 (Y, ωY ) .
For a projective nonsingular curve C, the arith-
metic and the geometric genuses coincide, i.e.,
pa(C) = pg(C) = g, while for varieties of di-
mension greater than or equal to 2, they are not
necessarilyequal, andtheirdifferenceisreferred
to as the irregularity of Y. See irregularity.
(2) For an algebraic function ﬁeld K over
k of dimension 1 (or of transcendence degree
1) (i.e., a ﬁnite separable extension of a purely
transcendental extension k(x) of k such that k
is maximally algebraic in K), the genus of K/k
is deﬁned similarly as for a curve C. Thus, it
is achieved by replacing C with K/k, K(C) by
K, and K by k, while points on C now become
prime divisors of K/k.
We can also say that the genus of a function
ﬁeld is given by the genus of its Riemann surface
(recall that the Riemann surface S of a function
ﬁeld is homeomorphic to the complement of a
ﬁnite set of points in a compact oriented two-
dimensional manifold S, while the genus of the
latter is deﬁned, loosely speaking, as the number
of “holes” in S, i.e., g = 0 if S is a sphere, g = 1
if S is a torus, etc.).
(3) For quadratic forms Q over an algebraic
numberﬁeldk ofﬁnitedegree, onedeﬁnesequiv-
alence classes of forms having the same genus
byrequiringthatQandQ′ beequivalentoverthe
principle order op in kp for all non-Achimedean
prime divisors p of k and, at the same time, that
they are equivalent over kp for all the Archime-
dian prime divisors p of k. (Recall that prime
divisors of k are equivalence classes of nontriv-
ial multiplicative valuations over k and are re-
ferred to as Archimedean or non-Archimedian
accordingly if these valuations are Archimedean
or not.) See valuation.
(4) For a complex matrix representation of a
ﬁnite group G. Consider a ﬁnite group G and
an algebraic number ﬁeld K. Recall that there
exists a bijective correspondence between linear
and matrix representations of G and that every
linear representation of G over K is equivalent
to some linear representation of the group ring
K[G]. When K is the ring of rational integers, a
linear representation over K is called an integral
representation.
Further, for a given algebraic number ﬁeld
K, every K[G]-module V contains G-invariant
R-lattices (called G-lattices for short), where R
is the ring of integers in K, that may be viewed
as ﬁnitely generated R[G]-modules, providing
an integral representation of G.
Designating by P a prime ideal of R and by
RP the ring of quotients (or fractions) of the ring
R with respect to the prime ideal P, also called
the local ring at P, one can also explore the RP -
representations (this approach is closely related
with modular representation theory). Thus, with
any R[G]-module M we can associate a family
of RP [G]-modules MP = RP ⊗M, with P
ranging over all prime ideals of R. Then, when,
for two G-lattices (or R[G]-modules) M and
N, belonging to a K[G]-module V , we have
that MP ∼= NP for all P, we say that M and N
have (or are of) the same genus. (See also class
number.)
(5)Similarly, foraconnectedalgebraicgroup
G over an algebraic number ﬁeld k of ﬁnite de-
gree, we consider a ring R of integers in k and
designate by L a general R-lattice (also called a
transformation space) in the vector space V on
which G acts. Deﬁning then an action of GA,
the adele group of G, on the set {L} of R-lattices
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

in a natural way, one deﬁnes the genus of L as
the orbit GAL of L with respect to GA.
(6) For an imaginary quadratic ﬁeld k. (See
also principal genus of k.) Each coset of the
ideal class group G of k modulo the subgroup
H of all ideal classes of k satisfying the condi-
tion (ϵ1, . . . , ϵt) = (1, . . . , t) is referred to as
a genus of k. See ideal class, ideal class group.
Here, ϵ1 = χi(N(a)), i = 1, . . . , t, where a
is an integral ideal with (a, (d)) = 1, N desig-
nates the norm, the χi are the Kronecker sym-
bols, and d is the discriminant of k. See Kro-
necker symbol. For each genus, the values of
ϵi, (i = 1, . . . , t) are unique and (ϵ1, . . . , ϵt) is
called the character system of this genus. See

linear representation of K on T .
Every pair
(T, K) corresponds to a set of crystallographic
groups. Two pairs (T1, K1) and (T2, K2) are
said to be geometrically equivalent if there ex-
ists a g ∈GL(V ) such that K2 = gK1g−1. This

of distinct elements of V . Allowing multiplici-
ties for the elements of E or allowing loops (an
element of E of the form (v, v)) gives a gen-
eral graph, also called a graph. The elements
of V are called vertices and the elements of E
are called edges. Thus a pair (u, v) ∈E may
be visualized as a line segment joining points

of the group H by the group F if there is a short
exact sequence 1 →H →G →F →1. See

grouping of terms
The rearranging of terms
in an expression into a form more convenient for
some purpose. For example, one may group the

to produce the expression (3x + 5x2) + ey.

group minimization problem
Suppose that
A is an m × n matrix with real entries, b a vec-
tor in Euclidean m-space Rm, and c a vector in
Rn. Consider the vector xB of basic variables
associated with a dual feasible basis of the linear
programming problem of minimizing cT x sub-
ject to the conditions that Ax = b and xj ≥0
for j = 1, . . . , n. Denote by S the set of vectors
x such that Ax = b, xj ≥0 for j = 1, . . . , n,
and some of the coordinates of x are restricted
to be integers. The problem of minimizing cT x
subject to the condition that x is an element of
the group generated from S by ignoring the non-
negativity constraints on the coordinates of the
vector xB is called a group minimization prob-
lem. One may solve this problem by ﬁnding
the shortest path on a directed graph that has a
special structure. If each coordinate of the vec-
tor of basic variables for the optimal solution of
the group minimization problem is nonnegative,
then that solution is optimal for the original lin-
ear programming problem; otherwise one may

groupofautomorphisms
Aone-to-onemap-
ping α : A →A, where A is an algebraic ob-
ject, for example an algebra or a group, such
that α preserves whatever algebraic structure A
has. Any such α has an inverse which also pre-
serves the structure of A. The composition of
two such automorphisms does this as well. The
set of all such α forms the automorphism group
of A (where the composition map in this group
is a composition of functions). See also auto-
morphism group.
group of classes of algebraic correspondences
Suppose that C is a nonsingular curve. Denote
by G the group of divisors of the product variety
C × C, and denote by D the subgroup of divi-
sors that are linearly equivalent to degenerate
divisors. The quotient group G/D is called the
group of classes of algebraic correspondences.
group of congruence classes
Let m > 0 be
an integer. Two integers a and b are said to be
congruent mod m (written a ≡b mod m) if
a −b is divisible by m. This is an equivalence
relation. (See equivalence relation.) Denote the
equivalence class of the integer a by [a]; thus
[a] = {b : b ≡a mod m}. Then the set of
equivalence classes for this equivalence relation
is a group under “addition” deﬁned by [a] +
[b] = [a + b]. This group is called the group of
congruence classes or group of congruences of
the integers modulo m.
group of inner automorphisms
For each
element g of a group G, let i(g) : G →G be
the map deﬁned by i(g)(g′) = gg′g−1. Then
we have i(gh) = i(g)i(h), for all g, h ∈G and
also i(g−1) = i(g)−1. It follows that i(g) is
an automorphism of G and the set of all such
i(g) (for all g ∈G) is called the group of inner
automorphisms of G. It is a normal subgroup of
the group of automorphisms of G.
group of outer automorphisms
The quo-
tient group Aut(G)/Inn(G), where Aut(G) is
the group of all automorphisms of G and Inn(G)
is the normal subgroup of Aut(G) consisting of
all inner automorphisms if G. See group of inner
automorphisms.
group of quotients
Let S be a commutative
semigroup with cancellation (so that ab = ac
implies b = c), then there is an embedding of S
in a group G such that any g ∈G can be written
as g = st−1, where s, t ∈G. Here G is called
the group of quotients of S.
group of symmetries
If L is a geometric
object, then a symmetry of L is a one-to-one
mapping of L to itself which preserves the ge-
ometry of the object (e.g., preserves the metric,
if L is a subset of a metric space). The set of all
such symmetries forms a group called the group
of symmetries.
group of twisted type
Suppose that F is a
ﬁeld. Denote by L a simple Lie algebra over
the complex numbers that corresponds to the
Dynkin diagram of some type X, and denote by
C the Chevalley group of type X over F. Con-
sider the Lie algebra LZ spanned by Chevalley’s
canonical basis of L over the ring Z of integers.
Then C is generated by linear transformations
xa(t) of the Lie algebra F ⊗Z LZ, with a a root
of L, and t in F.
(1)IfX equalsAn, Dn, orE6, thentheDynkin
diagram of type X has a nontrivial symmetry τ.
If τ(a) = b, and if F has an automorphism
σ such that the order of σ equals the order of
τ, then denote by θ the automorphism of C
that sends xa(t) to xb(tσ). Denote by U the
θ-invariant elements of the subgroup of C gen-
erated by {xa(t) : a > 0, t ∈F}, and denote
by V the θ-invariant elements of the subgroup
of C generated by {xb(t) : b < 0, t ∈F}. The
group generated by U and V is called a group
of twisted type.
(2) Suppose that X equals either B2 or F4 and
that the ﬁeld F has characteristic 2, or suppose
that X = G2 and the ﬁeld F has characteris-
tic 3. If F has an automorphism σ such that
(tσ)σ = tp for each t in F, then one may ap-
ply a procedure similar to that described in (1)
above to obtain in each case another group of
twisted type.

ber none of whose prime divisors are in P. A

Hamilton’s quaternion algebra
The non-
commutative ring generated over the real num-
bers by 1, i, j, k where 1 is the identity, i2 =
−1, j2 = −1, k2 = −1 and ijk = −1. Thus,
an arbitrary element has the form q = a +
bi + cj + dk, where a, b, c, d are real num-
bers. The conjugate of q is the quaternion ¯q =
a −bi −cj −dk, which has the property that
q ¯q = a2 + b2 + c2 + d2.
This allows one
to show that each non-zero q has an inverse
q−1 = ¯q/(q ¯q). Thus, we have an example of
a non-commutative division algebra. The set
of quaternions of norm 1 (q ¯q = 1) forms a
group under multiplication which is isomorphic
to SU(2).

over a perfect ﬁeld k of characteristic p > 0
and let F : E →E be the Frobenius mor-
phism (induced by the p-power map). Let F ∗:
H 1(E, OE) →H 1(E, OE) be the induced map
on cohomology. If F ∗= 0, then E has Hasse
invariant 1; otherwise E has Hasse invariant 1.
Here H 1(E, OE) is a one-dimensional vector
space over k, since E is elliptic, and OE is the
sheaf of regular functions on the variety E.

tional elements and let Di (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) be

Also called
Hasse-Minkowski symbol, Hasse symbol, and
Minkowski-Hasse character. An invariant of a
quadraticformwhich, whenconsideredtogether
withthediscriminantoftheformandthenumber

form over a local ﬁeld. Let F be either a com-
plete archimedean ﬁeld or a local ﬁeld of charac-

Note that χ∗
p = χp · (d(f ), d(f )) where d(f )
is the discriminant of f . The Hasse-Minkowski
character depends only on the equivalence class
of the form f and not on the diagonalization
used. It may also be deﬁned in terms of the
Hasse algebra of f by setting χp(f ) = 1 if the
Hasse algebra associated with f splits and -1 if
it does not. The Hasse-Minkowski character is
sometimes called the Hasse invariant, since the
Hasse invariant is either 1 or the unique element
of order 2 in the Brauer group of F. See also

Hasse-Minkowski Theorem
If q is a qua-
dratic form over a global ﬁeld F, with charac-
teristic not equal to 2, then q is isotropic over F
if and only if q is isotropic over all F℘, where
F℘is the completion of F at the place ℘.
If F and F℘are deﬁned as above, this the-
orem leads to the following statement: Two
quadratic forms are equivalent over F if and
only if they are equivalent over all F℘, if and
only if they have the same dimension, discrim-

Hasse principle
Let X be a smooth projec-
tive variety over an algebraic number ﬁeld k. A
fundamental Diophantine problem for X is to
decide whether there are any k-rational points
on X and, if so, to describe them. When X is a
geometrically integral quadric, the Hasse prin-
ciple afﬁrms that if X has rational points in every
completion of k, then it has rational points in k.

Let m1, m2, and m3 be

Hilbert modular group
If M ∈PSL(2, Od)
is a matrix and M stands for the matrix ob-
tained by replacing each entry of M by its Galois
conjugate, then the map M →(M, M) sends
PSL(2, Od) to an irreducible lattice in G (where
G = PSL(2, R) × PSL(2, R)).
This last is
called a Hilbert modular group. It is known that
any irreducible lattice in G is commensurable to
one of the Hilbert modular groups.

Denote by G a

product of the upper half-space with itself. After
adding a ﬁnite number of points to H 2/G and
obtaining the minimal resolution of the space,
one obtains a nonsingular surface over the com-
plex numbers. This surface is called the Hilbert

Hilbert scheme
Let k be an algebraically
closed ﬁeld. The Hilbert scheme parametrizes
all closed subschemes of P n
k . Here, if R is a
ring, then P n
k is the projective n space over the
ring R. It satisﬁes the following condition: to
give a closed subscheme S in P n
T which is ﬂat
over T (for any scheme T ) is the same as giving a
morphism f : T →H. Here the map f acts on
t ∈T by f (t) = the point of H corresponding
to the ﬁber St in P n
k(T ).
Hilbert’s Irreducibility Theorem

ables x1, . . . , xn over an algebraic number ﬁeld

Hodge theory
A body of results concern-
ing cohomology groups of manifolds. Three of
these results are listed here.
(1) Suppose that X is a closed oriented Rie-
mannian manifold. Then each element of a co-
homology group of X with complex coefﬁcients
has a unique harmonic representative.
(2) Suppose that V is a compact complex
manifold of dimension n that is the image of
a holomorphic mapping from a compact Kähler
manifold of dimension n. If q = max(n −p +
1, 0), then H n(V, C) carries the Hodge structure
induced by the type (p, q)-decomposition of the
space of differential forms on the manifold.
(3) If X is a smooth noncomplete irreducible
variety, then H n(X, C) carries a mixed Hodge
structure that is independent of the choice of
complete algebraic variety X such that X −X
is a subvariety.

operator and f (z) is a holomorphic function on
(a neighborhood of) the spectrum of T (the set
of eigenvalues of T , if X is ﬁnite dimensional),
then one can deﬁne f (T ) via a Cauchy type inte-
gral. The map f →f (T ) is a homomorphism
from the algebra of holomorphic functions in a

thogonal group. Denote by A, B, and G the sets
of arithmetic crystal classes, of Bravais types,
and of geometric crystal classes of (T, K), re-
spectively. There are surjective mappings s1 :
A →B and s2 : A →G, and there is an in-
jective mapping i : B →A such that s1 ◦i is
the identity mapping on B. A holosymmetric

A linear
difference equation of the form

where c1, . . . , cn are given real or complex num-

The notion is similar to that of homogeneous
linear equation except that difference equations
are often written in terms of xn and powers of the
difference operator <xn = xn −xn−1, so that
they can be considered as analogs of differential
equations.
homogeneous domain
A domain with a tran-
sitive group of automorphisms.
In more de-
tail, a domain is a connected open subset of

neous if it has a transitive group of analytic
(holomorphic) automorphisms. This means that
any pair of points z and w can be interchanged,
i.e., φ(z) = w, by an invertible analytic map
φ carrying the domain onto itself. For exam-
ple, the unit ball in complex N space, {z =

homological algebra
Originally called mul-
tilinear algebra, this branch of algebra deals
with the category of left (or right) R-modules
over some ring R (generally assumed to be as-
sociative and to possess an identity element).
A left R-module is an Abelian group A, to-
gether with a ring homomorphism of the ring
R into the ring of endomorphisms (homomor-
phisms) of A into itself. A right R-module is de-
ﬁned similarly except the ring homomorphism
is replaced by a ring anti-homomorphism (i.e.,
the order of products is reversed). When R is
commutative, a structure as a left R-module in-
duces a structure as a right R-module and vice
versa. The morphisms of this category are the
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

R-homomorphisms f : A →B for a pair of R-
modules A and B. By an R-homomorphism we
mean a group homomorphism of A into B with
the property that f (λa) = λf (a), for all λ ∈R
and a ∈A, when A and B are left R-modules
and, when A and B are right R-modules, we
assume that f (aλ) = f (a)λ. These categories
have two fundamental functors, both of which
take their values in the category of all Abelian
groups (which is, in the terminology of this def-
inition, the category of left Z-modules).
We
describe them separately.
Given two left R-modules A, B, HomR(A,
B) denotes the Abelian group of all R-homo-
morphisms of A into B. When R is commuta-
tive, HomR(A, B) is also both a left and right
R-module. This functor is covariant in the sec-
ond variable and contravariant in the ﬁrst. By
covariant in the second variable we mean that if
B →C is a morphism then there is an induced
morphism
HomR(A, B) →HomR(A, C) .
By contravariant in the ﬁrst variable we mean
that there is an induced morphism
HomR(B, A) ←HomR(C, A) .
This functor is left exact in both variables. By
this we mean that, given any exact sequence
B →C →0, the induced group homomor-
phisms
0 →HomR(C, A) →HomR(B, A)
forms an exact sequence and that any exact se-
quence 0 →B →C induces an exact sequence
0 →HomR(A, B) →HomR(A, C).
When A is a right R-module and B is a left R-
module then there is an Abelian group A ⊗R B
called the tensor product of A and B that con-
sists of formal sums of pairs (a, b) where a is
a member of A and b is a member of B and is
subject to the relations
((a1 + a2) , b) ≡(a1, b) + (a2, b)
(a, b1 + b2) ≡(a, b1) + (a, b2)
(aλ, b) ≡(a, λb) for all λ ∈R .
A ⊗R B is covariant in both variables and right
exact in both. When R is commutative, A ⊗R
B can be regarded as both a left and right R-
module.
Further development of these ideas leads to
certain derived functors called Extn
R(A, B) in
the case of the Hom functor and Torn
R(A, B) in
the case of the tensor product functor. There is
one such functor for each n ≥0 and, in case
n = 0, these coincide with Hom and the ten-
sor product. This development is too lengthy
and technical to describe further here. See Ext
group, Tor.
homological dimension
Let C be the cate-
gory of left R-modules where R is an associa-
tive ring with identity. We construct a projective
resolution of an R-module A by ﬁrst taking a
projective module P0, together with an epimor-
phism P0 →A →0 and kernel K0. There
always exists such a projective module since a
free module on any set of generators for A will
work. If K0 is not projective, repeat this proc-
ess with an epimorphism P1 →K0 →0 and
kernel K1. Continue until a kernel Kn which
is projective is obtained. The index n is called
the projective dimension or homological dimen-
sion of the module A. Two facts must be proved
before this notion makes sense: (i.) A has ho-
mological dimension 0 if and only if A is, itself,
projective and (ii.) the index n is independent
of the particular sequence of projective modules
used. See projective module.
homological functor
A sequence of additive
covariant functors of Abelian categories H =
{Hi : A →A′} deﬁned for −∞< i < +∞
with the following properties. For each short
exact sequence 0 →A′ →A →A′′ →0 in
A, and morphism of exact sequences f , there
exist connecting morphisms δ∗: Hi(A′′) →
Hi−1(A′) such that δ∗◦Hi(f ′′) = Hi−1(f ′)◦δ∗.
The sequence
· · · →Hi+1(A′′)
δ∗
→Hi(A′) →Hi(A)
→Hi(A′′)
δ∗
→Hi−1(A′) →· · ·
is a complex which is always exact.
homological mapping

homology modules induced by a chain map-
ping. Let A be a ring with unit, and let (X, δ)

and (Y, δ′) be chain complexes over A with ho-
mology modules H(X) and H(Y).
The A-
homomorphism f∗: H(X) →H(Y), of degree
zero, induced by a chain mapping f : X →Y,
is called the homological mapping induced by
f .
homology
Let {An : n ∈Z} be a set of R-
modules over some ring R. Assume that there
is a family of R-homomorphisms fn : An →
An−1 with the property that the composite ho-
momorphisms fn−1fn = 0 for all n. This data
deﬁnes a chain complex. The latter condition
implies that Im(fn) ⊆Ker(fn−1), where Im(f )
is the image of f and Ker(f ) is the kernel of
f . Then the factor module ker(fn−1)/Im(fn) =
Hn−1 is the (n −1)st homology module of the
complex.
The sequence of these modules is
called the homology of the complex.
homology class
The residue class of a cycle
modulo a boundary in the group of chains. Let
A be an Abelian category and let C = (Cn, dn)
be a chain complex in A. Let Zn = Ker dn and Bn
= Im dn+1. A residue class of Zn/Bn is called a
homology class.
homology group
When a chain complex of
Abelian groups is given, then its homology con-
sists of a sequence of homology groups. See
chain complex.
homology module
When a chain complex of
R-modules over some ring R is given, then its
homology consists of a sequence of homology
modules. See chain complex.
homomorphism
Algebraic structures such
as groups, rings, ﬁelds, and modules are all de-
ﬁned with one or more binary operations. Sup-
pose that ◦: S × S →S is one such binary
operation which is, simply, a function from the
Cartesian product S × S to S. We customarily
write a ◦b instead of the more standard func-
tional notation ◦(a, b) to describe the action of
this function. Then a homomorphism is a func-
tion f : S →T from one such object to another
with the property that f (a ◦b) = f (a) ◦f (b)
for all a, b ∈S.
Additional qualiﬁers such
as group homomorphism, ring homomorphism,
or R-homomorphism are used to describe ho-
momorphisms deﬁned on groups, rings, or R-
modules.
Homomorphism Theorem of Groups
Let
G be a group and let H and N be subgroups of
G such that N is normal (aNa−1 ⊆N for all
a ∈G.) Then (i.) HN = NH = {x ∈G : x =
nh, for some n ∈N} is a subgroup of G, (ii.)
N is a normal subgroup of NH, (iii.) N ∩H
is a normal subgroup of H, and (iv.) the factor
group NH/N is isomorphic to the factor group
H/(N ∩H).
homotopy
Let X and Y be topological spaces
and let f and g be continuous functions from
X to Y. We will say that f is homotopic to g
(often written f ∼g) to mean that there is a
continuous function F : X × I →Y deﬁned,
on the Cartesian product of X with the unit in-
terval I = [0, 1], such that F(x, 0) = f (x) and
F(x, 1) = g(x) for all x ∈X. The relation
of being homotopic is an equivalence relation.
The function F that deﬁnes the relation is often
spoken of as the homotopy.
When X is the unit interval (i.e., when we
are talking about paths in the space Y), it is cus-
tomary to make the additional assumption that
F(0, s) ≡f (0) = g(0) and F(1, s) ≡f (1) =
g(1).
homotopy associative
Let G be a topologi-
cal space carrying the structure of an H-space,
deﬁned by the continuous map µ : G×G →G.
See H-space. Given points x, y, z ∈G, we can
deﬁne the maps f (x, y, z) = µ(x, µ(y, z)) and
g(x, y, z) = µ(µ(x, y), z) from G×G×G →
G. We say that µ is homotopy associative if f
and g are homotopic as maps.
homotopy commutative
Let G be a topolog-
ical space carrying the structure of an H-space,
deﬁned by the continuous map µ : G×G →G.
(See H-space.)
Given points x, y ∈G, we
can deﬁne the maps f (x, y) = µ(x, y) and
g(x, y) = µ(y, x) from G × G to G. We say
that µ is homotopy commutative if f and g are
homotopic as maps.
homotopy identity
Let G be a topological
space carrying the structure of an H-space, de-
ﬁned by the continuous map µ : G × G →G.
c

(See H-space.)
A constant map e(x) = e is
called a homotopy identity if the maps deﬁned
by µ(x, e) and µ(e, x) are both homotopic to
the identity map i on G deﬁned by i(x) = x for
all x ∈G.
homotopy inverse
Let G be a topological
space carrying the structure of an H-space, de-
ﬁned by the continuous map µ : G × G →
G and having a homotopy identity e. See H-
space, homotopy identity. A continuous map
ν : G →G deﬁnes a homotopy inverse if the
maps deﬁned by µ(x, ν(x)) and µ(ν(x), x) are
both homotopic to the homotopy identity e.
Hopf algebra
Two types of Hopf algebras
have been deﬁned. The ﬁrst one was introduced
by Hopf and is used in the study of homology
and cohomology of Lie groups. The second type
was introduced by Sweedler and has applica-
tions in the study of algebraic groups.
(1) A (graded) Hopf algebra (A, φ, ψ) over
a ﬁeld k is a graded algebra with multiplication
φ which is also a graded co-algebra with comul-
tiplication ψ such that φ : (A, ψ) ⊗(A, ψ) →
(A, ψ) is a homomorphism of graded co-alge-
bras. This type of Hopf algebra is frequently
assumed to be connected, commutative, cocom-
mutative, and of ﬁnite type.
(2) A Hopf algebra with an antipode S is a
bialgebra with antipode S. See also antipode.
Hopf algebra homomorphism
A bialgebra
homomorphism f , between a Hopf algebra H
with antipode S and a Hopf algebra H ′ with
antipode S′ such that S′f = f S. See also Hopf
algebra.
Hopf comultiplication
A degree preserv-
ing linear map deﬁned as follows. Let X be
a topological space with a base point x0 and let
µ be a continuous base point preserving map-
ping from X × X to X. Let ι1(x) = (x, x0)
and ι2(x) = (x0, x).
If µ ◦ιi is homotopic
to 1X, then µ induces a degree preserving linear
map, µ∗, from the cohomology group H ∗(X) to
H ∗(X) ⊗H ∗(X) via a K¨unneth isomorphism.
In this situation µ∗is called a Hopf comultipli-
cation and (X, µ) is called an H-space. If α is
an element of H ∗(X), then µ∗(α) is called the
Hopf coproduct of α.
Hopf coproduct
The image of an element
under a Hopf comultiplication. See Hopf co-
multiplication.
Hornermethodofsolvingalgebraicequations
An iteration method for ﬁnding the real roots of
an algebraic equation. Locate a positive root
between two successive integers. If a1 is the
greatest integer less than the root, use the sub-
stitution x1 = x −a1 to transform the equation
into one that has a root between 0 and 1. Lo-
cate this root between successive tenths. Use
the substitution x2 = x1 −a2 to transform the
equation to one that has a root between 0 and
one-tenth. Continue this process. The desired
root is then approximately a1 + a2 + · · · + an.
Householder method of matrix transforma-
tion
A method of transforming a symmet-
ric matrix A into a tridiagonal matrix B. The
method uses a similarity transformation of the
form A →H −1AH, where H represents an
orthogonal matrix of the form I −2uu∗with
u∗u = 1. In the above situation, I represents the
identity matrix and u∗is the conjugate transpose
of u.

The matrix
transformation u = Hv where H is a symmet-
ric and orthogonal matrix of the form H =

represents the identity matrix.

C(z, a) = (1−|a|)/|a|−(1−|a|2)/|a|(1−az),
the Blaschke product converges absolutely at a
point z0 if and only if 
 C(z0, an) converges
absolutely. Thus, in complex analysis, an H-
series is a series of the form

cn/(1 −anz) ,
where 0 < |an| < 1 (n = 1, 2, · · · ) and 
(1 −
|an|) < ∞. The set of points on C at which
the H-series converges is called its set of con-
vergence. The subject of representation theory
also considers H-series.

H-series
H-space
A topological space G, together
with a continuous map µ : G × G →G, from
the Cartesian product of G with itself to G. In
practice, various additional conditions are im-
posed on such maps that make them imitate the
properties normally associated with a multipli-
cation. See homotopy.
hull-kernel topology
A topology on the set
of primitive ideals (the structure space I) of a
Banach algebra R. Under this topology, the clo-
sure of a set U is the set of primitive ideals con-
taining the intersection of the ideals in U.
Hurwitz’s relation
A relation between the
Riemann matrices of two Abelian varieties T1
and T2 that implies the existence of a homo-
morphism from T1 to T2.
Let T1 and T2 be
Abelian varieties with Riemann matrices F1 =
(ω(1)
1 , . . . , ω(1)
2n ) and F2 = (ω(2)
1 , . . . , ω(2)
2m).
There is a homomorphism λ : T1 →T2 if and
only if there is a complex matrix W, and a ma-
trix M with integer entries, such that WF1 =
F2M. In particular, for every homomorphism
λ : T1 →T2 there is a representation matrix
W(λ) with complex coefﬁcients, and a represen-
tation matrix M(λ) with respect to the real coor-
dinate systems (ω(1)
1 , . . . , ω(1)
2n ) and (ω(2)
1 , . . . ,
ω(2)
2m), that has coefﬁcients in Z, such that W(λ)
F1 = F2M(λ).
Hurwitz’s Theorem
If every member of a
normal family (of analytic functions on a con-
nected, open, planar set F) is never zero on
F, then the limit functions are either identically
zero or never zero on F.
A family of analytic functions on a set F is
normal on F if every sequence from the fam-
ily contains a subsequence that converges uni-
formly on compact subsets of F.

The six complex func-

Due to the fact that sinh(iz) = i · sin(z) and
cosh(iz) = cos(z), where sin(z) and cos(z) are
the ordinary sine and cosine of the complex an-
gle z, the hyperbolic functions are rarely used
outside of certain specialized applications.

hyperbolic transformation
A linear frac-
tional function f (z) = az+b
cz+d where a, b, c, and
d are complex constants with ad −bc ̸= 0 has
a pair of (not necessarily distinct) ﬁxed points.
(See linear fractional function.) This is so be-
cause the equation z = az+b
cz+d is linear or qua-
dratic in z. When the two ﬁxed points coin-
cide, the transformation is said to be parabolic.
When there are distinct ﬁxed points, say α and
β, then we can write the transformation in the
form w−α
w−β = k z−α
z−β . When k is real (necessarily
non-zero) the transformation is said to be hyper-
bolic. When |k| = 1, the transformation is said

hyperbolic trigonometry
One of the two
classical types of non-Euclidean plane geom-
etry, which are distinguished from each other
and from Euclidean plane geometry by the form
of the parallel axiom that holds. For Euclidean
geometry, there is, through any point P not on
a line L, exactly one line parallel to L. For el-
liptic (also Lobachevskian) geometry there is,
through any point P not on a line L, no line
parallel to L. For hyperbolic geometry there is,
through any point P not on a line L, more than
one (actually inﬁnitely many) lines parallel to
L.
Within the language of Riemannian geome-
try these three types of spaces are those of, re-
spectively, zero, positive, and negative constant
curvature. Models that exist within Euclidean
geometry are given by the following construc-
tions.
For elliptic geometry, the space is the
surface of a sphere and the lines are great cir-
cles on the sphere. We must regard antipodal
points on the sphere as being identiﬁed in order
that lines intersect in no more than one point.
For hyperbolic geometry, the space is the inte-
rior of a disk and the lines are arcs of circles
that intersect the boundary of the disk at right
angles or are straight lines through the center
of the disk. An alternative model is the upper
half plane (y > 0) and the lines are arcs of cir-
cles centered on the real axis or straight lines
orthogonal to the x-axis.
An important property of these geometries
concerns the sum of the angles of a triangle. In
Euclidean geometry, the sum of the angles of
any triangle must be exactly equal to π (that is
to say, a straight angle). In elliptic geometry the
sum of the angles is always greater than π while
in hyperbolic geometry the sum of the angles is
always less than π.
If the non-Euclidean plane is embedded in a
Euclidean space of sufﬁciently high dimension,
then it becomes possible to measure areas of re-
gions on the plane using the Euclidean measure
of area relative to the enveloping space. It was
shown by Gauss that the area of a triangle, so
measured, equals the difference between π and
the sum of the angles of the triangle.
hyperelliptic curve
An algebraic curve,
over a ground ﬁeld k, is deﬁned by an ir-
reducible polynomial F(X, Y) in the polyno-
mial ring k[X, Y].
Since F(X, Y) generates
a maximal ideal in k[X, Y], the factor ring
k[X, Y]/(F(X, Y)) = K is also a ﬁeld and con-
tains a canonical copy of k. If we denote the
canonical images of X and Y in K by x and
y, respectively, then K = k(x, y) is the ﬁeld
extension of k generated by x and y. The ﬁeld
K = k(x, y) is called the ﬁeld of algebraic func-
tions on the algebraic curve deﬁned by F(X, Y).
A hyperelliptic curve is an algebraic curve of the
special form Y 2 = P(X), where P(X) is a poly-
nomial that has no repeated roots.
It is also usually assumed that k is algebrai-
cally closed in K. That is to say, every element
of K that is not in k is transcendental over k.
When this is so, k is said to be the exact con-
stant ﬁeld for the curve.
hyperelliptic integral
Let F(X, Y) = Y 2 −
g(X) deﬁne a hyperelliptic curve over the ﬁeld
C of complex numbers, where the polynomial
g(X) is square free and of degree n. Let K =
C(z, w)bethefunctionﬁeldforthiscurve. Here,
z and w are the canonical images of X and Y in
theresidueclassﬁeldK = C[X, Y]/(F(X, Y)).
ThebranchpointsofthefunctionﬁeldKoverthe
projective line C(z) are the roots of g(X) and,
also, the point at inﬁnity, when n is odd. When
n is even, the point at inﬁnity is not a branch
point. We can, however, move one of the roots
of g(X) to ∞by a linear change of variable in
z. Thus there is no loss of generality in assum-
ing that n is odd. The Riemann surface X for
this curve has genus g = 1 −2 + 1
2(n + 1), ac-
cording to the standard formula for the genus in
case [K : C(z)] = 2 and there are n + 1 branch
points of index 2. According to the Riemann–
Roch Theorem, there are g linearly independent
holomorphic differential forms deﬁned on the
Riemann surface. A holomorphic differential
form is an expression of the form f (z)dz, such
that, if π denotes a local parameter at a point P
on the Riemann surface, then f (z) dz
dπ , which is
a member of K, has no pole at P. These are
commonly referred to as differentials of the ﬁrst
kind. Each of them gives rise to an Abelian inte-
gral that is deﬁned everywhere on the universal
coveringsurfacefortheRiemannsurface. These
are hyperelliptic integrals of the ﬁrst kind. They
are more commonly referred to as Abelian inte-
grals of the ﬁrst kind. For hyperelliptic curves,
c

these integrals can be given quite explicitly as

zr
√g(z)dz
for ≤r < g −1.
There are also differentials of the second and
third kinds.
Differentials of the second kind
have poles but the residue vanishes at each of
these poles. Differentials of the third kind pos-
sessatleastonepolewithanonvanishingresidue.
Since the sum of the residues is always zero,
there must be at least two poles for a differential
of the third kind. To each of these is associ-
ated an Abelian integral, which, in the case of
differentials of the second kind, is also deﬁned
on the entire universal covering surface for X
although it can have poles. For differentials of
the third kind, the singularities at points where
there are nonvanishing residues are logarithmic
singularities and are, thus, essential. The Abel-
ian integral associated with a differential of the
third kind is deﬁned everywhere on the univer-
sal covering surface for X, except on curves that
pass through points that lie above these singu-
larities.

hyperﬁnite factor
A factor of type II1 which

creasingsequence{An}∞
n=1 ofﬁnitedimensional

sequence {An}∞
n=1 may be assumed to be a sub-
factor of type I2n. Sometimes the term hyperﬁ-
nite refers both to the factors deﬁned above and
to factors of type In, where n < ∞.
hypergroup
A set S with an associative mul-
tiplication that assigns to any a and b in S a non-
empty subset ab of S, such that, for each a and
b in S, there exist elements x and y in S such
that b ∈ax and b ∈ya.
hypergroupoid
AsetS, withamultiplication
that associates every two elements a and b in S
with a nonempty subset ab of S.
hypersurface
A term with slightly different
meanings within algebraic geometry and analy-
sis:
(1) Algebraic Geometry: If X denotes afﬁne
n-space over a ﬁeld k, then any subvariety of
dimension n −1 is referred to as a hypersurface
in X. The hypersurface is deﬁned by a single ir-
reducible polynomial in n variables. This latter
fact is an expression of the algebraic fact that a
polynomial ring over a ﬁeld is a unique factor-
ization domain.
(2) Analysis: If X denotes a manifold of di-
mension n, then any n−1 dimensional subman-
ifold can be referred to as a hypersurface. In
many cases, the hypersurface can be represented
by a single relation f (x1, . . . , xn) = 0. How-
ever, due to the fact that the coordinate system
changes from point to point, the general deﬁni-
tion is necessarily more complicated.
hypo-Dirichlet algebra
A uniform algebra
A with some properties that occur in concrete
examples. Let ℜf be the real part of f and let
ℜ(A) = {ℜf : f ∈A}. LetCR(X)bethespace
of all continuous real-valued functions on X and
let log |A−1| = {log |f | : f, f −1 ∈A}. A uni-
form algebra A on a compact Hausdorff space
X is hypodirichlet on X if the uniform closure
of ℜ(A) has ﬁnite codimension in CR(X), and
the linear span of log |A−1| is dense in CR(X).
A uniform algebra A is hypodirichlet if it is hy-
podirichlet on its Shilov boundary.
The fun-
damental work on hypo-Dirichlet algebras was
done by Ahern and Sarason in 1966.

I
I-adic topology
A topology that endows a
ring (module) with the structure of a topological
ring (module). Let I be an ideal in a ring R and
let M be an R-module. The I-adic topology on
M is formed by taking the cosets x +I nM, x ∈
M, n a positive integer, as a base of open sets.
The I-adic topology on R is formed by letting
M = R.
icosahedral group
The group of rotations
of a regular icosahedron. It is a simple group
of order 60 and is isomorphic to the alternating
group of degree 5.
ideal
In any ring (usually associative with
identity), any subgroup J of the additive group
of R is called a left ideal if RJ ⊆J and is called
a right ideal if JR ⊆J and, if both of these
conditions hold, is called, simply, an ideal.
ideal class
Let R be an integral domain (com-
mutative ring with no divisors of zero). Two
ideals J and K are said to be linearly equivalent
if there exist nonzero elements a and b in R such
that aJ = bK. This establishes an equivalence
relation on the collection of all nonzero ideals
of R which we can write as J ≈K. Any equiv-
alence class under this relation is said to be an
ideal class.
These classes respect multiplication in the
sense that if J1 ≈J2 and K1 ≈K2, then J1J2 ≈
K1K2. In most cases, this notion is only applied
to the collection of invertible ideals of R. That is
to say, those ideals J for which there is another
ideal K such that JK is linearly equivalent to
the unit ideal R. For this case, the collection
of classes of invertible ideals forms an Abelian
group referred to as the ideal class group of the
ring.
Analternativeandmoremodernwayofdeﬁn-
ing this construction is contained in the notion
of fractional ideals. A fractional ideal of an in-
tegral domain R is a nonzero R-submodule F
of the quotient ﬁeld of R with the property that
aF ⊆R, for some nonzero a ∈R. This in-
cludes all ordinary nonzero ideals. A fractional
ideal is principal if it is of the form aR where
a is some nonzero member of K. A fractional
ideal F is invertible if there is another fractional
ideal G such that FG = R. The invertible frac-
tional ideals form an Abelian group under ordi-
nary multiplication and this group contains the
group of principal fractional ideals. The fac-
tor group is isomorphic to the ideal class group
deﬁned earlier.
ideal class group
The group of ideal classes
of invertible ideals of an integral domain R or,
equivalently, the group of invertible fractional
ideals of R, modulo the subgroup of principal
fractional ideals. See ideal class.
ideal class in the narrow sense
Let Ik be the
Abelian group consisting of the fractional ideals
of an algebraic number ﬁeld k. Let P +
k be the
subgroup of Ik consisting of all the principal
ideals generated by totally positive elements of
k. An ideal class of k in the narrow sense is a
coset of Ik modulo P +
k .
ideal group
Let K be an algebraic number
ﬁeld and let R be its ring of algebraic integers.
(1) The group of fractional R-ideals of K
forms an Abelian group called the ideal group
of K.
(2) Let m be an integral ideal and let Km =
{a/b : a, b ∈R, aR and bR relatively prime
to m}. Denote the group of all ideals of K that
are relatively prime to m by IK(m). Let m∗be
a formal product of m and a ﬁnite number of
real inﬁnite prime divisors of K, then m∗is an
integral divisor of K. For α ∈Km let α1 and α2
be elements of Km ∩R such that α = α1/α2.
Let S(m∗) be the group of all principal ideals
generated by elements α of Km such that α1 ≡
α2(mod m) and α ≡1(mod p) for all the real
inﬁnite prime divisors p included in the formal
product above. Any subgroup of IK(m) which
contains S(m∗) is called an ideal group modulo
m∗.
(3) Sometimes the deﬁnition given above is
called a congruence subgroup. In this case an
ideal group is an equivalence class of a congru-
ence subgroup under the following equivalence
relation.
Two congruence subgroups H1 and
c

H2, modulo m∗
1 and m∗
2, respectively, are said
to be equivalent if there is a modulus n∗such
that H1 ∩IK(n) = H2 ∩IK(n).
idele
Let K be a global ﬁeld. By this we
mean either an algebraic number ﬁeld (a ﬁnite
extension of the rational ﬁeld Q) or a ﬁeld of al-
gebraic functions in one variable over a ground
ﬁeld k (a ﬁnite separable extension K of the ﬁeld
k(x) of rational functions over the ground ﬁeld
k, such that k is itself algebraically closed in
K). These are also referred to as product for-
mula ﬁelds since each of these types possesses
a class of absolute values, which are real valued
functions, deﬁned on K with the properties that
|a| ≥0 for all a ∈K, |a| = 0 if and only if
a = 0 and |a + b| ≤|a| + |b|, for all a, b ∈K.
See also valuation.
Moreover this class of absolute values sat-
isﬁes, for each nonzero a ∈K, the relation

all ℘|a|℘= 1. Consider now the direct prod-
uct of copies of the multiplicative group K∗of
K, indexed by absolute values. That is to say,
functions from the set of absolute values to the
group K∗. We will denote such a function by a,
and its value at ℘by a℘. An idele is such a func-
tion with the additional property that |a℘| = 1,
for almost all ℘. Since each element of K∗gives
rise to such a function (a℘= a for all ℘) we
may regard K∗as a subgroup of the group of all
ideles. These are called principal ideles and the
factor group is called the idele class group of the
ﬁeld.

the category C. One of the axioms of category
theory is that every object in a category has a
(necessarily unique) identity morphism.
In most familiar categories, where objects
are sets with some additional structure and mor-
phisms are particular kinds of functions, the
identity morphism for an object A is simply the
identity function i; that is the function i such
that i(a) = a for all a ∈A. See also identity

(ii.) the projection, 'R, of ' in PSL2(R) is dense

'z = {γ ∈' : γ (z) = z}, where ' acts on H
via 'R. Let ˜P(') = {z ∈H : 'z ∼= Z} and let
P(') = ˜P(')/'. If Q ∈P(') is represented
by z ∈H and γ is a generator of 'z, then γ
is equivalent to a diagonal matrix in 'p whose
diagonal entries are λ and λ−1. Let deg(Q) be

imaginary axis in the complex plane
Com-
plex numbers x +iy, where x and y are real and
i =
√
−1, can be identiﬁed with the points of
the real plane with Cartesian coordinates (x, y).
The plane is then referred to as the complex
plane. The coordinate axis x = 0 is called the
imaginary axis. Similarly, the axis y = 0 is
referred to as the real axis.
imaginary number
Any member of the ﬁeld

a real number and i =

The ﬁeld of
complex numbers is the set of numbers of the
form x + iy, where x and y are real.
imaginary part of a complex number
If z =
x+iy is a complex number, then the real number
y is called the imaginary part of z, denoted y =
ℑz, and the real number x is called the real part
of z, denoted x = ℜz.
imaginary prime divisor
One of two types
of inﬁnite prime divisors on an algebraic number
ﬁeld K. Let a ∈K and let σ be any injection of
K into the complex number ﬁeld which does not
map K into the real number ﬁeld. The equiva-
lence class of an archimedean valuation on K,
given by v(a) = |σ(a)|2, is called an imaginary
(inﬁnite) prime divisor. See also real prime di-
visor, inﬁnite prime divisor.
imaginary quadratic ﬁeld
A ﬁeld K which
is a quadratic (degree two) extension of the ra-
tional number ﬁeld Q is called a quadratic num-
ber ﬁeld. Since K = Q(√m), for some square
free integer m, we may further distinguish these
ﬁelds according to whether m < 0 or m > 0.
In the ﬁrst case, the ﬁeld is called an imaginary
quadratic ﬁeld and, in the second, a real qua-
dratic ﬁeld.
imaginary root
A root of a polynomial f (z),
i.e., a number r such that f (r) = 0, which is an
imaginary number. See imaginary number.
imaginary unit
Any number ﬁeld K (ﬁnite
extension of the ﬁeld Q of rational numbers)
contains a ring of integers, denoted R. This ring
consists of all roots in K of monic irreducible
polynomials f (x) ∈Z[x], where Z is the ring
of rational integers. Alternatively, this ring is
the integral closure of Z in K. The units of R
are those elements u ∈R for which there is
an element v ∈R such that uv = 1. In an
isomorphic embedding of K into the ﬁeld of
complex numbers, if the image of a unit u is
imaginary, then u is called an imaginary unit.
Note that this depends on which embedding is
used.

Any ﬁeld that admits proper

p nor q is zero.
indeﬁnite quadratic form

over an ordered ﬁeld F, which represents both

the quadratic form is p + q where p and q are
uniquely determined by the quadratic form.
indeﬁnite sum
A concept analogous to the
indeﬁnite integral. Given a function f (x) and a
ﬁxed quantity ;x (;x ̸= 0), let F(x) be a func-
tion such that F(x + ;x) −F(x) = f (x) · ;x.
If c(x) is an arbitrary function, periodic, with
a period ;x, then F(x) + c(x) is an indeﬁnite
sum of f (x).
Independence Theorem
A corollary of the
Approximation Theorem. Let e1, e2, . . . , en be
real numbers and let v1, v2, . . . , vn be mutually
nonequivalent and nontrivial multiplicative val-
uations of a ﬁeld K. If 
i vi(a)ei = 1 for all
a ∈K\{0}, then ei = 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
independent linear equations
A system of
linear equations in which deleting any equation
would expand the solution set.
independent variable
A symbol that rep-
resents an arbitrary element in the domain of
a function. If the domain of the function is a
Cartesian product set X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn, then
the independent variable may be denoted (x1,
x2, . . . , xn), where each xi represents an arbi-
trary element in Xi. In addition, each xi is some-
times called an independent variable. See also
dependent variable.
indeterminate form
An expression of the
form 0/0, ∞/∞, 0·∞, ∞−∞, ∞0, 00, or 1∞.
Such expressions are undeﬁned. Indeterminate
forms may appear when a limit is improperly
evaluated as the quotient (product, etc.) of lim-
its and not the limit of a quotient (product, etc.).
But the term may properly appear when such
limits are classiﬁed, so that they can be evalu-
ated.
indeterminate system of equations
A sys-
tem of equations with an inﬁnite number of so-
lutions.
index
(1) Most commonly, a subscript which
is used to distinguish members of a set S. Thus,
in this sense, a function deﬁned on a set (called
the index set) and taking its values in the set S.
For example an inﬁnite sequence {a1, . . . , an} is
a set indexed by the natural numbers.
(2) There are many theorems in mathematics
thatarereferredtoas“indextheorems"andthese
generally describe properties of certain special
types of indices. For example, the index of a lin-
ear function T : X →Y between two complex
vector spaces is, by deﬁnition, dim ker(T )−dim
ker T ∗, where T ∗is the adjoint, or conjugate
transpose, of T . See also index of specialty.
index of eigenvalue
(1) The number
dim ker(A −λI) −dim ker

A∗−¯λI

,
where A is a square matrix (or a Fredholm lin-
ear operator on a Banach space), I is the identity
matrix of the same size as A, and A∗is the con-
jugate transpose (Banach space adjoint) of A.
(2) The order of the largest (Jordan) block
corresponding to λ in the Jordan normal form of
A. The index of λ is the smallest positive integer
m such that rank(A−λI)m = rank(A−λI)m+1.
index of specialty
Let D be a divisor on
a complete nonsingular curve over an algebrai-
cally closed ﬁeld k, and let K be a canonical di-
visor of X. The index of specialty of the divisor
D is dimkH 0(X, O(K −D)) =dimkH 2(X, O
(D)), where O (D) is the invertible sheaf associ-
ated with D. This deﬁnition also applies to divi-
sors on nonsingular surfaces. If D is a divisor on
acurveongenus g, thentheRiemann-RochThe-
orem may be applied to give a second formula
for the index of specialty. In this case, the spe-
cialty index of D is equal to g−degD+dim|D|,
where |D| is a complete linear system of D.
Index Theorem of Hodge
Let M be a com-
pact K¨ahler manifold of complex dimension 2n
and let hp,q denote the dimension of the space of
harmonic forms of type (p, q) on M. The signa-
ture of M is 
p,q(−1)php,q. The sum may be
restricted to the case where p + q is even since,
on a compact K¨ahler manifold, hp,q = hq,p.
Any complex, projective, nonsingular, algebraic
variety is a K¨ahler manifold, and the follow-
ing application of the Riemann-Roch Theorem
is also called the Hodge Index Theorem.
Let H be an ample divisor on a nonsingu-
lar projective surface X, and let D be a divisor
which has a nonzero intersection number with
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

some divisor E. If the intersection number of
D and H equals zero, then the self-intersection
number of D is less than zero. This implies that
the induced bilinear form on the Neron-Severi
group of X has only one positive eigenvalue, and
that the rest of the eigenvalues are negative.
induced module
An example of a scalar ex-
tension. Let K be a commutative ring, and let
G be a group with a subgroup H. The canonical
injection H →G induces a homomorphism of
group rings K[H] →K[G]. Let M be a K[H]
module. The induced module of M is the K[G]
module K[G] ⊗K[H] M. See also induced rep-
resentation.
induced representation
A representation of
a group G obtained by “extending” a representa-
tion of a subgroup H of G. Let K be a commu-
tative ring; the canonical injection H →G in-
ducesahomomorphismofgroupringsK[H] →
K[G]. Let M be a K[H]-module, the represen-
tation of G associated with the induced K[G]
module K[G]⊗K[H]M is the induced represen-
tation of G. It is also called the induced repre-
sentation of the representation of H associated
with M. See also induced module.
induced von Neumann algebra
Let M be a
vonNeumannalgebrawhichisa*-subalgebraof
the set of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert
space H. Let M′ be the set of operators that
commute with every A ∈M and with the ad-
joint of every A ∈M. If E is a projection
operator in M′, then the induced von Neumann
algebra of M on the subspace EH is the restric-
tion of EM E = EM to EH.
induction
The Principle of Induction is a the-
orem that concerns well-ordered sets. A well-
ordered set is a linearly ordered set in which
every nonempty subset has a smallest member.
The natural numbers are a primary example of
such a set. Other examples are the transﬁnite or-
dinal numbers. The principle of induction states
that if S is a well-ordered set and T is a subset
of S with the property: whenever {a ∈S : a <
b} ⊂T implies b ∈T , then we can conclude
that T = S. Indeed, the condition implies that
the smallest member of S is in T . If the comple-
ment of T were not empty, then it would have a
smallest member. Call this member b. This is
not the smallest member of S as we have seen.
However, T contains all a such that a < b, so it
must contain b as well which is a contradiction.
Certain well-ordered sets such as the natural
numbers have the property that every element
of S (aside from the smallest) has an immedi-
ate predecessor. The principle of induction for
such sets can be rephrased as follows: any sub-
set T ⊂S, such that (i.) T contains the smallest
element of S and (ii.) whenever T contains a
then it also contains the next smallest element
of S, then T = S. The proof is much the same
since the smallest member b of the complement
of T could not be the smallest member of S and,
therefore, would have an immediate predecessor
which is in T . Therefore, the immediate succes-
sor of b would also be in T which is, again, a
contradiction. In this form the principle is called
the principle of ﬁnite induction. Otherwise it is
referred to as transﬁnite induction.
This theorem is commonly applied as a meth-
od of proof for statements that can be indexed by
some well-ordered set. For example, the state-
ments P(n) : 1 + 2 + · · · + n = n(n+1)
2
are
indexed by the natural numbers. This can be
proved by ﬁnite induction. On the other hand,
a theorem such as the assertion that every ideal
J of a ring R is contained in a maximal ideal
requires (for most rings) transﬁnite induction.
For most proofs that involve transﬁnite in-
duction, the method is replaced by a logically
equivalent method called “Zorn’s Lemma” or,
simply, “Zorniﬁcation.” In order to be applied,
a basic axiom of mathematics itself (called the
“Axiom of Choice") must be assumed. This has
a number of formulations but the one of interest
here is the one that asserts that all sets possess a
well ordering. It can then be shown that every
partially ordered set has a maximal chain (sim-
ply ordered subset). As an example, the class
of proper ideals that contain a given ideal J of a
ring R is a partially ordered set under ordinary
set inclusion. By Zorn’s Lemma there is a max-
imal chain of these and the union of the member
of such a chain is a maximal and proper ideal (it
does not contain the identity element) of R.
The fact that this sort of argument is logically
equivalent to one using transﬁnite induction is
not particularly trivial to prove. Both types of
arguments circulated in mathematics for many
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

years until it was realized just in this century that
they were equivalent.
inequality
An expression that involves mem-
bers of some partially ordered set, commonly
taking the form a < b or a ≤b. The so-called
triangle inequality involving real numbers is an
example and it asserts that |a + b| ≤|a| + |b|,
for all real numbers a, b.
inequality relation
Let ≤denote a relation
on a set S (i.e., a ≤b, whenever (a, b) belongs
to the relation). (See relation.) If it is true that
(i.) a ≤a for all a ∈S, (ii.) if a ≤b and
b ≤a then a = b, and (iii.) if a ≤b and b ≤c
then a ≤c, then the relation is called a partial
ordering or inequality relation. Extensions of
this are the linear ordering, which is a partial
ordering satisfying property (iv.) for all a, b ∈
S, a ≤b or b ≤a, and the well ordering which
is a linear ordering in which every nonempty
subset of S has a smallest member.
inertia ﬁeld
A valuation ring R in a ﬁeld K
has the property that it has exactly one maximal
ideal. (See valuation ring.) When this ideal is
principal, then every other nonzero ideal of R is
a power of this ideal. Thus, a discrete valuation
ring is a unique factorization domain in which
there is only one irreducible element. If L is
a ﬁnite extension ﬁeld of K (usually assumed
to be separable), then the integral closure S of
the discrete valuation ring R in L has the prop-
erty that it is the intersection of a ﬁnite set of
discrete valuation rings of L and, equivalently,
is a unique factorization domain with only a ﬁ-
nite number of irreducible elements. The orig-
inal maximal ideal of R, which is πR, has the
property that π can be factored in S in the form
π = u r
j=1 πe−j
j
, where u is a unit of S and the
elementsπj runovertheﬁnitesetofdistinctirre-
ducible elements of S. Let Sj denote the discrete
valuation ring that is associated with the element
πj. There are then three indices associated with
this construction. The number r, above, is the
decomposition index, the numbers e1, . . . , er
are the ramiﬁcation numbers, and the numbers
fj = [Sj/πjSj : R/πR] are the residue class
degrees.
When the ﬁeld extensions that give
rise to the residue class degrees are not separa-
ble, then certain adjustments have to be made
in these deﬁnitions. If L is a Galois extension
of K with Galois group G, it can be shown that
e = e1 = · · · = er and f = f1 = · · · = fr,
so, in this case, [L : K] = ef r. Now, for each
j, there is a subgroup Gj of G consisting of
those automorphisms σ of L over K that have
the property that (πjS)σ = πjS. It is easily
shown that the Gj form a complete conjugacy
class in G. These are called decomposition sub-
groups. Let Zj denote the intermediate ﬁeld that
is associated with Gj under the Galois corre-
spondence. The ﬁelds Zj form a complete class
ofconjugatesubﬁelds. Intheimportantcasethat
G is Abelian, all of the Zj coincide. The ﬁelds
Zj are called decomposition ﬁelds. Now, the
residue class ﬁelds Sj/πjSj = S/πjS are also
Galois over R/πR and there is a natural homo-
morphism of Gj onto the Galois group of this
extension. The kernel is a normal subgroup Hj
of index f in Gj. The subgroups Hj are called
inertial subgroups. The subﬁelds Tj associated
with Hj are called inertial ﬁelds. The inertial
groups Hj are members of a complete conju-
gacy class as are the inertial ﬁelds Tj. Note that
we have a chain of ﬁelds K ⊆Zj ⊆Tj ⊆L
with the relative degrees [L : Tj] = e, [Tj :
Zj] = f , and [Zj : K] = r. There is a further
reﬁnement of the ﬁeld extension Tj ⊆L into a
chain of intermediate ﬁelds called ramiﬁcation
ﬁelds and these are the ﬁelds that are associated
with subgroups of Gj that leave various powers
of πjS invariant.
inertia group
(1) Let K/k be a ﬁnite Galois
extension of ﬁelds and let G be its Galois group.
If R is the ring of integers of K and P is a prime
ideal of R, then the inertia group of P over k
is {σ ∈G : P σ = P and aσ ≡a(modP) for
all a ∈R}. This group is a subgroup of the
decomposition group of P.
(2) Let k be a local ﬁeld, K a normal exten-
sion of ﬁnite degree, and G be the Galois group
of K/k. Let P be the valuation ideal of K and
let p be a generator of P. The inertia group is
{σ ∈G : pσ ≡p(modP)}.
inertia of (Hermitian) matrix
The ordered
triple
i(A) = (i+(A), i−(A), i0(A)) ,
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

where i+(A), i−(A), i0(A) are, respectively, the
number of positive, negative, and zero eigenval-
ues (counting multiplicities), of a given Hermi-
tian matrix A.
Sylvester’s Law of Inertia states that two Her-
mitian matrices A and B satisfy i(A) = i(B) if
and only if there exists a nonsingular matrix C
such that A = CBC∗.
The notion of inertia can be extended to ar-
bitrary square matrices with complex entries,
where i+(A), i−(A), i0(A) are, respectively, the
numbers of eigenvalues with positive, negative,
and zero real part.
inﬁmum
The greatest lower bound or meet
of a set of elements of a lattice. The term is most
frequently used with regard to sets of real num-
bers. If A is a set of real numbers, the inﬁmum of
A is the unique real number b = inf A deﬁned
by the following two conditions: (i.) x ≥b for
all x ∈A; (ii.) if x ≥c for all x ∈A, then b ≥c.
The inﬁmum of a set of real numbers A may not
exist, that is there may be no real number b sat-
isfying conditions (i.) and (ii.) above, but if A is
bounded from below, the inﬁmum of A is guar-
anteed to exist. This fact is one of the several
equivalent forms of the completeness property
of the set of real numbers. See meet. See also
supremum.
inﬁnite continued fraction
An expression
of the form
a0 +
b1
a1 +
b2

.
Inﬁnite continued fractions may be used to ap-
proximate an irrational number.
inﬁnite Galois extension
Let K be a sub-
ﬁeld of the ﬁeld L and assume that L is an al-
gebraic extension of K. L is a Galois extension
if it is a normal, separable, algebraic extension
of K. (See normal extension, separable exten-
sion, algebraicextension.) Lissaidtobenormal
over K if, whenever an irreducible polynomial
P(x) ∈K[x] has a root in L, then P(x) splits
into linear factors in L[x]. Those of nonﬁnite
degree are inﬁnite Galois extensions. Alterna-
tively, the Galois group of L over K has the
property that its ﬁxed ﬁeld is precisely K. (See
Galois group.) The ﬁxed ﬁeld is the subﬁeld of
L that is left elementwise ﬁxed by the Galois
group.
inﬁnite height
(1) An element a in an Abel-
ian p-group A is said to have inﬁnite height if
the equation pky = a is solvable in A for every
nonnegative integer k.
(2) A prime ideal p is said to have inﬁnite
height if there exist chains of prime ideals p0 <
p1 < p2 < · · · < ph−1 < p with arbitrarily
large h. If p is a prime ideal in a Noetherian
ring R, and p ̸= R, then p does not have inﬁnite
height.
inﬁnite matrix
A matrix with an inﬁnite
number of rows and an inﬁnite number of col-
umns. Such a matrix may be inﬁnite in only two
directions, as (aij), i, j = 0, 1, 2, . . . :

inﬂation
A map of cohomology groups in-
duced by lifting the cocycles of a factor group
G/H to G. Let G be a group, M a G-module,
H a normal subgroup of G, MH = {m ∈M :
hm = m, for all h ∈H}, π the canonical epi-
morphism from G to G/H, and i : MH →M
the inclusion map. The inﬂation map is the map
of cohomology groups
inf =(π, i)∗: H n 

(for n ≥1), which is achieved by lifting the

A point on a plane curve at
which the curve switches from being concave to
convex, relative to a ﬁxed line; a non-singular
point P on a plane curve C such that the tan-
gent line to C at P has intersection multiplicity
greater than or equal to 3. See also intersection
multiplicity.
inhomogeneous difference equation
A lin-
ear difference equation of the form
a0yk+n + a1yk+n−1 + · · · + anyk = rk ,
where rk differs from 0 for some values of k. In
the opposite case where rk is identically equal
to 0, the linear difference equation is homoge-
neous.
These notions are directly analogous
to the corresponding ones for linear differential
equations.
inhomogeneous polarization
(1) The alge-
braic equivalence class of a nondegenerate divi-
sor on an Abelian variety.
(2) Let X be a proper scheme over an algebra-
ically closed ﬁeld k and let Pic(X) be the Picard
group of X. Let Picτ(X) be the subgroup of
Pic(X) consisting of the set of all the invertible
sheaves F on X, for which there exists a non-
zero integer n, such that F n represents a point of
the Picard scheme of X in the same component
as the identity. A coset of Picτ(X) in Pic(X)
consisting of ample invertible sheaves is called
an inhomogeneous polarization of X.
injection
A function i : A →B such that
i(a1) ̸= i(a2) whenever a1 ̸= a2. Injections
are also called injective functions, injective map-
pings, one-to-one functions, and univalent func-
tions. The notion of an injection generalizes to
the notion of a monomorphism or monic mor-
phism in a category. See monomorphism. See
also epimorphism, surjection.
injective class
A class of objects in a cate-
gory, each member of which is injective. The
word “class” is used here rather than “set” be-
cause we cannot talk about the set of all injec-
tive objects in most categories without running
into the sort of logical difﬁculties, for example
Russell’s paradox, connected with the “set of all
sets.”
injective dimension
A left R module B,
where R is a ring with unit, has injective di-
mension n if there is an injective resolution
0 −→B −→E0 −→· · · −→En −→0 ,
but no shorter injective resolution of B. The
deﬁnition of the injective dimension of a right
R module is entirely similar. See injective res-
olution. See also ﬂat dimension, projective di-
mension.
Injective dimensions have little to do with
more elementary notions of dimension, such as
the dimension of a vector space, but they are
related to a famous theorem called “Hilbert’s
Theorem on Syzygies.” Suppose the ring R is
commutative. Deﬁne the global dimension of
R to be the largest injective dimension of any
R module, or ∞if there is no largest dimen-
sion. Let D(R) denote the global dimension of
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

R, and let R[x] be the ring of polynomials in x
with coefﬁcients in R. Then in modern termi-
nology, Hilbert’s Theorem on Syzygies states
that D(R[x]) = D(R) + 1. See also syzygy.
injective envelope
An object E in a cate-
gory C is the injective envelope of an object A
if it has the following three properties: (i.) E
is an injective object, (ii.) there is a monomor-
phism i : A →E, and (iii.) there is no injective
object properly between A and E. In a gen-
eral category, this means that if j : A →E′
and k : E′ →E are monomorphisms and E′
is injective, then k is actually an isomorphism.
See also injective object, monomorphism, pro-
jective cover.
In most familiar categories, objects are sets
with structure (for example, groups, topological
spaces, etc.), morphisms are particular kinds of
functions (for example, group homomorphisms,
continuous functions, etc.), and monomor-
phisms are one-to-one functions of a particu-
lar kind. In these categories, property (iii.) can
be phrased in terms of ordinary set containment.
For example, in the category of topological
spaces and continuous functions, property (iii.)
reduces to the assertion that there is no injective
topological space containing A as a topological
subspace, and contained in E as a topological
subspace, except for E itself.
injective mapping
See injection.
injective module
An injective object in the
category of left R modules and left R module
homomorphisms, where R is a ring with unit.
Symmetrically, an injective object in the cate-
gory of right R modules and right R module
homomorphisms. See injective object. See also
ﬂat module, projective module, projective ob-
ject.
In the important case where the ring R is a
principal ideal domain, the injective R modules
are just the divisible ones. (An R module M is
divisible if for each element m ∈M and each
r ∈R, there exists mr ∈R such that rmr = m.)
Thus, for example, the rational numbers, Q, are
an injective Z module, where Z is the ring of
integers. See also ﬂat module, injective object,
projective module, projective object.
injective object
An object I in a category C
satisfying the following mapping property: If i :
B →C is a monomorphism in the category, and
f : B →I is a morphism in the category, then
there exists a (usually not unique) morphism g :
C →I in the category such that g ◦i = f .
This is summarized in the following “universal
mapping diagram”:
B
i
−→
C
f ↘
↙∃g
I
See also injective module, monomorphism, pro-
jective module, projective object.
In most familiar categories, objects are sets
with structure (for example, groups, Banach
spaces, etc.), and morphisms are particular
kinds of functions (for example group homo-
morphisms, bounded linear transformations of
norm ≤1, etc.), so monomorphisms are one-
to-one functions (injections) of particular kinds.
Here are two examples of injective objects in
speciﬁc categories: (1) In the category of Abel-
ian groups and group homomorphisms, the in-
jective objects are just those Abelian groups
which are divisible. (An Abelian group G is
divisible if for each g ∈G and each integer
n, there exists a group element gn ∈G such
that ngn = g.) Thus, for example, the rational
numbers Q are an injective object in this cat-
egory. (2) The Hahn-Banach Theorem asserts
that the ﬁeld of complex numbers, thought of as
a one-dimensional complex Banach space, is an
injective object in the category of complex Ba-
nach spaces and bounded linear transformations
of norm ≤1.
injective resolution
Let B be a left R mod-
ule, where R is a ring with unit. An injective
resolution of B is an exact sequence,
0 −→B
φ0

φ1

where every Ei is an injective left R module.
There is a companion notion for right R mod-
ules. Injective resolutions are extremely impor-
tant in homological algebra and enter into the
dimension theory of rings and modules.
See
also ﬂat resolution, injective dimension, injec-
tive module, projective resolution.

An exact sequence is a sequence of left R
modules, such as the one above, where every
φi is a left R module homomorphism (the φi are
called“connectinghomomorphisms”), suchthat
Im(φi) = Ker(φi+1). Here Im(φi) is the image
of φi, and Ker(φi+1) is the kernel of φi+1. In
the particular case above, because the sequence
begins with 0, it is understood that the kernel
of φ0 is 0, that is φ0 is one-to-one. There is a
companion notion for right R modules.
inner automorphism
A group automor-
phism of the form φa(g) = aga−1. In more
detail, an automorphism of a group G is a one-
to-one mapping of G onto itself which preserves
the group operation, φ(g1g2) = φ(g1)φ(g2) for
all g1 and g2 in G. If a is a ﬁxed element of G,
the mapping φa deﬁned above is easily seen to
be an automorphism. Automorphisms of this
form are rather special and form a group under
composition called the group of inner automor-
phisms of G.
inner derivation
A derivation of the form
Da(x) = xa −ax. In more detail, a deriva-
tion is a linear mapping D of a (possibly non-
associative) algebra A into itself, satisfying the
familiar product rule for derivatives, D(xy) =
D(x)y + xD(y). Thus, derivations are alge-
braic generalizations of the derivatives of calcu-
lus. Now let A be associative. If a is a ﬁxed
element of A, the mapping Da deﬁned above is
easily seen to be a derivation. Derivations of
this form are rather special, and are called inner
derivations.
The concept extends to Lie algebras, but in
this case inner derivations are derivations of the
form Da(x) = [x a], where [x a] is the Lie prod-
uct.
inner topology
The topology of a Lie sub-
group H, as a submanifold of a Lie group G.
This topology need not be the relative topol-
ogy of H, viewed as a subspace of a topological
space G.
inseparable element
An element of an ex-
tension ﬁeld with an inseparable minimal poly-
nomial. In more detail, let G be an extension
of a ﬁeld F. (This means that G is a ﬁeld and
G ⊇F.) Let α be an algebraic element of G
over F. (This means that α satisﬁes a polyno-
mial equation P(α) = 0 with coefﬁcients in F.)
Among all polynomials P with coefﬁcients in
F such that P(α) = 0, there is one of smallest
positive degree, called the minimal polynomial
of α. The algebraic element α is inseparable if
its minimal polynomial is inseparable. See also
inseparable polynomial. Antonym: separable
element.
Inseparable elements can only occur if the
ﬁeld F has characteristic n ̸= 0. In particular,
inseparable elements can never occur if F is the
ﬁeld of rational numbers, or an extension of the
rationals. See also inseparable extension.
inseparable extension
An algebraic exten-
sion ﬁeld containing an inseparable element.
See inseparable element. Antonym: separable
extension.
inseparablepolynomial
Anirreduciblepoly-
nomial with coefﬁcients in a ﬁeld which factors
over its splitting ﬁeld with repeated factors or,
more generally, a polynomial which has an in-
separable polynomial among its irreducible fac-
tors.
In more detail, let F be a ﬁeld and let P be a
polynomial of positive degree with coefﬁcients
in F. P may or may not factor into linear factors
over F (for example, x2 −2 does not factor over
the rationals), but there always exists a smallest
extension ﬁeld of F over which P does factor
(for example, x2−2 factors as (x−
√
2)(x+
√
2)
over the ﬁeld G formed by adjoining
√
2 to the
rationals). This smallest extension ﬁeld is called
the splitting ﬁeld for P.
Let F[x] denote the ring of polynomials with
coefﬁcients in F. Suppose ﬁrst that P is irre-
ducible in F[x], that is P does not factor into
two or more polynomials in F[x] of positive de-
gree. P is called separable if its factorization
over its splitting ﬁeld has no repeated factors. In
the general case where P is not irreducible, P
is called separable if each irreducible factor is
separable. Finally, P is called inseparable if it
is not separable. Antonym: separable polyno-
mial.
integer
(1) Intuitively, an integer is one of the
signed whole numbers 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, . . . , and
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

a natural number is one of the counting num-
bers, 1, 2, 3, . . . .
(2) Semi-formally, the ring of integers is the
set Z consisting of the signed whole numbers,
together with the ordinary operations of addi-
tion, +, and multiplication, ·. The ring of in-
tegers forms the motivating example for many
of the concepts of mathematics. For example,
the ring of integers, (Z, +, ·), satisﬁes the fol-
lowing properties for all x, y, and z ∈Z: (1)
x + y ∈Z. (2) x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z.
(3) x + 0 = 0 + x, (4) given x, there exists an
element −x such that x + −x = −x + x = 0.
These are precisely the axioms for a group, so
theintegersunderaddition, (Z, +), formtheﬁrst
example of a group. Furthermore, addition is
commutative, (5) x + y = y + x. Properties
(1) through (5) are precisely the axioms for an
Abelian group, so the integers under addition
form the ﬁrst example of an Abelian group. In
addition, the integers satisfy the following ad-
ditional properties for all x, y, and z ∈Z: (6)
x · y ∈Z. (7) x · (y + z) = x · y + x · z,
and (y + z) · x = y · x + z · z. Properties (1)
through (7) are precisely the axioms for a ring,
so the ring of integers, (Z, +, ·), form the ﬁrst,
and one of the best, examples of a ring. Further-
more, the integers satisfy (8) 1 · x = x · 1 = x.
The number 1 is called a unit element because
it satisﬁes this identity, so the ring of integers
forms one of the best examples of a ring with
unit element, or ring with unit for short. In ad-
dition, the ring of integers satisﬁes the commu-
tative law, (9) x · y = y · x, so it forms one of
the best examples of a commutative ring.
The ring of integers has a far richer structure
than described above. For example, the ring of
integers is an integral domain, or domain for
short, because it satisﬁes property (10) x ·y = 0
implies x = 0 or y = 0 (or both). Thus, the
ring of integers satisﬁes the familiar cancella-
tion law: If we know x · y = x · z for x ̸= 0,
then we know y = z. Finally, the integers form
one of the best examples of a Euclidean domain,
and of a principal ideal domain. See also Abel-
ian group, commutative ring, Euclidean domain,
principal ideal domain, ring, unit element.
Many of the most profound open (unsolved)
questions in mathematics revolve around the in-
tegers. For example, a prime number is a (pos-
itive) integer divisible only by itself and 1. Eu-
clid proved centuries ago that there are inﬁnitely
many prime numbers. But it is still unknown
whether there are inﬁnitely many pairs of prime
numbers, pn and pn+1, which differ by 2, i.e.,
pn+1 −pn = 2. The conjecture that there are
inﬁnitely many such pairs of primes is called
the twin prime conjecture. Perhaps the deepest
and most important unsolved question in math-
ematics is the Riemann hypothesis. Although
the Riemann hypothesis is stated in terms of the
behavior of a certain analytic function called the
Riemann zeta function, it too involves the prop-
erties of the integers at its heart. For example, if
the Riemann hypothesis were true, then the twin
prime conjecture (and most of the other great un-
solved conjectures of number theory) would be
true.
(3) Formally, an integer is an element of the
ringofintegers. Theringofintegers isthesmall-
est ring containing the semi-ring of natural num-
bers. The semi-ring of natural numbers is de-
ﬁned in terms of the set of natural numbers. The
set of natural numbers is any set N, together with
a successor function S carrying N to N, satisfy-
ing the Peano postulates:
(1) There is an element 1 ∈N.
(2) S : N →N is a function, that is the
following two properties hold: (a) given n ∈N,
there is only one element S(n), and (b) for each
n ∈N, S(n) ∈N.
(3) For each n ∈N, S(n) ̸= 1.
(4) S is a one-to-one function, that is if S(m)
= S(n) then m = n.
(5) (The axiom of induction) Suppose I is a
subset of N satisfying the following two prop-
erties: (a) 1 ∈I, and (b) if i ∈I then S(i) ∈I.
Then I = N.
Addition and multiplication, + and ·, are de-
ﬁned inductively in terms of the successor func-
tion S, so that S(n) = n + 1, and the semi-ring
of natural numbers is deﬁned to be the set of
natural numbers N, together with the operations
of + and ·.
Mathematical logic shows us that there are
fundamentally different models of the natural
numbers, and thus of the ring of integers. (A
model of the natural numbers is simply a par-
ticular set N and successor function S satisfying
the Peano postulates.) For example, if we begin
bybelievingweunderstandaparticularmodelof
the natural numbers, and call this object (N, S),
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

then it is possible to construct out of our pre-
existing (N, S) a new object (N∗, S∗) with the
following remarkable properties:
(1) (N∗, S∗) also satisﬁes the Peano postu-
lates, and thus equally deserves to be called “the
natural numbers.”
(2) Every n ∈N also belongs to N∗.
(3) If n ∈N, then S∗(n) = S(n).
(4) There exist elements of N∗larger than any
element of N. (These elements of N∗are called
“inﬁnite elements” of N∗.)
Warning to the reader: One also has to rede-
ﬁne what one means by set and subset for this
to work. Otherwise, (4) could not be true and
(N∗, S∗) would simply equal (N, S).
This construction forms the basis of Abra-
ham Robinson’s non-standard analysis, and re-
lated constructions lie at the heart of the Gödel
undecideability theorem.
(4) Other usage: In algebraic number theory,
algebraic integers are frequently called integers,
and then ordinary integers are called rational
integers. An algebraic integer is an element α
of an extension ﬁeld of the rationals which is
integral over the rational integers. See integral
element.
integer programming
The general linear
programming problem asks for the maximum
value of a linear function L of n variables, sub-
ject to linear constraints. In other words, the
problem is to maximize L(x1, x2, . . . , xn) sub-
ject to the conditions AX ≤B, where X is the
column vector formed from x1, . . . , xn, B is a
column vector, and A is a matrix. The general
integer programming problem is the same, ex-
cept the solution (x1, . . . , xn) is to consist of
integers.
Integer programming problems frequently
arise in applications, and many important com-
binatorial problems, such as the travelling sales-
man problem, are equivalent to integer pro-
gramming problems. The formal statement of
this equivalence is that integer programming
is one of a class of hardest possible problems
solvable quickly by inspired guessing; in other
words, integer programming is NP complete.
(Technically, the NP complete problem is the
one of determining whether an integer vector
(x1, . . . , xn) exists, subject to the constraints
and making L(x1, . . . , xn) > a predetermined
constant K.) There are several efﬁcient solu-
tion methods for particular classes of integer
programming problems, but it is unlikely that
there is an efﬁcient solution method for all in-
teger programming problems, since this would
imply NP = P, a conjecture widely believed
to be false.
integrable family of unitary representations
Let G be a topological group. A unitary rep-
resentation of G is a group homomorphism L
from G into the group of unitary operators on
a Hilbert space H, which is continuous in the
following sense: For each ﬁxed h1 and h2 in H,
the function g )→(L(g)h1, h2) is continuous.
Here, (L(g)h1, h2) denotes the inner product of
L(g)h1 and h2 in the Hilbert space H. (In other
words, L is a continuous map from G into the
set of unitary operators endowed with the weak
operator topology.) See unitary representation.
In the theory of unitary representations, it is
frequently desirable to express a given unitary
representation L as a direct integral or integral
direct sum of simpler unitary representations,
L =

X
l(x) dµ(x)
where X is a set and µ is a measure on X, or,
more precisely, where X is a set, B is a σ-ﬁeld
of subsets of X, and µ is a measure on B. See
integral direct sum. Here, l(x) is a unitary rep-
resentation of G for each x ∈X. If L′ is another
unitary representation of G, and if L′ can also
be represented as a direct integral,
L′ =

X
l′(x) dµ(x) ,
and if l′(x) is unitarily equivalent to l(x) except
possibly on a set of µ measure 0, then L′ is uni-
tarily equivalent to L. In other words, direct
integrals preserve the relation of unitary equiv-
alence. See unitary equivalence.
This leads to the consideration of functions
from X into the set E of unitary equivalence
classes of unitary representations of G. (Here,
two representations are equivalent if they are
unitarily equivalent.) Such a function L is said
to be an integrable family of unitary represen-
tations, or an integrable unitary representation
for short, if the following holds: There is a func-
tion l deﬁned on X such that (1) l(x) is a unitary
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

representation in the equivalence class L(x) for
each x ∈X, and (2) for each pair of elements
h1 and h2 in the Hilbert space H, and group ele-
ment g ∈G, the function x )→⟨l(x)(g)h1, h2⟩
is µ measurable.
An integrable family of unitary representa-
tions, L, and any of its associated functions, l,
are exactly what is needed to form a new unitary
representation via the direct integral,
L =

X
l(x) dµ(x) .
Because of the aforementioned preservation of
unitary equivalence, one may write
L =

X
L dµ(x)
instead.

integral
(1) Of or pertaining to the integers,
as in such phrases as “integral exponent,” i.e.,
an exponent which is an integer.
(2) In calculus, the anti-derivative of a con-
tinuous, real-valued function. In more detail, let
f be a continuous real-valued function deﬁned
on the closed interval [a, b]. Let F be a func-
tion deﬁned on [a, b] such that F ′(x) = f (x)
for all x in the interval [a, b]. F is called an
anti-derivative of f , or an indeﬁnite integral of
f , and is denoted by

f (x) dx. The number
F(b) −F(a) is called the deﬁnite integral of f
over the interval [a, b], or the deﬁnite integral
of f from a to b, and is denoted by
 b
a f (x) dx.
By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, if
f (x) ≥0 for all x in [a, b], the deﬁnite integral
of f over the interval [a, b] is equal to the area
under the curve y = f (x), a ≤x ≤b.
There is a sequence of rigorous and increas-
ingly general deﬁnitions of the integral. In order
of increasing generality, they are
(i.) The Riemann integral. Let a = x0 ≤
x1 ≤· · · ≤xn = b be a partition of [a, b].
Choose intermediate points t1, t2, . . . , tn so that
x0 ≤t1 ≤x1, x1 ≤t2 ≤x2, . . . , xn−1 ≤tn ≤
xn. The sum, n
1 f (ti)(xi −xi−1) is called a
Riemann sum. The Riemann integral of f over
the interval [a, b] is deﬁned to be
 b
a
f (x) dx =
lim
|xi−xi−1|→0
n

i=1
f (ti)
(xi −xi−1) ;
in other words, the Riemann integral is deﬁned
as the limit of Riemann sums. It is non-trivial to
prove that the limit exists and is independent of
the particular choice of intermediate points ti.
(ii.) There are several variants of this deﬁni-
tion. In the most common one, f (ti) is replaced
by the supremum (least upper bound) of f on
the interval [xi−1, xi] to obtain the upper sum
U(f, P), and by the inﬁmum (greatest lower
bound) of f on [xi−1, xi] to obtain the lower
sum L(f, P). (Here, P refers to the partition
a = x0 ≤x1 ≤. . . ≤xn = b.) The upper and
lower integrals of f are
 b
a
f (x) dx = inf
P U(f, P)
and
 b
a
f (x) dx = sup
P
L(f, P) .
(Here, inf stands for inﬁmum and sup for supre-
mum. See inﬁmum, supremum.) The function
f is deﬁned to be Riemann integrable if the up-
per and lower integrals of f are equal, and their
common value is called the Riemann integral
of f over the interval [a, b]. It is a theorem
that all continuous functions are Riemann inte-
grable. This deﬁnition has the advantage that
it extends the class of integrable functions be-
yond the continuous ones. It is a theorem that
a bounded function f is Riemann integrable if
and only if it is continuous almost everywhere.
(iii.)
Deﬁnitions (i.)
and (ii.)
generalize
from intervals [a, b] to suitable regions in higher
dimensions.
(iv.) TheStieltjesintegral. Everythingisasin
(ii.), except that xi −xi−1 is replaced by α(xi)−
α(xi−1) in the deﬁnition of upper and lower
sums, where α is a monotone increasing (and
possible discontinuous) function. The Stieltjes
integral of f is denoted by
 b
a f (x) dα(x). The
Stieltjes integral is more general than the Rie-
mann integral, not in that the class of integrable
functions is enlarged, but rather in that the class
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

of things we can integrate against (the functions
α) is enlarged.
(v.) The Lebesgue integral. Let µ be a count-
ably additive set function on a σ-ﬁeld of sets.
The set function µ is called a measure.
See
sigma ﬁeld, measure. Examples are:
(a) X is a ﬁnite set, and if A is a subset of X,
then µ(A) = the number of elements in A. µ is
called counting measure on X.
(b) X is any set, ﬁnite or inﬁnite. The σ-ﬁeld
of sets is the set of all subsets of X. Let a be
a ﬁxed point of X. If A is a subset of X, then
µ(A) = 1 if a ∈A, and µ(A) = 0 otherwise.
µ is called a point mass at a, or the Dirac delta
measure at a.
(c) X is the interval [a, b]. The σ-ﬁeld of sets
is the set of Borel subsets of X. (The Borel sets
include all subintervals, whether open or closed,
of [a, b], and many other sets besides.) If I is
an interval, then µ(I) is the length of I. µ is
called Lebesgue measure on [a, b].
(d) X and the σ-ﬁeld are as in (c). Let α be
a monotone increasing function on [a, b], and
for convenience suppose it is continuous from
the right. If I = (x1, x2] is a right half closed
subinterval of X, then µ(I) = α(x2)−α(x1). µ
is called a Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure on [a, b].
(e) X is an open subset of n-dimensional Eu-
clidean space, Rn. The σ-ﬁeld is the σ-ﬁeld of
Borel subsets of X. If C is a small n-dimen-
sional cube contained in X, then µ(C) is the
n-dimensional volume of C. (In the familiar
case n = 2, an n-dimensional cube is simply a
square, and the n-dimensional volume is simply
the area of the square. In the equally familiar
case n = 3, an n-dimensional cube is an ordi-
nary 3-dimensional cube, and the n-dimensional
volume is the ordinary 3-dimensional volume of
the cube.)
A simple function on X is a function which
takes only ﬁnitely many values. If g is a sim-
ple function taking values c1, . . . , cn on the sets
A1, . . . , An (so c1, . . . , cn exhaust the ﬁnite
set of values of taken by g) and Ai = {x ∈
X, g(x) = ci}, then

X
g(x) dµ(x) =
n

i=1
ciµ (Ai) .
(This assumes, of course, that the Ai belong to
the σ-ﬁeld, i.e., that the µ(Ai) are deﬁned. Such
a simple function is called measurable.) Now
suppose f is a bounded function on X. Deﬁne
the upper integral of f on X as

X
f (x) dµ(x) = inf
g∈G

X
g(x) dµ(x) ,
where G equals the set of measurable simple
functions g such that g ≥f . Deﬁne the lower
integral of f on X similarly,

X
f (x) dµ(x) = sup
h∈H

X
h(x) dx ,
where H equals the set of measurable simple
functions h such that h ≤f .
The bounded
function f is Lebesgue integrable, or simply in-
tegrable, if the upper and lower integrals agree,
and then their common value is called the
Lebesgue integral of f with respect to the mea-
sure µ, or simply the integral of f with respect
to the measure µ, and is denoted by

X f (x) dx.
The Lebesgue integral extends both the class
of integrable functions (all the way to bounded
measurable functions), and the class of things
we can integrate against (arbitrary measures).
The theory extends to unbounded functions as
well.
(vi.)
The Denjoy integral.
Similar to the
Lebesgue integral, except that the upper inte-
gral is deﬁned as the inﬁmum of the integrals of
an appropriate family of lower semi-continuous
functions, and the lower integral is deﬁned as the
supremum of a family of upper semi-continuous
functions. Seealsolowersemi-continuousfunc-
tion, upper semi-continuous function.
The Denjoy integral requires extra structure
on X, X must be a topological space, and the
measure µ must be a Radon measure. However,
the Denjoy integral is particularly well suited for
dealing with certain technical difﬁculties con-
nected with the integration of functions taking
values in a non-separable topological vector
space.
(vii.) Deﬁnition (i.) of the Riemann integral
easily extends to continuous vector valued func-
tions f taking values in a complete topological
vector space. The analogous deﬁnition for the
Stieltjes integral also extends to this setting. See
also topological vector space.
(viii.)
The Pettis integral, also called the
Dunford Pettis integral. Let f be a vector valued
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

function, and let µ be a measure on a space X,
as in (v.) or (vi.). Suppose f takes values in a
locally convex topological vector space V . The
Pettis integral of f is deﬁned by the conditions,

X
f (x) dµ(x), λ

=

X
(f (x), λ) dµ(x) ,
for all λ ∈V ∗.
Here, V ∗is the dual of V ,
consisting of all continuous linear functionals on
V . Of course, this presupposes that the scalar
valued functions (f (x), λ) are integrable, and
that the inﬁnite system of equations,
(e, λ) =

X
(f (x), λ) dµ(x), λ ∈E∗,
has a solution e ∈V . See also locally convex
topological space.
(ix.) The deﬁnition of the Stieltjes integral
extends to vector valued measures and scalar
valued functions, and even to operator valued
measuresandvectorvaluedfunctions. TheSpec-
tral Theorem is phrased in terms of such an in-
tegral. See also Spectral Theorem.
(x.) Recently, a seemingly minor variant of
the classical Riemann integral has been discov-
ered which has all the power of the Lebesgue
integral and more. This new integral is variously
named the Henstock integral, the Kurzweil-
Henstock integral, or the generalized Riemann
integral. The Henstock integral is deﬁned in
terms of gauges. Deﬁne a gauge to be a func-
tion γ which assigns to each point x of the in-
terval [a, b] a neighborhood of x. (The neigh-
borhood may be an open interval containing x,
half open if x is one of the endpoints a or b.)
Let a = x0 < x1 < · · · < xn = b be a partition
of [a, b] with intermediate points t1, t2, . . . , tn,
as in the deﬁnition of the classical Riemann in-
tegral.
Refer to such a partition as a tagged
partition, with the intermediate points ti as the
tags. Deﬁne a tagged partition to be γ ﬁne if
[xi−1, xi] ⊆γ (ti) for each i.
If f is a real
valued function on [a, b], deﬁne the Henstock
integral of f to be the (necessarily unique) real
number L such that for each ϵ > 0, there is a
gauge γ such that
L −

f (ti) (xi −xi−1)
 < ϵ ,
foreachgamma ﬁnetaggedpartition. Ofcourse,
the Henstock integral of f is still denoted by
 b
a
f (x) dx .
If f is positive, then Henstock integrabil-
ity and Lebesgue integrability coincide, and the
Henstock integral of f equals the Lebesgue in-
tegral of f . But if f varies in sign, and |f |
is not Henstock (and thus not Lebesgue) inte-
grable, then the Henstock integral of f may still
exist, even though the Lebesgue integral of f
cannot exist under these circumstances. Thus,
the Henstock integral is more general than the
Lebesgue integral. The Henstock integral ob-
tains its added power because it captures cancel-
lation phenomena related to improper integrals
that the Lebesgue integral cannot.
The Henstock integral extends to a Henstock-
Stieltjes integral in a rather simple way. Hen-
stock integration also extends to functions of
several variables. However, Henstock integra-
tion on subsets of n-dimensional space, Rn, is
still an open area of investigation, as is the exten-
sion of the Henstock integral to abstract settings
similar to measure spaces.

X
H(x) dµ(x) .

ear transformation T between two integral direct
sums,

X
H1(x) dµ(x)
and

X
H2(x) dµ(x) ,
as an integral of bounded linear transformations
t(x). In more detail, let H1(x) and H2(x), x ∈
X, be two families of Hilbert spaces indexed by
X as in (1) above, and let t(x), x ∈X be a family
of linear transformations from H1(x) to H2(x)
indexed by X. If f lies in

X H1(x) dµ(x), de-
ﬁne T (f ) by T (f )(x) = t(x)(f (x)), except
possibly on a set of µ measure 0. (Of course, the
domain of T will be all of

X H1(x) dµ(x), that
is, T (f ) will lie in

X H2(x) dµ(x), only when
the family t(x), x ∈X is uniformly bounded,
except possibly on a set of µ measure 0, that is
only when there is a constant K independent of x
such that the norm ∥t(x)∥≤K, except possibly
on a set of µ measure 0. In this case, the oper-
ator T will be bounded, with norm ≤K.) The
linear transformation T is called the integral di-
rect sum, or a direct integral of the family t(x),
x ∈X, and is frequently denoted by

X
t(x) dµ(x) .
integral divisor
(1) In elementary algebra
and arithmetic, a factor or divisor which is an
integer, asin, forexample, 3isanintegraldivisor
of 12.
(2) In algebraic geometry, a divisor with pos-
itive coefﬁcients. In more detail, let X be an
algebraic variety. (This simply means that X is
the solution set to a system of polynomial equa-
tions. See algebraic variety.) A divisor on X is a
formal sum D = a1C1 + · · · + akCk, where the
ai are integers and the Ci are distinct irreducible
subvarieties of X of codimension 1. (Codimen-
sion 1 means the dimension of Ci is one less than
the dimension of X. Irreducible means Ci is not
the union of two proper [i.e., strictly smaller]
subvarieties. In the simplest case where X is
an algebraic curve, the Ci are just points of X.)
The divisor D is integral if all the coefﬁcients
ai are positive. Integral divisors are also called
positive divisors or effective divisors.
The notions of divisor and integral divisor
extend to various related and/or more general
contexts, for example to the situation where X
is an analytic variety. See analytic variety.
Perhaps the clearest examples of integral di-
visors occur in elementary algebra and elemen-
tary complex analysis. Consider a polynomial
or analytic function f deﬁned in the complex
plane. Let C1, C2, C3, . . . be a listing of the
zeros of f . The corresponding integral divisor
D = a1C1 + a2C2 + a3C3 + · · · describes the
zeros of f , counting multiplicity, and one con-
siders such divisors repeatedly in these subjects,
for example in the statement that a polynomial
of degree n has exactly n zeroes counting multi-
plicity. Inelementaryalgebraandcomplexanal-
ysis, integral divisors are often called “sets with
multiplicity,” and one thinks of the coefﬁcient
ak as meaning that the point Ck is to be counted
as belonging to the set ak times.
integral domain
A commutative ring R with
the property that ab = 0 implies a = 0 or b = 0.
Here, a and b are elements of R. For example,
the ring of integers is an integral domain.
integral element
Let S be a commutative
ring with unit, and let R be a subring of S. An
element α ∈S is integral over R if α is the
solution to a polynomial equation P(α) = 0,
where the polynomial P has coefﬁcients in R
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

and leading coefﬁcient 1. (Such a polynomial is
called a monic polynomial. For example, x2 +5
is monic, but 2x2 + 5 is not monic.)
The most important application of the con-
cept of an integral element lies in algebraic num-
ber theory, where an element of an extension
ﬁeld of the rational numbers which is integral
over the ring of integers is called an algebraic
integer, or often just an integer. In this case,
ordinary integers are often called rational inte-
gers.
If both R and S are ﬁelds, an integral element
is called an algebraic element.
integral equivalence
(1) For modules, Z-
equivalence. Here Z is the ring of integers. See
R-equivalence, Z-equivalence.
(2) For matrices, two matrices M1 and M2
are integrally equivalent if there is an invertible
matrix P , such that both P and P −1 have integer
entries and M2 = P tM1P. Here, P t denotes the
transpose of P .
(3) For quadratic forms, two quadratic forms
Q1(x) = xtM1x and Q2(x) = xtM2x are in-
tegrally equivalent if the matrices M1 and M2
are integrally equivalent. In other words, Q1
and Q2 are integrally equivalent if each can be
transformed to the other by a matrix with integer
entries.
integral extension
A commutative ring S
with unit and containing a subring R is an in-
tegral extension of R if every element of S is
integral over R. See integral element.
In the important special case where R and
S are ﬁelds, an integral extension is called an
algebraic extension.
The classic example of an integral extension
is the ring S of algebraic integers in some al-
gebraic extension ﬁeld of the rational numbers.
Here, the ring R is the ring of ordinary (i.e., ra-
tional) integers. See algebraic integer, integral
element.
If S is an integral domain, there is an im-
portant relationship between being an integral
extension and possessing certain ﬁniteness con-
ditions. Speciﬁcally, an integral domain is an
integral extension of a subring R if and only if
S is module ﬁnite over R. Module ﬁnite sim-
ply means that S is ﬁnitely generated as an R
module. See also integral domain.
integral form
(1) A form, usually a bilinear,
sesquilinear, or quadratic form, with integral co-
efﬁcients. For example, the form 2x2−xy+3y2
is integral.
(2) A form, usually a bilinear, sesquilinear, or
quadratic form, expressed by means of integrals.
For example, the inner product on the Hilbert
space L2 of square integrable functions,
(f, g) =

X
f (t)g(t) dµ(t) ,
is an integral (sesquilinear) form.
integral ideal
A non-zero ideal of the ring R
ofalgebraicintegersinanalgebraicnumberﬁeld
F. See algebraic integer, algebraic extension,
ideal. See also integer, integral element, integral
extension. In the elementary case where F is
the ﬁeld of rational numbers and R is the ring
of ordinary integers, an integral ideal is simply
a non-zero ideal of the ring of integers.
In algebraic number theory, a distinction is
drawn between fractional ideals and integral
ideals. An integral ideal is as deﬁned above.
By contrast, a fractional ideal is an R module
lying in the algebraic number ﬁeld F.
integrally closed
Let A be a subring of a
ring C. Then the set of elements of C which are
integral over A is called the integral closure of
A in C. If A is equal to its integral closure, then
A is said to be integrally closed.
integral quotient
In elementary arithmetic,
a quotient in which both the numerator and the
denominator are integers. For example, 3/4 is
anintegralquotient, whereas3.5/4.5isnot, even
though the latter represents (equals) the rational
number 7/9.
integralrepresentation
(1)Arepresentation
of a group G is a homomorphism φ from G into
a group Mn of n × n matrices. The representa-
tion is integral if each matrix φ(g) has integer
entries.
(2)Anyrepresentationofaquantitybymeans
of integrals. See integral.
integral ringed space
A ringed space is a
topological space X together with a sheaf of
rings OX on X. This means that to each open
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

set U of X, there is associated a ring OX(U).
(The remaining properties of sheaves need not
concern us here.) The ringed space (X, OX)
is integral if each ring OX(U) is an integral do-
main. For example, if X is an open subset of Cn,
complex n-space, or a complex analytic mani-
fold, and OX(U) is the ring of analytic functions
deﬁned on U, then (X, OX) is an integral ringed
space. See integral domain.
integral scheme
A scheme is a particular
sort of ringed space. See scheme. An integral
scheme is a scheme which is an integral ringed
space. See integral ringed space.
intermediate ﬁeld
Let F, G, and H be ﬁelds,
with F ⊆G ⊆H. G is called an intermediate
ﬁeld.
internal product
Let G1 and G2 be Abel-
ian groups, and let R be a commutative ring. A
group homomorphism π : G1 ⊗G2 →(R, +),
where (R, +) is the underlying additive group
of R, is an internal product if it satisﬁes π(g1 ⊗
g2) = π(g1) · π(g2), where · is the multiplica-
tion in the ring R. Here, G1 ⊗G2 is the tensor
product of G1 and G2. The notion is most fre-
quently used in homological algebra, in which
case π becomes a homomorphism of chain com-
plexes of groups, and the relation π(g1 ⊗g2) =
π(g1) · π(g2) only has to hold for cycles (or co-
cycles). See also chain complex, cocycle, cycle,
tensor product.
internal symmetry
A symmetry that is an
invertible mapping of a set onto itself. If the set
has additional structure, then the mapping and
its inverse must preserve that structure. For ex-
ample, if the set is in addition a differentiable
manifold, then the mapping (and automatically
its inverse) must be differentiable. If the set is
in addition a topological space, then the map-
ping and its inverse must both be continuous.
If the set is in addition a metric space, then the
mapping (and automatically its inverse) must be
an isometry. See also inverse function, inverse
mapping.
interpolating subset
Let H be a set of func-
tions from a set X to a set Y. Let a1, a2, a3, . . .
be a ﬁnite or inﬁnite sequence of elements of
X, and let y1, y2, y3, . . . be a ﬁnite or inﬁ-
nite sequence of elements of Y. The set A =
{a1, a2, a3, . . . } is an H interpolating subset
for the sequence y1, y2, y3, . . . if there exists
a function h ∈H such that h(a1) = y1 for
i = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
In this case, the sequence
a1, a2, a3, . . . is called an H interpolating se-
quence for y1, y2, y3, . . . .
The classic examples of interpolating se-
quences occur in the case where X is the ﬁeld
of complex numbers and H is the set of all
polynomials with complex coefﬁcients. The La-
grange interpolation theorem asserts that any ﬁ-
nite sequence of complex numbers, a1, . . . , an,
all terms of which are different, is an H inter-
polating sequence for any sequence y1, . . . , yn
of complex numbers with the same number of
terms.
Although the notion of an interpolating sub-
set is usually reserved for discrete sets A as
above, it makes sense in greater generality. Let
A be an arbitrary subset of X, and let f be a
function from A to Y. Then A is an H interpo-
lating subset for the function f if there exists a
function h ∈H such that h(a) = f (a) for all
a ∈A.
intersection multiplicity
A variety V is the
set of common zeros of a set I of polynomials.
In other words, V = {(x1, . . . , xn) : P(x1, . . . ,
xn) = 0 for all P ∈I}. Intuitively, the inter-
section multiplicity of varieties V1, . . . , Vn at a
point x = (x1, . . . , xn) where they intersect is
the degree of tangency (or order of contact) of
the intersection at x plus 1. For example, the
parabolas
x2 −x2
1 = 0 and x2 −x2
1 −x1 = 0
have intersection multiplicity 1 at (x1, x2) =
(0, 0) because they intersect transversally (are
not tangent to each other) there. However,
x2 −x2
1 = 0 and x2 −5x2
1 = 0
have intersection multiplicity 2 at (x1, x2) =
(0, 0) because they intersect tangentially to ﬁrst
order there. One must also include the possibil-
ity of x being a multiple point, in which case the
intersection multiplicity should be ≥the order
of the multiple point.
Rigorously, if D1, . . . , Dn are effective divi-
sors on a smooth n-dimensional variety X and
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

are in general position at a point x ∈X, then the
intersection multiplicity of D1, . . . , Dn at x is
(D1, . . . , Dn)x = dim (Ox/ (f1, . . . , fn)) .
Here is what all this means: X is smooth if it has
no singular points. A divisor on X is a formal
sum D = a1C1+· · ·+akCk, where the ai are in-
tegers and the Ci are distinct irreducible subva-
rieties of X of codimension n −1. (Irreducible
means Ci is not the union of two proper [i.e.,
strictly smaller] subvarieties.
In the simplest
case where X is an algebraic curve, the Ci are
just points of X.) The divisor D is effective (also
called integral or positive) if all the coefﬁcients
ai are positive. Ox is the local ring of X at x.
The local ring of X at x consists of quotients of
polynomial functions, f/g, deﬁnedatandnear x
(i.e., on an open subset of X containing x) where
g(x) ̸= 0, and two such functions are identiﬁed
if they agree on an open subset containing x. (In
other words, Ox is the ring of terms of regular
functions at x.) Locally, each divisor Di is the
divisor of a function fi, and that is where the fi
come from. (f1, . . . , fn) is the ideal in Ox gen-
erated by f1, . . . , fn (by their terms actually).
The quotient ring Ox/(f1, . . . , fn) is not only a
ring but also a ﬁnite dimensional vector space.
The intersection multiplicity (D1, . . . , Dn) is
the dimension of this vector space. See general
position, term, integral divisor, quotient ring.
The intersection multiplicity of effective di-
visors not in general position at x is deﬁned in
terms of the intersection multiplicity of equiva-
lent divisors which are in general position. The
intersection multiplicity of fewer than n effec-
tive divisors, say D1, . . . , Dk, is deﬁned in
terms of module length rather than the less gen-
eral concept of vector space dimension. Let C
be one of the irreducible components of the va-
riety  Ci,j, where Di =  ai,jCi,j. Then the
intersection multiplicity of D1, . . . , Dk in the
component C is
(D1, . . . , Dk)C = ℓ(OC/ (f1, . . . , fk))
where ℓ(OC/(f1, . . . , fk)) is the module length
of the OC module OC/(f1, . . . , fk) and OC is
the local ring of the irreducible subvariety C.
See also local ring, module of ﬁnite length.
intersection number
A variety V is the set of
commonzerosofasetI ofpolynomials. Inother
words, V = {(x1, . . . , xn) : P(x1, . . . , xn) = 0
for all P ∈I}.
Intuitively, the intersection
number of varieties V1, . . . , Vn is the number
of points of intersection, counting multiplicity.
Rigorously, if D1, . . . , Dn are effective divisors
on a smooth n-dimensional variety X (see in-
tersection multiplicity for brief deﬁnitions of
these terms), then the intersection number of
D1, . . . , Dn is
(D1, . . . , Dn) =

x∈S
(D1, . . . , Dn)x ,
in other words, it is the sum of the intersection
multiplicities over the ﬁnitely many points of
intersection of the divisors D1, . . . , Dn. Here,
S = n
i=1 Si, Si = 
j Ci,j, and Di = 
j ai,j
Cj.
It is also possible to deﬁne intersection num-
bers for fewer than n divisors, say D1, . . . , Dk.
However, this deﬁnition is the culmination of an
entire theory.
intersection product
(1) Let i(A, B; C) be
the intersection multiplicity of two irreducible
subvarieties A and B of an irreducible variety
V , along a proper component C of A ∩B. The
intersection product of A and B is
A · B =

n
i(A, B; Cn)Cn
where the sum is taken over all the proper com-
ponents Cn of A ∩B. If X = 
α aαAα and
Y = 
β bβBβ are two cycles on V such that
each component Aα of X intersects properly

(2) If M is an oriented n-dimensional mani-
fold and a and b are members of the homology
groups Hp(M) and Hq(M), then the intersec-
tion product of Lefschetz is a · b = D−1a ⌢
b = D(D−1a ⌣D−1b) ∈Hp+q−n where D is
the Poincar´e-Lefschetz duality. See also inter-
section multiplicity, cup product, cap product,
Poincaré-Lefschetz duality.
intransitive permutation group
A permu-
tation group G is a group of one-to-one and onto
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

functions from a set X to itself. The group oper-
ation is understood to be a composition of func-
tions, τσ(x) = τ ◦σ(x) = τ(σ(x)). Usually,
but not always, the set X is ﬁnite. The permu-
tation group G is intransitive if for some (and
hence for all) x ∈X, the set O(x) = {σ(x) :
σ ∈G} is not equal to all of X. The set O(x) is
called the orbit of x, so we can say the permu-
tation group G is intransitive if the orbit of any
element x ∈X fails to be all of X. Synonym:
intransitive transformation group. Antonyms:
transitive permutation group, transitive trans-
formation group.
invariance
As in ordinary non-technical En-
glish, the property of being unchanged with re-
spect to some action or set of actions.
invariant
(1) Let L be a set. Let G be an-
other set which acts on L. This means that there
is a binary operation · so that g · l is an element
of L for each g ∈G and l ∈L. Usually, but not
always, G is a group. An element l ∈L is in-
variant under the action of G, or a G invariant,
if g · l = l for each g ∈G.
Here are some examples:
Example (a): Let G be a group of functions
from a set X to itself. Each g ∈G is assumed to
be one-to-one and onto, and the group operation
is a composition of functions, g1g2(x) = g1 ◦
g2(x) = g1(g2(x)). Let L be a set of functions
from X to some set Y. The action of G on L is
deﬁned via a composition of functions: g · l =
l ◦g, i.e. g · l(x) = l(g(x)).
Example (b): Let G equal the symmetric
group on n letters.
In other words, G is the
permutation group of all permutations (one-to-
one and onto functions) of the set {1, . . . , n}.
The group operation is a composition of func-
tions. Let L be the ring of all polynomials in n
variables, x1, . . . , xn. If g ∈G, and l is a mono-
mial xk1
1 · · · xkn
n , then g · l = xk1
g(1) · · · xkn
g(n). In
other words, g · l is formed from l by rearrang-
ing the variables. If l is an arbitrary polynomial,
then l is a sum of monomials, l =  aili. De-
ﬁne g · l by linearity, g · l =  aig · li. The
polynomials which are invariant under the ac-
tion of g are called symmetric functions. Thus,
the symmetric functions are those polynomials
which remain unchanged after rearranging their
variables.
It is a theorem that each symmet-
ric function is a sum of elementary symmetric
functions, p1 = 1, p2 = the sum of all pairs of
variables, p2 = x2
1 + x1x2 + · · · + x1xn + x2
2 +
x2x3 + . . . + x2xn + · · · + x2
n, p3 = the sum of
all triples of variables, pn = x1x2 · · · xn.
Example (c): this is an important special case
of example (a). G is a group of conformal trans-
formationsoftheunitdisk(inthecomplexplane)
into itself. (Thus, G is a group of linear frac-
tional transformations.) X is the unit disk, and
L is the set of analytic functions deﬁned on the
unit disk. A function in L which is invariant
under the action of G is called an automorphic
function. See conformal transformation, linear
fractional transformation.
Example (d): Let G be an Abelian group. Let
K be a ﬁeld and KG the group algebra over K.
Let L be a left KG module. Deﬁne the action
of G by module multiplication, g · l = gl. In
the theory of group representations, the set of all
l ∈L which are invariant under the action of G
are called the G-invariants of L. The set of all
G-invariants of L forms a left KG submodule of
L which plays a key role in the theory of group
representations. See also group algebra.
(2) Let G and L be as in (1). A subset V of
L is invariant under the action of G if g ·v ∈V
for all v ∈V . Here is an important example:
Let T be a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert
space H. Let G = {T }, the set consisting of
T alone. Let L = H. Deﬁne the action of
G on L by operator application, T · l = T (l).
A subspace of L which is invariant under the
action of G is called an invariant subspace for
T . A famous unsolved problem is the invari-
ant subspace problem, often called the invariant
subspace conjecture: Does every bounded lin-
ear operator on an inﬁnite dimensional complex
Hilbert space H have a proper (not {0}, not all
of H) closed invariant subspace?
(3) A bilinear form f on a Lie algebra L is
called an invariant form if f ([a c], b) +
f (a, [b c]) = 0. Here, [a c] is the Lie algebra
product of a and c.
(4) A quantity which is left unchanged un-
der the action of a prescribed class of functions
between sets is also called an invariant. For ex-
ample, the Euler characteristic is a topological
invariant because it is preserved under topolog-
ical homeomorphisms. (A one-to-one and onto
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

function from one topological space to another
is called a homeomorphism if both it and its in-
verse are continuous.)
(5) Let X be a set and let E be an equivalence
relation on the set X. Let f : X →Y be a
function from X to another set Y. If f (x1) =
f (x2) whenever (x1, x2) ∈E, that is whenever
x1 is equivalent to x2 modulo the equivalence
relation E, then f is called an invariant of E.
The function f is called a complete invariant of
E if (x1, x2) ∈E if and only if f (x1) = f (x2).
Finally, a ﬁnite or inﬁnite set F of functions on
X is called a complete system of invariants for
E if (x1, x2) ∈E if and only if f (x1) = f (x2)
for all functions f ∈F.
Here is a well-known example: Let X be the
set of all m × n matrices with coefﬁcients in a
ﬁeld F. Deﬁne two such matrices M1 and M2
to be equivalent if there exist invertible square
matrices P and Q such that M1 = PM2Q, and
let E be the resulting equivalence relation. It
is a theorem of linear algebra that the rank of a
matrix M is a complete invariant for E, that is
m×n matrices M1 and M2 are equivalent under
the above deﬁnition if and only if they have the
same rank.
invariant derivation
Let D be a derivation
on the function ﬁeld K(A) of an Abelian variety
A, where K is the universal domain of A. Let Ta
be translation by an element a ∈A. If (Df ) ◦
Ta = D(f ◦Ta), for every f ∈K(A), then D
is called an invariant derivation on A.
invariant element
Let T : X →X be a
function or mapping. If x ∈X has the property
that T (x) = x, then x is called an invariant
element of the operator T . This concept arises
in analysis, topology, algebra, and many other
branches of mathematics.
invariant element
Let T : X →X be a
function or mapping. If x ∈X has the property
that T (x) = x, then x is called an invariant
element of the operator T . This concept arises
in analysis, topology, algebra, and many other
branches of mathematics.
invariant factor
Let A be an n × n matrix
with distinct eigenvalues λi, , i = 1, 2, . . . , k,
and Jordan normal form J. Consider the ma-
trix B1, obtained from J by taking the direct
sum of k Jordan blocks, one for each distinct
eigenvalue λi, having maximal order among all
Jordan blocks corresponding to λi. Next con-
sider B2, obtained similarly to B1, but from the
remaining Jordan blocks in J. Continue in this
manner until all Jordan blocks of J have been
used, thus obtaining a sequence B1, B2, . . . , Bs
of matrices whose sizes are non-increasing and
whose direct sum is by construction permuta-
tionally similar to J.
The characteristic polynomials of the matri-
ces Bj, j = 1, 2, . . . , s are known as the in-
variant factors of A. It is worth noting that for
each j = 1, 2, . . . , s, by construction, the char-
acteristic polynomial of Bj coincides with the
minimal polynomial of Bj. In particular, the
minimal polynomial of B1 is the minimal poly-
nomial of A. It follows that two matrices are
similar if and only if they have the same invari-
ant factors.
invariant ﬁeld
Let G be a group of ﬁeld au-
tomorphisms of a ﬁeld F. A subﬁeld H of F
is invariant for G, or G-invariant, if g(h) = h
for all g ∈G and h ∈H; in other words, the
subﬁeld H is G-invariant if G ﬁxes the elements
of H. Synonym: ﬁxed ﬁeld.
invariant form
(1) A bilinear or quadratic
form which is invariant under the action of a set
of transformations. See invariant.
(2) A bilinear form f on a Lie algebra L such
that f ([a c], b) + f (a, [b c]) = 0. Here, [a c]
is the Lie algebra product of a and c.
invariant of group
Let G be a ﬁnite Abelian
group. By the Fundamental Theorem of Abelian
Groups,
G = σ (m1) ⊕σ(m2) ⊕· · · ⊕σ(ms) ,
where σ(mi) is a cyclic group of order mi and
mi divides mi+1. The numbers m1, m2, . . . , ms
are uniquely determined by G, are invariant un-
der group isomorphism, and are called the in-
variants of the group G.
invariant of weight w
Let R be a ring and let
L be a left R module. Let G be a set which acts
on L. This means there is a binary operation ·
so that g · l is an element of L for each g ∈G
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

and l ∈L. Usually, G is a group. Let w be a
function from G to R. An element l ∈L is an
invariant of weight w under the action of G, or
a G invariant of weight w, if g · l = w(g)l for
each g ∈G.
Here is an example: Let L be the set of all
analytic functions in the upper half plane of the
complex plane. Let G be the modular group.
The modular group is the group of all linear
fractional transformations
g(z) = az + b
cz + d ,
where a, b, c, and d are integers and the determi-
nant ad −bc = 1. G acts on L by composition
of functions,
g · l(z) = l ◦g(z) = l(g(z)) = l
az + b
cz + d

.
A modular form of weight k is a G invariant of
weight w, where w(g) = (cz + d)k. In other
words, l is a modular form of weight k if l ∈L

There is a companion notion of weight for
right R modules. Furthermore, the notion of a
G invariant of weight w extends to the situation
where R and L are simply sets, and R acts on
L.
inverse
Let G be a set with a binary operation
· and an identity e. This means g1 · g2 ∈G
whenever g1 and g2 belong to G, and g · e =
e · g = g for all g ∈G. The element h ∈G is
an inverse of g ∈G if g · h = e and h · g = e.
Often g is an element of a group G. What is
very special about this case is that (a) either of
the conditions gh = e and hg = e implies the
other, and (b) the inverse of g always exists and
is uniquely determined by g. The inverse of g is
frequently denoted by g−1. See group. See also
inverse function, inverse morphism.
inverse element
An element of a set G which
is the inverse of another element of G. See in-
verse.
inverse function
Let f be a function from a
set X to a set Y. Diagrammatically, f : X →
Y. The inverse function to f , if it exists, is the
function g : Y →X such that f ◦g = iY and
g ◦f = iX. (Here, iX and iY are the identity
maps on X and Y, and ◦denotes composition
of functions.)
In other words, f (g(y)) = y
for all y ∈Y, and g(f (x)) = x for all x ∈
X. The function f has an inverse if and only if
f is one-to-one and onto, and the inverse g is
deﬁned by g(y) = the unique element x such
that f (x) = y. The inverse function to f is
frequently denoted by f −1. See also identity
map, inverse mapping, inverse morphism.
Example: Let f (x) = 10x, for x real. The
inverse function to f is g(x) = log10 x, for x >
0.
inverse limit
Suppose {Gµ}µ∈I is an indexed
family of Abelian groups, where I is a pre-
ordered set. Suppose that there is also a family
of homomorphisms ϕµν : Gµ →Gν, deﬁned
for all µ < ν, such that if µ < ν < κ, then
ϕνκ ◦ϕµν = ϕµκ. Consider the direct product
of the groups Gµ and deﬁne πµ to be the pro-
jection onto the µth factor in this direct product.
Then the inverse limit is deﬁned to be the sub-
group G∞= {x : µ < ν implies πµ(x) =
ϕνµ ◦πν(x)}. See also preordered set.
inverse mapping
See inverse function.
inverse matrix
The matrix B, if it exists,
such that AB = BA = I. In more detail, let A
be a square n × n matrix, and let I be the n × n
identity matrix, that is the n × n matrix with en-
try 1 in each diagonal position and 0 elsewhere.
An n×n matrix B is the inverse of A if AB = I
and BA = I. Either condition implies the other.
The inverse of A, if it exists, is uniquely deter-
mined by A and is denoted by A−1. It is a the-
orem of linear algebra that a matrix is invertible
(i.e., has an inverse) if and only if its determi-
nant is non-zero. There is a determinantal (in-
volving determinants) formula for the inverse of
A, A−1 = det(A)−1adj(A), where det(A) is the
determinant of A and adj(A) is the classical ad-
joint of A, that is the transpose of the matrix of
cofactors. See cofactor, determinant, transpose.

inverse morphism
Let C be a category, let A
and B be objects in C, and let f : A →B be a
morphism in C. (A morphism is a generalization
of a function or mapping.)
A morphism g :
B →A is the inverse morphism of f if f ◦g
is the identity morphism on object B, and g ◦
f is the identity morphism on object A. The
inverse morphism of f , if it exists, is uniquely
determined by f .
There are also notions of left and right in-
verse morphisms. Morphism g is a left inverse
morphism of f if g ◦f is the identity morphism
on object A, and is a right inverse morphism of
f if f ◦g is the identity morphism on B. See
also identity morphism, inverse function.
inverse operation
See inverse function.
inverse proportion
Quantity a is inversely
proportional to quantity b, or varies inversely
with quantity b, if there is a constant k different
from 0 such that a = k/b. For example, New-
ton’s law of universal gravitation, “The grav-
itational force between two masses is directly
proportional to the product of the masses and
inversely proportional to the square of the dis-
tance between them,” is given by the formula
F = GmM/r2, where G is a constant of nature
called the gravitational constant.
inverse ratio
(1) The inverse ratio to a/b is
b/a.
(2) Inverse ratio also means inverse propor-
tion, as in “a varies in inverse ratio to b.” See
inverse proportion.
inverse relation
The relation formed by re-
versing the ordered pairs in a given relation. In
more detail, a relation R is a subset of the Carte-
sian product X × Y, where X and Y are sets.
(The Cartesian product X × Y of X and Y is
simply the set of all ordered pairs (x, y), where
x ∈X and y ∈Y.) The inverse relation to R is
the relation {(y, x) : (x, y) ∈R}. The inverse
relation to R is usually denoted by R−1. Note
that if the relation R is a subset of the Cartesian
product X×Y, then the inverse relation R−1 is a
subset of Y ×X. Example: An inverse function
is a special sort of inverse relation. See inverse
function.
inverse transformation
See inverse func-
tion.
inverse trigonometric function
The inverse
functions to the trigonometric functions sin, cos,
tan, cot, sec, and csc; that is, the arcsin, the arc-
cosine, the arctangent, the arccotangent, the arc-
secant, and the arccosecant, respectively. They
are denoted by arcsin, arccos, arctan, arccot,
arcsec, and arccsc, or by sin−1, cos−1, tan−1,
cot−1, sec−1, and csc−1. Note that, in formulas
involving trigonometric functions and inverse
trigonometric functions, sin−1(x) is not equal
to the number 1/ sin(x), but rather to the value
of the arcsin of x. Similar comments apply to
cos−1(x), etc.
Because the trigonometric functions sin, cos,
etc.arenotone-to-one, theinversetrigonometric
functions are really inverse relations, although
they may be thought of as multiple valued func-
tions. Thus arcsin(x) is any angle y such that
sin(y)
=
x,
and similarly with arccos
(x), etc.
To make the inverse trigonometric
functions into single valued functions, one must
specify a branch or, equivalently, an interval in
which the trigonometric function is one-to-one.
For example, the principal branch of the arcsin
is the inverse of sin(x) restricted to the inter-
val −π
2 ≤y ≤π
2 ; it is denoted by Arcsin or
Sin−1, with a capital letter. Thus Arcsin(x) is
the unique angle y in the interval −π
2 ≤y ≤π
2
such that sin(y) = x. The principal branches
of the other inverse trigonometric functions are
alsodenotedbycapitalletters, Arccos = Cos−1,
Arctan = Tan−1, etc.
The principal branch
of the arctan takes values in the same interval
as the principal branch of the arcsin, namely
−π
2 ≤y ≤π
2 , but the principal branch of the
arccos takes values in the interval 0 ≤y ≤π.
inverse variation
See inverse proportion.

inversion formula
Any of a number of for-
mulas for computing the inverse of a quantity.
The two most celebrated probably are:
(i.) the inversion formula for computing the in-
verse of a matrix, A−1 = det(A)−1adj(A),
where det(A) is the determinant of A and adj(A)

of the matrix of cofactors. See inverse matrix.

invertible element
(1) An element with an
inverse element. See inverse, inverse element.
(2) Let R be a ring with unit e. An element
r of R, for which there exists another element
a in R such that ar = e and ra = e, is called
an invertible element of R. This is, of course,
a special case of (1) above. The element a, if
it exists, is uniquely determined by r, and is
denoted by r−1. See unit.
If only the condition ar = e holds, then r is
said to be left invertible. Similarly, if only the
condition ra = e holds, then r is said to be right
invertible.
invertible function
A function f : S →T
such that there is a function g : T →S with
f ◦g = idT and g ◦f = idS. Often the word
“function” is used to specify that T is a ﬁeld.
invertible map
A function f : S →T such
that there is a function g : T →S with f ◦g =
idT and g ◦f = idS. Often the word “map” is
used to specify that T is not a ﬁeld of scalars.
invertible sheaf
A locally free sheaf of rank
1. In more detail, a ringed space is a topological
space X together with a sheaf of rings OX on X.
This means that to each open set U of X, there is
associated a ring OX(U). (The remaining prop-
erties of sheaves need not concern us here.) A
sheaf of OX modules is deﬁned similarly, except
that to each open subset U of X, there is asso-
ciated an OX module F(U). A sheaf F of OX
modules is locally free of rank 1, or invertible,
if X can be covered by open sets Uα, α ∈A,
such that F(Uα) is isomorphic to OX(Uα). See
also ringed space, sheaf.
involution
(1) A function φ from a set X
to itself, such that φ2 = φ.
Here, φ2(x) =
φ ◦φ(x) = φ(φ(x)).
(2) Let A be an algebra over the complex
numbers. A function φ from A to itself is an
involution if it satisﬁes the following four prop-
erties for all x and y in A and all complex num-
bers λ: (i.)
φ(x + y) = φ(x) + φ(y), (ii.)
φ(λx) = ¯λφ(x), (iii.) φ(xy) = φ(y)φ(x), (iv.)
φ((φ(x)) = x.
φ(x) is frequently denoted by x∗, and then
the four properties take the more familiar form:
(i.) (x +y)∗= x∗+y∗, (ii.) (λx)∗= ¯λx∗, (iii.)
(xy)∗= y∗x∗, (iv.) x∗∗= x.
Examples: (i.) A is the complex numbers.
x∗= ¯x, the complex conjugate of x. (ii.) A
is the algebra of bounded linear operators on a
Hilbert space. T ∗is the adjoint of T .
irrational equation
An equation with irra-
tional coefﬁcients. See also irrational number.
irrational exponent
An exponent which is
irrational. For example, the expressions 2π and
eπ involve irrational exponents. See also irra-
tional number.
irrational expression
An expression involv-
ing irrational numbers. See also irrational num-
ber. Although the word expression is often used
loosely in elementary mathematics without a
rigorous deﬁnition, it is possible to deﬁne ex-
pression rigorously by specifying the rules of a
formal grammar.
irrational number
A real number r which
cannot be expressed in the form p/q, where p
and q are integers. Equivalently, a real num-
ber which is not a rational number. It was the
great discovery of the ancient Greek mathemati-
cian and philosopher Pythagoras that
√

tional. The numbers e and π are also irrational.
These last two are irrational in a very strong

sense, they are transcendental, but it took until
the nineteenth century to prove this. See also
transcendental number.
irreducible algebraic curve
An algebraic
curve is a variety of dimension 1 in 2-
dimensional afﬁne or projective space. (A vari-
ety is the solution set to a system of polynomial
equations.) An algebraic curve is irreducible
if it is not the union of two proper (strictly
smaller) subvarieties. For example, the parabola
y −x2 = 0 is an irreducible algebraic curve, but
the pair of lines x2 −y2 = 0 is a reducible
algebraic curve because it can be decomposed
into the union of the two lines x −y = 0 and
x + y = 0.
irreducible R-module
Let R be a ring and
let M be a module over R. We say that M is
irreducible over R if R has no submodules. In
some contexts, we say that M is irreducible if
M cannot be written as a direct sum of proper
sub-modules. These are also sometimes called
simple modules.
irreducible character
A character of a ﬁnite
group which is not a sum of characters different
from itself. Every character of a ﬁnite group is a
sumofirreduciblecharacters. Seealsocharacter
of group.
irreducible co-algebra
A co-algebra in
which any two non-zero subco-algebras have
non-zero intersection. A co-algebra C is irre-
ducible if and only if C has a unique simple
subco-algebra.
irreducible component
(1) In algebraic ge-
ometry, a variety is the solution set of a system
of polynomial equations, usually in more than
one variable. A variety is irreducible if it is not
the union of two proper (strictly smaller) subva-
rieties. An irreducible component of a variety
is a maximal irreducible subvariety. That is, a
subvariety W ⊆V is an irreducible component
of a variety V if (i.) W is irreducible, and (ii.)
there is no irreducible variety W ′ properly be-
tween W and V (W ⊂W ′ ⊂V , W ̸= W ′,
W ′ ̸= V ).
Every variety is the ﬁnite union
of its irreducible components. Example: V =
{(x, y) : x2 −y2 = 0}. The irreducible com-
ponents of V are the two lines x −y = 0 and
x + y = 0.
The notion of an irreducible component ex-
tends to varieties in other contexts, for example
to analytic varieties.
(2)Incombinatorialgrouptheory, everyCox-
eter group can be written as the direct sum of
(possibly inﬁnitely many) irreducible Coxeter
groups, called the irreducible components of
the Coxeter group. See also irreducible Cox-
eter group.

Let Z denote the
rational integers and Q the rational ﬁeld. Let T
be a Z-representation of a ﬁnite group G. If T
is Q-irreducible, then T is called an irreducible
constituent of the group G.

irreducible Coxeter complex
A Coxeter
complex for which the associated Coxeter group
is an irreducible Coxeter group. In more detail,
let (W, S) be a Coxeter group. For now, it suf-
ﬁces that W is a (possibly inﬁnite) group and
S is a set of generators for W. Deﬁne a spe-
cial coset to be a coset of the form w⟨S′⟩, where
w ∈W, S′ ⊆S, and ⟨S′⟩is the group gener-
ated by S′. The Coxeter complex Q associated
with (W, S) is the partially ordered set of special
cosets, ordered by reverse inclusion: B ≤A if
and only if B ⊇A. Q is an irreducible Cox-
eter complex if its Coxeter group (W, S) is an
irreducible Coxeter group. See also irreducible
Coxeter group.
Although Coxeter complexes are abstractly
deﬁned, there is a rich geometry associated with
them, resembling the geometry of simplicial
complexes.
irreducible Coxeter group
A Coxeter group
which cannot be written as the direct sum of two
other Coxeter groups. In more detail, Coxeter
groups are generalizations of ﬁnite reﬂection
groups. Let W be a (possibly inﬁnite) group,
and let S be a set of generators for W. The pair
(W, S) is called a Coxeter group if two things are

true: (i.) Each element of S has order 2 (s2 = s
if s ∈S), and (ii.) W is deﬁned by the system of
generators and relations: set of generators = S;
set of relations = {(st)m(s,t) = 1}, where m(s, t)
is the order of the element st in the group W,
and there is one relation for each pair (s, t) with
s and t in S and m(s, t) < ∞.
A Coxeter group is irreducible if it cannot
be written as the direct sum of two other Cox-
eter groups. In other words, the Coxeter group
(W, S) is irreducible if it cannot be written as
(W, S) = (W ′ × W ′′, S′ ∪S′′), where (W ′, S′)
and (W ′′, S′′) are themselves Coxeter groups.
(Equivalently, a Coxeter group is irreducible if
its Coxeter diagram is connected.) Every Cox-
eter group can be written as the direct sum of
(possibly inﬁnitely many) irreducible Coxeter
groups, called the irreducible components of the
group. See also Coxeter diagram, irreducible
Coxeter complex.
irreducible decomposition
Informally, a de-
composition of an object into irreducible com-
ponents or elements. See irreducible compo-
nent, irreducible element.
irreducible element
(1) An element a of a
ring R with no proper factors in the ring. This
means that there do not exist elements b and
c in R, different from 1 and a, such that a =
bc. Example: If R is the ring of integers, the
irreducible elements are the prime numbers. See
also prime number.
(2) A join or meet irreducible element of a
lattice. See join irreducible element, meet irre-
ducible element.
irreducible equation
A polynomial equa-
tion P(x) = 0, where the polynomial P is irre-
ducible. See also irreducible polynomial.
irreducible fraction
A fraction a/b, where
the integers a and b have no common factors
other than 1 and −1. In other words, a fraction
reduced to lowest terms.
irreducible homogeneous Siegel domain
Siegel domains are special kinds of domains in
complex N space, CN. An easy way to con-
struct new Siegel domains is to take the Carte-
sian product of two given Siegel domains. Thus
if S1 and S2 are Siegel domains, S = S1 × S2 =
{s = (s1, s2) : s1 ∈S1, s2 ∈S2} will also
be a Siegel domain. A Siegel domain is irre-
ducible if it is not the Cartesian product of two
other Siegel domains. A Siegel domain is ho-
mogeneous if it has a transitive group of analytic
(holomorphic) automorphisms. An irreducible
homogeneous Siegel domain is a homogeneous
Siegel domain which is not the Cartesian prod-
uct of two other homogeneous Siegel domains.
See homogeneous domain, Siegel domain.
irreducible linear system
A system of linear
equations where no equation is a linear com-
bination of the others. It is a theorem that a
system of n linear equations in n unknowns is
irreducible if and only if the determinant of the
matrix of coefﬁcients is not 0. The methods of
row and column reduction provide computation-
ally efﬁcient tests for irreducibility. Synonym:
linearly independent system of linear equations.
See also linear combination, linearly indepen-
dent elements.
irreducible matrix
See Frobenius normal
form.
irreducible module
The module analog of a
simple group.
Speciﬁcally, an R module,
where R is a ring, is an irreducible module if
it contains no proper R submodules. For ex-
ample, Zp, the integers modulo a prime number
p, is an irreducible Z module. (Here, Z is the
ring of integers.) In the case where the ring R
is not commutative, the notion of irreducibility
extends to left and right R modules.
irreducible polynomial
A polynomial with
no proper factors. In greater detail, if R is a ring
and R[x] denotes the ring of polynomials with
coefﬁcients in R, then a polynomial P in R[x] is
irreducible if it is an irreducible element of the
ring R[x]. See irreducible element. Example: If
R is the ﬁeld of real numbers and C is the ﬁeld
of complex numbers, the polynomial P(x) =
x2 + 1 is irreducible in R[x] but reducible (it
factors as (x + i)(x −i)) in C[x].

irreducible representation
A representa-
tion of a group G is a homomorphism T from G
into the group GL(V ) of invertible linear trans-
formations on a vector space V . T is an irre-
ducible representation if there does not exist a
proper (̸= 0, ̸= V ) subspace W of V such that
T (g)(w) ∈W for all g ∈G and w ∈W.
The notion extends to other contexts. For ex-
ample, V may be a Hilbert space and GL(V )
may be replaced by the topological group of in-
vertible bounded linear operators on V . In this
case, thehomomorphismT isrequiredtobecon-
tinuous, and the subspaces W are required to be

tion.
irreducible R-module
Let R be a ring and
let M be a module over R. We say that M is
irreducible over R if R has no submodules. In
some contexts, we say that M is irreducible if
M cannot be written as a direct sum of proper
sub-modules. These are also sometimes called
simple modules.
irreducible scheme
A scheme whose under-
lying topological space is irreducible. In more
detail, a scheme is a particular type of ringed
space, (X, OX). Here, X is a topological space
and OX is a sheaf of rings on X. The scheme
(X, OX) is irreducible if X is not the union of
two proper (̸= ∅, ̸= X) closed subsets. See also
ringed space, scheme.
irreducible Siegel domain
Siegel domains

mains is to take the Cartesian product of two
given Siegel domains. Thus if S1 and S2 are
Siegel domains, S = S1 × S2 = {s = (s1, s2) :
s1 ∈S1, s2 ∈S2} will also be a Siegel domain.
A Siegel domain is irreducible if it is not the
Cartesian product of two other Siegel domains.
See Siegel domain. See also irreducible homo-
geneous Siegel domain.
irreducible tensor
An element of the tensor
product V ⊗W of two vector spaces, which
cannot be written as v ⊗w, for v ∈V and w ∈
W. Also called irreducible tensor operators or
spherical tensor operators.
Classically, let [a, b] = ab −ba and let
jx, jy, jz be the x-, y-, and z- components of
the angular momentum j. An irreducible ten-
sor of rank k is a dynamical quantity T k

tary representation of a (topological) group G
is a (continuous) homomorphism T from G into
the group U(H) of unitary operators on a Hilbert
space H. T is an irreducible unitary representa-
tion if there does not exist a proper (̸= 0, ̸= H)
closed subspace W of H such that T (g)(w) ∈
W for all g ∈G and w ∈W. See also irre-
ducible representation.
irreducible variety
A variety is the solution
set of a system of polynomial equations (usu-
ally in several variables). An irreducible vari-
ety is a variety V which is not the union of two
proper (̸= ∅, ̸= V ) subvarieties. For example,
the parabola y−x2 = 0 is an irreducible variety,
but the variety x2 −y2 = 0 is reducible because
it can be decomposed into the union of the two
lines x −y = 0 and x + y = 0.
irredundant
In a lattice L, a representation
of an element a as a join a = a1 ∨· · · ∨an
is irredundant if omitting any of the elements
ai from the join produces an element b strictly
smaller than a. There is a dual notion for meets:
A representation of an element a as a meet a =
a1∧· · ·∧an is irredundant if omitting any of the
elements ai from the meet produces an element
b strictly larger than a. See join, lattice, meet.

tative ring satisfying the ascending chain condi-
tion). L is the lattice of ideals of R, ordered

It is a theorem of ring theory,
the Lasker-Noether Theorem, that every ideal
in R has an irredundant representation as an in-
tersection of primary ideals. This theorem al-
most completely describes the ideal theory of
Noetherian rings, including such rings as the
ring of polynomials in several variables with co-
efﬁcients in a ﬁeld, and the ring of terms of holo-
morphic (analytic) functions in several complex
variables. See also Noether, Noetherian ring.
irregularity
In algebraic geometry, the di-
mension of the Picard variety of a non-singular
projective algebraic variety. See also Picard va-
riety.
irregular prime
A prime number p which
divides the numerator of one or more of the
Bernoulli numbers B2, B3, . . . , Bp−3. A prime
number which is not irregular is called a regular
prime. Irregular primes were of interest because
they were the class of exceptional primes for
which Kummer’s proof of Fermat’s Last Theo-
rem does not work. Wiles’ recent proof of Fer-
mat’s Last Theorem probably makes the distinc-
tion between regular and irregular primes unin-
teresting, but one never knows. See Bernoulli
number, Fermat’s Last Theorem.

isogenous Abelian varieties
A pair of Abel-

is a rational group homomorphism from one va-
riety onto the other. In more detail, an Abelian
variety is, among other things, an algebraic va-
riety which is also an Abelian group. A rational
group homomorphism from one Abelian variety
to another is a rational map which is also a group
homomorphism. See also rational map.

isogeny

H, where G and H are Lie groups, which is
a covering space map of the underlying mani-
folds. The map φ is a covering space map if
it is continuous and, for each h ∈H, there ex-
ists a neighborhood U of h such that φ−1(U)
is a disjoint union of open sets in G mapping
homeomorphically to U under φ.
(2) A topological group homomorphism (a

where G and H are topological groups, which

Isolated components are of interest because

isomorphic
Two groups G and H are iso-
morphic if there is an isomorphism φ : G →H
between them. Isomorphic groups are regarded
as being “abstractly identical,” or different re-

alizations of the same abstract group. The no-
tion extends to other algebraic structures such as
rings, to the completely general algebraic struc-
tures deﬁned in universal algebra, and even to
the theory of categories. See also isomorphism.
isomorphism
(1) In group theory, a map-
ping φ : G →H between two groups, G and
H, which is one-to-one (injective), onto (sur-
jective), and which preserves the group opera-
tion, that is φ(g1 · g2) = φ(g1) · φ(g2). The
notion extends to rings, where φ is required to
preserve the ring addition and multiplication, to
vector spaces, where φ is required to preserve
vector addition and scalar multiplication (i.e.,
φ(λ1v1 + λ2v2) = λ1φ(v1) + λ2φ(v2)), and to
completely general algebraic contexts (see (2)
below).
(2) In universal algebra, a mapping φ : G →
H between two (universal) algebras G and H,
which is one-to-one (injective), onto (surjec-
tive), and which preserves the operations of G
and H. In more detail, G = (G, FG) and H =
(H, FH), where G is a set and FG is a set of
functions from ﬁnite Cartesian products of G
with itself to G (FG is called the set of operations
on G), and similarly for H. Thus the functions
in FG are G-valued functions f (g1, . . . , gn) of
n G-valued variables, and the value of n may
vary with the function f .
To be an isomor-
phism, φ is required to be a one-to-one and onto
function from the set G to the set H, and for
every function f ∈FG, there must be a func-
tion h ∈FH, such that φ(f (g1, . . . , gn)) =
h(φ(g1), . . . , φ((gn)), and vice-versa. (This is
what is meant by “preserving the operations of
G and H.”)
In the special case where G and H are groups,
FG equals the singleton set containing the group
operation of G (the group multiplication), and
similarly for FH. We thus recapture the moti-
vating case of group isomorphisms.
(3) In category theory, a morphism φ : A →
B between two objects of a category with an
inverse morphism. In other words, for φ to be
an isomorphism, there must also be a morphism
ψ : B →A (the inverse of φ) such that ψ ◦φ =
ιA and φ ◦ψ = ιB. Here, ιA and ιB are the
identity morphisms on A and B, respectively.
The category theoretic deﬁnition captures all
of cases (1) and (2) above, and also includes
such examples as isomorphisms of topological
groups, where it is required that an isomorphism
φ be a group isomorphism and that φ and φ−1 be
continuous. See also category, homomorphism,
morphism, identity morphism.
Isomorphism Theorem of Class Field Theory
Let k be an algebraic number ﬁeld. Let I(m) be
the multiplicative group of all fractional ideals
of k which are relatively prime to a given integral
divisor m of k. The Galois group of a class ﬁeld
K/k for an ideal group H(m) is isomorphic to
I(m)/H(m). Therefore, every class ﬁeld K/k
is an Abelian extension of k.
isomorphism theorems of groups
The three
standard theorems describing the relationship
between homomorphisms, quotient groups, and
normal subgroups. Let G and H be groups, and
let φ : G →H be a homomorphism with ker-
nel K. (The kernel of φ is the set K = {g ∈
G : φ(g) = e}, where e is the group identity el-
ement in H.) The First Isomorphism Theorem
states that K is a normal subgroup of G (i.e.,
gK = Kg for every g ∈G), and the quotient
group (factor group) G/K is isomorphic to the
image of φ. Let S and T be subgroups of G, with
T normal. The Second Isomorphism Theorem
states that S ∩T is normal in S, and S/(S ∩T )
is isomorphic to T S/T . Let K ⊂H ⊂G,
with both K and H normal in G. The Third
Isomorphism Theorem states that H/K is a nor-
mal subgroup of G/K, and (G/K)/(H/K) is
isomorphic to G/H.
Thereisanadditionaltheoremwhichissome-
times called the Fourth Isomorphism Theorem,
but is more commonly called Zassenhaus’s
Lemma. Let A0, A1, B0, and B1 be subgroups
of G.
Suppose A0 is normal in A1, and B0
is normal in B1. Zassenhaus’s Lemma states
that A0(A1 ∩B0) is normal in A0(A1 ∩B1),
B0(A0 ∩B1) is normal in B0(A1 ∩B1), and
A0(A1 ∩B1)/A0(A1 ∩B0) is isomorphic to
B0(A1 ∩B1)/B0(A0 ∩B1).

a material or substance which responds the
same way to physical forces in all directions is
isotropic. Antonym: anisotropic.

(2) Let V be a vector space equipped with
a bilinear form ( , ).
A subspace W of V is
isotropic (sometimes called totally isotropic or
an isotropy subspace) if W ⊆W ⊥, where W ⊥
is deﬁned in the usual way, W ⊥= {v ∈V :
(v, w) = 0 for all w ∈W}. For example, if V =
R2, 2-dimensional real space, and ( , ) is the
Lorentz form, ((x1, t1), (x2, t2)) = x1x2 −t1t2,
then each of the lines forming the edge of the
light cone, {(x, t) : x2 −t2 = 0}, is an isotropic
subspace.
(3) If a differentiable manifold M has enough
additional structure so that its tangent space
comes equipped with a bilinear form, for exam-
ple if M is a symplectic manifold, then a sub-

s, and similarly for T Ms. See also symplectic
manifold, tangent space.

A group of transforma-

let G be a group of transformations acting on a
set X, and let x0 ∈X. The subgroup of transfor-

x0. The isotropy subgroup is also called the sta-

Innumericalanalysis, ama-

tions x1, x2, x3, . . . to a vector x, according to
the formula xk = Mxk−1 + c. (Of course, one
must have a conveniently chosen starting vec-
tor x0.) For example, suppose we wish to solve
the equation Ax = b approximately, where A
is an n × n square matrix, and x and b are n-
dimensional column vectors. Write A = L +
D + U, where L is lower triangular, D is diag-
onal, and U is upper triangular. If we choose
the iteration matrix M = −D−1(L + U) and
c = D−1b, we obtain the Jacobi method for
solving linear equations. On the other hand, if
we choose the iteration matrix M = −(L+D)U
and c = (L + D)−1b, we obtain the Gauss-
Seidel method for solving linear equations. See

Iwasawa’s Main Conjecture
(1) A conjec-

The conjecture is an attempt to extend a classic
theorem of Weil, which states that the character-
istic polynomial of the Frobenius automorphism
of a particular type of curve is the numerator of
the zeta function of the curve. The conjecture
was originally written over the ﬁeld Q, although
it has been reformulated as a conjecture over
any totally real ﬁeld. It has been proved for real
Abelian extensions of Q and odd primes p by
Mazur and Wiles. Some work has also been
done in the general case.
(2) A conjecture in number theory, relating
certain Galois actions to p-adic L-functions.
The conjecture asserts:
˜fχ(T ) = gχ(T ). Iwa-
sawa’s Theorem, which describes the behavior
of the p-part of the class number in a Zp-exten-
sion, can be regarded as a local version of the

Jacobi method for solving linear equations
An iterative numerical method, also called the
total-step method, for approximating the solu-
tions to a system of linear equations. In more
detail, suppose we wish to approximate the solu-
tion to the equation Ax = b, where A is an n×n
square matrix. Write A = L+D +U, where L
is lower triangular, D is diagonal, and U is up-
per triangular. The matrix D is easy to invert, so
replace the exact equation Dx = −(L+U)x+b
by the relation Dxk = −(L + U)xk−1 + b, and
solve for xk in terms of xk−1:
xk = −D−1(L + U)xk−1 + D−1b .
This gives us the core of the Jacobi iteration
method. We choose a convenient starting vec-
tor x0 and use the above formula to compute
successive approximations x1, x2, x3, . . . to the
actual solution x. Under suitable conditions, the
sequence of successive approximations does in-
deed converge to x. See iteration matrix.
Jacobi method of computing eigenvalues
Any of the several iterative methods for approxi-
mating all of the eigenvalues (characteristic val-
ues) of a Hermitian matrix A by constructing
a ﬁnite sequence of matrices A0, A1, . . . , AN,
where A0 = A and, for 0 < k ≤N, Ak =
U∗
k Ak−1Uk, Uk is a unitary matrix, and U∗
k de-
notestheconjugatetransposeofUk. Themethod
ends with a nearly diagonal matrix AN (all en-
tries off the diagonal are small) with good ap-
proximations to the eigenvalues of A down the
diagonal. The name is most frequently applied
to the Jacobi rotation method, where the ma-
trices Uk are chosen to be particularly simple
unitary matrices called planar rotation matri-
ces. See Jacobi rotation method.
Jacobi method of ﬁnding key matrix
A step
in solving a linear system Ax = b by the linear
stationary iterative process.
If the linear sta-
tionary iterative process is written as x(k+1) =
x(k) + R(b −Ax(k)), then the Jacobi method
chooses R to be the inverse of the diagonal sub-
matrix of A. See also linear stationary iterative
process.
Jacobi rotation method
An iterative method
for approximating all of the eigenvalues (char-
acteristic values) of a Hermitian matrix A. The
method begins by choosing A0 = A, and then
produces a sequence of matrices A1, A2, . . . ,
AN, culminating in a nearly diagonal (all entries
off the diagonal are small) matrix AN with good
approximations to the eigenvalues of A down
the diagonal. At each step, Ak = U∗
k Ak−1Uk,
where Uk is the (unitary) matrix of a planar rota-
tion annihilating the off diagonal entry of Ak−1
with largest modulus, hence the name rotation
method, and U∗
k is the conjugate transpose of
Uk. The matrix Uk =

Jacobson radical
The set of all elements
r in a ring R such that rs is quasi-regular for
all s ∈R. In more detail, let R be an arbi-
trary ring, possibly non-commutative, possibly
without a unit element. An element r ∈R is
quasi-regular if there is an element r′ ∈R such
that r + r′ + rr′ = 0.
(In the special case
where R has a unit element 1, this is equiva-
lent to (1+r)(1+r′) = 1.) For example, every
nilpotent element (rn = 0 for some n) is quasi-
regular, but there are often other quasi-regular
elements. The Jacobson radical of R is the set
J of all elements r ∈R such that rs is quasi-
regular for all s ∈R.
The Jacobson radical is a two-sided ideal, and
it generalizes the notion of the ordinary radical
(the set of all nilpotent elements) of a commuta-
tive ring, though even in the special case where
R is commutative, the Jacobson radical often
differs from the ordinary radical. Both derive
much of their importance from the following
theorem: Let R be commutative. Then (i.) R is
isomorphic to a subring of a direct sum of ﬁelds
if and only if its radical vanishes, and (ii.) R
is isomorphic to a subdirect sum of ﬁelds if and
only if its Jacobson radical vanishes. See also

join
(1) In a lattice, the supremum or least
upper bound of a set of elements. Speciﬁcally,
if A is a subset of a lattice L, the join of A is
the unique lattice element b = {x : x ∈A}
deﬁnedbythefollowingtwoconditions: (i.)x ≤
b for all x ∈A; (ii.) if x ≤c for all x ∈A, then
b ≤c. The join of an inﬁnite subset of a lattice
may not exist; that is, there may be no element
b of the lattice L satisfying conditions (i.) and
(ii.) above. However, by deﬁnition, one of the
axioms a lattice must satisfy is that the join of
a ﬁnite subset A must always exist. The join of
two elements is usually denoted by x ∨y.
There is a dual notion of the meet of a sub-
set A of a lattice, denoted by {x : x ∈A},
and deﬁned by reversing the inequality signs in
conditions (i.) and (ii.) above. The meet is
also called the inﬁmum or greatest lower bound
of the subset A. Again, the meet of an inﬁnite
subset may fail to exist, but the meet of a ﬁnite
subset always exists by the deﬁnition of a lattice.
(2) In relational database theory, the join (or
natural join) of two relations is the relation
formed by agreement on common attributes.
Speciﬁcally, a relation is a set R of functions
f : A →X, from some set A, called the set of
attribute names, to a set X, called the set of pos-
sible attribute values.
(In relational database
theory, the set A is always ﬁnite, so database
theorists make the gloss of identifying a rela-
tion with a set of n-tuples, that is, a relation in
the ordinary mathematical sense, and they then
sneak the attribute names in under the table.) If
R and S are two relations, with sets of attribute
names A and B, respectively, and set of possi-
ble attribute values X and Y, then the join of R
and S is the relation R▷◁S, with set of attribute
names A ∪B and a set of possible attribute val-
ues X ∪Y, deﬁned as the set of all functions
f : A ∪B →X ∪Y such that f |A ∈R and
f |B ∈S. Here, f |A is the restriction of f to A,
and f |B is the restriction of f to B. Thus the
formation of the natural join reduces to the fa-
miliar and ubiquitous mathematical problem of
extending classes of functions. See restriction.
join irreducible element
An element a of
a lattice L which cannot be represented as the
join of lattice elements b properly smaller than

There is a dual notion of meet irreducibility.
An element a of L is meet irreducible if it cannot
be represented as the meet of lattice elements b
properly larger than a (a < b, a ̸= b). See meet.

a1, . . . , an is the subset
σ (a1, . . . , an) =

a1, . . . , an actually generate the Banach algebra
A, then M is homeomorphic to σ(a1, . . . , an),
and σ(a1, . . . , an) is polynomially convex. See

where each Ji is an elementary Jordan matrix,
is in Jordan canonical form. It is a theorem of
linear algebra that every n × n matrix with en-
tries from an algebraically complete ﬁeld, such
as the complex numbers, is similar to a matrix
in Jordan canonical form. See also elementary
Jordan matrix.
Jordan decomposition
(1) The decomposi-
tion of a linear transformation T : V →V ,
where V is a vector space, into a sum T =
Ts +Tn, where Ts is diagonalizable, Tn is nilpo-
tent, and the two commute. (Nilpotent means
T k
n = 0 for some integer k, and diagonalizable
meansthereisabasisforV withrespecttowhich
T can be represented by a diagonal matrix.) Ts
and Tn, if they exist, are uniquely determined
by T . It is a theorem of linear algebra that if
V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over an
algebraically closed ﬁeld, such as the complex
numbers, then Ts and Tn always exist, that is T
always has a Jordan decomposition. However,
this need not be true if the ﬁeld is, for example,
the ﬁeld of real numbers which is not algebrai-
cally closed. The Jordan decomposition of T is
equivalent to the representation of T by a matrix
in Jordan canonical form. See Jordan canonical
form.
(2) The decomposition of an element a of a
Lie algebra A into a sum a = s + n, where
s is a semisimple element of A, n is a nilpo-
tent element of A, and s and n commute. This
decomposition is called the additive Jordan de-
composition of a. The elements s and n, if they
exist, are uniquely determined by a. It is a theo-
rem that if A is a semisimple ﬁnite dimensional
Lie algebra over an algebraically complete ﬁeld,
such as the complex numbers, then s and n al-
ways exist. See semisimple Lie algebra.
(3) The decomposition of a linear transfor-
mation T into a product T = SU, where S is di-
agonalizable, U is unipotent, and S and U com-
mute. (Unipotent means that U −I is nilpotent,
where I is the identity transformation.) This de-
composition is called the multiplicative Jordan
decomposition of T . S and U, if they exist, are
uniquely determined by T , and then the multi-
plicative Jordan decomposition is related to the
additive Jordan decomposition T = Ts + Tn by
S = Ts, U = I + S−1Tn.
(4) The decomposition of a linear transfor-
mation T into a product T = EHU, where E is
elliptic, H is hyperbolic, U is unipotent, and all
three commute. (Elliptic means E is diagonal-
izable and all complex eigenvalues have mod-
ulus = 1. Hyperbolic means H is diagonaliz-
able and all complex eigenvalues have modulus
< 1.) This decomposition is called the com-
pletely multiplicative Jordan decomposition of
T . E, H, and U, if they exist, are uniquely
determined by T .
(5) In analysis, the decomposition of a
bounded additive set function µ (deﬁned on a
ﬁeld of sets 8) into the difference of two non-
negative bounded additive set functions, µ =
µ+ −µ−, via the formulas
µ+(E) = sup
F⊆E
µ(F),
µ−(E) = −inf
F⊆E µ(F) ,
where F is restricted to belong to 8. Here sup
and inf refer to the supremum and inﬁmum, re-
spectively. (See supremum, inﬁmum.) The set
functions µ+ and µ−are called the positive or
upper variation of µ, and the negative or lower
variation of µ. The sum |µ| = µ+ + µ−is
called the total variation of µ. See also additive
set function.
(6) In analysis, the decomposition of a func-
tion of bounded variation into the difference of a
monotonically increasing function and a mono-
tonically decreasing function.
(Sometimes
stated monotonically non-decreasing and mono-
tonically non-increasing.) This is a special case
of (5). See also bounded variation, monotone
function.
Jordan-Hölder Theorem
(1) The theorem
that any two composition series of a group are
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

equivalent. A composition series of a group G
is a ﬁnite sequence of groups
G = G0 ⊃G1 ⊃· · · ⊃Gn = {1} ,
such that each group Gi+1 is a maximal normal
subgroup of Gi. (Equivalently, each Gi+1 is
a normal subgroup of Gi and the factor group
Gi/Gi+1 is simple and not equal to {1}.) Two
composition series of G are equivalent if they
have the same length and isomorphic factor
groups. The theorem extends to groups with
operators, thus to R modules, for example, and
even to lattices (see (2) below). See also factor
group, normal subgroup, simple group.
(2) The theorem that any two composition
chains connecting two elements a and b in a
modular lattice are equivalent. A lattice is mod-
ular if it satisﬁes the weakened distributive law,
x ∧(y ∨z) =(x ∧y) ∨(x ∧z)
whenever x ≥y .
Here, y ∨z denotes the lattice join or supremum
(least upper bound) of y and z, and y ∨z de-
notes the lattice meet or inﬁmum (greatest lower
bound) of y and z. (See join.) A composition
chain connecting a to b is a ﬁnite sequence of
lattice elements, a = a0 ≥a1 ≥· · · an = b,
such that there is no lattice element x strictly
between ai and ai+1. (Equivalently, each in-
terval [ai+1, ai] is a two element lattice.) Two
composition chains are equivalent if they have
the same length and projective intervals. Two
intervals [w, x] and [y, z] are projective if there
is a ﬁnite sequence of intervals,
[w, x] = [w1, x1] , [w2, x2] , . . . , [wn, xn]
= [y, z]
such that each pair of intervals [wi, xi] and
[wi+1, xi+1] are transposes. Finally, two inter-
vals are transposes if there are lattice elements
c and d such that one interval is [c, c ∨d] and
the other is [c ∧d, d].
If G is a group, the lattice of its normal sub-
groups is a modular lattice. Thus, the Jordan-
Hölder theorem for lattices gives us several
Jordan-Hölder like theorems for groups, for in-
stance for chief series and characteristic series.
(The isomorphism of factor groups comes from
the projectivity relation and the second isomor-
phism theorem for groups.) Unfortunately, the
classical Jordan-Hölder theorem for composi-
tion series of groups (see (1) above) is not so
easy to derive from the lattice theorem because
the lattice of all subgroups may not be modu-
lar. See also characteristic series, isomorphism
theorems of groups.
Jordan homomorphism
A mapping φ be-
tween Jordan algebras A and B which respects
addition, scalar multiplication, and the Jordan
multiplication.
In other words, φ(a + b) =
φ(a) + φ(b), φ(λa) = λφ(a), and φ(a · b) =
φ(a)·φ(b), for all scalars λ and for all a, b ∈A.
See Jordan algebra.
Jordan module
Let A be a Jordan algebra
over a ﬁeld of scalars K. A Jordan A module is
a vector space V over the same ﬁeld K, together
with a multiplication operation · from A × V to
V satisfying (i.) a · (v + w) = a · b + a · w;
(ii.) a · (λv) = λ(a · v), and (iii.) (a · b) · v =
1
2a·(b·v)+ 1
2b·(a·v), for all a, b ∈A, v, w ∈V ,
and scalars λ.
Property (iii.) seems odd; indeed the reader
familiar with R modules (R a ring) would think
it should be replaced by (a · b) · v = a · (b · v).
However, property (iii.) is easier to understand
if one realizes that the Jordan multiplication ·
induces a mapping a →Ta between elements a
of the Jordan algebra and linear transformations
Ta. Given a ∈A, Ta is deﬁned by Ta(v) = a·v.
Property (iii.) is chosen to guarantee that Ta·b
will be the Jordan product 1
2 (TaTb + TbTa) in
the Jordan algebra of linear transformations of
the vector space V .
In fact, the mapping a →Ta is a Jordan
homomorphism of A into the Jordan algebra of
all linear transformations on V . A homomor-
phism between a Jordan algebra A and a Jor-
dan algebra of linear transformations is called
a Jordan representation of A. The deﬁnition
of a Jordan module has been designed so there
is a one-to-one correspondence between Jordan
representations and Jordan modules. See also
Jordan algebra, Jordan homomorphism, Jordan
representation.

Jordan representation
A Jordan homomor-
phism between a Jordan algebra A and a Jor-
dan algebra of linear transformations on a vec-
tor space V , equipped with the standard Jordan
product, T ·S = 1
2(T S+ST ). There is a one-to-
one correspondence between Jordan representa-
tions and Jordan modules. See also Jordan al-
gebra, Jordan homomorphism, Jordan module.
Jordan-Zassenhaus theorem
Let A be a ﬁ-
nite dimensional semisimple algebra with unit
over the ﬁeld of rational numbers, Q. Let Z be
the ring of integers, and let G be a Z-order in
A. Let L∗be a left A module, and let σ(L∗) be
the set of all left G modules L, having a ﬁnite Z
basis, which are contained in L∗, and such that
QL = L∗. The Jordan-Zassenhaus Theorem
states: The set σ(L∗) splits into a ﬁnite number
of classes under Z-equivalence.
The Jordan-Zassenhaus Theorem is a far
reaching generalization of the theorem that the
number of ideal classes in an algebraic number
ﬁeld is ﬁnite. See class ﬁeld, ideal class, Z-basis,
Z-equivalence, Z-order.

K
K3 surface
A class of algebraic surface in
abstract algebraic geometry, deﬁned in a pro-
jective space over an algebraically closed ﬁeld.
In projective 3-space they can be regarded as de-
formations of quartic surfaces. A K3 surface is
characterized as a nonsingular, nonrational sur-
face, in several ways including:
(i.) irregularity, Kodaira dimension, and the
canonical divisor are zero;
(ii.) irregularity is zero and the arithmetic,
geometric, and ﬁrst plurigenus are all one;
(iii.) as a compact complex analytic surface,
the ﬁrst Chern class is zero and it has Betti num-
bers b0 = 1, b1 = 0, b2 = 22, b3 = 0, b4 = 1.
The space of one-dimensional differential
forms on a K3 surface is zero. An example of a
K3 surface is any smooth surface of order four
in projective three-dimensional space.
K3 surfaces were early examples of surfaces
satisfying Weil’s conjecture concerning the ana-
log of the Riemann Hypothesis for algebraic va-
rieties.
Kakeya-Eneström Theorem
Let f be a
polynomial with real coefﬁcients, say
f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0 ,
for each real number x. Suppose
an ≥an−1 ≥· · · ≥a0 > 0 .
Let r be any root of the polynomial. Then |r| ≤
1.
Kaplansky’s Density Theorem
A funda-
mental theorem from the theory of von Neu-
mann algebras proved by Kaplansky in 1951.
The closure M with respect to the weak oper-
ator topology of a C∗-subalgebra A of the set of
bounded linear operators on a separable Hilbert
space is a von Neumann algebra. Furthermore,
if A1 is the set of elements of A with norm ≤1
in A (unit ball of A) and M1 is the set of ele-
ments of M with norm ≤1 (unit ball of M),
then M1 is the closure of A1 with respect to the
weak operator topology.
The theorem remains true if restated using
the strong operator topology instead of the weak
operator topology. Sometimes, the statement of
the theorem includes the following additional
information. The set of self-adjoint elements of
A1 is strongly dense in the set of self-adjoint
elements of M1, the set of positive elements of
A1 is strongly dense in M1, and if A contains 1,
the unitary group of A is strongly dense in the
unitary group of M.
k-compact group
A connected algebraic
group deﬁned over a perfect ﬁeld k whose k-
Borel subgroups are reduced to the identity
group. The name k-anisotropic group is used
also. See also k-isotropic group.
k-complete scheme
Let f : X −→Y be a
morphism of schemes X, Y. When f has a prop-
erty, it is customary to say that X has the prop-
erty over Y, or that X is a Y-(property) scheme.
The property of being complete is connected
with the property of being proper. A morphism
f : X −→Y is proper if it is separated, of ﬁ-
nite type, and is universally closed. Then X is
called proper over Y. See separated morphism,
morphism of ﬁnite type.
Now, let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld.
Let X be a scheme of ﬁnite type over k which is
reduced (i.e., for any element x the local ring at
x has no nilpotent elements) and is irreducible
(i.e., the underlying topological space is not the
union of proper closed subsets). If X is proper
over k (actually over the spectrum of k), then X
is called a k-complete scheme.
kernel
(1) In algebra, where a homomor-
phism f is deﬁned between two algebraic sys-
tems A and B, if the group identity of B is de-
noted by e, then the kernel of f is
ker(f ) = {x ∈A : f (x) = e} .
Alternately, ker(f ) may be denoted f −1({e}).
The kernel is a subset of A that usually has
special properties. If A and B are groups, then
the kernel of a homomorphism is a normal sub-
group of A. If A and B are R-modules over a
ring R, the kernel is a submodule of A. If A and
B are topological linear spaces, then the kernel
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

of a continuous linear operator is a closed linear
subspace. The kernel of a semi-group homo-
morphism is the smallest two-sided ideal in the
semi-group. Similar remarks hold for kernels of
homomorphisms or morphisms in category the-
ory, sheaf theory, and kernels of linear operators
between spaces.
(2) In topology, for a nonempty set S in a
topological space, the kernel of S is the largest
subset T of S such that every element of T is an
accumulation or cluster point of T .
(3) The word kernel is used in various other
areas of mathematics to denote a function. In
the study of integral equations, for example, the
function K in the integral
 b
a
K(x, y)f (y) dy
is called a kernel.
k-form
(1) In linear algebraic group theory, a
k-form of an algebraic group G deﬁned over an
extension ﬁeld K of a ﬁeld k is another algebraic
group H deﬁned over k that is K-isomorphic
to G. Much work has been done in classify-
ing the “k-forms” of various types of algebraic
groups deﬁned over K (e.g., semisimple alge-
braic groups or almost simple algebraic groups).
(2) More generally, if G is an algebraic group
deﬁned over k and K/k is a ﬁnite Galois exten-
sion, an algebraic group G1 is said to be a K/k-
form of G if there is a K-isomorphism from G
onto G1. For example, let k be a ﬁeld and 
a universal domain containing k. Let T be an
n-dimensional algebraic k-torus with splitting
ﬁeld K. Then since T is K-isomorphic to the
direct product of n copies of GL(1) (the multi-
plicative group of non-zero elements of ), T is
a K/k-form of the n-dimensional K-split torus
GL(1)n.
See also quadratic form.
Killing form
In Lie algebra theory, a sym-
metric bilinear form associated with the adjoint
representation of a Lie algebra. Speciﬁcally, if
g is a Lie algebra over a commutative ring K
with 1, ρ is the adjoint (linear) representation
of g and Tr denotes the trace operator, the sym-
metric bilinear form B : g × g −→K given
by B(x, y) = Tr(ρ(x)ρ(y)) is called the Killing
form.
It is named after W. Killing who studied it in
1888. The Killing form is fundamental in the
study of Killing-Cartan classiﬁcation of semi-
simple Lie algebras over ﬁelds of characteristic
0.
k-isomorphism
(1) Let k be a ﬁeld and
K, L extension ﬁelds of k.
An isomorphism
σ
: K −→L such that σ(x) = x for all
x ∈k is called a k-isomorphism. Alternately,
a k-isomorphism from K onto L is an isomor-
phism of the k-algebra K onto the k-algebra L.
(2) For other algebraic structures over a ﬁeld
k, a k-isomorphism is essentially an isomor-
phism (a bijective map that preserves the bi-
nary operations) and a “regular” mapping (pre-
serving the particular structure on the sets).
For example, for linear algebraic groups a k-
isomorphism is an isomorphism that is also a bi-
rational mapping. For homogeneous k-spaces,
a k-isomorphism is an isomorphism that is an
everywhere deﬁned pre-k-mapping.
k-isotropic group
A connected algebraic
group, deﬁned over a perfect ﬁeld k, whose k-
Borel subgroups are nontrivial. For a reductive
k-group G deﬁned over an arbitrary ﬁeld k, G
is k-isotropic if the k-rank of G is greater than
zero. See k-compact group. See also k-rank.
Kleinian group
A subgroup G of the group
of linear fractional functions deﬁned on the ex-
tended complex plane ˆC such that there is an
element x in ˆC which has a neighborhood U
such that g(U) ∩U = ∅, for each nontrivial
g ∈G. Such groups were ﬁrst studied by Klein
andPoincaréinthe19thcenturyandwerenamed
by Poincaré. See linear fractional function.
KMS condition
A condition originally con-
cerning ﬁnite-volume Gibbs states and later pro-
posed for time evolution and the equilibrium
states in quantum lattice systems in statistical
mechanics (mathematically, within the frame-
work of C∗-dynamical systems and a one-
parametergroupofautomorphismsthatdescribe
the time evolution of the system). The condition
was ﬁrst noted by the physicists R. Kubo in 1957
and C. Martin and J. Schwinger in 1959. The
letters K, M, and S are derived from their names.
The equilibrium states are called KMS states.

Let M be a von Neumann algebra. Let φ
be a faithful normal positive linear functional
on M. Let {σt} be a strongly continuous one-
parameter group of ∗-automorphisms of M. Let
S be the closed strip in the complex plane {z :
0 ≤ℑ(z) ≤1}. Then the group {σt} will be said
to satisfy the KMS condition if for any x, y ∈M,
there is F : S −→C such that F is bounded
and continuous on S, analytic in the interior of
S, and satisﬁes the conditions
F(t) = φ (σt(x)y)
and
F(t + i) = φ (yσt(x)) .
The theory of Tomita-Takesaki shows the exis-
tence of such a group {σt} and also that such
groups are characterized by the condition. The
KMS condition is a very important concept in the
construction of type-III von Neumann algebras.
See type-III von Neumann algebra.
Kostant’s formula
A formula (named after
B. Kostant) that gives the multiplicities of the
weights of a ﬁnite dimensional irreducible rep-
resentation constructed from a root system of a
complex semisimple Lie algebra. It is a con-
sequence of the Weyl character formula. See
Weyl’s character formula. In order to under-
stand the (very explicit) formula, some deﬁni-
tions are in order. Let g be a complex semisim-
ple Lie algebra. Let V be a C-module and ρ
a linear irreducible representation of g over V .
Let )+ be the set of positive roots. Let δ be the
half sum of the positive roots (δ = 1
2

α∈)+ α).
Let W be the Weyl group of the root system. Let
- be the highest weight of ρ. Let P be a non-
negative integer valued function (called the par-
tition function) deﬁned on the lattice of weights.
For each weight µ, P(µ) is the number of ways
µ can be expressed as a sum of positive roots.
Let m-(λ) denote the multiplicity of a weight λ
of ρ. Then Kostant’s formula is
m-(λ) =

w∈W
det(w)P(w(- + δ) −(λ + δ)) .
This sum is very difﬁcult to compute in practice
and is thus of more theoretical than computa-
tional use. See also positive root, Weyl group.
k-rank
Let K be an algebraically closed
ﬁeld, k an arbitrary subﬁeld of K, and G a re-
ductive linear algebraic group deﬁned over k.
(See reductive; examples of reductive groups are
semisimple groups, any torus, and the general
linear group.) Let T be a k-split torus in G of
largest possible dimension. The dimension of
T is called the k-rank of G. The k-rank is 0 if
and only if G is anisotropic.
The nonzero weights of the adjoint of T are
called k-roots. In case T is a maximal torus,
k-roots are the usual roots of G with respect to
T .
Let Z denote the centralizer of T in G; i.e.,
Z =

y∈T
{x ∈G : xy = y} .
Let N denote the normalizer of T in G; i.e.,
N =

x ∈G : xT x−1 = T

.
Then the ﬁnite quotient group Z/N is called
the k-Weyl group. The group is named after the
German mathematician H. Weyl (1885–1955).
k-rational divisor
(1) Let K be the alge-
braic closure (Galois extension) of a ﬁnite ﬁeld
k (with q elements) and let X be an algebraic
curve deﬁned over k. Then the automorphism
σ : k −→k deﬁned by σ(x) = xq deﬁnes an
automorphism σ : X −→X deﬁned by
σ (x1, x2, . . . , xn) =

xq
1 , xq
2 , . . . , xq
n

that leaves all k-rational points in X ﬁxed (called
the Frobenius automorphism). Let
d =

x∈X
axx
be a divisor in X. (Recall that all ak ∈Z (inte-
gers) and all except at most a ﬁnite number are
zero.) Then d is a member of the free Abelian
group of divisors with base X, called Div(X).
The divisor d is a k-rational divisor if
d = σ(d) =

x∈X
axσ(x) .
The set of k-rational divisors is a subgroup of
Div(X).
(2) Another use of the term k-rational divi-
sor involves a ﬁnite extension k of the ﬁeld of
rational numbers Q. A divisor d = n
i=1 Pi
is a k-rational divisor if all rational symmetric
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

functions of the coordinates of the points Pi with
coefﬁcients in Q are elements of the ﬁeld k.
k-rational point
The term k-rational point
occurs in several areas of algebraic geometry,
algebraic varieties, and linear algebraic groups.
Examples of how the term is used follow.
(1) Let K be an algebraically closed ﬁeld and
k a subﬁeld of K. Let A2 be the set of pairs
(a, b) of elements a, b ∈K (the afﬁne plane).
Let f be a polynomial from A2 into K with
coefﬁcients from K. Recall that a plane alge-
braic curve is {(x, y) ∈A2 : f (x, y) = 0}.
Then P = (x, y) ∈A2 is a k-rational point if
x, y ∈k. If K = C and k = Q, then a point
(x, y) is a k-rational point if both coordinates
are rational numbers.
(2) If K is the ﬁnite ﬁeld consisting of pr ele-
ments (p a prime number) and K is the algebraic
closure, then the set of k-rational points of a
curvewithcoefﬁcientsink coincideswiththeset
of solutions of f (x, y) = 0, x, y ∈k. If r = 1,
so that k is a prime number ﬁeld, then the set of
k-rational points is equivalent to the set of solu-
tions of the congruence f (x, y) ≡0 (mod p).
(3) More generally, let k be a subﬁeld of an
arbitrary ﬁeld K. Let x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈An.
Then x is a k-rational point if each xi ∈k,
i = 1, . . . , n. Next, let x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Pn
(projective space). Then x is a k-rational point
if there is a (n + 1)-tuple of homogeneous co-
ordinates (λx0, λx1, . . . , λxn), λ ̸= 0 such that
λxi ∈k, for each i = 0, 1, . . . , n. If xi ̸= 0, this
is equivalent to xj/xi ∈k, ∀j = 0, 1, . . . , n.
(4) Let G be a linear algebraic group deﬁned
over a ﬁeld k. An element p that has all of its
coordinates in k is called a k-rational point.
(5) If X is a scheme over k, a point p of X
is called a k-rational point of X if the residue
class ﬁeld (with respect to the inclusion map of
k into X at p) is k.
(6) If K is an algebraically closed transcen-
dental extension of k; V is an algebraic variety
deﬁned over k; and k′ is a subﬁeld of K, then
a k′-rational point of V is an element of V that
has all of its coordinates in k′.
Krieger’s factor
The study of von Neumann
algebras is carried out by studying the factors
which are of type I, II, or III, with subtypes for
each. (See factor.) Krieger’s factor is a crossed
product of a commutative von Neumann alge-
bra with one ∗-automorphism. A Krieger’s fac-
tor can be identiﬁed with approximately ﬁnite
dimensional von Neumann algebras (over sepa-
rable Hilbert spaces) of type III0. Krieger’s fac-
tor was named after W. Krieger who has studied
them extensively.
Kronecker delta
A symbol, denoted by δi,j,
deﬁned by
δi,j =
	 1
if i = j
0
if i ̸= j .
It is a special type of characteristic function de-
ﬁned on the Cartesian product of a set with itself.
Speciﬁcally, let S be a set. Let D = {(x, x) :
x ∈S}. The value of the characteristic function
of D is 1 if (x, y) ∈D (meaning that x = y)
and is 0 otherwise.

Kronecker product
(1) Let A = (aij) de-
note an m × n matrix of complex numbers and
B = (bij) an r × s matrix of complex numbers.
Then the Kronecker product of the matrices A
and B is deﬁned as the mr ×ns matrix described
by the mn blocks Cij given by
Cij = aijB,
1 ≤i ≤m, 1 ≤j ≤n .
Sometimes other permutations of the mnrs el-
ements arranged in mr rows and ns columns is
called the Kronecker product. This product is
used, for example, in studying modulii spaces
of Abelian varieties with endomorphism struc-
ture.
(2) Let V and W be ﬁnite dimensional vec-
tor spaces over a ﬁeld k with bases {x1, . . . , xn}
and {y1, . . . , yr} for V and W, respectively. Let
L be a linear transformation on V and M a lin-
ear transformation on W. Let A be an n × n
matrix associated with L and B an r × r ma-
trix associated with M, determined by using the
stated ordering of the basis elements. If lexico-
graphic ordering is used for the tensor products
of the basis elements in determining a basis for
the tensor product of V and W, then the ten-
sor product V ⊗W of the linear transformations
has the nr × nr Kronecker product matrix de-
scribed in (1) as its matrix representation. See
lexicographic linear ordering.
(3) Now let V and W be arbitrary vector
spaces over a ﬁeld k. Let U be a vector space
whose basis vectors are elements of the Carte-
sian product of V and W, i.e., let the elements
of U be ﬁnite sums of the form
n

ν=1
αν (xν, yν) .
Let N be the subspace of U such that
n

ν=1
ανL (xν) M (yν) = 0 ,
for each linear functional L : V −→k and each
linear functional M : W −→k. Deﬁne the
Kronecker product of V and W with respect to
k as the quotient space U/N. If V and W are
rings with unity instead, and multiplication in U
is deﬁned componentwise, then N becomes an
ideal of U and the Kronecker product becomes
a residue class ring.
(4) Sometimes, the tensor product of algebras
is referred to as their Kronecker product.
Kronecker’s Theorem
Several theorems in
severalﬁeldsofmathematicshonorL.Kronecker
(1823–1891).
(1) If f is a monic irreducible element of k[x]
over a ﬁeld k, there is an extension ﬁeld L of k
containing a root c of f such that L = k(c).
Sometimes such an L is called a star ﬁeld. For
example, the polynomial x2 + 1 over the real
number ﬁeld has the ﬁeld of complex numbers
as a star ﬁeld. Further, if f has degree n, there is
an extension ﬁeld of k in which f factors into n
linear factors, so f has exactly n roots (counting
multiplicities).
(2) A ﬁeld extension of the ﬁeld of rational
numbers which has an Abelian Galois group is
a subﬁeld of a cyclotomic ﬁeld.
(3)Kroneckerwasamongseveralmathemati-
cians who studied the structure of subgroups and
quotient groups of Rn generated by a ﬁnite num-
ber of elements. The following theorem was
proved by him in 1884 and is also called Kro-
necker’s Theorem. Let m, n be integers ≥1. In
the following i will denote an integer between 1
and m while j will denote an integer between 1
and n. Let ai = (ai1, ai2, . . . , aim) be m points
of Rn and b = (b1, b2, . . . , bm) ∈Rn. For ev-

if and only if for every choice of n integers

This theorem involves the closure of the sub-
group of the torus T n generated by a ﬁnite num-
ber of elements. Generalizations of the theorem
have been studied in the theory of topological
groups.

Krull-Akizuki Theorem
Let R be a Noethe-
rian integral domain, k its ﬁeld of quotients, and
K a ﬁnite algebraic extension of k. Let A be a
subring of K containing R. Assume every non-
zero prime ideal of R is maximal (i.e., assume
R has Krull dimension 1). Then A is a Noethe-
rian ring of Krull dimension 1. Also, for any
ideal g ̸= (0) of A, A/g is a ﬁnitely generated
A-module.
Here, the integral closure of a Noetherian
domain of dimension one is Noetherian. This
remains true for a two-dimensional Noetherian
domain but not for dimension three or higher.
Krull-Azumaya Lemma
Let R be a com-
mutative ring with unit, M ̸= 0 a ﬁnite R-
module, and N an R-submodule of M. Let J be
the Jacobson radical of R. The Krull-Azumaya
Lemma is a name given to any of the following
statements:
(i.) If MJ + N = M, then N = M;
(ii.) M ̸= MJ;
(iii.)
If M/MJ is spanned by a ﬁnite set
{xi + MJ}, then M is spanned by {xi}.
This lemma is also known by the name
Nakayama’s Lemma and by the name Azumaya-
Krull-Jacobson’s Lemma. It is a basic tool in the
study of non-semiprimitive rings.
Krull dimension
The supremum of the
lengths of chains of distinct prime ideals of a
ring R. It is sometimes called the altitude of R.
The deﬁnition was ﬁrst proposed by W. Krull in
1937 and is now considered to be the “correct”
deﬁnition not only for Noetherian rings but also
for arbitrary rings.
With this deﬁnition any ﬁeld κ has dimension
zeroandthepolynomialringκ[x]hasdimension
one.
One reason for the acceptance of this def-
inition for rings comes from a comparison to
the situation in ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces.
In a vector space of dimension n over a ﬁeld
κ, the largest chain of proper vector subspaces
has length n.
The corresponding polynomial
ring κ[x1, . . . , xn] has a decreasing sequence (of
length or height n) of distinct prime ideals

trations. See Artin-Rees Lemma.
Krull-Remak-Schmidt Theorem
The the-
orem arises in various branches of algebra and
addresses the common length and isomorphisms
between elements of the decomposition of an al-
gebraic structure.
(1) In group theory. Suppose a group G satis-
ﬁes the descending or ascending chain condition
for normal subgroups. If G1 × G2 × · · · × Gn
and H1×H2×· · ·×Hm are two decompositions
of G consisting of indecomposable normal sub-
groups, then n = m and each Gi is isomorphic
to some Hj.
(2)Inringtheory. LetA = A1×A2×· · ·×An
and B = B1 × B2 × · · · × Bn be Artinian and
Noetherian modules where each Ai and Bj are
indecomposable modules.
Then m = n and
each Ai is isomorphic to some Bj.
(3) The theorem may be formulated for other
algebraic structures, e.g., for local endomor-
phism modules or for modular lattices.
Combinations of the names W. Krull, R.
Remak, O. Schmidt, J.H.M. Wedderburn, and
G. Azumaya are used to refer to this theorem.
Wedderburn ﬁrst stated the theorem for groups,
Remak gave a proof for ﬁnite groups, Schmidt
gave a proof for groups with an arbitrary sys-
tem of operators, Krull extended the theorem
to rings, and Azumaya found extensions of the
theorem to other algebraic structures.
Krull ring
A commutative integral domain A
for which there exists a family {νi}i∈I of discrete
valuations on the ﬁeld of fractions K of A such
that the intersection of all the valuation rings of
the{νi}i∈I isAandνi(x) = 0forallnonzerox ∈
K and for all except (possibly) a ﬁnite number
of indices i ∈I. A Krull ring is also called a
Krull domain. Every discrete valuation ring is
a Krull ring as is a factorial ring and a principal
ideal domain.
Krull rings were studied by W. Krull. They
represent an attempt to get around the problem
that the integral closure of a Noetherian domain
is (generally) not ﬁnite. Since the valuations
described above may be identiﬁed with the set
of prime ideals of height one, a Krull ring may be
deﬁned alternately using prime ideal of height
one.
Krull’s Altitude Theorem
Also called
Krull’s Principal Ideal Theorem. This theorem
has several forms and characterizations.
(1) Let R be a Noetherian ring, let x ∈R
and let P be minimal among prime ideals of
R containing x. Then the height of P (or the
codimension or the altitude of P) is ≤1. See
Krull dimension.
(2) Let R be a Noetherian ring containing
x1, . . . , xn.
Let P be minimal among prime
ideals of R containing x1, x2, . . . , xn. Then the
height of P ≤n.
(3) Let R be a Noetherian local ring with
maximal ideal m. Then the dimension of R is
the minimal number n such that there exist n
elements x1, x2, . . . , xn not all contained in any
prime ideal other than m.
Consequences of the theorem include the fact
that the prime ideals in a Noetherian ring sat-
isfy the descending chain condition so that the
number of generators of a prime ideal P bounds
c

the length of a chain of prime ideals descending
from P .
Krull topology
A topology that makes the
Galois group G(L/K) (for the Galois extension
of the ﬁeld L over the ﬁeld K) into a topological
group. A fundamental system of neighborhoods
of the ﬁeld unity element of L is obtained by
taking the set of all groups of the form G(L/M)
where M is both a subﬁeld of L and a ﬁnite
Galois extension of K.
The Krull topology is discrete if L is a ﬁnite
extension of K. This topology is named after
W. Krull, who extended Galois theory to inﬁnite
algebraic extensions and laid the foundations for
Galois cohomology theory.
k-split
A term used in several parts of linear
algebraic group theory and homology theory.
(1) Let k be an arbitrary ﬁeld. Let  denote a
universal domain containing k, that is, an alge-
braically closed ﬁeld that has inﬁnite transcen-
dence degree over k. Let Ga denote the alge-
braic group determined by the additive group of
 and let Gm denote the algebraic group deter-
mined by the multiplicative group of non-zero
elements of . Let G be a connected, solvable
k-group. Then G is k-split if it has a composi-
tion series
G = G0 ⊃G1 ⊃· · · ⊃Gn = {0}
composed of connected k-subgroups with the
property that each Gi/Gi+1 is k-isomorphic to
Gm or Ga.
(2) If a k-torus T of dimension n is k-isomor-
phic to the direct product of n copies of Gm, then
T is said to be k-split. For a k-torus, deﬁnitions
(1) and (2) are equivalent.
(3) Let A be a k-set, G be a k-group, M
be a principal homogeneous k-space for G, and
HX/k be the set of k-generic elements of the k-
components of any k-set X. For any k-mapping
h from A into G, let δh denote the k-mapping
from A × A into G deﬁned by
δh(x, y) = h(x)−1h(y),
for all (x, y) ∈HA2/k .
Recall that a one-dimensional k-cocycle f is a
k-mapping from A × A into G such that
f (x, z) = f (x, y)f (y, z),
for all (x, y, z) ∈HA3/k .
If f is a one-dimensional k-cocycle such that
there exists a k-mapping h from A × A into M
such that f = δh, then f is said to k-split in M.
This deﬁnition is used in k-cohomology.
(4) There is a similar deﬁnition used in the co-
homolgy of k-algebras involving the k-splitting
of singular extensions of k-algebras bi-modules.
(5) If G is a connected semisimple linear al-
gebraic group deﬁned over a ﬁeld k, then G is
called k-split if there is a maximal k-split torus
in G. Such a G is also said to be of Chevalley
type.

where for each i = 1, 2, . . . , r the ai are ele-

having an Abelian Galois group and the fact that
the least common multiple of the orders of ele-
ments of the Galois group is a divisor of n.
Kummer’s criterion
The German mathe-
matician E. Kummer’s attempts in the mid-19th
century to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem gave
rise to the theory of ideals and the theory of cy-
clotomic ﬁelds and led to many other theories
which are now of fundamental importance in
several areas of mathematics. Among his many
contributions to the mathematics that was devel-
oped to prove (or disprove) Fermat’s Last The-
orem, Kummer obtained congruences

has the maximum number (16) of double points
possible for a quartic surface in projective three-
dimensional space. It can be described as the
quotient variety of a two-dimensional Abelian
variety by the automorphism subgroup gener-
ated by the sign-change automorphism s(x) =

In projective three-dimensional space, the

Künneth Theorem
The theorem is formu-
lated for several different areas of mathemat-
ics. Occurring in the statement of the theorem
are one or more formulas concerning exact se-
quences known as Künneth formulas. The theo-
rem itself is sometimes called Künneth formula.
All Künneth-type formulas are related to study-
ing the theory of products (e.g., tensor products)
in homology and cohomology for various math-
ematical objects and structures. Examples fol-
low.
(1) The ﬁrst Künneth Theorem exhibits the
Künneth formula for complexes. Let A be a ring
with identity, L a complex of left A-modules and
R a complex of right A-modules. Assume that
for each n the boundary modules Bn(R) and cy-
cle modules Cn(R) are ﬂat. Then for each n

(2) The next Künneth Theorem exhibits the
isomorphism. Let A be a ring with identity. Let
L be a complex of left A-modules and R be
a complex of right A-modules.
Assume that
for each n the homology modules Hn(R) and
cycle modules Cn(R) are projective (in this case
Tor1(Hm(R) ⊗Hq(L)) = 0). Then for each n
there is an isomorphism α such that the sequence

Hm(R) ⊗Hq(L) ∼= Hn(R ⊗L) .

L
l-adic coordinate system
Let A be an Abel-
ian variety of dimension n over a ﬁeld k of char-
acteristic p ≥0. Let l be a prime number, Ql the
l-adic number ﬁeld, Zl the group of l-adic inte-
gers, and Pl the direct product of the 2n quotient
groups of Ql/Zl. Let Bl(A) denote the group
of points of A whose order is a power of l. If
l ̸= p, then Pl is isomorphic to Bl(A). The iso-
morphism yields the l-adic coordinate system of
Bl(A).
l-adic representation
Let A, B be Abelian
varieties of dimensions n and m, respectively,
over a ﬁeld k of characteristic p ≥0. Let l be a
prime number different from p and λ : A →B
a rational homomorphism.
Let Bl(A), Bl(B)
denote the group of points of A, respectively B,
whose order is a power of l and γ : Bl(A) →
Bl(B) the homomorphism induced by λ. Then
the 2m×2n matrix representation (with respect
to the l-adic coordinate system) of γ is called
the l-adic representation of λ.
Lagrange multiplier
To ﬁnd the extrema of
a function f of several variables, subject to the
constraint g = 0, one sets ∇f = λ · ∇g. The
scalar λ is called a Lagrange multiplier.
Lagrange resolvent
Let k be a ﬁeld of char-
acteristicp containingthenthrootsofunitysuch
that p does not divide n. Let k() be an exten-
sion ﬁeld of degree n over k with cyclic Galois
group. Let σ be a generator of the Galois group.
Let ζ be an nth root of unity. Then the Lagrange
resolvent, denoted by (ζ, ) is deﬁned by
(ζ, ) = 0 + ζ1 + · · · + ζ n−1n−1
where j = σ j, for each j = 1, 2, . . . , n−1
and n = σ n = 0 = .
Since σj
= j+1, for each j, the La-
grange resolvent has the property that σ(ζ, )
= ζ −1(ζ, ). This implies that σ(ζ, )n =
(ζ, )n, meaning that (ζ, )n ∈K. The j
can be determined from the equations 
ζ ζ −j
(ζ, ) = nj, since p does not divide n. So,
k() is generated by (ζ, ).
Lagrangian density
It is customary in the
ﬁelds of mathematical physics and quantum me-
chanics to honor the Italian mathematician
J.L. Lagrange (1736–1813) by using his name
or the letter L to name a certain expression (in-
volving functions of space and time variables
and their derivatives) used as integrands in varia-
tional principles describing equations of motion
and numerous ﬁeld equations describing phys-
ical phenomena. Thus, a “Lagrangian” occurs
in the statements of the “principle of least ac-
tion” (ﬁrst formulated by Euler and Lagrange for
conservative ﬁelds and by Hamilton for noncon-
servative ﬁelds), as well as in Maxwell’s equa-
tions of electromagnetic ﬁelds, relativity theory,
electron and meson ﬁelds, gravitation ﬁelds, etc.
In such systems, ﬁeld equations are regarded as
sets of elements describing a mechanical system
with inﬁnitely many degrees of freedom.
Speciﬁcally, let  ⊂Rm, [t0, t1) denote a
time interval, and f = (f 1, f 2, . . . , f n) : [t0,
t1) −→Rn denote a vector valued function.
Let L be an algebraic expression featuring sums,
differences, products, and quotients of the func-
tions of f and their time and space derivatives.
L may include some distributions. Deﬁne
L(t) =

Lanczos method of ﬁnding roots
A proce-
dure (or attitude) used in the numerical solu-
tion (especially manual) of algebraic equations
whose principal purpose is to ﬁnd a ﬁrst ap-
proximation of a root.
Then methods (espe-
cially Newton’s method) are used to improve
accuracy (by iteration). For equations with real
roots, the basic idea is to transform the equation
into one which has a root between 0 and 1; then
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

reduce the order of the equation by using an ap-
proximating function (e.g., a Chebychev poly-
nomial); solve the reduced associated equation
exactly for a root between 0 and 1 and convert
the root found back to a root of the original equa-
tion by using the transformation functions. For
complex roots the procedure is similar but ﬁnds
a root of largest modulus.
As an explicit use of the ideas consider a
cubic equation with real coefﬁcients a, b, c, d
(with ad ̸= 0)
ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0 .
First change the polynomial to a monic polyno-
mial
x3 + b1x2 + c1x + d1 = 0
where b1 = b/a, c1 = c/a, d1 = d/a.
If
d1 > 0, transform the equation by replacing x
everywhere by −x obtaining
x3 + b2x2 + c2x −d2 = 0 ,
with d2 > 0, where b2 = −b1, c2 = c1, d2 =
d1. Now, by dividing by d2 and setting y =
x/ 3√d2, b3 = b2/ 3√d2, c3 = c2/( 3√d2)2, one
gets the equation
y3 + b3y2 + c3y −1 = 0 .
Now f (0) < 0.
Also, for large positive y,
f (y) > 0. If f (1) > 0, there is a root be-
tween 0 and 1. If f (1) < 0, there is a root > 1.
In this case substitute t = 1/y into the equation
obtaining
t3 −c3t2 −b3t −1 = 0 .
In either case, substitute for t3 or y3 the quadrat-
ic term of the Chebychev polynomial
t3 = (1/32)

48t2 −18t + 1

and solve the resulting quadratic equation ex-
actly.
Discard any negative root and use the
remaining root. Convert it back to the origi-
nal equation using all the conversions. This is
the Lanczos method for cubic equations. There
are Lanczos methods for fourth and higher de-
gree equations with real coefﬁcients and ones
for complex coefﬁcients.
Lanczos method of matrix transformation
In the numerical solution of eigenvalue prob-
lems of linear differential and integral operators,
matrix transformations play a fundamental role.
Lanczos’ method, named after C. Lanczos who
introduced it in 1950, was developed as an iter-
ative method for a nonsymmetric matrix A and
involves a series of similarity transformations
to reduce the matrix A to a tri-diagonal matrix
T with the same (but more easily calculable)
eigenvalues as A.
Speciﬁcally, given an n × n matrix A, a tri-
diagonal matrix T is constructed so that T =
S−1AS. Assume that the n columns of S are
denoted by x1, x2, . . . , xn which will be deter-
mined so as to be linearly independent. Assume
that the main diagonal of matrix T = {tij} is de-
noted by tii = bi for i = 1, 2, . . . , n; the super-
diagonal tii+1 = ci for i = 1, 2, . . . , n −1; and
the subdiagonal tii−1 = di, for i = 2, 3, . . . , n.
In this method the di will all be 1. The method
consists of constructing a sequence {yi} of vec-
tors such that yT
i xi = 0, if i ̸= j.
Let x0, y0, c0 be zero vectors and let x1 and
y1 be chosen arbitrarily. Deﬁne {xk} and {yk}
recursively, by
xk+1
=
Axk −bkxk −ck−1xk−1 ,

choice of x1 and y1 so that yT

of the method is due to a possible breakdown in
this biorthogonalization of the sequences {xi}

tioned. The numerical procedure is likely to be
unstable, for example, when yT
i xi is small.
For symmetric matrices with x1 = y1 the

the numerical stability is comparable to either
Givens’ or Householder’s methods resulting in
the same tri-diagonal matrix — but with more
cost in deriving it.

Laplace Expansion Theorem
A theorem
concerning the ﬁnite sum of certain products of
determinants of submatrices of a given square
matrix. The theorem delineates which products
yieldasumequaltothedeterminantofthewhole
matrix, so the expansions described are com-
monly used to evaluate determinants.
Let A be an n × n matrix with elements
from a commutative ring, where it can be as-
sumed that n > 1. Let A have elements ai j
where i denotes the row and j the column. Let
1 ≤r < n. Suppose r rows of A, denoted by
i1, i2, . . . , ir are chosen where it is assumed (al-
ways) that i1 < i2 < · · · < ir (lexicographic
ordering).
See lexicographic linear ordering.
Let R denote this lexicographically ordered r-
tuple (i1, i2, . . . , ir). Suppose also that r col-
umns j1, j2, . . . , jr are chosen (lexicographi-
cally ordered). Let C be this lexicographically
orderedr-tuple(j1, j2, . . . , jr). Bychoosingel-
ements of A from the chosen rows and columns,
an r × r submatrix AR C = (bm n) = (aim jn)
is determined. If R′ denotes the lexicograph-
ically ordered (n −r)-tuple ir+1, ir+2, . . . , in
consisting of the rows of A not chosen and
C′ the columns not chosen, then AR′ C′ is an
(n −r) × (n −r) submatrix.
Let λR C =
i1 + i2 + · · · + ir + j1 + j2 + · · · + jr. Finally,
let S be any lexicographically ordered r-tuple
chosen from the n numbers 1, 2, . . . , n. Then
the Laplace Expansion Theorem says:

C
(−1)λR C det (AR C) det (AS′ C′) = det(A)
if R = S (and = 0, if R ̸= S), where the sum is
taken over the


selection of columns C. Also,

if R = S (and = 0, if R ̸= S), where the
sum is taken over the


selection of rows R.
The summations resulting in the sum det(A) are
called Laplace expansions of the determinant. If
r = 1, the “usual” expansion of a determinant
is obtained.
large semigroup algebra
Let R be a com-
mutative ring, S a semigroup, and RS the set
of sequences of elements of R where in each
sequence only a ﬁnite number of elements is
different from zero. Then RS is the direct sum
of isomorphic copies of R using S as the index
set. A canonical basis of RS consists of {bi}i ∈S
where for a given i ∈S, bi has the component
indexed by i equal to 1 and the rest of the com-
ponents equal to 0. The product
bi bj = bij
for all i, j ∈S
determines the multiplication in RS and makes
RS into an algebra called a semigroup algebra
of S over R. Now suppose S has the property
that for any s ∈S there are only a ﬁnite number
of pairs {i, j} of elements of S such that s = ij.
If one deﬁnes multiplication of sequences α =
{αi} and β = {βj} of RS to be γ = {γk} where
γk =

k=ij
αiβj,
k ∈S ,
then the resulting algebra is called a large semi-
group algebra and contains RS as a subalgebra.
largest nilpotent ideal
The nilpotent ideal
which is the union of all nilpotent ideals of a Lie
algebra deﬁned on a commutative ring with unit.
In a left Artinian ring, the radical is nilpotent and
is the largest nilpotent ideal. In a left Noetherian
ring, the prime radical is the largest nilpotent
left ideal. For a ring which has the property

that every nonempty set of left ideals contains a
minimal element (with respect to inclusion), the
Jacobson radical is the largest nilpotent ideal.
lattice
(1) A system consisting of a set S
together with a partial ordering ≤on S and two
binary operations ∧and ∨deﬁned on S such
that, for all a, b, c ∈S,
a ∨b ≤c if and only if (a ≤c and b ≤c) ,
and
c ≤a ∧b if and only if (c ≤a and c ≤b) .
The element a ∨b is called the supremum
of a and b and the element a ∧b is called the
inﬁmum of a and b.
The set of all subsets of a nonempty set S
ordered by the subset relation together with the
operations of set union and set intersection form
a lattice. The whole numbers, ordered by the
relation divides, together with the operations of
greatest common divisor and least common mul-
tiple, form a lattice. The real numbers, ordered
by the relation less than or equal to, together
with the operations of maximum and minimum,
form a lattice.
(2) Let Rn denote the set of all n-tuples of
real numbers.
Let Rn be endowed with the
(usual) Euclidean metric space structure. Call

n-dimensional real vector space deﬁned over R
by adding componentwise and multiplying by
scalars componentwise. Let Z denote the set of

law
A property, statement, rule, or theorem in
a mathematical theory usually considered to be
fundamental or intrinsic to the theory or govern-
ing the objects of the theory. Elementary exam-
ples include commutative, associative, distribu-
tive,
and
trichotomy
laws
of
arithmetic,
DeMorgan’s laws in mathematical logic or set
theory, and laws of sines, cosines, or tangents in
trigonometry.
Law of Quadrants
Also called rule of spe-
cies. In spherical trigonometry, if ABC is a right
spherical triangle, with right angle C and sides
a, b, and c (measured in terms of the angle at
the center of the sphere subtended by the side),
then: (i.) if a and A are both acute or both ob-
tuse angles (said to be of like species), then so
are b and B; (ii.) if c < 90◦, then a and b are of
like species; (iii.) if c > 90◦, then a and b are
of unlike species.
This law is used whenever one has a formula
which gives two possible values for the sine of
the side or angle, since it indicates whether the
side or angle is acute or obtuse.
Law of Signs
In arithmetic, a rule for sim-
plifying expressions where two (or more) plus
(“+”) or minus (“−”) signs appear together. The
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

rule is to change two occurrences of the same
sign to a “+” and to change two occurrences of
opposite signs to a “−.”
In using the Law of Signs, one is ignoring the
different usages of the minus sign; namely, for
subtraction, for additive inverse, and to denote
“negative.” The same is true for the plus sign;
namely, for addition and to denote “positive.”
Thus, x −(−y) or x −−y becomes x + y;
x + (−y) or x + −y becomes x −y; 4 −−3
becomes 4+3; 4+ −3 becomes 4−3; x +(+y)
or x + +y becomes x + y, etc.
Law of Tangents
In plane trigonometry, a ra-
tio relationship between the lengths of sides of
a triangle and tangents of its angles. For a trian-
gle ABC, where A, B, and C represent vertices
(and angles) and a, b, and c represent, respec-
tively, the sides opposite the angles,
a −b
a + b = tan 1
2(A −B)
tan 1
2(A + B)
.
Laws of Cosines
In plane and spherical trigo-
nometry, relationships between the lengths of
sides of a triangle and cosines of its angles. For
a triangle ABC in plane trigonometry, where
A, B, and C represent vertices (and angles) and
a, b, and c represent, respectively, the sides op-
posite the angles,
c2 = a2 + b2 −2 a b cos(C) .
Here, the length of a side is determined by the
lengths of the other two sides and the cosine of
the angle included between those sides.
In spherical trigonometry, using the above
designations for the angles and for the sides
(measured in terms of the angle at the center
of the sphere subtended by the side), there are
two relationships:
cos(C) = −cos(A) cos(B)
+ sin(A) sin(B) cos(c)
and
cos(c) = cos(a) cos(b)+sin(a) sin(b) cos(C) .
Laws of Sines
In plane and spherical trigo-
nometry, the ratio relationship between the
lengths of sides of a triangle and sines of its
angles. For a triangle ABC in plane trigonom-
etry, where A, B, and C represent vertices (and
angles) and a, b, and c represent, respectively,
the sides opposite the angles,
a
sin(A) =
b
sin(B) =
c
sin(C) .
In spherical trigonometry, using the same
designations for the angles and for the sides
(measured in terms of the angle at the center
of the sphere subtended by the side),
sin(a)
sin(A) = sin(b)
sin(B) = sin(c)
sin(C) .
leading coefﬁcient
The nonzero coefﬁcient
of the highest order term of a polynomial in a
polynomial ring. In the expression
anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 ,
an is the leading coefﬁcient. There are situations
when it is appropriate to consider an expression
when the leading coefﬁcient is zero. In this case,
such a coefﬁcient is called a formal leading co-
efﬁcient.
least common denominator
In arithmetic,
the least common multiple of the denominators
of a set of rational numbers. See least common
multiple.
least common multiple
(1) In number the-
ory, if a and b are two integers, a least common
multiple of a and b, denoted by lcm{a, b}, is a
positive integer c such that a and b are each di-
visors of c (which makes c a common multiple
of a and b), and such that c divides any other
common multiple of a and b. The product of
the least common multiple and positive greatest
common divisor of two positive integers a and
b is equal to the product of a and b.
The concept can be extended to a set of more
than two nonzero integers. Also, the deﬁnition
can be extended to a ring where a least common
multiple of a ﬁnite set of nonzero elements of the
ring is an element of the ring which is a common
multiple of elements in the set and which is also
a factor of any other common multiple.

Lefschetz Duality Theorem
Let X be a com-
pact n-dimensional manifold with boundary ˙X
and orientation U over the ring R. For all R-
modules G and non-negative integers q there
exist isomorphisms
Hq(X; G) ←Hq(X \ ˙X; G) →H n−q(X, ˙X; G)
and
Hq(X, ˙X; G) →H n−q(X\ ˙X; G) ←H n−q(X; G).

Lefschetz ﬁxed-point formula
One of the
main properties of the l-adic cohomology. It
counts the number of ﬁxed points for a mor-
phism on an algebraic variety or scheme.
Let X be a smooth and proper scheme of ﬁ-
nite type of dimension n deﬁned over an alge-
braically closed ﬁeld k of characteristic p ≥0.
Let l be a prime number different from p. Let
Ql be the quotient ﬁeld of the ring of l-adic
integers.
For each nonnegative integer i, let
H i(X, Ql) denote the l-adic cohomology of X.
Let f : X −→X be a morphism that has iso-
lated ﬁxed points each of multiplicity one. Let
f ∗be the induced map on the cohomology of X.
Let Tr be the trace mapping. Then the number

Lefschetz number
(1) A concept applica-
ble in several ﬁelds of mathematics, ﬁrst intro-
ducedin1923byS.Lefschetz(1884–1972)after
whom it is named. The idea is as follows. Let
X be a topological space. Let f : X →X
be a continuous map. For each nonnegative in-
teger k, f induces a homomorphism fk of the
homology group Hk(X; Q) (with coefﬁcients in
the rational number ﬁeld Q). If the ranks of the
homology groups (considered as vector spaces
over Q) are ﬁnite, then there is a matrix repre-
sentation for each fk and a trace tk of the matrix
which is an invariant of fk. The Lefschetz num-
ber of f , denoted by L(f ), is then given by
L(f ) =
∞

k=0
(−1)ktk .
If everything is well deﬁned, then L(f ) is an in-
teger and, if different from zero, guarantees that
f has a ﬁxed point. Everything will be well de-
ﬁned, forexampleifX isaﬁnitecomplex. Alter-
natives for X include a chain or cochain complex
of free Abelian groups (f an endomorphism of
degree 0) or a ﬁnite polyhedron of degree n with
integral coefﬁcients (f continuous, sum from 0
to n). There is a similar result if X is a closed
orientable manifold. Also, if f is the identity
map, then L(f ) is the Euler characteristic.
(2)ForcomplexnormalAbelianvarieties, the
difference between the second Betti number and
the Picard number is sometimes called a Lef-
schetz number.
Lefschetz pencil
Let X be a smooth com-
plete (thus projective) algebraic variety over an
inﬁnite algebraically closed ﬁeld k. In the the-
ory of algebraic varieties it can be shown that
there is a birational morphism
π : ˜X −→X
from a smooth complete (projective) variety ˜X
and a mapping
f : ˜X −→P1
k
that is singular at most a ﬁnite number of points.
An inverse image f −1(x) is called a ﬁber and
contains at most one singular point which, if it
exists, is an ordinary double point. The family
of ﬁbers is called a Lefschetz pencil of X. Some-
times the map f is called a Lefschetz pencil. In
the theory establishing the existence of ˜X, it is
shown that ﬁbers are hyperplane sections of X.
Sometimes it is said that Lefschetz pencils “ﬁber
a variety.”

Lefschetz pencils are involved in the proof of
the Weil conjecture. They are named in honor of
S. Lefschetz (1884–1972) who studied, among
many other things, nonsingular projective sur-
faces.
left A-module
Let A be a ring. A left A-
module is a commutative group G, together with
a mapping from A×G into G, called scalar mul-
tiplication and denoted here by juxtaposition,
satisfying for all x, y ∈G and all r, s ∈A:
1x = x ,
r(x + y) = rx + ry ,
(r + s)x = rx + sx ,
and
(rs)x = r(sx) .
Right
A-modules
are
deﬁned
similarly.
Sometimes the term left or right is omitted. If
the ring is denoted by R, then the terminology
is left R-module. If addition and scalar multipli-
cation are just the ring operations, then the ring
itself can be regarded as a left A-module. If the
ring is a ﬁeld, then the modules are the vector
spaces over the ﬁeld.
left annihilator
The left annihilator of an
ideal S of an algebra A (over a ﬁeld k) is a set
{a ∈A : aS = 0} .
The left annihilator is an ideal of A. Similarly,
the left annihilator of S in R where S is a subset
of an R-module M (where R is a ring) is the set
{r ∈R : rS = 0} .
left Artinian ring
A ring having the property
that (considered as a left module over itself) ev-
ery nonempty set of submodules (meaning left
ideals in this context) has a minimal element.
For such a ring, any descending chain of left
ideals is ﬁnite. Compare with left Noetherian
ring.
For a left Artinian ring, the radical is the
largest nilpotent ideal.
See largest nilpotent
ideal. For a left Artinian ring, any left module
is Artinian if and only if it is Noetherian.
ArtinianringsarenamedafterE.Artin(1898–
1962).
left balanced functor
Let R1, R2, and R be
rings. Let CR1, CR2, and CR be categories of
R1-modules, R2-modules, and R-modules, re-
spectively. Let T : CR1 × CR2 →CR be an
additive functor that is covariant in the ﬁrst vari-
able and contravariant in the second variable.
Let A ∈CR1. Let AT : CR2 −→CR be the
functor deﬁned by
AT (B) = T (A, B) for all B ∈CR2 .
Let B ∈CR2. Let TB : CR1 −→CR be the
functor deﬁned by
TB(A) = T (A, B) for all A ∈CR1 .
Then T is called left balanced if (i.) AT is exact
for each projective module A ∈CR1 and (ii.) TB
is exact for each injective module B ∈CR2.
The deﬁnition can be extended to additive
functors T of several variables (some of which
are covariant and some contravariant) as fol-
lows. T is called left balanced if: (i.) T be-
comes an exact functor of the remaining vari-
ables whenever any one of the covariant vari-
ablesisreplacedbyaprojectivemodule; and(ii.)
T becomes an exact functor of the remaining
variables whenever any one of the contravariant
variables is replaced by an injective module.
left coset
Any set, denoted by aS, of all left
multiples as of the elements s of a subgroup S
of a group G and a ﬁxed element a of G. Every
left coset of S has the same cardinality as S. For
each subgroup S of G, the group G is partitioned
into its left cosets, so that for a ﬁnite group the
number of elements in the group (order) is a
multiple of the order of each of its subgroups.
left derived functor
Let R1, R2, and R be
rings. Let CR1, CR2, and CR be categories of R1-
modules, R2-modules, and R-modules, respec-
tively. Let T : CR1 × CR2 →CR be an additive
functor that is covariant in the ﬁrst variable and
contravariant in the second variable. Let X be a
deﬁnite projective resolution for each module A
of CR1 and let Y be a deﬁnite injective resolution
for each module B of CR2. From homology the-
ory, T (X, Y) is a well-deﬁned complex which
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

can be regarded as being over T (A, B). Also,
because of the homotopies involved, up to natu-
ral isomorphisms, T (X, Y) is independent of the
chosen resolutions X and Y and depends only on
A and B. Therefore, the nth homology modules
Hn(T (X, Y)) are functions of A and B.
If f : A −→A′ and g : B′ −→B, there
exist chain transformations F : X −→X′ and
G : Y ′ −→Y over f and g. Any two such are
homotopic. The induced chain transformation
T (f, g) : T (X, Y) −→T (X′, Y ′)
is determined up to homotopy, is independent
of the choice of F and G, and depends only on
f and g. This yields a well-deﬁned homomor-
phism
Hn(T (X, Y)) −→Hn(T (X′, Y ′)) .
Deﬁne the nth left derived functor LnT :
CR1 × CR2 →CR by
LnT (A, B) = Hn(T (X, Y))
and let LnT (f, g) be the well-deﬁned homo-
morphism of the last paragraph
LnT (f, g) : LnT (A, B) −→LnT (A′, B′) .
leftglobaldimension
ForaringAwithunity,
the supremum of the set of projective (or homo-
logical) dimensions (i.e., the set of minima of
the lengths of left projective resolutions) of el-
ements of the category of left A-modules. It
is also equal to the inﬁmum of the set of in-
jective dimensions of the category. A theorem
of Auslander (1955) shows that the left global
dimension is also the supremum of the set of
projective dimensions of ﬁnitely generated left
A-modules. As simple examples of left global
dimension, the left global dimension of the in-
tegers is 1, while the left global dimension of a
ﬁeld is 0. See projective dimension, homologi-
cal dimension, injective dimension.
left G-set
Let G be a group with identity e
and juxtaposition denoting the group operation.
Let S be a set. Let p : G × S →S satisfy, for
each x ∈S,
p(ab, x) = p(a, p(b, x))
and
p(e, x) = x .
Then S is called a left G-set and G is said to act
on S from the left. If juxtaposition ax is used
for the value p(a, x), then the two conditions
become (ab)x = a(bx), ex = x.
left hereditary ring
A ring in which every
left ideal is projective. Alternately, a ring whose
left global dimension is less than or equal to one.
See left global dimension.
If a ring A is left hereditary, every submodule
of a free A-module is a direct sum of modules
isomorphic to left ideals of A. The converse is
also true.
left ideal
A nonempty subset L of a ring R
such that whenever x and y are in L and r is in
R, x−y and rx are in L. For example, if R is the
ring of n × n real matrices, the matrices whose
ﬁrst column is identically zero is a left ideal.
Ideals play a role in ring theory analogous to
the role played by normal subgroups in group
theory.
left invariant
Used in various ﬁelds to indi-
cate not being altered or changed by a transfor-
mation, usually a left translation. For example,
(in linear algebra) a subalgebra S of a linear al-
gebra A is called left invariant if S contains, for
any x ∈S, all left multiples ax for each a ∈A.
If the linear algebra A has a unity element, then
the left invariant subalgebra is a left ideal. In Lie
group theory and transformation group theory
there are left invariant measures, left invariant
integrals, left invariant densities, left invariant
tensor ﬁelds, etc.
left inverse element
Let S be a nonempty set
on which is deﬁned an associative binary oper-
ation, say ∗. Assume that there is a left identity
element e in the set with respect to ∗. Let a de-
note any element of the set S. Then a left inverse
element of a is an element b of S such that
b ∗a = e .
If every element of the set described above
has a left inverse element, then the set is called
a group. For a group, a left inverse element is
unique and is also a right inverse element. For
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

commutative groups, the inverse element of a is
usually denoted by −a. Otherwise, the notation
a−1 is used. An element that has a left inverse
is sometimes called left invertible.
left Noetherian ring
A ring having the prop-
erty that (considered as a left module over itself)
every nonempty set of submodules (meaning left
ideals in this context) has a maximal element.
For such a ring, any ascending chain of left ide-
als is ﬁnite. Compare with left Artinian ring.
For a left Noetherian ring, the prime radical
is the largest nilpotent ideal. See largest nilpo-
tent ideal. For a left Noetherian ring, any left
module is Artinian if and only if it is Noethe-
rian.
Noetherian rings are named after A.E.
Noether (1882–1935).
left order
Let g be an integral domain in
which every ideal is uniquely decomposed into
a product of principal ideals (i.e., a Dedekind
domain). Let F be the ﬁeld of quotients of g.
Let A be a separable algebra of ﬁnite degree
over F. Let L be a g-lattice of A. Then the set
{x ∈A : xL ⊂L} is an order of A called a left
order of A. See order. See also ZG-lattice.
left projective resolution
A left resolution
X of an A-module M (where A is a ring with
unity) such that each Xn in the exact sequence
· · · →Xn →Xn−1 →· · · →X0 →M →0
is a projective A-module, and is called a left pro-
jective resolution of M. See also left resolution.
left regular representation
Let R be a ring,
M a left R-module, and HomZ(M, M) the ring
of module endomorphisms (where M is viewed
as a module over Z). For each r ∈R, let ρr :
M −→M be a left translation (i.e., ρr(x) = rx
for all x ∈M).
If the ring homomorphism
ρ : R →HomZ(M, M), given by ρ(r) = ρr for
all r ∈M is an injection, then ρ is called a left
regular representation of R in HomZ(M, M).
Left (and right) regular representations are very
important tools in ring theory with many appli-
cations throughout the theory.
left resolution
Let A be a ring with unit and
M an A-module. If the sequence

have the property that the composition ∂k∂k+1 =

of homomorphisms ϵk : Xk →M such that

lution of M. This concept is used in homology

left satellite
Let R1 and R be rings.
Let
CR1 and CR be categories of R1-modules and R-
modules, respectively. Let T : CR1 →CR be an
additive functor. A left satellite of T is an ad-
ditive functor deﬁned over the same categories
as T and having the same variance (contra- or
co-). Once one left satellite of T (to be denoted
by S1T ) is determined, a sequence {SnT } of left
satellites may be deﬁned by iteration.
In order to deﬁne the functor S1T by describ-
ing its action on modules and homomorphisms,
some background notation and remarks on ho-
mology theory need to be presented. Left satel-
lites may be deﬁned for covariant functors and
contravariant functors. Here, the procedure for
creating a left satellite from a covariant functor
will be described in some detail, with the cor-
responding procedure for contravariant functors
only sketched. There is also a parallel develop-
ment for right satellites.
Let A be an R1-module.
From homology
theory, it is always possible to construct an exact
sequence
0 →M
α→P
β→A →0
with P projective. For what follows, since the
module S1T (A) (to be deﬁned) is only unique
within isomorphism (with respect to the choice
of P), a particular choice of exact sequence
needs to be prescribed (which can always be
done).
(i.) Suppose T is covariant. Let A ∈CR1.
Let T (α) : T (M) →T (P). Deﬁne S1T (A) to
be Ker(T (α)). Then the sequence
0 →S1T →T (M) →T (P)
c

is exact. Let A, A′ ∈CR1. Let g : A →A′.
Then there are exact sequences

α→P
β→A →0

(withP andP ′ projective)andahomomorphism
f : P →P ′ such that gβ = β′f . f deﬁnes
uniquely a homomorphism f ′ : M →M′ such
that f α = α′f ′. One then gets the commutative
diagram
T (M)
T (α)

T (P)
↓T (f ′)

−→T (P ′) .
T (f ′) induces a homomorphism
(g) : Ker(T (α)) →Ker(T (α′)) .
It can be shown that (g) is independent of the
choice of f . Deﬁne
S1T (g) : S1(A) −→S1(A′)
by S1T (g) = (g). With this deﬁnition, S1T
becomes a covariant functor called the left satel-
lite of T .
(ii.) If T is contravariant, the procedure starts
with an exact sequence
0 →A
β→Q
α→N →0 ,
with Q injective. Similar reasoning to the co-
variant case yields S1T (A) = Ker(T (α)) where
T (α) : T (N) −→T (Q) and S1T (g) : S1T (A′)
−→S1T (A). Here, S1T is contravariant.
(iii.) ThesequenceoffunctionSnT isdeﬁned
recursively from the exact sequences

and

with P projective and Q injective as follows:

S1T as given above .
If T is covariant,
Sn+1T (A) = SnT (M)),
n ≥1 .
If T is contravariant,
Sn+1T (A) = SnT (N)),
n ≥1 .
Left satellites may also be deﬁned for general
Abelian categories in a similar fashion.

Compare with left hereditary ring.
Every regular ring is left semihereditary (and

Lehmer’s method of ﬁnding roots
A meth-
od, developed in 1960 by D.H. Lehmer, for ﬁnd-
ingnumericalapproximationstothe(realorcom-
plex, simple or multiple) roots of a polynomial
using a digital computer. Lehmer’s method pro-
vides a single algorithm for automatic computa-
tion applicable for all polynomials, in contrast to
other methods, the choice of which, for a partic-
ular polynomial, is dependent on human judg-
ment, experience, and intervention.
Lehmer’s method includes a test for deter-
mining whether or not the given polynomial has
a root inside a given circle. The test is applied
at each iteration of the process (to be described
next) on circles of decreasing size.
Assume that zero is not a root. Starting (in
the complex plane) with the circle with center
0 and radius 1 apply the test to look for a root
inside the circle. If one is found, halve the radius
and retest for the smaller circle. If a root is not
found, double the radius and apply the test. In a
ﬁnite number of steps, an annulus
{x : R < |z| < 2R}
will be determined (where R is a power of 2) that
contains a root in the disk of radius 2R but not
in the disk of radius R. Next, cover the annulus
c

with8overlappingdisksofradius5R/6andcen-
ters (5R/3) exp(2πi/8), for k = 0, 1, . . . , 7.
Test each of the 8 circles until a root is found
trapped in a new annulus centered at (say) α
with radii R1, 2R1
{x : R1 < |z −α| < 2R1} ,
with R1 =

6(2s) for some s. The new annulus
is similarly covered by 8 disks and tested. After
(say) k iterations of this process, one gets a circle
ofradius≤2(5/12)k whichcontainsaroot. One
continues until a prescribed accuracy is reached.
The strength of Lehmer’s method is its uni-
versality. The weakness is the rate of conver-
gence of the method which in practice may be
several times slower than less general methods
developed for speciﬁc types of roots.
length of module
The common number of
quotients Mi/Mi+1 of submodules of a module
M over a ring R in a Jordan-Hölder or compo-
sition series
M = M0 ⊃M1 ⊃· · · ⊃Ms = {0}
of M, if M has such a series. Any such chain
has the same number of terms. A necessary and
sufﬁcient condition that M have such a series
is that it be both Artinian and Noetherian. See

rian module.
Leopoldt’s conjecture
The assertion in the
study of algebraic number ﬁelds that the Zp-
rank of the p-adic closure of the group of units
of a number ﬁeld is the same as the Z-rank of the
group of units. This conjecture is an open ques-
tion in many cases. There are Abelian analogs
of the conjecture and analogs for function ﬁelds
of characteristic p. The conjecture is named af-
ter H.W. Leopoldt, an extensive contributor to
the study of p-adic L-functions.

level structure
A notion occurring in the
study of modulii spaces of Abelian varieties.
Usually a letter intrinsic to the variety discussed
is appended to the term.
(1) Let A be an Abelian variety of dimension
n over a ﬁeld k of characteristic p ≥0. Let m be
a positive integer that is not a multiple of p. An
m-level structure with respect to A is a set of 2n
points on A which form a basis for the abstract
group Bm(A) of points of order m on A.
(2) For polarized complex Abelian varieties,
the concept of a level structure can be consid-
ered as a replacement of all or part of the concept
of a symplectic basis. If the variety is of type
D, then the D-level structure for the variety is a
certain symplectic isomorphism.
There are generalized level m-structures, or-
thogonal level D structures, etc. The precise
deﬁnitions are quite detailed and require consid-
erable background and notational development.
Thus, they will not be given here. The associ-
ated modulii spaces for polarized Abelian vari-
eties with level structures are used in studying
properties of geometry and arithmetic.
Levi decomposition
Let g be a ﬁnite dimen-
sional Lie algebra over the ﬁeld of real or com-
plex numbers. Let radg denote the Lie subal-
gebra of g, called the radical of g. (See radi-
cal.) Let l be any subalgebra of g. Then the
direct sum of vector spaces radg and l (radg ⊕l)
forms a Lie subalgebra of g. If l exists such that
radg ⊕l = g, then the sum radg ⊕l is called
the Levi decomposition of g. The decomposi-
tion is named after E.E. Levi. The subalgebra
l involved in the splitting is called a Levi sub-
algebra of g. A theorem of Levi (1905) states
that g has such a decomposition and a theorem
by Malcev (1942) establishes the uniqueness of
the decomposition.
There is a similar Levi (product) decompo-
sition in algebraic group theory given by G =
RadG×H where G is an algebraic group, RadG
is a unipotent radical of G, and H is an alge-
braic subgroup of G called the reductive Levi
subgroup of G. It is useful in reducing many
problems to the study of reductive groups.
Levi subgroup
Let G be a Lie group. Let
RadG denote the radical of G. A Lie subgroup
L of G is called a Levi subgroup of G if (i.) the
identity imbedding of L into G is a Lie group
homomorphism, (ii.) G = (RadG) L, (iii.) the
dimension of (RadG) ∩L is zero. If the Lie

lexicographic linear ordering
Sometimes
called dictionary order, an ordering which treats
numbers as if they were letters in a dictionary.
Suppose, for example, S is a set of monomials
of degree n in m variables: that is,
S =


xk1
1 xk2
2 . . . xkm
m :
m


then xk1
1 xk2
2 . . . xkm
m is less than or equal to (≤)
xl1
1 xl2
2 . . . xlm
m if the ﬁrst nonzero difference of
corresponding exponents kj −lj satisﬁes kj −
lj ≤0. For example,
x1x2x2
3x3
4 ≤x1x2x3
3x4 ≤x2
1x4
2x3x4 .
A lexicographic ordering for the ﬁeld of com-
plex numbers C is deﬁned as follows: if z1 =
x1 + y1i, z2 = x2 + y2i ∈C, then z1 ≤z2 if
and only if
(x1 ≤x2) or (x1 = x2 and y1 ≤y2) .
Since in both of these cases the order ≤is re-
ﬂexive, antisymmetric, transitive, and satisﬁes
the trichotomy law, the order is a linear order, so
the order is called a lexicographic linear order.
More generally, if O1, O2, . . . , Om are ordered
sets, the product set p = m
j=1 Oj is given a
lexicographic ordering < as follows: if a =
(a1, a2, . . . , am) and b = (b1, b2, . . . , bm) ∈
p, then a < b if and only if the ﬁrst non-zero
difference of corresponding coordinates aj −
bj < 0. When each Oj is linearly ordered, so
is p.
L-function
Generally, a function of a com-
plex variable that generalizes the Riemann ζ-
function. L-functions are meromorphic on the
complex numbers C, exhibit both a Dirichlet se-
ries expansion and a Euler product expansion,
and satisfy similar functional equations. Some
generalizations of the ζ-function retain the ζ
identiﬁer instead of an L. L-functions are im-
portant in the analytic study of the arithmetic
of objects in their corresponding mathematical
structures, including rational number ﬁelds, al-
gebraic number ﬁelds, algebraic varieties over
ﬁnite ﬁelds, representations of Galois groups,
p-adic number ﬁelds, etc.
(1) The most direct generalization of the Rie-
mann ζ-function is the Dirichlet L-function. Let
Z denote the integers. Let m ∈Z with m > 0.
Let χ : Z −→C be a Dirichlet character mod-
ulo m (i.e., χ ̸= 0, χ(a) = 0 if a and m are
not relatively prime, χ(ab) = χ(a)χ(b), and
χ(a + m) = χ(a)). Let s ∈C with Re(s) > 1.
Deﬁne L(s) as
L(s) =
∞

n=1
χ(n)

.
The deﬁnition exhibits the Dirichlet series ex-
pansion which converges absolutely and makes
L a holomorphic function for ℜ(s) > 1. It is
equal to the Euler product

p

ps
over primes p. It can be extended as a mero-
morphic function over C. If χ is deﬁned to be
identically 1, the Riemann ζ-function itself is
obtained. The two functions have many sim-
ilar properties. For example, the study of the
location of zeroes of the L-function leads to a
generalized Riemann hypothesis.
(2) Hecke L-functions and Hecke L-functions
with grössencharakters are generalizations of
the Dirichlet L-functions to algebraic number
ﬁelds. Other L-functions that can be considered
generalizations of these include those of Artin
and Weil involving Galois extensions of an al-
gebraic number ﬁeld. There are L-functions as-
sociated with algebraic varieties deﬁned over ﬁ-
nite ﬁelds, p-adic L-functions deﬁned over the
p-adic number ﬁeld Qp, and automorphic L-
functions deﬁned both for the general linear
group and for arbitrary reductive matrix groups.
See Hecke L-function, Artin L-function, Weil
L-function.
(3) A separate meaning of L-function occurs
in the area of mathematical analysis where an
L-function is deﬁned as a continuous function
f : [a.b]×Kn −→Kn (where [a, b] is a closed
real interval and Kn denotes complex Euclidean
n-space) that is uniformly Lipschitzian in the
second variable, i.e., there is a constant L, the
Lipschitz constant of f , such that, for all t ∈
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

[a, b], x ∈Kn, y ∈Kn we have
∥f (t, x) −f (t, y)∥≤L∥x −y∥.
In such a circumstance, the initial value problem
dx
dt = f (t, x),
x(a) = c
has a unique solution for all c ∈Kn.
Lie algebra
A theory named after the Norwe-
gian mathematician M.S. Lie (1842–1899) who
pioneered the study of what are now called Lie
Groups.
Over a commutative ring with unit K, a Lie
algebraisaK-moduletogetherwithaK-module
homomorphism x ⊗y →[x, y] of L ⊗L into
L such that, for all x, y, z ∈L,
[x, x] = 0
and
[x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]] = 0 .
The product [x, y] is called a bracket product
and is an alternating bilinear function. The sec-
ond equation is called the Jacobi identity.
An example of a Lie Algebra is obtained for
an associative algebra L over K by deﬁning
[x, y] = xy −yx .
Lie algebra of Lie group
There are three
Lie algebras that are called a Lie algebra of a
Lie group G. (See Lie algebra.)
(1) The Lie algebra of all left invariant deriva-
tions on G with the bracket product [D1, D2]
deﬁned for two derivations D!, D2 as D1D2 −
D2D1.
(2) The Lie algebra of all left invariant vector
ﬁelds on G with the bracket product of two left
invariant vector ﬁelds X and Y deﬁned using the
natural isomorphism between the vector space
of left invariant vector ﬁelds and the vector space
of left derivations of G.
(3) The Lie algebra of all tangent vectors to
G at e with the bracket product between tangent
vectors deﬁned using the natural isomorphism
between the space of left invariant vector ﬁelds
of G and the space of tangent vectors of G at e.
The fact that the three Lie algebras deﬁned
above are isomorphic allows some ﬂexibility in
applications of the theory.
Liegroup
AgroupG, togetherwiththestruc-
ture of a differentiable manifold over the real or
complex number ﬁeld, such that the functions
f : G × G →G and g : G →G deﬁned
by f (x, y) = xy and g(x) = x−1 are differen-
tiable.
The additive groups of the ﬁelds of real or
complex numbers are Lie groups. The group of
invertible n×n matrices over the real or complex
number ﬁelds is a Lie group.
In addition to providing a thriving branch of
mathematics, Lie groups are used in many mod-
ern physical theories including that of gravita-
tion and quantum mechanics.
Lie-Kolchin Theorem
Let V be a ﬁnite di-
mensional vector space over a ﬁeld k. Let G
be a connected solvable linear algebraic group.
Let GL(V ) be the general linear group.
Let
f : G →GL(V ) be a linear representation.
Then f (G) can be put into triangular form.

V invariant. (ii.) Then there exists a basis in
V in which elements of f (G) can be written as

This theorem has been generalized by
Mal’tsev.
Lie’s Theorem
There are several theorems
which bear the name and honor the Norwe-
gian mathematician M.S. Lie (1842–1899) who,
among other things, founded the theory of Lie
groups. For solvable Lie algebras, the follow-
ing version of Lie’s Theorem is considered an
important tool.
The irreducible representations of a ﬁnite di-
mensional, solvable Lie algebra over an algebra-
ically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero all are
one-dimensional.
Lie subalgebra
Let K be a commutative ring
with unit. A Lie subalgebra is a subalgebra of
a Lie algebra (meaning a K-submodule that is
closed under the bracket product of the Lie al-
gebra). A Lie subalgebra is a Lie algebra. See

Lie subgroup
A subset of a Lie group G
which is both a subgroup of G and a submani-
fold of G (with both structures being induced by
those of G). (See Lie group.) As an example,
an open subset which is also a subgroup of a Lie
group is a Lie subgroup.
like terms
In an algebraic expression in sev-
eral variables, terms with identical factors raised
to identical powers (excluding values of coefﬁ-
cients).
Like terms are usually collected and
combined using rules of arithmetic and associa-
tive, commutative, and distributive laws.
3x2y5z and −2x2y5z
are like terms.
limit ordinal
In the theory of ordinal num-
bers, a non-zero ordinal which does not have a
predecessor.
line
(1) In classical Greek geometry, a line is
an undeﬁned term characterized by axioms and
understood by intuition. A line is considered to
be straight and to extend without bound. In ev-
eryday usage, the words line and straight line are
used interchangeably, and although in this con-
text the word straight is somewhat redundant, it
is still universally used. (An archaic synonym
is right line.) Curves that can be drawn without
interruption are sometimes called lines.
(2) In plane analytic geometry, the graph or
set of points described by a linear equation in
two variables x and y, given by ax + by = c
(where a, b, c are real numbers) is a line. This
equation, oralternatelyax+by+c = 0, iscalled
the general equation of a line. The graph of a
real valued function f of a real variable, given
(for real numbers a, b) by f (x) = ax + b, for
each real number x, is a non-vertical line. The
number a is called the slope of the line. With
b = 0, there is a one-to-one correspondence
between non-vertical lines and slopes.
For a
curve, the word slope is used more generally at
a point on the curve as the slope of the tangent
line to the curve at the point (if it exists). In this
context, a line can be described as a curve with
a constant slope.
The line passing through the two points (x1,
y1) and (x2, y2) in the Euclidean plane is de-
scribed as the set of all points (x, y) such that
x = x1
if
x2 = x1
and
y −y1 = y2 −y1
x2 −x1
(x −x1)
if
x2 ̸= x1 .
The equation is called the two point form of the
equation of a line. Also, a line has a parametric
representation as the set of pairs (x, y) such that,
for each real number t,
(x, y) = (1 −t) (x1, y1) + t (x2, y2) .
(3) In afﬁne geometry, where V is a ﬁnite
dimensional vector space over a ﬁeld k, a line
is a one-dimensional afﬁne space. If a, b are
distinct points, the line joining a and b can be
described as the set of all points of the form
(1 −t)a + tb,
for
t ∈k .
(4) In projective geometry, a line is a one-
dimensional projective space.
(5) Many areas of mathematics endow a line
with properties, resulting in such concepts as
parallel lines, half line, the real line, broken line,
tangent line, secant line, line of curvature, long
line, extended line, normal line, perpendicular
line, orthogonal line, line method (in numerical
analysis), etc.
linear
(1) Like or resembling a line. One
of the most used terms in mathematics. Many
ﬁelds of mathematics are separated into linear
and non-linear subﬁelds; e.g., the ﬁeld of dif-
ferential equations. The adjective is also used
to specify a subﬁeld of investigation; e.g., linear
algebra, linear topological space, linear (or vec-
tor) space, linear algebraic group, general lin-
ear group, etc. Also, the term is used to specify
a special subtype of object; e.g., linear combi-
nation, linear equation, linear function, linear
order, linear form, etc. See the nouns modiﬁed
for further explanation.
(2) If V, W are vector (linear) spaces over a
ﬁeld k, a mapping L : V −→W is called linear
if L is additive and homogeneous. Equivalently,
L is linear if, for each α, β ∈k and x, y ∈V ,
L(αx + βy) = αL(x) + βL(y) .

linear algebraic group
An abstract group
G, together with the structure of an afﬁne alge-
braic variety, such that the product and inverse
mappings given by
µ : G × G →G,
(x, y) '→xy
i : G →G,
x '→x−1
are morphisms of afﬁne algebraic varieties. Al-
ternately, such an algebraic group is called an
afﬁne algebraic group. The ground ﬁeld K is
assumed to be an arbitrary inﬁnite ﬁeld.
Probablythemostimportantexampleofalin-
ear algebraic group is the general linear group
GLn(K) or GLn(U), where U is a ﬁnite di-
mensional vector space over K. Since GLn(K)
is an open subset (with respect to the Zariski
topology) of the algebra on n × n matrices over
K, it inherits the afﬁne variety structure. Also,
polynomials on GLn(K) are realized as rational
functions in matrix elements with denominators
being powers of determinants. It follows that the
product and inverse mappings are morphisms of
afﬁne algebraic varieties.
Anotherdeﬁnitionofalinearalgebraicgroup
is a subgroup of the general linear group GLn
(U) which is closed in the Zariski topology,
where U is an algebraically closed ﬁeld that
has inﬁnite transcendence degree over the prime
ﬁeld K.
Since this subgroup is an algebraic
group, it can be called an algebraic linear group
as well. Now, there is an isomorphism between
a group deﬁned by the ﬁrst deﬁnition and one
deﬁned by the second.
So, the distinction is
only important when the word linear or afﬁne
is omitted from the ﬁrst deﬁnition, as is some-
times done in textbooks.
linear combination
Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be el-
ements of a vector space V over a ﬁeld F. A lin-
ear combination of the elements x1, x2, . . . , xn
over F is an element of the form
a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + anxn
where a1, a2, . . . , an ∈F.
Linear combination is a fundamental concept
in the theory of vector spaces and is used, among
other things, to deﬁne concepts of linear inde-
pendence of vectors, basis, linear span, and the
dimension of the vector space.
linear difference equation
An equation of
the form
a0xn + a1xn−1 + · · · + akxn−k = bn
where a0, a1, . . . , ak are scalars and a0ak ̸= 0,
is called a linear difference equation of order
k. The equation is called non-homogeneous if
bn ̸= 0 and homogeneous if bn = 0. Such re-
cursive equations are important in many ﬁelds
of numerical analysis; e.g., in ﬁnding zeros of
polynomials and in determining numerical so-
lutions of ordinary and partial differential equa-
tions. Writing the above difference equation in
terms of the operator Dxn = xn −xn−1 and its
powers, one can exploit the analogy with linear
differential equations.
linear disjoint extension ﬁelds
Two ﬁelds,
K and L, that are extensions of another ﬁeld, k,
and are themselves contained in a common ex-
tension ﬁeld are called linearly disjoint if every
subset of L that is linearly independent over k
is also linearly independent over K.
linear equation
Let k be a commutative ring.
Let a, b ∈k. Then an expression of the form
ax + b = 0
is called a linear equation in one variable x.
Let m ≥1. Let k[x1, . . . , xm] be a polyno-
mial ring over k. A linear equation is formed
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

by setting a linear form equal to zero. In other
words, a linear equation in m variables is given
by an equation
a0 + a1x1 + · · · + amxm = 0 ,
where a1, . . . , am ∈k.
In analytic geometry, where k is the real num-
ber ﬁeld, a linear equation in m variables de-
scribes a line if m = 2, a plane if m = 3, and a
hyperplane if m > 3.
linear equivalence
Any one of several simi-
lar equivalence relations deﬁned on schemes or
algebraic varieties. Generally speaking, if X is
one of these structures and if the concepts of
divisor and principal divisor are deﬁned, then
two divisors are related if their difference is a
principal divisor. The relation is an equivalence
relation, called a linear equivalence. The equiv-
alence classes form a group (See linear equiva-
lence class.)
More speciﬁcally, let X be a complete, non-
singular algebraic curve deﬁned over an alge-
braically closed ﬁeld k. Two divisors on X are
said to be linearly equivalent if their difference
is a principal divisor. A similar deﬁnition can
be made for nonsingular algebraic surfaces. See
divisor, principal divisor of functions.
More abstractly, let X be a Noetherian in-
tegral separated scheme which is nonsingular
in codimension one. The divisor d1 is called
linearly equivalent to d2 if their difference is a
principal divisor.
The deﬁnition can be extended to general
schemes by using Cartier divisors. See Cartier

An equivalence
class determined by the equivalence relation
called a linear equivalence deﬁned on the di-
visors of an algebraic variety or a scheme. The
equivalence classes form a group which is one of
the intrinsic invariants of the variety or scheme.
See linear equivalence.
linear extension
Let Y be a nonsingular al-
gebraic curve over a ﬁeld k. Let J denote the
Jacobian variety of Y. Let φ be the canonical
function on Y (with values in J). Let A be an
Abelian variety. Then for any function f on Y
into A, there exists a homomorphism h from J
into A such that f = h ◦φ. The function h is
called the linear extension of f and is unique.
See Jacobian variety. See also canonical func-
tion, Abelian variety.
linear form
(1) Also called linear functional.
A linear function or transformation from a linear
(vector) space V over a ﬁeld F into the ﬁeld F
(where the ﬁeld is considered to be a linear space
over itself).
(2) An expression in n variables x1, . . . , xn
of the type
a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + anxn + b
where a1, . . . an, b are elements of a commuta-
tive ring and at least one coefﬁcient is not 0. If
b = 0, the form is called homogeneous.
linear fractional function
A function f with
domain and range either the complex numbers
or the extended complex numbers and deﬁned
for numbers a, b, c, d with ad −bc ̸= 0 by
f (z) = az + b
cz + d .
Linear fractional functions are univalent, mero-
morphic functions that map each circle and line
in the complex plane to either a circle or a line.
The class includes rigid motions, translations,
rotations, and dilations. It is a subset of the class
of rational functions, being those rational func-
tions of order 1. Using function composition as
the binary operation, the set of linear fractional
transformations forms a group. They play an
important role in the study of the geometric the-
ory of functions.
Also called linear fractional transformation,
linear transformation, Möbius transformation,
fractional linear transformation, and conformal
automorphism. See also linear fractional group.
linear fractional group
A group of func-
tions formed by the set of linear fractional func-
tions deﬁned on the complex plane or extended
complex plane using composition as the group
operation. The quotient group of the full linear
group modulo the subgroup of nonzero scalar
matrices is isomorphic to the linear fractional
group. Both groups are called linear fractional
in the mathematical literature. See linear frac-

linear fractional programming
Determin-
ing the numerical solution of the problem of op-
timizing a function resembling the linear frac-
tional functions of complex analysis subject to
linear constraints. Linear programming meth-
ods are usually employed in the solution either
by a simplex-type method or by using the solu-
tion of an associated linear programming prob-
lem with additional constraints to solve the lin-
ear fractional problem. Speciﬁcally, let A be an
m × n matrix; let a, c be vectors in Rn; let p be
a vector in Rm; and, let b, c ∈R. Then a linear
fractional programming problem is to minimize
a·x + b
c·x + d
subject to
Ax = p
and x ≥0 .
linearfractionaltransformation
Classically,
a function on the complex plane having the form
ℓ(z) = [az +b]/[cz +d] for complex constants
a, b, c, d. There are analogs of this deﬁnition
on any Euclidean space.
linearfunction
(1)AfunctionLwithdomain
a vector space U over a ﬁeld F and range in a
vector space V over F which is additive and
homogeneous. This means, for each x, y ∈U
and for each α ∈F,
L(x + y) = L(x) + L(y)
(additivity)
and
L(αx) = αL(x)
(homogeneity) .
Thetermslineartransformationandlinearmap-
ping are also used to describe a function satisfy-
ing these conditions and L is sometimes called
a linear operator. If F is regarded as a one-
dimensional vector space over itself and if V =
F, then L is called a linear functional or linear
form.
(2) If a function f has the real or complex
numbers as its domain and range, it is called
linear if for some constants a, b, a ̸= 0, and
for each x,
f (x) = ax + b .
For real valued functions of a real variable, the
graph of a linear function (in this context) is
a straight line. More properly, such functions
should be called afﬁne, but the usage linear func-
tion is universal.
(3) See also linear fractional function.
linear genus
Let X be a nonsingular alge-
braic surface. If X has a minimal model M,
then the linear genus of X is an invariant equal
to the arithmetic genus of a canonical divisor
of M. If X is not a ruled surface, then X has
a minimal model and thus a linear genus. See
minimal model. See also arithmetic genus.
linear inequality
In analytic geometry, a lin-
ear inequality in m variables in Euclidean m-
dimensional space is a linear form set less than,
less than or equal to, greater than, or greater than
or equal to zero. For example, the inequality
a0 + a1x1 + · · · + amxm > 0 ,
where a0, a1, . . . , am are real numbers, is a lin-
ear inequality.
If m = 2, the set of pairs of real numbers
satisfying a linear inequality constitutes a half-
plane bounded by the line given by the associ-
ated linear equation.
linear least squares problem
A problem
where a linear function is to be found which best
approximates a given set of data in the sense that
the sum of the squares of the errors in such an
approximation is minimized.
linearly dependent elements
A set of ele-
ments that satisﬁes some linear relation. More
speciﬁcally, a set of elements {x1, x2, . . . , xN}
in a vector space is linearly dependent over a
ﬁeld F (such as the real or complex number
systems) if there exists α1, . . . , αN ∈F, not
all zero, with α1x1 + · · · + αNxN = 0. Exam-
ples include a set of two co-linear vectors or a
set of three co-planar vectors.
linearly dependent function
A function
which depends linearly on its input variables.
More precisely, a function f (x1, . . . , xN) is a
linearly dependent function if f (x1, . . . , xN) =
α1x1 + · · · + αNxN, where each αi belongs to
c

some given ﬁeld, such as the real or complex
number system.
linearly independent elements
A set of el-
ements which is not linearly dependent. More
precisely, a set of elements {x1, x2, . . . , xN} in
a vector space is linearly independent over a
ﬁeld F (such as the real or complex number sys-
tems) if, whenever α1x1 + · · · + αNxN = 0 for
α1, . . . , αN ∈F, thennecessarilyalltheαi must
be zero. Examples include a set of two vectors
which are not co-linear or a set of three vectors
which are not co-planar.
linear mapping
A function from one vec-
tor space to another L : V '→W, which pre-
serves the vector space operations, i.e., L(r1v1+
r2v2) = r1L(v1)+r2L(v2) for all vectors v1, v2
∈V and all scalars r1 and r2. Examples include
multiplication of an n-dimensional vector by an
m × n matrix (here V and W are Rn and Rm,
respectively) or the operation of differentiation
(here both V and W are spaces of functions with
appropriate differentiability).
Also called linear transformation, linear op-
erator.
linear pencil
Given two linear transforma-
tions, or matrices, A and B, the family A + λB,
where λ is any scalar parameter, is called the
(linear) pencil deﬁned by A and B.
linear programming
The study of optimiz-
ing a linear function over a convex, linear con-
straint set. Linear programming arises in eco-
nomics from the desire to maximize revenue or
minimize cost (from some economic process)
subject to constrained resources.
linear programming problem
A problem
in which a linear function of one or more in-
dependent variables is maximized or minimized
over a convex polygonal region. For example, to
maximize the function L(x) = 3x1 +2x2 +5x3
over the set {2x1 +3x2 +5x3 ≤5, x1, x2, x3 ≥
0}. Often such a problem arises in economics,
where the linear function to be maximized or
minimized represents revenue or costs and the
polygonal constraint region represents the limi-
tation of resources.
linearrepresentation
IfGisagroup, alinear
representation of G is a group homomorphism
of G into the invertible linear transformations
on some vector space.
linear simple group
Denoted Ln(q), where
q is a non-zero power of a prime number, it
is one of the classical ﬁnite simple groups. It
may be identiﬁed as the projective special linear
group over a ﬁnite ﬁeld of order q, and denoted
PSL(n, q). Let d be the greatest common divi-
sor of n and q−1. The possible orders of a linear
simple group are qn(n−1)/2(n
i=2(qi −1))/d;
where n ≥3, or n = 2 and q ≥4.
linear stationary iterative process
A meth-
od of using successive approximation to solve
the system of linear equations Ax = b when
A is a non-singular matrix. A method is called
iterative if the operations used to get from one
approximation to the next are nearly the same.
If successive steps are exactly the same, the
method is called stationary. The linear station-
ary iterative process may be written as x(k+1) =
x(k) + R(b −Ax(k)), where R is an approxima-
tion to A−1 and x(0) = Rb. With this deﬁnition
x(r) = (I + C + C2 + · · · + Cr)Rb where
C = I −RA and I is the identity. R is some-
times referred to as the key matrix and I −RA
is called the iteration matrix.
linear system
A ﬁnite set of simultaneous
equationsthatdependslinearlyonitsinputs. For
example,
3x + 2y = 5
−x + 4y = 7
is a linear system of equations involving the two
unknowns x and y. Another example is a linear
system of differential equations, which is a sys-
tem of differential equations where each one is
of the form
L[f ] = α1(x) ∂f
∂x1
+· · ·+αN(x) ∂f
∂xN
= β(x)f
where the αi and β are functions of the indepen-
dent variables x = (x1, . . . , xN) (in particular,
they do not depend on the function f ).
The
class of linear systems of differential equations
is the simplest class of differential equations to
understand and solve.

local class ﬁeld theory
The theory of Abel-
ian extensions of local ﬁelds; for example, the p-
adic number ﬁelds. Early results were obtained
using the techniques inherited from (global)
class ﬁeld theory. Other techniques in use in-
clude those from the theory of cohomology of
groups, algebraic K-theory, and the theory of
formal groups over local ﬁelds. Some of the
main results of local class ﬁeld theory include
an isomorphism theorem and an existence theo-
rem. Let K∗denote the multiplicative group of
K. The set of all ﬁnite Abelian extensions L/K
with Galois group G is in one-to-one correspon-
dence with the norm subgroup N = NL/K(L∗)
of K∗. This correspondence yields a canonical
isomorphism from G to K∗/N. The existence

local coordinates
A set of functions on a
manifold M near a point p, which forms a one-
to-one map of a neighborhood in M of the point
p onto a neighborhood in Euclidean space (i.e.,
RN or CN). Local coordinates are used to per-
form operations, such as differentiation or inte-
gration, to functions on a manifold by pulling
them back to Euclidean space where such oper-
ations are simpler to understand.
local equation
An equation of the form
f (x) = 0 which locally (i.e., in a neighborhood
of some given point) describes a codimension
one, irreducible variety.
local ﬁeld
A ﬁeld that is complete with re-
spect to a discrete valuation and has a ﬁnite
residue ﬁeld. A local ﬁeld with ﬁnite character-
istic is isomorphic to the ﬁeld of formal power
series in one variable over a ﬁnite ﬁeld. If the
local ﬁeld has characteristic 0, then it is isomor-
phic to a ﬁnite algebraic extension of the ﬁeld of
p-adic numbers (Qp). The term has also been
applied to discretely valued ﬁelds with arbitrary
residue ﬁelds. In particular, real and complex
number ﬁelds have been called local ﬁelds.
local Gaussian sum
Some constants in

If we denote by ξk(s, χ) a certain multiple of

ple is the construction of the rational numbers
(fractions) from the integers.

locally convex topological space
A topolog-
ical vector space with a basis for its topology,
whose members are convex.

contexts.
A typical example comes from the

ometry.

rian rings. This concept arises in commutative
algebra.

that is only deﬁned on a small open subset, such

rameter near a given point, but not a global pa-
rameter.
local ring

tance to commutative algebra.
logarithm
The logarithm of a number N > 0
to a given base b > 0 (b ̸= 1), denoted logb N,
is the unique number x with N = bx. For ex-
ample, log2 8 = 3 and log10 1/100 = −2. Of
particular importance is the natural logarithm,
denoted ln N or log N, where the base is the
number e = lim
h→∞(1 + 1/h)h = 2.718 . . . .
More rigorously, one may deﬁne logarithm
to the base e by
log x =
 x
1
t−1 dt
and logb x = log x/ log b.
logarithmic equation
Any equation involv-
ing logarithms. For example, log10(x + 8) +
log10(x −7) = 2.
logarithmic function
The function logb(x)
for some given positive base b (b ̸= 1). See
logarithm.
The logarithm function is used to describe
many physical phenomenon. For example, the
Richter scale for earthquakes is deﬁned in terms
ofthelogarithmoftheenergyproducedbyearth-
quakes.
logarithm of a complex number
A loga-
rithm of a complex number z is any number w
with ew = z. The logarithm of a complex num-
ber is not unique, since the exponential function
is periodic with period 2πi (i.e., ew+2πi = ew),
if w is a logarithm of z, then w + 2πki is also
a logarithm of z for any integer k. The prin-
cipal value of the logarithm of z is the unique
logarithm whose argument is between −π and
π.
More rigorously, log z may be deﬁned as
log |z| + 2πi arg(z), where log |z| is deﬁned,
as the logarithm of a positive real number and
arg(z) is the argument of z. See logarithm.
long division
The long division of a number
g by a number f is the process of ﬁnding unique
numbersq andr withg = f q+r wherer (called
the remainder) is less than g. Often long divi-
sion involves repeating the process so that r =
f q1+r1, with r1 < r. Thus, one obtains smaller
and smaller remainders r, r1, r2, . . . , with rn/f
tending to 0, so that q + q1 + q2 + · · · + qn is a
better and better approximation to g/f .
This process can be applied to elements
of other rings, such as the ring of polynomi-
als, where there is some notion of comparison
(greater than or less than). In the ring of polyno-
mials, the remainder is required to have degree
smaller than q.

plying two multi-digit numbers that involves ar-
ranging the intermediate products into columns.

The Lorentz group
(as well as all the groups O(1, n)) are basic to
the study of differential geometry. The Lorentz
group in particular is important in the study of
relativity (mathematical physics).
lower bound
For a set S of real numbers,
any number which is less than or equal to all
elements in S. For example, any number which
is less than or equal to zero is a lower bound for
the set {x : 0 ≤x ≤1}.
lower central series

given Lie algebra G, deﬁned inductively as fol-
lows: D1G = [G, G] (which means the set of
allLiebracketsofanelementinGwithanyother
element in G); DkG = [G, Dk−1G]. This con-
cept is of fundamental importance in the classi-
ﬁcation of Lie algebras.

topological space and f : X →R a function.
Then f is said to be lower semi-continuous if
f −1((β, ∞)) is open for every real β.
lower triangular matrix
Any square matrix
A = (aij) with zero entries above the diagonal
(aij = 0 for j > i). Any set of linear equa-
tions (A · x = b) arising from a lower triangular
matrix can be solved easily by solving the ﬁrst
equation a11x1 = b1 for x1 and then forward
substituting in the subsequent equations to solve
for x2, x3, . . . .
lowest terms
The form of a fractional ex-
pression with no factor that is common to both
numerator and denominator. For example, 3/4
is a fraction in lowest terms, but 6/8 is not, be-
cause of the common factor of 2.
loxodromic transformation
One of several
classiﬁcation schemes for linear fractional func-
tions w = az+b
cz+d in one complex variable. If such
a transformation has two distinct ﬁnite ﬁxed
points α and β, then the transformation can be
put into the following normal form:
w −α
w −β = k z −α
z −β
where
k = a −cα
a −cβ .
If arg k = 0, the transformation is called hy-
perbolic; if |k| = 1 the transformation is called
elliptic; otherwise the transformation is called
loxodromic.

other than R itself. See ideal.
maximal ideal space
The collection 
X of
all multiplicative linear functionals on a Banach
algebra or function algebra X. 
X is so called
because the kernel of each such functional is a
maximal ideal in X.
maximal independent system
A linearly in-
dependent system of vectors in a vector space,
with the property that any additional vector
would make the system dependent. See linearly
independent elements.
For example, a set of
three non-coplanar vectors in R3 is a maximal
independent system because if any fourth vec-
tor is added, the system becomes linearly depen-
dent.
maximal order
The largest order of any ele-
ment in a group, where the order of an element
g is the smallest positive integer m with gm = e,
the identity element in the group.
maximal prime divisor
(Of an ideal I of a
commutative ring R.) A prime ideal P of R such
that P is maximal, as an ideal of R containing
I, and is disjoint from the set of elements of R
which are not zero-divisors, modulo I.

maximal prime ideal
A prime ideal of a ring
R which is not properly contained in a prime
ideal other than R itself. See prime ideal.
maximal separable extension
A separable
extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F which is not properly
contained in any other separable extension ﬁeld
of F. See separable extension.
maximal torus
Let G be a Lie group. A
torus H in G is a connected, compact, Abelian
subgroup. If, for any other torus H ′ in G with
H ′ ⊇H we have H ′ = H, then H is said to be
maximal.
mean
Any of a variety of averages.
(1) The mean of a set of numbers is their sum
divided by the number of entries in the set. More
precisely, the mean of x1, . . . , xN is (x1 +· · ·+
xN)/N. The mean is one of the basic statistical
quantities used in analyzing data.
(2) The mean of a function f (x), deﬁned on a
set S, is a continuous analog of the mean deﬁned
above:

|S|

S
f (x)dx ,
where |S| denotes the length, or volume, of S.
See also mean of degree r.
mean of degree r
Of a function f , with re-
spect to a weight function p, the quantity

f rp dx

p dx
1/r
.
In other words, the mean of degree r of f is
the Lr norm of f with respect to the probability
measure generated by the weight function p.
mean proportional
A mean proportional be-
tween two numbers a and b is the number m such
that a/m = m/b.
mean terms of proportion
The terms b and
c in the proportion a/b = c/d. (In older works,
the proportion is sometimes written a : b :: c :
d.)
measurable operator function
For a set X,
a σ-algebra , on X and a Hilbert space H, a
function F from X to the set of bounded opera-
tors on H, such that, for any vector h ∈H, the
function x →(F(x)h, h) is , measurable.
measurable vector function
The space of
measurable vector functions is a set K of func-
tions, from a measure space M to a Hilbert space
H, (·, ·) with the following properties: (i.) if
x ∈K, then ||x|| = (x(ζ), x(ζ))
1
2 is a measur-
able (scalar) function; (ii.) for any x and y ∈
K, (x, y) is measurable, and (iii.) there is a
countable family {x1, x2, . . . } from K such that
{x1(ζ), x2(ζ), . . . } is dense in H. The deﬁnition
also allows for the Hilbert space H to depend on
ζ.
measure
Let X be a space and let A be a
sigma ﬁeld on X. A measure on X is a function
µ : A →R that satisﬁes certain additivity or
subadditivity properties, such as countable ad-
ditivity. See additive set function. A measure is
a device for measuring the length or the size of
a set.
median
A midway point in a data set. For
a discrete data set, half the data points are less
than or equal to the median and half are greater
than or equal to the median. More generally,
the median for a distribution ρ on a probability
space {X, p} is a number m such that the proba-
bility of the event that f (x) is less than or equal
to m is greater than or equal to 1/2 and the prob-
ability of the event that f (x) is greater than or
equal to m is greater than or equal to 1/2.
meet
In a lattice, the inﬁmum or greatest
lower bound of a set of elements. Speciﬁcally,
if A is a subset of a lattice L, the meet of A
is the unique lattice element b = {x : x ∈
A} deﬁned by the following two conditions: (i.)
x ≥b for all x ∈A. (ii.) If x ≥c for all x ∈A,
then b ≥c. The meet of an inﬁnite subset of
a lattice may not exist; that is, there may be no
element b of the lattice L satisfying conditions
(i.) and (ii.) above. However, by deﬁnition,
one of the axioms a lattice must satisfy is that
the meet of a ﬁnite subset A must always exist.
The meet of two elements is usually denoted by
x ∧y.
There is a dual notion of the join of a sub-
set A of a lattice, denoted by {x : x ∈A},
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

and deﬁned by reversing the inequality signs in
conditions (i.) and (ii.) above. The join is also
called the supremum or least upper bound of the
subset A. Again, the join of an inﬁnite subset
may fail to exist, but the join of a ﬁnite subset
always exists by the deﬁnition of a lattice.
meet irreducible element
An element a of
a lattice L which cannot be represented as the
meet of lattice elements b properly larger than
a (a < b, a ̸= b). See meet.
There is a dual notion of join irreducibility.
An element a of L is join irreducible if it cannot
be represented as the join of lattice elements b
properly smaller than a (b < a, b ̸= a). See
join.
member of an equation
The expression on
the left (or right) side of the equality sign. The
member on the left side of the equals sign is
called the ﬁrst member of the equation, and the
member on the right side is called the second
member of the equation.
Meta-Abelian group

mutator subgroup (deﬁned as the set of all
a−1b−1ab, for a, b in the group) is Abelian. See
Abelian group.
methodoffeasibledirections
Atechniquein
non-linear optimization for functions of several
variables that reduces the problem to a series of
one-dimensional optimization problems.
minimal
A term which generally means
smallest but whose precise meaning depends on
the context. In set theory, a minimal set with
respect to a given property is a set which has the
property, but, if any element is removed from
the set, then the smaller set fails to have this
property.
minimal basis
A basis for a vector space V
with the property that, if any element is removed
from the basis, it no longer forms a basis (i.e.,
some element of V cannot be expressed as a
ﬁnite linear combination of the smaller set). See
basis.
Often such minimality is part of the deﬁnition
of basis.
minimal ideal
An ideal which does not prop-
erly contain any ideal except the zero ideal, {0}.
minimal model
A nonsingular, projective
surface which is the unique relatively minimal
model in its birational equivalence class. Except
for rational and ruled surfaces, every non-empty
birational equivalence class has a (unique) min-
imal model. The existence of a minimal model
in the birational equivalence class of a higher
dimensional variety, over the ﬁeld of complex
numbers, has been solved for varieties of dimen-
sion three. In the higher dimensional case, cer-
tain types of singularities must be allowed and
minimal models are no longer unique.
minimalparbolick-subgroup
Aclosedsub-
group of a connected reductive linear algebraic
group G, deﬁned over an arbitrary ground ﬁeld
k, which is minimal among the parabolic sub-
groups of G.
Any two minimal parabolic k-
subgroups are conjugate to each other over k.
Minimal parabolic k-subgroups play the same
roleforarbitraryﬁeldsthatBorelsubgroupsplay

subgroup.
minimal polynomial
For a given element T
(which could be a linear transformation or an
element in some ﬁeld extension), a polynomial
p of least degree with p(T ) = 0.
minimal prime divisor
An ideal I in a ring
R which is prime and is minimal (i.e., does not
properly contain any prime ideal). See prime
ideal.
minimal splitting ﬁeld
Suppose E, F with
F ⊂E are ﬁelds and f (x) is an element of
F[x]. The ﬁeld E is a minimal splitting ﬁeld
if it is a splitting ﬁeld for f (x) and no proper
subﬁeld of E has this property.
minimal Weierstrass equation
A Weier-
strass equation for an elliptic curve E/K is one
of the form

Minkowski-Farkas Theorem
For every ma-
trix A and vector b the system Ax = b has a
non-negative solution if and only if the system
uA ≥0, ub < 0 has no solution.
This theorem is sometimes referred to as
the Minkowski-Farkas Lemma.
The follow-

Minkowski-Farkas Lemma. The following con-
ditions are mutually exclusive.
Either the

inequality is the statement that the Lp-norm sat-
isﬁes the triangle inequality, which is one of the
deﬁning properties of a norm. Named after the
German mathematician H. Minkowski (1864–
1909).
Minkowski-Siegel-Tamagawa Theory
In
number theory, a theory on the arithmetic of
linear groups. Let S and T be the matrices of
integral positive deﬁnite quadratic forms, corre-
sponding to the lattices 4S ⊂Rm, 4T ⊂Rn, in
the sense that qS and qT express the lengths of
elements of 4S and 4T , respectively. Then an
integral solution X to the equation S[X] = T ,
where S[X] := XtSX, determines an isometric
embedding 4S →4T . Denote by N(S, T ) the
total number of such maps. The genus of qS is
deﬁned to be the set of quadratic forms which
are rationally equivalent to qS. Let I be the set
of these equivalence classes. One of Siegel’s
formulas gives the value of a certain weighted
average of the numbers N(Sx, T ) over a set of
representatives Sx for classes x ∈I of forms of
a given genus:
˜N(S, T ) = cm−nc−1
m α∞(S, T )

p
αp(S, T ) ,
where c1 = 1
2 and ca = 1 for a > 1, ˜N(S, T )

Mass(S)

x∈I
N(Sx,T )
w(x)
and w(x) is the order
of the group of orthogonal transformations of
the lattice 4S, and deﬁne the mass of S by
Mass(S) = 
x∈I
1
w(x).
In the special case T = S, we have ˜N(S, T )
=
1
Mass(S), and the Siegel formula becomes the
Minkowski-Siegel formula:
Mass(S) = cmα∞(S, S)−1 
p
αp(S, S)−1 .
Siegel’s formula can be deduced from an in-
tegral formula: ˜N(ϕ) = vol(g/γ )
vol(G/ ;)

G/g ϕ(x)dx,
where G = Om(A) is the locally compact group
of orthogonal matrices with respect to S with
coefﬁcients in the ring of adeles A, g and γ are
closed subgroups of G with vol(g/γ ) ﬁnite and
ϕ is a continuous function with compact support
on G/γ . The quantities cm−n and cm become
the Tamagawa numbers τ(Om−n) and τ(Om),
respectively, and the Tamagawa measure on G
can be deﬁned.
Minkowski space
A ﬂat space of four di-
mensions, designed to model the geometry of
the physical universe as suggested by the special
theory of relativity. It is also called Minkowski
space-time,
the
Minkowski
world
or
the
Minkowski universe.
There are two methods
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

of envisioning Minkowski space. Coordinates
may be written as (x, y, z, ict) where i2 = −1
and c is the speed of light. In this case (x, y, z)
represents the position of a point in space, and t
is the time at which an event occurs at that point.
The distance between two points is then
ds =

(dx)2 + (dy)2 + (dz)2 −c2(dt)2 .
It is also possible to view Minkowski space as
the manifold R4, with a ﬂat Lorentz metric. In
this case, the coordinates are written as (x1, x2,
x3, x4) = (x, y, z, ct) and the space is associ-
ated with an indeﬁnite inner product x · y =
x1y1 + x2y2 + x3y3 −x4y4. Note, in some ref-
erences the time coordinate is listed ﬁrst and
called x0. In addition, some references deﬁne
the inner product as the negative of the one de-
ﬁned above. Using the deﬁnition given above,
a non-zero vector x is called time-like or space-
like, depending upon whether x · x is negative
or positive. A non-zero vector x is called null,
isotropic, or lightlike if x · x = 0.
Minkowski’s Theorem
(1) If K ̸= Q, then
|DK| > 1, where K is a ﬁeld, k is an algebraic
number ﬁeld contained in k, with [K : k] < ∞,
and DK is the discriminant of K.
The theorem is a consequence of the follow-
ing Minkowski Lemma: let M be a lattice in
Rn, @ =vol(Rn/M), and let X ⊂Rn be a cen-
trally symmetric convex body of ﬁnite volume
v =vol(X). If v > 2n@, then there exists a
nonzero α ∈M ∩X.
(2) (On convex bodies) Any convex region
in n-dimensional Euclidean space which is sym-
metric about the origin and has a volume greater
than 2n contains another point with integral co-
ordinates. This theorem can be generalized as
follows. Let P be a convex region in n-dimen-
sionalEuclideanspacewhichissymmetricabout
the origin and let 4 be a lattice with determinant
@. If the volume of P is greater than 2n|@|,
then P contains a point of 4 other than the ori-
gin. This is one of the most important theorems
in the geometry of numbers, and is one of the
reasons that the geometry of numbers exists as a
distinct subdivision of number theory. The fol-
lowing application to algebraic number ﬁelds is
also called Minkowski’s Theorem. If k is an al-
gebraic number ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree and k ̸= Q,
then the absolute value of the discriminant of k
is greater than 1.
minor
The determinant of an n −1 × n −1
submatrix of an n × n matrix obtained by delet-
ing a row and a column from the larger matrix.
Minors arise as a theoretical tool for computing
a determinant of a matrix (as in expansion by
minors). See expansion of determinant.
minuend
The term from which another term
is to be subtracted. (The number a in a −b.)
minus sign
The symbol “−” which indicates
subtraction in arithmetic. The minus sign also
indicates “additive inverse,” so that, for exam-
ple, −3 is the additive inverse of 3. This no-
tion extends to groups (with operation +), where
−x represents the element that when added to x
gives the identity in the group.
mixed decimal
A number written in decimal
form with an integer and a fractional part; for
example, 34.587.

ample, 4xy + y2x is a mixed expression of the
variables x and y.
mixed group
A set M which can be parti-
tioned into disjoint subsets, M0, M1, . . . with
the following properties: (i.) for a ∈M0 and
b ∈Mi, i = 0, 1, . . . , elements ab and a \ b
are deﬁned such that a(a \ b) = b; (ii.) for
b, c ∈Mi, an element b/c of M0 is deﬁned
such that (b/c) · c = b; and (iii.) the associative
law (ab)c = a(bc) for a, b ∈M0 and c ∈M
holds.
mixed ideal
An ideal I of a Noetherian ring
R such that there exist associated prime ideals
P, Q of I such that the height of P is not equal
to the height of Q. See height.
mixed integer programming problem
A
programing problem in which some of the vari-
ables are required to have integer values. In ad-
dition, all of the variables are usually required
to be nonnegative. Mixed integer programming
once referred only to problems that were linear
in appearance. The concept has been expanded

where the matrices c, d, G, H, and b have inte-
ger entries and the following dimensions: c is
1 × n, d is 1 × p, G is m × n, H is m × p, and
b is m × 1. In addition, it is assumed that m
and n + p are positive integers.
mixed number
A number that has both an
integer and a fractional part, such as 4 2
3.
M-matrix
A matrix A that can be written as
A = sI −B ,
where B is an entrywise nonnegative matrix, I
is the identity matrix, and s is a positive number
greater than the spectral radius of B. From the
Perron-Frobenius Theorem for entrywise non-
negative matrices, it follows that all the eigen-
values of an M-matrix have positive real parts.
M-matrices arise naturally in several areas of
the mathematical sciences such as optimization,
Markov chains, numerical solution of differen-
tial equations, and dynamical systems theory.

modulararithmetic
Modulararithmeticwith
respect to a certain number p refers to an arith-
metic calculation, where at the end, only the
remainder is kept after subtracting the greatest
multiple of p.
For example, if p = 5, then
3 × 7 (modulo 5) equals 1 (since 3 × 7 = 21 =

sentation.
module
A nonempty set M is said to be an
R-module (or a module over a ring R) if M is
an Abelian group under an operation (usually
denoted by +) and if, for every r ∈R and m ∈
M, there exists an element rm ∈M subject to
the distributive laws: r(m1 + m2) = rm1 +
rm2 and (r + s)m = rm + sm; as well as the
associative law r(sm) = (rs)m for m, m1, m2 ∈
M and r, s ∈R.
module of A-homomorphisms
The set of all
homomorphisms from an A-module M to an A-
module N forms a module over the ring A called
the module of homomorphisms from M to N, de-
noted HomA(M, N). See homomorphism. See
also automorphism group.
module of boundaries
A concept that arises
in the subject of graded modules. Regard the
graded module X as a sequence of modules X0,
X1, X2, . . . withmaps∂n : Xn →Xn−1 (called
boundary maps) with ∂n−1◦∂n = 0. The module
of boundaries is the graded module of images
of the boundary map, i.e., ∂1{X1}, ∂2{X2}, . . .
This concept arises most commonly in topology
where the graded modules are chains of sim-
plicies in a topological space X. In this case,

Xk is the free module generated (say, over the
integers) by the continuous images of the stan-
dard k-dimensional simplex in Euclidean space
{(x1, . . . , xk) ∈Rk : xi ≥0, k
i=1 xi ≤1}.
The boundary map of a k-simplex is a weighted
sum of (the continuous images of) its k −1 di-
mensional faces where the weights are either
plus one or minus one depending on the ori-
entation of the face. Then the module of k −
1-boundaries is the module generated by the
boundaries of k-dimensional simplicies.
module of coboundaries
A coboundary is
the image of a cocycle under the induced bound-
ary map. (See module of cocycles.) The set of
coboundaries is a module over the underlying
ring (often the integers or the reals).
module of cocycles
The dual of the module
of cycles. More precisely, if X0, X1, X2, . . .
is a graded chain of cycles over a ring R (often
the integers or the reals) with boundary maps
∂n : Xn →Xn−1, then the module of cocycles
is the graded chain ˆX0, ˆX1, ˆX2, . . . where each
ˆXn isthesetofallringhomomorphismsfromXn

for ˆcn ∈ˆXn and xn+1 ∈Xn+1.
module of cycles

subject of graded modules. Regard the graded
moduleX asasequenceofmodulesX0, X1, X2,
. . . with maps ∂n : Xn →Xn−1 (called bound-
ary maps) with ∂n−1 ◦∂n = 0. A cycle cn ∈Xn
is one that has zero boundary (∂ncn = 0). The
set of all cycles is a module over the underlying
ring (often the integers). This concept arises
most commonly in topology where the graded
modules are chains of simplicies in a topological
space X. In this case, Xk is the free module gen-
erated (say, over the integers) by the continuous

The boundary map of a chain is a
weighted sum of (the continuous images of) its
k −1 dimensional faces where the weights are
either plus one or minus one depending on the
orientation of the face. The cycles are the chains
whose boundaries are zero. As a simple exam-
ple, a circle is a cycle in R2 because it is the
image of the one-dimensional simplex 0 ≤t ≤
1 (via the complex exponential map, f (t) =
exp(2πit)) and because its boundary, f (1) −
f (0), is zero.

Module) in a ringed space (X, O), which is lo-
cally generated by a ﬁnite number of sections

(3) A ﬁnitely generated module.
module of homomorphisms
Let M and N
be modules over a commutative ring R. The set
of all homomorphisms of module M to module
N is called the module of homomorphisms of
M to N, with addition deﬁned pointwise and
multiplication given by (r · f )(x) = r · (f (x)),
for r ∈R, f : M →N a homomorphism
and x ∈M. The module of homomorphisms is
denoted HomR(M, N).
module with operator domain
A module
M, together with a set A and a map from A×M
into M satisfying the following conditions. (i.)
For every a ∈A and x ∈M there is a unique
element ax ∈M. (ii.) If a ∈A and x, y ∈M,
then a(x + y) = ax + ay. In this situation, M

Because one has log10 x = log10 b logb x, for

monomial module

a single generator. See module.
monomial representation
Let H be a sub-
group of a ﬁnite group G. If ρ is a linear rep-
resentation of H with representation module M,
then the linear representation ρG = K(G)

K(H) M of G is called the induced represen-
tation from ρ. (Here, K is a ﬁeld.) A mono-
mial representation of G is the induced repre-
sentation from a degree 1 representation of a
subgroup. Each monomial representation of G
corresponds to a matrix representation τ such
that for each g ∈G the matrix τ(g) has exactly
one nonzero entry in each row and each column.
The induced representation of G from the trivial
subgroup {e} is called the regular representation
of G.
monomorphism

satisfying the following property: Whenever the
equation i ◦f = i ◦g holds for two morphisms
f and g in the category, then f = g.

⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

In most familiar categories, such as the cate-
gory of sets and functions, a monomorphism is
simply an injective or one-to-one function in the
category. A function i : A →B is one-to-one,
or injective if i(a1) ̸= i(a2) whenever a1 ̸= a2.
See also morphism in a category, epimorphism,
injection.
monotone function
Let I ⊆R be an interval
and f : I →R a function. If whenever a, b ∈I
and a < b it holds that f (a) ≤f (b), then f
is said to be monotone increasing. If whenever
a, b ∈I and a < b it holds that f (a) ≥f (b),
then f is said to be monotone decreasing. In
both cases, f is a monotone function.

Mordell’s conjecture
Any algebraic curve
of genus ≥2 deﬁned over an algebraic number
ﬁeld k of ﬁnite degree has ﬁnitely many rational
points. (Conjectured in 1922 and settled in the
afﬁrmative by G. Faltings in 1983. The original
1922 conjecture was stated for the special case
k = Q.)
Mordell-Weil Theorem
Let k be an alge-
braic number ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree and let V be
an Abelian variety of dimension n deﬁned over
k. Then the group Vk of all k-rational points on
V is ﬁnitely generated.
This theorem was proved by Mordell for the
special case of n = 1 in 1922 and by Weil for
the general case in 1928.
morphism
Let ◦be a binary operation on
a set A, while ◦′ is another such operation on
a set A′. A morphism m : (A, ◦) →(A′, ◦′)
is a function on A to A′ which preserves the
operation ◦on A onto the operation ◦′ on A′, in
the sense that
m(a ◦b) = m(a) ◦′ m(b)
for all a, b ∈A.
In a categorical approach to algebra, one de-
ﬁnes a category C as a set (or, more generally,
a class) of objects, together with a class of spe-
cial maps, called morphisms between these ob-
jects. If C is the category of Abelian groups,
then the morphisms would normally be group
homomorphisms. If C is the category of topo-
logical spaces, the morphisms would be contin-
uous maps, etc. See also functor.
morphism in a category
A map by means

morphism of ﬁnite type
For R a commuta-

f : X −→Spec(R) is called a morphism of ﬁ-
nite type provided that X has a ﬁnite open afﬁne
covering {Ui = Spec(Ri)} such that each Ri is
a ﬁnitely generated R-algebra. More generally,
a morphism of schemes f : X −→Y is of ﬁnite
type if there is an afﬁne covering {Vi} of Y such
that the restriction f : f −1(Vi) −→Vi is of
ﬁnite type for each i. See scheme, spectrum.

For two pointed sets (X, x∗) and (Y, y∗), a map
f : X −→Y is said to be a morphism of pointed

morphism of schemes
Let R be a commu-
tative ring with 1. One obtains a sheaf of rings
˜R on Spec(R) by assigning to each point p of
Spec(R)theringofquotientsRp. ThenSpec(R)
is called an afﬁne scheme when it is regarded
as a local-ringed space with ˜R as its structure
sheaf. A scheme is a local-ringed space X which
is locally isomorphic to an afﬁne scheme. A

multiplication
(1) A binary operation on a
set. In group theory, and in algebra in general,
it is customary to denote by a ˙b or ab, the el-
ement which is associated with (a, b) under a
given binary operation. The element c = ab is
then called the product of a and b, and the binary
operation itself is called multiplication. When
the term multiplication is used for a binary op-
eration, it carries with it the implication that if
a and b are in the set G, then ab is also in G.

b = e, the basis for the natural logarithm, has
had extensive use in facilitating arithmetical cal-
culations, especially before the days of comput-

allows one to multiply large numbers n, m by as-
certaining their logarithms (from a table), add-
ing the logarithms and then obtaining the prod-
uct of m and n by another reference to the table.
See logarithm, common logarithm, natural log-
arithm.
multiplication of complex numbers
Multi-
plication of z1 = a + ib and z2 = c + id yields

bc). Writing the complex numbers z1 and z2
in terms of their absolute values r1, r2 and their
arguments φ1, φ2: zj = rj(cos φj + i sin φj),
yields z1 ·z2 = r1r2[cos(φ1 +¯φ2)+i cos(φ1 +

Newton-Raphsonmethodofsolvingalgebraic
equations
An iterative numerical method for
ﬁndinganapproximatevalueforazeroofafunc-
tion f (approximating a solution to the equa-
tion f (x) = 0). The method begins by choos-
ing a suitable starting value x0.
The method
proceeds by constructing a sequence of succes-
sive approximations, x1, x2, x2, . . . , to the ex-
act solution x, according to the formula xk =
xk−1 −f (xk−1)/f ′(xk−1). Under suitable con-
ditions, the sequence x1, x2, x3, . . . converges
to x.
The name Newton-Raphson method is also
applied to a multi-dimensional generalization of
the above. Here, the object is to approximate a
solution to the equation f (x) = 0, but this time
x is a vector in an n-dimensional vector space
V and f is a vector-valued function from some
subset of V to V . The sequence of successive
approximations is constructed according to the
formula:
xk = xk−1 −D (f (xk−1))−1 f (xk−1) ,
where Df is the Jacobian of f (the n×n matrix
of partial derivatives).

(2) An oriented n-simplex σ of a simplicial
complex K is an n-simplex of K with an equiv-
alent class of total ordering of its vertices. (Two
orderings are equivalent if they differ by an even
permutation of the vertices.) Therefore, for ev-
ery n-simplex, n ≥1, there are two oriented
n-simplexes called the opposites of one another.

ming problem is the problem of ﬁnding the

mum/minimum is called an optimal solution of
the problem.

function on an open set U in the complex plane.
Suppose that P ∈U and that f (P) = 0. Let k
be the least positive integer such that f (k)(P) ̸=
0 (where the superscript denotes a derivative).
Then f is said to vanish to order k at P.
There is an analogous notion of order of van-
ishing for a real function. If F vanishes at a point
x0 in Euclidean space, then the order of vanish-
ing at x0 is the order of the ﬁrst non-vanishing
Taylor coefﬁcient in the expansion about x0.

Peirce decomposition
Let A be a semisimple
Jordan algebra over a ﬁeld F of characteristic 0
and let e be an idempotent of A. For λ ∈F, let
Ae(λ) = {a ∈A : ea = λa}. Then
A = Ae(1) ⊕Ae(1/2) ⊕Ae(0) .
This is called the Peirce decomposition of A,
relative to E. If 1 is the sum of idempotents ej,
let Aj,k = Aej (1) when j = k and Aej ∩Aek
when j ̸= k. These are called Peirce spaces,
and A = ⊕j≤kAj,k. See also Peirce space.

Suppose that the unity element
1 ∈K can be represented as a sum of the mutu-
ally orthogonal idempotents ej. Then, putting
Aj,j = Aej (1),
Aj,k = Aej (1/2)∩Aek(1/2),
we have A = 
j≤k ⊕Aj,k.
Then Aj,k are

Peirce’s right decomposition
Let e be an

be found by continued fractions and are used in
the determination of the units of rings such as
Z[√a]. This equation was studied extensively
by Gauss. It can be regarded as a starting point
of modern algebraic number theory.
When a < 0, then Pell’s equation has only

penalty method of solving non-linear pro-
gramming problem
A method to modify a

lem. In order to minimize (or maximize) a func-
tion φ(x) on a set which has constraints (such
as f1(x) ≥0, f2(x) ≥0, . . . fm(x) ≥0), a
penalty or penalty function, ψ(x, a), is intro-
duced(wherea isanumber), whereψ(x, a) = 0
if x ∈X or ψ(x, a) > 0 if x /∈X and ψ in-
volves f1(x) ≥0, f2(x) ≥0, . . . fm(x) ≥0.
Then, one minimizes (or maximizes) φa(x) =
φ(x) + ψ(x, a) without the constraints.

extension is separable. Equivalently, a ﬁeld F is
perfect if each irreducible polynomial with co-

perfect power
An integer or polynomial
which can be written as the nth power of another
integer or polynomial, where n is a positive in-
teger. For example, 8 is a perfect cube, because
8 = 23, and x2 + 4x + 4 is a perfect square,
because x2 + 4x + 4 = (x + 2)2.

sis for the 1-dimensional integral homology of
R. The period matrix M is the g × 2g matrix
whose (i, j)-th entry is the integral of ωj over
αi. The group generated by the 2g columns of
M is a lattice in Cg and the quotient yields a g-

permutations (i1, i2, . . . , im) of the set {1, 2,

manent therefore has an expansion similar to
that of the determinant, except that the factor
corresponding to the sign of the permutation is
missing from each summand.
permutation group
Let A be a ﬁnite set with
#(A) = n. The permutation group on n ele-
ments is the set Sn consisting of all one-to-one
functions from A onto A under the group law:
f · g = f ◦g
for f, g ∈Sn. Here ◦denotes the composition
of functions.
permutation matrix
An n × n matrix P,
obtained from the identity matrix In by permu-
tations of the rows (or columns). It follows that a
permutation matrix has exactly one nonzero en-
try (equal to 1) in each row and column. There
are n! permutation matrices of size n × n. They
are orthogonal matrices, namely, P T P = PP T
= In (i.e., P T = P −1). Multiplication from
the left (resp., right) by a permutation matrix
permutes the rows (resp., columns) of a matrix,
corresponding to the original permutation.
permutation representation
A permutation
representation of a group G is a homomorphism

on whether a product of permutations is read
right-to-left or left-to-right).

equivalent to zero, respectively.

called the Picard number of V .
Picard scheme
Let O∗
V be the sheaf of mul-
tiplicative group of the invertible elements in
OV . The group of linear equivalence classes
of Cartier divisors can be identiﬁed with
H 1(V, OV ). From this point of view, we can
generalize the theory of the Picard variety to the
case of schemes. The theory thus obtained is
called the theory of Picard schemes.
Picard’s Theorem
There are two important
theorems in one complex variable proved by
the French mathematician Charles Émile Picard
(1856–1941).
The ﬁrst Picard theorem was
proved in 1879: An entire function which is not a
polynomial takes every value, with one possible
exception, an inﬁnity of times.
The second Picard theorem was proved in
1880: In a neighborhood of an isolated essen-
tial singularity, a single-valued, holomorphic
function takes every value, with one possible ex-
ception, an inﬁnity of times. In other words, if
f (z) is holomorphic for 0 < |z −z0| < r, and
there are two unequal numbers a, b, such that
f (z) ̸= a, f (z) ̸= b, for |z −z0| < r, then z0
is not an essential singularity.
Picard variety
Let V be a complete normal
variety. The factor group of the divisors on V ,
algebraically equivalent to 0 modulo the group
of divisors linearly equivalent to 0, has a natural
canonical structure of an Abelian variety, called
the Picard variety.

Let π be a set of prime numbers and

every Jordan-Hölder factor is either a π′-group
or a solvable π-group. For a π-solvable group
G, deﬁne a series of subgroups
1 = P0 ⊆N0 ⊂P1 ⊂N1 · · · ⊂Pn ⊆Nn = G

Then there exists a unique alge-

ψ(1) = 1 and ω(Yj) = Xj, j = 1, . . . , n.
Moreover, ψ is bijective, and the jth homoge-

Thus, the set of monomials {Xk1

∈R3 : x1, x2 ∈R} so that C cuts S along the
equator. Now for each point z ∈C consider the
straight line in R3 through z and N. This in-
tersects the sphere in exactly one point Z ̸= N.
By identifying Z ∈S with z ∈C, we have S
identiﬁed with C ∪{N}. If |z| > 1 then Z is in
the upper hemisphere and if |z| < 1 then z is in
the lower hemisphere; also, for |z| = 1, Z = z.
Clearly Z approaches N when |z| approaches
∞. Therefore, we may identify N and the point
∞in the extended complex plane.

Principal Ideal Theorem
There are at least
two results having this name:
(1) Let K be an algebraic number ﬁeld and
let H be the Hilbert class ﬁeld of K. Every ideal
of the ring of integers of K becomes principal
when lifted to an ideal of the ring of integers of
H. This was proved by Furtwängler in 1930.
(2) Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring
with 1. If x ∈R and P is minimal among the
prime ideals of R containing x, then the codi-
mension of P is at most 1 (that is, there is no
chain of prime ideals P ⊃P1 ⊃P2 (strict in-
clusions) in R). This was proved by Krull in
1928.

open subset U1 of pX(C), contained in pX(C),
and a nonempty open subset U2 of pY (C)), con-
tained in pY (C), such that all irreducible com-
ponents of C(x) = {y ∈Y : (x, y ∈C} have
the same dimension b2 for all x ∈U1 and such
that all irreducible components of C−1(y) =
{x ∈X : (x, y) ∈C} have the same dimension
b2 for all y ∈U2. These dimensions satisfy
a1 + b2 = a2 + b1.
principle of reﬂection
Two complex num-

reﬂection states that if the image of the circle
under a linear fractional transformation w =
(az + b)/(cz + d) is again a circle (this hap-
pens unless the image is a line), then the images
w1 and w2 of z1 and z2 are symmetric with re-

The Schwarz Reﬂection Principle of complex
analysis deals with the analytic continuation of
an analytic function deﬁned in an appropriate
set S, to the set of reﬂections of the points of S.
product
A term which includes many phe-
nomena. The most common are the following:
(1) The product of a set of numbers is the re-
sult obtained by multiplying them together. For
an inﬁnite product, this requires considerations
of convergence.
(2) If A1, . . . , An are sets, then the product
A1 × · · · × An is the set of ordered n-tuples
(a1, . . . , an) with ai ∈Ai for all i. This deﬁni-
tion can easily be extended to inﬁnite products.
(3) Let A1 and A2 be objects in a category C.
A triple (P, π1, π2) is called the product of A1
and A2 if P is an object of C, πi : P →Ai is
a morphism for i = 1, 2, and if whenever X is
another object with morphisms fi : X →Ai,
for i = 1, 2, then there is a unique morphism
f : X →P such that πif = fi for i = 1, 2.

the following way:

sion of the rational numbers Q. Then 
v |x|v =

taining the nth roots of unity, and let a and b
be nonzero elements of K. For a place v of K

proﬁnite group

times, the deﬁnition also requires the set Z to be
irreducible, in the sense that it is not the union
of two proper subvarieties.

Let A be a category. A pro-
jective class is a class P of objects in A such
that for each A ∈A there is a P ∈P and a
P-epimorphism f : P →A.

Consider left mod-
ules over a ring R with 1. Two ﬁnitely gener-
ated projective modules P1 and P2 are said to
be equivalent if there are ﬁnitely generated free
modules F1 and F2 such that P1⊕F1 ≃P2⊕F2.
The set of equivalence classes, with the opera-

projective cover
An object C in a category
C is the projective cover of an object A if it sat-
isﬁes the following three properties: (i.) C is
a projective object. (ii.) There is an epimor-
phism e : C →A. (iii.) There is no projective
object properly between A and C. In a gen-
eral category, this means that if g : C′ →A
and f : C →C′ are epimorphisms and C′ is
projective, then f is actually an isomorphism.
Thus, projective covers are simply injective en-
velopes “with the arrows turned around.” See
also epimorphism, injective envelope.
In most familiar categories, objects are sets
with structure (for example, groups, topologi-
cal spaces, etc.)
and morphisms are particu-
lar kinds of functions (for example, group ho-
momorphisms, continuous functions, etc.), and
epimorphisms are onto functions (surjections)
of a particular kind. Here is an example of a
projective cover in a speciﬁc category: In the
category of compact Hausdorff spaces and con-
tinuous maps, the projective cover of a space X
always exists, and is called the Gleason cover
of the space. It may be constructed as the Stone
space (space of maximal lattice ideals) of the
Boolean algebra of regular open subsets of X.
A subset is regular open if it is equal to the inte-
rior of its closure. See also Gleason cover, Stone
space.
projective dimension
Let R be a ring with
1 and let M be an R-module. The projective
dimension of M is the length of the smallest
projective resolution of M; that is, the projective
dimension is n if there is an exact sequence 0 →
Pn →· · · →P0 →M →0, where each
Pi is projective and n is minimal. If no such
ﬁnite resolution exists, the projective dimension
is inﬁnite.
projective general linear group
The quo-
tient group deﬁned as the group of invertible
matrices (of a ﬁxed size) modulo the subgroup
of scalar matrices.
projective limit
The inverse limit. See in-
verse limit.
projective module
A module M for which
there exists a module N such that M ⊕N is
free. Equivalently, M is projective if, whenever
there is a surjection f : A →M, there is a
homomorphism g : M →A such that fg is the
identity map of M.
projective morphism
A morphism f : X →
Y of algebraic varieties over an algebraically
closed ﬁeld K which factors into a closed im-
mersion X →Pn(K) × Y, followed by the pro-
jection to Y. This concept can be generalized to
morphisms of schemes.
projective object
An object P in a category C
satisfying the following mapping property: If e :
C →B is an epimorphism in the category, and
f : P →B is a morphism in the category, then
there exists a (usually not unique) morphism g :
P →C in the category such that e ◦g = f .
This is summarized in the following “universal
mapping diagram”:
P
f ↙
↘∃g
B
e
←−
C
Projectivity is simply injectivity “with the ar-
rows turned around.”
See also epimorphism,
injective object, projective module.
In most familiar categories, objects are sets
with structure (for example, groups, topologi-
cal spaces, etc.), and morphisms are particular
kinds of functions (for example, group homo-
morphisms, continuous maps, etc.), so epimor-
phisms are onto functions (surjections) of partic-
ular kinds. Here are two examples of projective
objects in speciﬁc categories: (i.) In the cate-
gory of Abelian groups and group homomor-
phisms, free groups are projective. (An Abelian
group G is free if it is the direct sum of copies
of the integers Z.) (ii.) In the category of com-
pact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps, the
projective objects are exactly the extremely dis-
connected compact Hausdorff spaces. (A com-
pact Hausdorff space is extremely disconnected
if the closure of every open set is again open.)

space.

resolution of B is an exact sequence,
· · ·
φ2
−→E1
φ1
−→E0
φ0
−→B −→0 ,
where every Ei is a projective left R module.
(We shall deﬁne exact sequence shortly.) There
is a companion notion for right R modules. Pro-
jective resolutions are extremely important in
homological algebra and enter into the dimen-
sion theory of rings and modules. See also ﬂat
resolution, injective resolution, projective mod-
ule, projective dimension.
An exact sequence is a sequence of left R
modules, such as the one above, where every
φi is a left R module homomorphism (the φi
are called “connecting homomorphisms”), such
that Im(φi+1) = Ker(φi). Here Im(φi+1) is the
image of φi+1, and Ker(φi) is the kernel of φi. In
the particular case above, because the sequence
ends with 0, it is understood that the image of φ0
is B, that is, φ0 is onto. There is a companion
notion for right R modules.

projective space
Let K be a ﬁeld and con-

i, . . . ) are equiv-
alent if there exists λ ∈K× such that x′
i =
λxi for all i. The set Pn(K) of all equivalence
classes is called n-dimensional projective space
over K.
It can be identiﬁed with the set of
lines through the origin in Kn+1. The equiv-
alence class of (x0, x1, . . . , xn) is often denoted
(x0 : x1 : · · · : xn). More generally, let R be a
commutative ring with 1. The scheme Pn(R) is
given as the set of homogeneous prime ideals of
R[X0, . . . , Xn] other than (X0, . . . , Xn), with a
structure sheaf deﬁned in terms of homogeneous
rational functions of degree 0. It is also possible
to deﬁne projective space Pn(S) for a scheme

called a purely inseparable element over K.

purely inseparable scheme
Given an ir-
reducible polynomial f (X) over a ﬁeld k, if
the formal derivative df/dX = 0, then f (X)

an irreducible polynomial f (X) is inseparable
if and only if f (X) = g(Xp). An algebraic
element α over k is called separable or insep-
arable over k if the minimal polynomial of α
over k is separable or inseparable.
An alge-
braic extension of k is called separable if all
elements of K are separable over k; otherwise,
K is called inseparable. If α is inseparable, then
k has nozero characteristic p and the minimal
polynomial f (X) of α can be decomposed as
f (X) = (X −α1)pr(X −α2)pr . . . (X −αm)pr,
r ≥1, where α1, . . . , αm are distinct roots of
f (X) in its splitting ﬁeld. If αpr ∈k for some
r, we call α purely inseparable over k. An al-
gebraic extension K of k is called purely in-
separable if all elements of the ﬁeld are purely
inseparable over k. Let V ⊂kn be a reduced
irreducible afﬁne algebraic variety. V is called
purely inseparable if the function ﬁeld k(V ) is
purely inseparable over k. Therefore, we can de-
ﬁne the same notion for reduced irreducible al-
gebraic varieties. Since there is a natural equiva-
lence between the category of algebraic varieties
overk andthecategoryofreduced, separated, al-
gebraic k-schemes, by identifying these two cat-
egories, we deﬁne purely inseparable reduced,
irreducible, algebraic k-schemes.

Racah algebra
Let A be a dynamical quan-
tity and let φ1 and φ2 be irreducible components
ofthestateobtainedbycombiningnangularmo-
menta. Racah algebra is a systematic method
of calculating the matrix element (φ1, Aφ2) in
quantum mechanics.
Racah coefﬁcient
Certain constants in Racah
algebra. Consider irreducible representations of
the rotation groups R = SO(3). The reduction
of the tensor product of three irreducible repre-
sentations can be done in two ways, (D(j1) ⊗
D(j2)) ⊗D(j3) and D(j1) ⊗(D(j2) ⊗D(j3))
and two corresponding sets of basis vectors. The
transformation coefﬁcient for the two ways of
reduction is written in the following form:
⟨j1j2 (j12) j3; j|j1, j2j3 (j23) ; j⟩

cients.
radian
A measure of the size of an angle. If
the vertex of an angle is at the center of a circle
of radius 1, the length of the arc on the circle
determined by the angle is the radian measure
of the angle. For example, a right angle is π/2
radians. One radian equals 180/π, which is ap-
proximately 57.3 degrees.
radical
A term that has many meanings:
(1) The nth root of a number.
(2) If R is a commutative ring with 1 and
I is an ideal in R, the radical of I is the set of
r ∈R suchthatrn ∈I forsomen(dependingon
r). The radical of the zero ideal is often called
the radical of R, or the nilradical of R. It is
the intersection of all prime ideals of R. The
Jacobson radical of R is the intersection of all
maximal ideals of R.
(3) In an arbitrary ring, the radical is the
largest ideal that is contained in the set of quasi-
invertible elements.
(4) The radical of an algebraic group is the
largest connected closed solvable normal sub-
group.

rationalization
The process of transforming
a radical expression into an expression with no
radicals, or with all radicals in the numerators.
See also rationalizing the denominator.
rationalization of denominator
Removing
radicals from the denominator of an algebraic
expression. For example, in an expression of the
form (a +b√n)/(c +d√n), where a, b, c, d, n
are rational numbers, multiplying numerator
and denominator by c −d√n.
The result is
of the form (r + s√n)/t, where r, s, t are ratio-
nal numbers. In some elementary mathematics
courses, it is taught that radicals in the denomi-
nator are undesirable.
rationalization of equation
The process of
transforming a radical equation into an equation
with no radicals. The method is to manipulate,
algebraically, the equation so only radicals are
on one side of the equal sign and then raise both
sides of the equation to the index of one of the
radicals. The process may need to be repeated.
rationalizing the denominator

rational map
(1) Informally, a rational func-
tion. See rational function.
(2) In algebraic geometry, a function from an
open subset U of a variety X to another variety
Y, which preserves regular functions. (Regu-
lar functions are functions which can be rep-
resented locally as quotients of polynomials.)
In more detail, let X and Y be varieties, and
let X be irreducible. (A variety is the solution
set of a system of polynomial equations. Irre-
ducible means the variety X is not the union of
two proper (̸= 0, ̸= X) subvarieties.) A rational
map F is an equivalence class of pairs (f, U),
where U is an open subset of X and f : U →Y
is a continuous function which preserves regular
functions. Preserving regular functions means
that if h : W →k is a regular function, where
W is an open subset of Y, then h ◦f is regular
on the open set {x ∈U : f (x) ∈W}. Two such
pairs (f, U) and (g, V ) are deemed equivalent
if f = g on U ∩V . It is a theorem that, given
a rational map F, there is a largest open set UM
such that a pair (f, UM) ∈F. Thus, one may
think of a rational map as an actual function de-
ﬁned on this maximal open set UM. The set UM
is referred to as the set of points on which F
is deﬁned. See also irreducible variety, regular
function.
rational number
A number that can be ex-
pressedasthequotientoftwointegersm/n, with
n ̸= 0. For example, 1/2, −9/4, 3, and 0 are ra-
tional numbers. The set of all rational numbers
forms a ﬁeld, denoted Q. See ﬁeld.
rational operation
Any of the four oper-
ations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division.
rational point
Let V be an algebraic variety
deﬁned over a ﬁeld k. A point P on V is rational
over k if the coordinates of P (in some afﬁne
open set containing P) lie in k.
See also k-
rational point.
rational rank of valuation
Let v be an addi-
tive valuation on a ﬁeld K with values in an or-
dered additive group. The supremum of the car-
dinalities of linearly independent (over Z) sub-
sets of v(K×) is called the rational rank of v.
rational representation
Let R be a commu-
tative ring with 1 and let G be a subgroup of
GLn(R) for some n. Let ρ : G →GLm(R)
for some m be a homomorphism.
Suppose
there exist m2 rational functions in n2 vari-
ables pst({Xij}) ∈R[{Xij}] with ρ((gij)) =
(pst(guv)) for all (gij) ∈G. Then ρ is called a

factorization domain with quotient ﬁeld F and
suppose f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0
is a polynomial with coefﬁcients in R. If c = p
q

f , then p divides a0 and q divides an.

R-basis
Let R be a ring contained in a pos-
sibly larger ring S. A left S module V has an
R-basis if V is freely generated as an R mod-
ule by a family of generators, vα, α ∈V . This
means (i.) each vα ∈V ; (ii.) if a ﬁnite sum
r1vα1 + · · · + rnvαn = 0, where r1, . . . rn ∈R,
then ri = 0 for i = 1, . . . n; (iii.) the set of all ﬁ-
nite sums r1vα1 +· · ·+rnvαn, where r1, . . . rn ∈
R, is equal to V . The family vα, α ∈A, is called
an R-basis for V .
The most important case of this occurs when
R is chosen to be the ring of integers, Z, in which
case an R basis is called a Z-basis. See also Z-
basis.

A complex num-
ber p + iq, p, q real, can be identiﬁed with the

real Lie algebra
A Lie algebra over the ﬁeld

real number
The real numbers, denoted R,
form a ﬁeld with binary operations of + (addi-
tion) and · (multiplication). This ﬁeld is also an
ordered ﬁeld: There exists a subset P ⊂R such
that (i.) if a, b ∈P then a +b ∈P and a ·b ∈P
and (ii.) the sets P , −P = {x ∈R : −x ∈P} ,
{0} (0 denotes the additive identity) are pairwise
disjoint and their union is R. Furthermore, the
ﬁeld R satisﬁes the completeness axiom: If S
is a non-empty subset of R and if S is bounded
above, then S has a least upper bound in R. With
these axioms, R is known as a complete ordered
ﬁeld. The existence of such a ﬁeld is taken as
an assumption by many. Others prefer to postu-
late the existence of the natural numbers N ⊂R
by means of the Peano postulates. See natu-
ral number. With these postulated, the integers,
Z are constructed from N and then the rational
numbers Q are constructed as the ﬁeld of quo-
tients of Z. To construct the real numbers from
the rationals requires more work. One way is to
use the method of Dedekind cuts and another in-
volves viewing the reals as equivalence classes
of Cauchy sequences. See also ﬁeld.
real part of complex number
If z = a +bi,
where a and b are real, is a complex number, the

set vj(a) = |σ(a)|2. The v1, . . . , vr1+r2 form a

Equivalence classes of the v1, . . . , vr1 are called
real prime divisors.

real variable
A variable whose domain is un-
derstood to be either the real numbers or a sub-
set of the real numbers. This is most often used
for emphasis to distinguish the domain from the
complex numbers. Functions whose domain of
deﬁnition is understood to be a subset of the real
numbers are called functions of a real variable.
reciprocal equation
A polynomial equation
oftheformanxn+an−1xn−1+· · ·+a1x+a0 = 0
where an = a0, an−1 = a1, etc. This has the
property that the reciprocal of any solution is
also a solution. Notice that if n is odd, then
this equation has root x = −1.
Division of
this equation by x + 1 then yields a recipro-
cal equation of degree n −1. If n is even, say
n = 2m, then the equation may be rewritten
as: a2mxm + a2m−1xm−1 + · · · + am + · · · +
a1( 1
x )m−1 + a0( 1
x )m = 0. Because of the sym-
metry of the coefﬁcients, we associate the ﬁrst
and last terms, the second and next-to-last terms,
etc., and consider the variable u = x+ 1
x , so that
x2 + 1
x2 = u2 −2, x3 + 1
x3 = u3 + 3u, . . . and
the equation reduces to an equation of degree m
in u.

Let R be
a commutative ring with identity and let M be
an R module. Let A be an associative algebra
over R. A homomorphism A →EndR(M) is
called a linear representation of A in M. An

The reciprocal of a
number a ̸= 0 is the number b =

a . Then
ab = 1, that is, the reciprocal of a number is its
multiplicative inverse. Note also that the recip-
rocal of b is a; in other words, the reciprocal of
the reciprocal of a nonzero number is the num-
ber itself.

proportion of two numbers. If a and b are two
numbers, the proportion of a to b is a

ciprocal proportion is b

ex = αx}. Suppose that 1 is written as a sum
of idempotents ei. If, for every i, we can write
Aei(1) = Kei +Ni, with Ni a nilpotent ideal of
Aei(1), then A is called a reduced algebra.
reduced basis
Let G be a discrete group of
motions in n-dimensional Euclidean space and
let T denote the subgroup of all translations in
G. Let {t1, . . . , tn} be a basis for T and let A
denote the Gram matrix aij = (ti, tj). (Here we
simply identify a translation with a vector; this
we may take as the image of 0 under the transla-
tion.) If the quadratic form q(x) =  aijxixj,

reduced character
Let ρ be a ﬁnite-dimen-
sional linear representation of an associative al-
gebra A over a ﬁeld K; that is, ρ : A →
EndK(M) is an algebra homomorphism, where
M is a K-module. Fix a basis of M and let Ta
denote the matrix (relative to this basis) asso-
ciated to the endomorphism of M which is the
image of a ∈A. For a ∈A set χρ(a) = Tr Ta;
χρ is a function on A and is called the charac-
ter of ρ. A character of an absolutely irreducible
representation is called an absolutely irreducible
character. (See absolutely irreducible represen-
tation.) The sum of all the absolutely irreducible
characters of A is called the reduced character
of A. See also reduced norm, reduced represen-
tation.
reduced Clifford group
Let K be a ﬁeld, E
a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over K, q(x)
a quadratic form on E, and C(q) the Clifford
algebra of the quadratic form q. Let G = {s ∈
C(q) : s is invertible, s−1Es = E}. G forms
a group relative to the multiplication of C(q);
G is called the Clifford group of q. C(q) is
the direct sum of two subalgebras, C+(q) and
C−(q), where C+(q) = K + E2 + E4 + · · ·
and C−(q) = E + E3 + · · · . The subgroup
G+ = G ∩C+(q) of G is called the special
Clifford group. C(q) has an antiautomorphism
β which is the identity when restricted to E.
This can be used to deﬁne a homomorphism
N from G+ to the multiplicative group of K
by N(s) = β(s) s, s ∈G+.
The kernel of
N, denoted G+
0 , is called the reduced Clifford
group of q. An element s ∈G induces a lin-
ear transformation φs on E by φs(x) = sxs−1,
x ∈E.
Such a φs belongs to the orthogo-
nal group of E relative to q and the mapping
s →φs is a homomorphism.
This gives a
representation φ : G →O(q). Furthermore,
φ(G+) = SO(q).
The subgroup φ(G+
0 ) of
SO(q) is called the reduced orthogonal group.
See Clifford algebra, Clifford group.
reduced dual
Let G be a unimodular locally
compact group with countable base. The sup-
port of the Plancherel measure in 
G is called the
reduced dual of G.

rectiﬁable curves on a Riemann surface R. We
say that a module problem is deﬁned for > if

Now let A be a simply connected domain of
hyperbolic type in C with z0 ∈A. If r > 0 is
small, then
A ∩{z : |z −z0| > r}
is a doubly connected domain A(r). Let A(r)

Let ρ : A →EndK(M) be

associative algebra A over a ﬁeld K in a ﬁnite di-
mensional K-module M. Fix a basis for M and,
for a ∈A, let Ta denote the matrix representa-
tion, with respect to this basis, of the endomor-
phism ρ(a). For a ∈A, deﬁne Nρ(a) = det Ta;
this is called the norm of a and it depends only
on the representation class of ρ. The norm is, up
to a constant of the form (−1)r (where r is the
degree of the representation), equal to the con-
stant term in the characteristic polynomial of Ta.
If pα(x) denotes the principal polynomial of α,
then the reduced norm of α is the constant term
of pα(x) multiplied by (−1)r.

Let V be an n-
dimensional vector space over R and q(x) =
 aijξiξj a quadratic form on V , where the
aij, i, j ∈{1, . . . , n} are given elements of R,
and the ξi ∈R are the coordinates of the vec-
tor x ∈V relative to a ﬁxed basis of V . Set
A = [aij]. The quadratic form q is said to be
reduced if the matrix A is positive deﬁnite and
satisﬁes: (i.) ai i+1 ≥0 for 1 ≤i ≤n −1 and
(ii.) xT
k Axk ≥akk whenever xk is a 1×n vector
of the form xk = [y1, . . . , yn]T , where the yi are

associative algebra over a ﬁeld. The direct sum
of all absolutely irreducible representations of

character is the reduced character. See abso-
lutely irreducible representation, reduced char-
acter.
(2) Let I be an ideal in a commutative ring
with identity. The ideal I is said to have a pri-
mary representation (or primary decomposition)
if I = Q1 ∩Q2 ∩· · · ∩Qn, where each Qi is
a primary ideal. If no Qi contains the intersec-
tion of all the others, and if the radicals of the Qi
(which are prime ideals) are distinct, the primary
representation is said to be reduced.
reduced scheme
A scheme (X, OX) such
that, for every open set U ⊆X, the ring OX(U)
has no nilpotent elements. See also scheme.
reduced von Neumann algebra
Let H be a
Hilbert space and let B(H) denote the algebra
of bounded operators on H. A subalgebra M
of B(H) is called a ∗-subalgebra if T ∗∈M
whenever T ∈M. A ∗-subalgebra is called
a von Neumann algebra if it contains the iden-
tity and is closed in the weak operator topol-
ogy. Let P ∈B(H) be a projection operator
in a von Neumann algebra M. Then the set
MP = {PT P : T ∈M} is a ∗-subalgebra
of B(H) which is closed in the weak operator
topology but does not contain the identity. Nev-
ertheless, because P is a projection, the oper-
ators in this subalgebra map the Hilbert space
P(H) to itself and MP is a von Neumann alge-
bra on the Hilbert space P(H); MP is called a
reduced von Neumann algebra on P(H).
reducible component
A component of a
topological space X that is not irreducible. Here
a nonempty subset Y of X is irreducible if it can-
not be expressed as the union Y = Y1 ∪Y2 of
two nonempty proper subsets, each of which is
closed in Y.

K[x]. An equation of the form p(x) = 0 is said

reducible linear representation
(1) Let K
be a commutative ring with identity and let M be
a K-module. Let A be an associative K algebra.
A linear representation of A in M is an algebra
homomorphism, ρ : A →EndK(M) of A into
the algebra of all K endomorphisms of M. Such
a representation can be used to make M into a
left A module by deﬁning am = ρ(a)m, when-
ever a ∈A, m ∈M. If M is a simple A module,
then ρ is said to be irreducible; otherwise it is
called reducible.
(2) Let G be a group and K a ﬁeld. A linear
representation of G over K is a homomorphism
ρ from G to the matrix group GLm(K). The
representation is said to be reducible if there is
another representation σ : G →GLm(K) such
that there exists a matrix T ∈GLm(K) with
T −1ρ(g)T = σ(g) for all g ∈G and so that
σ(g) has the form σ(g) =
σ11(g)
σ12(g)

σ22(g)

for all g ∈G.
reducible linear system
Let X be a com-
plete irreducible variety. Consider f1, . . . , fn,
elements of the function ﬁeld of X, and let D be
a divisor on X with D+(fi) positive for every i.
(Here (fi) denotes the divisor of fi. See princi-
pal divisor of functions.) The set of all divisors
of the form ( kifi) + D, where the ki are el-
ements of the underlying ﬁeld, and not all zero,
is called a linear system. The linear system is
irreducible if all its elements are irreducible; if
not, then it is called reducible.
reducible matrix
An n × n matrix A such
that either (i.) n = 1 and A = 0 or (ii.) n ≥
2 and there is an n × n permutation matrix P
and an integer m with 1 ≤m < n such that
P T AP =
C
D
0
E

, where C is m × m, E is
(n −m) × (n −m), D is m × (n −m), and 0
denotes an (n −m) × m matrix of zeros.
reducible polynomial
A polynomial f (x) ∈
R[x], that is, a polynomial with coefﬁcients
in a ring R, which can be written as f (x) =
g(x)h(x) with g(x) and h(x) polynomials of
lower degree which are not units in R.
reducible variety
Let K be a ﬁeld. If S ⊂
K[x1, . . . , xn], the set of all common zeros of
S, that is, the set of all (a1, . . . , an) ∈Kn such
that f (a1, . . . , an) = 0 for every f ∈S, is
called an afﬁne K-variety. Likewise, a set in n-
dimensional projective space over K consisting
of common zeros of a set of homogeneous poly-
nomials is called a projective variety. An afﬁne
or projective K-variety V is reducible if it can
be written as V = W1 ∪W2, where each Wi is
a K-variety and a proper subset of V .
reduction formulas of trigonometry
The
formulae: sin(θ + 2πk) = sin(θ), cos(θ +
2πk) = cos(θ) for k an integer; sin( π
2 −θ) =
cos(θ), cos( π
2 −θ) = sin(θ) and sin(θ + π) =
−sin(θ), cos(θ + π) = −cos(θ). These allow
one to express a trigonometric function of any
angle in terms of the sine and/or cosine of an
angle in the interval [0, π
2 ).
reduction modulus
The construction of ρσ
from ρ, where K, L are commutative rings with
identity, σ : K →L is an isomorphism such
that σ : K →K/m is the canonical homo-
morphism, m is an ideal of K, Mσ is the scalar
extension σ ∗M = M ⊗K L of a K-module M
relative to σ, and ρ is the linear representation
associated with M. The linear representation
ρσ over L associated with Mσ is the scalar ex-
tension of ρ relative to σ and is the conjugate
representation of ρ relative to σ.
reduction of algebraic expression
A modi-
ﬁcation of an algebraic expression to a simpler
or more desirable form. For example, (x+2)2−
(x + 2)(x −2) can be reduced to 4(x + 2).
reductive
A Lie algebra G is reductive if it is
fully reducible under ad G0.
reductive action
Let K be a commutative
ring with identity and let ρ : G →GL(m, K) be
a rational representation of a matrix group G ⊂
GL(n, K). Suppose that R is a ring generated
by elements x1, . . . , xm over K. An action of
the group ρ(G) on R can then be used to deﬁne
an action of G on R by gr = ρ(g)r, g ∈G,
r ∈R. This action is said to be reductive if the
following condition is satisﬁed: Suppose M is
a module generated by y1, . . . , yr ∈R over K,
which is mapped by G to itself and f0 mod M
is G-invariant. Then there is a homogeneous
c

linear form h in f0, f1, . . . , fr such that h is
monic in f0 and h is G invariant. See rational
representation.
reductivegroup
LetGbeanalgebraicgroup.
Let N denote the maximal connected solvable
closed normal subgroup of G. If the identity
element is the only unipotent element of N, then
G is called a reductive group.
reductive Lie algebra
A Lie algebra A such
that the radical of A is the center of A. This
is equivalent to the condition that the adjoint
representation of A is completely reducible.
The radical of A is the union of all solvable
ideals of A.
redundant equation
(1) An equation con-
taining extraneous roots that have been intro-
duced by an algebraic operation. For example,
the equation x −2 = √x when squared yields
the equation x2 −5x + 4 = 0. This has roots
4 and 1; however, 1 is not a root of the original
equation. The equation x2 −5x + 4 = 0 is said
to be redundant because of this extraneous root.
(2) An equation in a system of equations that
is a linear combination of other equations in the
system. The solution to the system remains un-
changed if this equation is excluded.
Ree group
Any member of the family of
ﬁnite simple groups of Lie type, 2G2(3n) and
2F4(2n), for n odd.
reﬁnement of chain
A chain C1 in a partially
ordered set M is a reﬁnement of a chain C2 in M
if the least and greatest elements of each chain
agree, and if every element of the chain C2 be-
longs to C1. C1 is a proper reﬁnement of C2 if
there is at least one element of C1 which does
not belong to C2.
reﬂection
(1) The mirror image of a point or
object.
A reﬂection in a line of a point P1 is the point
P2 on the opposite side of the line equidistant
from the line; that is, the point P2 such that the
line is the perpendicular bisector of the segment
P1P2, joining the point and its reﬂection. The
reﬂection of a geometric object in a line is just
the collection of all reﬂections of its constituent
points in the line.
If (x, y) is a point in the plane, the reﬂection
of (x, y) in the origin is the point (−x, −y);
the reﬂection of a geometric object in the origin
is the collection of reﬂections of its constituent
points.
In a similar fashion, deﬁne the reﬂection of
a point in a plane; for example, the reﬂection of
(x, y, z) in the x, y plane in three dimensions
is the point (x, y, −z). Likewise, reﬂection in
the origin is deﬁned in the same way in higher
dimensions.
(2) In the study of groups of symmetries of
geometric objects, a group element correspond-
ing to a transformation reﬂecting the object in a
line or plane. In greater generality, a reﬂection
is a mapping of an n-dimensional simply con-
nected space of constant curvative which has an
n −1 dimensional hyperplane as its set of ﬁxed
points. In this case, the set of ﬁxed points of the
mapping is called the mirror of the mapping.
reﬂexive property
The property of a relation
R on a set S:
(a, a) ∈R for every a ∈S .
In other words, a relation has the reﬂexive prop-
erty if every element is related to itself.
See
relation.
reﬂexive relation
A relation having the re-
ﬂexive property. See reﬂexive property.
regula falsi
Literally, “rule of false position,”
an iterative method for ﬁnding a real solution of
an equation f (x) = 0. Suppose that f (x1) and
f (x2) have opposite sign. The method is to con-
sider the point of intersection of the x-axis with
the chord through (x1, f (x1)) and (x2, f (x2)).
This point has x coordinate
x3 = x1 −f (x1)

x2 −x1
f (x2) −f (x1)

.
The procedure is repeated with the point (x3,
f (x3)) and either (x1, f (x1)) or (x2, f (x2)), de-
pending on which of f (x1) or f (x2) has sign
opposite to f (x3). This converges more slowly
than Newton’s method.

(2) In algebraic geometry, a function which

variety is the solution set of a system of poly-
nomial equations.) Let V be an open subset of
X. Let f : V →k be a function from V to a
ﬁeld k. The function f is regular at the point
p ∈V if there is an open neighborhood U of
p, contained in V , on which f = g/h, where

regular if it is regular at each point of its domain
V .

A left ideal J in a ring R, for
which there exists an e ∈R such that r −re ∈J
for every r ∈R. Similarly, a right ideal J, for
which there exists an e ∈R such that r −er ∈R
for every r ∈R. Note that if R has an identity,
then all ideals are regular.
regular local ring
Let R be a local ring and
set k = R/m. Then k is a ﬁeld. A local Noethe-
rian ring is called regular if dimk m/m2 =
dim R. (Here dim is the Krull dimension. See
Krull dimension.) See also local ring.

with nonvanishing Jacobian determinant be-
tween two manifolds of the same dimension.
(2) A mapping given by an n-tuple of regular
functions from a variety to a variety contained
in afﬁne n-space. See regular function.
regular matrix
(1) A Markov chain is a prob-
ability model for describing a system that ran-
domly moves among different states over suc-
cessive periods of time.
For such a process,
let aij denote the probability that a process cur-
rently in state j will in the next step be in state
i. The matrix A = [aij] is called the transition
matrix of the chain. Note that the entries of A
are all nonnegative and the sum of the elements
in each column of A is 1. The matrix A is said
to be regular if there is a positive integer n such
that An has all positive entries.
(2) Sometimes, a synonym for non-singular
or invertible matrix. See inverse matrix.
regular module
Let R be a commutative ring
with 1 and M an R-module. An element x ∈M
is said to be regular if, for every r ∈R, there
exists t ∈R such that rx = rtrx. A submodule
N of M is regular if each element of N is regular.
In particular, M is regular if each of its elements
is regular.

regular polyhedral group
The group of mo-
tions which preserve a regular polygon in the
plane, or the group of motions in three dimen-
sional space that preserve a regular polyhedron.
The group of motions preserving a regular n-gon
in the plane is called the dihedral group Dn; it
has order 2n. The alternating group A4 can be
realized as the group of motions preserving a
tetrahedron, and A5 can be realized as the group
of motions preserving an iscosahedron; they are
called the tetrahedral and iscosahedral groups,
respectively. Similarly, the symmetric group S4
is called the octahedral group because it can be
realized as the group of motions preserving an
octahedron.
regular prime
A prime number which is not
irregular. See irregular prime.
regular representation
(1) Let K be a com-
mutative ring with identity and let A be a K alge-
bra. An element a ∈A can then be viewed as an
element of the algebra of K endomorphisms on
A via x "→a x for all x ∈A. Such a representa-

tion is called a left regular representation. If A
has an identity, this is a faithful representation.
In a similar way, deﬁne right regular represen-
tation.
(2) Let G be a group and, for a ∈G, deﬁne
a mapping g "→ag. In this way each a ∈G
induces a permutation on the set G. This gives
a representation of G as a permutation group on
G; this is called the left regular representation
of G. In a similar way, deﬁne right regular rep-
resentation. See also left regular representation,
right regular representation.
regular ring
(1) An element a in a ring R
is called regular in the sense of Von Neumann
if there exists x ∈R such that axa = a. If
every element of R is regular, then R is said to
be a regular ring. Note that every division ring
is regular, whereas the ring of integers is not.
(2) A regular local ring. See regular local
ring.
regularsystemofequations
(1)Anonsingu-
lar system of n linear equations in n unknowns.
If we denote such a system as Ax = b, where
A is an n × n matrix, and x and b are n × 1
matrices, then A has nonzero determinant and
for each n×1 vector b there is a unique solution
x. Also called a Cramer system.
(2) More generally, if p1(x1, . . . , xm), . . . ,
pn(x1, . . . , xm) are n polynomials in m vari-
ables over a ﬁeld k, the system of equations
p1 = 0, . . . , pn = 0 is called regular if it has
a ﬁnite number of solutions in an algebraically
closed ﬁeld containing k.
regular transitive permutation group
A
permutation group P is a subgroup of the sym-
metric group of permutations of a set S. If S has
at least two elements and if, for every α, β ∈S,
there exists a p ∈P such that pα = β, then P is
said to be transitive. If, in addition, no element
of P , except for the identity, ﬁxes any element
of S, then P is called a regular transitive per-
mutation group.
regular variety
A non-singular projective
algebraic variety with zero irregularity. A va-
riety which is not regular is called an irregular
variety. See irregular variety, irregularity.
regulator
Let K be an algebraic number ﬁeld
and let U(K) denote the units of K. If K has
degree n, then there are n ﬁeld embeddings of K
into the complex numbers C. Let r1 be the num-
ber of real embeddings, and r2 be the number
of complex embeddings (these occur in pairs)
so that r1 + 2r2 = n. Write σ1, . . . , σr1 for
the real embeddings and σr1+1, . . . , σn for the
complex embeddings and order the latter so that
σ r1+i = σr1+r2+i for i = 1, . . . , r2. It is a theo-
remofDirichletthatU(K)isaﬁnitelygenerated
Abelian group of rank r = r1 + r2 −1 and so
there exists a fundamental system of units for
K; these we denote by u1, . . . , ur. For x ∈C
let ∥x∥denote the absolute value of x if x is
real, and the square of the modulus of x if x
is complex. The regulator of K is the abso-
lute value of the determinant of any (all have the
same value) r×r submatrix of the r×(r+1) ma-
trix [ ln∥σj(ui)∥], 1 ≤i ≤r, 1 ≤j ≤r + 1.
related angle
Given an angle α whose ter-
minal side does not necessarily lie in the ﬁrst
quadrant, the related angle of α is the angle in
the ﬁrst quadrant whose trigonometric functions
have the same absolute value. For example, π
6
radians is the related angle of 7π
6 radians, 70◦is
the related angle of 290◦.
relation
For A and B be sets, a relation be-
tween A and B is a subset R of A × B. Most
often considered is the case when A = B; in this
case it is said that R is a relation on A. For exam-
ple, = is a relation on the set of real numbers;
for each pair (a, b) ∈R × R it can be deter-
mined whether or not (a, b) ∈R = {(a, a)}.
Similarly, <, >, ≤, and ≥are relations on the
real numbers. See also reﬂexive relation, sym-
metric relation, transitive relation, equivalence
relation.

If K is an
algebraic number ﬁeld and k a subﬁeld of K,
the extension of K over k is called a relative

relative chain complex
If R is a ring, a chain
complex of R-modules is a family {Kn, ∂n}, n ∈
Z, of R-modules Kn and R-module homomor-
phisms ∂n : Kn →Kn−1 such that ∂n∂n+1 = 0
for every n. A subcomplex of such a chain com-
plex is a family of R-submodules Sn ⊂Kn
such that ∂nSn ⊂Sn−1 for every n.
In this

relative cochain complex
If R is a ring, a
cochain complex of R is a family {Kn, dn}, n ∈
Z, of R-modules Kn and R-module homomor-
phisms dn : Kn →Kn+1 such that dn+1dn = 0
for every n.
(In other words, {K−n, d−n} is
a chain complex.)
A cochain subcomplex of
such a cochain complex is a sequence of R-
submodules Sn ⊂Kn such that dnSn ⊂Sn+1
for every n.
In this case each dn induces a
well-deﬁned homomorphism of quotient mod-
ules: d′
n : Kn/Sn →Kn+1/Sn+1; furthermore,
d′
n+1d′
n = 0 for every n. {Kn/Sn, d′

a relative cochain complex. Cohomology and

ogy and relative homology. See relative chain

relative degree
Let F be a ﬁnite dimensional
ﬁeld extension of a ﬁeld K, and denote the de-
gree of the extension by [F : K]. Suppose L and
M are intermediate ﬁelds: K ⊆L ⊆M ⊆F.
The relative degree (or dimension) of L and M is
the number [M : L]. This terminology allows a
concise statement of the Fundamental Theorem
of Galois Theory: If F is a ﬁnite dimensional
Galois extension of K, then the relative degree
of two intermediate ﬁelds is equal to the relative
index of their corresponding subgroups of the
Galois group.
relative derived functor
A homological al-
gebra concerns a pair of algebraic categories
(U, M) and a ﬁxed functor ) : U →M. A
short exact sequence of objects of U
0 →A →B →C →0
is called admissible if the exact sequence
0 →)A →)B →)C →0
splits in M. By means of the class E of admis-
sible exact sequences, the class of E-projective
(resp. E-injective) objects is deﬁned as the class
of objects P (resp. Q) for which the functor
HomU(P, −) (resp. HomU(−, Q)) is exact on
the admissible short exact sequences. If U con-
tains enough E-projective or E-injective objects,
then the usual construction of homological alge-
bra makes it possible to construct derived func-
tors in this category, which are called relative
derived functors. See also derived functor.
relative different
Let K be a relative alge-
braic number ﬁeld over k.
Let D and d de-
note the integers of K and k, respectively; that
is, D = K ∩I and d = k ∩I, where I is
the algebraic integers.
Set D = {α ∈K :
TrK/k(αD) ⊂d}, whereTrK/k denotesthetrace.
Dis a fractional ideal in K and (D)−1 = DK/k

different of K over k.

relative invariant
(1) Let K be a ﬁeld and let
F be an extension ﬁeld of K. Let G be a group
of automorphisms of F over K, and suppose that
K is the ﬁxed ﬁeld of the group G. A relative
invariant of G in F is a nonzero element Q ∈
F such that, for each σ ∈G, there exists an
element χ(σ) in K for which σ(Q) = χ(σ)Q.

Let (X, OX) be a scheme.
Let F be a sheaf of O-modules and construct a
projective bundle P(F) on X. A locally closed
S-subscheme f : X →S of p : P(F) →S
is called quasiprojective over S.
For such a
quasiprojective scheme, an invertible sheaf L on
X is called ample over S if there exist a locally
free OS-module of ﬁnite type on S and an im-
mersion ι : X →P(F) such that OX(1) = L.
If L⊗n is ample for some n, L is said to be rel-

A quasiprojective

resentative which is a relatively minimal variety
is called a relatively minimal model.

relative norm
Let K and k be algebraic num-
ber ﬁelds with k ⊂K and set n = [K : k]. Then
there are n k-linear embeddings φi : K →C.
For an ideal U of K, U(i) = {φi(u) : u ∈U} is
an ideal of φi(K). Let L be the ﬁeld generated
by φi(K), i = 1, . . . , n. The ideal in L gener-
ated by the U(i) is the extension of an ideal a of
k; a is called the relative norm of U over k.
remainder
(1) If a is an integer and b is a
positive integer, then there is a unique pair of
integers q, r with 0 ≤r < b such that a =
qb + r. The integer q is called the quotient and
r is called the remainder.
(2) More generally, the terminology can be
applied in any Euclidean domain; here, by def-
inition, there is such a division algorithm. This
can also be applied in polynomial rings:
If
R is an integral domain and if a(x), b(x) ∈
R[X], then there exists q(x), r(x) ∈R[X] with
deg r(x) < deg b(x) or r(x) = 0 such that
a(x) = b(x)q(x) + r(x). Again, q(x) is called
the quotient of the division of a(x) by b(x) and
r(x) is called the remainder.
Remainder Theorem
Suppose R is a ring

that f (x) = anxn+an−1xn−1+· · ·+a1x+a0 ∈
R[x], that is, f (x) is a polynomial with coefﬁ-
cients in R. The Remainder Theorem states that
for any c ∈R there exists a unique q(x) ∈R[x]
such that f (x) = q(x)(x −c) + f (c).

We may consider any decimal that terminates as
a repeating decimal by simply considering that
it ends in an inﬁnite sequence of zeros. With this
convention, every repeating decimal is a rational
number.

K and V ∗its dual. For A in EndKV (the K-

representation
A mapping from an algebraic
system to another system, usually to one which
is better understood. The idea is to preserve the
structure of the original system as an image and
to take advantage of knowledge of the system
containing this image. There are a multitude of
examples of this and here we list only the more
common representations.
(1) Let G be a group. Let ρ : G →H be
a homomorphism of G to another group H; ρ
is then called a representation of G. In partic-
ular, a homomorphism ρ : G →Sn of G into
a permutation group Sn of permutations of a set
of n elements is known as a permutation repre-
sentation. Cayley’s Theorem is that every ﬁnite
group can be so represented using a monomor-
phism. A homomorphism of G into GL(n, K),
the set of invertible n × n matrices over a com-
mutative ring K with identity, is called a matrix
representation of G.
(2) Let R be a commutative ring with identity
and let M be a module over R. Let EndR(M) de-
note the ring of R-linear maps of M onto itself.
Let A be an associative R-algebra. A represen-
tation of A in M is an R-algebra homomorphism
ρ : A →EndR(M).
(3) Let X be a Banach space and A a Banach
algebra. Let B(X) denote the space of bounded
linear operators on X. A representation of A in
X is an algebra homomorphism ρ : A →B(X)
which satisﬁes ∥ρ(a)∥≤∥a∥for every a ∈A.
(4) Let G be a topological group and let H
be a Hilbert space. A homomorphism U from
G to the group of unitary linear operators on H
is called a unitary representation of G if U is
strongly continuous, that is, for every x ∈H,
g "→Ugx is a continuous mapping from G to
H.
representation module
Let R be a com-
mutative ring with identity and let ρ : A →
EndR(M) be a linear representation of an R-
algebra A in an R-module M. M can be made
into a left A-module, called the representation
module of ρ, by deﬁning am = ρ(a)m, for
a ∈A, m ∈M.
representation space
For a representation
from an algebraic structure G to the space of
endomorphisms on an algebraic structure H, the
representation space is H. See representation.
We give several examples; all are fairly similar.
(i.) Let k be a commutative ring with identity
and A an associative algebra over k. Let E be
a module over k and let ρ : A →Endk(E) (the
space of k endomorphisms of E) be a represen-
tation. E is called the representation space.
(ii.) Let A be a Banach algebra and X a Ba-
nach space. For a representation of A on X, X
is the representation space.
(iii.) Let G be a topological group and let ρ
be a representation of G to the group of unitary
operators on some Hilbert space H. H is called
the representation space.
representation without multiplicity
Let U
beaunitaryrepresentationofatopologicalgroup
G on a Hilbert space H, that is, a homomor-
phism U from G to a group of unitary operators
on H. A subspace N of H is called invariant
if Ug(N) ⊂N for every g ∈G. (For g ∈G,
Ug denotes the unitary operator that is the image
of g.) For g ∈G let Vg = Ug |N. This gives
a unitary representation V of G on N; this is
called the subrepresentation of U on N. If H
can be written as the direct sum H = H1 ⊕H2
where the Hi are orthogonal, closed, and invari-
ant, then U is said to be the direct sum of the sub-
representations U1 and U2 of U on H1 and H2,
respectively. A unitary representation is called
a representation without multiplicity if, when-
ever U is the direct sum of subrepresentations
U1 and U2, then U1 and U2 have the property
that no subrepresentation of U1 is equivalent to
a subrepresentation of U2. (Two unitary repre-
sentations U1 : G →H1 and U2 : G →H2 are
said to be equivalent if there exists an isometry
T : H1 →H2 such that T U1g = U2gT for all
g ∈G.)
representative function
Let G be a compact
Lie group, and let C(G) denote the algebra of
continuous complex valued functions on G. For
each g ∈G, let Tg denote the operator of left
translation: Tg(x) = gx for x ∈G. Tg acts on
C(G) by Tg(f ) = f ◦Tg. A function f ∈C(G)
is called a representative function if the vector
space over C generated by the set of all Tg(f ),
g ∈G, has ﬁnite dimension. The collection
of all such functions is called the representative
ring of G.

representative of equivalence class
An
equivalence relation on a set S partitions the set
S into disjoint sets, each consisting of related el-
ements, that is, the set is partitioned into sets of
the form Ax = {y ∈S : x ∼y}, called equiv-
alence classes. Any element of an equivalence
class is called a representative of that equiva-
lence class. See equivalence relation.

See representative func-
tion.
representing measure
(1) A measure that
represents a functional on a function space in the
sense that the value of the functional at an ele-
mentf canberealizedsimplyasintegrationoff
with respect to the measure. A typical theorem
regarding the existence of such a measure is the
Riesz representation theorem: Let X be a locally
compact Hausdorff space and let T be a positive
linear functional deﬁned on the function space
consisting of continuous functions on X of com-
pact support. Then there exists a σ-algebra A
containing the Borel sets of X and a unique pos-
itive measure µ on A such that Tf =

X f dµ
for every f which is continuous and of compact
support on X. In this case, µ is said to represent
the functional T .
(2) On a function space with the property that
the functionals f "→f (ζ) are bounded, for ζ
in some planar set O, the representing measures
for the points of O are measures representing
the evaluation functionals in the sense of (1).
That is, representing measures are given by µ =
µζ, carried on a set λ, often contained in the
boundary of O, such that
f (ζ) =

λ
f (z) dµζ(z) .
R-equivalence
Let R be a ring contained in
a possibly larger ring S. Let V and W be S
modules with ﬁnite R bases BV and BW. The
modules V and W are R-equivalent if there is
an S module isomorphism between V and W
which, relative to the bases BV and BW, has a
matrix U with all entries in the ring R, and such
that the inverse matrix U−1 also has all entries
in the ring R. It is a theorem that R-equivalence
is independent of the particular choice of the
bases, BV and BW. See also isomorphism.
The most important case of this occurs when
R is chosen to be the ring of integers, Z, in which
case R-equivalence is called Z-equivalence. Z-
equivalence is related to the classical notion of
integral equivalence for matrices. See also in-
tegral equivalence, Z-equivalence.
residue class
Suppose R is a ring and I is
an ideal in R. For x, y ∈R, we say that x is
congruent to y modulo I if x −y ∈I. It is
straightforward to check that congruence mod-
ulo I is an equivalence relation on R. A coset
of I in R is called a residue class modulo I. If
I is a principal ideal generated by an element
a ∈R, the residue class modulo I is sometimes
referred to as the residue class modulo a; in par-
ticular, this is used in the case when R = Z. See
also residue ring.
residue class ﬁeld
Suppose R is a commuta-
tive ring with identity 1 ̸= 0, and M is an ideal
in R. The quotient ring or residue ring, R/M,
is a ﬁeld if and only if M is a maximal ideal.
In this case R/M is known as the residue class
ﬁeld or residue ﬁeld. See also residue ring.
residue ﬁeld
See residue class ﬁeld.
residue ring
Let R be a ring and I an ideal
of R. Deﬁne a relation ∼on R by x ∼y if
x −y ∈I; this is an equivalence relation. Since
I is a normal subgroup of R under the operation
+, the equivalence classes are cosets which we
write additively: a+I. The set of all such cosets
can be made into a ring with addition deﬁned by
(a+I)+(b+I) = (a+b)+I and multiplication
deﬁned by (a + I)(b + I) = ab + I. This ring
is called the residue ring, residue class ring, or
quotient ring and is denoted R/I.
Residue Theorem
(1) Suppose f (z) is an
analytic function with an isolated singularity at a
point a. The residue of f at a is the coefﬁcient of
(z−a)−1 in the Laurent expansion of f at a; we
denote this by res[f ; a]. The Residue Theorem
states that if f is analytic in a simply connected
domain A, except for isolated singularities, and
if γ is a simple closed rectiﬁable curve lying in
A and not passing through any singularities of

over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k. Let K be the
function ﬁeld of X. Let AX denote the sheaf of
differentials of X over k and AK be the module
of differentials of K over k. For P ∈X, let AP
denote its stalk at P. It can be shown that for
each closed point P ∈X, there exists a unique
k-linear map resP : AK →k which has the
following properties: (i.) resP (τ) = 0 for all
τ ∈AP , (ii.) resP (f ndf ) = 0 for all n ̸=

n × 1 matrices. One method for approximat-
ing the solution, x, involves ﬁnding a sequence
of approximations xk by means of an iterative
formula xk = xk−1 + R(b −Axk−1), where R
is chosen to approximate A−1. If the spectral
radius of I −RA is less than 1, the xk con-

Riemann-Hurwitz formula
Let M1 and M2
be compact connected Riemann surfaces. If f :
M1 →M2 is holomorphic and p ∈M1, we
may choose coordinate systems at p and f (p)
so that locally f can be expressed as f (w) =
wnh(w) where h(w) is holomorphic and h(0) ̸=
0. (Here 0 is the image of both p and f (p) under
the respective coordinate maps.) Set bf (p) =
n −1; this is called the branch number. The
total branching number of f is deﬁned as B =
 bf (p), where the sum runs over all p ∈M.
The equidistribution property states that there
exists a positive integer m such that every q ∈
M2 is assumed m times counting multiplicity,
that is, (bf (p) + 1) = m for every q ∈M2,
where the sum is taken over all p ∈f −1(q).

conjecture that all of the zeros of the zeta func-
tion in this strip must lie on the line ℜ(z) = 1

Riemann surface
There are analytic “func-
tions” (for example w = √z) that are naturally
considered as multiple valued. Such functions
are better understood using Riemann surfaces:
the idea is to consider the image as a surface con-
sisting of a suitable number of sheets so that the
mapping can be considered as one-to-one from
the z to w surfaces. For example, the function
w = z
1
3 can be viewed as a three-sheeted sur-
face (all elements of the complex plane, except
zero, have three cube roots) over the complex
plane. Locally, this mapping is one-to-one from
the plane to the surface. More precisely, a con-
nected Hausdorff space is called a Riemann sur-
face if it is a complex manifold of one com-
plex dimension.
Any simply connected Rie-
mann surface can be conformally mapped to one
of the following: the ﬁnite complex plane, the
complex plane together with the point at inﬁnity
(the Riemann sphere), or the interior of the unit
circle. Respectively, the surface is then called
parabolic, elliptic, or hyperbolic.
Riemann theta function
Let R be a compact
Riemann surface of genus g. Let {ω1, . . . , ωg}
be a basis for the space of Abelian differentials
of the ﬁrst kind, and let {α1, . . . , α2g} be normal
sections forming a basis for the homology, with
coefﬁcients in Z, of R. (See Riemann’s period
inequality.) Set A = (ωij), where ωij =

αj ωi.
It is possible to choose the ωi so that A has the
form A = (Ig, F), where Ig is a g × g identity
matrix and F is a g × g complex symmetric
matrix whose imaginary part is positive deﬁnite.

right regular representation
(1) Let R be
a commutative ring with identity and let M be
an R-algebra. For r ∈R, consider the mapping
ρr : M →M given by right translation (i.e.,
ρr(x) = xr, for x ∈M). The mapping ρ :
R →HomZ(M, M) given by ρ(r) = ρr is an
antihomomorphism; it is called the right regular
representation of M. If M has an identity, this
is a faithful representation.
(2) Let G be a group, and for a ∈G deﬁne
a mapping g →ga. In this way, each a ∈G
induces a permutation on the set G. This gives
a representation of G as a permutation group
on G (again, the representation is an antihomo-
morphism): this is called the right regular rep-
resentation. See also regular representation, left
regular representation.

The side opposite the right angle is called the
hypotenuse and the sides adjacent the right an-
gle are often called the legs of the triangle. The
Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right tri-
angle the sum of the squares of the lengths of
the legs is equal to the square of the length of
the hypotenuse.
ring
A nonempty set R, with two binary op-
erations, usually denoted by + and ·, which sat-
isfy the following axioms: (i.) With respect to
+, R is an Abelian group. (ii.) · is associative:
a ·(b ·c) = (a ·b)·c for all a, b, c ∈R. (iii.) +
and · satisfy the distributive laws: a · (b + c) =
a · b + a · c and (b + c) · a = b · a + c · a for all
a, b, c ∈R. The operation + is called addition
and the operation · is called multiplication. If
multiplication is commutative, the ring is called
a commutative ring. If there is an identity for
multiplication, that is, an element 1 which has
x · 1 = 1 · x = x for all x ∈R, the ring is called
a ring with identity. The identity for the additive
Abelian group is denoted as 0. A division ring
is a ring whose nonzero elements form a group
under multiplication. A commutative division
ring is called a ﬁeld.

with a sheaf of rings OX on X. The main import
of this statement is that to each open set U of X,

X be an open subset of Cn, or, more generally, a
complex analytic manifold. For each open sub-
set U, let OX(U) = the ring of analytic (holo-

ring with identity, and S a multiplicative sub-
set of R, that is, 1 ∈S and S has the prop-
erty that ab ∈S whenever a, b ∈S.
De-
ﬁne an equivalence relation on the set R × S
by (r, s) ∼(r′, s′) ⇔s1(rs′ −r′s) = 0 for
some s1 ∈S. Note that in the case when S con-
tains no zero divisors and 0 /∈S, then (r, s) ∼
(r′, s′) ⇔rs′ −r′s = 0. The equivalence class
of (r, s) is usually denoted as r
s and the set of
all equivalence classes deﬁned in this way is de-
noted S−1R. Note that if 0 ∈S, then S−1R
consists only of the element 0

that S−1R is a commutative ring with identity,
where addition and multiplication are deﬁned by

S−1R is called the ring of fractions of R by S.
ring of polynomials
Let R be a ring and x
an indeterminate. The ring of polynomials over
R, denoted R[x], is the set of all polynomials in
the variable x, with coefﬁcients in R. This may
be formally deﬁned by considering the set of
all sequences (a0, a1, a2, . . . ) of elements of R
such that ai = 0 for all but a ﬁnite number of in-
dices i and deﬁning addition and multiplication
by: (a0, a1, . . . )+(b0, b1, . . . ) = (a0+b0, a1+
b1, . . . )and(a0, a1, . . . )(b0, b1, . . . ) = (c0, c1,
. . . ) where cn = n

erations, it is easy to see that R[x] is a ring. Usu-
ally, however, theelement(a0, . . . , an, 0, 0, . . . )

In the theory of dif-

ferential polynomials contains a ﬁnite subset B
such that, if u is any element of A, then there
exists an integer power of u that is a linear com-
bination of the elements of B and their deriva-
tives. This theorem on differential polynomials
is the analog of Hilbert’s Basis Theorem in the
ring of ordinary polynomials. See also Hilbert’s

states that for a complex number z in polar form
z = r[cos θ + i sin θ],
[r(cos θ + i sin θ)]n = rn(cos nθ + i sin nθ) .

Let E be a subﬁeld of a ﬁeld
K, and let p(x) be a polynomial with coefﬁ-
cients in E. If c is a root of p(x) (i.e., p(c) = 0),

Rosen’s gradient projection method
An al-
gorithm which seeks to minimize a convex dif-
ferentiable function p on a non-empty convex
set F. Starting with some u0 in F, if p(u0)
is not minimal, then p decreases in the direc-
tion of the gradient of −p. Because p is a con-
vex differentiable function, p(x) < p(u0) for
each point along the gradient of −p at u0. Map
u0 to the point u, where that gradient intersects
the boundary of F. Repeat with the gradient of
−p at u1, u2, etc. We have p(u0) > p(u1) >
p(u2) . . . If the process converges, p is mini-
mized at the limit of the sequence u0, u1, . . . .

Let C be a simple rec-

is increased by one. If the ﬁrst digit after the nth
place is less than ﬁve, the nth place is unaffected
by the rounding. For example, π rounded to the

where S is a splitting ﬁeld for G, and ϕ ∈
IrrS(G). If , is an irreducible S-representation
which affords ϕ and - is an irreducible F-
representation such that , is a constituent of

The convention in applied
mathematics wherein real numbers are repre-
sented as decimals (between one and ten) mul-
tiplied by powers of ten. For example, 36000 is
3.6×104 and 0.00031 is 3.1×10−4 in scientiﬁc
notation. The notation is particularly useful in
dealing with numbers that are very large or very
small in magnitude.
secant function
One of the fundamental
trigonometric functions, denoted sec x.
By
deﬁnition, sec x =

cos x , and hence the se-
cant function is (i.) periodic, satisfying sec(x +
2π) = sec x; (ii.) bounded below, satisfying
1 ≤| sec x|, for all real x, and (iii.) undeﬁned
where the cosine is 0 (x = ± π
2 , ± 3π

Many other properties of the secant function can
be derived from those of the cosine and sine. See
cosine function. See also secant of an angle.

proximate solutions of the equation f (x) = 0,

terminal ray of the angle α whose initial ray lies

angle is one of the angles in a right triangle with
adjacent side a, opposite side b, and hypotenuse

4 \ G is not compact, the irreducible decom-
position of T on 4 \ G contains not only the
discrete sum but also the direct integral (contin-
uous spectrum). Selberg showed that even in
this case, there are explicit examples in which

An example of a Siegel domain is the un-
bounded domain H consisting of all n × n sym-
metric matrices with complex entries, and with
positive deﬁnite imaginary parts. (A matrix M
is symmetric if Mt = M, where Mt is the trans-
pose of M. A matrix M with complex entries
can be written uniquely as M = A + iB, where
A and B have real entries. The matrix B is the
imaginary part of M. An n × n matrix B with
real entries is positive deﬁnite if xtBx ≥0 for
all n dimensional column vectors x with real
entries. Here, xt is just x, made into a row vec-
tor.) The Siegel domain H is called a general-
ized Siegel half plane. In the special case where
n = 1, the generalized Siegel half plane is just
the familiar upper half plane of elementary com-
plex analysis.
A Siegel domain is homogeneous if it is ho-
mogeneous as a domain, that is, if it has a tran-
sitive group of analytic (holomorphic) automor-
phisms. The generalized Siegel half planes are
homogeneous Siegel domains.
See homoge-
neous domain.
Siegel domains are divided into three classes,
Siegel domains of the ﬁrst kind, Siegel domains
of the second kind, and Siegel domains of the
third kind. There is a deep connection between
Siegel domains of the second kind and perfectly
general bounded homogeneous domains. (A do-
main is bounded if it is contained in a ball of
ﬁnite radius. A bounded homogeneous domain
is a domain which is both bounded and homoge-
neous. An open ball of ﬁnite radius in complex
N space is a bounded homogeneous domain. A
generalized Siegel half plane is a homogeneous
domain, but it is not bounded.) The connection
between Siegel domains and bounded homoge-
neous domains is provided by a famous theorem
of Vinberg, Gindikin, and Pyatetskii-Shapiro:
Every bounded homogeneous domain in CN is
isomorphic to a homogeneous Siegel domain of
the second kind.
See also bounded homoge-
neous domain, irreducible homogeneous Siegel
domain, Siegel domain of the ﬁrst kind, Siegel
domain of the second kind, Siegel domain of the
third kind.
Siegel domain of the ﬁrst kind
A domain
D(V ) = {x + iy ∈Rc|y ∈V }, where V is a
regular cone in an n-dimensional vector space
R and Rc is the complexiﬁcation of R.
Siegel domain of the second kind
A do-
main D(V, F) = {(x + iy, u) ∈Rc × W|y −
F(u, u) ∈V }, where V is a regular cone in an
n-dimensional vector space R, Rc is the com-
plexiﬁcation of R, W is a complex vector space,
and F : W × W →Rc is a V -Hermitian form.
If W = 0, then a Siegel domain of the ﬁrst kind
is obtained. See also Siegel domain of the ﬁrst
kind.
Siegel domain of the third kind
A do-
main which is holomorphically equivalent to
a bounded domain and can be written as
D(V, L, B) = {(x + iy, u, p) ∈Rc × W ×
X|y −Re Lp(u, u) ∈V, p ∈B}, where V is
a regular cone in an n-dimensional vector space
R, Rc is the complexiﬁcation of R, W and X are
complex vector spaces, B is a bounded domain
in X and L, Lp : W ×W →Rc are nondegener-
ate semi-Hermitian forms, for p ∈B. See also

sign pattern
The sign pattern of a real m×n
matrix A is the (0, 1, −1)–matrix obtained from
A when zero, positive, and negative entries are
replaced by 0, 1, −1, respectively. Thus, A de-
termines a (qualitative) class of matrices, Q(A),
consisting of all matrices with the same sign pat-
tern as A.
Sign patterns are one of the objects of study in
combinatorial matrix analysis, concerned with
the study of properties of matrices that are de-
termined from its combinatorial structure (such
as the directed graph) and other qualitative in-
formation. For example, A is called an L-matrix
provided that every matrix in Q(A) has linearly
independent rows. The sign pattern

A is a square L-matrix; that is, every matrix in
Q(A) is nonsingular.

triangle is one in which none of the three an-

A spher-

arc AB and the plane containing the arc AC,
and similarly for β and γ . If one (or more) of
the angles is a right angle, the triangle is called
a right spherical triangle. Note that in contrast
to a plane triangle, a spherical triangle may have
one, two, or three right angles. The solution of
a right spherical triangle consists of ﬁnding all

solvable by radicals if there exists an algorithm
for computing the roots of p(x) which consists
only of performing the ﬁeld operations on the
coefﬁcients of p, together with extracting roots

one to an extension ﬁeld of F, a more precise
formulation would say that there exists a radical
extension of F which contains a splitting ﬁeld

spectral sequence
A sequence M
=
{Mk, dk}, in which each Mk, k = 2, 3, 4, . . .
is a Z-bigraded module and each dk is a dif-
ferential of bidegree (−r, r −1) mapping Mk
p,q
to Mk
p−r,q+r−1. Furthermore, one requires that
H(Mk, dk) ∼= Mk+1, where H(Mk, dk) is the
homology of Mk with respect to the differen-
tial dk.
An equivalent deﬁnition is obtained
by considering an exact couple {D, E, α, β, γ }
of Z-bigraded modules D and E, where the
map α has degree (1, −1), β has degree (0, 0),
and γ has degree (−1, 0).
One then asso-
ciates to this exact couple a derived exact cou-
ple {D′, E′, α′, β′, γ ′} in such a way that the
differential object (E, d) (where d = β ◦γ )
naturally associated to {D, E, α, β, γ }, satisﬁes
H(E, d) = E′. Iterating the construction of
the derived exact couple then yields a spectral
sequence isomorphic to that deﬁned above.
spectral sequence functor
A map from the
category of exact couples to the category of
spectral sequences, which to an exact couple
{D, E, α, β, γ }, assigns a derived exact cou-
ple {D′, E′, α′, β′, γ ′} in such a way that the
differential object (E, d) (where d = β ◦γ )
naturally associated to {D, E, α, β, γ }, satisﬁes
H(E, d) = E′. (Here, H(E, d) is the homol-
ogy of E with respect to the differential d.) Iter-
ating the construction of the derived exact cou-
ple then yields a spectral sequence which is the
image of {D, E, α, β, γ }, under the spectral se-
quence functor.
spectral synthesis
If I is a closed ideal in the
L1-algebra of an Abelian group, then the prob-
lem of determining whether I is characterized

tions, particularly when the range of m and n is
extended to include arbitrary complex values,
are also known as associated Legendre func-
tions.

(i.) φ is bi-invariant under K, by which one
means that φ(g) = φ(kgk′), for every point g
in G and every pair of points k and k′ in K.

e is the identity element of G
(iii.) φ is an eigenfunction of every differ-
ential operator D which is invariant under the
action of G, and also invariant under right trans-
lations of K.
Note that the classical spherical functions de-
ﬁned in (1) result from taking G = SO(3), and
K = SO(2), while for G = Rn, and K = {0},
the spherical functions are complex exponen-
tials. See also spherical Fourier transform.

unit tangent vector to γ at p. Let γ ′ be the curve
on the unit sphere traced out by p′ as p varies
over γ . Then γ ′ is the spherical representation
of γ .

can be written as a product of an even number

tiautomorphism (on the Clifford algebra C(Q)),
deﬁned by β(v1, v2 . . . vn) = vnvn−1 . . . v1, for

sion ﬁeld of F, and f a polynomial of positive
degree and having all coefﬁcients in F. If F
contains all the roots of f , and E is generated
over F by the roots of f , then E is called a split-
ting ﬁeld of f over F. One says that f splits
into linear factors over E.

each of positive degree and having all coefﬁ-
cients in F. If F contains all the roots of each

(4) Suppose that F is a ﬁeld, and G a group.
If F is a splitting ﬁeld for the group ring F[G], in
the sense of (3) above, then F is called a splitting
ﬁeld for G.
(5) Suppose that A is a division algebra over
a ﬁeld F such that the center of A equals A, and
that E is an extension ﬁeld of F. If E effects
a complete decomposition of A into simple left
ideals so that A × F is isomorphic, for some
positive integer i, to the ring of i × i matrices
with elements in A, then E is called a splitting
ﬁeld of A over F. The number i is called the
index of A.
(6) Suppose that F is a ﬁeld, and denote by
G the multiplicative group of nonzero elements
in a universal domain that contains F.
If an

tive ring, A an R-algebra, and S a commutative
R-algebra. If there is some ﬁnitely generated
faithful projective R-module P such that the S-
algebra S ⊗A is isomorphic to the ring of en-
domorphisms of P over S, then S is called a
splitting ring of A.

a number which, when multiplied by itself, gives
a, denoted √a or a
1
2 . For example, a square root
of 4 is 2 since 2 × 2 is 4. Note that a number
may have more than one square root.
In the
present case, −2 is also a square root of 4 since
(−2) × (−2) is also equal to 4. However, no
number may have more than two distinct square
roots.

and x is an element of S, then the stabilizer of
x is the subgroup {g ∈G : gx = x} of G.

stable matrix
Most commonly, an n×n ma-
trix A with complex entries is called stable if
its eigenvalues lie in the open left half plane,
namely, if ℜλ < 0 for every eigenvalue λ of
A. Matrices whose eigenvalues lie in the open
right half plane are usually called positive sta-
ble. However, stability of a matrix appears in
the literature with respect to a variety of regions
of the complex plane. For example, a matrix
whose eigenvalues lie in the open unit circle is
sometimes referred to as Schur-stable.
stable reduction
(1) Suppose that E is an
elliptic curve deﬁned over a ﬁeld F, complete
with respect to a discrete valuation. Then E is
said to have stable reduction over F if the re-
duced curve for a minimal Weierstrass equation
is nonsingular.

closure RE of R in E, and C ×F E is said to
have stable reduction in RE.
Stable Reduction Theorem
If R is a discrete
valuation ring with quotient ﬁeld F, and A is
an Abelian variety over F, then A has potential
stable reduction at R. See stable reduction.
stable vector bundle

the property that for any proper subbundle E′ of
E, the inequality
rank(E) · degree(E′) < rank(E′) · degree(E)
holds.

Suppose that R is a com-
mutative ring, and that g is a Lie algebra over
R that is R-free. Denote by U the enveloping
algebra of g, and denote by 
R(g) the exterior
algebra of the R-module g. The U-free reso-
lution U ⊗
R(g) of R is called the standard
complex of g.

standard form of difference equation
If y
is a function from the integers to the real or com-
plex numbers, and 2 is the ﬁnite difference op-
erator deﬁned by
(2y)(x) = y(x + 1) −y(x) ,
a difference equation is an equation relating y,
and its ﬁnite differences, i.e., an equation of the
form F(x, y, 2y, . . . , 2ky) = 0. This stan-
dard form of this equation results by rewriting
it in such a way that the ﬁnite difference opera-
tor does not explicitly occur, i.e., by choosing ℓ
so that the equation becomes G(x, y(x), y(x +
1), . . . , y(x + ℓ)) = 0.
standard parabolic k-subgroup
Suppose
that k is a ﬁeld, and G is a connected reduc-
tive group deﬁned over k. Suppose that S is a
maximal k-split torus, denote by Z the central-
izer of S in G, and by P a minimal parabolic
k-subgroup of G. Denote by r the set of all k-
roots of G with respect to S, choose an ordering
of r, and suppose that θ is a subset of the funda-
mental system of r with respect to that ordering.
Suppose that α is a linear combination of the
roots of r, in which all roots not in θ occur with
a nonnegative coefﬁcient. Denote by ad the ad-
joint representation of g, and denote by Pα the
unipotent k-subgroup of G normalized by S so
that the Lie algebra of Pα is the set of all ele-
ments X in g such that ad(s)X = α(s) for all s
in S. Denote by Pθ the subgroup generated by Z
and Pα. Then Pθ is called a standard parabolic
k-subgroup of G that contains P.

complex 2) The set of all elements of 2 that
contain A.

B with involution ∗) The image of x under ∗
(denoted x∗).
state
(1) A positive linear functional of norm
1 on a C∗-algebra.
(2) The state of a system of N particles in
classical mechanics is described by the instan-
taneous position and velocity of each of the par-
ticles. If these particles are moving in three-
dimensional Euclidean space, the state is then
described by a point in R6N. Given Newton’s
laws, the knowledge of the state of a system at
any given time allows one to predict its state
at any time in the future or past. These states
of the system are sometimes referred to as the
dynamical or microscopic state of the system.
In thermodynamics, the state of a system is
often speciﬁed by a much smaller number of
quantities, such as its density, volume, and tem-
perature. In this case the number of quantities
chosen to specify the state of the system are
the minimum needed to predict its macroscopic
properties, and these states correspond to a sta-
tistical average over a very great number of mi-
croscopic states of the system.

Decompose the tensor product mapping ρ1 ⊗ρ2
relative to h into a direct sum of irreducible con-
stituent representations. For each weight µ of

tation of G that has µ as its highest weight, and
denote by m(µ) the multiplicity of ρµ in the de-
composition of ρ1 ⊗ρ2. Denote by h∗the linear
space of all complex-valued forms on h, and de-
note by (hC)∗
R the real linear subspace of h∗that
is spanned by the roots of g relative to h. De-

R may be expressed as a sum of
positive roots of g relative to h, and by I1 and
I2 the highest weights of the representations of
the differentials dρ1 and dρ2 of the complexiﬁ-
cation gC over V1 and V2, respectively. Denote
by s the sum of the positive roots of g relative
to h. For w and w′ in W, put

stereographic projection
A particular meth-
od of associating to each point on a sphere a
point in the plane. Let N be the north pole of
the sphere, and W the equatorial plane. Through
each point, p, of the sphere, draw the line pass-
ing through N. The stereographic projection of
p is the point q at which this line passes through
W. Note that this is a one-to-one (and hence in-
vertible) mapping of the sphere minus the north
pole onto the plane. This mapping is often used
in complex analysis since in addition to being
invertible, it is conformal. The plane W is some-
times chosen to be the plane tangent to the south
pole, rather than the equatorial plane.
Using the inverse of this mapping, the plane
can be thought of as embedded in the (Riemann)
sphere.

Then E is called a strongly normal extension

(1) Suppose that V is an
afﬁne variety. Denote by AU the ring of regular

from the assignment of AU to U for each open
set U is called the structure sheaf of V (or the

Sturm method of solving algebraic equations
Suppose that f is a real-valued polynomial of
degree d in one variable, and that f has no mul-
tiple zero. For real numbers a and b with a < b,
denote by N(a, b) the number of real roots of
the equation f = 0 in the interval (a, b). By
applying the division algorithm, one may con-
struct polynomials f0, f1, . . . , fd and q1, . . . ,
qd−1 such that f0 = f , fi−1 = fiqi + fi+1
for 1 ≤i ≤d −1, and fd is constant. Denote
by V (a) the number of changes in sign of the
terms of the ﬁnite sequence f0(a), . . . , fd(a),
and denote by V (b) the number of changes in
sign of the terms of the ﬁnite sequence f0(b),
. . . , fd(b); in each case we ignore zero terms.
Then N(a, b) = V (a)−V (b). Sturm’s method
uses this result to approximate the real roots of
the equation f = 0.

subdirect sum of rings
A subring T of a di-
rect sum of rings S for which each projection
map from T into the coordinate rings Si is sur-
jective. In more detail, let S1, S2, S3, . . . be a
ﬁnite or countable family of rings. The ring S,
consisting of all sequences s = (s1, s2, s3, . . . ),
where each si ∈Si and the operations are taken
coordinate-wise, is called the direct sum of the
rings Si. Let pi : S →Si be the function de-
ﬁned by pi(s) = si. pi is a ring homomorphism
from S onto Si called the ith projection map. A
ring T is a subdirect sum of the rings Si if two
things are true: (i.) T is a subring of S, and
(ii.) each projection map pi is surjective from T
to Si, that is, pi(T ) = Si. See also direct sum,

where e is the identity element in G.
(ii.) Nj+1 is a normal subgroup of Nj for j =
1 . . . n −1.
If H is a subgroup of G such that H = Ni,
for Ni an element of some normal series of G,
then H is called a subnormal subgroup of G.
Note that if H is a normal subgroup of G, we
can take the normal series N1 = G, N2 = H,
N3 = {e}, so every normal subgroup is also
subnormal.

a simply connected nilpotent Lie group, g is the
Lie algebra of G, and g∗is the dual space of
g. Suppose that h is a subalgebra of g and f is

of a group G, with representation space V , and
suppose the vector space V can be written as
the direct sum of two subspaces, S and T , each
left invariant by the representation. That is, let
ρ(g) be the image in GL(V ) of a point g ∈G
and suppose ρ(g)S ⊂S, and ρ(g)T ⊂T , for
all g ∈G. The maps ρS and ρT obtained by re-
strictingtherangeoftherepresentationtoGL(S)

successive substitutions
A method of solv-
ing systems of equations in the variables x1, . . . ,
xn in which the ﬁrst equation is solved for x1 as
a function of x2, . . . , xn. This result is then sub-
stituted into the remaining equations yielding a
system of equations in the variables x2, . . . , xn.
This process is then repeated until only a sin-
gle equation remains. For example, given the
system of equations
x1 + x2 + x2
3
=
0
2x1 −x2 + x3
=
0
x1 + 2x2 −x2
3
=
0
one can rewrite the ﬁrst equation as x1 = −x2
3 −
x2. Substituting this into the second and third
equations leads to
−3x2 + x3 −2x2
3
=
0
x2 −2x2
3
=
0
Solving the second of these equations for x2,
gives x2 = 2x2
3, which when substituted into
the ﬁrst equation gives
x3

1 −8x2
3

= 0
so that x3 = 0, or x3 = ±1/(2
√
2). One can
then obtain x1 and x2 for each of these possible
choices of x3, by substituting the chosen value
of x3 into the previous equations. Note that this
method may fail to yield a solution if it is im-
possible to solve for any of the variables at some
stage in the procedure, or if the ﬁnal equation
one obtains has no solution.

sum, and a superscript indicating the ﬁnal value
of j to be included. For example, the symbol

is the unique real number B = sup S deﬁned by
the following two conditions: (i.) x ≤B, for all
x ∈S; (ii.) if x ≤C, for all x ∈S, then B ≤C.

synthetic division
A compact notation for
representing the division of a polynomial p(x)
by a linear factor of the form x−a. For instance,

the left, the constant term in the linear factor:
−1
|
3
−2
−1
The coefﬁcient of the ﬁrst term in the quotient
will always be the same as the coefﬁcient of
the leading term in the original polynomial (3
in this example), so that is not written. Since
3x(x −1) = 3x2 −3x, we must subtract −3x
from the −2x in the original polynomial. This
is represented by changing the sign of −3, and
writing it under the −2 in the ﬁrst line, and
adding:
−1

(2) Suppose that D is a division ring, and con-
sider a system S of linear homogeneous equa-

system of fundamental units
A minimal set
of units in terms of which the units of all other
physical quantities can be deﬁned. For exam-
ple, in classical mechanics, if we choose the
meter as the unit of length, the kilogram as the
unit of mass, and the second as the unit of time
(the mks-system), then the units of other quan-
tities such as velocity (meters/second) or force
(kilogram-meters/second2) can be expressed in
terms of these three. Note that what constitutes a
system of fundamental units may depend on the
physical phenomena under consideration. For

linear equations in n variables x1, x2, . . . , xn, is
a set of equations of the form
n

k=1
ajkxk = cj;
j = 1, 2, . . . , m ,
where ajk and cj are constants. For example, if
n and m are both 2, one could have
x1 + 2x2
=
1
3x1 −x2
=
1 .
The important point is that in order for the sys-
tem to be linear, none of the variables xj may
appear with a power higher than 1, nor can there
be any products of xi with xj.
The above system can be written as a single
matrix equation
AX = C ,

(ii.) undeﬁned at multiples of π, satisfying
lim

Let P be a point on a curve C
parameterized by x = f (t). The tangent line
to C at P is the line passing through P with
direction vector df (x). Thus, if C is the graph
of a function of one variable, y = f (x), then
the tangent line to C at (x, y) is the line passing
through (x, y) with slope f ′(x).

coordinate of the point where the tangent line
to the unit circle at (1, 1) intersects the inﬁnite
line, along which lies the terminal ray of the an-
gle α, whose initial ray lies along the positive
x-axis. If 0 < α < π

ﬁned by the vector equation x = x(s, t). The

vectors xs(s0, t0) and xt(s0, t0).

subgroup of Ur( ¯V ) generated by the algebraic
cycles rational over K. Tate conjectured that the

morphic to the nth cohomology group of G with

The study of polynomial

xn + a1xn−1 + · · · + an−1x + an = 0 .
Some of the questions studied in the theory of

of solutions, and the possibility of solutions by
radicals.
theory of moduli
Given a class of objects,
such as “projective surfaces of general type” or
“rank two vector bundles on a given Riemann
surface,” one may classify them (up to isomor-
phism, say, or some other similar equivalence
relation) in two steps:
First, identify numerical invariants (invari-
ants under the chosen equivalence). Then, for
the objects having a ﬁxed set of numerical in-
variants, describe an algebraic variety (or an an-
alytic variety) which parametrizes these. The
parametrization should satisfy certain natural-
ity conditions; most often, the parameter space
(called moduli space, since the parameters are
c
⃝ 2001 by CRC Press LLC

called moduli) must represent some Hom func-
tor.
A well-known example is the moduli space
of Riemann surfaces (smooth algebraic curves)
of genus g: this is a point, for g = 0; a one-
dimensional variety, for g = 1; and a 3g −3-
dimensional variety, if g ≥2. Here g is the
numerical invariant, which must be chosen ﬁrst.
Of course, in each given context, a moduli
space may or may not exist (or may exist only af-
ter changing the class of objects slightly); when
the moduli space does exist, we say that the class
of objects has a theory of moduli.

A method used
to introduce new artiﬁcial variables so that there

where a ≤t ≤b, a ≤0, b ≥0, passing through
ω0. As v ranges through V (space of parame-
ters), the variations range through a family of

The modern, and more general, deﬁnition of
algebraic varieties is as follows: Consider a pair
(V, O) of a topological space V and its structure
sheaf O of mappings V −→k, where k is an
algebraically closed ﬁeld. This pair is called
a prealgebraic variety over k, and is denoted
simply by V , if V has a ﬁnite open covering (Vi)
and there exists a homomorphism Vi −→Ui
from Vi to an afﬁne variety Ui that transforms
O|Vi to the structure sheaf of Ui. A prealgebraic
variety V is then called an algebraic variety if
the image of the diagonal mapping V −→V ×
V is closed in the Zariski topology of the product
variety V × V .
An algebraic variety V is called an algebraic
group if it has a group structure and the mapping
V × V −→V, (a, b) →ab−1 is a morphism.
In the case V is irreducible, then V is called
a group variety. A complete group variety is
called an Abelian variety.

volume
A numerical characteristic of the ex-
tent of a body in three-dimensional space. In the
simplest case,
the body is a rectangular
parallelepiped with sides of length a, b, c and
volume abc. The volume (of bodies in three-
dimensional space) has the following four prop-
erties: (i.) volume is non-negative; (ii.) volume
is additive, that is, if two bodies U and V , with
no points in common, have volumes v(U) and
v(V ), then the volume of their union is the sum
of their volumes, v(U ∪V ) = v(U) + v(V );
(iii.) volume is invariant under translation, that
is if two bodies U and V have volumes v(U) and
v(V ), and the two bodies are congruent, then
v(U) = v(V ); (iv.) volume of the unit cube is 1.
The concept of volume is extended, while
preservingproperties(i.) through(iv.), toawider
class of bodies by a process called the method of
exhaustion. Let G be a body whose surface sat-
isﬁes certain conditions. Find a set K ⊂G that
can be expressed as a disjoint union of ﬁnitely
many parallelepipeds (and whose volume can
be calculated by additivity, property (ii.)). Also
ﬁnd a set O ⊃G that can be expressed as a ﬁ-
nite disjoint union of parallelepipeds. If G is to
have a volume, we must have
v(K) ≤v(G) ≤v(O) .
If

this common value is called the volume of G,
v(G).
The concept of volume of a body in three-
dimensional space can be extended to sets in n-
dimensional space while preserving properties
(i.)
through (iv.).
This is done by replacing
rectangular parallelepipeds with cells.
An n-
dimensional cell is a set of the form
I =

Waring’s Second Theorem

Waring’s Theorem
Let K be a ﬁeld of char-
acteristic p consisting of q elements. Let f1,
. . . , fm be polynomials in n variables with coef-
ﬁcients in K of degrees d1, . . . , dm, respectively,
and suppose that d = d1 + · · · + dm < n. If N
is the number of common zeros of f1, . . . , fm,
then N ≡0 (mod p). See also Waring’s Sec-
ond Theorem.
weak (inductive) dimension
The empty set
∅is declared to have dimension −1. Inductively,
we proceed as follows: If R is a set and if, for
every neighborhood U(p) of each point p ∈
R, there exists an open neighborhood V such
that p ∈V ⊂U(p) and the dimension of the
boundary of V is n −1, then we say that R has
weak inductive dimension ≤n.
If it is the case that the dimension of R is less
than or equal to n and it is not the case that the
dimension of R is less than or equal to n −1,
then the dimension of R is n.

logical space V is said to converge weakly to an
element x in V if, for every continuous linear
functional f on V , limn→∞f (xn) = f (x).

pact Hausdorff space X, M(A) is the maximal
ideal space of A, ϕ ∈M(A), Mϕ is the set of
representing measures for ϕ and m ∈Mϕ.
weaker equivalence
An equivalence relation
R is said to be weaker than an equivalence re-
lation S if equivalence in the sense of S implies
equivalence in the sense of R.
weak global dimension
If M is a left R-
module over some ring R, then M is isomorphic
to the quotient of a free R-module F by some
submodule S. So M is isomorphic to F/S. S
is called the ﬁrst syzygy of M. Taking the ﬁrst
syzygy of S one gets the second syzygy of M,
etc. The ﬂat dimension of M is the least number
of times the procedure has to be repeated to get
a ﬂat module, i.e., it is the smallest n such that
the nth syzygy is ﬂat. If there is a bound on
such n, as M varies, then the least upper bound
of all such n is called the weak global dimension
of R. More precisely, it is the left weak global
dimension. But, in fact, the number is the same,
whether left or right modules are used.
Weak Lefschetz Theorem
Let X be an al-
gebraic subvariety of complex dimension n in
the complex projective space CPN, let P ⊂
CPN be a hyperplane passing through all sin-
gular points of X (if any) and let Y = X ∩P
be a hyperplane section of X. Then the relative
homology groups Hi(X, Y; Z) vanish for i < n.
This implies that the natural homomorphism
Hi(Y; Z) −→Hi(X; Z)
is an isomorphism for i < n −2 and surjective
for i = n −1.

plane is given by an ordered pair (a, b), which
means that the point P can be reached from the
origin by moving a units along the x-axis (the
ﬁrst axis) and then b units parallel to the second
axis, which is called the y-axis.
(2) In three-dimensional space, the coordi-
nate axes are the three lines of intersection of
three planes which intersect in a single point
O called the origin and denoted by the triple
(0, 0, 0). By labeling the axes as the ﬁrst, sec-
ond, and third we introduce an orientation to the
three-dimensional space. The location of any

the Zariski topology. See Zariski topology.
Zariski dense

Zariski ring
A Noetherian ring R, equipped
with the I-adic topology, satisfying the follow-
ing condition: every element b ∈R such that
1−b ∈I has an inverse in R if and only if every
ideal of R is a closed subset of R in the I-adic
topology. (The I-adic topology determined by
an ideal I of R is deﬁned by taking {I n}n∈N as a
fundamental system of neighborhoods of zero.)
Zariski’s Connectedness Theorem
(1) If
f : X −→Y is a proper surjective morphism
of irreducible varieties, the ﬁeld K(Y) of ratio-
nal functions separably algebraically closed in
K(X) and y ∈Y a normal point, then f −1(y)
is connected.
(2) For a proper morphism f : X −→Y
of locally Noetherian schemes with f∗(OX) =
OY , every ﬁber f −1(y) of f is connected and
nonempty for y ∈Y.
Zariski’s Main Theorem
(1) If f : X −→
Y is a birational transformation of projective va-
rieties, where X is normal, then for any funda-
mental point p of f , the total transform f (p) is
connected and of dimension ≥1.
(2) A birational morphism f : X −→Y of
algebraic varieties is an open imbedding into a
neighborhood of a normal point y ∈Y if f −1(y)
is a ﬁnite set.
Zariski topology
(1) A topology deﬁned on
An, the afﬁne space of all n-tuples of elements
of a ﬁeld F. This topology is deﬁned by taking
the closed sets to be the algebraic subsets of An.
(2) A topology deﬁned on the afﬁne scheme
Spec(A) of a ring A by taking the closed sets to
be the sets {p ∈Spec(A) : I ⊂p}, where I is
an ideal of A.
Zassenhaus group
A subgroup H of SA, the
groupofpermutationsofaﬁnitesetA, satisfying
the following three conditions:
(i.) H is 2-transitive, that is, for every a, b, c,
d ∈A there exists σ ∈H such that σ(a) = b
and σ(c) = d,
(ii.) the only element of H that leaves more than
two elements of A ﬁxed is the identity, and
(iii.) for any pair a, b ∈A, the subgroup {h ∈
H : h(a) = a, h(b) = b} is nontrivial.
z-axis
The third (and last) of the coordinate
axes used to locate points in three-dimensional
space. See x-axis.
Z-basis
Let Z be the ring of integers. Let S
be a ring containing Z. A left S module V has
a Z basis if V is freely generated as a Z module
(Abelian group) by a family of generators vα,
a ∈A. This means (i.) each vα ∈V ; (ii.) if
a ﬁnite sum n1vα1 + · · · + nkvαk = 0, where
n1, . . . , nk ∈Z, then ni = 0 for i = 1, . . . , k;
(iii.) the set of all ﬁnite sums n1vα1+· · ·+nkvαk,
where n1, . . . , nk ∈Z, is equal to V . The family
vα, α ∈A, is called a Z-basis for V .
This generalizes to the case where Z is re-
placed by an arbitrary subring R of S, in which
case the family vα, α ∈A, is called an R-basis
for V . See also R-basis.
Z-equivalence
(1) Let Z be the ring of in-
tegers, let S be an arbitrary ring, and let V and
W be S submodules with ﬁnite Z bases, BV and
BW. The modules V and W are Z-equivalent if
there is an S module isomorphism between V
and W which, relative to the bases BV and BW,
has a matrix U with integer entries, and such that
the inverse matrix U−1 also has integer entries.
It is a theorem that Z-equivalence is indepen-
dent of the particular choice of the bases BV
and BW. Furthermore, Z-equivalence is related
to the classical notion of integral equivalence
for matrices. See also integral equivalence, iso-
morphism, Z-basis.
The two most important applications of Z-
equivalence arise in (i.) the Jordan-Zassenhaus

Theorem, and (ii.) the theory of integral rep-
resentations of groups. See integral representa-
tion, Jordan-Zassenhaus theorem.
The notion of Z-equivalence generalizes to
the case where Z is replaced by an arbitrary sub-
ring R of S, in which case the notion is called
R-equivalence. See also R-equivalence.
(2) Two integral representations T1 and T2
of a ﬁnite group G are Z-equivalent if there is
an invertible matrix U, with integer entries, and
such that the inverse matrix U−1 also has inte-
ger entries, which intertwines T1 and T2. This
means that T2(g) = U−1T1(g)U for all g ∈G.
See also integral representation.
zero algebra
An algebra having only one
element, 0 (zero), which then is also the unit of
the algebra.
zero divisor
If a and b are two nonzero el-
ements of a ring R such the a · b = 0, then a
and b are divisors of zero or zero divisors. More
speciﬁcally, a is a left divisor of zero and b is
a right divisor of zero. In a commutative ring,
every left divisor of zero is also a right divisor
of zero and conversely.
zero element
The identity element of a group
wherethegroupoperationisdenotedby+(addi-
tion). Depending on what additional structures
the group has, the element may be called the
zero element of a ﬁeld, of a linear space, of a
ring.
zero exponent
The integer 0, as a power
to raise elements of a multiplicative group. A
consequence of one of the laws of exponents is
am/an = am−n. Thus, when the base a is differ-
ent from zero and the two exponents are equal,
n = m the equation becomes 1 = am/an =
am−n = a0.
zero homomorphism
A homomorphism φ :
G −→G′ that maps every element of G to the
identity in G. A zero homomorphism is also
called the trivial homomorphism.
zero matrix
A matrix in which every entry
is zero.
zero of a function
A value of the argument
for which the function is zero. (A value of x
such that f (x) = 0.)
zero point
(1) If f is a nonzero holomorphic
function and f (a) = 0, then a is a zero point
of f . (See zero of a function.) If a is a zero
point of f , then there exists a unique natural
number n and a holomorphic function fn such
that f (z) = (z−a)nfn(z), where fn(a) ̸= 0. In
that case, n is called the order of the zero point
a and a is a zero point of order n.
(2) If P is a polynomial in n variables over
a ring R and P(α1, α2, . . . , αn) = 0 ∈R, then
(α1, α2, . . . , αn) is a zero point of P. (See zero
of a function.) If n =1, the zero points are called
roots.
(3)ConsiderapolynomialringK[x1, . . . , xn]
in n variables over a ﬁeld K and a ﬁeld ) con-
taining K. A point (α1, α2, . . . , αn) in )n =
{(ω1, ω2, . . . , ωn) : ωi ∈)} is a zero point of a
subset S of K[x1, . . . , xn] if f (α1, α2, . . . , αn)
= 0 for all f ∈S.
zero representation
If K is a commutative
ring with a unit and A an associative algebra over
K, an algebra homomorphism A −→EK(M),
where EK(M) is the associative algebra over
K of all K-endomorphism of a K-module M, is
called the zero representation of A if the module
M = {0}.
zero ring
A ring having only one element,
the zero element (the identity with respect to
addition).
zeta function
(1) The series
ζ(s) = 1 + 1
2s + 1
3s + 1
4s + · · ·
which converges for all real numbers s > 1 is
known as the Riemann ζ-function. B. Riemann
was the ﬁrst to treat ζ(s) as a function of a com-
plex variable and showed that ζ(s) is holomor-
phic and has no zeros in ℜs > 1. Furthermore,
Riemann proved that ζ(s) can be extended to
a meromorphic function in the whole complex
plane whose only pole is a simple pole a s = 1.
See also Riemann hypothesis.

functions that (i.) are meromorphic on the whole

pansion, (iii.)
have Euler product expansion,
and(iv.)satisfycertainfunctionalequations. See
also L-function.
zeta function deﬁned by Hecke operators
Let Tn (n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ) be a Hecke operator
deﬁned with respect to a discontinuous group
0. Let M be the representation space of the
Hecke operator ring K and denote by (Tn) the
matrix of the operation of Tn ∈K on M. The
matrix-valued function 
n(Tn)n−s is called the
ζ-function deﬁned by Hecke operators.
ZG-lattice
Let G be a ﬁnite group. A ﬁnitely
generated ZG-module which is Z-torsion free is
called a ZG-lattice.
zonal spherical function
(1) A spheri-
cal function of degree n (a harmonic polyno-
mial in three variables of degree n restricted
to the unit sphere S2 of Euclidean space E3),
Z(n)
u (x1, x2, x3) (u ∈S2), which has a constant
value on any circle in S2 whose plane is perpen-
dicular to the vector u.
(2) Let G be a locally compact unimodu-
lar group and K a compact subgroup of G.
Denote by C(G; K) the set of all continu-
ous complex-valued functions f on G that are
invariant under every left translation by ele-
ments in K, by C(G, K) the set of elements
in C(G; K) that are two-sided K-invariant, and
by L the subset of C(G, K) consisting of all
functions with compact support. Then L is an
algebra over C if the product of two elements is
deﬁned by convolution. If λ is an algebra homo-
morphism from L into C, and the eigenspace
{g ∈C : f ∗g = λ(f )g for all f ∈L} contains
a nonzero element, then it contains a two-sided
K-invariant element ω normalized by w(e) = 1.
This element ω is unique and is called the zonal
spherical function associated with λ.
Z-order
Let Z be the ring of integers. Let A
be a ﬁnite dimensional algebra with unit element
e over a ﬁeld F. A subring G of A is called
a Z-order in A if it satisﬁes (i.) e ∈G, (ii.)
G contains a basis of A as a vector space over
the ﬁeld F (an F-basis of A), and (iii.) G is a
ﬁnitely generated Z module (a ﬁnitely generated
Abelian group).
This generalizes to the case where Z is re-
placed by an arbitrary ring R, in which case G
is called an R-order. See also R-basis, R-order.
