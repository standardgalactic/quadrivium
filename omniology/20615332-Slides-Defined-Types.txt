Deﬁned Types
●
A deﬁned type also called a named type is a new type created by the programmer from 
another existing type which is called the underlying or source type.
●
A new deﬁned type must have a new name and can have its new methods.
●
The underlying type provides the representation, operations and size of the newly deﬁned 
type.
●
Even though the deﬁned type and the source type share the same representation, 
operations and size they are different types.  A new type it’s not just an alias for an 
existing type, it’s a completely new type.
●
If we want to perform operations between source and deﬁned types we must convert one 
type into the other type. A type can be converted to another type if they share the same 
underlying type.
●
There is no type-hierarchy in Go.

Why deﬁne new types?
●
We can attach methods to  newly deﬁned types.
●
Type safety. We must convert one type into another to perform operations with them.
●
Readability. When we deﬁned a new type let’s say type usd ﬂoat64 we know that new type 
represents the US Dollar, not only ﬂoats.
