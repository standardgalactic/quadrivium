Series Editors’ Preface
The emerging ﬁeld of autonomous and ultra-low power sensor systems as an
important domain in the Internet of Things and as providers of Big Data has
triggered a new wave of research for energy harvesters and in particular of
such harvesters based on thermoelectric principles. Competing with continu-
ously improving batteries, which may allow the operation of ultra-low power
sensor systems for several years, thermoelectric energy conversion systems
are optimized with respect to material eﬃciency for applications around room
temperature and thermal matching by enhanced system design of the thermal
interfaces, maintaining high temperature diﬀerences at suﬃcient thermal heat
ﬂux. The latter aspect is in particular also important for thermoelectric systems
for waste heat recovery, which operate at higher temperature diﬀerences, but
still at (very) low Carnot eﬃciencies. Return of investment depends signiﬁcantly
on optimized system design, low cost, large area fabrication technologies, and
low material costs.
We present the 14th volume of Advanced Micro & Nanosystems (AMN), enti-
tled Thermoelectric Energy Conversion.
Professor Dr Alireza Rezania, Aalborg University, and Dr Diana Dávila Pineda,

Introduction
In recent years, demands for energy eﬃciency have motivated many researchers
worldwide to seek innovative methods capable of enhancing the eﬃciency of the
thermoelectric energy conversion of heat to electricity. Since the dimensionless
thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit ZT (=𝛼2𝜎T/𝜅, where 𝛼is the Seebeck coeﬃcient,
𝜎is the electrical conductivity, 𝜅is the thermal conductivity, and T is the absolute
temperature) can be regarded to be proportional to the thermoelectric eﬃciency
for a given temperature diﬀerence, materials improvements in this direction
include either electronic optimization methods for maximizing the 𝛼2𝜎product
or phonons scattering methods for minimizing the thermal conductivity (the
denominator of ZT). These methods and approaches mainly involve interfaces
and submicron generation methods, which are much more eﬀective in phonon
scattering (rather than electron scattering), and consequently reducing the
lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity, 𝜅L, without adversely aﬀecting
the other involved electronic properties. The main challenge while dealing with
submicron features and interfaces for phonon scattering lies in the ability to
retain these features under the thermal conditions involved and the suppression
of undesirable coarsening eﬀects over time. One plausible method for overcom-
ing this challenge is based on using thermodynamically driven phase separation
(i.e., spinodal decomposition or nucleation and growth) reactions, resulting in
submicron and multiinterface features, owing to the separation of the matrix
into two distinct phases, upon controlled heat treatments. The resultant features
from these reactions are considered as more thermodynamically stable than
other conventional nanostructuring methods, based on rapid consolidation
of nanopowders obtained by energetic ball milling or melt spinning, which
are susceptible to grain growth upon prolonged high temperature operation
conditions. The key in choosing appropriate thermoelectric compositions,
which follow phase separation reactions, is the requirement for a miscibility gap
between the involved phases. This condition is strongly dependent on the nature

of the chemical pair interaction between the involved substitution elements.
They can either distribute randomly in the host materials or separate the system
into diﬀerent phase components. An attractive chemical interaction can lead
to an inhomogeneous distribution of the substitution atoms, leading to phase
separation. Otherwise, the atoms will be substituted in the host system with
a high solubility, forming a single solid solution phase. For achieving phase
separation, compositions with attractive chemical interactions are required.

IV–VI Alloys for Waste Heat Thermoelectric
Applications
The binary IV–VI compounds, based on columns IV (Ge, Pb, and Sn) and VI
(Te, Se, and S) of the periodic table, are narrow-band (∼0.2–0.3 eV) mixed
ionic–covalent compounds, which are known for several decades as the most
eﬃcient thermoelectric materials for intermediate temperature ranges of up to
500 ∘C. The possibility for operation under the temperature range of 100–500 ∘C
is signiﬁcant from a practical point of view for converting waste heat generated
in automotive diesel engines, in which a maximal temperature of 500 ∘C is devel-
oped, into useful electricity, and thus reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emis-
sion. In the automotive industry, the minimal cold side temperature of ∼100 ∘C
is mainly limited by the maximum available water ﬂow rate through the radiator.
Lead chalcogenides (PbTe, PbSe, and PbS) crystallize in a NaCl cubic lattice,
similarly to what happens in the high temperature phases of SnTe and GeTe. The
latter follow a second-order lattice distortion to rhombohedral or orthorhombic
structures upon decreasing the temperature, the signiﬁcance of which on
practical thermoelectric applications will be reviewed in detail in the follow-
ing paragraphs. Another characteristic of the IV–VI compounds is the large
deviation of stoichiometry, which in the case of PbTe is extended toward both
Pb- and Te-rich compositions, enabling control of the electronic conduction
toward n- and p-type conduction, respectively. In the case of GeTe, the deviation
of stoichiometry is toward Te-rich compositions only, resulting in high carrier
concentration (1020–1021/cm3) p-type conduction, which is beyond the optimal
required for thermoelectric applications (∼1019/cm3). To reduce the holes con-
centration in order to obtain optimal thermoelectric properties, it is necessary
to dope GeTe with donor-type electroactive impurities. Bi2Te3 acts as a donor
when it is dissolved in GeTe. In the case of PbTe, the most common dopants
are PbI2 and Bi for obtaining optimal thermoelectric n-type compositions and
Na for the p-type. Yet, for many years, owing to opposite inﬂuences of the
carrier concentration on the various properties involved in the thermoelectric
ﬁgure of merit, ZT, all the attempts to maximize the ZT value of the binary
IV–VI compounds beyond ∼1 just by electronically doping optimization did
not succeed. In the recent years, combined methods of electronic optimization
and nanostructuring for reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity in IV–VI
based alloys resulted in much higher ZT values of up to ∼2.2, as can be seen in
Figure 1.1a,b for various p- and n-type compositions, respectively [1–13].

PbI2 [13]. (Pei et al. 2012 [8]. Reproduced with permission of Nature Publishing Group.)
It can be seen in the ﬁgure that early attempts to optimize the p-type Na-doped
PbTe (Pb0.99Na0.01Te [2]) and the n-type PbI2-doped PbTe with various carrier
concentrations of 6.54 × 1018, 2.19 × 1019, 4.22 × 1019, and 6.09 × 1019/cm3 [11]
resulted in relatively low maximal ZTs of 0.8 and 1.1, respectively. An eﬀect of
reduction of the carrier concentration on reduction of the maximal temperature
at which maximal ZT is obtained because of electronic doping optimization
can be easily seen for the PbI2-doped PbTe [11] compositions in the ﬁgure.
This ﬁnding had initiated the functionally graded materials (FGM) concept, in
which thermoelectric legs composed of a singular matrix compound (e.g., PbTe)
doped by a gradual dopant concentration, each optimal in its correspondent
temperature along the leg, yield higher average ZT values than any singular
doping concentration over the wide temperature gradients, usually apparent
in practical operations. Yet, even this approach did not yield average ZTs
higher than 1 for common operation conditions of 100–500 ∘C, and novel
approaches for ZT enhancement had to be considered. One of such approaches,
inspired by Kaidanov and Ravich [14], was based on advanced electronic doping
based on generation of localized “deep” resonant states lying inside the energy
gap, which are capable of pinning the Fermi energy of the compounds at a

favorable level, required for electronic thermoelectric optimization. Related
to IV–VI based compounds, it was found that Group III dopants (Al, Ga, In,
Tl) can be utilized for generation of such states. Application of this approach
for thermoelectric optimization of n-type In-doped PbTe [11] resulted in
higher average ZT for the temperature range of 100–500 than any of the
PbI2-doped materials, but without any success in increasing the average ZT
beyond 1. On the other hand, a dramatic increase of the maximal ZT to a
level of ∼1.5 was recently demonstrated upon Tl doping of PbTe for the p-type
Pb0.98Tl0.02Te [1] composition (Figure 1.1a). A second approach that was taken
in the recent years for enhancement of the ZT values of IV–VI based alloys
is based on nanostructuring for reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity.
Several examples of nanostructured materials with maximal ZTs higher than
1 and in some cases even higher than 2 are illustrated in Figure 1.1a,b. These
include the p-type Agx(Pb,Sn)mSbyTe2+m (LASTT) [6], NaPbmSbTe2+m (SALT)
[7], Gex(SnyPb1−y)1−xTe [3, 4], and the n-type AgPbmSbTe2+m (LAST) [10],
KPbmSbTem+2 (PLAT) [12], and (Pb0.95Sn0.05Te)x(PbS)1−x [13] families of mate-
rials; all exhibit nanostructures and very low lattice thermal conductivities.
Diﬀerent mechanisms for nanostructuring are involved in the above-listed
examples. Yet, two of the most eﬃcient materials listed in Figure 1.1a,b are
the p-type Ge0.87Pb0.13Te [3] and the n-type (Pb0.95Sn0.05Te)0.92(PbS)0.08 [13]
compositions, both following thermodynamically driven phase separation
reactions of the matrix into two distinct submicron phases. Since such reactions
and the correspondent nanophases are considered as much more thermody-
namically stable than many of the other methods listed above, as required for
long-term thermoelectric applications, a detailed description of this eﬀect and
the conditions for achieving it will be given in the next paragraph.
It is noteworthy that the above-listed methods and compositions resulting
in maximal ZTs higher than 1, as shown in Figure 1.1a,b, did not necessarily
result in higher average ZTs than 1 over the entire operation temperature range
(100–500 ∘C) required for automotive waste heat recovery. For such applications
the maximal possible thermoelectric eﬃciency, deﬁned as the ratio between the
obtained electrical power on the load resistance and the absorbed heat, can be
calculated using Eq. (1.1).

where 𝜂is the thermoelectric eﬃciency, ZT is the average dimensionless ther-
moelectric ﬁgure of merit, TC is the cold side temperature of the thermoelectric

the temperature diﬀerence along the thermoelectric sample (ΔT = TH – TC).
The maximal thermoelectric eﬃciency values for the samples shown in
Figure 1.1a,b, calculated using Eq. (1.1) and the average ZTs for each compo-
sition, are illustrated in Figure 1.1c,d for a constant cold side temperature of
100 ∘C and varied hot side temperatures in the range of 300–500 ∘C. From these
ﬁgures it can be easily seen that some of the recently published compositions

showing maximal ZTs higher than 1 and in some cases even higher than 1.6,
do not necessarily show higher eﬃciency values than those calculated using Eq.
(1.1) for an average ZT of 1 (dashed line in the ﬁgure). On the other hand, some
of the compositions show very high eﬃciency values of up to 14–15% (the p-type
Ge0.87Pb0.13Te [3] and the n-type AgPb18SbTe20 – LAST [10] compositions) for
the temperature range of 100–500 ∘C.
Besides high average ZTs, other important factors required for practical
applications include high mechanical properties and improved structural and
chemical stability at the operating temperatures. Mechanical properties are
important in determining the performance of thermoelectric materials since
they are subject in the course of their operation to various mechanical and
thermal stresses. In this context, it was recently shown that the less thermo-
electrically eﬃcient p-Pb1−xSnxTe compound, compared to Na-doped PbTe, is
more favorable for practical thermoelectric applications because of the highly
mechanical brittle nature of the latter [2]. Regarding chemical and structural
stability, PbTe-based compounds were associated for many years with improved
structural and chemical stability at the operating temperatures than GeTe-based
compounds. The improved chemical stability is due to a lower vapor pressure,
namely, lower sublimation rates of PbTe, as can be seen in Figure 1.2.
In telluride-based thermoelectric materials (e.g., PbTe and GeTe), the main
degradation mechanism during normal operation conditions (100–500 ∘C) is
sublimation of GeTe, PbTe, or SnTe in a molecular form (Figure 1.2). For PbTe, the
maximal allowed hot side temperature for long operation conditions is 500 ∘C,
corresponding to a maximal vapor pressure of ∼6 × 10−8 atm (Figure 1.2). It can
be seen from the ﬁgure that this vapor pressure corresponds to a temperature of
∼410 ∘C for the case of GeTe, which can be considered as the maximal allowed
operation temperature for this class of materials. Beyond this temperature,
high sublimation and corresponding degradation rates can be expected. An
improved structural stability of PbTe compared to GeTe was considered for
many years mainly because of the single-phase cubic NaCl structure of PbTe
over the whole operating temperature range, in contrast to the rhombohedral
to cubic NaCl phase transition at 427 ∘C in GeTe. Recently, the highly eﬃcient

1 Utilizing Phase Separation Reactions for Enhancement of the Thermoelectric Eﬃciency
p-type GexPb1−xTe alloys, including the Ge0.87Pb0.13Te composition shown in
Figure 1.1a, were shown to follow a second-order phase transition from the
high-temperature cubic phase to the low-temperature rhomoboheral phase with
a decreased phase transition temperature, Tc, by moving from GeTe toward
PbTe richer compositions [20]. Second-order phase transitions occur when a
new state of reduced symmetry develops continuously from the disordered (high
temperature) phase and are characterized by the absence of discontinuities of
the thermodynamic state functions (entropy, enthalpy, volume). The character of
the phase transition (ﬁrst- or second-order) is important to determine whether
a certain material is suitable for serving in thermoelectric applications in which
large temperature gradients are usually involved. In such instances, a singular
intermediate temperature Tc at which one crystal structure is transformed into
another with the corresponding sharp variation of the lattice parameters (as in
ﬁrst-order transitions) can result in mechanical weakness. A continuous varia-
tion of the lattice parameters from one phase to the other (as in second-order
transitions) is more favorable from the mechanical stability standpoint. There-
fore, GexPb1−xTe alloys exhibit a very high potential, both from mechanical
stability and thermoelectric performance considerations, for being involved as
p-type legs in practical thermoelectric applications. Since the very high maximal
ZTs of the p-type Ge0.87Pb0.13Te and the n-type (Pb0.95Sn0.05Te)0.92(PbS)0.08
compositions in Figure 1.1a,b are mainly attributed to very low lattice thermal
conductivity values resulting from nano- and submicron features originating
from phase separation reactions, a detailed description of these reactions and
their potential in enhancement of the thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit is given in
the next paragraph.
1.3
Thermodynamically Driven Phase Separation
Reactions
As mentioned earlier, retaining a submicron structure during a practical
thermoelectric operation under a large temperature gradient is of great impor-
tance. One method for retaining such structures is based on the generation of
thermodynamically driven phase separation reactions such as spinodal decom-
position or nucleation and growth. For understanding the thermodynamic
conditions required for generation of such reactions, a basic understanding of the
thermodynamics of mixing is required and will be given referring to Figure 1.3.
The Gibbs energy of mixing, ΔGm, for a binary A–B mixture, can be described
in terms of Eq. (1.2) [21].
ΔGm = ΔHm −TΔSm
= 𝜔⋅x ⋅(1 −x) + T ⋅R ⋅[(1 −x) ⋅ln(1 −x) + x ⋅ln(x)]
(1.2)
The left term of Eq. (1.2) represents the enthalpy of mixing, ΔHm, while the
right term represents the entropy term of mixing (−TΔSm), where T is the abso-
lute temperature, ΔSm is the entropy of mixing, x is the concentration of one of
the mixture’s components (the concentration of the other component is therefore

1 −x), 𝜔is the interaction parameter between the mixture’s components A and
B, and R is the ideal gas constant (=8.314 J/mol/K). In ideal mixtures or ideal
solutions, in which the enthalpies of mixing equal zero, ΔGm is solely determined
by the entropy of mixing. The regular solution model, described by Eq. (1.2),
is a simple example of a nonideal solution that can be referred to many of the
binary mixtures available in practical thermoelectric systems. ΔSm is always
positive, since there is always a positive entropy gain upon mixing, and therefore
–TΔSm is always negative, as described in Figure 1.3a for various temperatures.
Therefore, it can be shown that entropy considerations will solely lead to a
homogeneous solution with an always negative ΔGm function. Consequently,
the miscibility characteristics of the two components A and B in a binary
mixture are solely determined by the enthalpy of mixing and more speciﬁcally
by the dimensionless interaction parameter 𝜔(Eq. (1.2)) between the mixture’s
components. A negative chemical interaction (𝜔< 0), which is the most common
situation, will lead to a high solubility substitution of the matrix A and B atoms,
forming a single solubility phase. In this case, both ΔHm and ΔGm will follow
the same trend of the (−TΔSm) function in Figure 1.3a, exhibiting one deep
minimum. A more rare situation, in which an attractive chemical interaction

8
1 Utilizing Phase Separation Reactions for Enhancement of the Thermoelectric Eﬃciency
(𝜔> 0) exists, can lead to an inhomogeneous distribution of the substitution
atoms, leading to phase separation and a miscibility gap in the phase diagram as
will be explained in the following few sentences. In this case, ΔHm will follow the
trend observed in Figure 1.3a, exhibiting one maximum, and ΔGm, which is the
sum of the positive ΔHm and the negative (−TΔSm) functions, and will follow
the two local minima trend shown in Figure 1.3b. The ΔGm curves, obtained at
various temperatures as shown in Figure 1.3b, can determine the phase diagram
of the system (Figure 1.3c). Steady-state conditions, deﬁned by the binodal curve,
representing the limits of solid solubility, can be obtained by the intersection of
each of the isothermal curves of Figure 1.3b with a common tangent. These are
the local minima compositions, obtained for each temperature, satisfying the
dGm/dx = 0 condition. The spinodal curve of the phase diagram (Figure 1.3c) is
determined by the inﬂection points (d2Gm/dx2 = 0) of the free energy isotherms
of Figure 1.3b. Under the spinodal curve, namely, between the inﬂection points,
where the curvature of the free energy function is negative (d2Gm/dx2 < 0), the
spinodal decomposition mechanism of phase separation can occur. Therefore,
for compositions within the spinodal curve, a homogeneous solution is unstable
against microscopic compositional ﬂuctuations, and there is no thermodynamic
barrier to the growth of a new phase. As a result, the phase transformation is
spontaneous, does not require any external activation energy, and is solely diﬀu-
sion controlled. The compositions between the spinodal and the binodal curves,
in which the curvature of the free energy function is positive (d2Gm/dx2 > 0), are
considered as metastable, and in this region of the phase diagram the nucleation
and growth mechanism for phase separation will dominate. In this region, a
nucleus of a critical size has to form before it is energetically favorable for it
to grow. Therefore, in contrast to the spinodal decomposition which can be
treated purely as a diﬀusion problem, by an approximate analytical solution
to the general diﬀusion equation, theories of nucleation and growth have to
involve thermodynamic considerations, and the diﬀusion problem involved in
the growth of the nucleus is far more diﬃcult to solve. Furthermore, owing to
the rapid phase separation mechanism involved in spinodal decomposition,
this reaction is uniformly distributed throughout the materials by continuous
low amplitude periodic modulations and not just at discrete nucleation sites
as in the nucleation and growth regime. As a result, spinodal decomposition is
characterized by a very ﬁnely dispersed microstructure, shown in Figure 1.3d,
which can signiﬁcantly reduce the lattice thermal conductivity and consequently
maximize ZT. In this ﬁgure, the continuous compositional modulations of A
and B atoms, obtained by crossing the two separated phases, can be easily seen.
The ﬁrst explanation of the ﬂuctuation’s periodicity was originally given by
Hillert [22], upon derivation of a ﬂux equation for one-dimensional diﬀusion
on a discrete lattice based on a regular solution model. The equation takes
into account the interfacial energy eﬀects between adjacent separated phases.
Subsequently, the eﬀects of coherency strains on dictating the morphology were
included by Cahn [23]. Therefore, both of the phase separation phenomena
described above represent two mechanisms by which a solution of two or
more components can be separated into distinct phases with diﬀerent chemical
compositions and physical properties. Owing to the rapid reactions involved,

usually the associated microstructure is ﬁnely dispersed and in many cases under
deﬁned stabilization conditions as in the submicron range, which is optimal for
reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity and enhancement of ZT. In recent
years, several thermoelectric material classes have shown ZT enhancement due
to phase separation of one single matrix composition into two distinct phases.
One example is the Heusler family of compounds. Phase separation of the qua-
ternary Heusler compounds Co2Mn1−xTixSn into Co2MnSn and Co2TiSn [24],
and of Ti(1−x)MnxCoSb into TiCoSb and MnCoSb [25], resulting in submicron
periodicity of the phase-separated material as well as a major reduction of the
thermal conductivity was recently shown by Felser’s group [24, 25]. Moreover,
theoretical phase diagram calculations for the system CoTi1−xFexSb clearly show
a miscibility gap and a tendency for spinodal decomposition [26], highlighting
the potential for enhancement of the ZT values due to phase separation in this
system as well. In the next paragraph, several speciﬁc examples for IV–VI based
compounds, exhibiting enhanced thermoelectric properties following phase
separation reactions, will be given in more details.

Selected IV–VI Systems with Enhanced
Thermoelectric Properties Following Phase
Separation Reactions
As mentioned above in relation to Figure 1.1, two of the recently reported most
eﬃcient n- and p-type IV–IV based compounds are the (Pb0.95Sn0.05Te)0.92(PbS)0.08
and Ge0.87Pb0.13Te compositions, respectively, both following a phase separation
reaction into nanoscaled domains. Investigation of the quasi-binary PbTe–PbS
and PbTe–GeTe phase diagrams (Figure 1.4a,b) reveals that both exhibit an
extended miscibility gap and that both of the compositions mentioned above fall
inside the nucleation and growth zone of the phase diagrams, namely, between
the binodal and spinodal curves. It is noteworthy that for the former, the phase
diagram of the Pb0.95Sn0.05Te–PbS system is also shown as a blue curve in the
same graph, based on calculation of Pb0.95Sn0.05Te using the PbTe–SnTe phase
diagram instead of pure PbTe for the 100% point, pure PbS for the 0% point,
and intermediate reported points at 900, 1000, and 1200 K [27]. Indeed, for
Ge0.87Pb0.13Te, following a solution annealing treatment for stabilizing the matrix
high temperature single phase at a high temperature (873 K), a series of lower
temperature (723 K) aging thermal treatments resulted in nucleation of Pb- and
Ge-rich domains [3] and corresponding low thermal conductivity values. In this
case, the phases’ stability over time was relatively high.
Another example of interest, concerning the Gex(SnyPb1−y)1−xTe compositions
[4], is described in the following related to Figure 1.5. These compositions based
on the quasi-ternary GeTe—PbTe—SnTe system include the speciﬁc p-type
Ge0.5Pb0.25Sn0.25Te composition, exhibiting a maximal ZT of 1.2 as shown in
Figure 1.1a and the widely investigated Ge0.6Sn0.1Pb0.3Te composition [29–32],
the microstructure of which is shown in Figure 1.3d.
The GeTe—PbTe—SnTe quasi-ternary phase diagram, showing an extended
miscibility gap and a tendency to phase separation, is illustrated in Figure 1.5a,

falling well inside the miscibility gap in the area corresponding to spinodal
decomposition, which separates into Ge-rich (dark) and Pb-rich (bright) phases
(Figure 1.5b). In this ﬁgure, it can be seen that the phase separation evolution
follows various morphological stages from lamellar (at 24 h of 400 ∘C thermal
treatment) to spheroidized (at 1400 h) geometries with some inﬂuence on the
resultant ZT values as shown in Figure 1.5c,d. This ﬁgure shows results of the
investigation of the inﬂuence of geometrical morphologies on ZT following
various phase separation stages performed using the general eﬀective media
(GEM) theory [33], showing only slight variations of ZT during the phase
separation reaction, highlighting the high thermoelectric stability of these
reactions compared to other common nanogeneration methods.

Concluding Remarks
In the current chapter, the main advances in IV–VI based thermoelectric mate-
rials reported in recent years were reviewed. It was shown that during the recent
years both due to nanostructuring methods for reduction of thermal conductivity
and optimal electronic doping approaches, very high ZTs of up to ∼2.2 were
achieved, rendering this class of thermoelectric materials as the most thermo-
electrically eﬃcient up to temperatures of ∼500 ∘C, which is ideal for converting
the waste heat generated in diesel automotive engines into useful electricity.
The generation of phase separation reactions for retaining the nanostructuring
during practical operation conditions was described in detail as one of the most
advanced approaches for ZT enhancement in such materials. The conditions for
phase separation reactions, including the necessity for miscibility gap between
the various components of the system and the distinction between the speciﬁc
characteristics of the spinodal decomposition and nucleation and growth
regimes of this gap, were described. Advanced optimal doping approaches based
on generation of localized “deep” resonant states lying inside the energy gap,
which are capable of pinning the Fermi energy of the compounds at a favorable
level required for electronic thermoelectric optimization, were also described
as useful for enhancement of the ZT values. All of the described methods
for enhancing and retaining the ZT values upon long-term thermoelectric
applications can be extended to many other classes of thermoelectric materials.

Introduction
By converting heat into electricity, thermoelectric (TE) materials oﬀer a viable
solution for waste heat harvesting to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the application of TE materials
to utilize waste heat is still limited due to the low eﬃciency of TE system, that is,
about 5% for commercial devices. Therefore, developing high eﬃciency TE mate-
rials for waste heat recovery systems is urgent and will beneﬁt for both economy
and environment. The conversion eﬃciency of TE materials is evaluated by the
dimensionless ﬁgure of merit, ZT deﬁned as
ZT = T S2𝜎
𝜆
= T
S2𝜎
𝜆e + 𝜆L
(2.1)
where T is the average temperature of the hot and cold sides, S is the Seebeck
coeﬃcient, and 𝜎and 𝜆are the electrical and thermal conductivity of the material.
The total thermal conductivity (𝜆) is the sum of the electronic thermal conduc-
tivity (𝜆e) and the lattice thermal conductivity (𝜆L). The challenge to develop
TE materials with high performance is to tailor the interconnected TE physical
parameters – electrical conductivity, Seebeck coeﬃcient, and thermal conduc-
tivity for a crystalline system. Nanostructures provide a chance to disconnect
the linkage between thermal and electrical transport by introducing some new
scattering mechanisms. Recent improvements in TE eﬃciency appear to be cru-
cial by the eﬀorts to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity through nanostruc-
ture design. Reducing the size and dimensionality of TE materials in nanoscale
and nanostructured materials has been demonstrated to eﬀectively increase the
TE performance due to the quantum conﬁnement and nanostructure eﬀects [1].
The development of nanostructured materials including super-lattice systems
and nanowires has been well presented in recent reviews [2–9].
This chapter summarizes the progress that has been made in recent years
in developing bulk nanostructured materials to enhance the TE performance.

2 Nanostructured Materials: Enhancing the Thermoelectric Performance
Unlike many other nanostructured materials, bulk nanostructured materials
have shown the most promise for practical applications since they can be
fabricated in large quantities and suitable for TE device conﬁgurations. The
materials focused in this chapter include Bi—Te alloys, PbSb-based mate-
rials, half-Heusler (HH) alloys, skutterudite compounds, and some novel
nanostructured high-ZT oxides.
2.2
Approaches for Improving ZT
It is clear from Eq. (2.1) that a material with high ZT needs to have a large See-
beck coeﬃcient, which is often the cases of semiconductors or insulators with
low carrier concentration, and a high electrical conductivity like metals having
high carrier concentration. The relationship between carrier concentration and
the Seebeck coeﬃcient (S) and the electrical conductivity (𝜎) can be expressed as
S =
8𝜋2k2
B
3eh2 m∗T
( 𝜋
3n
) 2
3
(2.2)
𝜎= ne𝜇
(2.3)
where kB is the Boltzmann constant, e is the carrier charge, h is Planck’s constant,
m* is the eﬀective mass of the charge carrier, n is the carrier concentration, and 𝜇
is the carrier mobility. Typically, good TE materials are heavily doped semicon-
ductors with carrier concentration of 1019–1021/cm3 [10]. The Seebeck coeﬃcient
is large when a single type of carriers, that is, electron (n-type) or hole (p-type) is
remained, because mixed n-type/p-type charge carriers will lead to a low Seebeck
coeﬃcient due to the opposite Seebeck eﬀect. To achieve single type of carrier,
it is necessary to select materials with suitable energy bandgaps and appropriate
doping, in which n-type and p-type can be well separated. Therefore, eﬀective TE
materials are often heavy doped semiconductors in order to have both a single
carrier type and suﬃciently high carrier mobility.
An eﬀective TE material also needs to have a low thermal conductivity to main-
tain a temperature gradient. Aforementioned, thermal conductivity (𝜆) of TE
materials, consists of two parts: 𝜆L, which results from heat transporting phonons
travelling through the crystal lattice, and 𝜆e, which comes from heat carrying
charge carries (electrons or holes) moving through the crystal lattice. According
to the Wiedemann–Franz Law,
𝜆e = L𝜎T
(2.4)
where L is the Lorenz number, the electronic thermal conductivity is propor-
tional to the electrical conductivity. Therefore, it is not always the best choice for
TE materials to reduce the electronic thermal conductivity since the electrical
conductivity will be inversely aﬀected and has little or no improvement in ZT.
Lattice thermal conductivity 𝜆L can be deﬁned by the following expression [11].
𝜆L = 1
3Cv𝜈sΛ
(2.5)

2.2 Approaches for Improving ZT
17
where Cv is heat capacity, 𝜈s is the sound velocity, and Λ is the phonon mean
free path. It can be seen from Eq. (2.5) that lattice thermal conductivity is not
determined by the electronic structure. Therefore, enhancement of ZT could be
achieved by minimizing the lattice thermal conductivity.
Main approaches for improving ZT of TE materials are mentioned below.
The ﬁrst approach suggested by Slack is the “phonon glass electron
crystal-PGEC,” which proposes for the compounds that conduct the elec-
tricity as a crystalline material and the heat as a glass [12]. The research of new
TE systems based on the PGEC concept has led to an intensive eﬀort to better
understand the mechanisms that aﬀect the phonons scattering without changing
signiﬁcantly the electrical charge propagation. This approach can be applied
to search for the materials with complex crystal structures, where voids and
rattlers (heavy element atoms weakly bounded to the structure) would act as
eﬀective phonon scattering centers and reduce the lattice thermal conductivity
signiﬁcantly. With this approach, high ZT materials such as skutterudites [13],
clathrates [14, 15], and zintl compounds [16] have been found.
The second approach is through vacancies, interstitial atoms, and solid solu-
tions, which increase mass ﬂuctuations resulting in higher phonon scattering.
This approach is the most achievable in materials such as Zn4Sb3 [17, 18] and
HH alloys [19].
The third approach is the nanostructuring of TE materials, which suggests that
the ZT enhancement can be realized with nanoscale, nanostructured morpholo-
gies [20, 21]. Nanostructures can enhance the density of states (DOS) near Fermi
level via quantum conﬁnement and therefore increase the Seebeck coeﬃcient,
which provides a way to decouple thermopower and electrical conductivity.
The other approach is through the TE nanocomposites, which are constructed
by incorporating TE nanostructures in a matrix of bulk TE material or com-
pacting various TE nanostructures in a bulk form coupled with heavy doping
as illustrated in Figure 2.1. Faleev and Léonard [22] have developed a model to
predict the TE performance of a nanocomposite system with spherical metal-
lic nanoinclusion using the band bending concept at the metal–semiconductor
interface acting as energy ﬁlters. They have shown that the Seebeck coeﬃcient of

2 Nanostructured Materials: Enhancing the Thermoelectric Performance
TE nanocomposite is always enhanced, as compared with a nanoinclusion-free
system. The enhancement of ZT is dominant by the reduction in the lattice ther-
mal conductivity for low doping, while the electronic contribution becomes more
important for high doping.
Successful examples for this approach is PbS—Ag nanocomposite, in which Ag
nanodomains not only contribute to block phonon propagation, but also provide
electrons to the PbS host semiconductor and reduce the PbS intergrain energy
barriers for charge transport. The outstanding electrical properties along with
low thermal conductivities of PbS—Ag samples resulted in a TE ﬁgure of merit up
to a ZT = 1.7 at 850 K [23]. Another example has been also successfully demon-
strated on the Lu-doped layered cobaltite system with Ag metal nanoinclusions,
leading to a remarkable improvement of ZT [24].
2.3
Recent Progress in Developing Bulk Thermoelectric
Materials
Over the past 10 years, the exploration of high performance TE materials has
attracted great attention from an academic research perspective. The devel-
opment of TE materials has made an impressive progress in improving ZT.
Figure 2.2 shows ZT as a function of temperature for state-of-the-art p-type (a)
and n-type (b) bulk TE materials.
For p-type materials, in low temperature range (RT – 550 K) besides Bi2Te3
alloy [25] a new class of TE materials based on MgAgSb.with comparable ZT
of 1–1.4 has been recently developed [26]. It is worth to note that ZT of these
new materials increase with increasing temperature, while the tendency of ZT
is opposite for Bi2Te3-based materials. In the temperature region from 550 to
900 K, there exist diﬀerent high-performance TE systems such as PbTe [27],
PbTe—SrTe [28], Clathrate [14], skutterudite compound [13], and TAGS [29].
Notably in medium temperature range, a high ZT of 1.4 has been achieved for
a textured oxide system of Bi0.875Ba0.125CuSeO [30, 31]. In high temperature
region above 900 K, Cu2Se [32], Zint compounds [16], HH alloys [33, 34], and
SiGe [35], and layered cobaltite oxides [24] are the potential TE materials.
As for n-type TE materials, in low temperature region below 550 K the dom-
inant material is still Se-doped Bi2Te3 alloy [36]. In the temperature range of
550–900 K, the best TE material so far are skutterudite compounds with a maxi-
mum ZT up to 1.7 at 850 K [37]. Some other TE systems such as HH alloys [38],
PbTe [39], and Mg2Si [40] are also the high ZT materials. In the high tempera-
ture region, there exist only few potential TE materials; they are Si0.78Ge0.22 [41],
La3Te4 [42], and doped ZnO [43, 44].
In order to evaluate how eﬃcient these TE materials can bring up, the eﬃciency
of each material was calculated as a single leg using the numerical modeling as
presented in our previous works [44, 45].

where Sc, Sh, Tc, Th are the Seebeck coeﬃcient and the temperature at the cold
and the hot side temperature; uc and uh are the reduced current density at the
cold and the hot side temperature, respectively.
Provided in Table 2.1 is the conversion eﬃciency (𝜂) of each single material
under various the hot side temperatures, while the cold side temperature is ﬁxed
at 300 K. It can be seen from Table 2.1 that below 900 K PbTe-based materials,
skutterudites and HH compounds are the most promising materials for making
high performance TE power generation devices. In the high temperature region
above 900 K, although oxides have low conversion eﬃciency, they are still promis-
ing due to their signiﬁcant higher eﬃciency ratio (eﬃciency per material cost)
than that for intermetallic compounds, that is, Zintl and La3Te4 [45].
In the following sections, we will focus on recent developments of typical bulk
nanostructures/nanocomposites materials with high potential for large scale
applications.
2.4
Bulk Nanostructured Thermoelectric Materials
2.4.1
Bi2Te3-Based Nanocomposites
Doped-Bi2Te3 and their related nanocomposites are extensively used for com-
mercial TE devices. Shown in Figure 2.3 is ZT as a function of temperature for
polycrystalline p-type Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 (a) and n-type Bi2(Te,Se)3 (b) bulk nanocom-
posites, fabricated by spark plasma sintering technique (SPS) from ball-milled
nanopowders. Since the materials sintered by SPS often show anisotropic
transport properties, it is important to characterize all TE parameters in the
same direction. In-plane ZT reached a value of over 1.4 at 327 K [47] for p-type
and 0.8 at 420 K for n-type. It is clear from Figure 2.3 that the TE properties of
SPS-sintered samples are anisotropic and the eﬀect is much more substantial for
n-type than p-type. In addition, the samples sintered by SPS are highly textured
leading to an enhanced in-plane TE properties.
An in-plane ZT of ∼1.1 at 398 K was reported for n-type Bi2Te3-based
nanocomposites [48]. The reports on the properties of p-type Bi2Te3-based
nanocomposites show a wide variation in the ZT values, ranging from ∼0.5 to
1.56 for similar compositions. For example, a high ZT of about 1.5 at 390 K was
achieved in (Bi,Sb)2Te3 nanocomposites by melt spinning single elements of Bi,
Sb, and Te followed by the SPS process [49], while a ZT of 0.51 was reported
for nanostructured bulk Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 sample at 375 K [50]. The ZT values of
1.47 [51] and 1.56 [52, 53] were obtained in nanocomposites fabricated by
hot pressing of Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 nanopowders with diameters below 20 nm
and with 5–15 nm diameter precipitates produced by melt spinning and SPS.
A similar ZT value of 1.47 was also observed for a 0.2 wt.% Mn-decorated
Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 nanocomposite [54]. Several attempts have been made on the
nanocomposites of Bi2Te3 with B4C nanoparticles addition [55] and with MoS2
nanoinclusion [56] or mixed with In2Te3 [57]. The thermal conductivity was
observed to be signiﬁcantly reduced. Very recently, we have achieved a ZT of
1.5 at 325 K for a nanocomposite of Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 with 0.05% B-doped single
wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTS) and 10% Te addition, which is about 16%
improvement as compared to the matrix sample [58] (Figure 2.4).

2.4.2
PbTe-Based Nanostructured Materials
A very high ZT of about 2.2 at 915 K [28] was achieved for a p-type PbTe—SrTe
(4 mol%) nanostructures doped with 2 mol% Na prepared by SPS, as shown
in Figure 2.5. By controlling and ﬁne-tuning the mesoscale architecture of
nanostructured TE materials (Figure 2.5a), the lattice thermal conductivity was
intensively reduced due to the increasing phonon scattering. This increase in
ZT beyond the threshold of 2 (Figure 2.5b) highlights the role of, and need
for, multiscale hierarchical architecture in controlling phonon scattering in
bulk TE materials. A similar ZT value of 2 was also observed in complex
nanostructured PbTe-based n-type compound Ag1−xPb18SbTe20 fabricated by

the melt-grown method [59]. A high ZT of 1.7 at 750 K has been obtained
for Na-doped MgxPb1−xTe alloys [27]. A ZT value higher than 1 has also
been achieved for a number of other PbTe-based nanostructured materials,
including AgPbmSbTe2+m, AgPbmSnnSbTe2+m+n, NaPbmSbTe2+m, KPbmSbTem+2,
and PbTe—PbS [56–66].
2.4.3
Half-Heusler Alloys
HH alloys are very promising materials for waste heat recovery applications due
to their high TE performance, environmental friendliness, high stability, moder-
ate cost, and good mechanical properties [19, 34, 67–90]. Associated with their
high Seebeck coeﬃcient and electrical conductivity is the relatively high ther-
mal conductivity of HH alloys, which is their main drawback. Much eﬀort has

2.4 Bulk Nanostructured Thermoelectric Materials
23
been put to ﬁnd HH compositions and preparation methods that result in opti-
mum TE properties [19, 34, 67–69, 71–77, 79–81, 83–86, 88–90]. The p-type HH
alloy with stoichiometric composition Hf0.5Zr0.5CoSb0.8Sn0.2 has become espe-
cially appealing after the ﬁnding of its record ZT = 0.8 at 973 K by nanostruc-
turing approach [19]. From a theoretical point of view, nanostructures help scat-
tering phonons but not electrons, or even increase the electrical conductivity by
other eﬀect due to band engineering such as the modulation doping eﬀect. The
ZT values of 0.97 at 973 K and ≥1 at 1073 K were achieved in nanostructured
Hf0.44Zr0.44Ti0.12CoSb0.8Sn0.2 prepared by hot-pressing (HP) [88]. Lately, it has
been reported that in addition to nanostructures, the intrinsic phase separation
of HH [68, 69, 75, 81, 90] is also a key feature to reduce its thermal conductiv-
ity without a negative eﬀect on the electrical conductivity. In order to develop
and preserve phase separation as well as nanostructures, appropriate preparation
methods are necessary. Conventional hot pressing of material after ball milling
has the major drawback of drastic grain growth. On the other hand, SPS is a novel
method with the superior features to maintain the inhomogeneity necessary for
selective phonon-scattering. The method has become inevitable for the synthesis
of TE nanostructured materials. Shown in Figure 2.6 is typical microstructure and
ZT as a function of temperature for our recently developed p-type bulk nanos-
tructured Hf0.5Zr0.5CoSn0.2Sb0.8 prepared by SPS. A maximum ZT value of 0.9 at
973 K was achieved [77]. The microstructure with nano arrays embedded in the
matrix (Figure 2.6a) resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of the thermal conductiv-
ity, leading to better ZT values than an ingot sample over the whole investigated
temperature region (Figure 2.6b).
Very recently, high quality HH alloys of FeNb1−xHfxSb and FeNb1−yZrySb
(x, y = 0 ÷ 0.16) have been developed by levitation melting and SPS [34]. A peak
ZT of 1.5 was reached at 1200 K for FeNb0.88Hf0.12Sb and FeNb0.86Hf0.14Sb.
This research group has also demonstrated a prototype TE module made of
n-type ZrNiSn-based alloys and p-type FeNbSb compounds with a conversion
eﬃciency of 6.2% at a temperature diﬀerence of 655 K. Together with low cost,
excellent mechanical properties and stability, these ﬁndings open up a great
opportunity of using HH alloys for high-temperature TE power generation
devices.

2 Nanostructured Materials: Enhancing the Thermoelectric Performance
2.4.4
Nanostructured Skutterudite Materials
Skutterudite materials with the general formula of BX3 where B is the transition
metal of Fe, Co, Rh, or Ir, and X is a pnictogen such as P, As, or Sb. The crystalline
structure of BX3 skutterudite consists of two B4X12 units and two large empty
cages per unit cell. The empty cages can be ﬁlled with alkali, alkaline-earth,
rare-earth, actinide, or Tl elements forming the formula of AyB4X12 with
maximum ﬁll cages when y is equal to 1. Therefore, there are hundreds of
families of skutterudite materials which can bring a great potential application
in many diﬀerent ﬁelds, one of this is TE energy conversion [91].
As for nanostructured skutterudites materials, diﬀerent approaches have been
proposed to achieve a ﬁgure of merit as high as possible. The combination of
doping elements and control particles/grain sizes of bulk sample is the preferred
methodology. Compacting nanopowders is the preferable method to fabricate
bulk nanostructured skutterudites. The synthesis method of nanopowders can be
roughly summarized into: (i) wet chemical synthesis such as solvothermal route
[92], sol–gel [93], hydrothermal [94], coprecipitation process [95], and (ii) phys-
ical synthesizes, for example, ball milling [13, 96], melt spinning [97–104].
A wet chemically synthesized nanostructured inorganic material has low-cost,
low-temperature reaction, and can be easily implemented for mass production.
Therefore, this synthesis method has attracted considerable interest in the
fabrication of skutterudites materials. The starting inorganic materials normally
are grade analytical chlorides of metal such as SbCl3, CoCl2, NiCl2, and so
on, and agent tetra ethylene glycol, NaBH4 for solvothermal synthesis, or HCl,
NH3 for co-precipitation, and C6H8O7 for the sol–gel method. The synthesis
temperature is kept at room temperature for co-precipitation, and 220–290 ∘C
for the solvothermal process. The reaction duration is from 12 to 72 h. By using
the wet chemical method, the obtained particle sizes of powder are in the range
of 10–200 nm [92, 93, 95, 105–112]. Most of the studies were conducted on
the CoSb3 based compound with partially ﬁlled cages of skutterudite structures
[105], or partially substituted Co sites by other transition metal of Ni, or Fe [108,
109, 111].
The main purpose of controlling particle/grain size is to increase phonon scat-
tering to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of the TE sample. The ther-
mal conductivity of the pure CoSb3 sample was reduced below 1 W/m/K in the
temperature range of 300–600 K [95, 105, 111], which is lower about an order
magnitude than that of single crystal sample [113]. In this case, the grain size of
fabricated sample is less than 100 nm. Despite the low value of thermal conduc-
tivity the ﬁgure of merit of those samples is still small, that is, less than 0.2 at
700 K [95, 105, 111]. By introducing ﬁlling element into cage sites of AyB4X12,
the thermal conductivity values were also reduced by a factor of two for the case
of Ba0.048CoSb3 [105], LaFe3CoSb12, CeFe3CoSb12, and La0.5Ce0.5Fe3CoSb12 [106,
107]. Consequently, improvement in the ﬁgure of merit is obviously seen, the
high-value ZT of 0.82 attained at 773 K for the La0.5Ce0.5Fe3CoSb12 sample. In
addition, the sintering technique also plays a crucial role. The study by Mi et al.
[92, 109] shows that the SPS is dominated with shorter sintering duration and

2.4 Bulk Nanostructured Thermoelectric Materials
25
higher density, as well as better maintain nanostructures of synthesis powder
in the bulk sample. Despite the advantages of low-cost, easy to control the size
of powder, the quality of powder of the wet chemical synthesis still needs to be
further optimized [95, 112] to obtain a better value of ZT. It should be noticed
here that the skutterudite powder synthesized by wet chemical methods has not
been widening apply in the fabrication of TE module. The quality of chemical, the
solution, water, and so on, and also many step of preheating or drying during the
process could be the cause of introducing the contaminated elements.
In contrast to the wet chemical synthesis, the physical method uses high energy
to produce the alloy with higher crystallize, and hence it would further improve
the ZT value [114]. With the rapid solidiﬁcation the melt spinning technique pro-
vides a useful tool for bulk nanostructuring skutterudite materials [97–104]. By
using this method the stoichiometry of compounds was ﬁrst produced by solid
state reaction method either using fast melting in tube ampule or arc-melting,
the ingots are then inductively melted under protection gas and spun on the cold
copper wheel. The SPS technique is usually used to consolidate the ribbon. In
general, the studies on skutterudites based on CoSb3 is mostly investigated with
various of ﬁlling fraction in the cage sites by using rare earth element of Yb [97,
98, 102, 103], Ce [99, 100, 104], or Ca [101], Ba [102]. The typically obtained
nanocrystal size is from 10 to 100 nm which can be controlled by adjusting the
rotating speed of the cold copper wheel. The grain size of bulk nanostructured
form is in the range of 100–300 nm, especially can be up to 50 μm [102]. As the
results of introducing the nanostructured size, the thermal conductivity reduces
remarkably as compared to non-nanostructured samples, that is, the decreasing
by a factor of two is reported on n-type Yb0.3Co4Sb12 materials [97]. Interestingly,
the increment of Seebeck coeﬃcient of about 10% was also observed in smaller
nano-grains [97]. The high ZT values of 1.3 for n-type Yb0.3Co4Sb12.3 [98] and
1 for p-type Ce0.9Fe3.4Co0.6Sb12 [99, 100] were obtained at 800 K. However, the
small quantity by melt spinning for nanostructuring skutterudite materials has
limited the usage of these materials for constructing TE device. It is, therefore,
expected that the large quantity with high quality of materials would be taken into
account.
With advantages of mass production, that is, can be produced tons of nanos-
tructured powders the high energy ball milling oﬀers a great possibility of real-
izing material research into application [13, 96, 114–122]. Recently, the high ZT
values of 1.3 at 775 K for DDy(Fe1−xCox)4Sb12 (DD: didymium) p-type and 1.6
at 800 K for (Mm,Sm)yCo4Sb12 (Mm: mischmetal) n-type skutterudite materials
have been obtained [13], which will be expedited for building up a high conver-
sion eﬃciency TE module. The high energy ball milling can reduce the crystallite
size to nanoscale from 50 to 300 nm, resulting in improvement of ZT from 20%
to 200% [116, 118, 119]. The hot press is used to consolidate the nanopowder
with pressure around 60 MPa, the temperature of sintering 700 ∘C for holding
30 min [13]. Using SPS technique, we have optimized a sintering process, which
is potential for mass production with TE performance similar to the best result
reported so far on the same compositions (Figure 2.7a–c).

Nanostructured Oxide Materials
2.4.5.1
p-Type Oxides
For p-type oxide TE materials,,nanoscale layered cobaltite systems [24, 123–139]
have been intensively investigated due to their good TE performance [128, 132]
(ZT = 0.83 at 973 K for the single crystal [128]). However, single crystals are
less likely to be applied for fabricating practical TE devices. It is hence highly
desirable to achieve suﬃcient TE properties in a polycrystalline form of these
oxides. Among layered cobaltite systems, misﬁt-layered Ca3Co4O9+ oxides have
attracted much attention due to their low cost, good TE performance as well as
their highly durability at high temperatures [123–130, 133–139]. In fact, many
attempts have been made over the years to enhance the TE performance of the
polycrystalline Ca3Co4O9 by either ions doping [125–127, 129, 133, 134, 137]
and improving the fabrication methods, for example, employing HP or SPS tech-
niques [127, 135, 136, 139].
SPS technique, which is a pressure assisted pulsed current fast sinter-
ing process, oﬀers an advantageous way to fabricate nanostructured bulk
materials. With SPS technique, the microstructure of the material and crystal
growth are well controlled while maintaining the original properties of the
materials. Employing this fabrication method, we have synthesized some

oriented lamellar-like nanostructures doped with heavy ions together with
embedded metallic nanoinclusions, for example, Ag. Shown in Figure 2.8 is an
example of Ni and Ag co-doped Ca3Co4O9+ nanocomposite prepared by SPS. At
1100 K, the power factor was more than 40% improved comparing with a pure
Ca3Co4O9+ sample (Figure 2.8a). It is worth to note that the TE performance
is reproduced after various thermal cycles. It is evident from Figure 2.8b that
Ni homogenously distributed, while Ag remains some nanosized crystals in the
matrix. This suggests that Ni fully substituted for Co, while Ag only partly doped
for Ca and the rest stays as nanoinclusions. A ZT value of 0.4 was achieved at
1100 K for this material. A higher ZT value of 0.5 at 1000 K was reported for
a polycrystalline nanocomposite of Ca3Co4O9+ either doped or added with Ag
[140]. Figure 2.9 shows ZT versus temperature and high-resolution transmission

2 Nanostructured Materials: Enhancing the Thermoelectric Performance
nanostructural approach has led to a remarkable improvement of ZT = 0.6 at
1100 K resulted from a signiﬁcantly reduction in the thermal conductivity and
the enhanced power factor [24]. It is more interesting to note that ZT of this
material is further improved by about 6% after a subsequent heat treatment and
then this high ZT value maintained even after further extremely heating and
cooling cycles (Figure 2.9b). The excellent chemical and thermal stability of this
material as well as the rapid increase in ZT with increasing temperature strongly
suggest this system as a very promising oxide TE material for high temperature
power generation.
A segmented p-type material of doped misﬁt-layered cobaltite Ca2.8Lu0.15Ag0.05
Co4O9+𝛿and HH Ti0.3Zr0.35Hf0.35CoSb0.8Sn0.2 alloy was demonstrated with a
maximum conversion eﬃciency of 5% at ΔT ≈756 K, which is the highest value
reported for a oxide-based material [141].
2.4.5.2
n-Type Oxides
Nanostructured ZnO-based oxides have gained much interest because they are
low-cost along with their good TE properties [43, 44, 142–145]. A small amount
of Al doping could result in a remarkable decrease in the electrical resistivity
and change the conduction behavior from semiconducting to metallic. A long
history of development through nanostructuring as well as heavily doping on
this material for high temperature TE oxide has recently led to a successive
progress in ZT = 0.47 at 1000 K and 0.65 at 1247 K for a dual doping of Al and
Ga using conventional pressing techniques [44]. Jood et al. [43] have reported a
ﬁgure-of-merit, ZT of 0.44 at 1000 K for a nanostructured Al-doped ZnO. Very
recently, a ZT value of 0.6 at 1273 K has been achieved [143], again conﬁrming
that the ZnO-based oxide is a good candidate n-type high temperature TE
material.
CdO-based oxides and their nanocomposites have recently emerged as new
n-type TE oxide materials [146–148]. A ZT value of 0.41 at 1000 K was achieved
for nanocomposite of CdO with SiO2 nanoinclusion resulted from a 80% reduc-
tion of the thermal conductivity [146]. With Eu and Pr doping, the ZT values
increase from 0.2 [147] to 0.38 [148] at 1000 K.
2.5
Outlook and Challenges
Bulk nanostructured materials have made an impressive progress with many high
ZT systems such as PbTe-SrTe (ZTmax = 1.7 ÷ 2.2), Clathrates (ZTmax = 1.2 ÷ 1.4),
Skutterudites (ZTmax = 1.2 ÷ 1.7), HH alloys (ZTmax = 1.1 ÷ 1.5), and TE oxides
(0.6 ÷ 1.4). However, so far most of them have not yet been realized in high eﬃ-
ciency practical devices. There exist a big gap between the eﬃciency of TE mate-
rials and the eﬃciency of their modules. To approach practical applications of TE
energy conversion, some issues should be carefully considered:
• Stability under large temperature gradients: on operation, a TE device is
subjected to high temperatures under large temperature diﬀerences. Under
such conditions, nanostructures may suﬀer an intensive microstructure

evolution, which can deteriorate the TE performance. In addition, under large
temperature diﬀerence with fast enough cooling at the cold side the intrinsic
properties are also very much diﬀerent when measuring the material under
small temperature diﬀerence. Zn4Sb3 with a max ZT ∼1.4 [18] is an typical
example for this case. Under a large temperature at the hot side above 473 K
and a fast enough cooling at the cold side, Zn whiskers were observed to come
out of the materials at the cold part which eventually gets a mechanical failure
[149]. Therefore, it strongly suggests that one should test the materials under
large temperature gradients before building up their modules.
• Mechanical properties under thermal cycling: the long-term stability of TE
materials and devices is equally important to their conversion eﬃciency. The
mismatch in thermal expansion coeﬃcient between diﬀerence crystal phases
co-existing in the TE nanostructured or nanocomposite materials as well as
between TE materials with contact materials is often the major reason leading
to the device failure. Therefore, eﬀort should be also put on improving the
mechanical strength of high performance TE materials.
• Interfacial contact resistances: large interfacial thermal and electrical contact
resistances are the main reason for the gap between the eﬃciencies of TE mate-
rials and modules. It is important to not only minimize the contact resistance
but also to prevent it from diﬀusion/reaction. Developing advanced joining
techniques and in-situ methods to understand the mechanism at interfaces
under dynamic condition should play an important role in making future high
eﬃciency TE devices.

Introduction
Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) convert heat into electricity, and could con-
tribute to the world’s increasing energy demand by harvesting low-energy-density
heat, such as waste heat produced during the conversion of fossil fuels to
electricity or heat from solar radiation. The eﬃciency of the heat–electricity
conversion is dictated by the material properties. One of the pressing chal-
lenges in thermoelectricity is to ﬁnd a naturally abundant material with good
thermoelectric properties that can enable the implementation of TEG on
an industrial scale. We then present the key material properties that help
deﬁne the heat-to-electricity conversion eﬃciency. The ability of a material to
transport heat and electrical currents is dictated by the values of the thermal
(𝜆) and electrical (𝜎) conductivities. The independent transport of electrons
and phonons in a material is described by Ohm’s law (⃗i = 𝜎⃗E) and Fourier’s
law (⃗q = −𝜆⃗∇T), respectively. The thermoelectric phenomenon arises in the
simultaneous presence of both electrical and thermal currents. The Seebeck
eﬀect refers to the possibility of creating an electrostatic potential and thus an
electrical current from a temperature gradient (see second term in Eq. (3.1)). A
TEG is an electronic device that uses the Seebeck eﬀect to convert a heat ﬂow
into an electron ﬂow.
⃗i = 𝜎(⃗E −S ⃗∇T)
(3.1)
Here E is the electric ﬁeld, i is the electric current density, T is the tempera-
ture, and S is the Seebeck coeﬃcient. The Seebeck coeﬃcient is deﬁned as the
open circuit voltage obtained between the two ends of a material subjected to a
temperature diﬀerence.

3 Organic Thermoelectric Materials
Seebeck coeﬃcients can be as small as a few microvolts per kelvin for metals
and as large as several millivolts per kelvin for electrical insulators [1, 2].
In order to generate an electrical power (P = VI, V is the potential and I is
the current), a thermoelectric material should have the following two properties:
(i) it should transport the current eﬃciently, that is, possess a high electrical con-
ductivity 𝜎; (ii) it should produce a signiﬁcant thermo-induced voltage, that is,
have a high Seebeck coeﬃcient (V = SΔT); and (iii) it should have a low thermal
conductivity 𝜆, to ensure that a large temperature diﬀerence (ΔT) is maintained.
The maximum eﬃciency of a TEG is governed by material parameters (S, 𝜆, 𝜎)
regrouped in the thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit Z (see Eq. (3.3)). Hence, Z (units
per Kelvin) can be seen as a measure of the thermoelectric eﬃciency of a given
material.
Z = 𝜎S2
𝜆
(3.3)
ZT quantiﬁes the ratio between the thermal energy passing through the ther-
moelectric element and the electrical energy produced. The best thermoelectric
materials possess ZT values around unity. One of the major challenges in ther-
moelectricity is that no eﬃcient thermoelectric materials of high abundance have
been found for low temperature applications (<500 K) [3], while 50% of the waste
heat and the solar thermal energy lie in the range 300–500 K. The eﬃciency of the
TEG is the ratio between the thermal power input and the electrical power out-
put [3] and it is proportional to (1 + ZT)1/2. A TEG composed of a material with
ZT = 1 is expected to reach 5% eﬃciency if the temperature diﬀerence between
its hot and cold sides is set to 100 K.
Thermoelectric materials constitute a special class of materials with low
thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity, often described as
“phonon-glass and electron-crystal” materials [4]. Organic conductors are
known for their intrinsic low thermal conductivity (such as glasses or other amor-
phous systems), but they are electrically conducting. There are various classes of
organic conductors, such as doped small conjugated molecules or organic charge
transfer salt (e.g., tetrathiafulvalene–7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane TTF–
TCNQ; Figure 3.1a), doped conjugated polymers (e.g., poly(3-hexylthiophene;
Figure 3.1b) or carbon-based nano-objects (e.g., carbon nanotubes CNT;
Figure 3.1c). The key advantage of polymers is that they can form homogeneous,
pin-holes-free ﬁlms by solution processing, compared to small molecules that
typically prefer to organize in crystals. Conducting polymers were discovered in
the late 1970s when it was demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that poly(acetylene)
exposed to iodine vapors could become conductive through a redox reaction
[5–7]. As a result, its electrical conductivity increased from 10−9 to 104 S/cm
followed by the formation of a metal-like low-weight and ﬂexible material, which
subsequently became known as a “synthetic metal” [7]. This phenomenon is
sometimes called “doping” in analogy with inorganic semiconductors. There
are however major diﬀerences between organic and inorganic semiconductors.
For conducting polymers, a counterion not covalently bound to the polymer
neutralizes the doping charge carried by the polymer chain. Also, dopant con-
centrations are in the parts per million range for inorganics, but range from a few

percent up to 40% for conducting polymers. Neutral or undoped conjugated
polymers have electrical conductivity values close to those of insulators, while
oxidized or doped conjugated polymers are called conducting polymers because
they show similarities with doped semiconductors and sometimes metals.
Highly doped conducting polymers without side chains are typically insoluble.
A common strategy for solubility enhancement lies in a dispersion formation via
micelle-like particles either with a soluble polymeric counterion (polystyrene
sulfonate for poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), PEDOT:PSS) [8] or using an
ionic surfactant serving as a counterion (camphorsulfonic acid for polyaniline,
Pani-CSA) [9]. The presence of speciﬁc high boiling point solvents favors better
polymer chain organization, removes the excess of insulating materials, and can
therefore increase the conductivity by several orders of magnitude [10, 11]. This
eﬀect is morphological in nature and is called “secondary” doping (to distinguish
it from the “primary” eﬀect related to oxidation/doping of the polymer). Highly
conducting PEDOT:PSS thin ﬁlms or patterns can be created on ﬂexible surfaces
via a low temperature water process, such as coating, spraying, and printing [8].
Today’s thermoelectric materials of choice for low temperature energy con-
version are bismuth chalcogenides, such as bismuth antimony telluride alloys
with ZT ∼1 (power factor PF = 𝜎S2 = 4500 μW/m/K2, 𝜆= 1.2 W/m/K) at room
temperature [12]. They are used in niche applications such as radioisotope TEGs
to power satellites. Those alloys are of low natural abundance and manufactured

using expensive processes, impeding the widespread use of thermoelectric
installations for waste heat recovery. Thus, widely available organic thermoelec-
tric materials have become of interest, despite their lower eﬃciencies. Figure 3.2
shows the evolution of PF over time for various potential classes of new abun-
dant thermoelectric materials operating around room temperature. Owing
to their intrinsic low thermal conductivity (𝜆< 1.5 W/m/K), semiconducting
polymers constitute one such class (blue points). Up to now, only p-doped
polymers showed decent thermoelectric properties, with PFs of 78 μW/m/K2
[ZT = 0.1] [13], 330 μWm−1K−2 [ZT = 0.25] [15], 320 μWm−1K−2 [ZT = 0.31]
[19], 500 μWm−1K−2 [ZT = 0.42] [17]. The challenge with n-doped polymers is
to increase the doping level to reach high conductivity while maintaining air
stability. Note that metal–organic polymers oﬀer an opportunity to get n-type
polymers with ZT = 0.1 [16] (yellow point).
Individual CNTs are a priori not promising as thermoelectrics because of their
intrinsic high thermal conductivity (𝜆= 1000 W/m/K). However, thick layers of
CNTs, composed of unaligned “bundles and mats,” have much lower thermal
conductivities – about 30 W/m/K. When the material is made of separated indi-
vidual bundles, 𝜆can reach 3 W/m/K because of the thermal contact resistance
between bundles. Previous works have reported the thermoelectric properties
of both n- and p-doped CNT-based materials with a mix of semiconducting
SWCNTs and metallic SWCNTs. Although there was a rise in PF values
(red points in Figure 3.2) from 25 μW/m/K2 [ZT = 0.08] [18] to 75 μW/m/K2
[ZT = 0.15] [20], the high conductivity of the metallic CNTs limited the PF.
To tackle this problem, researchers have exploited recent separation protocols

based on speciﬁc physicochemical interactions of CNTs with certain conju-
gated polymers, more especially polyﬂuorenes [24]. In doing so, they puriﬁed
and obtained samples with less than 1% of metallic SWCNTs and reached
PF = 340 μW/m/K2 [22]. CNTs display other desirable features for thermo-
electric applications, besides the ease of both n- and p-doping. They are much
more resistant to thermal degradation than polymers, and thus have a broader
operating temperature range. For temperatures above 200 ∘C, degradation of
molecular dopants might take place, but other atomic dopants could be more
resilient. Like semiconducting polymers, CNTs can be functionalized to create
stable dispersions and can be used as inks for printed electronics, which is seen
as a low-cost manufacturing method to replicate the hundreds of thermocouples
required in a TEG. Finally, SWCNTs could be combined with inorganic nanos-
tructures or conducting polymers to design hybrid nanocomposites (gray points
in Figure 3.2 from [14, 21]). The independent control of doping level of the
conducting polymer matrix and of the s-SWCNT might open up new avenues
for thermoelectric optimization. Recent results are promising, with PF claimed
to reach 1000 μW/m/K2 [21], but further investigation is needed.
3.2
Seebeck Coeﬃcient and Electronic Structure
The Seebeck coeﬃcient is intimately related to the electronic structure and
mobility of the charge carrier. Mott’s formula [25], which is valid for both
hopping and band motion transport mechanisms, states that
S = C
{d[ln(𝜎(E))]
dE
}
E=EF
∝
{d ln N(E)
dE
}
E=EF
(3.4)
where C = 𝜋3k2T/2|e|. From Einstein’s equation, 𝜎(E) ∝N(E)D(E), where N(E) is
the density of states (DoS) and D(E) is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. If we assume that
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is constant with energy, the Seebeck coeﬃcient is propor-
tional to the derivative of ln N(E) at the Fermi level energy EF. Hence, controlling
the shape of the density of state at the Fermi level in a material should enable
tuning its Seebeck coeﬃcient. Hence, it is crucial to understand the electronic
structure of conducting polymers.
The removal of electrons from the top of the valence band (VB) in a single poly-
mer chain can lead to two diﬀerent localized positively charged quasi particles:
positive polarons (radical cation) and bipolarons (dication) balanced by atomic
or molecular counterions. Highly oxidized polythiophenes such as PEDOT are
known to show a very small electron spin resonance (ESR) signal, suggesting the
presence of polaron pairs or bipolarons [26]. While the structure of the neutral
chain is typically characterized by an aromatic character, the bipolaron distor-
tion has a quinoid character characterized by a change in bond length alternation
(Figure 3.3a). This geometrical distortion around the excess of positive charge
deﬁnes the extent of the wavefunction of the (bi)polaron [27], featured by two new
empty in-gap states (i, i*) [29, 30]. In an amorphous phase, bipolaron levels are
localized on a segment of the chains. At high oxidation levels, the wave function

“intra-chain” band is created [31]. This band does, however, not extend through
the three dimensions of the solid, owing to disorder and the absence of the inter-
chain electronic coupling [32]. For this reason, in-gap states are spatially localized
with a spread in energy distribution. The Fermi level lies in a smooth region of
the density of state and among localized states between the VB and the bipolaron
band for a disordered bipolaronic polymer solid (Figure 3.3b) [33]. The slope of
lnN(E) at EF is small, which explains the small Seebeck coeﬃcient for amorphous
bipolaronic systems. The solid can be considered as a Fermi glass, which means
that the EF is within localized states [34, 35]. In a Fermi glass, the carrier is local-
ized and temperature-activated hopping is needed for the transport. In such a
situation, 𝜎→0, when T →0. This is the case for the PEDOT:PSS samples 1–4 in
Figure 3.3c.
When disorder decreases, some crystalline domains are formed and short
interchain distances result in an overlap of the 𝜋-electronic density of adjacent
packed chains, which promotes the delocalization of electronic wave function
[36], so bipolarons spread across several chains (Figure 3.3a) [37]. Highly oxi-
dized PEDOT possesses up to one charge carrier per three monomer units [38].
For semicrystalline bipolaronic polymers, a network of bipolarons is formed
such that the bipolaron wave functions overlap and create an extended empty
bipolaron band, merging with the ﬁlled VB. This is the electronic structure of
a semimetal with a large slope of lnN(E) at EF. Like metals, the conductivity
diminishes when the sample is heated, because the delocalized carriers scatter
with phonons. In Figure 3.3c, one observes an evolution from various PEDOT
derivatives from low Seebeck coeﬃcient at low conductivity to high Seebeck
coeﬃcient at high conductivity, which reﬂects the Fermi glass to semimetal
transition [39].
Further improvement in structural order (higher 𝜎) should, in principle, result
in even larger 𝛼and thus a higher thermoelectric power factor PF. For the sake of
comparison, a good thermoelectric material (nanostructured BiSbTe alloy) [30]
displays a similar conductivity range as that of PEDOT, but a much higher See-
beck coeﬃcient than PEDOT derivatives.

Seebeck Coeﬃcient and Charge Carrier Mobility
The charge carrier mobility 𝜇of conducting polymers is linked to the electronic
structure of the material and thus to the Seebeck coeﬃcient. Except for speciﬁc
samples found with appropriate morphology to exhibit semimetallic or metallic
character, the main charge transport mechanism in conducting polymer samples
is the thermally activated hopping transport between conducting sites existing
in an intrachain and an interchain level (Figure 3.4a). One often refers to a
non-homogeneous model with crystalline “metallic islands” dispersed in the
amorphous “insulating” polymer matrix [41]. Therefore, a material with an
increased number of these conducting domains would have a higher hopping
rate and hence higher charge carrier mobility. From a structural point of view,
a high degree of crystallinity beneﬁts the hopping transport in the polymer
material by decreasing the disorder and promoting interchain 𝜋–𝜋interactions.
However, electronically, these “metallic islands” are the extended 𝜋-systems
formed in the doped conjugated chains, where the charge carriers are being
delocalized. Consequently, the number of those sites in the polymer (and

thus the charge carrier mobility) is related both to the polymer charge carrier
concentration n and to the degree of crystallinity of the material. Considering
that the Seebeck coeﬃcient is strongly related both to the ﬁlling and the shape
of the DoS, it is not trivial to decorrelate the charge carrier concentration with
the charge carrier mobility and extract a relationship between 𝜇and S, which in
fact would be translated in the eﬀect of the DoS shape to the S.
Upon constant doping concentration though, any modiﬁcations on the charge
carrier mobility should be related only to the structural properties of the material
as indicated by the X-ray diﬀraction pattern in Figure 3.4c (high mobility is
connected to high diﬀraction intensity). An increase in the degree of crystallinity
of the polymer should extend the 𝜋-system of the doped conjugated chains
because the p-orbitals of the units would overlap. This results in a broadening
of the deep 𝜋-bands in the band edge as probed by ultraviolet photoelectron
spectroscopy (UPS) (Figure 3.4d), which extends to the even deeper bands
near the Fermi energy [36, 42]. Thus, the slope of the DoS at the Fermi level
would become steeper and the Seebeck coeﬃcient of the material should
increase, following Eq. (3.4). This is clearly observed in Figure 3.4b, where the
Seebeck coeﬃcient is plotted against the relative charge carrier mobility, for
various PEDOT:Tos materials of constant carrier concentration. As a result, a
mild dependence of S = μ0.2 can be extracted. This mild dependency actually
highlights the eﬀect of the shape of the DoS to the polymer thermoelectric
properties. Ultimately, an increase of the charge carrier mobility would also
beneﬁt the electrical conductivity, since 𝜎is analogous to 𝜇(𝜎= en𝜇), resulting
in an enhanced thermoelectric power factor (PF ≈236 μW/m/K2) [40].
3.4
Optimization of the Figure of Merit
If the charge carrier concentration in a material is high then its Seebeck
coeﬃcient is small (e.g., metals); reciprocally, electric insulators display high
thermovoltages. The charge carrier concentration, or oxidation level, in the
conducting polymer poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene–tosylate (PEDOT:Tos)
can be decreased by exposure to a chemical reducing agent tetrakis(dimethy-
lamino)ethylene (TDAE) [14]. The conductivity diminishes dramatically from
300 S/cm at 36% oxidation level down to 10−4 S/cm at 15 % oxidation level
(Figure 3.5a). The Seebeck coeﬃcient S is modiﬁed by a factor of 20 upon expo-
sure of the polymer to the TDAE vapor, such that the power factor 𝜎S2 reaches
an optimum 324 μW/m/K2 at the oxidation level of 22%. Another example
is illustrated in Figure 3.5b for PEDOT:PSS introduced in an electrochemical
transistor. Tuning the gate voltage controls the oxidation level and similarly
an optimum is found for the power factor [43]. Note that these are not the
highest reported values for PEDOT:PSS, but illustrate optimization through an
electrochemical method. Note that the maximum in the power factor does not
mean that the maximum thermoelectric eﬃciency is exactly at that oxidation
level. Indeed, thermal conductivity varies with charge carrier concentration
as well. In electrically conducting materials, heat is transported both through

Equation (3.6) is the Wiedemann–Franz’s law, which shows the relationship
between the electrical conductivity and the electronic contribution to thermal
conductivity. L is the Lorentz factor equal to L0 = 2.4 × 10−8 J2/K2/C2 for a free
electron gas. The obtained apparent L is roughly a factor of 2.5 as large as the
Sommerfeld value L0 for PEDOT:Tos [44]. The value of the apparent L depends
on the nature of the polymers, and is, for example, close to L0 for PEDOT:PSS [45].
The origin of the observed deviation between the as-obtained apparent L and the
Sommerfeld value is still not clear. Conducting polymers have a non-negligible
electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity (similar to metals and doped
semiconductors). The bottom graph of Figure 3.5 displays the total thermal con-
ductivity of thin ﬁlms of PEDOT:Tos versus its oxidation level, assuming that
L = 2.5L0 and that L is constant with the oxidation level. In the limit of low elec-
trical conductivity, the thermal conductivity for PEDOT:Tos approaches about
0.8 W/m/K, which represents the lattice contribution 𝜆L [44]. We now summa-
rize the evolution of the three material parameters (𝜆, S, 𝜎) versus oxidation level
for a conducting polymer and accurately estimate the maximum ZT = 0.11 for
PEDOT:Tos for an oxidation level of ∼22% at room temperature [27].

N-Doping of Conjugated Polymers
TEGs are typically composed of many thermocouples connected electrically
in series and thermally in parallel. A thermocouple is made of two materials
with diﬀerent temperature-dependent properties so that a temperature gradient

across the device generates an electrical voltage. Owing to the thermal gradient,
electrons in the n-type leg of a thermocouple diﬀuse toward the cold side,
while holes diﬀuse in the p-type leg, also to the cold side. Thus, they generate a
voltage at the hot side. Hence, to create eﬃcient organic TEGs, n-type organic
conductors must be designed. With the exception of just a few polymers based
on benzodifurandione–phenylenevinylene derivatives that show n-type conduc-
tivity as high as 14 S/cm [46], solution-processed n-doped conducting polymers
typically suﬀer from a low conductivity (𝜎< 10−2 S/cm) [47]. The low 𝜎translates
into low PF and ultimately into a low ZT. Linear – “torsion-free” – ladder-type
conducting polymers, such as the solution-processible n-type polybenzimi-
dazobenzophenanthroline (BBL), can achieve n-type conductivity as high as
2.4 S/cm when doped with strong amino-based reducing agents. These values
are three orders of magnitude higher than those measured in distorted n-type
donor–acceptor polymers, such as the naphthalenediimide–bithiophene-based
P(NDI2OD-T2) (Figure 3.6a). An adequate description of polarons in long
BBL oligomers (approaching the polymer limit) suggests that the polaron
wavefunction in low-band-gap 𝜋-conjugated ladder-type polymers has a multi-
conﬁgurational character. The computed BBL polaron delocalization length is
larger than that of P(NDI2OD-T2), suggesting also a high polaron mobility along
the chain (Figure 3.6b). In this frame, the high BBL electron conductivity can be
already rationalized at the single-chain scale. By carefully modulating the doping
levels, the power factor 𝜎S2 of BBL reaches an optimum of 0.43 μW/m/K2,
which is one order of magnitude higher than that achieved in P(NDI2OD-T2)
(Figure 3.6c,d) [48].

Elastic Thermoelectric Polymers
The combination of elastic and thermoelectric properties seems to be unique
for conducting polymers and is likely diﬃcult to achieve with inorganic ther-
moelectric materials. Very few studies demonstrate the possibility to create
all-organic TEGs [49]. These devices can operate at modest temperature gradi-
ents and still exhibit power generation suﬃcient for applications in autonomous
microsystems, wireless sensors, or wearable electronics. Hence, we can also
foresee the possibility of creating elastic/ﬂexible polymer-based micro-TEGs
as power source for e-skin. Recently, yet another type of elastic thermoelectric
device has been utilized as sensors for e-skin applications. Carbon aerogels
have recently been suggested as material for resistive pressure sensors [50].
Polyurethane elastic porous scaﬀold coated with PEDOT:PSS resulted in the
ﬁrst dual parameter (pressure and temperature) sensors [51]. This approach
combines the concept of thermoelectricity with a porous elastic system. A
similar approach and application is demonstrated with polymer composite made
of conducting polymer PEDOT:PSS aerogel and silane elastomeric cross-linking
agent (Figure 3.7a) [27]. The electrical resistance versus pressure was measured
for these aerogels (Figure 3.7b). For a very small pressure of <1 kPa, there
was a large drop in the resistance, but for high pressure the resistance was
saturated. Hence, this sensor can be used in applications such as measuring
heart beats or for measuring the touch of a ﬁnger on a keyboard. Note that a
hysteresis is observed upon releasing the pressure, but the resistance comes back
to its original value. The inset of Figure 3.7b shows how the resistance varies
upon several press–release cycles without degradation. Figure 3.7c displays the
response of a sensor made of the Cellulose NanoFibrils-PEDOT:PSS aerogel
sandwiched between two silver coated glass electrodes. When the aerogel was
compressed, its resistance decreased, which is visible as an increase in the slope
of the Ohmic current–voltage (I–V) linear curves as plotted for 2.5, 5, 7.5, and
10 kPa. When a temperature diﬀerence was applied between the electrodes (by
approaching a warm object close to one electrode), a thermovoltage equal to
SΔT was created, which shifted the I–V curves (ΔT = 0, 3.5, 9, 14 ∘C), as in
Figure 3.7c. Hence, such dual-parameter sensors allow decoupling the pressure
and temperature readings in a simple way.
3.7
Conclusions
Despite exciting advances in material science, it is not yet clear how cheap TEGs
must be fabricated to become economically viable. The electricity they generate
should payback the investment made to fabricate and operate the device. A sim-
ple comparison with solar cells shows us the challenge. TEGs require 50 times
more active material than solar cells, while possessing ﬁve times lower eﬃciency.
At present, the ﬁrst organic and carbon-based TEGs provide a power of about
10 μW/cm2, which is three orders of magnitude lower than the power gener-
ated in solar cells. Hopefully, there is plenty of room for improvement for TEGs

3 Organic Thermoelectric Materials
through further optimization of materials and device architectures. The scientiﬁc
and technological challenges of large-area TEGs will not be solved soon. Instead,
one can foresee many niche applications for organic and carbon-based TEGs, cer-
tainly as power source for sensors and more sophisticated devices in the medical,
security, and environmental sectors.
We have summarized how the electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coeﬃcient,
and the thermal conductivity of conducting polymers depend on their oxida-
tion level. The optimum thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit, ZT, for the conducting
polymers PEDOT:Tos reaches a maximum of ZT = 0.1. The world record value
published is ZT = 0.4 at room temperature. The modest heat-to-electricity con-
version of conducting polymers compared to the best inorganic thermoelectric
material (Bi2Te3 with ZT = 1) is only because of their low Seebeck coeﬃcient
(since the ratio of electronic to thermal conductivity is identical). Therefore, the
main challenge for conducting polymer TEGs is to increase the Seebeck coeﬃ-
cient. In that prospect, we have pinpointed the importance of the morphology to
increase the mobility, and at the same time, tune the density of state and enhance
the Seebeck coeﬃcient. Although n-type polymer thermoelectrics are still less
eﬃcient than p-type, there emerge some design rules at the molecular scale to
enhance the doping level while keeping good electron conductivity.
Organic thermoelectrics is still a young ﬁeld of research with exciting promises
because those materials are solution processible at low temperatures, which is
a prerequisite to use low-cost techniques such as printing in order to fabricate
large-area thermoelectric devices. Also, polymers have unique properties
compared to inorganic materials: they are light weight and ﬂexible and can
even be elastics. This again opens up new ﬁelds of research and potential
applications for energy harvesting from the body with ﬂexible TEGs, or dual
temperature/pressure sensors for electronic skin.

Introduction
4.1.1
Silicon as a Thermoelectric Material
Last two decades have seen a remarkable return of interest toward thermoelec-
tricity as a tool to recover and partially convert into electricity low-temperature
waste heat. Speciﬁcally, microharvesting, namely thermal harvesting aimed
at the local generation of high added-value, small electric powers, has raised
a wide interest, also in connection with the development and deployment of
distributed, intercommunicating wireless sensor networks. Nanotechnology has
actually had a fantastic impact onto the conversion rate that can be achieved
by thermoelectric generators (TEGs) [1], with thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit
grown up by almost a factor three over less than 15 years. Such a tremendous
result was due both to novel classes of thermoelectric materials but also to
old materials that rejuvenated by nanostructuring. Nanowires and nanolayers,
along with multi-layered structures, have actually improved the thermoelectric
characteristics of many age-old materials [2–4] by either enabling the reduction
of their thermal conductivity 𝜅or by increasing their power factor (PF) 𝜎S2
(where 𝜎is the electrical conductivity and S is the Seebeck coeﬃcient). Both
approaches clearly lead to an increase of the thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit
ZT = 𝜎S2T/𝜅(where T is the absolute temperature), although their impact on
device power output is not equivalent [5].
As thermoelectric performances have remarkably enhanced, bringing TEGs
at the wedge of bulk production, attention has extended to selecting materials
and technologies that could be eﬀectively and economically scaled up. As a
consequence, geo-abundance and low material costs have added up as major
technological constraints to the development of thermoelectric materials and
devices. Thus, the revamped interest toward silicon, silicon–germanium alloys,
and silicides has come to no surprise, as the surge of scientiﬁc publications on
this speciﬁc subject over the last ﬁve years has shown up.

4 Silicon for Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting Applications
In the history of nanostructured thermoelectric silicon a milestone was
surely set at 2008, when Nature published back-to-back two seminal papers by
Hochbaum et al. [6] and by Boukai et al. [7] on silicon nanowires (SiNWs). In
both papers, the authors independently demonstrated that phonon scattering
at the outer roughened walls of SiNWs causes the thermal conductance of
single-crystalline silicon (scSi) to drop by almost a factor 100, with only a
marginal impact onto scSi electrical conductivity. Since then the nanowire
paradigm has been extended to a host of other materials, 1D nanostruc-
tures becoming a reference for thermoelectricity [8, 9]. At the same time a
remarkable eﬀort has been placed on devising novel approaches to manu-
facturing nanowires, especially for silicon, where microelectronic technology
sets a natural standard to fulﬁll so as to enable easy upscale [10–12]. Also
nanolayers have shown signiﬁcant potentials for the reduction of silicon thermal
conductivity. Exactly as in SiNWs, dimensional constraints by themselves are
not suﬃcient to signiﬁcantly reduce thermal conductivity in 2D, and an accurate
control over surface roughness is required [13, 14].
Top-down approach is not unique, however. Nanocrystallinity and second-
phase formation also provide an interesting toolbox to improve Si thermoelectric
properties, with the additional advantage of lower production costs and of larger
input heat currents. Use of SiOx precipitates [15] and of nanovoids [16] has been
explored. The aim is that of selectively reducing 𝜅over 𝜎.
Although most of the research till recent times has focused on strategies to
decrease 𝜅, dimensionally constrained nanostructures may also increase silicon
PF. The eﬀect of nanosizing on the PF has been explored both theoretically and
experimentally by several authors [17, 18]. Although results are less ﬁnal, they
clearly show an alternate, possibly complementary way to increase Si thermo-
electric eﬃciency.
In this chapter, all approaches will be critically reviewed. Special emphasis will
be placed on the interplay between preparation methodology and thermoelectric
performances, as the former rules critical characteristics of the nanostructure
that are nowadays clearly known to be in control of the transport properties of the
material. In the second part of the chapter usability and applications of Si nano-
structures will be discussed, also providing an outlook to frontiers in research
and development of dimensionally constrained silicon for thermoelectricity.
4.1.2
Current Uses of Silicon in TEGs
The use of silicon as a thermoelectric material in TEGs has been already proposed
in the early 2000, both in bulk and thin ﬁlm form [19–28]. Despite the very low
thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit of bulk silicon and silicon ﬁlms, both in polysilicon
and single-crystal silicon form, silicon-based TEG devices have been developed
to fully exploit the potential of highly advanced silicon micromachining tech-
nology. Such advantage was particularly relevant in creating microTEGs for
speciﬁc applications. In some cases, micromachining capabilities could even
allow to integrate the TEG within an electronic application speciﬁc integrated
circuit (ASIC), as proposed in [26], in which a complementary metal–oxide
semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible TEG was used as an on-chip power supply

4.2 Bulk and Thin-Film Silicon

for a CMOS circuit. This is possible for the perfect compatibility of silicon as a
thermoelectric material with microelectronic technology, which is not true for
other thermoelectric materials like tellurides. In such micromachined TEGs,
a planar structure is generally adopted, using essentially the same technology
usually employed for thermoelectric sensors (thermopiles), where use is made of
horizontal thermocouples fabricated over suspended thin dielectric membranes
and therefore thermally isolated from the underlying silicon substrate. Such
arrangement and the need to use thin ﬁlms for processing requirements made
these devices not optimized for thermoelectric conversion, compared to other
structures based on bulk thermoelectric materials. Moreover, microTEGs
often employed standard CMOS polysilicon ﬁlms as thermoelectric material.
This was mainly motivated by compatibility with assessed CMOS fabrication
processes, although this choice was clearly not ideal for the performances of the
thermoelectric conversion. In addition, in some cases only one doping type was
available and plain n-type polysilicon/metal thermocouples were the only option
for the device.
In order to overcome such limitations, some attempts to adapt silicon
technology to a vertical thermocouple arrangement of bulk thermocouples
have been proposed. In [19], for instance, a TEG based on vertically arranged
single-crystal silicon thermoelements of alternate n and p-type doping was
presented, in which the silicon thermocouples were obtained by high aspect
ratio deep reactive ion etching of massive silicon wafers with an original tech-
nique. The fabrication process presented there ended up with the fabrication
of bulk single-crystal silicon thermocouples that could be used to implement
self-standing vertical arrays of thermoelements for power generation. In this
way, the ﬁnal device could have size comparable to those built with bulk ther-
moelectric materials, since a whole silicon wafer was etched through to make
the silicon thermoelements of the TEG. However, due to the intrinsic limitations
of silicon as a thermoelectric material when used in bulk or thin ﬁlm form, all
the micromachined TEGs based on silicon presented in the literature generally
provided a generated power below 1 μW for the typical temperature diﬀerences
applied, independently of the technology adopted.

4.2.1
Single-Crystalline and Polycrystalline Silicon
It is well known that scSi is a relatively poor material for thermoelectric appli-
cations. Actually, in spite of its large PF, its ZT around room temperature falls
below 0.01 due to its quite large thermal conductivity. Figure 4.1 displays the
Seebeck coeﬃcient versus temperature of p-type and n-type scSi as measured
in the 1950s by Geballe and Hull [29] and more recently re-measured by Stranz
et al. [30, 31]. It was actually shown [32] that the largest PFs are achieved at
carrier densities close or beyond the degeneration threshold (≈1019/cm3), where
the PF may reach values larger than 0.5 mW/m/K2. It is then very unfortunate
that scSi lattice thermal conductivity displays in the same temperature region

very large values (Figure 4.2) therefore severely limiting its overall eﬃciency as
a thermoelectric material.
A rather common way, quite largely explored in the past, to reduce Si 𝜅
was that of introducing both point and extended defects capable of scattering
acoustic phonons. While lattice imperfections were also bound to lower the
carrier mobility, it was found that polycrystallinity succeeded in decreasing
𝜅more than 𝜎, so to improve the material ﬁgure of merit that were reported
to achieve values of 0.023 at 300 K in 42-nm grained polycrystalline silicon
ﬁlms [34]. Clearly enough, such values cannot compete in terms of overall
eﬃciency with standard thermoelectric materials such as Bi2Te3. Nonetheless,
silicon has maintained a non-marginal niche of application in microelectronics,
where the advantages related to its immediate integrability has paved the way
to its exploitation as the reference material for the ﬁrst generation of thermal
microharvesters.

However, the unique capabilities of microfabrication enabled by the use
of silicon in TEGs do not end up with their integrability with signal/power
conditioning electronics. Especially when microharvesters are needed, Si
micromachining and the large toolbox deployable to deﬁne Si structures on the
micron and submicron scale discloses rather unique possibilities to compensate
low conversion eﬃciencies with a wise temperature proﬁling and an eﬀective
thermal management.
In spite of its limited performances, still silicon has found applications in inte-
grated microharvesters where its integrability has prevailed over its fair eﬃciency
[27]. At the same time, strategies were explored to decrease its thermal conduc-
tivity without reducing the electrical conductivity. Among them, the use of SiGe
alloys was found to be successful, improving thermoelectric eﬃciency up to ≈7%
[35]. Germanium alloying favorably impacts on ZT by reducing the thermal con-
ductivity while preserving 𝜎.
Over more recent years the improved understanding of phonon dynamics,
mostly coming from the analysis of heat conduction in nanostructures, has
helped reﬁne strategies to decrease Si thermal conductivity with marginal
impact onto charge carrier mobility. Defect engineering has actually proved to
enable truly low 𝜅to be reachable by the use of selective scattering centers.
Among the strategies to improve the thermoelectric properties of a material,
a very promising and challenging one has been that of selecting structural
defects capable of scattering phonons without reducing electron mobility. While
this approach is actually bound to fail in standard materials, it has proven very
eﬀective at the nanoscale. The basic idea has been that of proﬁting of the diﬀerent
wavelengths 𝜆of conduction electrons and of acoustic phonons. Centers with
characteristic size intermediate between the wavelengths of electrons and
phonons might incoherently scatter phonons (then reducing their lifetime)
while reﬂecting electrons, thus preserving their mean free path (MFP). Typical
sizes of selective scattering objects in silicon are expected to be in the range
10–100 nm, that is, the standard size of nanoprecipitates (NPs) and of grains
in nanocrystalline materials [36]. Proper size is however only one ingredient of

60
4 Silicon for Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting Applications
the recipe. Two other factors actually rule the selectivity of scattering objects.
On one side, the potential landscape experienced by electrons upon scattering
must be conveniently shaped so that carriers may either tunnel through them
or, less commonly, thermally overcome them (by thermionic emission). It may
be shown that in nanocomposites barrier heights and widths are correlated to
the Fermi energies of the two phases, while they depend upon the grain size
and on the density of surface states at nanograin boundaries in single-phase
nanocrystalline solids [37]. On the other side, a multi-scaled size distribution
of nano-objects is desirable. Actually, the spectral thermal conductivity 𝜅′(𝜔)
displays large contributions over a wide range of phonon frequencies. As an a
example, it has been quite recently demonstrated that heat transport above room
temperature signiﬁcantly involves phonon modes of very long wavelengths (of
some micrometers and more) [38]. As a result, eﬀective reduction of 𝜅requires
silencing phonons modes extending over an extended range of wavelengths. No
single defect, no matter how engineered, may be eﬀective enough. This implies
the need of introducing collections of (multi-scaled) scattering centers aimed at
hindering phonon diﬀusion over length scales from 10 nm to 10 μm [39].
4.2.2
Degenerate and Phase-Segregated Silicon
Non-dimensionally constrained silicon is not however bound to low ZT values,
as long as silicon acts as an embedding matrix for nanocomposites. The eﬀect of
precipitates in silicon was recently reviewed by Narducci et al. [40]. Manifestly
enough, the simple introduction of grain boundaries (GBs) may be expected to
lead to a degradation of both the thermal and electrical conductivities, with little
or no advantage as of the thermoelectric eﬃciency. This was widely conﬁrmed in
non-degenerate polycrystalline silicon, namely for doping levels up to 1018/cm3
[41]. However, already in 1988 Vining had shown that the thermoelectric
properties of heavily boron-doped nanocrystalline silicon (ncSi) may display an
unprecedented improvement of ZT upon precipitation of SiB3 [42], leading to
an unexpected increase of hole mobility [32]. The electrical conductivity and
the Seebeck coeﬃcient measured in ncSi pellets obtained by hot-pressing at
1250 ∘C display anomalies, with the thermopower increasing with the boron
concentration between 1.0% at. and 20% at. Vining speculated that a second
phase with larger Seebeck coeﬃcient could be held responsible for the enhanced
S, although this was conﬂicting with the carrier density getting to a maximum
for a boron density of 10% at. (Figure 4.3). Also, anomalously high hole mobility
was measured, ranging around 35 cm2/V/s at 300 K. In principle high mobility is
consistent with potential barriers at GB that, because of the high doping levels,
may be tunnelled through [43].
Concurrent increase of the electrical conductivity and of the Seebeck coef-
ﬁcient in highly boron-doped ncSi was discussed by Narducci et al. [44, 45].
In silicon thin ﬁlms doped with a boron concentration of 0.9% mol. and with
columnar nanograins with an in-plane size of ≈50 nm annealing up to 1000 ∘C
resulted in the doubling of the electrical conductivity while the Seebeck coeﬃ-
cient was also unexpectedly found to increase from 0.10 to 0.45 mV/K. A PF of

13 mW/K2/m was attained, with hole mobility at 300 K of 79 cm2/V/s [44, 46]
(Figure 4.4). PFs were then more than 6 times larger than those observed in
comparably doped single-crystal silicon, and almost 25 times larger than in
nanostructured silicon [47]. Further increase of the PF and of the hole mobility
was observed for larger nominal boron concentrations [48]. The dependence of
the carrier density upon the annealing temperature could be correlated to the
precipitation of boron-enriched Si—B second phases at ncSi GBs [48, 49].

(TEM) evidence that sintering had led to the precipitation of an amorphous
phase. Interestingly, annealing of n-type samples led to an initial decrease of the
electrical conductivity, with a minimum at 700 ∘C, followed by a recovery for
higher annealing temperatures. PFs reached ≈4.5 mW/K2/m at 1000 ∘C while
electron Hall mobility at room temperature was found to account to 61 cm2/V/s.
Further claims of high PFs (≈4.4 mW/K2/m at 800 ∘C) were reported by Kurosaki
and collaborators [50]. Nanometric precipitates of a SiPx second phases were
observed in heavily phosphorus-doped Si pellets obtained by SPS. Structural
(semi)coherence with the embedding microcrystalline silicon matrix led to a
reduction of the thermal conductivity but also to an increase of the PF, both
concurring to relatively large ZT values.
An analysis of the physics behind the anomalous increase of the PF is beyond
the goals of this chapter. Suﬃce here to say that a simple picture where potential
barriers at GBs may be invoked as responsible for an increase of the PF is not
consistent with the complex experimental set of data available even only for ncSi.
Also from a theoretical point of view it was shown that GBs alone cannot justify
an enhancement of the PF [51]. A more sophisticated conceptual framework
must be developed, instead. Actually, GBs and precipitates may ﬁlter low-energy
(cold) carriers, thus decreasing the density of non-localized electrons (holes)
that sets the Seebeck coeﬃcient in n-type (p-type) silicon. However, electron
(hole) mobility also depends on their lifetime or, equivalently, on their MFP.
Actually, high-energy (hot) carriers are scattered by electron–electron and
electron–phonon interactions more eﬃciently than low-energy carriers, so that
their spectral mobility 𝜇(E) is not necessarily larger. Furthermore, a mechanism
must be available to thermalize the carriers, which is not unescapably the case
when carriers travel ballistically instead than diﬀusively through the medium.
Overall, the coexistence of more processes must be considered, as reported in
recent studies [40, 52, 53]. Conversely, it might be noteworthy to mention that
an increase of the PF and of ZT in nanocomposite does not contrast with the
so-called Bergman–Lévy limit [54, 55]. In a series of papers, Bergman and Lévy
rigorously demonstrated that in a binary composite the ﬁgure of merit may never
exceed that of the component with the largest ZT. Actually, while no limitation
applies to the PF [56], even for ZT the Bergman–Lévy limit could be proved only
neglecting all interface contributions. Thus, limits hold true only when dealing
with strictly mechanical mixtures of two phases. Such a picture may be adequate
for macroscopic composites (mixtures) but it is clearly not appropriate with
nanocomposites. Speciﬁcally, in ncSi embedding nanometric second phases the
role of interfaces (and of the associated potential barriers) is essential, so one has
not to invoke a second phase with large ZT to explain unexpectedly large ﬁgures
of merit.
As a general conclusion, while dimensional constrains, which will be analyzed
in the forthcoming sections, have paved an eﬀective and validated way to
use silicon in thermoelectrics, research on bulk silicon as a thermoelectric
material still retains a substantial interest. Single-crystalline silicon has found
uses in TEGs mostly due to its immediate integrability. However it would be
of little surprise that the intrinsically modest thermoelectric eﬃciencies of
silicon and of related bottom-up nanocomposites could be enhanced by clever

4.3.1
Introduction
Thermoelectric performance of a material depends mainly on three intrinsic
parameters, that is, Seebeck coeﬃcient, electrical conductivity, and thermal
conductivity. As mentioned, these parameters are included in the ﬁgure of
merit ZT that is directly related with the maximum conversion eﬃciency
that can be achieved. In bulk materials S, 𝜎, and 𝜅e are linked, and thus they
cannot be tailored independently. In this section, we will analyze the eﬀects
that nanostructuring can produce on the properties of silicon based materials.
Two strategies can be adopted to increase the ﬁgure of merit. A ﬁrst approach
is to maximize the PF. Although some possibilities are presented in theory and
despite the intensive research in the last decades, it was already noted how only
few signiﬁcant ZT improvements have been reported so far due to enhance-
ments of the PF resulting from the formation of nanostructures. However,
the deﬁnition of the inﬂuence of low dimensionality in the charge transport is
important as it provides tools for the optimization of the thermoelectric devices
and its matching to the most suitable working temperature. In contrast, big
improvements have been obtained thanks to a drop of thermal conductivity in
nanoscaled systems. In this second strategy, a reduction of the dimensions or the
introduction of nanometric defects can lead to an important phonon scattering
that causes a decrease of the thermal conductivity without any major detriment
of the electrical conductivity.
4.3.2
Electrical Transport in Nanostructured Thermoelectric Materials
Among the quantities deﬁning the PF, those involving electronic diﬀusion can
be derived from the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), which describes the
evolution of particle distribution f in a system under a perturbation (in this case
electric ﬁeld and temperature):
(df
dt
)
SC
= df
dt + dk
dt ∇k f + dr
dt ∇r f
(4.1)
where k is the particle momentum and the subscript SC labels the scattering-
equilibrated distribution. In order to solve Eq. (4.1) we assume that electrons
equilibrate due to the eﬀect of random scattering. Thus, we introduce a relaxation
time (𝜏) deﬁned as df ∕dt = ( f −f0)∕𝜏(where f 0 is the equilibrium distribution).
A detailed analysis of the equation is out of the scope of this chapter and can
be found elsewhere [57–59]. Provided that electron distribution at equilibrium
follows Fermi Dirac statistics and using suitable approximations one obtains that

energy.
Now we can express the diﬀerent quantities in ZT using the explicit form of
Eq. (4.11). Let us ﬁrst pay attention to the electrical conductivity (Eq. (4.2)). This
quantity will increase when the charge carrier density or the carrier mobility
increase, as 𝜎= ne𝜇. The analysis of the dependency of mobility upon the car-
rier density can be found elsewhere [60]. Regarding charge carrier density, it can
be written as

Thus the carrier density increases as a is reduced, being this change more pro-
nounce for low dimension systems. Another factor clearly inﬂuencing the num-
ber of charge carriers is 𝜂. This parameter is deeply dependent on the material
band structure and in some cases on temperature.
The second factor that contributes to the ﬁgure of merit is the electronic ther-
mal conductivity. This parameter is essentially related to the electrical conduc-
tivity, having likely dependence on n and 𝜇. Indeed, 𝜎and 𝜅e are linked through
the Lorentz number L
𝜅e = 𝜎LT ;

Thus, |S| decreases by increasing 𝜂. As of the evolution of |S| with temperature,
the variation in the Fermi energy has to be taken into consideration. In doped
silicon, the carrier concentration is stable in a certain range of temperatures and
is set by the doping. Nevertheless, in this case the Fermi energy decreases with
T and then |S| is enhanced. In the case of intrinsic silicon (or in doped silicon

66

at suﬃciently high temperatures) |S| will decrease as a result of the contribution
to the Seebeck coeﬃcient by carriers of opposed sign (compensation in the
bipolar regime).
4.3.3
Phonon Transport in Nanostructured Thermoelectric Materials
The total thermal conductivity of a material is the sum of charge carriers (𝜅e)
and lattice (𝜅L) thermal conductivity. The latter normally represents the major
contribution and then the biggest impact in the ﬁgure of merit.
The so-called semi-classical theory is derived from the assumption that we con-
sider the system as a gas of non-interacting particles. In this case we obtain that
𝜅L = CLvl, where CL is the thermal capacity, v = dr∕dt is the average phonon
velocity and l is the phonon mean free path. Then, the key to decrease thermal
conductivity is to reduce any of the three factors, that is, the CL, v, and l.
We can use again Boltzmann transport equation (4.1) but considering the
wave and position vector of phonons instead of electrons. In this case, f is the
Bose–Einstein distribution function instead of the Fermi–Dirac distribution
function. With these considerations, if gp is the phonon DOS
CL = dU
dT =
d∫fpE(k)gp(E)dE
dT
(4.15)
The previous equations are valid under the assumption of non-interacting
particles. One can include the harmonic interaction between nearest neighbors
by introducing the phonon group velocity v = d𝜔∕dt, where 𝜔is the phonon
frequency, 𝜔=
√
(4K)∕m sin(ka0∕2), and K is a term accounting for the
strength of the interaction and a0 is the distance between atoms. For silicon,
v ≈9 × 103 m/s. For every k value both low energy (acoustic) and high energy
(optical) phonon modes are found. Acoustic phonons account for the inter-unit
lattice cell response to external stimuli (e.g., temperature variations or electric
ﬁelds). Instead, high energy phonons describe intra-cell interactions.
The most usual approach for the reduction of 𝜅L by nanostructuring is the
reduction of the mean free path of phonons that is related to the phonon wave-
lengths. As will be shown in next sections, the generation of structures like SiNW
with dimensions smaller than the wavelength of part of the phonons involved in
the heat transport has proven to drastically reduce the heat conduction of bulk
material.

Bottom-Up Nanowires
4.4.1
Preparation Strategies
The bottom-up approach for SiNWs fabrication consists in the addition of silicon
atoms to form long one-dimensional crystalline structures with diameters going
from a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers. The arrangement of atoms
needed to provide a crystalline growth requires a reversible path between the
liquid or gas phase containing the precursor and the solid substrate. Usually,

catalytic particles are distributed on the surface acting as seeds or growth nuclei.
Most frequently, the nanowires grow through the so-called vapor–liquid–solid
(VLS) mechanism (Figure 4.5). It was deﬁned and reported for the ﬁrst time by
Wagner and Ellis in 1963 [61] and was intensively studied in the following years
[62, 63]. The metal particle present on the surface alloys with silicon, becoming
liquid at the process temperature. Then, a gas is introduced in the surrounding
atmosphere that contains a silicon precursor (commonly SiH4 or SiCl4). This pre-
cursor is adsorbed and dissociated at the catalyst surface and Si is incorporated
into the droplet. A supersaturation in the liquid alloy leads to the precipitation of
silicon in the liquid droplet–solid silicon interface. This process continues, pro-
ducing the growth of crystalline silicon below the droplet and the generation of
a nanowire.
In a likely way, nanowires can be obtained by means of the so-called vapor–
solid–solid (VSS) mechanism. In this case, the metal particle catalyzing the pre-
cursor decomposition on the substrate surface does not melt or form a liquid
alloy. High enough surface or bulk mobilities are required that allow Si atoms to
migrate to the precursor–substrate interface.
In the following, a short description of some of the most common techniques
accessible for the growth of SiNW is presented.
4.4.2
Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique is the most popular route to obtain
bottom-up SiNWs due to its scalability, its capability to generate high aspect ratio
structures with selectable dimensions and doping, and the possibility of selecting
the regions where the growth takes place. This technique was initially developed
for the fabrication of thin ﬁlms. Its use for SiNWs requires the introduction of
some mechanisms to block direct silicon growth on the sample and restrict the
deposition to the metal regions. A large collection of CVD variants exist, that
diﬀerentiate on parameters like pressure, temperature, and the mechanisms that
can aid the decomposition of the precursor gas in the surface. Very frequently,
low pressure is used, among other reasons, to prevent the oxidation of the silicon
surface and the metal precursors. In this situation, the technique is denoted as
low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD).
The temperature needed to trigger the precursor decomposition process
strongly depends on the gas used and on the ability of the metal to catalyze
the reaction. When using liquid SiCl4, the required temperature is higher than

68
4 Silicon for Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting Applications
for gaseous precursors like SiH4 and Si2H6. Process temperatures typically of
800–1000 ∘C are needed for growing SiNWs with SiCl4 [64, 65], while a range
from 350 to 700 ∘C is used for SiH4 or Si2H6 [66–70].
Another variant of this technique is the so called plasma enhanced vapor
deposition (PECVD). In conventional CVD growth processes, the dissocia-
tion of the precursor molecule is often considered as the rate limiting step.
Temperature and the ability of the catalyst to dissociate the precursor are key
factors for the NWs growth. With the assistance of plasma, the gaseous species
are pre-dissociated in the atmosphere, so a broader range of catalysts can be
used and the temperature can be reduced [71–73]. An inconvenience of this
approach is the formation of parasitic deposition of amorphous silicon that
can hinder some practical applications. Together with the versatility of CVD to
produce SiNWs with selected lengths and diameters at diﬀerent temperatures
and pressures, the technique holds other convenient beneﬁts. An essential
advantage is the possibility to introduce a dopant gas precursor in a controlled
way during the structure self-assembly. PH3 and B2H6 are the gases most often
used to produce n and p doped nanowires, respectively. As a counterpart, in
situ doping can hinder the directional growth of the nanowires, mostly for the
structures with diameters below 50 nm [74, 75]. Also, high doping levels are
diﬃcult to achieve due to unwanted gas phase decomposition of the dopant
precursor gas during the growth process [76].
4.4.3
Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE)
As in the case of CVD, also molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a classical tech-
nique used to deposit high quality layers. The extension to the fabrication of
one-dimensional nanostructures was done after observing that metal impurities
initiated the generation of nanowires. In this route, a silicon source is heated
in high vacuum up to evaporation, providing a gaseous beam of Si atoms. The
as-generated gas reaches the surface of the substrate where metal particles initi-
ate the growth via the previously described VLS mechanism. In this case, how-
ever, the metal does not act as a dissociating agent for the precursor but promotes
the growth by forming an alloy with the semiconductor. MBE oﬀers excellent
control over the synthetic conditions, allowing, for example, the fabrication of
heterostructures with abrupt interfaces. MBE also presents a very good control
on the generated nanowires in terms of crystallinity and doping [77–79]. As a
counterpart, growth rates are very low and it is not possible to generate structures
with a radius less than 40 nm.
4.4.4
Laser Ablation
A diﬀerent way to achieve the production of SiNW is by means of a laser irradiat-
ing a target consisting of a mixture of Si and the catalyst −that are therefore sub-
mitted to elevated temperatures. A ﬂow of inert gas is introduced in the system
during the process. The collision with the gas particles cools the ablated mate-
rial, causing the growth of nanowires on a substrate that is not necessarily silicon,
provided that metal particles remain liquid. The diameter and length of the result-
ing nanowires is not as easily tunable as in the case of CVD, since these factors

4.4 Bottom-Up Nanowires
69
depend on the catalytic material and on the gas used. On the other side, the tech-
nique allows to grow long SiNWs in short times, with rates of some micrometers
per minute. The high temperature involved can be a limitation for its use with
some substrates, but it also allows to use materials with high eutectic tempera-
tures [80, 81]. This method presents some capabilities that are inaccessible for a
typical CVD, as the possibility of ablating chemicals that are to be incorporated
in the NW. A clear disadvantage compared to other techniques is instead the
requirement of complex and expensive equipment.
4.4.5
Solution-Based Techniques
The growth in a liquid environment is the most cost-eﬀective method among
those existing for producing SiNWs. The techniques encompass the so-called
solution–liquid–solid (SLS) and the supercritical-ﬂuid–liquid–solid (SFLS) pro-
cesses. In its former version, an organic solvent dissolving the silicon precursor
is used. In the latter, a supercritical organic ﬂuid containing the silicon precursor
at high pressure is put in contact with a substrate containing the metal catalyst.
As for the VLS, the substrate is submitted to a high enough temperature to pro-
duce the generation of a liquid metal–Si alloy. The solution of the precursor and
subsequent saturation take place, leading to the growth of the SiNW [82–84].
4.4.6
Catalyst Materials
One of the most important factors for the fabrication of SiNW is the metal cata-
lyst. This metal has to be selected among those allowing for a stable SiNW growth,
which mainly depends on the material surface tension and on the vapor pres-
sure at the process conditions. On the other side, the process conditions have to
fulﬁll the restrictions imposed by the substrate or the application. The chosen
catalyst directly determines the minimum process temperature for VLS, which
corresponds to the silicon-catalyst eutectic temperature. The phase diagram of
a silicon–metal mixture provides further information concerning the tempera-
ture conditions that must be selected to make the growth feasible and also about
the possibilities and limitations of the resulting nanowires. We can distinguish
three kinds of phase diagrams (Figure 4.6). In the ﬁrst two kinds, a single eutec-
tic point occurs at low temperatures, but in kind A the Si concentration in the
eutectic is above 10%, while in the case B the eutectic is at very low Si concentra-
tions. Type C is characterized by the presence of one or more silicide phases,
with elevated eutectic temperatures. The high solubility of Si implies that the
energy needed to introduce a Si atom in the alloy is low. This facilitates a fast
growth of the nanowires and enables the use of substrates that are sensitive to
high temperatures. Conversely, this can be a disadvantage when trying to gener-
ate multi-material nanowires with sharp interfaces as the silicon already dissolved
in the catalyst droplet precipitates slowly when submitted to a change in the
atmosphere composition. This limitation can be overcome by using materials
from type B phase diagrams, presenting a much smaller buﬀer of dissolved Si.
Unfortunately, this also implies longer growth times.
Another key reason for choosing or discarding a catalyst is that the electric
properties of the wires can be importantly aﬀected by metal traces that remain in

silicon during the growth process. This interaction with silicon is also important
because it can generate incompatibilities with CMOS processes, an important
obstacle to the introduction of the SiNWs growth in industrial microelectronics
facilities. The impact of the presence of impurities on the electric properties of a
silicon crystal depends on how close their ionization energies are to the center of
the Si band gap.
Gold is by far the most frequently used catalyst [85–92]. The main reasons for
this common choice is its high chemical stability, its low eutectic temperature
(363 ∘C), and the possibility of depositing it as thin ﬁlm or from commercial col-
loidal dispersions. Relatively high abundance and non-toxicity are also important
factors. Conversely, Au poses important concerns for applications in Si fabrica-
tion technology. Traces of this metal along the nanowire can negatively aﬀect the
conductivity of the material by introducing charge carrier recombination cen-
ters. Other materials that have been used are copper [93], aluminum [94–96],
silver [97], indium [62, 73, 98], gallium [99], zinc [100, 101], iron [102], platinum
[103], or titanium [104].
4.4.7
Catalyst Deposition Methods
The SiNWs position and diameters will be determined by the growth conditions
and the size of the catalyst. For this reason, the particle deposition methodology
becomes important, mostly when looking at practical applications. In this situ-
ation, the control of the NW features and the selection of the areas where they
have to grow are essential.

4.6 Top-Down Nanowires
71
A very popular way to generate a matrix of metal particles consists in the depo-
sition of a thin ﬁlm on the substrate that is submitted to high temperatures. The
partial melting of the layer or the formation of a liquid alloy leads to a dewetting
process producing nanometric droplets on the surface. Features like size and den-
sity of the particles are to some extent tunable by choosing parameters such as
the layer thickness and the annealing temperature.
A second common approach consists in the use of a colloidal dispersion of
nanoparticles. In this case the distribution of particle sizes can be very narrow
and the concentration sets the number of particles per unit area in the surface.
Although simple and eﬀective for some applications, both the aforementioned
methods lack the capacity of selectively chose the area where the gold has to be
present. In this respect, other techniques like the so called galvanic displacement
enables the deposition to take place only in the areas where silicon is exposed
[105–107].
4.5
Material Properties and Thermoelectric Eﬃciency
As mentioned, decisive experimental evidence of the improvement of ther-
moelectric ﬁgures using SiNWs were published in 2008 by Hochbaum et al.
[6] and Boukai et al. [7]. The experimental demonstration of this decoupling
between thermal and electrical conductivity in one-dimensional structures
stirred research in the ﬁeld. However, only few works have dealt with the study
of nanowires grow with bottom-up techniques. Calaza et al. [108] measured
the thermal properties of arrays formed by p-type Si nanowires with a mean
diameter of 100 nm grown by LPCVD in a platform provided with integrated test
elements (heaters and thermometers). The nanowires presented a very reduced
thermal conductivity, ranging from 2 to 3 W/m/K in a temperature range from
room temperature to 250 ∘C. The lower reduction compared with the top-down
fabricated nanowires reported by Boukai et al. (1.2 W/m/K) could be attributed
to a smaller surface roughness presented by the nanowires grown by VLS.
4.6
Top-Down Nanowires
4.6.1
Preparation Strategies
Top-down SiNWs are generally produced by lithography providing suﬃcient res-
olution to achieve the needed feature size for the wires, which is typically in
the range 30–100 nm. Some suitable techniques to nanolithographically pattern
SiNWs are illustrated in Figure 4.7.
Such nanopatterning techniques are necessary to fully exploit the potential
of SiNWs in thermoelectric conversion, since thermal conductivity signiﬁcantly
decreases only for diameters smaller than 100 nm, particularly for single-crystal
SiNWs in which phonon surface scattering is dominant.
In order to achieve such resolution with aﬀordable costs, excluding the
extremely costly deep-ultra violet (UV) stepper systems employed in nanoelec-
tronics, three main techniques can be considered (Figure 4.7). The ﬁrst one is

electron beam lithography (EBL), in which a focused electron beam is utilized to
pattern an electron-sensitive resist such as poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA).
Thanks to the low wavelength associated to the high-energy electrons of the
beam (with energy in the 10–100 keV range), such patterning can reach the
resolution required for the top-down fabrication of the nanowires. An analogous
technique can be implemented using an ion beam, with potentially even higher
resolution due to the higher energy of ions compared to electrons owing to their
larger mass. Such high energy also allows for direct etching of silicon using a
focused high-energy ion beam (FIB).
Since both ion and electron beam lithography are scanning methods, they are
basically slow. Depending on the patterned area, the required resolution and den-
sity of the pattern, the scanning time may range from a few hours to a few days.
In the latter case the cost will be not aﬀordable for most applications, including
thermoelectric conversion.
A possible way to overcome the problem is using UV-assisted nanoimprint
lithography. This technique is halfway between molding and lithography, since
a stamp is utilized to imprint the desired geometry on a UV-sensitive polymer,
which is then treated by UV exposure before removing the stamp. In the latest
technological developments, such technique is implemented with soft stamps,
made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or other soft polymers with a thin glass
backplate. In this way, the ﬂexible stamps adapt to the substrate, and possibly
embed defects or particles without losing contact with the substrate on a too
large area, thus limiting the yield decrease. Quite evidently, the stamp itself must

4.6 Top-Down Nanowires
73
contain the nanometric geometry needed to fabricate the nanowires and is in
most cases produced by EBL with subsequent plasma etching on silicon or glass
substrates. However, in this case the high fabrication cost is only related to the
master stamp, which can be replicated many times on diﬀerent soft stamps that
in turn can be used to pattern many substrates. Thus, the patterning cost hugely
decreases compared to the cases of direct electron or ion beam lithography on
the pattern of interest.
Following the nanolithographic step, all methods (except direct FIB etching)
require a pattern transfer on the active material, namely silicon in our case, either
single-crystalline or polycrystalline (Figure 4.8).
First, the nanowire geometry, created on some kind of photoresist or imprint
polymer, needs to be transferred to the silicon layer utilized to obtain the
nanowires. This is typically done by anisotropic etching such as reactive ion
etching (RIE), which can be generally performed on the thin layers used for the
nanowires by directly using photoresist as a RIE mask (step 1). In performing
RIE, a plasma recipe with suﬃcient anisotropy must be adopted since even a
small under-etching of the mask would be suﬃcient to destroy the nanowire,
particularly if small diameters are designed on the pattern. To this purpose,
traditional capacitively coupled (CC) etching systems are often preferred to
high density plasma such as inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs) for their slower
etching rate (in the range 10–100 nm/min), allowing for a better control of
the etching process. Another important issue is the availability of an etch-stop
material (such as SiO2) under the silicon layer used as a starting point to
pattern the nanowires. Most of the CC RIE etching processes potentially
usable to perform an etching based pattern transfer in top-down Si nanowire
fabrication make use of chlorine or ﬂuorine-based chemicals (such as SiCl4 or
CF4) and are much slower on dielectrics such as SiO2 or Si3N4 than on silicon.
Thus, these materials can be eﬀectively used as etch-stop layers underneath
the nanowires.

4 Silicon for Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting Applications
Once the geometry of the nanowires in silicon is deﬁned by RIE etching, the
fabrication generally requires some additional step to integrate the nanowires
in the TEG device in an eﬀective way. The ﬁrst thing that is always needed is
some electrical passivation of the nanowires, which can be obtained by depositing
a dielectric material over them (step 2 in Figure 4.8). To this purpose, a typi-
cally chosen material is SiO2 deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposi-
tion (LPCVD) from SiH4 and oxygen (at 400 ∘C) or from tetraethyl-orthosilicate
(TEOS) at 800 ∘C. In both cases, a pinhole-free, conformal layer is obtained that
electrically passivates the nanowires and protects them from the inﬂuence of the
external environment. SiO2 has also a very low thermal conductivity (in the order
of 1 W/m/K) and therefore does not aﬀect the thermoelectric eﬃciency of the
nanowire arrays in the TEG.
After passivation, metal contacts to the nanowire are also necessary to create
the thermocouples in the TEG and to connect the device to the external readout
circuitry through bonding pads. To do that, the passivation layer must be selec-
tively removed from the contact region over the nanowires (step 3 in Figure 4.8)
using a purposely designed pattern on photoresist by conventional lithography.
SiO2 etching in this case can be performed either by wet or RIE processes to
uncover the surface of the nanowires that have to be contacted. Afterwards (steps
4 and 5), a metal layer is deposited on the sample and subsequently patterned to
create the metal connections. A good choice for the metal layer can be an alloy
of aluminum and silicon (typically with silicon-to-aluminum ratios between 1%
and 2%), that can be annealed to improve the contact resistance of the metal/Si
nanowire interface at 400 ∘C without excessive silicon diﬀusion in the Al layer.
After metal etching, the thermocouples are deﬁned and the TEG device is in
principle ready to operate. It must be said, however, that some kind of micro-
machining of the massive silicon substrate is often adopted in fabricating the
TEG to improve the thermal isolation of the nanostructured thermocouples and
consequently enhance the device performance. Such micromachining step can
be straightforwardly executed once the nanowires are completely passivated by
SiO2 using, for example, some SiO2-selective anisotropic silicon etchant such as
tetra-methyl-ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) after patterning a suitable geome-
try over the SiO2 passivation on the front side of the sample (step 7 of Figure 4.8).
TMAH can also be made selective to aluminum by adding ammonium peroxy-
disulfate and silicon powder or silicic acid. Other possible options are isotropic
silicon etching by SF6 plasma from the front side or backside pass-through micro-
machining by TMAH or deep-reactive ion etching (DRIE) of silicon.
The basic technique described in Figures 4.7 and 4.8 has a severe limitation
since it allows obtaining just one layer of nanowires. This is not ideal for the TEG
application since the number of nanowires per unit length on the nanostructured
thermoelement is a key point for eﬃciency and should be in principle larger than
the one obtainable with one level of nanowires. A possible technique to improve
the linear density of the nanowires in top-down technology has been proposed
in [109] and is here schematically illustrated in Figure 4.9.
With this technique, the nanowires are fabricated starting from a mould
obtained with a stack of SiO2 and Si3N4 layers on which a nanolithographic

pattern is deﬁned by RIE etching (steps 1 and 2 in Figure 4.9). Afterwards, an
isotropic wet SiO2 etching is utilized to create recesses on the patterned stack
(step 3) that are subsequently ﬁlled by a polysilicon deposition performed by
LPCVD (step 4). RIE polysilicon etching is ﬁnally employed to eliminate the
excess of deposited polysilicon and to obtain the nanowires within the SiO2
recesses (step 5). In this way, many nanowire layers can be potentially fabricated
by increasing the height of the SiO2/Si3N4 stack, signiﬁcantly increasing the
linear density of nanowires within the nanostructured thermoelements beyond
the intrinsic limitations of the one-level fabrication illustrated in Figure 4.8.
4.6.2
Material Properties and Thermoelectric Eﬃciency
The thermoelectric properties of top-down fabricated SiNWs are in any respect
similar to those obtained by bottom-up growth. However, some important dif-
ferences may arise depending on the crystal texture of the nanowires. This is
particularly relevant in top-down fabrication since in this case the nanowires can
be either single-crystal or polycrystalline, depending on the preparation method.
Bottom-up grown nanowires, on the contrary, are generally single-crystal.
Crystal texture aﬀects both the electrical and thermal properties of the
nanowires. Thermal conductivity in polycrystalline SiNWs is inﬂuenced by the
presence of GBs, which give rise to additional phonon scattering with respect to
lattice or impurity phonon scattering. As a consequence, polycrystalline SiNWs
typically present a much lower thermal conductivity compared to single-crystal
nanowires with similar size. Moreover, the type of doping used in the polycrys-
talline SiNWs is also inﬂuential because it can promote or inhibit the growth
of grains within the nanowires during the thermal annealing steps required for
doping activation. In particular, two of the most widely used dopant species for
silicon, boron, and phosphorus, present opposite eﬀects on grain growth during
thermal annealing of the nanowires, since phosphorus enhances the growth of
the grains while boron inhibits it. As a result, the crystal texture of boron-doped
polycrystalline nanowires is typically much ﬁner than that of phosphorus-doped
ones, and their thermal conductivity is consequently lower.
In polycrystalline nanowires, actually, the eﬀect of GBs acts in combination
with phonon surface scattering on the wires, giving rise to very low thermal
conductivity values even for nanowires with diameter in the range of 100 nm.

76
4 Silicon for Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting Applications
Typically, the values obtained on nanowires with cross-section in the order of
100 × 100 nm2 on heavily doped polycrystalline SiNWs are around 2–3 W/m/K
for boron-doped nanowires and 4–5 W/m/K for phosphorus-doped nanowires
[14]. Single-crystal nanowires of comparable cross section and doping, diﬀer-
ently than the polycrystalline ones, would present a thermal conductivity around
60–70 W/m/K. This is in principle an advantage that the use of polycrystalline
SiNWs presents, and that is closely related to top-down fabrication, since
bottom-up growth of polycrystalline SiNWs is not easily achievable. However, it
must be said that the polycrystalline texture also presents some disadvantages
when the electrical properties are considered.
In fact, the doping of the nanowires is normally chosen in order to maximize
the PF 𝜎S2. Now, in both poly- and single-crystal silicon (either in nanowire of in
ﬁlm form), the doping level c aﬀects S and 𝜎in a very diﬀerent way. Even though
the absolute Seebeck coeﬃcient S is not easy to model analytically, particularly
in the high doping range, its variation is logarithmic with 1/c [29], becoming
proportional to c−2/3 only at very high doping levels. Electrical conductivity, on
the contrary, is almost proportional to c, even though electrical mobility is very
diﬀerent for low and high doping ranges due to ionized impurity scattering in
heavily doped silicon. This means that, generally speaking, by increasing the sil-
icon doping level the PF can be improved since the decrease of S2 is generally
much lower than that simultaneously induced on 1/𝜎. As a result, in TEGs the
doping of the nanowires is often pushed to the maximum possible level, which
is actually bounded by physical limitations related to the activation of the dop-
ing species in silicon. Since, in fact, the dopant atoms must be substitutional in
the crystal lattice to give rise to a free carrier, the ﬁrst requirement to be fulﬁlled
for doping activation is that the doping species has to be in solid solution within
silicon at the annealing temperature, and not in a precipitate form. At the maxi-
mum allowed annealing temperature for silicon (1100 ∘C), the solid solubility of
the most common dopant species for silicon (boron, phosphorus, and arsenic) is
slightly above 1020/cm3.
In polycrystalline SiNWs, doping activation is also inﬂuenced by the presence
of GBs, which are amorphous and consequently prevent the activation of the
dopant atoms that segregate there. This eﬀect is particularly important in
boron-doped polysilicon since boron segregates preferably within GBs, and
this causes a doping depletion within the grain, which is responsible for a
resistivity increase. That is the reason why electrical resistivity in boron-doped
polycrystalline SiNWs cannot be typically decreased below 6 × 10−3 Ω cm.
Phosphorus, on the contrary, preferably segregates on the inner side of the
grains and consequently a much better doping activation can be reached, with
electrical resistivity in the order of 10−3 Ω cm. As a result, despite the very
low thermal conductivity, the thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit of polycrystalline
SiNWs at 300 K is lower than in single-crystal SiNWs with very small diameters
(20–30 nm), mainly because of their worse electrical properties. However, this
disadvantage in TEG devices can be partly compensated by the fact that high
diameters can be adopted in polycrystalline nanowires without degrading too
much their ﬁgure of merit. This is not the case for single-crystal SiNWs, instead.

4.7
Applications of Bulk and Thin-Film Silicon and SiGe
Alloys to Energy Harvesting
Very few are the applications of silicon itself as a thermoelectric material as of
its low ZT. However, its alloys with Ge (meant to decrease its thermal conduc-
tivity) have been (and still are, to a large extent) the reference material for many
key applications of thermoelectricity. On one side, SiGe thin ﬁlms provide ways
of easy on-chip integration of a TEG. On the other hand, Si—Ge alloys have
been extensively used as massive legs in radioisotope thermoelectric generators
(RTGs) to power deep-space probes. In this case, SiGe alloys have been the nat-
ural choice as no mature materials able to sustain the high temperatures typical
of this class of TEGs were available in the 1970s.
Focusing onto integrated applications, most of the reported research has been
aimed at developing TEG designs that coped with the relatively high thermal
conductivity of the material to compensate for the relatively low conversion eﬃ-
ciency. Achieving large heat currents and minimal thermal shunts could actually
make output power densities competitive with those obtainable with high-ZT
standards. A good example of such an approach comes from a series of papers
published by the Inﬁneon Labs over the ﬁrst years of 2000. The major problem
with integrated TEGs is actually that of forcing the heat ﬂow through planar
elements that are oriented normal to the thermal gradient. Decoupling the ther-
mal vias from the (bulk) substrate could be achieved by opening cavities under
the TEG elements (Figure 4.10) [27]. In this way the wafer could be used as the
thermal contact to the heat sink. This, coupled with a proper choice of the dop-
ing level of the substrate, allowed to minimize the otherwise large reduction of
the temperature diﬀerence actually applied over the thermoelectric legs. For a
front-to-back ΔT of 3 K an actual temperature drop of 1.7 K was estimated to

occur over the thermoelectric leg. In addition, the reduced thermal shunt enabled
a relatively large heat ﬂow through the device legs that compensated for the low
ZT and the small ΔT (that further reduced the conversion eﬃciency), so that an
output power density of ≈5 μW/cm2 could be attained when applying a temper-
ature diﬀerence over the chip as small as 10 K [26, 111].
A diﬀerent design was developed by Xie et al. [110] using a fully CMOS-
compliant fabrication process in a Ge-free thermoelectric device. A double set of
cavities was generated to force heat to ﬂow through p- and n-legs lying parallel to
the substrate. Heat was then injected from the substrate, forced to ﬂow parallel
to it over a membrane sustaining the thermoelectric elements and then dissi-
pated through a vacuum-insulated thermal collector. An output power density of
1.5 μW/cm2 over a ΔT of 5 K was reported, a value mostly limited by the relatively
large electrical resistance associated to the micrometric size of the contact pads.
Use of suspended legs in microharvesters was proposed by Leonov and
coworkers at IMEC [112]. Hole- and electron-doped SiGe ﬁlms were deposited
onto sacriﬁcial trapezoidal SiO2 blocks that were shaped by using a photoresist
mask with variable thickness along with a focus energy matrix [113]. Beveled
walls helped deposit the active layers. At the process end, SiO2 blocks were
wet-etched away leaving an Al-contacted p–n series the hot side of which
was separated from the substrate by 6 μm. Power density was measured to
be ≈1 μW/cm2 for ΔT = 5 K, mostly limited by local failures (short- and
open-circuits) within the chip.
An even more radical approach to minimize thermal shunts was pursued by
Yu and co-worker [114]. In their layout, thermoelectric legs were bridging fully
separated blocks in a comb structure. After deposition of an interdigitated p–n
Si series (lying ﬂat onto the substrate) the comb was realized by deep RIE from
the back, with the thermoelectric legs lying across the substrate ﬁngers. The tem-
perature diﬀerence could then be applied to the two blocks, ensuring heat to ﬂow
almost entirely through the thermoelectric legs. Since the only possible shunt was
the radiative coupling between the hot and cold blocks, a large thermal current
could be converted into electric power. Also, large temperature diﬀerences could
be applied without losses from direct thermal coupling between the hot and cold
sink. A very large power density of about 100 μW/cm2 for a ΔT of 30 K was mea-
sured, apparently a huge value compared to Leonov’s results of 6.4 μW/cm2 upon
application of the same ΔT.
Beyond the speciﬁc design, use of thermoelectric thin ﬁlms and of planar
technologies unavoidably incurs limitations originating from the large electrical
resistance of the microharvester. Device resistances in excess to 1 MΩ are
common, as a result of the contact resistances at the microscale. Thus, electrical
matching is usually impossible to be achieved when thermal harvesters operates
as power sources for macroscopic sensors or actuators. This obviously implies a
severe reduction of the actual conversion eﬃciency. This simple fact highlights
two basic, interlaced issues. Firstly, integrated thermoelectric harvesters are
naturally meant to be eﬀectively used as power sources for microelectronics, not
as general purpose heat converters. Also the opposite is actually true, namely
that macroscopic (bulk) thermoelectric harvesters may not so conveniently used
to generate electric powers to be delivered to microelectronic components unless

4.8 Applications of Nanostructured Silicon to Energy Harvesting
79
a less-than-optimal power density may be accepted in view of the low power
consumption of the components themselves. This leads to the general conclu-
sion that any direct comparison between the power density achievable with
macroscopic and microscopic harvesters is misleading further than unfair. Planar
thermoelectric converters have therefore a world on itself they qualify for, not
competing with the surely much larger power densities provided by conventional,
non-integrated TEGs. Secondly, in integrated harvesters (possibly more than
in bulk TEGs) side technologies are qualifying parts of the device and module
fabrication. Both thermal and electrical contacts make actually a major diﬀerence
in terms of the TEG real eﬃciency, so that it is highly desirable that thermoelec-
tric research for microharvesting further concentrates its eﬀort onto collateral
aspects of thermoelectric material science ranging from contact metallurgy to
material mechanical properties, then not limiting to enhanced ZT materials.

Applications of Nanostructured Silicon to Energy
Harvesting
4.8.1
Bottom-Up Nanowires
Although enhanced thermoelectric properties of SiNWs have been demon-
strated, the introduction of these structures into a practical device is still
challenging. To avoid power losses it is mandatory an optimal arrangement of
the nanowires between hot and cold sinks, and a perfect electrical connection.
Setting a bridge between nanostructures and macroscopic world requires
precise manufacturing as the one that can be provided by silicon microma-
chining processes. Commonly, top-down platforms embedding bottom-up
NWs are required. However, bottom-up NW growing methodology can be
interesting in order to achieve a higher density of nanowires and increase the
volumetric power. Two main obstacles have to be solved for the application of
these approaches. First, it is important to restrict the area where the NW will
grow to the active part of the device. Second, long distances between hot and
cold parts have to be provided in order to avoid thermal shunts by convection
or radiation.
A proof-of-concept of a thermoelectric micro-generator using VLS nanowire
growth was proposed by Davila et al. [115]. Figure 4.11 shows a sketch of
the device. Silicon p-doped nanowires were grown in a silicon micromachined
device, contacting a suspended platform with the bulk of the chip. In a harvesting
scenario, the device is put in contact with a hot surface. The low thermal mass of
the platform allows for a rapid cooling compared to bulk, providing the necessary
temperature diﬀerence for generating power. A series of heaters/thermometers
and metal pads allowed to control and measure heat while extracting the
generated current. In order to achieve a long separation between hot and cold
parts, a series of microspacers were introduced that remained suspended in
the ﬁnal prototype, held by the NWs array. A distance of 90 μm was achieved
between the walls. The gold catalyst particles were deposited by means of
galvanic displacement, a selective method that allowed introducing the seeds

only in the Si exposed surfaces. With this conﬁguration, a power density close to
1.5 mW/cm2 was demonstrated by providing a temperature diﬀerence of 300 ∘C.
4.8.2
Top-Down Nanowires
Constraints acting on the conversion eﬃciency of top-down nanowire-based
TEGs will be illustrated with reference to the typical structure of a lateral TEG
as the one sketched in Figure 4.12.
The device is made of thermoelements with complementary doping
(alternating n- and p-type) composed by a large number of stacked nanowires in
parallel, that are connected in order to create a suﬃcient number of thermocou-
ples in series. In the ﬁgure, the polycrystalline stacked nanowires described in
the previous section have been utilized in the TEG by way of example – although
the use of other types of nanowires within the same structure is also possible.
During operation, the thermal ﬂow in the TEG is as represented in Figure 4.13.
The device is used in contact with a hot surface at a temperature Th larger
than the ambient temperature Ta. As a result, a thermal ﬂow is built up across

the device that gives rise to a temperature diﬀerence across the nanostructured
thermocouples. Being ΔT the temperature diﬀerence, the power P transferred to
an electrical load in matching conditions by the TEG can be written as
P =
(ntpSpnΔT) 2
4Rtp
(4.16)
where Spn is the overall Seebeck coeﬃcient of the individual p–n nanostructured
thermocouple composed by complementarily doped nanowires in the device, ntp
is the number of thermocouples connected in series in the device, and Rtp is the
overall electrical resistance of such thermocouple chain.
Equation (4.16) clearly shows that in order to obtain a high conversion power
it would be desirable to increase as much as possible the temperature diﬀerence
ΔT in the device and to keep Rtp low. Both parameters actually depend on the
design of the TEG, since the thermal behavior of the device can be schematically
modeled by the series connection of two thermal resistances (Figure 4.14).
In the model, RTdev represents the overall thermal resistance of the device,
whereas RTrad is the thermal resistance between the device and the surrounding
environment and Tc is the temperature of the cold contact of the thermocouples.
In case a dissipater is utilized on the TEG, as shown in Figure 4.12, such
resistance is actually the thermal resistance of the heat sink. From the model,
the temperature diﬀerence ΔT in the TEG computes to
ΔT = Th −Tc = (Th −Ta)
RTdev
RTdev + RTrad
(4.17)
Thus, considering a given temperature diﬀerence between the hot surface and
the environment, ΔT is enhanced if the thermal resistance of the device is com-
parable or even larger than that of the heat sink. This is actually not possible for
typical TEGs, since the thermal resistance of heat sinks (particularly in natural
convection regime, which is almost always the case of interest for TEGs) is always

higher than that achievable with the device. Moreover, the thermal resistance of
the device cannot be increased indeﬁnitely, since its electrical resistance would
increase as well because of physical and geometrical constraints. For instance, the
thermal resistance of the device may be increased by designing longer thermoele-
ments, but this will also increase their electrical resistance and therefore Rtp in
Eq. (4.16), limiting their performance. Moreover, it must be kept in mind that
RTdev is the overall thermal resistance of the device, and not that of the nanowires
only, and therefore includes the eﬀect of other materials in the TEG, such as the
Si3N4/SiO2 dielectric membrane or the silicon anchors on the suspended mass
(as shown in Figure 4.12) and, more importantly, the eﬀect of thermal exchange
though air toward the surrounding environment and the hot surface (Figure 4.13).
Given such constraints and the properties of the materials employed in the TEG,
an optimum design can be achieved starting from the characteristics of the cho-
sen heat sink. In this optimization procedure, quite obviously, the availability of
nanowires with low thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity will be of help
to reach good conversion performances.
Another possible design of a top-down nanowire-based TEG is the one based
on a vertical arrangement of SiNWs (Figure 4.15).
This kind of device is described by an analogous thermal model (reported in
the ﬁgure), in which the thermal resistance of the heat sink is completely similar
to the case of the lateral TEG but the device resistance RTdev has a very diﬀerent
dependence on the design parameter and is generally lower, as it is diﬃcult to
fabricate long vertical nanowires.
In the scientiﬁc literature, the vertical arrangement has been already proposed
for TEGs based on top-down SiNWs [30, 31, 116–122], whereas the lateral device

has only been presented in TEGs based on bottom-up nanowires [115]. In vertical
devices, one of the main problems is the limited aspect ratio that can be obtained
in top-down nanowires manufactured by anisotropic etching, which generally
results in a maximum length of the nanowires around a few microns. This results
in a very low thermal resistance per device unit area, leading in turn to a marginal
ΔT across the device during operation, and then to a truly small generated power.
The other problem is the manufacturing of the thermocouples from the ver-
tical nanowire array, since this operation requires the metal connection of dif-
ferent levels on the device, which may be misaligned by several microns, making
lithography problematic. In the device represented in Figure 4.15, this diﬃculty is
partially overcome by the use of complementarily doped p- and n-type nanowires
in the thermoelements.
4.9
Summary and Outlook
In this chapter, we have reviewed the applications of silicon as a thermoelec-
tric material. It has been shown that, apart for its use in SiGe alloys for RTEGs,
silicon is possibly the only thermoelectric material that has seen no use as a bulk
material. As discussed, many age-old and novel materials largely outperform it
as of thermoelectric eﬃciency. Instead, silicon has found speciﬁc applications in
integrated devices, where its immediate compatibility with microelectronic stan-
dards justiﬁed its deployment for thermal harvesting.
This state of aﬀairs has quite changed over the last decade. On one side, the
discovery that silicon nanostructures may be capable of ZT of order of 1 due to
the reduction of its thermal conductivity has motivated a novel interest for this
classic material. Both bottom-up and top-down techniques have rapidly devel-
oped to enable the fabrication of SiNWs (and nanolayers) with methods capa-
ble of rapid scale-up. Although applications in modules are still marginal if not
lacking, it is appropriate to imagine that SiNW will ﬁnd actual use in the short
term, especially for microharvesting. The main hurdles to be overcome have been
reviewed, and directions of research in the ﬁeld have been outlined. Also for the
standard thin ﬁlm technology advancements have been reported. Silicon-based
nanocomposites were shown to be able of unexpectedly large PFs, still retaining
the relatively low thermal conductivity typical of ncSi.
Overall, thermoelectric silicon apparently deserves the renewed attention it
has received over the last years. As for all thermoelectrics, also for silicon it is to
be stressed that the way from material physics to real modules will be paved by the
development of suitable side technologies. As an example, lowering thermal and
electrical contact resistances are of paramount importance, especially for nano-
structured silicon – thus calling for research on silicon contact metallurgy. In
addition, innovative device layouts are also expected to play an important role as
of the actual electric power density microharvesters may generate. One may then
legitimately conclude that over the next years silicon will possibly attract the con-
current expertise of material scientists, physicists, chemists, and engineers – an
almost perfect blend of competences that might address the further development
of silicon as a thermoelectric material following a device-driven approach.

Introduction – Hitting the Target
This chapter will focus on the characterization of thermoelectric materials, espe-
cially the correct determination of the ZT-value.
And here the story starts: “What’s correct?”
In technical terms, it has to be called accurate. Accuracy and its technical and
scientiﬁc meaning are deﬁned by ISO norm 5725 [1]. It consists of two parts: the
precision and the trueness. Both have to be within speciﬁed limits to obtain an
accurate result. Two examples for poor accuracy can be seen in Figure 5.1. In our
case, achieving reasonable accuracy is extremely diﬃcult as the parameters that
determine the ZT-value and thereby the quality of a thermoelectric material are
linked by the Onsager–Callen relation:
[−⇀J
−⇀̇Q
]
=
[
𝜎
S𝜎
TS𝜎𝜆
] [ −⇀E
−−⇀∇T
]
The Onsager–Callen relation combines the electrical ﬂux −⇀J and the thermal
ﬂux
−⇀̇Q, which are driven by the electrical ﬁeld −⇀E and the thermal gradient −−⇀∇T.
Besidethis,theSeebeckcoeﬃcientS,theelectricalconductivity𝜎,andthethermal
conductivity 𝜆are determined by the number and mobility of the carriers. Good
metals with a high number of free electrons have a low Seebeck coeﬃcient but a
high thermal conductivity. We will have a closer look at this in the next section.
Because of this relationship between the important material parameters a small
change in the external condition, for example, the temperature gradient, will lead
to changed current ﬂux conditions and thereby a change in all parameters to be
determined. In general, this would make it necessary to determine all parameters
within the same measurement under the exact same conditions to obtain the best
results. In the case of separate measurements each parameter has to be ﬁtted
carefully over temperature to evaluate the ZT-value at a certain point.
The next section will go back to basics to explain the diﬃculties that arise from
the experimental point of view during the determination of the ZT-value.

5.2
Thermal Transport in Gases and Solid-State
Materials
Thermal transport in matter is realized by three diﬀerent processes: radiation,
convection, and conductive heat transport. Depending on the system, a combi-
nation of these will cause the total heat transport.
Heat transport via radiation depends on the temperature of a body and
its surrounding. The thermal ﬂux emitted by a body is described by the
Stefan–Boltzmann law:
̇Q = 𝜀𝜎AT4
𝜀is the emissivity of the surface of the body and is, in general, wavelength, surface
texture, and structure dependent. A perfect mirror has an emissivity of 0 and
an ideal black body radiator, 1, at all wavelengths. Real surfaces, however, are
somewhere in between, typical ceramics and thermoelectric materials are in the
range of 0.8–0.9, while blank metal surfaces are rather closer to 0. Radiation can
transport heat in a vacuum as well as in media such as gases or liquids. Thus,
preventing radiation losses becomes rather crucial at high temperatures or more
generally where there is a high temperature gradient between the object and its
surrounding. The emissivity at a given wavelength is equal to the absorption, for
example, when you are on the beach with a cold glass of beer it radiates heat to
the surrounding but also receives radiation, for example, from the shining sun
and the hot sand. In sum, the cold beer will heat up even if it is in weak direct
conductive contact to warm objects.
̇Q = 𝜀b𝜎Ab(T4
b −T4
s )
𝜎is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant (5.67e-8 W/m2/K4). If the surrounding is
more conﬁned (e.g., a small box) this equation will change according to the exact
geometry of the body as well as the surrounding.
Radiative heat transport does not involve matter; thus, no matter is exchanged
with the surrounding.
Heat transport via convection uses mass and thereby matter transport,
for example, of heated gas to transport heat away from a hot solid object,

5.2 Thermal Transport in Gases and Solid-State Materials

for example, an open chimney. Convective transport therefore needs an
intermediation media such as a gas or liquid to transport heat from one object
to another. Therefore, mechanical conﬁnement of free spaces (e.g., ﬁlling up
with wool) or the use of vacuum can hinder convective losses rather eﬃciently.
Calculation of these losses strongly depends on the geometry and surface
structure, and even the microstructure of the involved objects and is therefore
rather diﬃcult to evaluate. In general, the conducted heat is given by:
̇Q = h ⋅A ⋅ΔT
It is dependent on the surface area A, the temperature gradient ΔT, and the trans-
fer coeﬃcient h. This coeﬃcient depends, as mentioned before, on the structure
and geometry of the surface as well as the properties of the heat transporting
medium. These are its speed u, the viscosity 𝜈, the heat capacity c, and the ther-
mal conductivity 𝜆. These properties together form the important parameters,
the Nusselt, Prandl, Grashof, and the Reynolds numbers. These numbers will dif-
fer in the case of laminar or turbulent ﬂuxes. In the following, these parameters
are given for laminar natural convection on a ﬂat wall using the medium air at
standard ambient conditions. The Nusselt number determines how well the heat
is transferred from the surface with length L to its surrounding:
Nu(T) = h ⋅L

The exchange of heat between the surface and the medium takes place only within
a small layer close to the surface. The Prandl number is an indicator of the layer
thickness:
Pr = 𝜈
a ≈0.71
with a the thermal diﬀusivity. Around room temperature, the Prandl number can
be seen as constant.
The Grashof number compares the gravity, the viscous forces, and the ﬂotation
force in the medium. This number is rather critical for the total calculation:

with 𝛽=

The last important number is the Reynolds number, the product of Grashof and
Prandl numbers. If it is larger than 109, then the ﬂow is no longer laminar but
turbulent; in the case of free convection around room temperature it is about a
factor of 10 smaller than this limit.
Re = Gr ⋅Pr
These formulas give a ﬁrst feeling about the strength of convective heat trans-
port. It may be necessary to use an eﬀective surface area to get more precise
results. The equation will change dramatically in the case of forced convection.

5 Techniques for Characterizing Thermoelectric Materials
A realistic determination of convective losses can be calculated using ﬁnite
element simulations.
When a new measurement setup is constructed, one should plan tests to mea-
sure convective losses and if necessary compare them with simulations as they
will form a large part within the uncertainty budget of the experiment [2].
Conductive heat transport is also a matter free way to transfer heat from one
point to another but it needs the matter itself.
In a gas or a liquid the motion of the molecules is determined by the absolute
temperature. An increased temperature at one point in the gas will lead to faster
vibrating molecules in the surrounding. By collisions the gas molecules transfer
this higher velocity to other molecules and so the heat is spread in the gas from
the original heat source point. But in median no matter is transferred.
In a solid bulk material the position of the atoms/molecules is much more con-
ﬁned; thus, they will only vibrate around their ﬁxed position (as long as the solid
does not melt). The movement of the atoms is comparable to the oscillation of a
guitar string. These oscillations are called phonons and will be important to reach
a high ZT.
If we assume that a bulk material can be seen as a perfect crystal with a size L3
and a distance between the atoms of d, there is the largest wavelength of 2L for
very low temperatures and a shorter wavelength of 2d for very high temperatures.
Within these limits, the oscillation modes are thermally activated and thereby the
heat capacity (Cv) increases proportional to T3. The maximum heat capacity is
given by the Dulong–Petit law as
limT→∞Cv = 6 ⋅1
2 ⋅NA ⋅kb ⋅T = 3R
In general, the conducted heat through a surface area A and within a length of L
in a gas, liquid, or solid bulk material can be written as
̇⃗Q = ←→
𝜆⋅A
L ⋅⃗ΔT
Within a solid the thermal conductivity may be a tensor and thereby anisotropic
for the diﬀerent directions.
A very important diﬀerence arises as the solid becomes electrically conductive;
thus free carriers are present inside the solid material, which can be described as
a carrier gas. Therefore, the thermal conductivity will be a combination of two
parts, ﬁrst of the phonons and second of the carrier gas:
𝜆= 𝜆ph + 𝜆c.
As has been shown in chapter 2, one way to enhance the ZT-value is to
reduce the phonon part without inﬂuencing the carrier part. This is due to the
fact that the carrier part is directly linked to the electrical properties of the
material:
𝜆c = L ⋅T ⋅nq𝜇= L ⋅T ⋅𝜎
The linking elements are the Lorentz number, which is a material parameter and
not a constant, and the temperature. This leads directly to the next section, the
combined parameter ZT-value and how to measure it.

5.3 The Combined Parameter ZT-Value

5.3
The Combined Parameter ZT-Value
ZT = S2 𝜎
𝜆T
The ZT-value consists of the Seebeck coeﬃcient S squared, the electrical con-
ductivity 𝜎, and the thermal conductivity 𝜆, and T the absolute temperature. ZT
is a unit free parameter that combines all important parameters for a good ther-
moelectric material as described by Altenkirch [3] in 1909.
The Seebeck coeﬃcient should be as high as in a semiconductor:
S =
8𝜋2k2
b
3qh2 m∗T
( 𝜋
3n
) 2
3
Here, q is the carrier charge, h the Planck constant, m∗the eﬀective mass of the
carriers, and n the charge carrier density. The electrical conductivity should be as
high as in a metal:
𝜎= nq𝜇= nq2𝜋
m∗
and the thermal conductivity should be as low as in a glass:
𝜆= 𝜆ph + 𝜆c = 𝜆ph + L ⋅T ⋅nq𝜇= 𝜆ph + L ⋅T ⋅𝜎
As can be seen, all parts of the ZT-value directly depend on the carrier properties,
the carrier concentration n and the mobility 𝜇. This dependency is illustrated
within Figure 5.2. For a certain temperature there will be an optimum point to
reach maximum ZT-value.
Beside this optimization the introduction of nanostructures inside a bulk
material is used to reduce the phonon part of the thermal conductivity
Figure 5.2 All parts of the ZT-value
depend on the carrier properties,
especially the carrier concentration.
Therefore, one will ﬁnd an optimum
carrier concentration level for a certain
temperature where the ZT-value is at its
maximum. Please keep in mind that this
point is strongly temperature dependent;
thus a material has to be optimized at its
desired operation temperature.

[4–6] without hindering the electronic parameters as suggested by Hicks and
Dresselhaus [7] in 1993.
Theoretically, this will lead to a higher ZT-value, which has to be determined in
diﬀerent experiments. But this enhancement of the ZT-value is often connected
with an introduction of anisotropy into the material [8, 9] so the determination
may become rather challenging. Within the next section this challenge to deter-
mine the parameters of the ZT-value will be discussed. The starting point will be,
on ﬁrst consideration, the easiest parameter, the electrical conductivity.
5.3.1
Electrical Conductivity
Electrical conductivity seems to be the easiest parameter as theoretically only
Ohms law has to be taken into account.
U = R ⋅I ; 𝜚= R ⋅A
l ; 𝜎= 1
𝜚
By applying a current I to a conducting strip with length l and cross section A
one will measure a voltage diﬀerence U and thereby a resistance R. The speciﬁc
resistivity 𝜚and the speciﬁc conductivity 𝜎can be easily calculated in this case.
Unfortunately, real measurement equipments have test wires that have a resis-
tance; so the so-called four wire technique has to be used to compensate in order
to measure the real numbers (see Figure 5.3a). To measure the sheet resistance
Rsq of a thin quasi inﬁnite sample the contact arrangement shown in Figure 5.3b
is used. The speciﬁc resistance can be calculated using the current I and the mea-
sured voltage V as
Rsq =
𝜋
ln 2 ⋅U
I ; 𝜚= d ⋅Rsq
Here, d is the thickness of the measured sheet, which should be much smaller
than the distance s between the contact tips. The contact tips have to be equidis-
tant; otherwise, the formula for the sheet resistance changes. Analytic formulas
for various geometrical arrangements have been calculated by Smits [10] and
Valdes [11].

Figure 5.4 Arrangement of the contact for the van der Pauw measurement of the speciﬁc
resistance. For a complete measurement all four contact conﬁgurations have to be measured.
If a direct current (DC) is used, all conﬁgurations have to be measured in both polarities.
Another common arrangement to measure the speciﬁc electrical resistance
of a sample is the so-called van der Pauw geometry. In most cases it is used as
the original experiment in Hall measurement experiments [12, 13]. The contact
arrangement for a thin square-shaped sample can be seen in Figure 5.4.
In general, the shape of the sample can be arbitrary but the contacts have to be
arranged at its edges. To obtain the speciﬁc resistance at least two measurements
have to be done. First, one has to apply the current between contacts A and B and
measure the voltage between contacts C and D. Second, the current is applied
between B and C and the voltage measured between D and A. This will lead to
two resistances, which can be used to calculate the speciﬁc resistance as follows:
RAB,CD = UCD

RBC,DA = UDA

This equation can only be evaluated iteratively; an estimation formula for the
speciﬁc resistance is the following:
𝜚= 𝜋d
ln 2 ⋅
RAB,CD + RBC,DA
2
⋅f
The factor f , which can be found in the original publications by van der Pauw
[12, 13], is itself dependent on the measured resistances. The thickness of the
sample has to be small compared to the distance between the contact tips as in the
four-point geometry. For a complete measurement all four contact conﬁgurations
have to be measured. If a direct current (DC) is used, all conﬁgurations have to
be measured in both polarities. All four evaluated speciﬁc resistances should be
equal; the measurement result is the average value of all four.
Unfortunately, none of the previously shown methods is really used in the stan-
dardized measurements at the national metrological institutes such as the NPL,
NIST, or PTB. Between 2000 and 2003, NPL and PTB had an FP5 project (grant
number G6RD-CT-2000-00210) where the van der Pauw method was compared
to the used eddy current and bar measurement methods.
Most national metrological institutes use the bar measurement method (see
Figure 5.5) [14]. A long bar (10–30 cm length) is clamped on both ends to
the current leads. Two razor blade electrodes arranged in a ﬁxed distance are
put on the surface and the voltage between both is measured. To stabilize the

Figure 5.6 To measure thermoelectric materials beside the van der Pauw method three
typical measurement arrangements are used. (a) Sample is lying on metallic block introducing
the current into the sample, (b) sample is mechanically clamped between the current input
blocks, and (c) the current is introduced through contact tips similar to the four-point method
shown previously. All three arrangements are used to measure round, square, and bar-shaped
samples.
temperature during the measurement the whole setup can be submerged in an
oil bath. Using such big samples reduces the inﬂuence of geometry uncertainties
as well as inhomogeneities within the reference material.
For most thermoelectric materials, however, the maximum sample size is
limited to a few tens of millimeters in each direction; therefore, beside the van
der Pauw method there are three typical measurement arrangements used as
can be seen in Figure 5.6.
The highest uncertainties in all cases arise from the error in the determination
of the sample geometry as well as the position of sample clamps, supports,
and the measurement tips. Typically, the size of a sample can be determined
with an uncertainty of ±10 μm, and the position of the current inputs with an
uncertainty between ±50 and ±100 μm. The highest uncertainty arises typically
from the voltage probes as these are not needles (to form a point contact) but
thermoelements with a ball-shaped head with up to 0.5 mm radius. Some setups
use shielded thermoelements; also in this case typical heads have a radius of
about 0.5 mm. As will be shown in the next section, the heads may be ﬂattened
at the contact point to the sample to enhance the thermal contact between
the sample and the thermoelements. Therefore, the geometrical uncertainty
budget can rise up to ±5% [15, 16]. Using optimized mechanical guidance of
the current and voltage probes will improve the repeatability [17]. In all cases,
calibration functions similar to those of Smits and Valdes have to be used to
evaluate the resistance from the measured voltage and current data. Using the
van der Pauw method reduces the uncertainty with respect to the determination
of the thickness of the sample. Recent round robin tests have shown that these
rather larger uncertainties are typical numbers [18, 19]. Fortunately, even for

5.3 The Combined Parameter ZT-Value
101
thin ﬁlms and semiconductors there are measurement standards available to
validate measurement setups at room temperature [20–22]. Some alloys such
as constantan or pure metals such as nickel [23] oﬀer the possibility to validate
measurement setups also at high temperatures.
It should be mentioned that a thermoelectric material cannot be measured
within a classic DC measurement. Owing to the large Peltier eﬀect, compared
to a normal metal, applying a DC voltage will lead to an additional temperature
shift and thereby voltage shift. This shift can be utilized to measure ZT directly
as will be discussed later [24, 25]. To avoid this shift a so-called DC delta mode
measurement can be done [26]. DC current is not applied constantly to the
sample but only in short pulses, and the polarity is also changed. Using diﬀerent
currents a quasi-current–voltage-slope (I–V curve) can be obtained. The other
possibility is to use a real AC (alternating current) measurement and measure an
I–V curve. The inverse slope of the I–V-curve represents the diﬀerential ohmic
resistance at 0 V.
5.3.2
Seebeck Coeﬃcient
As shown in the last section even the “easy” parameter electrical resistivity may
have some critical points; the Seebeck coeﬃcient will be even more challenging as
small voltages of a few hundred microvolts and small temperature diﬀerences of
a few Kelvins have to be measured accurately. In general, the Seebeck coeﬃcient
is given by
S = 𝜕U
𝜕T ≈ΔU
ΔT
Most commercially available high temperature Seebeck measurement setups use
one of the three basic arrangements shown in Figure 5.7 [17, 27–30]. The sample
to be investigated is placed between or on-top of two separate sample supports
where it is held in place by an applied force (clamped or by installing a weight).
In conﬁguration (a), the sample is clamped between the two current inputs.
Within one of the inputs a heater (H) is installed, which will introduce a

Figure 5.7 In conﬁguration (a) the sample is clamped between the two current inputs. Within
one of the inputs a heater (H) is installed, which will introduce a temperature gradient on the
sample for measuring the Seebeck coeﬃcient. Conﬁgurations (b) and (c) use the same general
arrangement for the thermoelements but diﬀerent ways to introduce the current into the
sample for a parallel measurement of the resistivity. In conﬁguration (b) the current is
introduced via the sample supports. Conﬁguration (c) uses needles to introduce the current
into the sample.

temperature gradient on the sample for measuring the Seebeck coeﬃcient. Long
thermocouples are used as voltage probes for the resistivity measurement as
well to measure the temperature gradient and the arising voltage diﬀerence.
Conﬁgurations (b) and (c) use the same general arrangement for the thermoele-
ments but diﬀerent ways to introduce the current into the sample for a parallel
measurement of the resistivity. In conﬁguration (b), the current is introduced via
the sample supports. Conﬁguration (c) uses needles to introduce the current into
the sample. In both cases, the two sample supports have an installed heater so
that a temperature gradient can be applied in two directions. The thermocouples
are guided through the sample supports so that they are in thermal contact not
only to the sample but also to the supports.
Let us take a closer look at all arrangements during the measurement of the
Seebeck coeﬃcient. In all cases the setups are placed within a furnace to ther-
malize the sample to a set temperature Tf. If the right heater is switched on the
temperatures will rise and in general we will reach the situation of
Tf < T1 < T2
In the sample, we will ﬁnd the situation
Tf < T1 < Tl < Tr < T2
From the diﬀerence |Tl −Tr| = ΔTs will arise the thermovoltage ΔU. The main
problem is the measured temperature, which will be diﬀerent from the tempera-
ture inside the sample. One may ask “why that?”
In the case of conﬁguration (a) the thermocouples are in contact with the sam-
ple but via radiation and convection, also with the lower furnace temperature. The
larger the diﬀerence between the real sample temperature and the furnace is, the
more the measured temperature is lowered. Thus the measured temperature in
the left thermocouple is lowered by 𝛿and that in the right by 𝛿′ > 𝛿. Therefore,
the measured temperature diﬀerence will be smaller than the real:
ΔTm = |T∗
l −T∗
r | < ΔTs
This eﬀect is sometimes called cold ﬁnger eﬀect [16]. If the thermal contact
between the sample and the thermocouples is good this eﬀect will be small but
it will result in a slightly bigger measured Seebeck coeﬃcient than the real one
[15]. To reduce this eﬀect the contact area, which is theoretically a point, can
be enlarged by ﬂattening the thermocouple ball, but this will lead to a higher
uncertainty in the resistance measurement as mentioned in the previous section.
In conﬁgurations (b) and (c), the thermocouples are also in thermal contact
with the sample supports and thereby with the heater. The measured temperature
of the two thermocouples will therefore be closer to the temperature within the
sample. Because of the contact to the heater the measured temperature diﬀerence
will be slightly larger than the real one and therefore the measured Seebeck coef-
ﬁcient will be smaller than the real one. In all cases, the eﬀect will be stronger for
thinner samples than for big bulky ones. Also in the case of a weak thermal con-
tact between the sample and thermocouples this eﬀects will be larger, but in case
(b)/(c) it is smaller than in case (a) and the Seebeck coeﬃcient will not be overesti-
mated [18, 19, 27, 31]. Nevertheless, one has to consider an uncertainty between

5.3 The Combined Parameter ZT-Value

5% and 8% for the measurement of the Seebeck coeﬃcient [17, 27–29]. All
measurement setups allow the simultaneous measurement of both the Seebeck
coeﬃcient and the electrical conductivity in the same direction within the sample.
In a close collaboration between Fraunhofer IPM and the PTB (German
equivalent to NIST or NPL) in Berlin a Seebeck measurement system was devel-
oped that showed reduced absolute errors below 2 μV. It utilizes the Seebeck
measurement procedure published by Boﬀoue et al. [31] (arrangement according
to Figure 5.7c) using a transient determination of the Seebeck coeﬃcient. By using
this procedure it is possible to assess the measured data, for example, due to loss
of thermal contact during the measurement [17, 27, 28, 32].This system is now
used by the PTB to develop reference samples for the Seebeck coeﬃcient [28, 32].
Within the last few years, reference samples have been developed by NIST and
PTB, which can be obtained in various geometries ﬁtting to most commercial
measurement setups [28, 32, 33]. In addition, pure nickel or thermoelement
materials such as chromel or alumel can be used to validate measurement
systems [23, 31] but the Seebeck coeﬃcient is much smaller than within real
thermoelectric samples. For more information, please check Mackey et al. who
published a detailed review on uncertainties that arise during the power factor
measurement [15, 16].
In case of thin ﬁlms no reference samples are available at present. This may be
due to the fact that thin ﬁlm samples are much more delicate in their reaction to
air and at high temperatures. Experiences from the laboratory show that this is a
real problem. At the moment, an internal round robin test on thin ﬁlm samples
is running in the European FP7-Projekt NanoCaTe (Grant Number: 604647).
5.3.3
Thermal Conductivity
For the determination of thermal conductivity there are several methods
available. The most commonly used is the LFA (laser ﬂash analyze or laser ﬂash
method). Also very common, especially for thin ﬁlm samples, is the so-called 3
Omega method, and last the TDTR (time domain thermoreﬂectance method).
In the following, all three will be presented brieﬂy.
The LFA method measures the passage time of a heat pulse through a ﬂat disc
sample. A schematic drawing can be seen in Figure 5.8. The complete setup is
placed in a controlled thermal surrounding such as a furnace or a thermostat. An
infrared laser shoots a ﬂash on the lower face of the sample. On the upper face
of the sample an infrared detector measures the time (t) and the amount of heat
coming out of the sample. So the ﬁrst parameter detected by the LFA method is
not the thermal conductivity but the temperature conductivity [34–36]

known properties can be measured in comparison within the same experiment.
Therefore, the reference sample as well as the sample to be measured should

have the same size and thickness (d). To ensure equal optical behaviors both
have to be coated in the same way, for example, using graphite spray coating.
By comparing the time-dependent heat ﬂux curves measured on both samples
the thermal conductivity can be calculated.
For the accuracy of this measurement the coating as also the sample shape are
critical parameters as they will directly aﬀect the result. Samples have to be cut
and polished with parallel surfaces. A typical error for this comparative mea-
surement is 5–8%. Experience from the laboratory shows that this is equal to or
sometimes even better than the separate measurement of all required parameters
with diﬀerential scanning calorimetry and dilatometry.
The LFA method is well established for bulk and thick ﬁlm samples; for samples
in the nanometer range other methods may be more suitable.
One of these methods is the TDTR measurement. A basic scheme can be seen
in Figure 5.9. It can be used for thin ﬁlms as well as for bulk samples. The sample
has to be covered with a thin ﬁlm (<100 nm) of aluminum [37]. The surface
of the coated sample has to be reﬂective so the roughness has to be small. The
measurement is again an optical method. A high-power heating pulse locally
heats up the sample; the heat then propagates into the sample and the underlying
substrate. A second laser pulse with much lower energy measures the reﬂectance

conductivity can be derived.

of the aluminum surface, which depends on its temperature. Measuring the
temperature at diﬀerent times after the heating pulse allows the thermal conduc-
tivity to be calculated. For details please see the publication of Cahill [37]. Typical
uncertainties are around 5% but strongly depend on the individual sample.
The last method is the 3 Omega method [38–40]. A bolometer structure con-
nected to the sample (see Figure 5.10) is used in this measurement setup. An
AC current is applied to this structure and the voltage drop is measured via two
separate terminals. The signals arising in this system are shown in Figure 5.11.
Applying a heating current with frequency 𝜔to the structure will introduce a
heating power and thereby a heat ﬂux into the sample with frequency 2𝜔. There-
fore, the temperature of the sample will oscillate with the same frequency 2𝜔as
will the resistance of the bolometer. As the voltage is the product of current and
resistance one will obtain a complex term
U(t) = R(t) ⋅I(t) = R0(1 + 𝛼RΔT cos(2𝜔t + 𝜙)) ⋅I0 cos(𝜔t)

This formula uses only the diﬀerence between two points; in a real experiment
one may plot the 3 Omega amplitude over the logarithmic frequency, and the
steepness of the curve is then proportional to the thermal conductivity.
A well written review about various geometries for the bolometers and the
typical uncertainties to be achieved was published by Dames and Chen [39]
. Typical uncertainties for the simple bolometer structure are in the range of
5–10%. Most eﬀects on the accuracy are the exact geometrical parameters of
the bolometer as well as the precise temperature coeﬃcient, which has to be
measured separately.
It has to be mentioned that there should be a large number of reference bulk
samples available in order to verify one’s own system. In most cases such reference
samples will be directly shipped along while purchasing a measuring instrument.
So the complex property of thermal conductivity seems to be the “easiest.”
One may ask “Isn’t there one measurement for ZT in one shot?” Yes there
is! Birkholz built a ZT-measurement setup in the 1960s and Jacquot et al. [41]
in 2011; a more commonly known method is that by Harman and coworkers
[24, 25].
ByapplyingablockcurrenttoathermoelectricmaterialHarmanusedthePeltier
eﬀect to introduce a temperature diﬀerence between the two current terminals
(see Figure 5.12). When the current is switched to 0, the voltage ﬁrst drops fast
and then, because of the thermal properties of the sample and the thermoelectric
parameters, slowly. By measuring both parts of this voltage drop and comparing
them Harman showed that the ZT-value can be calculated according to
ZT = Vs

Theoretically, the uncertainty of the Harman method should be very low <5%
[2, 42, 43]. The main point is that temperature losses due to radiation have to be
minimized or measured separately. A second point is that the contact resistance
should be very small compared to the sample resistance because otherwise Joule
heating in the contact will interfere with the Harman measurement. The Har-
man method also works for thin ﬁlm samples and is often used to measure the
properties of assembled thermoelectric modules.

Summary
There are many methods to determine the parameters leading to the ﬁgure of
merit ZT for bulk materials, but fewer for thin ﬁlm samples. When measuring
Seebeck coeﬃcient, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity in diﬀerent
experiments one has to be sure to determine all parameters in the same direction
as anisotropy introduced by nanostructuring or, as in case of bismuth-telluride,
crystal growth may lead to diﬀerent results [44, 45]. Nevertheless, the total uncer-
tainty budget that has to be assumed for the ZT-value is between 20% and 30%.
Fortunately, for most of the parameters there are reference materials now avail-
able or in development to reduce this value within the next years.

Introduction
Thermoelectric devices (also known as modules) are solid-state energy converters
that can convert heat into electricity for power generation or pump heat from
one junction to another for refrigeration [1–5]. Figure 6.1 shows a schematic
diagram of the structure and main components of a conventional thermoelectric
module [6]. A key step in the fabrication of thermoelectric devices is to join an
n-type thermoelement with a p-type thermoelement through a metallic contact
layer. The existence of various contact layers and interfaces between the layers
will inevitably introduce both electrical and thermal contact resistances into a
practical thermoelectric device. As a result, this will lead to the consumption
of energy at these interfaces and a reduction in the device performance (as
compared with that predicted by an ideal model where the contact resis-
tances are neglected). In order to minimize the performance reduction due
to the contact resistances of the interfaces, preparation and characterization
of thermoelectric junction/interfaces become an important prerequisite for
thermoelectric module fabrication. In this chapter, a theoretical outline of the
eﬀects of contact resistances on the performance of thermoelectric device will
be given, followed by a discussion of key factors and challenges that are crucial
to the design and fabrication of thermoelectric interfaces/junctions, with a focus
on evaluation and minimization of the thermoelectric contact resistances. The
purpose of this chapter is to provide a brief overview on the basic principles
and the state-of-the-art technologies that are crucial to achieving low-contact
resistances for the fabrication of high-performance thermoelectric devices.

will result in additional Joule heat at junctions, while thermal contact resistance
will decrease the temperature diﬀerence across the thermoelectric materials
because of the temperature drop on contact layers. The eﬀect of both electrical
and thermal contact resistance on the performance of thermoelectric modules
can be evaluated by the change of the dimensionless ﬁgure of merit, ZT. In this
section, a simpliﬁed model is developed to describe the inﬂuence of electrical
and thermal contact resistances on the performance of thermoelectric devices
and provide a quantitative evaluation of the contact resistance required for
satisfactory manufacturing of thermoelectric modules.
Considering a single thermoelement without contact resistance as shown in
Figure 6.2a, its dimensionless thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit is given by [6]
ZT = 𝛼2T
RK
(6.1)
where 𝛼= V∕ΔTo is the Seebeck coeﬃcient of the thermoelement (ΔTo is the
temperature diﬀerence across the thermoelement, V is the Seebeck voltage gen-
erated under ΔTo); R = 𝜌(l∕A) and K = k(A∕l) are the electrical resistance and

6.2 Eﬀects of Electrical and Thermal Contact Resistances

thermal conductance of the thermoelement, respectively (𝜌and k are the elec-
trical resistivity and thermal conductivity of thermoelectric material, and A and
l are the cross-sectional area and length of thermoelement). Without the inﬂu-
ence of the contact resistances, it can be shown that the ZT of the thermoelement
(Eq. (6.1)) is the same as the ZT (= 𝛼2T∕𝜌k) of the thermoelectric material.
If electrical contact resistance exists due to the existence of the contact layers
as shown in Figure 6.2b, the eﬀective electrical resistance of the thermoelement
becomes [7]
Re = R
(
1 + 2Rc
R
)
(6.2)
where Rc is the electrical contact resistance. The interface layers also cause a
reduction in the temperature diﬀerence across the thermoelement due to tem-
perature drops across the contact layers. In this case, ΔTo = ΔT + ΔTc (where
ΔT is the temperature diﬀerence across the actual thermoelement and ΔTc is the
temperature drop across the interface layers). The thermal contact conductance
of the interface layer can be deﬁned as Kc = Q∕(ΔTc∕2) (where Q is the heat ﬂow
through the thermoelement), and the eﬀective thermal conductance of the ther-
moelement can be expressed as [7]
Ke =
K
1 + 2K∕Kc
(6.3)
The Seebeck voltage will also decrease owing to a smaller temperature
diﬀerence across the thermoelement. The eﬀective Seebeck coeﬃcient in this
case is given by
𝛼e =
𝛼
1 + 2K∕Kc
(6.4)
As a result, the eﬀective ZT of the thermoelement can be expressed as
ZTe =
ZT
(1 + 2Rc∕R)(1 + 2K∕Kc)
(6.5)
Deﬁning the electrical contact resistivity (also known as speciﬁc contact resis-
tance) as 𝜌c = RcA and the thermal contact conductivity as kc = Kc∕A, the relative
reduction of the ZT is given by
ZTe
ZT =
1
(1 + 2𝜌c∕𝜌l)(1 + 2k∕kcl)
(6.6)
It can be seen that the relative reduction in the ZT of a thermoelectric device
depends on the ratios of 𝜌c∕𝜌and k∕kc and the length of the thermoelement.
Equation (6.6) provides a quantitative measure of the contact resistances to
ensure that the reduction in the ZT of the thermoelectric device is limited
to an acceptable level. For example, in order to meet the requirement of ZT
reduction being limited to 10%, with 5% each due to electrical and thermal
contact respectively, the required contact resistivity for a given length is shown in
Table 6.1. It can be seen that shorter lengths require smaller contact resistivities
to obtain a given performance.

The contact resistances have a similar eﬀect on the power output and con-
version eﬃciency of thermoelectric devices. The maximum power output at the

(6.7)
Similarly, it is important to minimize both the electrical and thermal contact
resistances in order to limit the reduction in the maximum power output. Clearly,
making thermoelectric interfaces with small contact resistances is an important
requirement in thermoelectric module fabrication processes.
6.3
Preparation of Thermoelectric Interfaces
In order to meet the requirements of output voltage and facilitate convenient
heat transfer, a thermoelectric module usually consists of many thermoelectric
junctions connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel as shown in
Figure 6.1c. Manufacturing of such modules involves the simultaneous assembly
of thermoelectric junctions all at once. However, in order to ensure satisfactory
contact resistances at all interfaces, suitable contact layers and assembly condi-
tions need to be thoroughly investigated and determined using a simple unijunc-
tion prior to module assembly involving multiple junctions. This section focuses
on the research eﬀorts required in preparation of a unijunction for the determi-
nation of satisfactory thermoelectric interfaces/junctions.
The basic requirement for the contact layers used in thermoelectric modules
is to join thermoelements with good electrical and thermal conductivities, and
satisfactory mechanical strength. These requirements can usually be met by
employing soldering or brazing techniques with appropriate selection of solders
or brazing materials. However, owing to the elevated temperatures required for

6.3 Preparation of Thermoelectric Interfaces
115
soldering or brazing processes, interdiﬀusion could occur among thermoelectric
materials, brazing materials, and contact layers (usually copper). Copper is
well known to have a high diﬀusion coeﬃcient in semiconductors and can
usually act as a dopant, resulting in degradation of thermoelectric properties if
diﬀused into thermoelectric materials. Consequently, a barrier layer between
thermoelectric materials and solders is required to prevent solders and/or
contact layer materials from being diﬀused into thermoelectric materials.
A variety of techniques for the joining of thermoelements to electrodes have
been employed, with the introduction of a barrier layer at various stages of
the fabrication process. For bismuth telluride-based systems, barrier layers
are typically electroplated or metal sprayed onto preformed pellets. Speciﬁc
contact resistances on the order of 10−6–10−5 Ω cm2 have been reported [8].
Early research conducted on skutterudites by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in the late 1990s focused on the hot-side interface between the skutterudite and
the electrode. Both foil [9] and powdered [10, 11] barrier layers were added to the
presintered skutterudite powder and were hot-pressed together to improve the
contact bond. Mixed results were observed with the powdered barrier layer,
with densities close to 80–90% being observed. Thermal-stress-induced cracks
were observed when the skutterudite and nickel powder were pressed together
and this was attributed to a mismatch in the thermal expansion coeﬃcients
of the two materials. When the nickel was replaced with niobium, which
has a closer matched expansion coeﬃcient with the skutterudite, the speciﬁc
contact resistance was found to be less than 5 × 10−6 Ω cm2 and mechanically
stable. Low resistance values were also obtained when the powdered barrier
layer was replaced with foils such as palladium but for both powder and foils
contacts, no long-term stability data was presented. Other groups have reported
the formation of good electrical and mechanical contacts using spark plasma
sintering (SPS). In this technique the electrode, barrier layer, and presintered
skutterudite are all placed in a graphite die and sintered in a one-step pro-
cess [12–17]. One particularly interesting advantage of this method is that it
allows diﬀerent material combinations to be examined, enabling the physical
properties to be tuned to those of the skutterudite. Zhao et al. have tested
both titanium [12, 13, 15] and molybdenum [16] barrier layers and obtained
speciﬁc contact resistances of around 20 × 10−6 Ω cm2 for the former, although
a mechanical and electrical degradation in the contact joint was observed with
the sample held at elevated temperatures for extended time periods. Fan et al.
report excellent speciﬁc contact resistances while bonding ytterbium-ﬁlled
skutterudites to nickel electrodes in a one-step sintering process [14], using a
combination of molybdenum and titanium as a barrier layer. An addition buﬀer
layer of molybdenum–copper was also placed between the barrier layer and the
electrode to ensure that any thermal expansion mismatch with the nickel was
minimized. A resistance of 3 × 10−6 Ω cm2 was observed with a slight increase to
9 × 10−6 Ω cm2 following several days of elevated temperature testing, with no
cracks observed at the interface. Wojciechowski et al. [18] hot-pressed CoSb3
and then applied a 1 μm nickel or 2.5 μm molybdenum layer using magnetic
sputtering. The elements were then resistance brazed to copper electrodes with
the electrical resistance of the contact measured around (5–15) × 10−6 Ω cm2.

However, this was accompanied by the interdiﬀusion of braze material into the
thermoelement of up to 1.5 mm. The results presented in this section are of
skutterudite thermoelements with a barrier layer electroplated post sintering.
In principle, the thermoelectric junctions employed for study of the contact
resistances should be structured as close to a practical thermoelectric junction
as possible. However, owing to the practicality of preparation and characteri-
zation, simple constructions of thermoelectric junctions should also be consid-
ered. Figure 6.3a shows a typical conﬁguration frequently used for the study of
the inﬂuence of contact layers. The junction consists of a copper contact layer
sandwiched between two thermoelements of the same type, joined together by
soldering or brazing. The barrier layers (usually nickel or palladium) were coated
on the joining surfaces of thermoelements by electroplating. Figure 6.3b shows
a photograph of a prepared thermoelectric junction using skutterudite materials
at CardiﬀThermoelectric Laboratory.
The prebrazed junction is assembled in a sample holder shown in Figure 6.4a,
held in place by a spring loaded grub screw. The sample holder is loaded into a
quartz tube that sits inside a tube furnace (Figure 6.4b). The air from the quartz
tube can be evacuated or purged with inert gases such as argon to remove oxy-
gen prior to brazing at elevated temperatures. The furnace is set to the required
temperature for brazing and the sample is then inserted in the hottest central
part of the tube using external magnets to move the sample holder. Once the
temperature has been reached and the joint is formed, the sample is removed to
cool down in an oxygen-free environment. There is typically a large diﬀerence in
the furnace temperature and the temperature at the sample holder and to mea-
sure this temperature diﬀerence a wireless thermocouple setup from Omega is
used to accurately determine the temperature at the sample holder during the
process. Once cooled, the sample is removed from the quartz tube and cleaned to
remove any ﬂux or dirt and then polished to provide a smooth surface for analysis.

Characterization of Contact Resistance Using
Scanning Probe
Determination of the electrical contact resistance at the junction interfaces
provides important information that has crucial inﬂuence on the manufacturing
quality of a thermoelectric module. There are a number of diﬀerent ways of
measuring the contact resistance [19], although many of the traditional tech-
niques were designed for DC measurements of semiconductor–metal interfaces
where thermoelectric eﬀects are minimized. These include the twin contact,
diﬀerential, Van der Pauw, and TLM methods among others. Although it is
possible to adapt many of these techniques for thermoelectric-speciﬁc contact
resistance and resistivity measurements, a well-established technique for this
purpose is the extrapolation method or resistance scanning probe [7, 8, 20] as
it is also known. The principle of this technique is shown in Figure 6.5. It is a
three-probe setup, which consists of two ﬁxed probes and one that can move
across the sample surface. The sample is sandwiched between the two ﬁxed

The third probe is positioned on a surface of the sample that is perpendicular to
the junction interfaces and is able to travel across the sample while maintaining
good electrical contact by pressure to record voltage change as a function of

the circuit to determine the current. As a result, the resistance proﬁle along the

where V(x) is the voltage measured at position x. Rref is a reference resistor for
current measurement and Vref is the voltage across the reference resistor.
Figure 6.6 shows a schematic of typical resistance proﬁles that can be obtained
by swiping the scanning probe along the surface of the thermoelectric uni-
junction. When the probe moves away from the reference contact (i.e., the one
connected to the ground), the resistance between the reference contact and the
scanning probe increases with increasing distance (x) until it reaches the copper
interface layer. Since the resistivity of the copper interface layer is approximately
three orders of magnitude lower than that of the thermoelectric material, the
resistance will remain almost constant over the region corresponding to the
thickness of the copper interface layer. The resistance will again increase with
increasing distance after the scanning probe enters into the second piece of
the thermoelectric materials. If there is no contact resistance between the
thermoelectric material and the copper interface layer, there is no abrupt change
at interfaces as shown by the bottom curve of the resistance proﬁles in Figure 6.6.
However, if a contact resistance exists at the interfaces between the thermoelec-
tric materials and the copper layer, signiﬁcant change at the interfaces will occur
as shown by the middle and top curves of Figure 6.6. The middle curve indicates
that noticeable contact resistance exists but no interdiﬀusion takes place at the
interface. The top curve implies that both contact resistance and interdiﬀusion
occur in the vicinity of the interfaces. Measuring the contact resistance, ΔR,
on the resistance proﬁle (Figure 6.6), the contact resistivity can be determined
by ΔR∕A (where A is the cross-sectional area of the interfaces). The diﬀusion

information on materials interaction at interfaces. In addition, the resistivity
of thermoelectric materials can be estimated from the slope of the resistance
proﬁle, dR∕dx.
Figure 6.7 shows the photograph of a resistance scanning apparatus developed
at Cardiﬀ, which enables determination of the resistance proﬁle with spatial
resolution of 2 μm. The scanning probe is a HD-PA4BS spring-loaded spear point
purchased from Coda-Systems with the holding barrel screwed into a Quatar
Research XYZ 300 ML platform and mounted on a Thorlabs MTS25/M-Z8E
automated translation stage. The stage position and voltage reading are both
controlled by a computer using a LabVIEW program, which enables automated
scanning and data acquisition. An AC voltage source with a frequency of
40 Hz is used to minimize the errors due to thermoelectric eﬀects. In order
to ensure measurement accuracy, the system was calibrated by measuring the
bulk resistance of a standard reference sample (SRM 1461 – stainless steel) from

120
6 Preparation and Characterization of TE Interfaces/Junctions
NIST. The calibration was carried out at the temperature of 24 ∘C using both DC
and AC voltage sources because the data provided by NIST was obtained using
DC, while AC is necessary for measurements of thermoelectric materials. The
results are shown in Table 6.2. The repeatability of the scanning resistance probe
is 1.9% and 1.3% for DC and AC power sources, respectively. The systematic
error of the system is about 1.7% for DC power source while it is 4.1% for AC
power source.
The use of a ﬁne resolution translation stage (MTS25/M-Z8E) oﬀers a spatial
resolution of less than 2 μm. This provides the capability of detecting the interdif-
fusion between thermoelectric materials and brazing materials on a microscale.

thermoelectric materials, although this region cannot be seen in the photograph.

that no interdiﬀusion takes place for the junction prepared at 654 ∘C, which also
exhibits the lowest electrical contact resistivity. The junction prepared at 663 ∘C
shows a slightly larger contact resistivity with some degree of interdiﬀusion. The
junction prepared at 668 ∘C shows signiﬁcant interdiﬀusion and larger contact
resistivity. These results demonstrate that the resistance proﬁles obtained using
a high-resolution scanning resistance probe can provide crucial information on
contact resistance and interdiﬀusion at interfaces.

Characterization of Thermal Contact Using Infrared
Microscope
As shown in Section 6.2, minimizing the thermal contact resistance at ther-
moelectric interfaces is equally important. Thermal contact resistance may be
determined by examining the temperature proﬁle at interfaces using an infrared
microscope. When applying a temperature diﬀerence across a thermoelec-
tric junction (Figure 6.3), a temperature proﬁle will be established as shown
schematically in Figure 6.10. Based on Fourier’s law and neglecting the heat
losses from the surfaces of the thermoelectric junction, the heat ﬂux through the
thermoelectric material is equal to the heat ﬂux across the interfaces; we have

observed. Figure 6.12 shows temperature proﬁles of an interface formed by two
pieces of Bi2Te3 jointed by pressure contact and by conventional Sn/Pb solder,
respectively. A clear gap can be seen at the interface for the pressure contact
(Figure 6.12a) while it is almost insigniﬁcant for soldering contact (Figure 6.12b).
Determining ΔT, ΔTc, and Δx from Figure 6.12a,b with k = 1.5 W∕m K, the
thermal contact conductivity, kc, can be calculated using Eq. (6.10). The value
is 2.4 × 103 W∕m2 K for the pressure contact and 4.2 × 104 W∕m2 K for the
soldered contact. Compared with the data shown in Table 6.1, it is clear that a
satisfactory thermal contact can be achieved using soldered interface.

Summary
The contact theory described in this chapter provides a quantitative mea-
sure of the eﬀects of contact resistances (both electrical and thermal) on the
performances of thermoelectric devices. For a given acceptable percentage
reduction (from material performance to device performance), the required
contact properties can be determined, which provide crucial benchmarks for
module fabrication processes. In order to produce high-quality thermoelectric
devices, an initial step is to develop low contact resistance interfaces. This is
usually carried out experimentally by preparing a thermoelectric junction and
through subsequent characterization of the contact resistances. The method
and facilities employed for preparation of thermoelectric junction are discussed.
The technique for characterization of electrical contact resistance based on a
scanning resistance probe is described, together with experimental results to
demonstrate the usefulness and capability of the equipment.

Introduction
7.1.1
Moving from Materials to a Device
The eﬃciency of a thermoelectric device is always lower than that predicted
from the materials eﬃciency. This is due to diﬀerent parasitic resistances that
are introduced when forming a device, which consists of additional elements
apart from thermoelectric legs. In a typical thermoelectric device (also known
as thermoelectric module), a large number of n- and p-type semiconductor
legs are alternatively connected electrically in series by metallic strips, also
known as electrodes (see Figure 7.1). The intrinsic resistance of these strips and,
more signiﬁcantly, the contact resistance formed at the leg/electrode junction
contribute to the total ohmic resistance of the device, which is no longer just
the addition of the electrical resistances of the legs. A schematic variation of the
resistance proﬁle due to the diﬀerent contributions mentioned (leg, contact, and
electrode) can be observed in the resistance plot of Figure 7.1.
Apart from the electrodes, electrical insulator plates (usually ceramics) are
required (see Figure 7.1). The outer surface of these plates form the ﬁnal contact
with the heat sink and the heat source. Since the device performance depends
on the temperature diﬀerence reached at the sides of the thermoelectric legs
(positions 0 and LTE in Figure 7.1, with LTE being the length of the thermoelectric
leg) rather than the temperatures at the edges of the ceramic plates; a tempera-
ture drop (thermal resistance) is always present due to the ceramics, electrodes,
and the contacts. A schematic variation of the temperature proﬁle across the
ceramics, electrodes, contacts, and thermoelectric leg can be observed in the
temperature plot of Figure 7.1.
It is a challenge to study these parasitic losses and to minimize them as much
as possible. The most crucial part of a thermoelectric module is the electrode/leg

junction. A typical structure of this junction is shown in the circle of Figure 7.1.
A solder is commonly employed to provide the electrical contact between the
legs and the electrodes. For most thermoelectric materials the soldering process
is diﬃcult and/or the solders react with the legs along the device operation [1].
For these reasons, a metallization layer is required between the solder and the
legs (see circle in Figure 7.1). Its role is to improve solder wettability and block
the interdiﬀusion of atoms across the junction, which eventually could produce
the poisoning or degradation of the thermoelectric materials and thus worsen
their performance.
As remarked above, it is very important to obtain low electrical and thermal
contact resistance at the junctions, so the contact materials should possess high
electrical and thermal conductivities and the capability to be made very thin.
However, these are not the only requirements needed. In addition, contact mate-
rials should be stable at the high operating temperatures, provide mechanically
strong bonds and match the thermal coeﬃcient expansion of the thermoelectric
legs. The latter is a crucial requirement, since a signiﬁcant thermal expansion mis-
match is going to produce high interfacial mechanical stresses that will produce
fracture or cracks at the junctions, causing the increase of both electrical and
thermal contact resistances. This requirement is especially relevant for interme-
diate and high temperature modules where thermal stress is more acute. This and
the degradation of the legs due to interdiﬀusion at the junctions are usually the
main reasons for the degradation of device performance after continuous thermal
cycling (see Figure 7.2).
7.1.2
Diﬀerences in Characterization
Apart from the challenges in the device fabrication, characterization of thermo-
electric devices is also a tedious and challenging task. One of the main diﬃculties
when calculating device eﬃciency, given by the electrical power output divided
by the heat power input, is the accurate determination of the latter [3]. For this

reason, electrical power is typically provided rather than eﬃciency values, in the
literature and by module manufacturers.
Apart from electrical power output determination from current–voltage
curves at various temperature diﬀerences (ΔT), plots of the variation of the
open-circuit voltage and the total device electrical resistance with ΔT frequently
appear as well. Another important property of thermoelectric modules to be
characterized is their behavior under thermal cycling, since cracks and material
degradation can occur as previously mentioned, producing a performance
decline. For this purpose, the evolution of the parameters previously mentioned
(power output, open-circuit voltage, and total electrical resistance) with the
number of cycles can be found in the literature [4, 5].
Another relevant consideration when moving from materials to modules is the
signiﬁcance of the ﬁgure of merit Z, which is typically calculated under small
temperature gradients (ΔT < 10 K). Most of materials research is focused on
achieving high peak ZT, whereas thermoelectric devices operate under large tem-
perature gradients and a large average ZT in the temperature range of operation is
more important [6]. On the other hand, the module ﬁgure of merit z diﬀers from
the material’s Z. The former takes into account not only the electrical resistance
of the materials but also the parasitic electrical resistances (electrodes, contact,
and wires) that appear in the device.

7 Thermoelectric Modules: Power Output, Eﬃciency, and Characterization
7.1.3
Chapter Summary
Once the main concerns, problems, and challenges when moving from materials
to modules have been introduced above, the fundamentals and basic theory
describing the performance of thermoelectric modules operating in power
generation mode is presented in the rest of the chapter. The governing equations
concerning the particle and energy ﬂuxes are introduced ﬁrst in the next section.
Then the power output and eﬃciency of the device are derived. Finally, diﬀerent
experimental considerations, important to provide reliable characterization
results, are introduced.
7.2
The Governing Equations
7.2.1
Particle Fluxes and the Continuity Equation
In order to understand the physics behind thermoelectric phenomena, it is
important to know the particle and energy ﬂuxes in the materials (constitutive
equations) and how these ﬂuxes can be altered (continuity equations). Let us
start with the electronic (particle) ﬂux equations, which involve the ﬂow or car-
riers (electrons and/or holes). In a thermoelectric material, the electrical current
density J(x,t) can be expressed by the drift and diﬀusion contributions [7]. The
drift current Jdrift is due to the gradient of potential V(x,t), and the diﬀusion
current is induced by a gradient in the carrier concentration n(T,t) and/or a
gradient in the carrier’s velocity, governed by the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(T,t),
J = −𝜎𝜕V
𝜕x + q𝜕(Dn)
𝜕x
= −𝜎𝜕V
𝜕x + qn𝜕D
𝜕x + qD𝜕n
𝜕x ,
(7.1)
where x is the position in the material, t the time, 𝜎the electrical conductivity,
and q the elementary charge. It should be noticed that V is the potential at a
position x in the material and not a potential diﬀerence. The term ΔV will be
used in this chapter when referring to a potential diﬀerence for clarity.
Both D and n can vary with position when temperature is not uniform in
the material; hence Eq. (7.1) can be written as a function of their temperature
derivatives,
J = −𝜎𝜕V
𝜕x + q
(
n𝜕D
𝜕T + D 𝜕n

) 𝜕T
𝜕x = −𝜎𝜕V

(7.2)
reaching the generally adopted equation for the electrical current density (right
part of Eq. (7.2)) when −𝜎S is equal to the factor multiplying the T gradient in
Eq. (7.2), with S being the Seebeck coeﬃcient.
Equation (7.2) ﬁnally includes the drift ﬂux and a thermal-diﬀusion ﬂux Jthermal
with the temperature gradient as driving force. It should be noticed that these
ﬂuxes have opposite directions, and when J = 0 (open-circuit condition), they
cancel each other at any position (see Figure 7.3a). In other words, the carriers
being pushed by the temperature gradient induce an opposing electrostatic
force when they cannot ﬂow out through the external circuit, producing the
open-circuit voltage ΔV oc. When a load is connected at the external circuit

and the circuit is closed, the carriers are allowed to ﬂow out and the potential
gradient is then reduced, with the thermal current being extracted. The current
extracted increases as the load resistance RL is decreased, reaching a maximum
under short-circuit condition (RL ≈0, ΔV = 0), when the drift ﬂux goes to zero
(see Figure 7.3b).
It should be noted in Figure 7.3 that the ΔT is reduced at the short-circuit
condition with respect to the open-circuit. This is due to the existence of the

132
7 Thermoelectric Modules: Power Output, Eﬃciency, and Characterization
Peltier eﬀect when current ﬂows, which cools down the hot side and heats up
the cold side, decreasing to some extent the initial ΔT, and consequently reduc-
ing the Jthermal. Also note that by convention J represents the ﬂow direction of
the positive charges and the electrons ﬂow in the opposite direction as indicated
in Figure 7.3b. Also note that following the convention adopted in electronics,
the reference position for potential diﬀerence calculations is always located at
the position negatively charged. Consequently, the origin for the position (x = 0)
should also be placed at the negatively charged location. Otherwise, the direc-
tions of the ﬂuxes would be wrong.
The continuity equation for the electrical ﬂux is given by a conservation law,
which states that the total amount of charge carriers in the material has to be
conserved. Hence, the only way of varying the carrier concentration at a given
volume AΔx of the material, A being the cross-sectional area, after a Δt is by the
modiﬁcation of the charge carrier ﬂux,
qdn
dt = −𝜕J
𝜕x.
(7.3)
In Figure 7.4, it can be observed that the carrier density increases by one car-
rier after t + Δt as a consequence of the decrease in the carrier ﬂux at position x.
The carrier accumulated plus the two carriers ﬂowing out equal the three carriers
that initially entered the AΔx volume. By adding Eq. (7.2) into Eq. (7.3) and con-
sidering the materials properties independent of temperature, a new equation is
obtained,
q𝜕n
𝜕t = −𝜎𝜕2V
𝜕x2 −𝜎S𝜕2T

(7.4)
This equation indicates that variations of carrier density can only be achieved
by a variation of the voltage or thermal gradient with position.

Once the constitutive and continuity equations have been deﬁned for charge car-
riers, let us now identify the corresponding equations for the energy ﬂuxes in a
thermoelectric material and how they can vary with position producing energy
absorption or release. In the description, the notation JQ will be used for heat
ﬂuxes, that is, the amount of energy crossing a cross-sectional area per unit time,

given in W/m2. Heat generation or absorption produced in a unit volume of the
material per unit time, in W/m3, will be represented by Q.
Two contributions to the total energy ﬂux are typically identiﬁed in thermo-
electric materials,
JQ = −𝜆TE
𝜕T
𝜕x + STJ.
(7.5)
The ﬁrst term is the conductive heat ﬂux (Fourier law) and represents the con-
duction of heat from hot to cold parts within a material, which relates to the
thermal conductivity of the thermoelectric material 𝜆TE and the temperature gra-
dient. The second term, STJ, collects all the thermoelectric phenomena.
Deriving Eq. (7.5) versus position, the energy absorption/release processes
in the material can be identiﬁed. As in the continuity equation for electronic
current, the amount of energy in the material should be conserved. If a change
in the energy ﬂux is produced, it should be due to an absorption or release of
energy, in other words, an increase or decrease in temperature. To illustrate
this, Figure 7.4, employed for carriers, can be used. Just consider each circle as a
certain amount of energy instead of a carrier.

(7.6)
The last three terms of this equation indicate the diﬀerent ways in which the
energy ﬂux given by STJ can be varied. They will be analyzed now in detail.
Let us start by the analysis of the term where S varies with position (second
term at the right hand side of Eq. (7.6)). From this term the Peltier and Thomson
eﬀects can be deduced, as illustrated in Figure 7.5. When T is homogeneous in the
system and a current ﬂow exists, which could be the case right after the very ﬁrst
moment of applying a current to the system initially in equilibrium, only S varia-
tions occur at the junctions (positions 0 and LTE), owing to the diﬀerent Seebeck
coeﬃcients of the metal and the thermoelectric material. In this case, the ﬂux
very close to the left side of the junction x = 0 increases signiﬁcantly at the right
side very close to the junction, which due to energy conservation produces an
absorption of energy (cooling) equal to the diﬀerence between ﬂuxes (SM −S)TJ,
with SM being the Seebeck coeﬃcient of the metallic contact (see Figure 7.5a).
The physics behind this eﬀect, in a simplistic view, relates to the gain of energy by
each electron passing from an energy level in the metal to another level of higher
energy in the thermoelectric material [8].
On the other hand, at position x = LTE in Figure 7.5a the ﬂux signiﬁcantly
decreases from the left hand side close to the junction to the right hand
side, releasing heat (heating). This can be seen as the release of energy by the
electrons when crossing the junction and moving from an energy level in the
thermoelectric material to a lower energy level in the metal.
It should be noted that the heat ﬂuxes in Figure 7.5 are indicated by the hori-
zontal arrows, its length being given by the absolute value |STJ| and the direction

diﬀerence). (b) Under a T gradient S varies inside the thermoelectric material, which produces

adopted from the ﬁnal sign obtained in the product of the parameters S and J
(T is the absolute temperature and always positive). For a negative current and
n-type material (S < 0) a positive sign results and the ﬂux points toward the right,
indicating that the heat is pumped from left to right.
Let us now move to the case where the Seebeck coeﬃcient varies within the
material owing to the existence of a T diﬀerence (Figure 7.5b). This can take place
for example at steady-state condition after applying a constant current to the sys-
tem initially in equilibrium. Apart from the Peltier eﬀect at the junctions, now the
heat ﬂux STJ varies inside the material. For example, at position a, the heat ﬂux

7.2 The Governing Equations

is higher than at position b; thus, a release of an amount of heat (Sb −Sa)TJ has
to be produced. This release of heat occurs all along the extension of the material
(indicated by the white arrows in Figure 7.5b), and is known as the Thomson eﬀect,
QT = −TJ 𝜕S
𝜕x.
(7.7)
If the S of the material only depends on T, which is usually the case, then
Eq. (7.7) can be expressed as,
QT = −T dS
dT J 𝜕T
𝜕x ,
(7.8)
which is the most widely used equation for the Thomson eﬀect. It should be noted
that if the sign of the electric current is changed to positive and the temperature
gradient does not change its sign, the Thomson heat is not released but absorbed
in the bulk of the material.
After this analysis, somehow the Thomson eﬀect can be seen as an extension
of the Peltier eﬀect in the bulk of the material (distributed Peltier eﬀect), and
for this reason some authors consider that the Peltier eﬀect also takes place
in the bulk, apart from occurring at the junctions. It should be noted that the
heat released/absorbed at the junctions is much more signiﬁcant than the heat
absorbed/released in the bulk, since the variation of S is much smaller in the bulk
compared to that at the junctions. For this reason, Thomson eﬀect is typically
neglected and becomes only relevant at large ΔT.
Let us now pay attention to the term SJ𝜕T/𝜕x from Eq. (7.6). Using Eq. (7.2) for
the electrical current where the product S𝜕T/𝜕x appears,
SJ 𝜕T
𝜕x = −J 𝜕V
𝜕x −J2
𝜎.
(7.9)
Now two terms appear. The ﬁrst one is the electrical work, also expressed
usually as,
−J 𝜕V
𝜕x = JE,
(7.10)
where E = −𝜕V/𝜕x is the electric ﬁeld. The Joule heat generated in the material
by the electrical conduction of carriers (heat dissipation) is the other term.
Finally, the last term in Eq. (7.6), ST𝜕J/𝜕x, relates by means of Eq. (7.3) to
energy variations induced by changes in the carrier concentration (charge reorga-
nization). This term becomes zero and current becomes uniform at steady-state
condition, as a result of Eq. (7.3).
Hence, the variation of the energy ﬂux in the material can occur by variations
of heat conduction, the Peltier eﬀect, the Thomson eﬀect, the Joule heating, the
electrical work, and the reorganization of carriers,

equation, the variations of energy ﬂux in a material volume Adx, produced after

material,

(7.12)
In this equation, d is the mass density and Cp is the speciﬁc heat, deﬁned as
the amount of energy required to increase the temperature of a unit mass of
material by 1 K. It should be mentioned that heat transfer processes by convection
or radiation can also occur at the boundaries of the material, but they are not
considered in our analysis.
It can be noticed from Eqs. (7.11) and (7.12) that for a material initially at
thermal equilibrium (homogeneous temperature), it is not possible to change its
temperature unless an electrical current or heat input/removal is applied to it,
in other words, an external source of energy is required, which thus needs to be
added to the total energy balance. If an external electric ﬁeld is applied to the
system, then Eq. (7.12) becomes,
dCp
𝜕T
𝜕t = −

(7.15)
which is the main equation that will be used for the eﬃciency evaluation in the
next section. It should be noted that Eq. (7.15) is a second-order diﬀerential
equation; hence, it requires two additional boundary conditions to provide a
complete physical description of the system, as will be seen below.
7.3
Power Output and Eﬃciency
Characterizing thermoelectric devices in power generation mode typically
involves the use of a heater block attached to the top side of the module acting
as the heat source. Two diﬀerent ways of supplying energy to the heater can
be employed. On the one hand, the heater can be powered using a constant
power, provided by a power source or a variable transformer able to regulate
the power supply from the mains. In this mode, assuming that the conditions
of the environment do not change, a constant input heat ﬂux is applied on the
thermoelectric device, which does not change when a current ﬂow exists in the
system. However, changes in the hot and cold side temperatures can be produced
when electrical current is ﬂowing due to the Peltier eﬀect, which cools down the
hot side and heats up the cold side, leading to a decrease in ΔT with respect to
its open-circuit value.

7.3 Power Output and Eﬃciency
137
On the other hand, the heater can be powered by a power source with a tem-
perature controller, which adapts the power supplied to the heater in order to
maintain constant a set temperature. In this mode, when a decrease in the hot
side temperature is produced by the Peltier eﬀect under electric current ﬂow, the
controller increases the power supplied to the heater to maintain the hot side
temperature at the set value, so the heat input changes depending on the electric
current ﬂow. This is known as constant ΔT mode. Regarding eﬃciency measure-
ments the constant ΔT mode is less appropriate, since the heat input changes for
the diﬀerent levels of electric current and the losses produced by the Peltier eﬀect
become masked.
7.3.1
Power Output
Let us consider a thermoelectric device as that shown in Figure 7.1 formed by 2N
legs, with N being the number of n- and p-type semiconductor couples, under
steady-state conditions. The heat power input Qin reaching the module hot side
is considered to ﬂow without heat losses through the module. The amount of
Qin not converted into electrical power, Qout, leaves the device at the cold side
(see scheme of Figure 7.6a for a single couple). The material’s properties are con-
sidered independent of temperature (constant properties model) and have an
average value for the operating temperature range. They are also considered iden-
tical for both n- and p-type legs. The eﬀect of the ceramic and electrodes will not
be considered in the heat treatment.
Under these assumptions, the system delivers a certain amount of electric
power P when connected to a load. The power delivered to the load is given by
the product,

7 Thermoelectric Modules: Power Output, Eﬃciency, and Characterization
where I is the electric current and ΔV L the potential diﬀerence across the load,
ΔVL = IRL.
(7.17)
It can be seen from Eq. (7.17) that ΔV L and I, and hence P, vary when changing
the load resistance, which is a parameter that can be conveniently adjusted.
In order to identify the value of RL, which provides the maximum power for a
given device, I–ΔV L curves are typically recorded. They are performed from
the open-circuit voltage ΔV oc (RL →∞) to the short-circuit condition ΔV L = 0
(RL ≈0).
The open-circuit potential diﬀerence in the module is given by the addition
of the ΔV provided by each leg, as seen in Figure 7.6b for a couple. Note in this
ﬁgure that in the calculation the sign of the product S(TH −TC) has to be changed
when the reference position is not at the hot side (as a convention, the Seebeck
potential diﬀerence is measured with respect to the hot side), as occurs for the
n-type leg (see Figure 7.6b).
When the circuit is closed the open-circuit voltage of the module is dissipated
in the load resistance and in the total ohmic resistance of the thermoelectric
module, which includes contributions from materials, contacts, electrodes, and
wires,
2N|S|(TH −TC) = IRΩ + IRL.
(7.18)
The absolute average Seebeck coeﬃcient |S| is adopted instead of indepen-
dently considering the S values for the n- and p-type materials for simplicity. It
is worth mentioning that RΩ is usually known as the internal resistance of the
device, although some authors consider the internal resistance as just the addi-
tion of the intrinsic resistance of the thermoelectric materials, without including
the parasitic resistances (contact, electrodes, and wires contribution). To avoid
confusion, RΩ, which includes materials and parasitic contributions, is used in
this chapter.
From Eq. (7.18) the current can be determined as,
I = 2N|S|(TH −TC)
RΩ + RL
.
(7.19)
Introducing I from Eq. (7.19) and ΔV L from Eq. (7.17) in Eq. (7.16), the elec-
trical power as a function of RL results:
P = [2N|S|(TH −TC)]2
(RΩ + RL)2
RL.
(7.20)
If we introduce now the parameter m = RL/RΩ, then Eq. (7.20) becomes,
P = [2N|S|(TH −TC)]2
RΩ
m
(1 + m)2 .
(7.21)
In order to identify the value of RL, which provides the maximum power, keep-
ing the rest of parameters ﬁxed, the maximum power Pmax is achieved when
m = 1, that is, when RL = RΩ,
Pmax = [2N|S|(TH −TC)]2
4RΩ
.
(7.22)

7.3 Power Output and Eﬃciency
139
This equation predicts a parabolic relationship between Pmax and ΔT, which
experimentally is frequently found. However, it should be taken into account
that Eq. (7.22) is a quite ideal result which involves a signiﬁcant number of
assumptions, so deviations can be found. They can result for example from the
eﬀect of ceramics, the variation of the material’s parameters with temperature
and changes in the ΔT when RL is varied (constant heat input characterization
mode).
7.3.2
Eﬃciency
Employing the same assumptions as in the derivation of the power output for a
thermoelectric module, let us now focus on the calculation of the eﬃciency 𝜂of
the device, which is determined by the ratio between the electrical power output
and the incident heat power at the hot side (see Figure 7.6a),
𝜂= P
Qin
.
(7.23)
Since the equation for the power was already derived above (Eq. (7.21)), we only
need the incident heat power to complete the eﬃciency calculation, which can
be obtained from the energy balances at the sides of the thermoelectric legs (see
Figure 7.7),

7 Thermoelectric Modules: Power Output, Eﬃciency, and Characterization
Qin can be added to Eq. (7.25) using Qin = Qout + P. However, it is easier to use
Eq. (7.24). Note that the factor 2N is needed since Qin is applied to the whole
device and each leg participates in its balance. In addition, to ensure the right sign
of each term, heat inputs at the boundary are considered positive and outputs as
negative. For this purpose the Peltier term was made negative at x = 0 (since S
and I are positive), in addition to the heat conduction term at x = LTE (since the
T gradient is negative) and Qout. Once all terms have the appropriate sign, their
addition should be zero.
In order to obtain the T derivatives in the energy balances at the junctions (Eqs.
(7.24) and (7.25)) the heat equation (Eq. (7.15)) for one leg should be solved. For
simplicity the heat equation without Thomson heat will be considered,

7.3 Power Output and Eﬃciency

Note that the temperature gradient (Eq. (7.34)) diﬀers from the situation at
open circuit (I = 0) owing to the Joule eﬀect (0.5 I2Rleg). Consequently, the heat
removed by conduction from the junction (x = 0) is reduced by 0.5 I2Rleg with
respect to the open-circuit condition (no Joule eﬀect).
By dividing the power in Eq. (7.21) by the result of introducing Eq. (7.19) in Eq.

where Rp is the total parasitic resistance. If the parasitic resistance is neglected
(Rp = 0) then z becomes the material’s ﬁgure of merit Z,

(7.40)
In order to identify the value of RL, which provides the maximum eﬃciency, Eq.
(7.37) is derived with respect to m assuming the rest of parameters to be constant.
When the derivative is equal to zero, the optimum value of m is identiﬁed as,
mη =
√
1 + zTM,
(7.41)
where TM = 0.5(TH + TC) is the mean operating temperature. By introducing this

𝜂max = (TH −TC)

(7.42)
As a consequence of this equation, most research eﬀorts are focused on mate-
rials development (increase z) to improve the heat to electricity conversion eﬃ-
ciency. It is important to also take into account in Eq. (7.42) the Carnot eﬃciency
term (ΔT/TH), which highlights the importance of achieving a large ΔT in the
device, so the role of heat exchangers (heat management) to address a maximum
ΔT is also of signiﬁcant importance.
As remarked above for the maximum power derivation, Eq. (7.42) involves
a signiﬁcant number of assumptions that should be carefully considered when
accurate calculations are required. For example, if the peak Z of materials is intro-
duced instead of using in z the average material’s properties, much larger eﬃcien-
cies could be predicted that are not accurate.

7 Thermoelectric Modules: Power Output, Eﬃciency, and Characterization
It should be noticed that diﬀerent optimum values of RL were obtained when
pursuing for the maximum power (RL = RΩ) and eﬃciency (RL = RΩ(zTM + 1)0.5).
This means that given a fabricated thermoelectric device, where N, LTE, and A
are already ﬁxed, more power will be produced for the case when heat power
higher than Qin can be supplied. However, for a ﬁxed Qin, more power will be
produced in the maximum eﬃciency condition. It is worth mentioning that when
designing the device, N, LTE, and A are design parameters and not ﬁxed. If this is
taken into account for the identiﬁcation of the load resistance value that pro-
vides the maximum power, the result agrees with the eﬃciency optimization,
RL = RΩ(zTM + 1)0.5 [9].
7.4
Characterization of Devices
When facing the task of characterizing a thermoelectric device, it is important to
pay attention to multiple factors that can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence your results, most
of them related with thermal aspects (especially thermal contacts). A summary
of good practices to mitigate these issues as much as possible is provided in this
section.
7.4.1
Thermal Contacts
Only a small percentage of the total surface area of two solids brought into con-
tact is actually in contact, as seen in Figure 7.8. This is due to the roughness of the
materials that form peaks and valleys at a microscopic level. Consequently, most
of the contact zone comprises a large number of air gaps, which considerably
reduces the thermal conduction from one solid to the other. In order to improve
this situation, diﬀerent solutions can be implemented at the junction. One of the
most frequent approaches is to employ a thin layer of thermal grease or a heat
sink compound that will ﬁll in the air gaps. Although these compounds do not
usually present extraordinarily high thermal conductivities, they are able to trans-
fer heat much better than air. When using thermal grease it is very important to
just apply a very thin layer (only air gaps need to be ﬁlled). A thick layer could
worsen the heat transfer and be detrimental. Soldering or the use of liquid metals
that exhibit higher thermal conductivity than heat sink compounds can be also
Air gaps

adopted, although the latter are usually more expensive. The soldering process is
only possible in modules that present metallized ceramics.
Another common solution is to use a thin graphite sheet or thermal pads.
However, although these materials are quite ductile, they do not usually ﬁll in
the air gaps as eﬃciently as the thermal grease or the liquid metals and require
signiﬁcant pressure to achieve suitable thermal contact. In contrast, they can
perform better than thermal grease at high temperatures or vacuum conditions,
where evaporation of chemicals contained in the thermal grease could more
easily occur, producing dryness in the heat sink compound and hence worsening
the thermal conduction. If thermal grease is used under these conditions, it is
highly recommendable to clean and apply a fresh layer after each measurement.
If a copper block with inserted heater cartridges is used as the heat source, it
is recommendable to apply a tolerance in the diameter of the holes in the block
according to the expected thermal expansion of the heaters, especially at opera-
tion under large temperature diﬀerences. Spreading a very thin layer of thermal
grease on the cartridges is also beneﬁcial, especially when working in vacuum
conditions, in order to improve the contact between the surface of the heaters
and the copper block.
The clamping pressure in the characterization setup, which should be applied
uniformly, is also of considerable importance, since pressure improves the ther-
mal contacts and can signiﬁcantly increase the power output. However, pressure
should be carefully applied. A large pressure could produce cracks in the ther-
moelectric materials or at the junctions or even break the device. Module suppli-
ers usually provide recommended pressure values (typically around 1 MPa) that
should be checked to avoid damaging the device.
The ﬂatness of the surface of the ceramic layers is also key to the issue of ther-
mal contact. Some module manufacturers advise a tolerance of ±25 μm along
the whole surface area (e.g., www.customthermoelectric.com). In addition, the
surfaces should be clean and free from dirt and scratches.
7.4.2
Additional Considerations
The eﬃciency of thermoelectric modules from the electrical power supplied to
the heater is frequently estimated, assuming that heat losses do not take place
and that all the heat dissipated in the heater block is completely transferred to
the device. However, it is diﬃcult to achieve these conditions mainly because of
convective and radiative heat losses, which makes it diﬃcult to accurately mea-
sure the incident heat power Qin and hence the eﬃciency. Measurements under
vacuum can considerably minimize heat convection; however, radiation losses
are more diﬃcult to suppress. In this respect it is recommended to use heater
blocks of the same cross-sectional area as the thermoelectric device, which will
reduce radiation heat transfer toward the cold side area. In addition, providing
some kind of shielding around the heater block could be advantageous.
On the other hand, thermoelectric devices usually provide large currents; for
this reason, relatively thick wires are typically soldered to modules, which can
remove a signiﬁcant amount of heat especially in small modules. If thin wires
are soldered instead, they could not withstand the high current levels and, in

144
7 Thermoelectric Modules: Power Output, Eﬃciency, and Characterization
addition, they could increase the total ohmic resistance (internal resistance) of
the device and hence reduce the power output. A similar situation can occur if
thin long wires are used to contact the device with the measuring equipment that
records the current and voltage signals. The length and cross-sectional area of the
wire are proportional and inversely proportional, respectively, to its resistance.
In the case of tiny modules of a few couples, the total ohmic resistance could be
quite low and thus approach the order of magnitude of electrical contact resis-
tances. In this case, it is very important to perform a suitable soldering of the
wires to the module. If the device is tested without soldered wires it is prefer-
able to measure in a four-probe conﬁguration. On the other hand, it is important
to set the part of the module with the wires soldered at the cold side. Wires are
usually soldered with a solder diﬀerent from that employed for the legs, which do
not necessarily present a high melting point. Moreover, it should be taken into
account that usually the melting point of the solder is the parameter limiting the
maximum hot side temperature operation, so it is important to know its value.
Regarding the thermocouples that are generally employed to measure the dif-
ferent temperatures of the system, it is important to place them as close as pos-
sible to the ceramics. If they are inserted into holes or just physically touching
the ceramics, their tip should be surrounded with thermal grease to thermalize
them. Otherwise, only the part of the tip in contact with the object is at the actual
temperature. Thermocouples fabricated with very thin wires that can be inserted
directly at the interfaces of the ceramics with the heat source or heat sink are
ideal; however, they are quite diﬃcult to handle and easily break.
7.4.3
Constant Heat Input and Constant 𝚫T
At the beginning of Section 7.3, the two most frequently used methods to obtain
the I–ΔV curves from which the power output is extracted were explained. When
recording the I–ΔV curve it is important to wait until reaching the steady state
once the load resistance is varied. Changes in RL modify the current and hence the
Peltier eﬀect at the junctions, consequently varying the temperature diﬀerence
across the module. When measuring under the constant heat mode, establish-
ing the new ΔT will take time. On the other hand, in the constant ΔT mode the
temperature controller also needs some time to detect the temperature change
(usually the thermocouple controlling the T is placed on the ceramic or at a cer-
tain distance from it) and regulate the heat input to return to the set temperature.
If the I and ΔV values are recorded without waiting for these processes to be
completed, the results obtained will be misleading.
It is important to note that the slope of the I–ΔV curves recorded by these
two methods when both are starting from the same open-circuit voltage value
will diﬀer [10], as shown schematically in Figure 7.9a. In the case of the constant
ΔT method the slope provides the total ohmic resistance RΩ of the module at
the operating temperature range (see Figure 7.9a). For the constant heat input
mode, a larger resistance will be obtained and hence a lower power output. The
decrease of the temperature diﬀerence, (ΔToc −ΔTcc), where ΔToc and ΔTcc
are the open-circuit and closed-circuit steady-state T diﬀerences respectively,
reduces the initial open-circuit voltage ΔV oc and introduces an additional

contribution to the total ohmic resistance of the device, which can be seen
as a thermoelectric resistance RTE (see equivalent circuits of Figure 7.9b) and
modiﬁes the slope of the I–ΔV curve (Figure 7.9a).
This analysis demonstrates the importance of indicating the method employed
in the characterization of the device. It should be noted that the constant ΔT
method suppresses the thermoelectric resistance (intrinsic losses due to the
Peltier eﬀect) by introducing additional energy input in the system. Establishing
a comparison to the ﬁeld of photovoltaics, it would be similar to eliminate
recombination events in a solar cell by increasing the amount of incident light
during the evaluation of its power output, which discards one of the main losses
of the system.

Introduction
About 50–70% of potential thermal energy input to transportation and industrial
processes is dissipated to the environment. The wasted, but available, thermal
energy in both heavy and light duty vehicles and industrial processes opens up
an opportunity for eﬃcient energy recovery. The global energy eﬃciency could
be enhanced by recovering energy from the exhaust and coolant systems of the
vehicles and industrial processing plants.
Thermoelectric generation is one interesting and fast developing technology
that is able to directly convert a fraction of the available thermal energy into
electricity by means of semiconductor materials. This technology promises
low-maintenance and silent devices, the use of environmentally friendly mate-
rials, and the capability of high reliability recovery systems with potential
energy conversion eﬃciency near or greater than 10% with recent developments
in thermoelectric materials. In order to take advantage of newly developed
materials, a robust, high-performance, ﬂexible, and well-designed recovery
system that is able to tackle structural and thermal challenges is necessary.
Fundamentally, it is essential to have four basic components in a thermoelectric
generator (TEG) system to be able to harvest energy. Apart from the TEG module,
an electrical load, a heat source, and a heat sink are required to complete the
TEG system. Performance of the TEG system is highly dependent on the inter-
action of these components. To achieve a high-performance system with overall
eﬃciency close to conversion eﬃciency of thermoelectric materials, the compo-
nents need to be considered thermally interdependent in the system designs. This
chapter studies the eﬀect of the heat exchangers design on system performance,
and discusses the challenges through accurate analyses techniques while intro-
ducing proper cooling technologies.

Heat Exchanger Design – Consideration in TEG
Systems
An analysis of waste thermal energy indicates that there is a signiﬁcant
opportunity to partially recover the waste heat from industrial processing such
as steel and cement industries, glass processing, and paper processing [1]. Owing
to recent developments in advanced micro- and nanothermoelectric materials,
there is a massive amount of the industrial thermal energy that can be recovered
at a matched temperature with many thermoelectric materials.
Optimization of conversion eﬃciency of TEGs for a given set of thermoelec-
tric materials is widely discussed in detail, and is introduced as the following
well-known equation [2, 3]:

(8.1)
where T = (Th + Tc∕2) and ZT = 𝜎𝛼2T∕k represent the ability of a thermoelec-
tric material to eﬃciently produce electrical power, called ﬁgure of merit. In real
applications of heat recovery and thermoelectric power system design, the tem-
perature reservoirs of the heat source and heat sink are usually known rather than
the temperature of the hot and cold junctions of the thermoelements. Therefore,
it is problematic to estimate the best combination of the cold and hot junction
temperature of the thermoelements to evaluate the potential of the heat recovery
systems or to optimize the system eﬃciency or power density. Consequently,
the well-known basic relationships describing TEG performance based on the
temperature of the junctions, such as Eq. (8.1), needs to be developed accord-
ing to more sophisticated optimization processes and analysis in order to oﬀer a
most eﬃcient TEG in its system level. In order to create high-performance ther-
moelectric power generation systems, optimization of the TEG module requires
coupling with the heat exchangers optimal design.
Thermoelectric power generation systems have some advantages over other
types of waste heat recovery systems. TEG systems are silent, vibration free, reli-
able and compact with few or no moving parts. The purpose of heat exchangers
exclusively designed for the TEG systems could not only have signiﬁcant impact
on the system performance but can also play a critical role in relation to the
advantages of application of the TEGs in the recovery systems.
In order to reach predictable circumstances to maximize the system perfor-
mance, the heat exchangers should provide isothermal boundary conditions
on the hot and cold junctions of the TEG module. However, designing a heat
exchanger conﬁguration capable of providing isothermal interfaces and more-
over assisting in minimizing the overall system weight and volume is challenging.
Multiplying the overall heat transfer conductance by the heat transfer surface
area, UA, introduces an eﬀective heat exchanger design parameter, which in
general is a complex function of the structure of the heat exchanger, the type of
the ﬂuid exchanged, and the ﬂow condition in the heat exchanger.

where Rth,i includes all the convective thermal resistance of the ﬂow and all con-

In Eq. (8.3), h is the heat transfer coeﬃcient in the channels, Af is the total heat
transfer area of the heat exchanger, and 𝜂o is the overall surface eﬃciency of the
heat exchanger. For a surface without a ﬁn 𝜂o = 1. As the ﬁn is employed, the tem-
perature gradient along the ﬁn reduces the temperature eﬃciency of the extended
surface. A correction factor called ﬁn eﬃciency can help in taking into account
the thermal resistance of the ﬁns. The ﬁn eﬃciency for a straight, rectangular, and
low-thickness ﬁn with an adiabatic tip is [5]
𝜂ﬁn =

Accordingly, the overall surface eﬃciency of the heat exchanger is

Although evaluation of the overall ﬁn eﬃciency is straightforward, the heat
transfer coeﬃcient is a function of the channel dimension, Reynolds number, Re,
and the thermal properties of the ﬂuid in the heat exchanger.

8 Integration of Heat Exchangers with Thermoelectric Modules
A trade-oﬀbetween the maximum thermoelectric power generation and the
mass ﬂow rate in the heat sink represented by UA [6] shows that the maximum
power point increases with higher UA in the hot side heat exchanger. However,
power generation by TEG is limited to enhancement of the heat exchanger per-
formance for a given mass ﬂow rate in the hot heat exchanger. Improvement in
the heat exchanger performance is only useful when the mass ﬂow rate in the hot
heat exchanger is high. This condition could become a critical design factor as
cost constraints are considered in the system design.
The heat transfer coeﬃcient can be deﬁned as
h = Nu kf
Dh
(8.6)
where Nu is the Nusselt number, and Dh is hydraulic diameter of the channel by
Dh = 4A
P
(8.7)
In Eq. (8.7), A is the cross-sectional area of the channel and P is the wetted
perimeter in the channel.
Kays and London [4] categorized the Nusselt number for fully developed
velocity and temperature proﬁles in a laminar ﬂow regime based on the
cross-section shape of the channel. Incropera and Dewitt [5] presented the
Nusselt number for turbulent pipe ﬂow as follows:
Nu ∝Rem•Prn
(8.8)
where m = 0.5 −0.8 and n = 0.33 −0.4. The Prandtl number, Pr, is deﬁned as the
ratio of the momentum diﬀusivity of the ﬂow to its thermal diﬀusivity [7] and is
given as
Pr = 𝜗
𝛼
(8.9)
where 𝜗and 𝛼correspond to the kinematic viscosity and thermal diﬀusivity of
the ﬂow, respectively. The Reynolds number in a channel is generally given as
Re = inertial forces
viscous forces = 𝜌Dhv
𝜇
(8.10)
In Eq. (8.10), v is the ﬂuid velocity in the channel, 𝜌is the ﬂuid density, and 𝜇is
the ﬂuid dynamic viscosity.

Co-designing the thermoelements together with the thermal boundary condi-
tions for the speciﬁc applications and available heat transfer coeﬃcients can
also play an important role in improving the TEG module performance. For
a given heat transfer coeﬃcient and UA, dissimilar thermal conductivity of
the n- and p-type materials results in diﬀerent temperature distribution in the
thermoelements. The electrical resistance and the Seebeck coeﬃcient of the

materials, essential parameters in the power factor, are likewise coupled with
the temperature distribution in the thermoelectric materials aﬀected by the
imposed thermal boundary conditions.
For a uni-couple, the footprint area ratio of the n- and p-type thermoelements
is an important factor to maximize the power density. Geometry modiﬁcation of
the thermoelements associated with the UA may enhance the power generation
in the module considerably. Jang et al. [8] found that a reduction of the thermoele-
ment’s foot print area may decrease the power generation while the conversion
eﬃciency could improve.
For each stream in the heat exchanger, the convection heat transfer coeﬃcient
depends on the ﬂow properties, the temperature properties, and the type of the
coolant ﬂuid. Figure 8.2 shows n-type Mg2Si1−xSnx [9] and p-type Zn4Sb3 [10] as
two temperature-dependent thermoelectric materials considered in a study by
Rezania et al. [11]. The study includes the parametric optimization of the TEG
n/p footprint area ratios in conjunction with a practical range of the heat transfer
coeﬃcient to enhance the volumetric power generation in a TEG.
In contrast with the common studies about TEG optimization, which apply
constant temperature on the cold junction, the use of heat transfer coeﬃcient
values oﬀers more realistic thermal boundary conditions. In this case, the tem-
perature diﬀerence between the hot and cold junctions of the thermoelements
is diﬀerent for dissimilar materials. For instance, the smaller temperature
diﬀerence belongs to the n-type thermoelements, because of its higher thermal
conductivity. Hence, as shown in Figure 8.3, increasing the footprint area ratio
(An∕Ap) enhances the heat ﬂux across the uni-couple. A higher heat ﬂux leads to

a higher cold side temperature of the n-type thermoelement at a constant heat
transfer coeﬃcient that corresponds to a lower temperature diﬀerence of the
junctions in the thermoelement.
According to Figure 8.2, the Seebeck coeﬃcient of the uni-couple slightly
increases with the footprint area ratio; however, the temperature diﬀerence is
the dominant factor of the voltage generation in the uni-couple. Furthermore,
the total electrical resistance of the uni-couple shows a minimum value for a
speciﬁc ratio of the footprint area. Overall, power generation by a uni-couple
can be maximized by varying the footprint area ratio. At high values of
An∕Ap, the temperature diﬀerence in the thermoelements and, consequently,
the voltage generation, reduce with a sharper slope at lower heat transfer
coeﬃcients. Thus the maximum power generation shifts to a larger footprint
area ratio under high heat transfer coeﬃcient conditions. Figure 8.4 shows
that the maximum power generation occurs at An∕Ap = 0.23, 0.33, 0.45, 0.6,
for h = 50, 200, 500, 2000W∕K m2, respectively. The results indicate that the
optimal footprint ratio not only strongly depends on the electrical resistance of
the uni-couple but is also furthermore strongly coupled with thermal boundary
conditions, speciﬁcally at low values of the heat transfer coeﬃcient in the heat
exchanger. The optimal footprint area ratio needs to be similarly considered
in order to provide maximum conversion eﬃciency at the matched load con-
dition. The results show that an increase in the heat transfer coeﬃcient, and

consequently the heat ﬂow across the uni-couple, shift the maximum eﬃciency
to a smaller footprint area ratio.
Owing to the development of thermal boundary layers in channels of the heat
exchanger, the heat transfer coeﬃcient, which is high at the channel entrance,
decreases along the channel. Moreover, the mean temperature of the ﬂuid
decreases in the hot side heat exchanger or increases in the cold side heat
exchanger; thus the ﬂuid’s properties can change signiﬁcantly. Consequently,
evaluation of the UA in the ﬂow direction can be diﬃcult. The ﬂuid’s properties
can vary signiﬁcantly and have a critical impact on the UA evaluation and heat
exchanger performance as discussed above.
Figure 8.5 compares the variation of the cold junction temperature of ther-
moelements along two heat exchangers as the channels in the heat exchangers
have diﬀerent hydraulic diameters (Dh,ch#1 = 0.53 mm and Dh,ch#2 = 2.13 mm).
The heat exchangers provide the same average temperature diﬀerence between
the hot and cold junctions of the thermoelements that yield the same voltage
generation. In order to provide the same power generation, the mass ﬂow rate
in the larger channel needs to be more than the one in the smaller channel to
provide the same average temperature proﬁle ( ̇mch#1 = 0.002 (kg∕s) vs. ̇mch#2 =
0.005 (kg∕s)). On the other hand, as the hydraulic diameter of the channel
increases, the temperature proﬁle of the ﬂuid in the channels, and consequently
the cold junction temperature of the thermoelements, become more homoge-
neous in both the ﬂow direction and the width direction of the channel [12].

Cooling Technologies and Design Challenges
There are several types of ﬂuids, cooling modes, and designs of heat exchangers
that provide a vast range of heat transfer coeﬃcients and need complex methods
and models to predict the UA value along the heat exchanger. Depending on the
TEG application and the design of a proper heat exchanger, various types of gas
and ﬂuid with diﬀerent value for heat transfer coeﬃcient could be used in a heat
exchanger. Natural convection by air and water can yield a heat transfer coeﬃ-
cient up to 5 and 100 W∕m2 K in a heat exchanger, respectively. Maximum heat
transfer coeﬃcient by air forced convection ﬂow is 40 W∕m2 K, while water could
oﬀer up to h = 6000 W∕m2 K [13].
It is worthy to note that gas-based heat exchangers have low heat transfer
coeﬃcient and, therefore, low UA because of the low thermal conductivity and
Prandtl number of the gas. On the other hand, the UA value in a ﬂuid-based heat
exchanger is high owing to the high Prandtl number and thermal conductivity
of the ﬂuid. Generally, in heat exchangers with gas ﬂow, the conductive term
dominates the UA value while the convection term is the dominant factor in Eq.
(8.3) when using a ﬂuid.
Although it is quite important to design an eﬃcient heat exchanger with a high
UA among diﬀerent types of heat exchangers, it is furthermore critical to esti-
mate the pressure drop in the heat exchanger due to the interaction of the ﬂow
with the channel walls through friction. The pressure drop in a channel can be
characterized by the Darcy–Weisbach equation as follows:
Δpch = f (Re)• L
Dh
•𝜌
2
•v2
(8.11)

8.4 Cooling Technologies and Design Challenges
155
where f (Re) is the friction factor in the channel. According to Eq. (8.11), there is a
proportional relationship between the pressure drop and the hydraulic diameter
of the channel. For a given mass ﬂow rate, if the channel dimension is reduced in
order to enhance the eﬀective area of the heat exchanger and UA, the pressure
drop increases dramatically due to an increment in the ﬂuid velocity and a smaller
hydraulic diameter. Since the pressure drop has a proportional relationship with
the cooling energy required in the heat exchanger, the UA cooling energy must
be properly coupled for optimizing the TEG system.
In order to follow the developments in the ﬁeld of thermoelectric materials, the
heat exchangers, especially in advanced TEG systems, should be able to provide a
relatively high heat ﬂux (i.e., 10–100 W∕cm2) through the TEG module, while the
design analysis and process must still focus on providing light-weight, low-cost,
and compact heat exchangers.
There are various cooling technologies that could be considered for thermal
management of thermoelectric applications. One way to transfer heat from the
heat source is through heat spreaders that oﬀer a reliable and cost-eﬀective
method to dissipate the heat with their high thermal conductivity. In this method,
an intermediate conductive plate spreads the heat of hot spots from a small
surface to a larger surface. Hence, the heat spreaders are typically used for heat
sources with high heat ﬂux density where a secondary heat exchanger delivers
the heat to the ambient. This method oﬀers solutions when the secondary heat
exchanger is not eﬃcient, there is space restriction, less expensive material
is desired for the heat exchanger, or an air-cooling based heat exchanger is
preferred to be used instead of a liquid-cooled heat exchanger.
Traditional air-cooling techniques are not an eﬃcient and promising method
for high power density cooling applications. With acceptable noise levels, this
technology may transfer 1 W∕cm2 for a 60 ∘C temperature diﬀerence.
Piezoelectric fans are small solid-state devices that can operate with low power,
low noise, and can be used for thermal management in many thermal portable
devices. Acikalin et al. [14] reported that a piezoelectric fan could enhance heat
transfer coeﬃcient for 100%.
Heat pipes, which are a passive and indirect device, transport heat from a heat
source to a heat sink where the removed heat is rejected to the cooling environ-
ment by forced or natural convection. Since a heat pipe acts as a passive capillary
pump owing to its porous medium, it could provide thermal conductance up to
200 000 W∕m K; however, the heat transfer coeﬃcient of heat pipes is generally in
the range of 10−300 W∕m2 K. When using heat pipes in compact energy recovery
devices, it is worthy to note that the eﬀectiveness of a heat pipe decreases with the
reduction of its length. For instance, the performance of a heat pipe with length of
about 1 cm is comparable with a solid piece of copper. Loop heat pipes separate
the vapor and liquid paths and provide a much higher heat transfer coeﬃcient
compared to conventional heat pipes, 625 W∕m2 [15].
Liquid metal cooling oﬀers high heat transfer over 200 W∕m2 using a magneto-
ﬂuid dynamics pump, while, for instance, a 15 kPa pressure drop is required to
circulate 0.3 l∕min of working ﬂuid [16, 17]. Liquid metal has a much lower coef-
ﬁcient of thermal expansion compared to water and faces fewer problems in low
temperature. For example, Ga–Sn–In eutectics can remain in liquid phase at even
−19 ∘C.

FC-72-based immersion cooling, a direct cooling technology with a two-phase
ﬂow, can transfer 5−20 W∕cm2 of heat by natural convection. The heat ﬂux by
this technology could be enhanced up to 100 W∕cm2. Since this technology
works on the basis of natural convection, it would be limited to speciﬁc cooling
applications. Furthermore, water is an incompatible working ﬂuid in this
technology because of its electrical and chemical characteristics.
Cooling capacity close to 100 W∕cm2 has been achieved by liquid jet impinge-
ment technology with a 0.3 l∕min water ﬂow at 300 kPa. This ﬂow condition
requires 7 W of cooling energy [18]. Microjet technology could provide more
uniformity in the temperate proﬁle over the hot surface compared to microchan-
nel technology. However, this technology requires more fabrication steps and
relatively high cooling energy.
Spray cooling is an interesting candidate for thermal management of reduced
weight and dense system packaging [19], and could provide 160 W∕cm2 of heat
ﬂux [20]. In this technology, the liquid is broken up into ﬁne droplets imposed on
the hot surface. Therefore, the heated surface is cooled down by a combination
of thermal conductance between the liquid and the surface and by evaporation
at the liquid–vapor interface.
8.5
Microchannel Heat Exchanger
In order to provide a light-weight, low-cost and compact system, microchannel
heat exchangers are an interesting candidate for TEG application. A microchan-
nel heat exchanger contains several channels with typically 10–1000 μm
hydraulic diameter. In practice, miniaturization of the channel is limited to
creating a pressure drop that increases with the inverse of the second power of
the channel width.
According to Eq. (8.6), the very small channel dimension provides a signif-
icantly high heat transfer coeﬃcient. Furthermore, in a given heat exchanger
substrate area as in Figure 8.1, the small dimension of the channel allows to
increase the number of channels in the heat sink. The increment in the heat
transfer area and the heat transfer coeﬃcient enhances the UA of the heat
exchanger. Heat transfer coeﬃcient in an air-cooled microchannel can reach
up to 1000 W∕m2 K, while a well-designed water-based microchannel heat
exchanger is able to yield a 4000–10 000 W/m2 K heat transfer coeﬃcient.
A heat transfer coeﬃcient of 2500−5000 W∕m2 K has been measured in
carbon-dioxide-ﬂowing microchannels by Liao and Zhao [21]. Owing to the very
small channel hydraulic diameter, a high heat transfer coeﬃcient can be created
with a relatively low Reynolds number in most of the microchannels compared
to conventional large channels where the ﬂow regime stays laminar.
Owing to increasing demands for minimizing the weight and volume of TEG
systems with dissipation and accommodation of higher heat ﬂux on the heat
transfer junction, TEG systems require high-performance heat exchangers with
high heat ﬂow capability to reach their full performance potential. Microchannel
heat exchangers are capable of providing high UA and managing heat transfer
from TEG devices in a compact form (typically 10–20% of weight and volume

of comparable macrochannel heat exchangers). This technology is implemented
in TEG technology application. The eﬀectiveness of microscale heat exchangers
in TEG applications has been reviewed by Rezania and Rosendahl [22–24] and
Hendricks [25–27].
Since the pressure drop in a channel increases with the inverse of the
second power of the channel width, there is a mutual misunderstanding that a
microchannel heat exchanger requires high cooling energy due to the creation
of a high pressure drop in the heat exchanger. In fact, a study by Wang and
Holladay’s [28] showed that the created pressure drop in a microchannel heat
exchanger may not be higher than the one in a macrochannel heat exchanger
for a given heat transfer performance if the microchannel heat exchanger is
properly designed. Kandilikar and Upadhye [29] claimed to reach a 300 W∕cm2
power density for a ﬂow rate of 1.5 l∕min at a 24 kPa pressure drop. Furthermore,
Colgan et al. [30] reported the implementation of silicon microchannel coolers
for a heat transfer density of 400 W∕cm2 at 24 kPa for 1.2 l∕min. A comparison
between the jet impingement and microchannel technologies [31] indicates
that the microchannel heat exchanger is more eﬃcient for a heat exchange area
smaller than 7 × 7 cm2.
8.6
Coupled and Comprehensive Simulation
of TEG System
A coupled optimization analysis with detailed information of the TEG system
behavior can aid the eﬀectual selection of the design parameters and objective
functions. The ANSYS Workbench analysis software package has the capability
to solve the TEG diﬀerential equations while coupling them with hot and cold
side heat exchangers. By using the ﬁnite volume technique to nodalize the TEG
elements for given details of the heat exchanger interfaces and structure, and by
entering mass ﬂow rate and boundary conditions, a set of simultaneous equations
for heat and current ﬂows and temperatures can be solved.
8.6.1
Governing Equations
Thermoelectric modules, heat exchangers, and coolant ﬂow elements can be inte-
grated by applying the ﬁnite volume technique to couple the energy conservation,
the continuity, and the heat ﬂow equations:

The coupled heat ﬂow and the continuity of electric charge equations that
include Joule heating and Seebeck and Thomson eﬀects are [32]
⃗q = T •[𝛼]•⃗J −[k]•∇T
(8.14)
⃗J = [𝜎]•(⃗E −[𝛼])•∇T
(8.15)

where Eq. (8.16) is a constitutive equation for a dielectric medium. Under
steady-state condition, the electric ﬁeld is irrotational and the system-coupled
equations can be expressed as follows [33]:
∇•(T •[𝛼]•⃗J) −∇•([k]•∇T) = ̇q
(8.17)
∇•([𝜎]•[𝛼]•∇T) −∇•([𝜎]•⃗E) = 0
(8.18)
The electric power spent on work against the Seebeck ﬁeld and on the Joule
heating is included in the heat generation rate per unit volume ( ̇q) in Eq. (8.17).
A thermal boundary layer develops over a surface when the ﬂuid free stream
and surface temperatures diﬀer. Near the wall, the velocity of the cooling ﬂuid is
principally zero and the local heat transfer between the wall and the ﬂuid can be
calculated as pure conduction:

(8.19)
where n is the local coordinate normal to the wall. On the other hand, by Newton’s
law of cooling, the convective heat transfer between the heat exchanger plate and
the ﬂuid can be expressed as:
q′′ = hf(Ts −Tf)
(8.20)
In the ﬂuid, by considering the motion of single-phase ﬂuids, that is, either
liquid or gas, conservation of mass for constant density is simpliﬁed to
∇• ⃗V = 0
(8.21)
To calculate the velocity and temperature distribution for a laminar regime, the
following momentum and energy equations need to be solved [34]:

(8.23)
where ⃗f is the body force per unit of the ﬂuid mass and cp represents the speciﬁc
heat of the ﬂuid at constant pressure. The last term in Eq. (8.23) is the work done
against viscous forces that is irreversibly converted into internal energy called
dissipation function.
Figure 8.6 shows the geometric conﬁguration of a TEG module with a cold side
heat exchanger. The image shows a cross-sectional view of the device along the
ﬂow direction. By coupling the thermoelectric governing equations and the heat
transfer equations in the heat exchanger, interactions among the entire system
elements can be predicted and calculated.

diﬀerences at diﬀerent locations of the thermoelements when the ﬂow condition
changes in the heat exchanger. For a constant heat ﬂux on the hot side ceramic

substrate, the average temperature of the thermoelements at lower mass ﬂow
rate is higher than the case when higher mass ﬂow rate cools the TEG. As the
ﬂow rate increases in the heat exchanger, the heat resistance of the ﬂow reduces
and transfers higher rates of heat. Therefore, for the mentioned pressure drops
in the heat exchanger, the coolant ﬂuid temperature at the channels inlet is
closer to each other than the one in the channel outlet. Consequently, the local
temperature diﬀerence is smaller for the thermoelements at the beginning of the
heat exchanger compared to the thermoelements located at the end of the heat
exchanger.
As shown in Figure 8.8, due to the high heat transfer coeﬃcient and the
eﬀect of the channels’ entrance geometry, the ΔTteg is higher for the ﬁrst legs
(legs #4 and #5) in the coolant ﬂow direction. The temperature of the coolant
ﬂuid increases along the channel because of the heat absorption. Depending on
the design of the thermoelements’ location, ΔTteg can be also diﬀerent in the
cross-direction of the ﬂow. In the conﬁguration shown in Figure 8.8, the cooling
eﬀect is more eﬃcient than at the middle of the heat exchanger, and the ΔTteg
is higher for the thermoelements located at the edge compared to the elements
at the middle of the module. Moreover, the applied heat ﬂux at the end of the
substrate along the ﬂow direction causes a higher heat ﬂow rate to cross through
the legs and enhances ΔTteg in the thermoelements.
At a high mass ﬂow rate, most of the heat that crosses through the TEG is
absorbed where the legs are located. Therefore, there is a ﬂuctuation in the
channel surface temperature along the heat exchanger. A lower cooling energy
causes a higher thermal resistance in the microchannel heat exchanger [35].

When the mass ﬂow rate decreases, the heat absorbing capacity of the coolant
ﬂow reduces, and the heat crosses through the thermoelements and diﬀuses
in the heat exchanger substrate. Consequently, the heat removal ability of the
heat exchanger decreases at the area under the thermoelements. The remaining
region of the heat exchanger also plays a signiﬁcant role in removing the heat.
Thus, the increment in the temperature proﬁle in the heat exchanger becomes
more uniform. The temperature of the coolant ﬂuid in the channels with lower
mass ﬂow rate raises sharper than the one in the higher mass ﬂow rate case
owing to the absorption of a higher amount of the heat per mass ﬂow rate (Q∕̇m)
along the channel.
The rate of exchanged heat between the heat exchanger and TEG can further-
more be measured via calculation of the added thermal energy to the ﬂow in the
heat exchanger by taking the energy balance in the heat exchanger:
QHX = ̇mcf(To −Ti)
(8.24)
Figure 8.9 shows the mass ﬂow rate distribution and heat removed by the
microchannels for three sample pressure drops in the heat exchanger. The
mass ﬂow rate distribution in the channels is aﬀected by the inlet/outlet
plenums of the heat exchanger. The heat removed by any channel in the heat
exchanger, which not only depends on the design of the inlet/outlet plenum, is
mostly aﬀected by the arrangement of the thermoelements placed in the heat
exchanger [22]. At low pressure drops, the inlet plenum design creates a uniform
distribution of the mass ﬂow rate in the channels. The minimum mass ﬂow
rate takes place at the channels at edge of the heat exchanger (channel #1 in

Figure 8.6), and the maximum ﬂow rate at the middle channels. As mentioned,
the heat diﬀusion in the substrate plate of the heat exchanger causes a uniform
temperature distribution through the channels. Therefore, the arrangement of
the thermoelements does not aﬀect the heat transfer performance of the heat
exchanger at low mass ﬂow rates. Thus, the channels containing higher mass
ﬂow rate remove a higher rate of heat. Figure 8.9 indicates that the eﬀect of the
arrangement of the thermoelements and the inlet plenum design are both sig-
niﬁcant for the heat transfer performance of the heat exchanger at high pressure
drop ﬂows.
The proﬁles of mass ﬂow rate distribution in the channels change as pressure
drops vary. At middle range of pressure drops, Δp = 2 kPa for an instance, the
channels at the heat exchanger edge carry higher thermal energy ratio, because
there is still thermal diﬀusion in the heat exchanger substrate. At higher pres-
sure drop cases, Δp = 50 kPa for an instance, higher rate of the thermal energy is
removed by the channels underneath the thermoelements (channels #1, #2, and
#3) than by the channels located between the thermoelements (channels #5 and
#6), even though these channels have a higher mass ﬂow rate compared to the
channels closer to the heat exchanger edge.
8.6.3
Modiﬁed Channel Conﬁguration
According to Figure 8.9, the channels located between the thermoelements
have minor cooling eﬀect in the heat exchanger, especially at high mass ﬂow
rate conditions, and remove less heat than the channels that are underneath
the thermoelements. Therefore, removing the channels that are not as eﬀective
might help reduce the coolant ﬂuid mass ﬂow rate and the cooling energy in the
heat exchanger. Figure 8.10 shows the modiﬁed heat exchanger conﬁgurations
studied by Rezania and Rosendahl [23] in order to reduce the required cooling
energy. In the design of HX#1 in Figure 8.6, the thickness of the channel wall
is equal to channel width, while in HX#2 and HX#3, the number of channels is
reduced by an increment in the channel wall thickness. HX#1, HX#2, and HX#3
contain 22, 16, and 8 active channels, respectively [23].
The lowest thermal resistance among the considered heat exchangers belongs
to HX#1 since it has more active channels. On the other hand, because the mass
ﬂow rate in the HX#1 is the highest among the heat exchangers, this conﬁgu-
ration needs the highest cooling energy. In HX#2 and HX#3, as the number of
the channels decreases, while maintaining a constant pressure drop, the mass
ﬂow rate and cooling energy are reduced, but the thermal resistance is higher.
Figure 8.11 illustrates that in conﬁguration HX#2, the thermal resistance did not
diﬀer much from conﬁguration HX#1, especially at high pressure drops. Never-
theless, the cooling energy in conﬁguration HX#2 is lower than in conﬁguration
HX#1. Thus, this conﬁguration can be an eﬃcient replacement to be used in TEG
systems. This advantage is due to the tailored distance between the thermoele-
ments. Clearly, an optimal design of the heat exchanger conﬁguration can be
further optimized as the design of the TEG changes. In comparison with con-
ﬁguration HX#1, the HX#2 and HX#3 conﬁgurations reduce the cooling energy
by 19% and 51%, respectively.

Flat-Plate Heat Exchanger versus Cross-Cut Heat Exchanger
The design of the heat exchanger signiﬁcantly aﬀects the temperature distribu-
tion in the thermoelements and, therefore, the power generated by the TEG. The
open-circuit voltage in a TEG uni-couple is deﬁned as
voc = n𝛼(Th −Tc)
(8.25)
and the current in the TEG circuit can be expressed as
I = n𝛼(Th −Tc)
R + Rl
(8.26)
where the parameter Rl is the input resistance of the load circuit. The average
Seebeck coeﬃcient of the uni-couple in Eqs. (8.25, 8.26) is given by Decher [36]:
𝛼=

(8.27)
The TEG power generation at the load is deﬁned as
Pteg = I2Rl
(8.28)
The required cooling power in the heat exchanger is related to the pressure
drop and the volumetric ﬂow rate and can be calculated as follows:
Pcooling = Δp ̇V
(8.29)
The pressure drop in the heat exchanger is an important factor that inﬂuences
the net power of the TEGs. The net power supplied by the TEGs is therefore
Pnet = Pteg −Pcooling
(8.30)
Diﬀerent types and designs of heat exchanger have diﬀerent advantages and
disadvantages. For example, in a comparison between plate-ﬁn and cross-cut
heat exchangers, plate-ﬁn heat exchangers are easily fabricated and produce small
pressure drops [37], while the pin-ﬁn heat exchanger can provide high heat trans-
fer rates [38] due to the advantage of redeveloping the ﬂow region. Kim et al.
[39] showed that to determine the eﬀectiveness of these heat exchangers, both
the required cooling energy and the length of the heat exchangers need to be
considered.
In general, pin-ﬁn heat exchangers are recommended for applications requiring
high cooling energy in a small length of the heat exchanger, while plate-ﬁn heat
exchangers have better performance when the heat exchanger has a larger length
and needs to provide small range of cooling energy. Cross-cut heat exchangers
are superior for operations in the relatively middle range of cooling energy and
heat exchanger length [40]. Figure 8.12 shows the conﬁguration of a plate-ﬁn
heat exchanger and a cross-cut heat exchanger with Dh = 75 μm applied on a
TEG module, indicating the symmetric calculation domain that is a quarter of
the device [24]. In contrast to the HX#2 design in Figure 8.10, a modiﬁed design
of the ﬁns under the thermoelements is studied in order to make a comparison
between the heat exchangers for reducing the required cooling energy and for
maximizing the net power output from the TEGs.

Microchannel heat exchangers contain several channels in contrast to typical
heat exchangers with larger scale channels that make it diﬃcult to achieve a
constant temperature or a constant heat ﬂux on the channel walls. Conduc-
tive heat transfer in the axial direction of the ﬂuid ﬂow on the substrate of
heat exchangers with microscale dimensions may have a strong inﬂuence on
the heat patterns in the heat exchanger, especially at low Reynolds number
conditions [41]. Therefore, conjugate heat transfer eﬀect should be accounted
for in the microchannel heat exchangers. At low Reynolds number condition,
the heat diﬀuses into the substrate of the cross-cut heat exchanger where
no ﬁn is designed. Therefore, the thermal performance of the cross-cut heat
exchanger and, consequently, the power generated by the TEG reduce with the
low ﬂow inlet velocity conditions. However, the voltage generation does not
drop signiﬁcantly since the used coolant ﬂuid is water, which has a relatively
high speciﬁc heat capacity.
As Figure 8.13 shows, the cooling energy in the heat exchanger can be compa-
rable with the power generated by the TEG if the cooling design parameters are
not carefully considered. A mismatched cooling energy in a heat exchanger for
low temperature diﬀerence conditions in the TEG can be higher than the power

generated by the TEG, resulting in a negative net power. The negative impact
of high coolant mass ﬂow rate on the heat exchanger that results from this is
furthermore shown experimentally by Rezania et al. [42].
Therefore, the range of applied mass ﬂow rate or ﬂow velocity needs to
be carefully considered to avoid a negative net power. As the inlet velocity
decreases, the power generation reduces and a lower cooling energy due to the
lower pressure drop in the heat exchanger is generated. There is an optimal ﬂow
inlet velocity that oﬀers the maximum net power. A critical parameter to deﬁne
power generation in the TEG is the temperature diﬀerence between the hot and
cold junctions. One way to control the cold junction temperature in higher hot
junction temperature applications is to enhance the ﬂow velocity in the heat
exchanger. Although higher ﬂow inlet velocity raises the cooling energy, it allows
to create a higher temperature diﬀerence between the junctions.
Kim et al. [40] showed that for a heat exchanger with large dimension-
less length, log(LHX∕Dh), and small dimensionless required cooling energy,
log{Pcooling∕[𝜇3∕(𝜌2Dh)]}, the plate-ﬁn design has a better performance
than the cross-cut heat exchanger design. According to the heat exchanger
design parameters shown in Figure 8.12, log{Pcooling∕[𝜇3∕(𝜌2Dh)]} < 11.35 for
log(LHX∕Dh) = 1.03, which reassures that using a plate-ﬁn heat exchanger will
yield an enhanced performance. The plate-ﬁn heat exchanger oﬀers better
thermal performance and higher net power at low ﬂow rates, although it
requires higher cooling energy for a given ﬂow rate compared to the cross-cut
heat exchanger. At high ﬂow rate conditions, where the eﬀect of cooling energy
is signiﬁcant, although the thermal performance of the plate-ﬁn heat exchanger

8.6 Coupled and Comprehensive Simulation of TEG System
167
is slightly superior, the required cooling energy is relatively high. Therefore, a
TEG with a cross-cut heat exchanger oﬀers higher net power at high ﬂow inlet
velocity. The variation of the power generation in the TEGs and of the required
cooling energy in the heat exchangers with the ﬂow inlet velocity indicates that
the overall maximum net power is equal for both TEGs using a with cross-cut
heat exchanger and a plate-ﬁn heat exchanger.
8.6.5
Eﬀect of Channel Hydraulic Diameter
The thermal resistance of the heat exchanger and the pressure drop through the
heat exchanger are important factors to take into account for the optimization
of the heat exchanger design. The heat transfer in the heat exchanger can be
enhanced as the channel hydraulic diameter decreases and, consequently, the
number of channels and the eﬃciency of the surface heat transfer increases.
A smaller hydraulic diameter, however, causes a higher pressure drop in the
channels and raises the cooling energy required in the heat exchanger. Channels
with rectangular cross section have a higher heat transfer coeﬃcient compared
with trapezoidal and triangular shaped microchannels [43]. Channels with
rectangular cross section give minimum thermal resistance when the channel
width and the ﬁn thickness are equal [44]. The channel hydraulic diameter can
be optimized over the practical range of Reynolds number to yield a maximum
net power output in the TEG device.
Rezania et al. [45] made a parametric study on the channels to evaluate the
eﬀect of the hydraulic diameter on the system performance (shown in Figure 8.6).
Four diﬀerent channel sizes with Dh = 900, 450, 150, 50 μm are considered. The
channel dimensions (width and height) and the ﬁn thickness are equal. Therefore,
the number of channels in the applied heat exchangers for the ﬁxed substrate area
according to the hydraulic diameters is 4, 8, 24, and 72 channels, respectively, and
the heat exchangers are called N4, N8, N24, and N72, correspondingly. The hot
side temperature of the TEG module was ﬁxed at 400 K.
For a given Reynolds number, the thermal resistance of the heat exchanger
decreases with the channel hydraulic diameter. A smaller thermal resistance
increases the temperature diﬀerence between the hot and cold junctions of
the thermoelements and enhances the voltage generation. In case of using a
low heat resistance coolant ﬂuid (Rheat = 1∕̇mCp) such as water, the TEG cold
junction temperature remains close to the ﬂow inlet temperature after a speciﬁc
value of applied Reynolds number. Therefore, the power generation in the
TEG increases slightly with the Reynolds number at high Reynolds number
conditions. In contrast, an increment of the pressure drop in the channel yields a
higher cooling energy. As Eq. (8.10) expresses, a higher Reynolds number means
a higher ﬂow velocity and, consequently, a higher mass ﬂow rate in the channels.
Since the cooling energy is dependent on both of these parameters, the cooling
energy can be signiﬁcantly increased at greater Reynolds number conditions,
and even generate a negative net power output as shown in Figure 8.14. There-
fore, the limits of the Reynolds number for channels with diﬀerent hydraulic
diameters need to be carefully deﬁned to avoid a negative net power output in
the system.

For each design of heat exchanger, there is an optimal Reynolds number that
maximizes the net power. Figure 8.14 shows that the optimal Reynolds num-
ber decreases as the hydraulic diameter of the channels reduces. The optimal
Reynolds number for the studied heat exchangers N72, N24, N8, and N4 are
Re = 50, Re = 200, Re = 500, and Re = 1000, respectively.
According to Eq. (8.1), the power generation in a TEG depends on both the
module’s eﬃciency and the heat ﬂux across the TEG. As the Reynolds number
increases in the heat exchanger, both these parameters increase.

Power–Eﬃciency Map
The optimization techniques of the TEG systems coupled with the heat transfer
throughthe system using amaximum eﬃciency–powermap forwaste heat recov-
ery applications oﬀer maximum eﬃciency with only a small power penalty for a
high speciﬁc power performance of the TEG system. Numerical optimization of
the TEG design at the system level was demonstrated by Rezania et al. [46]. The
coupled optimization functions were deﬁned to solve the multiparameter design
problems in the applied microchannel heat exchanger to maximize the output
power and the cost performance of generic TEG systems. This multiparameter
optimization model can contribute to better understanding of the relations
between critical system design parameters. Critical design variables such as
channel width, channel height, and ﬁn thickness of the heat exchanger along with
the ﬁll factor of TEG were theoretically optimized over a wide range of cooling
energy in the heat exchanger. The results illustrate that, for any cooling energy,
there are particular channel widths and ﬁn thicknesses that oﬀer a maximum

output power in the TEG. The model is able to predict the eﬀect of substrate
thickness variation on an optimal design of the heat exchanger parameters and
ﬁll factor of the TEG. Furthermore, a relationship between the optimal cooling
energy and the maximum performance cost of the system is achieved.
Hendricks et al. [47] performed a system-level design performance analysis of a
TEG system subjected to appropriate thermal boundary conditions based on the
characterization of the UA of the hot side heat exchanger. The results were pre-
sented as eﬃciency–power maps over a range of created temperature diﬀerences
across the TEG and external load resistances. This analysis of the results provides
a quick evaluation to track the system maximum power points and maximum
eﬃciency depending on various critical design parameters and operating condi-
tions. Furthermore, because in this analysis the exhaust temperature and ambient
cooling temperature are ﬁxed instead of the TEG hot and cold junction temper-
atures, both the maximum power and maximum eﬃciency occur at an external
resistance ratio greater than 1. The internal resistance of the TEG module is
conducted as a function of the variation of the TEG hot and cold junction
temperatures with variation of the external resistance, and proposed Eq. (8.31)
as the system optimal resistance, leading to a maximum power generation point:
Rl,opt = n•Ri +
2•Rl,opt
•(n•Ri + Rl,opt)
ΔT
•𝜕(ΔT)
𝜕Rl
(8.31)
Equation (8.31) generates a quadratic relationship for Rl,opt, and can be explicitly
solved for the given design parameters and thermal boundary conditions
aﬀecting ΔT. This equation conﬁrms that the external resistance that gives a
maximum power point in heat recovery application is greater than the internal
resistance of the TEG module.
8.8
Section Design Optimization in TEG System
The temperature of the exhaust streams in waste heat recovery applications
could be high. If applied, heat exchangers would be able to keep the cold side
temperature of the TEG modules low, so the exhaust hot ﬂow through the
heat exchangers can experience a relatively large temperature drop along the
heat exchanger. Temperature drops of the hot gas in the heat exchanger due to
transfer of thermal energy from the hot gas to the TEG modules could reduce
the heat transfer rate from the hot gas to the next TEG module along the heat
exchanger. Consequently, the temperature diﬀerences between the hot and cold
junctions of the TEG modules decreases along the heat exchanger so that each
module has a higher temperature diﬀerence than the next TEG module along
the ﬂow in the system. In this case, an optimal TEG module designed for a
speciﬁc operating temperature of the heat source and ambient does not have a
maximum performance for all the modules placed along the heat exchanger.
Therefore, an advanced design technique of the TEG system should be utilized,
which is referred to as “section design.” This technique provides an optimum TEG
system design depending on the temperature variation of the hot gas in the heat
exchanger.

170
8 Integration of Heat Exchangers with Thermoelectric Modules
The number of sections depends on the magnitude of the available overall
temperature diﬀerence between the hot gas ﬂow and the ambient. Crane
et al. [48] indicated that the maximum number of sections is limited to about
three considering the cost and system complexity issues. Optimization of the
sections number based on a particular temperature and heat ﬂux range in
the hot gas ﬂow direction helps avoid a mismatch in the TEG design [49].
There are complex design trade-oﬀs associated with the power generation. The
eﬃciency and the heat transferred in each section must be fully and carefully
evaluated to achieve an optimum overall performance in a given energy recovery
application.
8.9
Conclusion
Thermoelectric heat recovery systems have signiﬁcant potential to enhance
the eﬃciency of industrial and automotive thermal systems, by conversion
of the waste heat into useful electrical energy through optimal design of
high-performance and advanced TEG recovery systems. Proper design of a
TEG system involves design optimization processes wherein the critical system
components such as the TEG module and the heat exchangers are thermally
coupled. This chapter provides a multidisciplinary optimization guide for maxi-
mizing the power generation and eﬃciency of the TEG system. The optimization
techniques discussed in this chapter draw a map for future studies seeking a
solution to achieve a high-performance TEG system by addressing the critical
design parameters and their impact on the system overall performance.

Introduction
In textbooks and scientiﬁc publications the load of thermoelectric modules is
often presented by a resistance in order to simplify. However, in real applications
the load is very seldom a pure resistance, but has its own speciﬁc voltage–current
relationship depending on the speciﬁc case. A power electronic converter makes
it possible to connect thermoelectric modules to a load with other voltage and
current ratings than the thermoelectric modules [1–8]. This means that the
thermoelectric module can charge a battery, power an electric machine, light a
bulb, and so on. In Figure 9.1, it is seen how the power electronic converter is
inserted between the thermoelectric modules and the load. Another important
property of a power electronic converter is controllability. In order to protect
either the thermoelectric modules or the load, the module current can be
adjusted very quickly to the preferred value. Moreover, even though the input
heat power changes or the load varies, the power electronic converter ensures
that the module operates at its maximum power point. In this chapter, the main
principles of power electronic converters and their control in thermoelectric
applications will be given. At the end of the chapter, a case study will be presented
where the theory and methods presented will be applied.
9.2
Building Blocks of Power Electronics
Many power electronic converters exist with diﬀerent advantages and disadvan-
tages. However, the converters consist of the same fundamental components,
which will be presented in this section.
The three basic passive components are the resistor, inductor, and capacitor.
Their main properties are shown in Figure 9.2. In power electronic converters
resistances should be minimized as they generate loss. The two other passive
components, that is, the inductor and capacitor, both have the feature of being
able to store energy. Owing to the integral part it plays in the voltage–current

relationship, the inductor has a smoothing eﬀect on the current and the capacitor
has a smoothing eﬀect on the voltage.
Another inductive component is the transformer. A transformer basically con-
sists of two or several inductors magnetically connected to the same magnetic
core. Several electric circuit models of the transformer exist, but the most well
known is that of the ideal transformer shown in Figure 9.3. The ratio of the input
and output voltage and current are determined by the ratio of the number of
turns between the input and output sides of the transformer. This means that it is
possible to connect a low-voltage input to a load with a very high voltage or the
opposite. Owing to the magnetic coupling between the input and output sides of
the transformer, the output and input are electrically isolated from each other,
which, from a safety point of view in many applications, is a valuable feature.

Figure 9.3 Characteristics of the transformer, diode, and switch.
It should be mentioned that the transformer only is able to transfer power of
alternating current (AC) type between the input and output sides. If direct cur-
rent (DC) is applied to the transformer the magnetic ﬂux 𝜙of the magnetic core
is constant. As the induced voltage is proportional to the derivative of the ﬂux,
that is, V2 = N2
d𝜙
dt , the induced voltage will be zero. Therefore, the transformer
blocks the DC. Ideally the transformer is lossless, that is, the power levels of the
primary and secondary sides are almost equal:
p1 = v1i1 ≈v2i2 = p2
(9.1)
This means that if the secondary voltage is higher than the primary voltage, the
secondary current is lower than the primary current.
In the middle of Figure 9.3 a diode is seen. A diode is a semiconductor and
has the important property of being able to conduct the current if it is forward
biased (with voltage approx. 0.3–1 V). If the voltage on the other hand is negative,
no current passes through the diode.
The last component in Figure 9.3 is the switch. The switch is basically a tran-
sistor, but in the ﬁeld of power electronics the transistor is never operated in its
linear region in order to avoid loss. It is therefore operated as a switch by a logic
turn on/oﬀsignal, that is, either it is completely closed or fully open. The switch
(or transistor) is the main reason for the wide use of power electronics in vari-
ous applications: it makes it possible to convert a big amount of power with very
low loss and together with modern computation circuits as microcontrollers or
digital signal processors it makes the converter intelligent.
9.3
Power Electronic Topologies
Many diﬀerent power electronic converter topologies can be found in the
literature and several choices have to be made in order to select a proper

180
9 Power Electronic Converters and Their Control in Thermoelectric Applications
converter. One of the ﬁrst parameters to be assessed is the input to output
voltage ratio. If the output is lower than the thermoelectric input step-down
converters are required. In contrast, if the output voltage is higher than the input
a step-up converter is needed. However, for some applications the input can be
both higher and lower than the output and in such situations converters with
both step-down and step-up capabilities are necessary. The best converter is, as
in many other design situations, a compromise between several considerations,
for example, eﬃciency, cost, size, weight, reliability, and complexity. In some
applications electric isolations between the input and output might also be
a requirement. As mentioned before there are many possibilities for power
electronic converters. Therefore, in this section only the most widely used
converters suitable for thermoelectrics will be described.
9.3.1
Buck Converter
Even though thermoelectric modules often produce voltages lower than the load
voltage some thermoelectric generator (TEG) applications require a step-down
converter [9]. One of the most well-known step-down converters is the buck
converter shown in Figure 9.4. The most essential principle of modern power
electronic converters is the capability of the converter to switch between diﬀerent
states because of the semiconductors. In Figure 9.4 the switch S is either turned
on (logic 1) or oﬀ(logic 0) by the logic gate signal G. In one switching period Ts
the switch S is turned on for DTs seconds and oﬀfor (1 −D)Ts seconds. The duty
cycle D is the control variable that makes it possible to control the voltage and
current of the converter.

On-state
In this interval the inductor is the only component between the input and the
output. In this mode, the inductor voltage and capacitor currents are given by
vL = Vin −Vo
(9.2)
iCo = iL −Io
(9.3)
iCin = Iin −iL
(9.4)
Because the input voltage is higher than the output, the inductor voltage in this
interval is positive. Therefore, the current through it increases and energy is
stored in it.
9.3.1.2
Oﬀ-state
When the switch is non-conducting the input and output are separated. In this
situation the inductor voltage and capacitor currents are given by
vL = −Vo
(9.5)
iCo = iL −Io
(9.6)
iCin = Iin
(9.7)
Because the inductor voltage is negative the current decreases and energy is
therefore transferred to the load side.
9.3.1.3
Averaging
In steady state, that is, when the inductor current at time t is equal to the value
at time t + Ts, the average voltage across the inductor in one switching period is
zero [10, 11]. This knowledge is used to determine the relation between the input
and output voltages; that is,
0 = 1

Boost Converter
The boost converter is one of the most used step-up converters both in general
and for TEG systems [12, 13]. From the equivalent circuit diagram in Figure 9.5
it is seen that it has the same components as the buck converter, but arranged in
another way. The output voltage and current can be controlled by the switch S.
In the ﬁgure the voltages and currents of the converter can be seen during on

Non-Inverting Buck Boost Converter
If the output voltage is within the upper and lower limits of the input voltage
it is possible to both step up and step down the voltage. The non-inverting
buck–boost converter shown in Figure 9.6 has such capabilities. It is seen that
this type of converter actually is a series connection of the buck and boost
converters when they share the same inductor. The non-inverting buck–boost
converter is often used in TEG-applications with ﬂuctuating temperatures as it
can handle a wide input voltage range [14–19]. The converter can be operated in
three diﬀerent modes:
Buck mode: In this mode switch S2 is in oﬀ-state all the time, and the output
voltage and current are controlled by switch S1 as shown in Figure 9.4.
Boost mode: In this mode switch S1 is in on-state all the time, and the output
voltage and current are controlled by switch S2 as shown in Figure 9.5.
Buck–boost mode: In this mode the two switches S1 and S2 are controlled syn-
chronously, that is, they are in on and oﬀstates at the same time. Thereby, the
output voltage can either be reduced or increased depending on the duration
of the on-state. From a control point of view, the buck–boost mode is simple
as only one control signal has to be applied.

From the equations, it can be understood that in buck–boost mode the output
voltage is higher than the input voltage for D > 0.5 and lower for D < 0.5.

From the equations it is understood that the inductor current in buck–boost
mode is higher than it would have been in buck mode or boost mode. For
example, if the voltage gain is Vo
Vin = 2, the duty cycle would be 1
2 in boost mode
and 2
3 in buck–boost mode. The inductor current would therefore be 50% higher
in buck–boost mode than in boost mode for the same power transfer. Thereby,
the loss of the inductor would be 125% higher in buck–boost mode than if the
converter was operated in boost mode.

Flyback Converter
When electric isolation between the input and output sides is required or if
there is a huge ratio between the input and output voltages a transformer can
be utilized. The ﬂyback converter shown in Figure 9.7 is one of the simplest
transformer-based converters. It can be derived that the output voltage is

It is understood that by properly selecting the turn ratio N2
N1 , the ﬂyback converter
is able to provide a huge voltage gain. Therefore, this converter is often used in
TEG applications and in particular in distributed TEG applications [20–22].

Electrical Equivalent Circuit Models
for Thermoelectric Modules
It is well known that the open-circuit voltage of a thermoelectric module is
proportional to the temperature gradient between the hot and cold plates of the
module. When connected to a load the output voltage is however limited by
the inner resistance of the device. The inner resistance depends on the average
temperature between the plates, but is constant in many cases considered. In
Figure 9.8, the inner voltage source and resistance of a thermoelectric module
for diﬀerent temperatures are shown. Both parameters can be described as
ﬁrst-order polynomials.
Thermoelectric modules can be modeled in a very simple way seen from an
electric engineer’s point of view. In Figure 9.9 two electric equivalent circuit
models can be seen. The Thévenin model to the left in the ﬁgure is by far the
most widely used as thermoelectric modules in most cases are series connected.
However, when thermoelectric modules are connected in parallel the Norton
equivalent model to the right is more beneﬁcial.

9 Power Electronic Converters and Their Control in Thermoelectric Applications
The Thévenin model includes an inner voltage source Vte,i whereas the Norton
model includes an inner current source Ite,i. It is however easy to convert from
one model to the other as the relationship between the two input sources is given
by the thermoelectric resistance Rte; that is,
Vte,i = RteIte,i
(9.19)
For both circuit models, the thermoelectric voltage and current are given by
Vte = Vte,i −RteIte
(9.20)
Ite =
Vte,i −Vte
Rte
(9.21)
The thermoelectric power produced is given by the product of the thermoelec-
tric voltage and current. However, the power can also be expressed by the inner
voltage source; that is,
Pte = VteIte = Vte,iIte −RteI2
te
(9.22)
The thermoelectric power thereby follows the behavior of a second-order polyno-
mial with the thermoelectric current as variable. In order to maximize the power
produced the thermoelectric current therefore needs to be controlled at its max-
imum power point (MPP) Ite,MPP.
9.5
Maximum Power Point Operation and Tracking
The MPP current can be derived by utilizing the principle of a global maximum,
where the slope with respect to the current is zero. Therefore,
dPte

= Vte,i −2RteIte = 0
(9.23)
⇓
Ite,MPP =

Vte,MPP = Vte,i −RteIte,MPP = Vte,i −Rte
Vte,i

Vte,i

(9.25)
It is seen that at MPP the thermoelectric voltage is half of the inner voltage source.
The MPP load resistance can now be derived:

At MPP the load resistor therefore needs to be the same as the thermoelectric

Figure 9.10 Thermoelectric voltage (a) and power (b) dependency on the current for diﬀerent
temperature gradients.
In Figure 9.10, the produced output voltage and power can be seen as a func-
tion of the output current for diﬀerent temperature gradients. The higher the
temperature, the higher the voltage and power. However, it is also seen that the
MPP current also depends on the temperature diﬀerence.
It can be understood that only a certain load resistor or current will make the
thermoelectric module produce its maximum power. A maximum power point
tracker (MPPT) is therefore necessary.
9.5.1
MPPT-Methods
The MPPT is basically the software of the power electronic converter that ensures
that the thermoelectric modules are being operated at their MPP. Several algo-
rithms for MPPT have been proposed for power electronic converters used in
the ﬁeld of photovoltaics (PV) [23]. These strategies can often also be applied for
TEG systems. The most used strategies will be described here.
9.5.1.1
Perturb and Observe
The perturb and observe (P&O) method is one of the most popular MPPTs for
TEG and PV systems [2, 12, 13, 15, 18]. As the name indicates, it involves making
a perturbation, observing the result, and then, based on the outcome, making
a new perturbation. It is popularly called a hill-climbing method, which can be
understood from the (Ite, Pte)-curve in Figure 9.10. First, the current is zero, which
means that the power also is zero. If a current is applied, the TEG produces a

188
9 Power Electronic Converters and Their Control in Thermoelectric Applications
certain power. Again, by applying a new current that is a little higher than the
previous one, the power production also increases by a little.
The diﬀerences between the actual power at sample k and the previous power
at sample k −1 are given by
ΔPte(k) = Pte(k) −Pte(k −1)
(9.28)
Therefore, by increasing or decreasing the current with a step ΔI and by evaluat-
ing the sign of the power diﬀerence ΔPte(k), it is possible to reach the MPP. For
example, if the actual current Ite(k) is higher than the previous current Ite(k −1)
and the power diﬀerence is positive, the controller knows that the power produc-
tion increases when the current increases, and the controller will then continue
to increase the current until the power diﬀerence becomes negative. If the cur-
rent is higher than the MPP current the controller in the next step will decrease
the current, which will result in a higher power, that is, a positive ΔPte(k). Again,
the controller will decrease the current until the power does not become higher.
The ﬂowchart of the P&O-method is illustrated in Figure 9.11. The current I∗
te is
the reference current of the current controller. The MPPT needs to operate with a
frequency signiﬁcantly lower than the bandwidth of the current controller. How-
ever, the frequency should not be too low as the MPPT then will be too slow
and therefore might not be able to track temperature variations. Also, in order
to avoid big oscillations around the MPP the current step ΔI can be decreased
when the power is close to its maximum.

9.5.1.2
Incremental Conductance
The incremental conductance (IC) method utilizes the fact that at MPP the load
resistance RL is equal to the thermoelectric resistance Rte, that is, their conduc-
tances are equal [2, 24]. Therefore, the load conductance at MPP is equal to the
negative slope of the (Vte, Ite)-curve, that is, when
GL,MPP =

the MPP is reached.
The IC-method is developed for PV systems in order to increase the dynamic
performance just as for the P&O-method the current is either increased or
decreased by a step ΔI. In Figure 9.12, the output conductance and power are
shown as a function of the output current for diﬀerent temperature gradients.
The conductance and power at MPP are also shown. When a step ΔI is applied
the corresponding voltage diﬀerence is measured.
The ﬂowchart of the IC-method can be seen in Figure 9.13.
9.5.1.3
Fractional Open Circuit Voltage
The P&O and IC methods are classiﬁed as hill climbing methods. However, the

that is,

2
(9.30)
When no current is drawn of the TEG system the measured open circuit voltage
is simply given by the inner voltage source. Therefore, by measuring the open
circuit voltage Vte,OC during current interruptions the thermoelectric voltage
reference can easily be determined:
V ∗
te =
Vte,OC
2
(9.31)
A voltage controller will then ensure that the thermoelectric voltage is settled
to the reference V ∗
te. Even though this method is very simple, it is seldom used
owing to the fact that the power production is interrupted during the open
circuit voltage measurement. This is contradictory as the whole purpose of
a MPPT is to maximize the energy production. In order to disable the TEG
the power electronic converter also needs to be able to disconnect the TEG.
The buck converter has a built-in switch, but it is for example not possible to

9.6 Case Study
191
disconnect the TEG system with the switch of the boost converter. Therefore,
an extra switch is necessary, which will increase the total cost.
9.6
Case Study
In order to demonstrate how power electronic converters for TEG applications
are designed and controlled a case study will be presented here. For the given
application, thermoelectric modules will provide charging power for a battery
through a boost converter.
In Figure 9.14, a system diagram is seen. In the MPPT block the thermoelectric
voltage vte and current ite are measured. The output of the MPPT block is a ref-
erence output current i∗
L,MP. The charging voltage of the battery is not allowed
to exceed a predeﬁned maximum value speciﬁed by its data sheet. Therefore,
when the battery voltage reaches the maximum allowed voltage, the boost con-
verter needs to operate in voltage mode rather than in maximum power mode.
When operating in voltage mode a voltage controller is necessary. The maximum
allowed voltage Vb,max is the input reference of the voltage controller. The voltage
controller will also provide an inductor current reference current i∗
L,V. A mode
selector will decide which of the two inductor current references actually will be
applied to the current controller; that is,
i∗

As can be understood, the smallest reference current will be selected. The current
controller forces the error between the reference and the actual measured current
Ei to be zero by adjusting the duty cycle d of the converter.

Speciﬁcations
The thermoelectric module has a Seebeck coeﬃcient of S = 0.05 V/K. The inner
resistance is given by
Rte = 0.5 + 0.002Tav
(9.33)
where the average temperature is
Tav = Tc + Th
2
(9.34)
The cold side of the thermoelectric module is Tc = 20 ∘C and the maximum hot
side temperature is Th,max = 220 ∘C. The maximum temperature is considered as
nominal. Therefore
Vte,i,nom = S(Th,max −Tc) = 0.05 (220 −20) = 10 V
(9.35)
Tav,nom =

= 5 V
(9.40)
The battery consists of four cells connected in series and has a nominal capacity
of Qb,nom = 10 Ah. The nominal output voltage of the converter is equal to the
nominal battery voltage, that is, Vo,nom = Vb,nom = 14.8 V.
If it is assumed that the converter is lossless all the power of the thermoelec-
tric modules is transferred to the battery terminals. The nominal duty cycle and
output current are therefore
Dnom =
Vo,nom −Vin,nom
Vo,nom
= 14.8 −5

(9.42)
In Figure 9.14 it is seen that similarly to the thermoelectric modules, the battery
is modeled as a series connection of an inner voltage source vb,i and resistance
Rb. The resistance of the selected battery is Rb = 100 mΩ. The level of the inner
voltage source depends on the state-of-charge (SoC) of the battery as shown in
Figure 9.15. The SoC is calculated as follows:
SoC = SoC(t0) +

(9.43)
where SoC(t0) is the initial state-of-charge level.

Requirements
An important design parameter of the passive components is the allowed voltage
and current ripple. The inductor current peak-to-peak ripple is allowed to be 10%
of the average. In Eq. (9.14) it was shown that the average inductor current is equal
to the average input current. Therefore,
ΔIL = 0.10 ⋅Iin,nom = 0.10 ⋅6.76 = 0.68A
(9.44)
In order to consider the input and output currents as constant the current of
these are maximum allowed to have a peak-to-peak ripple of 1% of the nominal;
that is,
ΔIin = 0.01 ⋅Iin,nom = 0.01 ⋅6.76 = 67.57 mA
(9.45)
ΔIo = 0.01 ⋅Io,nom = 0.01 ⋅2.28 = 22.83 mA
(9.46)
The peak-to-peak voltage ripple of the input and output are therefore
ΔVin = Rte,nomΔIin = 0.74 ⋅0.068 = 50 mV
(9.47)
ΔVo = RbΔIo = 0.1 ⋅0.023 = 2.3 mV
(9.48)
Selection of the switching frequency is a trade-oﬀamong several parameters,
for example, physical size of the passive components and switching loss. However,
in this case study a frequency of fs = 25 kHz is chosen.
9.6.3
Design of Passive Components
During the turn-on period the voltage across the inductor is given by the input
voltage. Therefore, the required inductance is

9 Power Electronic Converters and Their Control in Thermoelectric Applications
The maximum current of the input capacitor is half of the inductor current
ripple, which also can been from Figure 9.5. From geometrical considerations
it can be shown that in one switching period the charge transfer of the input
capacitor is given by
ΔQin = 2 ∫

The required input capacitance is therefore
Cin = ΔQin
ΔVin
= 4.47 × 10−6
50 × 10−3
= 89.48 μF
(9.51)
During the turn-on period the charge transfer of the output capacitor is
ΔQo =
Io,nom ⋅Dnom
fs
= 2.28 ⋅0.6622
25 000
= 60.46 μC
(9.52)
The required input capacitance is therefore
Co = ΔQo
ΔVo
= 60.46 × 10−6
2.3 × 10−3
= 26.49 mF
(9.53)
9.6.4
Transfer Functions
In order to design the required current and voltage controllers of the converter,
transfer functions of the converter are necessary. In order to derive the transfer
functions, the converter is ﬁrst analyzed; that is,

It is assumed that each variable x is given by a DC part X and a small AC
part ̃x, that is, x = X + ̃x. This is therefore inserted in the previous equations;
that is,

The small AC parts are now separated from the DC parts. It is assumed that the

(9.66)
LsIL(s) = Vin(s) −(1 −D)Vo(s) + VoD(s)
(9.67)

Rb
+ (1 −D)IL(s) −ILD(s)
(9.68)
The transfer functions are then given by

9 Power Electronic Converters and Their Control in Thermoelectric Applications
If both a current controller and a voltage controller are applied a cascaded
control structure is often used, which also is the case in this study as shown
in Figure 9.14. In such conﬁguration the inner current loop needs to have suﬃ-
cient higher bandwidth than the outer voltage loop, for example, by a factor of 10.
Thereby, the inductor current can be seen as the only control input of the voltage
controller. The inductor current to output voltage transfer function is therefore
Vo(s)
IL(s) = Rb(1 −D)
RbCos + 1
(9.73)
9.6.5
Design of Current Controller
When inserting the nominal values of the parameters of the duty cycle to inductor
current transfer function one obtains
IL(s)
D(s) =
2.596 × 10−6s2 + 0.0402s + 15.03
3.438 × 10−11s3 + 5.321 × 10−7s2 + 0.002157s + 0.7514
(9.74)
It is desirable to have a bandwidth of the controller suﬃciently lower than the
switching frequency. A bandwidth 100 times lower than the switching frequency
is therefore chosen; that is, BWi = 0.01 ⋅2𝜋fs = 1571 rad/s. A proportional–
integral (PI) controller can therefore be designed:
D(s)
Ei(s) = 79.513 × 10−5s + 1
s
(9.75)
In Figure 9.16, the open loop bode plot of the current controller and plant can be
seen. The poles and zeros of the system are also seen. The zero of the PI controller
is placed at the highest pole of the plant. A phase margin of 84∘is obtained, which
is suﬃcient and the bandwidth is 1.57 × 103 rad/s as desired.
In order to evaluate the performance of the current controller, diﬀerent
current reference steps are applied to a simulation model of the converter. The
circuit and controller have been implemented in the circuit simulator PLECS.
In Figure 9.17, it is seen that the current controller is able to track the inductor
reference currents.
9.6.6
MPPT Implementation
It is chosen to apply the P&O-method as it is widely used. In Figure 9.11, it was
shown that a value of ΔI was either added to or subtracted from the thermoelec-
tric output current depending on the internal states of the MPPT ﬂowchart. In
this case study it is actually the inductor current that is controlled, but as pre-
viously mentioned the average thermoelectric current is equal to the average
inductor current. Therefore,
I∗
L,MP = I∗
te
(9.76)
It is decided to divide the current reference into steps of ΔI = 0.1 A, that is,
approximately 1.5% of the nominal input current. The size of the step is a trade-oﬀ
between the speed of the MPPT and the eﬃciency of the algorithm.

In order to demonstrate the operation of the MPPT a start scenario is shown
in Figure 9.18. A constant temperature is applied to the hot side. In the ﬁgure,
it is seen how the actual thermoelectric power produced reaches the maximum
possible power. It is also seen that the power produced oscillates around the
maximum possible. These oscillations cause the MPPT eﬃciency to be less than
100%. The oscillations however can be decreased by decreasing the current
steps when the power produced approaches the maximum possible. The MPPT
eﬃciency is deﬁned as the ratio of the produced power relative to the maximum

Figure 9.19 Open loop bode plot of voltage controller and plant. Cross: pole, Circle: zero.
In Figure 9.19, the open loop bode plot of the voltage controller and plant is
seen. The zero of the PI controller cancels out the pole of the plant. A phase mar-
gin of 90 ∘is obtained and the bandwidth is 157 rad/s as desired, that is, 10 times
lower than the bandwidth of the current controller.
In order to assess the performance of the voltage controller, several reference
voltages has been applied to the controller in a simulation. In Figure 9.20 it is seen
that the voltage controller is able to track the output voltage reference.
The main reason for having a voltage controller was to ensure that the
maximum allowed voltage of the battery was not exceeded. In Figure 9.21
the thermoelectric power and battery voltage is seen during charging. The
thermoelectric module produces maximum power until the battery voltage
reaches its upper limit at 16.8 V. When this happens the converter switches to
voltage mode and ramps down the produced power in order to have a constant
voltage. A small overshoot during the transition from maximum power mode to
voltage mode is seen. However, it is assumed that such a small peak for such a
relatively short time not will aﬀect the health of the battery. It should be noticed
that the simulation actually has been done with a battery capacity 3600 times
smaller than the 10 Ah nominal capacity in order to avoid too long a simulation
time. In reality the battery of course cannot be charged in a few seconds. It will
rather take a few hours depending on the level of the charging current.

Conclusion
In this chapter, the basics of power electronic building blocks have been given.
The fundamental components are the resistor, inductor, capacitor, transformer,
switch, and diode. Suitable power electronic DC/DC converters for thermoelec-
tric applications have also been presented. The converters have either step-down
or step-up capabilities or both at the same time. For high voltage gain factors a
transformer is utilized, which also provides galvanic isolation.
Two electrical equivalent circuit diagrams (Thévenin and Norton) of thermo-
electric modules have been presented and the theory behind maximum power
point operation and tracking has been explained.
In order to demonstrate the utilization of a power electronic converter and
MPPT for thermoelectric applications a case study has been presented. For the
case study a boost converter was charging a battery from a series connection of
thermoelectric modules. The case study included the design procedure of the
passive components and controllers of the converter. For MPPT the P&O method
was applied. When the battery reached its maximum allowed voltage the boost
converter was operating in voltage mode instead of maximum power mode.

Introduction
The present chapter reports a comprehensive review of thermoelectric generator
(TEG) devices modeling, human body heat source physics principles, fabrica-
tion methods, and recent research advances with a ﬁnal overview of the perfor-
mance enhancement eﬀorts, integration, and exploitation of these power sources
in wearable electronics.
10.2
Human Body as Heat Source for Wearable TEGs
In humans, the thermoregulatory system reacts to changing intensity of heat pro-
duction in response to metabolic and muscular activities, as well as to varying
temperature conditions of the environment, to maintain the core temperature
within a narrow range around 37 ∘C (homeothermy). It essentially represents
the temperature of the blood in circulation in the cranial, thoracic, and abdomi-
nal cavities [1]. The metabolic heat of a subject is traditionally measured in Met
(1 Met = 58.15 W/m2) for body surface: the latter is of the order of 1.7 m2 for an
adult subject. A sleeping person has a metabolism of 0.8 Met (46 W/m2); the lat-
ter increases to 1.2 Met (70 W/m2) for a sitting person working in the oﬃce, and
up to 9.5 Met (550 W/m2) during vigorous eﬀorts [2].
The body heat is transferred, through tissues and blood vessels, to the skin
and removed from it into the ambient by conduction, convection, radiation, and
evaporation. Conduction heat transfer occurs when part of the body is in contact
with solid surfaces in the environment. In the steady state, the heat transfer by
conduction is described by the following equation:
qcond = hk(Tskin −Tsurf) in (W∕m2)

where hk represents the conductive heat transfer coeﬃcient, which depends on
the surface area of contact and thermal properties of both the skin and the object.
In a transient state, the amount of heat transferred to and from the solid in contact
with the skin depends on the thermal inertia of the material, given by the product
of its thermal conductivity, density, and speciﬁc heat. The greater the thermal
inertia, the greater the heat transmitted to or removed from the skin is. When
the surface area of contact is little (e.g., subject standing) or the thermal inertia
of the material is very low, the heat transfer due to conduction represents a small
proportion of the total heat balance of the human body. When both the thermal
inertia and surface area of contact are large, the heat lost by conduction becomes
considerable (e.g., subject lying on cold ﬂoor) [3].
The loss of convective heat from the human body is directly proportional to the
diﬀerence between the mean temperature of the skin and that of the surround-
ing air:
qconv = hc(Tskin −Tair) in (W∕m2)
(10.2)
with hc being the convective heat transfer coeﬃcient. Diﬀerent works were aimed
at ﬁnding the natural and forced convection heat transfer coeﬃcients of human
body, with the purpose of determining the amount of body heat exchanged
with the environment by using theoretical and experimental methods applied
to heated thermal manikins of diﬀerent body shapes, size, and complexity of
posture, in diﬀerent microclimatic conditions, velocities, and directions of the
surrounding air, typical of indoor and outdoor situations [4–10].
The radiative ﬂux to and from the human body can be expressed as [11]
R = fclhr(Tcl −Tr) in W∕m2
(10.3)
where hr is the linear radiative heat transfer coeﬃcient, f cl is the ratio of
clothed-to-nude body surface area, Tcl is the mean surface temperature of the
clothed body, and Tr is the mean radiant temperature perceived by the body.
The linearized radiative heat transfer coeﬃcient can be calculated by
hr = 4𝜀k Ar
AD
[
273.2 + Tcl −Tr

in W∕m2∕K
(10.4)
where k = 5.67 × 10−8 W/m2/K4 is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, 𝜀= 0.95 is the
average body surface emissivity, Ar is the eﬀective radiation area of the human
body, and AD is the DuBois body surface area. The ratio Ar/AD was estimated to
be 0.70 for a sitting person and 0.73 for a standing person [12]; hr = 4.7 W/m2/K
for general purposes in typical indoor temperatures [11]. Interesting results about
the estimation of hr values for individual body segments were presented in [4, 6].
A wearable TEG is designed to harvest waste body heat through contact with
human body skin, which represents the contact surface with the hot junctions of
a thermopile. The thermal gradient between the body skin and the surrounding
environment is exploited to generate power by Seebeck eﬀect. Under a neutral
environmental condition, in which no thermoregulatory action is required to
maintain thermal balance, skin temperature typically ranges between about
30 and 34 ∘C. Numerous factors, including such environmental conditions as
temperature, air-ﬂow rate, air pressure and humidity, insulation by clothing,

inﬂuence the skin temperature and its spatial distribution on human body.
In [13] the authors collected skin temperature distribution by using thermo-
couples attached on diﬀerent body locations under neutral, warm, and cold
environments (Table 10.1). Human subjects wearing a leotard and cotton socks
were exposed to partial and whole-body cooling and heating in a controlled
environmental chamber. Under neutral conditions, the mean skin temperature
was very stable, with ﬂuctuations within 0.1 ∘C during the observation period of
2 h. A maximum skin temperature variation of 3 ∘C was measured between the
forehead and the front of the neck (the warmest sites) and the calf (the coolest
site). When exposed at warm environment (31.5 ∘C), an increase of 0.6 ∘C of
mean skin temperature was measured within 80 min of exposure, as a result
of the vasodilatation, with a diﬀerence of 2.7 ∘C between the front of the neck
and the calf. After cold exposure for 2 h at 15.6 ∘C, a mean skin temperature
reduction of 1 ∘C was measured, with a wide variation recorded across the body,
as result of the vasoconstriction. The neck retains the highest temperature,
representing an important source of heat loss under cold exposure conditions.
Interesting results were also obtained by analyzing the skin temperature
response to physical activity [14]. Infrared thermography was used to precisely
map the cutaneous temperature distribution and its evolution during run-
ning exercise under controlled environmental conditions of temperature and
humidity. The thermographic investigation revealed a not uniform reduction of
the mean skin temperature during the early phase of exercise, probably due to

208
10 Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting for Powering Wearable Electronics
the cutaneous vasoconstrictor response to exercise. Such reduction is observed
for the entire duration of the performance, for athletes subjected to a running
exercise of increasing load intensity. Instead, during a constant load exercise,
after a relative minimum, a slight increase of the mean skin temperature appeared
and such result was correlated to the net result of the competition between the
vasoconstrictor response, which is present for the entire duration of the exercise,
and the vasodilator response, opposite to the former and induced by the increas-
ing body temperature. However, the skin temperature during the exercise varies
in diﬀerent ways on diﬀerent body sites, being more pronounced for peripheral
zones less involved in running, such as upper limbs, and more moderate in the
proximity of working muscles, such as calves. Experiments demonstrated that
the skin temperature of upper limbs decreases by 2.5 and 3.75 ∘C after 30 min of
running exercise, at constant and graded load intensity, respectively. Instead, skin
temperature over calves decreases by about 1.5 ∘C, for both types of exercises.

TEG Design for Wearable Applications: Thermal
and Electrical Considerations
Depending on the direction of the heat ﬂow through the thermocouples and
the orientation of the substrate surface, two main design approaches can be
used to build a thermopile: a transversal (cross-plane) or a lateral (in-plane)
conﬁguration. The cross-plane conﬁguration is typical of macro bulk ther-
moelectric module (TEM) or micro-TEM constituted of vertical pillar-type
thermocouples connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel [15, 16];
the heat ﬂows perpendicularly to the substrate and the hot and cold thermocou-
ple junctions are placed on separate planes. In the in-plane conﬁguration, the
heat ﬂows parallel to the substrate, which contains both the hot and cold junc-
tions of thermocouples. To maximize the temperature drop on the thermocouple
junctions, from which the thermoelectric power generation is also dependent,
starting from small thermal gradients that are typically achievable for wearable
applications, wearable TEMs are mostly based on a vertical conﬁguration.
However, the literature reports numerous examples of wearable planar TEMs,
in which an optimized package was designed to maximize the thermal gradient
between junctions [17–20].
Francioso et al. fabricated a ﬂexible planar TEM with wavy-shaped poly-
dimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/Kapton assembled package, with sputtering-deposited
thin ﬁlms as active p-type and n-type thermocouples (Figure 10.1) [22–24].
Thermal and electrical matching are required to extract the maximum power
from the thermoelectric device. In the electrical domain, the maximum power
across the load can be obtained, in matched load condition, by optimizing both
the thermoelectric properties of materials and the design of the thermopile.
Materials optimization is aimed at obtaining a high ﬁgure of merit, ZT, which
depends on the Seebeck coeﬃcient, S, electrical conductivity, 𝜎, and thermal
conductivity, 𝜆, and is given by
ZT = S2𝜎

Figure 10.2 Thermal (a) and electrical equivalent circuits (b) of a thermoelectric module in
contact with the human skin.
In addition to the materials optimization, the design of the thermopile, with
the dimensioning of the legs and of the number of thermocouples forming the
module, nth, directly contributes to determining the output voltage on the load
(V load) by the generated open circuit voltage division between the internal elec-
trical resistance of the TEG, Rel,TEG, and the load resistance, Rel,load:
Vload =
Rel,load
Rel,load + Rel,TEG

(10.6)
The coupling to the thermal domain occurs through the temperature diﬀerence
ΔTTEG between the hot and cold thermocouple junctions. The thermal and elec-
trical equivalent circuits of a TEM in contact with the human skin are shown in
Figure 10.2.
The thermal resistances included into the thermal circuit are representative
of the human body (Rth,body), body/TEG contact interface (Rc,hot), TEG (Rth,TEG),
TEG/air contact interface (Rc,cold), and surrounding air (Rth,air). The heat ﬂow
from the human body to the environment is a function of the temperature
diﬀerence ΔT between the body core Tcore and environment Tair and the equiv-
alent series thermal resistance of the circuit. Two diﬀerent and more interesting
design approaches for a micro-thermoelectric device were proposed in [15, 25].
Leonov exhaustively discussed the thermal design of a wearable TEG by
deﬁning the conditions that enable reaching maximum power, starting from the
heat generated by the human body. Owing to the high thermal resistance of the
ambient air and human body, the heat ﬂow that can be transferred to the TEG is
quite limited. Although depending on the body location and surrounding condi-
tions, the average heat ﬂow observed on human open skin under typical indoor
conditions is in the range 1–10 m W/cm2), but it decreases to 4–5 m W/cm2 in
the case of skin areas covered by clothes [25]. To maximize the generated power,
the TEG thermal resistance has to be of the order of those of the body and air.
Assuming that the thermal resistance of interfaces is negligible, the gradient
ΔTTEG between the junctions of the TEG as a function of ΔT is given by
ΔTTEG =
Rth,TEG
Rth,TEG + Rth,body + Rth,air
ΔT
(10.7)

10.3 TEG Design for Wearable Applications: Thermal and Electrical Considerations
211
The interesting aspect that emerged from Leonov’s discussion is related to the
separation of Rth,TEG into two components, which takes into account the ther-
mal resistance of the thermopile, Rtp, and that of the encapsulation structure
containing the thermopile, Rpar, on which a certain amount of heat is inevitably
dissipated. As shown in [25], the optimal temperature drop on the TEG depends
on the thermal design of the “empty” TEG (without thermoelectric materials, and
with the approximation Rempty-TEG ≈Rpar) and its interfaces on the cold and hot
sides, but not on the thermoelectric properties of the p- and n-materials. Then,
the maximum power generated by an optimized TEG is [25]

(10.8)
where Z is the thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit and the optimal thermal gradient
on the thermopile, ΔTtp,opt, is a function of the thermal resistance of the body,
air, and encapsulation structure:
ΔTtp,opt =
ΔT

(

(10.9)
As opposed to Leonov’s work, that of Glatz et al. [15] is not strictly oriented
to a wearable application, but it discusses the optimal design of a micro-TEG
focusing the attention on the importance of increasing the internal resistance
of the TEG and minimizing the contact resistance of interfaces. The proposed
design was performed by assuming that the TEG is connected to a hot and
a cold reservoir via thermal contact resistances Rc,hot and Rc,cold. The thermal
gradient ΔTTEG was expressed as a function of the temperature diﬀerence ΔT
between the hot and cold reservoir, KC, KH, and KG, which is the internal
thermal resistance of the TEG:
ΔTTEG =
KG
KG + KH + KC
ΔT
(10.10)
Assuming that both thermolegs do not vary in length, l, and cross-sectional
area, Ao, the above equation can be rewritten as:
ΔTTEG =
l(1 + AV)
l(1 + AV) + 𝜆m(kC + kH)ΔT
(10.11)
where AV = Ai/Ao is the ratio of the insulating to the active area. As shown in [15]
the power per area is given by:
P
AGΔT2 = S2𝜎
16
l(1 + AV)
[l(1 + AV) + 𝜆m(kC + kH)]2
(10.12)
It depends on the material properties (S, 𝜆, 𝜎), the geometric design parameters
(l and AV), and the thermal contact resistances per area of interface with the
cold and hot sides of the TEG. Two interesting conclusions emerged through
the discussion of Glatz: the ﬁrst one is that the number of thermocouples and
the cross-sectional area of the thermolegs determine the generated voltage and

212
10 Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting for Powering Wearable Electronics
current at the output of the TEG, but they do not inﬂuence the generated power
per area; the second one is that the generated power is initially increasing with the
length of the legs, and then it reaches a maximum, after which the negative eﬀect
of the internal electrical resistance of the TEG becomes dominant and causes the
power reduction. However, the optimal leg length is independent of the thermo-
electric properties of the materials, S and 𝜎.

Flexible TEGs: Deposition Methods and Thermal
Flow Design Approach
The increasing number of wearable sensors and devices rouses the need for
miniaturized power sources characterized by lightness, high power density,
and cheapness; during the last years the renewed interest in environmentally
available power harvesting has led to an extensive research on the TEGs devices.
Key mandatory requirements for wearable generator are reduced physical
dimensions and ﬂexibility of the substrate for comfortable clothes integration,
which implies also the possibility for the deposited active materials to be able
to withstand mechanical bending and to conform to nonplanar surfaces. The
wearable TEG typically exploits the heat ﬂow based on the temperature gradient
between the human body and the environment air mass to generate a small
voltage dominated by the so-called Seebeck eﬀect. State-of-the-art TEGs exploit
a cross-plane temperature gradient coupling, which requires a vertical thermo-
couples assembly approach during the fabrication process. About the bending
properties of devices, the preferred kinds of active thermoelectric junctions are
screen-printable pastes or slurries printed onto a ﬂexible sheet or dispensed
into predeﬁned molds (PDMS, polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) polyimide).
In the near room temperature range typical of wearable applications, the
bismuth/tellurium-based inorganic materials remain the state-of-the-art ther-
moelectrics with highest ZT values. The highest ZT values were reported
for epitaxial, Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 based multilayers [26] and PbTeSe quantum dot
superlattices [27], with ZT = 2.4 at 300 K and ZT = 3.4 at 575 K, respectively.
Recently,inordertoallowtheproductionofapplication-readydeviceswithhigh
thermolegs aspect ratio, research activity has been oriented toward the produc-
tion of nanocomposites with an enhanced interface-to-volume ratio and lower
thermal conductivity by means of high pressure/high temperature techniques,
such as ball milling, hot pressing, mechanical alloying, melt spinning nanoparti-
cle, synthesis from gas phase, and spark plasma sintering. These methods allowed
an eﬃciency increase by 40–75% compared to bulk thermoelectric materials [28].
10.4.1
Deposition Methods
The choice of the best deposition techniques for wearable TEGs must fulﬁll
the requirement of thermoelectric junction fabrication able to produce a low
generator internal resistance, high power density (e.g., vertical/vertical approach,
see Section 10.4.2), and heat sink-less operation when possible. Reported below
are the most used deposition techniques for wearable TEGs.

10.4 Flexible TEGs: Deposition Methods and Thermal Flow Design Approach
213
10.4.1.1
Screen Printing
The screen-printing technique is characterized by a large variety of compatible
substrates (plastics and textiles) and pastes suitable for large area production; it is
relatively cheap, simple to implement, and allows also multilayer patterns align-
ment. The main advantages are related to good resolution (down to 20–50 μm
for thicker ﬁlm), high production rate, and complete devices fabrication with-
out photolithographic steps. A key aspect of this technique is the preparation of
pastes or powder suspensions; about Bi/Te/Sb based materials, the low melting
point of these materials allows the milling of powders with single pure elements,
while alloy formation is performed during the thermal treatment after deposition
(typically in the presence of additional tellurium to optimize the stoichiometry)
[29–32]. Suemori et al. [33] realized a ﬂexible TEG on a polyethylene naphthalate
ﬁlm substrate using a printing process. The adopted material was a composite
made by carbon nanotubes and polystyrene, containing approximately 35 vol.%
of voids.
10.4.1.2
Inkjet Printing
Inkjet printing is a direct-writing technique, which has the advantages of being
maskless and being able to perform high precision localized deposition, thanks to
precise computerized control of stage and nozzle parameters. Limitations of such
technique are related to well-deﬁned viscosity ranges for materials dispensing
and thinner structures obtained with single step deposition.
Typical examples of application of inkjet to thermoelectric devices were
reported in [30, 34, 35], in which 120 μm thick thermoelectric legs made by
n-type Bi2Te3 particles with epoxy resin addition were printed onto ﬂexible
substrates to fabricate a 62 single leg device with maximum output power of
25 μW at 20 K of thermal gradient. Owing to the limited thickness of deposited
ﬁlms, this technique is preferred when an in-plane temperature diﬀerence is
available, or when vertical/lateral assembly approach is adopted (see Section
10.4.2). Otego [36], a German company, developed a proprietary roll-to-roll
printing with organic semiconductors active materials, folded with a proprietary
process to produce a cheap box-like thermoelectric generator.
10.4.1.3
Molding
The molding technique makes use of a pre-fabricated mold of SU-8, micromilled
ceramics or PDMS ﬁlled with thermoelectric active materials; recently, this
technique has been largely investigated because of its capability to match well
with wearable applications where the vertical temperature gradient approach is
mandatory. The fabrication of mold can be performed by optical lithography or
pouring template precursors in a microdrilled or CNC micromilled fabricated
stamp. Bubnova et al. realized cavities in an SU-8 50 photoresist by photolithog-
raphy technique, and then thermoelectric materials were dispensed into the
mold openings by inkjet printing technique [37]. With a similar approach Kouma
et al. fabricated a high-output-voltage micro-TEG made by thermocouples with
an aspect ratio of 3.5 using a novel and simple fabrication method, in which
thermoelectric nanopowders were ﬁlled in a photosensitive glass mold by using

214
10 Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting for Powering Wearable Electronics
aerosol deposition. Subsequent hot isostatic pressing was applied to improve the
thermoelectric property [38].
10.4.1.4
Lithography
The main advantages of lithography-based techniques for TEGs are the highest
resolution for thermocouples integration, deﬁnition, and compatibility with
most fabrication tools used for MEMS and CMOS processes. Huesgen et al.
fabricated a multipurpose thermoelectric generator in a combined surface and
bulk micromachining process, with n-doped poly-Si and Al as active materials.
The thermocouples were deposited by thin-ﬁlm processes with high integration
density on the wafer surface; the heat ﬂow path was perpendicular to the chip
surface and guided by thermal connectors [39]. One side of the thermocouple
junction was thermally connected to the heat source and thermally insulated to
the heat sink by a cavity fabricated in the wafer substrate. Wang et al. realized a
wearable miniaturized TEG speciﬁcally engineered for human body applications
based on a surface micromachined poly-SiGe thermopile. Being worn on
human body, the wearable TEG delivers an open-circuit output voltage of about
0.15 V and an output power of about 0.3 nW on a matched external load [40].
A more recent device from the same author was fabricated with a membraneless
approach and KOH bulk micromachined in-plane thermopile made of poly-Si
or poly-SiGe. The declared open-circuit output voltage was about 95.0 mV/K,
with corresponding output power on a matched load of 2.34 nW/K2 [41]. Sevilla
et al. fabricated a ﬂexible and semi-transparent thermoelectric energy harvester
on bulk monocrystalline silicon (1 0 0) wafers; the upper silicon layer is then
released with ﬁnal thickness of 18 μm, reducing the thermal loss signiﬁcantly
and generating nearly 30% more output power [42].
10.4.1.5
Vacuum Deposition Techniques
The vacuum deposition techniques used for TEGs are diﬀerent and the desirable
features are strict ﬁlm growth control and doping, high production yield, and
high purity of precursors/sources. Reported below are the main characteristics
of most used vacuum deposition-based techniques.
10.4.1.6
Thermal Evaporation
Thermal evaporation is a physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique using
joule-eﬀect-heated material sources [43]; the source materials are vaporized
and reach the target substrate with rare collisions with the gas molecules inside
the evaporation chamber. Vacuum deposition with a pressure range between
10−6 and 10−8 mbar or lower limits the inclusion of impurities into the growing
ﬁlm. The composition of the deposited ﬁlm is proportional to the relative
vapor pressure of the solid or liquid material in the source. About thermal
evaporation of Bi, Sb, and Te melting points are 544.7, 903.8, and 722.7 K
respectively [44]. It also summarizes the temperatures for a given vapor pressure
of these elements. Antimony has a vapor pressure of 10−2 torr at temperatures
below its melting point and is thus transformed to vapor by sublimation. The
advantage of Sb sublimation is that the material will not melt and overﬂow out

10.4 Flexible TEGs: Deposition Methods and Thermal Flow Design Approach
215
of the crucible while heating the source, although control of the evaporation
rate is diﬃcult owing to its atom-cluster vaporization. Also, vaporizing the
alloy produces a gradient in the deposited thin ﬁlm owing to vapor pressure
diﬀerences of Bi, Sb, and Te elements [45]. The eﬀect of thermal annealing is
crucial in thermally evaporated materials; Lin et al. investigated the inﬂuence
of thermal annealing on the microstructures and thermoelectric properties of
Bi2Te3 thin ﬁlms in the temperature range 100–250 ∘C. Experimental results
showed that both the Seebeck coeﬃcient and power factor were enhanced as the
annealing temperature increased. Annealing at 250 ∘C for 30 min brought the
Seebeck coeﬃcient and power factor of n-type Bi2Te3-based thin ﬁlms to about
−132.02 μV/K and 6.05 μW/cm/K2, respectively [46].
10.4.1.7
Sputtering
The sputtering deposition tool is widely used for wearable thermoelectric devices,
and together with screen printing process, it is among the industry-preferred
methods for fabrication of devices ready to go or already present on the market
to the best of our knowledge [47]. The deposition of sputtered thin ﬁlms is well
documented in the scientiﬁc community and represents a very powerful method
to precisely control the material stoichiometry and subsequent aﬀected power
factor [48]. Francioso et al. realized through RF sputtering tool a complete ther-
moelectric generator with a Kapton/PDMS assembly able to incorporate a thin
ﬁlm fabricated TEG with a 3D PDMS package for wearable applications [24, 49].
10.4.1.8
Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE)
Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is an ultra-high vacuum deposition method to
deposit single crystals ﬁlms and multilayers by means of one or several molecular
or atomic beams interactions on the surface of a heated crystalline substrate.
The MBE technique is characterized by a slow deposition rate (typically less
than 1 μm/h) to allow the ﬁlms to grow as an epitaxial layer. MBE systems are
carefully designed to guarantee very high purity during the deposition, by means
of high-vacuum chambers with pressure levels down to 10−10 torr. Sources of
pure constituent elements are evaporated or sublimated from eﬀusion cells
isolated from the substrate by molybdenum and tantalum shutters. Bi2Te3
has been deposited by molecular beam epitaxy with a Seebeck coeﬃcient of
180 μV/K [50], and (BiSb)2Te3 has been reported with a Seebeck coeﬃcient
of 184 μV/K and a power factor of 1.6 mW/m/K2 [51]. About thermoelectric
V–VI based materials, Zhang et al. demonstrated that bismuth telluride is a
3D topological insulator, characterized by bulk material bandgap and gapless
electronic surface states that are protected by time-reversal symmetry [52–54].
These surface states show a linear energy dispersion such as the relativistic
particles; therefore surface carriers of topological insulators have special prop-
erties, such as extremely high mobilities or dissipationless spin-locked transport
[55, 56]. Krumrain et al. investigated the growth of the topological insulator
Bi2Te3 on Si(1 1 1) substrates by means of MBE. Angular-resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy revealed a linear energy dispersion of charge carriers at the surface,
conﬁrming the topologically insulating properties of the Bi2Te3 epilayers [57].

10.4.1.9
Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD)
Metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is a CVD method of mate-
rials epitaxial growth dominated by the surface chemical reaction of organic com-
pounds or metalorganics and metal hydrides containing the elements of interest.
The growth of the epitaxial layer is driven by pyrolysis of the chemicals pre-
cursors at the substrate surface and takes place at pressure between 10−2 torr
and 1 atm. MOCVD of thermoelectric materials and alloys has been investi-
gated using precursors of trimethylbismuth, triethylantimony, diethyltellurium,
and diethylselenium. High-quality n-type and p-type materials have been grown
using the MOCVD tool. An important published result on Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 super-
lattice research used MOCVD to growth p-type material with a ZT of 2.4, and
n-type material with a ZT of 1.4 [26], even if conﬁrmation through independent
measurements is still missing. State-of-the-art thermoelectric properties were
achieved in the direction perpendicular to the layers of the superlattice.
10.4.1.10
Electrochemical Deposition
Electrochemical deposition (ECD) of thin/thick thermoelectric ﬁlms is a cheap
alternative to previously listed methods because of its simplicity, low cost, and
room temperature operation. Deposited materials may be diﬀerent in terms of
composition, deposition rates, alloys composition, and materials morphology.
From the point of view of thermoelectric-active materials growth, the main de-
sirable features are the cheap setup and the possibility to deposit at rates of several
tens of microns per hour. Diﬀerent papers reported the ECD growth of n-type
Bi2Te3, p-type Bi2−xSbxTe3 and SbxTey compounds deposited at room tempera-
ture at a constant potential in a standard three-electrode conﬁguration [58, 59].
Glatz et al. fabricated a low-cost generator prototype by the ECD technique; the
thermoelectric materials were grown into a polymer mold. The fabricated devices
generated up to 2.6 nW/cm2/K2 for devices with NiCu thermocouples and up to
0.29 μW/cm2/K2 for Bi2Te3-based generators in planar state [60].
Recently Pelz et al. developed a fabrication process for an electrochemically
deposited thermoelectric generator with two selectively dissolvable photoresists
and galvanostatic electrodeposition. The novelties of the process are the usage of
a multilamination technique to create legs and contacts structures and an indus-
trial pick and placer, which allows dispensing of a selectively dissolvable photore-
sist to selectively deﬁne the deposition area of second-level materials [61].

Vapor–Liquid–Solid (VLS) Growth
The interest in quantum conﬁnement eﬀects in V–VI nanowires (NWs)
compounds, mainly related to the enhancement of thermoelectric properties
and power factor, brought the scientiﬁc community to investigate diﬀerent
methods for synthesizing bismuth telluride NWs. Diﬀerent papers reported the
template-assisted electrodeposition, the synthesis by chemical routes, and also
the metal-catalyst-assisted vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) growth technique [62–66].
The VLS mechanism is a well-known crystal growth mechanism that is assisted
by a metal catalyst. The technique allows the 1D growth of NMs, whiskers, and

nano/microrods. The 1D crystal growth was developed about 50 years ago in
the silicon industry and the mechanism was suggested for wider use by Wagner
in 1964 [67]. In this mechanism, the metal catalyst deposited on the substrate
forms liquid alloy droplets at a high temperature by incorporation of element
vapors. Owing to temperature or vapor pressure ﬂuctuation, the alloy becomes
supersaturated, so the concentration of the components on the metal droplet
is higher than the equilibrium concentration. At this point, the precipitation
of the component at the liquid–solid interface happens in order to achieve
minimum free energy of the system. The growth of bismuth telluride nanorods
and nanobelts by VLS has been reported by Wang et al. [68] and by Wei
et al. [69].
10.4.2
Heat Flow Direction Design Approach in Wearable TEG
The design of a thermoelectric generator requires in general electrical and
thermal optimization to enhance its generation properties when the working
environment is related to the human body or other thermal sources close to
room temperature. Hence, with regard to the choice of the deposition techniques
reported above and the design of the generators, the identiﬁcation of better
thermocouples packaging and heat ﬂow distribution is of crucial importance.
About the microfabricated TEGs, they are classiﬁed according to the heat ﬂow
direction through the device and the approach related to the layout of the
thermocouples during fabrication.
The following types of conﬁgurations may be found in the published literature,
with reference to the design approach of a thermoelectric generator:
1) Devices with a lateral temperature gradient and planar fabricated junctions
(lateral/planar approach).
These kind of devices are characterized by a limited contact area to available
thermal ﬂow surface and a limited thermal insulation of suspended region over
the heated surfaces.
2) Devices with a vertical temperature gradient and planar fabricated junctions
(vertical/planar approach).
These generators require an additional packaging step to assemble the pla-
nar fabricated junctions array in a vertical thermal ﬂow adapted geometry. A
typical example of vertical/planar approach is reported in [70, 71].
3) Devices with a diagonal temperature gradient and planar fabricated junctions
(diagonal/planar approach).
Present approach makes use of a combination of high and low thermal con-
ductivity material for the substrate, in order to generate a diagonal substrate
temperature diﬀerence, reﬂected as a linear gradient in the embedded ther-
moelectric material couples [72].
4) Devices with a vertical temperature gradient and vertical planar fabricated
junctions (vertical/vertical approach).
The vertical/vertical approach is the most common design method, largely
adopted by the industry for Peltier coolers and bulk/thick ﬁlm TEGs.

TEG Integration in Wearable Devices
In the last years, the growing interest in wearable electronic devices motivated
the development of new materials and microfabrication technologies for the
realization of smart functional clothing, with the integration of ultra-low power
consumption sensors, actuators, and circuits into the textile. The main challenges
are represented by the diﬃculty in realizing ﬂexible and performing devices that
can be rolled, bent, or folded without losing functionality. To this end, eﬀorts are
also devoted to the development of low-cost ﬂexible encapsulation for enhancing
the lifetime of these wearable devices, protecting them accordingly to ensure
reliable performance during use.
To obtain full exploitation in practical implementations, wearable electronics
also requires the adoption of new solutions for harvesting and storing energy for
the devices power supply. Energy harvesting of thermal, mechanical, and solar
energy sources available to a garment is an emerging technology that is able to
potentially become a good alternative to batteries, because it is a ﬂexible, light
weight and self-renewing technology.
In the following, the discussion will be focused on thermal energy harvesting. In
literature, numerous works discussed the optimal design and fabrication of TEGs
for wearable applications, but few results were published about truly ready-to-use
wearable solutions. In [73] promising results on thermoelectric polymer-coated
commercial fabric were discussed, which represent a starting point for the
development of ﬂexible, air-permeable, wearable, fabric-based TEGs. A ther-
mopile was realized on a substrate of commercial fabric by connecting in
series thin strips of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT:PSS) coated polyester fabric.
Silver wires were used as conductive connections, and silver paint was applied
to the contact regions between the wire and the strip to reduce the contact
resistance (Figure 10.3). Electrical measurements of electrical conductivity
and Seebeck coeﬃcient versus temperature conﬁrmed the p-type nature of the
semiconductor. A fabric TEG consisting of 5 PEDOT:PSS coated strips generated
an output voltage of 4.30 mV at a thermal gradient of 75.2 K, with a maximum
power of 12.29 nW, in matched load conditions. These results are interesting,
but the proposed solution is still far from being ready for direct application in
wearable context, in which the available temperature diﬀerence for the Seebeck
generation is limited to a few degrees.
In [74] a wireless two-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system fully
powered by a TEG was presented. The TEG, composed of 10 sections having a
total hot plates area of 64 cm2 in contact with the skin surface, was designed to
operate in typical indoor conditions, with room temperature ranging between
21 and 26 ∘C. The generator placed on the head of the patient, produced about
30 μW/cm2, at room temperature of 23 ∘C. In [75] the above system was
improved and integrated in an oﬃce-style shirt (Figure 10.4). By spreading 17
small TEG modules having a thickness of 6.5 mm over the T-shirt, a power within
the 0.8–1 mW range was harvested during sedentary activities in the oﬃce,
increasing up to about 3 mW during walking activity in indoor environment,
owing to the forced convection.

In [76] the same authors evaluated the impact of the textile on the harvested
power by a TEG, for diﬀerent ways of integration in a T-shirt: the TEG realized
by sandwiching a thermopile between two aluminum heat spreading plates was
placed under the shirt in contact with the body skin. Experiments showed that
the textile in contact with the cold plate of the device improves the heat spread-
ing around the radiator, increasing the eﬀective area of thermal exchange, as the
heat conduction is greater along the cotton ﬁbers yarn than across the textile. A
more comfortable TEG integration in garments was obtained by using ﬂexible
carbon fabric-based spreading layers glued on the inner T-shirt side, with an
improvement of the power generation of 30% compared with rigid aluminum
plates. Results showed that textile can be used as an eﬀective fabric radiator. In the
ﬁnal version proposed for integration in clothing, the device was hidden between
two cotton layers, in order to be completely invisible, comfortable for users and
easily handled during washing and ironing. Francioso et al. realized also a proto-
type integrating an array of 100 thin ﬁlms thermocouples of Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3,

220

with an open circuit output voltage of 430 mV at 40 ∘C and an electrical output
power up to 32 nW with matched load [77, 78]. Veri et al. also designed and
realized a fully electrical DC–DC ASIC converter designed for TEG for energy
harvesting applications coupled with a thick screen-printed generator with very
high eﬃciency [79–82].
Kim et al. [83] optimized the fabrication process of screen-printed Bi2Te3 and
Sb2Te3 thick ﬁlms on a glass fabric. As a result, an array of 196 thermoelec-
tric p–n dots were printed and well arranged on a glass fabric (Figure 10.5b). A
band-type ﬂexible glass fabric TEG with 11 couples of Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 500 μm
thick-ﬁlms was also fabricated (Figure 10.5a) and applied to human skin, gener-
ating an open-circuit output voltage of 2.9 mV, with a harvested output power of
3 μW on matched load at an air temperature of 15 ∘C.

Strategies for Performance Enhancements
and Organic Materials
The present section will review the emerging technologies and methods aimed at
advancing to new state-of-the-art thermoelectric knowledge and new materials
applications and reports the power factor enhancement trends devoted to or
compatible with low temperature applications, such as the wearable generators.
With regard to the materials optimization methods, the electrical conductivity,
the Seebeck coeﬃcient, and thermal conductivity are not independent, so it is
diﬃcult to optimize a single parameter without making the other ones worse.
In order to overcome these limitations, the newest eﬀorts are oriented toward:
(i) power factor (P = S2𝜎) enhancement of both organic and inorganic materials
by quantum size transport eﬀects and (ii) new materials development (mainly on
n-type polymers) about the organic semiconductor.
The pioneering work of Hicks and Dresselhaus [84] opened the discussion and
research about quantum size eﬀects and nanoscale advantages in thermoelectric
materials, while the current strategies about the inorganic materials are dealing
with diﬀerent methods to improve the performance of well-known thermoelec-
tric semiconductors, by means of exploitation of quantum size transport eﬀects,
nanoscale/microscale composite matrices, and band engineering.
It is widely accepted that the optimization of thermoelectrics materials pre-
senting the following physical properties are highly desirable:
• High mobility
• High density of state eﬀective mass
• Enhanced phonon scattering
• Low lattice thermal conductivity
• Low carrier inertial mass at given carrier concentration
• Large number of degenerate conducting bands.
With respect to the band engineering methods and technologies to increase
the Seebeck coeﬃcient, a review of the three most promising techniques are
reported, in particular the Electronic Resonance States by distortions of the
electronic density of states (DOS), the Modulation Doping, and the Energy
Filtering. Published results of the scientiﬁc community about the thermal con-
ductivity reduction and phonon scattering approach strategies are intentionally
not reported here, even if their importance is undeniable.
The Electronic Resonance States approach exploits the eﬀect of a dopant
element inducing energy levels in excess of DOS near the Fermi level and con-
tributes to an enhanced thermopower; this eﬀect is a band structure property
independent of the temperature. Friedel [85] introduced the concept of an
impurity-induced resonant state described as a bound state with a positive
energy with respect to the band edge, with similar energy as an extended state.
In order to better understand the eﬀect of the distortion of the electronic DOS,
the equation of the ﬁgure of merit for thermoelectrics can be written as [86]
ZT = S2𝜎
𝜆T = (S2n)
(𝜇
𝜆
)
qT

222
10 Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting for Powering Wearable Electronics
where S is the Seebeck coeﬃcient, 𝜎and 𝜆are the electrical and thermal
conductivities, and μ is the carrier mobility. Big eﬀorts have been devoted to
increase the μ/𝜆ratio, but this approach has a theoretical limitation because of
the fact that the thermal conductivity has a lower limit, the so-called amorphous
limit, where the phonon mean free path equals the atomic distance [87, 88]. A
second way to increase the ﬁgure of merit is to modulate the term (S2n) (directly
related to the power factor P = S2𝜎) by engineering distortions of the electronic
DOS near the Fermi level, as described earlier.
Jaworski et al. demonstrated that in Bi2Te3 semiconductor the Sn doping
element provides an excess DOS about 15 meV below the valence band edge;
this modiﬁcation of DOS enhances the Seebeck factor at room temperature [89].
However, the resonant state eﬀect decreases at high temperatures, so it is a good
candidate for low temperature applications.
Figure 10.6 shows the thermopower data for Pb- and Ge-doped Bi2−xSnxTe3
samples at 300 K; the measured data showed an enhanced thermopower above
the standard Pisarenko relation, conﬁrming the eﬀect of a resonant level [86].
The sample with x = 0.015 has double the Seebeck coeﬃcient of similarly doped
samples without Sn. The power factor of such samples is also enhanced above the
values (solid and dashed lines) calculated using a classical parabolic band with the
eﬀective mass for the upper valence bands (UVB). The data points are obtained
for the diﬀerent acceptor impurities as marked in the ﬁgure.

The Modulation Doping, realized by ﬁeld eﬀect electrostatic modulation,
represents a convenient tool to control the carrier concentration in nanostruc-
tures such as silicon NMs because of its capability to decrease ionized impurity
scattering. The methodology related to ﬁeld eﬀect transistor (FET) principle and
regimes was extensively investigated and modeled in silicon industry in the past
and it helps obtain high carrier densities and mobilities enhancing the power
factor [90–92]. Neophytou and Kosina showed that electrostatic gating of p-type
Si NWs investigated up to 20 nm in diameter enhances the power factors up to
ﬁve times versus standard doped channels [93]. A main limitation is related to
small areas of material that can be aﬀected by remote doping or fabrication of
gate/multigate electrodes. Figure 10.7 shows the thermoelectric power factor
of gated NWs with diﬀerent diameters versus carrier density together with the
doped case power factor as solid-black line [110].
The energy ﬁltering technique allows an improvement of the Seebeck coeﬃ-
cient and the power factor in structures with embedded nanometric precipitates
or potential barriers. The technique is based on low energy carriers ﬁlter-
ing/blocking by the energy barrier at polycrystalline grain boundaries, while
highest energy electrons continue to give strong contribution to the conduction
mechanism. Nevertheless, the energy ﬁltering eﬀect is not able to change the
well-known dependency of 𝜎and S on the carrier density n [94]. About the
energy ﬁltering approach applied to quantum wells structures, Neophytou et al.
reported that energy ﬁltering allows improvement of the Seebeck coeﬃcient and
the power factor in superlattices up to 27% [95]. Boron-doped nanocrystalline
silicon including modulation doping and energy ﬁltering strategies has been
shown to exhibit an impressive power factor of about 15 mW/m/K [96].
10.6.1
Organic Thermoelectric Materials
In the domain of the wearable applications and whatever applications where
the generated power cost is a very sensible issue, organic materials are good
candidates for power generation with their clear advantages in terms of easy pro-
cessibility, ﬂexibility, lightweight, raw material abundance, and low-cost manu-
facturing. Moreover, organic semiconductors show thermal conductivity around

224
10 Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting for Powering Wearable Electronics
0.5 W/m/K, which is very close to the lower limit of inorganic materials [97].
Thermal conduction in conjugated polymers is generally controlled by phonons.
Diﬀerent polymers such as polyaniline (PANI), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythio-
phene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):
tosylate (PEDOT–Tos), polythiophene (PTH), polyacetylene (PA), polycar-
bazoles (PC), polyphenylenevinylene (PPV), and polypyrrole (PPY) have been
investigated for many years, and some of them present very good ﬁgure of
merit values, as described below. Best organic thermoelectric materials demon-
strated ZT values of about 0.42 for the p-type PEDOT: PSS [98] and 0.20
for (n-type) coordination polymers poly[Kx(Ni-ett)]; as example of complete
thermoelectric generator based on organic materials, Sun et al. fabricated a

[99]. The device produced an open-circuit voltage of 0.26 V with 80 K of
temperature gradient, and a short-circuit current of about 10 mA. These values
are among the highest power densities reported for organic TEMs. Figure 10.8
shows the properties and long-term stability of the fabricated TEM with a
packing density of 0.40.
About current trends for optimization and power factor enhancement, we can
identify diﬀerent routes for materials optimization; for conducting polymers, a
suggested method is to synthesize crystalline conductive polymers in order to dis-
criminate eﬀects of counterions, polymer chains, and assemblies. In addition, the
alignment of polymer chains, interfaces, and crystallinity showed a huge impact
on thermal conductivity of polymer ﬁlms and charge transport [100].
Another tool for ﬁne tuning of this family of materials is related to doping
procedures, which introduce long-range electrostatic interactions aﬀecting the
interaction potential between adjacent polymer chains, the vibrational modes,
and the cohesion energy. The optimization of the oxidation level in order to pre-
serve thermoelectric properties and modulate the DOS at Fermi level is an addi-
tional enhancement method, similarly for the inorganic semiconductor [101].
Finally, the expected evolution of the applications scenarios is in good agree-
ment with the latest market needs, and oriented toward the Internet of Things
(IOT) and Internet of Everything (IOE) sensors network demand. A very attrac-
tive topic is represented by the thermoelectric textiles based on organic polymers
that may eﬀectively solve the integration issues, the low cost requirements, and
safety (nontoxic) materials wished for wearable generators.

Thermoelectric Modules as Eﬃcient Heat Flux Sensors

Introduction
Heat ﬂux is the quantity of heat transmitted through an isothermal surface per
unit time. Heat ﬂux per unit of an isothermal surface is heat ﬂux density. Heat ﬂux
is a vector and each component of it is numerically equal to the amount of heat
transmitted per unit time through unit area taken perpendicular to the direction
of the component.
Heat ﬂuxes accompany most physical processes, natural and technological phe-
nomena, and are a result of human activity.
Measurement of heat ﬂuxes, as well as of temperature, allows controlling
these processes to obtain necessary information for a variety of control and
optimization tasks. Heat ﬂux and temperature sensors ﬁnd a signiﬁcant niche
in the market of modern sensors. Many existing and new applications require
accurate measurement of heat ﬂuxes.
11.1.1
Applications of Heat Flux Sensors
Measurement of heat ﬂuxes is necessary in various ﬁelds of science, technology,
industry, ecology security, and so on. Here a list of the application ﬁelds is pre-
sented, which is, of course, not complete.

11.1.2
Units of Heat Flux and Characteristics of Sensors
The heat ﬂux Qs is measured in watts per unit of surface area s perpendicular to
its direction – W/m2.
Qs = Qa
s
(11.1)
If the area is known, it can be measured in terms of total heat ﬂux – Qa.
Qa = Qs × s
(11.2)
Heat ﬂux sensors have sensitivity to the heat ﬂux. The sensitivity can also have
two types of units.
The sensitivity Se to the measured heat ﬂux is the ratio of the electrical sig-
nal of the sensor (typically microvolts) to the heat ﬂux density Qs. The units are
μV/(W/m2).
Se = U
Qs
(11.3)
The integral (absolute) sensitivity Sa is the ratio of the electrical signal of the
sensor to the total heat ﬂux Qa. The units are V/W.
Sa = U
Qa
(11.4)
Sa =
U
s × Pe
= Se
s
(11.5)
The term integral sensitivity makes heat ﬂux sensors similar to photodetec-
tors, since radiation is also an energy ﬂux. Heat ﬂux sensors are often used to
measure thermal radiation. Thus, they are called thermal radiation detectors, to
distinguish them from quantum photodetectors.
For thermal radiation (heat ﬂux) sensors the usual parameters of photode-
tectors are applied: noise U2
t , sensitivity threshold Fth, NEP (noise-equivalent
power), detectivity D∗.
The spectral density of RMS of thermal noise voltage U2
t is equal to
U2
t = 4kTRΔf
(11.6)
where k is the Boltzmann constant (=1.38 × 10−23 J/K); T is the sensor
temperature; R is the sensor electric resistance; and Δf is the frequency band in
which the measurements are done.
The sensitivity threshold Fth is the value of the heat ﬂux, causing the sensor out-
put voltage equal to the voltage noise RMS, with reference to the unit bandwidth
and unit area of the sensor. The units are W/(cmHz)
1/2.
Fth =
√
U2
t
Sa
√
sΔf
(11.7)
where Sa is the integral volt–watt se1nsitivity and s is the sensor working area
in cm2.

The inverse value of Fth is called the detectivity D∗.
D∗=

11.1.3
Modern Heat Flux Sensors
The principle of operation of most heat ﬂux sensors is based on the method
of “additional wall,” which was formulated by Schmidt at the beginning of
the last century [1]. The “additional wall” with a known thermal conductivity
K is located in the path of the heat ﬂux Q to be measured. The temperature
gradient ΔT between the wall sides is proportional to the amount of heat ﬂux.
The thermal resistance RT of the wall is the reciprocal value of the thermal
conductance K:
ΔT = RT × Q
(11.9)
Thus, it is necessary to measure the sensor temperature diﬀerence created
by the heat ﬂux. At a known thermal resistance of the sensor the measured
temperature diﬀerence allows obtaining the heat ﬂux value [2].
Most state-of-art heat ﬂux sensors [3] are made on the basis of diﬀerential ther-
mocouples connected in series (Figure 11.1).
The temperature diﬀerence ΔT between two junctions of a thermocouple,
separated by a layer of the medium with a given thermal resistance, induces the
electric voltage diﬀerence E, which is proportional to the temperature diﬀerence
and depends on the material properties of the thermocouple. It is the Seebeck
eﬀect.
E = 𝛼× ΔT
(11.10)
where 𝛼is the Seebeck coeﬃcient.
Most diﬀerential thermocouples involve the Seebeck eﬀect in metals.
Values of the Seebeck coeﬃcient (thermo-EMF – thermal electromotive
force – at temperature diﬀerence of 1 ∘C) for various metals and alloys are well
known. However, for metals the Seebeck coeﬃcient is relatively low – maximum
of tens of μV/∘C.
Table 11.1 gives the Seebeck coeﬃcient for diﬀerent materials paired with
platinum [4].

Serial connection of many thermocouples (Figure 11.1) is used to increase the
sensitivity. The lateral density of the thermocouples in state-of-the-art heat ﬂux
sensors can reach up to 1000–2000 thermocouples per centimeter square. This
allows a multiple increase (by number N of thermocouples in series) of the ther-
moelectric output voltage and, as a result, of the sensor sensitivity.
E = N × 𝛼× ΔT
(11.11)
Modern sensors measure heat ﬂux from 10−3 W/m2. The upper limit of the
measured heat ﬂux density reaches values of the order 107 W/m2. Thus, heat ﬂux
sensors are able to cover a considerable range, 10−3–107 W/m2.
11.1.4
Thermoelectric Heat Flux Sensors
Recently, interest in the use of thermoelectric modules as heat ﬂux sensors has
grown [5–7]. Thermoelectric modules are widely used for cooling (Peltier eﬀect)
or generation of energy (Peltier and Seebeck eﬀects). In heat ﬂux sensors the

11.1 Introduction
237
thermoelectric eﬀect – the Seebeck eﬀect – is also used, which is the physical
basis for the diﬀerential thermocouple sensors too.
The construction of thermoelectric modules is similar to that of the matrix
of thermocouples. It is a sequential connection of thermoelements (pellets)
of diﬀerent n- and p-type semiconductors. Only, here the “couple” is a pair of
semiconductor thermoelements with diﬀerent conductivity (n- and p-types).
The Seebeck eﬀect in semiconductors is many times higher than that in metals.
For example, in copper–constantan thermocouple the Seebeck coeﬃcient
of a couple is about 38 μV/∘C. In a thermoelectric module – for one p–n
thermoelement pair – it is more than 400 μV/∘C.
This advantage makes the use of semiconductor thermoelectric modules
as heat ﬂux sensors, along with thermoelectric coolers and generators, very
promising.
While thermoelectric modules have long been used as generators and coolers,
this advantage for the sensors applications has not been realized for a long time.
The key reason is a low degree of integration of thermoelements. For a long time,
it was at the level of 100–150 pellets per centimeter squared. With such a low
elements density, the thermoelectric modules used as heat ﬂux sensors lose out
to matrices of diﬀerential thermocouples.
At a given temperature diﬀerence the serial connection gives a sum of signals of
individual junctions, pairs of thermocouples. In metal thermocouples the speciﬁc
signal is much less than in semiconductor junctions, but due to the high degree
of integration this shortcoming is oﬀset.
However, the modern trend of miniaturization of thermoelectric modules
(Figure 11.2), mainly because of the needs of optoelectronics, where thermoelec-
tric cooling is widely used, has led to signiﬁcant progress in the construction of
thermoelectric micromodules – extremely miniature design and dense packing
of pellets. This allows eﬀectively using them as heat ﬂux sensors [8].
Advanced thermoelectric micromodules are comparable with the sensors
based on diﬀerential thermocouples in dimensions and dense integration,

which allows us to use them as heat ﬂux sensors. Miniature and high-density
packaged modules are manufactured by two technologies: thin ﬁlm (new) and
bulk (mature) technology (Figure 11.3). Each technology has its advantages and
limits of use, but both provide the ability to produce fascinatingly miniature
modules (down to the level of 1 mm2 and less), very small thermoelement sizes,
and high density of packing.
One of the disadvantages of semiconductor modules in comparison with
thermocouples may be the comparatively high temperature sensitivity of the
parameters. This is the other side of the coin. However, in modern applications,
heat ﬂux sensors are most often used with temperature sensors. So, advanced
electronics makes it easy to realize the mathematical processing of the results
with necessary corrections taking into account temperature dependences known
in advance. Moreover, such temperature sensors can be directly integrated into
a miniature thermoelectric module.
11.2
Applications of Thermoelectric Modules
Heat ﬂux sensors complement the two already existing niches of thermoelectric
modules (coolers and generators) [9] with a very promising new one (Table 11.2).
Thus, thermoelectric coolers and heat ﬂux sensors are “extreme” ways of using
thermoelectric eﬀects. In the ﬁrst case it is the Peltier eﬀect, and in the second it
is the Seebeck eﬀect.
Thermoelectric generation is based on the two opposite thermoelectric
eﬀects – the third case.

11.3
Parameters of Thermoelectric Heat Flux Sensors
11.3.1
Integral Sensitivity Sa
The heat ﬂux Qa through the sensor is expressed by its total thermal resistance
RT and the temperature diﬀerence ΔT:
Qa = (Th −Tc)
RT
(11.12)
where Th and Tc are the temperature on the hot and cold sides of the sensor,
respectively.
The electrical signal E of the thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensor is the following:
E = 𝛼× 2N × (Th −Tc)
(11.13)
where 𝛼is the Seebeck coeﬃcient of a thermoelement (averaged value in a pair
of n- and p-type of elements) and 2N is the number of thermoelements.
Therefore,
E = 𝛼× 2N × Qa × RT
(11.14)
Then the integral (absolute) sensitivity Sa is given by:
Sa = E
Qa
= 𝛼× 2N × RT
(11.15)
In the ideal case (heat ﬂows only through the thermoelements)
RT = 1
KT
=
1
2N × k × a × b
h
(11.16)
where KT is the thermal conductance of the sensor; k is the average thermal con-
ductivity for the thermoelement, and a×b
h is the ratio of the cross-section (a × b)
of the element to its height (h), which is the form-factor (f ) of a thermoelement.
f = a × b
h
(11.17)
Thus, the sensor sensitivity is obtained as
Sa = 1
f × 𝛼
k
(11.18)
The thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensor sensitivity is determined by the ratio of the
Seebeck coeﬃcient 𝛼to the thermal conductivity of the thermoelement k and is
inversely proportional to the form-factor f of the thermoelement (pellet).
The important consequence of expression (11.18) is that the sensitivity does not
depend on the number of the thermoelements in the sensor. The inverse propor-
tionality to the thermoelement form-factor works instead. The sensitivity can be
increased by smaller cross sections a × b of thermoelements at a relatively larger
height h.

11.3 Parameters of Thermoelectric Heat Flux Sensors
241
11.3.2
Sensitivity Se
The sensitivity Se to the density of heat ﬂux is derived from the integral sensitivity
Sa, if you multiply it by the area of the sensitive surface of the sensor s:
Se = Sa × s
(11.19)
11.3.3
Thermal Resistance RT
The value of the thermal resistance RT of the thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensor is
crucial for its application.
RT =
1
2N × k × f
(11.20)
First of all, it is the thermal resistance RT that provides a temperature diﬀerence
ΔT (11.9), which causes the signal. Higher the thermal resistance RT, higher the
sensitivity of the sensor.
On the other hand, the eﬀect of the presence of the measuring sensor (the
“additional wall”), that is, its thermal resistance should be preferably minimized.
Therefore, for a correct measurement the thermal resistance of the sensor should
be signiﬁcantly lower than the thermal resistance of the environment in which the
heat ﬂux is measured.
Table 11.3 shows thermal resistance values of a number of popular media for
the thickness of the order of heat ﬂux sensors often applied.
According to this table, the thermal resistance of a heat ﬂux sensor in most
practical applications should be no greater than 10−2–10−3 K/(W/m2). Then it
will not cause distortion in the heat ﬂuxes to be measured reliably.
11.3.4
Noise Level
The spectral density of voltage RMS of thermal noise U2
t can be written as
U2
t = 4kBT × ACR × Δf
(11.21)
where kB, the Boltzmann constant, equals 1.38 × 10−23 J/K; T is the sensor average
temperature; ACR is the sensor resistance; and Δf is the frequency band in which
the measurements are done.
11.3.5
Sensitivity Threshold
Sensitivity threshold is the value of the heat ﬂux causing the sensor output voltage
equal to the RMS noise voltage.
Sensitivity threshold with reference to the unit pass band and unit area of the
sensor [W/cm Hz1/2]:
Fth =
√

where Sa is the volt–watt sensitivity [V/W]; s is the sensor working area in cm2.

Sensitivity
11.4.1.1
Method
As the sensors are measuring devices, their calibration is required to ensure high
accuracy for applications. Calibration allows getting the coeﬃcient of the output
signal proportionality to the heat ﬂux.
For calibration, two methods are known.

244
11 Thermoelectric Modules as Eﬃcient Heat Flux Sensors
One method is the use of an external heat ﬂux reference source [10–12]. With
a known heat ﬂux reference source and a corresponding response of the sensor
to be calibrated the sensitivity is determined.
This calibration is carried out with the use of special equipment and in the
laboratory. It is available only during periodical maintenance of the sensor and
requires removal of the sensor from the measured object. So it is time consuming,
expensive and limited in application.
Another method is to embed a reference heat source into the sensor [13, 14].
When electric power is applied to the embedded heater, it produces heat of a
known value. It results in a signal of the sensor.
For example, it is a vacuum deposition of a resistive heater to one of the sensor
sides [14].
With this calibration method the sensor is named self-calibrating. It is possible
to calibrate it at any time without external hardware.
A disadvantage of this method is the assumption that a share of the thermal
power of the reference source that passes through the sensor is known in advance.
Ideally, it is equal to half of the electric power, but in practice this ratio could diﬀer.
And this causes mistakes in calibration.
Another downside is that the reference heat source should be integrated in the
sensor. This complicates the design and production costs.
At the same time, thermoelectric modules have long been widely used for
cooling and power generation. In these applications a number of measurement
parameters of the modules are used to determine their quality and performance
properties.
Such parameters are the thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit Z, the internal electrical
resistance ACR, and, less commonly, the time constant 𝜏[15, 16].
The use of these parameters to specify the basic properties of thermoelectric
heat ﬂux sensors is also attractive.
The formula for the sensitivity shows its dependence on the ratio:
Sa = 2N × a × RT
(11.33)
It is possible to express this formula (11.33) by the parameters Z and ACR of a
thermoelectric module.
The ﬁgure of merit Z of the thermoelectric module can be written as
Z = (2N × 𝛼)2
KT × ACR = (2N × 𝛼)2 × RT
ACR
(11.34)
Therefore,
𝛼× RT =
1
(2N)2 × 𝛼Z × ACR
(11.35)
Then,
Sa =
1
𝛼× 2N Z × ACR
(11.36)
This is a key formula of the new method of calibrating the thermoelectric heat
ﬂux sensors by measuring the ﬁgure of merit Z and AC resistance ACR of the
sensor [17].

11.4 Self-Calibration Method of Thermoelectric Heat Flux Sensors
245
The design of a thermoelectric module (the number of pellets 2N) is known
in advance. The Seebeck coeﬃcient 𝛼of the thermoelectric material used for
manufacturing of sensors can be controlled. At a given area of the sensitive sur-
face s, the number of the thermoelements in the sensors 2N and known Seebeck
coeﬃcient of the thermoelectric material 𝛼, it is easy to determine the sensitivity
(Sa and Se) by Eqs. (11.36) and (11.5) respectively, by measuring the thermoelec-
tric ﬁgure of merit Z and the resistance ACR of the sensor.
The calibration by the new method does not require applying reference ther-
mal sources, does not need maintenances of sensors, and the calibration proce-
dure can be performed with any periodicity. The method is characterized by high
accuracy.
11.4.1.2
Examples
Four samples of diﬀerent types of thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensors are produced.
The design and geometrical parameters of the sensors are shown in Table 11.4.
Two types of calibration of the samples were done: using precision external heat
source and by the proposed method. Both measurements were carried out in the
temperature range of −20 to +80 ∘C. The results of calibration and temperature
dependence of the sensitivity were compared.

Calibration by the new method is no more than 2% diﬀerent from the results
of the calibration with a reference source.
This is a good result for the practical use of the new method.

11 Thermoelectric Modules as Eﬃcient Heat Flux Sensors
11.5.1
Dependence on Physical Properties
As follows from Table 11.7 thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensors should be optimized
by the physical properties (𝛼, k, 𝜎).
For sensitivity, the Seebeck coeﬃcient 𝛼should be higher with a lower thermal
conductivity k.
On the contrary, a fast response (𝜏) and lower thermal resistance RT require high
thermal conductivity k.
Table 11.7 shows that a number of parameters aﬀect the eﬃciency of thermo-
electric heat ﬂux sensors in diﬀerent directions. Only one parameter in all cases
should be as large as possible – it is the Seebeck coeﬃcient.
11.5.2
Design Parameters
The dependence of the properties of the sensors on the design parameters is also
diﬀerent (Table 11.8).
• High sensitivity is achieved by reducing the cross-section ab and increasing the
height h of thermocouples, and by growth of the sensitive area s of the sensor.
• At the same time, lower thermal resistance RT and dynamic parameters (𝜏)
require a greater cross-section ab and lower height h of a thermoelement.
• Only the thermal resistance and detectivity depend on thermocouples number.
The dependence is multidirectional.

Features of Thermoelectric Heat Flux Sensor
Design
The above parameters of thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensors do not take into
account practical design features of the sensor.
Let us consider these features. Figure 11.6 shows a cross section of a thermo-
electric heat ﬂux sensor.
The special features of its design, in contrast to that of a thermoelectric module,
are the following.
• External heat-conducting substrates
• Ceramic plates of module (not taken into account in some calculations)
• Sealing that ﬁlls the entire interior of the sensor
These features should be allowed for in the accurate simulation of a heat ﬂux
sensor.
First of all, it concerns a thermal “circuit” of the sensor. Figure 11.7 shows
the equivalent diagram of the heat ﬂux sensor with all the essential elements of
design.
The equivalent circuit of the sensor makes it possible to introduce certain
corrections to the basic formulae.

11 Thermoelectric Modules as Eﬃcient Heat Flux Sensors
Obviously, the thermo-EMF of the sensor results from the temperature
diﬀerence on the sides of the thermocouples ΔT′.
E = 𝛼× 2N × ΔT′
(11.39)
ΔT′ = ΔT × RT
∑Ri
(11.40)
The thermo-EMF depends on the ratio of the thermal resistance of the internal
part of the sensor (thermocouples and ﬁller) RT to the full thermal resistance
∑Riincluding the remaining external parts of the system – (R1, R2, Rc) for a given
total temperature diﬀerence (ΔT).
However, the sensitivity to the heat ﬂux according to formula (11.18) does not
depend on the thermal resistance of the external elements and is only dependent
on the internal thermal resistance (thermocouples and ﬁller). The thermal resis-
tance of the module with the ﬁller is calculated taking into account the parallel
thermal resistance of the thermocouples and the ﬁller:
1
RT
=
1
RTE
+ 1
Rp
(11.41)
With respect to the thermal conductance of the internal part of the sensor, the
sum of thermal conductance values of the thermocouples and the ﬁller is given by
KT = KTEG + Kp
(11.42)
KT = 2N × kTE × f + 2N × kp × f × (1 −y) = 2N × f × [kTE + kp(1 −y)]
(11.43)
where y is the ﬁlling factor of thermoelements
(
y = 2Nab
s
)
.
Then the expression for sensitivity takes the form
Sa = 1
f ×
𝛼
kTE + kp(1 −y)
(11.44)
The sensor sensitivity is reduced due to the ﬁller.
However, additional thermal conductance of the ﬁller plays a positive role
because it reduces the thermal resistance of the sensor as a whole, which is
important for practical applications – the “additional wall.”
This more complex thermal equivalent circuit of the sensor inﬂuences its
dynamic characteristics.
11.7
Optimization of Sensors Design
Properties of thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensors depend on the design parame-
ters. The technology of thermoelectric micromodules allows manufacturing such
modules in a wide range of dimensions, degree of miniaturization, packing fac-
tors, thermocouples size, and so on.
So, it is possible to develop both individual and series heat ﬂux sensors opti-
mized for diﬀerent applications.

11.7 Optimization of Sensors Design
251
The company TEC Microsystems uses this practice in the development and
manufacturing of thermoelectric micromodules for cooling and generation. The
same well-tested approaches are applicable to sensor optimization.
The key parameters of thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensors are interrelated:

As seen, the eﬃciency of thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensors depends on
1) properties of the thermoelectric material – 𝛼, k, 𝜎, Z;
2) design parameters of the thermoelectric module and its thermoelements – f ,
h, 2N, y;
3) sensitive surface area s; it can be the size of the thermoelectric module and
larger.
11.7.1
Properties of Thermoelectric Material
The properties of thermoelectric material are speciﬁed by its manufacturing tech-
nology. These parameters can hardly be varied signiﬁcantly for sensor optimizing.
The only important thing is to select a material with a maximum Seebeck coeﬃ-
cient 𝛼, typically at the level of the average values of 200 μV/K.
In Table 11.9, the parameters of the typical thermoelectric material are given.
11.7.2
Parameters of Thermoelectric Module
The parameters of the thermoelectric module can be controlled over a wide
range. Modern technologies allow producing modules of pellets in wide ranges
of cross sections and heights, package densities, and element numbers.
Therefore, a detailed analysis of the dependence of sensor parameters on these
design features is of primary interest for optimization problems.

Table 11.10 shows the values of the form-factor of pellets.
Correspondingly, in Figure 11.8 the available range of sensitivities of heat ﬂux
sensors is marked.
11.7.2.2
Thermoelement Height
According to expression (11.45), at a given value of thermoelement cross-section
a × b, it follows that the sensitivity increases with the increasing of the height of
the thermoelement h.
However, with the increasing of the height of the sensor its time constant grows
too, according to formula (11.48). Therefore, obtaining a highly sensitive sensor
together with high-speed performance is the optimization task for a particular
application.
In Figure 11.9, the dependences of sensitivity and time constant on the ther-
moelement height for their various cross sections are given.

Figure 11.10 Calculated dependence of the detectivity D* and time constant 𝜏of the height
of thermocouples at their diﬀerent packing density y.
The fastest and most sensitive sensors are possible using thermocouples of
minimum cross section of 0.2 mm. High sensitivity is attainable for large element
cross sections, but this reduces performance owing to the larger thermoelement
height of such sensors.
Figure 11.10 depicts the calculated dependence of the detectability of the sensor
on the height and packing density of the thermocouples.
The reduced dependence of D∗is similar to that of sensitivity. The value
D∗increases with increasing height of thermoelements. At the same time, a
less dense packing of thermocouples, y = 0.36, has an advantage compared to
y = 0.44. But it has a simple explanation as a less dense packing implies a larger
sensor, and correspondingly, more signal is collected by the sensor. However, a
smaller packing density results in a larger time constant.

11.7.2.3
Dimensions of Sensors
The sensitivity to heat ﬂux density Se depends on the dimensions of the heat
absorption side of the sensor. In a thermoelectric module, it is its hot side.
The size of a thermoelectric module side is determined by the number of ele-
ments, their cross section, and density of packing.
Figure 11.11 shows the calculated relative sensitivity for thermoelectric sensors
from diﬀerent series of modules (thermocouples of diﬀerent sections and height).

A larger size of the sensors means a larger number of thermoelements in them.

However, a greater number of thermoelements involves higher manufacturing
complexity and, accordingly, a higher price of the sensor.
It should be noted that it is not the number of thermocouples that determines
sensitivity. This dependence does not exist. It is the size of the module’s receiving
side that increases with the number of thermoelements.
11.7.3
Features of Real Design
The above dependences of the basic parameters of heat ﬂux sensors on the main
structural elements of the thermoelectric module give an idea of the order of
magnitude. However, more accurate estimations of the main parameters require
consideration of the real design of the sensor (Figure 11.13).

11 Thermoelectric Modules as Eﬃcient Heat Flux Sensors
The actual sensor design must take into account the following (Figure 11.14):
1) A ﬁller/sealant almost always ﬁlls the interior of the sensor. First of all, it
ensures protection from moisture and other environmental factors. Secondly,
the correct operation of the sensor by the method of “additional wall” depends
on the sensor thermal resistance. The lower the thermal resistance, the less
distortion of the measured heat ﬂux. However, the thermal resistance of the
ﬁller contributes to the thermal resistance of the module. Thus, the total
thermal resistance increases and the temperature drops are reduced. The
ﬁller eﬀect should be optimized.
2) To increase the relative sensitivity of the sensors, its sensitive side may have an
increased size in comparison with that of the thermoelectric module. On the
one hand, it increases the sensitivity; on the other hand, it results in some inho-
mogeneity on the receiving surface. It also increases the sensor time constant.
Figure 11.15 demonstrates the above dependences with the example of a par-
ticular heat ﬂux sensor.

Investigation of Sensors Performance
11.9.1
General Provisions
The purpose of the investigation is to study the characteristics of the developed
sensors.
The sensor electrical resistance ACR and ﬁgure of merit Z were measured at
diﬀerent temperatures in the thermostat by the Z-meter.
The purpose of the measurements in the thermostat is to ﬁnd the most conve-
nient method for the sensors’ calibration in a temperature range.
Two sensors of each type were measured.
The temperature dependences of the following parameters of the sensors were
studied:
• Figure of merit (Z-metering)
• Electrical resistance
• Thermo-EMF versus sensor heat load
• Sensor temperature diﬀerence at various heat loads
• Sensor thermal resistance
Note:
The ﬁgure of merit (Z-metering) and electrical resistance of the sensors were
also measured in the thermostat by the Z-meter with a massive thermal screen
in the area of the sensors, thus avoiding a temperature gradient in this area.
11.9.2
Calibration of Sensor Sensitivity
Two methods were used for calibration of the sensors’ sensitivity and the results
were compared.
First – calibration with precise reference heat source mounted to sensor sam-
ples. Temperature dependence and all measurements were done with use of the
machine DX8020 [19].
The sensors’ sensitivity (11.36) by a new method [17] in the same temperature
range was measured with samples placed into the thermostat DX2100 and with
use of Z-meter DX4190 [20].
For this new method (11.36) the standard temperature dependence of the See-
beck coeﬃcient for the material of micromodules was applied.
𝛼= 3,224788 × 10−11 × T3 −3,25788 × 10−8 × T2 + 1,137103 × 10−5
× T −9,387217 × 10−4
(11.49)
The resulting temperature dependences of sensitivity for the examined sensors
measured by the two methods are given in Table 11.14. On the basis of this table
the averaged polynomial dependence of sensor sensitivity on temperature is built
(temperature in Kelvin).
The results obtained by the two methods are in good agreement (Figure 11.16).

Sensitivity Temperature Dependence
We are to obtain the average sensitivity temperature dependence (Figure 11.17)
of the following polynomial form:
Sa = Sa0 × [(A2 × (T −T0 )2 + A1 × (T −T0) + A0)]
(11.50)
The coeﬃcients of the polynomial of the Sa temperature dependence of the
sensitivity Sa of the above series in the range of −50 to +80 ∘C and temperature
coeﬃcient in the calibration point (300 K) are shown in Table 11.15.
The diﬀerence in the temperature dependences (temperature coeﬃcients) is
associated with additional thermal conductance of the sensors’ ﬁller.

Figure 11.18 Temperature dependences of thermal resistance of sensors series HTX (a) and
HFX (b).
In the sensors of the series HTX the ﬁller occupies a larger volume, and
therefore the temperature dependence of their properties is less pronounced
than in the series HFX.
Similar tests of temperature dependences for the HRX sensor series are com-
plex, but the design of the sensors of this series is similar to that of the series HFX,
so the temperature dependences for the series HRX are taken to be the same as
for the series HFX.

Thermal Resistance
The experimental temperature dependences of thermal resistance of sensors are
shown in Figure 11.18. The thermal resistance change in the temperature range
of −20 to +80 ∘C is about 11%.
We are to obtain the temperature dependence of the average thermal resistance
(Figure 11.19) of the following polynomial form:
RT = RT0 × [(A2 × (T −T0 )2 + A1 × (T −T0) + A0)]
(11.51)
The coeﬃcients of the temperature dependence polynomials of the thermal
resistance of the sensors in the range of −50 to +80 ∘C and the temperature coef-
ﬁcient in the calibration point (300 K) are given in Table 11.16.

11.9.5
Typical Temperature Dependence of the Seebeck Coeﬃcient
Since the heat ﬂux sensor self-calibration method involves the thermoelectric
material parameter – the Seebeck coeﬃcient, it should be also given in the spec-
iﬁcations. It is the value at the standard temperature 300 K and the temperature
dependence is similar to the polynomials for sensitivity and thermal resistance.
The typical temperature dependence of the Seebeck coeﬃcient is shown
in Figure 11.20. In the coordinates (T −Ta) this dependence is as shown in
Figure 11.21. The coeﬃcients of the polynomials in the range −50 … +80 ∘C are
given in Table 11.17.
11.9.6
Conclusions
The methods of self-calibration of sensor sensitivity – direct measurements
with use of precise thermal reference source with the machine DX8020 [19]
and the new method [17] in the thermostat DX2100 by the Z-meter DX4190
[20] – showed approximately equal results.
For the self-calibration the value of the Seebeck coeﬃcient and its temperature
dependence are speciﬁed.

Heat Flux Sensors at the Market
Owing to innovative solutions to designing thermoelectric micromodules, such
thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensors have signiﬁcant advantages over the heat ﬂux
sensors of manufacturers known in the market (Table 11.18).

266
11 Thermoelectric Modules as Eﬃcient Heat Flux Sensors
1) High absolute sensitivity 10–50 times higher than in sensors based on
diﬀerential thermocouples.
2) Miniature design, due to a high degree of integration of thermal elements in
micromodules.
3) Controlled thermal resistance due to the ﬂexibility in the design of
micromodules – height of pellets. This allows obtaining quite low ther-
mal resistance for heat ﬂux sensors used in soil, for example. A sensor
used in microcalorimetry and so on can have high thermal resistance, thus
signiﬁcantly increasing sensor sensitivity.
4) Fast response.

As follows from the data on sensitivity, the heat ﬂux sensors of the experimental
series are signiﬁcantly superior to most sensors currently in use. Moreover, the
technology allows manufacturing sensors of more high performance (the dashed
curve on the graphs).
The heat ﬂux sensors based on the principle of additional wall should have low
thermal resistance so as not to distort the measured heat ﬂux.
The sensors have thermal resistance at the level of values used in practice (other
manufacturers).

Examples of Applications
11.11.1
Microcalorimetry: Evaporation of Water Drop
A classic example of the use of a heat ﬂux sensor is the study of water evaporation.
In Figure 11.25, the experimental setup is illustrated.
A drop of water is placed directly on the sensitive surface of the heat ﬂux sen-
sor – model HTD04-126-05D20 (Table 11.11).
When water evaporates, there is a process of heat absorption. The evaporation
heat is 2256 J/g. Heat is absorbed both from the base surface and the environ-
ment. We can assume the relationship between the heat ﬂuxes from the base and
from the environment as 50 : 50.

The sensor can measure the heat ﬂux absorbed from the base and the average
temperature by the integrated thermistor.
Figure 11.26 shows the results of the experiment.
Since the heat of evaporation of water is known, from the heat ﬂux (the total
absorbed energy) and the assumption of 50 : 50 we can obtain the dynamics of
the evaporation of the drop mass and its total weight. Figure 11.27 shows the
corresponding experimental data.
It is interesting that the evaporation rate is approximately constant throughout
the cycle.
The experimental results give an estimate of the drop volume of about 0.032 ml,
which is consistent with the known data. These results indirectly conﬁrm a good
calibration of the heat ﬂux sensor.
11.11.2
Measurement of Heat Fluxes in Soil
Figure 11.28 depicts a model of the measurement of heat ﬂux in the soil. Two
heat ﬂux sensors are placed in the soil at diﬀerent depths. The heat source is an
incandescent lamp – imitates sunlight. The intensity of the heat ﬂux is varied by
changing the amount of radiation from the heat source.
Figure 11.29 shows the corresponding experimental data.
This application of thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensors is very helpful for purposes
of agricultural working, particularly during periods of season transformations.
11.11.3
Thermoelectric Ice Sensor
Ice sensor is an important type of sensor. It has various applications [21–24]. Ice
sensors are intended for deﬁnition of characteristics of freezing (formation of ice)
for the purpose of timely notiﬁcation, eﬀective use of anti-icing systems, safety
on transport, in industrial applications, and in life.
The main objectives of the ice sensor are measurement of temperature of freez-
ing; determination of intensity of ice formation; deﬁnition of proximity of condi-
tions for formation of ice.

Various physical principles in modern ice sensors [24], however in most cases
that is indirect measurement of ice formation, with an insuﬃcient accuracy. It is

11 Thermoelectric Modules as Eﬃcient Heat Flux Sensors
The advantage of use of heat ﬂux sensors in this application is the principle
of direct measurements – namely, deﬁnition of freezing by enthalpy of the ice
crystallization that is released or absorbed during the water-to-ice phase trans-
formation.
It allows deﬁning freezing parameters with high precision, to predict ice for-
mation conditions.
One of the models of such ice sensors is given in Figure 11.30 and in
Figure 11.31 – schematic of the ice sensor. The ice sensor consists of Peltier
module and the thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensor. The thermistor is mounted on a
sensitive surface of the heat ﬂux sensor for exact determination of temperature.
The principle of operation of such an ice sensor is shown in Figures 11.32–11.34.

Figure 11.33 Cooling mode: (a) thermistor signal; (b) heat ﬂux sensor signal.
The cycle of cooling or heating is provided by the Peltier module.
If on the outer surface of the heat ﬂux sensor the water is presented, then when
crossing the temperature of formation of ice, the heat ﬂux sensor will record the
heat of water crystallization released or absorbed during water-to-ice phase tran-
sition. The integrated thermistor will deﬁne the freezing temperature.
The size of a signal measured by the heat ﬂux sensor and the corresponding
integrated heat measured by it allow to measure the amount of ice or water
directly.
Experimental data are presented in Figure 11.35. It is a cycle of cooling/heating
of the experimental thermoelectric ice sensor. Using the freezing temperature
of the ice sensor, the amount of the released or absorbed heat is measured. This
amount of heat signals about the intensity of ice formation, and allows calculating
quantitatively the ice formation.

Such thermoelectric ice sensor possesses unique informational content in a tiny
design, high precision of deﬁnition. Owing to the simple miniature design it can
be mass produced, providing a range of applications at reasonable prices.
As a ﬁnal comment on such ice sensors it should be noted that such a sensor is
a unique device. All its components work on the principles of thermoelectricity:
the Peltier module – eﬀect of Peltier; the thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensor, and even
a thermistor – Seebeck eﬀect (look at the Table 11.2).

Laser Power Meters
Modern life is not imaginable without the universal use of lasers any more. Lasers
transfer optical energy and power. Measurement of these parameters is of priority
in all areas of applications: optical communication and data recording; industrial
applications, in materials processing; in scientiﬁc researches, and so on.

Laser power meter is a device for the measurement of power or energy of
the laser beam. Diﬀerent technologies are applied in the state-of-the-art power
meters (Table 11.19):
Every technology has advantages but for a limited range of applications.
Thermopile sensors – power meters are based on the principle that the opti-
cal (laser) power is converted to heat, and the resulting temperature rise (the
temperature diﬀerence between the absorber and the heat sink) is measured by
a thermopile. Thermopile power meters are also called thermal power meters.
Thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensors can be also related to the class.

Figure 11.36 Design of thermopile laser power meters: (a) “disk” type; (b) “wafer” type.
Moreover, there are two kinds of thermopiles used in laser power measure-
ment. One is the so-called “disk” type thermopile power meter, and the other is
the “wafer” type thermopile sensor (Figure 11.36).
The disk-type is made of two sets of junctions laid out radially (Figure 11.36a).
One set of junctions is arrayed under the aperture while the alternate set is near
the edge of the disk, which is attached to a massive heat sink. The laser power
heats the absorber in the center and creates a temperature diﬀerence between
the center and the edge.
In the wafer-type sensor thermopiles hot and cold junctions are located in
the same direction with laser power beam (Figure 11.36b). The top side of the
media with hot side junctions is heated by laser power. The bottom side with

cold junctions is connected with a massive heat sink. The temperature diﬀerence
measured by diﬀerential thermopiles is proportional to the power.
When a lot of average power is absorbed and has to ﬂow through the small gap
containing the thermocouples, the temperature becomes hot enough to damage
the thermocouple junctions.
The thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensor as laser power meter must be exactly clas-
siﬁed as “wafer” type thermal laser power meter (Figure 11.37).
Thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensors have a set of advantages when both types of
thermopile power meters are compared.
1) First of all, it has considerably bigger sensitivity because the pairs of p- and
n-semiconductor pellets have at least 10 times (>10×) bigger Seebeck coeﬃ-
cient (means sensitivity) than metal thermocouples (Table 11.1).

11 Thermoelectric Modules as Eﬃcient Heat Flux Sensors
2) As known, because of the small gap in the medium in the path of heat ﬂux
generated by laser power, the speed of response of the “wafer” type sensors is
faster than that of disk type sensors with radial placement of the couples. In
the case of thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensors the medium is the thermoelectric
material of the pellets itself. The height of the pellets can be very small and so
such sensors will be quite fast.
3) It was shown above that thermoelectric heat ﬂux sensors have unique perfor-
mance advantage. The integral sensitivity Sa does not depend on the number
of pellets (pellet pairs) in the sensor (11.18). In other words, in the sensor, even
one pair (or even one pellet) has the same sensitivity Sa as a complete sensor.
4) The conclusion of the above is that on the basis of thermoelectric heat ﬂux
sensor technology it is possible to create matrix power meters where a pixel
could be one pair of n- and p-pellets, or even every pellet to build special elec-
tric connection for such a matrix (Figure 11.38).

Background and Theory

Introduction
The average global electricity production in 2014 was estimated at more than
24 000 TWh, of which only a small fraction of 7% was produced from solar and
wind energy. Increasing the fraction by 1% means a reduction of CO2 emission by
roughly 1.32 × 108 tons. There is an abundant energy input from the solar radia-
tion received on earth, estimated at 162 000 TW, which means a vanishingly small
fraction of it can meet all the energy demand on earth for all human activities.
Photovoltaic (PV) technology converts solar energy directly into electricity. The
conversion eﬃciency 𝜂PV is expressed as 𝜂PV = Pout/Pin, where Pout is the electric-
ity output and Pin is the solar energy input [1, 2]. However, the solar energy input
cannot be fully utilized because of the limitations in solar spectrum absorption
and the quantum eﬃciency (QE). The solar energy that cannot be converted into
electricity is converted into waste heat. Therefore, improvement of 𝜂PV can be
achieved by utilizing the waste heat.
Thermoelectrics is a promising energy conversion technology that converts
heat directly into electricity [3–5]. The design of a thermoelectrics module
(TEG) follows the principle that the p–n junctions are electrically connected
in series and thermally connected in parallel [6]. Such a ﬂat device is capa-
ble of being combined with PV panels for energy conversion. Therefore a
photovoltaic–thermoelectric (PVTE) hybrid device becomes a promising solu-
tion for improving the overall solar to electrical conversion eﬃciency [7–11].
Figure 12.1 shows a schematic setup of a typical PVTE device. The hot side of the
TEG is thermally connected to the back electrode of the PV panel, harvesting
waste heat from it. When a temperature gradient is built vertically in the TEG,
the TEG power output will be added to the PV power output by electrically
connecting them in series.
The concept of the solar spectrum energy utilization by a PVTE module is
represented in Figure 12.2. For the speciﬁc example of the AM1.5G spectrum,
69.32% of the solar radiation is converted by the solar cell. The short wavelength

region of the power spectrum that can be used for TEG only accounts for 1.35% of
the total incident radiation power. The main contribution of the TEG comes along
with the conversion of the long wavelength fraction of 28.55%. It gives the prin-
ciples for the combination of PV and TEG modules in the most eﬃcient way [9].

12.1 Background and Theory
285
12.1.2
PV Eﬃciency
The eﬃciency of a generic PV system is simply the ratio of output power to input
power; that is,
𝜂PV = Pout
Pin
= VOCISCFF
𝜑SunScell
where V oc, Isc, FF, ΦSun, and Scell are the open circuit voltage, the short-circuit
current, the ﬁlling factor, the solar radiation intensity, and the device area, respec-
tively. And the ﬁll factor FF follows the relation FF = (V max × Imax)/(V oc × Isc),
where V max and Imax are the maximum voltage and maximum current achievable.
12.1.3
TEG Eﬃciency
The eﬃciency of a TEG depends on the materials used. The most important
material properties can be described by a dimensionless ﬁgure of merit (ZT),
ZT = TS2𝜎/𝜅, where T, S, 𝜎, and 𝜅are the absolute temperature, the Seebeck
coeﬃcient, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity, respectively [6, 13].
The maximum eﬃciency of an ideal thermoelectric device, 𝜂TEG, can be written
as a function of the temperatures and the device ﬁgure of merit, as follows:
𝜂TEG = ΔT
Th
√
1 + ZT −1
√
1 + ZT + Tc∕Th
where Th, Tc, and ΔT correspond to the hot-side temperature, cold side
temperature, and the temperature diﬀerence, respectively. ΔT/Th corresponds
to the Carnot eﬃciency, the maximum eﬃciency of a heat engine operating
between two temperatures. The term ZT is the dimensionless ﬁgure of merit,
one of the most important and popular terms in thermoelectrics. ZT is a pure
material property, regardless of the engineering design of the modules. The ZT
value is directly related to the maximum possible conversion eﬃciency 𝜂max [6].
Given the diﬀerent values for Th and Tc, 𝜂max monotonically increases with
increasing ZT and ΔT.
12.1.4
PVTE Module Generated Power and Eﬃciency
Incident solar irradiation is converted by the PV module with eﬃciency 𝜂PV. The
remaining heat ﬂux is assumed to be available to the TEG module, and is con-
verted with eﬃciency 𝜂TEG. Thus, the heat ﬂux lost at the module sides and front
cover as well as the radiation loss is not taken into account. The total amount of
generated power then is
PPVTE = PPV + PTEG = 𝜂PVG + (1 −𝜂PV)G𝜂PV
and the eﬃciency of the hybrid PVTE system is written as
𝜂PVTE = 𝜂PV + (1 −𝜂PV)𝜂TEG
12.1.5
Energy Loss
The equations described above allow for the calculation of the maximum
enhancement of eﬃciency as a result of adding a TEG. However, several losses

286
12 Photovoltaic–Thermoelectric Hybrid Energy Conversion
are not considered, according to Sark et al. [10], such as reﬂection losses, heat
ﬂux, and radiation losses from the side and front cover. Further, it is assumed
that the back side temperature of the TE converter always equals the ambient
temperature. This is a critical assumption, and may not be realized in practice.
Clearly, a higher back side temperature lowers the TEG eﬃciency.
Lorenzi et al. had a detailed investigation on the energy losses in single-junction
devices [12]. According to their analysis, the maximum eﬃciency 𝜂c achievable by
a solar cell is equal to the Carnot eﬃciency, that is, 𝜂c = 1 −Tcell∕Tsun, where Tcell
is the device (cold side) temperature and TSun is the Sun temperature. According
to Landsberg, this formula should be modiﬁed taking into account the non-zero
radiation emitted by the absorber:
𝜂max = Pmax
Pin
= 1 −3
4
(Tcell
Tsun
)
+)1
3
(Tcell
Tsun
)4
Taking Tcell = 300 K and TSun = 6000 K one obtains an eﬃciency of 93.33%.
However, Shockley and Queisser showed how, in a single-junction device, the
actual achievable eﬃciency is bound to be much lower, because of several types
of energy loss, as shown in Table 12.1.
Sark pointed out that the largest contribution to the overall loss comes from the
L2 term, which corresponds to ≈60% of the overall incoming power, and the other
three terms total less than 20%. The detailed expressions of L2, containing loss as a
result of non-absorbed photons L2a, thermalization of hot carriers L2b, and degra-
dation as a result of cell heating L2c, were shown in his paper [12]. Figure 12.3
shows the histograms of the contribution of L2 for diﬀerent PV technology.
12.1.6
Cost
The high cost of TEG is a major concern for limiting widespread use of PVTE
modules. According to an estimation [12], the price for generating electricity
using a TEG is dependent on the size of the modules, for example, 5 to 10 $/W
for 50 × 50 mm2 modules of 0.3–0.5 W/cm2. For a 15% eﬃciency PV module, if

adding a TEG leads to 10% increase in power, thus a 165 W/m2 PVTE module,
the extra cost can be as high as 150 $. However, for large size and large quantities
prices may easily be halved. As higher eﬃciency TEGs are developed, the present
high prices should come down with increased amounts of units produced, follow-
ing experience curve theory, for example, [14].

Overall Feasibility
Lorenzi et al. investigated the conditions for beneﬁcial coupling of TEG and
PV devices [15]. Their quantitative model correlated the eﬃciency of the PVTE
with the energy gap and the working temperature of the solar cell. The results
showed that one should not only recover the heat released by relaxation of hot
electron–hole pairs but also capture the low-energy part of the solar spectrum.
Figure 12.4 shows two schematics of the device structures discussed in this work.
The PVTE eﬃciency of the two PVTE devices are shown in Figure 12.5 as a
function of energy band gap Eg and cell temperature Tcell. A detailed calculation
process was described in the paper [15].
The feasibility of the PVTE hybrid module was also investigated by Sark et al.
[10]. He proposed to use the thermal waste from PV by attaching TEG to the back
of the PV modules to form a PVTE hybrid module. Because of the temperature
diﬀerence over the TEG, additional electricity can be generated. According to his
calculation, employing present day thermoelectric materials with a typical ﬁgure
of merit (ZT) of 1.2 at 300 K may lead to an eﬃciency enhancement of up to
23% for roof integrated PVTE modules. The annual energy yield would increase
by 14.7–11%, for two annual irradiance and temperature proﬁles studied, that
is, for Malaga, Spain, and Utrecht, the Netherlands, respectively. The generated
energy for a 10-day period in August for the city of Malaga, Spain, is shown in
Figure 12.6 [10].
In order to estimate the performances of diﬀerent PVTE modules, Zhang et al.
[16] developed a theoretical model for evaluating the eﬃciency of concentrating
PVTE hybrid systems, as shown in Figure 12.7a. The total eﬃciency can be
calculated as 𝜂PVTE = 𝜂PV + (1 −𝜂PV)𝜂TEG −Pcs∕Ps, in which Ps is the PVTE

PVs including crystalline silicon PV cell, silicon thin-ﬁlm PV cell, polymer PV
cell, and copper indium gallium selenide PV cell were considered as the PV
part of the hybrid device, and their conﬁgurations used in the simulations are
shown in Figure 12.7b–e. According to their calculated results, it was shown that
the inﬂuence of temperature on the eﬃciency of PV cells was a crucial factor.
In Figure 12.7f–i, the inﬂuence of temperature on the eﬃciency of diﬀerent

Among them, polymer PV has the best temperature stability at an elevated
temperature compared to other PV technologies. It was also demonstrated by
their simulations that the polycrystalline silicon thin-ﬁlm PV cell is suitable for
concentrating PVTE hybrid systems, whereas the polymer PV cell was more
suitable for non-concentrating PVTE hybrid systems, as shown in their results
in Figure 12.7j–m.

Diﬀerent Forms of PVTE Hybrid Systems: The State
of the Art
12.2.1
PVTE Hybrid Systems Based on Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC)
Wang et al. ﬁrst proposed a PVTE hybrid system based on dye-sensitized solar
cell (DSSC) and the micro TEG based on bismuth telluride [7]. Figure 12.8
presents a schematic illustration and photograph of the novel PVTE hybrid
device. A DSSC and a TE generator are the top cell and “bottom cell,” respec-
tively, while an solar selective absorber (SSA) is placed in between the DSSC
and the TE generator. The electric connection of the DSSC and TE generator
are in series, and the cathode and anode of the hybrid device are the cathode
of the DSSC and the anode of the TE generator, respectively. According to the
transmittance spectrum of the glass sheet coated with ﬂuorine-doped tin oxide
(FTO) and the DSSC cell shown in Figure 12.9a, the DSSC absorbs part of the
sunlight, which is converted into electricity.
A relatively high transmittance from a wavelength of 600–1600 nm can be
observed from the spectrum, which suggests that this part of the illumination
energy is not utilized by the DSSC cell. On the other hand, it is shown in
Figure 12.9b that the SSA has a markedly low reﬂectance in the wavelength
range from 600 to 1600 nm. This means the transmitted sunlight through a
DSSC can be well absorbed by the SSA. Then the SSA converts the residual
sunlight transmitted through a DSSC into heat energy. This heat is further
converted into electricity by the TE generator using the Seebeck eﬀect. The
hybrid device as a whole can absorb a wide wavelength range of incident
sunlight, and hence, should lead to higher energy conversion eﬃciency. The
overall conversion eﬃciency of 13.8% was achieved using such a system. The
power density generated from the PVTE system was about 12.8 mW/cm2 when
the temperature diﬀerence was around 6 ∘C. However, it was expected that the
device performance might increase with further optimization [7].

12.2.2
Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell with Built-in Nanoscale Bi2Te3 TEG
Chen et al. proposed a new DSSC based on a thermoelectric Bi2Te3/TiO2 com-
posite anode, in which the incorporated Bi2Te3 nanoplates functioned as built-in
nanoscale electron generators to convert “waste heat” into electricity and as a
good photoreaction catalyst to enhance the charge transfer rate, resulting in 28%
improvement of the overall power conversion eﬃciency [17]. The structure and
mechanism for the built-in PVTE cell was demonstrated in Figure 12.10.
12.2.3
PVTE Using Solar Concentrator
PVTEs using concentrated solar energy are also of much interest because of
the higher conversion eﬃciency and potentially lower cost. Da et al. proposed
a comprehensive photon and thermal management approach to increase the
full-spectrum solar energy utilization in PVTE hybrid systems [18]. According
to their unique design, the spectrum control strategy is considered to suppress
the reﬂection of full solar spectrum photons and enhance the transmission of
photons with energy below the band gap of the PV cell from the top-located cell
to the TE module in a PVTE hybrid system in order to realize reasonable uti-
lization of the solar spectrum energy. The bioinspired moth-eye nanostructured
surface and enhanced transmission ﬁlm have been incorporated together to
achieve such photon management in their study. The results have revealed that

12.2 Diﬀerent Forms of PVTE Hybrid Systems: The State of the Art

the reﬂection loss decreases signiﬁcantly because of the moth-eye structured
surface while the transmission is improved with enhanced transmission ﬁlm.
The performance of the PVTE hybrid systems was evaluated under both AM1.5
and AM0 illumination conditions for both terrestrial and space applications.
Water cooling and radiative cooling were selected as thermal management
methods for terrestrial and space applications, respectively. According to their
results, it was found that the conversion eﬃciency of the PVTE hybrid system
is higher than that of a single PV cell under the same conditions without any
optical concentration. If a solar concentrator was used, although the overall
eﬃciency of the PVTE hybrid system may decrease with the increment in the
optical concentration ratio, the system could produce more total power output
for both terrestrial and space applications (Figure 12.11). This work has provided
instructive guides for designing PVTE hybrid systems working in both terrestrial
and space environments [18].
Another hybrid PVTE system for concentrated solar energy conversion was
proposed by Beeri et al. [19]. In their work, a hybrid PVTE demonstrator based
on CMJ architecture was experimentally and theoretically investigated. Using
commercially available MJ PV cell and TEG, their hybrid system’s eﬃciency
reached ∼32%. The direct electrical contribution of the TEG to the hybrid
system’s eﬃciency was enhanced by increasing the sun’s concentration and
temperature, reaching a maximal value of almost 20% for a sun concentration of
∼300. According to their estimations, even higher eﬃciency and power values
were expected when using more advanced PV cells and TE materials, with a real
potential to exceed 50% total eﬃciency. They also evaluated the contribution of
the Peltier cooling eﬀect to the hybrid system’s eﬃciency using ﬁnite element
simulation of the TEG. Including this cooling eﬀect, the total contribution of
the TEG to the hybrid system’s eﬃciency reached a value of almost 40% at a sun
concentration level of 200. In their cooling eﬀect analysis, a simple procedure
was proposed for combining FEM and experimental approaches for estimation
of the system’s heat losses (∼33% in the currently investigated conditions) by

heat ﬂow measurements [19] (Figure 12.12).
12.2.4
Solar–Thermoelectric Device Based on Bi2Te3 and Carbon Nanotube
Composites
Another concept of utilizing solar energy is to ﬁrst convert solar energy to
heat and then use TE to convert such heat into electricity. Xia et al. proposed
a solar–thermoelectric device based on this method. They utilized CNTs
as solar energy absorber and heat convertor [20]. Figure 12.13c shows the
schematics of their device. They investigated the solar thermoelectric properties
of B2Te3/CNT composites, which combined the solar–heat conversion advan-
tage of CNT sheets and the thermoelectric power generation advantage of
bismuth telluride. The higher light absorption up to 95% was attributed to
the crossover-lapped structure feature of the CNT sheets in their study. The
solar–thermoelectric conversion eﬃciency of the composite reaches up to
1% in natural sunlight without the aid of any kind of optical concentrator or
thermal concentrator. According to their estimations, if an optical concentrator
or thermal concentrator were applied, a much higher solar energy conversion
eﬃciency of above 10% could be expected by further optimization. The scanning
electron microscopy (aSEM) image CNT ﬁlms, the SEM image of the CNT ﬁlms
coated with Bi2Te3 at a thickness of 5 μm, and an illustration of the device are

Optimizations of PVTE Hybrid Systems
12.3.1
Geometry Optimization of Thermoelectric Devices in a Hybrid
PVTE System
Finding an optimized geometry for PVTE hybrid systems is a meaningful
engineering work because it could result in the best eﬃciency out of the lowest
possible cost. Hashim et al. investigated the optimal geometry for obtaining
maximum power output and conversion eﬃciency of a thermoelectric generator
(TEG) of hybrid PVTE system using a model developed in his work [2]. The
overall power output Pout and conversion eﬃciency 𝜂c of a hybrid PVTE system
were estimated in their work. The results of their simulation showed that an
increase in both the overall power output and the conversion eﬃciency may
be achieved by incorporating a TEG to harvest waste heat from a PV cell.
Their results also demonstrated that in practice an optimized geometry had
to be a “trade-oﬀ” between achieving a large power output and using minimal

thermoelectric material, which means that a thermoelectric module (TEM) that
has a smaller cross-sectional area than that of the PV cell can generate more
electrical power than those having a larger cross-sectional area. Another ﬁnding
in their study is that a signiﬁcant increase in the power output could be obtained
if the system operates in vacuum. In an ideal case where the convective heat
losses are completely eliminated, the power output could be almost doubled.
Some of their calculation results are shown in Figure 12.14.
12.3.2
Enhancing the Overall Heat Conduction and Light Absorption
Another strategy of increasing the overall conversion eﬃciency of a PVTE
system is to enhance the heat conduction between PV and TE parts, as well as
increasing the light absorption for PVTEs. Chang et al. proposed a method that
increased the PVTE conversion eﬃciency by adding a CuO layer between the
PV and TE parts [21]. They used electrophoresis deposition and self-prepared
CuO nanoﬂuid to deposit a CuO thin-ﬁlm coating onto a Cu plate and then
adhered it to the surface of a TEG. Experimental results showed that the CuO
thin ﬁlm coating on the TEG surface could enhance the overall heat conduction
and elevate the temperature by around 2 ∘C and therefore increase the voltage
by around 14.8%, thus enhancing the thermoelectric conversion eﬃciency of
the TEG by 10% and increasing the overall power output by 2.35%. It was found
that this solar-TEM could generate about 4.95 mW/cm2 under a solar radiation
intensity of about 100 mW/cm2 according to their results (Figure 12.15).

Fishnet Meta-Structure for IR Band Trapping for Enhancement
of PVTE Hybrid Systems
Since the TE part of the hybrid system mainly utilizes the IR band of the solar
energy, ﬁnding a way to improve the IR band trapping can therefore enhance the
overall conversion eﬃciency for PVTE hybrid systems. Oh et al. proposed the

embedment of a Ag ﬁshnet meta-structure for a PVTE hybrid system to produce
more electrical power of a TEG by absorbing more solar thermal energy [22].
The schematics of the thin-ﬁlm solar cell of the hybrid system with the ﬁshnet
embedded in the back passivation layer are shown in Figure 12.16. The hybrid
system consists of a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin-ﬁlm solar cell
as a top cell and a TEG as a bottom cell. As shown in Figure 12.16, the planar ﬁsh-
net structure is embedded in a back passivation layer of the solar cell to enhance
solar thermal absorption near the infrared band of the solar spectrum. The main
concept of this design was to conduct the absorbed thermal energy by the ﬁshnet
to the TEG, which could increase the temperature diﬀerence between the hot and
cold sides of the TE generator. In their work, the ﬁshnet structure was optimized
through parametric simulation in terms of pitch, width, and thickness. The solar
power spectrum was modeled by using the power spectral density of blackbody
radiation to calculate the total solar thermal energy of the hybrid system. Their
results showed that the hybrid system with the optimized ﬁshnet structure could
absorb more solar thermal energy than the system without ﬁshnet by around 12
folds [22].
12.3.4
Full-Spectrum Photon Management of Solar Cell Structures for PVTE
Hybrid Systems
Xu et al. proposed an ultra-broadband photon management structure for
crystalline silicon thin-ﬁlm solar cells used in the PVTE hybrid system [23].
The signiﬁcance of this structure was the ability to absorb 300–1100 nm solar
spectrum and transmit 1100–2500 nm inferred energy, and this was realized
by the nanostructures designed by them. According to their explanation, the
smooth graded eﬀective refractive index of the composite surface structure of
moth-eye and inverted-parabolic can improve absorption in the shorter wave-
length (300–700 nm), while absorption enhancement in the longer wavelength

(700–1100 nm) could be achieved by employing plasmonic back reﬂector and
metallic gratings on the back side, which resulted in eﬃcient light-trapping
via broad angular scattering and microcavity mode, respectively. They were
optimistic that this method of photon management in full spectrum could also
be a guidance for many other types of thin-ﬁlm PV devices used in the hybrid
system (Figure 12.17).
12.3.5
An Automotive PVTE Hybrid Energy System Using Maximum Power
Point Tracking
As one of the most important power management technologies for solar cells
systems, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) plays an equally important
role in PVTE hybrid systems. Zhang et al. proposed a new automotive TEPV
hybrid energy system. Based on the proposed MPPT, both the TEG and PV
branches could achieve maximum power transfer independently [24]. In their
work, a 100 W prototype was built and tested. Their results successfully veriﬁed
the validity of the proposed system. By scaling up the power ratings propor-
tionally up to 1 kW, the proposed system showed promise for diﬀerent types
of automobiles. Figure 12.18 gives a comparison of the advances in using the
MPPT control by comparing the power output to the ﬁxed duty cycle system.
According to their result, the power improvement is from 7.5% to 9.4% due to
the use of the MPPT when varying the hot-side temperature of the TE part of the
hybrid system. Secondly, when the irradiance varied, as shown in Figure 12.18b,
the power improvement was from 4.8% to 17.9% resulting from the use of the
MPPT. Thus, their MPPT system successfully improved the overall output power
of the hybrid energy system.

12.4
Application of PVTE Hybrid Systems
PVTE hybrid systems are based on the conventional solar cells and TEMs, where
both light and heat are utilized, thereby increasing the total energy eﬃciency. As
a result, the PVTE hybrid systems can be used in household roof panels, district
heating by solar energy, and so on. Since the TEM can also be used as a Peltier
cooler, the hybrid systems can also be used as solar-driven cooling modules, or
by cooling the PV panel itself, which can result in the increase of photon electron
conversion eﬃciencies in hot sites.

12.4 Application of PVTE Hybrid Systems
303
12.4.1
Novel Hybrid Solar System for Photovoltaic, Thermoelectric,
and Heat Utilization
A novel hybrid solar system was designed by Yang et al. to utilize PV cells, ther-
moelectric (TE) modules, and hot water (HW) through a multilayered building
envelope [8]. A schematic illustration of the hybrid solar panel was shown in
Figure 12.19. According to their design, hybrid solar panels integrated with
Si solar cells, TE materials, and FGM water tube systems were demonstrated;
water pipelines were cast within a functionally graded material layer to serve as
a heat sink, allowing heat to be easily transferred into ﬂowing water through an
aluminum-rich surface, while remaining insulated by a polymer-rich bottom.
Their results showed that compared to the traditional solar panel, this design
could achieve better overall eﬃciencies with higher electrical power output and
thermal energy utilization. Based on theoretical conversion eﬃciency limits, the
PV/TE/HW system was superior to PV/HW and traditional PV systems with
30% higher output electrical power according to their results. However, the
advantages of the PV/TE/HW system were not signiﬁcant from experimental
data because of the low eﬃciency of the bulk TE material. This design was
general and open to new PV and TE materials with emerging nanotechnology
for higher eﬃciencies.
12.4.2
Development of an Energy-Saving Module via Combination of PV
Cells and TE Coolers for Green Building Applications
A solar-driven thermoelectric cooling module with a waste heat regeneration
unit designed for green building applications was investigated by Cheng et al.
[25]. In their work, the waste heat regeneration unit consisting of two parallel cop-
per plates and a water channel with staggered ﬁns was installed between the solar
cells and the thermoelectric cooler. The useless solar energy from the solar cells
and the heat dissipated from the thermoelectric cooler could both be removed
by the cooling water such that the performance of the cooling module is ele-
vated. Moreover, it made engineering sense to take advantage of the hot water
produced by the waste heat regeneration unit during the daytime. Experiments
were conducted by them to investigate the cooling eﬃciency of the module. Their
results showed that the performance of the combined module was increased by
increasing the ﬂow rate of the cooling water ﬂowing into the heat regeneration
water channel due to the reductions of the solar cell temperature and the hot-side
temperature of the thermoelectric coolers. The combined module was tested in
the applications in a model house. It was found that the present approach is able
to produce a 16.2 ∘C temperature diﬀerence between the ambient temperature
and the air temperature in the model house. Figure 12.20 shows the schematic
diagram of their designed experimental system.

temperature. For hot sites such as Madinah, the day time temperature is between
40 ∘C and 50 ∘C during the summer months. The cell temperature can reach a
temperature as high as 83 ∘C. This aﬀects the behavior of solar cells (SC) and
decreases their eﬃciency. So cooling the solar cells is needed for its optimum
performance. In order to address this issue, a hybrid PVTE system was proposed
for PV applications in hot sites by Benghanem et al. [26]. The performance of
solar cells was presented in this work using a TEM as cooling system. According
to their study, the maximum cell temperature without cooling was 83 ∘C, and the
cell temperature can be cooled down by 18 ∘C, therefore the system can be oper-
ated at 65 ∘C for solar cell temperature without loss of PV output. By operating
the solar cell at lower temperature, more power can be drawn from it for the same
solar irradiance, and longer life of solar cell is expected. On the other hand, the
hybrid PVTE system proposed for PV applications in hot sites gives good per-
formance while the additional cost is about 6% of the total cost of classical PV
systems. Figure 12.21 shows the schematics of the solar cell cooling system using
a TE cell.

Summary
The current PVTE hybrid systems are mostly based on the DSSC, a-Si solar
cells for the PV part and BiTe modules for the TE part. Such combinations

are based on the absorption spectrums of the solar cells and the optimized
working temperature of the TE module. At present, BiTe modules show the best
conversion eﬃciency at near room temperature region. As for concentrated
PVTE applications, TE materials with higher working temperature must be
used, such as PbTe.
The optimization methods of PVTE hybrid systems include optimization of
geometry of the device, improving the thermal contact between the PV and TE
parts, improving the IR absorption, and the full-spectrum management of the
incoming solar energy. Nevertheless, improving the individual eﬃciencies of the
PV and TE modules is as well beneﬁcial to the hybrid system.
PVTE hybrid systems have various applications just like its precedent solar
panels. Because the hybrid systems not only utilize the light but also utilize the
heat, such a system can be used in household roof panels, district heating by
solar energy, energy supply for buildings, and so on. At the same time, the TEM
can be used as a Peltier cooler; therefore the hybrid systems can also be used as
solar-driven cooling modules, or by cooling the PV panel itself, which can result
