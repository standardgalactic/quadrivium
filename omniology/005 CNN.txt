(CNN) — A university janitor who turned off a freezer after hearing multiple “annoying
alarms,” ruined more than 20 years of research, according to a lawsuit filed against his
employer by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in upstate New York.

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, has filed a lawsuit against the employer of a janitor who it says turned off a
lab freezer containing research materials.

The janitor, who is not being sued in the lawsuit, was a contractor with Daigle Cleaning
Systems Inc., who worked for several months in 2020 at the private research university in
Troy, New York.
The school is seeking more than $1 million in damages and legal fees from Daigle Cleaning
Systems as a result of the incident.
The lab’s freezer contained over 20 years of research, including cell cultures and samples,
to which a “small temperature fluctuation of three degrees would cause catastrophic
damage,” according to the lawsuit filed with the Rensselaer County Supreme Court.
The college does not believe the janitor is at fault but instead blames Daigle Cleaning
Systems for failing to properly train and supervise him, according to the suit.
“Defendant, by and through its negligent, careless, and/or reckless supervision and control
of [the janitor], caused damage to certain cell cultures, samples, and/or research in the
Lab,” the university claims.
CNN reached out to attorneys for Daigle Cleaning Systems and the Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute for comment.
The lawsuit states that cell cultures and specimens in the freezer needed to be maintained
at -80 degrees Celsius and a small fluctuation of 3 degrees would cause damage, so
alarms would sound if the temperature increased to -78 degrees or decreased to -82
degrees.
K.V. Lakshmi, a professor and director of the school’s Baruch ’60 Center for Biochemical
Solar Energy Research who oversaw the research, noticed the freezer alert went off on or
around September 14, 2020, because its temperature had risen to -78 degrees, according
to the suit.
Despite the alarm, Lakshmi and her team determined that the cell samples would be safe
until emergency repairs could be done, the suit said. While Lakshmi waited for the
freezer’s manufacturer to come perform repairs, her team added a safety lock box around
the freezer’s outlet and socket. A warning was posted on the freezer, according to the
court filing.

“THIS FREEZER IS BEEPING AS IT IS UNDER REPAIR. PLEASE DO NOT MOVE OR UNPLUG
IT. NO CLEANING REQUIRED IN THIS AREA. YOU CAN PRESS THE ALARM/TEST MUTE
BUTTON FOR 5-10 SECONDS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MUTE THE SOUND,” the warning
read, according to the suit.
But, on September 17, the janitor heard what he later called “annoying alarms,” according
to the suit. In apparent attempt to be helpful, he flipped the circuit breakers, which
provided electricity to the freezer, mistakenly turning them from “on” to “off,” according to
the lawsuit. It said the freezer’s temperature rose to -32 degrees Celsius.
The next day, research students found the freezer switched off and despite attempts to
preserve the research, a majority of the cultures were “compromised, destroyed, and
rendered unsalvageable demolishing more than twenty years of research,” the lawsuit
states.
