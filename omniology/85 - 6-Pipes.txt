Pipes  
 
 
A pipe is used by the shell to connect the stdout of one command directly to the stdin of another 
command.  
 
The symbol for a pipe is the vertical bar ( | ). The command syntax is:  
  
     command1 [arguments]  |  command2 [arguments] 
      
 
Pipes accomplish with one command what otherwise would take intermediate files and multiple 
commands. For example, operation 1 and operation 2 are equivalent:  
  
Operation 1 
     who > temp 
     sort temp 
 
Operation 2 
     who | sort 
      
 
Pipes do not affect the contents of the input files.  
 
Two very common uses of a pipe are with the "more" and "grep" utilities. Some examples:  
  
     ls -al | more 
     who | more 
     ps ug | grep myuserid 
     who | grep  kelly
