Introduction
W
hether you work for a corporation, a nonprofit organization, or for 
the government, chances are you’ve considered getting — or have
already obtained — a Masters of Business Administration degree, an MBA.
Why? Because if you want to get ahead in your organization — or just to do 
a better job of managing or leading — obtaining an MBA is the best ticket in
town. Studies show that MBA graduates — particularly those from the top
business schools — are offered significantly higher starting salaries than their
counterparts who don’t have MBAs. And that effect carries on throughout the
careers of these MBAs.
But is it the degree that makes the difference, or is something else at 
work here? Although that piece of paper with your name and the words
“Masters of Business Administration” would mean a lot, what is even more
important are the things you’d learn during the course of your MBA studies.
Complete MBA For Dummies, 2nd Edition, presents and explains some of the
same information that you’d encounter in a typical MBA program in any high-
quality business school. Strategic planning, management, accounting,
finance, marketing, negotiation — you’ll find the key points here.
As you browse this book, keep one thing in mind: There isn’t a monopoly of
business skill and talent at the top levels of an organization. Indeed, employees
at all levels can (and today are often expected to) play active roles in running
their organizations. You can find engaged businesspeople in every part of
today’s dynamic organization.
The bottom line: This book provides you with the very best ideas, concepts,
and tools taught in today’s top business schools. If you apply them, we’re sure
that you’ll see a noticeable difference in your everyday business dealings — a
difference that will make you and your business partners even more successful
in the future.
About This Book
Complete MBA For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is full of useful information, tips,
and checklists that will help anyone who aspires to lead, manage, or 
participate in a business at a high level of competence. Your current level 
of leadership and management experience doesn’t matter. For a fraction of

the amount you’d pay to get your MBA, we provide you with an easily 
understandable roadmap to navigate today’s most innovative and effective 
business techniques and strategies. And if you already have your MBA, you’ll
find that this book is a handy refresher and reference guide that you can
carry with you wherever you go.
More good news is that the information you find within the covers of this
book is firmly grounded in the real world. It isn’t an abstract collection of 
theoretical mumbo-jumbo that sounds good but doesn’t work when you put
it to the test. No, we’ve culled the best information, the best strategies, and
the best techniques — the same ones that professors teach in today’s top
business schools. In short, this book is a toolbox full of solutions to your
every business question and problem.
And this book is fun (at least we think so!). Running a business doesn’t have
to be a bore. In fact, it can be a lot of fun. We help you to maintain a sense of
humor in the face of the challenges that all businesspeople face from time to
time. We’re happy to say, though, that there will be many more days when the
satisfaction of inspiring a team to develop an innovative new product or ser-
vice, or hitting a new sales record, will bring you a greater sense of fulfillment
than you ever imagined.
Finally, this book will inspire you with stories from some of today’s most
innovative and successful businesses — including Amazon.com, Whole Foods
Market, MySpace, General Electric Medical Systems, and many more. 
Conventions Used in This Book
When writing this book, we included some general conventions that all 
For Dummies books use. We use the following:
 Italics: We italicize any words you may not be familiar with and provide
definitions.
 Boldface type: We bold all keywords in bulleted lists and the actual
steps in numbered lists.
 Monofont: All Web sites and e-mail addresses appear in monofont.
What You’re Not to Read
Ideally we want you to read every single word that we’ve written, but we’re
also realists. We know that you’re very busy and only have time to read just
what you need. In that case feel free to skip the sidebars — the shaded text
2
Complete MBA For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

boxes full of anecdotes and examples. Although they’re interesting reads, 
if you do skip them you won’t miss anything essential.
Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we made the following assumptions about you, 
our readers. We assumed that
 You’re interested in taking a big step beyond merely going to work —
that you really want to learn what business is all about.
 You’re willing to change the way you interact with your coworkers and
customers, and that you’re ready to try some new techniques that will
put you ahead of the competition. 
 You’re able to make a long-term commitment to becoming a better 
businessperson.
 You’re considering whether an MBA program is right for you and 
you’re looking at this book to help you make the decision.
How This Book Is Organized
Complete MBA For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is organized into six parts. Each
part addresses a major area of the hows, whats, and whys of becoming a
leader. Because of this organization, it’s simple to find the topic that you’re
looking for. Whatever the topic, you can bet that we cover it someplace!
Here’s a quick overview of what you can find in each part.
Part I: The New, Improved 
World of Business
Business today is changing at a record pace, and the best and most effective
businesspeople are changing with it. In this part, we consider what business
looks like today, and we take a very close look at the forces that have come
together to flatten the world. Entrepreneurship seems to be on everyone’s
mind today and the tales of successful (and not so successful) entrepreneurs
are in the daily news. We give you a good grounding in entrepreneurship con-
cepts that can help you no matter what your career is. We also consider the
global business environment and discuss the hows and whys of strategic
planning.

Introduction

Part II: Managing a Business 
in the New World
A working knowledge of the nuts and bolts of how to manage an organization
and the people within it is still a very important part of business success. In
this part, we outline the difference between managing and leading an organi-
zation, and we discuss the latest trends in leadership. We look at how to best
motivate and reward employees and how to recruit and retain only the very
best people. We also examine one of the most important tools in business
today: employee teams.
Part III: Money: What You 
Don’t Know Will Hurt You
As the saying goes, money makes the world go ’round. Nowhere is this saying
more true than in business. Understanding where a business’s money comes
from — and where it goes — is important knowledge for any businessperson
to possess. In this part, we present the basics of accounting and take a look
at the most important and widely used financial statements. We decipher the
mysteries of financial analysis and help you understand the ins and outs of
stocks and bonds. Finally, we cover what it actually takes to make money.
Part IV: Marketing in the New World
A business with no customers is not a business. Customers are the focus 
of every successful business, so finding new ways to grab their attention and
build long-term relationships is a topic of great importance. In this part, we
explore how to understand your customers’ needs and how to provide world-
class customer service. We discuss the best approaches to developing a mar-
keting plan, and we take an in-depth look at advertising and promotion —
particularly the world of new media brought about by the Internet and the
tools that let users become marketers.
Part V: Other Important Stuff
One of the most interesting things about leading, managing, or working in 
a business is that every day brings something new to learn or do. In this 
part, we take a look at a variety of important business topics. We discuss
manufacturing, distribution, and service — and how the latest technology
has had a major impact on each. We explore the most important concepts 
of risk management. We reveal the secrets of successful negotiation, and we
review everyone’s favorite business topic: economics.
4
Complete MBA For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part VI: The Part of Tens
Here, in a concise and lively set of condensed chapters, you find tips that 
will help you to quickly become an effective participant in any organization.
We show you how to avoid the most common mistakes that managers make,
the best ways to market your products and services, how to improve your
cash flow, and the best business resources out there so you can continue
your binge learning.
Icons Used in This Book
We place little pictures, called icons, next to blocks of text throughout the
book. Here’s what they mean:
This text presents good ideas, tricks, or shortcuts that can save you time 
and trouble in the business world.
This information is important enough to remember, even if you forget 
everything else!
This information can help you avoid disasters that could cost you both time
and money, not to mention your job.
Where to Go from Here
Although this book is overflowing with useful advice and information, it’s 
presented in a fun, easy-to-access format. What good is all the information in
the world if you can’t get to it quickly and easily? Have no fear; we’ve designed
this book with you, the reader, in mind. If you want to find out about a specific
area — such as recognizing and rewarding your employees or understanding
financial statements — you can check the table of contents and flip to the
proper section to get your answers quickly. 
If you’re new to business — perhaps a new employee, supervisor, or manager —
you may want to start at the beginning and work your way through to the end.
A crash course in business! A wealth of information and practical advice awaits
you. If you already have plenty of business experience under your belt and
you’re short on time (and what businessperson isn’t?), you may want to turn 
to a particular topic to address a specific need or question.

 Determining whether you need an MBA
 Eying today’s dynamic business world
 Leading the best employees
 Understanding the importance of money
 Finding and keeping customers through your marketing efforts
B
usiness owners and managers are faced with a perplexing array of 
management theories and practices and a variety of off-the-wall thoughts
on how businesses should be run. Is it any wonder why they tend to resort to
tried-and-true ways of running things? People find comfort in the familiar.
Besides, it takes time to relearn old habits, and changing the culture of a busi-
ness to deal with a fast-paced global environment is no walk in the park. If you
conduct a search for the term “management” on Amazon.com, you’ll come up
with more than 600,000 books on the subject. Add to that the 600,000+ books
on marketing and the 500,000+ books on finance, and you may be throwing up
your hands and crying “uncle!”
Although all these books claim to offer the latest and greatest in management
theory and tools, the reality is that most innovative, state-of-the-art tools are
merely elaborate makeovers or the repackaging of fundamental management
theory. A rose by any other name is still a rose. How many different ways can
you talk about change management or empowered work teams, for instance?
To be fair, however, the proponents of these “new” theories and practices 
do echo a shared truth: The world has changed dramatically, and the way
managers run businesses hasn’t always kept pace.
And if the business world has recognized the need for change, that change 
has been slow to echo in the hallowed halls of business schools, too. Even
graduate business schools at the nation’s leading universities are guilty of
adhering to old traditions. In many MBA programs, the “big business/Fortune
500” mindset still reigns — the assumption that if you’re plopped into an
established business with plenty of cash flow and assets, all you have to do 
is manage them well. Most business models presuppose a stable and pre-
dictable environment, when the reality is that most business environments
today are dynamic, fast moving, and anything but predictable.

10
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 
This chapter provides you with a brief overview of the major areas of study
in an MBA program — which just happen to be the same topics we cover in
this book. As you read through this chapter, note any topics that you want 
to explore in more detail and then drop by the table of contents to find out
where we locate the topics. Ready? Set? Go!
Do You Really Need an MBA?
For many years, people have gone back to school to get an MBA (Masters of
Business Administration) because it’s the “thing to do.” Companies want to
see the degree on your résumé, making the degree the fastest track to corpo-
rate executive positions and bigger paychecks. This has been the case for
some time, and truth be told, this is still the case. Consider the statistics 
garnered from research with recruiters worldwide:
 Demand for MBAs is rising at about 20 percent per year.
 Demand for MBA/consultants is up about 35 percent.
 Salaries are on the rise, with the average new MBA graduate starting 
at $84,500; in some areas, the salary is well over $100,000.
But money is just one reason why you may want to seek an MBA. Here are
some equally (if not more) important reasons:
 To develop skills in business functions: economics, finance, marketing,
management, operations, and accounting.
 To acquire valuable soft skills: leadership, teamwork, ethics, and 
communication.
 To develop an entrepreneurial mindset: You want to become innovative
and opportunistic to tackle the challenges of a dynamic, global world.
But what if you don’t have the time, resources, or inclination to go back to
school for two more years to get an MBA? If that describes your situation,
this book is for you. An MBA isn’t an end in itself; it’s the means to achieving
the goals you’ve set. The skills and attitudes you acquire by reading this
book enable you to develop your career (and your company) to its fullest
potential in less time and without all the resources school requires. Certainly,
putting the techniques we describe to use is better than the trial-and-error
method. In other words, the MBA lessons you take away from this book will
give you a competitive advantage over peers or other companies.

Exploring the New World of Business
Due to the nature of competition — where only the fittest companies are 
destined to survive — businesses are always pushing the envelope of creativ-
ity, innovation, and technology. They’re constantly testing new approaches,
new procedures, new processes, and new ways of doing business — looking
for a little (or large) advantage over their competitors. These are exciting
times in business, as evidenced by the following:
 The Internet has leveled the playing field for small companies. They 
can now look and act as multinational corporations and reach millions
of customers without the burden of physical assets such as plants and
equipment.
 New business models, communication technologies, and distribution
methods enable businesses to take their products and services anywhere
they want.
 Successful entrepreneurs such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffet continue
to demonstrate to the rest of the business world what it means to be
philanthropic.
 A new generation of workers — the New Millennials — are changing 
management styles and corporate culture as they force baby-boomer
bosses to consider a new definition of work ethic.
 The business world can watch in amazement as China grows at light
speed. It will become the biggest economic power in the world in the
not-too-distant future.
 Everyone with a computer and an Internet connection has access to the
same information (“Just Google it!” has become a popular search engine
phrase). Because of YouTube, for instance, everyone can have their 15
minutes of fame on the Internet.
Revolutionary changes, or paradigm shifts, aren’t the exclusive property of the
21st-century business environment. They have, in fact, occurred many times
over the centuries. Were it not for revolutionary change, societies would stag-
nate in their own traditional ways of doing things. The bottom line: Change is
a good thing. Isn’t it interesting that our grandparents and great-grandparents
lived through a similar period of dynamic change when they faced the new
century and a similar technology revolution 100 years ago? The following sec-
tions dig deeper into why change makes the business world go round. We also
discuss why you should consider making the entrepreneurial mindset a part
of the way you do business and why you should adopt a global and not just
local perspective.
11
Chapter 1: The MBA in a Nutshell

What’s so great about change?
Have you ever ridden a rollercoaster? Or bungee jumped off a tower? These
activities are exhilarating, terrifying, and glorious, all at the same time. What
makes them so great is that you don’t know what’s coming next, but you do
know that something is going to happen. So you try to prepare — perhaps
you hang on tight and close your eyes or you go for it and throw your arms
up and scream as loud as you can — before you plunge into the unknown.
What a rush! Welcome to the real (business) world.
The world is about change — often unexpected change. Change is as
unavoidable as death and taxes. You can’t put your business into a vacuum
and escape the changes — even though, as when it comes to death and taxes,
you may try to avoid them as long as you can. Instead of seeking in vain to
avoid change, though, welcome it. Savor it and use it to your advantage,
because change is a fact of life.
Smart MBA programs, recognizing that change is a fact of life, are infusing 
an entrepreneurial mindset into their curricula, because their customers —
people similar to you — demand it. In 1987, management guru Tom Peters
predicted the dynamic market that we’re experiencing today in his prophetic
book Thriving on Chaos (Harper Paperbacks). He said, “. . . excellent firms of
tomorrow will cherish impermanence — and thrive on chaos.” The reason is
that out of impermanence and chaos come opportunities that keep a busi-
ness revitalized and growing. In other words, change = opportunity = growth.
And he was right!
Making an entrepreneurial mindset 
part of your toolkit
Entrepreneurs are an important part of a healthy economy. They’re the 
catalysts for change in the business environment, and because of their oppor-
tunistic and innovative nature, they know how to take advantage of change to
bring about new business opportunities. The businesses they start are growth-
oriented and value-creating, which means that entrepreneurs serve a need in
the market that other businesses aren’t currently serving.
In other words, entrepreneurs typically develop businesses that create new
jobs (instead of stealing jobs from other companies) and have a distinct com-
petitive advantage in the market. For example, when Craig Newmark launched
his Web site Craigslist, he didn’t create the first job-posting site on the Internet.
He did, however, recognize an unmet need in the market — a simple, easy-
to-use site where anyone could post anything. Enter his site, Craigslist, which 
is now in more than 50 countries and is the most efficient job-posting and
help-wanted site on the Internet.
12
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

Here are some more of the specific things that entrepreneurs do (and that you
can do with an entrepreneurial mindset, fostered by an MBA background):
 They spot fundamental changes in the world. They then create opportu-
nities from these changes before they take hold in the general business
population.
 They create niches in the market that they can dominate. Why go
head-to-head with large, established companies in your market — unless
you have a death wish? Instead, smart business owners create niches of
customers who have needs that their larger competitors in the market
aren’t meeting.
 They put customers at the center of everything they do. Without 
customers, you have no business (see Chapter 15). So why don’t more
companies involve customers in their businesses? Businesses that
involve customers in product design and development, quality issues,
distribution — in fact, in every area of the business — are among the
most successful companies in their industries. Exemplary companies
include the following:
• 3M: a manufacturer of adhesive products
• Pelco: a manufacturer of CCTV/video surveillance systems
• Hewlett-Packard: a computer and electronics manufacturer
 They implement flatter and more team-based structures. In the busi-
ness world, hierarchies are out; teams are in. A decision-making process
that has to slug its way through layers of authority slows an organization
down, and companies that can’t respond quickly to changes in the 
marketplace are in a dangerous position.
 They form strategic partnerships with other companies in their 
industries. Companies headed by entrepreneurs with an eye toward
opportunity are forming teams with other companies — including their
competitors! Adversarial business relations have no place in a market-
place that’s too complex for any one business to handle alone. Successful
companies join forces with companies that have whatever expertise 
they need.
But what if you plan to work for a large company? Do you still need an entre-
preneurial mindset? Absolutely! Remember, the times are changing for large
companies, too. They have to find new ways to compete. Today, companies
are looking for business people who can think like entrepreneurs, so if you’re
one of them, you’ll stand out from the crowd. (Check out Chapter 3 for more
info about entrepreneurship.)
13
Chapter 1: The MBA in a Nutshell

. . . And a global perspective wouldn’t hurt
In the first edition of this book, we said that going global was a choice left up
to the business — particularly for smaller companies that may not have had
the resources to do so. Well, guess what? Things have changed, and much
faster than anyone expected. Today, going global is no longer a choice; it’s
practically a necessity for every company. Whether you have products you
want to sell in the global market or you need to find a manufacturer in China
or a software developer in Pakistan, in some way you’ll likely be dealing with
the global market in your everyday business affairs.
Dealing in a global marketplace means understanding global supply chains,
intermediaries, local culture and ways of doing business, and currency, which
can fluctuate dramatically and have a painful effect on your bottom line.
Check out Chapter 4 for more info about a global business world.
Managing and Motivating 
an Engaged Workforce
Chances are, if you’re reading this book, you’re a manager or business 
owner — or you expect to be one someday. Knowing how to effectively
manage and lead employees is a critical skill for men and women who are
tasked with running a business. Although every manager must learn to plan,
organize, lead, and exert control, a manager has plenty of other things to 
be concerned with, too, including 
 Creating an environment that engages employees and encourages their
involvement
 Tapping into the creativity of employees
 Setting an example for others
Good managers and business owners soon discover that they’re only as 
good — and their businesses are only as good — as the men and women who
work for them. This makes hiring and retaining great employees a particularly
important task, as well as firing employees who don’t work out. In addition to
covering managerial techniques, in this book we consider how to identify and
hire the best — and how to discipline and terminate the rest. 
Today, more than ever, teams are having an enormous impact on organiza-
tions — particularly empowered, self-managing teams of employees. However,
even with great teams out there doing great things for your company, a man-
ager or owner still has to help set goals, track their progress, and lend a hand
when necessary. (Check out the chapters of Part II for more info on managing
and leading.)

Picking up the environment-scanning habit
Understanding what’s going on in your industry
and in the world is critical to your business’s
success and its ability to respond quickly to the
innumerable changes it faces. The easiest
place to start is the newspaper. If you regularly
scan the pages of your local newspaper and
one of the major national newspapers, such as
The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times,
you may start to see patterns in the kinds of sto-
ries being covered. These trends usually are the
forerunners of legislation, laws, and regulations
that could affect your business.
The Internet is another great source of informa-
tion on what’s going on in your industry and the
world at large. Here are a few sites that you can
bookmark and check regularly:
 CNNMoney (money.cnn.com):The online
home of Fortune, Money, and Business 2.0,
this site covers a broad range of business
topics. You can get headlines, in-depth
reports, and business information (such as
Hoover’s Online business profiles).
 Department of Commerce(www.doc.gov):
This is a good source of links to many sites of
interest to business owners.
 IndustryLink(www.industrylink.com):
Offers links to sites about various industries.
 OneSource (www.onesource.com): The
premier source for industry information, trends,
current articles, and company information.
 Wall Street Journal Interactive (www.wsj.
com): You must pay to use this site, but the
charge may be worth it for the latest news
from around the world. This site also offers
good information about the economy and
specific companies and industries.
 SEC Edgar Database (www.sec.gov/
edgar.shtml):This is an excellent source
for researching documents that publicly
traded companies must submit to the SEC.
 BusinessWeek Online (www.business
week.com/smallbiz): This is a great site
for the latest in articles about business 
and industry.
 Inc Online (www.inc.com): If you’re inter-
ested in business from an entrepreneurial
perspective, be sure to check out the articles
on this site. It also has a huge archive of
useful materials.
If you’re one of the millions of people who are
incredibly busy with your everyday life in your
corner of the world, make some time to become
more aware of what’s going on around you. Get
out in your community and look around. Signs
and signals everywhere can tell you what’s
important to people in your area, where the
potential challenges are, and what’s on the 
horizon. The goal is to develop a more oppor-
tunistic mindset. You’ll be amazed at what you
can discover after you make scanning your
environment a habit.

company’s financial health. Budgets and bookkeeping make sure that the
company doesn’t spend more than it makes. If that excites you (and making
more than you spend should), we encourage you to delve deeper into the
subject. You can find many good texts out there that will satisfy your hunger
for numbers (such as Accounting For Dummies, by John A. Tracy [Wiley]).
The outcomes of your company’s accounting process are reflected in your
financial statements — cash flow, income, balance sheet — which record the
financial condition of your company at a particular point in time. Statements
usually cover a quarterly or annual period. Financial statements are also
used to secure loans and investment capital. 
Analyzing business financials is both art and science. The scientific part
comes in the formulas and ratios that you use to gauge the real health of your
business. The art part comes when you attempt to forecast the future based
on those financials. Get out your trusty crystal ball, because forecasting 
figures is difficult at best.
Finally, a thorough grounding in business finance wouldn’t be complete 
without an excellent understanding of the financial markets, which include
stocks, bonds, and debt and equity investment capital. A great business can
and will tap many sources of financing, and in this book, you’ll get a sense 
of what those sources are, when you should access them, and how you can
access them. (Check out the chapters of Part III for the details on these 
various financial topics and for more on money issues.)
Reaching Out to Customers
Probably no area of business has changed more drastically in recent years than
marketing. The Internet and easy, cheap access to production tools have made
anyone a potential marketer. For proof of this assertion, just check out all the
advertising and promotion utilized by users of YouTube, MySpace, Facebook,
and Linked In. In addition, scores of bloggers have taken the media world by
storm and now have the power to make or break a new product (or even a
person). They reach millions of consumers who serve as their loyal followers.
It seems that everyone is fighting to get noticed in a very crowded space, 
so you have to be pretty creative to stand out. Even established corporate
giants such as Nike have tapped into the power of YouTube to reach their
target audiences in new ways.
And don’t forget personal selling — still an important part of a company’s 
marketing package. How do you sell more effectively in a world where every-
16
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

one is bombarded with information? You can find all the answers in this book;
after reading what we have to say, you’ll come away with confidence that you
can reach and satisfy your customers. Head to the chapters of Part IV for all
your marketing needs.
The Rest of Your MBA Syllabus
Of course, running or managing a business involves more than just dealing
with a changing world, managing employees, grappling with finances, and
marketing your company’s products or services. Every business owner and
many executives and managers wear a variety of hats — taking care of what-
ever needs attention. We also cover the following topics in this book:
 Manufacturing and production: Some businesses (such as automobile
manufacturers or computer builders) need to consider issues of manu-
facturing, distribution, and sourcing of materials and products. With the
advent of advanced information systems technology, however, the inven-
tory, purchasing, and distribution environment has gone through radical
shifts — as have manufacturing processes themselves. If you work in
manufacturing or distribution, you need to be on top of these changes.
See Chapter 18 to begin your awakening.
 Risk management: Every business experiences risk; some businesses
experience more than others, of course (lion taming school?). The ques-
tion isn’t whether your business has risks; the question is what you do
about these risks. How can you minimize their potential impact on your
operations? (Check out Chapter 19 for more info.)
 Negotiations: If you’re in business (or a relationship), you know what it
is to negotiate. Whether you’re negotiating a pay raise or a multimillion-
dollar deal, you can apply certain skills that will make you a more effec-
tive negotiator. Coincidentally, we discuss some of the most effective
negotiation skills in Chapter 20.
 Economics: Although we don’t promise you that it’s the most exciting
subject in the MBA canon, economics certainly is an important one —
one that we give attention to in Chapter 21.
So, welcome to our world — a world filled with information, skills, and tips
that can make you a much more effective businessperson. The information
here applies no matter your position in an organization — from receptionist
to chairman. We hope you enjoy the journey through the world of the MBA.

The best (free) business resources
Some things in life are free. Fortunately, anyone
today can take advantage of plenty of free busi-
ness resources and information, both on the
Internet and off. The following list covers ten
great free resources that can help your business.
We also note where you can take advantage of
premium resources at the sites for a small fee:
 The Small Business Administration (www.
sba.gov)is the granddaddy of help for your
business needs. Established by the U.S. gov-
ernment in 1953, the SBA provides financial,
technical, and management assistance to
people who want to start, grow, and run 
businesses.
 MarketingProfs (www.marketingprofs.
com) is arguably the best marketing site on the
Internet. Why? Because it isn’t an aggregator of
everyone else’s marketing stuff; it generates new
content from its network of marketing professors
and professionals. Here you can find marketing
articles, blogs, case studies, events, and online
seminars. Much of the information on the site is
accessible with no fee, but you may want to con-
sider signing up for premium membership (about
$49 a year) to gain access to in-depth articles
and online seminars.
 WSJ
Entrepreneur
(www.wsj.com/
entrepreneur) provides a comprehen-
sive set of online resources for businesses
and the entrepreneur. You can discover and
utilize great articles, business-plan tools, and
maybe even your next business opportunity.
 The Center for Business Planning (www.
businessplans.org)
provides free
business-planning guidelines, which include
articles and templates for such things as a
cash-flow statement, mission statement, and
financial ratios. You can also find checklists
for segmenting your market and looking at
pricing, as well as a strategic marketing plan.
 Kauffman Foundation eVenturing (www.
eventuring.org) is devoted to growing
a business. We recommend that you check
out the content under its Collections section,
where you’ll find groupings of information on
finance and accounting, people and HR, sales
and marketing, products and services, opera-
tions, and the entrepreneur. In addition to the
topics you can explore on the site and its blog,
it sponsors a monthly e-newsletter that you
can sign up for.
 Mind Tools (www.mindtools.com) helps
consumers learn 100 essential life, career,
and management skills — free! Of course, the
site also offers self-development courses and
e-classes taught by experts — you’ll pay for
these courses, but the tuition is reasonable.
 SCORE (www.score.org),formerly known
as the Service Corps of Retired Executives,
bills itself as the “Counselors to America’s
Small Business.” More than 10,500 volun-
teers — coming from the ranks of retired
business owners, executives, and corporate
leaders — answer questions, give advice,
and share their wisdom and experience.
SCORE has an online, 24/7 counseling ser-
vice, and it has set up many offices nation-
wide for walk-in help.
 U.S. Export Assistance Centers are located 
in more than 100 cities around the United 
States. (You can find them through the U.S.
Department of Commerce at www.doc.
gov.) They provide assistance to businesses
that want to export goods and services to for-
eign countries. If you’ve never done business
with a foreign country, it can be a daunting
task. The counselors at the assistance centers
are trained to hold your hand through the
process.

B
usiness owners and managers live in a very exciting time. Every day
brings new surprises, because no matter where you live and do business
in the world, change is taking place — and not incrementally, so you can get
comfortable with it. Change is happening radically — almost overnight — in
ways that most businesses aren’t prepared for.
What is going on? Less than a decade into a new century, change is happen-
ing faster than the business world can keep up with it. Adapting to change is
a way of life in the business world, and one of the best ways for owners and
managers to prepare for the changes that are bound to crop up in the future
is to become more aware of the phenomenon of trends. Trends are patterns
that we observe in the world around us, and which may signal that a major
change is about to occur. In this chapter, we examine many of the key trends
that affect how all businesses operate today.
The World Really Is Flat!
Thomas Friedman discusses trends and changes in his best-selling book, 
The World Is Flat (Picador), which is really an instructional manual for under-
standing what’s going on in the business world today. By “flat,” Friedman isn’t
referring to the physical nature of the planet (in Columbus’s time, the world
was physically flat — at least that’s what they thought), but rather to the 
global marketplace. Technological advances and the Internet have leveled the
competitive landscape so that anyone anywhere can compete — the good, the
bad, and the ugly can all get into the game. This section delves deeper into why
today’s business world is flat and what that means to you, the business person.

20
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 
From outsourcing to insourcing: 
Listing the flattening factors
According to Friedman, human history has seen three major periods of 
globalization: 
1. The first period started with Columbus’s trip to the New World and was
characterized by demonstrations of power and imperialism.
2. The second period began in about 1800 and went to 2000. This period
was exemplified by the growth of multinational companies and the
decline in transportation and communication costs, which enabled
goods to be traded globally more affordably than ever before.
3. The third period — going on now — is about shrinking the planet, flatten-
ing it, and giving individuals the power to compete and collaborate on 
a global level.
Friedman also named ten factors that have brought about this flattening of the
world in the third period:
1. The fall of the Berlin wall in 1989: Tipped the balance of power toward
democracies and free markets — that’s good for business!
2. Netscape’s public offering in 1995: Brought the Internet to the masses
and made it possible for companies such as Amazon, Google, and eBay
to start and grow to an enormous size.
3. Workflow software: Enabled communication and collaboration world-
wide — that’s why you can now work from home (called telecommuting).
4. Open Source software: Inspired self-organizing teams and community
collaboration around a common objective. 
5. Outsourcing: Enhanced the economies of developing countries by giving
companies a way to reduce their cost of doing some business functions
such as manufacturing.
6. Moving offshore: Increased the ability to compete globally as companies
began putting offices and plants in other countries.
7. Global supply chains: Connected the world in a massive value chain.
8. Insourcing: Made it possible for small businesses to gain the competencies
of much larger companies.
9. Web search engines: Brought information to anyone, anywhere, any time.
10. Digital and wireless: Enabled 24/7 connectivity and virtual collaboration.

Many of these flatteners have been around for a long time. Individually, each
is powerful, but it’s the convergence of these ten at this point in time that has
created sufficient critical mass to flatten the world, making everything and
everyone accessible to anyone. 
And what does a flattened world look like? Friedman talks about visiting
Bangalore, India, and being startled by Pizza Hut billboards; glass-and-steel
buildings with familiar names such as Texas Instruments, IBM, and Microsoft;
and people who speak English with a perfect California accent (if such a thing
exists).
Hello, neighbor: When did 
China move in next door?
By taking advantage of technology and the Internet, China has moved from
being a third-world country to growing faster than any other modern econ-
omy. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) — a signifi-
cant event because it signaled that China was willing to acknowledge and
follow global rules of trade.
So, how did China begin growing so fast? It opened the floodgates for off-
shoring — moving manufacturing plants from their home sites (for example,
Europe or the United States) and plopping them down, lock, stock, and barrel,
in China. Why? Because in China, you can (for now at least) produce products
using cheaper labor, lower taxes, lower healthcare costs, lower energy costs,
and far-less restrictive environmental regulations. Because China is such an
attractive place to offshore, countries are clamoring to jump on the band-
wagon and offer similar incentives — countries such as Malaysia, Thailand,
Brazil, and Mexico.
If you’re in business today, you have some important objectives: Figure out
what you can outsource to China, what you can do in China via offshoring,
and what you can buy from China in terms of low-cost goods and services. In
a flat world, you can no longer afford to do business on your own, and you
can’t ignore your neighbors. (Check out Chapter 4 for more advice about
doing business in China.)
Googlevision: Searching 
everywhere for Waldo
Thanks to Internet sensation Google (the 800-pound gorilla of search engines),
anyone in the world with an Internet connection can find pretty much anything
they want to find. Suppose you don’t have time to go to the grocery store and
21
Chapter 2: Today’s Hottest Business Trends

you have to cook a meal with only the products you have on hand. Simply do 
a Google search using those items — milk, eggs, broccoli, tuna — in any one 
of a hundred languages and voila! You’ll have a list of recipes containing those
four items.
Today anyone can create their own sources of information, entertainment, and
knowledge in the most obscure areas possible, and then they can distribute
them to audiences of millions with equal ease.
The reason that Google surpasses everyone else when it comes to search
capability is that it goes beyond mere keyword search. Google’s founders
Sergey Brin and Larry Page developed an algorithm (a fancy word for a mathe-
matical formula that solves a specific problem) that ranks a Web page by the
number of other Web pages that link to it. Using this algorithm, users always
get the pages most relevant to their searches first. Then Brin and Page went
one step further and linked users with advertisers that have products and 
services directly related to those searches.
Search engines aren’t the only technology that enables users to find what
they want more easily. With digital video recorders (DVR) such as TiVo, you
can pause and replay live television, letting you decide what you want to
watch and, more importantly, when.
The dark side of the search trend is the ability of anyone to find out informa-
tion about you. Yes, that’s right. Your reputation, words, and behaviors follow
you wherever you go. In these days of Facebook, MySpace, and other social-
networking Web sites — not to mention Google — this can be a problem for
job seekers — especially job seekers who have lived, shall we say, colorful
lives and choose to display them in public forums.
Turnabout: When little businesses get 
big businesses to work for them
Big businesses working for little businesses? That’s right. Freidman calls this
phenomenon insourcing and it has taken the traditional outsourcing model to
a whole new level. Outsourcing is hiring someone else to do the business func-
tions that you don’t want to do or for which you don’t have expertise. So you
may outsource human resource activities such as payroll and hiring to a firm
that specializes in these tasks. With insourcing, on the other hand, your out-
sourced partner becomes an integral part of your business.
Suppose your company produces unusual pieces of furniture that customers
can’t find anywhere else in the world. Your potential to sell worldwide, using
the power of the Internet to get your message out, is huge. Logistics is the
problem, and you have no idea how to begin. You can start by securing the
help of an international shipping company, such as UPS Store, that can work
22
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

with you to find the best packaging for your product and the best vendors to
supply those packaging materials. Then UPS slaps smart labels on your pack-
ages so it can track them anywhere in its delivery area (which is likely to be
worldwide in today’s business environment). It also works with customs 
officials and makes sure your packages reach their destinations.
To achieve that level of collaboration with you, UPS gets inside your business
to really understand how it operates. UPS may even help you redesign your
production processes to make them more efficient. In fact, some companies
never even touch their products; they just let third-party insourcing firms do
all the work — sometimes even warranty repairs.
The basis for the successful collaborations that occur today (as with the previ-
ous example) is trust. To turn over a portion of your business to a supply-chain
manager, you have to be sure that the company is reputable and reliable. Ask
the company for customer references, check with the Better Business Bureau
at www.bbb.org (it provides information on more than 2.5 million companies),
and be sure to search online for any possible complaints that a disgruntled
customer may have posted on a Web site somewhere.
Do It Yourself: User-Generated
Everything
In today’s flat world, people no longer depend on others to provide them
with entertainment and information. Rather, when they want something, they
create it themselves — everything from promotional videos and independent
films to editorials and communities of interest on any topic imaginable. We
don’t know anyone who can pinpoint exactly when this phenomenon started,
but we can identify a few technologies that converged to help make average
Joes and Janes into household names — celebrities, first-class marketers,
political pundits, and journalists. The possibilities are endless.
The technologies and related applications that converged to make this possible
include the following:
 The Internet (no surprise here)
 Wireless technology (Apple’s iPhone, global positioning systems [GPS],
personal digital assistants [PDAs] — you get the picture)
 Low-priced, high-quality video and digital content production technology
(Vegas Movie Studio and Adobe Creative)
 Advanced search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and MSN)
 eBay and PayPal (buy and sell products/services without the need 
to build retail stores or handle credit cards yourself)
23
Chapter 2: Today’s Hottest Business Trends

 Social media networks (MySpace, Facebook, and YouTube)
 Web logs (blogs), podcasts, and vodcasts (technologies that make 
communication by text, voice, and video interactive)
In the following sections, we look at two key “user-generated” trends that are
putting communication power into the hands of anyone with something to say.
Tapping the new opinion leaders
In the past, consumers looked to reputable sources with brand names to 
get opinions on everything from the best music and films to cars, electronics,
and so forth — sources such as MTV for music, Ebert and Roeper for films,
Edmunds for cars, and PC Magazine for electronics. Consumers still look to
those sources today but in ever-declining numbers. Why? Because peer net-
works are becoming the trusted sources for critical reviews of products and
services.
Customers who are unhappy with the service they receive can reach millions
of people worldwide to make their cases against the offending companies, 
and companies really have no way to avoid this kind of bad press when they’re
doing a good job. In a connected, online world, every individual customer has
power, and collectively customers can destroy a company or make it hugely
successful.
Although big companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on promotion
and customer service, for almost every major consumer product company, you
can find Web sites devoted to complaining about it. For example, if you Google
“Microsoft hell,” you come up with more than 2,550,000 pages of complaints
about the company and its products. “Dell hell” and “Wal-Mart hell” produce
the same number of pages.
What this tells you is that a company’s brand image isn’t really what it says 
it is, but what Google says it is. This means that today, the opinion leaders on
any product are the customers who try it, buy it, and write about it. And a lot
of those customers are out there.
What keeps all this consumer power from becoming a lot of noise? How do 
you filter the bad stuff and get to the good? That’s the value of search engines
such as Google — they can get to those specialized niche markets and you, the
consumer, can get recommendations tailored to your specific needs. In other
words, you can find out what the opinion leaders have to say about that rare
book your grandmother recommended that’s been out of print for decades.

Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

Amateurs compete with experts 
online and over the airwaves
When Google entered the world of television with Google Video in January
2006, it changed the way that broadcast networks promote their shows, and 
it gave amateur TV producers a chance to get their 15 minutes of fame. Similar
to the video marketplaces that followed — from Microsoft, Yahoo!, and AOL
(and don’t forget YouTube) — Google brought the amateurs and the experts
together in a new way in a format that’s a win-win for both. For example,
broadcasters now have a global storefront to display trailers for upcoming
shows and to sell their archived shows, and an independent movie producer
can upload his video from his home in Kazakhstan and become an overnight
success without ever tapping the traditional distribution channels.
Some of the top online-video shows are viewed by as many as 250,000 people,
which rivals many cable TV shows. And when the shows become successful,
they can actually sell 30-second advertising spots. These online shows have
become so successful that network broadcasters such as NBC are now adver-
tising and promoting on YouTube and associating their brands with popular
bloggers.
Although television is in no danger of disappearing in favor of PC screens and
Internet videos, the new generation (the New Millennials, which we discuss
later in this chapter) is quite comfortable watching their favorite shows on
their computers or iPods, and that’s a trend that isn’t going to stop.
Do It for Others: Becoming 
Socially Responsible
Making a profit isn’t enough to announce success any more; businesses must
also be socially responsible. Social responsibility is about operating your busi-
ness in an ethical, legal, environmentally friendly, and community-conscious
way. Today, businesses often have social missions as well as profit missions —
in other words, serve as role models and change agents for the betterment of
society. Those are lofty expectations, to be sure, but we’re guessing that you’d
rather figure out now how to be socially responsible before the watchdogs in
the press conclude that you’re not. This section takes a closer look at this
trend of social responsibility in today’s business world.
25
Chapter 2: Today’s Hottest Business Trends

Doing good is good business
The fallout from the Enron and WorldCom scandals (among many others), and
the revelation that “imperial” CEOs were serving short tenures and then walk-
ing away with hundreds of millions while their companies’ stock struggled, was
more than the public (not to mention shareholders and the government) could
tolerate. Add in the fears about global warming, which have prompted environ-
mental activists to point a finger at business’s operational practices, and you
have a new set of standards being applied to measure business success.
Finding ways to be socially responsible isn’t too difficult. Here are a few ideas:
 You can donate products, services, or expertise to the community:
• Many companies that produce products with a shelf life, such as
bread and other food products, donate them to feed the homeless
in their communities.
• If your company has an expertise that may be valuable in the 
community, consider donating it for a day. Starving Students, a San
Diego moving company, helps to relocate women and children from
abusive homes, for instance.
 You can gather a group of local companies together to do something
that has a bigger impact, such as adopting an elementary school.
For example, Just Desserts, a San Francisco-based bakery, put together 
a group of 35 businesses to adopt an elementary school. They undertook
renovation projects such as painting classrooms and planting trees.
 Give employees an opportunity to volunteer their time every month in
charitable activities. You may even consider adopting a specific charity
and focusing your efforts on it.
 Sponsor an event such as a food drive or highway cleanup.
 Sponsor a city league team for soccer, baseball, or another sport.
It’s not easy being green
Being socially responsible is a worthy and attainable goal, but when busi-
nesses set goals that are extremely ambitious and rely on too many factors
not under their control, they set themselves up for failure. Such was the case
for Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry’s, when he launched Community
Products Inc. (CPI). He had the noble goal of saving the rainforest by donat-
ing 60 percent of the profits the company earned by importing nut products
from the regions that encompassed the rainforest in South America.
26
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

Unfortunately, the nuts CPI received from the region often came with foreign
objects in them (such as glass, rocks, coliform bacteria, cigarette butts, and
insects). Cohen also ran into problems with working conditions and the work-
ers themselves, so it was difficult to produce sufficient product of acceptable
quality in a reliable way. Eventually, CPI was forced to declare bankruptcy.
The moral of the story is to set achievable social responsibility goals. Setting 
a very big goal will certainly capture the attention of the media, but remember:
the media will also be there to report when you don’t achieve it.
Take time to think about all the ways that your company can become more
green. Some of them include using recycled office supplies, such as paper and
printer cartridges, and hiring a consultant to check your business processes
for ways to be more environmentally friendly. Don’t forget even simple things
can make a difference, such as using ceramic mugs for coffee instead of the
usual paper cups.
The Changing Workforce: Harnessing 
the Power of the Millennials
You can classify the generations occupying today’s workforce into four 
categories: 
 The Mature Generation: veterans of WWII and the Korean War
 The Baby Boomers: born between 1945 and 1961
 Generation X-ers: born between 1962 and 1980
 The Millennials: born after 1981
If we asked how and where Kennedy died, the Mature Generation and the
Baby Boomers would no doubt say, “In Dallas in a motorcade by Lee Harvey
Oswald’s gunshot.” Generation X-ers might reply “In a plane crash off Martha’s
Vineyard.” And the Millennials could possibly say, “Who’s Kennedy?”
This simple question illustrates a critical trend in the workforce today: Four
generations with very different attitudes are being forced to just get along. But
with different styles of communication, different work ethics, and different
value systems, this is no easy task. 
Four different perspectives can wreak havoc when it comes to hiring, moti-
vating, managing, and teaming — prominent topics throughout this book. If
you look at the differences among the generations, you can see the problem
clearly. Check out the groups in Table 2-1.

As you can see, the communications styles of Baby Boomers and Gen X-ers are
the same. Remember, Baby Boomers are workaholics, so technology has been
a boon to them because it enables them to do even more work! Gen X-ers, on
the other hand, seem to do a better job of separating work and pleasure. Of
course, not everyone within each group is exactly the same, but on average,
the characteristics ring true.
So, what’s a manager or business owner to do? The only thing he or she can do
is deal with the differences. Besides tailoring your work environment to satisfy
the needs of the four generations, you can look at Chapter 7 for ideas for moti-
vating employees in today’s work environment. In the following sections, we
focus on the generation coming up — the Millennials — because they’re clearly
the most unusual generation of the four.
The Millennials: Understanding 
the age of entitlement
To understand where business is going today, you have to appreciate the gen-
eration that was born after 1981 and hit the workforce at the start of the new
millennium. Every couple decades or so, the younger generation is so differ-
ent from previous generations that it actually precipitates a cultural shift.
This is what’s happening right now with the Millennials. Here are some char-
acteristics of this generation:
28
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

 As employees, they’ve been called spoiled and entitled.
 Their baby-boomer parents raised them to never experience failure — the
“everyone gets a trophy” attitude. Therefore, they’re generally risk-averse.
 They’re described as family-oriented, requiring clear and consistent
expectations and living in the moment.
 Having grown up in a digital world, they’re always connected.
This last point may be the key to understanding the Millennials. Most 
have been using computers almost from birth, so they’ve developed a set 
of attitudes that color the way they view the world. Here are some examples
of these attitudes:
 Computers, cell phones, iPods, and so on are normal, required parts 
of life, not simply technologies or privileges. They want to feel 
connected 24/7.
 The Internet is more interesting than television.
 What you do is more important than what you know (the sense that
information isn’t permanent; it’s constantly changing).
 It’s better to solve problems by trial and error.
 Multitasking is a way of life, no matter the situation (which is why they’re
texting, surfing the Internet, and listening to music while in meetings with
their bosses!).
 Delays are intolerable. The immediacy of the Internet and e-mail has
made the Millennials impatient, with short attention spans.
 If something is digital, it belongs to everyone.
Why is this information important? Because employers today are having a 
difficult time adjusting to the very different work habits of this group. They’re
typically collaborative and don’t like to be managed. They also see every job
as a temporary stepping stone to the next opportunity. Businesses looking to
tap this new market must try to understand what matters to the Millennials,
because their motivation isn’t always clear.
Motivating new Millennial employees
How do you, as an employer, inspire and motivate these young employees?
Here are a few suggestions:
 Put your most people-friendly managers in charge of Millennials (and
Gen X-ers for that matter) and make sure they are able to build trusting
relationships.
 Reward them with time off rather than overtime. They will appreciate that!
29
Chapter 2: Today’s Hottest Business Trends

 Avoid having them clock into an office — let them work from home — 
at least some of the time — if possible.
 Give them an opportunity for continuing education through conferences,
night classes, and workshops you bring into the office — they love getting

 Don’t be concerned with titles but rather define jobs by responsibilities
and make sure they know how they contribute to the success of the
company.
 Ask for their input into how the company is run.

E
ntrepreneurship is one of the most popular words in the English language
today. You see it everywhere. People are buzzing about entrepreneurs and
entrepreneurial companies. In fact, if you watch and listen to enough forms of
media to get your information, you may believe that just about anyone qualifies
as an entrepreneur in some fashion — from lawyers and doctors to artists and
teachers. And every type of business seems to qualify — shoe repair shops,
accounting offices, home-based cosmetics sellers, and even General Electric.
However, the term is so overused that most people aren’t quite sure what it
stands for.
We need to set the record straight with some definitions. An entrepreneur
is an individual who recognizes opportunities, gathers the resources needed 
to act on those opportunities, and drives the opportunities to completion.
Entrepreneurship is the study of entrepreneurs and their ventures. It’s also 
a way of thinking, or mindset, that’s opportunity-focused, innovative, and
growth-oriented. Although entrepreneurship is most commonly associated
with starting a business, it also exists within large corporations (called 
corporate venturing), where an individual identifies opportunities, gathers
resources from inside and outside the corporation, and carries the opportu-
nity through to completion; check out the last section in this chapter for
more info. This chapter gives you the big picture of entrepreneurship and 
the world of the entrepreneur so you can think about whether becoming an
entrepreneur is a business career path that makes sense for you.

Understanding the Importance 
of Entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurship provides a number of very important benefits to society —
namely economic growth, new industries (and with them new opportunities),
and new jobs. We examine these benefits in more detail in the following 
sections.
What’s exciting about entrepreneurship is that it isn’t limited to any specific
country, gender, race, age, or socioeconomic sector. Anyone who has the 
passion to work for herself or himself can become an entrepreneur. You can
learn and then apply the skills and behaviors required to be successful as an
entrepreneur. What can’t be taught or learned, however, is the passion and
persistence that entrepreneurs must have to be the best at what they do. It’s
the same passion and persistence that great musicians, artists, writers, and
scientists must have to excel in their fields.
Entrepreneurs contribute 
to economic growth
Economists have called entrepreneurship the catalyst for economic growth.
When entrepreneurs identify new customer segments, new customer needs,
existing customer needs that competitors haven’t met, and new methods of
manufacturing and distributing products and services, the result is economic
growth. Today, companies can trade virtually any type of good or service
over any distance — all because of entrepreneurs.
Entrepreneurs who have commercialized new technologies have played critical
roles in the global economy. For example, Google’s Internet search engine has
made it possible to find almost anything anywhere in the world. Whenever an
entrepreneur develops and markets a new technology to the marketplace, new
jobs are created, suppliers of raw materials and other capabilities benefit from
selling to the company, and wholesalers and retailers benefit from the revenues
they receive for selling the technology. In short, entrepreneurship is good for
the economy.
Entrepreneurship gives 
birth to new industries
Entrepreneurship results in new industries being formed that provide 
fresh landscapes for opportunities, businesses, and jobs, all which lead 

to economic growth. The mobile-device industry, for example, emerged out 
of the development of wireless technology. Today, everyone can carry their
documents, music, and videos with them in handheld devices (your iPod and
cell phone are with you 24/7, we assume). Because this is a relatively new
industry, there are still plenty of opportunities to go around.
As the industry grows, however, the strongest and most successful entrepre-
neurial firms begin to acquire the weaker firms (or they fail, usually from poor
management) and the industry consolidates. The large firms that remain
become the opinion leaders in the industry and influence how the entire
industry operates. Entrepreneurs who enter the industry at this stage usually
introduce new innovations that will keep the industry growing. If entrepre-
neurs don’t introduce new innovations to the industry or another industry
emerges with innovations that make the old industry’s technology obsolete,
the industry can decline or even die out. You may have seen this happen 
with the decline of the typewriter industry when personal computers were
adopted.
Entrepreneurs create new jobs
New opportunities result in job creation, and small entrepreneurial ventures
are the major job creators in the economy. In 2003 (the most recent data we
have from the Small Business Administration [SBA]), small businesses created
1,990,326 net new jobs, compared to 994,667 for large companies. That’s not
bad! In general, the SBA defines a small business as one with fewer than 500
employees that isn’t dominant in its industry. Okay, that doesn’t sound very
small until you compare it with a company such as Microsoft, which has 
more than 60,000 employees, or Wal-Mart, which has more than 1.6 million
employees worldwide!
Thinking as an Entrepreneur
One of the important things to know about entrepreneurship is that it’s 
a personal journey. Entrepreneurship is about people — how you interact with
them, make decisions, plan for the future, deal with conflict, and so on. All the
decisions involved in starting, growing, and exiting a business affect not only
the business and the people associated with it, but also the entrepreneur. This
section helps you understand what entrepreneurial thinking is and identify if
you’re ready to think like an entrepreneur. And if you are, we give you several
ideas to get you started.
33
Chapter 3: Entrepreneurship for Everyone

Understanding entrepreneurial thinking
Perhaps you’re reading this chapter front to back because you’re completely
sold on the idea of entrepreneurship. Before we go any further, however, we
must agree on one thing: starting a business isn’t for everyone. And thank
goodness for that, because we do need some scientists, mathematicians,
artists, and physicians to keep this world running. We’re not trying to turn
everyone into entrepreneurs, but we do think that there’s value in learning
how to think like an entrepreneur.
With that in mind, here are some characteristics of entrepreneurial thinking
that are important to succeeding as an entrepreneur:
 Entrepreneurs are comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty.
They know that the best ideas come out of uncertainty. And they know
that there will always be unanswered questions, so they attempt to find
answers for as many critical questions as possible while moving forward,
answering the rest as they go.
 Entrepreneurs have self discipline and tenacity. In other words, they
know how to focus on a task and stick to it through completion. That’s
why they succeed more than they fail. And speaking of failure . . .
 Entrepreneurs aren’t afraid to fail. They understand that if you never
fail at anything, you haven’t taken any risks. And taking risks is how you
learn and grow a business.
 Entrepreneurs believe that they alone control their destiny. They 
know that if they screw up, they should look nowhere else but the mirror.
But with this attitude, they also have the freedom to decide their future,
regardless of what the government or a competitor does.
 Entrepreneurs focus on opportunity and innovation. They strive to
identify all the great opportunities out there — not only for products
and services, but also for new ways of doing business, new marketing
strategies, and new distribution models. The more they network and
take calculated risks, the more opportunity will come to them. This is
nature’s law, and entrepreneurs practice it daily.
No two entrepreneurs are exactly alike, but, in general, these characteristics
can be found in people who launch new companies.
Testing your entrepreneurial mindset
If you’ve seen the list of ways that entrepreneurs think in the previous section,
you may want to test whether you’re ready to start thinking like an entrepre-
neur, too. If so, take our little test in Table 3-1. No one will see it but you, so be
honest in your answers.

Table 3-1
Entrepreneur Preferences Quiz
Question
Yes
No
Do you start projects on your own without waiting until someone 
asks you to start?
Would you be able to work on growing your business for a year 
without pay?
Do you always stick with a project until you finish it?
Do you like working in teams?
Do you like meeting new people?
Are you comfortable asking for money?
Are you comfortable with a lack of security?
Do you have the time to devote to a new business start-up?
Do you have the support of your family to start a business?
Are you comfortable with debt?
The more of these questions you can answer “yes” to, the more likely it is
that you’ll be comfortable with dealing with the issues related to being an
entrepreneur.
Beginning to think like an entrepreneur
So, you think you have the entrepreneurial spirit burning within you. You can
take a number of steps to help yourself begin to think like an entrepreneur —
after which you can find an opportunity and do something great! The following
sections present a few of these steps.
Find a mentor
A mentor is someone who’s leading the kind of life you want to lead and who
serves as a role model for you. Your mentor should be a sounding board for
new ideas, a critic when you need to come back down to earth, and an advisor
because he or she has been there. So, how do you find this superperson? By
networking, of course (check out the next section for more on networking)!
People who’ve been successful often enjoy helping others make the journey,
so don’t be afraid to ask any potential candidates.
35
Chapter 3: Entrepreneurship for Everyone

Don’t ask a prospective mentor to take the job on the first date! Take your
prospective mentor to coffee and get to know him or her. A potential mentor
needs to feel comfortable with you before he or she will even consider saying
yes. If you’ve done your homework about this mentor, you’ll be able to talk
about things of interest to help build a rapport. After you establish a rapport,
you can begin to talk about your needs as a budding entrepreneur.
Start shaking hands to network
One of the most important things you can do to start down the road to 
entrepreneurship is to build a network of people who can serve as resources
for anything you may need. But not just any people — the right people. The
right people are those who can open doors for you in communities of people

Debunking myths about entrepreneurs
To understand how entrepreneurs think, you first
need to drop a few myths or stereotypes you may
be carrying around. Given the media’s love affair
with entrepreneurs, it shouldn’t surprise you that
these myths have grown up around them:
 Myth #1: It takes a lot of money to start a
business.
Not true! In fact, every year, Inc. Magazine pro-
files businesses that have started on $1,000 or
less. And among the mag’s annual list of the
500 fastest-growing private companies, you
see no relationship between the amount of
start-up capital invested and business success
(for more on start-up capital, see Chapter 14).
 Myth #2: Entrepreneurs are in it for the
money.
Okay, some entrepreneurs think that way, but
the number one reason that most entrepre-
neurs start businesses is independence — the
ability to create something they can call their
own instead of working for someone else.
Entrepreneurs want to control their destiny.
 Myth #3: Entrepreneurs are born, not made.
This is the same as saying that you can’t teach
entrepreneurship. According to management
guru Peter Drucker, entrepreneurship is a 
discipline, so it can be learned. Passion and
persistence may be in your genes, but it takes
work to develop the skills that entrepreneurs
have.
 Myth #4: You need a business plan to 
succeed.
Yes, investors and lenders want to see a 
business plan before forking over cash, but if
you don’t need these resources at start-up, you
may be able to launch your business based on
the results of a feasibility analysis and then get
some traction with customers (see the later
section “Conduct a feasibility study”). Some
Internet entrepreneurs, such as Richard
Rosenblatt of Demand Media, know how to get
a Web site up and make money within a couple
weeks. These savvy entrepreneurs know that
testing the market is more important than
spending the time to write a business plan.
 Myth #5: You have to be young and reckless
to be an entrepreneur.
This definitely isn’t true. In fact, the Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor Report (www.
gemconsortium.org) found that men and
women in the 45–64 age bracket start 35 per-
cent of all the businesses in the United States
and 22 percent globally. Entrepreneurship is for
all ages!

you otherwise couldn’t have tapped. For example, we’ve met key people who
have introduced us to some really fascinating communities: physicists, astro-
nauts, and the World Cup sailing community, to name a few. And these new
communities have been the sources of a wealth of new business opportunities.
Read about and hang out with entrepreneurs
One of the best ways to discover whether entrepreneurship is right for you and
to start thinking like an entrepreneur is to find out more about entrepreneurs
by reading (you can’t pick up a magazine today without seeing an entrepreneur
on the cover). You also can go to events in your local community where entre-
preneurs do their networking, such as the Chamber of Commerce, industry
trade association meetings, and university networking events. Entrepreneurs
love to talk, so after you get one started, watch out! You may learn more than
you ever wanted to know about entrepreneurship.
Take charge of your life with entrepreneurial thinking
Hanging out with yourself may sound far less interesting than hanging out
with entrepreneurs, but you must assess your personality and preferences 
so that if you decide to start a business or just want to take charge of your
career, you’ll be in a better position to do it. Research has identified six
important barriers that prevent people from taking charge of their lives or
becoming self employed. If you understand your feelings about these issues
and deal with them, you’ll be on your way to overcoming them and taking
charge of your life. These six barriers include
 Lack of confidence: I’ve never done this before.
 Financial needs: Where will I get the money to do this (see Chapter 14)?
 Knowing how to start: What should I do first (see the following section)?
 Personal or family issues: I have a spouse, three kids, two dogs, and 
a mortgage.
 Time constraints: I don’t even have time to sleep, let alone start 
a business.
 Lack of skills: What do I need to know to do this?
All these fears and barriers come from uncertainty. So, get up off the sofa and
start learning. This book is a great start. You also can Google Entrepreneur,
Start-up, or any other keyword related to the questions you want answered.
The information is all out there waiting for you.
Finding an Opportunity
How do entrepreneurs find great opportunities? Do they have a special talent
that others don’t have? Not really. They’re simply creative in their thinking.
37
Chapter 3: Entrepreneurship for Everyone

Entrepreneurship is a creative process, not a scientific one. It’s chaotic, not
linear. In fact, if you’re a highly organized person who wakes up every day
knowing exactly how your day will go, your chances of discovering a new
opportunity will be very low. On the other hand, if your life is a bit more
chaotic — things change every day, and you’re not stuck in any ruts — 
your chances of being more opportunistic are dramatically higher.
Fortunately, everyone has at least some creative juices flowing; you just need
to know how to activate the creativity so you can make it work for you. This
section focuses on uncovering the barriers to creativity and removing them
so you can better identify opportunities and then act on them.
Identifying the barriers to creativity
People have plenty of excuses for not being creative, but maybe that’s because
they see creativity only as invention — coming up with a totally new product
or service. Although invention certainly is exciting, it’s probably the least
common way that businesspeople express creativity. The following are a
couple common barriers to creativity you may encounter:
 I have no time to be creative! Sure, entrepreneurs are busy people. In
fact, today everybody is bombarded with info from conversations with
other people, e-mail, the Internet, and their cellphones. And everybody
wants answers, right now. No one wants to wait anymore because they
assume that everyone is connected. It’s also amazing how many people
let others control their days by always being on call.
For 20 minutes every day, turn everything off and just listen to yourself. 
At first, you won’t know what to do. Your mind will be racing about the
things you think you should be doing, but eventually, with a little practice,
your mind will settle down and open up. We promise! In time, you’ll look
forward to those 20 minutes — especially after the first great business
idea pops into your uncluttered mind. Give it a try!
 I have no confidence that I can do this! It’s much easier to take the path
you already know than risk getting lost by trying the one less traveled.
But it’s the path you don’t know that may hold the creative opportunity
you’ve been looking for.
Often, people are afraid to be creative or offer creative ideas because
they don’t want to be criticized. But consider poor Thomas Edison, who
tried and failed 6,000 times before inventing the light bulb. Don’t you
think he took some criticism along the way? Maybe a little ridicule, too?
Did that stop him? Thank goodness it didn’t, or we wouldn’t be able to
see this page we’re writing on.
To build up your confidence, set some small goals and practice, practice,
practice.
38
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

What’s that? You don’t have a creative bone in your body? We hate to
tell you, but there’s no such thing as a creative bone. Bones are just
bones; they’re either strong or weak, but never creative. However, your
mind is an amazing thing, and it can be manipulated to cause you to
believe whatever you want to believe. So, keep telling yourself that
you’re creative, and at least you won’t be mentally blocking yourself
from becoming creative.
Removing the barriers to creativity
Most entrepreneurs improve on a product/service/concept that already
exists, or they find a way to solve a problem they see or have experienced.
You probably show this type of creativity every day. When was the last time
you didn’t have a hammer handy and you had to find a way to pound a nail?
Perhaps you took off your shoe or used a book or some other hard object.
That’s creative thinking at work!
However, sometimes barriers pop up and you may not know how to get rid 
of them. You need to be proactive about becoming more creative and oppor-
tunistic, so get out your sledgehammer and start removing the barriers to
creativity. This section helps.
Find your most creative environment
Your chances of being creative increase when you’re in the right environment.
The environment in which you work can either stimulate or discourage creativ-
ity. For example, if your workplace has a rigid structure and military-like chain
of command, it will be difficult to think “out of the box” you’re currently in.
One study found that the place where people have the most creative ideas 
is the bathroom! Well, when you think about it, it makes sense. You’re typi-
cally by yourself and probably aren’t accessible — the perfect environment
for contemplation (assuming you don’t have a library of magazines with you).
The basic idea here is to find a quiet place without a lot of distraction. Think
about where you were when you had your last great idea. That may give you
a clue as to the type of environment that encourages your creative juices.
Keep a journal
Writing in a journal can be a great way to overcome your creative barriers.
How many times have you said, “I’ll have to remember to write this idea
down,” but by the time you get a pen and paper, you’ve forgotten the idea?
Keep a journal with you at all times so you can jot down those ideas so you
don’t forget them.
You really never know when you may get a great idea. Many people come up
with exciting ideas in their dreams or when they’re first waking up. Wouldn’t it
be wise to have a pen and paper near your bed so you don’t lose those ideas?
39
Chapter 3: Entrepreneurship for Everyone

Practice solving problems
As we stated earlier, most “new” ideas are based on something that already
exists. And that something that already exists may be a problem that needs
to be solved. Problems in the marketplace are great sources of business
opportunities.
When was the last time you flew somewhere and spent some time in an air-
port? Airports are great sources of problems that need solving. To gain some
experience, see how many airport problems you can identify and then practice
finding ways to solve those problems. Granted, some of your solutions may be
a bit off-the-wall, but, who knows, you may come up with an idea that could
become a successful business.
Magazines, newspapers, and the Internet also are excellent sources of inspira-
tion for businesses. And don’t forget the government. It’s always coming up
with new laws and regulations that cause problems for people; however, these
same problems can become opportunities for an entrepreneur. For example,
all those recycling ordinances in cities have inspired many businesses, which
have turned recyclable material into new products.
Network your way to opportunity
Business associates are the second most common source of new ideas after
problems. Your network of business contacts is particularly useful when it
includes people from a variety of different types of industries. For example, a
technology or a method for producing a particular product may be familiar to
you because you work in, say, the aerospace industry. You have a network con-
tact in the automobile industry and through discussions with that person you
discover that you may be able to take your aerospace technology or method
into the automobile industry as a new venture.
We’re not suggesting that you steal ideas from the people you know, but you
can let the conversations you have with your associates open your mind to
new ways of thinking about things. That’s why it’s so important not to hang
around only with people like you. If you’re a businessperson, go spend time
with scientists or artists. These people look at the world differently and have
different problems, and they may need someone like you (an entrepreneur) to
solve them. (See the earlier section “Beginning to think like an entrepreneur”
for more on networking.)
Testing a New Business Idea
From the moment you come up with a great business idea, the questions start.
Does anybody else think this is a great idea? Is there a way to make money at
this? Where do I start? The best place to start is testing the idea in stages to
make sure you’re not the only person in the world who thinks it’s a great idea.
40
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

In this section, we give you a strategy for tackling your new business idea in
manageable bites. Bon Appétit!
Develop a business concept
What’s the difference between an idea and an opportunity? An opportunity is 
an idea that has commercial potential. One way that you can turn an idea into
an opportunity is by developing a business concept. Think of the business con-
cept as an elevator pitch on a very fast elevator. Elevator pitch refers to the 30
seconds that an entrepreneur has to impress a potential investor. If you have
only 30 seconds to talk about your business, you want to capture the investor’s
attention and convey the essentials in a clear and concise manner.
An effective business concept identifies the following four components:
 The product or service you’re offering
 The customer (the person or business that will be paying you)
 The benefit or value proposition (what’s in it for the customer?)
 The distribution or how you plan to deliver the benefit to the customer
The following sections help you develop your business concept.
Define the product or service
You need to make sure you know specifically what you’re offering to the 
customer. Today, the boundary between product and service business has 
all but disappeared as companies diversify their offerings, so you may decide
to offer both a product and a service related to that product. Of course, that
decision will depend on what your customer wants. The actual design of your
product or service should come from a deep understanding of the customer’s
needs (see Chapter 15) and your team’s capabilities.
It’s also important to define your product or service’s competitive advantage
in the marketplace. In other words, how is your product or service different
from what’s already out there? Intellectual property such as a patent or trade
secret can offer a substantial competitive advantage, but an innovative
process or marketing strategy can also help you stand out from the crowd.
Define the customer and benefit
Many entrepreneurs get confused when they have to identify their customers
and the potential benefits they’ll provide those customers. That’s because in
many businesses, the customer isn’t the end user or beneficiary of the product
or service. For example, suppose you’re manufacturing a new kind of golf club
for women that better fits their grip and enables them to improve their swing.
The end user for your club is a female golfer. But who pays you? Probably not
41
Chapter 3: Entrepreneurship for Everyone

the woman, unless you sell directly to the customer over the Internet. Most
likely, you’ll sell the clubs through a golf shop, so the golf shop pays you and 
is therefore your customer.
Identifying the customer is important because, in this example, the benefits
that the golf shop wants (the ability to offer unique products with quick
turnover and high margins) aren’t the same as the benefits that the end user
(consumer) wants (ease of use and improved performance).
The trick is that you must satisfy the needs of your primary customer and
make sure that the end user’s needs are satisfied as well. For more on customer
identification, jump to Chapter 15.
Customers buy benefits, not features. The two are quite different. Features are
the characteristics of the product or service; benefits are the intangible aspects
that solve the customer’s pain (such as convenience, health, and saving time).
The female golfer benefits from a club that better fits her grip and enables a
more accurate swing, not the color of the grip or the attractiveness of the club.
Define the distribution channel
You need to define your organization’s distribution channel when developing
your business concept. The distribution channel is the way you’ll deliver your
value proposition to the customer. You can distribute your product or service
and its benefit in a couple ways (for more on distribution, head to Chapter 18):
 Directly to the customer, such as through the Internet or by providing 
a service.
 Indirectly through a distributor or retailer that sells your product. These
companies are called channel intermediaries; they provide their service
so that the entrepreneur can concentrate on what he or she does best.
Which route you take depends on your customers’ expectations (how do your
customers prefer to buy?) and the costs involved. Using intermediaries raises
the price of the product to the end user but may make it possible for the entre-
preneur’s company to grow faster and reach more customers. Researching the
industry to discover what similar businesses are doing is critical to making a
decision between the direct and indirect channels.
Put your business concept together
After completing the steps in the previous sections, the only thing missing from
the business concept is the compelling story. The compelling story conveys
the pain or problem the customer has that your product or service will solve.
Here’s an example of a story:
Wildfire destruction is on the rise each year along with the amount of acres
that are burned. More people are living in areas that are prone to wildfire.
Over 38 percent of all homes being built are located in these urban/rural
42
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

interface areas. The problem is that there are not enough fire personnel to
protect homeowners against the wildfires that occur in these locations.
Consumer Fire Products, Inc. (CFPI) has designed, developed, and will 
distribute directly to the customer the FOAMSAFE(tm) system, a new patent-
pending exterior fire protection system that automatically activates whenever
a property is threatened by fire. Homeowners in urban/rural interface areas 
will benefit from peace of mind, knowing that their homes are protected.

Conduct a feasibility study
Putting together a concept statement (see the previous sections) means 
that you now have a business opportunity that you can test. One of the most
important skills that an entrepreneur can acquire is the ability to conduct 
a feasibility analysis. Feasibility analysis tests the viability of a new business
concept before you spend a lot of time and effort to prepare a business for
launch. There’s a lot of uncertainty in a start-up business; feasibility analys
is gives you a way to reduce some of that uncertainty and the associated risk,
which will help you and make potential investors happy!
The ultimate goal of the feasibility analysis is to assist the entrepreneur in
thinking critically and answering fundamental questions about the business
concept. You want to achieve a high level of confidence that the conditions are
right to go forward and start your business. Table 3-2 summarizes the various
tests and the key questions you need to answer for each, and the sections that
follow go into more detail about the tests.

Conduct industry and market analysis
The feasibility process doesn’t have to be linear, but it does help to start 
the analysis with the environment in which your business will operate. That
environment is the industry, which is a group of businesses that will form the
value chain for your new venture — manufacturers, suppliers, distributors,
retailers, and so forth. These companies essentially represent your support
network. Depending on the industry, it may also include government agencies,
regulatory bodies, and trade associations, to name just a few possibilities.
You want to understand the industry’s size and where it is in its life cycle. 
Yes, industries go through a life cycle just like humans do — birth, childhood,
adolescence, adulthood, old age, and death. Your industry’s stage in that cycle
will affect your business strategy. For example, an emerging industry (early
childhood) is like the Wild West — every company for itself. Companies are
pushing and shoving, trying to grab their share of the industry and establish
themselves as the industry standard. In this type of industry, tons of opportu-
nities exist, which is a lot of fun. On the other hand, a very mature industry
(old age) typically has major, established companies that dominate and don’t
really want to see anything change. Here, the only way for an entrepreneur to
enter is by bringing something new to the industry. That’s what happened
when the Internet changed the way many mature industries operate. An indus-
44
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

try in the growth stage of the life cycle means that a business will require a lot
of capital and resources to sustain itself, and it may be a target for acquisition
by a much larger company.
If industries are about value-chain players, markets are about customers. 
If you don’t understand the market you’re going to tap, the customers in it
won’t buy from you. You want to design a product or service that customers
in the market will value. If you make a product or service that you know cus-
tomers want, they’ll have their credit cards ready when you are, which saves
you money on marketing.
The best way to research a market is to get out into it and start talking to
people — particularly customers. Without a doubt, they’ll help you figure out
the best features and benefits for your product or service, and they’ll help
you calculate how much demand exists (one or two customers isn’t enough!).
Chapter 15 has the full scoop on getting to know the customer.
After you define your target customer and your market, you can start identi-
fying potential competitors. Keep in mind that competitors aren’t always
obvious. Look for companies that have the same capabilities and expertise
that your company has. Even if they’re not serving your customers with your
products right now, there’s no reason they couldn’t do so after they see how
successful you are.
Configure the business team
Today it takes a team to start a new company. The business world is just too
complex for any one person to have all the answers. Your team can consist of
 The founders of the company
 Professional advisors
 A board of directors
 Any strategic partners such as manufacturers and distributors (see
Chapter 18)
You need to make sure your team has the expertise and experience needed to
build your business (no, working at Goldman Sachs doesn’t count as entre-
preneurship). Sure, it helps to have someone on the team who has done it
before (even if they failed), but absent that, get an experienced entrepreneur
on your advisory board.
Plan for the product/service
You need to figure out what kinds of supplies and/or raw materials are required
to produce your product/service. And, by the way, are you intending to manu-
facture in-house? Probably not. So now you have to find companies that can 
do your production work for you.
45
Chapter 3: Entrepreneurship for Everyone

That leads to another choice: Do you manufacture domestically or follow the
crowd to India and China (see Chapter 4)? Difficult decisions, but that’s why
you network, right? And that’s why you study your industry — so you can
learn what has worked for other businesses similar to yours.
Calculate how much money you need to start
How much money do you need to pull off your business concept? We hope as
little as possible if you’re thinking like an entrepreneur. What you want to find
out during the feasibility analysis is how much cash you need to launch the
business and operate it until the sales you generate produce a positive cash
flow (you take in more than you spend, in other words). This isn’t as easy as
it sounds, because most entrepreneurs underestimate their expenses and
overestimate their ability to generate sales — not a pretty picture.
Here are some steps for conducting this testing phase of your business:
1. Make a list of everything you’ll need to have in place to start your
business and then attach dollar values to each item.
This is where having an experienced advisor (gained by networking in
the industry) and searching on the Internet comes into play.
2. Forecast sales for the first two years based on market research, on
your understanding of how customers will pay, and from the experi-
ences of similar businesses in your industry.
(You can read more about making forecasts in Chapter 12.)
3. Forecast the expenses required to operate the business.
(Again, Chapter 12 will be a help here.)
4. Create a cash-flow statement that shows all your projected cash
inflows and outflows (just like your checkbook — if you still have
one!), along with the net cash flow for each month.
Run a cumulative net cash flow line below the monthly net cash flow line
so that you can calculate the highest amount of cumulative negative cash
flow that you generate (this can be frightening). Negative cash flow means
that you spent more cash than you took in from customers. It’s pretty
common to experience negative cash flow or loss in the first few months
of a new business. If you then add that highest cumulative negative figure
to the total of your start-up expenses, you’ll get a reasonable estimate of
how much money you need to get your business up and running.
Don’t forget the old mantra “garbage in, garbage out (GIGO)”. The numbers
you use to make your forecasts have to be supported by research. Don’t pull
them out of thin air, or you’ll be headed for some big surprises, and not the
happy kind.

Drawing conclusions
Feasibility analysis is designed to help entrepreneurs make wise decisions and
not reject a concept out of hand without giving it sufficient consideration. With
all your research from the previous sections, review your plan and answer the
following questions:
 Do I really have a business? A product or service alone isn’t a business.
The process of feasibility analysis helps you design a real business to
deliver the benefits of your product or service to customers.
 Does the business satisfy my personal needs and goals? Starting a busi-
ness is a full-time occupation. It requires that you have endurance, be in
good physical and mental condition, and that you’re passionate about
what you’ll do.
But how do you arrive at these decisions? As you go through all the tests in
the feasibility analysis, at each stage along the way you’ll be able to draw a
conclusion about what you’ve discovered and how you feel about it. For exam-
ple, if during the industry analysis you find out that Congress is about to pass
legislation that will make it difficult for you to do business, that in itself should
help you draw a pretty strong conclusion about the feasibility of your busi-
ness. You’d probably stop your research at that point. The same is true about
market research if you find that there aren’t enough potential customers to
make your concept financially feasible. Of course, during the analysis, you
should be consulting with your advisors and people in the industry with
whom you’ll work. They can help you draw the appropriate conclusions.
If you want to dive deeper into the topic of feasibility analysis, you may want 
to consider the following book, which will walk you through feasibility analysis
and the business plan: Launching New Ventures, 5th Edition, by Kathleen Allen
(Houghton Mifflin).
Even with all the planning, 
sometimes businesses fail
You can’t just close your eyes, make a wish, and will your business to succeed.
Sometimes, despite the best efforts of the entrepreneur, a new business fails.
The Small Business Administration reports that two-thirds of new businesses
survive at least two years, so that’s encouraging. At four years, however, the
survival rate is 44 percent — not quite as encouraging, but not as disastrous as
the often-reported “four out of five new businesses fail.” Actually, research has
found that the chances of survival increase with age (the age of the business,
not the entrepreneur).

Chapter 3: Entrepreneurship for Everyone

Corporate Venturing: An Oxymoron?
If you thought you had to quit your corporate job to become an entrepreneur,
wait just a minute. You may not have to. In fact, for some types of ventures —
particularly those that require significant resources to start and distribution
networks to run — it makes sense to launch from inside a corporation. Today,
big companies are finding that they have to be entrepreneurial to survive and
grow in this global marketplace. But entrepreneurship is a whole new world 
for these giants, because they’re not used to the high degree of uncertainty and
risk of failure that accompany new ventures. Big companies have had to come
up with some ways to cope. In the following sections, we talk about those
ways, as well as how you can survive as an entrepreneur in the corporate
world.
Learning from corporate 
entrepreneurship models
Before you decide to go to work for a large corporation, you may want to
check to see if the company has a mechanism for encouraging entrepreneur-
ship. There are a number of ways that big companies facilitate corporate 
venturing. Here are two of them:
 One of the first models for incorporating entrepreneurship into a big com-
pany was the “Skunk Works” model, conceived by the Lockheed-Martin
team that developed the Stealth fighter jet. It describes a team that’s left
alone (hence the word “skunk,” for obvious reasons) and not subjected to
company bureaucracy so it can work on a secret project. Today, it repre-
sents a team that operates outside traditional lines of company authority
and rules so it can benefit from flexibility, speed, and a more creative work
environment. (For more on teams within an organization, see Chapter 9.)
 Another approach is to attempt to encourage entrepreneurship inside
your current organizational structure. As you can imagine, this approach
is difficult at best. A few companies, such as 3M and GE, have been suc-
cessful with letting employees spend a portion of their time on individual
projects that could lead to new ventures. This tactic has some specific
requirements to succeed:
• Commitment at the top to help expedite the venture
• A champion (more than one is best) in the organization who can
beat down doors at the top and shield the entrepreneur from attack
• Access to the knowledge and resources of the entire company
(why reinvent the wheel?)
48
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

• Clearly defined milestones and metrics so that go/no-go decisions
can be made before getting in too deep (see Chapter 9 for more 
on metrics)
Surviving as an entrepreneur 
in a large company
So, you have your cozy corporate job, but you think you’re really an entrepre-
neur at heart. Still, the thought of going out on your own doesn’t excite you;
you’d rather find a way to practice entrepreneurship in a nice, comfortable
environment with plenty of resources at hand. That’s all well and good, but
you have to approach this challenge with a toolkit of tactics to survive. You
may be the pioneer in your company, and the pioneers often are the ones
with the arrows in their backs! (Just ask Apple’s competitors, who often make
it to market before the media giant.)
To help you succeed, here are some arrows to avoid and some tips for how 
to avoid them:
 In a large corporation, the plentiful resources are money, computing
capability, and service providers. The scarce resources are time, talent,
and management attention. Unfortunately, the last three are the most
important. That’s why you need to seek out people in the company who
believe in what you’re trying to do and who are willing to spend the time
to help you. It doesn’t take many people to get a project off the ground,
but it does take a few dedicated people.
 Anything you do will take longer inside a large corporation, because you
have to navigate through the bureaucracy and personal agendas — not an
easy task. Make sure that you find a project champion — someone who’s
regarded highly in the company (in a higher status than you) — who can
protect you from the slings and arrows of people trying to grab resources
for their own projects.
 You get to trade on the reputation and legitimacy of your company 
(we hope it’s a good one), but because your company has a reputation, 
it won’t risk it on an entrepreneurial venture with a high risk of failure. 
Be careful about what you choose to develop. Here’s where a feasibility
analysis comes in handy. It will help you reduce the risk to a manageable
level and increase your chances of getting the project approved.
 If you’re a success, you’ll get no equity, no wealth creation, and some-
times no credit. Most likely, your company will thank you and then take
credit for your new venture. However, many corporate venturers with
successful track records inside large companies have eventually left to
start their own businesses on the outside, often with their former 
companies as customers.
49
Chapter 3: Entrepreneurship for Everyone

 If you fail, you’ll get all the credit, and it may ruin your career at the
company — especially if it’s a high-profile failure. That’s why you need
to do some homework on the company you plan to join.

W
hether your company is a small retailer in a shopping center in 
Des Moines, Iowa, or a large plastics manufacturer in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, the global marketplace affects you. There’s hardly a place left 
to hide from it anymore; but, then, why would you want to? In countries from
Kenya to South Korea, people around the world may want your products and
services. In years past, going global meant a huge outlay of capital to fund facil-
ities and hire people, but today, going global can be as easy as turning on your
computer and opening your Internet browser. This chapter explains how your
organization can go global, including how to begin, what it takes, and how to
get some help.
Going Global Is No Longer a Choice
In the past, companies may have struggled with the issue of whether or not to
conduct business on an international scale. However, the decision is no longer
a struggle because it has already been made for them. Even if you don’t want
to do business on a global level, international companies will do business with
you, compete with you, or even put you out of business. Therefore, you need to
think global. Want to know how easy it is? The minute you put your business
on the Internet, you’re a global entrepreneur, because anyone, anywhere can
find you. And this is a good thing. This section shows you how by taking a
closer look at conducting business in the global marketplace.

52
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 
Understanding the appeal of being global
Increasing competition in domestic markets and saturated markets in 
some industries are prompting business owners to examine the international
marketplace, where demand is great for U.S.-made products and where, in
some parts of the world, money isn’t an issue. In the international market-
place, many businesses have found new markets for their products, partners
for their businesses, and complementary products that help increase their
sales in their local markets.
The global market should be attractive to your business for several reasons:
 It enables you to build a broader customer base, which can minimize the
impact of economic problems at home.
 You may be able to reduce the effects of seasonal market swings.
Remember, countries south of the equator are in opposite seasons from
the United States.
 If you have excess capacity in your manufacturing facility, you may 
be able to put it to use by finding more products to produce for global
markets.
 You may find new life for a product that’s losing ground in the U.S. market.
 You may be able to lower your production costs by manufacturing in a
country with lower labor rates or reduce your supply costs by purchasing
overseas.
Whether you’re encouraged by one or all of these factors, you need to think
about ways to go global.
There are also risks associated with going global. If finding customers and
establishing a distribution network are challenging tasks in your domestic
market, the tasks may be almost insurmountable in foreign markets. Even
money can be a problem (and you thought money was simply a good thing!).
Financing can be difficult in global markets, as one business owner found out
when he shipped a $10,000 unit to a customer in France and later was billed
$2,500 for value-added tax. He knew nothing about this tax, but he still had to
take the loss. Just another example of why it’s important to do your homework.
Determining whether your business 
has what it takes to go global
If you want to find new markets for your business, consider this: Not all 
businesses are suitable for global markets. For example, Uncle Bob’s Shoe
Repair or a local tax preparer service probably won’t find eager markets in
other countries. (Interestingly enough, many larger tax preparers are farming

out the preparation part of their businesses to India and doing the advising
and strategizing in-house.) But most types of businesses can find customers
and partners in other parts of the world.
As in any marketplace, you must offer a high-quality product or service at a
competitive price to go global. Beyond that, researchers have found that most
successful global businesses have some common characteristics:
 They have a strong global vision. In other words, their strategic plans
consider the influence of, effects of, and opportunities found in the 
international market.
 Their management teams have some international experience.
Becoming familiar with the international market isn’t as difficult as it
sounds; in fact, gaining an understanding of other countries and how
they do business is easier than ever. Today, some universities require
their MBA candidates to spend some time in other countries to learn 
the way business is done abroad.
 They’ve developed strong international networks of people and 
businesses that can help them. One of the cardinal rules of going global 
is to find partners in the country in which you want to do business. These
companies know how things really work and can save you a lot of time
and effort, not to mention money.
 They offer unique technology or know-how that another country 
doesn’t have. The United States used to ship all its outdated technology
to other countries further down the technology ladder. With the Internet,
television, and films, no matter where you live in the world, chances are
you’ve seen what technology is available; find out where in the world
your offerings would be most desirable.
Figuring out when to go global
There is no right or wrong time to make the decision to go global. However,
some times are better than others. If your business is new and you foresee
that about 25 percent or more of your sales will come from the international
market, you may have a special type of business that’s referred to as “born
global.” This business’s competitive advantage lies in outsourcing and selling
in several countries.
Whatever you plan to offer, it must be something that you can modify to meet
the needs of the customers where you do business. For example, if you’re intro-
ducing a new product that has never been in the market before, you may want
to start domestically first to establish yourself. That way, your systems and
controls can be in place for awhile, and you may have fewer problems when
you expand to another country. Most U.S.-made products need adjustments
and some redesign to be compatible with the electrical systems or to meet the
regulations of other countries — not to mention the need to fit into other 
53
Chapter 4: Global Business: Fun and Profit in Katmandu

cultures. Hey, if you live in Rapid City, South Dakota, it will take a long time to
get to Australia to solve a problem with your product! Of course, travel time is
another good reason to have a partner in the country you select.
Spinning the Globe: Where to Begin?
With all the countries in the world, how do you know which one is best for
your products or services? Actually, researching and choosing really aren’t 
as difficult as you may think. When doing research on conducting business 
in a foreign country, you basically want to know four things:
 Who will use the product?
 How do the country’s consumers define value?
 How will you know when a change in the market is about to occur?
 How can you increase your market share?
The following sections take you on a quick tour around the world so you can
get an idea of what it’s like to do business in China, India, the European Union,
and Mexico. Are you ready to travel?
China: Possible, but not always easy
In December 2001, China became part of the World Trade Organization, which
deals with governing trade rules between nations. This opened huge new
markets and propelled the country to 9 percent average annual growth from
that point forward.
U.S. companies, seeing dollar signs everywhere, could hardly wait to invest
billions in China to see even more returned to them in the form of revenues.
These multinationals presumed that they held the advantage in technology
innovation and were more experienced in marketing and brand building than
Chinese companies. They also figured that China had a long way to go before
it would be competitive on the world stage. Boy, were they wrong!
The difficulties of doing business in China
Here are some of the problems these companies, and others that choose 
to do business in China, faced (or are facing):
 China’s infrastructure is still in its early stages, so oftentimes global
companies can’t take advantage of their sophisticated marketing skills.
For example, securing in-depth market research is very challenging
because there are so few local market research firms that even know
how to perform this function.
54
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

 Logistics and distribution are relatively new ideas in China, so it can 
be difficult to find a national distributor or a competent supplier.
 Multinational companies must use international corporate standards
that often place them in disadvantageous positions relative to local 
companies, which must follow only local customs.
 Any economies of scale that a company has in its domestic market 
often are lost in the face of local trade barriers across provinces and
protectionism for local products.
 Companies often look at the Chinese market as a whole, but the reality 
is this: The sophisticated consumers they find in Beijing and Shanghai
are only a relatively small portion of the more than one billion potential
consumers who can afford only what they absolutely need to survive.
Making a mistake while doing business in China can be devastating to your
company. News of a mistake travels like wildfire, and consumers can be unfor-
giving when the companies they admire let them down. Fast-food pioneer
McDonald’s, for example, made a colossal mistake when it produced a 
commercial showing a Chinese man on his knees begging a salesperson to
give him a discount. The Chinese found this ad extremely offensive, and
55

Using the Web to find the right country
A number of resources can make your seemingly
daunting task of choosing a country much easier. For
example, start with the United Nations Statistics
Division, which is available online at unstats.un.
org/unsd/trade. This site contains the SITC
(Standard Industrial Trade Classification) codes
established by the United Nations, which enable you
to find information on demand for a specific product
or service in the particular country in which you have
an interest. You also should go to the site of the North
American Industry Classification System (NAICS) at
www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html.
Its coding system has replaced the Standard
Industrial Classification (SIC) system and provides
business statistics about North American industries.
(For other resources to help you find the right country
for your products, see the section “Knowing Where to
Go for Help” later in this chapter.)
NAICS and SITC codes are the keys to a wealth
of information. You can calculate the demand for
your product by looking at the following:
 The value of worldwide imports of the product
measured in dollars.
 Import records over time, which show the
amount of growth a particular product has 
experienced or the level of imports to a 
specific country over time. You’re looking for
countries where import demand is greater than
worldwide averages. Such a statistic means that
a country is probably more likely to purchase
your product.
 The amount of U.S. imports to a country. You’re
looking for a country where U.S. imports
exceed 5 percent of its total imports — the
higher, the better. If the number is lower than 
5 percent, it may signal that tariffs are affecting
the country’s ability to import from the United
States.

Mickey Ds had to remove it. Although McDonald’s was eventually forgiven 
its mistake, the Chinese are watching the business closely to make sure it
doesn’t make similar mistakes again.
Breaking through the business barriers
Several strategies seem to have worked for companies going into China. 
After five years of research, Peter Williamson and Ming Zeng — researchers
at INSEAD in Singapore — now endorse some strategies that can improve
your company’s chances of succeeding in China:
 Keep prices low. Most unsuccessful companies entered the market at the
high end of the price scale, which is a very small portion of the market,
existent only in the major cities.
 Work hard to get your costs down. You want to be able to compete
more effectively with local companies.
 Get closer to the customer. Using distribution channels with a lot of
intermediaries just doesn’t work well in China.
 Do more of your research and development in China. You want to 
be as close to your customers as possible so you can better meet their
needs and get to market quicker.
In addition to Williamson and Zeng’s suggestions, you may want to consider
doing the following things:
 Find a local partner. Doing so makes it easier for your company to 
be accepted in the market, and you can figure out the local ways of 
doing business much more quickly. For example, Procter & Gamble sells
its own brands of shampoo as well as the Chinese brand Jiejua through its
Chinese partners, Hutchinson China Trade Company and the Guangzhous
government’s Construction Import & Export Corporation.
 Sell direct to the customer. One of the most successful U.S. companies
to try this strategy is Avon, the cosmetics company. Avon executives
understood that if they went through the normal Chinese distribution
channels, the price of the company’s products would skyrocket beyond
the buying power of the target audience. So, the company decided to go
where its customers were. They went to the factories where the women
worked and sold directly to them. We should also mention that Avon,
too, found a local partner to help it through the red tape.
 Beat the Chinese to the market. If you can get your product into China
before the Chinese introduce a similar product, you have a great chance
of success. Because the Chinese have an aversion to uncertainty, they
generally seek out Chinese products first, which makes getting a foot in
the door very difficult for foreign companies.

India: Outsourcing heaven
India is home to one of the oldest civilizations in the world, dating back 
5,000 years. It’s also the world’s largest democracy, with more than one billion
people (and the world’s second most populous country). It has become a pop-
ular choice for companies seeking outsourced skilled workers in telecommuni-
cations (call center support) and information systems (IT support). And the
country is known for its expertise in hospitality, airlines, and retail.
Many multinational companies have benefited enormously from offshoring
some of their processes to India (see Chapter 2 for more on offshoring). 
For example, GE saves about $350 million annually by sending around 900
processes to India. India’s niche — and what differentiates it from China — is
its focus on knowledge services that require skills, judgment, and discretion.
Some of these knowledge services include
 Tax preparation
 Computer programming
 Market research
 Patent writing
India has moved up the value chain and left the low-paying, routine-type jobs
to other countries. Is this bad news for U.S. companies? Not really. Most com-
panies that utilize Indian resources are seeing huge productivity improve-
ments, which enable them to do more business efficiently and effectively.

organization on a global level, check out Doing Business in India For Dummies,

The European Union: Finding 
common selling ground
Europe is a difficult region to do business in, because there’s no such thing 
as a European culture. Enormous differences exist among the countries in 
the European Union (EU). The simplistic approach to understanding these
differences is recognizing what marketers often call the contrast between 
the “spaghetti culture” of the south and the “potato culture” of the north.
These labels refer to the propensity of Italians to prefer pasta and northern
European countries, such as Ireland, to prefer potatoes. But, of course, that
contrast leaves out the middle. Where do you put France?
Marketers have found that where cultural variances are small, products move
freely back and forth across borders. Such is the case in the Scandinavian
57
Chapter 4: Global Business: Fun and Profit in Katmandu

countries. But where cultural differences are huge — between France and
Germany, for instance — products that do well in one country may not do
well in the other.
We bet you didn’t know that countries have genders — at least when it comes
to their advertising orientation. This is one way marketing people classify the
variations in European markets. Some countries, such as Austria and Italy, are
considered to be more masculine countries, because their people tend to be
attracted to advertisements for products that are more assertive and achieve-
ment-oriented. Other countries, such as The Netherlands and Denmark, are
considered more feminine in their orientation, because advertisements that
show concern for the environment or that champion the underdog often 
do well.
One trick to successfully market your products in Europe is to find cross-
cultural clusters, such as age. Children have commonalities across all cultures,
so you can design and provide products that touch those commonalities. 
By the same token, however, don’t assume that you can judge European chil-
dren by looking at U.S. children. European children, for example, tend to play
more with educational toys, whereas U.S. children prefer action toys. Young,
European professionals, however, are more likely to adopt U.S. products along
with the more traditional European products.
One problem you don’t have to worry about as much anymore? Money. The
introduction of the Euro makes the problem of currency exchange much easier
for most businesses. You have a bit more control over prices and profits if one
medium of exchange is common for most European countries.
Mexico: Doing business with a neighbor
The first thing to understand about Mexico is the distinction between the
classes:
 Seventy percent of the Mexican population lives in poverty.
 One percent is very wealthy.
 Seven percent are middle class.
 Twelve percent are lower-middle class.
This economic situation presents a unique challenge to anyone trying to sell
products in Mexico. In addition, Mexico is a large country with diverse con-
sumer tastes, ranging from very traditionally Mexican to more U.S./Canadian.
Here are a few examples:
 In the far south, home to the Mayan tribes, the culture is more like that
of Central America, which is very tribal in nature and somewhat volatile
in terms of its governments. This group is a very difficult nut to crack
58
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

because it typically doesn’t have a need for most U.S. products. It will
take a significant amount of research to penetrate this group.
 In the central part of Mexico, the people hold their traditions dear, but
there seems to be pent-up demand for more modern products. This is 
a good target for most U.S. products.
 The northern part of Mexico is heavily influenced by the United States
and, therefore, is more accepting of U.S. products. This area is probably
the best for entry into the Mexican market.
In general, the Mexican people are a very proud people who don’t like talking
about themselves. This cultural factor can make it difficult for companies to
do market research. Moreover, linguistic barriers may be difficult to over-
come. For example, many U.S. business phrases, such as “shelf space” or
“mass customization,” don’t translate easily into Spanish, so you may want to
work with a native speaker to find the appropriate phrases to describe what
you’re trying to say.
Mexicans often are very family oriented; consequently, when presenting the
benefits of your product, you may want to show consumers how it will help
their families. (Some say that this is a refreshing change from the “what’s in 
it for me” attitude in the U.S. consumer market.)
Understanding the Role of Foreign Agents
and Other International Types
You may think that foreign agents are found only in Tom Clancy novels, and
that they work for the CIA or some foreign government. But in the business
world, foreign agents aren’t nearly so glamorous; they are, in fact, the work-
horses who help make your life easier when you sell products/services in
another country.
Every country in the world has a bevy of agents, trading companies, and
sales representatives who specialize in importing U.S. goods. You need to be
aware of the differences among the three:
 Agents purchase your company’s products at a large discount off list
price and then sell them in their countries and take responsibility for 
collections. This takes a huge load off your company’s back, because any
dealings with foreign countries tend to be costly and time-consuming.
You must realize, though, that when you sell to an agent, you lose control
of what happens with your product after the sale. If an agent marks up
the price too high to make some extra money, you may lose customers.

Chapter 4: Global Business: Fun and Profit in Katmandu

 Export trading companies (ETCs) typically specialize in a certain coun-
try or region and maintain a large force of sales representatives. Some
ETCs even specialize in particular products. Here’s how it works: The
sales reps report back to the ETC that a country needs a specific prod-
uct. The ETC then locates a manufacturer, buys the product, and sells it
to the foreign country. Trading companies are the most common way
that people export to Japan, for instance.
 Sales representatives work on commission and don’t buy or warehouse
your products. Typically, they find outlets for the sale of your products
by operating as independent reps or as reps for export trading compa-
nies. The advantage of using reps is that they usually require little or no
sales training. Moreover, because they know the country in which they
deal, they aren’t as likely to make cultural faux pas, which can be deadly
to your business.
If your company is small and can’t afford the services of a foreign agent (or if
no agent is available in the area you’re considering), you can place an ad in
U.S. trade journals that showcase U.S. products internationally. Foreign com-
panies may then contact you about distributing your product in their coun-
tries. Agents are one type of intermediary, but there are others and we
discuss them in the next section.
Choosing your intermediary
We can’t stress enough the importance of doing your homework before select-
ing an intermediary (an agent, rep, distributor, or export trading company) to
represent your company in a foreign country. Remember, this person/organi-
zation is speaking for you and can affect the future of your company. Here are
some good homework tips:
 Find a good intermediary who is a referral from a satisfied customer.
Talk to business owners who are doing business in the countries you’re
interested in to see whom they’re using. A name that comes up frequently
may be a good lead. Asking your customers, on the other hand, may not
be such a good idea because they probably don’t want you to use an 
intermediary; it will cost them more!
 Check with the Department of Commerce at 800-USA-TRADE.
Employees can’t officially recommend individuals, but they can give you
a list of qualified intermediaries in your industry.
 Go to trade shows. For some trade shows, the Department of Commerce
sets up a booth for U.S. companies at a very low rate. You can gain access
to top agents who exhibit there. You can also watch how the agents deal
with potential customers.
60
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

Of course, you may want to draw up a contract with a seemingly qualified inter-
mediary right away, but don’t be eager to sign just yet. Here are a few more
things you need to do before settling on a person who seems to check out:
 Ask for a current listing of the products that the intermediary carries to
make sure your products are compatible and fit within the intermediary’s
expertise.
 Check to see whether the intermediary also handles your competitors’
products. (Do you really want that situation?)
 Make sure that the intermediary has enough sales reps to cover the area
in the country in which you want to do business.
 Check out the intermediary’s sales volume to make certain that the
number is showing a consistent level of growth over time.
 Find out whether the intermediary has enough warehouse space, as well
as an up-to-date communication system.
 Look at his/her marketing plan to discover how the intermediary plans
to promote your products.
 Check to see whether the intermediary has the ability to handle the 
servicing of your products. If not, you need to plan for another solution.
When working with an export trading company, try to find one that wants 
to partner with you — in other words, it will work with you to grow the 
international markets that you’re interested in.
Putting your agreement in writing
We don’t know how many times we’ve advised people to put agreements in
writing. Taking this precaution doesn’t mean that you’re superstitious, nega-
tive, or certain that things are going to go badly. It means that you recognize
that things happen, and you want to have a mechanism in place to take care
of them when they do. Your agreement with a foreign agent or intermediary
needs to spell out the terms and conditions of the arrangement, and you
need to consult with an attorney who specializes in overseas contracts,
which are different from domestic agreements in many regards.
One of the most important clauses in a foreign agent agreement is the perfor-
mance clause. Let us warn you that most intermediaries boldly ask for an
exclusive five- to ten-year contract. You need to stand firm for a one- or two-
year contract based on performance. After all, do you want to tie up your 
distribution capability in a foreign country if your intermediary there isn’t
selling enough products to make the arrangement worthwhile?
61
Chapter 4: Global Business: Fun and Profit in Katmandu

With the help of an attorney, here are some other recommended clauses you
want in any foreign agent agreement to protect your business and to make
sure that you’re getting what you expect:
 Aim for a nonexclusive contract that allows you to use other distribu-
tors as well. This option gives you flexibility and more control over the
situation.
 Identify the specific products that the intermediary may handle.
Don’t give a blanket agreement for all your products now and in the
future! You may develop new products that you don’t want this particular
intermediary to handle. Protect your ability to withhold your property.
 Define the territories for which the intermediary is responsible. You
want to eliminate confusion when you add other intermediaries.
 Spell out the specific duties and responsibilities. This should be done
for both the intermediary and your company so you can manage 
expectations and avoid conflicts.
 Include a statement of your agreed-upon sales quotas and performance
expectations. In other words, spell out what sales level the intermediary
needs to reach by a certain date. Quotas and performance dates are nego-
tiable; the more valuable your product is to the intermediary, the more
clout you have in determining those figures.
 Make sure that your home base is the jurisdiction in the agreement. All
agreements should have a statement regarding the jurisdiction for any dis-
putes that may occur. You don’t want to have to fly off to a foreign country
to settle a dispute.
Avoid headaches: Using 
a freight forwarder
Although you can survive without a freight forwarder when doing business
on a global stage, using one can definitely lessen your stress level. Freight 
forwarders are worth their weight in gold; their job is to handle all aspects of
delivering your product to the customer. The following outlines exactly what
a freight forwarder does:
 Transportation: Freight forwarders move product from the producer 
to the customer on land or over sea.
 Documentation: This task is the real headache. Shipping documents
include a bill of lading, which is the contract between the shipper and
the carrier, and an exporter declaration form, which details the contents
of the shipment. These documents must be correct down to the last
letter and point of punctuation; if not, your shipment may be delayed, 
or, worse, your order may be cancelled.
62
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

 Collection: The freight forwarder presents the shipping documents to
your company’s bank for collection. If you’re shipping hazardous materi-
als or certain food substances, for example, you’re responsible for getting
any licenses or certificates you may need and providing them to the
freight forwarder.
The method you use to ship your product — land, air, sea — determines the
product’s cost in a foreign country. If you want to ship by container on ships,
you should fill a container to reduce your costs. If you aren’t shipping enough
units to fill an entire container, you may be able to find someone else who’s
shipping to the same location who can share a container with you. Just make
sure that your documentation is correct. Sometimes the freight forwarder
can help you with this task. Otherwise, you’ll need to find another company
that is shipping to your destination so you can share a container.
Considering the Price of Global Growth
Many businesspeople mistakenly think that if you get a large order from a for-
eign source, banks will be clamoring to give you money so you can buy the raw
materials you need to fill the order. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Export lenders, just as with other lenders, want to know that you have the
resources to fill the orders.
Now, if you secure a guarantee of payment from a governmental agency such
as the Export-Import Bank of the United States, you limit the risk to the bank
itself, and the bank’s representatives are more likely to lend to you. Another
alternative, if you can do it, is to ask the foreign buyer to pay an upfront
deposit — enough to pay for the raw materials. Other strategies for financing
global growth include obtaining private-investor capital, venture capital, and
internal cash flow from your business.
The bottom line: To grow globally, you need the finances to back your busi-
ness. This section looks at the most important document you need and what
to do when you’re ready to make a sale.
Getting a letter of credit
One of the most important documents in a global transaction is the letter of
credit (LC). This bank document is a guarantee that a customer’s bank drafts
(checks), up to a specified amount, are good for a specific period of time. The
foreign buyer usually places the letter of credit in an escrow-type account, and
the escrow company releases the money to your company at the same time
the goods are released to the foreign buyer.
63
Chapter 4: Global Business: Fun and Profit in Katmandu

The letter of credit is another case where accuracy counts. Many things can
invalidate a letter of credit, including the following:
 Your company fails to meet the ship date.
 Any typos, errors, or differences between the shipping documents (see
the earlier section “Avoid headaches: Using a freight forwarder”) and 
the letter of credit can invalidate the contract. Make sure that you have
a clean airway bill or ocean bill of lading, in which the wording and
spelling are exactly as they appear on the LC.
 Any variances in weight and size can invalidate the contract.
To prevent any LC disasters, create the details of the LC so that it protects
you. If you control the wording of the LC, you can state that the goods
become the customer’s responsibility when the goods are in the customer’s
warehouse. But what happens if the ship hits a bad storm on the way and
sinks or is raided by pirates (not too common, but not unheard of)? Then you
become responsible for the loss. Or what if the customs official doesn’t
release the goods when they arrive without an under-the-table payment (oth-
erwise known as a bribe)? Who takes care of that little problem if you let the
customer determine where it will accept the shipment? The best way to pro-
tect your business is to make your shipment to the customer FOB factory
(freight on board). That way, the customer is legally responsible for the
goods from the moment they leave your factory.
Here are some additional tips to make financing your exporting life easier:
 Use your bank as the escrow holder and adviser to the transaction so that
you can feel more confident that things will go smoothly.
 Put an at-sight clause in the LC. This clause ensures that when the docu-
ments listed in the LC are presented to the advising bank (your bank),
you get paid within five days.
 Make absolutely certain that you can meet any shipping date you put on
the LC. That means being sure that nothing can delay production. Give
yourself some leeway. Remember Murphy’s Law: If anything can go
wrong, it will!
 Place the internal bank reference number on all documents to avoid
having them rejected.
 Be sure that the expiration date for the LC is at least one month after the
ship date. You want to give yourself enough time to get all the documents
together and present them to the bank.
 Don’t put minute details on the LC; doing so increases your chance of
error. Details can go on packing lists, invoices, and purchase orders.
 Don’t allow for transshipments, which means taking goods from one air-
craft or vessel and placing them on another. For example, suppose that
your customer’s site is in the middle of the Moroccan desert. Don’t take
64
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

responsibility for having the cargo off-loaded and then placed on camels
for the final journey to your customer’s site. You run a huge risk of
damage or loss.
 Allow for partial shipments — which means that you don’t ship the entire
order at one time — because this allowance can speed up payments and
help your cash flow.
When it’s time to make a sale
Picture this: You’ve just introduced a new product that you spent four long
years developing, patenting, and manufacturing. It’s now ready for introduc-
tion into the domestic market. You get your first units into the market and all
of a sudden, people are offering to represent you in other countries, with big
purchase orders in hand. It’s very enticing to just grab them and run.
But before you start planning where you’ll spend all your new-found money,
you better find out a few things about your foreign buyer. For instance, you
need to understand the country’s payment patterns and whether it has any
creditor protection laws. You also need to investigate your customer’s credit
history. Providing a big purchase order is easy; making good on that order 
is another thing entirely. If you extend credit to a company in another coun-
try, you are, for all intents and purposes, extending it to the country. Make
sure that the country you pick is relatively stable and friendly to foreign 
companies. You can check out your potential foreign customer through your
international bank, accounting firm, or most major credit reporting services.
Knowing Where to Go for Help
Taking your company into global markets can be an exhilarating time if you
do your research first and build a global resource network that includes
many resources for help:
 The U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. Chambers of Commerce 
(if your company is a U.S. corporation)
 An international law firm
 A big four or equivalent accounting firm
 A large institutional investment bank
 An international representative
Smart businesspeople understand that you can’t simply arrive in a country
and immediately do business. It takes time to build the trusting relationships
that eventually lead to sales.
65
Chapter 4: Global Business: Fun and Profit in Katmandu

Fortunately, for those of you in the United States, you’re not alone in your
efforts to begin dealing in the global market. You have many resources available
to turn to in times of need. This section outlines a few of your other options.
For our readers in Canada, Mexico, Great Britain, France, Germany, Japan,
China, and elsewhere, although you can’t directly take advantage of the many
international trade services sponsored by the U.S. government, your country
has its own program that works in much the same way. Use the Internet, ask
around, check with your government ministries, and find out what’s available
to you. You may be pleasantly surprised!
Hitting the road: Trade shows 
and trade missions
Trade shows often are mistakenly thought of as places to make sales. Although
that does happen, it probably won’t happen for a new company at a show. It’s
better to think of trade shows as places to get leads and to do research on the
industry and your competitors. You also can find foreign agents there to repre-
sent you in another country (see the earlier section “Understanding the Role of
Foreign Agents and Other International Types”).
Attending a trade show in another country is a lot more complicated than
attending one in the United States, however. Be sure to remember the following
tips to make the experience go more smoothly:
 Make sure you bring copies of all the documents you received from 
the organizer of the trade show. That way, when your booth space isn’t
where you thought it was, you can prove you reserved and paid for it.
 You want to carry a detailed customs document, called a carnet, which
lists all the valuables you take out of the United States. This document
prevents you from running into problems with foreign customs agents
who may think you purchased items in their country.
 Bring less of your product and more of your brochures because people
in most other countries don’t buy on impulse. They like to take a
brochure and think about it for a while.
 Rent any presentation equipment you need instead of carting it all the way
from the United States and enduring the customs inspections. Renting
equipment also means that you don’t have to worry about the different
voltages and electrical plug configurations overseas.

Going on a trade mission has been a successful way for some companies to
crack new markets. Trade missions, offered by the Department of Commerce
and some private agencies, are designed to give businesses an opportunity 
to make contacts in foreign countries. A trade mission consists of an intense
round of interviews and discussions in a number of cities during a period of
about two to three weeks. Business owners get training prior to going and 
are matched with appropriate agents, distributors, or partners in the regions
where they’re going. To be selected for a trade mission, you need to produce
a product that’s on the “best prospect” list for a particular region. A trade
mission costs between $500 and $4,000, depending on where you go.
You can find out more about trade missions by calling 800-USA-TRADE.
Calling on Uncle Sam
If you’ve never heard of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation 
(OPIC), you probably haven’t been missing anything, because the OPIC is
mostly known as the federal agency that provides political risk insurance for
giant multinational companies investing in developing and emerging countries.
But recently, the OPIC has recognized that disappearing global barriers are cre-
ating opportunities for smaller companies as well. Because small companies
also are concerned about political risks and securing resources to go global,
the OPIC has decided to reach out to businesses with annual revenues less
than $250 million. It has done so by lowering its minimum loan guarantees to
$100,000 and providing direct loans and loan guarantees up to $250 million.
The OPIC also has its own version of a micro-loan program for businesses 
with revenues less than $35 million, allowing them to borrow up to $10 million.
You can find out more about the OPIC at www.opic.gov/smallbusiness.
Uncle Sam also offers the Commercial Service of the U.S. Department of
Commerce, which is the trade-promotion unit of the International Trade
Administration. With the help of this service, you can find trade specialists 
in 107 U.S. cities and more than 80 countries around the world, designed to
help you secure sales in global markets. These specialists provide resources
for market research, counseling, seminars, reports on foreign firms, and 
contact services. You can discover more about this service at
www.ita.doc.gov/cs.

In This Chapter
 Distinguishing between strategy, tactics, and operations

 Avoiding redesign by strategizing properly
 Employing strategical improvisation
 Focusing on your company’s SWOTs
 Determining if your strategy is succeeding
F
or decades, executives of large companies have met in back rooms or in
expensive resort retreats to strategize about the future of their companies.
Although the strategies they devised often were very creative and visionary, the
executives rarely considered the fact that the environments on which they
based their strategies might change completely within a year or more. All it
would take is for a company working in stealth mode to emerge with a new
product — a product that made theirs obsolete, changing the whole ballgame
instantly. Look at how Apple changed the digital music landscape overnight
with the iPod, which overcame the mistakes made by industry pioneers Eiger
Labs and Rio who didn’t see this strategy coming.
So, what exactly does “strategy” mean for today’s organization? A strategy is a
plan of action that’s mid- to long-term in duration and is designed to help
your company achieve its broad mission. So, if your company’s mission is to
be number one in its market by 2010, the strategies you develop should form
a plan of action for getting the company to that position.
However, the global business landscape isn’t static; rather, it’s in a constant
state of change, so strategies must reflect the very real possibility that they’ll
need to be modified in the future.
Good strategic plans involve those individuals who are close to the market
and deeply involved in the operations of the business. They include a 

70
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 
cross-section of stakeholders in the organization — everyone from the cus-
tomer to the worker on the factory floor. Strategic planners must be able to
address long-term and short-term issues that face the organization. Although
it may seem like a lot to think about, there is no need to worry. In this chap-
ter, we look at the nature of strategic planning in a world that waits for no one
and prepare you to do it effectively.
Comparing Strategy and Tactics
A strategy is a plan for achieving a major organizational objective. Objectives
are important for a number of reasons:
 They give everyone a set of guidelines and a focus.
 They help motivate everyone to achieve.
 They provide a basis for measuring achievement.
Tactics, on the other hand, are the methods for carrying out the strategy.
Marketing guru Seth Godin uses a skiing analogy to explain the difference. He
says that negotiating turns on a ski slope requires great tactical skills that
must be executed perfectly. But choosing the right place to ski is strategy. He
claims that everyone skis better in Utah! Basically, the strategy sets you up
so you can perform the tactics flawlessly, all conditions being perfect (which
they never are).
The boundary between top management and middle management, and who
does strategy and who does tactics, is quickly eroding in today’s dynamic
and complex marketplace. Today, strategy has seeped down into the lowest
levels of management in the organization; at the same time, a CEO who does-
n’t understand tactics can’t ensure that strategies are properly executed. The
following sections take a more in-depth look at the various categories of orga-
nizational goals and the strategic planning process.
Strategic goals
Strategic goals generally are developed by top management and focus on
broad issues that affect the company overall. Some examples of strategic
goals are
 Growth
 Raising capital
 Reducing employee turnover
 New product development

But more and more, the responsibility for designing and implementing strategic
goals is being shared with lower-level management and operations people — in
other words, people closest to the market. In a time when global market condi-
tions fluctuate rapidly (see Chapter 4), it’s a very dangerous practice to rely on
strategic plans and goals developed solely in the ivory towers of upper man-
agement, far removed from the street.
For example, product planners often have difficulty forecasting demand so
that they can order the correct amount of raw material and schedule produc-
tion efficiently (see Chapter 18). Some companies have formed departments
of analysts to crank out copious volumes of numbers in an effort to correctly
forecast needs. But the only thing you can ever be certain of is that the fore-
casts will always be off. Consequently, many companies are, for the most
part, overstocked with costly inventory. Today, smart companies are
approaching this problem not with forecasting tools, but with a strategy
focused on more efficient and faster production times. They respond to
actual market demand with rapid production. They order raw materials as
needed and produce products as needed. So, strategic planning for produc-
tion is now done on the factory floor rather than in the executive penthouse.
Tactical goals
Tactical goals generally are developed by middle managers or those directly
responsible for executing a strategy. The purpose of tactical goals is to work
out ways to make strategies happen. You can see some examples of tactical
goals and their related strategies in Table 5-1.
Table 5-1

25% year over year growth

new customer segment.

The metaphor most commonly used to describe tactics is that tactics are to
the battle what strategy is to the war. Strategy is the big picture, and tactics
are the steps taken to achieve the strategy. Where strategy generally is con-
cerned with resources, market environment, and the mission of the company,
71
Chapter 5: Polish Your Crystal Ball for Some Strategic Planning

tactics usually deal more with people and actions. In essence, tactics are
about execution. To effectively execute a tactical plan requires that you take
the following actions:
 Look at all the possible alternatives before proceeding.
 Give all those involved in executing the tactical plan the resources and
the level of authority they need to do their part.
 Make sure that effective modes of communication are in place to mini-
mize conflict or overlap of activities.
 Continuously monitor progress to ensure that you’re on target.
Operational goals
Line managers — those who deal directly with the product — typically create
operational goals, which are usually very narrow in focus and can be accom-
plished relatively quickly. Operational goals and plans come in many forms.
Want to see them all at a glance? Look at Table 5-2 for an overview of
common operational plans.
Table 5-2
Common Operational Plans
Type of Plan
How It’s Used
One-time plans
Used to carry out an action that is not expected to
be repeated.
Programs
Contains a large number of activities, such as a set 
of procedures for hiring and retaining technical
employees.
Projects
Usually smaller and less complex than a program.
For example, a project can be the development of an
employee manual.
Standing plans
Used to manage activities that occur regularly
during a longer period of time.
Policies
Guidelines for how the organization will respond in
any particular situation, including any exceptions to
typical responses. For example, a policy may state
that technical employees must have a college
education.
72
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

Type of Plan
How It’s Used
Standard operating 
Describes the steps that employees must follow 
procedures (SOPs)
in a particular situation. For example, an HR man-
ager may 1) check an applicant’s résumé for the
requisite college education; 2) call the college to
verify the information; and 3) mark in the file that the
candidate has met that requirement.
Rules and regulations
Takes the decision making out of the planning and
execution process by stating emphatically what
must be done. For example, a rule may state that the
HR manager can override the requirement that
applicants have a college education if the manager
secures the signature of the Chief Operating Officer.
There is no decision-making power in this directive.
Contingency plans
Takes into consideration what the company should
do if the original plans can’t be realized due to some
unforeseen change in the environment. Contingency
plans generally answer “what-if” questions.
Scanning the New Business Horizon
Don’t make the mistake of thinking that strategic planning takes place only
inside the organization — preferably behind closed doors, in rooms with
plenty of coffee, bagels, charts, spirited banter, and brainstorming. That’s
only one way that strategic planning takes place, and it may not even be the
most important way, as this chapter explains. A whole host of external envi-
ronmental factors have a major impact on the planning you do for your busi-
ness. This section takes a look at three of the most important factors:
customers, dynamic markets, and competition.
Do you really know your customers?
One of the themes of this book is the importance of knowing your customers
and involving them in your business. Today, customers are jaded by a selection
of products and services that overwhelm them with choices. In some markets,
customers no longer rush to buy things on sale, because a sale is always going
on somewhere. Because customers have so many choices, they’re more
demanding. Levels of quality that were considered “above and beyond” only a
short time ago are now considered minimum quality standards. You now have
to go way beyond those old standards to grab your customers’ attention.
73
Chapter 5: Polish Your Crystal Ball for Some Strategic Planning

Brand loyalty is declining, so businesses have to work much harder to keep
their customers. Keeping customers is paramount, because a customer
becomes more valuable over time from repeat purchases and referrals.
Therefore, the solution to planning in this new, very complex marketplace lies in
building long-term customer relationships built on trust. And you can’t gain
the trust of your customers if you don’t interact with them. (For some important
tips on building long-term customer relationships, check out Chapter 15.)
Riding the market rollercoaster
Market research has been the foundation of most strategic planning.
Unfortunately, traditional market research has formed the basis for most of
the market information that companies have used to do their planning (see
Chapter 15). That kind of information typically is too general to be of much
use in specific markets. The information you really need for planning pur-
poses comes directly from the customer.
A classic case of the failure to listen to the voice of the customer is the intro-
duction of New Coke, the beverage that taught Coca-Cola some important
lessons. Coca-Cola, in an effort to break out of the Coke-Pepsi wars, decided
to tweak its famous formula. It based the decision on faulty market research,
in which they asked consumers if they would buy a product that tastes better
than Pepsi but was still a Coke. Consumers, without ever having tasted the
product, responded with a resounding “Yes!” However, Coca-Cola failed to ask
the most important question: “Why?” The company went ahead and launched
the product based on its feedback, and it was a disaster. At the end of 77
days, Coca-Cola reintroduced Classic Coke with great fanfare, telling its cus-
tomers that it had made a mistake. Fortunately for Coca-Cola, their loyal cus-
tomers became even more loyal.
Customers, however, sometimes don’t readily reveal what they really want.
Often they give the easiest, most expedient answer to a question such as
“What do you think of this product?” No one wants to intentionally hurt
someone’s feelings, even if it is a big company like Coca-Cola. If you don’t
spend time out in the market listening to real people, you’re taking a big
chance that the information being used by your company doesn’t reflect the
real feelings of the customer. If the info doesn’t match up, the strategies you
devise won’t hit the mark.
Keeping up with the changing competition
In the past, a business could create a sustainable competitive advantage —
relatively easily — through such things as a unique market segment, lower
costs, product/service differentiation, and superior execution. In today’s fast-
changing, global marketplace, staying ahead of the competition isn’t that
74
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

easy. Superiority in one or more of those areas can certainly get you started,
but you won’t be able to sustain an advantage with those factors alone.
Many businesses now say that you literally have to ignore the competition to
gain a competitive advantage. (Look at the nearby sidebar to discover how
Cirque du Soleil used this strategy to capture a competitive advantage and
new value for its customers.) The strategy of imitating your competition or
one-upping them doesn’t work as successfully as it used to.
75
Chapter 5: Polish Your Crystal Ball for Some Strategic Planning
The blue ocean strategy
Take a moment to think back to your childhood.
If we say the word “circus,” what comes to
mind? For most people, it’s a vision of elephants,
clowns, and acrobats; sawdust on the floor; and
vendors hawking cotton candy and popcorn
during the show. If you love the circus and want
to create a company to compete in that space,
Ringling Bros. is pretty stiff competition — it’s
the 800-pound gorilla in the market!
But what if you strategized that the competition
isn’t important — that there must be some
space out there in which Ringling Bros. doesn’t
compete. In other words, you want to find cus-
tomers it doesn’t serve — a clear blue ocean of
“uncontested market space.”
That’s exactly what the founders of Cirque du
Soleil did when they invented a new art form
that combines the best elements of the circus
with an upscale theatrical experience. Guy
Laliberté is the CEO and mastermind behind
Cirque du Soleil, one of Canada’s biggest suc-
cesses. The company began in 1984 when a
group of street performers decided that they
could play on a bigger stage. As they scanned
the landscape, it didn’t seem like a very auspi-
cious time to start a new circus act because the
circus business was definitely in decline as
other forms of entertainment took over. But
Laliberté wasn’t going to start a traditional
circus; he strategized that he could capture not
only those people who enjoy the circus in its tra-
ditional form, but also those that seek a more
cultured and sophisticated experience.
According to Kim and Mauborgne, who wrote
Blue Ocean Strategy, what the creator of Cirque
du Soleil did was capture new customers and
offer them new value in the form of more
sophisticated entertainment. But that isn’t all he
did. He also determined that to achieve the
company’s big goal of becoming the circus for
the 21st century, it needed a strategy that
emphasized efficiency and speed. It also
required tactics that would enable the company
to streamline its costs, thereby producing
bigger profits it could plow back into the com-
pany to facilitate rapid growth.
You may think that CEOs similar to Laliberté are
the norm, because what he wanted to do makes
perfect sense, but they’re not. In fact, their way
of strategically thinking about the market defi-
nitely is in the minority. Why? Because most
CEOs focus on the competition — they’re so
concerned with beating the competition that
they miss opportunities to actually render the
competition irrelevant. Today’s companies need
to think in terms of blue ocean strategy and do
five important things:
1. Look for uncontested market space.
2. Ignore the competition — concentrate on
making them irrelevant.
3. Create new value for customers.
4. Shatter the value/cost tradeoff.
5. Define a strategy that focuses the company
on differentiation and low cost.

Today, the key to standing out from the crowd seems to be in achieving oper-
ational excellence. In other words, you need to make sure that all your sys-
tems and operations are the best they can be, and that they’re aligned to
perfection with your business strategies. Reaching those goals will take some
planning from the bottom-up, not the top-down.
Designing Your Strategy
Right the First Time
No one wants to spend time designing a strategy that doesn’t work or doesn’t
fit with the overall goals of the company. A well-designed strategic plan can
do the following for your company:
 Provide information across the entire organization that may not otherwise
be available.
 Force management to look at the big picture: Where are we going?
 Force people to communicate about goals and resources to achieve
those goals.
 Create a sense of common focus and direction toward an agreed-upon goal.
You must turn your planning into behavior. It’s all well and good to say that
you want your company to increase sales by 50 percent in the coming year,
but exactly how are you going to make that happen? What strategies and tac-
tics will you set? Also, planners too often focus on structural changes and
requirements, such as the plant and equipment, and never consider the
human side of things — such as evaluation and reward systems and manage-
ment development. What are you specifically going to do to provide incen-
tives for your employees? (For more on incentives, see Chapter 7.)
Something New: Strategic Improvising
Face it: Doing business is a lot more difficult today than it used to be (don’t
tell that to the old timers). You certainly can’t rest on your laurels, especially
when someone is out there just waiting for the chance to puncture your
happy balloon. That’s where strategic improvising comes into play. Strategic
improvising is a proactive approach to strategic planning where the entrepre-
neur is constantly scanning the business environment to look for trends —
early patterns that signal a change is about to happen. It beats being
smacked in the face with something you weren’t expecting.
76
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

Getting surprised by something it wasn’t expecting is exactly what happened
to MP3. It had been the dominant player for digital music downloads until
Apple Computer surprised the music world with the introduction of the iPod.
Surprise was also in the cards for Sony’s ACID, which dominated desktop
music-editing software until Apple released GarageBand, its music-editing
suite. In fact, through a process of strategic improvising, Apple was able to
beat first-to-market technologies with the iPod, iTunes, iMovie, and
GarageBand. Bravo! This section takes a closer look at strategic improvising
and what you can do to help give your business an advantage.
Keep your head up
You can’t see what’s coming if your head is buried in the sand like the prover-
bial ostrich. And many business owners do just that. They become so caught
up in the day-to-day activities of their businesses that they never stop to see
what’s coming down the road.
Strategic improvising must be a regular activity of your company, not some-
thing you do where there’s nothing else to do (we find that business owners
rarely have nothing else to do!). Regularly scanning the environment for
changes that might affect your business will ensure that you have time to pre-
pare to meet those changes. To make sure that your company is keeping its
eyes on the business environment, we recommend doing the following:
 Encourage everyone, from management employees to mailroom workers,
to read trade journals for your industry. You can’t stay competitive and
meet the needs of your customers if your focus is completely inside the
business. You can now find many of these journals on the Internet.
 Attend trade association meetings and business conferences. Here you
can network with others in your industry and get the latest information
and hear the latest rumors on who’s doing what.
 Make sure that everyone stays close to the customer so that you’re
always up-to-date on their changing needs. You can do that by talking
to customers on the phone, by bringing them to your company for a
visit or tour, or by giving them access to your company via a Web site
(see Chapter 15).
The bottom line is that as you begin to think about strategic planning for your
organization, you should think about it in terms of the changing environment
in which your company is operating. Don’t plan so rigidly that you forget to
change your plans before the environment changes and it’s too late. Here’s a
checklist of questions to ask yourself to make sure that you’re planning for
change in your organization:

Power to the people
Today’s employees want the ability to make a difference in their organizations.
They want to have the opportunity to grow and develop their skills in a way that
benefits their companies. In a word, today’s employees want empowerment.
Given that, the traditional top-down style of strategic planning and management
78
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

just doesn’t work anymore (see Chapter 6 for more on managing today). You
need to give employees the opportunity to participate in the strategic planning
for the future of the company. Their participation and drive will be important
when you’re ready to execute your plans and to make a big impact in your
industry and your market.
Here’s how you can get your employees involved in strategic planning and
improvising:
 Have the various work groups in your organization meet individually to
come up with at least one goal they’d like to achieve in the next six
months. Also, ask them to think of one or more goals they want to
achieve in the next year.
 Ask each work group to meet with management to discuss these goals
and to formulate strategies and tactics to achieve them. These strategies
and tactics should reflect a solid understanding of what’s happening in
the business environment (see the earlier section “Keep your head up”).
 Management should then be prepared to discuss with each team how
the stated goals will help the company meet its grand mission. In that
way, all employees in the organization understand that they’re contribut-
ing an important piece to the puzzle, and they’ll be more likely to work
harder to achieve their goals.
 Present the goals of each team to the entire organization. Doing this ensures
that the goals of one team don’t negatively affect the goals of another. This
exercise is important for all employees because it enables them to clearly
see that what they do affects everyone else and the company as a whole.
Employing a SWOT Analysis
One of the traditional jumping-off points in the development of strategies is a
SWOT analysis (illustrated in Figure 5-1). SWOT is an acronym that stands for
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The analysis is merely a
guide for organizing your thinking about your company and the environment
in which it operates. Strengths and weaknesses are part of the internal analy-
sis of your organization. Opportunities and threats are part of the external
analysis of the environment in which your company operates — in short,
everything outside your organization that may affect it.
79
Chapter 5: Polish Your Crystal Ball for Some Strategic Planning

To conduct a SWOT analysis for your company, fill out the following brief
form and see where your company stands. Then take a look at the sections
that follow the form to get some ideas for how to look at your business and to
see how the four components of a SWOT analysis interrelate:

____________________________________________________________________
Examining your company’s strengths
Your company’s strengths are its skills, capabilities, and core competencies
that work together to enable you to achieve your goals and objectives.
Examples of strengths are an extraordinary team that works well together, 
a patented technology that you developed, or control of key distribution
components.
Successful companies such as search-engine company Google capitalize on
their strengths. One of Google’s biggest strengths is its corporate culture. It’s
frequently labeled “one of the best companies to work for,” and it takes pride
in its creative and family oriented environment. Why is culture a strength?
One of the biggest costs to any business is employees and employee
turnover. If you keep employees happy, they won’t want to leave, and they’ll
work harder to make sure your company succeeds. It’s as simple as that; yet,
most companies don’t spend much time thinking about a strategy for improv-
ing their corporate cultures.
One or more of your strengths may become your competitive advantage in
the marketplace. For example, suppose that your company is really good at
coming up with innovative designs for new products. It’s probably in your
best interest to focus your efforts and resources on that strength to differen-
tiate your company in the marketplace. Scattering scarce resources across
too many diverse capabilities only weakens your competitive stance. You can
outsource your weaknesses to other companies and focus on what you do
best (see Chapter 18 for tips on outsourcing).
For example, many companies today outsource expensive manufacturing, dis-
tribution, and even payroll functions. Plenty of companies are leasing their
employees back from PEOs (professional employer organizations), which
take the tedious and time-consuming task of human-resource management
from the companies so they can focus on their core competencies.
Evaluating your company’s weaknesses
Your company’s weaknesses (and every company has them) also play a role
in your ability to achieve your goals. CEOs often can more easily describe
81
Chapter 5: Polish Your Crystal Ball for Some Strategic Planning

their business’ strengths than their weaknesses, generally because they don’t
like to admit that they have any weaknesses. Weaknesses are those skills,
capabilities, and competencies that your company lacks and that prevent you
from achieving your goals and objectives. If your company doesn’t have a
critical skill or capability that it needs to achieve a particular goal, you have
three choices:
 Modify the goal to something achievable with the skill set you have.
 Raise the capital needed to acquire the skill or capability you need (see
Chapter 14).
 Find another company that has the core competency you need and out-
source that need or collaborate through a strategic partnership.
Suppose, for example, that you have a fast-food company that’s known for its
food and the ability to get it to the customer very quickly. Your weakness,
however, is administering the business side of the business — accounting,
payroll, and so forth. You should consider outsourcing those weaknesses to a
company that specializes in providing these services to businesses.
Recognizing your company’s 
opportunities and threats
Opportunities are those things that help your business grow to new levels.
Threats are barriers to that growth. The classic books of Michael Porter on
competitive strategy provide a framework for looking at the environmental fac-
tors that affect every business (Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing
Industries and Competitors, and Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining
Superior Performance [Free Press]). These factors are worded as threats, but
their corollary is really an opportunity. When you see a way around a barrier or
threat, you’re seeing an opportunity to move forward in the market.
Porter’s basic assumption is that sustaining high performance levels requires a
well-conceived strategy and a tactical plan based on how your industry works.
He asserts that five forces affect the ultimate profit potential of a company.
Here are Porter’s five forces:
 Threat of new entrants: Barriers to entering an industry include economies
of scale, brand loyalty, capital requirements, switching costs (the costs
buyers incur in time and money to retrain staff and learn a new product
or relationship), access to distribution channels, proprietary factors (for
example, technology owned by someone else), and government regula-
tions. If these barriers are very high, your company will need to be well
funded (it takes a long time to tear down barriers) and find strategic
partners to overcome them.
82
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

 Threat from substitute products: Substitute products may come from
other industries, but they accomplish the same basic function as your
product in a different way or at a different price. You need to know the
likelihood that customers will use these substitutes and what it will cost
them to switch to your product. If switching to your product is difficult or
costly to the customer, you’ll need to ensure that your marketing strategy
educates the customer on the value of switching to your product (see
Chapter 3 about the value proposition).
 Threat from buyers’ bargaining power: Volume buyers in an industry
can force down prices. In a world where a simple Internet search can pro-
vide buyers with an enormous amount of price information, buyers have
a lot of bargaining power. Your ability to create complex products and
services that can’t easily be compared on price and that convey a strong
benefit to the buyer will help you avoid competing solely on price.
 Threat from suppliers’ bargaining power: Suppliers can exert pressure
by threatening to raise prices or change quality or volume of supply.
Here’s where strategic improvising can really help. You should always
have more than one supply source for anything you have to purchase to
make your product. That way, if your main supplier hikes prices or runs
low on materials, you can quickly switch to a backup supplier.
 Threat from the rivalry among existing industry firms: A highly competi-
tive industry drives down profits and prices. Airline price wars are a good
example of this situation. Competing on price is a no-win proposition. You
need to compete on value, so making sure that buyers understand the
benefit they receive from dealing with your company will be critical to
your success. Again, a marketing strategy that’s focused on a value
message is important (see Chapter 15).
By looking at your industry from the five forces perspective, you can get a
better sense of the opportunities and threats facing your business. Even
when the environmental forces seem negative and threats appear to be more
prevalent than opportunities, your business can still do well. For example,
when steel companies were losing money in the 1980s and 1990s, an entrepre-
neurial upstart named Nucor Steel saw its stock prices skyrocket as the
result of its lower overhead, mini-mill strategy.
Putting your company through a test
After you complete the SWOT analysis for your company and the environment
in which it operates, you can ask four very important questions — sort of a
final exam. Are you ready?
 Do you have the resources and capabilities necessary to take advantage
of opportunities in your environment and to neutralize the threats?
The answer you give today may not be the correct answer six months
from now. The environment and its opportunities and threats are in a
83
Chapter 5: Polish Your Crystal Ball for Some Strategic Planning

constant state of change, and that’s why strategic improvising is a valu-
able skill to acquire.
 How many competing firms already own the same valuable resources
and competencies that your company has? If several companies have
the same resources and competencies you do, they probably won’t be a
source of competitive advantage for you. But they will be a barrier to
entry for a new company trying to compete with you. Your mission is to
find a competitive advantage that’s unique to you.
 If your company doesn’t have a particular resource or capability, do
you face a cost disadvantage in obtaining it? If acquiring the resources
and competencies you need will cost you a lot, catching up to your com-
petitor’s advantage in that area may be more difficult and take longer.
However, if you can find a good substitute, you may be able to achieve
competitive parity.
 Is your company organized to take full advantage of its resources and
capabilities? To take full advantage of what you have, you need to
create a good support structure that consists of control systems, a
formal reporting structure, compensation policies, and technology. This
way, when you start to grow, your strategies won’t fall apart.
The bottom line: If you ensure that your company has strong resources and
competencies, you can compete in nearly any environment — even if you
appear to be facing few opportunities and many threats.
Planning for Success with 
Operational Innovation
One of the biggest trends in business during the past few years has been
process or operational innovation: redesigning every aspect of a business in
new ways to reduce costs, save time, or provide better service. What’s the
reasoning behind operational innovation? All systems — which include busi-
ness organizations — are subject to entropy, a natural degradation that
occurs over time. If your business strives to maintain its current status
(never a good idea), ultimately you’ll begin consuming your own resources
just to survive and then you can’t respond quickly when change occurs.
One of the best examples of the effects of entropy is what happened to IBM.
IBM’s managers believed that the company’s enormous success would last
indefinitely if they just kept the business in status quo. When the computer
market suddenly changed, IBM was unprepared and dropped from its illustri-
ous perch as the world’s largest and most successful computer manufacturer.
Microsoft, on the other hand, is an example of a large company that recog-
nized — but almost too late — that the Internet was going to be a big thing. In
84
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

a feat of re-engineering that should go down in the history books, Microsoft
completely turned around its business and set its sights on this new frontier.
It aligned its people and systems with strategies designed to establish a sig-
nificant presence in the Internet market. This new strategy was critical to the
company’s continued growth.
And speaking of strategy, Google’s auction methodology for ads that appear
next to its search engine (Google AdWords) has been so successful, producing
extraordinary revenues for the company, that Microsoft is now positioning
itself to get into the ad revenue business. This proves once again that a spunky
entrepreneurial company can push the 800-pound gorilla around a bit!
What operational innovation is all about
Be careful not to confuse the strategy of operational innovation with opera-
tional improvement, which really is just a way to achieve higher performance
by using current methods. Operational innovation is about coming up with
brand new ways of doing whatever processes are part of your business. The
advantage of this strategy is that it’s very difficult for a competitor to copy
your operational plan. How many companies, for instance, have tried to
achieve what Wal-Mart accomplished by using technology, such as RFID
(radio frequency identification) to streamline how it purchases and distrib-
utes the products it sells? Because of process innovation, Wal-Mart was able
to grow from $44 million in sales in 1972 to more than $44 billion in 1992.
Process innovations produce faster time-to-market and lower costs, which
result in higher customer satisfaction and retention — a big payoff for any
company that practices this strategy. Check out Chapter 18 for more info on
the strategy.
Making process innovation work
Process innovation itself is quite simple. It has five components:
 Develops goals and a plan for fostering innovation in your company.
 Ensures that top management conveys its total commitment to the effort.
 Makes sure that everyone feels a sense of urgency.
Operational innovation usually has a better chance of working if it
occurs under conditions of urgency. An urgent need is more easily felt
by everyone in the organization, and the only way that innovation can
be successful is if everyone commits to it.
 Starts the innovation effort by looking at your company as if you were
starting from scratch. Anything goes.
85
Chapter 5: Polish Your Crystal Ball for Some Strategic Planning

 Takes perspectives from the top of the organizational chart and the
bottom. Meet in the middle with a new perspective that’s comprised of
the best of both positions.
Of course, any innovation strategy must begin with your customers. You
need to ask your customers, “What are you trying to accomplish?” Then
begin to find and put into place procedures and systems designed to meet
those needs.
Measuring Strategic Planning Success
Unfortunately, the strategy-to-performance gap in most businesses is large
because managers often fail to return to their plans to make sure they are on
track to achieve their objectives. In fact, Michael Mankins and Richard Steel
discovered some surprising results in their research of senior executives
from 197 companies worldwide — companies that produced sales of more
than $500 million. What they found was that less than 15 percent of these
companies ever went back to their strategic plans to see if they actually had
achieved their objectives! That apathy is astonishing when you consider how
much time and effort went into creating and implementing those plans.
Furthermore, the researchers learned that the strategies these companies
executed delivered only 63 percent of potential performance. Putting those
figures together, you can see why it’s so important to put in place some met-
rics to measure your performance and then check your actual performance
against the metrics on a regular basis.
This section takes a closer look at how you can set manageable benchmarks
to measure your progress, how you can make adjustments, and how you can
make accurate measurements.
Creating clear objectives
Suppose that one of your operational objectives is to increase productivity in
the shipping department. Will you reach your objective when one more box a
day goes out? Or will it take 500 boxes more a day to satisfy the objective? You
need to state your objectives in measurable terms — for example, increase pro-
ductivity in the shipping department by 50 percent per day, every day. With a
clearly stated, measurable objective, you’ll know when you’ve achieved it.
Try your hand at a little quiz. Look at the following list of objectives. Which
ones are well-written?
 To reduce our inventory by 25 percent in six months.
 To increase sales this year.
86
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

 To reduce the employee turnover rate.
 To hire 20 new employees each month for the next six months.
 To beat our competitors.
Now, find out how you did. The well-written objectives are the first and the
fourth bullets, because they display clearly measurable objectives. You’ll
know when you’ve achieved them. Now, how can you improve the other three
objectives? Try rewriting them here:
To increase sales this year.
____________________________________________________________________
To reduce the employee turnover rate.
____________________________________________________________________
To beat our competitors.
____________________________________________________________________
Now, check your responses against the following examples to see how you
measure up:
To increase sales by 25 percent by December 31.
To reduce employee turnover by 30 percent in six months.
To sell 25 percent more product than our competitors by December 31.
As you can see, to produce effective objectives, you need to think about how
you’ll measure progress and performance.
Determining your metrics for success
When you turn goals into strategic action, you put them in a form that you can
measure. In other words, you can now ask, “What’s the benchmark point or
metric for success?” Today, companies often have hundreds of metrics, old
and new, competing for the attention of the decision makers. It’s no wonder
that so little is accomplished and that few people know what’s important.
One large company in the video-surveillance industry, with about 1,800
employees, gears all its measures toward one overriding goal — fanatical cus-
tomer satisfaction. So, the benchmark measures are simple: 100 percent on-
time delivery, 100 percent quality, and 100 percent customer satisfaction.
And, surprisingly enough, when the company doesn’t reach its goals, it’s off
by only 0.03 percent! The financial goals for the company come second to its
customer goals, but logically, when the company meets its customers’ goals,
it will also meet its financial goals.
87
Chapter 5: Polish Your Crystal Ball for Some Strategic Planning

Here are some tips for establishing meaningful metrics to measure progress
toward your goals:
 Make your strategy statement simple and very tangible so that there’s
no confusion over how to achieve the objective.
 Ensure that your forecasts (the numbers you’re attempting to achieve
with your strategy) have underlying assumptions that align with market
economics and the core competencies of your company.
 Make sure that the corporate management side of the business is speaking
the same language as the functional side: marketing, finance, operations.
That’s the only way that both sides will know that the assumptions
associated with the financial projections are reasonable and achievable.
 Talk about what resources you’ll need to deploy — and when — early in
the process. You don’t want resources to become a stumbling block to
executing your strategy.
 Identify and agree on your priorities. Every strategy is implemented
through a series of tactics, but not all strategies and tactics are created
equal. Depending on the availability of resources — human, operational,
and financial — you may end up having to choose among several strategies,
and then you have to choose among the tactics available to execute the
most important strategy.
 Plan to monitor the specific drivers of performance on a regular basis.
These are the activities that affect your bottom line, such as sales, occu-
pancy rate, and turnover. If you stay on top of the drivers that are impor-
tant to your business, when something deviates from your plan, you can
respond and make corrections before things get too far off track.
 Reward execution. The people charged with implementing the strategic
plan carry a very significant responsibility — arguably more important
than the team that created the plan in the first place. If the “doers” don’t
have an incentive to drive the plan toward the objective, the plan will
never be achieved. It’s as simple as that.
Measuring during and after operations
Measuring and monitoring performance is the only way to ensure that your
strategic plans meet your objectives. Measuring needs to occur during and
after operations. Monitoring is an ongoing process to check the results of
your measurements and keep you on track.
You can use four basic sets of measures to gauge progress toward your goals:
 Leading measures look at the immediate results of an operation and mea-
sure such things as defects, cycle time, time-to-customer, and break-even
time. These measures give you a sense of the efficiency and effectiveness
of the process.
88
Part I: The New, Improved World of Business 

 Lagging measures depict the results of completed operations over a
period of time, and include such things as earnings, cash flow, revenue,
customer satisfaction, market share, and so forth. These measures give
you a sense of the effectiveness of the product/process as a whole.
 Internal measures gauge the effectiveness of the organization itself, and
include such things as backlog, design costs, material costs, distribution
costs, and end-product costs. But they also include non-cost-based mea-
sures such as percent of on-time delivery, number of new products, and
design cycle time.
 External measures assess how the business performs in its environ-
ment, and include such things as the business’s performance relative to
its competitors, suppliers, and the marketplace in general. They also
include cost-based measures, such as relative R&D expenditures and
labor costs, and non-cost-based measures, such as number of repeat
buyers and number of customer complaints.
Figuring out how to juggle
You want to measure many aspects of your business, but remember that you
can’t measure them in a vacuum. Anything that happens in one area of your
business has a measurable impact on at least one other area. You need to
know how to adjust for those effects.
One team of management strategists uses the example of a company 
whose objective was to maintain only one day’s supply of inventory on
hand. This objective improved cash flow considerably, but it also required
the company to make some very fundamental (and potentially expensive)
changes in the way it did business. Here’s what that company needed to do to
accomplish its objective:
 Reduce its manufacturing lead time.
 Put its parts on a just-in-time system (see Chapter 18).
 Design right the first time to avoid costly redesign.
 Invest in highly capable machine tools.
 Speed up machine setup.
 Schedule machine usage more effectively.
 Purchase high-quality components.
 Reduce the number of parts.
 Design products that are easy to manufacture.
89
Chapter 5: Polish Your Crystal Ball for Some Strategic Planning

Each of the tasks in the preceding list has its own measure of success. Suddenly,
this seemingly simple objective has become quite complex for the company. It
must weigh the gains from reducing inventory against the costs of setting up the
process and equipment that will allow the reduction to occur. In short, the com-
pany must perform a juggling act. Now, throw another ball into the mix. The
objective in this example is to maintain a one-day’s supply of inventory on hand.
We sugges ted some ways the company could make that happen if it plans to
manufacture in-house. But what if the company outsourced its manufacturing to
a company that’s already on a just-in-time system? It could achieve the same
goal with a different strategy. Isn’t juggling fun?
Part of setting objectives, and ultimately measuring them, is weighing alterna-
tives and judging the cost/benefit of each.

difference between managing and leading an organization,
as well as the latest trends in leadership. We look at how
to recruit and retain the best employees and then moti-
vate and reward them so you can keep them for the long
haul. We also examine one of the most important and
effective tools in business today: employee teams.

T
he focus of management used to be a fairly simple proposition. According
to most any traditional management textbook, all you had to do was
master the four classic roles of management to achieve success: planning,
organizing, leading, and controlling.
Today, however, the organizations that managers run and the environment 
in which those organizations operate are more complex. As a result, the pro-
fession of management is undergoing tremendous change. Leadership as a
field of study also is undergoing change, brought about by the influence of
entrepreneurship on leadership style (see Chapter 3). This chapter takes a
closer look at what a manager is and does, as well as the differences between
managers and leaders.
Understanding What Managers Do
The very definition of management — getting work done through others — 
is deceivingly simple. As every manager now knows, management can be 
a very complicated, stressful, traumatic, and exhausting job. Whereas many
employees — software engineers, human resources coordinators, sales repre-
sentatives, and the like — are specialists and can focus their efforts on a fairly
narrow range of responsibilities, companies expect managers to be generalists.

Instead of knowing a lot about only a few topics, managers need to know a 
little bit about most everything that falls within the boundaries of their 
organizations.
For example, an accounts payable clerk may spend all day paying invoices and
dealing with vendors to clear up problems in their billings. However, the man-
ager of the accounting department has to understand not only what that par-
ticular employee is doing, and why he or she is doing it, but also the jobs of
the employees in charge of accounts receivable, payroll, management informa-
tion systems, budget, audit, and more. And having technical knowledge and
expertise in these many different areas isn’t enough for the manager; he or
she also needs to understand how to enable and encourage the employees to
give their best efforts day in and day out (see Chapter 7 for more on motivat-
ing employees). This section takes a closer look at who managers are and
exactly what they do.
The different levels of management
Management, in most organizations that have enough employees to merit it,
is split into three levels — each with its own unique set of responsibilities
and functions:
 Top management: The chairman of the board, president, chief execu-
tive officer (CEO), chief operating officer (COO), chief information 
officer (CIO), chief financial officer (CFO), vice presidents, and other
executives comprise an organization’s highest-ranking management
team. Top management usually creates an organization’s vision and key
goals, communicates them to other managers and workers, and moni-
tors the organization’s progress toward meeting them (refer to Chapter 5).
 Middle management: Department managers, deputy project managers,
brand managers, assistant plant managers, and many other kinds of
managers who report to top management make up the middle manage-
ment level. Middle management must create the plans, systems, and
organizations to achieve the company’s vision and key goals. Middle
managers generally report to top managers.
 Supervisors: Going by an amazing array of titles, supervisors are the
employees closest to the frontline workers — and, therefore, often clos-
est to the organization’s customers and clients. Supervisors execute the
plans developed by middle managers and monitor worker performance
on a day-to-day basis. Supervisors generally report to middle managers.
As every MBA student learns during the course of his or her studies, four tradi-
tional functions of management exist. In today’s fast and furious world of global
business, however, these traditional roles are undergoing significant change. To
be successful, managers must learn to adapt to this new world of work. Today’s
workers are taking on roles that were once reserved for managers. This 
94
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

shift in the traditional roles of managers and workers has led to incredible
productivity gains in progressive companies.
Planning
Organizations need goals. Goals reflect what’s most important to an organiza-
tion, and they make it easy for managers to prioritize work and the allocation
of resources (such as people, money, and capital equipment; see the following
section). Management’s key jobs include developing organizational goals and
then planning the strategies and tactics that the organization will use to reach
these goals (see Chapter 5).
An example of the planning function of management is when a company’s 
management team flies to Palm Beach, Florida, to attend a week-long, offsite
meeting. The goal of the gathering: to create the organization’s five-year (long-
range) plan. Of course, if the meeting is like most management offsite meetings,
little actual work occurs until the last day, after everyone is too tired to golf or
too sunburned to hang out at the pool!
Research has found that in most growing companies, regular planning falls by
the wayside. Managers in these companies end up spending most of their time
putting out daily fires. What, unfortunately, results from this lack of planning 
is a ship without a rudder. Even worse, individual members of a management
team could actually have completely different goals for the same organization!
Organizing
Organizing is the allocation of resources (such as people, money, and capital
equipment) to achieve an organization’s goals (see the previous section).
Managers allocate through organizational charts, staffing plans, and budgets.
As many of you have probably noticed, managers spend endless hours devel-
oping new and exciting staffing and organizational configurations, only to
change them again in six months. Why? Because doing so is part of the job!
Today’s organizations must be faster and more flexible than ever before. The
days of the old-fashioned, rigid organizational chart — with its built-in bureau-
cracy and hierarchy — are fast disappearing. In its place are self-managing
work teams (see Chapter 9), cross-trained workers, virtual employees, flexible
work schedules, hot groups, and more.
This makes organizing more challenging for managers, of course. One key 
to success in an increasingly competitive global marketplace is the ability to
adapt to rapidly changing business conditions — and to do so quickly and
completely. Putting new organizational plans into place as you strive to adapt
is the job of managers.
95
Chapter 6: Managing Is Hard; Leading Is Even Harder

Leading
Leading employees means inspiring them, motivating them to higher levels 
of performance, and directing their efforts. Managers have a wide variety of
positive motivational tools at their disposal, including the following:
 Communicating a vision
 Rewarding and recognizing
 Encouraging
 Personally thanking employees
They also have negative motivational tools such as
 Disciplining
 Threatening
 Coercing
Today, simply being a manager isn’t enough. Organizations need their man-
agers to also be leaders — to inspire employees and to encourage them to
give their very best every day of the week. For more on motivating your
employees, head to Chapter 7.
Controlling
Control is the process of monitoring and evaluating activities to ensure that 
a company’s goals are being achieved. To plan, organize, and lead isn’t enough.
For managers to be effective, they must also review the organization’s progress
toward achieving its goals. This review indicates whether plans and goals need
to be updated, modified, or scrapped altogether; whether the organization 
as designed is up to the task; and whether the manager’s efforts at leading
employees are having the desired impact (see Chapter 5 for more on reviewing
strategic plans).
Picture this all-too-common scenario: As managers review weekly depart-
mental finance reports, they quickly realize that the reorganization they so
painstakingly designed isn’t having its desired effect. Sales are down, costs
are up, and employee morale is heading south. Something has to be done —
and soon! The time to plan another management offsite meeting has arrived!

Highlighting the Differences between
Managers and Leaders
Although each of the four roles of managers (see the previous section) is
important to a manager’s overall success, leading employees is the one role
that seemingly generates the most interest in organizations. What about lead-
ership makes it different from management? Why is leadership so important
to organizations today? Can managers learn to become better leaders? This
section and the rest of this chapter answer these questions.
Managers are responsible for making organizations work, and one of their key
functions is leading the employees within the organizations. Good leadership is
a skill that can turn an okay manager into a superstar. Employees want to work
for strong leaders, and they consistently give their best efforts when they do.
What makes a leader? What subtle mix of tangible and intangible qualities sets
someone apart from the pack and brings out the follower in others? In general
terms, leaders are
 Charismatic: They attract people’s interest.
 Convincing: They have the ability to sway people’s opinions toward
their own.
 Credible: They’re honest and have integrity; people trust them.
 Capable: They’re very good at what they do, and they inspire others 
to meet their high standards.
 Visionary: They can see a clear vision of the future and communicate 
it to others in compelling detail.
 Focused: They’re supremely focused on attaining their vision.
When it comes to the workplace, managers are more effective when they’re
also good leaders. The best managers are equally adept at both management
skills and leadership skills. Perhaps U.S. Navy Admiral Grace Murray Hopper
was right when she said, “You manage things; you lead people.”
Management focuses on things: systems, processes, procedures, paperwork,
and the rest of the matters that make businesses run. Leadership focuses on
people: inspiring, leading, convincing, and motivating. Leaders perform duties
that keep employees motivated and engaged in their jobs.
97
Chapter 6: Managing Is Hard; Leading Is Even Harder

Leaders are in demand in organizations today — not just within the ranks 
of management, but throughout an organization. If you’re good at managing
things but not so good at leading people, focus on developing your leadership
skills. Read books on the topic of leadership. Observe how leaders whom you
respect and admire lead others, and model yourself after them. Above all, keep
striving to improve your leadership skills. Your employees will thank you.
Getting Work Done through Others
As we say earlier in this chapter, management consists of getting work done
through others. That’s all well and good, but exactly how do managers make
that happen? A number of different ways exist — each with its own advantages,
disadvantages, and limitations. This section points them out.
Power and influence
Five key sources of power exist in an organization. Every employee wields one
or more of these sources of power within his or her own job, and the sources
can change from situation to situation. Power gives managers the ability to
influence others to do what they ask of them.
Which of the following sources of power do you use to get things done at work?
 Personal power comes from within you. This power springs from your
personality, your charisma, the strength of your beliefs and convictions,
and your ability to express them. For example, a hard-working, front-line
employee who inspires her coworkers to work harder by her example
has personal power.
 Relationship power comes from the strength of your network of friends,
contacts, and business associates. Have you ever heard the phrase, “I’ve
got friends in high places?” You get the idea! An example of relationship
power in an organization is the incredible power that assistants to CEOs
and other top managers wield. They often have as much (or perhaps
even more) real power as the executives to whom they report.
 Position power comes from your place within a company’s hierarchy. 
A company’s president has high position power. The mailroom clerk has
low position power.
 Knowledge power comes from your experience, training, schooling, and
expertise — in your particular job, within your organizational unit, and
in the organization as a whole. This power includes technical prowess,
as well as your ability to manage the personalities of those you work
with. Because computer networks — and their care and maintenance —
98
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

have become extremely important in most organizations, information
technology professionals have very high knowledge power.
 Task power comes from the job itself. For example, in an advertising
agency, account reps who sell new clients on the agency and who have 
a direct impact on bringing in revenues have higher task power than
employees in the accounting department whose job it is to send out
invoices and collect payments.
Responsibility, authority, 
and accountability
Responsibility, authority, and accountability are extremely powerful forces in
an organization, because they’re the key ways that managers get work done
through others:
 Responsibility signifies who in the organization must complete a spe-
cific task or job. When you assign a task to an employee (or delegate it;
see the following section), you should also assign responsibility for its
successful completion. Employees who are given responsibility for tasks
are more likely to do them well and feel like they’re significant parts of
the organization.
 Authority means that your organization has formally granted you the
power you need to do a specific job. When you delegate this power along
with an assigned task, you’re delegating authority to the employee to
complete the task.
 Accountability means answering for the results you accomplish — or
don’t accomplish — when you take on a task. When you assign a task to
an employee, you should also assign accountability for whether the task
is done correctly or not.
Delegation
No manager can do everything alone. Managers leverage themselves — 
multiplying the work they can accomplish many times — by delegating work,
responsibility, and authority to employees. Delegation is a great tool for man-
agers to increase the amount of work they can get done, and it often achieves
better results.
So why do so many managers have such a hard time delegating work to their
employees? Fear causes part of the reluctance — fear that employees can’t or
won’t do the work as well as the managers can. Some managers also feel that
they’re too busy to take the time to train employees to do the tasks well; 
99
Chapter 6: Managing Is Hard; Leading Is Even Harder

therefore, simply tackling the jobs themselves seems easier. And perhaps the
desire to bask in the spotlight alone for completing important tasks con-
tributes to some managers’ reluctance to delegate.
In any case, delegation is the first choice for managers to get work done
through others. It can be an incredibly effective tool when done right — and a
remarkably destructive tool when done wrong. Here are six steps for delegating
the right way:
1. Communicate the task.
Describe exactly what you want done, when you want it done, and the end
results you expect. Be clear and invite your employee to ask a lot of ques-
tions until you’re convinced he or she understands what you want done.
2. Furnish context for the task.
Most people want to know the reasons why they should do something.
Explain to your employee why the task needs to be done, its importance
in the overall scheme of things, and any possible complications that may
arise during its performance. Again, invite questions and don’t get 
defensive if your employee pushes you for answers.
3. Determine standards.
We all need to know when we cross the finish line. Agree on the standards
that you’ll use to measure the success of a task’s completion. These stan-
dards should be realistic and attainable, and you should avoid changing
them after performance has begun.
4. Grant authority.
You must grant the employee the authority necessary to complete the
task without constant roadblocks or standoffs with other employees.
5. Provide support.
Determine the resources necessary for your employee to complete the
task and then provide them. Successfully completing a task may require
money, training, advice, and other resources.
6. Get commitment.
Make sure that your employee has accepted the assignment. Confirm your
expectations and your employee’s understanding of the commitment to
complete the task.
One of the biggest problems with delegation occurs when a manager dele-
gates responsibility for a task but not the authority and resources necessary
to carry it out effectively. Inevitably, the task becomes much more difficult 
to carry out than it needs to be — perhaps impossible — and the employee
becomes frustrated and even angry. Don’t forget that we all want happy
employees. Happy employees lead to happy customers and clients. Be sure
that when you delegate a task to an employee, you also give the employee
the authority that must go along with it.

Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

Goals
Goals do two things: They show you where you’ve been and where you’re
going. Managers and employees should work together to develop personal
goals to help the employees attain the overall goals of the organization. 
The acronym SMART signifies five traits that will ensure your goals are well-
designed, because well-designed goals are much more likely to have the 
outcomes you and your organization desire:
 Specific: All goals should be clear and unambiguous. Fuzzy goals lead 
to fuzzy outcomes.
 Measurable: Goals are useless if you can’t measure them. If you can’t
measure an outcome, you’ll never know whether it was achieved.
 Attainable: Nothing is more demoralizing than being assigned goals that
are impossible to attain. Be sure that you work with employees to
develop realistic and attainable goals.
 Relevant: Don’t waste your employees’ time (or yours) by asking them
to pursue goals that will take your business somewhere it shouldn’t be!
Every goal should take your employees closer to meeting the overall
goals of the organization.
 Time-bound: Be sure that your goals have beginnings and endings. The
endpoints of goals should never be so far out that employees have no
hope of attaining them. Developing plenty of milestones along the way 
is better than creating only one or two end-all, be-all mega-goals (for more
on this topic, head to Chapter 5).
Designing a Better Organization
One of the four traditional roles of managers is organizing (see the first section
in this chapter for more info). A manager must continuously improve systems
and processes to make them more efficient, more effective, and less costly.
Because the environment of business is always changing — new employees,
new technology, new sources of supply, new competitors (see Chapter 4) —
managers have to be aware of the need to restructure their organizations to
keep them competitive in the marketplace. As you work to design a better 
organization, be sure to consider the factors in the following sections.
Division of labor
The very first step in organizational design is assigning specific employees to
specific jobs. This is commonly called division of labor.
101
Chapter 6: Managing Is Hard; Leading Is Even Harder

In a one-person organization — say, a home-based public-relations agency —
only one person completes all the jobs that need to be done. The business
owner types the letters, answers the phone, places advertisements, designs
promotional materials for clients, writes press releases, schedules clients for
media interviews and radio and television appearances, does the accounting,
pays the bills, and even takes out the trash!
As soon as the sole owner and worker hires an employee, however, he or she
can make the operation more efficient through effective division of labor. The
new hire can take on tasks that the owner isn’t so good at or that require a lot
of work but don’t generate revenues — perhaps typing letters and answering
phones. This way, the owner can concentrate his or her efforts on the tasks
that he or she is best at (such as landing new customers and designing pub-
licity campaigns) and that have a better cash return on the investment of his
or her time.
When you assign a specific job to an employee, ensure that
 The duties of the job are clear and that the boundaries are well-defined.
 The job isn’t too complex or too simple for the particular employee.
 You give the employee the authority to execute the job without undue
management interference.
 The job is kept interesting by varying tasks, goals, and approaches.
 The employee is well-trained to do the job.
Although division of labor has a time-honored place in modern business,
today’s most successful organizations are going a step further — they’re
cross-training employees in the jobs of their coworkers. Employees who
know one another’s jobs are more flexible, and the organizations they work
for can be much more responsive to changing market conditions or to the
challenges of competitors. At the very least, a flexible employee can fill in 
for an absent worker! Also, cross-trained employees often have higher morale
because the varied tasks make their jobs more interesting.
Departmentalization and 
cellular manufacturing
In traditional organizations, after managers hand out individual jobs to employ-
ees, the managers then determine whether they can group any jobs into logical
divisions (called departmentalization). For example, the managers group every
employee assigned a sales-oriented task with other sales-oriented employees
to form a sales department. Employees who have an accounting function —
payroll, accounts receivable, or accounts payable — come together to form an
accounting department. And so it goes throughout the organization.
102
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

This method, however, is the old way of doing business. It put up organiza-
tional walls that led to massive production inefficiencies. A newer method of
structuring manufacturing concerns using manufacturing cells. Cellular manu-
facturing consists of closely linking work steps in a specific process. For 
example, if 20 work steps are involved in completing a piece of work (work, in
this case, means making a product in a plant or processing paper in an office),
cellular manufacturing places the people and the machines they use next to
each other in a work cell. In a traditional manufacturing organization, these 20
work steps would’ve been accomplished in different functional departments
spread throughout the business — perhaps in different buildings, cities,
states, or even countries. Thankfully, this cellular approach also works for
other types of businesses.
Flexible work teams now comprise many functions within organizations, and
some entrepreneurial-type businesses aren’t based on departments at all (see
Chapter 3 for more on entrepreneurial businesses). Chapter 9 covers these
new team-based organizations in detail.
Span of control
Span of control refers to the number of employees reporting to a particular
supervisor or manager. A narrow span of control consists of only a few employ-
ees; a wide span of control includes many employees. One of your authors,
Peter, once indirectly managed a staff of more than 200 employees, working 
at some 45 locations nationwide, for instance. If each employee had reported
directly to Peter, his task would’ve been almost impossible — he would’ve
spent almost every working hour on the phone answering questions, walking
workers through problems, and discussing customer requests.
Narrowing the span of control made Peter’s job feasible. Only four employees
reported directly to Peter — three project managers and an administrative
assistant. And each of the project managers managed a group of ten or more
site supervisors. This arrangement freed up Peter to focus on the big picture —
marketing to new customers (see Part III), keeping current customers happy,
and ensuring that the company effectively utilized staff throughout.
The tendency these days is to flatten organizations by widening the span 
of control and decreasing the layers of management (the hierarchy).
Organizations also rely more on employee teams to take on many of the roles
formerly performed by managers (see Chapter 9). Why flatten an organization?
 The flatter an organization, the fewer layers of management, and less
management leads to less bureaucracy and quicker decision making.
 The fewer layers of management, the more money available to spend on
more productive activities (such as the company picnic — yum!).
103
Chapter 6: Managing Is Hard; Leading Is Even Harder

Creating a Culture of Innovation
Corporations today are spending millions of dollars hiring consultants and
enrolling in workshops, all to create a culture of innovation within their orga-
nizations. Innovation depends on the creative efforts of an organization’s
employees. In today’s fast-changing, technology-driven global marketplace,
innovation isn’t just something nice to have — it’s essential. However, too many
years of corporate conformity have made creativity a rare and valued commod-
ity; smart managers are constantly on the lookout for new ways to release the
hidden creativity in their existing employees. Hence the consultants and work-
shops. In this section, we further discuss why having a culture of innovation is
important for your organization, and we explain what you can do to make your
culture more creative.
Recognizing why innovation is important
For a business owner or manager, asking if innovation really matters is sort 
of like asking if it matters whether Earth’s atmosphere has oxygen — only if
you want to survive! Without innovation, organizations (and people) stagnate,
they fall behind the competition, and they eventually become irrelevant. Ever
wonder why you see all those advertisements for “new and improved” prod-
ucts that have actually been around for a million years? Innovation. The people
who produce Tide detergent, Coca-Cola soda, or Campbell’s soup, for example,
know that they can’t rest on yesterday’s successes. To thrive and to grow in
the future, companies must constantly innovate.
According to Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter (the hero of entrepre-
neurs everywhere), there are five specific types of economic innovation:
 The introduction of a new good (product): A company can introduce a
completely new product, unfamiliar to consumers, or add new qualities
to an already existing product. Think about all the advertisements for
“New and Improved!” laundry detergents or cheeseburgers that “Taste
better!”
 The introduction of a new method of production: Innovation can come
about through the adoption of a new way to manufacture a product,
which may or may not be based on new technology or scientific discov-
eries. For example, automobiles used to be mostly assembled by hand.
Today, robots have taken on many duties formerly assigned to humans.
 A new market in a country where the market hasn’t previously existed:
This includes the opening of a new market into which the particular
branch of manufacture of the country in question hasn’t previously
entered — whether or not this market has existed before. For example, 
104
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

a few decades ago, there wasn’t a market for the production of Japanese
beer in the United States. Companies fulfilled whatever demand existed
for Japanese beer by importing the beer directly from Japan. However, 
a surge in U.S. demand for Japanese beer has led to the current market
situation — a vast majority of the Japanese beer sold in the United States
today is actually brewed in the United States and Canada.
 The conquest of a new source of supply of raw materials, or half-manu-
factured goods: This type is irrespective of whether the source already
exists or must be created. An example is the discovery of petroleum-rich
tar sands in Canada. New ways of extracting the material from the ground
required the introduction of innovative new approaches to oil production.
 The carrying out of the new organization of any industry: For example,
a company can create a monopoly position or break up a monopoly 
position. Both AT&T and Microsoft, at various times in their respective
histories, had to innovate new ways of doing business as a result of 
government and court-mandated curbs on their monopoly power.
If you were to spend any time in an MBA program, you’d probably find 
out that the academics who specialize in innovation have gone well beyond
Schumpeter’s five basic types of innovation. The following list presents some
of the more specific types of business innovation you’re likely to encounter:
 Business model innovation: Innovation in the way business is done, 
usually resulting in the creation of new value. Dell’s model of building 
personal computers to order rather than stockpiling them in a warehouse
is a business model innovation that revolutionized the personal-computer
market and gave customers their computers quicker and at a lower 
price. And, at least until recently, it brought the company great success.
(Remember, business environments change and businesses must too.)
 Marketing innovation: Innovation in marketing methods — specifically in
the areas of product, price, place, promotion, and customers (see Chapter
15). Google’s innovation of Adwords, the pay-per-click online advertising
program, has generated billions of dollars in revenue while filling a vital
need for advertisers to access online customers in niche markets.
 Organizational innovation: Innovation in the design and execution of
business structures, practices, and models, which may involve innovation
in other business areas as well. The Internet, for instance, enables people
to do business anyplace, anytime, which results in entirely new organiza-
tional practices and structures that are independent of traditional, fixed
office space and hierarchies.
 Process innovation: Innovation in production or delivery methods (see
Chapter 18). Henry Ford’s widespread application of the assembly line
to automobile production revolutionized the industry, and it made 
automobiles affordable to most anyone.
105
Chapter 6: Managing Is Hard; Leading Is Even Harder

 Product innovation: Innovation in products — specifically, a product or
service that’s new or significantly improved over whatever is in current
use. Product innovation may touch on the following areas, among others:
• Functional characteristics (works two times faster!)
• Smell (new fresh scent!)
• Performance (works better than the other brand!)
• Technical abilities (now cleans grass stains, too!)
• Ease of use (look how easy it can be!)
 Service innovation: This is the same as product innovation but is specific
to services.
 Supply chain innovation: Innovation in the sourcing of input products
from suppliers and the delivery of output products to customers. Wal-
Mart revolutionized its supply chain, creating efficiencies that put it far
ahead of the competition and vaulting it into the position of the world’s
largest retailer.
Four keys to a more creative 
(and innovative) workplace
So you’ve decided that having a more creative and innovative workplace
wouldn’t be such a bad thing. (Either that, or you read that having one is 
necessary.) Now what? Here are four sure ways you can up the creativity
(and innovation) quotient in your organization:
 Institute fluid and situational hierarchies. Fluid, situational hierarchies
quickly adapt to fast-changing environments. You want to be able to
morph to fit tomorrow’s needs instead of constantly playing catch up
with structures based on yesterday’s needs. You can do this by being
flexible, non-bureaucratic, attentive to shifts in markets, and ready to
respond to changes in the environment quickly and decisively.
For example, at executive search firm Egon Zehnder (which has annual
billings of more than $300 million), the rigid hierarchy typical of a large,
international firm has been supplanted by a fluid organization that empha-
sizes high levels of cooperation, communication, and teamwork, which
unleashes creativity and innovation. Egon Zehnder has become the most
profitable search firm per capita in the world, with productivity that’s 60
percent higher than the industry average.
 Value and foster communication skills throughout the organization.
Communication is the lifeblood of any organization. When channels of
communication are open and unfettered throughout an organization,
information can travel quickly across operational boundaries, from
front-line employees to management and back again.
106
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

 Solve problems by letting “1,000 flowers blossom.” This phrase 
is attributed to former Chinese leader Mao Tse-Tung. Smart leaders
empower people throughout their organizations to come up with ways 
to meet core organizational objectives. They let the chaotic environment
determine the winners through the process of natural selection. They
monitor workers very carefully, have rigorous criteria to evaluate them,
and kill off the failures fast — making it perfectly clear that they’re killing
off the failures and not the people who worked to create a solution.
For instance, the original IBM personal computer was developed by a
team of 12 employees who were given carte blanche to develop a revolu-
tionary new product as quickly as possible. They were even given express
authority to ignore standard company policies when necessary to get the
job done.
 Value and make use of improvisation. Just as musicians open up the
gates to their personal creativity when they improvise the playing of
their instruments, employees can channel their personal creativity —
and strengthen their capacity to think on their feet — by improvising as
they seek solutions to solve problems. This means looking beyond the
tried-and-true and considering alternatives that may not have been
tested before.
In general, innovation can be incremental — it occurs steadily, on a step-by-
step basis (think gradual improvements in automobile fuel efficiency) — or
radical — involving a large and sudden leap (such as when the Manhattan
Project scientists harnessed the power of the atomic bomb or, more recently,
when the Internet changed the way business is conducted). Whether incre-
mental or radical, innovation can have a significant and positive impact on

Ethics: Following Your Business Compass
In today’s business world, it seems that not a day goes by without news 
of a business scandal. A CEO backdated his stock options, a board member
secretly taped confidential meetings and then used the information to black-
mail other board members, an employee embezzled $100,000 from the com-
pany’s owners, and so on. With a seemingly endless parade of business
scandals, you may begin to wonder whether anyone in business knows the
difference between right and wrong. This section points out what ethics are
and what you can do to make ethical decisions.
Understanding what’s right and wrong
Ethics are the standards, or beliefs and values, that guide conduct, behavior,
and activities — in other words, a way of thinking that provides boundaries
107
Chapter 6: Managing Is Hard; Leading Is Even Harder

for your actions. In its most common usage, ethics is simply doing the right
thing. And not just talking or thinking about doing the right thing, but really
doing it!
When you have high ethical standards on the job, you generally exhibit some
or all of the following qualities and behaviors:
 Honesty
 Integrity
 Impartiality
 Fairness
 Loyalty
 Dedication
 Responsibility
 Accountability
Ethical behavior starts with each person. Just because someone else is doing
something that’s unethical (morally wrong) — or illegal (legally wrong) —
doesn’t mean that you should do it, too. When you behave ethically — what-
ever your position within an organization — others will follow your example
and behave ethically, too. And, if you practice ethical conduct, it will reinforce
and perhaps improve your own ethical standards.
Setting an example for others to follow
As a leader, it’s up to you to set a good example of ethical and honest behavior
for your employees to follow. This means working within the rules of your orga-
nization, not breaking the law, and treating people fairly and honestly. People
make ethical choices on the job every day — how do you make yours? Here are
six keys to making better ethical choices:
 Evaluate circumstances through the appropriate filters. Filters include
such things as culture, laws, policies, circumstances, relationships, 
politics, perception, emotions, values, bias, and religion.
 Treat people and issues fairly within the established boundaries. 
Fair doesn’t always mean equal.
 Hesitate before making critical decisions.
 Inform those affected by the standard/decision that has been set/made.
 Create an environment of consistency for yourself and your working
group.
 Seek counsel when any doubt is present (from those who are honest 
and who you respect).

It’s one thing to have a code of ethics; it’s another thing altogether to behave
ethically in all your day-to-day business transactions and relationships. Each
individual comes into a workplace with a unique sense of ethical values, based
on upbringing and life experiences. In addition to the ethics that people bring
with them, organizations and their leaders are responsible for setting an 
example of high ethical standards.
Examining Management Trends 
in Business Today
Who says that you can’t teach an old dog new tricks? The past decade 
has been a revolutionary one for managers in every industry, all around the
world. Although the classic definition of management — plan, organize, lead,
and control — still reflects the basics of what managers do, there’s now much
more to the job. It seems as though every month you hear about a hot, new
management trend or fad, based on some best-selling business book. Do the
phrases “total quality management,” “business process re-engineering,” or
perhaps “the learning organization” ring a bell?
All those trends were hot at one time but today have cooled off significantly.
After all, management consultants and the press are constantly in the hunt
for the next big idea — or the next old idea that gets repackaged with new
buzz words to grab attention in a very jaded world. The following sections
describe some of the most prominent management trends at work today —
the ones that are built to last (at least until the next edition of this book!).
Corporate transparency
The idea of corporate transparency is taking hold in the world of business.
Corporate transparency means disclosing more information on the inner work-
ings of a business, in a quicker fashion and to a wider audience than before.
This movement is partly driven by the following factors:
 The string of high-profile corporate ethical implosions during the past
decade
 New laws such as Sarbanes-Oxley (see Chapter 10)
 The power of the Internet to instantly transmit anyone’s deepest, darkest
secrets around the world (in the form of e-mail messages, blog postings,
specific Web sites, and more)
Although some information — for example, personnel information — must by
law remain confidential, the idea of corporate transparency is for businesses
to be more open and forthcoming with stakeholders and with the public.
109
Chapter 6: Managing Is Hard; Leading Is Even Harder

Public companies are required to make significant disclosures under the rules
of Sarbanes-Oxley, but private companies should consider some common dis-
closures as well (you can check out Sarbanes-Oxley For Dummies, by Jill Gilbert
Welytok [Wiley], for more info). Some of the more common approaches 
companies take to become more transparent include:
 Disclosure of senior executive pay and benefits packages
 Instituting codes of conduct and related training programs
 Prohibiting firms from providing both management consulting and audit
services
 Establishing an independent board to ensure compliance with laws
(such as Sarbanes-Oxley), codes of conduct, and ethical standards
 Punishing employees who submit misleading reports
Although some companies and managers welcome transparency — convinced
that their customers will respond favorably to their efforts — others aren’t 
yet persuaded. They’re worried that too much transparency will damage their
competitive advantages in the marketplace. Whatever the case, only time will
tell if transparency is a trend that will stick around.
Entrepreneurial leadership
There’s a new kind of leader in town: the entrepreneurial leader. An entrepre-
neurial leader creates new opportunities in his or her business and assembles
the resources necessary — money, people, and organization — to successfully
exploit these opportunities. Entrepreneurial leaders think like entrepreneurs;
that is, they
 Are comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty.
 Have self-discipline and tenacity.
 Are not afraid to fail.
 Believe that they alone control their destiny.
 Are opportunity-focused and innovative.
Plain-old, vanilla leaders can no longer keep up in fast-changing business mar-
kets. Entrepreneurial leadership brings new perspectives and opportunities 
to businesses that thought they had already exhausted every chance to move
ahead of the pack. The risks may be higher — loss of resources and competi-
tive advantage — but so are the rewards. For more on entrepreneurship, see
Chapter 3.

Work–life balance
If you’re a reader who works in the United States, do you feel as though you’re
working harder than ever? There’s a good chance that this is more than just a
feeling. Truth be told, U.S. workers put in more time on the job than employ-
ees in most other industrialized countries — an average of 1,978 hours a year.
By contrast, Australian, Canadian, Japanese, and Mexican employees work
about 100 hours — or 2.5 weeks — less each year. British workers manage to
make do with 200 hours less a year, and German workers log 500 fewer hours
a year. With busier family lives and increased demands on their time outside
of work, it’s no surprise that more and more American workers are clamoring
for a better work–life balance.
Many employers are responding by instituting programs and policies specifi-
cally designed to bring about a better work–life balance. Such programs include
flexible work schedules, telecommuting, job sharing, compressed workweeks,
and much more. According to fans of improved work–life balance, companies
that institute these policies can expect the following benefits:
 Increased employee loyalty and commitment to their jobs
 More motivated, efficient, and effective employees
 Improved relationships between workers and managers
 Improved worker self-esteem, happiness, and health
 Decreased absenteeism
 Decreased disability and worker’s compensation claims
 Increased employee engagement and retention
With such high-profile recognition, such as Fortune magazine’s “100 Best
Companies to Work For” — which rewards companies that provide their
employees with greater opportunities for work–life balance — at stake, it
appears that this is a trend that’s here to stay. How is your organization’s
work–life balance, and what can you as a manager do to make it better?

o ahead, ask a manager what his or her toughest job is. What answer 
do you think you’ll get? Working out a new operating budget for the
upcoming fiscal year? No, probably not. Designing an assembly line for a new
manufacturing plant in Yakutsk? No, not that either. Negotiating a new wage
contract with the machinist’s union? No, not even that (although that job is
definitely no piece of cake). The toughest — and, in many ways, the most
important — job for most managers is keeping their employees motivated,
engaged in their work, and productive.
What’s so hard about that? Well, if you’ve been in business for some time,
you know that everyone is different. Some employees seem to be naturally
motivated, bouncing from task to task as though the world may end tomor-
row. These employees get things done and make things happen without any
prodding from a manager. Other employees don’t seem to be motivated at all;
they barely do the minimum required by their jobs — if they even do that.
Of course, every manager’s dream is to have a team filled with high achiev-
ers. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case. A few under-motivated employees
are bound to be in the mix — especially as your team continues to grow.
Motivating these seemingly unmotivated men and women is the real key 
to success. How do you motivate employees who aren’t motivated to begin
with, and how do you keep employees who are driven motivated? The
answers to those questions are the very essence of carrots and sticks. 
This chapter can help you answer them.

Grasping the Theories of Motivation
Why do people do what they do? Understanding personal motivation on the
job has been a source of endless speculation on the part of legions of busi-
ness theorists, academics, and social psychologists. And as any good MBA
knows, you can point out about as many theories of motivation as you can
stars in the sky.
Regardless of which particular theories of motivation they ascribe to, experts
generally agree that there are two primary sources of motivation on the job:
 Intrinsic motivation, which comes from forces within an individual.
Examples include the pride that comes from doing a job well, the satis-
faction felt when beating a deadline, and the excitement derived from
being part of a high-performing team.
 Extrinsic motivation, which comes from forces outside an individual.
Positive examples (carrots) include receiving a cash bonus for doing a
particularly good job on a project and being publicly recognized by the
boss in a staff meeting. Negative examples (sticks) include receiving a
reprimand from the boss or getting fired.
Of these two sources of motivation, most experts in the art and science of
motivation consider intrinsic motivation to be the strongest. If, for example,
you absolutely love your job and feel great satisfaction when doing it (intrinsic
motivation), a cash bonus or a pat on the back (extrinsic motivation) will have
little or no impact on your job performance — certainly not in the long run.
You’ll still be motivated to do your job anyway. Similarly, if you absolutely
hate your job, no amount of money or words of encouragement will make you
like it more or improve your performance over the long haul. Well, a million
dollars may help just a bit — but not for long!
Therefore, matching the right employees to the right jobs and setting realistic,
attainable goals are absolutely critical tasks for managers. By completing them,
you leverage the power of intrinsic motivation within each and every employee
and rely less and less on extrinsic motivation — the carrots and sticks — to
keep them engaged in their work. Every professional has a deep well of intrin-
sic motivation. It’s your job to help your employees find and tap into the well.
In the immortal words of management theorist Frederick Herzberg, “If you want
someone to do a good job, give them a good job to do.”
In the following sections, we take a close look at a variety of different theories
of motivation and consider how your employees may respond to your 
motivational efforts.
You can find no single right answer here when it comes to motivation. Each 
of the theories that follow has something to offer supervisors and managers.
The best approach is to try a variety of different approaches; experiment until
you find the approach that works best in your particular situation. Every
114
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

employee is different. You may find that one approach works best with Susan,
but another approach works best with Tom. And an entirely different approach
works with Chuck. The key is to keep trying until you hit upon an approach
that works best for each one of your employees.
Eyeing content theories of motivation
Content theories of motivation focus on the specific factors that stimulate,
direct, sustain, and stop behavior in individuals. In essence, content theories
of motivation answer the following question: “What specific employee needs
cause motivation?” The following sections break down different content 
theories of motivation from noted smart people.
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs
In the 1940s, Abraham Maslow organized all human needs into five different
levels — one on top of another — in the form of a pyramid (see Figure 7-1).
According to Maslow, humans strive to fulfill their lowest-order (physiologi-
cal) needs first. After we fulfill the lowest-order needs, we move up the pyra-
mid to achieve the next level (safety). The process keeps going until we reach
the top. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs — from lowest to highest — is as follows:
 Physiological: The very essentials of life: food, water, shelter, and sex.
These needs are of the highest priority, because if they’re left unfulfilled,
the very survival of the individual — and of the species — is in immediate
jeopardy. Not only that, but life would be quite boring with these needs
left unfulfilled!
 Safety: Security, protection from danger, a safe work environment, job
security, and a stable paycheck. (Funny, does anyone have a job that
provides any one of these anymore?)
 Social: The need to have social interactions with others, to be a part 
of a group or team of individuals, and to experience friendship and love.
Of course, some people spend a lot more time at the coffeemaker than
others!
 Esteem: The need to feel good about yourself and the work that you do.
You want your contributions to be worthwhile and to have the respect
of others. If you’re a manager, here’s a question for you: What have you
done to build an employee’s self-esteem lately?
 Self-actualization: The human desire for a sense of purpose. As the 
highest-order need in Maslow’s hierarchy, it’s achieved only after all
other needs are satisfied. Based on our experience, this need can be 
a challenging level to attain, indeed.
115
Chapter 7: Carrots and Sticks: The ABCs of Motivating Employees

Unfortunately, even though Maslow’s hierarchy sounds good on paper (and
the pyramid looks really cool), it hasn’t been borne out in the real world of
business. Do employees really work their way up the pyramid systematically,
step by step? No. And sometimes they fall back or skip a level or two. In addi-
tion, research shows that although lower-order needs become less important
as people satisfy them, higher-order needs don’t decline in importance as
people satisfy them — in fact, the importance of higher-order needs may
actually increase after initial satisfaction.
Despite all that, the application of Maslow’s work to business has had a very
positive influence on management practice. The theory helps managers realize
that workers aren’t simply machines that they can turn on and off (we’re not
talking about the copy machine); employees are living, breathing people with
needs and aspirations of their own. And this is something that managers, even
today, sometimes forget.
Herzberg’s two-factor theory
Management theorist Frederick Herzberg proposed a unique approach to the
theory of motivation, based on an extensive study of engineers and accoun-
tants in the 1950s. Herzberg determined that you can classify the factors that
influence employee behavior on the job into one of two categories:
 Hygiene factors: These factors don’t relate to brushing your teeth or
taking a shower; they relate to the environment external to the job itself.
They include salary, work environment, job security, company policies
and administration, relationships with peers, and relationships with
supervisors. These factors directly influence the level of an employee’s
dissatisfaction with his or her job. The absence of sufficient hygiene

116

factors can lead to employee turnover, absenteeism, burnout, and even
outright sabotage. However, when hygiene factors are available in suffi-
cient amounts, increasing their presence has little or no positive impact
on employee motivation.
 Motivators: These items relate to the job itself. They include personal
responsibility, achievement, challenges, advancement, professional
growth, recognition, and the interest level of the work itself. These fac-
tors directly influence the level of an employee’s satisfaction with his 
or her job. When motivators are insufficient, employees become less
motivated; as the amount of motivators increases, employees become
more motivated.
Herzberg showed that job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction are rooted in 
two completely separate sets of factors. Before Herzberg, management theo-
rists assumed that employees were, above all, motivated by money. (Gee, more
than 50 years later, most managers still think that’s the case. Wrong!) A lack of
money leads to dissatisfaction with one’s job, but giving an employee profes-
sional growth opportunities, recognition for a job well done, responsibility, and
challenge — all motivators — leads to a satisfied and, therefore, motivated
employee who’s fully engaged in his or her job.
As a result of Herzberg’s work, managers know that they can increase
employee motivation by increasing motivators. Primarily, they should focus
on the structure of employee jobs — how work is arranged and the amount 
of control employees have over their work.
And you can increase motivation, too. Take a close look at the hygiene and
motivational factors in your workplace. Are they sufficient to keep your
employees motivated and satisfied? If not, what can you do to improve them?
If you’re not sure, you can use one tried-and-true way to find out: Ask your
employees. Most workers will be happy to tell you what kinds of things moti-
vate them and what kinds of things don’t. In fact, your employees will proba-
bly be pleased that you took the time to ask about their feelings and desires.
McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y
During the 1960s, psychologist Douglas McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y
were very popular theories of motivation. Even today, hearing a manager
referred to as either a Theory X- or Theory Y-type is a commonplace event. 
In essence, Theory X and Theory Y describe two basic sets of assumptions
that managers make about their workers:
 Theory X managers assume that workers inherently dislike work — 
that they must be coerced, directed, and closely controlled to meet the
organization’s goals. The manager believes the average worker has little
ambition, avoids responsibility, and seeks security above all else. You’ve
never thought that about any of your employees, have you? Come on,
you can be honest with us!
117
Chapter 7: Carrots and Sticks: The ABCs of Motivating Employees

 Theory Y managers assume that workers inherently like work — that
they exercise self-direction and self-control to achieve an organization’s
goals. The manager believes that under the right conditions, the average
worker not only accepts responsibility, but also seeks it out.
As you may imagine, if you’re a Theory X manager, you’ll treat your employees
far differently than someone who’s a Theory Y manager. A Theory X manager
operates in a task-oriented style, focused on directing employees and coercing
them to complete assigned tasks. A Theory Y manager operates in a people-
oriented style, focused on building trust, empowerment, and autonomy.
Is one style better than the other? The answer depends on different factors:
When you have a new employee — one who’s just learning the ropes 
of a new job — the Theory X, directive style of motivation, is better.
As an employee matures and is able to do the job without day-to-day
supervision, the Theory Y, supportive style, is better.
The best managers are able to adjust their styles to match the needs of 
their employees. As a manager, what kinds of assumptions do you make about
your employees? How do those assumptions color your approach to manag-
ing them? How do your employees react to the way you treat them — are they
more or less motivated? The answers to these questions and others like them
will help you understand whether you lean toward Theory X or Theory Y.
Ouchi’s Theory Z
During the 1980s, business professor William Ouchi developed a motivation
theory based on his study of the characteristics of Japanese business man-
agers. Ouchi’s Theory Z takes Theory Y’s assertion that employees desire
responsibility (see the previous section) one step further. Theory Z determines
that organizations should empower employees to participate in the kinds of
decision making formerly reserved solely for managers.
For some reason (we can’t imagine why), many managers at first weren’t 
very excited about giving up power to their employees. In fact, some had to 
be dragged kicking and screaming to get with the program. But, indeed, it
seems that Ouchi had it right. Self-managing work teams — which give employ-
ees authority to manage themselves and their work without executive inter
ference — are a given in many businesses today, and they’re making organiza-
tions much faster and much more flexible — essential in a business world
that’s running on Internet time. Today, the Theory Z workplace is rapidly
becoming the norm rather than the exception. (For more on teamwork and
employee empowerment, check out Chapter 9.)

Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

Identifying process theories of motivation
Process theories of motivation are different from content theories (big surprise
there, eh?). Instead of focusing on employee needs, as content theories do (see
the previous sections), process theories of motivation focus on how behavior is
stimulated, directed, sustained, and stopped. In other words, process theories
explain how motivation occurs — or at least they try to explain how motivation
occurs. The following sections break down the different process theories of
motivation.
Equity theory
According to social psychologist J. Stacy Adams, employees constantly 
compare the fairness of their work outcomes to the work outcomes of others
in similar positions. If you’ve ever talked to an employee who didn’t get a
raise when a coworker did, you know exactly what we’re talking about here!
In general, employees are concerned not only about the absolute amount of
an outcome — say, the amount of a pay raise given concurrently with the
annual performance appraisal — but also about the amount relative to
coworkers and peers in the geographic area or across an entire industry.
This, in a nutshell, is the equity theory.
The following model illustrates this relationship:
Employee’s rewards
Others’ rewards
compared to
Employee’s efforts
Others’ efforts
As long as the ratio of the employee’s rewards to effort expended is close to
the ratio of other people’s rewards to effort expended, the employee perceives
equity and is most likely to be satisfied. And that’s what every manager wants:
happy employees!
However, if the employee’s ratio of rewards to effort expended is significantly
less than other people’s, the employee perceives a negative inequity and
takes steps to restore equity. This isn’t a good thing. Why? Because the steps
taken to restore equity can conflict with and even damage the overall goals of
the business. Some of these steps may include the following:
 Decreasing the quality and quantity of his or her work
 Asking for a transfer to another supervisor or department
 Quitting
119
Chapter 7: Carrots and Sticks: The ABCs of Motivating Employees

Similarly, if the employee’s ratio of rewards to effort expended is significantly
greater than what he or she sees in other people, he or she perceives a posi-
tive inequity and will take steps to restore equity. This time, however, the
steps taken are likely to be consistent with and supportive of the employee’s
efforts to achieve company goals. Employees often take the following steps to
restore equity in this situation:
 Increase the quality and quantity of work
 Request more work
 Ask for more responsibility
In any case, wise managers are sensitive to their employees and their percep-
tions of equity — and inequity — on the job. If your employees are disgruntled,
you can bet that they have good reason. Your job as a student of the mysteri-
ous art and science of motivation is to figure out why. To get to the root of the
problem, talk to your employees about it and then see what you can do to
remove the sources of perceptions of inequity. Communication is key — just 
do it!
Expectancy theory
During the 1960s, Yale professor Victor Vroom was the first to apply E.C.
Tolman’s expectancy theory of motivation (developed in the 1930s) to the
workplace. According to Vroom’s application of the expectancy theory, the
probability of an employee taking a specific action depends on
 The strength of the expectation that the action will lead to a given 
outcome
 The attractiveness of that outcome to the employee
Under this expectancy theory, the motivational force (MF) within an employee
is represented as
MF = Expectancy × Instrumentality × Valence
In the preceding formula, Expectancy is the belief that an employee’s effort
will result in the attainment of desired performance goals. Instrumentality is
the belief that if the employee gains desired performance goals, he or she will
be rewarded for doing so. Valence is the value that he or she personally
places on the expected reward.
The expectancy theory has been used to explain a variety of employee 
behaviors, including leadership effectiveness, turnover, absenteeism, career
choice, and more. It can be a very effective tool to help managers understand
why employees behave the way they do. For instance, for employees to be
motivated, they must believe that not only can they achieve a desired level 
of performance, but also that doing so will lead to a desired reward. If either 
120
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

of those pieces is missing in your organization, your employees won’t be
motivated to perform at the high level that you expect of them.
Take a close look at your organization and ask yourself these three questions:
 Are your goals realistic and achievable, or are they placed too high
above your employees’ ability to achieve them?
 Do you make rewards available for employees who achieve these goals?
 Do the employees find the rewards desirable?
Do your research, and if you say no to any of these questions, you can’t
expect your employees to be motivated until you fix the broken links. Roll up
your sleeves and get busy! (For more on rewards, check out the later sections
of this chapter.)
If you’ve read all the theories so far, stick with us — we’re getting close to 
the end of our list! Go grab a cup of coffee and stretch your legs for a minute.
There, that’s better. If you just picked out this one, you should be well rested.

Behavior modification
Okay, for this section, we have to get all scientific on you, so fasten your 
seatbelts and return your tray tables to their upright and locked position.
Ready? Behavior modification states that external consequences determine
an employee’s behavior. This process theory is rooted in psychologist B.F.
Skinner’s pioneering work in operant conditioning (unless you were asleep
during the video, all you psychology majors will remember the famous
Skinner Box, with its food pellets and electrified floor used to modify the
behavior of laboratory rats and wayward workers). The business application
of Skinner’s theory uses various methods of reinforcement to modify behav-
ior through that behavior’s consequences. Reinforcement means any stimulus
that makes a behavior more likely to occur.
Types of behavior modification reinforcement
Under behavior modification, four different kinds of reinforcement exist —
each with a different outcome:
 Positive reinforcement: Strengthening a behavior by applying a pleasant
consequence. When an employee gets a word of congratulations from her
boss for meeting a sales goal, she’s receiving positive reinforcement from
her boss. As a result, the employee is more likely to meet sales goals in
the future, which is a good thing.
 Negative reinforcement: Strengthening a behavior by removing an
unpleasant consequence — also known as avoidance learning. When
employees show up on time for a staff meeting to avoid a reprimand
from their supervisor, negative reinforcement has entered the picture.
121
Chapter 7: Carrots and Sticks: The ABCs of Motivating Employees

 Punishment: Weakening a behavior by applying an unpleasant conse-
quence. When an employee receives a reprimand for breaking a company
policy, he or she receives punishment. A reprimanded employee is less
likely to break company policy in the future.
Most managers tend to focus more on these sticks of motivation rather
than the carrots of positive reinforcement. Doing so is a mistake, because
positive reinforcement works and doesn’t come with the negative conse-
quences that often result from the application of punishment (resentment,
anger, and so forth).
 Extinction: Weakening a behavior with the application of a neutral conse-
quence, or not following the behavior with a pleasant consequence. For
example, suppose that an employee puts in several weekends of extra
work to meet a customer deadline. If that employee’s boss fails to reward
or even acknowledge the behavior, the employee will be less likely to
devote weekends to meeting customer deadlines in the future. Eventually,
absent some other motivator, the behavior will die away altogether.
Partial reinforcement versus continuous reinforcement
The frequency with which you reinforce behavior influences the effectiveness
of behavior modification. Continuous reinforcement occurs when you reinforce
behavior after every correct response. When you reinforce a behavior after
some responses but not after others, partial reinforcement develops.
When applying a partial-reinforcement schedule, you have two major
options:
 Vary the frequency of the reward according to the rate of response, which
is called a ratio schedule. The timing of the reinforcement is irrelevant.
 Vary the frequency of the reward strictly according to time intervals,
which is called an interval schedule. The number of responses that occur
after the first correct response in an interval is irrelevant.
You can choose between four basic partial-reinforcement schedules — 
all others are combinations or variations of these basic four:
 Fixed ratio (FR): Reinforcement occurs after a fixed number of
responses. For example, an employee receives a reward from his boss
every third time he completes his work on time.
 Variable ratio (VR): Reinforcement occurs after a variable number of
responses. For example, an employee receives a reward from her boss
once every five times, on average, that she gets a letter of thanks from a
customer. Sometimes it may be one in five, sometimes one in four, and
sometimes one in six.
122
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

 Fixed interval (FI): Reinforcement occurs on the first response after a
fixed time interval has passed. For example, a boss rewards an employee
exactly 15 minutes after he or she arrives to work on time.
 Variable interval (VI): Reinforcement occurs on the first response after 
a variable time interval has passed. For example, a boss rewards an
employee one week, on average, after the employee submits her expense
report on time — sometimes five days, sometimes nine days, and so on.
Over time, partial-reinforcement schedules are much more effective at causing
desired behavior than continuous schedules, which reward employees every
time they perform the behavior. They’re also much more resistant to change or
extinction. Why? When you give rewards on a continuous schedule, employees
will begin to take them for granted. In the words of behavioral scientists, they
habituate to the stimulus, meaning the stimulus has progressively less impact
on their behavior. The rewards, in other words, have a diminishing effect on
behavior. (Check out the nearby sidebar, “Vary the awards you give” for some
examples.)
A boring rewards and recognition program is a recognition program that isn’t
working; shake it up! The following section dives much deeper into rewards.

Chapter 7: Carrots and Sticks: The ABCs of Motivating Employees
Vary the awards you give
By introducing an element of surprise and novelty
into the reward process, partial-reinforcement
schedules help rewards maintain their potency
for long periods of time. The best managers con-
stantly vary the rewards that they give their
employees, as well as the circumstances under
which they give them. For example, at Seattle-
based law firm Perkins Coie, an employee-run
happiness committee keeps the firm’s employees
on their toes by varying the rewards given, as
well as their frequency. Some of the committee’s
employee-recognition events have included the
following:
 A sack-lunch field trip across Puget Sound
on a ferry. The trip required employees to
bring permission slips signed by coworkers
allowing them to attend.
 An Earth Day celebration. Department
employees received plants, bags of dirt, and
fertilizer; a prize was awarded to the person
who could do the best job growing the
plant. (One unexpected benefit: Employees
asked one another about the plants. Said
one employee, “I don’t know if I’d ever have
talked to some of these people before.
These kinds of things really break down the
barriers.”)
 An end-of-summer barbecue, in Seattle’s
famous liquid sunshine (rain), on the 48th-
floor deck of the building (which also hap-
pened to be under construction at the time).
 A Veterans Day celebration, at which 35
coworkers honored their department’s five
veterans with a potluck lunch, cake, and
festive red, white, and blue balloons.

You Get What You Reward
We’ll let you in on a little business secret — a secret that can make your life as
a supervisor or manager much easier and the results of your employees much
better. If you were enrolled in an MBA program right now, you’d have to pay
thousands to learn this secret. But because you decided to plunk down your
hard-earned cash for this book instead, we give it to you for free:
You get what you reward.
Bob Nelson, co-author with Peter on both Managing For Dummies and
Consulting For Dummies (Wiley), coined this phrase more than a decade ago.
And it’s true — if you dangle rewards so people strive to achieve their goals,
they very likely will do just that. Conversely, if you don’t reward people when
they achieve their goals, they’re less likely to do so. In fact, they may not even
bother to try to achieve them.
This section gives you the lowdown on rewarding your employees, including
when and how to do so.
In a perfect world, perhaps rewarding and recognizing employee effort 
wouldn’t be necessary. If all employees were 100 percent intrinsically moti-
vated in their jobs (wouldn’t that be nice!), you wouldn’t need to dangle the
carrots of rewards and recognition. However, the world isn’t perfect. Most
managers will see immediate and positive results when they initiate a program
of regular and systematic rewards and recognition.
The good and bad news about rewards
The good news is that the most effective employee rewards cost little or no
money. A study of 1,500 employees — conducted by Dr. Gerald Graham, man-
agement professor at Wichita State University — reported the following top
five employee motivators:
1. Personal (oral) thanks from one’s manager
2. Written thanks from one’s manager
3. Promotion for performance
4. Public praise
5. Morale-building meetings
The bad news is that few managers reward their employees often, and many
don’t bother at all. When Dr. Graham asked the study group of 1,500 employ-
ees to report how often they received the top five employee motivators listed
previously, the results were shocking:
124
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

 58 percent seldom, if ever, received personal thanks from their managers.
 76 percent seldom, if ever, received written thanks from their managers.
 78 percent seldom, if ever, received promotions based on performance.
 81 percent seldom, if ever, received public praise in the workplace.
 92 percent seldom, if ever, participated in morale-building meetings.
Here’s a quote from Mac Anderson, founder and former CEO of Successories,
Inc. — a leader in the employee motivation and self-improvement industry,
located in Lombard, Illinois:
“A recognition culture literally has to start at the top. The guy at the top
has to believe in it, has to bring the managers together to create a recog-
nition culture. The key is the manager of each department, who has to do
things that make employees feel important. It’s a basic human need. Most
managers don’t recognize that.”
Starting up an employee recognition program doesn’t have to be difficult, and
it doesn’t require a big budget. In fact, it can be quite simple and inexpensive
(can you say, free?). Oh, and you can start today!
The four keys to effective rewards 
and recognition programs
Interestingly enough, many managers think that they reward and recognize
their employees plenty — perhaps even too much — when, in reality, they
don’t even come close to being adequate. In some cases, managers don’t
bother to reward and recognize their employees’ good efforts. In other cases,
managers do try to give rewards and recognition, but they do it in the wrong
manner. When a manager doesn’t give a reward in an effective manner, the
message is lost on the employee to whom it was directed. And if the message
is lost, as far as the employee is concerned, he or she hasn’t been rewarded
for his or her good work.
You can do your part to make your employee rewards and recognition program
effective — regardless of what kinds of rewards and recognition you decide to
apply in specific situations. Follow these four keys:
 When you reward an employee for a certain behavior, be sure that the
reward is clearly linked to that behavior. For example, make a big deal
about an employee landing a new account by presenting him or her a
bonus check in your weekly staff meeting. As a part of the presentation,
be sure to explain that the employee is receiving the bonus for bringing
in the new account, and remind the others that similar behavior on their
parts will bring a similar reward. By doing so, you reinforce the behavior
125
Chapter 7: Carrots and Sticks: The ABCs of Motivating Employees

of not only the employee who gets the reward, but also the other employ-
ees at the meeting. And think about the impact you’ll have if you print a
story about the presentation along with a photograph in your company
employee newsletter!
 Give the reward sincerely. Employees know when you’re giving sincere
thanks and when you’re faking it. If they sense that you aren’t being 
sincere in your thanks, they’ll discount what you say or do or — even
worse — will be insulted by it. Give rewards and recognition only when
you feel that your employees deserve it, but don’t hesitate to do so when
the situation merits. There’s no such thing as too much praise — unless
the praise is insincere.
 Give the reward in a positive tone. Good rewards and positive recogni-
tion given in an encouraging manner is what you’re shooting for. Rewards
should be positive and uplifting. They should highlight the behavior that
you want more of and inspire employees to strive to become even better
in the future.
Don’t ever, ever immediately follow praise with a reprimand. You know,
the old hug and slap in the face. For instance, “Thanks, Sherry, you han-
dled that irate customer perfectly, but I’m really upset that you made five
spelling errors in this report.” The employee will immediately discount
your praise, and your long-term relationship with the employee will be
diminished. If you keep repeating this approach with the employee, he 
or she will soon be looking for a new place to work.
 Give the reward as close to the event as possible. To have maximum
impact, give rewards and recognition immediately after the behavior you
want to reinforce. However, because that isn’t always possible, be sure
that whatever the reward is — praise, cash, a gift certificate, a trip to
Hawaii — you give it out no more than a few days to a couple weeks
after the event.
At all costs, avoid relying only on an annual awards ceremony to hand
out all employee rewards and recognition. Unfortunately, for all the
excitement, glitz, and glamour of an annual awards banquet or ceremony,
much of the impact is lost when you give out rewards months after the
behaviors you want to reinforce actually occur.
Informal rewards and recognition
Rewards fit into two categories: informal and formal. The best employee
rewards and recognition programs offer a mix of both.
Informal rewards and recognition are just that — spontaneous, requiring 
little or no planning and generally costing little or nothing. Company policies
and procedures often choke formal rewards and recognition efforts (see the
following section), but they don’t constrain informal rewards, which can be
given spontaneously as the behaviors occur. They can be incredibly effective
126
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

because they demonstrate that managers (or the employee’s peers, if one
employee gives the reward to another) really care about them — enough to
take the time and effort to recognize the employee’s good work.
The following list presents a few terrific examples of informal rewards and
recognition in organizational settings:
 Managers at Seattle, Washington-based Nordstrom department stores
shared letters submitted by customers about exemplary employee 
service. They read them over the store intercom systems before the stores
opened in the morning. The managers then posted the letters on the
employee bulletin boards for all to read.
 At Apple Computer in Cupertino, California, all employees who worked
on the design and development of the original Macintosh computer had
their signatures engraved on the inside of the production model’s case.
 A group of employees at the Milne & Craighead division of CF Canada —
an international transportation logistics firm located in Calgary, Alberta —
sponsored an impromptu two-day golf tournament. Held inside the com-
pany’s headquarters building, the event rewarded employees for their
long-term hard work. The 18-hole course, which wound its way through-
out the building, was complete with real grass greens, water hazards,
refreshment stops for thirsty players, and a variety of prizes and trophies.
 At Tennant Company — a manufacturer of industrial and commercial floor
maintenance equipment and floor coatings in Minneapolis, Minnesota —
employees awarded other employees with a “koala-tee bear” award for
showing commitment to quality. The award was a stuffed toy koala bear
wearing a hard hat emblazoned with the Tennant logo. Recipients proudly
displayed the bears in their work areas as visible demonstrations of their
personal commitment to quality.
 When an engineer at Palo Alto, California-based electronics giant Hewlett-
Packard announced to his manager that he’d just found the solution 
to a particularly tough problem, the manager fumbled for some item to
acknowledge the accomplishment. The result? He handed over a banana
from his lunch bag. This simple gesture soon became immortalized as the
Golden Banana Award — a highly sought after, informal award given to
employees by their peers.
Only your imagination limits informal rewards and recognition. As Hewlett-
Packard’s example shows, it isn’t so much the award itself that has meaning —
it’s the thought behind it.
Formal rewards and recognition
Formal rewards and recognition programs are the norm in most organi-
zations — even those that have a strong culture of informal recognition. 
127
Chapter 7: Carrots and Sticks: The ABCs of Motivating Employees

The programs are regular (weekly, monthly, or annual), subject to very spe-
cific criteria or rules, and often involve tangible rewards or things of value.
You’ve no doubt seen formal recognition at work in your organization. Here
are a few examples:
 Employee-of-the-month awards
 Certificates of achievement
 Cash awards for cost savings
 Years-of-service pins
 Stock options
A two-year study of formal rewards programs in 15 federal agencies, conducted
by the Office of Personnel Management, found mixed employee opinions about
the programs. However, the study did find agreement on what employees like,
and the lessons learned from this study can help you create a highly effective
program of formal rewards and recognition in your organization.
The study reported that employees prefer the following:
 Peer involvement in designing and evaluating rewards programs, nominat-
ing individuals for awards, reviewing nominations, and recommending
reward amounts
 On-the-spot rewards because they’re timelier and are not based on
appraisal ratings that have low credibility
 Group/team rewards, where the predominant mode of getting the work
done is through formal and informal teams (see Chapter 9)
 Standard formulas for determining rewards budgets and individual
reward amounts
 Prestigious honorary rewards to recognize extraordinary professional 
or personal efforts that best represent the organization’s values and that
reflect nicely on the organization, its mission, and its workforce
 Public recognition to demonstrate management’s support and confidence
in the validity of the rewards decisions and to reassure everyone that
deserving employees will be rewarded for high performance in the future
The study also recommended a variety of strategies for improving formal
rewards programs:
 Link performance recognition programs and decisions to strategic 
plans, goals, and results.
 Establish balanced, flexible recognition programs that feature a variety 
of group and individual rewards instead of focusing on one or two types 
of rewards.
128
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

 Consider making more use of competitive and prestigious non-monetary
(honorary) rewards, with provisions for peer nomination and peer
involvement.
 Improve publicity about individual reward recipients and rewards 
program activity.
 Publish and disseminate to all organizational levels annual rewards 
policies, expectations, and funding guidance for the year as soon as 
possible at the beginning of each fiscal year.
 Consider employee concerns — including inconsistency in distribution,
non-credible basis for awards, and awards given unfairly — when 
developing reward policies.
 Establish accountability systems to monitor adherence to rewards 
policies and expectations, to spot problem trends, and to identify 
opportunities for program improvement.
Be careful what you reward
You have to be very careful to reward the behavior you actually want 
in your organization. Think, for example, about a common reward given in
manufacturing plants or warehouses: the famous “Days without an Accident”
award. Although you may think you’re rewarding employees for not having
accidents — and decreasing the frequency of accidents in the process — you
may actually be rewarding employees for hiding accidents and not reporting
them when they occur. This behavior ends up resulting in even more acci-
dents, because the conditions that caused the accidents in the first place
aren’t addressed and fixed.
Consider these alternative ideas when establishing your rewards system:
 If you want teamwork, reward collaboration rather than internal 
competition.
 If you want high performance, reward results rather than seniority.
 If you want problem solving, reward problems found and solved rather
than problems hiding.
 If you want creativity, reward creative ideas rather than conformity.
 If you want customer service, reward customer loyalty rather than a lack
of complaints.
Be aware of exactly what behaviors you want your employees to engage in
and what behaviors you’re actually rewarding. Are they one in the same? If
not, you need to correct your rewards and recognition program immediately!

Employees and Keep Them
In This Chapter

 Understanding employment law issues
E
very business in the world depends on employees to make it run and
flourish. Businesses need more than buildings and inventory stacked 
to the rafters, in countless warehouses in endless cities. And they certainly
require more than computers humming away as they direct the flow of bits
and bytes over worldwide telecommunications networks. Without people to
oversee the buildings, manage the inventory, and operate the computers,
businesses can’t exist.
In this chapter, we focus on people — your people. We explain how to find 
and hire the best people for your company, how to monitor and correct perfor-
mance, how to lay off employees when times get tough, and how to fire them if
they just don’t work out. Finally, we briefly cover some of the most important
legal issues related to dealing with employees.
Hiring and Keeping the 
Very Best Employees
Creating the very best products and services requires having the very 
best employees to produce them. And the most effective way to have 
the best employees on staff is to recruit and hire only the best. Instead 
of hiring average employees and hoping that they develop into exceptional
employees, why not take the time and effort to hire only the finest employees
from the start? This section shows you how.

Defining the available job
Before you place an advertisement in the newspaper, post a job notice on the
bulletin board at work, and submit a job opening on an Internet career-search
site, you must create a detailed job description. A job description explains the
duties and responsibilities of a particular position and defines the special
requirements or skills that the ideal candidate needs.
Here are some specific elements that every job description should contain,
regardless of the position:
 Job title: The name of a position — for example, “mailroom clerk,” 
“programmer/analyst,” or “vice president and chief bottle washer.”
 Department/division: Specifies the department or division in which the
specific position is located — for example, in the accounting department
or the operations division.
 Responsibilities: The list of responsibilities isn’t just a one- or two-
sentence summary of a job’s most important duties; it should include
every task included in the position.
Writing a complete description of a position’s responsibilities isn’t a
simple job. If you want to create a thorough job description, follow these
simple steps:
1. Ask your employees exactly what they do — every single thing. 
2. Compare your employees’ lists against what you think they should
be doing.
3. Compile your final list of responsibilities within this section in 
a narrative/paragraph format or as a bulleted list.
 Required skills/expertise: Does a person need specific skills to do 
this job — perhaps experience with spreadsheet programs or the ability
to build wooden forms for pouring concrete building foundations, for
instance? This part of the job description should include the skills,
expertise, and number of years of experience required.
 Required licenses/certifications: Some jobs require the acquisition of
specific licenses or certifications. Messengers most likely need to have
valid driver’s licenses. Certain kinds of accounting positions may require
a CPA (Certified Public Accountant). Stockbrokers may need to provide a
series 7 or 63 license (or both).
Don’t put a requirement in this section unless it’s truly essential to 
doing the job. Otherwise, you may be exposing yourself (and your com-
pany) to a nasty lawsuit. Also, job descriptions that are too exact may
prompt lawsuits. Be sure that your explanations contain wording or
132
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

clauses that allow you to expand tasks as necessary. The most famous of
these clauses — “ . . . and other duties as assigned” — works for many
companies, but be sure to get advice from your legal counsel before
including this terminology.
If you’ve never prepared job descriptions before or if you just want an easy
way to deal with them, we suggest automating the process. Take a look at the
Descriptions Now! software program (www.hrtools.com; click the Products
tab) or at the online job descriptions available on the Job Results Management
Institute’s Web site (www.jrmi.com). If you’re a manager who dreads writing
performance appraisals, you’ll think you’ve died and gone to heaven after you
give either of these tools a test drive.
Paying employees what they’re worth
All people, from managers down to the entry-level workers, believe that they
deserve to be paid what they’re worth. But how do you know if each person 
in your organization is being paid what he or she is worth? One way you can
determine worth is by looking at the salaries of employees in similar positions
in your geographic area or by determining the relative value of your employees’
contributions to your organization.
Paying employees what they’re worth is particularly important when the job
market is tight and unemployment is low. If you aren’t offering competitive
pay rates and salaries, you’ll have a tough time attracting the best employees
to your firm — and keeping them. Other elements of an overall compensation
package — such as health benefits, retirement plans, and stock options —
also are important and can enter into a candidate’s decision about whether
to accept a job offer, so you can’t forget to include them.
So how do you figure out how much to pay your employees? First, you want to
develop an overall compensation philosophy for your organization. This phi-
losophy will become the guide for compensation decisions for all your employ-
ees. In his book Human Resources Kit For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley), Harold
“Max” Messmer, Jr., lists the following five considerations that you must take
into account when developing your organization’s compensation philosophy:
 Are you going to make your basic salaries simply competitive with the
going rate for employers in your area or higher?
 Are you going to establish a structured pay scale for specific jobs in
your company, or are you going to set salaries on an individual basis,
based on the qualities and potential of the person filling the job?
 To what extent are the monetary rewards you offer your employees
going to take the form of salary, performance bonuses, or benefits?
133
Chapter 8: Hiring and Firing: How to Get Good Employees and Keep Them

 Are salaries based on how well people perform or on other factors, such
as how long they stay with you or what credentials they bring to the job?
 Are you going to award bonuses on the basis of individual performance,
tie bonuses to company results, or use a combination of the two?
After you’ve developed an overall compensation philosophy, you can decide
how much to pay your employees. For example, if you want to base salaries 
on the going rates within your geographical area, your first step is to do a wage
survey to determine exactly what those going rates are for each position within
your organization. Wage information is available from a variety of sources,
including the Internet, state employment offices, chambers of commerce, local
business newspapers and magazines, and employment consulting firms.
Understanding the hiring process
It would be nice if you could simply snap your fingers and automatically hire
the best and brightest employees whenever you wanted them, but the process
isn’t quite that simple. In fact, if you’re serious about hiring the best employ-
ees to work in your firm, the hiring process is a lot of work. But the good news
is that the rewards of making a good hire are tremendous and long-lasting.
These rewards include
 Increased productivity
 Improved morale
 Better customer satisfaction
 Increased revenues
 Increased profit
In the following sections, we explain the key steps in the hiring process and
offer advice on how to conduct the process the right way, every time.
Finding the best of the best
Where do you go to find the very best employees? To some extent, the answer
depends on the kind of position you have to fill and the kind of candidates
you’re seeking. To increase the chances of getting your message in front of the
right people, first decide what kind of person you want to hire and then choose
the most effective method for communicating your opportunity to that person.
You can choose from a variety of ways to advertise a job opportunity to a tar-
geted set of candidates. Here are some of the most commonly used methods:
 The Internet: The Internet has exploded as a resource for those seeking
work and for those doing the hiring. Hundreds of Web sites cater to
people seeking and offering jobs. Many such Web sites are specific to 
134
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

different kinds of opportunities — for example, information technology,
purchasing, or sales. Here are some of the most well-established 
job-hunting sites:
• Monster (www.monster.com)
• Jobs.com (www.jobs.com)
• CareerBuilder (www.careerbuilder.com)
• Jobs.net (www.jobs.net)
• Craigslist (www.craigslist.org)
• Indeed (www.indeed.com)
• Guru.com (www.guru.com)
 Newspaper advertisement (want ads): The newspaper is traditionally the
first place where employers think of looking for new employees, and it’s
often the first place that job seekers go to look for new employers. But is
placing an advertisement in your local newspaper the optimum way to
find the people you’re looking for? Maybe yes, maybe no. Perhaps the best
candidate for the job will see your advertisement, but you may miss many
other terrific candidates, both locally and outside of your immediate geo-
graphic area.
 Business and personal networks: You have networks of contacts, both in
your business and in your personal life. Your friends and professional con-
tacts can be excellent sources of job candidates. People in your networks
know about your business and the kind of people you want, so they’re
unlikely to send you candidates who would reflect badly on them.
 Associations: You can find all kinds of industry and professional associa-
tions out there — from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM),
to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), to the American
Bar Association (ABA). Each one has its own specialized membership
population. Most associations have their own job referral services, which
they offer to their members as a free benefit of membership. Many associ-
ations also post job listings on their Web sites, which may be available
only to association members as a benefit of membership.
 Employment agencies: Although you may be required to pay to use their
services, employment agencies (including temporary agencies, executive
search firms, and so-called “headhunting firms”) can be terrific sources
of job candidates. Many companies use temporary agencies to try out
new employees on a short-term, risk-free basis. If a temporary employee
doesn’t work out, your organization can simply send the employee back
to the agency and ask for another person. If a temporary employee does
work out, you can hire the person directly from the agency, sometimes
for no fee.
135
Chapter 8: Hiring and Firing: How to Get Good Employees and Keep Them

Be careful when using employment agencies. Some agencies prohibit 
a company from hiring a temporary employee for a specified period of
time after his or her temporary employment stint, or if they do permit it,
they may charge an exorbitant fee to do so.
 Inside your organization: One of the best sources of top-quality job can-
didates is looking within your own organization. The beauty of internal
candidates is that you usually can get very candid references on their
job performance from their coworkers and past and present supervi-
sors. Another plus is that internal candidates are familiar with company
policies and procedures. As a result, they can transition into their new
positions quickly. Don’t overlook this rich resource of job candidates.
Recruiting is very much a numbers game. The larger your pool of candidates,
the greater your chance of finding the employee who’s just right for your orga-
nization. Unless you’re specifically targeting only one candidate or a small
group of candidates, cast your recruiting net as widely as you possibly can.
The time, money, and effort you put into finding the best candidates up front
will pay off after you make the hire.
Interviewing candidates
The interview is one of the most critical — and often the most dreaded — 
parts of the hiring process. For job candidates, the interview presents an
opportunity to answer detailed questions about their experience and to give
their potential employer a glimpse of what kind of employees they will be. For
employers, the interview presents a unique opportunity to ask questions that
go beyond the one-sided marketing pitch of most résumés and gets a feel for
how candidates would fit into the organization.
From the employer perspective, here are the three main reasons for 
interviewing job candidates:
 To get further in-depth information about a candidate’s work skills and
experience — straight from the job seeker’s mouth. This process gives
you the opportunity to see whether what the candidate tells you is 
consistent with his or her résumé.
 To assess the candidate’s personality and determine how that personality
will fit into your existing work team.
 To test on a real-time basis a candidate’s enthusiasm, intelligence, poise,
and ability to think quickly.
You can’t guarantee that someone who shines during an interview will work
out as a new hire. Every manager has tales of stellar interviewees who got the
jobs but didn’t last long. However, a well-done interview will greatly increase
your chances of landing the best candidate for the job.
Here are some tips on conducting an effective interview:
136
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

 Welcome the applicant and put him or her at ease. Most job applicants
are more than a little nervous when interviewing for a job, and it’s no
wonder — job interviews often make or break candidates. Conduct the
interview in a quiet office or conference room that’s free of interruption
from phones, computers, and other employees. Greet the candidate
warmly; offer coffee, water, or a soft drink; and direct him or her to a
seat. Instead of launching right into the interview, spend a couple minutes
breaking the ice to take the edge off the interviewee’s nervousness.
 Summarize the position. Take a minute or two to give the candidate 
a brief summary of the position. Include details of job responsibilities;
how the job fits into the organization, reporting relationships, and
expected customer interactions (see the earlier section “Defining the
available job”).
 Ask a variety of questions. In his book What Color Is Your Parachute? (Ten
Speed Press), author Richard Nelson Bolles suggests asking questions that
fall into any one of four categories:
• Why are you here?
• What can you do for us?
• What kind of person are you?
• Can we afford you?
Take plenty of notes during your interviews. Better yet, prepare an inter-
view form in advance to guide you through your questions and to enable
you to jot down notes on your candidates’ responses. This advice is espe-
cially important if you have a lot of candidates to interview or if you won’t
have a chance to review the candidates’ performances immediately after
the interviews.
 Probe the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses. Chances are, you
picked up on some of the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses when
you reviewed his or her résumé before the interview. Now’s the time to
probe the candidate further about those strengths and weaknesses, as
well as any others that become apparent during the interview.
 Conclude the interview on an “up” note. Ask your candidate whether 
he or she has any other information that you should consider in your
decision process. Give the candidate a chance to explain that information.
Thank the candidate for his or her interest in the job (no matter how well
or how poorly the interview went) and give the person some idea of when
you’ll be making a decision or whether you’ll be conducting an additional
round of interviews.
Don’t make any sort of promises, such as, “You’re definitely the best 
candidate — we’ll be making you an offer for sure.” Not only are you set-
ting yourself up for a potential lawsuit if you don’t follow through on your
promise, but also the next candidate you interview may be even better
than the last.

For a terrific, in-depth discussion of how to interview candidates (much more
in-depth than we have the space to present here) — as well as sample ques-
tions, interview forms, interview evaluation forms, and much, much more —
be sure to check out Harold “Max” Messmer, Jr.’s book, Human Resources Kit
For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley).
Checking references
Although many employers are wary about providing reference information
about former employees (and understandably so; some employers have been
sued for giving bad references), it’s still very much worth your time to check
out all available references. You just never know what kind of information will
turn up in your investigation; you may uncover info that will have great bearing
on whether you extend a job offer to a candidate.
Reference checks most often occur after the initial round of interviews, when
the employer narrows the list of candidates to just a few people. When you
make a reference call, don’t forget that the person you’re calling is doing you
a big favor by telling you anything at all about the candidate. Be patient,
polite, and thankful when someone provides the information you need.
Here are some of the best places to dig deeper to find out how your candidate
may fit in the job and in your company:
 Current and former supervisors

Never ask these questions in an interview
You can choose from plenty of good questions to
ask potential employees, but there are some
questions that you should never, ever ask. Why?
Primarily because in some cases, it may be
against the law to do so. In addition, certain ques-
tions have little or no relevance to a candidate’s
potential ability to do a job.
So here’s a word to the wise: Avoid at all costs ques-
tions that have anything to do with the following
topics.
 Race or skin color
 Country of origin
 Gender or sexual orientation
 Marital status
 Religious beliefs
 Arrest and conviction record
 Height and weight
 Debts
 Disability
Make sure that questions on these topics are not
a part of your company’s job application either.
Possible exceptions include questions related to
height and weight for firefighters, and similar
work-related physical requirements for other jobs.

 Networks of common acquaintances, such as industry associations 
or professional groups
 Public sources, such as the Internet or local newspapers
Increasingly popular are companies that verify a candidate’s résumé or refer-
ences for a fee. If you decide to go this route, be sure that you pick an experi-
enced, reputable firm and that you notify all candidates in advance that you’ll
be using such a service (if required to do so by your state or locality; check
with your state employment office to be sure).
Using the Internet to research candidates
Wouldn’t it be nice to get more information about your job candidates than
the 400 or 500 carefully crafted words on their résumés? Well, with the power
of the Internet at your fingertips, you may be able to do just that! The latest
generation of job seekers lives much of their lives online, so they leave online
crumbs for recruiters to track down and read. Now, you can hire investigators
to check out a job candidate’s background, but that isn’t what we’re talking
about here. We’re talking about a quick-and-easy background investigation
that you can do yourself for no cost — beyond the short amount of time it
takes you to do it.
Some sites that you can check out for personal information about potential
candidates include the following:
 www.google.com
 www.facebook.com
 www.myspace.com
 www.orkut.com
 www.linkedin.com
For example, say you have a job candidate named Nancy Tufnel who gradu-
ated from Brown University and worked for USA Today. At least that’s what
she claims on her résumé. By doing a quick search on Google, using keywords
“Nancy Tufnel” and “Brown,” you may find a number of matches related to
your job candidate — including a MySpace page, mentions on the Brown Web
site, plenty of photos and related text at a campus sorority Web site, and per-
haps even a byline on USA Today. Or you may find nothing at all (which brings
up its own set of questions).
Ranking your candidates
After you’ve completed your interviews and conducted your reference and
research checks, you must rank each of your candidates against the others.
The easiest way to rank is to put the name of each candidate along the left
side of a piece of paper and list your hiring criteria along the top of the page.
You can create a grid similar to the one in Figure 8-1 for a hypothetical group
of three candidates.
139
Chapter 8: Hiring and Firing: How to Get Good Employees and Keep Them

Rank each employee on each of the hiring criteria. In our example, Maria
ranks number one for customer service skills, while Sally ranks second and
Tom third. Go through each of your hiring criteria (you may have many more
items than our simple example does) and assign rankings in this manner.
After you’ve ranked all the candidates, add the total for each employee and
note it on the worksheet. The candidate with the lowest score is the one you
should consider hiring. In this case, it’s Maria.
Making the hire
Congratulations! Now you can make your job offer to your top candidate.
However, before you do, be sure to check your organization’s policies on
hiring new employees. Some companies allow managers to make a verbal
offer — on the phone or in person — and others insist that any job offers be
in writing. Still others insist not only that job offers be in writing, but also
that they undergo review by the human resources department or legal 
counsel before going out to candidates.
Our advice is to always use written job offers. After the written job offer is
signed and on the way to the candidate, however, we also encourage you to
call him or her with the good news. The candidate may be weighing more
than one offer, so you want to be sure your offer gets to the candidate before
any others.
Here are the key elements to include in a written offer letter:
 Job title
 The candidate’s name
 Date employment will start
 Terms on which employment is offered (salary, full-time versus part-time,
probationary period, and so on)

Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

 Any conditions that must be met before hire can be made (pre-
employment physical, drug test, evidence of U.S. citizenship, and so on)
 Any action required by the candidate (make appointment with company
drug-testing lab, sign and return offer letter, and so on)
If, for some reason, your top candidate declines the offer, you have three
main choices:
 You can revise your offer to answer the objections of your top candidate.
 You can go to the next-ranked candidate on your worksheet.
 You can initiate the entire hiring process all over again.
You need to weigh the pluses and minuses of each avenue. For instance, if you
have just one strong candidate and your positions aren’t too far apart, revising
the offer may make more sense than offering the job to a weaker candidate or
starting the hiring process all over again.
Don’t allow desperation to rule your hiring decisions. Leaving a position
unfilled usually is better than hiring an inferior candidate. If your first round
of recruiting and interviews doesn’t uncover the right candidate for the job,
by all means try it again. It’s far less painful to interview more candidates
than to terminate someone who doesn’t work out the way you hoped.
Structuring your new employee’s 
first day at work
The first few days and weeks of work for your new employee can be both
exciting and disorienting. No matter how much experience a new hire may
have under his or her belt, starting a new job, to some extent, means starting
from scratch. And when you add in a new office, new coworkers, and entirely
new relationships, policies, and procedures to sort out, you have a recipe for
instant confusion.
You can help make your new hire’s transition into your organization relatively
painless and quick. Here are some tips on how to make your new employee’s
first day at work productive and easy:
 Make your new hire feel welcome. Set plenty of time aside for your new
employee. Be sure that others who will supervise or be supervised by the
new employee also allot some time for interaction. Nothing is worse for 
a new employee than to be shoved aside for hours (or days or weeks)
because no one can spare a few hours of time to help welcome a new
member of the team.
141
Chapter 8: Hiring and Firing: How to Get Good Employees and Keep Them

 Provide a sense of place and belonging. Be sure that the new hire’s
office or workstation is ready to move into right away. Stock it with a full
complement of office essentials (paper clips, pens, pencils, paper, stapler,
and so on), and make sure that the phone and computer are properly
hooked up and immediately available.
 Introduce your new employee to the team. Take the time to introduce
your new hire to his or her coworkers. You can escort the person around
your offices to meet people on an informal basis, or you can schedule an
informal get-together early in the day or over lunch so that your work
unit or department can get to know the new employee.
 Take care of only the essentials on the first day. Don’t drown your new
employee in forms and paperwork. Although new-hire paperwork is a
necessary evil, you can avoid it on the first day. Give the new employee
a week to complete the forms and turn them in.
 Make the first day a fun day. Above all, make sure that your new
employee’s first day is a fun day — one that starts off on the right foot
with your organization. You have plenty of time down the road for the
job to get serious, so you don’t need to rush it now.
You only have one chance to make a first impression. Take the time to ensure
that the first impression of your organization is that you truly care about the
new hire’s well-being. And don’t let that impression end after the first day of
work; renew it every day with all your employees through your own thoughts
and actions.
Disciplining (and Perhaps Terminating)
Deserving Employees
At times, no matter what you do to try to work with an employee or to 
help him or her achieve an acceptable standard, an employee may fall short 
of your expectations. You may need to discipline him, and if the discipline
doesn’t work, you may be left with no choice but to remove the employee
from his or her job. Firing an employee certainly is the toughest job by far for
any manager or supervisor. The pain of terminating an employee is felt by not
only the employee, but also by the entire organization — especially his or her
coworkers and the employee’s supervisor or manager.
In the sections that follow, we take a close look at how to properly discipline
and terminate employees when the need arises.
142
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

The first resort: Discipline
The term discipline applies to a wide range of actions meant to provide 
feedback to employees about deficiencies in their conduct or performance.
Employers generally provide disciplinary feedback in the hope that employ-
ees will change their behavior or performance trends so that supervisors or
managers don’t need to take further action. The following sections break
down the disciplinary process in case you need it.
Identifying why you may need to discipline
Why should you discipline employees? Wouldn’t everyone be much happier if
you simply left well enough alone? Not exactly — well enough often isn’t good
enough. If an employee isn’t performing up to the standards you mutually
agreed to, you must take action, not ignore the problem.
Here are two key reasons for disciplining employees:
 Misconduct: Every organization has policies and procedures that employ-
ees are supposed to follow. Breaking certain rules (for example, taking two
reams of paper from the supply cabinet when you’re supposed to take
only one ream at a time) may have only a minor impact on the organiza-
tion. But other infractions — including stealing from coworkers, lying to
the boss, and making fraudulent travel expense claims — are quite serious
and require serious discipline.
 Performance: Every employee is expected to achieve a certain level 
of performance — whether it’s producing 50 widgets an hour, selling
$50,000 worth of products a month, or answering the telephone before
the third ring 90 percent of the time. These may be the minimum levels
of performance; falling below these minimum standards repeatedly or
for a prolonged period of time usually triggers the disciplinary process.
Progressing through the different stages of discipline
When an employee’s behavior or performance requires discipline, reviewing
the discipline process is important to ensure that the employee understands
the importance of making a change. As a supervisor or manager, you generally
have some discretion as to which level of discipline to apply, and you may or
may not use each one of the levels.
You need to keep in mind, however, that the level of discipline should be
appropriate for the level of employee transgression, and that the discipline
chosen should be consistently applied to all employees in similar situations.
143
Chapter 8: Hiring and Firing: How to Get Good Employees and Keep Them

The most commonly accepted discipline in use today is called progressive 
discipline. With this method, the feedback becomes progressively more serious
for repeated or major performance lapses or cases of misconduct. The follow-
ing represent a common model of progressive discipline. Discipline generally
starts at the least-severe consequence and works up to the most severe —
depending on how the employee responds or on the severity of the original
offense. Fraud, for example, is grounds for immediate termination; you don’t
have to go through all the other steps for such a serious offense. Here are the
steps, from least to most serious:
 Verbal counseling: This is informal, verbal feedback given by an
employee’s immediate supervisor for very minor transgressions or first
offenses. In many cases, this is the only discipline an employee needs to
get back on track.
 Verbal warning: A verbal warning is a bit more serious than verbal
counseling. An employee’s immediate supervisor gives a verbal warning
for more serious transgressions or when an employee ignores his or her
verbal counseling. In a verbal warning, you explicitly state that you’re
giving the employee a verbal warning. You also let the employee know
that repeated transgressions will result in a written warning or a higher
level of discipline.
 Written warning: This form of discipline is much more serious than
verbal counseling or warnings. The written warning — created and deliv-
ered by the employee’s immediate supervisor — generally becomes a part
of the employee’s personnel file and may be a factor in future promotional
opportunities or job references.
 Reprimand: A reprimand is similar to a written warning, but it serves as a
final notice for the employee to correct his or her performance or behav-
ior immediately. A manager one level or more above the employee’s 
immediate supervisor usually delivers the reprimand.
 Suspension: Suspension puts an employee on mandatory leave without
pay for a period depending on the seriousness of the transgression. The
purpose of a suspension is to give the employee time away from the com-
pany to think about the problems that led to this disciplinary outcome.
The time also gives the employee a chance to consider ways to correct his
or her behavior or performance shortcomings.
 Demotion: Demoting an employee may be appropriate if doing so will
make him or her better able to meet performance goals at a lower level of
expectation. Demotions aren’t appropriate in cases of serious misconduct.
 Termination: When employees are guilty of extremely serious or repeated
transgressions or when they don’t correct their repeated performance
shortfalls after some or all the preceding steps, termination is called for.
The following section goes into detail on this topic.
144
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

When disciplining employees — especially as the discipline escalates beyond
verbal counseling or warning — be sure to notify your supervisor and the
human resources department about the problem and the actions you’re taking
to solve it. These people not only want and need to know what’s going on, but
also can offer you their support and assistance during the process. To protect
your company against a lawsuit, they also consult with the company’s attor-
neys who will make sure that you proceed in the appropriate manner (see the
final section of this chapter for more on the legal issues of hiring and firing).
The last resort: Termination
Termination should always be the last resort in an organization. Terminate 
an employee only after the employee has been given ample opportunity to
improve his or her performance or behavior — and has failed to do so — or
when a transgression is so serious that it merits immediate dismissal. Here
are some examples of transgressions that merit immediate dismissal:
 Using or selling illegal drugs at work
 Stealing from coworkers or from the organization
 Fraud
 Violating confidentiality agreements
 Gross insubordination
 Extreme violation of safety rules
 Misrepresentation on employment application
Before you ever get to the point of termination, do whatever you can to help
the employee get back on track and become a productive member of your
team. In some cases, discipline will be all the wake-up call that the employee
needs. In other cases, you may have to transfer the employee to another job
or to another department. In fact, you should always explore the possibility
of a transfer if the employee shows the potential to become a productive
member of the organization.
But if the situation eventually warrants a termination, the following sections
will take you through the process.
Taking steps before you terminate
Firing an employee is bound to unleash all kinds of hurt and resentment and
can even land you in court. For these reasons, be sure that you follow all the
proper procedures before you terminate an employee. The following list 
presents the criteria you need to satisfy:
145
Chapter 8: Hiring and Firing: How to Get Good Employees and Keep Them

 Documentation: If you’re planning to fire an employee for performance
shortcomings, be sure that you have written proof of those shortcom-
ings and that you have the support of evidence. Documentation can be
anything from a supervisor’s written notes in a daily planner, time cards
showing that an employee is habitually late, or falsified expense reports
or other documents.
When you make the decision as to what kind of documentation will be
most appropriate for a particular situation, first ask yourself this question:
Would the documentation convince a court jury that terminating your
employee was justified?
 Fair warning: Fair play says that employees with performance problems
should be given fair warning of the consequences of continued problems.
If you plan to terminate an employee for performance shortcomings, be
sure that you give him or her fair warning. However, serious misconduct
can be grounds for immediate dismissal and doesn’t necessarily require
advance warning.
 Response time: If an employee’s job is in jeopardy if improvement isn’t
soon forthcoming, you must give the employee sufficient time to improve.
You can reasonably expect an employee’s performance to improve after 
a couple weeks to a month.
 Reasonableness: The ultimate punishment of termination should be 
reasonable and appropriate for the offense that led up to it. Firing an
employee for being five minutes late to work once isn’t reasonable. Firing
an employee for consistently being two hours late for several weeks —
with no change in behavior after repeated oral and written warnings — 
is reasonable.
 Avenues for appeal: Your firm should offer employees the ability to
appeal termination to higher management. You never know when a lower-
level manager or supervisor may have acted rashly or outside the bounds
of your company’s termination policy. A review by higher management
will help protect good employees from being unjustly terminated.
Terminating an employee
After you’ve gone through all the criteria and have determined that you’ve
complied, the time has come to terminate your employee. Letting an employee
go is one of the most unpleasant aspects of being an employer. Regardless, 
terminating employees is a key duty that you can do well or not so well.
Here’s a five-step guide that will help you through this process; by following
these steps, you can minimize the pain to the employee and the pain to
coworkers and the organization as a whole:
1. Meet with the employee in a private location.
Find a private office away from other employees to conduct the termina-
tion meeting. Most HR professionals now believe that you should termi-
nate employees late in the day (to spare them the embarrassment of
146
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

clearing out their desks in front of their coworkers). Also, try to schedule
the termination early in the week (to allow employees sufficient time to
apply for unemployment and to mount a search for a new job).
Some companies suggest that an HR professional be present when you
terminate the employee. It’s always wise to have a witness, which is part
of documentation (see the previous section).
2. Tell the employee that he or she is being terminated.
Be straightforward and direct. This isn’t the time to beat around the
bush. Let the employee know that the action is final and that there’s no
recourse.
3. Explain exactly why the employee is being terminated.
Give the reasons in concise terms. Avoid going into too much detail or
getting drawn into an argument about the merits of the action.
4. Announce the effective date of the termination and provide details on
the termination process.
Most firings are effective immediately, and, in the majority of cases, this
is the best approach to take. Discuss the pay and benefits the employee
will receive, including severance pay, pending commissions, vacation
pay, and health-care benefits covered by COBRA — the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, which requires an employer
to allow the employee to continue his or her identical group health cov-
erage for a period of 18 months or more at the same price that his or her
coworkers pay for comparable coverage. Also, explain the next step in
the process of obtaining the benefits.
5. If the firing is effective immediately, escort the employee to his or her
office or workstation and then off the premises.
At the end of the termination meeting, walk the employee out and go
through your termination checklist, collecting any keys, passes, and
company property in the employee’s possession. Give the employee any
termination pay and personnel forms resulting from the firing. After the
employee packs up his or her personal possessions, escort the worker
off the premises.
If the firing is to take effect sometime in the future, the employee may
need a day or two to recover from the shock of the situation, so consider
offering this time off during the termination meeting.
Be careful not to say during the termination anything encouraging such
as “We’ll give you a recommendation” or “It was a pleasure having you
here.” The employee could use such statements against you if he or she
takes you to court.
As you can see, you need to plan for a termination so that you have the neces-
sary forms and materials — including a termination checklist — ready for the
final meeting.
147
Chapter 8: Hiring and Firing: How to Get Good Employees and Keep Them

I Fought the Law (and the Law Won)
If you discover one thing from running a business — often from the school 
of hard knocks — it will be that federal, state, and local governments have
enacted many laws to protect employees from abuse by their employers.
Whether it’s a minimum-wage law, a law prohibiting discrimination, or any
number of others, a law or regulation exists for just about every occasion.
Be sure that you’re intimately familiar with the key employment laws that will
affect the way you run your business. If you run afoul of these laws and you
get sued by an employee or by the government, you can literally be put out of
business. And although you may depend on your human resources manager
or administrator to be an expert on labor laws, every manager should have a
working understanding of the laws, as well. Check out the Department of
Labor Web site (www.dol.gov) and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) Web site (www.eeoc.gov) to research many of these
employment laws or to find links to places that have them readily available
for you to browse at your leisure.
With apologies to readers who live outside the United States (you’ll just have
to stand back and marvel at the wonders of the American legal system), here’s
a list of 11 American laws (all enacted by the federal government) that you
need to be very familiar with. Most have been amended one or more times
since they were first enacted:
 Age Discrimination in Employment Act: Prohibits all employers with 20
or more employees from discriminating against employees aged 40 or
older. Also eliminates company policies that mandate retirement at age 70
(with the exception of certain executives who may be required to retire at
age 65).
 Americans with Disabilities Act: Requires employers with 15 or more
employees to make reasonable accommodations for applicants and
employees with disabilities.
 Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA): Requires
employers to meet minimum standards for most voluntarily established
pension and health plans in private industries. Companies must also
follow rules on the federal income tax effects of transactions associated
with employee benefit plans.
 Equal Pay Act: Requires employers with two or more employees and
that produce goods for interstate commerce to pay men and women
equally for the same job. In other words, you must offer “equal pay for
equal work.”
 Fair Labor Standards Act: Requires all employers that sell their prod-
ucts across state lines to pay legislated minimum wages and overtime,
among other salary-related standards.
148
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

 Family and Medical Leave Act: Requires employers with 15 or more
employees to grant a qualified employee unpaid leave for serious illness,
birth, adoption, or a variety of health-related issues that the employee or
his or her immediate family members may experience. In other words,
employers must keep the employee’s job open until he or she returns.
 Immigration Reform and Control Act: Requires all employers to deter-
mine whether their employees are legally able to work in the United
States.
 Older Workers Benefit Protection Act: Prohibits employers with 20 or
more employees from discriminating against employees aged 40 or older
with regard to early retirement and other benefit plans.
 Pregnancy Discrimination Act: Requires employers with 15 or more
employees to class pregnancy as a medical condition. This ensures that
pregnant employees receive the same benefits and medical leave as
employees who aren’t pregnant.
 Rehabilitation Act: Prohibits employers holding federal government
contracts and subcontracts totaling more than $2,500 in value from dis-
criminating against handicapped people. If an employer holds federal
government contracts and subcontracts worth more than $50,000, it 
has to develop and implement a written affirmative action program for
handicapped people.
 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act: Prohibits employers with 15 or more
employees from discriminating against employees on the basis of race,
gender, color, religion, or national origin.
This list is by no means a complete and in-depth guide to employment law.
It’s simply meant to give you an idea of what you’re dealing with. For much
more detail on these laws and on employment law in general, please seek
competent legal counsel. (In other words, get a good lawyer!)

Building Teams That Really Work
In This Chapter
 Building and growing a team
 Giving employees a sense of control
 Establishing and tracking goals
 Improving your business meetings
T
eams have taken the world of business by storm, and for good reason —
they really work! No one person can be an expert at everything or be
expected to get everything done in an organization. Teams combine the talents
of employees with a variety of skills and experience to find and implement
solutions that would be impossible for one person alone to do. In other words,
team members leverage their talents to create an outcome much greater than
the sum of the team’s parts.
Teamwork can make a tremendous difference in the way employees work
together — a difference that can positively affect the quality of products,
services, and customer satisfaction. When employees work with rather than
against one another, the result is a much more effective and efficient
organization — one with quicker decision making, less wasted time, and a
reduction in expenses.
In this chapter, we take a close look at the many different kinds of teams and
how companies use teams to improve products and services — which will
surely make customers happy. You also find out about empowering your
employees — a very important part of successful team processes — and
about how to set and monitor goals. Finally, we explore business meetings,
and you discover how to make them better.

152
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 
The Construction and Evolution
of the Team
Although there will always be a place for individual effort and personal initia-
tive on the job, teamwork is the lever for growth and effectiveness in most
businesses today. An employee who practices teamwork skills will be a more
valuable asset to her organization — and to customers and coworkers.
To create the best products and services, you need to have the best employ-
ees available to produce them. And the best way to have the most-qualified
employees on staff is to recruit and hire them to begin with. Don’t settle for
hiring average employees in the hopes that you can develop them into excep-
tional employees. Instead, take the time to hire the best employees you can
from the very start. To find out how to do just that, head to Chapter 8. This
section runs down the different forms teams can take and how teams can
develop over time.
Eyeing the different kinds of teams
Would it surprise you if we told you that many kinds of teams are at work in
many kinds of organizations today? Although a company’s managers often
assemble formal teams of employees to tackle specific issues, informal teams
of employees form and disband all the time, of their own accord. The following
sections discuss the most common types of teams that form in a business.
Formal teams
Formal teams are teams organized by managers — or sometimes by self-man-
aging groups of employees — to accomplish specific tasks. They generally
are the most visible teams within an organization, and they are often
launched with great fanfare and pomp. Formal teams hold great promise in
getting useful things done for an organization, but they do their best work
with a minimum amount of interference by management.
The three kinds of formal teams include
 Command teams: Teams comprised of a manager or supervisor and all
his or her employees. Sales teams, management teams, and executive
teams are examples of command teams.
 Committees: Teams of employees pulled together to solve an ongoing or
long-term organizational problem, or to achieve a specific organizational
goal. Committees can exist for years, with membership changing as
employees come and go. Safety committees, employee-morale commit-
tees, and investment committees are examples of committees.

 Task forces: Teams of employees pulled together to quickly solve organi-
zational problems or to respond to specific business opportunities. Task
forces usually have very specific goals and strict deadlines.
IBM’s Hispanic Executive Task Force, for example, is focused on tapping
into the $653-billion Hispanic business market. Within this market, two
million businesses have grown at three times the U.S. average. Task
force members are working with the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce,
other selected organizations, and Latino business partners to increase
IBM’s marketing to the increasingly populous Hispanic demographic.
Informal teams
Informal teams are the most common teams in business. By nature, they
aren’t sanctioned by an organization’s management, but they can hold a
power that far exceeds their apparent authority.
Although informal teams aren’t, by definition, a part of a company’s formal
structure, they’re important parts of the organization nonetheless. In fact,
they’re often an organization’s backbone, its continuity, and its long-term
memory — factors that contribute to their power. Successful managers know
the importance of informal teams in swaying employee opinion, and they’re
mindful of their power when making decisions that affect the organization.
Managers can’t run an organization by themselves — they have to win the
hearts and minds of the people they lead to get things done. This means
securing the cooperation of informal employee teams.
Specifically, informal teams have a couple of important benefits:
 Informal teams provide employees with channels of communication out-
side of the organization’s sanctioned, formal channels.
 Informal teams allow employees to let off steam about issues of concern
with others in their peer groups.
Examples of informal teams include the groups of employees who sit at the
same table together during lunch; the lunch shifts of fast-food workers who
are pulled together by the common bond of working in a particularly hectic
environment day after day; the accounting clerks who chat with each other
as they rubber-stamp invoices to be paid; and so on.
Self-managing teams
Perhaps the most revolutionary of teams are self-managing teams, which are
teams of workers who have replaced traditional managers in many organiza-
tions. Self-managing teams are, as the title suggests, teams of workers who are
granted the authority to manage themselves. Instead of a supervisor or man-
ager calling the shots, a self-managing team decides what needs to be done
and then figures out the best way to do it.
153
Chapter 9: One for All and All for One: Building Teams That Really Work

In most organizations, self-managing teams are an everyday occurrence.
Managers enable them because their companies can no longer afford to have
managers make all the decisions. For an organization to be competitive in
today’s fast and furious global marketplace, the responsibility and authority
for decision making has to be pushed as far down into the organization as
possible, where it’s closest to the customers and their needs.
Self-managing teams can be formed to take on most any business task or to
consider any issue and either make recommendations or institute solutions
themselves. To work properly, self-managing teams have to truly be free of
the interference of supervisors and/or managers. Although supervisors and
managers can set overall goals for teams, self-managing teams should be
granted the authority to make decisions that will determine how they’ll
achieve these goals.
Successful self-managing teams display several characteristics:
 They make the most of their own decisions — especially the most
important ones.
 They select their own leaders.
 They add and remove members of the teams.
 They often create their own goals and schedules.
 They create and execute their own training programs.
 They get rewarded as a team.
Any organization — from small two- or three-person operations to the largest
Fortune 500 multinationals — can employ self-managing teams. It isn’t the
kind of organization or its size that matters; it’s the willingness of managers
to give up some of their decision-making authority to workers. The workers
also must accept the responsibilities that go along with authority.
Do self-managing teams work? The evidence seems to indicate that they do.
Here are some self-managing team success stories from the business world:
 Self-managing teams at the San Diego Zoo successfully design and operate
popular attractions, such as the zoo’s Tiger River exhibit. Employees from
these teams submitted 30 percent fewer workers’ compensation claims
than their coworkers.
 Self-managing teams at the Boeing Company — the Seattle, Washington-
based aircraft manufacturer — designed and built the 777-model passenger
jet — with less than half the problems experienced in any previous jet
program.
 The Star Tribune newspaper in Minneapolis, Minnesota, cut billing mis-
takes in half when it implemented self-managing work teams.

Spanning the stages of team growth
Business teams don’t just happen. As with a primordial organism, the teams
evolve, becoming stronger and more effective over time. If you’ve spent any
amount of time on a team, you’ve probably experienced the different stages
of team growth. In the beginning, team members are tentative, and little real
work gets done. As time passes, however, the team becomes extremely cohe-
sive and productive. At least that’s what this model predicts. The following
sections run down the four stages of team growth. Do you recognize which
stage your team is in?
Stage 1: Forming
During the first stage of team growth, known as forming, team members get to
know one another while cautiously testing the boundaries of the team and its
leadership by interacting and noting reactions — or lack thereof. Participants
generally are energized and excited by the prospect of getting their task
accomplished, but they’re a bit nervous about how the team will go forward.
In this stage, the team actually accomplishes very little.
Stage 2: Storming
The second stage of team growth, storming, is marked by a panic among team
members as they begin to realize the difficulty of the tasks the organization
expects them to accomplish. Participants become impatient about the lack of
progress in the first stage. They react by arguing with one another, question-
ing the team’s leadership, and choosing sides. In this stage, progress toward
accomplishing the team’s goals is minimal. However, team members are
learning more about — and becoming more comfortable with — one another.
Stage 3: Norming
During the third stage of team growth, called norming, team members finally
begin to accept the makeup of the team and follow the team’s ground rules.
Members establish roles and start supporting each other in their efforts. The
fear encountered in the storming stage disappears and is replaced by the
belief that the team will accomplish its goals.
Stage 4: Performing
In the fourth, or performing, stage of team growth, team members feel fully
comfortable in their relationships with one another. They begin to have
insights into the behavior and thought processes of their teammates. Team
members are happy with the team’s progress; they should be making sub-
stantial strides toward goals and working at peak efficiency. The team is truly
performing as a team: Every member supports every other member, and the
team is pulling together to create an entity that can achieve more than any
one person can do alone.

Teaming up at the Mayo Clinic
When Dr. William Mayo and Dr. Charles Mayo
founded the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minnesota, in the early 1900s, they touched off
a revolution that reverberated throughout the
worldwide medical community. The revolution
was all about one thing: teamwork. 
“It (has become) necessary to develop med-
icine as a cooperative science; the clinician,
the specialist, and the laboratory workers
uniting for the good of the patient,” explained
Dr. William Mayo. “Individualism in medicine
can no longer exist.” As Harry Harwick, who
worked alongside the Mayo brothers for 31
years, wrote: “The first and perhaps greatest
lesson I learned from the Mayos was that of
teamwork. For ‘my brother and I’ was no
mere convenient term of reference, but
rather the expression of a basic, indivisible
philosophy of life.”
Here are the five key principles that guide team-
work at the Mayo Clinic:
 No one is big enough to be independent of
others. According to Dr. William Mayo, doc-
tors should freely draw on the expertise of
others — including other doctors, social
workers, and religious advisers — to create
a team that best serves the needs of the
patient.
 Teamwork is part of the culture. At the Mayo
Clinic, teamwork isn’t an option — it’s a way
of life. Teamwork starts at the top, within the
clinic’s management team and governing
boards, and it flows down throughout the
entire structure of the organization, perme-
ating and unifying it.
 Language matters. Doctors at the Mayo
Clinic call one another “consultants.” Why?
Because doctors at the Mayo Clinic are
expected to consult with one another about
patients and cases. Instead of becoming
islands, doctors create networks and teams
for the benefit of clinic patients.
 Money talks. Every doctor at the Mayo Clinic
is on salary. Doctors have no incentives for
ordering expensive tests for patients or for
denying them. The Mayo Clinic is unlike an
HMO (health maintenance organization),
where doctors often complain about being
under pressure to reduce costs, at the risk of
good patient care.
 The customer is part of the team. Patients
at the Mayo Clinic can be as involved in
their diagnoses and treatments as they
want. They’re just as important as the doc-
tors, nurses, and others assigned to their
cases. Imagine what teams would be like in
your organization if your customers could
join and become part of them!
More than 500,000 people are treated at the
Mayo Clinic each year. It encompasses sites in
three states, employing more than 50,000 physi-
cians, scientists, nurses, administrators, and
allied health workers. Through all its growth and
change, the Mayo Clinic remains committed to
its guiding principle, as articulated by Dr.
William Mayo: “The best interest of the patient
is the only interest to be considered.”

Of course, the scenario we paint of these stages is a bit idealized. Not every
team that performs is an effective team, and not every team that’s dysfunc-
tional is broken. Indeed, many dysfunctional teams achieve great things. The
key for a team is to do the best with what it has. Try to keep all members
focused on the task at hand and working toward common goals. Management
(or team leaders) should reward good performance and shine the spotlight on
team members when they earn it.
Empowering Employees
Employee empowerment was the business buzz phrase of the 1990s.
Although everyone was talking about the power of empowerment, few com-
panies actually put their words into action. For those that did, though, the
result was an unleashing of employee energy unmatched in the history of
business. And in the new millennium, empowerment is just as hot a concept.
But empowerment is much more than a management buzzword; in business
today, it’s a concept that will separate the firms that thrive from those that
fail. Empowering employees allows an organization to tap into the almost
boundless energy and talents contained within every employee. The power is
there — don’t let it go to waste!
Exactly how do you empower your employees? Is it good enough to simply
declare your employees “empowered?” No, it’s not. You have to take several
steps to give your employees the authority to make decisions that will have
an impact on their work lives. The following list presents five easy tips for
empowering your employees:
 Clearly define your employees’ responsibilities, and be sure that they
understand them — as well as your expectations of performance.
 Be sure that your employees have the training necessary to successfully
undertake their responsibilities.
 Give your employees the complete authority to successfully undertake
all their responsibilities.
 Treat your employees with respect at all times and trust them implicitly.
 Err on the side of giving your employees too much information rather
than not enough.
Many companies in today’s business environment embrace these actions of
empowerment. The following list presents some examples of empowered
employees in action, illustrating the authority and trust given by 
their companies:
 A janitor in a central distribution center for Domino’s Pizza became a
hero when he fielded an after-hours call from a busy store that had run
out of pepperoni. The empowered employee threw a box of pepperoni in
157
Chapter 9: One for All and All for One: Building Teams That Really Work

the back of a company-owned truck and drove several hundred miles to
make the delivery to a grateful store manager.
 When items are missing price tags at Target retail stores, the cashiers
are empowered to ask customers whether they know the prices. If a
stated price seems reasonable, the clerk can enter it into the register
without first getting management approval.
 At Florida’s Walt Disney World, employees at all levels are given the
authority to replace lost tickets, spilled food, and damaged souvenirs,
regardless of the cause.
Setting Goals and Monitoring Progress
Everyone needs goals in their lives to provide direction. Without goals, you
may not be motivated to do anything in particular with your life — both at
the office and away. With goals, however, you give your life direction and
focus as you strive to achieve milestones. 
But although all employees need goals — and companies need systems to
monitor their progress — setting and monitoring goals is particularly impor-
tant in team situations, where team dynamics can cause loss of focus and
confusion when clear goals are absent. The best business goals direct
employee effort (which includes teams) toward the tasks and behaviors that
are most important to an organization’s long-term success. Goals also should
clearly indicate when an employee has achieved them. In this section, we
consider how you can set effective goals with employees and how you can
monitor employee progress toward achieving those goals.
Setting goals
Establishing goals is a necessary part of doing business. From strategic, to
tactical, to operational measures, goals are central to an organization’s plan-
ning process. Basically, setting goals is the way that work gets done.
There are a number of steps involved in actually setting goals:
1. Imagine the future desired state of your organization and determine
what exactly you want to accomplish.
Do you want better customer service? Development of a new product?
Faster deliveries?
158
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

2. Write a concise, measurable, and achievable statement (your goal)
that can mobilize employees to work toward the desired future.
For example, “Improve customer satisfaction ratings by 20 percent
during the next six months,” or “Develop a new low-voltage memory
chip within one year,” or “Shorten the time it takes to deliver packages
from three days to two days.”
3. If necessary, break the goal into subgoals that can be assigned to the
appropriate people or departments.
Setting goals with your employees doesn’t have to be a complicated process.
In fact, the best goals often are short, concise, and to the point. Employees
are more likely to accomplish goals if they can easily understand them and if
they have no more than two or three goals to work toward at a time. (For an
in-depth look at planning and the role of strategic, tactical, and operational
goals, be sure to check out Chapter 5.)
159
Chapter 9: One for All and All for One: Building Teams That Really Work
Tapping the power of employee involvement
Andy Grove — former chairman of chip maker
Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, California — is
a big believer in the power of employee involve-
ment and initiative. This belief is all a part of his
policy of “organized common sense.” He has
nine tips for encouraging employee involvement
and initiative on the job:
 Motivation comes from within. The most you
can do as a manager is create an environ-
ment in which motivated people can flourish.
 Good coaches take no personal credit for
the success of the team. They’ve played the
game and understand it completely, and are
tough enough to get the very best perfor-
mance that the team can give.
 Think about what you have to do today to
solve — and avoid — tomorrow’s problems.
 Do everything within your power to provide
coworkers with the best possible service.
 Time is your one finite resource. Remember
that when you say yes to one thing, you
have to say no to something else.
 Schedule one hour every day to deal with
inevitable interruptions in a planned, orga-
nized manner.
 Performance reviews are absolutely
necessary.
 To gather information about a corporate
division or department, go on an unan-
nounced visit and observe what’s going on.
 If an employee isn’t doing his or her job,
there are only two possible explanations:
The employee either can’t do it or won’t do
it. To determine which reason is applicable,
apply the following test: If the person’s life
depended on doing the work, could the
employee do it? If the answer is yes, the
problem is motivational. If the answer is no,
the problem is a lack of ability.

Unfortunately, many managers shy away from setting goals with their employees,
because they may consider themselves to be too busy or they may not be
sure how to do it. They do so only when forced to by company planning or
performance-review processes. And when managers set goals by this schedule,
the goals set are often flawed or are dictated to employees without employee
involvement in crafting them.
Monitoring progress toward goals
Setting goals is an important step in the process of getting things done at work,
but it’s only the beginning. To ensure that your organization’s goals are met,
you have to monitor and track specific task performances during the course
of completion. Monitoring and tracking is important because you need to
know if there are problems that are interfering with goal accomplishment. The
sooner you identify such problems, the sooner you can take action — and
avoid major problems down the road. Fortunately, you have several ways to
monitor your progress toward goals; the following sections outline a few of
the most common ways to keep track of employee performance.
Milestones
To monitor progress toward a goal, you can break a project into a series of
individual tasks, the completion of which will comprise the achievement of
the intended project goals. Milestones are scheduled events that indicate
delivery or completion of some part of a task or goal. By breaking down a
project into its individual tasks, you can easily track employee performance
to ensure that the project stays on schedule. Close monitoring of the project
milestones helps prevent any unfortunate surprises along the way.
Here, for example, are sample milestones for the production process of a
company newsletter:
 Interview five employees from several different divisions: February 1.
 Write articles and submit to editor: February 15.
 Type up newsletter and check for typographical errors: March 1.
 Drop newsletter off at printer: March 15.
 Pick up newsletter from printer and distribute to all employees: April 1.
Although employees may be responsible for achieving an organization’s
goals, managers are responsible for monitoring employees’ progress.
Managers typically decide who and how many employees to assign to a task,
balancing quick completion with the need to attend to other company needs.
160
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

Charts and graphs
As your projects become more complex, using a graphical format to chart
milestones can be extremely useful. Charts and graphs make project monitor-
ing much easier than eyeballing pages of text. With just a glance, you can
quickly assess project progress and pick out problem areas that may require
more management attention.
When monitoring project performance, a picture really does tell a thousand
words. A variety of graphing options are available to you and your teams,
including the following:
 Gantt charts: Also known as bar charts, Gantt charts are the most com-
monly used method for monitoring project completion graphically. 
 Flowcharts: Some projects — especially complex ones — require more
than simple Gantt charts to keep track of performance. In these cases,
flowcharts are just what the doctor ordered. By following the longest
path in terms of operations (activities or tasks), you can determine the
critical path of the project, which determines the overall duration of
your project plan. The critical path generally represents the shortest
time in which you can complete a project.
Software
If you manage projects as a key part of your job, be sure to take a look at pro-
ject management software. Several software programs are available that are
devoted to tracking projects; they provide all kinds of tools to those who
need it, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 Project planning and scheduling
 Task assignment
 Graphical reporting
 Task grouping
 Web publication
Indeed, the business world has recently seen a veritable explosion of project
management software solutions — both standalone software programs and
Web-based solutions.
Rather than try to list the most popular or most effective software solutions
available — which are changing all the time — we suggest you do some research
before settling on the best package for your organization’s or team’s needs.
You can start with the Project Management Software Directory (www.
infogoal.com/pmc/pmcswr.htm), which lists all the available software
161
Chapter 9: One for All and All for One: Building Teams That Really Work

according to the kind of project management you want to do. Each package
has its own unique qualities. Pick a package that does all the following:
 Enables you to track multiple projects simultaneously
 Enables you to break projects into tasks and subtasks
 Enables you to create a variety of graphs and charts
 Enables you to view the project from a number of different angles
Conducting Better Business Meetings
Almost every business, whether it has only two employees or more than
200,000, holds meetings as a regular part of getting business done. Although
your employees can communicate with one another in many different ways,
meetings can be incredibly effective — if you conduct them the right way.
Meetings allow not only individual employees to communicate within organi-
zations, but also the teams they work on. Although individual team members
work on their tasks outside of meetings, team meetings give members the
opportunity to come together to determine the team’s goals, its plans for
achieving its goals, who will do what — and when — and so on. In this sec-
tion, we take a close look at what makes meetings tick and give you tips for
conducting better business meetings.
The good (and bad) news about meetings
You’ve probably experienced more than your fair share of both good and bad
business meetings. (We know we have.) What makes some meetings terrific
and others the pits? 
The following list presents the positive side of business meetings:
 Meetings can be empowering. Meetings provide a forum for employees
to have their voices heard — no matter their positions in the hierarchy
or their seniority or experience. Employees in a well-run organization
can even call their own meetings if they like. They don’t need to wait
around for someone else to do it.
 Meetings can be a great way to communicate. When a message needs to
reach a large number of people at once, a meeting is a great way to accom-
plish that task. Have you ever been to a company meeting where the CEO
sketched out his or her vision of the future? Such meetings can be
extremely inspirational and can galvanize an entire group of people to take
162
Part II: Managing a Business in the New World 

action to achieve the vision. Smaller meetings can be just as effective when
you want to solicit employee ideas and focus employee efforts on devel-
oping solutions to problems.
 Meetings can develop work skills and leadership. Becoming full and
active participants in meetings requires employees to develop their work
skills and to become leaders. When they’re assigned tasks in meetings,
complete them, and then report their progress and results in follow-up
meetings, employees learn to work with others on teams and under
deadline stress. Meetings also give employees a chance to present 
their results in front of others, thus boosting their self-confidence.
 Meetings can be morale boosting. Good employees want to know what’s
going on in their organization, and they want to feel like they’re important
parts of the organization’s present and future. Effective managers lay out
their plans for the future in meetings and engage employees in the organi-
zational changes that will be necessary to move from the present to the
future state.
Unfortunately, we also have some bad news to present about many poorly
run meetings. Here’s the negative side of meetings (along with tips to make
meetings better):
 Meetings may not have focus. If you’ve been to a meeting that wan-
dered all over the place — from topic to topic, with little or no focus —
you know exactly what we’re talking about. Meetings without focus
rarely achieve the goals that required the meetings in the first place. The
solution? Keep focused on the topics at hand!
 Companies can have too many meetings. One of the biggest complaints
about meetings is that companies have too many of them. When meet-
ings aren’t working well in an organization, it probably holds too many
of them. The key is to have fewer meetings and to make those meetings
more efficient and more effective. The solution? Fewer (and better)
meetings.
 Attendees may come unprepared. Unprepared attendees are unproduc-
tive attendees. And unproductive attendees do little to help you accom-
plish the goals you’ve set for your organization or team. The solution?
Require employees to come prepared.
 Most meeting time is wasted. Research shows that, on average, 53 per-
cent of all meeting time is wasted. For most organizations, this percent-
age amounts to thousands of hours of wasted time a year. The larger the
organization, the more time it wastes. The solution? Check out the eight
surefire ways to make your meetings better in the next section.
163
Chapter 9: One for All and All for One: Building Teams That Really Work

Eight surefire ways to make 
your meetings better
You can make your team’s meetings better. The power is within you — whether
you’re a meeting leader or a low-level participant. You don’t have to tolerate
meetings that accomplish little or nothing. Here are some surefire ways to
ensure that you’ll hold or participate in better business meetings:
 Be prepared. Meetings are work; so, just as with any other work activity,
the better prepared you are for them, the better the results you can
expect. For example, suppose that the topic is the next fiscal year’s
budget. Before the meeting, dig up your budget for this fiscal year and
become totally familiar with it. Review any budget reports that you may
have received along the way.
 Have an agenda. An agenda — a list of the topics to be covered during
the course of the meeting — can play a critical role in the success of any
meeting. It shows participants where they’re going but leaves it up to
them to figure out how to get there. Be sure to distribute the agenda and
any prework in advance so participants can prepare and you can avoid
wasting time.
 Start and end on time. Sitting through a meeting that goes way beyond
the scheduled ending time would be fine if the participants had nothing
else to do at work. But in these days of faster and more flexible organiza-
tions, everyone always has plenty of work on the to-do list. If you
announce the length of a meeting and then stick to it, fewer participants
will stare at their watches, and more participants will take an active role.
 Have fewer (but better) meetings. Call a meeting only when it’s
absolutely necessary. Before you call a meeting, ask whether you can
achieve your goal in some other way — perhaps through a one-on-one
discussion, a telephone conference call, or a simple exchange of e-mail.
 Include rather than exclude. Meetings are only as good as the ideas the
participants bring forward. Great ideas can come from anyone in an orga-
nization, not just its managers. Roy Disney, former vice chairman of the
Walt Disney Company, tells a great story that illustrates this point perfectly.
Says Disney, “There’s an old story about Walt from the early days when
we were making short subjects — really just a collection of gags. Every
week, Walt had a gag contest, and everybody was free to enter — the
winner got $5, which was a lot of money during the Depression. And 
who kept winning, week after week? The janitor. You see, it’s not about
who’s the boss. It’s about who’s got the best ideas.”

Chapter 9: One for All and All for One: Building Teams That Really Work
Morphing chatter into effective discourse
Holding constructive and effective discussions
is an important part of having successful meet-
ings. And successful meetings are critical to the
smooth functioning of teams within an organi-
zation. In their book, The Team Handbook, Peter
Scholtes and coauthors Brian Joiner and
Barbara Streibel present the following list of tips
for improving discussion skills in your meetings:
 Ask for clarification. If you’re unclear about
the topic being discussed or the logic in
another person’s arguments, ask someone
to define the purpose, focus, or limits of the
discussion. Ask members to repeat ideas in
different ways. Ask for examples, pictures,
diagrams, data, and so on.
 Act as gatekeepers. Encourage equal par-
ticipation 
among 
group 
members.
“Throttle” dominators (ask them to allow
others to participate) and make openings
for less-aggressive members by directly
asking their opinions or making a general
request for input.
 Listen. Actively explore each other’s ideas
instead of debating or defending each idea
that comes up.
 Summarize. Occasionally compile what’s
been said and restate it to the group in
summary form. Follow the summary with a
question to check for agreement.
 Contain digression. Don’t permit overlong
examples or irrelevant discussion.
 Manage time. If portions of the agenda take
longer than expected, remind the team of
your deadlines and time allotments so that
work can be either accelerated or post-
poned, or so you can rebudget time appro-
priately.
 End the discussion. Learn to tell when noth-
ing can be gained from further discussion.
Help the team close a discussion and
decide the issue.
 Test for consensus. Summarize the group’s
position on an issue, state the decision that
you’ve made, and check to see whether the
team agrees with the summary.
 Constantly evaluate the meeting process.
Throughout a meeting, assess the quality of
the discussion. Ask the following: “Are we
getting what we want from this discussion?
If not, what can we do differently in the
remaining time?”
 Maintain the focus. Meetings that get off track and stay off track don’t
achieve their goals. Meeting leaders and participants must actively work
to keep meetings focused on the agenda items. Topics shouldn’t include
the results of the latest football game, who had lunch with whom, or
who’s driving that shiny new Porsche. When you notice the meeting drifting
off track, speak up and push the other attendees to get it back in focus.
 Capture and assign action items. Unless meetings are held purely to
communicate information or for other special purposes, most meetings
result in action items, tasks, or other assignments for participants. Don’t
assume that all participants will take their assignments to heart and
remember all the details. Instead, have someone record every action

item on a sheet of paper (flip charts are great for this, or you can use
regular notebook paper). If some action items haven’t been assigned to
specific individuals for completion, do so before the meeting adjourns.
Immediately after the meeting, summarize the outcome of the meeting, as
well as assignments and timelines, and then e-mail a copy of the summary
to all attendees.
 Get feedback. No meeting is perfect. Be sure to solicit feedback from
meeting attendees on how the meeting went right for them — and on
how it went wrong. Was the meeting too long? Did one person dominate
the discussion? Were attendees unprepared? Were the items on the
agenda unclear? Whatever the problems, you can’t fix them if you don’t
know about them. You can use a simple form to solicit feedback, or you
can speak informally with attendees after the meeting.

f you’ve ever played in or watched a competitive sporting match — foot-
ball, cricket, baseball, tennis, badminton, hockey, rock/paper/scissors —
you know the importance of keeping score. Every competitive game has a
winner and a loser (except in the relatively rare event of a tie score), and the
outcome of many games is determined by the total number of points scored.
An individual or team score instantly tells you two things:
 During the course of competition, you know who is ahead or behind, and
by how much.
 At the end of competition, you know who won and by how much.
Business works in much the same way. However, instead of tracking the
number of points or runs, business tracks money, using accounting practices.
Accounting is simply the science of tracking money in a company. This chap-
ter gives you the lowdown on accounting and explains what you need to
know to determine budgets and keep an eye on your organization’s finances.
Grasping the Basics of Accounting
In business, as in sports, there are winners and losers. Although some busi-
nesses make a lot of money and thrive, others lose tons of money and die. So,
how do you keep track of how your business is doing so you can react and
take appropriate measures? You use an accounting system. An accounting

170
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 
system, in simple terms, tracks how much money comes into a company and
how much goes out (preferably your company has more coming in than going
out!). It has many responsibilities when tracking your money:
 It monitors how much cash you have in your bank account.
 It shows how much money you owe to other companies and individuals
and how much money others owe you.
 It tracks the value of the products you keep on hand to sell to customers.
 It tracks the money that you pay to employees in the form of salary and
benefits.
 It reports the money that’s left over at the end of each month — your
company’s profit. Unfortunately, it sometimes indicates how much
money your business has lost in a particular period of time.
For the most part, winning and losing in the world of business is determined
on the basis of financial measures. The most important financial measures
are sales (revenue) and profit. Sales represent the total amount of money that
flows into a company as a result of selling goods and services. Profit repre-
sents the money that’s left over after a company subtracts its expenses (pay-
roll, benefits, cost of goods sold, rent, telephones, and so on) from its
revenues. However, before we get too far ahead of ourselves, this section dis-
cusses the basics of accounting, including the accounting cycle and the all-
important accounting equation.
A small business may process relatively few transactions a day, making its
accounting system relatively simple. An accounting system for a very large
business — one that does millions of dollars of business a day — is quite
complex. In either case, accounting systems — along with the computers that
run them and the people who run the computers — are always important.
The accounting cycle
The entire accounting process — from beginning to end — is called the
accounting cycle. The accounting cycle has three parts:
 Transaction: A transaction is something your business does that gener-
ates a financial impact, which is then recorded in the accounting system
(a journal). For example, if a member of your sales staff sells a three-year
subscription of your magazine to an anxious customer and the check for
$110 arrives and is deposited into your company’s bank account, that’s a
transaction. Similarly, when your company makes a payment to Joe’s
House of Cheese for supplying food for your company’s annual picnic,
that creates a transaction.

 Journal: As each transaction occurs, it gets posted to a journal. A journal
is nothing more than a general file to temporarily hold transactions until
you can classify them by transaction type.
 Ledger: On a regular basis — daily, weekly, monthly, or other frequency —
you classify transactions in the journal by type and move them into
individual accounts called ledgers. Individual ledgers include such
accounts as payroll, travel, and sales. The collection of all ledgers for a
company is called its general ledger.
After all transactions have been posted to their ledgers, managers have access
to a wide variety of reports that summarize the organization’s transactions
and their effect on the business. We detail these reports, which include the
income statement, balance sheet, and so on, in Chapter 11.
The accounting equation
The accounting equation is the foundation of the science of accounting. A day
without the accounting equation is like a day without sunshine — at least it is
in our Certified Public Accountant’s (CPA’s) office! According to the accounting
equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity
The following sections break down each part of the accounting equation and
how it affects your organization’s finances.
Assets
An asset generally is anything in a business that has some sort of financial
value and can be converted to cash. The products you have stocked in your
warehouse are assets (they’re converted into cash as you sell them) — along
with the cash in your register (which could also be converted into cash if you
sold it on eBay!) and the microwave oven in the employee breakroom.
Assets come in two different flavors; these categories represent how 
quickly assets can be converted into cash:
 Current assets are assets that can be converted into cash within one year.
Think checks that arrived in the mail today, invoices for a month’s worth
of consulting services, or the computers for sale on your showroom floor.
Assets that you can quickly convert into cash also are known as liquid
assets; and the speed by which you can convert assets into cash is called
liquidity.
171
Chapter 10: All You Ever Wanted to Know about Accounting

 Fixed assets are assets that take more than a year to be converted into
cash. Think that custom-built industrial milling machine that only three
companies in the world have any use for, the building that houses your
headquarters, and that finicky, old copier down the hall that may now
make a better boat anchor than reproduction machine.
Here’s a list of the most common kinds of business assets:
 Cash: Cash includes good old-fashioned money and money equivalents
such as checks, money orders, marketable securities, bank deposits,
and, if you live on Pago Pago, coconuts.
 Accounts receivable: Accounts receivable represent the money that
your clients and customers owe you for purchasing your products or
services. When you allow a customer to buy your goods today and pay
later, you’re creating a receivable. If you work strictly on a cash basis
(hot dog stand, ticket scalper, e-commerce site), you don’t have any
receivables, and this item will be zero.
 Inventory: Inventory comprises the finished products that you pur-
chase or manufacture to sell to customers, as well as raw materials,
work in process, and supplies used in operations. If you run a grocery
store, your inventory consists of every item on display for sale in your
store — the carrots, the tubs of margarine, the boxes of donuts, and so
on. (For more on inventory, see the section of the same name later in
this chapter.)
 Prepaid expenses: When you pay for a product or service in advance,
you create an asset known as a prepaid expense. Examples include a
prepaid maintenance contract on a typewriter, an insurance policy with
a one-year term paid in advance, and an agreement for security-alarm
monitoring paid in advance on a quarterly basis.
 Equipment: Equipment is the wide variety of property that your organi-
zation purchases to carry out its operations. Examples include desks,
chairs, computers, electronic testing gear, forklifts, and lie detectors.
 Real estate: Real estate includes assets such as the land, buildings, and
facilities that your company owns, occupies, and utilizes. Some compa-
nies have little or no real estate assets, and others have sizable ones.
For years, Dole owned 98 percent of the 141-square-mile Hawaiian island
of Lanai and used it as a huge pineapple plantation. When the world
pineapple market collapsed a decade or so ago, Dole transferred owner-
ship of the island to Castle & Cooke Properties, Honolulu. Now that’s a
fixed asset!
Liabilities
Liabilities are money owed to others outside your organization. They may
include the money you owe to the company that delivers your office supplies,
the payments you owe on the construction loan that financed your warehouse
expansion, or the mortgage on your corporate headquarters building.
172
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

As with assets, liabilities come in two flavors, each representing the amount
of time it should take to repay the obligations:
 Current liabilities are to be repaid within one year. Think the money for
next week’s employee paychecks, the payment your company owes to your
office-supply business, and payment on a short-term loan from the bank.
 Long-term liabilities are to be repaid in a period longer than one year.
Think the payments on the company delivery van, the mortgage on the
company’s distribution facility, or the money owed to holders of corporate
bonds.
Here’s a list of the most common business liabilities, from both the current
and long-term categories:
 Accounts payable: Accounts payable are the obligations owed to the many
individuals and organizations that have provided goods and services to
your company. Examples include money owed to your computer network
consultant, your local utility company, and an out-of-house advertising
agency that your marketing department uses for ad campaigns.
 Notes payable: Notes payable represent loans made to your company by
individuals or organizations such as banks and savings and loans. The
notes could be anything from an IOU promised to an individual for a small
amount of cash to a multimillion-dollar loan secured from a large bank.
 Accrued expenses: Sometimes a company incurs an expense but has no
immediate plans to reimburse the individual or organization that’s owed
the money. Examples include future wages to be paid to employees,
interest due on loans, and utility bills.
 Bonds payable: When companies issue bonds to raise money to finance
large projects, they incur obligations to pay back the individuals and
organizations that purchase them. (Bonds are described in more detail
in Chapter 13.)
 Mortgages payable: When companies purchase property, they often do
so by taking out mortgages — long-term real estate loans, just like the
one you may have on your home, secured by the property itself.
Mortgages payable represents the mortgages that an organization has
on all its properties.
Owners’ equity
Owners’ equity is the money that remains when you take all your company’s
assets and subtract all your liabilities. Owners’ equity represents the owners’
direct investment in the firm or the owners’ claims on the company’s assets.
Another way of expressing a company’s owners’ equity is its net worth. Net
worth is simply a snapshot of your company’s financial health for a particular
period of time.
173
Chapter 10: All You Ever Wanted to Know about Accounting

Here are the two types of owners’ equity:
 Paid-in capital: The money that people invest in a company. When compa-
nies such as IBM, Ford Motor Company, or PepsiCo offer to sell shares of
stock to investors in a secondary offering (new stock), or when companies
do an initial public offering (go public for the first time), investors provide
paid-in capital to the companies when they pay money to buy the stock.
 Retained earnings: A company’s earnings that are held within the company.
The money gets reinvested, not paid out to shareholders as dividends.
Although owners’ equity generally is a positive number, it can go negative
when a company takes on large amounts of debt — for example, to acquire
another company.
Double-entry bookkeeping
The accounting equation — Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity — is similar
to any other equation: A change to one side of the equation causes a change
in the other. Therefore, every financial transaction you make results in not
one, but two entries to your accounting records — noted as double-entry
bookkeeping. This nifty observation was made many years ago (actually,
more than five centuries ago, in 1494) by Luca Pacioli, an Italian mathemati-
cian and Franciscan monk.
For you trivia buffs, Pacioli’s book containing this and other topics of mathe-
matical interest — Everything about Arithmetic, Geometry, and Proportions —
was one of the first books printed on Gutenberg’s famous printing press.
Unfortunately, much to the disappointment of accounting fans around the
world, it still isn’t a bestseller on Amazon.com.
So, for example, when Susie’s Sushi (best sushi in the tri-state area!) buys a big
yellowfin tuna to slice up for customers, it affects her accounting equation.
For this example, assume that Susie’s Sushi starts with assets (inventory) of
$1,000, liabilities (accounts payable) of $500, and owners’ equity of $500:
Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity
$1,000 = $500 + $500
When Susie purchases that yellowfin tuna from the local fish market for $100,
and the fish market agrees to bill her for it, she acquires an asset (inventory —
literally, raw material). She also takes on a liability of $100 — the money owed
to the fish market (accounts payable). After this transaction, the accounting
equation now looks like this:
Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity
$1,100 = $600 + $500
174
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

As you can see, Susie added $100 of inventory to her assets, but she simultane-
ously added a payable of $100 to her liabilities. The owners’ equity doesn’t
change. As this example shows, every transaction on one side of the accounting
equation results in a transaction on the other side of the accounting equation.
Inventory
Inventory includes the finished products that you purchase or manufacture to
sell to customers, as well as raw materials, work in process, and supplies used
in operations. Although the nature of inventory may seem simple on the surface,
the way your accounting system handles its value is actually quite complex.
You have two major ways of accounting for the value of your inventory:
 FIFO (first in, first out): Under this method of inventory accounting, the
inventory that a company purchases first is the inventory that it sells
first to customers. When prices are rising (and when, exactly, aren’t they
rising?), the FIFO method results in a higher income figure as inventory
is sold off to customers.
 LIFO (last in, first out): Under this method of inventory accounting, the
inventory that a company purchases last is the inventory that it sells
first to customers. When prices are rising, the LIFO method results in a
lower income figure as inventory is sold off to customers.
Okay, that’s all nice and well, but which method should you choose? In the
United States, the Internal Revenue Service and GAAP (Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles) allow for the use of either FIFO or LIFO — it’s com-
pletely up to your organization to decide. However, after you pick a method,
you have to stick with it. Of course, as with anything else in life, each method
has its pluses and minuses.
Business owners who want to show higher earnings to their investors, bankers,
and other sources of financing have a strong incentive to go with FIFO. However,
this higher income comes with a tax burden, which may create a stronger
incentive to go with LIFO. LIFO reports a lower net income but results in a
lower tax burden. The method you choose depends on what you consider more
important: raising investment funds or avoiding taxes. Every company is
different, and the choice depends on your unique circumstances. However, you
should definitely consult an accountant about the best choice for your business!
Depreciation
Just as with people, fixed assets have finite lifetimes. No asset lasts forever
(especially if it has anything to do with technology), and each asset is different.
A computer may have a useful lifetime of only 4 or 5 years, whereas a steel
175
Chapter 10: All You Ever Wanted to Know about Accounting

mill may have a lifetime of 50 or 60 years. As you use assets during the
course of their lifetimes, they gradually wear out or become functionally
obsolete. In the case of the steel mill with a 60-year lifetime, the mill doesn’t
retain 100 percent of its value through year 59 and then suddenly lose all its
value on the first day of its 60th year. Instead, this fixed asset gradually loses
value as it experiences normal wear and tear over a long period of time. In
other words, it depreciates.
Depreciation represents the loss of value of a fixed asset and is a method of
allocating the cost of the asset over its useful lifetime. Depreciation is a non-
cash expense that reduces the value of an asset due to deterioration, obso-
lescence, or age. There are many different accounting methods to calculate
depreciation (methods that aren’t necessarily IRS requirements). The follow-
ing sections take a look at some of the most common traditional methods, as
well as one that is currently required by the IRS.
Straight-line
Straight-line depreciation is the simplest method of depreciating an asset. In
the straight-line method, you divide the cost of the asset by its expected life-
time in years. Table 10-1 shows the straight-line depreciation of a $2,500 com-
puter that has an expected lifetime of five years. In this example, the total
cost of the asset, $2,500, is divided by 5, resulting in an annual depreciation
expense of $500.
Table 10-1
Straight-Line Depreciation

$1,000
3
$500
$1,500
4
$500
$2,000
5
$500
$2,500
As you can see, the amount of the asset depreciated each year is exactly the
same: $500, or 20 percent each year. At the end of the five-year life of the
computer, the asset’s original cost of $2,500 has been fully depreciated.
Nothing could be easier or more straightforward than that!
Double-declining balance
The double-declining balance method of depreciation is what’s known as an
accelerated method of depreciation, because it pushes the majority of the total
depreciation amount into the early years of ownership. You calculate the
176
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

double-declining balance by multiplying the book value of an asset (the origi-
nal cost of the fixed asset, less cumulative depreciation) by double its
straight-line rate. So, if a computer is valued at $2,500 with a straight-line rate
of 20 percent per year, the double-declining balance method allows a depreci-
ation rate of 40 percent per year of the asset’s book value.
Table 10-2 shows the application of the double-declining balance method to a
computer valued at $2,500.

Why would anyone want to accelerate the depreciation of an asset? The main
reason concerns the payment of taxes. Under the straight-line method, all
other things being equal, the tax deduction for the asset will be the same
each year for the duration of the asset’s life. However, by accelerating the
depreciation, you can maximize your tax deduction in the early years of the
asset’s life. This is a good thing.
As Table 10-2 shows, more than 60 percent of the computer’s depreciation
occurs in the first two years of its useful life. In general, it’s best to defer the
payment of taxes as long as possible. Accelerated depreciation enables com-
panies to do just that.
Sum of the years’ digits
The sum of the years’ digits method of depreciation is another way to accelerate
depreciation. For this method, you follow these simple (yeah, right) steps:
1. Determine how many years of life an asset will have.
2. Add the digits together to create the denominator of a fraction, with
the year of depreciation as the numerator, in reverse order (year 1 is
year 5, year 5 is year 1 and so on; lost yet?).
3. Multiply the fraction by the asset’s original cost to determine the
depreciated value.
177
Chapter 10: All You Ever Wanted to Know about Accounting

In the example of a computer with an effective life of five years, first find the
sum of the digits: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. This is your denominator. Table 10-3
shows the rest of the calculation involved to determine depreciation of the
computer during its useful life.
Table 10-3

$2,500

$2,500
As with the double-declining balance method, the sum of the years’ digits
pushes depreciation into the early years of an asset’s life. This maximizes tax
deductions sooner rather than later, resulting in a better financial outcome
for your company. And what’s good for your company is good for you!
Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS)
For IRS purposes, you must use the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System
(MACRS) — an accelerated form of depreciation — to depreciate assets. Under
this system, most business assets will use the GDS (general depreciation
system) as defined in Publication 946 (2006). In simple terms, this means that
you can choose from three depreciation methods with recovery periods defined
by the IRS. The three methods are
 The 200-percent declining balance method during a GDS recovery period
 The 150-percent declining balance method during a GDS recovery period
 The straight-line method during a GDS recovery period
So, for example, say you own computer equipment. The IRS says that you can
depreciate this equipment across five years, using any one of the three methods
in the previous bulleted list.
The IRS warns that you can only depreciate property that you hold for business
purposes and that has a useful life greater than one year. You start depreciating
the asset when you put it into service and stop depreciating it when you’ve
recovered your cost.

Understanding Budgets and Estimates
One of the keys to running a successful business is its owners’ and managers’
ability to predict how the business will perform financially. If you can accu-
rately predict your firm’s performance, you can be certain that you can
deploy resources such as money, people, equipment, manufacturing plants,
and the like appropriately and in the most effective way. A budget is nothing
more than a written estimate of how an organization — or a particular pro-
ject, department, or business unit — will perform financially.
The real value in budgets comes when you compare estimates of expected
performance to actual performance. When the numbers match, you know
that your organization or project is performing just as it should. When the
numbers differ markedly, you know that you need to ask the question,
“Why?” and take a very close look at what’s going on. The process of compar-
ing expected financial results with actual financial results is called variance
analysis (see the section “Keeping Your Eye on the Numbers” later in this
chapter for more discussion).
With the speed of business increasing all the time, why bother doing budgets
at all? Aren’t things changing too fast for budgets to be of any value? In most
cases, the answer is a resounding “No!” Budgets offer the following benefits
to organizations that use them:
 Budgets are milestones on the road to your goals. Every organization
has (or at least should have) goals. Budgets are quick and easy ways to
see whether your organization is on track to meet its financial goals. If,
for example, you’ve already spent half your travel budget but you’re
only one quarter of the way through the year, you know that you poten-
tially have an overspending problem.
 Budgets make decisions easier. When you budget a project, initiative,
or business activity, you’ll quickly have a picture of what it will cost.
Armed with that information, you can decide whether the costs you’ll
incur make good business sense or not. Will you make money or lose
money as a result? How much money? For how long? The answers are
important elements in the decision-making process, and they come from
the budgeting process.
 Budgets can be fast. A budget can be as quick and simple as a few fig-
ures scribbled onto the back of an envelope over lunch. (Ever heard of
doing a “back-of-the-envelope” projection?) A budget also can be a
simple, one-page computer spreadsheet. Not every budget has to weigh
ten pounds and result in mass deforestation. With simple budgets, you
can make changes quickly, in near-real time, and print them out or e-mail
them immediately.
179
Chapter 10: All You Ever Wanted to Know about Accounting

 Budgets can be flexible. Need to hire a few new employees to take care
of an unexpected order? No problem. A budget can accommodate the
change and create an up-to-date picture of how your organization is per-
forming. Or you can simply freeze your budget to see the variance
between what your budget predicted and what really happened.
Regardless of how fast your markets are moving, you can always keep
up, no matter where you are.
 Budgets are fun. Okay, maybe we’re stretching things just a bit here.
But, honestly, creating a budget in which the actual results match your
expectations is a real thrill. The only bigger thrill is when your results
are even better than you expected!
Whereas extensive, long-range (strategic) planning seems increasingly less
valuable to most organizations today, near-term (tactical) planning is becom-
ing incredibly valuable. Budgets are a very necessary part of the tactical
planning process. Now that we’ve sold you on the value of doing budgets
(you are sold, right?), this section looks at some of the most common kinds,
as well as how to create and use a budget.
Perusing different kinds of budgets
When it comes right down to it, you can budget any activity that has a financial
impact on your organization. Want to budget a self-managing work team? No
problem. A research and development project? Piece of cake. The new head-
quarters construction job? All in a day’s work. The following list presents some
of the most common budgets used in business today:
 Cash budget: An estimate of a company’s cash position for a particular
period of time. By using your current cash position as a baseline, you
can estimate all cash inflows (sales) and outflows (expenses) during the
time period you specify — say, a month — to determine a projected
cash position at the end of the period.
 Operating budget: Shows a business’s forecasted revenues along with
forecasted expenses — usually for a period of one year or less. The
operating budget is a top-level budget; the budgets that follow on this
list are line items in the operating budget:
• Labor budget: Takes every person in an organization, department,
or project and multiplies the number of hours they’re expected to
work by their wage rates. The result is the total labor cost to be
expended for a set period of time.
• Sales budget: An estimate of the quantity of goods and services that
you’ll sell during a specific period of time. In the case of products,
you estimate total revenue by multiplying the total number of units
projected to be sold by the price per unit.
180
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

• Production budget: Starts with the sales budget and its estimates
of the total number of units projected to be sold. The production
budget then translates this information into estimates of the cost of
labor, material, and other expenses required to produce the units.
• Expense budget: Every business — from a one-person home business
to a huge multinational corporation — incurs a variety of expenses
during the course of normal operations. You prepare expense budgets
for travel, utilities, office supplies, telephone, and many other
common and not-so-common expenses.
• Capital budget: If you plan to buy fixed assets with long, useful life
spans (many organizations consider this to mean a year or more),
the capital budget is the place to budget for them. Items in your
capital budget may include buildings, production machinery, com-
puters, copiers, furniture, and anything else that will still be in
your office long after you’re gone.
Some type of budget is available to you for almost any occasion. To see what
a real operating budget looks like, check out the sample in the sidebar “A
sample operating budget.”
Creating a budget
What’s the best kind of budget? The one that works! There are many different
types of budgets and three key approaches to developing a budget: bottom
up, top down, and zero based. Each approach has its advantages and disad-
vantages, and each approach can work well — although the pendulum is
clearly swinging in favor of the bottom-up approach:
 Bottom up: In bottom-up budgeting, supervisors and middle managers
prepare the budgets and then forward them up the chain of command
for review and approval. Middle managers have the benefit of a close
working knowledge of the organization and its financial performance. As
a result, bottom-up budgets tend to be more accurate than top-down
budgets. In addition, bottom-up budgets can have a positive impact on
employee morale, because employees assume an active role in providing
financial input to the budgeting process.
 Top down: In this approach, top management prepares the budgets and
imposes them on the lower layers of the organization — generally with-
out any consultation or involvement on the part of those outside of top
management. Top-down budgets clearly express the performance goals
and expectations of top management. These budgets, however, can be
unrealistic, because they don’t incorporate the input of the very people
who will implement them.
181
Chapter 10: All You Ever Wanted to Know about Accounting

 Zero-based budgeting: The process in which each manager prepares
estimates of his or her proposed expenses for a specific period of time,
as though they were being performed for the first time. In other words,
each budgeted activity starts from a budget base of zero. By starting
from scratch at each budget cycle, managers must take a close look at
all their expenses and justify them to top management, thereby (at least
in theory) minimizing waste.

Companies prepare budgets for small operating units or departments. These
budgets roll up into larger budgets — for divisions or groups — which then
combine into an organization’s overall budget. In this way, managers at all
levels can play a role in an organization’s financial health and well-being.
Utilizing budget tricks of the trade
Budgets provide a kind of early warning system that, when compared to
actual results, can inform you when something is going wrong and needs
your immediate attention.
When your expenditures exceed your budget, you can do several things to
get back on track:
 Review your budget. Sometimes, it’s the budget — not the spending —
that’s out of line. Before you do anything else, take a close look at your
budget to make sure that the assumptions on which it’s based are accu-
rate and make sense in your changing market. If your market is growing
quickly, you may need to adjust your estimates.
 Freeze spending. One of the quickest and most effective ways to bring
spending back in line with a budget is to freeze spending. For example,
you can freeze expenses such as pay raises, new staff, and bonuses.
 Postpone new projects. New projects — including new product develop-
ment, acquisition of new facilities, and research and development — can
eat up a lot of money. If spending is over budget, a common solution is to
postpone new projects until you have enough revenue to support them.
Be sure to carefully balance your desire to bring spending back in line
against the need to develop new products and services. If you’re too
zealous in this area, the result can be disastrous for the future growth
and prosperity of your company.
 Ask your employees for help. Here’s an old but very wise saying: None
of us is as smart as all of us. If your expenditures are exceeding your
budget and you can’t sort it out on your own, ask your employees to
suggest ideas for getting back into the black. Chances are, someone in
your organization has some ideas you hadn’t considered, and these
ideas may make the difference between sinking and swimming.
 Lay off employees and close facilities. When you’re trying to cut
expenses, the last resort is to lay off employee and close facilities.
Although these actions will result in an immediate and lasting decrease in
expenses, you’ll also face an immediate and lasting decrease in the talent
available to your organization. In addition, the morale of employees who
survive the budget ax can (and likely will) suffer — at least for a while.

Keeping Your Eye on the Numbers
One of the manager’s classic roles is to control. And one aspect of the control-
ling function of managers is the review and analysis of accounting reports;
managers carry out this function to determine the financial health of the
organization. By regularly reviewing accounting reports and analyzing the
information they present, managers can make better, more informed decisions.
In this section, we look at some ways that managers keep their eyes on the
numbers in an organization.
Accounting provides a kind of scoreboard for an organization. As such, under-
standing how accounting works and how to get the most out of accounting
reports is an important skill for any manager (or aspiring MBA). For a much
more complete discussion on accounting information and reports (about 408
pages worth!), check out Accounting For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by John A.
Tracy (Wiley). You’ll be glad you did.
Variance analysis
A simple way to use a budget to keep your eye on the numbers is through
variance analysis. In simple terms, variance analysis is a comparison of the
financial estimates that you budget for a particular period with your firm’s
actual financial results. The variance is the difference between budget and
actual, which can be a positive or negative number or zero. This method
gives you an immediate picture of financial issues that may require a closer
look on your part.
In the monthly expense report in Table 10-4, look at the variance between the
budget and the actual figures (Note: The parentheses around a number mean
that it’s negative).

In this example, fixed expenses were originally budgeted at $14,563 for the
month. However, when the month ended, the accounting system reflected
actual fixed expenses of $17,753. This resulted in a total variance — or over-
spending — of $3,190.
After you determine that you have a budget variance for the period in ques-
tion, the next step is to decide whether it’s significant and, if so, to figure out
why it occurred. A variance of $3,190, which is 22 percent of the original
budget of $14,563, is definitely significant and warrants a very close look by
the responsible manager.
If you were that manager, what would you identify as the most significant
variance in Table 10-4? A quick look indicates that wages are the main source
of the variance, with spending for the period totaling $2,500 more than the plan.
This may mean that employees are charging excessive overtime, someone got a
raise that you hadn’t anticipated, or any number of other possibilities. As the
manager, it’s your job to determine the reason behind the numbers and then
decide if corrections need to be made.
Audits
The accuracy of accounting records and reports is incredibly important —
especially to two particular groups of people. The people within the organization
rely on accounting information to make informed business decisions, and the
investors and lenders outside the organization rely on accounting information
to make informed decisions on the use of their funds.
185
Chapter 10: All You Ever Wanted to Know about Accounting

For these reasons, organizations conduct regular audits of their accounting
systems to ensure that all results are accurate and that the system treats all
financial information fairly and honestly.
There are two key kinds of audits:
 Internal audits: Conducted by employees of an organization, internal
audits serve as an internal check to ensure the integrity of accounting
information and the reports that are generated from this information. Many
large companies have entire departments devoted to this task and make
audits an annual event. And with the emphasis on financial transparency
resulting from legislation such as Sarbanes-Oxley (described in detail in
the next section), internal auditors are more important than ever before
in public companies.
 External audits: Examination of a company’s accounting system by an
unbiased, outside individual or organization — most often a Certified
Public Accounting (CPA) firm or chartered accountant. External audits
typically are conducted on an annual basis, after the end of a company’s
fiscal year. Companies use these audits to ensure the integrity of the
numbers that go into annual reports and financial statements and to
guard against fraud.
The Lowdown on Sarbanes-Oxley
No matter how honest or how principled the vast majority of businesspeople
may be, a few bad apples are always out to spoil things for the rest. Such was
the case in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when a parade of bad apples such
as Enron, Tyco International, WorldCom, and others became entangled in a
variety of embarrassing corporate and financial scandals. These scandals
undermined the public’s trust in the reliability of public corporation accounting
and financial reporting, and they also devastated many investors. When Enron
collapsed, for instance, $60 billion in market value evaporated into thin air,
and investors were left with worthless stock certificates.
In response to these scandals, Congress passed a new law: the Public
Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002 — more
commonly known as Sarbanes-Oxley, or simply SOX for short. This section
looks a bit closer at the good news and bad news the law brings and what it
may mean to you and your business. (You can also check out Sarbanes-Oxley
For Dummies by Jill Gilbert Welytok, JD, CPA [Wiley].)
186
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

The good news
Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) has indeed succeeded in strengthening corporate
accounting and financial reporting practices. In the wake of the passage of
SOX, confidence in public companies has rebounded, which is a good thing
indeed for businesses — and for the American public as a whole. And
although many executives aren’t too happy about all the extra paperwork
and oversight that SOX requires them to take on, investors are quite pleased
with SOX. There’s now more transparency in corporate financial dealings,
and the risk in their investments is reduced.
When Congress passed SOX and the legislation was signed by President George
W. Bush, the government implemented the following boards or specific
requirements:
 It required companies listed on stock exchanges to have fully indepen-
dent internal audit committees, and external auditors are required to be
truly independent.
 It banned most personal loans to executive officers or directors, closing
loopholes in compensation, stock trading, and blackout rules that were
widely abused at Enron, Tyco, and other corporations.
 It prohibited insider trades by executive officers and directors during
pension fund blackout periods, leveling the field with other employees
who were already prohibited from such trades.
 It required accelerated reporting of insider trading.
 It created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB),
which helps protect the interests of investors and further the public inter-
est in the preparation of informative, fair, and independent audit reports.
 It required public companies to evaluate and disclose information about
the effectiveness of their internal controls as they relate to financial
reporting. Not only that, but it required the company’s independent
auditors to attest to this disclosure.
 It required certification of financial reports by chief executive officers
and chief financial officers.
 It put new protections in place for corporate fraud whistleblowers.
 It increased criminal and civil penalties for violations of securities law.
 It increased jail sentences and fines for corporate executives who
knowingly and willfully misstate financial statements.
187
Chapter 10: All You Ever Wanted to Know about Accounting

The bad news
When Congress drafted SOX, it decided that all public companies — no
matter how large or small — must comply with the law. As it turns out, com-
plying with SOX can be an expensive proposition. One study shows that it
costs large companies around $10 million to make the changes necessary
organization-wide. Although smaller public companies may not have to shell
out that much money, implementing SOX can be quite a burden for small busi-
nesses that don’t have extensive financial resources to draw on (compared to
larger companies).
In addition, some executives have quit their jobs rather than put up with the
tough restrictions that SOX put into place — and face the possible conse-
quences. You probably can’t find a CEO or CFO alive who hasn’t given serious
consideration to the potential ramifications of certifying company financial
reports that may turn out to be incorrect — or, worse, fraudulent. Indeed,
when Jim Clark, co-founder of Web pioneer Netscape Communications, resigned
from his position as chairman of online photo service Shutterfly in early 2007,
he specifically cited the negative impact of SOX as a reason. According to Clark,
SOX has gone too far and is stifling innovation in the United States because
companies are spending money on fulfilling these legislative mandates that
they could be using to create new products and services.
188
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 
What does the future hold for Sarbanes-Oxley?
As of this writing, members of Congress are
rushing to try to relieve businesses — particu-
larly small public companies — of the added
burdens brought about by Sarbanes-Oxley. In
addition to relief, Congress hopes to retain at
least some of the provisions that it hopes will
prevent the next Enron or WorldCom corporate
disaster. So, given its problems, is there a future
for Sarbanes-Oxley?
According to Governance Metrics International
Inc. — a business that rates 4,000 public compa-
nies around the world on more than 400 variables,
from training to directors to financial restate-
ments — companies that behave ethically per-
form better than those that do not. Although the
Standard & Poors 500 showed investment returns
of 11.32 percent, Governance Metrics found that
companies with below-average ethics returned
less — 10.53 percent — and companies with
above-average ethics returned more — 13.46
percent.
Whether or not there’s a future for SOX, you can
clearly see a future for companies that behave
ethically and that are good corporate citizens.
Sure, bad apples will always try to beat the
system, no matter what laws Congress decides
to put into place. But the vast majority of busi-
nesses — and the people who run them — will
continue to behave ethically and with integrity.
And they’ll prosper as a result.

Whether or not you agree with Clark’s assessment, you can’t ignore the fact that
a lot of money is being diverted from productive uses (and from shareholder
returns) to pay for the accounting firms that are helping most large American
corporations comply with SOX. In a Wall Street Journal editorial, Kenneth
Wilcox — president and CEO of SVB Financial Group — cites the example of his
own firm. Not only are audits taking significantly longer to complete, but they’re
also involving more employees in the process, diverting them from their
regular jobs. In 2006, SVB Financial Group paid more than $20 million to Big
Four accounting firms — an average of $17,000 per employee. This represents
an amount five times higher than it paid just three years ago, before the full
impact of SOX was felt.
Negative experiences with money and incorrect information are leading many
businesspeople — and the lobbyists who work for them — to push Congress
for legislative relief. But will this push show results? That remains to be seen.

Oxley?” for more info.)

E
very studious, hard-working business student — and even some of the
slackers — knows that management encompasses four traditional functions:
planning, organizing, leading, and controlling. Each of these management func-
tions has its own unique charm, and each is important in the running of an
organization, but they won’t get equal treatment here. Controlling is the one we
focus on in this chapter — controlling in the form of keeping an eye on financial
transactions and using that information to inform your decision making.
Many experienced businesspeople believe that they can get a fairly accurate,
intuitive sense for the success of their operations, of a project, or of a prod-
uct by simply asking the right people the right questions. Such questions
may take the form of, “So, do you think we’ll get the product out on time?” or
“What do our customers think about the changes we’re making to our ser-
vices?” Although the answers to these questions may provide some impor-
tant insight, they don’t provide all the information necessary to run an
effective organization. Truth be told, focusing on subjective assessments can
be inherently risky, because by nature they overlook important quantitative
metrics that are critical to the understanding of what’s going on in a busi-
ness. You can gain insight into the workings of your business only by closely
reviewing and analyzing hard, objective data. In most organizations, hard,
objective data takes the form of accounting reports and financial statements.
This chapter takes a close look at the most commonly used financial state-
ments to help you understand when and how to use them to better gauge the
progress of a business. (Feel free to also check out Reading Financial Reports
For Dummies, by Lita Epstein, MBA [Wiley], if you want more in-depth info.)

Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 
Reviewing financial statements is a great way to start analyzing a company’s
financial health and its long-term outlook. However, to get the most mileage
out of these reports, you need to undertake a deeper level of analysis. You
must apply financial ratios to the numbers contained in the balance sheet
and income statement and do financial forecasting. We address these topics
and more in Chapter 12.
Financial Statements Are Your Friends
When it comes to assessing the overall financial health of an organization,
businesspeople worldwide use three key financial reports. These reports —
known more precisely as financial statements — are
 The balance sheet
 The income statement
 The statement of cash flows
Managers often receive a variety of financial and project reports tailored to
their exact needs. For instance, a software-engineer manager may receive a
weekly labor report that shows her exactly who worked on the team’s soft-
ware projects, how many hours each employee worked, the cost of those
hours, and a variance above or below budget. An accounts-receivable man-
ager may get an “aging list” of receivables that outlines who owes money to
the company, how much is owed, and for how long. And a production man-
ager may receive regular reports on the cost of returned products customers
didn’t approve of because of quality problems.
Each of these reports offers a unique perspective for looking at a company’s
financial health — and no one financial report can tell you the full story. A
doctor who’s faced with a patient who has an undetermined illness doesn’t
order only a blood test; he also orders a chest X-ray and a complete physical
examination. The doctor doesn’t know which test will reveal the source of
the problem, so she orders several different tests. Likewise, you come to
understand the complete picture of your organization’s status only by review-
ing all the financial statements and sometimes by digging even deeper for
more information. This section (and chapter) helps you get started.
Who reads financial statements?
If you’re a manager or business owner, you’re probably very familiar with the
three major financial statements. A manger or owner’s job description is to
keep close tabs on his organization’s performance and to make changes in
the allocation of company resources to maintain a high level of financial return.

If you’re part of a self-managing work team, or if you work for an open-book
organization — one that shares financial and other performance data with all
employees — you, too, are probably familiar with the financial statements and
the information they provide. If you’re in one of these positions and you aren’t
familiar with financial statements, then read on.
People in the following lines of work also pay close attention to financial
statements:
 Banks need financial statements to make judgments on whether to
extend loans or lines of credit.
 Accountants require financial information to assess the health of an
organization.
 Investors and financial analysts need financial statements to determine
the attractiveness of a particular organization when compared with a
wide range of other investment opportunities.
What do financial statements tell you?
Each different type of financial statement exists for a specific purpose, and it
provides information that other statements don’t. In general, financial state-
ments offer their readers the following important status information:
 Liquidity: The company’s ability to quickly convert assets into cash to
pay expenses such as payroll, vendor invoices, creditors, and so on
 General financial condition: The long-term balance between debt and
equity (the assets left after you deduct liabilities)
 Owners’ equity: The periodic increases and decreases in the company’s
net worth
 Profitability: The ability of the company to earn profits (revenue that
exceeds costs) consistently during an extended period of time
 Performance: The organization’s performance against the financial
plans developed by its management team or employees
As you review financial statements for your organization, keep in mind that
there’s no such thing as a good number or a bad number (unless you made an
entry error). A high profit number may or may not be good news, depending
on the situation. Similarly, a low revenue number may not be bad news, again
depending on the situation. If a particular figure isn’t what you expect it to be
(too high or too low), research why the number is different from what you
expect. In other words, take the time to look beyond the errant number itself
before you suffer a heart attack or fire your sales staff!
193
Chapter 11: Working Your Way through Financial Statements

For example, if profit declined from one period to the next, you may view this
as a bad thing. In fact, your boss may say that it’s a very bad thing! However,
after researching the subject, you may find the decline to be a result of your
CFO’s decision to draw down profits (reduce profits by expenditures elsewhere
in the company) to minimize the impact of income taxes on your company —
definitely a good thing.
Taking a Snapshot: The Balance Sheet
The balance sheet gives you a snapshot of your organization’s financial health
at an exact point in time — not over a period of time. You use this snapshot
to determine the book value of a company’s assets and liabilities (including
equity) at a particular date. The famous tagline on the heading of any good
balance sheet is some form of “As of December 31, 2009, . . .” or “At
December 31, 2009, . . .”. Your company’s financial picture could be vastly dif-
ferent on January 1, 2010 (after your CFO electronically transfers $15 million
out of the company’s cash account and into his numbered Swiss bank
account before flying out of the country to start his early retirement!).
Before we move forward, we have a question for you: Do you know what the
accounting equation is? If not, check out Chapter 10. For those of you who
don’t feel like turning the page right now, here’s the accounting equation
without any context:
Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity
The accounting equation is the basis for creating the balance sheet (see
Figure 11-1 for an illustration):
 Assets include cash and things that you can convert to cash.
 Liabilities are obligations — debt, loans, mortgages, and the like —
owed to other organizations or people.
 Owners’ equity is the net worth of your company after you subtract all
liabilities from the organization’s assets.
In the balance sheet, assets are listed in order from the most liquid (readily
convertible to cash) to the least liquid. Liabilities and owners’ equity are listed
in the order in which your company plans to pay them. Note: You can convert
current assets to cash within a year; current liabilities are scheduled to be
paid within a year.
194
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

As you can see in Figure 11-1, the value of Acme Dog Food’s assets is balanced
by its liabilities and owners’ equity. The balance sheet demonstrates the fact
that a company’s liabilities and owners’ equity pay for its assets. Conversely,
the company uses its assets to generate cash to pay off its liabilities. Any
excess cash (gains) is added to owners’ equity.
By reviewing changes in your balance sheets over time, managers, bankers,
investors, and so on can pick up on trends that may affect the long-term viability
of the firm and that may positively or negatively impact the value of its stock. In
Chapter 12, you find out how to use financial ratios and forecasting tools to make
sense of the numbers in the balance sheet and spot changes and trends.

Making Money: The Income Statement
Why does a business exist? To leave a lasting legacy in the world? Maybe in
some cases. To employ thousands of people and pull a city or region out of
an economic slump that threatens the fabric of the community? That’s hap-
pened on more than one occasion. To save the world? Perhaps. The number
one reason that businesses exist is to make money — to make a profit for
their owners. Because making money is such an incredibly important part of
the day-to-day focus of a business, companies need a quick and easily under-
stood way to figure out how much money they’re making. Such a tool exists:
the income statement.
An income statement (see Figure 11-2 for an illustration) — also known as a
profit and loss statement, a P&L, a report of earnings, or a statement of income
and losses — gives its readers three key pieces of information:
 The business’s sales volume during the period of the report
 The business’s expenses during the period of the report
 The difference between the business’s sales and its expenses (its profit
or loss) during the period of the report
The income statement in Figure 11-2 indicates that Acme Dog Food had
$49,000 in net sales revenue and a cost of goods sold of $10,000, leaving a
gross profit of $39,000. However, the gross profit saw further reduction from
the expenses of selling products, running the company (advertising, printing,
rent, salaries, bonuses, and so forth), and income taxes. The result was a net
income of $9,000. Divided by 250,000 shares of stock in the hands of investors
and the company, the $9,000 works out to an earnings per share of $0.036. At
about 18 percent of net sales revenues, a net income of $9,000 is a very good
result indeed.

Chapter 11: Working Your Way through Financial Statements
Pat Boyce on the value of financial statements
Pat Boyce — former president and COO of
Horizons Technology, Inc., of San Diego,
California, and vice president and corporate con-
troller for SAIC, Inc., of La Jolla, California — is
an independent consultant who specializes in
setting up financial and accounting systems for
technology start-ups. In his many years of finan-
cial experience, Boyce has seen just about
everything — and maybe even a little bit more.
We asked him for his perspective on the impor-
tance of financial statements:
The Complete MBA For Dummies: Of the three
key financial statements, which do you consider
to be the most valuable for a business, and
why?
Pat Boyce: That definitely depends on the state
of affairs of the business, and the type of a busi-
ness that it is. For example, in a small start-up
company, the only one that matters is the cash-
flow statement. Assuming that you’ve got lim-
ited resources, managing your cash flow is your
top priority.
(continued)

198
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 
Complete MBA: Why is that?
Boyce: If you don’t have enough cash or
resources to afford to meet your payroll and
other liabilities, then you’ve got a big problem.
Complete MBA: How often should a company
run a cash-flow report?
Boyce: First, there’s a difference between a
cash-flow report that you might see as a finan-
cial statement and a cash-flow report that you
use to operate a business. The internal, operat-
ing cash-flow report is done differently than the
one that is seen by the public. Most companies
that I know do operating cash-flow reports on a
very frequent basis. Certainly, they try to do it at
least once a week, and it’s not uncommon for
businesses to run a daily cash-flow report. The
cash-flow report that goes with your financial
statements is different, however, and it is
defined by what your CPA and the accounting
standards require. If you look at the classic one
used as a financial statement, first of all, you
can only do that on an irregular basis, and
second, it doesn’t really lend itself to decision
making. It’s more analytic. It doesn’t help you on
a day-to-day basis.
Complete MBA: Does keeping close tabs on
cash flow become less important as you grow
out of the start-up phase?
Boyce: Definitely, assuming you’ve got your
financing positions well established. You’ve still
got to keep an eye on your cash flow, but you
can delegate the task to your accounting people
with some general ground rules as to where it
should be. As long as your cash flow stays
within these ground rules, then it doesn’t get
management attention. Once you’ve generated
some working capital that you can rely on, the
sense of urgency on a day-to-day basis drops. It
doesn’t mean the urgency goes away; your
cash flow just doesn’t require the same level of
attention.
Complete MBA: How about the balance sheet?
What’s the point?
Boyce: The relevance of the balance sheet
varies dramatically from business to business.
Say that at one extreme, you’ve got a consult-
ing business, and at the other extreme, you’ve
got a bank or other financial institution. In the
case of the consulting business, the balance
sheet is important in the sense of managing cer-
tain assets like accounts receivable or pay-
ments to vendors, or whatever, and seeing that
your overall financial position is acceptable in a
broad sense. When it comes to the financial
institution, the balance sheet really represents
the working assets and liabilities of your busi-
ness — which generates your income — so its
purposes are much broader.
Complete MBA: When you look at a balance
sheet, what makes you feel good?
Boyce: Balance sheets are impacted very much
by the type of business and the industry that
they’re in. Using our example of a consulting
business and a bank, their balance sheets
would never look at all alike, either in the
description or in the relative magnitudes of
types of assets and liabilities. If you look at a
balance sheet in the context of an industry, and
you know what that balance sheet should look
like in that industry, then you can make a judg-
ment about it. If you don’t know that, then it’s
pretty hard to judge whether an individual bal-
ance sheet is really good or really bad. If you tie
the income statement together with the balance
sheet, you can start doing more classic finan-
cial analysis than you would get in a textbook
about how that business operates. But you still
want to have that reference point back to the
ndustry. The other reference point would be to
the point in time. Just a snapshot of a balance
sheet at any point in time isn’t nearly as valuable
as a comparison over time. Ideally, to make a
judgment, you’ll want to look at a comparison of
that balance sheet over time and be able to
compare it to the industry.

Complete MBA:
How about the income
statement?
Boyce: It’s the one that everyone relies on the
most, and the techniques for presenting the
income statement are continually being refined
by accountants. It’s a test to give you the real
economic earnings of the company during the
period of time portrayed in the statement.
Depending on the business, some of the things
that affect the income and expenses may be so
theoretically obtuse that the average person
may not understand them.
Complete MBA: What’s the use of an income
statement for a working manager or employee?
Boyce: Ideally, what you do is break the com-
pany’s published income statement down into
pieces that are your internal responsibility
accounting reporting system. Then you take
each aspect of your income statement — and for
that matter, some or all of your balance sheet —
and assign it to responsible parties on the basis
of the areas that they can control. The things that
they can’t control themselves by their actions as
a manager are best left to someone who can
control them. Eventually, there will be a few
items that are not subject to control — for exam-
ple, depreciation expense based on prior acqui-
sition of capital equipment — and that don’t
make sense to be assigned to someone to con-
trol. Then each responsible person has his or her
own mini-income statement to manage.
Complete MBA: Why is it more valuable to look
at a comparison over time versus just a snap-
shot?
Boyce: If you’re really trying to assess what’s
going on within the company, looking at what’s
changing will give you a feeling about where the
company has been going over that past period
of time, which can give you an indication of
where the company will go in the future.
Complete MBA: Is there a general rule for how
many periods you need to see to get a fairly
accurate trend?
Boyce: The theoretical answer that a professor
might give you is that you would want to see it
for two or three business periods, depending on
whether the business has a seasonality. Just as
with any mathematical analysis, if you can get
two points, you can draw a line, but if you can
get three points, you can start getting some
information about trends. So, typically, you
would like to see three periods. For example, if
you took software developer Intuit’s financial
statement, it has a very, very seasonal business
because of the sales of its Quicken tax return
software in the early part of the year. Then rev-
enues drop off substantially, changing the bal-
ance sheet dramatically. To really get a good
sense of Intuit’s business, you would have to
look at it at the same point in time for three
years. Other companies may not have much
seasonality at all, in which case you can go with
shorter periods of time.Followers of open-book
management, on the other hand, believe that all
workers should have access to a company’s
financial statements. They also believe that
employees should receive training in what
these statements mean and in how the work
they do impacts both the company and them as
employees. However, financial statements
aren’t exactly exciting topics for most employ-
ees. So, if you want to use the philosophy of
open-book management, you have to think
carefully about how you develop financial liter-
acy in your company. Here are some pointers to
follow:
 Get the people in your company to speak a
common language. You don’t want to use
the language of accounting (debits and
credits); use the numbers and ratios (see
Chapter 12) that relate directly to the com-
pany. And be sure to train your employees
in how to translate and understand this new
language! For example, many companies
offer their employees classes on how to
read financial statements.

Keeping Your Business Afloat: 
The Cash-Flow Statement
Have you ever heard the phrase, “Cash is king”? No, not queen or prince —
king. For any business, cash truly is what matters. It takes cash to pay
employees, to purchase supplies, to pay bills, and to execute many more
business functions. A cash-flow statement — also known as a statement of cash
flows by some — is a specialized report that tracks the sources of cash in a
company, as well as its inflows (money coming into the business) and out-
flows (money going out of the business). The statement is an extremely valu-
able tool for ensuring that your company has the cash it needs to meet its
obligations when you need it. This can mean the difference between keeping
your business afloat and watching it sink.
200
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 
 Make your employees understand how
their work contributes to the profits of the
business. Making that link gives employees
a vested interest in doing quality work. For
example, you can explain to your electron-
ics assemblers how whenever a product is
returned due to poor quality, company costs
increase, profits decrease, and the amount
of money available to pay bonuses also
decreases.
 Demonstrate what you’re talking about in
terms that can be easily understood. Don’t
assume that employees will understand
terms that you take for granted, such as
profit and loss. Spell them out in terms that
they will understand as clearly as you do.
For example, at one manufacturing com-
pany, the plant supervisor wanted to reduce
the amount of scrap material in its produc-
tion process, but his employees didn’t seem
to understand his goal. He decided to try a
demonstration to get their attention. He
asked them to join him in the break room,
where he had placed an old sofa. Pulling
out a huge chainsaw, he cut off a third of
the sofa. Afterward he said to the shocked
employees, “That’s how much it costs for
the materials that go into our product.” He
then lopped off another third of the couch
and proclaimed, “That part represents
labor.” Finally, he pointed to the remaining
piece of sofa and announced,” That’s how
much money we’re wasting in scrap.” His
demonstration got their attention, and he
had made his point. From then on, employ-
ees in the plant were determined to reduce
scrap — it became their mantra.
The point is if you want to use open-book man-
agement, you need to make financials interest-
ing and relevant to your employees. When
Southwest Airlines introduced its employees to
its financials, it created a colorful, fun-to-read
document that captured the attention of the
company’s employees.
(continued)

The business world features a number of different kinds of cash-flow state-
ments — each one suited to a particular business need. Some work best
strictly inside a business, and some work best outside a business (for
investors, creditors, and other interested parties). Here are a few of the most
common types of cash-flow statements:
 Simple cash-flow statement (or cash budget): Arranges all items into
one or two categories — most often cash inflows and cash outflows.
 Operating cash-flow statement: Limits analysis of cash flows to only
items dealing with the operations of a business — not its financing.
 Financing cash-flow statement: Includes cash raised by issuing new
debt or equity capital, as well as expenses incurred for repaying debt or
paying dividends on stock.
 Statement of cash flows: Often an external statement that depicts the
period-to-period changes in balance sheet items and the actual dollar
amount for the period in question for income statement items. This
statement shows the following categories:
• Operating cash inflows
• Operating cash outflows
• Priority outflows (such as interest expense and current debt
payments)
• Discretionary outflows (such as equipment expense)
• Financial flows (things you borrow or changes in equity)

Chapter 11: Working Your Way through Financial Statements
Going for financial literacy to get better performance
Many years ago, the open-book management
revolution swept through the world of business,
led 
by 
Jack 
Stack 
of 
Springfield
ReManufacturing Corporation in Springfield,
Missouri. (Jack turned his philosophy of busi-
ness into a popular book, The Great Game of
Business [Currency].) His revolution sparked a
brand-new way of doing business in the United
States, and that method has gained a foothold
in many businesses today. Traditionally, the pro-
duction and analysis of financial statements
was a closely held duty of management. Not
only did nonmanagement employees have no
need to see these statements (as far as most
managers were concerned), but it also was
assumed that these employees wouldn’t under-
stand the statements anyway.

Although you can find plenty of different cash-flow statements to meet your
every mood, whatever you do, don’t forget the first and perhaps the most
important rule of cash management: Happiness is a positive cash flow. Having a
positive cash flow — more coming in than going out — means that you’re in a
better position to meet your current and future financial obligations. Figure 11-3
shows an example of a simple cash-flow statement meant for internal use.
The top line of the example indicates the three months of the company’s fourth
quarter: October, November, December. By working down the column for each
month, you can quickly and easily determine the cash flow. For example, in
October, cash in was $5 million, and cash out was $4.5 million, resulting in a net
cash surplus of $500,000. When combined with the last month’s cash surplus
(need) of $0, the cumulative cash flow in October was $500,000. In November,
cash in was $7.5 million, but cash out was $8 million, resulting in a negative cash
flow for the month of ($500,000). Combining November’s negative cash flow of
($500,000) with October’s cumulative cash flow of $500,000 results in a cumula-
tive cash flow of $0 for November.

A
lthough cash takes up only one line on a company’s balance sheet, it plays
an incredibly important role in the day-to-day health of the organization.
Cash pays employee salaries and benefits. It pays vendors for the raw materials,
services, and supplies needed to operate the business and manufacture its
products. Cash keeps the lights on. It pays for the inventory of products that are
stockpiled for customers to buy. Bottom line: Without a constant and reliable
supply of good old-fashioned money, most businesses would go kaput before
too long.
It shouldn’t surprise you to learn, therefore, that managing, planning,
forecasting, and analyzing financial situations is high on the list of priorities
for the people who own, manage, and run organizations. As Harold Geneen,
the famous former chairman of ITT, put it,
“To be good at your business, you have to know the numbers — cold.”
So, what’s involved in managing a company’s finances? We believe that, with
the proper tools, most people can become proficient in managing the finances
of a company, division, or department. And, in this chapter, we provide you
with the tools to do just that. We cover everything from forecasting and bud-
geting to financial ratios and investment analysis tools you need to under-
stand. We also take you through the process of reading an annual report.

Part III: Money: What You Don't Know Will Hurt You 
Manage Your Finances (Before 
They Manage You!)
You have a choice: You can either manage your business and the systems and
processes within it or you can let it manage you. We have many years of
experience in business and have interviewed a variety of people who own
and run businesses. Based on information from those sources, we know that
the best route to success is to be proactive and manage your business
instead of letting it manage you.
Although every business has many systems and processes that can benefit from
proactive management, your company’s financial situation is among the most
important areas to manage. Every business — from the smallest start-up to
the largest Fortune 500 multinational — needs a financial plan. Financial plans
serve as blueprints for the financial needs of your company. As such, they
enable your decision makers to determine when and where funds will be neces-
sary in the organization, and how much to allot. Financial plans also let managers
know whether it’s prudent to promise new projects or ventures or whether it’s
necessary to terminate old, underperforming ones.
The financial planning process has three parts: preparing forecasts, develop-
ing budgets, and establishing financial controls. The following sections take a
closer look at each part.
The old acronym GIGO (garbage in, garbage out) definitely applies when it
comes to making forecasts. Financial forecasts of any sort are only as good as
the data on which they’re based. As the horizon for your forecasts extends
further into the future, their reliability naturally declines, and they become
less dependable. Many companies in fast-moving industries are happy to
forecast a year into the future with any degree of accuracy. Companies in
more stable industries, however, can safely forecast up to five years out.
Preparing accurate forecasts
Have you ever tried to guess what will happen tomorrow — or next week or
next year — in your business? If you can count on one thing in business, it’s
that nothing will stay the same for very long. In business today, change is a
constant.
Therefore, savvy businesspeople try to anticipate, forecast, and predict
change before it occurs. And because financial considerations can mean the
difference between life and death to a company, financial forecasts and pro-
jections are keystones of proactive business management practice.

Ask questions similar to the following if you want to prepare accurate financial
forecasts for your business:
 How many employees will we have on board this year, and will we have
the money to pay them when we need to?
 Will we have sufficient funds to invest in new manufacturing equipment
that will improve the productivity of our workers while increasing
output and lowering rejects?
 How much money will we need to stock up our inventory in time for the
holiday season? Will the money be available when we need it?
 By what amount can we expect revenues and profit to grow (or, heaven
forbid, shrink) over the next year?
 What is the timing of payments from our major customers, and how will
they affect our cash flow?
These questions, and others like them, should constantly be on the minds of
financial managers — chief financial officers (CFOs), controllers, presidents,
vice presidents — and others who are responsible for ensuring that a business
meets all its financial obligations. For this reason, managers conduct regular
financial planning and forecasting sessions.
There are two key kinds of financial forecasts and projections: short-term and
long-term. In addition, many businesses regularly produce cash forecasts to
keep close tabs on the cash going in and out of the company. In the sections
that follow, we cover all three.
Short-term financial forecasts
If a financial forecast is for a period of one year or less, it’s considered a short-
term forecast. Many firms use a variety of short-term financial forecasts and
pro forma (informal) financial statements to manage day-to-day operations.
These types of forecasts and financial statements include
 Cash
 Sales or revenue
 Profit and loss (income statement)
 Balance sheet
 Receivables
Each of these short-term forecasts — and others that an organization may
select — is important to the people in charge of monitoring a company’s
near-term financial position.
205
Chapter 12: Deciphering the Mysteries of Financial Planning and Analysis

Long-term financial forecasts
If you need to plan for a period that extends more than a year into the future,
long-term financial forecasts are just what the doctor ordered. But given how
fast the business environment is changing, why would you want to make
plans for more than a year into the future? Won’t things change at least five
or ten times before then? Of course they will. But part of financial planning is
planning for change.
Done right, long-term plans can provide your business with a definite
competitive advantage. How? By giving your business focus and direction.
Business owners typically have a vision for where they want their companies
to be in, say, ten years; so, it makes sense to think about the financial milestones
you should cross along the way.
In short, long-range plans require long-term financial forecasts to support
them. Although they can never be as accurate as short-term forecasts,
they’re often better than nothing. Just as with short-term financial forecasts,
you can forecast all kinds of financial data well into the future. Here are some
of the most popular kinds of financial data subject to a long-term look:
 Cash
 Sales or revenue
 Profit and loss (income statement)
 Assets, liabilities, and net worth (balance sheet)
Although long-range forecasting can help you support your long-range plans,
the further out you forecast, the more likely your figures will be inaccurate.
That’s why it’s important to base your forecasts on sound numbers and an
understanding of business trends.
Long-term financial forecasts are comprised of much the same information as
short-term forecasts, just with much longer horizons. These longer horizons
require careful attention to long-range trends in markets and technology, and
they assume the possibility of greater swings. Here are some tips for putting
together accurate, long-term financial forecasts:
 Look for long-term trends in revenues and expenses. Are your revenues
and expenses gradually trending up or down over a period of five years
or longer? Chart these trends as graphs and make an educated guess as
to where the trends will lead in the future.
 Determine whether there are any business cycles. A business cycle is a
periodic variation in the economic activity of your business resulting
from such things as consumer demand, which may rise in anticipation of
the holidays and decline immediately thereafter. Many businesses and
206
Part III: Money: What You Don't Know Will Hurt You 

markets go through regular business cycles. By looking at the big picture,
you should be able to pick out the cycles and factor them into your long-
term financial forecasts.
 Figure out what kinds of random events are most likely to disturb the
long-term trends in revenues and expenses. What would happen if
your company bought out a key competitor? How would that affect rev-
enues and expenses? What if a competitor develops a new process that
cuts its costs of production in half? Random events are just that —
random. By nature, they’re hard to predict, but the more you factor
them into your long-term financial forecasts, the more accurate your
forecasts will be.
Cash forecasts
By far the most important forecast for most companies is the cash forecast
(as you can see, this type of forecast shows up in both short- and long-term
predictions). In business, cash makes the world go ’round. Especially for
young start-up companies, cash, or the lack thereof, can mean the difference
between success and failure.
Figure 12-1 is an example of the kind of simplified cash forecast a typical firm
may use on a regular basis. The frequency of reporting depends on the needs of
the business and the importance of keeping close tabs on its cash position. For
some companies, “regular” means daily or weekly. For others, it means monthly,
quarterly, or even longer. The cash forecast in Figure 12-1 is for a business that
provides software engineers directly to a Fortune 500 company at a variety of
locations nationwide. Software engineers are the company’s main product, as
well as its major expense. In this example, the company pays employees weekly
but receives payment from its client only once each month.
As you can see, in each of the first three weeks of the month, the company
incurs a negative cash flow of $20,000, accumulating to $60,000 by the end of
the third week. However, when the client makes a $150,000 payment in week
four, the cash flow goes positive in a big way — to the tune of $70,000. Now,
just imagine what the company’s cash forecast looks like when it adds all 14
of its clients to the mix!
Using similar cash forecasts, companies can determine when they’ll be taking
in more money than they pay out to meet their obligations. They can use this
knowledge to guide many decisions, such as
 When and how much to pay vendors
 What levels of inventory they can comfortably keep in stock
 Timing investments in capital equipment
207
Chapter 12: Deciphering the Mysteries of Financial Planning and Analysis

Developing and executing budgets
The second part of the financial management process is the development and
execution of budgets. Budgets are similar to financial forecasts, but much more
detailed. For example, a sales forecast may simply reflect a total revenue
estimate of $500,000 for the upcoming fiscal quarter; a sales budget for the
same period, on the other hand, is a breakdown of each of the various individual
components of the sales forecast. Take a look at the following table, which
shows an example sales budget for a hypothetical computer components
retailer’s 3rd quarter:

This budget shows how much the company is predicting it will sell of each
product or service during a specific period of time — in this case, a fiscal
quarter. The neat thing about budgets is that they not only provide a detailed
picture of what the future may bring, but also create a baseline against which
you can measure your actual performance. In the preceding budget, the amount
of estimated total sales is $500,000. After the third quarter is over, the company’s
accounting system will provide the actual results — for each line of the sales
budget, as well as an overall total.
By comparing the budgeted totals versus the actual results, you can quickly
grasp exactly where company performance is better or worse than antici-
pated and redirect your resources accordingly. For a much more detailed dis-
cussion on the budgeting process, including all the whys and how-tos you
need, be sure to drop by Chapter 10.
Establishing financial controls
Accounting systems and financial statements and reports are wonderful things,
but they aren’t worth the software they’re built from, nor the paper they’re
printed on, if no one analyzes and interprets them. Numbers by themselves
mean nothing. Numbers with context and justification mean everything.
The whole point of preparing financial forecasts and budgets is to attempt
to predict future performance while creating baselines by which you can
compare actual results. If results you experience are as predicted, terrific —
you’re right on track toward your goals. If the actual results are significantly
less or significantly more than predicted, however, it’s time to look for the
sources of these variances.
209
Chapter 12: Deciphering the Mysteries of Financial Planning and Analysis

Here are some ways that you can analyze your company’s performance
against expectations:
 Variance analysis: By comparing your organization’s actual results
versus its budgeted results (for example, your actual revenues versus
budgeted revenues), you get a quick picture of whether your company is
on or off track and by how much. (We discuss variance analysis in detail
in Chapter 10.)
 Ratio analysis: By comparing certain financial results within your com-
pany’s financial statements (particularly the income statement and balance
sheet), you can determine whether your company is operating within the
normal limits for your industry. For example, dividing your company’s
current assets by its current liabilities results in a ratio (the quick ratio)
that tells you whether your company is solvent and can meet its financial
obligations to your lenders.
 Cost/volume/profit analysis: By determining what products/services
are the most — and the least — profitable for your company, you can
make decisions about where to invest your company’s time and resources.
There are a couple key approaches to cost/volume/profit analysis:
• Break-even analysis: A break-even analysis (BE) allows you to
determine at what sales volume you can earn a profit after paying
all the expenses of producing your product/service. BE is the point
at which the cost of the product/service equals the sales volume.
Everything above that point is gross profit. Using electronic spread-
sheets, you can run all sorts of what-if scenarios with a variety of
different cost and price assumptions.
• Contribution margin analysis: Contribution margin analysis com-
pares the profitability of each of your company’s products or ser-
vices, as well as the product’s/service’s relative contribution to
your company’s bottom line. This analysis quickly points out
underperforming products and services that your company should
either restructure or terminate.
If your company is underperforming, you can redirect resources to boost
performance, or you can change plans to bring your expectations in line with
reality. If your company is overperforming, you can identify the reasons why
and do more of the same. At the same time, you can modify your budgets
upward to accommodate the improved performance.
You can use many tricks of the trade to determine how your business is per-
forming based on all sorts of financial data. In the next section, we explore
some of our personal favorites.
210
Part III: Money: What You Don't Know Will Hurt You 

Identifying Financial Tricks of the Trade
In life and in business, people seek rules or shortcuts that will put complicated
processes or data into simple, easily understood terms. In that spirit, when
looking at a company’s financial situation — certainly about as complicated a
task as anyone could imagine — businesspeople like to use a variety of financial
tools to derive powerful but simple ratios to measure performance. We take a
look at these tools in this section.
As you read through the financial ratios in this section, keep in mind that
they can vary considerably for companies in different industries.
Manufacturing companies, as a group, have different ratios than consulting
firms or utilities. Be sure that when you compare one company’s numbers
with the numbers for another, you’re comparing apples with apples and
oranges with oranges. However, some ratios — many of which we explain
here — are common to all businesses.
Liquidity ratios: Measuring solvency
Liquidity ratios are ratios that measure the solvency of a business — its ability
to generate the cash necessary to pay its bills and meet other short-term
financial obligations.
Current ratio
The current ratio is the ability of a business to pay its current liabilities out of
its current assets. Here’s how the current ratio works (along with an example):
Current ratio = Current assets ÷ Current liabilities
= $250 million ÷ $100 million
= 2.5
In this example, the 2.5 ratio says that the company has $2.50 dollars in
assets for every $1.00 in liabilities. In general, a ratio of 2.0 or better is good;
in fact, many banks require that their borrowers maintain a current ratio of
2.0 or higher as a condition of their loans.
Quick ratio (acid test)
The quick ratio — also known as the acid test — is a measure of a business’s
ability to pay its current liabilities out of its current assets. However, the
quick ratio subtracts inventory out of the current assets, providing an even
more rigorous test of a firm’s ability to pay its current liabilities quickly.
211
Chapter 12: Deciphering the Mysteries of Financial Planning and Analysis

Inventory often is difficult to convert to cash because it may be obsolete (or,
in the case of some fraudulent practices, nonexistent). Here’s how the quick
ratio works:
Quick ratio = (Current assets – Inventory) ÷ Current liabilities
= ($250 million – $20 million) ÷ $100 million
= 2.3
A ratio of 1.1 or higher is considered to be acceptable.
Activity ratios: Can you raise the cash?
Activity ratios are indications of how efficient your company is at using its
resources to generate revenue. The faster and more efficiently your firm can
generate cash, the stronger it is financially and the more attractive it is to
investors and lenders. And the less likely it is that managers will be laid off!
Receivables turnover ratio
The receivables turnover ratio indicates the average amount of time that your
company takes to convert its receivables into cash. The ratio is a function of
how quickly your company’s customers and clients pay their bills; basically,
it points out problems that your company may be having in the collections
process. Here’s how it works:
Receivables turnover ratio = Net sales ÷ Accounts receivable
= $100 million ÷ $15 million
= 6.67
The higher the ratio, the better (and the bigger your bonus — congratulations!).
Average collection period
You can discover a very interesting piece of information by using your receiv-
ables turnover ratio (see the previous section). By dividing 365 days by your
receivables turnover ratio, you find out the average number of days that your
company takes to turn over its accounts receivable. This result is known as
the average collection period. Here’s the breakdown:
Average collection period = 365 days ÷ Receivables turnover ratio
= 365 days ÷ 6.67
= 54.7 days

In this case, the lower the number, the better; a low number indicates that
your customers are paying their bills quickly, which gives you more cash to
work with.
Inventory turnover ratio
The inventory turnover ratio provides an idea of how quickly your company
turns over inventory (sells it off and replaces it with new inventory) during a
specific period of time. This information represents the ability of your firm to
convert inventory into cash. The higher the number, the more often you turn
over inventory — a good thing. Figure 12-2 shows an example.
Debt (or leverage) ratios: Avoiding
the borrowing blues
For most organizations, going into debt is a normal part of doing business.
Debt can plug holes when cash flows can’t cover all your necessary operating
expenses for short periods of time. Debt also allows companies that are
growing quickly to finance their expansion. However, you can have too much
of a good thing; too much debt, for instance, can be a financial drag on any
organization. For your measuring pleasure, debt ratios are measures of how
much debt a company is carrying and who’s financing the debt.
Debt-to-equity ratio
The debt-to-equity ratio measures the extent to which a company is financed
by outside creditors versus shareholders and owners. Here’s how it works:
Debt-to-equity ratio = Total liabilities ÷ Owners’ equity
= $100 million ÷ $150 million
= 0.66
A high ratio (anything more than 1.0) is considered bad because it indicates
that your company may have difficulty paying back its creditors.

Debt-to-assets ratio
The debt-to-assets ratio measures how much of a company’s assets are
financed by outside creditors versus the percentage that the owners cover. In
other words, you divide the long-term liabilities you have by your total assets:
Debt-to-assets ratio = Long-term liabilities ÷ Total assets
= $50 million ÷ $500 million
= 0.10
Ratios of up to 0.50 are considered acceptable; anything more may be a sign
of trouble. (Note, however, that most manufacturing firms have debt-to-asset
ratios between 0.30 and 0.70.)
Profitability ratios: The return of return
Except for new start-up companies — which aren’t expected to make money
right out of the gate — all companies are expected to generate profit from
their operations. And, as with sales and revenue, the more profit you generate,
the merrier your owners and shareholders/investors will be. Profitability ratios
indicate the effectiveness of management in controlling expenses and earning
a reasonable return for shareholders and owners.
Profit ratio
The profit ratio is a measure of how much profit your company generates for
each dollar of revenue after you account for all costs of normal operations.
The inverse of this percentage (100 percent-profit ratio) equals the expense
ratio, or the portion of each sales dollar that’s accounted for by expenses
from normal operations. The higher the ratio, the better. Here’s how to calcu-
late a company’s profit ratio:
Profit ratio = Net income ÷ Net sales
= $50 million ÷ $100 million
= 0.5
The expected ratio can vary considerably from industry to industry. For
example, although grocery stores — which make money by turning over high
volumes of inventory quickly — generally are satisfied with profit ratios of
just a couple percent, many software developers have profit ratios of 30 to 40
percent or more.
Gross margin
The gross margin is an indication of the profitability of a firm. To determine
gross margin, you use your sales revenues and gross profit, which is what’s
214
Part III: Money: What You Don't Know Will Hurt You 

left over after you subtract the cost of goods sold (COGS; the direct costs of
making a product) from revenues. Gross profit tells you how much you have
left to pay overhead costs and make a net profit. Here’s how to calculate
gross margin:
Gross margin ratio = Gross profit ÷ Sales revenues
= $75 million ÷ $100 million
= 0.75
In this example, the company’s COGS is $25 million, which leaves $75 million
(extraordinarily high) to pay overhead. The gross margin is 75 percent, which
is typical for software companies. The gross margin also tells you how much
room you have to make mistakes. An independent grocer with margins of 2 or
3 percent must sell in large volume to compensate for low margins.
Return on investment ratio
Return on investment — better known as ROI — is one of the stars of the world
of financial tools. Return on investment measures the ability of a company to
create profits for its owners. The percentage it spits out represents the number
of dollars of net income earned per dollar of invested capital. As such, ROI is of
great interest to investors, shareholders, and other people with a financial
stake in your company. These folks want to make as much money as they
possibly can on their investment dollars, so the higher the return on investment,
the better! Here’s the calculation breakdown:
Return on investment ratio = Net income ÷ Owners’ equity
= $50 million ÷ $150 million
= 0.33
In this example, a company invests $150 million, resulting in net income of
$50 million and an ROI of 33 percent. This is a very healthy return on the
investment, especially compared to other investments such as putting the
money into a money market fund, which might yield an ROI of only 5 or 6 per-
cent.
Return on assets ratio
The return on assets ratio — also known as ROA — takes the EBIT (earnings
before interest and income tax) that a company earns from the total capital
used to create the profit. In this sense, ROA indicates the effectiveness of a
company’s utilization of capital. Here’s the way to calculate return on assets:
Return on assets ratio = EBIT ÷ Net operating assets
= $75 million ÷ $300 million
= 0.25
215
Chapter 12: Deciphering the Mysteries of Financial Planning and Analysis

Acceptable ROA ratios vary depending on the industry. For example, ratios
below 5 percent are generally indicative of asset-heavy businesses such as
manufacturing and railroads, while ratios of more than 20 percent are indicative
or asset-light companies such as software and advertising firms.
Analyzing Investment Risk
Because nothing in this world is certain but death and taxes (a collective tip of
the hat to Benjamin Franklin), any investment — no matter how conservative —
has some element of risk. Of course, some investments — say, investing in an
unproven new technology — are riskier than others. But investors are con-
stantly making decisions about how much risk they’re willing to bear when they
invest their money, and they weigh this risk against the anticipated reward.
As every manager and business owner knows, a company has limited resources
to fund capital investments — long-term investments in assets such as manufac-
turing equipment, office equipment, buildings, and so on. Therefore, a company
must analyze capital investments by using a set of simple mathematical
equations — equations that are part of the basic toolbox given to MBA students
around the world. Managers and executives regularly use these equations to
help guide their investment decisions.
In the sections that follow, we present the investment analyst toolbox,
equipped with equations, that all MBAers should carry. Proper application of
the tools shows which investment options offer the best returns to your orga-
nization and to its investors.
Net present value (NPV)
Net present value (NPV) is the anticipated profitability of a particular investment,
considering projected cash flows discounted by a risk factor that takes into
account inflation, level of risk, and returns required. In simpler terms, you
compare a dollar invested today to projected dollars generated from the
investment at some point in the future — the time value of the money. By
calculating NPV, you can determine whether your company should pursue 
a particular investment — in capital equipment or other assets.
Following is the official formula for calculating net present value. However, we
suggest that you bypass much of the heavy lifting here by using tables readily
available on the Net or in financial reference books to obtain your discount
rates. Then you can simply multiply the discount rates from the tables times
your annual cash flows to calculate NPV.
t is the time of the cash flow.
n is the total time of the project.

r is the discount rate.
Ct is the net cash flow (the amount of cash) at time t.
C0 is the capital outlay at the beginning of the investment time (t = 0).
For example, say that you’re thinking about acquiring a building for $1 million
for your business. Also assume for a moment that your financial projections
suggest that the building generates the following cash flows during the
course of five years:
Year 1: –$1 million (acquisition cost)
Year 2: $300,000
Year 3: $400,000
Year 4: $400,000
Year 5: $350,000
Net total: $450,000
On the surface, it appears that this investment is a sure winner. It’s projected
to generate a profit during five years of $450,000, on top of the initial acquisi-
tion cost of $1 million. But, not so fast! The time value of money will reduce
this outcome. Why? Because money in your hands today — right now — is
worth more than money in the future. Assuming a cost of capital (risk factor,
in other words) of 9 percent, the actual NPV works out as follows:

value
Although the investment won’t produce the $450,000 of profit that you
thought it would, $168,723 isn’t exactly bad news. At least NPV gives you a
more realistic picture on which to compare this particular investment against
others you may make, along with a reasonable basis to make a decision.

When working with NPV, you need to keep the following points in mind:
 When NPV is greater than 0, the investment is adding value to your firm.
If it offers more value than competing investments, you should pursue it.
 When NPV is less than 0, the investment is taking value away from your
business and you should reject it.
 When NPV equals 0, there’s usually no advantage to pursuing the invest-
ment, unless you’re investing for other factors — such as positioning in
your industry or securing important customers.
Internal rate of return (IRR)
Internal rate of return (IRR) is another approach to determining whether the
return of a particular investment makes it worthwhile to pursue. IRR is
simply the rate of return that the investment produces or the reward for
making the investment. IRR is related to the NPV in that it represents the dis-
count rate in which the NPV of a cash flow stream (inflows and outflows)
equals zero. In fact, IRR and NPV are two sides of the same coin. With NPV,
you discount a future stream of cash flows by your minimum desired rate of
return. With IRR, you actually compute your break-even rate of return.
Therefore, you use a discount rate above which you’d have a negative NPV
(and a poor investment) and below which you’d have a positive NPV (and a
great investment, all things being equal). IRR often is used to compare a
potential investment against current rates of return in the securities market.
When calculating IRR, you make the present value of an investment’s cash
flow equal to the cost of the project. The result is an interest rate — say, 5
percent — that you can then compare to the interest rates of other invest-
ments. In equation form, IRR looks like

Assume for example, the following series of net cash flows:
Initial = I(0) = –$1,000,000
Year 1 = I(1) = $1,750,000
Year 2 = I(2) = $1,750,000
Year 3 = I(3) = $1,750,000
To solve this equation, plug in the initial investment of $1,000,000 and net
cash flows of $1,750,000 for each of the three years. Next, using an iterative
process, insert a number into the IRR variable. Does the NPV equal zero?

Probably not. So increase or decrease the IRR a bit, and keep doing so until
the NPV equals zero. Eventually, you’ll get your answer. Or you could simply
use a calculator with a built-in IRR function. In this example, the IRR that
results in an NPV of zero is 166 percent.
Payback period
The payback period equation gives you a way to calculate how long it will
take to earn back the money from a particular investment. You calculate pay-
back period by using the following formula:
Payback period = Investment ÷ Annual cash inflow
For example, if you have a project that requires an initial investment of $1
million, and the investment generates annual revenues of $250,000, you calcu-
late the payback period as follows:
Payback period = 1,000,000 ÷ 250,000
= 4 years
The lower the number — indicating a faster payback period — the better
because the investment will become profitable sooner.
Profitability index
Profitability index — also known as the benefit-cost ratio — gives you a way to
evaluate different investment proposals that have determined net present
values. You calculate profitability index by using the following formula:
Profitability index = Present value of future cash flows (NPV)
÷ Initial investment
For example, say that your initial investment in a capital item is $1 million.
The present value of future cash flows for the item is $1,450,000. You calcu-
late the profitability index for this item as follows:
Profitability index = 1,450,000 ÷ 1,000,000
= 1.45
The higher the profitability index moves above 1.0, the better the investment
is for your firm.

Reading an Annual Report: A How-To
Without a doubt, annual reports — more formally known as annual reports to
shareholders, and distinctly different from the 10-K annual reports that the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires of public companies —
are at the pinnacle of corporate communication. With their glowing words,
evocative photographs, and lovely, full-color graphs, annual reports can be
very compelling reading. The point of the annual report is to provide a
summary of exactly how a company has performed in the preceding year, as
well as to provide a glimpse of the future. The report is the best source of infor-
mation for most people to determine the financial health of a company and to
learn of any potential problems or opportunities.
Building a compelling annual report is a real art and science affair, and more
than a few consulting firms are doing very well, thank you, by hiring them-
selves out to create reports for all kinds of companies.
The nine parts of the annual report
Reading an annual report can be a daunting prospect if you don’t know exactly
what you’re looking for and where to find it. The good news, however, is that
most reports are now standardized around a common model of nine key
parts; this organization makes it easy to review any company’s annual report
after you get the hang of it. Here are the nine parts, generally presented in the
following order:
 Letter from the chairman: The letter from the chairman of the board is
the traditional place for a company’s top management team to explain
what a great job it did during the preceding year and to lay out the
company’s goals and strategies for the future. The letter also is a great
place to find apologies for problems that occurred during the year,
which may or may not have been solved. Oops!
 Sales and marketing: This section contains complete information about
a company’s products and services, as well as descriptions of its major
divisions and groups and what they do. When reading this section, you
should be able to figure out which products are most important to a
company and which divisions or groups are most critical to the com-
pany’s success.
 Ten-year summary of financial results: If the company is at least ten years
old, its annual report contains a presentation of financial results during
that period of time. This section is a terrific place to look for trends in
growth (or nongrowth) of revenues and profit and other leading indicators
of a company’s financial success.
220
Part III: Money: What You Don't Know Will Hurt You 

 Management discussion and analysis: This section is the place where a
company’s management team has the opportunity to present a candid
discussion of significant financial trends within the company during the
past couple years.
 Letter of CPA opinion: To be considered reliable, a company’s financial
statements have to be reviewed and audited for accuracy by a Certified
Public Accountant (CPA). In this letter, a CPA firm states any qualifica-
tions that it has with the company’s financial statements. These state-
ments can have great bearing on the reliability of the data or of
management’s assessment of it.
 Financial statements: Financial statements are the bread and butter of
the annual report. This section is where a company presents its financial
performance data. At a minimum, expect to see an income statement, a
balance sheet, and a cash-flow statement.
Be sure to watch for footnotes to the financial statements and read them
carefully. You often find valuable information about an organization’s
structure and financial status that hasn’t been publicized elsewhere in the
report. For example, you may notice information on a management reorga-
nization or details on a bad debt that was written off by the company.
 Subsidiaries, brands, and addresses: Here you find listings of company
locations — domestic and foreign — as well as contact information,
brand names, and product lines.
 List of directors and officers: Corporations typically have boards of
directors — senior businesspeople from both inside and outside the
organizations — to help guide them and to provide a broader view of
markets and business environments than what’s seen by internal man-
agers. Officers include the president, chief executive officer (CEO), vice
presidents, chief financial officer (CFO), and so forth.
 Stock price history: This section gives a brief history of the company’s
stock prices and dividends, showing upward and downward trends over
time. Included is information on a company’s stock symbol and the list-
ing stock exchange — for example, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
or NASDAQ.
If you want to read a company’s annual report but can’t find it, you can go
online. With the help of online search engines, finding a company’s annual
report is easier than ever. Many companies also have Investor Relations
pages on their Web sites where you can find copies of annual reports and
quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For example,
in 2006, General Electric created an interactive annual report on its site. You
can check it out at www.ge.com/ar2006. The site even features a video of
the Chairman of the Board and the CEO talking about how they’re going to
build a better company.

Analyzing the annual report
An annual report is the best tool that the public has to review the perfor-
mance of a company. Most annual reports contain plenty of useful informa-
tion. But now that you have all this terrific info, what should you do with it?
We thought you’d never ask! You can analyze the information in a report to
get a sense of the near- and long-term health of a firm.
Here are some definite musts when it comes to reading and analyzing an
annual report:
 Review the company’s financial statements and look for trends in
profitability, growth, stability, and dividends. Refer to the section
“Identifying Financial Tricks of the Trade,” earlier in this chapter, to
check the most common financial ratios.
 Read the report thoroughly to pick out hints that the company is
poised for explosive growth — or on the brink of disaster. Places to
look for such hints include the letter from the chairman, the sales and
marketing section, and the management discussion and analysis. Of
course, it also pays to keep an eye on the company through the business
press and analyst reports. (For some tips on recognizing an impending
disaster, see the upcoming sidebar.)
 Carefully read the letter of CPA opinion. Be sure that the firm agrees
that the company’s financial statements are an accurate portrayal of its
financial reality.
 Carefully read any footnotes to the financial statements. These foot-
notes often contain information about company assumptions that can
be critical to a full understanding of the financial statements.

Seven deadly sins: Annual report edition
Annual reports consist of equal parts marketing
glitz, feel-good platitudes, and hard financial
data. After you get past all the hype, plenty of
interesting data is just waiting to be viewed and
analyzed. As you review the data in an annual
report, stay on the lookout for the following seven
deadly warning signs:
 Revenues stagnant or falling: By comparing
a company’s revenues across two or more
years, you can get a sense of how fast its
revenues are growing. You also can see
whether revenues are likely to continue to
trend upward in the future. When revenues
stop growing — or, worse, begin to fall —
this is a major warning sign of trouble within
the organization. Stagnant or falling rev-
enues can be the result of all kinds of prob-
lems: poor product quality, increased market
competition, or internal management prob-
lems, to name a few. You have to decide
whether this change is a one-time aberration
or a trend that’s going to get worse before it
gets better. To find out more, search for arti-
cles in the financial press that discuss the

223
Chapter 12: Deciphering the Mysteries of Financial Planning and Analysis
company and its prospects, as well as
prospects for the industry as a whole.
 Earnings per share inconsistent with the
company’s profit: The value of a company’s
stock is to some extent based on the firm’s
profitability and the number of shares in the
hands of investors. So, if profit increases 15
percent from one year to the next, you may
expect the earnings per share of stock to
also increase by 15 percent. This won’t be
the case if the company dilutes (reduces)
the value of the stock by issuing more
shares during the course of the year. If
earnings per share are lagging behind the
company’s profitability, raise the red flag
because this requires further investigation.
Be aware, however, that stock price fre-
quently is affected by things that have
nothing to do with the business itself. For
example, institutional investors, concerned
about a recent announcement from the fed-
eral government, may pull their investments
out of the sector, driving the price down.
 Indications of financial distress: A com-
pany can have phenomenal growth in sales
and profit but still go out of business. Have
you ever heard someone who went out of
business lament that he or she was a victim
of his or her own success? As odd as it
sounds, it can happen. If a company isn’t
solvent — in other words, it doesn’t have
enough cash in the bank to cover its current
liabilities — it’s in trouble. Run some num-
bers on companies of interest — specifi-
cally, a quick ratio and an acid-test ratio —
to see whether they’re solvent. If the results
are marginal and the trend is downward,
the ratio doesn’t bode well for the future.
 Unusual gains or losses: Although every
company goes through natural and regular
business cycles during the course of
months or years, unusual gains or losses can
be red flags deserving of your attention.
Unusual gains or losses are to be expected
from time to time, but they should be just
that — unusual. Ongoing unusual gains or
losses are cause for concern because they
indicate a fundamental problem in the com-
pany’s ability to manage its operations and
finances.
 Profit ratios falling:Because profit is the best
measure of success for many companies,
growing — or, at minimum, maintaining —
profit ratios is an important goal of man-
agement. If a company’s profit ratios are
falling from year to year, the financial health
of the firm is in clear jeopardy. Something in
the company is broken and needs to be fixed.
 Adverse auditor opinion: For the most part,
the letter of CPA opinion is a perfunctory
exercise that confirms that a company’s
financial 
statements 
are 
accurate.
Occasionally (today it happens more often
because of Sarbanes-Oxley; see Chapter
10), however, a CPA firm takes exception to
a company’s financial results and issues an
adverse opinion. Pay close attention to the
letter of CPA opinion. Watch for words such
as “fairly present” (good) or “adverse opinion”
or “reservations” (bad).
 Disconnect between narrative and finan-
cials: If an annual report’s narrative doesn’t
match up with the realities of the company’s
financial position, you can bet that the com-
pany’s spin doctors are in high gear. The
chairman may go on and on about what a
great job the company did in a tough busi-
ness environment, and about the tremen-
dous prospects for the company in the
future. But if the leading financial indicators
are pointing in a different direction, there’s
more to the report than meets the eye.

t seems you can’t watch a news broadcast today without hearing about
the ups and downs of the financial markets. Sometimes the slightest news
event in the farthest reaches of the world can send investors into a spiral of
selling or buying. The volatility of the financial markets is something that
should interest all businesspeople as well as those seeking to diversify their
portfolios of investments. The reason is that when the market is on a roller-
coaster ride, business owners, who often have stock portfolios as a cushion
for down times, start conserving their expenditures, which then affects the
revenues of other companies, such as advertising firms, that provide
products and services to the business.
In this chapter, you get the full picture on securities markets — the stock market
and the bond market, and you uncover some effective investing techniques. We
don’t cover many other types of investments in this chapter in depth —
options, metals, collectibles, and so on — because stocks and bonds are the
staple of the investment community and certainly a good place to start.

226
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 
Grasping the Secondary Market
The financial market, in which securities are traded (such as stocks and
bonds), is divided into two segments:
 A secondary market, which consists of existing securities
 A primary market, which consists of new securities created when compa-
nies seek investment capital in exchange for equity in their companies
(check out Chapter 14 for more info)
Within the secondary market, you find the major stock exchanges that you
often hear about in the news: the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the
American Stock Exchange (AMEX), the NASDAQ Stock Market, the Tokyo
Lessons from the investment master
Benjamin Graham was arguably the most
famous and successful investment advisor of
the 20th century. He’s been called the “father of
value investing,” and Warren Buffet — one of
the most successful investors of all time —
claims that he learned his investment principles
from Graham. Graham’s book, The Intelligent
Investor (HarperBusiness Essentials), is still the
investor’s bible decades after his death. During
his life, Graham developed a set of fundamen-
tal, common-sense principles, outlined in his
classic book, that are still valuable today:
 A stock is an ownership interest in a busi-
ness whose underlying value is indepen-
dent of its share price.
 The stock market constantly sways from
“unsustainable optimism” to “unjustified
pessimism.” An intelligent investor will sell
to optimists and buy from pessimists.
 The future value of any investment is
dependent on the price you paid for it today.
The higher the price, the lower the return.
 If you never overpay for an investment, you
reduce the downside of being wrong, some-
thing you can never avoid.
 Strive to be a disciplined, not an emotional,
investor. Invest patiently, but with confi-
dence that you’ve done your homework.
The last principle is particularly important. We’ve
seen too many investors being swayed by the
mood of the market — a follow-the-herd-over-
the-cliff mentality. For instance, we saw it in 1999
when technology and Internet stocks were rock-
eting into the stratosphere. At that time, fund
managers claimed that the only stocks worth
owning were Internet stocks. Alberto Vilar of
Amerindo Technology Fund was one of those
people. After seeing his fund increase by 248.9
percent in 1999, he suffered one of the most dev-
astating financial disasters in the history of
mutual funds because he was heavily invested
in Internet stocks. Had you invested $10,000 in his

Had Graham been alive, would he have weath-
ered the storm? Probably. We say that because
he survived the stock market crashes of
1929–1932, and until he retired in 1956, his fund

Stock Exchange (TSE), and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), to name
just a few. You also find dealer or over-the-counter market (OTC) where securi-
ties are not listed on an exchange but are traded through a network of mid-
dlemen, and numerous Futures Exchanges for trading commodities (such as
crude oil, soybeans, and gold). This section gives you a brief overview of the
secondary market. The rest of this chapter delves into specific aspects of the
secondary market.
Stock exchanges
Most people think of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) when they think of
the stock market. The NYSE is the largest exchange in the world, and only
companies that meet specific minimum requirements on earning power, total
value of outstanding stock, and number of shareholders can join. What
exactly do we mean by a stock exchange? A stock exchange is simply a volun-
tary organization that’s formed to provide a way to trade securities and facili-
tate the payments of dividends and income. The members of the stock
exchange own “seats” on the exchange, and they’re the only people who can
trade on the floor of the exchange. The memberships in the exchange also
are traded, and their prices vary with the stock market ups and downs.
Orders to buy and sell always go through members of the exchange.
In exchanges that have trading floors, such as the NYSE, you see a form of
controlled chaos. The floor of a stock exchange is an actual place, and it’s a
hotbed of activity. If you visit the floor of the NYSE, you’ll see that it contains
an enormous amount of communications equipment and computers, because
the members must have access to information from the outside as well as the
capability to handle stock transactions from investors. You’ll also see a
variety of people on the floor, from actual investors to wire services people,
exchange employees, and brokers who take orders from the public. At times,
it looks as though they’re all shouting at each other, but bona fide trading is
actually going on.
Over-the-counter markets
Another type of secondary market is the over-the-counter market (OTC). In
this market, no trading floor exists and securities don’t need to be registered
with the SEC. Traders are scattered around the country and their buyers deal
directly with them. The traders are much like retail stores that keep an inven-
tory of stocks, bonds, commodities, or derivatives for sale. A derivative is
basically a security, such as an option (right to buy) or futures contract (con-
tract to buy or sell at a specific date), whose value depends on how its under-
lying asset performs. Derivatives can be contracted for stocks, bonds,
currencies, and commodities, among other things.
227
Chapter 13: Understanding Stocks and Bonds

The NASDAQ market
A third type of secondary market is the NASDAQ, or National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation market. You may know it as the
home of most high-technology companies such as Electronic Arts and, of
course, most of the big Internet companies such as Yahoo! and Google.
NASDAQ is a derivative of the OTC market (see the previous section), but
unlike the OTC, NASDAQ securities must be registered with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC). The NASDAQ is the largest U.S. electronic
stock market and trading takes place via computer and mostly without tele-
phone assistance.
Today, many people trade on the NASDAQ via their computers through discount
brokers, or at locations set up by companies with access to the exchange. The
PC and the Internet have opened up a whole new category of stock investor:
the day trader, an individual who buys and sells multiple times in a single day
to make quick profits. However, day traders typically work on borrowed money,
which can be very risky if their bets don’t pay off. Day trading is like gambling.
If you have the stomach for it and the enormous amount of time it takes to
monitor the market, day trading might be for you. Just make sure that you’re
trading with money you can afford to lose, or you may be in trouble very
quickly.
Understanding Stocks
A stock is essentially an ownership interest in a company that may be private
or public and listed on one of the stock exchanges. For purposes of this chap-
ter, we talk about stock in a publicly traded company. Owning stock is a way
to participate in the economic growth of the nation as well as the global
economy. Purchasing stocks traditionally is a great way to hedge inflation
and achieve good returns on investments over the long term.
The general rule is that you’ll make money in stocks if you hold them at least
five years. The following sections provide more advice about the types of
stocks available, as well as other business issues to consider.
Types of stock
Two basic types of stock exist: preferred and common. Each is quite different
from the other, so it’s important that you understand these differences before
you purchase.
228
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

Preferred stock
In general, preferred stock doesn’t carry voting rights in a company, but it
does have a guaranteed dividend or payout (usually quarterly) that’s a per-
centage of its par value. That guaranteed dividend is what you receive for
giving up voting rights. (Par value is simply the face value of the stock at pur-
chase or at the date at which dividends are declared.)
Common stock
Common stock is the basic form of ownership in a corporation — no corpora-
tion can exist without it. Common stock has what’s known as a residual claim
on the assets of a company. Residual claim means that common stockholders
get paid after all other claimants are paid. Consequently, common stock is
more risky than preferred stock, but the shareholder’s liability is limited to
the amount of the shareholder’s investment in the company.
Common stockholders enjoy cash dividend rights and voting rights, and they
may also benefit from stock dividends and stock splits:
 With a stock dividend, the company issues stock rather than cash — usually
as a percentage of the shareholder’s existing shares. For example, a
company may issue 0.08 shares for each share an investor owns.
 In a stock split, the percentage increase in the number of shares you hold
goes up by more than 25 percent. Suppose that you hold 100 shares of
stock in XYZ Corporation, trading at $60 a share — making the total
value of your holdings $6,000. Now, suppose that the company declares
a two-for-one stock split. This means that you now hold 200 shares, but
they’re valued at $30 each at the time of the split.
One reason companies choose to do stock splits is to keep their per-share
values at a level most investors can tolerate. It’s conceivable that if a company
didn’t split its stock, the price could go beyond the affordability of most
investors.
Stock quotes
A stock quote is simply a listing of prices for a stock at a specific point during
the trading day. It provides the basic information you need to check on the
status of any stock in your portfolio. Look to Figure 13-1 to see an example of
an online stock quote from The Wall Street Journal for Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC).
229
Chapter 13: Understanding Stocks and Bonds

Here’s a summary of the information that the stock quote provides:
 The stock closed at $34.17 (Last) — a decline of $0.25 from its price at the
closing of the market the previous day ($34.42).
 The stock opened at $34.11; during the trading day, it was traded as high
as $34.49 and as low as $33.84.
 The total number of Wells Fargo shares traded during the day was
12,030,651; the volume for previous day was higher, at 19,725,506.
 For the previous 52 weeks, the stock had traded at a high of $36.99 and a
low of $33.01.
Note: The quote also displays a graph of the previous ten days of stock
value; the graph indicates a lot of movement in the stock price on a daily
basis.
Observe that investors received a dividend of $0.31 per share on September 1,
2007, which amounted to a 3.6-percent dividend yield (the amount of dividends
paid per share over a year divided by the stock price). Also note that on August
14, 2006, investors received a 100-percent stock dividend (one for one). Wells

Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

Fargo has more than 3 billion shares outstanding (held by investors) and more
than $3 billion in public float, which is the amount held by investors who
aren’t company officers, directors, or controlling-interest investors (10 per-
cent or more of the outstanding stock).
Moving to the stock data, you can see that the market cap for the company is
$115 billion. This is how much money you’d need to purchase all the shares
of the company at its current price per share.
The P/E ratio (price/earnings) — which is the market value per share divided
by the earnings per share — typically reflects the company’s last four quar-
ters of earnings. A high P/E ratio normally forecasts higher earnings growth
in the future, making it a good way to compare one company with another
within the same industry. Sometimes called a multiple, the ratio tells you how
much investors will pay per dollar of earnings. In the case of Wells Fargo, a
P/E of 13.20 suggests that investors are willing to pay $13.00 for every $1.00
of earnings the company generates.
When investing, don’t ever make a decision to invest based solely on P/E
ratio, because the figure is only as good as the basis on which the earnings
were determined. You need to go back to the financial statements to check
how earnings were calculated. The P/E ratio is just one metric to consider
before making a decision. We discuss other metrics in the section on “Investing
in Stocks.”
Investing in Stocks
Everyone has an opinion on the best way to pick a winning stock. This sec-
tion explains in detail three popular strategies for picking stocks: value
investing, going for dividend growth, and picking businesses you like.
Bargain hunter: Value investing
If you’re the kind of person who never buys a new car so you can avoid the
immediate depreciation in value as you drive it off the lot, or if you’re the kind
of person who spends hours looking for the best bargain, value investing may
be for you. Value investors in the stock market look for cheap stocks that don’t
make the news because either everyone has left them for dead or they’re just
not sexy enough. Well, some cheap stocks may make the news if they’re partic-
ularly bad, but for the most part, you’ll find these stocks by looking for ugly,
boring securities with low price/earnings ratios (less than ten times earnings
during the past year). You also can discover them by looking for stocks that
the analysts aren’t crowding around.
231
Chapter 13: Understanding Stocks and Bonds

Deciding when to buy is more art than science, but if you determine that a
stock is a great buy at 10, you can deduce that it’s an even better buy at 8.
With a great stock, you should buy more as it’s going down and sell off when
it goes up past your lowest average cost. Unfortunately, most investors do
just the opposite; they sell off a good stock as it’s going down in price and
buy as it’s going up.
Dividend growth hunters
Investors seeking dividend growth aren’t interested in the current yield on a
stock. They’re more interested in finding companies whose dividends
increase on a regular basis during a long period of time. Rising dividends
often are the signs of a successful company because
 You need excess cash to distribute dividends.
 A regularly rising dividend may indicate a friendly and somewhat stable
business environment — a very positive indicator.
Of course, you don’t want to focus on growing dividends in a vacuum. You
also want to look at a company’s P/E (price/earnings) ratio to make sure that
it’s in line with other companies in the industry. The P/E ratio is the ratio of
the price of one share of stock to the earnings per share of the company (see
the section “Stock quotes”). It’s a multiple, such as 5 or 10. If a company
you’re considering for investment purposes has a multiple of 5 times earn-
ings per share, while similar companies in the industry have multiples of 10
times earnings per share, you may want to do some further investigation to
find out why such a discrepancy exists.
Investing in companies you like
The strategy of investing in companies you like is one followed by some very
successful investors, such as Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, and Peter Lynch.
The strategy is to invest in companies that have products and services you use
and believe in. The interesting thing about such companies is that they often
also meet the criteria we discuss in the value investing section, so combining
value investing with this strategy makes sense. Here’s how to make this strategy
work for you:
 Think about a product or service you currently use. Investigate the com-
pany that makes it and determine whether the manufacturer is a public
company.
 Determine whether other people have also discovered this company. To
find out, compare its price/earnings (PE) ratio with its current growth
232
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

rate or projected growth rate. Typically, you want a stock with a P/E ratio
lower than its earnings growth rate.
 Call the company to ask about projected profits and anything else that may
help you to make a sound investment decision. Most public companies
have designated shareholder liaisons who will answer your questions and
see to it that you receive any materials you want to study.
Joining Forces: Mutual Funds
A mutual fund is a portfolio of stocks that’s managed by a professional company.
Investing in a mutual fund is a way to avoid the risk of picking individual stocks.
The fund manager’s strategy for selecting stocks depends on the goal of the
mutual fund (growth, annuity, and so forth), but, in general, the manager wants
to spread the risk over a fairly large number of stocks so that a loss on any one
stock does not significantly damage the return on the entire fund. Mutual funds
are also probably the safest and least costly way to invest in lucrative foreign
stocks, which have different fee structures and reporting requirements.
Mutual funds are very popular investment vehicles for several other reasons:
 Finding the best mutual funds is now easier because many publications
in print or on the Internet are evaluating various funds and giving advice
to consumers.
 You can rely on the expertise of a professional money manager hired by
the mutual fund.
 You can achieve a diversified portfolio (one with a variety of different
types of stocks and bonds, in other words) with relatively little money.
 Although you may not beat the averages in the short term, you’ll do well
over the long term.
One substantial disadvantage of mutual funds has to do with the associated
tax implications. When you invest in mutual funds, you receive an annual
statement of investment gains in the form of income and capital-gains distrib-
utions, as well as a report on any dividend distributions, which are taxed as
ordinary income. Whether or not you reinvest these gains, you have to pay
taxes on them, and it’s difficult to know in advance how much you’ll be liable
for. If you invest in individual stocks, on the other hand, you can decide when
to take profits and pay taxes on them.
So many mutual funds, how can you possibly choose? Here’s a simple guide
to follow:
233
Chapter 13: Understanding Stocks and Bonds

 Decide which types of funds you want to own. Among the many
choices are
• A single, broad-based fund that buys a variety of different types of
stocks and bonds
• Specialized funds (for example, high-growth funds)
• Foreign-stock funds
• An emerging-markets fund that focuses on new markets and newer
companies
The choice of fund will depend on your financial goals, how old
you are, and how much you have to invest.
 Identify the costs associated with the fund. Recognize that foreign-
stock funds generally have higher costs, for instance. Don’t choose
funds that have costs higher than industry averages. Look at what other
funds of the same type are charging.
We also suggest you look seriously at no-load funds. These funds charge
no sales fees and don’t use brokers to deal with the public. All your
money is invested in the fund.
 Consider the risks associated with the fund. With a more diversified
stock fund, you can better manage your risk. You can even choose funds
that invest exclusively in more conservative stocks.
If you’re looking for conservative stocks, stay away from those classified
as “growth,” “aggressive growth,” or “capital appreciation.” Also, look at
how the fund performed in key years of market turmoil, such as 1987,
1990, 1994, 2000, and 2001. If it performed badly, don’t invest. You can
find performance figures and risk ratings by looking in such publications
as the Morningstar Mutual Funds and The Value Line Mutual Fund Survey.
 Look at the fund’s track record. Be sure to compare apples to apples —
foreign stock funds with foreign stock funds, for instance. Also make
sure that the overall performance figure of the fund isn’t based on one
or two years; a good fund has consistently performed well over a pro-
tracted period of time.
 Find out who’s managing the fund. Every fund has one person who’s a
key stock picker. Make sure that this person has a successful track
record and plans to be around for a while.
Mutual funds aren’t perfect financial vehicles for investment. They often
underperform the market while demonstrating fairly erratic performance
behavior in general. Nevertheless, if held over a long period of time — say, 20
years or more — with regular investment, they’ll typically outperform most
professional investors. The key is holding them for a long time. (For more
about mutual funds, check out Mutual Funds For Dummies, 5th Edition, by Eric
Tyson [Wiley].)

Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

Bonds: When Debt Makes Sense
Bonds are debt securities where the issuer of the bond promises to repay the
holder of the bond — you — the principal (what was borrowed) and interest
at some future date. Unlike stock, the bond holder doesn’t have equity or an
ownership stake in the company or governmental agency that issues the bond.
Basically, three types of entities issue bonds: the U.S. government, corporations,
and municipalities.
U.S. government bonds
The U.S. government is the largest debtor in the world — about $9 trillion as
of press time. And you thought you had a lot of debt! The government
borrows more money than anyone through two types of debt instruments:
Treasury debt and federal agency debt.
Treasury debt
We assume many of you have purchased Treasury bills (T-bills), notes, and
savings bonds. They’re all debt instruments, but they differ in their maturity
date. Take a look at Table 13-1 to see a comparison.
Table 13-1

Treasury notes 
$1,000
2, 5, and 10 years
(T-notes)
Savings bonds
$25/$50

(Series EE and I)
If you look at the returns on bills and bonds over a long period of time, you
find that Treasury bill investors have never lost any money, because the gov-
ernment typically pays these on time. On the other hand, those who have
invested in Treasury bonds have experienced a loss in a given year, even
though the government actually paid the bonds when due. What this means
is that in a year with a loss, the decrease in the bond price was greater than
the interest income the investor received.
You can find out what the various Treasure instruments are paying by looking
in the financial section of a major newspaper (such as The Wall Street Journal
or the Los Angeles Times) or by going online. Treasuries are sold through
235
Chapter 13: Understanding Stocks and Bonds

more than 150 competitive auctions throughout the year. You can find the
schedule for these auctions at www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-
finance/debt-management/auctions.
Federal agency debt
Many federal agencies (called government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs)
issue debt. Some include the Government National Mortgage Association
(GNMA, pronounced “Ginnie Mae”), federal home loan banks, federal farm
credit system banks, and the U.S. Postal Service. Experts estimate that there’s
$2.3 trillion in current outstanding agency debt, which is equivalent to the
economies of several countries!
Corporate bonds
Corporate bonds are the smallest sector of the bond markets. This type of debt
is issued by large corporations that promise to make payments to the bond-
holder over a period of time. In this type of investment, it’s important that you
check on the corporation’s ability to repay. You can do this by looking at the
Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s bond ratings. The rating should give you an idea
of how much risk you’re facing. For help, look at the section “How bonds are
rated” later in this chapter.
Municipal bonds
Municipal bonds are issued by governments and governmental or quasi-gov-
ernmental agencies that aren’t at the federal level. The important thing to
know about municipal bonds is that they’re exempt from federal income taxa-
tion, which makes them very different from other types of bonds. Because
they aren’t taxed, municipal bonds are most valuable to investors who want
to enjoy that extra benefit from a bond investment. To give you an example of
the benefit, it’s possible to achieve the same after-tax return from a low-yield
municipal bond that you do from a high-yield taxable bond.
When you compare bonds that have the same interest rate and maturity, you
should choose the one that has the highest after-tax return. Take the follow-
ing example: Suppose that you’re in the 30 percent marginal tax bracket.
You’d be as satisfied choosing a taxable yield bond returning 12 percent as
you would purchasing a tax-exempt bond yielding 8.4 percent, because the
return is the same. On the other hand, you’re better off choosing a taxable
bond at 12 percent over a tax-exempt bond yielding 7.0 percent, because
even after taxes, the yield would be 8.4 percent — 1.4 percent greater than
the tax-exempt bond.
236
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

Another thing to remember about municipal bonds is that they’re not very
liquid because investors tend to hold onto them to maturity.
How bonds are valued
Bonds generally come in two flavors: pure discount bonds, also known as
zero coupon bonds, and coupon bonds. The difference is simple:
 Zero coupon bonds make no payments to the holders between the
dates they’re issued and the maturity dates. In other words, you get
nothing until the end.
 Coupon bonds make a series of equal payments throughout the life of
the bonds. So, if you’re looking for an annuity, this is the way to go.
As soon as a bond is trading in the bond market, its future payouts are
decided, and the only thing that changes is the asking price. Your yield to
maturity will go up if you can buy the bond at a lower price because bond
prices and yields move in opposite directions.
The amount that a bond pays at maturity is called its par value or face value.
The discount amounts to the difference between the selling price of the bond
and its par value. Whenever you’re dealing with financial assets such as bonds,
you need to understand that the price of a bond is equal to the present value
of any future cash flows generated by the bond.
A zero coupon bond has only one cash flow — the payment made at maturity —
so the price of the bond is the present value of its face value. Here’s an example
to make this explanation clear: Suppose that you’re considering a zero coupon
bond that matures in five years and has a face value of $2,000. Now suppose
that the interest rate is 10 percent. To calculate its present value, use the
formula shown in Figure 13-2 (or your nifty financial calculator that already has
the formula in it).
So, the price you’d pay for this bond today is $1,242.24.

237
Chapter 13: Understanding Stocks and Bonds

Coupon bonds typically pay out semiannually in addition to paying the face
value at maturity, so the value of this financial asset is based on the sum of
the present value of all payments until maturity. For example, suppose you
have a bond that’s selling for $850 with a coupon rate of 8 percent, a maturity
date of five years, and a par value of $1,000. The coupon payment will be $80,
which is 8 percent of $1,000. You can find the yield to maturity through the
following formula, where r = 8 percent:
80(1 + r)-1 + 80(1 + r)-2 + 80(1 + r)-3 + 80(1 + r)-4 + 1,000(1 + r)-4 = $850 (bond
selling price)
Or, if you want to save time and frustration, you can enter the numbers into
your trusty financial calculator. Either way, you’ll get a current yield of 9.412
percent ($80 ÷ $850) and a yield to maturity of 12.180 percent. Not bad!
How bonds are rated
Bonds are rated from AAA to D depending on the rating agency. In general, a
bond that’s rated A is the most secure, given whatever fluctuations may
occur in the economy. If your bond is rated in any of the B categories, there’s
a chance that your issuer may default on the interest payments. Bonds rated
below BBB are called junk bonds and are pretty precarious investments for
the average person.
The two major rating agencies are Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. Table 13-2
shows a breakdown of their rating scales and what they mean.

Why bonds may be good for you . . .
Many investors like bonds because they provide more immediate income
than stocks. In terms of performance, they tend to be less volatile than
stocks, and they often climb while stock prices are falling. In addition, tax-
free municipal bonds are one of a dying breed of tax shelters.
. . . And why bonds may not
be good for you
Every investment has a downside, and bonds are no exception. Here are the
four major negatives related to bonds:
 Companies and governments sometimes default on their interest
payments. What that means to you is that you get hit twice. You lose
your income stream, and the price of your bond may drop as well. To
avoid this problem, be sure to select highly rated bonds. Bonds that are
rated AAA are about as safe as those issued by the U.S. Treasury.
 Interest rates rise. Bond prices are inversely correlated with interest
rates; that is, when interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and the earlier
that happens, the greater the loss to you.
 Investment costs are high. Not only do you have to invest in larger
dollar amounts with bonds, but there are also fees associated with bond
purchases.
 Bonds are sometimes called or paid off before they mature.
Sometimes bond issuers choose to pay off the debt before the maturity
date on the bond. For the bondholder or investor, this situation can
cause a problem, particularly if interest rates have dropped. When you
go to replace the bond with another, you may not be able to find an
equivalent interest rate.
Should I Get Investment Help?
When you consider the tens of thousands of equity securities listed on the
global and domestic stock exchanges, it’s no wonder that people look for
help in making their way through the jungle. In this section, we look at the
world of stock brokerage to see how you can use a stockbroker or financial
advisor to help you make wise investments. We also look at how you can go it
alone, if you choose to.

Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 
Hiring a broker
Many people don’t have the time or inclination to go it alone when it comes to
investing on one of the many stock exchanges. During the worst bear market (a
down market) since the Great Depression — remember the dot-com implosion
in 2000 — even savvy stockbrokers took a bath. Whether you want someone to
blame when your investments go south or you just don’t want to deal with all
the research you’ll have to do to invest wisely, stockbrokers can provide many
valuable services to investors. The following list outlines the services:
 They handle the buying and selling of your stocks, bonds, and other
investments.
 They can help you develop an investment plan that works for you.
 They can help you develop successful investing habits and make you
think about the process more.
 They can encourage you to take risks that you wouldn’t do on your own.
 They can stop you from selling your investments out of panic.
But, in order for you to have a successful relationship with a broker, you need
to keep the broker fully informed, which includes your financial status, what
you’re looking for, and what your goals are. You also need to get educated
about what you’re doing so that you can speak intelligently to the broker. If
you want to be a value investor, you shouldn’t leave all the work in the hands
of your broker. If you don’t do your homework, you run the risk that your
broker will make investments that don’t meet your objectives. Or you may
find yourself with an inexperienced broker who can do you more harm than
good. Worse yet, you may be vulnerable to the strong-arm tactics of an
unscrupulous broker (yes, they do exist).
If a broker/advisor claims to use technical analysis or market timing or claims
average annual returns of more than 10 percent, run the other direction!
Brokers work on commission, so they make money every time you do a trans-
action, whether you buy or sell. And they don’t make money when you don’t
buy or sell. Hence, they have a built-in incentive to get you to turn over or
churn your investments quickly. Today, some brokers have differentiated
themselves by taking fees based on how much your portfolio grew during the
year. They don’t charge transaction fees. Of course, in this scenario, the
incentive is to pick stocks that have long-term growth potential, an approach
that’s generally much more beneficial to you.
Here are some things to do before selecting a broker:
 Talk to friends and business associates to get their recommendations for
brokers with whom they have trusted relationships.

 Contact your state securities department and ask to find the broker’s
listing in the Central Registration Depository. Here, you can find out all
about brokers, including any history of legal problems. You also can
Google your broker’s name and firm to see if any complaints pop up.
Look for words such as fine, lawsuit, and disciplinary action, which are
definitely red flags.
If a potential broker is also a certified financial planner, he or she must be
registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or regulators
in the state where he or she practices. Check out Form ADV — particularly
the Disclosure Reporting pages — where the advisor must disclose any
disciplinary action taken against him or her.
 Conduct an interview with the potential broker. Is the broker interested
in your goals? Does he or she want to help you develop an investment
plan? Or is he or she primarily interested in getting you to buy a few
“glamour” stocks? Be sure to assess whether the broker/advisor has the
required education, skills, and experience to help you.
Going it alone (if you absolutely, 
positively must)
You don’t have to use a broker to invest in stocks and bonds, and that atti-
tude is becoming increasingly more common as investors have direct access
to the buying and selling of stocks over the Internet without an intermediary.
One of the biggest reasons that investors decide to do it themselves is to
avoid the high transaction costs of investing via a broker. However, even with
the do-it-yourself online brokers, little fees can add up. You can also in many
cases buy stock directly from the issuing company. Check a company’s Web
site to see if it participates in direct selling.
According to Jason Zweig, an avid follower of Benjamin Graham’s principles,
if you can’t answer “yes” to the following questions, don’t even consider
going it alone:
 Are you prepared to keep accurate records of all your stock transactions
for tax purposes?
 Are you willing to diversify your portfolio and reduce your risk by
owning 10 to 30 stocks in several industries?
 Are you able to put your portfolio on autopilot — that is, do fewer than
two trades a year?
Stocks and bonds are great investments for people who take the time to
understand the financial markets and seek help.

The Internet has made it easy for potential investors to find all sorts of infor-
mation on companies in which they’re considering investing. The Wall Street
Journal Online (www.wsj.com), Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com),
MSN Money (money.msn.com), and other sites offer a wealth of information
that can, with some study, turn you into an expert on the stock market.
For those who don’t, caveat emptor — let the buyer beware!

M
oney does indeed make the world go ’round. Today, money is available
for every type of business. In fact, there’s so much money floating
around that the money managers are having a hard time; it seems there’s
more money available than great deals to invest in! So, if you’re looking for
money to fund a new venture, to support your current business’s growth, or
to develop new products, the problem isn’t finding money; it’s coming up
with a compelling reason for why the money managers should invest in your
company. In other words, how do you tap into that money so your company
can start growing?
The market for deals involving private equity (an investment in a company in
exchange for an ownership interest) is quite simply overheated and highly
competitive. In fact, the whole picture has flipped upside-down — at one
time, entrepreneurs fought to stand out from the crowd of eager companies
seeking funding; now the private-equity firms are battling to get ahead of the
pack so they can secure deals to keep their investors happy. Who knows how
long this will last, but for entrepreneurs seeking capital at any stage, this is a
happy time (for more, on entrepreneurship, refer to Chapter 3).
The bottom line: You can’t find money for any idea. Investors aren’t stupid. A
company that presents a great investment opportunity will get courted by
the biggest of the big. If your company doesn’t have the potential to scale
and tap a very large market; if you don’t have a “secret sauce” to keep com-
petitors at bay; and if you don’t have a management team that knows how to
grow a company, you’re out of luck. You need to go back to the drawing
board and build something compelling that will get investors excited enough
to invest. Not to worry though. This chapter helps you determine your com-
pany’s financial needs and explains how you can get your hands on some of
the money available in the marketplace.

Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 
How Much Money Do You Really Need?
Setting Up Your Funding Plan
The term “plan” rears its ugly head when you start to figure out your financial
needs. To successfully raise money for your business, you need to have a
plan — as well as a backup plan and probably even a backup-backup plan in
today’s business environment, because your chances of getting it right the
first time (or two) are very slim. The goal is a funding plan that will guide
your search and help you make wise financial decisions.
A funding plan is really quite simple. It has four steps:
1. Carefully determine exactly what your company needs to reach your
goals.
You have to plan for several stages of growth and financing. Initially, you
want to have enough cash to launch the business and survive until the
company is generating enough revenues to cover expenses. Beyond
that, you’ll establish some milestones such as multiple customer seg-
ments, multiple products, and so forth.
2. Target your potential sources for each stage of financing.
Based on the needs you calculate for each stage, you can decide what
kind of money you need and who could potentially be the supplier.
Recognize that some first-round money sources will want to be paid
back or cashed out (get their investments back, in other words) before
the next round of financing, so make sure that you plan for it.
3. With the multi-stage plan defined, look at the various tasks you have
to undertake to achieve your financing goals and get started before
you need the money.
Raising money takes time, so you shouldn’t wait until you need it, when
it will be too late. For example, if you need private investors (called
angels) for your second-round financing, you must start networking now.
Angels don’t just drop from the heavens when you need them. It takes
time to build a business relationship so that you feel comfortable
approaching the person about your financing needs and the person feels
comfortable listening.
4. Keep tabs on your progress against the timeline you set.
If you’re significantly off from your projections, you may need to re-eval-
uate your plan. Perhaps you were a bit too aggressive in your expecta-
tions. Keep in mind that you’re in a hurry; investors aren’t, so allow for
some slack in your overall plan.

As you can see from the funding plan, the kind of money you need to raise
and the sources you need to consider depend on where you are in the life
cycle of your company. Every business goes through several stages, each
with different financial requirements (see Figure 14-1).
The following list explains the three stages of financial need:
 The first stage: This stage covers the period of time from the conception
of the product/service through early start-up. This is where the business
concept is tested to make sure that customers want what you’re offering.
 The second stage: This stage takes over when the concept is proven and
your company is ready to grow to the next level — by entering a new
market, introducing new products, or developing multiple locations.
 The third stage: You reach the third stage when your company is looking
for a liquidity event so investors can cash out, or you want to acquire
another company or be acquired by another company.
Each of these stages has different requirements and accomplishes different
goals, which we cover in the following sections of this chapter.
You should know that high-technology and Internet companies often com-
press these three stages into very short time frames — sometimes months,
and possibly even skipping the first stage altogether. What this illustrates is
that to assess your financial needs, you need to understand the nature of the
industry in which you’re operating, the type of business you have, and your
attractiveness as a company to the capital markets.

Chapter 14: It Takes Money to Make Money

Acquiring First-Stage Money
You know that you’re in the first stage of starting your business when the eas-
iest and most likely source of money comes from your own savings and
“friends, family, and fools” — in other words, people who believe in you and
your business plan. Entrepreneurs aren’t bootstrappers because they want to
be; they do it because they have to. Bootstrapping means finding money and
resources (anything and everything they need) by any means possible,
including begging, borrowing, and bartering.
First-stage money is hard to come by for several reasons:
 New ventures don’t have a track record, so everything that investors
and lenders see in the business plan is pure speculation on the part of
the entrepreneur.
 New ventures often fail, so they represent perhaps the riskiest investment
of all.
 Most new ventures have no intellectual property rights — proprietary
assets or secrets that would give them a competitive advantage in the
marketplace.
 The founders of the venture themselves often don’t have a track record
of successful business endeavors.
 Most start-ups are merely “me-too” ventures; in other words, they haven’t
identified a significant unfair advantage that makes them valuable to
customers and investors.
For these reasons and more, entrepreneurs have to bootstrap — rely on their
own resources and the kindness of friends and family, or anybody else who
will listen to their stories.
Bootstrapping for a new venture has three key principles:
 Hire as few employees as possible. Employees are the single biggest
expense of most businesses.
 Lease, share, and barter everything that you can. When you lease facil-
ities and equipment, you avoid tying up precious capital that you could
use to produce your product or service. Bartering also has become a
popular way to acquire needed resources. In a barter arrangement, you
exchange a product or service that your company offers for something
you need from another company.
 Use other people’s money. You can ethically use other people’s money
in many ways. Getting customers to pay quickly is one way; convincing
suppliers to give you more time to pay is another.
246
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

The next sections give you an idea of what to think about when you’re con-
sidering debt financing for your business or giving an investor an ownership
interest in exchange for equity capital. Both are valuable financial resources,
but you have to know when and how to use them. These sections help you do
just that.
Debt
Debt is a financing source that is, unfortunately, near and dear to many an
entrepreneur’s heart. You know all those credit-card offers that you get in the
mail? Many small businesses don’t throw them away; instead, they’ve started
using credit cards as their credit line for quick cash. It’s an expensive route,
but in a banking environment that isn’t always generous to small businesses,
going into debt sometimes is the only route that owners can take. In this sec-
tion, we look at some of the principal sources of debt capital for start-up and
expansion. (You can find other types of debt financing to solve issues such as
business cycles, cash-flow problems, and so forth. We deal with those topics
in Chapter 12.)
Commercial banks
Banks aren’t very favorable sources of first-stage money for new companies,
which isn’t surprising when you consider that a banker’s first concern is how
a borrower will pay back the loan or credit line. If a start-up company has
little or no track record of sales (and most new companies don’t!), and it’s
offering the bank only projected sales (in other words, blue sky), a banker
won’t have much confidence that repayment is possible.
Bankers operate under very strict guidelines, termed the “five Cs”:
Character, capacity, capital, collateral, and conditions
With no track record and only an estimate of expected sales, a new company
has already violated at least two of the five Cs: capital and capacity.
But what if you can show a track record from a previous business or from
your personal financial status that’s strong enough to warrant a loan?
Depending on how you negotiate the deal, you’ll receive either a secured or
an unsecured note. We’re betting that the note will be secured, meaning that
getting the loan will require some form of collateral. Collateral is an asset of
equivalent value that you pledge against the note, such as your house or a
savings account. If you don’t repay the loan, the bank has the right to repos-
sess or foreclose on the asset.
But even if that happens, your financial obligations don’t stop. Just because
you’ve lost your collateral for defaulting on the loan doesn’t mean that you
aren’t still liable for the loan amount.
247
Chapter 14: It Takes Money to Make Money

Most bankers will ask you to personally guarantee any loan you take out,
which means that in addition to any business assets, you’re also pledging your
personal assets against the loan should you default. Try to avoid this situation
if at all possible. Of course, savvy bankers want to cover themselves any way
possible, and they’re holding all the cards when you really need the dough.
Take the following quiz before making a trip to the commercial bank to see
whether you and your business are ready to apply for a business loan:
1. Does your management team have the skills and experience to execute
your business strategy?
2. Does your company’s financial picture look healthy (positive cash flow,
reasonable profit, some assets)?
3. Does your personal financial statement look positive?
4. Can you identify your first source for repayment of the loan?
5. Do you have a second source for repayment?
6. Do you have additional security that you can use to collateralize the loan?
7. Do you clearly understand how your business and your industry work?
8. Can you demonstrate your character and trustworthiness?
Make sure that you can answer yes to all these questions before you
approach your banker. Set yourself up for success!
Government sources
You can turn to governmental agencies to help fund your start-up business,
which is a good thing because it enables you to borrow back some of your
tax dollars that went into government programs to support small businesses.
Be forewarned, however, that any time you borrow from the government,
you’ll be dealing with a lot of paperwork and time-consuming procedures.
(Remember, it takes money to make money.) Furthermore, the government
moves at glacial speed to respond to requests. Still, many a business owner
has been saved from near death by an SBA loan.
The Small Business Administration (SBA) is an agency that guarantees loans
from commercial lenders for up to 90 percent of the loan amount. So, if you
default on a $100,000 guaranteed loan, the government will reimburse the
lender for $90,000, and the bank will come after you for the rest. Using this
program gives commercial lenders the incentive they need to take risks on
small businesses. However, just as with any banker, the SBA wants to know
that you’ll repay your loan, so it will only lend to a business that has a bit of a
track record and is a healthy business (see the previous section). So, for
start-ups, this may not be a reasonable solution.
248
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

We recommend that you check state agencies and sources for financing as
well. Many states — Wisconsin and South Dakota, for example — have set up
and funded agencies that help new and growing businesses with financing.
Equity
When you seek equity sources of capital, you’re asking people to invest in
your company in exchange for ownership interests, which means that you’re
willing to share ownership of your business. If you’re wondering why you
would do this, ask yourself the following: Which would you rather have —
total ownership of a company that struggles to get off the ground, or majority
ownership in a company that’s really going places? We hope you answered
the latter. Remember, it takes money to make money. When you give people
equity stakes in your company, you give them the right to attend shareholder
meetings and voice their opinions, so you must choose your equity stake-
holders wisely.
Equity provides the investor/owner with four basic rights:
 The right to control the business: The person who has the majority of
the stock controls what happens to the business. That’s certainly true in
a privately held company, in which the founder controls who gets stock
and how much. In a publicly held company, by contrast, shares are
bought and sold on a stock exchange, so a group of people joining
together can hold the majority shares and control the company. That
group may or may not include the founder.
 The right to dividends: Depending on how you set up your stockholder
agreements, most shareholders in an equity situation are entitled to
dividends if and when the company declares them. Dividends are a distri-
bution of earnings to the shareholders. This is a critical point, because
most early-stage companies don’t distribute dividends. Instead, they
retain earnings to grow the company, which is a very prudent decision.
Entrepreneurs shouldn’t seek money from investors who want dividends
before the company is well-established.
 The right to vote: Assuming your investors received common stock,
they’re entitled to vote at the annual shareholders’ meeting on such
issues as the election of directors and officers and the direction of the
company. In most cases, venture capitalists (professional investors)
demand preferred stock, which gives them preference in a liquidation
over the common shareholders. Normally, preferred stock is nonvoting,
but in some instances the investor may demand voting rights with pre-
ferred stock — hey, whoever supplies the money wins!
 The right to company assets: Depending on how you write up the share-
holder agreements, some shareholders could have claims on company
assets in the event of dissolution of the company.
249
Chapter 14: It Takes Money to Make Money

Choosing between debt and equity
Many factors come into play when you’re deciding what kind of money you
need for your venture. The following sections take a look at some key factors
to consider when contemplating the choice between debt and equity.
The purpose of the funds
Why do you need the money? That question sounds simple enough, but few
business owners really know why they’re seeking capital beyond the very
basics: to start the business, to grow the business, and so on. Certain types
of capital work in some situations and not in others. For example, if you’re
seeking capital to finish research and development (R&D) on a new product
(called seed capital), you can forget getting a loan from banks, most venture
capital firms, and, frankly, most every other kind of investor outside of
friends and family. That’s because R&D is a big sinkhole. It requires a lot of
money without producing any return for a long time, if ever.
On the other hand, if you have a successful business and are looking to grow
into new markets, you probably have several funding choices. And, in today’s
global business environment, if you have a sexy Internet business with a
great business model or a high-tech venture in the energy industry, the world
of capital is yours for the asking. Well, maybe not quite that easily, but you’re
certainly in a better position than 99 percent of other business owners.
Your preferences and goals for your business
As a business owner, you no doubt want to control your destiny and certainly
that of your business. Some business owners aren’t comfortable with debt
(they’re obviously not Baby Boomers), so loans and credit lines aren’t
options. Others don’t want to share ownership with anyone — they want it
all, so equity isn’t an option.
If you fall into both categories, you have a real problem. You now have to rely
on your own resources and the internal cash flows of the company. That may
mean that you start and grow much more slowly than you would’ve other-
wise. Nothing is wrong with that approach — unless you’re in a fast-moving
industry. In that case, if you grow too slowly, you’ll probably miss the window
of opportunity and give a competitor a chance to bypass you in the market.
The important thing is that you choose the financing option that meets your
personal needs and the goals of your business.
Your investors’ preferences and goals
Although your personal preferences and goals certainly are important,
they’re by no means the only ones you have to consider. Your investors, if
you choose that route, have their own goals, which may be in conflict with
yours. Unless you find that rare investor who has a philanthropic interest in
250
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

seeing your business succeed, you’ll deal with an investor who’s in the deal
for what it will return. An investor is looking at three types of returns in
about three to five years:
 Cash-flow returns: A working investor/owner sometimes receives the
perks of ownership, such as an expense account, a company car, a
salary, and dividends.
 Stock appreciation: At some point agreeable to everyone, an investor
can sell off a portion or all of his or her interest in the company and har-
vest the capital appreciation that the business has achieved. This is a
tax-free event, up to the cost basis of the original investment. Also, if
investors have held the stock the required length of time, they’ll qualify
for capital-gains treatment on the gain, which means their tax rate will
be much lower.
 Tax benefits: In some forms of business — for example, a Subchapter S
corporation or a limited-liability company (LLC) — losses (and profits)
are passed through to the owners in proportion to their investment. So
an investor can receive pass-through losses (typical in the early years of
a business) and pay taxes on profits at the investor’s personal income
tax rate, which often is lower than the corporate rate.
Finding Second-Stage (or Expansion)
Financing
Second-stage, or second-round, financing generally is used to expand a busi-
ness into new markets or new products. To grow rapidly to the next level,
most businesses seek some form of expansion capital to cover the cost of
building up inventories, hiring more salespeople, carrying out marketing
campaigns, ramping up manufacturing, and so on, to name a few options. In
this section, we look at several ways you can raise expansion capital.
Getting an angel on your side
Yes, we want to talk about angels, but the kind of angels we’re talking about
don’t have wings and halos, although they sometimes grant wishes. In the
capital acquisition arena, an angel is a private investor and part of what’s
known as the informal risk capital market, which is the largest pool of
investor money in the United States. Because the market is quite large, find-
ing an angel doesn’t seem like it would be a problem for an entrepreneur
looking for funding. But it isn’t that easy.
251
Chapter 14: It Takes Money to Make Money

You see, angel investors aren’t listed in the phone book; frankly, they usually
prefer to keep a low profile, looking only at deals referred to them by people
they trust. So, the key to finding an angel investor is to get to know people who
know them. Professional adviser types such as attorneys, lawyers, bankers,
and accountants are possible sources. Other entrepreneurs are also good
sources because most angel investors have been entrepreneurs themselves;
that’s why they like helping other entrepreneurs by investing in their companies.
Today many angel investors band together in groups so that they can invest
in larger deals and benefit from a shared experience. They generally have
rules about how much their members must invest annually and they tend to
fill the gap between friends and family money and venture capitalists (VCs;
see the next section). One thing angels typically do that distinguishes them
from VCs is to spend a lot of time mentoring the start-ups so that they’re
ready for money. They also link companies to VCs when the time is right.
Although we can’t give you one complete description of what angels look like,
we can say from our research that they have some common characteristics:
 They’re usually educated males in their 40s and 50s.
 They typically have a net worth of more than $1 million.
 They like to invest in companies near their homes so they can enjoy
watching the companies grow.
 They seem to prefer certain types of businesses — particularly manufac-
turing, energy and resources, and service businesses. Of course, they
also compete with VCs for high-technology businesses.
 They tend to make decisions more quickly than VCs and usually stay
with ventures for longer periods of time.
You now have an image of an angel to go by, but don’t make the mistake of
thinking that all angels are alike. In fact, today you may run into angels who
have actually come looking for you, trying to entice you to accept their
money. A dream come true? Hardly; it’s a symptom of a long bull market
(rising stock market) with plenty of newly rich entrepreneurs who like the
idea of investing in up-and-coming young companies. These investors are
looking less and less like angels and more like VCs, however, because they
require more due diligence, seek a quicker return on investment time, and set
tougher screening criteria. Angels have a much larger market now that VCs
are scouting bigger deals. However, many angels still find most of their deals
through referrals, so it all comes back to the importance of networking and
becoming known within the venture community.
252
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

Taking the fast track with venture 
capitalists (at your own risk)
Perhaps you’ve heard all the “vulture capital” jokes. In the minds of many
people, venture capitalists are placed in the same category with used car
salesmen and real estate developers. Why is that? Probably because although
entrepreneurs want to build great companies, venture capitalists are in busi-
ness solely to make money and get out as quickly as possible. They also want
the following:
 A huge equity interest to compensate for the risk they’re taking
 An enormous return on investment
 A seat on your board of directors
Doesn’t sound very attractive, does it? To be fair, venture capital serves an
important purpose: It provides the funding that fast-growth companies need
to expand.
Although plenty of venture capital is out there for the taking, fewer than 1
percent of all businesses meet the very strict requirements of venture capitalists.
For high-growth ventures, however, VC money is an important source of fund-
ing, but it should be considered a second-stage source and pursued only if no
private money is available. Some businesses, particularly high-tech busi-
nesses and those with heavy asset requirements such as plant and equip-
ment, find it difficult to grow organically using internal cash flows. Growth is
expensive and to do it effectively, you need to move quickly. There are addi-
tional people to hire, systems and controls to put in place to manage growth,
and inventories to build up in anticipation of demand by customers. All these
things require large amounts of capital that most business owners don’t want
to divert from their current budgets.
That’s where VCs come in. This type of business is more attractive than a
start-up because it has achieved a certain level of success, some of the risk
has been reduced, and the business is positioned to grow. The following sec-
tions help you understand what VCs are looking for so you don’t spend time
(and money) trying to get them interested in funding your business if it’s not
the type of business they look for.
What do VCs look for?
Knowing what VCs generally look for puts you in a better negotiating posi-
tion. You’ll know what’s important to them and be able to address those
issues in a way that makes sense to them.
253
Chapter 14: It Takes Money to Make Money

Most VCs are interested in three aspects in the following order:
 A great market: Market size in the hundreds of millions of dollars is the
minimum — billions of dollars is much better (surprise!). From a fast-
growing, large market, a company can achieve high valuations that will
give the investor the greatest possible return on investment.
 A great management team: Of course, to take advantage of big markets
you need a management team that can execute the business plan. An old
adage says that VCs would rather invest in an A team with a B product
than in a B team with an A product. What that means is that people
make the difference in a company. VCs want to invest in a team that has
a successful track record.
VCs also want to see a team that’s fully committed to the company,
because a fast-growing company requires an extraordinary amount of
time and effort.
 A great technology that you can protect: Traditionally, VCs have looked
for the next great technology product — computer hardware, software,
communications, electronics, medical devices, biotech, and pharmaceu-
ticals, for instance. They would prefer that you have patents to protect
it, so your Grandmother’s brownie recipe probably won’t qualify (even if
Fairytale Brownies is a thriving Arizona-based business).
Having said that, VCs are now starting to do more of something they
rarely did in the past: They’re investing in nontechnology companies
with great, protectable business models and huge growth potential. So,
you may not get money for your new brownies, but you may be able to
create the next Wal-Mart. The reason VCs are doing this is because of
the lack of great technology deals in the market.
Where do you find VCs?
To work with venture capital firms, you need to be able to locate them. The
best way to do so is through a referral. Although many venture capital firms
are listed in the phone book, the worst thing you can do when searching for
capital is to start calling and sending out your business plan. VCs see hun-
dreds of business plans every month, so the best chance you have of getting
some attention is through a referral from someone who knows a VC and
knows you, too.
To get a referral, you need to have spent a lot of time networking in your
community so that, eventually, you can meet the people who can help you.
Attorneys, bankers, and accountants are good places to start. This type of
contact won’t happen overnight, however. You have to keep working at it.
254
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

After you find a VC whose requirements mesh with your venture’s capabili-
ties, deal with that investor alone. Don’t shop your business plan to several
VCs at once. It’s a small world, and VCs don’t want to feel as though they’re
in a bidding war for your investment opportunity. You’ll discover very
quickly whether a VC firm is interested or not; VCs aren’t shy about telling
entrepreneurs what they think of their “great” ideas.
What happens after you find a VC?
The first thing VCs may ask to look at is the executive summary for your busi-
ness plan. If they don’t find the business concept sufficiently compelling and
in-line with their criteria, they won’t waste their time reading the rest of the
business plan.
If they are interested, they may call for a meeting to check out your manage-
ment team to see whether you are what you say you are. You may be asked to
do a formal presentation at that time, and you may be asked some very
pointed questions to determine how you stand up under pressure. The first
meeting is really a getting-to-know-you meeting. Others will follow as the VCs
begin to do their very thorough due diligence — background checks on your
team and company.
If the VCs are sold on the investment, you’ll move into a period of going over
legal documents and negotiating what they want and what you want (typi-
cally what they want wins). The nature and terms of the investment will then
appear in a term sheet. When the deal is set, however, it doesn’t mean that
the check is in the mail. VCs usually manage pools of investor money, so they
have to do their own prospectus and legal documents for their investors. All
this work can take several months. So, the moral of the story is, don’t begin
the search for VC funding too late. Completing funding will take some time.
And what about private equity firms?
Today private equity firms are receiving a lot of press. What exactly are they,
and how are they different from venture capital firms? Private equity firms are
simply investment funds that traditionally have focused only on very mature,
low-risk companies seeking expansion capital. Their popularity is being
driven by the number of companies looking to go private to avoid the strin-
gent requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley (see Chapter 10). By contrast, venture
capital firms take on riskier ventures at earlier stages and exert more onerous
requirements on them. However, in recent times, the line between venture
capital firms and private equity firms has blurred a bit, mostly due to the
highly competitive state of the investor market. VC firms are now investing in
more mature ventures, and private equity firms are taking more risk by
investing earlier.

Considering a public offering
If your company is in need of second-stage cash, another way you can raise
capital is to do a public offering. A public offering is a complex version of a
private offering that’s regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). Your company agrees to sell a portion of its issued stock to the public
via a stock exchange. The first time your company does this, it’s termed an
initial public offering (IPO).
Why an IPO may be a smart move: The pros
For a growing business, nothing is more exciting or glamorous than a public
offering. It can be prestigious and very lucrative, among many other benefits:
 The public offering provides a way for founders and investors to reap
the rewards of their efforts by selling off a portion of their stock.
 It gives your business instant clout with lenders and others who may not
have given you a second look before.
 It’s a way to raise large amounts of interest-free equity capital that you
probably couldn’t raise by any other means.
 You can use stock in the company as an incentive to attract top people
to your organization.
 Because of the prestige of being a public company, it’s easier to negoti-
ate deals with suppliers, customers, and creditors and to form strategic
partnerships with other companies.
With public offerings, market timing is everything. IPOs are subject to seasonality,
which means that sometimes markets are favorable to them and sometimes
they’re not. Timing for the business is important, too. One rule says to consider
an IPO when your company’s need for growth capital exceeds its debt capacity.
In any case, your company should require at least $50 to $100 million to make it
worthwhile and preferable to going with venture capital money (see the previous
section).
Some companies that have found the U.S. IPO market hard to break into have
done their IPOs in Europe or Asia, where the rules are less onerous. For
example, Japanese investors seem to prefer small valuations of $10 to $60
million, because they like to get into an investment at an early stage to
increase the potential of reaping greater returns.
Why an IPO isn’t always a good idea: The cons
Before you decide to jump on the bandwagon and join the throngs of busi-
nesses queuing up to do an IPO, take a serious look at some of the disadvan-
tages of being a public company; then decide if you still want to do it:
256
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

 Statistics make the picture very clear: In the 1980s, 3,186 firms went
public. Today, only 58 percent of them are still listed on one of the three
major stock exchanges. To add insult to injury, only about a third of the
firms have stock selling above the issuing price.
 The year 2001 saw an unprecedented 3.8 percent of all publicly traded
stocks dropped from the major stock exchanges. So much for prestige!
 Going public is a very expensive process — often costing more than
$300,000. That figure doesn’t include the commission to the underwriter,
either — the investment bank that sells the securities. This commission
can run from 7 to 10 percent.
 Going public is a time-consuming process that can take from six months
to a year to complete. Just learning about the process and what’s
required of you takes a lot of time.
And you need to prepare far in advance of the actual IPO process,
because it will take time to get your business in shape financially. For
one thing, you need to put a team together that will help the company
through the process. You also need at least three years of audited finan-
cial statements — hence the importance of knowing that you eventually
want to do an IPO long before you actually do it.
 When your company becomes a public company, everything you do
becomes public knowledge, including all your financials. Consequently,
you’re subject to scrutiny by the government and the public in general.
 A public company is responsible first to its shareholders and second to
its customers, employees, and any other stakeholders. The board of
directors and the shareholders now control your destiny.
A public company, therefore, faces intense pressure to perform quickly.
Shareholders tend to focus on short-term goals that produce high earn-
ings and higher stock prices, even if those goals threaten long-term per-
formance.
 The reporting requirements to the SEC necessitate the hiring of a full-
time person to manage everything, which is costly and time consuming.
Public companies are subject to Sarbanes-Oxley (see Chapter 10).
What happens during an IPO
Making decision to hold an IPO is just the first step. Here’s what happens
during an IPO:
1. After you definitely decide to go for an IPO, you must locate an under-
writer or investment banker to sell your securities and manage the
IPO process.
This step isn’t as easy as you may think. The more prestigious firms are
very picky about whom they represent, so you probably need to get to
them via referrals.
257
Chapter 14: It Takes Money to Make Money

Always check out any underwriter that you’re considering using. Make
sure that the underwriter has a good track record of successfully com-
pleting an IPO. Not all IPOs succeed. If the night before the offering the
underwriter can’t get the estimated “going out” price or close to it, or
you’re not oversubscribed (oversubscribed is having more buyers than
you need), you may decide to cancel the IPO. You’ll still have to pay the
bills, however. If you do go forward, find a good investment bank that
can guide you through the process and afterward offer you financial
advice, assist you in buying and selling stock, and help you maintain the
interest of the public in purchasing its stock.
2. When you find a qualified underwriter, he or she will draw up a letter
of intent.
The letter specifies a price range for the stock and the terms and conditions
of the arrangement between your company and the investment bank.
3. You file a registration statement with the SEC.
This statement is known in the business as a red herring, which is actu-
ally just another term for a prospectus. The prospectus is given to
anyone interested in investing in the IPO — typically institutional-type
investors such as pension funds and insurance companies.
4. After you file the registration statement, you publish the advertise-
ment for the IPO in the financial press.
This advertisement is called a tombstone, and no, it isn’t meant to be a
bad omen.
5. You determine on which stock exchange your company belongs.
The most difficult exchange to qualify for is the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE), so most small companies go to the American Stock
Exchange (AMEX) or the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation (NASDAQ). You can also choose to go public on
one of the many foreign exchanges.
6. You and your team take a tour of all the major institutional investors.
This road show is the best part of the IPO process (next to the party to
celebrate a successful IPO). The goal is to get all the investors on board
so that when all the SEC requirements have been met, the offering can
virtually be sold in a day.
Don’t head to the bank yet, though, because the stock value achieved at the
IPO may not be sustainable. This situation sometimes happens because you
find that there’s no real market for the stock; you know this because no one is
buying and selling your stock after the opening day. Consequently, the value
of the shares could decline to zero (it has happened). This decline means
that if, for example, your shares in the company were valued at $300,000 on
opening day, a week later they may be worth nothing. This example is a very
real possibility.
258
Part III: Money: What You Don’t Know Will Hurt You 

So, don’t let all the news reports of skyrocketing valuations lead you to
believe that your company will perform in the same way. Recall what hap-
pened to Vonage, the voiceover-IP company, which debuted on the New York
Stock Exchange on May 24, 2006. Within the first seven days after its IPO, the
stock lost about 30 percent of its value. Needless to say, shareholders weren’t
happy and filed a class-action lawsuit against the company.
One other important point: Just because you have stock listed on an
exchange doesn’t mean that you have a liquid asset. The SEC has some very
stringent rules about when and how much stock officers, directors, and insid-
ers can sell. Don’t plan on an immediate personal cash gain.
We’re not trying to warn you away from a public offering. For some companies,
an IPO is the best way to raise large amounts of capital and compete on an
equal footing in their industries. Just make sure that you consider carefully all
the ramifications of going public before making the decision to do it.
Forming a Strategic Partnership 
to Access Growth Capital
You can use methods other than debt and equity to raise capital or find the
resources necessary to grow your business. Very simply put, a strategic
alliance is a partnership between two or more businesses, as well as an excel-
lent way to share core competencies and reduce the costs of research and
development, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution. Strategic partners
invest time, money, and expertise in your company; they’re really more like
stakeholders. Strategic partnerships have helped many companies grow with-
out having to raise costly outside capital and without giving up any equity.
Strategic partnerships are particularly important to companies that do busi-
ness in the global market (see Chapter 4). Often, you can’t even do business
in a country without having a partner in that country that knows how to
handle business there.
Alliances also are critical to small companies looking to compete in a big
market. ScanEagle, for instance, is an unmanned robotic surveillance plane
developed by an entrepreneurial company, the Insitu Group, based in Bingen,
Washington. After about 60 meetings with aerospace giant Boeing, the
company finally signed a partnership agreement that made ScanEagle a vital
player in the Iraq war — something it could’ve never achieved on its own.
259
Chapter 14: It Takes Money to Make Money

To be successful, a strategic alliance should be a win-win situation for both
companies. To make sure that you create an effective partnership, heed the
following advice:
 Find a partner that’s financially healthy with or without your company.
 Find a partner whose business practices are compatible with yours, and
whose customers and value chain members are satisfied with their
relationships with the company.
 Find a partner that has experience in strategic alliances. Just as with a
sophisticated investor, an experienced partner understands the risks
and knows how to make the partnership work.
 If possible, find a company that has excess capacity so that it doesn’t
have to expend extra capital in plant and equipment to partner with you.

usinesspeople often become so focused on brainstorming and producing
the best products, setting up employee incentive programs, paying bills,
and finding new ways to market their businesses that they forget about the
very reason they run a business in the first place: the customer. The customer
is the beginning, middle, and end of a business. Yet, too many CEOs assume
that they know what customers want, how they want it, and when they want it.
They never even bother to ask! They think that they’re providing customer ser-
vice, but what is customer service if you don’t know what the customer wants?
Here’s a quiz to start this chapter. Answer the following questions as honestly
as you can without spending any time on them:
 Who’s the most important person in your business?
 Who pays your employees?
 Who designs your products and services?
 Who determines when it’s time to grow your company to the next level?
If you haven’t guessed by now, the answer to each question should be the cus-
tomer. In this chapter, you find out why this is so. We cover everything from
target markets to market research to customer needs. You also discover some
new trends that are turning the marketing world on its head, and you find out
how to prepare an effective marketing plan that will create awareness for your
products and services and build long-term relationships with your customers.

Identifying Your Customers 
and Their Needs
You can’t sell a product or deliver a service if you don’t know who your cus-
tomer is. Simply put, your customer is the individual or business who pays
you, but it’s more than that. Your customer is the segment of a market that
needs your product or service most because it solves a real problem he or
she is having. Makes sense because if a customer needs what you have, the
sale will be easy. There is no secret to understanding your customers’ needs.
All you have to do is ask. What a concept! Yet, interacting with customers is
something many businesses do very badly, if they do it at all. Why is that? 
We can point to two fundamental reasons:
 Owners assume that because they started the business, they must know
what their customers want. Wrong!
 They assume that if they’re getting their products or services out on
time and with good quality, they’ve done all they need to do to satisfy
customers. Wrong again!
Today, just keeping your customers satisfied isn’t enough. You have to build
long-term relationships with them. Why? Because the world has changed.
Today’s customers are jaded; they’re bombarded with an endless variety of
products and services — so many, in fact, that they end up frustrated and
ultimately choose based on the best price. Couple that with the power that
Internet search engines have given to customers by enabling them to com-
pare products online and find the best price anywhere in the world, and you
have a challenging situation for businesses trying to stand out from the
crowd. Even if you do manage to stand out with your product, a competitor
that can sell your product more cheaply may win the customer.
Competing on price alone, however, is a no-win situation for everyone. Your
best bet is to show your customers that your company offers intangible bene-
fits that make it a better choice than the competitors. To do so, you need to
understand who your customer is and what his or her needs are. This section
can help you get started.
The customer is the person who pays you
You can’t meet a customer’s needs if you don’t know who the customer is. If
you agree that the customer is the person (or business) who pays you — the
one who controls the purchasing decision — defining who your customer is
will be easier. Suppose that you own a restaurant. Your customers, naturally,
are the people who come to your restaurant because you’re delivering your
264
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

food products directly to them and they’re paying you. That’s a simple exam-
ple. Now try this one: You manufacture bicycles geared toward racers and
sell them through retail outlets. Who’s your customer? Your first guess may
be that the customer is the retail outlet, because it buys the bicycles from
you to sell to its customers, the racers. And in some instances, you’d be right
if you, the manufacturer, sold direct to the retailer. The more likely scenario,
however, is that you sell to a distributor, which then locates retail outlets for
the bicycles. In that case, your customer is the distributor, because the dis-
tributor pays you and the retailer pays the distributor. What about the con-
sumer who uses the bike? Where does he or she fit in? The actual user of the
bike is the customer of — you guessed it — the retailer.
Now, consider a less obvious example. Suppose, like Charles A. Cocotas, you
own a hotel for dogs called Best Friends Pet Resorts and Salons, headquar-
tered in Norwalk, Connecticut. Who is your customer? The last time we
checked, dogs hadn’t yet learned how to deal with money, so we know the
dog doesn’t pay you. Chances are, the dog’s owner pays the bill. So, although
the dogs benefit from Cocotas’s services, the owners pay for the services, so
the owners are the customers. What does that make the dog? The dog is what
we refer to as the end user. In the previous example, the bicycle racer is the
end user for the manufacturer and the customer of the retailer.
Why is it so important to distinguish between the two? You can’t meet a cus-
tomer’s needs if you don’t know who the customer is.
Customers want benefits, not products
We’re amazed at how many companies take the “Field of Dreams” approach
to the products and services they offer: They figure that if they build it, the
customers will come. Nothing could be further from the truth. Customers
are very smart people. They know exactly what they want, when they want
it, and how they want it. And the main things they want are benefits. For
instance, Bev and Chris Sanders, founders of Avalanche Snowboards, Inc —
a manufacturer of snowboards and related equipment in Lake Tahoe,
California — are constantly on the alert for new benefits that they can pro-
vide their customers. As they ride the chairlifts, they write down unusual
jumps and tricks they see that may inspire new designs. In other words, their
designs come directly from what their customers do, so the benefit to the
customers is the freedom to try new things.
Assuming that customers buy based on the features of your product or
service — the bells and whistles — is a mistake. Customers are more interested
in what the product or service can do for them — they want to know “what’s in
it for me?” Consider this example: Suppose that you have an Internet-based
travel company that offers adventure tours to exotic places. Some of the
many features of your product/service may include the following:
265
Chapter 15: You Are Nothing without a Customer

 Your company puts the whole trip together so that all the customer has
to do is show up.
 Your company provides a wealth of information about the exotic location.
 Your company supplies an on-location tour guide.
These features are all well and good, but they don’t address the needs of the
customer in the form of benefits that let customers know why they should do
business with you. Before presenting your travel product/service to the public,
try taking each of the features in the preceding list and turning them into benefits
for your customers:
 Customers save time and money by going to one place for all their travel
needs.
 Customers save time when looking up location information and have
access to more information about their destinations.
 Customers experience a sense of security, knowing that a representative
of your company will be onsite to take care of any last-minute needs.
As you can see, you’re now looking at the features from the customer’s per-
spective. The customer must be aware of these benefits before making a pur-
chasing decision. Think as a customer and your chances of making a sale go
up substantially.
Eyeing Key Trends in Marketing
Just as with nearly every aspect of business, marketing has felt the significant
impact of the Internet. In fact, traditional media boundaries are eroding as
Internet marketing becomes more and more popular. Even seasoned mar-
keters may be surprised that Internet advertising is predicted to be a $26 bil-
lion market by 2009. With the Internet passing the one-billion user mark (15
percent being U.S. users), online information sources have leapfrogged offline
information sources, and today, approximately 37 percent of marketers’ bud-
gets is devoted to Internet marketing.
Today, information and advertising spring from a variety of different sources,
and customers are becoming overwhelmed by all the available choices. In
this section, we look at three important trends that are redefining marketing.
Grabbing the long tail
Not that long ago, marketing experts were talking about the importance of
moving away from mass marketing toward the concept of mass customiza-
tion, which was based on one-to-one relationship marketing — providing a
266
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

customized product or service to each customer, in other words. Well, guess
what? The experts are back to touting mass marketing, only this time it’s
new-media-style mass marketing (for more on new media, head to Chapter 2).
Because companies can now reach millions of potential customers very inex-
pensively over the Internet, you can see the emerging phenomenon that has
been called the long tail by Chris Anderson in his best-selling book by the
same name.
Long tail refers to a probabilistic statistical function — in simple terms, the
likelihood that an event will happen. What Anderson says is that today com-
panies can serve many very small niche markets by using the Internet; these
niches, when aggregated, represent a significant portion of total sales for
some types of items (see Figure 15-1 for a representation).
In Figure 15-1, the graph might represent CD sales, book sales, or pretty much
any product that’s normally sold through brick-and-mortar retail outlets. In
the graph, you see the number of unit sales on the vertical axis (Y-axis) and
the ranking of those sales from most popular item (ranked #1) to least popu-
lar item on the horizontal axis (X-axis). Stores typically stock only the top-
selling titles or brands of products because these items move fast, so the
stores make more money (makes sense!). However, in the online world, retail
shelf space doesn’t matter, because there are no shelves to worry about!
So, a company such as Amazon.com or Best Buy can potentially carry mil-
lions of titles and cater to each customer’s most narrow interests, because
such a company can access anything it needs to sell from an endless variety
of sources worldwide. For example, if you want to buy a 1935 novel that your
grandmother recommended, you can probably find it online.

Chapter 15: You Are Nothing without a Customer

What’s the impact of the long-tail phenomenon? Consumers are spending
more time online across a greater number of sites — called user fragmenta-
tion. Their attention span on any one site is lower, so the bar is raised very
high to grab their attention. Relevance has become the mantra of online mar-
keters. Amazon.com has found that one quarter of its entire book sales come
from books that don’t crack the top 100,000 titles, and that proportion is
growing by leaps and bounds. This is niche marketing on steroids, and it’s
the future of marketing.
Understanding media convergence
One of the key trends that explains why marketing is undergoing a revolution
is media convergence. Today, most companies and consumers have access to
video and content production technology at affordable prices, so what used
to be barriers to content creation are now open doors. Anyone with a com-
puter, a video camera, and the right software can produce a broadcast-quality
commercial or magazine-quality advertisement and distribute the content
over the Internet to a target audience. In this very flat world, Google, for
example, sells advertising space, Starbucks sells music, and AT&T is develop-
ing television programs. What this means to you is that opportunities that
never existed before are now available for the taking.
A company should understand that media convergence is both an opportu-
nity and a challenge. If everyone has access to the same information and
technologies and, therefore, can reach the same target markets easily, creat-
ing a competitive advantage becomes very difficult. And customers, frankly,
are tired of being parsed into little pieces based on who they are and how
they behave. So, you need to think creatively about how to take advantage of
the new marketing environment while also coordinating, connecting, and
reinforcing what you do inside the company with what you do in the market-
place. In other words, take advantage of this media convergence, but make
sure that it doesn’t distract you from your core business capabilities, which
include serving your customers. Some companies have chosen to hire firms
that have developed an expertise in new media to do the work for them.
Customers doing their own 
marketing — oh my!
Nearly everyone today (well, almost everyone) seems to be seeking their 15
minutes of fame. With social-media Web sites such as MySpace, Facebook,
and YouTube, anyone with a bit of creativity can become an instant celebrity
on the Internet or push a product or business into the limelight. What this
means to business owners is that in many cases they may not need to hire
expensive marketing firms to handle their marketing to customers if those
customers frequent these social networking sites.
268
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

Social media tools you see on media sites have taken the concept of viral
marketing to a new level. Viral marketing is a marketing technique that takes
advantage of referrals through social networks to spread a marketing mes-
sage much as a viral disease spreads from person to person. Some examples
of social networking tools that facilitate viral marketing include
 Blogs
 Podcasts
 Vodcasts (video podcasts)
 RSS Readers (pushes what others are saying about you in the news,
blogs, or podcasts to you — this can be good and bad!)
 Wikis (Web sites that let users create and edit content on any topic)
For example, an enterprising college student decided that the world needed
to understand physics, so he posted a video on YouTube called “Physics Guy
Rap,” where he cleverly delivered a lecture about physics to a class while
rapping to a hip-hop beat. The video quickly racked up more than 120,000
views the first day it played, through viral networking. After one networking
site got wind of the video, the news spread like a virus all over the Internet,
eventually spreading into more traditional media outlets.
Your company can take advantage of many ways to do viral marketing with
new media. Here are three tips:
 Give something away free. “Free” is the most powerful word in any lan-
guage. Advertising free products is a great way to get “eyeballs” on 
your site.
 Make it very easy for people to pass on a message you want seen. For
example, you can enable users to simply click a button to forward the
message by e-mail.
 Use existing social networking sites such as MySpace, YouTube, and
Facebook to reach people who are used to sharing information with
their personal networks. This advertising will dramatically accelerate
the circulation of your message.
Creating a Marketing Plan
A marketing plan is really just one part of your overall business plan. A mar-
keting plan is a living guide to your goals for starting and building a loyal and
sustainable customer base. It contains your marketing goals and the strate-
gies and tactics you’ll use to achieve them. But don’t think that you can write
one marketing plan that will be good for the life of your business (or even for
a year for that matter). Rather, an effective marketing plan should evolve with
269
Chapter 15: You Are Nothing without a Customer

your business, your customers, and the market. This section helps you
create the right marketing plan for your company.
Prepare to do the plan
Before you sit down to outline your marketing plan, do some preparation to
make your job easier. First of all, it’s very important that you include all the
members of your management team, as well as key front-line employees, in
the planning process — people from marketing, finance, manufacturing, and
distribution. The more input you get from all the functional areas of your
business, the more successful your plan will be. And don’t forget to include
the customer in your planning! Ask some of your best customers to give you
feedback by inviting them to participate in the planning process. Let them
know that what they have to say is important.
A kick-off meeting is probably a good place to start. At the meeting, you can
share ideas and assign duties that individuals or teams can undertake on
their own. But be sure to regularly meet as a large group to make sure that
everyone is on target. Here are some tips for getting started:
 Brainstorm a list of possible marketing strategies and tactics. This list
can help you see all the possibilities before you narrow down the choices.
You need to have a good understanding of which previous strategies have
been successful and which ones have not. You can gain that understand-
ing by looking at other companies in the industry. Find this information in
popular business magazines such as Inc. and Fast Company. Hit some of
the major business-resource sites on the Internet.
Your goal is to collect as many strategies and tactics as you can. At this
point, don’t worry about whether they’re feasible for your company; you
really want to make sure you haven’t missed a great strategy or tactic.
You can judge feasibility after your list is complete.
 Try to think like a customer. Look at your company, its products and
services, and its employees from the customer’s perspective. In other
words, step outside of yourself for a bit and look objectively at your
business and what it offers.
 Know your competition as well as you know your own company. Look
at what your competitors are doing right and what they’re not doing that
maybe you should be doing. Can you think of ways to improve on what
your competitors are doing?
 Begin analyzing your options and ranking them. Start by eliminating
quickly those options that aren’t possible for your company at this time.
Perhaps they cost more than you have in your budget, or maybe they
just aren’t appropriate for your customers. For example, if your cus-
tomers aren’t regular television watchers, you probably don’t want to
waste money advertising on that medium.

After you’ve followed these tips, you can begin to write your marketing plan.
Create a plan in one paragraph
Your marketing plan can be as elaborate as a complete 50-page business plan
or as spartan as a one-paragraph plan. In fact, starting with one paragraph
that says it all isn’t a bad idea. Many very experienced marketers suggest
using this approach because it forces you to keep your plan focused and to
identify the key components. A good one-paragraph marketing plan has the
following seven components:
 Purpose: What’s the marketing plan supposed to accomplish?
 Benefits: How will your products and services satisfy the needs of your
customers?
 Customer: Who is your primary customer and what’s your strategy for
building long-term relationships with that customer?
 Company: How will the customer see your company? Remember, cus-
tomers are some of the many people who will contribute to positioning
your company in the marketplace.
 Niche: What’s the niche in the market that your company has defined
and will serve?
 Tactics: What specific marketing tools will you use to reach customers?
 Budget: How much of your budget will you allocate to marketing efforts?
Here’s an example of how all this information goes into a paragraph that
gives readers the essential points of a marketing plan:
The purpose of the marketing plan is to create awareness for ABC Strategies
LLC, which will provide state-of-the-art management consulting services to
technology companies through direct contact with the customer and via the
Internet. The niche that ABC will serve is the small, growing technology com-
pany. The customer will see ABC Strategies as a high-quality management
consulting firm that provides the latest proven strategies and tactics for man-
aging in a time of rapid change. Initial marketing tactics will include half-
day workshops and advertisements in technology publications. Ten percent
of sales will be applied to the marketing strategy.
Defining Your Target Market
You’ve probably heard the term “target market” before. Target market repre-
sents the segment of the marketplace whose needs your product or service
271
Chapter 15: You Are Nothing without a Customer

will satisfy. To put it another way, the target market consists of the customers
who are most likely to purchase your product or use your service.
It’s important to target a specific market rather than try to hit the whole
market at once. Why is this? The answer is simple. Marketing to customers 
is a very costly undertaking for any business, so you want to be sure that 
you reach the customers who will actually buy from you. And who are those
first customers? The ones in the most pain, because they have the problem
that you’re solving. They’re the ones who will have their credit cards out
when your product or service hits the market. This section helps you 
identify and serve your target market.
Hopefully you have more than one 
customer: Target the first customer!
In your search for your target or customers, you’ll encounter many types of
potential customers, so it won’t always be obvious which group you should
target first. One quick and easy way to help segment all your potential cus-
tomers is to create a customer matrix. A customer matrix is a table that 
compares all the categories of customers you identify across several character-
istics or variables. The typical characteristics used to compare customers are
 The benefits that a particular customer seeks from your products and
services.
 The distribution channel you can use to deliver those benefits.
 The marketing strategy that’s appropriate for that customer.
Of course, you can add any other type of comparison category you want.
These three categories, however, will get you started. Table 15-1 depicts an
example of a customer matrix.

Notice that each customer requires different benefits from the company. What
this really tells you is that you define customer categories by the benefits to
the customer. So, for example, the needs of a rapidly growing company are
greater and more frequent in terms of management strategies than the needs
of either the start-up venture or the established company. Chances are, you
won’t reach all your customers through the same distribution channels either.
In Table 15-1, start-up ventures with limited resources are most easily served
via the Internet. Likewise, it follows that if you’re reaching different customers
through different distribution channels, you’ll probably also use different mar-
keting strategies and tactics to create awareness and motivate them to buy.
After you pinpoint your potential target customer, it’s time to create a cus-
tomer profile — an in-depth description of the customer. Market research 
can help you find out more about that customer and the size of the market
for that customer. The next section gives you some suggestions for how to
research your target customer.
Do some research on the target customer
Before you do your market research to learn about your target customer,
and possibly reinvent the wheel, it’s a good idea to find out what others
have said about your customer. Companies such as Mediamark Research,
Inc. (www.mediamark.com) and the Simmons Market Research Bureau
(www.symmetrical.com) study demographic and psychographic (person-
ality, tendencies, buying habits) characteristics of different market segments.
They conduct random samples of the population in an effort to provide com-
panies similar to yours the data they need to make informed decisions. You
can access the results of their research for a fee, but the best information on
potential customers comes from the research you do with the customer.
There are four broad ways to segment a market, which we outline in the fol-
lowing list. These methods are guides for you; don’t forget that the best way
to understand and define your customers is to get out there and talk to them:
273
Chapter 15: You Are Nothing without a Customer

 Demographics: Demographics are the most common type of segmenta-
tion. Good market research firms can tell you, down to the precise neigh-
borhood, what people buy, when they buy, how much they buy, and how
much they earn. These firms also can give you information on standard
characteristics such as sex, age, disposable income, ethnicity, and so
forth.
 The benefits of the product/service: Market research can tell you which
types of customers are seeking convenience, wanting to save time, or
looking for superior quality and are willing to pay a premium for it. If
such a benefit is what you’re selling with your products and services,
you want to know about these customers because they’re your most
likely purchasers.
 Location of your customers: Customers in various parts of the world have
different purchasing habits and different needs. Naturally, then, the loca-
tion of customers will affect your distribution and marketing strategies,
and probably even the design of your product.
 Psychographics: When you look at the personality traits, lifestyles, and
behavioral patterns of customers, you’re looking at psychographics.
Psychographics are very important in deciding which types of marketing
tactics will catch your customers’ attention.
If you describe your customer by using the four segmenting variables we dis-
cuss in this section, you’ll have a better picture of whom you’re dealing with.
Market Research Made Easy and Fun
Market research is about gathering information about potential customers and
market segments that can help you understand your customers and their
needs. Market research is a lot like doing your taxes. You dread doing them,
put them off to the last minute, and then revel in what you learn about your
finances as a result of doing them. If you can discipline yourself to do market
research, it can reward you with customer intelligence that will get that rev-
enue stream flowing.
In the early stages of market research, your target market description will be
quite broad and based on samples of the population done by others. But as
you get out in the market and talk to your potential customers, your definition
of the target market may actually change, and you may find that your potential
customer is really someone quite different from what you originally thought.
Another important reason to do some of your own market research is that
you know best what types of information you need for your business. In fact,
defining the kind of information you require is actually the first step in doing
effective market research. This section explains what information you need
to gather and how to find it.
274
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

What information do you need?
Smart market researchers always identify the information they need before
they go out to talk to customers. Think of how frustrating it would be to have
finished a bunch of customer interviews only to discover that you forgot to
ask a very important question.
Here’s a list of the kinds of information that most businesses need. Of course,
you should modify it to suit your specific needs:
 What do your potential customers typically buy?
 How do they hear about products and services?
 How do they like to buy your particular type of product or service?
 How often do they buy?
 How can your company best meet their needs?
Also, make sure that you collect data that gives you a sense of trends in the
market and the level of demand for the product or service you’re offering.
How do you find that information?
Primary data is all the information you personally (or as a team) collect about
your potential customers. Basically, you get primary data by observing or
talking to customers, suppliers, distributors, and anyone else who can help
you better understand your customer and the market. There are a number
ways to collect this data and here we look at some of the most common. The
method you choose depends on the type of business you have.
You can gather this primary data in many ways, some more effective than
others and some more expensive than others. We cover some of the more
common data-collection methods in the sections that follow.
Interviews
You can conduct interviews by phone (sounds like a phone survey to us, how-
ever) or in person. We favor in-person interviews because you get not only
verbal feedback, but also nonverbal feedback. The way a person physically
responds to your questions can tell you a lot about whether he is being honest.
Interviews are more costly and time-consuming than mail, online, or phone
surveys, but they have the highest response rate (nearly 100 percent, if con-
ducted effectively) and provide the best chance of getting accurate responses.
In an interview situation, you have the ability to clarify responses, carry on a
discussion so that the respondent can elaborate when necessary, and ask
open-ended questions. This is a huge benefit, because open-ended questions
275
Chapter 15: You Are Nothing without a Customer

provide far more information than yes-no or categorical questions, which 
ask people to choose from several items. You can use a designed question-
naire for interviews to ensure that you consistently ask the same questions 
of every interviewee, if that is important to you.
Getting people to participate in interviews is a matter of effectively cold-calling
potential participants. It’s likely that you contact people who have been rec-
ommended to you as potential customers. This is fine as long as these inter-
viewees are truly representative of your target customer. Where you find
interview candidates depends on the type of business you have and the type
of customer you’re targeting. For example, if consumers of music are your
target, you can find potential interviewees at shopping malls and outside
music stores such as Guitar Center.
Focus groups
Focus groups are like group therapy — you can reach several customers at
once to gain insight into their needs or to test an idea on them. Focus groups
are great ways to introduce new products and services and to find out the
characteristics of the actual customers who will buy. You gather groups of six
to ten customers and often enlist the aid of a group facilitator trained to con-
duct focus groups. You may even want to videotape the sessions so that you
can review them more carefully later.
Suppose, for example, that you’re introducing a new type of herbal tea to the
market. You may choose to do a blind test in which you serve the participants
several unmarked drinks, one of which is your new herbal tea. You then ask
the participants to rate the drinks and discuss what they liked and didn’t like
about the products.
Mail and online questionnaires/surveys
If you’ve bought a new vehicle recently, you’ve probably received at least one
questionnaire from a manufacturer and/or dealer asking you how you bought
the vehicle and what you like or don’t like about it. The good thing about these
mail (and online) surveys is that a company can reach a lot of people relatively
easily and quickly. This technique, however, does have a couple problems:
 The response rate from a targeted audience, even with follow-ups, is
small — maybe 15 percent at best.
 You don’t have any interaction with the respondent, so the informa-
tion you get is pretty basic and not nearly as helpful as methods that
enable you to see nonverbal communication and clarify responses.
In terms of valuable information gained, we rank mail surveys toward the
bottom of the list of tools for customer data-gathering. Because people
receive so much junk in the mail, your survey likely will get lost in the clutter.
276
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

Mail surveys are quickly being replaced by online surveys, facilitated by com-
panies such as Survey Monkey (www.surveymonkey.com) and Zoomerang
(info.zoomerang.com). The advantage of putting a survey on the Internet
is that it’s easy and quick for potential customers to respond, but — and this
is important — you’ll reach only the customers who are comfortable using
the Internet. If your target customer is senior citizens or companies, the
Internet method may not be the most effective route. Online surveys have an
average response rate of around 26 percent, but you should expect a return
of somewhere between 10 and 15 percent — similar to questionnaires sent by
snail mail.
For any type of survey, though, you need to develop a questionnaire. Many
people mistakenly believe that developing a questionnaire is a pretty simple
task, but they couldn’t be more wrong — the process is actually both an art
and a science. Nevertheless, if you use proven methods for questionnaire
design, you enhance the chances that you’ll get more accurate responses and
lessen the likelihood of biasing the outcomes.
Here are a few hints to improve the quality of your questionnaires:
 Keep the questionnaire as short and as easy as possible, and leave
plenty of white space so that it isn’t intimidating.
 Start with the easiest questions and lead up to more complex questions.
 Ask demographic questions (age, income, and so on) last, when you’re
about to lose the attention of the respondent.
 For online questionnaires, follow this advice:
• Send a personalized invitation to participate in the survey.
• Launch the survey in the morning.
• Collect data for at least two weeks.
• Send out reminder e-mails.
If you don’t want to tackle a questionnaire by yourself, you may want to con-
tact your local college or university to find an expert in constructing success-
ful questionnaires.
Most people tend to increase their income by one category and decrease their
age by one category, so take those fibs into account when looking at responses.
Phone surveys
We rate phone surveys below mail surveys in terms of popularity with respon-
dents. Essentially, a phone survey is taking the questionnaire you’d normally
mail or put online and asking those same questions over the phone. Think
about how you feel when a telemarketer interrupts your dinner (the most
277
Chapter 15: You Are Nothing without a Customer

popular time of day to call) and wants just a couple minutes of your time. Of
course, that estimate always turns into at least 10 or 15 minutes, and by then
your dinner is cold and you wouldn’t buy from that company if it paid you to!
Clinical studies
Undertaking a clinical study probably is the most expensive route to customer
data-gathering. Consequently, they’re more popular among very large compa-
nies that deal in consumer products. Such a company may, for example, pro-
vide a test center similar to a grocery store. Potential customers receive money
and are asked to go to the test store and make choices. Usually, a number of
new products, including the one being tested, are available. Through observa-
tion and feedback from the test customers, the company can discover the
potential the new product may have in the market.
Mix and match
No rule says that you can’t combine some of the preceding methods in this
section to achieve a level of information that satisfies you. Many times,
researchers start with a mail or online survey. From the pool of survey
respondents, they select those that match the criteria the company has
developed and do interviews with them. Researchers may then group the
interviewees into focus groups for further study.
How do you figure out 
how much you’ll sell?
The toughest question facing any company introducing a new product or 
service to the market is, “How do we figure out how much we’ll sell?”
Unfortunately, there is no totally accurate way to get the answer. You have to
triangulate (come at it from three different directions) to get to a number that
seems to make sense. Trust us. No one gets it right all the time. The following
list presents some tips to help you get as close as possible to the real demand
for your product or service:
 Look at substitute products. If your product or service isn’t unique or
one of a kind (and most aren’t), you may be able to find a similar exist-
ing product, study its demand patterns, and extrapolate that information
to your own situation. Be sure when choosing a substitute product or
service that you choose one that uses your distribution channel (see
Chapter 18). The number of intermediaries a product goes through to
reach the customer affects the final price.
 Talk to industry experts. The people who deal with your type of prod-
uct or service every day have a good handle on demand, so talk to dis-
tributors, retailers, suppliers — anyone that deals with your category of
products or services.
278
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

 Do a test market. Many companies — particularly those dealing in con-
sumer products — do test markets in cities where the population is gen-
erally representative of the United States at large (Denver, for example).
Manufacturing a limited production run and employing limited advertis-
ing enables you to see whether the product catches on before you incur
the huge cost of large-scale production and advertising.
When you add your own experience and understanding of the customer and
the market to this list, you’ve probably done the best you can to predict
demand.
You Can’t Be an MBA without 
Knowing the Five Ps
Okay. We know that marketing texts refer to the “four P’s of marketing” (prod-
uct, price, place, and promotion). But it has always seemed a little odd to us
that the four Ps never include the most important P of all — people. Namely
the customer! If you don’t understand the customer, all the rest is just a
waste of time. The customer determines the price, how you deliver the prod-
uct, what the product looks like, and how you promote it. That sounds pretty
important to us. Because we spend a good bit of this chapter on the fifth P —
people — this section looks at the other four Ps.
Products include features and benefits
Your product or service is really a bundle of features and benefits in the eyes
of the customer. Recall that features include such things as quality, service,
warranties, options, characteristics, and so forth. Benefits are the intangible
aspects — in other words, what’s in it for the customer?
If you take our advice and include customer input when designing your prod-
uct or service, you’ll have a big jump on the product side of marketing. The
fact that customers design your products and services is, in and of itself, a
strong marketing message about your company. The following sections help
you position your company, price your product or service, effectively locate
your company and product/service, and promote your offering to customers.
Don’t forget positioning
You need to position not only your product or service, but also your com-
pany. One helpful tactic is to write a positioning statement that explains how
customers see your company relative to your competitors. Here’s an example
of a good positioning statement:
279
Chapter 15: You Are Nothing without a Customer

The customer will see ABC Strategies as a high-quality, state-of-the-art man-
agement consulting firm providing the latest proven strategies and tactics for
managing in a time of change.
After you’ve written your statement, test it on your customers to make sure
that this is really how they view your company. If you find that you’re off
base, go back and revise your positioning statement and test it on your cus-
tomers again. You want to make sure that the image you present in all your
advertising and promotion reflects what customers expect to see.
Packaging and labeling make a difference
Maybe you never thought of packaging and labeling as part of your marketing
strategy, but the way you package your products says a lot about your com-
pany — particularly if you’re selling consumer products. Packaging should
reflect the culture of your company, the nature of the product you’re selling,
and the channel through which you’re selling it.
You’ve probably seen the unique and whimsical black-and-white, spotted
boxes of Gateway computers, inspired by Holstein cows — you can’t miss
them. This packaging concept is no accident. And you have, no doubt,
noticed the similarity between software packaging and books on the shelf.
Packaging for consumer products needs to grab the attention of the potential
buyer — quickly. In an attractive way, the packaging also should give buyers
the information they need to make a purchasing decision. Note: Of course,
industrial products generally are packaged for utility rather than beauty or
promotional value. Their boxes simply identify the contents and the manufac-
turer and are designed to make them easy to transport.
When you market on a global basis, packaging takes on a whole new meaning,
because what’s acceptable in one country may not be in another (see
Chapter 4). For example, in Japan, you won’t be able to sell your product
unless the packaging is attractive to the Japanese people’s discriminating
taste for artistic design. Therefore, just like your positioning statement, you
need to test the response to your packaging before spending a lot of money
on a design that customers won’t like.
Pricing requires many considerations
No matter what else you do right, if you don’t price your product or service
correctly, it won’t sell in enough quantity to allow you to make a profit and
survive. Pricing is a real challenge for most businesses — especially when
you introduce a new product. Customer price tolerance determines where
your price should be, but the customer isn’t the only arbiter of price. Here
are some other things to consider:
280
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

 You usually can command a higher price if demand for your product or
service is greater than you can supply.
 If you’re distributing a product or service that people will buy no matter
what it costs (in economic terms, the price is inelastic), you’re free to
charge more. A simple example of this type of product is milk.
 You may have to hold your price down if you have a lot of competition.
In this case, if you can show intangible benefits to your customers, they
may pay more for your product just to get benefits that they can’t get
from your competitors.
 You usually can charge more for added features, but only if customers
perceive them as valuable. They won’t pay for bells and whistles they
don’t need.
 If you’re introducing new technology, you probably want to charge a
higher price initially to recover your development costs and then bring
it down as competitors enter the market.
 If you successfully position your product among higher-priced items,
you may be able to command a higher price.
281
Chapter 15: You Are Nothing without a Customer
Giving your product away — crazy 
or a great pricing strategy?
What if we told you that you could make money
by giving away your product — free! This idea
sounds impossible, doesn’t it? Well, it’s actually
a fairly common practice in some industries —
particularly on the Internet. Would you pay
attention to a recipe for success that could give
your company the following?
 $200 million in annual revenues
 A market cap of almost $3 billion
 25 million customers
 33 percent market share
Well, McAfee achieved those numbers by
giving away its core products, virus-protection
software. The Santa Clara, California-based
company followed the philosophy that getting
more users for its software would enable it to
uncover more virus samples. The company
could then charge for upgrades to its program.
This business model has been called the Gillette
method, named after the razor company that
first introduced it. The essence of the model is
that you give customers the core product or sell
it to them very cheaply, and you plan to make
your money on the refills or upgrades. Every
company has something that it can give away
to provide customers a chance to try a new
product or service. So, every company owner
should decide what his or her company will give
away and what it will sell. The right combination
is unbeatable!

282
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 
The strategy you use to price your products may change over time, depend-
ing on where they are in the product life cycle. Figure 15-2 and the following
list explain the various strategies used at particular points in the cycle:
 Cost-based pricing is based on adding a profit margin to the cost of pro-
ducing the product. Of course, you also need to consider how competi-
tors are pricing their products, as well as market demand.
 Sliding on the demand curve is a strategy in which you introduce a
product at a high price and then, as technological improvements let 
you achieve economies of scale, you reduce the price. This strategy
enables you to maintain an advantage over competitors.
 Penetration is a strategy that’s effective in a very competitive market
with similar products. Employ it when you need to gain quick accep-
tance and broad-based distribution. Penetration involves introducing
the product at a low price, which produces very minimal profit. Then
you gradually raise the price as customers accept the product. This
strategy requires huge expenditures for advertising and promotion.
 Demand-based pricing focuses on finding what customers are willing to
pay for the product.
 Loss-leader pricing calls for you to price your failing or obsolete prod-
ucts below cost to attract customers to other products in your line.
Choose a strategy that reflects the type of customer you have, your costs
related to the product, and the competitive environment. For more on a really
creative way to price, take a look at the nearby sidebar “Giving your product
away — crazy or a great pricing strategy?”.

Place is more than location
In marketing terms, place has to do with where your customers find your
products and services. Having a good product or service isn’t enough; you
need to get it to customers in the manner that’s best for them, whether that
be a retail outlet, mail order, direct from the manufacturer, or via the Internet.
Just because your business is located in a particular place doesn’t mean that
customers will automatically seek that location when they’re looking for your
product.
Talking to your customers will tell you where they want to find your product
or service. Doing anything other than what the customer expects is a recipe
for disaster.
Promote, promote, promote
The purpose of the promotion part of your marketing plan is to firmly establish
the identity and vision of your company in the customer’s mind. Promotion is,
283
Chapter 15: You Are Nothing without a Customer
Promotion budget: A real guessing game
For your marketing plan, and ultimately for your
business plan, you need to consider how much
of your budget you should allot to promotion.
We can give you no hard and fast rules about
how much to spend; it really depends on your
industry. In general, however, a new company
probably will spend about 20 to 30 percent of its
budget on marketing in the first couple years.
That figure will go down to between 5 and 10
percent in later years.
Many businesses use the percentage of sales
technique, which is based on how much, on
average, businesses in your industry spend on
promotion. That approach probably is more
important than trying to spend close to the aver-
age for all industries. Still, average percentage
of sales in your industry is only a benchmark for
your company. For example, if you’re trying to
differentiate yourself, you may be doing things
that your competitors are not, and that addi-
tional effort increases your promotional budget.
In such a case, the benchmark may not apply.
In thinking about the budget, you also must
figure out how much you have to spend to
achieve your marketing goals. In general, con-
sumer products require a much greater promo-
tional budget than other types of products.
You need to calculate the marketing cost per
unit (total marketing expense divided by the
number of units sold in the same period) and
work to bring that number down as you become
more of an expert in marketing tactics. The
bottom line is this: How much is a new customer
worth to you? Chapter 16 can help you discover
some cost-saving, guerrilla tactics.

perhaps, the most creative and important aspect of marketing. It includes per-
sonal selling, public relations, guerrilla advertising (using limited resources and
creative methods), sales promotion, and publicity.
You can’t plan an effective promotion strategy if you don’t know your cus-
tomers. Talk to your customers. (We say that a lot, don’t we?) Doing so will
pay big dividends and save you a lot of time and money. You can find out all
about promotion in Chapter 16.

Getting Noticed with Advertising
and Promotion
In This Chapter

 Making sure your company gets noticed

A
merican companies currently spend more than $150 billion a year on
advertising. Approximately $65 billion of this total ends up in television
ads; about $28 billion in newspaper ads; about $30 billion in magazine adver-
tising; a little more than $11 billion in radio ads; and about $10 billion for
advertising on the Web. The rest is divvied up among every kind of advertis-
ing you could ever imagine (and, no doubt, some types you couldn’t).
Is it any wonder then that everywhere you turn — in most of your business
and leisure activities — an advertisement for some product, service, or com-
pany is waiting to greet you? Consider the ubiquitous “www.fillintheblank.
com” plastered on a towering billboard to promote the latest e-business
wonder. What about the flashy advertisements that fill countless newspaper
and magazine pages and sound off on the radio and television airwaves. Even
a NASCAR racecar — with ads for Home Depot, Sears, Budweiser, or another
company plastered all over it — is a form of advertising. Advertising is big —
very big.
As the speed of business increases, however, the world of marketing is under-
going a radical transformation. Although the traditional, tried-and-true
approaches — such as television advertisements and print ads — are alive
and well, the quick rise of e-business and online shopping has turned the tra-
ditional world of advertising on its head. Internet advertising is growing by
the day, while many of the more traditional sources of advertising — such as
newspapers (the annual expenditures for which decreased by 2.4 percent
from 2005 to 2006) — are experiencing a slow but steady decline.

This chapter takes a close look at today’s wonderful world of marketing,
which is the process of creating, pricing, promoting, and distributing 
products and services. This chapter discusses such key marketing tech-
niques as advertising, publicity, promotion, special events, and premiums.
Eyeing the Basics of Advertising
At its heart, advertising is communication with consumers. More specifically,
advertising is nonpersonal mass communication intended to encourage poten-
tial customers to buy a company’s products or services. Why advertise? For
one thing, companies lose, on average, 25 percent of their customers every
year. This loss creates an ongoing need to encourage new customers to buy
products or services.
Companies spend billions of dollars each year to advertise their products
and services for other reasons as well (in addition to attracting new cus-
tomers). Here are the key objectives of advertising:
 Improve brand recognition
 Persuade potential customers to buy from you rather than from a 
competitor
 Generate sales leads
 Promote special events and sales
 Improve the image of the business
 Increase the quantity of items/services purchased
 Increase the amount spent per order
The right advertising viewed by the right people at the right time and place
can achieve all the goals in the preceding list. However, you have no guaran-
tee that the right people will see your ad, or that they’ll see it at the right
time and place. But making this happen is critical to advertising success, and
it’s central to the focus of advertising agencies and clients alike. This section
shows you how to place the right message with the right people where they
are most likely to notice it.
Running a successful ad campaign
Companies spend billions of dollars and powerful advertising agencies work
thousands of hours to fine-tune ad campaigns for consumers. Advertising has
evolved into a fine art of creating a response from people who are a com-
pany’s potential customers (see Chapter 15 for targeting consumers).

Advertising usually is an expensive proposition, and if it isn’t done properly,
it can be an incredibly easy way to waste money. Just like owning a boat, an
advertising budget can become a big hole in which you dump all your money.
Don’t let your company’s money go to waste and your customers slip through
your fingers and into the competition’s hands. Plan your advertising efforts
and target your best audiences. Be sure to follow these steps:
1. Set goals for your advertisement.
Are you trying to create a good feeling about your company among people
who view your advertisement? Are you trying to get people to buy more of
your products/services? Are you trying to convince readers that you put
quality at the very top of your list of priorities? You should develop your
advertisement after you understand why you’re advertising, not before.
2. Develop a budget.
Before you advertise, decide how much money you can devote to the
effort and create a budget based on this estimate. After you decide on 
a budget, stick to it. Avoid the temptation to load your campaign full of
unnecessary extras at the last minute.
3. Choose a target market.
Who are your most likely customers or clients? Stay-at-home moms and
dads who watch soap operas on television? Golfers who love to spend
loads of money on vacations to exotic destinations? Techophiles who
absolutely must have the latest-and-greatest gadget, whatever it may be?
People in your target market should be your number-one priority when
it comes to advertising.
4. Pick a medium.
No, not a fortune teller — we’re talking about picking which of the various
kinds of media you’ll use for your advertisement. Your decision will be
based in large part on your target market. If you’re selling sugar-coated
cereal, then you know that you’ll find some of your best customers watch-
ing Saturday-morning cartoons on television. If you’re advertising some
hot, new MP3 player, then you’ll want to be online where your best cus-
tomers will find you. For more information about where to place your ad,
see the next section.
5. Create your advertisement.
Although you can design your own advertisements, you’ll likely be well
served by bringing in a professional advertising firm to take on this
important task. The best firms can work closely with you to ensure your
input into the creative process and your ultimate satisfaction with the
final result. This is a case where getting a referral from a colleague or
other trusted source is a very good idea.
6. Place your advertisement.
287
Chapter 16: Getting Noticed with Advertising and Promotion

Although designing an effective advertisement isn’t necessarily an easy
task, placing the ad generally is quite easy. Members of the media place
a very high priority on advertising sales, and they’ll be quite happy to
take your money. As a result, most media outlets have made placing ads
simple; they’ll provide ample salespeople and customer service to help
you through the process.
7. Track your response.
Closely track the results of your advertising campaign to find out
whether it has the desired effect. In most cases, getting results means
people buying your product or service. Is there an uptick in sales after
your advertisement runs for a week on a local radio station? Are you get-
ting lots of click-throughs on your Web-based ad — and are these people
actually purchasing your products? These kinds of results tell you almost
immediately whether you’ve taken the right approach. They also reveal
whether you should continue with a particular ad or whether you should
dump it and move on to something else.
8. Adjust and repeat as necessary.
After you have the results of your advertisement, you can adjust your 
ad — including the ad’s design and where and how often it runs — and
then repeat Steps 1–7. Ads that run more frequently — for example, on
television once every hour, or once a month in a monthly magazine —
get a better response from consumers (read: sell more product) than
ads that run less frequently. However, this effect is offset by your budget
and how much you can afford. When you assess your campaign, a positive
change tells you that you’re on the right track; a negative response tells
you that you’ve got your work cut out for you.
Running a successful advertising campaign isn’t an accident. If you take the
time to create a plan to organize your own efforts, your advertising dollars
will go further, and your money will hold out longer.
Locating the best place to advertise
The answer to the question, “Where’s the best place to advertise?” is simple:
Advertise where your potential customers are. If your target customers are
buyers of cutting-edge computer equipment, chances are you’ll find them
surfing the Web or reading a variety of computer magazines that cater to
their particular tastes and interests. If you spend your advertising dollars in
places where you have no potential customers, you’re wasting your money!
Surely one of these places will work for your company’s advertisements,
based on where your potential customers are:
 Internet: Web sites are currently the hottest, but also the most uncer-
tain, places for companies to advertise. And, despite early indications,
288
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

banner ads — those pesky advertisements at the top, side, and bottom
of many Web sites — are only marginally effective, with click-through
rates of no more than 0.5 percent. The Internet can be the least expen-
sive place to go for advertising. With programs such as Google AdWords
(see Chapter 17), you pay a small amount of money — often much less
than a dollar — each time a potential buyer clicks on your ad. Expect
advertising on the Internet to continue its dramatic growth into the
future, but be aware that this form of advertising may be most appropri-
ate for brand building, that is, when you’re trying to increase customer
awareness of your brand.
 Newspapers: Although newspapers traditionally have been the first stop
for many company advertising campaigns, their popularity is declining
as a media outlet, which means they’re also becoming less popular as 
an advertising medium. More people than ever are getting their news
directly — in near-real time — from the Web or from 24-hour cable news
networks (such as CNN and MSNBC). Many newspapers have established
a strong online presence to retain old readers while attracting new ones
and tapping into new sources of advertising dollars.
 Magazines: Magazines are terrific places to advertise because they’re
typically targeted to specific audiences. You can choose from among car
magazines, sewing magazines, news magazines, stereo equipment maga-
zines, sailing magazines, and many more. Each publication has its own
unique demographic of readers just waiting to read your advertisement!
And don’t forget that many magazines are also online, and you may be
able to leverage your advertising dollars into both venues at a nominal
additional cost.
 Direct mail: With direct mail, you get to choose who receives your mar-
keting piece, and you get to decide exactly what message to send and
how often to send it. Although not particularly effective by itself — the
response rates for successful direct-mail campaigns are measured in the
low single digits — direct mail can play an important role as part of an
overall marketing campaign. E-mail direct marketing has much higher
response rates (up to 15 percent), so many companies are choosing this
less-expensive route to reach potential customers.
 Radio: When you have a good idea of who your prospective customers
are, you can target them through the selective use of radio ads. Different
radio stations have different kinds of listeners. A station that plays clas-
sical music all day long, for instance, has a much different listener pro-
file than a station that plays alternative rock all day long.
 Television: Television advertising can easily be shown at specific times
and days of the week, depending on your audience’s demographics. A
company that advertises on a mid-day television game show may never
advertise on a late-night comedy show, and vice versa.
Keep in mind that television advertising is the most expensive form of
advertising, so try the other forms first if you can.
289
Chapter 16: Getting Noticed with Advertising and Promotion

 Outdoor signs: Billboards, the sides of buildings and buses, baseball sta-
dium outfield walls — all are examples of outdoor advertising at its best.
If you can put an ad on it, you can bet that someone already has some-
where. In fact, Google plans to create an advertisement on the surface of
the moon that will be visible to viewers on Earth. That should get to ALL
their target customers!
Keeping your ads honest
We know that you wouldn’t intentionally create an advertisement that’s decep-
tive or misleading; however, we must discuss the topic, because the history
of marketing in the United States is replete with examples of advertising
that’s not only misleading, but also outright fraudulent.
Sellers are ultimately responsible for claims they make about their products
and services. In most cases, third parties — such as advertising agencies,
Web-site designers, or catalog marketers — also may be held liable for decep-
tive advertising if they participate in the preparation or distribution or are
aware of the deceptive claims. (Check out the nearby sidebar “The FTC: The
Big Brother of advertising” for more technical info about the laws.)
How can you protect your organization from being hung out to dry when a
manufacturer misrepresents a product to you, and you in turn rely on that
information in the ads you place? Be sure to ask for hard evidence that backs
up a manufacturer’s claims instead of simply repeating what the company
says about its product. And what should you do if a manufacturer isn’t able
to provide you with the proof you seek? 
 Be especially careful about the claims you make for the product in
your advertising. Avoid making outrageous performance claims, health
or weight-loss promises, or specific earnings guarantees, for instance.
 Reconsider your decision to carry the product in question. If you don’t
believe in a product you carry, after all, why should you sell it?
Here are some more tips from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to ensure
that your advertising meets fair practices standards:
 Disclaimers and disclosures must be clear and conspicuous. That is,
consumers must be able to notice, read or hear, and understand the
information you present. A disclaimer or disclosure alone usually isn’t
enough to remedy a false or deceptive claim.
 Demonstrations must show how a product will perform under normal use.
 Refunds must be made to dissatisfied consumers — if you promise to
make them.
290
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

 Sellers should take special care not to misrepresent a product or its per-
formance when advertising to children. Advertising directed to children
raises special issues. Children may have greater difficulty evaluating
advertising claims and understanding the nature of the information you
provide.
The FTC has published specific guidelines that you may find helpful in avoid-
ing problems in your advertising initiatives. Be sure to check them out at
www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/ruleroad.shtm.
Publicizing and Promoting 
Your Products and Services
You don’t have to spend all your money on advertising to get your prospec-
tive customers’ attention. In fact, for many companies, advertising is a small
part of the marketing mix. For these companies, publicity and promotion are
the most effective ways to spread the word about their products and ser-
vices. This section focuses on how a company uses publicity and promotions
to inform customers about their products and services, and how to use
guerilla marketing techniques to gain an edge.
Publicity: Getting noticed
Publicity is a message communicated through the media about your company
or your products/services because of perceived news value. Publicity is all
about attracting the attention of your potential customers by first attracting
the attention of the media — newspapers, magazines, radio talk shows, televi-
sion news shows, Web sites, and similar media outlets.
Good publicity is worth its weight in gold, because when a potential customer
sees, hears, or reads a media story about your organization, the perceived
credibility of the message is higher than an advertisement offers. Why?
Because potential customers tend to believe that the media is unbiased and
therefore is more apt to tell the truth. For example, if potential customers
encounter gushingly positive reviews of your studio’s latest film in the local
newspaper, a national magazine, and on radio talk shows, that publicity proba-
bly will have a much greater impact on increasing attendance figures than an
advertising campaign could. On the other hand, if the reviews you receive are
negative, no amount of advertising can save your film. Advertising is a power-
ful tool, but the right publicity at the right time and place can have much more
power.
Besides, publicity is free to you. And that’s definitely a benefit!
291
Chapter 16: Getting Noticed with Advertising and Promotion

As you can probably imagine, all kinds of ways — some traditional and some
not-so-traditional — are available to attract attention to your company or
product/service. This list presents some of the most common methods of 
getting business publicity:
 Make a media appearance: Have you ever watched a television show
such as Ellen or The Tonight Show and wondered how it finds all those
interesting people? For the most part, these people found the show
themselves — through their publicists. Receiving publicity on a popular,
nationally broadcast show can have an incredibly positive impact on a
business and on the sales of its products and services. Members of the
media are always looking for interesting people to interview; contact
your local newspaper reporter, call in to a radio talk show, or try to get
your company featured on a local television news show.
 Send out press releases: A press release is a written summary of some
newsworthy bit of information about a company, its products, or its ser-
vices, written in a way to be instantly digestible by the news media, that
is, clearly and concisely. Try to keep releases down to a page — two at
292
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 
The FTC: The Big Brother of advertising
In the United States, the Federal Trade Com-
mission (FTC) is charged with monitoring
advertising and taking legal action against
companies that break the law — something
that happens quite regularly, unfortunately.
According to the FTC Web site (www.ftc.
gov), the Federal Trade Commission Act
empowers the FTC to act in the interest of all
consumers to prevent deceptive and unfair acts
or practices. Here are two things your organi-
zation should absolutely not do, unless you want
to run afoul of Section 5 of the Act and have
your advertising be considered deceptive:
 Engage in a representation, omission, or
practice that misleads consumers
 Engage in a representation, omission, or
practice that affects consumers’ behavior
or decisions about the product or service
In addition, the FTC considers an act or practice
unfair when the injury it causes, or is likely to
cause, is substantial, not outweighed by other
benefits, and not reasonably avoidable.
The FTC Act is clear: Unfair or deceptive adver-
tising is strictly prohibited in any medium.
Advertising must tell the truth and not mislead
consumers. Advertising claims may be consid-
ered misleading if relevant information is left
out, or if the claims imply something that’s
simply not true. And it isn’t enough to make a
claim of performance in your advertising; claims
must be substantiated — especially when the
claims involve health, safety, or performance.
The type of evidence required for proper sub-
stantiation depends on the product or service
itself, the nature of the claim being made, and
what experts in the field believe is required. For
example, if your advertisement offers specific
figures supporting a claim — “tests show that
nine out of ten consumers are happier when
using our products,” for instance — you must
have evidence that clearly shows that nine out
of ten consumers really are happier when using
your products.

most. You’ll lose your reader if it takes too long to get to your point.
Most companies send out press releases all the time — particularly
when they introduce new products or services or when they want to
announce particular achievements or milestones. If you’re not using
news releases already, start doing it today. Create a list of media — 
both local and national — and start sending away. All it takes is one
good story to get your company the attention it deserves.
 Hold a press conference: Want to get your message out to a lot of
people at one time? Call a press conference. If your story is sufficiently
newsworthy (perhaps your researchers just invented a better mouse-
trap), you’ll have newspaper, radio, and television reporters falling all
over themselves to cover your story. Send out a press release to make
an event out of your announcement. If you have any friends in the
media, invite them to attend. Generate some buzz!
 Write a feature story: Many magazines and newsletters — particularly
those produced by professional associations and local lifestyle 
publishers — solicit stories from experts in various fields. If you’re an
author (or represent one) who just wrote a book on dieting and you want
to get some good publicity, try writing an article on holiday weight-loss
tips for a lifestyle magazine, for instance. In the process, you can plug
your book and your Web site. Find the publications most appropriate for
what your company does or produces and offer your services. You’ll
make a busy editor very happy when you do!
 Submit an op-ed article/Letter to the editor: Most newspapers invite
readers and guest columnists to submit articles and letters that address
current events or react to the editorial positions of the newspapers. For
example, suppose that you’re offended by your local newspaper’s support
of legislation that encourages city government purchases of imported
vehicles. As the owner of a Ford vehicle dealership, you could write an
op-ed piece (or a letter to the editor) decrying the outsourcing of
American manufacturing capacity to foreign countries. Voice your sup-
port of legislation that requires the city government to exclusively “buy
American.” Coincidentally, this article likely will generate (mostly) favor-
able publicity for your dealership within the paper’s distribution area,
thereby increasing your sales and popularity.
 Start (or publicize) a Web site: Web sites themselves have become news-
worthy. If a woman decides to sell her kidney on e-Bay, that’s news. If a
fan starts a Web site devoted to the intricacies of the Star Wars mythol-
ogy, that’s news. Most people and things (including companies and their
products/services) are finding their 15 minutes of fame through the
Internet. You can, too. If your organization doesn’t have a Web site, get
one. If you have a Web site, make sure that people find it. And how can
you do that? Check out Starting an Online Business For Dummies, by Greg
Holden (Wiley), for plenty of ideas.
293
Chapter 16: Getting Noticed with Advertising and Promotion

Promotion: Conveying information
Whether you focus on advertising campaigns or not, the bulk of your com-
pany’s marketing efforts and cash probably go into creating and distributing
promotional materials. Promotion is the conveying of information about your
company and its products and services. Although most promotional materi-
als are written or printed for inexpensive and easy distribution, they can also
take the form of e-mail messages and Web sites.
Chances are you’ve already used one or more of the following promotional
items in your business:
 Sales letter: A sales letter is a written appeal to a customer to consider
buying a company’s products or services. A sales letter may contain
information about the products or services, as well as special offers 
for buying sooner rather than later. A sales letter often is accompanied
by brochures, product sheets, or other promotional materials.
 Brochures: Brochures generally present detailed information about a
company, product, or service. They can take the form of a simple piece
of paper, folded in half or in thirds, or they can be slick, full-color, multi-
page marketing pieces or reports.
 Product sheets: Got a product? If so, you should have a product sheet to
go along with it! A product sheet is a one-page (often front-only but some-
times front and back) description of a product along with a photo and
key specifications. A product sheet should be complete enough to answer
your customers’ initial questions without overwhelming them.
 Publicity photos: Publicity photos give your customers (and the media)
a good idea of what you and your products/services look like. Generally,
publicity photos are accompanied by other promotional literature —
perhaps brochures or press releases.
 Audio/video: Although brochures, product sheets, and publicity photos,
for instance, are static, audiotapes and videotapes are dynamic, which
means they can convey much more information than a simple piece of
paper can. Today, audio or video promotional materials usually take the
form of CDs or DVDs. However, with the rise of high-quality streaming
video on the Web, the use of online promotional materials is surging.
To see some samples, check out the PR Newswire’s MultiVu Web site at
www.multivu.com and click on some of the What’s Hot video news 
stories.
 Promotional kit: A promotional kit is a folder that contains some or all of
the preceding items in this list. A kit for your company’s latest dispos-
able camera, for example, may contain a sales letter, a brochure, a prod-
uct sheet, a publicity photo, a video, and a working sample of the camera.
The purpose is to give potential customers an in-depth look at your
product, which hopefully will generate interest and sales.
294
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

 Web sites: Many companies are transferring their promotional materials
to their Web sites for a couple reasons. First, doing so costs little or
nothing, because you’ve already invested the money to create the pro-
motional materials. Second, a Web site is on 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week — it doesn’t sleep, and it doesn’t take breaks (well, unless the
server goes down!). However, because Web sites depend on people
making an effort to discover and visit them, you need to find ways to
help consumers along. Plaster your URL everywhere possible: on your
products, in your advertising, on blogs where your prospective cus-
tomers hang out, on the side of the Goodyear blimp — wherever people
might see it and be compelled to take the time to visit your site.
As with all marketing materials, you should tailor the use of your promotional
material specifically for your intended recipients. Figure out what kinds 
of materials your target customers will most likely respond to, and then pro-
vide them with these materials.
Guerrilla marketing
Organizations in today’s marketplace have become faster and more flexible,
and companies increasingly are aiming their products/services at specific
niches of customers. As a result, the traditional ways of marketing are becom-
ing less and less effective. In their place, advertisers are adopting techniques
that are unconventional by traditional marketing standards. Guerrilla market-
ing is the label applied to this particular brand of marketing.
According to Jay Conrad Levinson, the guru of guerilla marketing and author
of Guerrilla Marketing, 4th Edition: Easy and Inexpensive Strategies for Making
Big Profits from Your Small Business (Houghton Mifflin), this new approach
can be summed up as
Achieving conventional goals, such as profits and joy, with unconventional
methods, such as investing energy instead of money.
Levinson, being the guru that he is, has developed five rules that reflect the
guerrilla marketer’s view of the world:
 The 10/30/60 rule: According to Levinson, you should invest 10 percent
of your marketing budget to talking to everyone in your marketing uni-
verse — whether or not they match your customer profile. Use another
30 percent of the budget to convince people who match your customer
profile — your prospects — that they should become your customers.
Devote the last 60 percent to marketing to your current customers —
producing the most profits at a lower cost per sale.
 The 1/10/100 rule: This rule says that $1 spent communicating with
your staff is equivalent to $10 spent communicating with the trade,
which is equivalent to $100 spent communicating with your customers.
295
Chapter 16: Getting Noticed with Advertising and Promotion

In other words, communicating to your employees can be the most cost-
effective way to transmit your marketing message to your prospects and
current customers. Train all your employees to be familiar with your
products and services, so they can accurately tell others about them.
 The rule of thirds: According to Levinson, one-third of your online mar-
keting budget should go to designing and posting your company’s Web
site; one-third should go to marketing the site offline; and the final third
should go to improving and maintaining your Web site, keeping it enter-
taining and fresh.
 The rule of twice: This rule says that remaining truly competitive online
will cost you twice as much as you think it will cost.
 The rule of the ruler: This rule states that although you can delegate the
marketing function to others in your organization, you can’t delegate 
the passion and the vision that you feel for it. To ensure marketing suc-
cess, take command of your company’s marketing process and keep 
a close eye on it, regardless of who’s in charge.
Are you ready to supercharge your marketing efforts? Give guerrilla market-
ing a try — it could make a difference for you. For more information about
guerrilla marketing, check out Levinson’s Guerrilla Marketing Online Web site
at www.gmarketing.com.
Grabbing Consumers’ Attention with 
Special Events and Premiums
If you really want to attract attention to your company, special events and pre-
miums have the potential to do just that. For example, when the automotive
company BMW really wants to attract the attention of its potential customers,
it invites them to attend the Ultimate Driving Experience, where customers
can drive the company’s new model cars, accompanied by skilled driving
instructors. As BMW says, after you spend a day driving its cars, “your biggest
challenge will be saying good-bye.” If you want to see how special events and
premiums can help you reach your potential and current customers, check
out this section for more info.
Giving customers a hands-on 
experience: Special events
Special events provide a unique forum for potential customers to view, touch,
and actually try a company’s products before they buy them. In some cases
(such as sponsorships), a company’s involvement may be a bit more subtle,
296
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

with no mention of products or services that the company provides. In any
case, the goal of a special event is to raise the awareness of companies and
their products/services in the eyes of potential customers.
The following list presents several different kinds of special events for differ-
ent kinds of situations:
 Trade shows: Every industry — from automotive, to online media, to
poultry, to publishing — has trade shows. These shows attract a lot of
attention from potential buyers. (Actually, they mostly attract attention
from competitors that want to scope the competition!) Trade shows
allow companies to exhibit their wares to potential customers and the
media alongside the products of competitors. Many companies rely on
trade shows to generate sales and new business.
 Demonstrations: If you’ve ever been to a grocery store where a jolly
person was cooking and handing out food samples, you’ve experienced
a marketing demonstration. Demonstrations enable consumers to expe-
rience (and sometimes even try) products and to make informed deci-
sions about buying them.
 Sponsorships: Many companies sponsor public events to improve their
public images while also attracting potential customers. Car races,
beauty pageants, charity walks — all are events that need sponsors to
help further their causes. And these sponsorships can help companies
reach their desired audiences.
Giving away useful items with 
a message: Premiums
Have you ever been to a baseball game where the home team gave away ball
caps? Have local real-estate agents left you calendars with their photos and
phone numbers on them? Have you ever received a pencil or pen with the
name of a local plumber, or a T-shirt emblazoned with the Web site of the
world’s largest bookstore? These are all examples of marketing premiums.
Premiums serve the dual purpose of getting an item that customers will regu-
larly use in their hands, and sending them a marketing message on that item
by emblazoning it with the company or product name. Each time a customer
uses the item, he or she receives a small dose of advertising.
Here are some of the more popular premiums that companies put out:
 Pens and pencils
 Coffee mugs
 T-shirts
297
Chapter 16: Getting Noticed with Advertising and Promotion

 Pocket knives
 Mouse pads
 Baseball caps
 Calculators
 Tote bags
If you decide to distribute premiums, set a budget in advance and be sure
that you’re getting as much bang for the buck as possible. If your budget is
$25,000, for example, you should get 5,000 premiums for $5 apiece — enough
for all your current customers and an extra 4,000 prospects — instead of get-
ting only 2,500 premiums at a cost of $10 each. It all depends on your plan for
distributing the premiums and which audience you’re targeting.
Don’t buy cheap, inexpensive-looking premiums, however! Premiums are a
reflection of your company. If the premiums that you hand out are cheap and
shoddy, you’ll send a cheap and shoddy message to your customers and
prospects. Get the best-quality items that your budget can support.

their customers. Today, however, salespeople and the companies they work for
realize that building relationships with customers offers tremendous advantages.
In a trusting relationship, customers are happier, salespeople sell more, and

mind? You probably can’t find a better example of the old style of selling than
a used-car salesperson. He is aggressive, pushy, and focused only on making

a sale — any sale — now! What will happen two months, two weeks, or even
two days from now isn’t important. A used-car salesperson absolutely won’t
let you walk out of the dealership without putting the hard sell on you.
This old-style approach to selling is called transaction marketing because it
focuses on individual sales, or transactions. In transaction marketing, buyers
and sellers usually have no ongoing relationship with one another, and com-
munications are limited. The primary goal is short-term: Sell something and
sell it now. What? You don’t like that pink Cadillac? How about if we repaint it
for you? What do we need to do to get you to buy this car right now?
Many salespeople and the companies that employ them (including car dealer-
ships) are now trying a new approach because people are becoming less
responsive to the old one. This new approach is based on relationships, not
transactions. Indeed, more and more companies are discovering that creating
ongoing, long-term relationships with clients and customers can pay off — in
increased sales and in decreased marketing costs — over the long run. And
these results mean a much healthier bottom line.
With this new approach, called relationship-based selling, the focus is on
 Building a long-term relationship with the customer
 Selling the benefits of your product or service
 Providing fanatical customer service
 Being totally committed to the customer
 Talking to the customer continuously
Why the change in emphasis from transactions to relationships? It’s really
quite simple: People prefer to buy from companies with which they have 
relationships. They want to do business with companies that show they care
about their customers. You can show that you care through your commitment
to your customers, your superior customer service, and the importance you
place on maintaining a relationship rather than simply selling a product.
So, suppose that you want to change your company’s sales approach from
transaction-based to relationship-based. Exactly how do you do that? Here
are the four keys to building relationships with your clients and customers;
put these to work in your organization right away:
 Build trust. The first step in developing long-term relationships with
your clients and customers is to build trust by doing what you say
you’re going to do. Trust is the glue that holds business relationships
together and makes them stronger and deeper over time.
 Create bonds. Long-term business relationships depend on the creation
of bonds between organizations and customers (or between two organi-
zations). Bonds are formed when organizations and people find that they
300
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

have mutual goals and interests, and they decide to work together to
take advantage of them. As relationships grow, these bonds get stronger.
 Be empathetic. Being empathetic means that you see a situation through
the eyes of another party. If you’re empathetic as a salesperson, you’ll
develop an understanding of a customer that goes much deeper than a
relationship focused only on a transaction. Empathy is an emotional link
that builds trust between parties.
 Encourage reciprocity. Sometimes, you have to give a little to get a lot.
Reciprocity is giving up something that you want to get something that
you need. When reciprocity is present in the business selling process —
from customer to supplier and vice versa — the result is a stronger busi-
ness relationship that’s built to last.
Telemarketing: Dialing for Dollars
If you’ve ever had your dinner or slumber interrupted by a telephone sales
call, you may think that telemarketing is a bad thing. Certainly, few people
relish calls from fast-talking insurance salespeople, vinyl home-siding con-
tractors, real estate brokers, and, more recently, pesky automated calling sys-
tems that never sleep and can complete thousands of calls a day. But for
companies that use these contacts to sell products and services, telemarket-
ing is a good thing — often a very good thing.
Keep in mind that, there may be better ways of selling for your particular
business than telemarketing. In the United States, recent Federal Communi-
cations Commission (FCC) rulings on telemarketing, along with the Federal
Trade Commission’s (FTC) National Do Not Call Registry, have made life
much more difficult for telemarketers. Consider all your selling options care-
fully before you commit significant resources to a telemarketing campaign.
Inbound telemarketing
If you’ve ever called a company on a toll-free number to place an order for a
product or service, you’ve participated in inbound (or passive) telemarketing.
Inbound telemarketing is a particularly effective and fruitful sales technique,
because people generally call only when they’re ready to place orders to pur-
chase your product or service. These customers often call as a result of print
ads, catalogs, radio or television advertising, a Web site, or other forms of
advertising that your company uses (see Chapter 16).
Here are some ways you can use inbound telemarketing to your benefit:
301
Chapter 17: Navigating the New World of Selling

 Order taking
 Help-desk solutions
 Ticket sales
 Web site call processing
 Surveys and questionnaires
 Dealer location
 Seminar registration
 Reservations
Although many companies run their own inbound telemarketing operations,
other enterprising organizations outsource these operations to call centers —
both offshore and onshore — that are specifically geared to handle the task of
inbound telemarketing. Call centers are often less expensive than hiring and
training in-house staff, buying telecommunications equipment, and leasing
phone lines. Another benefit is that the individuals working at call centers
generally are specially trained for the task. And many call centers can offer
your customers 24-hour, seven-day-a-week service.
Outbound telemarketing
Outbound telemarketing is the active kind of telemarketing that most people
associate with the use of the term. In outbound telemarketing, salespeople
place phone calls to prospects, make quick sales pitches, and then try to sell
them products or services. If they can’t make a sale right away, telemarketers
try to gauge the customers’ interest; if they sense some hope, they can turn
over the prospects to full-time salespersons who can make more sophisti-
cated sales pitches.
Here are some ways you can put outbound telemarketing to work for your
company:
 Sales lead generation
 Customer service
 Appointment setting
 Customer surveys
 Sales campaigns
 Database updates
 Customer care and retention
 Follow-up calls
302
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

Just as some companies specialize in inbound telemarketing for other busi-
nesses, some companies specialize in outbound telemarketing. You can find
plenty by turning to the “Telemarketing Services” listings in the Yellow Pages
or by doing an Internet search; just type in the keyword “telemarketing.” If
you decide to outsource your outbound telemarketing, be sure that the com-
pany you hire has a good reputation in the industry. Also, confirm that the
company has experience selling the kinds of products or services that you
offer. Ask for references and check them.
Selling on the Web
Many companies today are working hard to bring back a level of personaliza-
tion that many consumers haven’t experienced in a long time — and they’re
doing it through their Web sites. One such company is Amazon.com, one of
the nation’s top online retailers. It has designed a hugely successful com-
puter database around its Web site, which sells everything from books and
music to groceries and home-improvement supplies.
As a returning customer to Amazon.com, you’ll be greeted with a list of rec-
ommended purchases — all by title and all based on your tastes as reflected
by your previous orders. The more you order, the more Amazon.com knows
about your personal preferences, and the better the database gets at guess-
ing the items you may want to purchase. What Amazon.com has done with its
database is nothing short of astounding, and it offers a hint of the promise of
online selling’s future.
As time goes on, shopping on the Internet is destined to become a more per-
sonalized experience. And as online retailers get to know consumers better,
the people reward the retailers with long-term business relationships. The
smart e-commerce companies are already well on their way to making shop-
ping on the Internet a rewarding experience for everyone. In the following
sections, we consider some specifics of selling on the Web, including busi-
ness-to-business (“b2b”) transactions and online advertising.
Online retailing and wholesaling for 
business-to-business transactions
The early focus of commerce on the Internet has been on retail sales to indi-
vidual consumers. This focus is beginning to change as software and security
evolve to a point where businesses can collaborate with each other safely
and securely. Today, online retailing (selling directly to consumers) and
wholesaling (selling to businesses, which then sell to other businesses or
directly to consumers) are more and more popular. For example, Global
303
Chapter 17: Navigating the New World of Selling

eXchange Services (which manages one of the world’s largest electronic com-
munities, with more than 100,000 trading partners and more than 1 billion
transactions a year), IBM, Microsoft, and other software developers are work-
ing hard to make business-to-business selling over the Internet speedy, safe,
and secure.
For instance, although most companies have chosen to develop closed, pri-
vate computer networks for their customers to place orders in the past,
others are now pushing the envelope by driving sales applications onto the
Internet. Executives at clothing manufacturer Fruit of the Loom, Inc., decided
against a private network and went with an Internet-based system, initially
made available to its 50 key wholesalers. These wholesalers received a dedi-
cated “Activewear Online” computer system, specifically programmed to dis-
play Fruit of the Loom catalogs, process electronic purchase orders, and
manage product inventories. The Internet makes all these transactions and
more possible. (For more on business to business selling, see the later sec-
tion “Doing Business with Other Businesses.”)
Online advertising: Replacing click-throughs
with search-engine marketing
In the old days of the Web, most advertising took the form of banner ads —
boxes (usually containing just text in the earliest days, with graphics and
photographs entering the picture as time went on) pitching some product or
service that led to special Web pages or other Web sites when you clicked on
them (also called click-throughs). Also, as soon as you visited some Web sites
in the old days, ad after ad would pop up, grabbing control of your computer
and whisking you away into a wonderful state of product bliss. Or so the
advertisers would have you think! However, as the Web has become more
heavily traveled, advertising has become more sophisticated — and trickier.
Today, you still see banner ads (many of which are animated — all the better
to attract your attention) and pop-ups, which even the latest Internet browsers
can never seem to completely defeat. However, the big news in online adver-
tising today is search engine marketing (SEM). The three largest SEM vendors
are Google AdWords, Yahoo! Search Marketing, and Microsoft adCenter. In
general, SEM is growing faster than traditional forms of advertising.
Businesses have voted with their wallets, and the vote is in: Search engine
marketing really works. In its fiscal year ending 2006, Google brought in about
$10.5 billion from its online advertising services. But how does SEM work?
The following list shows how the most popular SEM service — Google
AdWords — works so you can see how it may help your organization:
304
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

1. Register your company/product/service on the Google AdWords Web
site (adwords.google.com).
As part of your registry, you’ll decide which level of service to sign up
for (starter edition or standard edition), pick out keywords that the
search engine will use to link your ad to search results, and write your
advertisement. AdWord advertisements are short — just a one-line title
and two text lines. As part of its services, Google provides tips and
instructions for completing the steps.
2. Decide how much you want to spend.
As an AdWord user, you set both an overall budget limit and a maximum
price you’re willing to pay when someone clicks through your ad. For
example, you may decide on an overall limit of $500 and a maximum
price per click of $1. You don’t pay for your ad unless someone clicks on
it, so in this example, you won’t exhaust your total budget until con-
sumers click on your ad 500 times.
3. Target your advertising to selected customers or areas.
You can decide if you want your ad to show up whenever anyone in the
world clicks through or just when people in your city or state click
through. For example, if you have a dog-sitting business in Phoenix,
Arizona, it won’t do you much good if a customer in Moscow or Beijing
sees your ad and clicks on it.
4. Monitor your results.
Google provides extensive statistics on your ads that you can use to
check your success — or lack thereof. With this information, you can
determine if you need to make adjustments in your approach.
5. Make adjustments until you find the ad setup that works for your
product/service and goals.
AdWords give advertisers who set a higher price per click priority over
those who set a lower price per click. Continuing our earlier example, if
you set a price of $1 per click and a competitor sets a price of $2 per
click, Google will place your competitor’s ad higher on the list of ads
than yours. If you find that your ad is getting little traffic because it
hardly ever shows up, you have to increase the price per click as well as
your overall budget to accommodate increased traffic. You may also try
different keywords to increase your visibility.
The world of online advertising is in a state of constant flux. With each pass-
ing year, new technologies lead to new ways to get ads in front of potential
customers. If you decide that online advertising is for you (and most compa-
nies today utilize at least some form of online advertising), consider your
options carefully and always measure your results. If a particular approach
isn’t working for you, don’t hesitate to try something else.

Doing Business with Other Businesses
The nature of selling to other businesses has changed dramatically over the
past decade. The change isn’t so much a shift from transaction selling to rela-
tionship selling, because businesses have long depended on developing
strong relationships with business customers to promote sales. The change
is mostly due to the mass computerization of the ordering process and the
widespread use of the Web for e-commerce applications. In the following sec-
tions, we examine some details of doing business with other business, includ-
ing electronic data interchange and vendor-managed inventory.
The need for speed (and accuracy):
Electronic data interchange
Electronic data interchange (EDI) is a set of standards for the exchange of
orders and other business documents from computer to computer in a
machine-readable format. In simple terms, EDI is a conversation between two
businesses or within a business that’s expressed in an electronic format. EDI
is the most commonly used electronic commerce format in business because
it allows businesses to reduce their costs and improve their efficiency and
competitiveness.
Specifically, electronic data interchange offers these benefits:
 Speed: Information traveling between computers moves very rapidly
with little or no human intervention to slow it down. Sending electronic
data (such as purchasing information) across the country takes only
seconds.
 Accuracy: Computer-to-computer data interchange totally eliminates the
errors that can occur when a supplier receives regular manual orders
and then rekeys them into its ordering system. EDI leaves virtually no
room for mistakes, assuming that the order was correct to begin with.
 Economy: The price is right! It costs very little or nothing to send ordering
information electronically from buyer to seller. You also see additional
savings because of the elimination of several tasks, including the rekeying
of data, human handling, routing, and delivery. All in all, EDI results in a
substantial reduction in the cost of a transaction.
Before the advent of EDI, most business-to-business sales were handled via
paper purchase orders. A buyer received a purchase request from someone
in her organization. The buyer reviewed catalogs or discussed the require-
ment with salespeople to get price quotes or other information about the
items to be purchased. After the buyer settled on the items to purchase and
where to purchase them, she generated a purchase order to be typed up 
306
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

and mailed out to a vendor. Upon receiving the purchase order, the vendor
manually entered the items into its shipping system, pulled the items to be
shipped, generated an invoice, and shipped the items and the invoice to the
customer. All this back and forth took a lot of time — at least a week or more —
and the various data-entry points along the way often introduced mistakes.
EDI short-circuits this entire process by transmitting an electronic purchase
order from the buyer to the vendor instantly and then triggering the process-
ing of an order immediately. In many cases, companies ship the items on the
same day that the purchase orders are sent out. In addition, EDI systems send
accurate receiving documents to the customers when the items are shipped
and send invoices directly to the customers’ accounts payable departments
for payment.
Choosing your partners: Vendor-
managed inventory
Some companies — such as manufacturers of aircraft engines or hospitals,
which require large quantities of consumable items — use a lot of inventory.
For these businesses, the process of ordering, receiving, and stocking inven-
tory can be a very time-intensive process — especially if the company is
using old-fashioned, manual systems. What if you could forget about manag-
ing your inventory altogether? What if your inventory was always kept up-to-
date automatically, with no need for human intervention (ordering, receiving,
stocking, tracking) within your organization? Vendor-managed inventory (VMI)
does just that — and more.
In the uniquely collaborative partnerships formed by VMI, companies farm out
their inventory management processes to one or more vendors. These ven-
dors keep their clients properly stocked at exactly the right amounts of
inventory at all times. VMI contractors manage this process; they receive reg-
ular inventory sales or usage data via their computers — often through the
use of electronic data interchange (EDI) and the Internet (see the previous
section).
A typical vendor-managed inventory system consists of the following modules:
 Inventory-level monitoring: Indicates past and present inventory levels
for all items being monitored. Includes such data as item names, item
quantities and reorder points, current inventory levels, and past inven-
tory levels.
 Replenishment status: Indicates vendor replenishment orders. Includes
such data as order number, order amount, order date, ship date, and
planned delivery date.
307
Chapter 17: Navigating the New World of Selling

 Logistics status: Indicates the logistics status of past and present replen-
ishment orders. Includes such data as order number, ship date, carrier
name, truck ID number, and planned delivery date.
 Consumption status: Used for determining planned consumption by the
vendor. Includes such data as item location, planned consumption, and
planned special events (such as overtime, holiday closings, and so on).
Vendor-managed inventory requires tremendous trust on the part of the cus-
tomer — the kind of trust that results in long-term business relationships.
After the VMI system is up and running and the purchasing company is start-
ing to realize the benefits, the VMI contractor can expect to have a very long
and prosperous selling relationship with the customer.
CRM: Getting a Handle on Your Contacts
Customer relationship management (CRM) is the latest-and-greatest way to
manage your business’s relationships with your customers. In essence, a
CRM is simply a computerized database that tracks information about cus-
tomers. In the old days, customer information — names, addresses, phone
numbers, and so on — was filed away on index (or Rolodex) cards or on
sheets of paper stapled into file folders. Today, digitized CRM systems are
light years ahead of those old approaches to doing business, and a number of
computer systems on the market specialize in capturing, storing, and analyz-
ing customer information.
Here’s a list of the functions you’ll find in a typical CRM system:
 Company and contact management
 Lead management
 Activity management
 Opportunity management
 Charting
 Reporting
 E-mail marketing and mailing lists management
 Sales forecasting
 Microsoft Outlook e-mail integration
 Notes
 Business Intelligence management
Computerized CRM systems offer the following benefits to the businesses
that use them:
308
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

 Enables companies to provide better customer service by centralizing
customer information and making it more readily to those who need it.
 Makes it easy to share customer information throughout an 
organization — just down the hall or around the world. You can quickly
share info because of its ready availability on most any company com-
puter or even data-enabled phones such as Treo and Blackberry.
 Helps companies give customers exactly what they want, when and
where they want it. As customer ordering information is compiled over
a long period of time, salespeople can better anticipate future customer
needs.
 Makes the entire selling process more efficient. It saves both time and
money that used to be wasted in trying to coordinate a variety of cus-
tomer information systems — often paper based — in scattered offices.
 Helps companies retain their current customers by keeping them sat-
isfied while they search to find new ones.
Is there a CRM system in your company’s future? If your business has any-
thing to do with sales, there probably already is! Although you can use CRM
software for all sorts of sales-related tasks, the systems generally fall within
one of two categories:
 Sales force automation (SFA), which facilitates the sales process. The
system keeps track of current customers, sales leads for new customers,
and forecasts and reports on the company’s sales pipeline.
 Customer service/support (CSS), which helps track customer com-
plaints, service requests, repair scheduling, and other customer service-
related tasks.
Because choosing the right CRM is a critical decision for your business, take
your time when scouting out the right product for you. The right system for you
is the one that works and will allow for future growth. Ask your colleagues or
industry contacts what they use, and ask the CRM salesperson for references
who you can call or e-mail to discuss their satisfaction. And when you select a
system and implement it, monitor the rollout closely — checking in often with
your salespeople — to make sure it is doing what it is supposed to do.
Keeping Your Best Customers
Many companies make two major mistakes that keep them from increasing
their sales and improving their profits (something that doesn’t always occur
simultaneously, by the way):
 They trap themselves in a continual cycle of scrambling to find new 
customers.
309
Chapter 17: Navigating the New World of Selling

 They spend enormous amounts of time and money trying to keep all
their customers.
Both strategies tend to backfire.
Experts often say that 80 percent of a company’s sales and profit come from
just 20 percent of its customers. If this is indeed the case, it makes sense to
do whatever you can to retain your very best customers and to quit wasting
time on your very worst customers — the ones who spend the least money
but cause you the most headaches. The following sections discuss how you
can build relationships to hang on to your best customers, as well as identify
your bad customers so you can get rid of them.
Identifying your best customers
Who are your best customers? Very simply, they’re the customers who account
for the greatest percentage of your sales — the loyal, repeat customers who
cost you the least to maintain and send more dollars to your bottom line. You
like these customers! If you adopt a good customer relationship management
(CRM) system (see the previous section), finding the best customers — and
the worst ones — will be easy!
You can devise your own measures for determining who’s a valuable cus-
tomer, but one way to do it involves statistics. This suggestion is for people
who like to crunch numbers. For the rest of you, look at the total revenue
generated by the customer and the frequency of its purchases. Compare
those figures against other customers. You may decide to take the top 25 per-
cent of your customers and see what they contribute to your total revenues.
Okay, back to statistics. For a moment, look at each of your customers as a
series of transactions over time. Now follow these steps:
1. Calculate the present value of future purchases based on the cus-
tomer’s buying patterns to date.
2. To that number, add the projected value of referrals from that 
customer.
3. Subtract the cost of maintaining the customer (costs from advertising,
promotions, and so on).
The figure you calculate is the customer’s lifetime value to your company. (If
you’ve forgotten how to calculate present value, or never knew how to do it,
look in Chapter 12 for a quick refresher course.) Although you shouldn’t use
lifetime value as the only determinant as to whether you should keep a par-
ticular customer, it is a key consideration.
310
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

Identifying your best customers is just the first step. You need to find ways 
to encourage them to remain your best customers. More on that in the next
section.
Rewarding and keeping 
your best customers
Customers love to feel as though they’re important to the companies that
they hand money to. They want you to respect what they’re contributing to
your success. When you get a chance, therefore, reward your best customers
so they stay your best customers. The following sections discuss a couple
more strategies for making sure that you keep your best customers.
Frequency awards
Airline frequent-flier programs have spawned many frequency reward clones
for other industries. The basic principle of frequency programs is that the
more your customers buy from you, the more benefits they get, and those
benefits increase with use. Here are some examples of effective frequency
programs:
 Some drugstores have customers sign up for cosmetic cards, photo
development cards, and vitamin cards. Every time a customer buys a
product in one of those lines, the store stamps the card. When the cus-
tomer has filled the card, he or she gets, say, a $5 discount on the next
purchase.
 Selling season passes to theme parks, water parks, miniature golf
courses, and the like is a way of providing discounts to the customers
who use those facilities most.
 VIP programs reward a company’s most frequent customers. These cus-
tomers may get special days to shop at discounted rates or receive invi-
tations to events designed exclusively for them. Companies such as
Macy’s department store have these programs.
Complaint marketing
No company likes to hear complaints, but they’re a fact of life in business 
so you may as well learn to deal with them positively. Look at it this way:
Complaints are merely a way to find out how you can improve your company.
Continuous improvement is one of the core principles of running a successful
business. Plus, when you give customers a forum to complain, you show that
you have nothing to hide and really value their opinions.
311

A win-win strategy for great long-term
customer relationships
After you identify your best customers and do what you can to reward/keep
them in the short term, you should consider how to keep them happy for life.
The strategy we recommend is based on the characteristics of this new busi-
ness world we live in. If you apply this win-win strategy in your business,
you’ll sell to satisfied customers who keep coming back for more. Specifically,
the strategy is centered on four principles of the new marketplace, which we
describe in the following sections.
Owning your market
To be successful in business today, you have to create your own niche in the
market and be the leader. When you’re the market leader, people look at you
differently. You have an automatic edge over your potential competitors. You
set the standards in the market and can encourage others to develop prod-
ucts and services that are complementary to yours. That was Microsoft’s
strategy when it carved out a niche in computer operating systems with its
Windows product.
If you find that competitors aren’t meeting certain customer needs in your
industry, you’ve found a niche that your business can serve.
Positioning your company
Products come and go, but if you run your business correctly, your company
will last for a long time. Therefore, it makes sense to spend as much or even
more time positioning your company in the market than your products and
services. Positioning is attempting to control the way customers perceive
your company and its products/services. Taking a proactive approach to
positioning your company is important, because if you don’t position it, your
customers, distributors, suppliers, and competitors certainly will. And they
may not position your company the way you want.
With positioning, perception is reality. Whether what’s perceived is true or not,
the customer makes decisions based on his perception. So, it’s important that
the perception of your company and its products/services is a positive one.
Customers can perceive two identical products differently depending on how
they’re marketed. For example, you’ve probably seen a brand-name product in
a store located right next to a generic brand that has the same ingredients.
Many consumers purchase the name brand for more money just because they
perceive a difference, even though one doesn’t exist.
Mass customizing (no, this isn’t an oxymoron)
One great benefit of technology is that it allows businesses to customize their
products and services to meet the specific needs of customers. Mass cus-
tomization is giving your customers what they want, when they want it, and
312
Part IV: Marketing in the New World 

in the specific way they want it. Anything that can be digitized can be cus-
tomized; manufacturers that use computer-aided manufacturing techniques,
for instance, can program in customer changes by pushing a few buttons.
Here’s another example: Companies that produce written documents can
easily customize wording to speak directly to specific customers.
The fundamental requirement for mass customization is a good relationship
with your customers. When they trust you, they can guide you in your efforts
to give them exactly what they want.
Focusing on things you can’t touch or see
Businesses often become so product/service-focused that they can’t see or
they ignore what’s really significant. The most important things about your
company and its products/services are the things you can’t see or touch —
the intangibles, in other words:
 Quality
 Customer focus
 Reliability
When your competitors start competing based on price alone, the only way
you can gain an advantage is by adding value with intangibles. Customers
tend to buy from businesses with which they have ongoing relationships and
where they perceive value because they’ve invested time and effort.
Getting rid of bad customers
It may sound harsh to encourage you to get rid of your bad customers, but
the reality is that they’re holding your business back. They’re the ones who
have a bad debt history with your company. They buy infrequently and in so
little volume that if you ran the numbers, you’d find that keeping them actu-
ally is costing you money. The most valuable customers, on the other hand,
are making you money.
Every company has good customers and bad customers. Your goal is to keep
the good customers and get rid of the bad ones. There are two key ways to
get rid of your bad customers:
 Convert your bad customers into good ones. Ideally, it would be great if
you could simply convert your bad customers into good ones. In some
cases, you may want to give it a try. How? Sometimes, you just need to
give a bad customer a wake-up call to let them know that the party is
about to end. For example, you can say, “If you don’t order at least
$10,000 worth of coffee beans within the next month, we’ll have to ask
313
Chapter 17: Navigating the New World of Selling

you to take your business elsewhere.” Or you can try giving your bad
customers special incentives to buy more of your products/services —
such as a one-time discount for signing onto a long-term buying program.
 “Fire” your bad customers by refusing to do business with them.
Unfortunately, some bad customers aren’t worth saving. These cus-
tomers will be bad forever, no matter what steps you take. Do what you
can to identify these customers as soon as you can and then simply
refuse to do business with them. You don’t need to be nasty about it;
just tell them that they need to find other companies to do business
with. The breakup may sting for a little bit, but short-term hurt is well
worth the long-term gain to your business.

new part altogether (how’s that for problem solving?). In this
part, we discuss manufacturing, distribution, and quality —
and how the latest technology has had a major impact on
each. We explore the most important concepts of risk man-
agement. We reveal the secrets of successful negotiation —

It’s a Brave New World
In This Chapter
 Understanding the manufacturing evolution

 Getting a grip on materials management and scheduling
 Producing a quality product/service
 Maintaining your product and manufacturing processes
 Looking at distribution as a competitive advantage
O
ver the past decade, manufacturing productivity has increased substan-
tially due to technological advances and globalization, which enable
manufacturers to automate routine tasks, track production, coordinate the
supply chain, and access low-cost labor. This productivity means that busi-
nesses often have excess capacity that they can use to partner with smaller
businesses that have compatible products. Excess capacity and the desire to
partner with other businesses to take advantage of individual core competen-
cies have helped smaller businesses find a home for manufacturing in the
United States.
We’ve also now seen a return to the idea of giving customers exactly what
they want, when they want it. In this chapter, you find out how the manufac-
turing process has changed and what you can do to maximize profit without
sacrificing quality and customer satisfaction. A typical manufacturing plant
has five broad functional areas:
 Purchasing
 Materials management and production scheduling
 Production
 Quality control
 Maintenance

318
Part V: Other Important Stuff 
Each area must be designed, and metrics for the process defined, so that the
manufacturer can maintain effectiveness at all points of the production process.
Along the way in this chapter, we cover these processes and look at how they
can be employed most effectively.
Manufacturing Today Is a New Game
Manufacturing traditionally has been a cost center for businesses, with the
purpose of making products in batches — large batches. So, the goal of the
production manager has been to control costs — at all costs. The idea that
manufacturing could be a strategic part of a business didn’t cross anyone’s
mind until fairly recently. Manufacturing is now seen as a strategic part of the
larger supply chain for the business, and process innovation has become a
significant competitive advantage for businesses that practice it.
Too many manufacturers devote the majority of their budgets to new product
development and don’t think about how important new process development
is. In today’s markets, the way you manufacture a product often is the most
critical element — perhaps even more so than the product itself. Your innova-
tive process that competitors don’t have will give you a competitive advantage
in the market and enable you to satisfy your customers’ need for speed.
To successfully innovate in both products and processes, strategic manufac-
turing relies on four critical principles:
 Real-time data collection: With the rapid pace of production today and
the need to reduce operating costs, manufacturers require information
in real time. Bar codes and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags
and readers enable manufacturers to electronically tag parts and boxes
of the finished product. Then, using a remote reading device they can
locate any item and immediately see all the pertinent information about
that item, such as part number, date, supplier, and so forth.
 Flexible and intelligent production processes: Highly competitive mar-
kets require that manufacturers be adaptable to change and quick to
respond to customer needs. CNC machines (computer numerical control)
can receive input from computer designs and fabricate a component to
exact specifications. And you can modify your designs and produce that
modified product quickly and easily, saving time and money.
 Global supply-chain management: When your product moves through
different plants for manufacturing, packaging, and distribution, you can
track and manage the process in real time to ensure quality and timeli-
ness. For example, C.R. Bard, a medical device company, adopted an
enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that performs this task. The
ERP system can track and manage a medical device from the company’s
manufacturing facility in South Carolina, to its packaging facility in

Mexico, to its sterilization facility in Covington, Georgia, and finally to its
distribution facility in another location in Covington. The company can
monitor the progress of any product in real time. These systems are
often used in combination with RFID tracking devices.
 Just-in-time sequencing in the supply chain: Many manufacturers have
adopted the just-in-time process for managing raw materials and inventory
to avoid overstocking, which is costly. For example, Delphi, a supplier to
the automobile industry, synchronized its manufacturing activities with
those of the assembly line of its customer. It delivers parts when the cus-
tomer needs them, in the same sequence as the product being assembled.
The next sections discuss how you can use technology to make your
processes more efficient and how to outsource those capabilities that you
don’t have.
Using technology to make things fly
Technology has made a world of difference in the realms of supply-chain
management, manufacturing, assembly, and logistics (moving goods from one
place to another). Robotics and other forms of intelligent machinery enable a
manufacturer to gain productivity, maintain flexibility, and achieve superior
levels of quality. The effect is magnified when technology is applied to repeti-
tive tasks and quick setups. Here are three examples of how manufacturers
use automation technology in different situations:
 Inventory tracking: Bar coding and RFID technology (see the explanation
in the previous list) have lightened the load for businesses that track
inventories. A handheld bar coder enables workers to capture production
information without having to enter it into a computer. This technology
saves a tremendous amount of time and decreases the chances of errors
that often occur with manual data-entry methods.
 Instruction, fabrication, and assembly: Computer-generated manufac-
turing has made it possible to program a machine to produce exactly the
part you want much more quickly and accurately than a human ever could.
Manufacturers that have invested in these state-of-the-art machines now
have computer screens on the factory floor where workers can access
designs, instructions, and manuals and then make decisions about modi-
fications — all with a few keystrokes. They also can enter order-status
information, which can be accessed by marketing, finance, and any other
departments within the organization.
 Data mobilization: Electronic data interchange, better known as EDI,
lets you move highly graphical data between remote sites virtually in
real time. This technology is important for companies that outsource
some capabilities (see the following section). If your designers are in
319
Chapter 18: Manufacturing and Distribution: It’s a Brave New World

New York and your manufacturing plant is in Texas, you can easily trans-
fer designs and modify them in seconds with EDI technology. EDI also
enables manufacturers to link up with distributors and retailers so that
reorders are triggered electronically. For example, if you’re a manufac-
turer that produces items for Wal-Mart to sell, you need to be linked to
Wal-Mart’s EDI system so that you can be notified of reorder status.
Outsourcing: The “make 
versus buy” decision
When you partner with another company that will handle certain aspects of
your business, it’s called outsourcing. Would it surprise you to discover that
outsourcing has been around about as long as corporations have been? The
difference today is that outsourcing is taking place on a global scale.
When you look at the up-front cost of investing in a plant, office, and equip-
ment to run a manufacturing operation, you quickly understand why so many
companies look to outsourcing as a way to survive and compete. But out-
sourcing isn’t only about saving money (see Chapter 4).
Not all products are suited for offshore manufacturing. If production of your
product requires highly technical equipment and technical people to super-
vise the production (many biotech products), or the product is very heavy (a
road grading machine, for example) with a large footprint, you may not save
enough money to make up for the problems you’ll encounter when you go off-
shore. These problems include communication, quality control, transporta-
tion issues, cultural issues, and tariffs, to name just a few (you can find more
details in Chapter 4).
To have a chance to achieve outsourcing success with the right product,
consider these tips:
 Start small (a small market or one product) and learn before trying to
do too much overseas. Developing an overseas technical workforce that
really understands your business and industry takes time, so start small
and grow carefully.
 Place someone from your company “in-country” to supervise your
operations until you find a local partner you can trust. You need some-
one who’s familiar with local culture and business methods.
 Create a culture that enables employee development. Be prepared for
high turnover in the workforce you hire. Overseas workers are looking
to move up and learn new things, so you need programs that enable
them to grow so they won’t leave your company to find what they need
somewhere else.
320
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

 Only outsource activities that have a high probability of success and
that will run smoothly in the overseas environment. Generally, these
are straightforward production and assembly activities where what
needs to happen is very clear. Activities that are associated with many
problems or are complex — require special technical skills, in other
words — should be kept at home.
However, in some industries, it’s still possible to manufacture within the
United States, as long as the company has developed efficient processes and
taken advantage of manufacturing and operations technology. For example,
the Sanmina-SCI facility in Rapid City, South Dakota, competes favorably on a
cost basis with plants in China in the fabrication of circuit boards and inte-
grated systems. It does so by providing end-to-end manufacturing capability
for companies such as Motorola.
Purchasing: When, Where, 
and How Much
When you’re talking about purchasing raw materials or goods for resale, you
need to consider three very important factors:
 Quality: We define quality materials as those that meet the company’s
specific requirements, which means that level of quality will be different
for every company. Quality normally depends on customer needs, so
your market research with the customer will be important to the deci-
sions you make about product quality.
 Quantity: Quantity purchased always depends on demand by the cus-
tomer and your ability to manufacture to meet that demand — based on
your plant, equipment, labor and so forth. Most manufacturers today
take a just-in-time approach to quantity purchased so that they don’t
have to maintain costly inventories of raw materials.
 Timing: Timing is about making sure that your plant, equipment, and
labor are being used to their full capacity, and that space, like a ware-
house, is used only when necessary.
Successful management of quality, quantity, and timing are critical to an effec-
tive manufacturing process. This means that you need to find vendors who
are willing to work with you to meet your production needs. Choosing a
vendor, therefore, is an important decision that will take some time and effort
on your part.
One of the first few questions to answer about vendors is whether to use one
vendor or multiple vendors for each of the components or materials you
require. Getting your materials from more than one source offers an important
321
Chapter 18: Manufacturing and Distribution: It’s a Brave New World

advantage. If, for instance, something happens to your supplier, you have a
backup. But you also have a couple good reasons to use a single vendor for
materials:
 You’ll probably get better service and attention.
 The vendor may combine your order with those of other companies so
that you can benefit from a volume purchase.
Here’s a simple rule to follow: Use one supplier for about 70 to 80 percent of
your materials needs, and use one or more vendors to supply the rest. That
way you get the best of both worlds. When the time comes to select among a
list of vendors, here are some questions to ask the candidates:
 Can the vendor deliver what you need, when you need it?
 If you use this vendor, what will your freight costs be?
 What kinds of services does the vendor offer?
 How well does the vendor know the product line it’s selling you? Can a
representative answer all your questions to your satisfaction?
 What kinds of guarantees will the vendor supply, and what are the
vendor’s maintenance and return policies?
We encourage you to check out vendors carefully. Compare prices, because
we’ve seen prices on simple things, such as a bolt, range from a few cents to
more than a dollar. If you stay on top of various vendors’ pricing (the Internet
makes it easy to do that), you’ll put yourself in a stronger position to negoti-
ate a new deal with your vendor when the time comes to do so.
Managing Materials and 
Scheduling Production
Materials management and scheduling are very important parts of manufac-
turing. The goal today is to have the raw materials you need when you need
them — not before, not after, but right when you need them — hence the
term just-in-time. The benefits of just-in-time are many:
 You can improve your cycle and delivery times.
 You use material only when it’s needed.
 You can reduce inventory, thereby reducing space needs.
 You can increase labor productivity.
 You can improve quality.
322
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

If you’re considering implementing JIT for your manufacturing process, make
sure you have the primary components in place:
 You know your customers. Know what their requirements are, because
they determine the time to delivery and the actual production process
(see Chapter 15).
 You have a well-timed production process. Set up your production so
that at each point along the line you’re completing a task and that each
task takes about the same length of time, which eliminates waiting.
 You involve your supplier. Make your supplier a central part of the process
so that you don’t need to warehouse materials — your supplier can do
the warehousing and get materials to you exactly when you need them.
 You have access to tracking technology. Use the latest in tracking tech-
nology so you know where all your raw materials are and where your
products are in the process.
Even with just-in-time purchasing and materials management, you will no
doubt have some inventory of goods on hand that are used for manufacturing
your product or used for sale as finished products. In this section, you find
out how to manage inventory to keep costs down.
Grasping the importance of inventory
Inventory consists of materials and goods that you hold for manufacture or
resale. Every business has inventory of one type or another, because you need
to be able to meet customer demand in a timely fashion. Still, inventory is a
costly thing to maintain, so you have to create a balance — between raw mate-
rials, work in progress, and finished goods — so as not to have inventory that
you have to hold (resulting in a negative impact on cash flow). The following
sections look at some of the costs of inventory and how you track inventory to
save time and money.
The hidden costs of inventory
Many business owners don’t realize that the hidden costs of inventory can
amount to as much as 25 percent of the base cost of the inventory. That’s a
substantial amount. What are some of these hidden costs?
 Financing cost: The interest paid on money borrowed to purchase the
inventory. Most businesses can’t afford to pay cash for inventory, so they
finance it. This is an expensive way to do business, but it’s a fact of life.
 Insurance costs: The cost of protecting the inventory from fire, damage,
or theft.
323
Chapter 18: Manufacturing and Distribution: It’s a Brave New World

 Obsolescence: The cost of an inventory that’s no longer marketable or
usable — in other words, nobody wants to buy it.
 Opportunity cost: The loss of use of the money that’s tied up in inventory.
Do everything possible to reduce these hidden costs. In the section
“Purchasing: When, What, and How Much” we talk about just-in-time purchas-
ing, which will help reduce inventory costs. But another way you can manage
inventory is by tracking it.
Tracking inventory
Companies can save a lot of money by carefully tracking inventory and main-
taining the smallest inventory possible to meet demand. Keeping track of
inventory has really been helped by technology — specifically bar-coding and
RFID technology. When your company is new, tracking inventory isn’t a big
problem, because all you do is count it manually. But after your business grows,
a manual system becomes cumbersome, lengthy, and prone to error. For these
reasons, you need to consider the following three methods of tracking inventory:
 Perpetual inventory system: These systems are based on keeping a
running count of items used or sold via an electronic point-of-sale device
(which you’ve probably seen in your local grocery store). As materials
are purchased, workers scan their bar codes or RFID tag info into the
system, and the materials are deducted from the inventory. With 
this system, you have immediate access to the status of your inventory.
 Physical count system: You probably won’t physically count your inven-
tory after you grow a sizeable business. But most businesses still do
some physical counting to check for errors in their electronic systems.
Of course, to make the physical counting manageable, you need to get
your inventory down as low as possible (which is where JIT comes in).
 A combined inventory system: Some companies use a combined system
of perpetual and physical count. They do physical counts on less popular
items that they carry in small quantities, and they use a perpetual system
for the majority of their items.
To purchase and manage inventory effectively, you need to have a good handle
on your manufacturing process. For that, scheduling is a critical function, and
we discuss it next.
Making wise management decisions 
with a Gantt chart
Scheduling is the process of identifying and ordering all the production tasks
in a manufacturing process. In Figure 18-1, you see a simple Gantt chart, which
is one method you can use to lay out the scheduling of production tasks and
the timing for each task. It’s very easy to create, using the following tools:
324
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

 List each task in the vertical column.
 Note the time required to complete each task in the horizontal row.
 Input a solid line to denote the planned task completion time.
 Input a dashed line to indicate the actual progress of the task.
Your best bet is to use Gantt charts for simple projects, where the tasks
involved are independent of each other. In this figure, the manufacturer is
producing three different orders going to three different customers. Graphing
the actual status of the order against the forecasted schedule makes it easy
to see how these orders are progressing.
Scheduling with a PERT chart
PERT charts (Program Evaluation and Review Technique charts) are more
complex scheduling tools that a company should use when the production
tasks involved are interdependent. What this means is that they operate paral-
lel to one another or in sequence in such a way that you can’t start or end
one task until another is completed. Figure 18-2 provides a simple example of
a PERT diagram.

Chapter 18: Manufacturing and Distribution: It’s a Brave New World

The two questions that you want to answer by doing a PERT diagram are
 What’s the shortest time to project completion?
 Which activities do you have to complete on time to be able to finish in
the shortest time possible (the critical path)?
In the diagram in Figure 18-2, you see the critical path highlighted. The num-
bers indicate the number of days it takes to complete a particular task. This
company indicates a critical path of 25 days, which is the latest completion
time if all the dependent activities are completed on time. Any delay in activi-
ties along the critical path will delay the completion of the project.
Here are the steps to execute PERT planning:
1. Identify the activities you must accomplish to complete the project
(such things as brainstorming, design, prototyping, and so forth).
2. Figure the time it will take to complete each activity.
3. Figure out which activities depend on which other activities.
For example, before you can build a prototype of a product, you need to
have a design specifying how to build the prototype. So the prototype
activity is dependent on a completed design.
4. For each activity that depends on another activity, (A depends on B,
for example) determine if
• A can get started before B is complete.
• A can start at the same time B starts.
• A must wait until B is finished to start.
5. Lay out your activities and their dependencies in a network diagram
(you can do this with a paper and pencil or use your computer).
You won’t get it perfect the first time. That’s why a computer is handy —
it’s easy to move things around and make changes to your diagram.
6. Identify the critical path.
It is based on identifying the earliest and latest start and end times for
each activity. This is a complex formula that we can’t get into here, but
you can access plenty of software to assist you with the calculations,
such as Microsoft Project, Merlin, and activeCollab (an open-source
web-based application). Just enter the data on your project and it will do
all the work for you!
7. Monitor and update the chart as the project moves forward.
As with any planning, new information means you need to revisit your
plan and make adjustments.

Part V: Other Important Stuff 

Production: Building the Product
Production is a vital part of a manufacturing business. The quickest and most
cost-effective way to increase your bottom line if you’re a manufacturer is to
reduce your costs of production by becoming more efficient. Manufacturers
today plan the production process around what’s called single-unit build,
which is building one unit at a time serially in manufacturing cells. This
process means that a product goes through a series of tasks and operations
in a continuous flow while remaining inside the manufacturing cell.
Successfully setting up an effective continuous-flow manufacturing process
requires several steps:
1. Work with your suppliers to set up a just-in-time (JIT) system (see the
earlier section “Managing Materials and Scheduling Production”).
This system makes sure that your supplies arrive when you’re ready to
use them so that you don’t have to store raw materials, which is costly.
2. Cross-train your employees in a variety of tasks.
You want employees with more flexibility who can move to different
tasks as needed.
3. Reduce the setup time from hours to minutes.
This is the time it takes to get the right equipment ready for a particular
product.
4. Design your manufacturing plant at the same time you’re doing product
development.
This ensures that the plant flow from one task to another is smooth.
Quality: It Isn’t Right Until It’s Right
When it comes to products, quality doesn’t mean “best;” it means best as
defined by the customer’s requirements for features, benefits, and price (see
Chapter 15).
To make sure your products reflect the quality level that customers expect,
you must align your management, business, and support processes:
 Management processes shape the direction of the company, so they
consist of vision, values, goals, strategy, and tactics. (Refer to Chapter 5
if you need a review of these topics.)
 Business processes, or operational processes, are all the mission-critical
activities of the organization — such as new product development,
manufacturing, distribution, and so on.
327
Chapter 18: Manufacturing and Distribution: It’s a Brave New World

 Support processes are the activities that sustain the company, such as
payroll, human resources, and accounting.
This section helps you make decisions about how to manage quality as you
carry out your business processes.
Build quality into your processes
Different manufacturers have different points of view on how to monitor quality
during the production process. One point of view — the traditional way —
believes that you should inspect the product at the end of the process.
However, with this method, you have to go back through all the stages post-
defect to find any issues, which can really slow down the process. More and
more companies monitor and inspect at several stages (or every stage)
throughout the process. This way, you can catch the defect early, before your
product is finished.
So, how do you choose which quality method is right for you? We make it
easy for you. Do what modern manufacturing plants are doing: Build inspec-
tion into your processes. Don’t wait until the end!
In cases where inspection will destroy the product — for example, a food
product — it’s better to inspect by taking a random sample. Makes sense —
you don’t want to eat all your products, especially if the food products you
produce are meant for dogs and cats!
ISO 9000: Passing the ultimate test
For today’s global business world (see Chapter 4), the International
Organization for Standardization, in Geneva, Switzerland, has developed
some international quality standards. These standards — in the form called
ISO 9000 — make it easier for a product to be sold in the international mar-
ketplace. They do so through a series of quality standards and a certification
process. The standards are now accepted by more than 157 countries. But to
even begin to meet ISO requirements, you need to develop a quality-manage-
ment system. To read more about the details of ISO 9000, check out the Web
site www.iso9000conference.com/index.htm. You also can look at
Quality Control For Dummies, by Larry Webber and Michael Wallace (Wiley).
Other quality measurements
As with almost every other topic in business, quality has its own buzzwords
and trendy ways of measuring and controlling for quality. Some of them have
been around a long time — they’ve just been given a facelift and a new title.
328
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

We don’t have space to go into all of these methods, but we list a few of the
most common and give you a reference for where to find more info:
 Six Sigma: Motorola originally developed and trademarked this set of
practices for eliminating defects below 3.4 defects per million opportuni-
ties. Today Six Sigma incorporates many quality improvement methods
from years of practice including Total Quality Management (TQM),
quality control, and zero defects. (Check out Six Sigma For Dummies by
Craig Gygi, Neil DeCarlo, Bruce Williams, and Stephen R. Covey [Wiley].)
 Kaizen or Lean Manufacturing: This is a Japanese word for “improvement.”
In the quality world, this approach is about continuous improvement in
the workplace and has been associated with Toyota’s production system
and the work of quality guru W. Edwards Deming. The goal of this
approach is to eliminate waste or activities that don’t add value to the
process. (Check out LEAN For Dummies by Natalie J. Sayer and Bruce
Williams [Wiley].)
 Seven Tools of Quality: Quality engineers have figured out that you can
solve most quality problems with just seven quantitative tools. Check
the American Society for Quality at www.asq.org/learn-about-
quality/seven-basic-quality-tools/overview/overview.
html for more on these seven tools.
 Balanced Scorecard: This is a management tool that simply guides you
through the process of developing metrics to set performance targets
and measure four areas of your business: financial, customer, business
processes, and learning and growth. (Check out Balanced Scorecard For
Dummies by Charles Hannabarger, Frederick Buchman, and Peter
Economy [Wiley].)
Process/Equipment Maintenance:
Keeping the System Running Smoothly
In manufacturing, maintenance refers to the care and feeding of the processes
and equipment used to produce a product and also to after-sales service with
the customer. The following sections give you some ideas for how to take
care of the investment you’ve made in your production processes.
Maintaining processes and equipment
No matter how careful you are, every machine will break down eventually,
which means not only costly repairs, but also a potential loss of sales from the
downtime. So, what can you do to handle plant and equipment maintenance?
You basically have four choices:
329
Chapter 18: Manufacturing and Distribution: It’s a Brave New World

 Undertake a program of preventive maintenance. We highly recom-
mend this program, in which you regularly check and fix machines
before they break down. With this method, you can control when your
downtime happens and schedule it for a slow season.
 Have backup machines waiting. Modern manufacturing facilities typically
organize their equipment so that if one machine goes down, they can
shift the work to another. If production is the life blood of your business,
the cost of maintaining backup equipment, or equipment that isn’t used
full time, is simply a cost of doing business.
 Build up inventories at every stage of the production process. That
way at least part of the process can continue if something breaks down.
However, this method doesn’t work well if you’re using a JIT system. It’s
probably a good choice, though, for a small manufacturer that doesn’t
have the strong supply chain relationships required for a JIT system.
 Maintain equipment during downtime. You may have noticed that most
Internet companies now schedule downtime to maintain their servers,
and they warn their customers about that downtime in advance. They
usually choose a time in the middle of the night or during the lowest
access time in the day to avoid frustrating their customers and potentially
losing business.
Designing an after-sale service 
and warranty program
Most companies provide some form of warranty with the products and ser-
vices they sell. They provide this after-sale service to protect themselves
from liability and, more importantly, to demonstrate that they stand behind
what they produce.
Warranties come in all shapes and sizes and depend on your business and
industry, but here are a few guidelines you can follow when designing your
warranty program:
 Check standard warranties in your industry to determine the appropriate
length.
 Determine which components of the product, or which aspects of the
service, you want to cover.
 If you have components made by other manufacturers, secure pass-
through warranties from them to ensure that you don’t invalidate their
warranties inadvertently. A pass-through warranty means that the original
manufacturer takes care of any problems or service required.
330
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

 Plan to have customers conveniently return the product to you or your dis-
tributors if necessary rather than to the maker of a particular component.
 Plan for how you’ll educate your customers about your warranty policies
and services. Whatever you do, make the policy easy for the customer to
understand and the services clear about what the customer should do in
case of a warranty problem.
Today’s product laws state that any product is covered by warranty from the
minute it hits the customer’s hands, whether or not the customer returns a
postcard stating when and where the product was purchased.
Distribution and Logistics: 
A Great Way to Compete
Distribution comprises all the ways that you move your product to your cus-
tomers — distributors, retailers, and the Internet, to name a few options.
Logistics, by contrast, is the management of goods, information, and services
from the point of origin to the market — for example, transporting the manu-
factured product to the customer via some mode of transportation, such as a
truck. Logistics includes transportation, inventory, warehousing, materials
handling, and packaging. The rise of the Internet and global supply chains
has led to new distribution and logistics strategies that are more compatible
with the fast-changing marketplace. This section looks at some of the major
changes in strategy today.
Eyeing some new distribution strategies
Technology once again has provided new solutions to old problems, opening
the door to great opportunities to innovate in distribution, but technology
isn’t the only source of innovation in distribution. Companies are finding all
sorts of ways to deliver benefits to customers.
The following list presents four changes taking place right now in distribution:
 Companies are moving along the value chain. The value chain is really
the distribution channel, but you should recognize that at all points
along the channel, value is added to the product. Today, companies are
taking over activities in their value chains, either upstream from them or
downstream.
 Companies are shifting to bundled solutions rather than individual
products. A manufacturer may now bundle distribution, support, and
information with its product for a package price.
331
Chapter 18: Manufacturing and Distribution: It’s a Brave New World

 New classes of customers are appearing. Traditionally, only big companies
could access production tools for developing things such as commercials.
No more. Today, production tool producers are marketing to small companies
and individuals at prices they can afford. Look at all the people developing
their own commercials and posting them on YouTube. Do these YouTube
“customers” have product and service needs? You betcha!
 Everything old is new again. Many years ago, who would have thought
that a company would come along and give coffee a whole new life and a
new distribution channel? Starbucks did so by making the process of
drinking coffee an experience. That new value, added to a very simple,
existing product, enabled the company to seek out new customers and
charge higher-than-normal prices for its coffee.
So, how do you choose a distribution strategy for your company? You con-
sider what will make your customers happy — it’s as simple as that! Here are
some things to think about when choosing the most effective channel to
deliver your benefits to the customer:
 Cost: Cost includes everything that relates to marketing and distributing
the product to your customer.
 Market coverage: With some products, such as the Apple iPhone or a new
beverage, it’s important to reach as many customers as possible as fast as
possible. Trying to accomplish this yourself may be an impossible task, so
you need to use intermediaries (wholesalers, distributors, retailers, and
so on). Selling to just three distributors can give you the potential to
access hundreds of retailers.
 How much control you need: If you have a product that requires a lot of
education or unusual marketing tactics to get sales, such as a new medical
device, you don’t want to choose an intermediary that carries competing
products. You may need to use a direct channel, such as the Internet, to
control the information flow to the customer.
 Speed and reliability: Today’s customers expect products right now! If
your customers are like that, you need to find a distribution channel that
puts the customers in control of the speed with which they receive the
product.
Nailing down logistics: Head ’em 
up and move ’em out
When you just need to move product and you don’t know the best way to do
it, you need to contact a logistics firm. Logistics is about controlling the flow
of goods and resources from the source of production to the marketplace.
When you contact a logistics firm, you’ll find out that it can do a whole lot
332
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

more than just find you the right truck, train, ship, or plane to ship your
cargo, as well as negotiate the best prices. It can also package, warehouse,
and manage inventory. In fact, many firms today are choosing to outsource
these specialized tasks to professionals.
For example, large companies such as Wal-Mart are requiring even small sup-
pliers to meet their rigorous standards for packing, shipping, and tagging for
RFID tracking (see the first section in this chapter). Because many small com-
panies don’t have the resources to meet these requirements, they outsource
to third-party logistics companies (such as UPS Supply Chain Solutions).
We suggest you focus on what you do best and leave the rest to someone
who can do it better. Check with others in your industry to get recommenda-
tions for the best logistics firms.

M
ost people are optimists. Sure, plenty of businesses fail every year, but
few entrepreneurs honestly think that their businesses will be among the
scores of also-rans. Natural disasters — earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes,
floods — happen, but they certainly won’t happen to my business! And even if
they do, the company will be just fine, thank you. Robbery, Internet attacks on
computers, arson, embezzlement, fraud — these crimes are happening all over
the world, but that doesn’t mean my business is at risk. Somehow, most business
people like to think that they’ll be untouched by business disaster year after
year, with their customers, businesses, and investments intact.
Unfortunately, the world is a risky place, and bad things really do happen to
even the most well-prepared, good-hearted, and competent businesspeople.
This is a post-9/11 world, where the very real threat of terrorism has added an
additional layer of risk to all the ones people have traditionally experienced.
The question isn’t, “Will something bad happen to my business?” Instead, the
question is, “Will I be prepared when something bad happens to my business?”
This chapter is all about business risk and how to manage it. You find out how 
to develop and implement a winning risk management process, as well as how to
identify and act on potential vulnerabilities. You discover the many kinds of
insurance available to businesses today, and you see how to train your
employees to avoid or even eliminate risk altogether. Finally, you get some
advice on how to monitor the latest high-tech computer risks — the Internet-
and e-mail-imposed risks that can cost you your business in the blink of an eye.

The 4-1-1 on Risk Management
The key to dealing with risk — whether in the form of natural disaster, theft,
property damage, personal injury, and so on — is to anticipate it and have a
plan in place for dealing with it. Risk management is the process of under-
standing and anticipating risks and then taking steps to minimize its impact
on a business and the people within it.
Here are the four basic steps for managing risk:
1. Identify potential risks.
The possibilities for loss are almost endless. What types of risk is your
business exposed to?
2. Assess and prioritize potential risks.
If your business is located in Miami or New Orleans, chances are you
won’t have to worry about earthquakes. You should, however, prioritize
the purchase of insurance in the event of a hurricane or flood.
3. Select the right risk management tools to deal with each potential risk.
Develop a risk management process (your overall approach to managing
risk) and plan (a document that spells out a set course of action to miti-
gate or respond to specific risks) that features specific strategies for
dealing with risk in your business. In some cases, prevention is the right
course of action. In other cases, employee training may do the trick.
Sometimes, you can simply buy insurance to cover your risk. We explore
some of the different risk management tools available to you later in this
chapter, in the section “Purchasing Insurance to Shift the Risk.”
4. Evaluate the results of your risk management strategies and revise or
renew them as appropriate.
Periodically revisit your risk management process, strategies, and plans
to ensure that they’re providing the desired protection to your business.
If they are, terrific — keep on doing what you’re doing. If they aren’t, how-
ever, don’t hesitate to adjust your strategies or plans where necessary.
If you follow these four steps for managing risk in your business, you’ll be way
ahead of the game if the “unthinkable” occurs. And, unfortunately, tragedies
happen to businesses just like yours more often than you can possibly imagine.

Managing Risk (Before It Manages You)
You can — and should — manage risk to protect your company. In fact, many
insurers make the development of a risk management process or plan a
condition of granting insurance coverage. No risk management process can
prevent every possible setback from occurring, but a good risk management
process can minimize the financial loss your business will suffer, as well as
help prevent injuries and death.
You can take precautions in case something bad does happen, and this section
gives you some pointers — including how to create a risk management process,
how to determine what risks you’re vulnerable to, and how to take action.
Developing a risk management process
A formal risk management process greatly reduces your company’s exposure
to risks and undoubtedly saves your organization time, money, and loss of
employee productivity. Creating a risk management process requires the
concerted effort of one or more employees during an extended period of time.
These employees include top management as well as individuals tasked with
leading the risk management process. Here are seven steps for developing a
risk management process that really works:
1. Get the commitment of top management.
To create a risk management program that will work over the long haul,
you must have the support of top management. An explanation of the
potential risks to the company of ignoring this vital process — supported
with hard facts and figures — will generally be enough to gain the
support of even the most reluctant manager.
2. Assign one person to lead your company’s risk management efforts.
One person should have ultimate responsibility for your organization’s
risk management process. Such a policy ensures accountability and pre-
vents finger pointing if something goes wrong and the business isn’t pre-
pared for such an event. This individual will be in charge of leading and
implementing the steps that follow.
3. Establish a risk control committee.
Employees can participate in the risk management process by helping to
identify risks and by taking actions to minimize their potential impact on
your organization. The committee should also track risk and employee
injury trends and take action to reduce risks and injuries. Make sure that
the committee includes a broad cross-section of employees from all
levels and all parts of the organization.
337
Chapter 19: The Ins and Outs of Risk Management

4. Create an emergency action plan.
If the unthinkable — a fire, an explosion, a natural disaster, a terrorist
attack — happens, will all your employees know exactly what to do and
where to go to protect themselves and your organization’s property
from damage or destruction? An emergency action plan ensures that
they will.
5. Establish a formal self-inspection program.
Is your workplace safe? Are you sure? A self-inspection program should
identify potential safety hazards and take action to make repairs or cor-
rections. Conduct a vulnerability analysis (see the next section for
details), and use members of your risk control committee to conduct
inspections throughout your organization.
6. Establish an accident and safety incident-investigation program.
The most well-protected organizations learn from accidents and incidents,
and they use this information to help prevent future accidents and inci-
dents. Appoint someone in your organization to investigate every accident
and safety incident to determine what lessons you can learn from the
mishaps.
7. Develop a training and education program.
Train and educate your employees to identify hazards, prevent injuries — to
themselves and to others — and respond appropriately in case of emergency
or disaster.
The previous steps are the basics of establishing a strong foundation of risk
management in your organization. You may wish to do even more. You may
want to tap into the expertise of consultants who specialize in risk management
as you go through the process. Whatever you decide to do, don’t forget that
sufficient foresight and planning can help prevent losses and reduce risks.
Conducting a vulnerability analysis
Before you can effectively manage the risks that your organization is or will
be exposed to, you need to understand the specific risks you’re up against.
The goal of vulnerability analysis is to assess the probability and potential
impact of the different risks that you identify.
Use the Vulnerability Analysis Chart (Figure 19-1) to score your organization —
the lower your score, the better. If you identify risks with a high score, give
them a high priority in your organization and address those risks immediately —
if you haven’t already taken care of them. Make the following steps, adapted
from processes developed by the Federal Emergency Management
Administration (FEMA), a part of your vulnerability analysis.
338
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

Step 1: List potential risks
In the first column of the chart, list all the potential risks that could affect
your facility and the people in it. Be sure to consider risks that could occur in
your facility or within your community. Bring your risk control committee
into the process to help ensure all possible risks are brought to light.
As you consider the different risks that could possibly occur, think in terms
of the following potential areas of risk:
 Human error: What potential employee error-driven risks are your
business exposed to? Are your employees trained to work safely? Do they
know what to do in an emergency? Consider potential risks as a result of
• Poor training
• Poor maintenance
• Carelessness
• Misconduct
• Substance abuse
• Fatigue

Chapter 19: The Ins and Outs of Risk Management

 Business: What kinds of risks does your organization face that are
uniquely business risks? The risks that a business faces can be quite dif-
ferent from the risks that an individual faces. Consider potential risks as
a result of
• Malpractice
• Embezzlement
• Product liability
• Fraud
• Loss of key person
• Errors and omissions
• Construction defects
• Worker injury and death
• Nonperformance
 Historical: What types of risks have your community, your facility, and
other business facilities in your area faced in the past? Consider poten-
tial risks as a result of
• Fires
• Severe weather
• Hazardous material spills
• Transportation accidents
• Earthquakes
• Hurricanes
• Tornadoes
• Terrorism
• Utility outages
 Geographic: What can happen as a result of your facility’s geographic
location? Consider potential risks as a result of
• Your proximity to flood plains, seismic faults, and dams
• Your proximity to companies that produce, store, use, or transport
hazardous materials
• Your proximity to major transportation routes and airports
• Your proximity to nuclear power plants
 Technological: What could happen if you experience a process or
system failure? Consider potential risks as a result of
• Fire, explosion, or hazardous materials incident
• Safety system failure
340
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

• Telecommunications failure
• Computer system failure
• Power failure
• Heating or cooling system failure
• Emergency notification system failure
 Physical: What types of risks does the design or construction of the
facility pose? Does the physical facility enhance safety or detract from
it? Consider potential risks as a result of
• The physical construction of the facility
• Hazardous processes or byproducts
• Facilities for storing combustibles
• Layout of equipment
• Lighting
• Evacuation routes and exits
• Proximity of shelter areas
Step 2: Estimate the probability of the risks
In the Probability column of the chart, rate the likelihood of each risk’s occur-
rence by using a simple scale of 1 to 5 — with 1 as the lowest probability and
5 as the highest. You need to rely on your own experience — and the experi-
ence of others in your company or industry — to develop reasonably accu-
rate numbers. If your business is located in Kansas, for example, you know
that the risk of a tornado probably rates a 4 or 5.
Step 3: Assess the potential human impact
Analyze the potential human impact of each potential risk — the possibility of
death or injury, in other words. Assign a rating in the Human Impact column of
the chart by using a 1 to 5 scale — with 1 as the lowest impact and 5 as the
highest. Again, draw on your experience, or on the experience of others in
your company or industry to develop reasonably accurate numbers.
Step 4: Assess the potential property impact
In the Property Impact column of the chart, consider the potential for property
losses and damage. Assign a rating by using a 1 to 5 scale — with 1 being the
lowest impact and 5 being the highest. Consider potential risks in terms of
 Cost to replace
 Cost to set up temporary replacement
 Cost to repair
341
Chapter 19: The Ins and Outs of Risk Management

For example, although a utility outage will likely have a low probability of
property loss or damage — perhaps a 1 or 2 — a terrorist attack resulting in
physical damage would score higher, perhaps a 4 or 5.
Step 5: Assess the potential business impact
Consider the potential loss of market share due to the potential risks you
identify. Assign a rating in the Business Impact column by using a 1 to 5 scale —
with 1 being the lowest impact and 5 being the highest. Consider potential
risks in terms of
 Business interruption
 Employees who can’t report to work
 Customers who can’t reach your facility
 Company in violation of contractual agreements
 Imposition of fines and penalties or legal costs
 Interruption of receipt of critical supplies
 Interruption of product distribution
For example, an earthquake could potentially result in your offices being
made off-limits by authorities for days, weeks, or even months, creating a
major and potentially long-lasting business interruption.
Step 6: Assess internal and external resources
Assess your company’s resources and your ability to respond to situations.
Assign a score to your Internal Resources and External Resources by using a
1 to 5 scale — with 1 representing a lack of resources to respond and 5
representing more than sufficient resources to respond.
To perform this evaluation, consider each potential risk from beginning to
end and evaluate each resource that you need to respond. For each risk, ask
these questions:
 Do we have the needed resources and capabilities to respond?
 Will our external resources be able to respond to us in adverse times as
quickly as we may need them, or will they have other priority areas to
serve?
If the answers are yes, you can move on to the next assessment. If the answers
are no, identify what you can do to correct the problem. For example, you may
need to
 Develop additional risk management procedures
 Conduct additional training
342
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

 Acquire additional equipment
 Establish mutual aid agreements
 Establish agreements with specialized contractors
Step 7: Add the columns
Total the scores you’ve rated for each potential risk. The lower your score,
the better. Risks with a high score should be given a high priority in your
organization and addressed immediately. Although this is a subjective rating
exercise, the comparisons help determine your risk planning and resource
priorities.
Taking action
After you’ve assessed your potential risks and prioritized them by their
urgency and potential impact, you need to take action to reduce them or
eliminate them entirely. Consider four basic strategies when selecting your
risk management tools; keep them in mind as you decide what strategies
you’ll pursue to reach your risk management goals:
 Shift the risk. One way of dealing with the risk of loss is to shift the risk
to someone else. When you buy an insurance policy, you shift the risk to
the insurance company. When you draft contracts with subcontractors
that require them to carry liability insurance, you shift the risk to your
subcontractors and their insurance companies. (For more information,
turn to the section “Purchasing Insurance to Shift the Risk” later in this
chapter.)
 Avoid the risk. By identifying and correcting hazardous situations —
say, for example, by repairing the brakes on a company delivery truck —
you can avoid potential risks altogether.
 Reduce the risk. Although you can’t entirely avoid some risks, you can
reduce them. For instance, training your employees in the proper tech-
niques for lifting heavy objects substantially reduces the incidence of
back injuries, which result in lost productivity. (For more on employee
training, see the later section “Training Employees to Minimize Risk.”)
 Assume the risk. In some cases, an organization may decide to bear the
financial burden of a risk. By self-insuring for workers’ compensation
claims, for example, or by paying higher deductibles on insurance poli-
cies, an organization assumes all or part of a risk of loss. This course of
action should be taken only after a very careful assessment of the risk,
along with a detailed cost/benefit study.
343
Chapter 19: The Ins and Outs of Risk Management

Whatever you do to address risks, do something! After you’ve determined that
a potential risk of injury or loss exists, you have to take action by shifting,
avoiding, reducing, or assuming the risk. Don’t waste time hoping that the risk
will go away if you just ignore it. It won’t.
Purchasing Insurance to Shift the Risk
When you buy insurance for your business, you shift the risk of loss to a third
party — in this case an insurance company. The insurance company essentially
is betting that you won’t suffer a loss due to the risk. It hedges its bet by
collecting a sufficiently high premium — at rates based on the statistical
predictions of actuaries, people who specialize in the mathematics of risk — to
make money off your business even if you do suffer a loss at some point down
the road.
Here are the most important and common kinds of insurance to consider
buying (and maintaining) for your business:
 Liability: If someone is injured or has property damaged or destroyed
while on your premises or while using your product or service, your orga-
nization may be sued for millions of dollars in damages. Liability insurance
protects your organization from these kinds of financial losses. If you lease
your office or manufacturing space, your landlord probably requires you
to carry a certain amount of liability insurance for protection.
 Property: Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and tornadoes
wreak billions of dollars worth of property damage every year. But an
estimated 70 percent of all business-property losses happen not as a
result of natural disasters, but because of employee negligence, errors,
or lack of planning. Property insurance generally covers the risk of prop-
erty loss due to fire, smoke, wind, and other sources of damage or
destruction.
 Business interruption: If property damage or another situation forces your
business to close until you can repair or rebuild your facility, business
interruption insurance covers you for the risk of lost sales.
 Technology risk: Most businesses today have information technology
exposure to their business operations. Companies are at risk from invasion
by electronic intruders, whether the damage occurs on an external Web
site or an internal Intranet, a company network. Cyberinsurance describes a
group of insurance policies that protect a company against losses from
hacked computers, virus attacks, copyright infringement, Web content
liability, and other technology-related risks.
344
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

 Environmental: If your business has anything to do with construction,
landfills, underground storage tanks, chemical production, recycling facil-
ities, maintenance facilities, or anything else that may have or come into
contact with a negative environmental impact, environmental insurance —
designed to protect your company if it’s found responsible for damaging the
environment — is right up your alley.
 Malpractice: Also known as errors and omissions (E&O) or professional
liability insurance, business malpractice insurance covers professionals
who give advice during the normal course of business. Doctors, lawyers,
consultants, accountants, and stockbrokers are among those who need
malpractice insurance in case their clients are injured — physically,
financially, or emotionally — as a result of their work. Errors and omis-
sions insurance have received much greater attention as a result of the
financial misdeeds of Enron, Tyco, and other companies similar to them.
 Fidelity bond: This is a specialized, but widely used form of insurance
that protects employers from theft, larceny, or embezzlement committed
by covered employees.
 Ocean marine: The oldest form of insurance in existence, ocean marine
insurance covers four key areas pertaining to transporting goods via
ship: the vessel or hull, the cargo, earnings (such as freight, passage
money, commissions, or profit), and liability (also known as protection
and indemnity).
 Key person: Smaller businesses that depend on one person — perhaps
the founder or chief executive — to lead the organizations and bring in
business usually carry key person insurance. In the event of this person’s
death or incapacitation, key person coverage pays a fixed amount to the
business — much as a life-insurance policy pays a fixed amount of money
to a surviving spouse or other beneficiary.
Other, more-specialized forms of insurance — including terrorism insurance
(which, by the way, is very difficult to obtain) — may be appropriate for your
situation. If you’re not an expert in the insurance industry, hire someone who
is or find a qualified insurance broker who can explain and recommend differ-
ent kinds of insurance for your business to purchase, as well as how much
coverage to buy. A reputable broker should be able to search the insurance
market for you to get the best coverage at the best prices — definitely a win-
win situation. For more information on insurance and risk, be sure to visit the
ISO Web site at www.iso.com. Also, be sure to take a look at Insurance For
Dummies by Jack Hungelmann (Wiley).

Chapter 19: The Ins and Outs of Risk Management

Training Employees to Minimize Risk
Employees are some of the most powerful tools in the toolbox of any com-
pany that’s looking to reduce its risk of loss. Employees can not only proac-
tively identify and cure potential risks (refer to the section “Conducting a
vulnerability analysis”), but also can train others to do the same. The result
is a much safer workplace with improved employee morale and productivity.
Safety training can cover any potential risk in the workplace. Because each
company and industry is different, you should tailor your employee training
to the exact needs of your organization. Typical topics include
 Bloodborne pathogens
 Correct lifting techniques
 Ergonomics (adapting working conditions to better suit employees)
 Respirator safety
 Forklift safety
 Electrical safety
 Office security
 First aid and CPR
 Evacuation plan
Employee safety is important — not only to companies that rely on their
employees to work productively and efficiently, but also to the federal govern-
ment, which established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) to save lives, prevent injuries, and protect the health of America’s
workers. The key to employee safety is the behavior of the employees them-
selves. Human error is reported to be the single largest cause of workplace
emergencies. Incentives can play a role in rewarding safe employee behavior,
thereby decreasing the amount of incidents that take place.
Here are some guidelines for using incentives to encourage safe behavior at
work:
 Customize the incentives for your organization. What works for one
company may not work for yours. Each organizational culture has its
own unique needs and motivators. If you pick the right incentives
(things that the employees themselves value), your safety program will
be much stronger than a program that uses no incentives or the wrong
incentives.
346
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

 Distribute the incentives fairly. For an incentive program to work,
incentives must be distributed fairly. Avoid contests that reward only a
few people or that reinforce the view that safety is a matter of chance or
luck. Heartland Foods and W.R. Grace instituted lottery-style programs
that have the potential to make everyone a winner. Employees of these
companies who meet safety goals can receive scratch-off tickets called
“safety bucks.” An employee can redeem a buck immediately if it con-
tains matching symbols. If not, the employee can still accumulate bucks
and redeem them later for gifts or other awards.
 Make your incentives meaningful and timely. Incentives are meaningful
when they’re well proportioned to specific behaviors or results. In other
words, employees who exhibit safe behavior during the course of an entire
year should receive a more significant reward than employees who exhibit
safe behavior for only a month (although you should still reward and
encourage these employees for their safe behavior). Also, give rewards —
whether they’re material gifts or verbal acknowledgments — in a timely
manner, soon after employees reach their goals. Doing so boosts the
impact of the incentive.
New Technology, New Risks: 
Internet and E-mail Threats
The rise of the Internet and new computer and telecommunications technologies
has revolutionized the business world. Now an employee can work (and
virtually be) most anyplace around the globe, with a complete suite of office
tools available 24/7. Although these technologies have revolutionized busi-
ness in so many ways, they’ve also revolutionized the world of risk — and not
always in positive ways.
Truth be told, cyberspace is still a fairly new place for most people, and it’s still
pretty wild and wooly around the edges. Hackers, cyber spoofs, viruses, worms,
digital defamation, cyber extortion, intellectual-property (IP) infringement, and
so on are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the risks that businesses
today must contend with. To ignore these technology risks is to put the long-
term survival of your business in peril. To help you get a better idea of the
technology risks you and your business may encounter and how to protect
your IT interests, this section takes a closer look at some of these threats.
347
Chapter 19: The Ins and Outs of Risk Management

Although you don’t personally have to be an expert in computer security
(unless that’s your job — in which case you’d better be an expert!), you must
at least understand that the threat to your company’s computers, networks,
e-mail systems, and more, is very real. Just because your systems haven’t
been attacked yet doesn’t mean they’ll be safe tomorrow. You need to make
sure you have good security in place to protect your company’s information
technology and intellectual property — often a company’s most valuable
asset — and talented experts to install the security and monitor the threats
on an ongoing basis.
Viruses, Trojan horses, worms, and 
other strange beings of risk
When you become familiar with the world of information technology, it may
seem as though there are people who sit around all day thinking up new ways
to get into your computer, take it over, and tend to their own nefarious pur-
poses. Actually, there are many people — hackers — who do exactly that.
Why? Some do it for the challenge, and some do it for the fun of watching
their work create mayhem within an organization, but others do it for the
money. Someone, after all, is paying for all those fake Rolex and Viagra ads
that bombard computers around the world each and every day.
Hackers have a variety of tools at their disposal — the vast majority of which
are software-based. The term for intentionally destructive software is mal-
ware, which is a shortened version of the term “malicious software” — soft-
ware that infiltrates a computer system without the owner’s consent for the
purpose of damaging it. Within this overall category of tools is an alphabet
soup of potential threats, including the following:
 Virus: A self-replicating software program that can infect other connected
computers independently of human action. Most viruses are designed to
stay hidden deep within a computer until the time comes to do its duty,
which could be anything from sending out spam (messages in bulk) to
other computers to crashing your hard drive. Although many viruses are
destructive, some aren’t; however, all are designed to infect as many other
computers as possible before being detected.
 Worm: Malware that can replicate itself across network connections but
without modifying or attaching itself to a host program. Similar to a
virus, worms can be used by hackers to do all sorts of malicious things.
 Trojan horse: A software program that says it’s one thing — something
that appears to be harmless on the surface — but turns out to be some-
thing destructive. An odd e-mail message you get that says something
along the lines of, “Here’s the file you requested,” may actually contain
348
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

349
Chapter 19: The Ins and Outs of Risk Management
Trojans. When you click on the file to open it, your computer becomes
infected with malware programs that can do things such as record your
keystrokes or copy passwords and send them to the hacker.
 Denial of service attack: Using thousands of computers under their
control, hackers can target a specific computer network with an over-
whelming amount of incoming traffic — far more than normal — causing
the network to slow down or crash due to the strain to its systems.
 Mail bomb: A denial of service attack on an e-mail server, causing your
e-mail system to slow down or crash.
 Hoaxes: Although they’re not actual pieces of malware, hoaxes can
spread hysteria among employees over nothing. However, over time,
hoaxes cause employees to become less vigilant to real threats.
Computer security experts estimate that the annual monetary losses suffered
by businesses globally due to the work of hackers numbers in the billions of
dollars. Although this number is huge in itself, be aware that personal com-
puters and computer networks aren’t the only things at risk of attack.
Hackers can compromise any device that has a computer chip and communi-
cates with the outside world. This increasingly means cellphones, PDAs (per-
sonal digital assistants), and wireless networks are also at risk.
Dealing with threats to your 
information technology
So, if you’ve read the previous sections, you understand that the threat to your
information technology is real and that hackers are working 24/7 to find new
ways to get into your computers and access all your juicy data. Now what? The
good news is that you can do a number of things to reduce the risk to your
business. The following list outlines some of the most important steps you can
take to increase the security of your information technology right now:
 Dedicate an employee or consultant to protect your computer systems.
If your company is large enough, consider putting one person — either an
employee or a consultant — in charge of watching over your information
technology security, scanning for new threats, and constantly monitoring
your systems for signs of unwanted entry.
 Install anti-virus software (and keep it up to date!). You can find many
sources for good, reliable anti-virus software — and some basic versions
can be obtained at little or no cost.

However, keep in mind that many hackers specifically target anti-virus
software, hoping to get into your computer before your software vendor
realizes that a new threat is on the horizon. This means that you need to
keep your anti-virus software up to date and scan your system regularly
for viruses.
 Install firewalls. Every communication portal to the outside world
needs to be locked down with a firewall through which hackers can’t
pass. Firewalls can take the form of software programs or hardware
devices, such as network routers. And don’t forget to lock down your
wireless networks, too. These are particularly common entry points for
hackers today.
 Install redundant systems. Instead of just relying on one anti-virus soft-
ware package or type of firewall, you should incorporate many different
forms of security into your computers and computer networks. The idea
is that, if one of the systems becomes vulnerable to attack, the other
systems will be ready to step in and block the attacks.
 Install e-mail filtering. Using an e-mail filter is a simple and inexpensive
way to block the most common entry point for malware — your employees’
e-mail messages. You can configure your filters to block the following:
• Executable files (which most viruses and other malware are)
• Resource-hogging (and, potentially, copyright-violating) video and
audio files
• Graphics files and photographs
• E-mail from specific Internet-service providers such as Gmail,
Yahoo!, Hotmail, and so on
 Back up your systems regularly. You should regularly back up your
computers — at least once a day — so that if a hacker manages to crash
your hard drives, your systems can recover and carry on as if nothing
ever happened.
 Train your employees. You should assume that your employees need to
be educated about the technology risks your organization faces. Take
the time — and spend the money — to train your employees. Tell them
what they can do to avoid compromising your information technology,
and enlist their active help in fighting the threats.
The bottom line: Avoiding technology threats — and avoiding potentially
massive damage to your data and your business — requires constant vigi-
lance. Are you prepared to meet the challenge?

You’re looking for a new location for your business, but you have rather
limited cash flow — you can’t afford more than $3,000 a month to lease
office space. You call a real estate broker who finds the perfect location for
$3,500 a month — $500 more than you can manage. Will the subsequent
negotiation be easy or difficult?
Remember, the broker works on commission, so he must sell or lease properties
to make money. The broker certainly knows that you’re interested, but what do
you know about him? How has his past month gone? Did he lease a lot of prop-
erties, or has the month been dry? Is this a hot commercial property, or has it
been on the market a long time? Are many other properties available, or is it a
renter’s market?
Or perhaps you’re fine in your present office, but you have a new product idea
that you want to launch. It will require some outside sources of capital, because
your company doesn’t have the resources to spend on a risky innovation. What
you need is risk capital. Do you know what investors are looking for in these
types of investments? Can your company survive a deep investigation, which is
part of the due diligence that investors conduct? Do you have a compelling
story that will sell investors on your product idea?
These are just two examples among the hundreds of situations in which business
owners and managers must negotiate for items or services they need or want. In
this chapter, we explore the nature of business negotiation and give you some
tools that enable you to do an effective job of negotiating in any business
situation. Anyone can learn to negotiate successfully by following the guidelines
provided in this chapter. It just takes planning, practice, and patience.

Ready to Rumble: Negotiation 101
As a businessperson, understanding the basics of negotiation is essential so
you can effectively negotiate even the smallest, most insignificant debates
within all your business relationships. Hiring an attorney or professional nego-
tiator to handle your every negotiation isn’t financially feasible (although we
strongly suggest that you hire a good attorney for major negotiations, such as
selling your business).
Consider the following scenarios: It’s Monday morning. Before leaving for
work, you and your spouse must agree on who will take the kids to their
doctor appointment after school. You probably have to negotiate to decide
who’s in the best position to take on that task. Maybe you each have an
errand to run after work. Whose task is more important? Who can change
what he or she had planned?
You arrive at your office, and your business partner wants to discuss fitting
two new projects into your already overburdened schedule. Will that discus-
sion require some negotiating skills? Are you predisposed to take on more
than you can handle? After this first encounter, another employee asks for a
raise that’s far beyond what your budget allows. How can you satisfy your
employee’s needs and the company’s needs at the same time? Is that a nego-
tiation? Because you’re now running late, you must call a customer to
reschedule a lunch appointment for 1 p.m. If the customer can’t easily change
her schedule, you find yourself in a negotiation over what to do.
By noon, you’ve already had four different negotiations!
This section takes a closer look at negotiations and helps you identify what
type of negotiation you’re dealing with and what you need to do to prepare to
enter that negotiation from a position of strength.
Matching your strategy with the type of
negotiation: Is winning everything?
No two negotiations are alike, but there are some broad categories of negotia-
tion types that can help you define the context in which you’ll be negotiating.
In their book, Everything’s Negotiable . . . When You Know How to Play the Game
(American Management Association), Eric Skopec and Laree Kiely give some
important criteria for figuring out the type of negotiation you’re facing so that
you can design the most appropriate strategy to achieve the objective you’ve
set. Here are the four broad categories of negotiations and under what circum-
stances they’re typically used:

 Win-win (we both come out on top):
• The issue is important to you.
• You value your relationship with the other party.
• You have enough time to search for an approach and solution that
satisfies everyone.
 Win-lose (I win, you lose):
• The issue is important to you.
• Preserving your relationship with the other party doesn’t matter.
• You have the time to beat the other party into submission.
• You can’t use a win-win strategy because the other party will take
advantage of you.
 Lose-win (I’ll let you win this one):
• The issue isn’t important to you.
• You value your relationship with the other party.
• You’re under time constraints and want to finish the negotiation
quickly, so you’re willing to lose to accomplish that.
 Lose-lose (we should just get this done):
• The issue is relatively unimportant to both parties.
• You may build a relationship based on mutual suffering. Time
and/or transaction costs are primary considerations.
• You’re willing to compromise to resolve the situation.
Although it would be nice if both parties could win in every negotiation, win-
win situations often aren’t possible. In fact, sometimes you may even choose
to lose a negotiation. Why would you go into a negotiation planning to lose?
 You may choose not to play the game. Recall the many times a day you
face negotiations, most of which probably are B- or C-level issues. Because
the rewards for these issues aren’t great, working to come up with a win-
lose or a win-win negotiation isn’t worth your time, resources, and effort.
For example, you may decide that you don’t want to take consulting
projects with difficult clients. Although the monetary reward is enticing,
the excessive costs in terms of stress, time spent learning to deal with the
persons, and general frustration make the prize less valuable.
 You should consider taking a loss when you have an absolute deadline
that you won’t meet if you go for a winning solution.
 You may choose to lose because you want to put your company’s efforts
into more important issues. The classic example is dealing with a disgrun-
tled customer. You know the saying, “The customer is always right.” If
you subscribe to that maxim, you’ll lose when the customer demands
353
Chapter 20: In Business, Everything Is Negotiation

satisfaction — even when the customer is wrong. We know of several
retailers that accept returns from customers even when the customers
obviously didn’t purchase their items at their stores. Why would these
retailers maintain such a policy? Because they want satisfied customers
to tell others about their positive experiences. If a retailer loses one cus-
tomer just to win a negotiation, the loss of that disgruntled customer
can translate into a loss of nine additional customers — the number of
people to whom the disgruntled customer tells his or her tale of woe.
Of course, if the same customer pulls this trick on a regular basis, you’ll
eventually have to get rid of the customer by making him or her lose the
negotiation. This is called playing hardball; businesspeople use this
tactic when they don’t expect to ever deal with the customers again,
because the cost of retaining them as customers is greater than the loss
of their business.
Preparing for a negotiation: What 
you need to ask yourself
A business negotiation requires some thought and preparation if you want to
be effective and achieve your desired outcome. MindTools (www.mindtools
.com), a great career site that we often recommend, suggests that you answer
some critical questions as you prepare for a negotiation:
 What do you want to walk away with after this negotiation? What
does your opponent want? You need to know what you’re trying to
achieve by negotiating — what outcome do you want? You also need to
figure out what your opponent’s objective is. Try putting yourself in your
opponent’s shoes and figure out how you’d approach the negotiation
from her perspective.
 Do you and your opponent have anything to trade or offer to make a
deal work? You should always go into a negotiation prepared to give
something away, typically something that doesn’t matter a great deal to
you, but is considered valuable by your opponent.
 What are the alternatives to a negotiated agreement? This often is
referred to as your BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement).
In other words, what’s your Plan B? What happens if you can’t come to
an agreement?
 What are the interests of the various parties to the negotiation? Not all
the parties who influence the negotiation may be present at the bargaining
table. The real parties are those who can say “yes” or “no,” in other words,
the decision makers. It’s always best to negotiate with someone who can
make a decision. Failing that, you need to attempt to get that information
from the person with whom you’re negotiating.
354
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

 What are the consequences of winning or losing the negotiation?
Calculating the upsides and downsides of your negotiations is a wise
thing to do because they can affect your strategy. If the upside is high —
you gain a lot from winning — you’ll likely employ a win-win strategy if
your relationship with your opponent is important to you. On the other
hand, if that relationship isn’t important, you may be more willing to go
for a win-lose strategy if win-win isn’t working. Remember, however, that
your opponent is looking at the negotiation in the same manner, so if nei-
ther of you cares about the relationship, coming to a win-win agreement
is going to be tough.
 What may prevent a successful agreement? Can you identify ways to
overcome these challenges? Is there a zone of possible agreement
(ZOPA)? The best way to end up with a resolution that everyone is satis-
fied with is to find issues on which you can both agree. Start with those
first to set a positive tone and send a signal that you’re trying to achieve
a win-win agreement.
 Who has the power in this negotiation? Who stands to lose the most if
you can’t agree? Whoever has the most to lose will probably be the
toughest negotiator. At the same time, whoever has the most to lose will
also be more likely to try to find areas of agreement and attempt to
arrive at a win-win solution.
 Are there any possible compromises? Compromise usually is the last
resort, because compromising is essentially a lose-lose situation unless
the issues about which you’re compromising aren’t significant.
Understanding the ethical 
side of negotiation
Eventually, every negotiation comes down to this question: What is the right
thing to do? Assuming that you’re the negotiator, the answer depends on
your value system and how you believe the other party will respond. The
answer also stems from a series of questions that you should ask yourself.
There are no right or wrong answers to these questions; you simply need to
decide if the answer you choose is compatible with your ethics and value
system. The following list presents a few of these questions:
 How much candor is required for a successful negotiation? For example,
we advise you not to reveal your walk-away price or your BATNA (see the
section “Ready to Rumble: Negotiating 101”) because doing so will put you
in a weaker position to negotiate. One could say that you’re failing to
disclose material information, but one could also argue that disclosing 
too much information may make a win-win solution impossible.
 Are you required to ensure that the ultimate outcome is fair? If the out-
come is win-win, you can assume fairness, but how do you judge a 
355
Chapter 20: In Business, Everything Is Negotiation

win-lose outcome as fair? You probably don’t consider it fair. That’s 
why win-lose should only be undertaken when win-win isn’t a possibility.
 Is the use of economic pressure unethical? Most people are inconsis-
tent in their views of this answer. People may resent the store owner
who increases the price of generators and lumber just before hurricane
season, but they’re okay with the airlines charging more for the same
seat a week before the flight than they charged two months before.
Only you can decide how you would respond to these questions. You also
need to recognize that your opponent may have a different value system. For
example, your opponent may believe that a win-lose negotiation is fair and a
good resolution. Figuring out your opponent’s value system isn’t easy, but
you can get a clue from her tactics after you’ve spent some time in negotia-
tion with that person.
Sizing Up Any Deal’s Critical Elements
To understand what really goes on in a negotiation, you need to consider the
three critical elements of any deal: power, time, and information. You’ll be
successful in your negotiating efforts to the extent that you can control these
three factors. Consider one of our examples at the start of this chapter: You
want to lease some office space for your business, but the monthly price is
too high for your budget. If office space is in short supply, then the broker
has power because he can easily find another lessee. On the other hand, if
there is an abundance of office space, you, the business owner, have the
power because you can choose from many possibilities. If you must be out of
your present location within two weeks, then time is an issue for you. Finally,
information plays a role when the broker knows more about your needs and
timing than you know about his. The next few sections look at each of these
negotiating factors in more detail.
Power is a good thing
The first thing you need to know about power in negotiations is that to have
power, you must believe that you have power, and you must present an aura of
power. Remember the Wizard of Oz? He cloaked himself in an aura of power; he
spoke with an authoritative voice and never let anyone see who he really was.
Former President Jimmy Carter’s federal budget director, Bert Lance, was
famous for creating a perception of power. He acted as though he didn’t need
money — as if he had options— so he managed to acquire 381 loans from 41
banks. Of course, the minute the bankers found out that he needed these
356
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

loans to pay back other loans (robbing Peter to pay Paul), his sources dried
up completely. The moral of the story? Use your power wisely!
Several types of power (or lack thereof) come into play in negotiating situations:
 Sometimes you have legitimate power: Your position determines your
legitimate power. As CEO of a company, you have legitimate power to
make decisions in negotiations, so you need to let people see you as
capable of carrying out that role. If the other party involved in a negotia-
tion is the CEO of a company, you must be sure that you see that person
as a peer, an equal. Don’t give your opposition more power than he or
she is entitled to because you’ll weaken your position in the negotiation.
 You have the power to reward . . . : Reward power is the ability to offer
rewards to the other party for agreeing to something you want in a nego-
tiation. This power is similar to an incentive system you may use with
your employees to get them to be more productive (see Chapter 7). Be
sure that you reward only those solutions that you’re looking for. If you
reward every point of agreement you come to, the reward loses its value
to influence.
 . . . And the power to punish: We don’t encourage you to use coercive
power in a negotiation setting, because doing so probably won’t lead to a
win-win conclusion. People don’t like to agree because they must. A far
better power tactic is to get the other party to do something because he
or she wants to; in that situation, your opponent will see the rationale
and the benefit of the solution.
 You may be an expert in some area . . . : As an expert, you have a partic-
ular skill or knowledge that the other party doesn’t have. That additional
knowledge or skill gives you a certain amount of power and enables you
to deal in a less emotional way. In any negotiation, you should define
what expertise you have that may give you power in the process.
 . . . Or you may just be charismatic: Perhaps you’ve witnessed instances
where a lawyer’s reputation and expertise have enabled her to win over a
jury, even when the evidence pointed in the opposite direction. Of course,
part of that persuasion is due to the next type of power: charisma. Yes,
charisma — that certain something that some people have that attracts
others to them — can play an important role in a negotiation. Charisma
can intimidate and distract the other party. One party may be in such awe
of the person sitting across the table that he immediately loses any
power he may have possessed. If you’re negotiating with a charismatic
person, remind yourself that she needs something from you, too.
357
Chapter 20: In Business, Everything Is Negotiation

Time is on your side
Because of the information technology revolution, people today believe that
transactions, tasks, and meetings should happen instantaneously. They lose
patience when others don’t seem to have any sense of time or appreciation
for their deadlines. Frankly, no nation focuses on the clock more than the
United States. Americans often plan their days down to the minute — espe-
cially in the business world.
A “get it done now” attitude, however, doesn’t work well when you’re sitting
at the negotiating table. During a negotiation, the person who isn’t operating
by the clock definitely has the edge.
Eastern cultures are masters at the game of patience and relationship build-
ing. They tend to take the long view of the outcome of a negotiation, whereas
Americans look for the quick win. One classic example of the effect of time on
a negotiation took place during the Vietnam War, when the United States was
trying to persuade the North Vietnamese to come to the bargaining table.
The attempt took months, and the United States grew very impatient. What
the U.S. negotiators didn’t take into account was that the Vietnamese had
been fighting a succession of different parties — including the Chinese,
Mongols, French, and Americans — for 627 years! Consequently, the 32-year-
old Vietnamese war was peanuts compared to that. When the Vietnamese
finally agreed to meet in Paris to negotiate a peace, the U.S. delegation rented
a hotel room on a week-to-week basis. The Vietnamese delegation rented a
villa outside of Paris with a two-and-a-half-year lease!
Now, which party had the power of patience on its side? In reality, the
Vietnamese also were working under a deadline, but their negotiators didn’t
want the Americans to perceive that they were. The Vietnamese wanted to
retain the power of time on their side. And they did. A resolution to their
mutual problems occurred in the final moments before the U.S. deadline.
When you go to the bargaining table, remember these tips about time:
 Be patient and try not to reveal your deadline.
 Understand that each party has a deadline, no matter what picture the
other party paints for you.
 Recognize that you probably won’t achieve a negotiated agreement
until the last possible moment.
358
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

Information is the key
Fundamentally, negotiation is about gathering information so that you can
reach a decision and achieve a resolution. Each party strives to give only the
information that’s absolutely necessary, and each party attempts to gather
loads of information from the other side to gain an advantage in negotiating a
resolution. Information is particularly important if you want to achieve a win-
win solution, because you must understand each party’s interests to find a
way to satisfy those interests.
To gain information you need from the other party, you may try to appear a
bit confused about what the other party says. Although this advice may seem
quite the opposite of what we say in previous sections about gaining power,
rest assured that we’re not asking you to roll over and appear stupid. Asking
for clarification on something simply forces the other party to restate a
demand in another way. Maybe that new statement will provide a piece of
information that you didn’t have before.
Of course, you should recognize that the other party is trying to do the same
thing with you! Here are three more tips that should help you control the flow
of information:
 Control the information you give out and carefully word what you
say. Give only as much as you have to and then stop talking.
 Practice active listening. Take notes and attempt to find patterns in the
other party’s arguments that will lead you to an understanding of what
he or she really wants and why.
 Watch the other party’s nonverbal cues carefully. More than 70 percent
of communication is nonverbal. For example, if you note that while
you’re speaking, the other party sits with her arms folded in a closed
position, you can assume that she isn’t receptive to what you’re saying.
On the other hand, if she leans forward when you speak, you know that
you’re saying something that interests her.
Let’s Make a Deal: How
to Play the Game
Playing the negotiation game is much easier if you know the rules and you
think about how you’re going to play before the negotiation starts. Seasoned
negotiators recognize the natural sequence of activities that take place
during a negotiation. (A sequence that assumes you’ve done the necessary
preparation.) The reason the sequence is “natural” is that it makes sense and
359
Chapter 20: In Business, Everything Is Negotiation

the order is logical. When you don’t follow the sequence, things can get
crazy, and negotiating becomes more difficult. The following sections cover
the sequence of negotiation and the importance of setting goals for the
encounter. We also give some tips for making sure that you come out of a
negotiation with a good deal.
Following the natural sequence
The simple sequence of negotiation has four parts:
1. Set the stage and chat with the players.
Creating an environment conducive to good negotiation is important.
Often, this environment is a neutral playing field so that one side doesn’t
have the home-court advantage over the other. You also want to spend
some time on pre-negotiation chatter to put everyone at ease and to
establish procedures for the negotiation process.
2. Separate interests from positions.
Most negotiations start with the parties stating their positions, such as
“I must get $45/unit.” However, position statements reflect a win-lose
attitude and don’t leave the door open for other potentially more effec-
tive negotiating strategies. You must get beyond position statements to
discover what the other party really wants — their interests in the nego-
tiation. Separate the people from the problem. Perhaps the other party’s
real goal is to cover his costs. If that’s the case, you may be able to sat-
isfy this interest in many ways. As a result, you have the potential for a
mutually beneficial outcome.
3. Create alternatives that can offer a win-win solution.
After you understand each other’s interests, you can begin to develop
proposals that can meet them all. Don’t worry about making a proposal
complex and legally correct at this point. You merely want to establish
agreement on the fundamental points of the negotiation. It’s important,
however, that you consider all possible solutions that fall into the win-
win category.
4. Construct a winning agreement.
The final stage of the negotiation is where all the fun happens. If the
negotiation is typical, you’ll be running up against a deadline — yours or
the other party’s. Now it takes some trading, bargaining, swapping, and
perhaps even compromising to mold the agreement into a form that’s
acceptable to both sides. If you can find some objective criteria for
making decisions that suit your situation, you’ll be more likely to reach a
fair agreement.
360
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

Each time you reach final agreement on a point, have both parties initial
that point of agreement so you feel like you’ve accomplished something
and can move forward.
Knowing what you want before 
you play the game
One of the biggest problems people have in negotiations is that they don’t
know what they want to have achieved by the time the negotiation is over.
How do you successfully negotiate when your target keeps moving? If you
can’t define a goal for a negotiation, don’t negotiate.
You can become a more effective negotiator if you consider the following tips:
 Go in with a plan. Negotiating for something important isn’t the time to
“wing it.” Set some objectives that you want to achieve, and decide what
you’re willing to give up to make things work.
 Put yourself in the other person’s shoes. Try to figure out the other
party’s interests and needs. Ask questions and try to see things from the
other person’s point of view.
 Be a super listener. You always learn more by listening than by speaking.
In fact, talking too much in a negotiation can hurt you, because you give
away too much information. Always let the other party begin and do
most of the talking.
 Never threaten or intimidate. Explaining your point of view is necessary,
but don’t issue subtle threats about what will happen if the other party
doesn’t accept your proposal. This only serves to alienate the other
party. In addition, you’re less likely to achieve an amicable solution.
 Be patient. “Patience is a virtue” is certainly true in a negotiation. The
Japanese, for instance, use their incredible patience as a negotiating tool,
and it works. Most people have deadlines and are in a rush to make things
happen. If a Japanese negotiator discovers your deadline, he or she won’t
even begin the actual negotiation until just before your deadline so that
you’ll agree to almost anything to close the deal and meet your deadline.
 Define an acceptable backup strategy. What if you can’t come to a win-
win agreement? This is a very important question, because you need to
know whether you can afford the luxury of walking away from a negotia-
tion. If you’ve defined an acceptable backup strategy, you put yourself in
a better position to walk away from a bad situation.
361
Chapter 20: In Business, Everything Is Negotiation

Making sure you end up with a good deal
How many times have you heard people boasting about great wins at the
negotiating table? Usually, they attribute their wins to some great tactical
skill on their part. For example,
I always use the silence tactic. It works every time. My opponent gives me her
final offer, and I remain silent. My silence throws her so off guard that she starts
backing down even further and gives two concessions to get me to respond.
During the entire negotiation, I only made one insignificant concession. Boy,
was I the master of that negotiation.
Was he the master of that negotiation? Maybe not. Just because his opponent
made some concessions doesn’t mean that they were valuable. They may
have been her giveaways. What if she had planned to make seven concessions
and only gave up two? Now would you say he was a master negotiator?
Here’s the point: A negotiation is successful to the extent that it achieves the
goals set by the parties involved. In other words, both parties in the negotiation
must define what success means to them.
The following list looks at some signs of a good outcome:
 A good outcome beats your other choices. Working on an agreement with
the other party must be more valuable than your best alternative to the
negotiation, or negotiating doesn’t make sense. Your backup option —
your BATNA or second choice — should be a good one, but the outcome
from a negotiated deal should have much greater value because you put
more effort into it.
 A good outcome makes everyone happy. To get the other party to
accept your deal, you must satisfy his or her interests, at least in part.
The classic story of two siblings fighting over an orange illustrates this
idea. Each sibling wants the entire piece of fruit, but each is willing to
accept something less rather than get nothing at all. So they divide the
orange in half. The first sibling proceeds to throw away the fruit and use
the peel to bake half a pie. The second sibling throws away the peel and
eats the fruit. Of course, if they had understood each other’s interests,
they could have found a better way to satisfy them both.
 A good outcome is the best solution among many. Generating more than
one solution to a situation and then choosing the best of the alternatives
is an important step in negotiating. With this method, you’re more likely
to choose the most optimal solution. In the case of the siblings with the
orange, a much better solution would have been to give one sibling the
whole fruit and the other the whole peel. That additional option would
have satisfied both their interests and provided a win-win outcome.
362
Part V: Other Important Stuff 

 A good outcome occurs when no one is taken to the cleaners.
Everyone should come away from the negotiation feeling that, given the
circumstances, the achieved outcome is the best possible end. If both
parties don’t clearly understand the rationale for the outcome, you
haven’t achieved an optimal outcome.
 A good outcome tells everyone what to do and how. After you’ve reached
an agreement, ensuring that both parties understand what to do — and
when — is important. Coming up with some action steps is a good way to
make sure that both parties carry out the agreement in the way that every-

Some do’s and don’ts of negotiations
You can find many great books about negotiating in business situations, but
allow us to save you a bit of trouble by consolidating some important
information. All the how-to books contain some very basic rules that are true
in every negotiation. The following lists present these basics that you can use
as a checklist before you begin your negotiations. First up, the don’ts of business
negotiations:
 Don’t say yes to a proposal the first time you hear it. Even if the proposal
is too good to be true — especially if it seems too good to be true — wait
and hear it again before making your final decision. The other party may
be testing the waters to gauge how desperate you are for this deal.
 Don’t be the first to name a price. Always try to get the other party to
initiate the talk so that you gain important information that will help you
negotiate more effectively.
 Don’t negotiate with yourself. Some people, faced with silence after an
offer, feel the need to fill the space with chatter. Often, they end up rais-
ing their price or inadvertently justifying the other party’s point of view.
At that point, they may as well end the negotiations, because they’ve
lost any power they may have had.
 Don’t be afraid to say no. Remember that the opposite of no is yes. In a
negotiation, there’s really nothing in the middle between yes and no. So,
if you’re not happy with something you hear, just say no. Doing so forces
the other side to possibly reconsider and present the idea in a different
way that may be more acceptable to you.
 Don’t be intimidated. Everything in business is negotiable, even if you’re
dealing with writing in contract form. Don’t be intimidated by professional-
looking documents with “iron-clad” terms.
 Don’t trust the other party’s actions. If the other party arrives late to
the negotiation or appears disinterested, don’t assume that this action
reflects a lack of interest. The other party just wants you to think that.
363
Chapter 20: In Business, Everything Is Negotiation

 Don’t talk about the deal or the negotiation in seemingly empty offices,
hallways, restrooms, or elevators, and definitely not on airplanes. You
just never know who’s listening.
Now that you know what not to do, here are a few things to do in every 
negotiation:
 Do try to hold the negotiation at your site or at a neutral site. Going to
the other party’s office puts you at a disadvantage, because your opponent
will be more comfortable and will also have the power to control your level
of comfort in the room to his or her advantage.
 Do deal only with the person who can make the decision. When you
buy a car, the salesperson may claim that she must talk with her man-
ager first. That move only gives the two of them a chance to renegotiate
the deal. Control the negotiation by making a deal only with the person
who can say yes or no.
 Do control your temper and emotions. If you can’t control yourself, let
someone else do the negotiating for you. Yelling and screaming never
results in a good deal.
Think of negotiation as a game — a game you can win if you prepare for it,
practice, and define some specific, achievable outcomes that will offer all
parties to the negotiation a win-win solution.

Econ 101: The Basics 
of Economics
In This Chapter
 Looking back through history at conflicting economic theories
 Examining fundamental economic questions
 Considering the effect of key economic concepts
 Adding knowledge to the value creation equation
O
kay, we admit it. Economics isn’t a topic that gets everyone excited; in
fact, we’d love to know how many people actually skipped this chapter,
thinking that they’d never use its contents. That’s too bad, because econom-
ics is about choices — choices we make every day.
When you go to the local deli to grab a quick lunch, you encounter many issues
related to economics: the price that you pay for your sandwich, the way the food
products that you eat are produced, and whether the restaurant can afford to
hire enough staff, among others. How you choose to spend the money you have
left after taxes is an economic decision — namely, a decision about resources.
Resources are typically limited, thus forcing you to determine how to allocate
them. The resource decisions you make every day are exactly like the resource
decisions that nations around the world make. The difference is that your deci-
sions are on a much smaller scale (unless you’re Bill Gates or J.K. Rowling, 
who each make more resource decisions than many individual countries!).
In this chapter, we talk about these and other economic principles that affect
you and your business. You also discover that economists don’t often agree
on things — particularly when looking at the impact of the entrepreneur on
the economy. This chapter explores some basic economics related to busi-
ness that help round out your MBA experience.

Why Adam Smith Knew What 
He Was Talking About
Who is Adam Smith, anyway? In 1776, Smith wrote The Wealth of Nations, a
book that both marked the beginning of modern economics and made Smith
a household name (mostly, anyway) more than 200 years later. In it, he
wrestled with a paradox:
“How is it that water, which is so very useful that life is impossible without
it, has such a low price — while diamonds, which are quite unnecessary,
have such a high price?”
Isn’t it interesting that we continue to grapple with this issue today — for
instance, as we struggle to understand the valuations of Internet companies that
own unique ideas rather than valuable property or manufacturing processes? A
company producing a product that everyone uses may have a very low
valuation, while a company producing something that only a small percentage
of the country uses has a stratospheric valuation. How can we explain that?
The answer to the paradox is something that any economics student today
can answer. Water isn’t really a scarce item relative to diamonds, so it costs
more to get more diamonds than it does to get more water. Smith didn’t have
economic tools about supply and demand to arrive at that conclusion, but he
did recognize that “value in use” isn’t the same as “value in exchange.”
Basically, you usually can’t price an item higher simply because it’s more
useful. In fact, quite the opposite is true.
A product’s highest price is determined by its marginal utility, which is the
value of its last usable unit. So, if you apply Adam Smith’s paradox, water has
a relatively low price because it’s everywhere and is so useful. Diamonds, on
the other hand, have a relatively high price because they’re scarce by
comparison and not a necessity — they have marginal utility, in other words.
You can take two rules away from this discussion:
 If your company produces very useful products, the products will
become commodities and the price will come down. As a result, you
must sell in large volumes to make a profit. For example, Intel’s micro-
processor chips came down in price very quickly after they first hit the
market as the latest technology. Within a few months, they became the
standard and Intel now sells them in large volumes at a very low cost.
 If your company produces products that are limited in their use and
availability, the price will go up. That means you’ll probably sell fewer
products, but you’ll make more money on each product. Mercedes, for

instance, intentionally produced its CLK car in short supply at introduction
to keep its value up. In some locations, customers paid as much as
$5,000 more than the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP).
Before we go any further, let’s be clear about the two flavors of economics:
macro and micro economics. Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as
a whole and all the factors that affect the economy, such as inflation, invest-
ment, international trade, and unemployment. Microeconomics, by contrast,
studies households, individuals, and companies and how their decisions
affect such things as supply and demand, prices, and so on. In the next sec-
tion, you get a glimpse into the ongoing battle among classical economists
such as Adam Smith, the neoclassic economists (literally “new classic”—
these were the mavericks of their time), and Austrian economists such as
Schumpeter, and what it all means to you.
Classic versus neoclassic: Almost 
as good as pro wrestling
Today, experts and businesspeople understand that entrepreneurs play a
critical role in the economy, but economists didn’t always believe that. Adam
Smith was really the first person to define “capitalist” as an owner-manager
who brought together land, labor, and capital to form a successful enterprise
and make profits. During the next 100 years, people began to argue furiously
about Smith’s theories and add to and subtract from them with their own.
In the late 1800s, economists such as Leon Walras and Alfred Marshall devel-
oped models by using the tools provided by mathematician Sir Isaac Newton.
These models ignored the entrepreneur and focused on perfectly competitive
markets with plenty of buyers and sellers who made sure that supply equaled
demand and created that nirvana called equilibrium. Equilibrium, in economic
terms, simply means that the supply of goods produced equals the demand by
customers. Today, the only place where this type of near-perfection exists is
in commodity markets, such as the Chicago Board of Trade, where buyers
and sellers actually meet on the trading floor to buy and sell.
For market equilibrium to exist, several things need to be in place:
 Every buyer and seller must have information about all the transactions
that happen.
 No one buyer or seller can influence the market.
 The market determines prices.
 Products and services need to be fundamentally alike so that the only
difference among them is price.
367
Chapter 21: Econ 101: The Basics of Economics 

This type of market — essentially a commodity market — is predictable, dis-
tributes income fairly equally, and has been the primary model of economic
theory in the United States (the neoclassic theory). The neoclassic theory is
compatible with large corporations and economies of scale, which means
that as the size of a company increases, it can produce its products more
cheaply because it can buy raw materials in larger quantities and can use its
plant and equipment more efficiently. But this neoclassic theory has had its
legions of critics because it doesn’t account for entrepreneurship, which dis-
rupts market equilibrium by causing new demand that didn’t exist previously.
And in this corner, we have the 
Austrian point of view
At the end of the 19th century, the classical economists — primarily from the
Austrian school — got tired of the fact that the neoclassic economists were
ignoring entrepreneurs. Joseph Schumpeter — often called the father of
entrepreneurship as we know it today — preached that there’s no such thing as
equilibrium between supply and demand and that markets are actually chaotic
(the stock market is a great example of chaos). He referred to entrepreneurship
as “creative destruction,” because the innovations of entrepreneurs destroy old
markets and build new wealth. A modern example is Apple Computer’s user-
friendly microcomputers, which ended the dominance of the minicomputers
from such companies as Digital Equipment Company (DEC). And Dell Computer
helped end the dominance of retail computer outlets by selling directly to
customers via the Internet and direct mail.
The important fact to glean from this information is that it’s actually difficult to
find good examples of companies that are very profitable because they’re very
big. In fact, when you’re producing at high levels, you’re probably producing
commodity products with low profit levels, so the only way to make more
profit is to reduce your costs of production. On the other hand, if you’re a
smaller company producing a non-commodity product, you can charge higher
prices and have higher production costs and still make more money. In
addition, because you’re smaller, you can change more rapidly in response to
market changes. So, size is important, and in this case, smaller often is better.
And the winner is . . .
One of the more important moments in economic theory occurred in 1979,
when economist David Birch published the results of his research on all U.S.
firms from 1969 through 1976. His findings were astounding. What he found
was this:
Small firms (100 or fewer employees) created 81 percent of net new jobs
in the United States.
368
Part V: Other Important Stuff

This discovery meant that the small businesses, not big corporations, were
driving the U.S. economy. Shocked by the finding, mainstream economists
were quick to say that it was bunk. But when economists replicated Birch’s
study, they found that his conclusions were correct!
This finding means that understanding economics today is about understanding
entrepreneurship and how entrepreneurs affect and drive the economy.
Poring Over Fundamental 
Economic Questions
Economics deals with three fundamental problem areas for any society:
 What should we produce and how much?
 How should we produce these goods and with what resources?
 For whom should we produce these goods?
Although the questions of what, how, and for whom are the same for a com-
munist country or a free enterprise system, the way economic organizations
deal with the questions differs. Every business deals with these questions.
They form the basis on which you start a business, and the answers are
guided by some fundamental principles, which we look at in the next sec-
tions. The following reviews the fundamental principles by briefly looking at
the major economic systems.
The lowdown on economic systems
An economic system is simply a set of laws, institutions, and activities that
guide decision making. Every economic system seeks to answer the questions
about how to allocate scarce resources. We summarize the different systems
for you here:
 Traditional economic system: Economies that are based on farming and
use simple barter trade have traditional economic systems. This system
remains only in remote areas, such as some parts of tribal Africa.
 Pure market system: This system is based on supply and demand with
little or no government control. The e-Bay reverse auction system is a
form of a pure market system.
 Command economy: This system is run by a strong centralized
government and focuses on industrial goods instead of consumer goods.
The former Soviet Union had a command economy.
369
Chapter 21: Econ 101: The Basics of Economics 

 Free enterprise system: Most democratic nations have this economic
form where individuals can make economic choices. This system is also
called capitalism or market economy. It’s characterized by competition
and a profit motive (entrepreneurs love this). Competition comes in four
flavors:
• Perfect competition: You have a lot of buyers and sellers and no
one giant company can affect price.
• Monopolistic competition: Many sellers produce differentiated
product and their goal is to dominate a niche in the market.
• Monopoly: A particular commodity has only one seller who controls
supply and prices. Free market economies don’t like monopolies.
• Oligopoly: There are a few competitors that dominate an industry.
The automobile industry is a great example of an oligopoly.
The United States and the European Union don’t have pure free enterprise
systems. They have mixed economies, which means that they combine the
principles of market and command economies. They have a centralized gov-
ernment for things such as national security and regulations for the common
good, but in business, they generally display a free enterprise system.
The law of supply and demand: You can’t
build it and expect them to come
In a free enterprise system, or mixed economy, the marketplace determines
the price of a product. Supply and demand interact to produce a price that
customers are willing to pay for the number of products that manufacturers
are willing to make. In a nutshell, supply and demand affects pricing in the
following ways:
 If a product is in great demand, but is in short supply, the price will rise.
 If there is a large supply for a product and little demand for it, the price
will go down.
 Prices stabilize when demand equals supply.
The law of scarcity: You can’t have it all
When you consider the three economic questions, the economic principle in
play is the law of scarcity. That’s because economic organizations wouldn’t
have to answer the questions if they had unlimited resources. Because 
organizations don’t have unlimited resources, they have to allocate their
scarce resources between necessities and luxuries.
370
Part V: Other Important Stuff

Your business certainly is an economic organization that must make deci-
sions about scarce resources. Which products or services to produce, how to
produce them, and for whom — these will become key questions that you
have to answer before you can successfully negotiate the marketplace.
How do you answer those questions? You answer all three by answering this
one: Who is your customer? Your customers (target or current) tell you what
to produce, when to produce it, and how to get it to them (see Chapter 15). In
addition, your suppliers and other entities in your industry can help you
choose the most cost-effective means to produce the product.
Bottom line: To answer the questions, pound the pavement and talk to
people in your industry.
The law of diminishing returns: 
That last bite of apple pie
The law of diminishing returns describes how much extra return you get on
your output as you add extra units of input. Suppose that you have a factory
that produces widgets. As you add labor to the production process, your abil-
ity to produce more goods increases to some point and then begins to dimin-
ish; this means that each person you add produces less than the previous
person. Maybe you can think of it this way: The first taste of ice cream is
always better than the last — that’s the law of diminishing returns.
In business you need to figure out the point at which you’re the most productive.
That point determines when you achieve the biggest gains for your efforts.
The knowledge economy: It defies 
the scarcity principle
The knowledge economy is a modern concept that suggests that today much of
the economic focus is on the production and management of knowledge assets.
Knowledge assets are intangible assets, not physical assets such as products,
land, and labor. They come about when individuals and companies turn
information into proprietary knowledge (know-how or intelligence). Today, 
the creation of value and economic performance is dependent on the effective
production, exploitation, and management of knowledge assets. Indeed, the
modern business environment has experienced an explosion of knowledge
assets in organizations — facilitated by modern information technology such
as computers, software, networks, and telecommunications.
For example, if your company develops a new product, it has created a physical
asset that is subject to basic economic principles such as scarcity and
371
Chapter 21: Econ 101: The Basics of Economics 

diminishing returns. In the production of that product, however, you often
also develop a proprietary process for producing the product (a trade secret)
and know-how from your experience producing the product that your com-
petitors don’t have. That intangible asset is knowledge and it gives you an
advantage in the market because you and you alone own it.
You can also replicate knowledge assets without further cost to your company.
Like software where the initial development costs are high, but replication
costs approach zero, knowledge assets produce high margins and add value
to the more traditional physical assets. The service economy, for example,
relies on knowledge assets.
Although capital, labor, and land often are constrained (remember the concept
of scarce resources), the good news about knowledge assets is they don’t
follow the traditional economic principle of scarce resources or diminishing
returns.
What Some Key Economic 
Concepts Mean to You
What’s unique about the U.S. economy is that individuals own and control
the factors of production. The factors of production are land, labor, capital,
and entrepreneurship. For example, if you own a restaurant, you may decide
to open another in a nearby city, hire 15 people, and pay them $12 an hour to
prepare and deliver your food products to your customers. You control your
business decisions as an owner or executive — as long as the decisions are
within the law. For example, where you can open a new restaurant depends
on the zoning restrictions for commercial development.
But ownership and control of the factors of production aren’t the only eco-
nomic concepts that come into play in business. The following sections take
a look at some key economic concepts that affect every business.
Riding the rollercoaster of economic cycles
The economy isn’t really in equilibrium for very long. It’s subject to many
changes in the form of business cycles. If the economy is in a period of
prosperity and inflation of prices and incomes, it will eventually taper off and a
contraction will take place, during which activity slows down. If the contraction
lasts long enough, the economy will slide into a recession or collapse into a
trough, called a depression. The slow recovery from a trough is called expansion.
The following sections look at these different business cycles and how you can
prepare for changes.
372
Part V: Other Important Stuff

Inflation: Blow a big bubble
Inflation is simply a period when prices rise sharply. During times of inflation,
your dollar purchases less in terms of goods and services. Not all prices rise,
but on average they do. So, if you get a 3 percent raise and the price of the
goods and services you buy goes up 7 percent, for instance, you won’t be able
to buy as much with the same dollars.
Two different scenarios cause inflation:
 When there’s too much demand and too little supply, prices rise. This is
known as demand-pull inflation. It often happens when the government
cuts taxes or when consumers save less.
 When production costs skyrocket, cost-push inflation occurs.
Manufacturers usually push the costs along to the customer in the form
of higher prices. Of course, then workers demand higher wages so that
they can pay for these higher prices. As a result, unemployment typi-
cally is high during this time because the higher costs aren’t driven by
demand, so companies aren’t hiring.
Recession/depression: When the bubble bursts
When the economy doesn’t grow for a period of at least six months, it’s said to
be in a recession. Both the 1980s and the 1990s started with recessions. During a
recession, people typically cut their spending — a behavior that, in turn, causes
the recession to get worse, because it slows down the economy even more.
A very bad recession can turn into a depression, which is when many businesses
fail, prices drop, and supply exceeds demand. October of 1929 was the start of
what’s known as the Great Depression, when business activity dropped by 40
percent and the unemployment rate was the highest it has ever been.
Preparing for changes in the economy
How can your business prepare for change in the economy? Here are some tips:
 Stay aware of what’s going on by reading newspapers and surfing the
Web. The following Web sites are good places to start (see the following
section for more on following the economy):
• The New York Times (www.nytimes.com)
• The Wall Street Journal (www.wsj.com)
• Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com)
• The Department of Commerce (www.doc.gov)
• CNNMoney (money.cnn.com)
373
Chapter 21: Econ 101: The Basics of Economics 

 Watch for leading indicators. For example, the leading index — which con-
sists of such things as the Producer Price Index, the Consumer Confidence
Index, and the Manufacturers’ Orders for Durable Goods Index — declines
for about nine months prior to the onset of a recession. The Consumer
Price Index, interest rates, and unemployment typically decline for 13
months prior to the onset of a recession. You’ll also hear these indices
referred to regularly on national news programs, so watch for them.
 Stay as liquid as possible. You want to be able to have cash on hand to
expand in good times and a cushion to help you survive the bad times.
Measuring the health of the economy
Economists regularly measure the health of the economy during the year.
What they find determines everything from whether the government raises
interest rates to whether you get a raise (important stuff!). The sections that
follow look at some of the more common indicators of economic health.
Gross Domestic Product
The Gross Domestic Product, also known as the GDP, is the total dollar value of
all goods and services produced in the United States. It’s essentially a record
of how much workers produced for consumers to purchase — the cost of
living. GDP looks at only new goods — for example, new cars.
Consumer Price Index
The Consumer Price Index, also known as the CPI or the cost of living index,
represents the change in price of a specific group of goods and services over
time. This group of goods and services is called a market basket, and it
includes about 400 items in such categories as food, housing, transportation,
clothing, entertainment, medical care, and personal care. As a business
owner, you need to be aware of the CPI because it affects the rent you pay on
your facility or the wages you pay your employees.
The CPI actually is a measure of inflation. When you read that inflation has
gone up a certain percentage, more often than not a change in the price of
things people typically buy has taken place.
Income
Income is a way of measuring how much money is available to be spent by
individuals and businesses. National income includes such things as wages
and salaries, self-employed income, rental income, corporate profits, and
interest on savings and investments.
374
Part V: Other Important Stuff

Economists are most interested in disposable and personal income. Personal
income is all income received before taxes are paid, and disposable income is
what’s left over after taxes.
Unemployment
The United States seems to take the issue of unemployment very seriously,
and why not? It represents the percentage of the labor force that’s actively
looking for jobs. If the number is low, most everyone is happy, but if the
number is high, people start to get nervous about their own jobs.
From an economist’s point of view, the United States is at full employment
when the unemployment rate is less than 6.5 percent.
Balance of trade
In the current global economy, you hear a lot about things such as balance of
trade because nearly every business is affected by global conditions. The dif-
ference between the value of the United States’ exports to other countries
and its imports from other countries is termed the balance of trade. In an
ideal situation, a country wants to bring in more money from exports than it
spends on imports. This situation is considered a positive balance of trade, or
a trade surplus. If, on the other hand, a country spends more for imports than
it takes in from exports, it has a negative balance of trade, or a trade deficit.
Unfortunately, the United States has been operating at a trade deficit since
the early 1970s.
If you have a product that’s suitable for exporting to other parts of the world,
the Department of Commerce is ready and willing to help you — actually far
more ready and willing than if you were wanting to import products. Go to
the DOC Web site at www.doc.gov to find out what’s available to you.
National debt
The United States as a whole hasn’t done much better than its individual
people about staying out of debt. For years, the United States has been run-
ning a national debt in the trillions of dollars, which means that the govern-
ment is spending much more than it’s taking in.
The U.S. government gets money to spend not by earning it the way you and I
do, but by selling various types of bonds. Perhaps you’ve even invested in
some of these savings bonds and treasury bonds. Each time the government
issues new bonds, it adds to the national debt. When you purchase a bond,
you’re actually lending the government your money, and the government
agrees to pay you interest on that money over a specified period of time so
you’ll get back more money than you put in.

veryone makes mistakes — and managers are no different than anyone
else (despite what some of them would like you to believe!). Although an
MBA or other business training can teach you proper and successful business
practices, you’ll have to deal with times when things go wrong — sometimes
very wrong. It’s okay to make mistakes — that’s how people learn. However, if
you make the same mistake over and over again, you have a problem. The real
trick to becoming an effective manager is to learn from your mistakes, avoid
them in the future, and help others in your organization to avoid them, too.
This chapter gives you a chance to review the ten biggest mistakes managers
make without actually having to make them yourself! The chapters of Part II
dive into management duties in deeper detail.
Taking Employees for Granted
A long-standing debate still rages on in the business world about who’s more
important: customers or the employees who serve them and produce the
products that they buy. You can say that without your customers, you have no
business (and many managers are quick to recite this mantra as they ask their
employees to work 60-hour weeks), but it’s just as true that without employees,
you have no business. Without recreating the debate here, we can safely say
that managers sometimes mistakenly take their employees for granted.

380
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Every employee wants to do a good job and be noticed and recognized by a
manager for his or her good work. When employees don’t get recognition
from their managers, they start to assume that the bosses don’t care, and
morale is sure to plummet. And when employee morale plummets, their per-
formance suffers and they start looking for new employers.
Don’t get so caught up in your managerial work and responsibilities that you
forget to tell your employees “thank you” for jobs well done. Let them know
that you care and are paying attention — early and often. They’ll respond to
your interest by being more productive and being happier employees. And
happy and productive employees produce happier customers and clients,
not to mention a healthier bottom line.
Taking Customers for Granted
Isolation from the customer — the person or company that buys your products
or services — can create real problems in your organization, especially when
it stems from managers and employees forgetting that their job is to serve
the customer, not the other way around.
A manager may assume that because a person or company is a customer
today, he/she/it will be around tomorrow, too. This is a very dangerous
assumption to make. Today, more than ever before, consumers have options
for where they spend their money. You have to earn your customers’ business
every day of the week; you can’t afford to leave it to chance.
Managers often have long lists of people or entities that they serve. At the
top of those lists should be customers and employees. Customers are at the
top because they pay the bills, and employees are at the top because they
directly serve the customers. Keeping both happy is a sure recipe for suc-
cess. (Chapter 15 will help you tap into the power that is the customer.)
Failing to Lead
People want not only firm and decisive leaders, but also a voice in the deci-
sions that they make. The best leaders seek input and information from
everyone in their organizations, and they take that input and info into
account when they make the decisions they’ve been hired to make. As the
poster above the desk of Dr. J. Robert Beyster — founder of the $8 billion sci-
ence and engineering firm Science Applications International Corporation
(SAIC) — said during every one of the 36 years he led his company and its
employees: “None of us is as smart as all of us.”

Leaders aren’t just born; they can be made. You can take some steps to
improve your leadership skills. For instance,
 Read books on the topic of leadership.
 Seek honest and candid feedback from your employees and peers.
 Practice your leadership skills at every opportunity. The more you exercise
your leadership muscles, the stronger they’ll get.
For more on the challenges of leadership, head to Chapter 6. Chapter 7 gives
you the lowdown on employee motivation.
Not Setting Clear Goals with Employees
Goals are nothing more than the steps employees take to achieve the organi-
zation’s vision. Also, goals act as tangible, measurable milestones for employees
to gauge their progress on the road to achieving the organization’s vision. Goals
give employees something to strive for — making their jobs more interesting
and fulfilling. Managers who fail to set clear goals to achieve the organization’s
vision end up with employees who are confused about their priorities and
what’s important. The employees may do things that seem important to them,
but they may not be doing the things the organization needs them to do.
Chances are, employees won’t be happy with this ambiguity, and you can bet
that managers won’t be happy because the employees won’t be heading in the
right direction.
Managers work with their employees to set clear and measurable goals — and
then hold their employees accountable for achieving them. As people achieve
goals, the organization moves closer and closer to the vision of its leaders.
Forgetting What It’s Like to Be a Worker
One of the most common complaints about managers is that, somewhere
along the way, they forget what it’s like to be a regular employee. They forget
how hard it is to deal with unruly customers; how tough it is to get a job done
with a computer that’s two generations out of date; or how tough it is to
cancel family vacation plans because of another “crisis” at work.

Chapter 22: Ten Biggest Mistakes Managers Make

Employees aren’t a manager’s slaves, servants, or children. The next time you
plan to do something that will put an employee in a bind or in an extreme
inconvenience, first put yourself in his or her shoes and then consider just how
important what you have in mind is to the organization. An employee should
understand if you ask him or her to work an occasional weekend here or there,
or if you need to squeeze just one more year out of that old computer due to
the budget. But if these inconveniences become habitual, something is wrong;
you need to step back and figure out what it is and how to fix it.
And don’t forget to look in the mirror — the problem may not be with your
employees, your manager, or your clients or customers, but with that person
looking back at you.
Stealing the Spotlight
A manager can wreck an organization by hogging the credit and stealing the
spotlight from his or her employees. People don’t want a boss who takes all
the credit for his or her employees’ accomplishments and who wants the
spotlight at all times. That is a time-tested recipe for creating employee
dissatisfaction and — ultimately — disengagement.
Don’t refuse to shine the spotlight on those hard-working men and women who
get things done in your organization. Share credit as often as you can and you’ll
find that your employees will step up and become more enthusiastic than ever.
Sidestepping Opportunities to Delegate
One of the biggest mistakes a manager can make is to fail to delegate in one
or both of the following ways:
 The responsibility for getting a task done. “Gee, I can get this job done
a lot faster and more accurately if I just do it myself.
 The authority to get a task done. “Susan, check with me before you
commit to that purchase.”
Managers who fail to delegate bog themselves down with work, become
dreaded micromanagers, and miss out on terrific opportunities to develop
their employees’ skills.
382
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Focus on doing the tasks that you’re uniquely responsible for (hiring, firing,
creating and executing budgets, and so forth) and allow employees to do the
jobs they’re uniquely responsible for. And be sure to delegate not only the
responsibility to get tasks done, but also the authority employees need to do
their jobs effectively and efficiently. They shouldn’t have to run to you to get
permission every time a decision needs to be made.
Communicating Too Little, Too Late
Communication is the lifeblood of any organization. And as the speed of busi-
ness continues to increase (and it will — you haven’t seen anything yet!), it’s
imperative that you dismantle and discard the barriers to communication
within your organization and create and reward a culture of communication.
Information is power, and far too many managers hoard information and give
it out to their employees only when it suits their purposes, if at all.
Organizations can no longer afford this behavior, if they ever could. In a time
when most companies have equal access to markets, capital, technology, and
personnel, the ability of your organization to identify the latest, most relevant
information, process it, and distribute it efficiently to all affected workers is a
definite competitive advantage. Make information available to the people who
need it — in real time and as completely as possible. If you aren’t getting vital
information to your employees, you can bet your competitors are getting it to
their employees.
Hiring Too Fast (And Firing Too Slow)
Hiring too fast is a common mistake managers make. Have you ever been in a
rush — a big rush — to fill a vacancy on your staff? For whatever reason, you
felt the need to streamline the hiring process — perhaps throwing it out the
window altogether — to get a warm body in an empty seat. But the flip side
of this problem — firing too slow — can be almost as bad. If you let an under-
performing employee linger on your staff, your other employees will begin to
wonder why you’re putting up with an underachiever — and your over-
achievers will begin to think about becoming underachievers, too.
When it comes time to hire a new employee, take the time to recruit and inter-
view a variety of candidates. Check their credentials and ask for references —
and then call them. Have the prospects come back for multiple interviews so
they can speak with other people in your organization with whom they’ll be
working. And when it comes time to fire an employee, don’t hesitate. Your
actions speak louder than words. What are your actions saying to your
employees? (For more on hiring and firing, see Chapter 8.)
383
Chapter 22: Ten Biggest Mistakes Managers Make

Forgetting to Have Fun
Having fun is one of the easiest ways to boost morale in an organization.
Work is serious stuff, so you have to make your workplace a fun place to be.
Think about it for a moment: If you spend just eight hours at the office each
workday (and many people spend much more, including lunch time, after-
hours social activities, off-site conferences and training, work brought home,
and the time spent commuting to and from work), you live almost a third of
your life at work or partaking in work-related activities.
Do what you can to give employees a chance to exercise their creativity while
they break up the monotony of their jobs, delighting and entertaining your
customers in the process. The good news? Having fun doesn’t have to be
expensive. In fact, the best ways to have fun often are the least expensive —
and they make work a blast for both employees and customers. For example,
management at Southwest Airlines looks for and encourages humor on the
job. If you fly Southwest, don’t be surprised if a flight attendant with a tray full
of cups “accidentally” trips in the aisle and sends the cups flying into your lap.
The cups are empty, of course, but the practical joke is always good for a
laugh — for passengers and for employees.

Ten Effective Ways to Market Your
Products and Services
In This Chapter
 Connecting to your customers through your marketing
 Establishing trust and long-lasting relationships
 Reaching your target customers over the Net
I
n today’s marketplace, customers are so used to advertising — whether in
the form of a television commercial or Web banner — that they don’t even
notice it anymore. In fact, unless you have the latest cure for obesity, wrinkles,
or a rotten love life, you can forget about a connection. Customers just will not
pay attention to your marketing efforts; that is, if you rely on traditional means
of advertising to mass markets.
In a Web 2.0 world — where anyone with a Web site and a video camera can
produce a commercial spot seen by millions — marketing is about giving
customers what they want, when they want it, and in the way they want it. You
can’t push products and services down customers’ throats anymore. This
chapter fills you in on some hot, innovative, and effective ways to get your
customers’ attention. (For more on marketing, you can soak up the information
in the chapters of Part IV.)
Build Trust with Your Customers
Certain customers may buy a product or service from you on impulse, with-
out knowing much about your company, but will they come back? To attract
the best customers to your business — those who generate referrals and buy
regularly from you — you have to build trust.

386
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
How do you build trust with your customers? Customers trust your business
when
 They sense that you know what you’re talking about.
 You give them a suggestion that actually works.
 You understand what they want and give it to them.
 You do what you say you’re going to do.
Trust is something your business has to earn, but the effort is worth it because
trust pays back big time in the form of loyal customers who tell their friends.
Tell an Interesting Story
To market your product or service effectively, you need to tell catchy stories
that make the news and capture people’s attention. For example, how did Ben
and Jerry’s crack the tough premium ice cream market? It wasn’t just
because the company has great ice cream. It was because it had a great story
to tell. Ben and Jerry’s is a Vermont company owned by people from Vermont
who put their hearts and souls into their ice cream. And they gave their ice
cream personality with creative names such as Cherry Garcia, Phish Food,
and Chunky Monkey.
Here’s another example: Southwest Airlines’ flamboyant attitude toward its
customers is legendary in the airline industry, and it’s one of the primary rea-
sons that Southwest has become such a successful company in a very tough
industry. Imagine being served drinks by Bermuda-shorts-clad Herb Kelleher,
the founder of the company, or having the traditionally boring flight security
lectures rapped by an energetic flight attendant.
Become Effective at Web Content
The primary reason customers come to your company’s Web site is for
information — they want to find out something, and find it quickly. To provide
effective information for your customers, you need to know who your customers
are. Your Web site’s tone should reflect what your customers feel comfortable
with. Unfortunately, this is precisely where most business Web sites fail their
customers, because they don’t know how to give customers what they want as
quickly and concisely as possible. Chapter 15 deals with getting to know your
customers.

Unless you want your Web site to come across dull as dishwater, you need to
develop a style and tone that matches your target customers. For example, a
Web site selling primarily to the New Millennial crowd (ages 16 to 24) should
have a completely different tone and look than one catering to business pro-
fessionals or retirees (see Chapter 2). And when it comes to text on a Web site,
less is more. The faster you can get your company’s message out, the sooner
your customers will click on the shopping-cart button and make their purchases.
Try to keep information on your site to fewer than about 500 words.
Utilize Affiliate Marketing
One of the best ways to creatively market your company and its
products/services is to market on the Internet. That in and of itself isn’t cre-
ative, but if you find interesting ways to link to other companies’ sites that
are compatible with yours — called affiliate marketing — that is creative. For
example, suppose your company is in the travel business; you target large
corporations to get their retreat and conference business. You should
approach the top retreat and conference companies and convince them to
put a link on their sites to your travel site, and vice versa. That way, when an
event planner at a large corporation is perusing conference sites, he or she
can easily come to your site to get the details and make travel arrangements.
Be careful about trying to be everything to everyone. You don’t want to put
links on Web sites that don’t show your company in a positive light. Likewise,
you don’t want ads for unrelated products and services on your site. If, for
example, your Web site is about do-it-yourself shelving, you don’t want to
confuse your customers with ads for videos or domain names.
Consider Mobile Marketing
Is it time for you to take your company’s marketing efforts to customers’
mobile devices? Actually, most of the research done so far has found that half
of customers are in favor of mobile marketing and half are against it. The half
who appreciate mobile marketing are the teens and 20-something groups, but
only when the information is relevant to their needs and interests and pre-
sented in a compelling way.
The Mobile Marketing Association (www.mmaglobal.com) believes that this
form of marketing reaches people when they have nothing better to do than to
look at their cell phones or PDAs (personal digital assistants). The question is,
how do you know if your target customers are happy to hear from you? You ask
them! Holding some group interviews should give you the answers you need.
387
Chapter 23: Ten Effective Ways to Market Your Products and Services

The only thing known for sure is that the 18- to 34-year-old age group has
their mobile devices with them all the time. They like music and video games.
So, if your marketing campaign is targeting this group and you can incorpo-
rate music and/or video games and send them to their mobile devices, you
may have a winner.
Give Your Product Away
So, you want to make a lot of money and you have a great product or service
to offer. Why not give it away to customers? No, we haven’t lost our minds;
we’re serious. That’s how Netscape started. Microsoft as well. This strategy
isn’t new; for example, Gillette, the razor company, followed this strategy
years ago. It gave away its razor knowing that its customers would continue
to come back to purchase the blades — the consumable part of the product.
You need to decide what you must sell and what you can give away. Every
company has something it can give away, even if only for a 90-day free trial.
Free sampling is the quickest way to get customers to try out your products
and services. Certainly the big consumer-products companies such as
Procter and Gamble know this because they spend millions each year to
sample new products and services to customers.
Just make sure that the product you give away has a consumable aspect to it
so that your customers need to come back to purchase new products — such
as new blades, new ink cartridges, or new coffee capsules.
Make Customers Your Marketing Stars
Your best customers are true testimonials to your company’s success, so
why not put them in the public spotlight and let them shine! For instance, if
you sell to other businesses, you can feature their companies and how they
use your products or services on your Web site, in your newsletters, and in
your television commercials.
Many successful companies, such as Microsoft, IBM, and Kinko’s, use this
marketing tactic. What better way to show everyone that your customers are
important to you? Let them benefit from your advertising along with your
company.
388
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Build Relationships, Not Sales
To be successful in business today, you need to build long-term relationships
with your customers and interact with them in ways that will make the rela-
tionships better for both parties. The nature of marketing has changed radi-
cally as a result of mass customization and technology, which have made it
possible to reach individual customers and give them exactly what they
want, when they want it (see Chapter 17 for more).
Building long-term relationships doesn’t mean sending customers question-
naires on a regular basis. You want to give customers easy and interesting
ways to converse with your business so you can really understand their
needs. For example, Lexus invites its best customers to a special black-tie
reception when its new models come out; Porsche, on the other hand, invites
its best customers to try out new models on the racetrack! During these
events, the companies can get feedback in a relaxed environment and make
sure that customers and salespeople interact as people. When it comes time
to purchase a new vehicle, the customers will want to deal with people they
know. In your business, look for ways to build long-term relationships, and
the sales will follow.
Get Your Customers Emotionally Involved
To get your customers to pay attention to what you’re selling, try using
advertisements that tell a quick but memorable story — a story that gets
your customers emotionally involved. If you’re fortunate enough to be selling
a product that gets people excited while it just sits on the shelf (how about
that iPod you just bought), this advice isn’t for you. However, most busi-
nesses sell products that don’t generate a lot of enthusiasm without some
effort on their part.
For example, Home Depot came up with a marketing plan to try to sell power
tools to husbands who want to convince their wives that they need them. In a
commercial, a husband points to a power drill and proclaims, “This is your new
kitchen!” The ad definitely makes a strong case for the purchase of a pretty
boring item. You can make any product or service interesting and connect
emotionally with your customers if you look at the product or service in a 
new way.
389
Chapter 23: Ten Effective Ways to Market Your Products and Services

Go Local in a Global World
Finding products and services anywhere in the world is fairly easy in this age
of connectivity. Just go online to a search engine, type in a product that you
want, and up it pops. So, business owners who want their products and
services to rank high in the search engines optimize their Web sites by using
keywords so that what they offer comes up high on the search engines’ lists
when customers search for those keywords. That’s great if you don’t care if
your customers are in Boston or Borneo. But, what if you want to serve a
local region or a specific country?
In this case, you don’t want to have to deal with people in other parts of the
world. One thing you can do is to make sure that you recognize who you’re
serving. Every region has its own linguistic differences, so the keywords that
customers use to search for products or services may be different. For
example, in the United States, a customer may search for “labor-saving
device,” while in the United Kingdom, a customer would type in “labour-saving
device.” That small difference in spelling can make it easier for your U.K.
customer to find you, and it demonstrates that you’re thinking locally while
dealing with customers globally.

Ten (Or So) Steps to Improve 
Your Cash Flow
In This Chapter
 Exploring immediate or advance payment
 Holding onto your money as long as you can
 Checking your paperwork and tightening your processes
C
ash flow is nothing more than the net result of the money that comes
into your organization less the money that goes out. The less money
that goes out, the better your cash flow. Each of the suggestions in this chap-
ter helps you better manage your cash flow.
Manage Your Accounts Receivable
If you aren’t keeping a close eye on your accounts receivable, you’re missing
a terrific opportunity to improve your cash flow and the health of your busi-
ness. No matter how much you love your customers (and businesses do love
their customers!), some of them invariably don’t understand how important
it is to you that they pay their bills on time. A day or two late usually isn’t a
big deal. A month or two late always is a big deal. As soon as your customers
get in the habit of paying late, getting them to pay on time can be almost
impossible. You have to identify your late payers as soon as you can and then
take steps to get them to pay promptly.
Require Instant (Or Advance) Payment
If you don’t already do so, requiring payment on delivery or even in advance
will definitely be worth your while. Make this one of your company’s standard
policies, and don’t apologize to your customers for requiring payment before

392
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
you start work. We can think of another situation that’s even better: getting
paid in advance. Many businesses require deposits, retainers, and other forms
of advance payment as a normal part of doing business. If you’ve had an addi-
tion built onto your house or new windows or a roof installed, you know that
building contractors often require deposits before they start to work. 
Accept and Encourage Credit Card Use
Have you noticed that most online stores require customers to provide payment
at the time of transaction, and that they generally ask consumers to pay with
credit/debit cards? This isn’t an accident. You’ll not only get more sales if you
accept credit cards (don’t forget, credit cards aren’t real money, right?!), but
you’ll also get your money more quickly than if you simply send out invoices.
(Note: Extensive research by the credit-card industry shows that companies
that accept credit cards enjoy up to 40 percent more sales than those that don’t.)
You’ll have to pay your credit card company or bank a fee for the privilege
(fees vary widely from provider to provider — be sure to shop around before
you sign up for a plan), but most companies have found that the additional
sales generated and the enhanced cash flow more than make up for the fees.
A number of online payment services are available that can accept credit
cards from customers on your behalf and then deposit the funds for your
products/services directly into your bank account. Perhaps the best known
of these services is PayPal (www.paypal.com). PayPal and similar providers
charge fees of their own, but the charges tend to be lower than what you’d
pay through a bank or other credit-card-processing service.
Hold Onto Your Money
Every invoice has a due date. Whereas some businesses may require pay-
ment 30 days after delivering an invoice, others may require payment in only
15 days or less. Why do they do this? Because they want to make sure they
have healthy cash flows! Of course, the idea is to make sure that you take
care of your company’s cash flow first and worry about someone else’s later.
How do you do this? By holding onto your money as long as you can. By wait-
ing to pay until payment is due, you’ll have the benefit of your cash longer,
and you’ll positively impact your cash flow. Now, don’t get us wrong: You
should always pay your bills on time. If you want happy vendors — and if you
want to avoid pesky calls from bill collectors — don’t make a habit of paying
invoices after they’re due. But we also advise that you don’t get in the habit
of paying your bills sooner than you have to.

Make Sure Your Invoices Are Correct
Before you send out your invoices, make sure that they’re absolutely correct.
Check to see that the items provided and the quantities are correct. And
while you’re at it, make sure you have them addressed to the right place and
the right person. When invoices go to the wrong places or people, they tend
to sit around unpaid or, worse, quickly find their way into the trash. If you
want to get paid sooner rather than later (and we’re sure you do), double-
check all your invoices before they hit the mailbox.
Many companies simply reject invoices that have mistakes in them. Believe it
or not, they won’t call you first to ask why you made the mistake, and they
probably won’t send you an e-mail asking for clarification. They’ll simply
reject the invoice. And if an invoice is rejected, it won’t be paid, and it may
not even be returned to you. After all, the company you invoiced also is
taking advantage of a preceding tip (don’t pay sooner than you have to). And
by sending an incorrect invoice, you’re giving the business an easy way to
extend the payment time without breaking the rules.
Give Prompt-Payment Discounts
You give a prompt-payment discount when you allow a customer to decrease a
payment by some set percentage — say, 1 percent — for paying an invoice
within a specific period of time (usually 10 or 20 days). Offering a prompt-
payment discount to your customers can be a powerful incentive for them to
accelerate their payments, thus improving your cash flow. In many cases, this
positive impact on their cash flows exceeds the small amount of money the
companies lose in extending the discounts.
Prompt-payment discounts can allow you to experiment and have fun. First,
start with the standard net/30 payment terms (all the money must be paid
within 30 days) and analyze the average time your clients take to pay. Next,
offer a minimal prompt-payment discount to your clients — perhaps 0.5
percent/20 days — and see what happens. Be sure to publicize the discount
prominently on the invoices so the right people notice. Does the average time
your clients take to pay change? As soon as you hit on the right combination
of discount and time, stick with it, and watch your cash flow improve!
393
Chapter 24: Ten (Or So) Steps to Improve Your Cash Flow 

Follow Up on Late Payments
If you decide that you’ve waited long enough for payment, don’t be shy about
following up on it. You can follow up in a few different ways, each one down
the list a bit more serious:
 By note: If the amount owed isn’t very much and the invoice isn’t long
overdue, a friendly note on a copy of the invoice may be sufficient to
motivate payment.
 By e-mail or snail mail: If the payment is dragging on and you want to get
more serious than a simple note on an invoice, you should send an e-mail
message or a letter to your customer specifically requesting payment.
 By phone: When your patience has run out — and you want to head off a
potential payment crisis — the most effective way to encourage prompt
payment is to personally pick up the phone and call your customer
directly.
Be respectful but be firm. The sooner you follow up on late payments, the better
your customers will understand that you make prompt payment a priority, and
the more likely they’ll be to pay on time in the future.
Keep Track of Your Expenses
One way to reduce the amount of money that flows out of your organization —
which improves your cash flow — is to manage your expenses. Only spend
money if you absolutely have to. Think you need a new computer? Why not try
to get another year out of your old one? Or maybe you can upgrade the mother-
board for a small amount of money. Perhaps you can find an inexpensive used —
but more up-to-date — computer online, at a site such as Craigslist (www.
craigslist.com), for instance.
Here’s one more component of managing your expenses: projecting your cash
inflows and trying to match them with your cash outflows. This money
management can really pay off. For example, if you expect a big payment from a
reliable customer two months from now, you should defer all possible expenses
until you have that cash in hand. That way, you’ll avoid the dreaded cash
crunch that can occur when you spend more money than you have available.
