FOREWORD 
This Student Guide i s  exceptional, maybe even unique, among such guides 
i n  t h a t  its author, Fred Soon, was a c t u a l l y  a student user of t h e  textbook 
during one of the years we were writing and debugging the book. 
(He was one 
of the best students t h a t  year, by the way.) 
Because of h i s  background, Fred 
has taken, i n  t h e  Guide, t h e  point of view of an experienced student t u t o r  
helping you t o  l e a r n  calculus. 
lJhile we do not always think Fred's jokes a r e  
a s  funny a s  he does, we appreciate h i s  enthusiasm and h i s  d e s i r e  t o  e n t e r  i n t o  
communication with h i s  readers; since we nearly always agree with t h e  mathe- 
matical judgements he has made i n  explaining the material, we believe t h a t  
t h i s  Guide can serve you a s  a valuable supplement t o  our t e x t .  
To get maximum b e n e f i t  from t h i s  Guide, you should begin by spending a 
few moments t o  acquaint yourself with its s t r u c t u r e .  
Once you get s t a r t e d  i n  
the course, take advantage of t h e  many opportunities which t h e  t e x t  and Student 
Guide together provide f o r  learning calculus i n  t h e  only way t h a t  any mathe- 
matical subject can t r u l y  be mastered - through attempting t o  solve problems 
on your own. 
As you read t h e  t e x t ,  t r y  doing each example and exercise your- 
s e l f  before reading the solution; do the same with the quiz problems provided 
by Fred. 
Fred Soon knows our textbook b e t t e r  than anyone with t h e  (possible) ex- 
ception of ourselves, having spent hundreds of hours over t h e  past t e n  years 
a s s i s t i n g  us with its c r e a t i o n  and proofreading. 
We have enjoyed our associa- 
t i o n  with him over t h i s  period, and we hope now t h a t  you, too, w i l l  b e n e f i t  
from h i s  e f f o r t s .

HOW TO USE THIS BOOK 
As the title implies,fhisbook is intended to guide the student's study 
of calculus. Realizing that calculus is not the only class on the college 
student's curriculum, my objective in writing this book is to maximize under- 
standing with a minimum of time and effort. 
For each new section of the text, this student guide contains sections 
entitled Prerequisites, Prerequisite Quiz, Goals, Study Hints, Solutions to 
Every Other Odd Exercise, Section Quiz, Answers to Prerequisite Quiz, and 
Answers to Section Quiz. For each review section, I have included the solu- 
tions to every other odd exercise and a chapter test with solutions. 
A list of prerequisites, if any, is followed by a short quiz to help 
you decide if you're ready to continue. If some prerequisite seems vague to 
you, review material can be found in the section or chapter of the text listed 
after each prerequisite. If you have any difficulty with the simple prerequi- 
site quizzes, you may wish to review. 
As you study, keep the goals in mind. They may be used as guidelines 
and should help you to grasp the most important points. 
The study hints are provided to help you use your time efficiently. 
Comments have been offered to topics in the order in which they appear in the 
text. I have tried to point out what is worth memorizing and what isn't. If 
time permits, it is advisable to learn the derivations of formulas rather than 
just memorizing them. You will find that the course will be more meaningful 
Copyright 1985 Springer-Verlag. All rights reserved.

to you and that critical parts of a formula can be recalled even under the 
stress of an exam. Other aspects of the study hints include clarification of 
text material and "tricks" which will aid you in solving the exercises. 
Finally, please be aware that your instructor may choose to emphasize topics 
which I have considered less important. 
Detailed solutions to every other odd exercise, i.e., 1,5,9, etc. are 
provided as a study aid. Some students may find it profitable to try the 
exercises first and then compare the method employed in this book. Since the 
authors of the text wrote most of the exercises in pairs, the answers3nthis 
book may also be used as a guide to solving the corresponding even exercises. 
In order to save space, fractions have been written on one line, so be care- 
ful about your interpretations. Thus, llx + y means y plus l/x , whereas 
l/(x + y) means the reciprocal of x + y . Transcendental functions such as 
cos, sin, In, etc. take precedence over division, so cos ax/b means take the 
cosine of ax and then divide by b , whereas cos (ax/b) has an unambiguous 
meaning. In a/2 means half of In a , not the natural logarithm of a/2 . 
Also, everything in the term after the slash is in the denominator, so 
1/2fxdx + 1 means add 1 to the reciprocal of Zjxdx . It does not mean 
add 1 to half of the integral. The latter would be denoted (1/2)(xdx 
+ 1 . 
Section quizzes are included for you to evaluate your mastery of the 
material. Some of the questions are intended to be tricky, so do not be dis- 
couraged if you miss a few of them. Theanswerstothese "hard"questions should 
add to your knowledge and prepare you for your exams. Since most students seem 
to fear word problems, each quiz contains at least one word problem to help 
you gain familiarity with this type of question. 
Finally, answers have been provided to both the prerequisite and section 
quizzes. If you don't understand how to arrive at any of the answers, be sure

t o  ask your i n s t r u c t o r .  
I n  t h e  review s e c t i o n s ,  I have w r i t t e n  more questions and answers which 
may appear on a t y p i c a l  t e s t .  
These may be used along with t h e  s e c t i o n  quizzes 
t o  h e l p  you study f o r  your t e s t s .  
Since Calculus was intended f o r  a t h r e e  semester course, I have a l s o  
included three-hour comprehensive exams a t  t h e  end of Chapters 3 ,  6, 9, 12, 
15, and 18. 
These should help you prepare f o r  your midterms and f i n a l  
examinations. 
Best of luck with a l l  of your s t u d i e s .

PREREQUISITES 
1. 
Thereareno prerequisites for this section other than some high school 
algebra and geometry; however, if the material presented in this section 
is new to you, it would be a good idea to enroll in a precalculus course. 
This section is intended to be a review. 
PREREQUISITE QUIZ 
1. 
Orientation quizzes A and B in the text will help you evaluate your 
preparation for this section and this course. 
GOALS 
1. 
Be able to factor and expand common mathematical expressions. 
2. 
Be able to complete a square. 
3. 
Be able to use the quadratic formula. 
4. 
Be able to solve equations and inequalities. 
Copyright 1985 Springer-Verlag. All rights reserved.

2 Section R.l 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Common identities. Know how to factor a2 - b2 . It is a good idea to 
memorize the expansion of (a + b)2 
and (a + b13 . Note that (a - b) 2 
can be obtained by substituting -b for b . (a - b13 can be similarly 
expanded. These identities are useful for computing limits in Section 1.2 
and Chapter 11 . 
2. 
Factoring. This is a technique that is learned best through practice. A 
good starting point is to find all integer factors of the last term (the 
constant term). 
Once you find a factor for the original polynomial, use 
long division to find a simpler polynomial to factor. This will be impor- 
tant for partial fractions in Chapter 10 and for computing limits. 
3. 
Completing the square. Don't memorize the formula. Practice until you 
learn the technique. Note that adding ( b / ~ a ) ~  
to x2 + bx/a forms a 
perfect square. This technique will be very important for integration 
techniques introduced in Chapter 10. 
4 .  
Quadratic formula. - It is recommended that you memorize this formula. It. 
is used in many applications in various disciplines such as engineering, 
economics, medicine, etc. This formula may also be used to solve equa- 
4 
2 
tions of the form Ax + Bx + C = 0 by solving for y = x2 and taking 
square roots to get x . 
5. 
Square roots. Note that, unless otherwise stated, square roots are under- 
stood to be nonnegative. J?j is equal to zero. 
6. 
Inequalities. It is essential to have a good handle on manipulating 
inequalities. Without this, you will not have a good understanding of 
some of the basic theory of calculus. Don't forget to reverse the direc- 
tion of the inequality sign when you multiply by a negative number.

SOLUTIONS TO EVERY OTHER ODD EXERCISE 
1. 
816 - 914 = -11112 
i s  a r a t i o n a l  number. 
Since the denominator cannot 
be reduced t o  one, i t  is neither a n a t u r a l  number nor an integer. 
5. 
( a - 3 ) ( b + c )  - ( a c + 2 b )  = ( a b - 3 b + a c - 3 c )  - ( a c + 2 b )  = a b - 5 b - 3 c .  
2 
9. 
We can use Example 2 with b 
replaced by 
-b 
t o  get a3 + 3a (-b) + 
2 
2 
3a(-b) 
+ (-b)3 = a3 - 3a b + 3ab2 - b3 . Alternatively, write (a - b) 
= 
2 
2 
( a  - b) ( a  - b) = (a2 -2ab + b ) ( a  - b) = a3 - 3a2b + 3ab2 - b3 . 
13. 
We know t h a t  
(x + a )  (x + b) = x2 + ( a  + b)x + ab . The f a c t o r s  of 
6 
a r e  '1 , Q , +3 , and 
'6 . By choosing 
a = 2 
and 
b = 3 , we 
get 
a + b = 5 .  Thus, 
x 2 + 5 x + 6 =  ( x + 2 ) ( x + 3 )  . 
17. 
F i r s t  we f a c t o r  out 
3 t o  get 3(x2 - 2x - 8) . We know t h a t  the fac- 
t o r s  of 
-8 
a r e  +1 , +2 , 54 , and 
28 . As i n  Exercise 13, we 
look f o r  a 
and 
b 
so t h a t  
(a + b)x is t h e  middle term. 
I n  t h i s  case, 
a = -4 
and 
b = 2 . Thus, 
3x2 - 6x - 24 = 3(x - 4 ) ( x + 2 )  . 
21. 
2(3x - 7) - (4x - 10) = 0 s i m p l i f i e s  t o  (6x - 14) - (4x - 10) = 
2x - 4 = 0 , i . e . ,  
2x = 4 . Dividing by 
2 y i e l d s  x = 2 . 
2 
25. 
The right-hand s i d e  is (x - 1) (x + x + 1) = x(x2 + x + 1) - 1 (x2 + x + 1) = 
2 
x3 + x  + X  - x2 - x - 1 = x3 - 1 , which i s  the left-hand side. 
29. 
(a) 
By factoring, we get x2 + 5x + 4 = (x + 4) (x + 1) = 0 . I f  any 
f a c t o r  equals zero, t h e  equation is solved. 
Thus, 
x = -4 
or x = -1 . 
2 
(b) 
By using the method of completing the square, we get 
0 = x + 5x + 4 = 
(x2 + 5x + 2514) + (4 - 2514) = (x + 5 1 2 ) ~  - 914 . Rearrangement 
y i e l d s  
(x + 512) 
= 914 , and taking square r o o t s  gives x + 5 12 = 
2312 . Again, 
x = -4 
o r  -1 . 
(c) 
a = 1 , b = 5 , and 
c = 4 , so t h e  quadratic formula gives

33. We use the quadratic formula with a = -1 , b = 5 , and c = 0.3 . 
This gives x = (-52425 + 1.2) / (-2) = (5 + m) 
/2 . These are the 
two solutions for x . 
2 
37. x2 + 4 = 3x - x is equivalent to 0 = 2x2 - x - 4 . Using the quadratic 
formula with a = 2 , b = -1 , and c = -4 , we get x = (1 + m
)
/
4
 
(1 lt 43314 . 
41. We apply the quadratic formula with a = 2 , b = 2 6  , and c = 712 to 
get x = ( 2 n  + -114 
= 4712 . Thus, the only solution is x = Jf/2 
45. We add b to both sides to obtain a + c > 2c . Then we subtract c to 
get a > c . 
2 
49. b(b + 2) > (b + 1) (b + 2) is equivalent to b2 + 2b > b + 3b + 2 . 
2 
Subtracting b + 2b from both sides leaves 0 > b + 2 . Subtracting 2 
yields - 2 > b .  
53. (a) Dividing through by a in the general quadratic equation yields 
x2 + (b/a)x + c/a = 0 . Add and subtract (b12a)~ to get 
2 
(4ac/4a2 - b2/4a2) , i. e., (x + b/2a) = (b2 - 4ac) /4a . Taking 
square roots gives x + b/2a = ?-/2a 
, and finally 
(b) From the quadratic formula, we see that there are no solutions if 
b2 - 4ac < 0 . If b2 - 4ac > 0 , there are two distinct roots. 
However, if b2 - 4ac = 0 , there are two roots, which both equal 
-b/2a . This only occurs if b2 = 4ac .

GOALS 
1. 
Be able to express intervals using symbols. 
2. 
Be able to manipulate absolute values in equations and inequalities. 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Notation. A black dot means that the endpoint is included in the 
interval. In symbols, a square bracket like this "[It 
or like this "1" 
is used. A white circle means that the endpoint is not included in the 
interval; it is represented by a parenthesis like this "(" 
or this ")". 
2. 
More notation. In the solution to Example 3, some students will get lazy 
and write the solution as -1 > x > 3 . This gives the implication that 
-1 > 3 , which is false. 
3. 
Inequalities involving absolute values. Study Example 5 carefully. 
Such inequalities are often used in Chapter 11. Note that Ix - 81 ( 3 
is the same as -3 < x - 8 5 3 . 
4. 
Triangle inequality. Ix + 
1 5 I x 1 + 1

will be useful in proving limit 
theorems in Chapter 11. The name is derived from the fact that two sides 
of a triangle are always longer than the third side.

There are no prerequisites for this section beyond some high school algebra; 
however, if the material presented in this section is new to you, it would 
be a good idea to enroll in a precalculus course. This section is intended

GOALS 
1. 
Be able to simplify expressions involving exponents. 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Integer exponents. The laws of exponents should be memorized. The 
"common sense" method preceding Example 1 serves as a useful check if 
you are unsure of your answer; however, it can slow you down during an 
exam. 
2. 
Definitions. Know that b-n = l/bn , bO = 1 , and b1ln = n& . 
3. 
Rational exponents. These laws are the same as those for integer powers. 
4. 
Rationalization. Example 6 demonstrates a technique which is useful in 
the study of limits. The idea is to use the fact that (a + b)(a - b) = 
a2 - b2 to eliminate radicals from the denominator.

years and the factor is 2.2 = 4 . In thirty years, the factor is 
202.2 = 8 , and in 50 years, the factor of increase is 2.2-2.202 = 32 . 
29. The first term factors into &*& 
and (& + a)(&

(a + b)& 
+ ab . The last term has factors tl , t2 , t4 , and t8 . 
We want factors a and b such that ab = -8 and a + b = -2 . Thus 
a = -4 and b = 2 . Therefore, the solution is (& - 4) (& + 2) = 
(X1I2 - 4) (X1l2 + 2) . 
33. We will use the corresponding rule for integer powers several times. 
mklnl = nl&iyiq , 
let p = mln and q = k/l , so bPq = b(m/n) (k/l) = 
Thus, rasing the equation to the nl power gives (bPq)nl = bmk . 
Now, (bP) 
= (bmln) k/l = 
, so ( (bP) q)nl = (I/=) 
ln = 
((nm)k)n 
= (nm)nk 
= ((nm)n)k 
= (bm)k = bmk . Therefore, (bPq)*l = 
((bP)q)nl , and taking the nlth root of both sides gives Rule 2.

1. 
Be able to find the distance between two points. 
2. 
Be able to write and manipulate equations of the line in its various 
f oms. 
3. 
Be able to write the equation for perpendicular lines. 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Distance formula. Don't be concerned about which point is (xl,yl) 
and which is (x2,y2) . The squaring process eliminates the need to 
make such a distinction. 
Remembering that the formula is derived 
from the Pythagorean theorem makes it easier to recall. 
2. 
Slope formula. As with the distance formula, don't be concerned 
about which point is (xl ,yl) and which is (x2, y2) . The sign will 
correct itself when the division is performed. 
3. 
Point-slope form. Replacing (x2,y2) by (x,y) gives the slope as 
m = (y - yl)/(x - xl) . Rearrangement yields y = yl + m(x - xl). 
4. 
Slope- intercept form. Choosing (xl,yl) = (0,b) in the point-slope 
form of the line yields y = mx + b . 
5. 
Point-point form. Substituting m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) yields 
Y = Y1 + [(y2 - y1)I(x2 - xl)l(x - xl).

6. 
Perpendicular lines. Many instructors try to write harder exam 
problems by asking for equations of lines perpendicular to a given 
line, so you will benefit by remembering that slopes of perpendicular 
lines are negative reciprocals of each other, i.e., if a line has 
slope m , then the perpendicular line has slope -l/m .

GOALS 
1. 
Be able to recognize equations for circles and parabolas, and be able

2. 
Be able to solve simultaneous equations to find intersection points. 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Circles. The general equation is (x - a)' 
+ (y - b)' 
= r2 , where 
(a,b) is the center of the circle and r is the radius. Any equation 
2 
of the form Ax + ~y~ + Bx + Cy + D = 0 may be written in the general 
form of a circle by completing the square. If r2 > 0 , then the 
equation describes a circle. The coefficient of x2 and y2 must be 
the same. 
2. 
Parabolas. The general equation is y - q = a(x - p12 , where (p,q) 
is the vertex. The parabola opens upward if a > 0 , downward if 
a < 0 . The graphs of all quadratic equations of the form y = ax2 + 
bx + c are parabolas. 
3. 
Simultaneous equations. The solutions represent points of intersection. 
One method of solution is to multiply equations by a constant factor and 
then subtract equationstoeliminate a variable as in Example 6 . The 
other method uses substitution to eliminate a variable as in Example 7.

2 
in (0,l) yields 1 + (-3)2 = r2 = 10,

so the desired equation is (x + 112 + 
2 
( ~ - 4 ) ~ = 1 0  
or x + 2 x + y 2 - 8 y + 7 = O .  
Y+ 
We complete the square to find the center and 
radius. -x2 - y 2 + 8 x - 4 y  - 1 1 = O  is 
2 
equivalent to x + y2 - 8x + 4y + 11 = 0 ,

2 
2 
-11 + 16 + 4 = 9 = (X - 4) + ( y  + 2) . 
Thus, the center is (4,-2) and the radius 
is 3 . 
The parabola with vertex at (p,q) has the general equation y - q = 
a(x - p)2 . In this case, y - 5 = a(x - 5)2 . Substituting (0,O) 
yields -5 = a(-512 , so a = -115 and the equation becomes y = 
2 
-(x - 512/5 + 5 = -x /5 + 2x .

20 Section R.5 
We complete the square to get the form 
y - q = a(x - p)2 , where (p,q) is 
2 
the vertex. y = -2x + 8x - 5 implies 
2 
(y + 5) - 8 = -2(x2 - 4x + 4) = -2(x - 2) 
= 
y - 3 . Thus, the vertex is (2,3) and 
since a = -2 < 0 , the parabola opens 
downward. 
2 
y 6 -6x + 8 is the same as y - 8 = 
-6 (x - o ) ~  . This has the form y - q = 
a(x - p) * , so the vertex is (p ,q) or 
(0,8) . Since a = -6 < 0 , the parabola 
opens downward. 
To find the point of intersection, solve 
the equations simultaneously. -2x + 7 = 
y = 5x + 1 implies 6 = 7x , i.e., x = 617 . 
Substituting back into one of the equations, 
+ 
x 
we get y = 5(6/7) + 1 = 3717 , so the point 
of intersection is (617,3717) . 
To graph the equations, we see that 
y = -2x + 7 is a line with slope -2 and y-intercept 7. y = 5x + 1 has 
slope 5 and y-intercept 1.

To find the point of intersection, solve the

R.6 Functions and Graphs 
PREREQUISITES 
1. 
There are no special prerequisites for this section; however,if the 
material presented in this section is new to you, it would be a good 
idea to enroll in a precalculus course. This section is intended to 
be a review. 
GOALS 
1. 
Be able to evaluate a function at a given point. 
2. 
Be able to sketch a graph by plotting. 
3. 
Be able to recognize the graph of a function. 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Teminology. Sometimes, x and y are referred to as the independent 
and dependent variables, respectively. A good way to remember this is 
that normally x is chosen independently and then, the value of y 
de~ends on x . 
2. 
Calculator errors. A calculator is accurate only up to a certain 
number of digits. Round-off errors may accumulate, so be careful! 
Calculators do not always give the correct answer. 
3. 
Domain. The domain of a function f is simply all of the x values 
for which f(x) 
is defined. Note the emphasis on 3; 
it is not can be . 
- 
4. 
More on terminology. Although many of us may get sloppy with the 
useage of f , f(x) , and the graph of f , you should know their 
distinctions. f is the function itself. f(x) 
refers to the func- 
tion value when the variable is x; the variable may just as well be any 
other letter. Finally, the graph of f is a drawing which depicts f .

Section R.6 25 
5. 
Graphing. For now, just be aware that plotting points at smaller 
intervals gives a more accurate drawing. 
6. 
Calculator plotting. A programmable calculator can be very useful 
for plotting Fig. R.6.8. 
Depending on your calculator, a variation 
of the following program may be used. 1- 
a 
i - J j T J I J ~ @ ~ @ / - ' J @ / = J ~ ~ ~ ~ .  
x2 is 
used twice to represent x4 because most calculators will not raise 
negative numbers to a power other than two. 
7. 
Graphs of functions. Another way of recognizing graphs of functions 
is to retrace the curve starting from the left. If you do not have 
to go straight up or down, or go backwards to the left, then the 
graph depicts a function.

The domain of a function are the x-values for which there exists y-values. 
In this case, we need the expression under the radical sign to be non- 
negative. We want 1 - x2 2 0 , so the domain is -1 < x < 1 . 
f (10) is not real.

We complete the square as follows: 
y = 5x2 - 2x = 5(x2 - 2x15 + 1/25) - 115 = 
5 (x - 1/51 - 115 . This is a parabola 
opening upwards with vertex at (1/5,-115) .

1. 
Definitions. Average velocity is the ratio of distance travelled to 
time elapsed over a period of time. Instantaneous velocity is the 
same ratio as the time period approaches zero. In more general sit- 
uations, average velocity corresponds to average rate of change and 
instantaneous velocity corresponds to the instantaneous rate of change. 
2. 
Definition of derivative. Know that Ay/Ax for Ax approaching zero 
is the derivative. Also, notice that Ay = f(x + Ax) - f(x) . 
3. 
Cancelling Ax . If, in working out Ay/Ax , Ax can not be cancelled 
from the denominator, you should suspect a computational error in most 
cases. Be sure you know how to use the definition to find the derivative. 
4. 
Physical interpretation. Instantaneous velocity and slope of the tan- 
gent line are some of the many names that the derivative specializes to 
in specific situations. 
5. 
Notation. Familiarize yourself with fl(x) . 
6. 
Quadratic function rule. Memorize the formula for now. A more general 
formula will be memorized in Section 1.4 which will subsume this one. 
Note what happens if a = 0 
or if a and b are both 0 ; the linear 
and constant function rules result.

The vertex of the parabola is the point where the derivative is 
zero. By the quadratic function rule, fl(x) = 2x - 16 , which 
is zero at xo = 8 . Substitution gives y = (8)2 - 16(8) + 2 = 
-62 , so the desired point is (8,-62) . 
(b) Algebraically, the vertex occurs at the highest or lowest point, 
which may be found by completing the square. y = (x2 - 16x + 64) + 
(2 - 64) = (x - 8)2 - 62 . (x - 812 is zero for x = 8 and 
positive otherwise, so the parabola has its lowest point at x = 8 . 
By the quadratic function rule, the derivative of axZ + bx + c 
is 
2ax + b . Here, a = 1 , b = 3 , and c = -1 , so fl(x) = 2x + 3 . 
By the quadratic function rule, the derivative of at2 + bt + c is 
2at + b . Here, a = -4 , b = 3 , and c = 6 , so g'(t) 
= 
-8t + 3 . 
As in Example 8, the best time to make the jump is when the velocities 
are equal. We want to equate the derivatives: 4t + 3 = 6t + 1 . 
Therefore, the jump should be made at t = 1 . 
Here, fl(x) = 2x , so f'(3) = 6 . 
Expanding, k(y) = y2 - 3y - 28 , so k'(y) 
= 2y - 3 and kt(-1) = -5 .

(8xAx+4(Ax)

By the quadratic function rule, fl(x) = 
6x + 4 , so fl(l) = 10 . Since f(1) = 
9 , the point-slope form of the line yields 
y =  9+10(x-1) 
or y = l O x - 1 .  By 
Example 7, the vertex of a parabola occurs 
where fl(xo) = 0 . In this case 6x + 4 = 0 
65. 
If f (x) = xL , f ' (x) = 2x , so the slope 
of the tangent line is 2R ; therefore, the 
2 
perpendicular line is y = R + [- &] (x - R) . 
2 
This line crosses x = 0 at y = R + 112 . 
2 
The horizontal crosses at y = R , so the 
distance is 112 . 
69. (a) Let f (t) = 24.5t - 4.9t2 . The velocity at time t is f '(t) . 
By the quadratic function rule, fl(t) = 2(-4.9)t + 24.5 , i.e., 
fl(t) = -9.8t + 24.5 . Substituting different values of t , we 
have the velocity at t = 0,1,2,3,4,5 equal to 24.5, 14.7, 4.9, -4.9, 
-14.7, -24.5 meterslsec, respectively. 
2 
(b) f (t) = 24.5t - 4.9t2 = -4.9(t - 2.5) + 30.625 is a parabola 
facing downward. The highest point is at the vertex when t = 2.5 sec. 
(c) Thp velocity is equal to zero when -9.8t + 24.5 = 0 , i.e., t = 
2.5 see. This result is consistent with part (b). 
(d) The ball strikes the ground when f(t) = 0 . Solving for 24.5t - 
2 
4.9t = 0 gives t = 5 sec.

STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Cautions about limits. lim 
x-ta f(x) 
depends on what happens around x = a , 
not what happens at x = a . Also, the limiting value must be approached 
from both sides of x = a , not just one side. Example 2 demonstrates 
these points well. 
Copyright 1985 Springer-Verlag. All rights reserved.

Section 1.2 43 
2. 
Basic properties of limits. Know how to use these statements for com- 
puting limits. Most of them are intuitively obvious, so there is no need 
to memorize. You should take a few moments to convince yourself that 
these statements are correct. 
3. 
Replacement rule. This rule merely states that limits of equivalent 
functions are equal. The method of Example 3(b) is commonly used on 
test questions. The idea is to cancel common factors to leave a nonzero 
denominator. Usually, one of the factors is (x - a) if we want to find 
the limit as x approaches a (See Example 5(a)). 
4 .  
Continuity defined. This is a very important concept in mathematics. 
Notice that lim 
x-t Xo f(x) 
must exist and that it must equal f(x0) 
if 
f is continuous at x 0 '  
5. 
Rational functions. These functions, polynomials or quotients of poly- 
nomials, are continuous at xO if the denominator does not equal zero. 
Their limits may be computed at xo by "substituting" x = x . however, 
0 '  
be sure the function is rational before applying this rule. 
6. 
Limits of infinity. Example 8(a) shows the important fact that 
1 im 
+ ,m 
(l/x) = 0 . To compute limits at infinity, divide numerator and 
denominator by an appropriate power of x so that all except for one 
term in the denominator approaches zero. See Example 8, parts (b) and (c) . 
7 .  
Terminology. "Limit does not exist" can either mean the limit is approach- 
ing infinity or that no particular value is being approached as x ap- 
proaches Xo '

44 Section 1.2 
8. 
One-sided limit. Notice that in Example 7, no limit exists at zero. 
However, as we approach zero from either the left or the right, the func- 
tion does approach a certain value. This is the concept of one-sided 
limits. More details will come later in this course.

Let f(x) = (x3 - 3 x 2 + 5 x -  3)/(x-

Section 1.3 51 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Derivative defined. It is defined as lim 
(Ay/Ax) , where Ay is 
f (x + Ax) - f (x) . Previously, you saw the less precise form in 
Section 1.1 in which Ax was "replaced" by zero. Now, we take the 
limit of the difference quotient. 
2. 
Continuity and differentiability. One implies the other; however, the 
reverse is not always true. What implication direction is true? 
(See Example 5.) 
3. 
Nondifferentiability. A function is differentiable only if its graph 
is 'rsmooth." A "pointed" function like the one in Fig. 1.3.2 is not 
differentiable at the "point. " 
4 .  
Leibniz notation. dy/dx is just another notation for the derivative. 
It is not a fraction, so do not treat it as nu,merator and denominator; 
however, in many derivations, it acts like a fraction. 
5. 
More notation. (dy/dx)lx0

By the sum rule, the derivative is f '(x) - [ 2g(x)]' . By the constant

Ffultiplying out, (t3 - 17t + 9)(3t5 - t2 - 1) = 3t8 - 51t + 26t + 
16t3 - 9t2 + 17t - 9) . Thus, the polynonial rule yields f '(t) = 
24t7 - 306t5 + 130t4 + 48t2 - 18t + 17 . 
Multiplication gives h(t) = t7 - t5 + 9t3 - 9t , so the polynomial 
rule gives hl(t) = 7t6 - 5t4 + 27t2 - 9 . 
By the sum rule and Example 4, Section 1.3, ft(x) = 2x - 1 / 2 G  . 
Multiplication gives f(x) = 1 - x , so f '(x) = -1 . 
The slope of the tangent line is (dldx) (x4 - x2 + 3x) 1

(4x3 - 2x + 3) 1

Starting with (d/dx)xn = nxnM1 , we guess that the desired function 
n+l 
is x 
. Differentiating this gives (n + l)xn . So we now guess 
n+l 
x 
/(n+l) , whose derivative is xn . Noting that the derivative of 
a constant is zero, our desired function is xn+'/(n+l) 
+ c , where 
C 
is any constant.

GOALS

Be able to state and apply the product rule. 
2. 
Be able to state and apply the quotient rule. 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Product rule. Memorize the formula (fg) (x) = f ( x ) ~  
(x) + f (x)~(x) . 
You will probably not be required to reproduce its derivation. You're 
wasting time if you're using this rule when one of f or g is con- 
stant; use the constant multiple rule. 
2. 
Quotient rule. Memorize the formula (f /g) ' (x) = [ f ' (x)g(x) - f (x)g ' (x)] / 
[ g(x)l 
. The memory aid preceding Example 5 may be useful to you. As 
with the product rule, don't be too concerned with the derivation of the 
quotient rule. 
3. 
Reciprocal rule. An alternative to learning this rule is to apply the 
quitient rule with f(x) = 1 ; however, you will find that the reciprocal 
rule is faster to.use.

4. 
Integer power rule. This is just an extension of the rule presented 
in Section 1.4. The rule you learned earlier now holds for any integer. 
CAUTION: A very common mistake is to add 1 to the exponent rather 
than subtracting 1 . Thus, many students equate d(~-~) 
/dx with -2x-I 
rather than the correct answer, -ZX-~ . Be careful! 
5. 
Differentiation rules, At this point in your studies, you should know 
the rules for differentiating a power, a sum, a constant multiple, a 
product, and a quotient. All of the others are special cases of these 
rules and need not be memorized.

What is the equation of a line with slope m and passing through the

How is f '(x) 
related to Ay/Ax ? 
GOALS 
1. 
Be able to write the equation of the tangent line to a curve at a 
given point. 
2. 
Be able to find an approximation by using derivatives. 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Tangent lines. The equation doesn't need to be memorized: if you 
know y = yo + m(x - xO) , just substitute yo = f(xo) 
and m = f '(x ) . 
0 
2. 
Linear approximation. You should either memorize or learn to derive 
the formula. If you remember that [ f (xo + Ax) - f (xo)] /AX" f ' (x0) 
from Section 1.1, you can easily derive the formula by multiplying 
through by Ax and then adding f(xo) 
to both sides. Note that Ax 
may be negative. Using a calculator defeats the purpose of learning what 
the linear approximation is all about.

3. 
Relationship between tangency and the approximation. Notice that the 
linear approximation was derived from AylAxZ f '(x0) . Also notice 
that the tangent line may be rewritten as m = (y - yo)/(x - xo) or 
f '(x0) = Ayl~x . Thus, one basic formula gives you the concepts of

ft(xo)(x - xO) . For y = 1 - x , ft(x) = 
-2x , so y = 0 + (-2)(x - 1) = -2x + 2 . 
5. 
The tangent line to y = f (x) is y = f(xo) + f '(xo) (x - xO) . Com- 
bining the product and quotient rules, we have f '(x) = (2x)[ 3x1 (x + 2)] + 
(x2 - 7)[3(x 
+ 2) - 3x(l)I/(x + 2)2 , so ft(x0) = 0[0/21 + (-7)[(3)(2) 
- 
(0) (l)] 1(212 = -2112 . Also, f (xo) = -7(0/2) = 0 ; therefore, the 
tangent line is y = (-2112)~ . 
9 .  
By the quotient rule, ft(x) =[(l)(x+ 
1) - (x)(l)l/(x+ 
1)2 = 
1/(x + 112 and f '(xO) = 114 . Since f (xO) = 112 , the tangent line 
is y = 112 + (1/4)(x - 1) . To find the x-intercept, set y = 0 . 
This gives x = -1 as the crossing point. 
13. Use the approximat ion f (xo + Ax) 
f (xo) + f (xo) AX . Let f (x) = xL , 
so ft(x) = 2x . Thus, f(2.02) = f(2 + 0.02) ef(2) + ft(2)(0.02) 
= 4 + 
4(0.02) = 4.08 . The exact value is 4.0804 .

Use t h e  approximation f (xo + Ax) " f (xo) + f '(x0)Ax . Let 
f (x) = 
& ,  so f l ( x )  = 1 / 2 & .  
Thus, 
f(16.016) = f(16 + 0.016) " f ( 1 6 )  + 
f '(16) (0.016) = 4 .t (118) (0.016) = 4.002 . The exact value i s  approxi-

Using t h e  approximation 
f (xo + Ax) " f (xo) + f '(x0)Ax , we l e t

3 
f ( x )  = x , so f r ( x )  = 4x . Thus, 
f(2.94) = f ( 3  - 0.06) " f ( 3 )  + 
f1(3)(-0.06) = 81 + 108(-0.06) = 74.52 . 
2 
25. 
Let A(r) = T r  , so ~ ' ( r )  
= 27r . A(3.04) = A(3 + 0.04) "A A ( )  + 
A '(3) (0.04) . Therefore, t h e  approximate increase i n  area i s  
~ ' ( 3 ) ( 0 . 0 4 )  = 6n(0.04) = 0 . 2 4 ~  . 
29. 
We use 
f(xo +Ax) % f ( x o )  + f1(x0)Ax with xo = 3 and 
Ax = 0.023 . 
2 
Thus, 
f(xo) = (12)(5) = 60 
and 
f l ( x )  = (2x)(x + 2) + (x + 3)(1) , 
and so f l ( x o )  = (6)(5) + (12)(1) = 42 . Therefore, 
f(3.023) % 6 0  + 
42(0.023) = 60.966 . 
33. 
The tangent l i n e  has the equation y = f ( 1 )  + f l ( l ) ( x  - 1) . Here, 
7 
f '(x) = 8x + 4x , so f '(1) = 12 . Since f ( 1 )  = 4 , the equation 
is y = 4 + 12(x - 1) 
or y = 12x - 8 . 
37. 
We use 
f(xo + Ax) 
f (x ) + f '(x0)Ax 
with xo = 1 and 
Ax = -0.0003 . 
0 
2 
Here, 
f l ( s )  = 4s3 - 15s + 3 , so f l ( l )  = 4 - 15 + 3 = -8 . Also, 
f ( 1 )  = 1 - 5 + 3 - 4 = -5 , SO 
f(0.9997) " - 5  + (-8)(-0.0003) 
= -4.9976 . 
41. 
For each case, we use h ( t o  + At) 
h(tO) + f ' ( t O ) n t  , where 
h l ( t )  = 
-8t + 7 . 
h(3.001) = h(3 + 0.001) 
"A h(3) + h1(3)(0.001! = -14.25 + (-17)(0.001) 
= -14.267 . 
h(1.97) = h(2 - 0.03) % h(2) + h ' ( 2 )  (-0.03) 
= -1.25 + (-9) (-0.03) 
= -0.98 . 
h(4.03) = h(4 + 0.03) 
h(4) + h1(4)(0.03) = -35.25 + (-25)(0.03) 
= -36.00 .

1. 
Be able to relate rates of change with the derivative. 
2. 
Be able to compute the second derivative and understand its physical 
meaning. 
Copyright 1985 Springer-Verlag. All rights reserved.

78 Section 2.1 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Rates of change. As previously discussed, an average rate of change is 
Ay/Ax over a finite interval, Ax . An instantaneous rate of change 
is simply the derivative, f '(x) . The derivative can represent any 
rate of change, i.e., a change in one quantity due to a change in 
another. A linear or proportional change is a special rate of change 
where Ay = kAx for a constant k ; this implies f '(x) 
is constant 
for all x . 
2. 
Sign of derivative. Think about the many possible interpretations of 
the derivative (look at Fig. 1.7 on page 4). 
The sign indicates the 
direction of the change. 
3. 
Second derivatives. This is simply the derivative of the first deriva- 
tive function. If you are asked to evaluate fH(x0) , do not substitute 
xO until you compute the second derivative; otherwise, your answer will 
be zero. Why? If x is time and y = f(x) 
is position, the interpre- 
tation of f'' (x) is acceleration. 
2 
4. 
Leibniz notation. The second derivative is denoted d y/dx2 . Note 
the positions of the "exponents;" this comes from writing (d/dx)(d/dx) .

The r a t e  of change of p r i c e  with respect t o  time i s  AP/At = (3.2 - 2) 
cents/(1984 - 1982) years = 0.6 centslyear. 
Now, 
P = Po + ( A P / A ~ ) ( ~  
- to) . 
To determine t when t h e  p r i c e  is 5 , we solve 5 = 2 + (0.6)(t - 1982) 
t o  get t = 1987 . To f i n d  t h e  p r i c e  i n  1991, we l e t  t = 1991 , and so 
The average r a t e  of change is Af (t)/At . Af ( t )  = f (312) - f (1) = 
334-364 = -30 
and 
A t  = 312 - 1 = 112 . Thus, the average r a t e  of change 
The area of t h e  base with radius r is nr2 and the height is r . 
Therefore, 
V = nr3/3 
and the r a t e  of change of the volume with respect

t o  the radius is dV/dr = 3nr 13 = nr . 
The r a t e  of change of 
H 
with respect t o  d is H1(d) = 56 - 6d . 
Hence, a t  d = 0.5 , H1(d) = 53 .

For Ax = 0.1 , 0.001 , and 0.000001 , the average rates of change

Be able to state and apply the chain rule. 
2. 
Be able to use the chain rule for solving word problems. 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Power of a function rule . Don't bother memorizing this formula since 
it will soon be covered by the chain rule and the rule (d/dx)xn = nxn-I . 
Do learn how to apply it, though, as this is important preparation for 
the chain rule. 
Copyright 1985 Springer-Verlag. All rights reserved.

84 
Section 2.2 
2. 
Composite function notation. Become familiar with (fog)(x) . This is 
the same as f (g(x)) . 
3. 
Derivation of the chain rule. You will probably not be expected to 
know the proof of the chain rule. It is much more important to under- 
stand how to apply the result. 
4. 
Chain rule. Memorize (fog) ' (x) = f '(g(x)) 
g '(x) . Practice using 
this formula until you feel comfortable with it. It is probably the 
most important differentiation formula that you will learn. DO NOT 
forget the last factor. 
5. 
Leibniz notation. The chain rule demonstrates the usefulness of the 
Leibniz notation. Notice how the du's appear to cancel in dyldx = 
(dyldu)' (duldx) . Remember that dy/dx is a derivative, not a fraction, 
but here they do behave like fractions. 
6. 
Shifting rule. Geometrically, the shifting rule says that a horizontal 
displacement of a graph does not alter its slope. Don't memorize the 
formula. It is just a special case of the chain rule. 
7. 
Word problems. Study Example 11 carefully. It is always a good idea 
to make a drawing, if possible. Many word problems will involve similar 
triangles. Notice how each of the rates are determined. Note also that 
the 8  feet did not enter into the solution of Example 11. 
8 .  
Practical application. The chain rule may be related to converting units. 
For example, suppose we want to convert ~ards/second into meterslsecond. 
Let y be length in yards, let x be length in meters, and let t be 
time in seconds. Then dy/dt = (dy/dx)* (dxldt) . Here, dyldx is the 
number of yards per meter.

with f (x) = & and g(x) = 4x + 5x + 3 . Notice that the choice

21. We can compute h(x) = f(g(x)) 
= (x - 112 = x4 - 2x + 1 and then 
2 
differentiate directly to get hl(x) = 4x3 - 4x = 4x(x - 1) . On

29. Let f(x) 
denote the function. Recall that if u = g(x) , then 
(d/dx) f (g(x) ) = f ' (g(x) ) o g  ' (x) . Now apply the chain rule twice. 
2 
2 
First, let f(u) = u2 and u = (x + 2) + 1 , so fl(x) = 
2u[(d/dx)((x2 
+ 212 + l)] . Now, let f(u) = u2 + 1 and u = x2 + 2 , 
2 
2 
2 
so (d/dx) [(x + 2) + 11 = 2u(2x) = 2 (x + 2) (2x) . Thus, f ' (x) = 
2[(x2 + 2)2 + 112(x2 + 2)(2x) 
= 8x(x2 + 2)[(x2 + 2)2 + 11 .

fl(g(x))*gl(x) . Solet f(u) = & and u = 4 x  + 5 x  
toget 
fl(x) = (1/2J;)(20x4

37. (a) It would seem reasonable that (fogoh)(x) 
can be defined as 
[ f 
o (g oh) ] (XI . This is f ((g oh) (x) ) , but since (go h) (x) = 
g(h(x)) 
, it becomes (fogoh) (x) = f (g(h(x))) 
. 
(b) Let u = g(h(x)) 
, then the derivative of fogoh is f '(u) *u '(x) . 
Applying the chain rule to u gives ur(x) = g'(h(x))*h'(x) 
. 
Therefore, (fogoh) '(x) = fl(g(h(x))) 
*gl(h(x)) *hl(x) . 
41. The Leibniz notation is very useful here. We write dK/dt = (dK/dv) x 
(dv/dt) = mv*(dv/dt) . Since dv/dt is the acceleration, we can sub- 
stitute the appropriate values, yielding dK/dt = (10)(30)(5)

STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Rational power rule. This is just an extension of the power rule for 
integers. The power rule is now valid for all rational numbers for 
which the derivative is defined. 
2. 
Rational power of a function rule. As with the rational power rule, 
this is just an extension of a previously learned rule - the power of 
a function rule for integers. 
3. 
Implicit differentiation. One of the common mistakes in applying this 
2 
method is fo,rgetting that y is a function of x . Thus, (d/dx) (y ) = 
2yyf , not just 2y ; the latter would be (d/dy)yL . Be sure you 
understand the method of implicit differentiation. You will probably 
get one of these problems on your exams.

2. 
Differentiate (x - 315(x2 + 114 . 
GOALS 
1. 
Be able to solve related rates word problems. 
2. 
Be able to calculate the slope of a parametric curve. 
3. 
Be able to sketch simple parametric curves. 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Related rates. Don't forget to use the chain rule when you differentiate 
x and y with respect to t . You may want to substitute x = f (t) 
and y = g(t) 
to help remind yourself to use the chain rule. 
2. 
Parametric curves. Two curves may appear to be related by the same 
equation and yet they are not the same curve. For example, x = t6 and 
2 
y = t3 are related by y = x , which is an entire parabola; y may 
take on negative values. Compare this with Example 2. 
3. 
Finding an xy-relationship. Sometimes it is useful to find an equation 
involving only x and y when you are asked to sketch a parametric 
curve. This can often be done by solving for t in one equation and 
substituting into the other. 
Copyright 1985 Springer-Verlag. All rights reserved.

Section 2.4 95 
4. 
Slopes of parametric curves. Remember that dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt) . 
As with the chain rule, the dt's appear to cancel, but remember they 
are not really fractions. 
5. 
Word problems. Many word problems involve related rates. Draw a pic- 
ture, if possible. Look for a relationship between the variables. 
Sometimes you will have to.derive a relationship as in Example 6. 
Differentiate both sides of your relationship with respect to time. 
Finally, substitute in the given values. A few minutes spent in 
studying Examples 6, 7 ,  and 8 should prove worthwhile.

17. Differentiating with respect to t , we get (dx/dt)y + (dy/dt)x = 0 . 
Substituting x = 8 and y = 112 yields (1/2)(dx/dt) + 8(dy/dt) = 0 , 
and so dyldt = (1/2)(dx/dt)/(-8) 
= -(dx/dt)/l6 . 
21. Let r(t) 
be the radius at time t and let h(t) 
be the height at 
2 
time t . We have volume = V = 1000 = n(r(t)) 
h(t) . Differentiating 
with respect to t , we get 0 = n [2r(t)r1(t)h(t) 
+ (r(t))2h'(t)] 
. 
At the instance when r

Squaring and rearranging yields 3x + 3(y - 413)~ 
= 413 , which 
is a circle centered at (0,413) with radius 213 . 
(b) We want to know dyldt at (0,213) . By implicit differentiation, 
we have 6x(dx/dt) + 6(y - 413) (dyldt) = 0 . At (0,213) , the 
equation is 4(dy/dt) = 0 , so dyldt = 0 . 
(c) 
Rearranging the equation in part (b), we get (dy/dt)/(dx/dt) 
= 1 = 
-x/(y - 413) ; therefore, we need x = 413 - y . Substitute into 
2 
the equation in part (a) : 3 (413 - y) + 3 (y - 413)~ 
= 6 (y - 4/31 = 
413 , so y - 413 = _+2/3fi . Therefore, y = (+fi + 4)/3 , and 
the points are ( m 3 ,  (-a 
+ 4)/3) 
and 
(-fil3, (fi + 4)/3) . 
29. Let R and w denote the length of the rectangle's sides. We want 
to know what dR/dw or dw1dR is when R = w = 5 . Differentiating 
Rw = 25 with respect to R yields w + R(dw1dR) = 0 or dw/dR = 
-w/R = -515 = -1 . On the other hand, differentiating with respect to 
w , (dR/dw)w + 'R = 0 yields -R/w = dR/dw = -515 = -1 .

Be able to interpret the meaning of an antiderivative. 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Antiderivatives. Remember that an antiderivative is not unique unless an 
extra condition is given. Always remember to include the arbitrary con- 
stant. It is a common mistake to forget the arbitrary constant. 
2. 
Power rule. n = -1 is excluded because the antiderivative would require 
division by 0 . 
Copyright 1985 Springer-Verlag. All rights reserved.

Section 2.5 101 
3. 
Polynomial rule. This rule incorporates the sum rule, the constant 
multiple rule, and the power rule. You should learn the basic parts 
well and be able to derive the polynomial rule by yourself. 
4. 
Antidifferentiating composite functions. A systematic method will be 
introduced in Chapter 7. For now, think of the quantity inside the 
parenthesis as a single variable when you guess an antiderivative. 
Then differentiate as in Example 7. 
5. 
Physical interpretation. To help you understand Example 11, recall 
that differentiation yields a rate. Antidifferentiation will yield 
the original function. Therefore, antidifferentiating the water flow 
rate should give the total amount of water.

10.2 Section 2.5 
The acceleration is 9.8 near the earth's surface, so v = 9.8t + C , 
which is vo at t = 0 . Thus, v = 9.8t + vo , and the position 
2 
function becomes x = 4.9t + vot + D . x = x O  at t = O ,  so x =  
2 
4.9t + vot 
xO . Since vo = 1 , we have v = 9.8t + 1 , and since 
2 
x 0 = 2 ,  x=4.9t + t + 2 .  
It is not true. For a counterexample, take f(x) = x and g(x) = 1 . 
2 
Then /f(x)g(x)dx 
= /xdx = x 12 . (For simplicity, let all constants be

53. From Example 4, x = 4.9t + vot + xo where vo = 10 meterslsec and 
xo = 0 , i.e., 
x = 4.9t2 + lot . We want to find t such that 
2 
2 
x = 150 = 4.9t + lot . Using the quadratic formula in solving 4.9t + 
lot - 150 = 0 , we find t = [-lo + 41o2 + 4(150)(4.9)]/2(4.9) 
= 4.6 sec .

vo 
is the downward velocity which is -19.6 for this problem. We want 
the time when x = xO , so we solve 0 = 4.9t2 - 19.6t = t(4.9t - 19.6) . 
This has solutions 0 and 4 , but 0 does not make sense, so t = 4

17. Recall that the tangent line is y = f(x ) + f '(xo) (x - xo) . By the

power of a function rule, f '(x) = (113) [A(x)] -2/3A1(x) = (x3 - x2 - 2x)-213 x 
so the tangent line is y = -1 - 3fi(x - 1)/6 .

4 
ht(x) = 4(x - 213(x2 + 2) + (X - 2) (2~) = 2(x - 213(3x2 - 2~ + 4) ;

h" (i) = 6(x - 212(3x2 - 2x + 4) + 2(x - 2) (6x - 2) = 2(x - 2l2X

41. Mathematically, the first statement says: dV/dt = kS , where V is 
the volume, k is the proportionality constant and S is the surface 
area, 4nr2 . By the chain rule, dV/dt = (dvldr) (dr/dt) = kS .

2 
Since V = 41rr 13 , we have 41rr (dr/dt) = k(47rr ) , which simplifies 
45. Denote the length of the legs by a and b , so the perimeter is 
P = a + b + 
. Differentiate with respect to time: dP/dt = 
da/dt + db/dt + (1/2)(a2 + b2)-ll2(2da/dt + 2db/dt) . At the moment 
in question, a = b , and 
= (1/2)ab , so a = fi * 
= b . 
Also, since the area is constant, one leg is decreasing its length while 
the other increases. Thus, dP/dt =

length

x
 
= 
25x + m x  . Solve for x and substitute into A from Exercise 49. 
x = P/(25 + m) implies A = 22p2/(25 + m12

dA/dP = 44P/(25 + f i 1 2  and dP/dx = 15 + fi .

(b) 
(dC/dx) 1 84 = 5 - (0.02) (84) = $3.32 . 
(c) 
According to part (a), marginal cost is a linear function with 
slope -0.02 , a decreasing function of x . 
(d) It is unreasonable for total cost to be less than or equal to 
zero. The quadratic formula, applied to C(x) , results in 
x "5 503.97 ; therefore, when x 2 504 , the formula cannot 
be applicable.

Thus, thetangent lineis y = y o +  
65. The tangent line is given by y = y (2) + (dyldx) 1 t=2(x - ~(2)) , 
where dyldx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt) . y(2) = 1 + 3fi + 2 = 3 +

69. (a) The linear approximation is given by f (xo + AX) " f (x0) + f ' (xo) AX . 
f '(x)

and 
2 
f '(1) = [ (40) (2) - (0) (29)l /(2)

Therefore, the linear approximation to (x40 - 1)/(x2'

at 
(b) xO and the function are the same as in part (a) . Ax = 0.021 ,

so the approximate value is 20(0.021) = 0.42 .

Suppose the statement is true for k - 1 . If 0 = (d /dx ) (r(x)) 
= 
(dk-'/dxk-l) (r ' (x) ) , then r ' (x) is a polynomial by the induction 
\ 
hypothesis. Let g(x) 
be a polynomial such that g '(x) = r '(x) 
(by the 
antiderivative rule for polynomials). 
Then (g - r) '(x) = 0 , so g - r 
is constant, and hence, r is a polynomial.

114 Section 3.1 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Points of continuity. By studying Example 1, you should notice that a 
function may be continuous at a point or on an interval which is composed 
of a set of points,at each of which the function is continuous. 
2. 
Continuity at endpoints, The definition of continuity at a point given 
on p. 63 in the text needs a slight modification at endpoints. The 
reason is that two-sided limits do not exist at endpoints. This problem 
is dealt with by using one-sided limits when speaking about continuity 
at endpoints. (See p. 65). 
3. 
Continuity tests. Differentiability at a point implies continuity at 
that same point. Rational functions are differentiable and therefore, 
are continuous, except where the denominator becomes zero. Continuity 
alone does not imply differentiability. 
4. 
Intermediate value theorems. Notice that both versions require con- 
tinuity. The first version simply says that to.get from one side of 
y = c to the other side, one must cross it. The second version says 
that if one doesn't cross y = c , one stays on the side one started on. 
5. 
Method of bisection. Study Example 7 well; the technique will be very 
useful in the future for computing numerical answers. The interval does 
not always have to be halved; it is only a convenient way to converge 
upon the answer. 
SOLUTIONS TO EVERY OTHER EXERCISE 
1. 
(a) The function jumps at xo = +I , the points of discontinuity. Thus, 
it is continuous on (-my-1) , (-1 ,I) , and (I,+ m) .

/ 
1. 
(b) Even though the function is not differentiable at xo = 2 , 
1 im 
xt2 f(x) = f(2) , so the function is continuous for all x . 
(c) The limit does not exist at xo = -2 , so the function is 
continuous on (-m,-1) and (-l,+) 
5. 
At xO = 1 , the denominator is 4 # 0 , so the function is con- 
tinuous by the rational function rule. 
9. 
f(x) 
vanishes only at x = tl . Thus, by the rational function rule, 
f (x) is continuous on (-m,-1) , (-1,l) and (1,m) , and in 
particular, [ -112,1121 . 
13. This exercise is analogous to Example 4. We must show that

= (f + g)(xo) . By the sum rule for limits,

f and g are continuous at xO . In addit ion, (f + g) (xo) = 
1 im 
f(xo) 4- g(xo) , so 
(f + g) (x) = (f + g) (xo) as required.

17. We must show that there exists s such that f (s) = -s + s2 - 2s + 6 = 0 . 
Now f(2) = -26 < 0 and f(-2) = 46 > 0 , so by the intermediate value 
theorem (first version), we conclude that there is some so in (-2,2) 
satisfying f ( so) = 0 . (Other intervals also work, for example, [ 0,21 . ) 
21. f (-3) = -28 , f (0) = 2 , f (1.3) = -0.093 , and f (2) = 2 . Combining 
this information with the fact that f(fi) = f (-a) 
= f (1) = 0 and the 
second version of the intermediate value theorem, we conclude that f(x) 
is negative on (-m,-fi) and (1,fi) . f(x) 
is positive on (-fi,l) 
and (&,+m) 
. 
25. By the intermediate value theorem (second version), we know that 
f (x) - 2 < 0 on [ -1,lI because f (0) - 2 = -2 . From f (x) - 2 < 0 , 
we conclude f(x) 
< 2 on [-1,1].

,,[(X2

33. In order for f (x) to be continuous, we must have f (1) = x+l f (x) . 
For x # 1 , f(x) = (x2 - 1)/(x - 1) = [(x - 1)(x + l)]/(x - 1) = 
x + 1 . Since lim 
1 im 
x+l f(x) = x+l (X + 1) = 2 , we define f(1) as 2 . 
37. The function f(x) = l/(x - 1) is not continuous on the interval 
[0,2 ],since it is not defined at x = 1 ; therefore, the inter- 
mediate value theorem does not apply to f and there is no 
contradiction.

STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Definition of increasing. Fig. 3.2.2 shows the graph of an increasing 
function which is also changing signs. By looking at the graph, the 
definition of increasing should become intuitively obvious. As you 
move from left to right, x is increasing and f(x) 
is increasing

("getting larger") as well in a small interval (a,b) . 
Note that the definition of increasing may not apply if the inter- 
val is chosen to be too large. For example, if we chose [ a,x3] in 
Fig. 3.2.4, the function decreases at the right. 
2. 
Changing signs. It should be intuitively obvious that an increasing 
function passing through y = 0 is changing from negative to positive. 
(See Fig. 3.2.2.) 
Similar reasoning applies to decreasing functions 
passsing through y = 0 . (See Fig. 3.2.3.) 
3. 
Increasing-decreasing test. Know this test well! A positive deriva- 
tive means f is increasing; a negative derivative means f is de- 
creasing. A zero derivative means that the slope of the graph is flat. 
Test you understanding by explaining all of the answers in Example 8. 
4. 
Increasing on intervals. One can conclude that a function is increasing 
on an entire interval provided the derivative is positive throughout that 
interval. A similar statement may be made for the decreasing case. By 
using the intermediate value theorem, one can conclude that increasing 
and decreasing intervals are separated by points where f '(x) = 0 . 
5. 
Critical point test. The test is very important to know. The example 
y = x3 is a common one to use when asked for a counterexample to demon- 
3 
strate when the test fails. For y = x , xo = 0 is a critical point, 
but zero is neither a minimum nor amaximum. Also, note that the test 
only applies to differentiable functions. Think about f (x) = 1x1 . 
6. 
First derivative test. This test should be understood, not memorized. 
Think about what the signs of the derivative mean and be able to repro- 
duce Fig. 3.2.17.

SOLUTIONS TO EVERY OTHER ODD EXERCISE 
1. 
Use the definitions of increasing and decreasing given at the beginning 
of this section. From the graph, we see that (a,b) may be chosen to 
be (2,4) . If 2 < x <  3 , then f(x) < 9 = 
f(xo) . If 3 < x < 4 , then f(x) > 9 = 
(3,9) 
f(xo). 
Thus, by definition, f (x) is 
increasing at xo = 3 .

For the general case, the chosen interval (a,b) must not be too large. 
In the case, (a,b) may be chosen as large as desired; we choose (0,l) . 
For f(x) = 2x - 1 , f(0) = -1 < 0 , f(1/2) = 0 , and f(1) = 1 > 0 , 
so f changes from negative to positive at xo = 1/2 . 
2 
9. 
Using the increasing-decreasing test, we get f '(x) = 3x + 1 and 
f '(0) = 1 . Since f '(x ) 
is positive, f is increasing at xo = 0 . 
0 
3 
13. Here, f '(t) = 5t4 - 4t + 4t and f1(l) = 5 is positive. Thus, f(t) 
is increasing at t = 1 , i.e., the particle is moving to the right. 
17. Here, ft(x) = 2x , so ft(x) > 0 if x > 0 and f1(x) < 0 if x < 0 . 
Therefore, the increasing-decreasing test states that f is increasing 
on (0, a) and decreasing on (-a, 0) . 
21. The derivative in (e) is a positive constant, so the function is an 
increasing linear function, namely, (5). 
The derivative in (b) is always 
positive, so the function is alwaysincreasing. Of the remaining functions, 
only (4) has this property. The derivative in (c) indicates that the 
function near x = 0 
is increasing for x < 0 and decreasing for 
x > 0 . Thus, (c) must match with (1). 
For (d), we look for a function

(2) s a t i s f i e s  t h i s .  
Note that (3) does not always increase f o r  x > 0 . 
It matches (a). 
Thus, the answer is (a) - (3) , (b) - (4) , (c) - (1) , 
(dl - (2) , (el - (5) 
25. 
We use the definitions of local minimum and local maximum on p. 151. 
The local minimum points occur a t  x , x3 , and 
x5 . Local maximum 
points are a t  x2 and x4 . x6 is neither a local minimum nor a local 
maximum point.

For 
f(x) = x  + x 2  - 2 , f l ( x )  = 3x + 2 x = x ( 3 x + 2 )  . f t ( x )  = 0 
a t  x = 0 
and 
x = -213 , so these are the c r i t i c a l  points. 
The 
sign of 
f '  changes from negative t o  positive a t  x = 0 
and from pos- 
i t i v e  to negative a t  x = -213 . Hence, the f i r s t  derivative t e s t  s t a t e s  
that 
0 is a local minimum and 
-213

a t ( r )  = 2(r4 - r )(4r3 - 2r) = 4r ( r  - 1)(2r - 1) , so the c r i t i c a l  
points are 0 , 51 , tllfi . R '(r) 
changes from negative to positive 
a t  r = -1,0,1 . Therefore, these are local minima, by the f i r s t  
derivative t e s t .  
R'(r) 
changes from positive t o  negative a t  + 1 / 6  , 
the local maxima. 
37. 
f l ( x )  = m . For 
m = -2 , the sign change is from positive t o  negative 
since the function is decreasing. 
There i s  no sign change when 
m = 0 . 
For 
m = 2 , the sign change i s  from negative to positive since the 
function is increasing. 
41. 
f (x) = x2 - 4x + 4 has a double root a t  x = 2 , so f (2) = 0 . f '(x) = 
2x - 4 , which i s  negative f o r  x < 2 and positive f o r  x > 2 . Thus, 
f '(x) changes sign a t  2 ; therefore, x = 2 is a local minimum. 
Conse- 
quently, 
f 
does not change sign anywhere.

f (x) = ax + bx + c , so f '(x) = 2ax + b . The hypothesis t h a t

implies 
n = 2  i s  a

The hypothesis t h a t  x = 1 i s  a zero of 
f 
implies 
0 = f ( 1 )  = a + b + 
c . Hence 
b = -4a , c = -a - b = 3a , and so f(x) = ax2 - 4 a x +  3a = 
a(x2 - 4x + 3) 
where 
a > 0 since a parabola with a minimum is a 
parabola which opens upward.

f ( x )  + g(x) < f(xo) +

Since the graph does not change sign a t  x = 0 , the q u a r t i c  has the

form p(x) = cx (x + b) (x - b) = cx4 - cb2x2 , where 
c is a non-zero

Thus,

When 
x = a , 4ca3 - 2cb a = 0 o r  2a2 = b2 . We obtain the same 
relationship when x = -a . At 
x = b , we need 
p l ( x )  > 0 , so 
c > 0 . Hence, the polynomial i s  p(x) = cx4 - cb2x2 , c > 0 , and 
2a2 = b2.

GOALS 
1. 
Be able to use the second derivative to determine the concavity of a 
function. 
2. 
Be able to find the inflection points of a function. 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Second derivative test. There is a simple way to remember that fr'(x0) > 0 
and f '(x ) = 0 
implies a local minimum. Since f" > 0 , f ' must be in- 
0 
creasing. And since f ' (x ) = 0 , f '(x) 
< 0 
on the left of xo and 
0 
f' (x) > 0 on the right side. Thus f (x) is decreasing to a local mini- 
mum at xo , where it begins to increase again. Deriving the second 
derivative test in this fashion may be easier than memorizing it. 
2. 
Concavity. A curve is concave upward if it can "hold water." In order 
for this to occur, the slopes must be getting larger, i.e., f '(x) 
is 
increasing or f" (x) 2 0 . Similarly, f" (x) 
0 implies downward con- 
cavity, and these curves "spill water."

128 Section 3.3 
3. 
Concave up on intervals. As with the concept of increasing and de- 
creasing, an entire interval may possess a certain concavity. By 
using the intermediate value theorem, one can conclude that these 
intervals are separated by points x where ff'(i) = 0 . 
4. 
Inflection points. Concavity changes at those points where fl'(x) = 0 
and ftt' (x) $ 0 . Notice the similarity of this definition with that 
of minimum and maximum points, where f '(x) 
changes signs.

f '(x) = 6x , which is 0

= 4 which is positive, so by the second derivative 
test, x = 0 
is a local minimum. 
9. 
Since f '(x) = 6x + 8 , ft' (x) = 6 which is positive for all x . Thus, 
f(x) is concave upward everywhere. 
13. Since fl(i) = -l/(x - 1)2 , ft'(x) = 2/(x - 1)3 . The second derivative 
is positive for x > 1 and negative for x < 1 . Thus, f(x) 
is con- 
cave upward on (1,m) and concave downward on (-m,l) . 
3 
17. For f(x) = x - x , f1(x) = 3x2 - 1 , ft'(x) = 6x , and fl"(x) = 6 .

are no inflection points.

f P  is negative between its roots and positive outside its roots. Hence 
f is decreasing on (-2,213) and increasing on (-,-2) 
and (2/3,m) . 
fU(x) = 6x + 4 = 0 at x = -213 ; f "'(-213) 
= 6 # 0 , so x = -213 
is an inflection point. As fU(x) c 0 for x < -213 and f "(x) 
> 0 
for x > -213 , f is concave downward on (-,-213) 
and concave upward 
on (-213, m) . In particular, fU(-2) < 0 and f" (213) > 0 , so x = -2 
is a local maximum and x = 2/3 is a local minimum.

The table shows that e(x) < 0 if frl(xo) < 0 and e(x) > 0 if 
ftl(xo) > 0 . If fl'(xo) = 0 , e(x) 
is comparatively smaller and 
decreases faster as Ax decreases. The sign of the error is the 
same as for Ax when frr 
(xo) = 0 . 
41. sl(t) = 40 - 32t , which vanishes at t = 514 ; sU(5/4) = -32 < 0 , so

at x =  kt613 . As x + 1 > 0 , (x2 + 113 > 0 , so g"(x) 
changes 
sign wherever 3x2 - 1 does. Since 3x2 - 1 is a quadratic with two 
distinct roots, it changes sign at its roots x = kt613 . Hence g 
has inflection points at x =+-GI3 while f has none.

STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Symmetries. Before jumping into the problem, note any symmetries. If 
any symmetry exists, your work is reduced by half. The two important 
symmetries are those about the y-axis.and about the origin. Note that 
Copyright 1985 Springer-Verlag. All rights reserved.

134 Section 3.4 
1 (continued) . 
if all of the exponents in a polynomial are even, the function is even. 
Similarly, all odd exponents make the function odd. The last two state- 
3 
ments apply only to polynomials. A quotient such as (x3 + x5) 1 (x + x ) 
has all odd exponents, but it is an even function. Remember that all 
constant terms have an even exponent, namely, zero. 
2. 
Horizontal asymptotes. If limits exist at 
+ m ,  
these limits are the 
horizontal asymptotes. Each function can have at most two horizontal 
asymptotes. Note that a function may cross the asymptote one or more 
2 
times as x increases; consider f(x) = x/(l + x ) 
in Fig. 3.4.9 . 
3. 
Vertical asymptotes. We are interested in the behavior on both sides 
of the x-values which produce a zero denominator. The sign of the 
limiting values on either side of a vertical asymptote may either be 
the same or opposite. Consider f(x) = l/xZ and f (x) = l/x . Note 
that, unlike horizontal asymptotes, there may be any number of vertical 
asymptotes. 
4 .  
Other asymptotes. Example 3 is interesting in that one of the asymptotes 
is neither vertical nor horizontal. 
5. 
Six-step method. There is no need to memorize the method. With enough 
practice, the method should become second nature to you. 
6. 
Cusps. These occur when the limit of the derivative becomes infinite, 
and when the sign of the derivative changes. Note the difference 
when the sign does not change, by comparing Figs. 3.4.15 and 3.4.16 . 
You need to be aware of the possibility of cusps only if fractional 
213 
powers occur, such as f(x) = x 
.

(X + 1) = -f (x) .

f(x) = x/(x + 1) is undefined at x = -1 , so it is a vertical asymptote. 
For x near -1 
and x < -1 , x is negative and x' + 1 is small and 
negative, so f(x) is large and positive. For x near -1 
and x > -1 , 
x is negative and x3 + 1 is small and positive, so f(x) is large and 
negative . 
f (-x) = f (x) , so f 
is even and we 
need to consider x 2 0 
only. x = 1 is 
a vertical asymptote. For x near 1 
and x 
1 , f(x) 
is large and positive. 
For x near 1 and x > 1 , f(x) 
is 
large and negative. 1 im

f (XI = 
1 im i l / ( l / x 2  - I)] = -1 , which is a 
2 2 
horizontal asymptote. f '(x) = 2x1 (1 - x ) , 
so 0 
is a critical point and f 
is increasing on (0,l) 
and ( 1 , ~ )  . 
2 
2 
fU(x) = (2 + 6x ) / ( I  - x2)3 , so f" has the same sign as 1 - x . 
There are no inflection points. ft'(0) = 2 > 0 , so 2 is a local minimum. 
f 
is concave upward on (0,l) 
and concave downward on ( 1 , ~ )  . Plot a few 
points and use the symmetry to complete the graph.

2. 
Be able t o  solve minimum-maximum word problems. 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Definitions. 
A l o c a l  maximum i s  a maximum on a small i n t e r v a l ,  whereas 
a global maximum i s  a maximum on the e n t i r e  i n t e r v a l  of definition. 
Note t h a t  a global maximum is always a l o c a l  maximum, but not v i c e  
versa. 
Similar comments may be made f o r  minima. 
2. 
Points and values. 
The value of a maximum r e f e r s  t o  y 
and points 
r e f e r  t o  x . Whereas there can only be one value f o r  the maximum, 
there may be several points where the maximum i s  assumed.

3. 
Extreme value theorem. Note that two conditions are necessary: 
Y 
(i) continuity and (ii) closed inter- 
f 
vals. By eliminating just one condi- 
tion, the guarantee of a minimum and 
maximum no longer exists. However, 
both minimum and maximum may occur 
even if one or none of the conditions 
hold. See figure. 
4. 
Closed interval test. Essentially, it is saying, "If a function is 
(i) continuous and (ii) differentiable on a closed interval, then the 
minimum and maximum points must exist at-critical points or endpoints." 
Thinkabout what happens if differentiability wasn't required, as in 
f(x) = 1x1 . What if a discontinuity existed? What if the interval 
was not closed? 
5. 
Solving word problems. The most difficult part is translating words 
into equations. Whenever possible, drawing a picture often helps one 
to visualize and understand the entire question. Write down equations 
to describe the situation. If you have several variables, try to re- 
write them in terms of a single variable. Before finding a solution, 
a guess may help determine the correctness of your answer. After 
finding a solution, ask yourself if it makes sense. Finally, we 
emphasize that practice makes perfect. 
6 .  
Test taking. Calculus exams almost always have a maximum-minimum word 
problem. In the majority of cases, you will be asked to solve problems 
with a minimum of information. Thus, you should try to use all of the

Let the two individual masses be

xy , i . e . ,  maximize 
f(x) = x(M - x) . 
37. 
f ( x )  = x(M - x) , so f t ( x )  = M - 2x = 0 
i f  x = M/2 . Also, 
f t t ( ~ / 2 )

i s  a maximum point. 
Hence, the

Thus, 
~ ' ( h )  = 0 when 
h = 0 o r  h = 12 , but 
h = 0 means

so h must be

bean value theorem. The theorem states that the average slope is 
attained somewhere in an interval, possibly at more than one point, 
if two conditions hold: i) the function is continuous on [ a,b] and 
ii) it is differentiable on (a,b). 
Example 3 explains what happens 
if differentiability doesn't hold.

Section 3.6 155 
2. 
Typical application. Example 2 shows a typical proof which relies on 
getting an expression of the form [ f(xl) - f(xo)l /(xl - x0) . Many 
times, as in Example 2, you will simply be asked to multiply through 
by the denominator to estimate the difference between function values. 
3. 
Rollers theorem. Basically, it asserts that if f = 0 at two points, 
then the derivative is zero somewhere in between, assuming continuity 
and differentiability. 
4. 
Horserace theorem. This says that if two continuous, differentiable 
functions have equal values at the endpoints, then they must have equal 
slopes somewhere in between.

Since f is continouson [0,1/2] and ff(x) exists for x in 
(0,112) , the mean value theorem applies. It states that there exists 
xO in (0,1/2) such that f (xo) = [ f (1/2) - f (0)l /(1/2 - 0) . Since 
0.3<ff(x) < 1  for x in (0,112) , we have, in particular, 
0.3 G f1(x0) < 1 , i.e., 0.3 G [ f(112) - f(0)I 1(1/2) < 1 or 0.15 < 
f (112) - f (0) < 112 . 
5. 
Since f (x) is a polynomial, it is continous and differentiable . By 
the mean value theorem, there is an xo in (-1,O) such that f ' 
(xo) = 
[ f (0) - f (-1)I /(0 - (-1)) 
= (15 - 17)/1 = -2 .

Let x(t) 
be the position of the object. We are given that the velocity 
of the object xl(t) is such that 34 G x f  
(t) < 36 . Antidifferentiation 
gives 34t + C <x(t) G 36t + C . x(0) = 4 gives C = 4 . Hence, 
34t + 4 <x(t) G 36t + 4 and so 72 Gx(2) G 76 .

13. The derivative of l/x is -(l/x ) , so by Consequence 3 , F(x) = 
(l/x) + C , where C is a constant, on any interval not containing 
zero. So F(x) = (l/x) + C1 for x < 0 and F(x) = (l/x) + C2 for 
x > 0 . Hence C1 and C2 are constants, but they are not necessarily 
equal. 
17. By the power and polynomial rules for antidifferentiation, we get

(112)~ 12 - 4x /3 + 21x + C = x / 4  - 4x 13 + 21x + C .

21. By the power rule for antidifferentiation, we get F(x) = 2x 15 + C , 
5 
but F(1) = 215 + C = 2 implies C = 815 . Thus, F(x) = 2x 15 + 815 . 
25. Let c , d , and e be the points with a < c < d < e < b in (a,b) 
at which f vanishes, then [ f (d) - f (c)] /(d - c) = 0 and 
f (e) - 
f(d)]/(e 
- d) = 0 implies that the first derivative vanishes somewhere 
in (c,d) and somewhere in (d,e) according to the mean value theorem. 
Now, let m and n be the points in (a,b) where f '(x) 
vanishes. 
By the mean value theorem, there exists an xo in (m,n) such that 
f "(xo) = [ f ' (n) - f '(m)] / (n - m) = 0 . Since (m,n) is in (a,b), the 
statement is proven. 
29. By applying the mean value theorem to [ tl , t2] , we have [ N(t2) - 
~(t~)] 
/(t2 - tl) = 0 because N(t2) = N(tl) . Therefore, d~/dt can- 
not be greater than 0 on all of (tl,t2) . Also, N is not constant, 
so dN/dt cannot be 0 
on the entire interval. Consequently, d~/dt 
< 
0 for some T in (tl,t2) , which means that the population is de- 
creasing. Do the same for the interval [ t t 1 .

From the right, x+2+ h(x) = (2) - 7 = -3 . The limit of h at x = 2 
exists and is equal to the value of h at x = 2 , so h is con- 
tinuous at x = 2 . h is continuous on the whole real line because 
the function is continuous at x = 2 and all polynomials are continuous.

~'(t) > 0 on [-3,-513) and (5,71 . So B is decreasing on (-5/3,5) , 
increasing on [-3,-513) and (5,71 . ~"(t) = 3t15 - l = 0 at t = 513 ; 
B "'(513)

There are no prerequisites other than simple addition and algebra for 
this section. 
GOALS 
1. 
Be able to manipulate expressions involving summation notation. 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Dumy index. Changing the index letter does not change the value of the 
sum. Understand this concept. 
2. 
Properties of summation. With use, you will soon have these properties 
memorized, so there is no need to actively memorize these properties. 
However, you should understand the meaning of each statement. Note how

4. 
Sum of the first n numbers. Memorize or learn how to derive this 
formula. 
5. 
Substitution of index. 
Formula (6) should be understood and not mem- 
orized. Note that the left-hand side of the formula in the text begins 
at am+q and ends at a n+q . Be sure the sums begin and end with the 
5 
same terms. For example, if 
X 2jf2 = 
2i-3 , then x = 6 and 
j = 1 
i=x 
y = 10 because the exponents of 2 on both sides should begin at 3 
and end at 7 . (Note that the indices do not always start at 1 or 0 .) 
6 .  
Telescoping sums. There are several other ways for writing the tele- 
n 
scoping sum, such as 
Z [ai - ai-l] = an - a m-l . These formulas can 
i=m 
easily be recognized by their minus signs and in many cases, a shift of 
the index by one. Again, don't memorize these formulas. To compute 
a telescoping sum, write down a few terms at the beginning and at the 
end of the sum, and then cancel out the terms in the middle. 
Try Example 7 with (i - 113 replaced by (i + 313 . This new 
example demonstrates that your answer may have more than two terms.

Area under graphs. The area under a graph is closely related to the 
important concept of the integral, so be sure you know exactly what the 
boundaries of the area are. Note that one or both of a and b in 
Fig. 4.2.2 
could be negative.

Step functions. Be able to define a step function. In addition, be 
familiar with the notations xi , Axi , and ki . Note that the first 
x is xo , not xl . This is because there are n + 1 partition 
points and only n intervals.

Section 4.3 189 
3. 
Integrals and signed areas. It is important to know that the integral 
and the signed area under a curve are equal. 
4. 
Definition of the integral. We will define the integral to be the unique 
number which lies between all lower sums and all upper sums. 
5. 
Estimating integrals. Referring to Example 4, note that estimates 
usually use equal subdivisions. In general, more subdivisions increase 
the accuracy of the estimate. Also note that for functions which are 
strictly increasing or decreasing, your upper and lower sums will differ 
only in the first and last terms. This is because the estimate uses a 
telescoping sum. Thus, the difference is 
1 f (xo) - f (xn) AX . When 
estimating integrals of general functions, be sure to consider the 
critical points when you compute upper and lower sums. Why consider 
2 
the critical points? Try to estimate a lower sum for f(x) = x - x 
on [0,1] 
with n = 1 . 
6. 
Integrability versus differentiability. Non-continuous functions may 
be integrated whereas they cannot be differentiated. For example, a 
step function may be integrated over an interval, but it is not 
differentiable. 
7. 
Riemann sums. Note that ci may be chosen as 2 
point in 
,xi] . 
Note also that the definition requires the number of subdivisions to go 
to 
and that the largest subdivision approach zero. 
8. 
Physical motivation. Although the supplement may be skipped, it will 
give you an appreciation of the usefulness and the practicality of the 
integral.

13. Applying the method of Example 4, we use the partition (2,8/3,10/3,4) . 
~hus, 
an upper sum is [ 112 + 1/(8/3) + 1/(10/3)1 (213) = 37/60 . 
Similarly, a lower sum is [ 1/(8/3) + 1/(10/3) + 1/41 (213) = 47/60 . 
The integral lies between 37/60 and 47/60 , a difference of 
116 . Therefore, 42/60 = 7/10 must be within 1/12 of ji(dx/x) . 
A better estimate may be obtained by using smaller subdivisions.

(a) The displacement of the bus is ]i5(t2 - 5t + 6)dt .

calculus.

3. 
Be able to check any integration formula by differentiating.

STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Definite vs. indefinite integrals. The box on p. 232 relates the 
definite integral, /if (x)dx , on the right-hand side to the indefinite 
integral, /f(x)dx , on the left. The box simply shows another way to 
express the fundamental theorem of calculus. You should recognize that 
definite integrals specify their endpoints and possess a unique value. 
Remember that indefinite integrals aEways have an additive constant. 
2 .  
Indefinite integral test. The value of this test cannot be emphasized 
enough. Since differentiation is much easier than integration, it is a 
good habit to check your integrals by differentiating. 
3. 
Properties of integration. You should become familiar with the state- 
ments made in the box on p. 234. 
As with the properties of summation, 
the properties of integration will be memorized with use, Notice how 
Properties 1 and 2 are similar to the differentiation rules with the 
same name. 
4. 
Products of integrals. In general, the integral of a product is not 
b 
the product of each multiplicand's integral, i.e. , laf (~)~(x)dx # 
b 
~:f (x)dx-lag(x)dx . The technique for integrating products will be 
shown in Section 7.4 . 
5. 
Proof of the properties. Your instructor will probably not hold you 
responsible for proofs such as those in Examples 3 and 4, but ask to 
be sure. 
6. 
"Wrong-way" integrals. There is no need to memorize these formulas. 
They can easily be recalled by using the fundamental theorem of calculus. 
Notice that 
f (x)dx = F(a) - F(a) = 0 .

7. 
Alternative version of the fundamental theorem. This version is not as 
important as 
f (x)dx = F(b) - F(a) 
for this course. Note that dif- 
1: 
ferentiation is performed with respect to the upper endpoint. Use the 
concept of "wrong-way" integrals to differentiate with respect to the 
lower endpoint. For differentiation with respect to the lower limit, 
b 
you can write jxf (s)ds = -1tf (s)ds . 
8. 
Geometric interpretation of the fundamental theorem. Fig. 4.5.3 should 
help explain why the alternative version of the fundamental theorem is 
true, but the most important immediate goal is to understand the state- 
ment in the box on p. 237 . 
9. 
Generalization of the fundamental theorem. Use the chain rule and the 
fundamental theorem of calculus to derive (d/dt)/~(~)f (s)ds = f (g(t)) 
X 
gl(t) . Notice that if g(t) = t , the original version results. 
See Exercise 43.

[~(t) - F(a2)1

F(a2) - F(a ) must be a constant.

(b) From part (a), 
F2(t) - Fl(t) = F(al) - F(a2) . By the fundamental 
theorem of calculus, this is iz:f

The generalized chain rule was derived in Exercise 43. It states that 
2 
(d~dx)~~(~)£(t)dt = £ (g(x))*gr(x) . Here, g(x) = x , a = 1 , and 
2 
f(t) = l/t . Therefore, ~'(x) = (l/x )2x = 2/x .

Let I = j a f  ( t ) d t  + JEf ( t ) d t  . We w i l l  show t h a t  every number l e s s  than 
I is a lower sum f o r  f 
on 
[a,cl 
and every number g r e a t e r  than I 
is an upper sum f o r  f 
on 
[a,cl ; by the d e f i n i t i o n  of the i n t e g r a l ,  
f 
w i l l  be integrable on 
[ a , d  
and its i n t e g r a l  w i l l  be I . 
So l e t  S < I. 
To show t h a t  S is a lower sum, we begin by writing 
b 
S = S + S2 , where sl< l a f  ( t ) d t .  and S2 < JEf ( t ) d t  . (See t h e  h i n t  on 
1 
p. A . 2 9 . )  
This means t h a t  S1 and S2 a r e  lower sums f o r  f on [ a , b ]  
and 
[ b , c  1 , respectively. 
Thus there i s  a s t e p  function gl on [a,b] with 
g, ( t )  < f ( t )  f o r  a l l  t i n  (a,b) , and !igl 
( t ) d t  = S1 , and there is a 
s t e p  function g2 on [ b,c] with g 2 ( t )  < f ( t )  f o r  a l l  t i n  (b,c) and 
/ i g 2 ( t )  = S2. 
Put together gl and g2 t o  obtain a function g on [a,c] by 
t h e  d e f i n i t i o n :  
The function g is a s t e p  function on 
[a,c] , with 
g ( t )  
f ( t )  
f o r  
a l l  t 
i n  (a,c) . The sum which represents the i n t e g r a l  f o r  g on 
[a,cl 
is t h e  sum of the sums representing the i n t e g r a l s  of 
gl 
and 
82 ' 
so we have 
b 
JZg(t)dt = J a g l ( t ) d t  + / i g 2 ( t ) d t  = S1 + S2 = S 
and 
S is a lower sum. 
Similarly, any number g r e a t e r  than I i s  an 
upper sum, so I is the i n t e g r a l  of 
f 
on 
[a,bl .

STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Area versus signed area. 
Rememberthat the integral gives the signed 
area; therefore, the area-ofregions where the function i s  negative is 
b 
the negative of the integral for the same region, i. e. , -Jaf (x) dx 
wherever 
f (x) c 0 . 
Copyright 1985 Springer-Verlag. All rights reserved.

208 Section 4.6 
2. 
Area between curves. You should memorize the formula. Always subtract 
the lower curve from the higher curve. The formula works whether or not 
the curves lie above the x-axis. Note that if f(x) = 0 , we get the 
formula for the area under the positive function, g(x) . 
3. 
Infinitesimal approach. Try to understand this approach for deriving 
the area formula. Learning this method will help you derive formulas 
which will be introduced in future chapters as well as reduce the risk 
of memory lapses during exams. 
4 .  
Intersecting curves. It is a good idea to sketch all regions in area 
problems to check for points of intersection. These points must be 
known to determine the endpoints of integration. Again, in the area 
formula, subtract the lower curve from the higher one on each interval. 
5. 
Multi-functional boundaries. If an area is bounded by several functions, 
it must be divided into subregions which are bounded by only two functions. 
Then, apply the additive property of areas. 
6. 
Symmetry. Noting some symmetry can simplify a problem. For example, the 
1 2  
area under y = x2 on [-I, 11 
is 2JOx dx . 
7. 
Integrating rates. Know that integrating rates of change gives the total 
change. Your instructor may choose to emphasize some examples over others, 
but only the terminology differs. For example, the rate, r(x) , may be 
called velocity, marginal revenue, current, productivity, or many other 
names depending on the application.

The equation of the line segment from (0,O) 
to (a,h) is y = (h/a)x . For the seg- 
I 
(a9-h) 
ment from (a,h) to (b,O) , it is 
y = [-h/(b - a)] (x - b) . The area is

hb/2 . Geometrically, the height is h and the base is b ; there- 
fore, the area is (1/2)(base)(height)

give the same answer. 
Again, the equations are y = (h/a)x 
and 
y = [-h/(b - a)] (x - b) . The area is

Therefore, c must he 31400 . The area of the wall with the exhaust

345,600122,000 = 15.71 minutes or 15 minutes, 43 seconds.

2 
2 
x = x (X - 1) + (-1)(x - 1) = (X - 1)(x - 1) . This shows that 
volume is 0 only at t = 1 minute, so V(3) = 1 + (t3 - t2 - 
t)li = 1 + 27 - 9 - 3 = 16 liters. 
(c) The rate of volume increase is 3t2 - 2t - 5 , which is < 0 for 
-1 < t G 513 . If we use V(x) = l+/t(3t2 - 2t - 5)dt , then 
V(l) 
= -4 , so the tank must be empty for more than an instant.

Therefore, V(3) = lgI3(3t2 - 2t - 5)dt = (t3 - t2 - 5t) 15,3

45. (a) C(t) = l(l000t - 7000)dt = 500t2 - 7000t + K . C(0) = 40,000 
implies K = 40,000 . We want to solve C(t) = 20,000 , so 
20,000 = 500t2 - 7000t + 40,000 implies 0 = 500(t2 - 14t + 40) = 
500(t - 4)(t - 10) . Due to the restriction that 0 G t G 6 , the 
only solution is t = 4 . Thus after 4 days, the concentration 
has dropped to half its original value, so the inspector should be 
sent on the fifth day. 
(b) The total change in concentration from the fourth to the sixth day

1000(10 - 14) = -4000 . Therefore, the concentration drops by 
4000 bacteria per cubic centimeter.

CHAPTER 5 
TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 
5.1 Polar Coordinates and Trigonometry 
PREREQUISITES 
1. 
There are no prerequisites for this section other than basic high 
school geometry. 
PREREQUISITE QUIZ 
1. 
Use Quiz C on p. 14 to evaluate your preparation for this section. If 
you pass Quiz C, the material of this section may be reviewed quickly. 
If you have difficulties with Quiz C, you will need to study this section 
thoroughly. 
GOALS 
1. 
Be able to plot in polar coordinates. 
2. 
Be able to write down the definitions of the trigonometric functions 
and to be able to find commonly used values. 
3. 
Be able to make sketches of the graphs of the trigonometric functions. 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Radians. Calculus uses radians, not degrees! Be sure your calculator 
is in the right mode. Remember that 2~ radians is 360' 
in order to 
make conversions. 
Copyright 1985 Springer-Verlag. All rights reserved.

222 Section 5.1 
2. 
Equivalences. You should be able to convert back and forth from radians 
and degrees quickly in your head for the following angles: o', 
30' , 45' , 
60' , 90' , 180° , 270° , 360' . Use proportional reasoning: 90' = 360° 14 
is equivalent to 2 ~ / 4  
= ~ / 2 .  
3. 
Negative polar coordinates. Remember that a negative angle represents 
clockwise motion and that a negative radius means reflection through the 
origin or a rotation of r radians, i.e., 
(-r,0) = (r,0 + n) . 
4. 
Definitions. Using the figure at the left, you should know the following 
A 
definitions: x/r = cos 0 , y/r = sin 0 , y/x = 
/ I  
tan 6, 
cot 8 = l/tan 0 , sec 0 = l/cos 0, and 
/ 
csc 8 = l/sin 0 . Note that if r = l , x = cos 0 
A 
and y = sin 0 . Also, no cofunction is the reciprocal 
of another cofunction. For example, csc 8 and cos 0 are not recipro- 
cals. This may help you remember that sec 0 and cos 0 are reciprocals. 
5. 
Commonly used values. Reproducing Fig. 5.1.17 and Fig. 5.1.18 will help 
you remember the most commonly used trigonometric values. If you have 
troubles remembering whether cos(~/6) is 112 or 6 1 2  , recall that 
cos 0 corresponds to x in the xy-plane. The cosine function decreases 
as 0 increases on [o,T/~] . Thus, we expect cos(n/6) = 6 1 2  and 
cos(n/3) = 112 . Similar analysis may be used for sine. 
6. 
Calculuator errors. Inaccuracies may occur if 0 is very large. For 
example, does cos(201r/2) = 0 on your calculator? 
7. 
Trigonometric identities. For the purposes of this course, you will find 
2 
2 
that cos 0 + sin 0 = 1 is very useful. Formulas (2), ( 3 ) ,  and (4) will 
help you to derive other identities, but it is not an essential part of 
the course. Formulas (5) and (6) are especially important for integration

7. 
Trigonometric identities (continued). 
techniques which will be presented in Chapter 10. 
Other useful trigono- 
metric identities may be found on the inside front cover of the text. 
8. 
Period and frequency. A period is the length of a repeatable unit of a 
trigonometric graph. Frequency is the reciprocal of period. 
9. 
Graphing. Let TRIG be an arbitrary trigonometric function and let A 
and B be constants. The graph of y = A TRIG Bx can be obtained by 
drawing y = TRIG x and relabelling the x.- and y-axes. All of the 
y-values should be multiplied by A and the x-values should be divided 
by B . The effect is stretching and compressing. 
SOLUTIONS TO EVERY OTHER ODD EXERCISE 
1. 
The problem is analogous to Example 1. We use the formulas C = r6 and 
e 
A 
= r2e/2 . Remember that 8 must be expressed in radians. We convert 
8 
22' 
to 22x(n/180) = 0.3839 radians. Thus, C = re = lO(0.3839) =

The region lies between circles of radii 
.-,I 
2 and 3 , centered at the origin. The 
circle of radius 2 is also included. In 
addition, the region is further restricted 
in that it must lie between angles of 
-n/2 and n , inclusive. 
17. To make the conversion from cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates, 
use r = 
, cos 0 = x/r , and sin 0 = y/r . 0 can be found 
by using a trigonometric table or a calculator. 
(a) r = 
= 1 ; cos 0 = 1 irnplies 0 = 0 , so the polar 
coordinates are (1,O) . 
(b) r = /?= 
= 5 ; cos 0 = 315 implies 0 = k0.927 , but sin 0 = 
415 implies 0 = 0.927 , so the polar coordinates are (5,0.927) . 
(c) r = 
= 2 ; cos 8 = 6 1 2  implies 0 = kn/6 , but sin 0 = 
112 implies 0 = n/6 , so the polar coordinates are (2,n/6) . 
(d) r = J3 + (-1)2 = 2 ; cos 0 = 4712 implies 
= h 1 6  , but sin 8 = 
-112 implies 8 = -n/6 , so the polar coordinates are (2,-~/6) . 
(e) r =d(-fi)2 
+ (1)2 = 2 ; cos 0 = -4712 implies 0 
= k5n16 , but 
sin@= 1/2 implies 0 = 5n16 , so the polar coordinates are 
(2,5n/6) . 
Use the formulas x = r cos 0 and y = r sin 8 
to convert from polar 
coordinates to cartesian coordinates. 
(a) x = 6 cos(n/2) = 6(0) = 0 ; y = 6 sin(n/2) = 6(1) = 6 , so the 
cartesian coordinates are (0,6) .

Section 5.1 225 
21. (b) x = -12 cos(3~/4) = -12(-fi/2) = 6 6  ; y = -12 sin(3~/4) = -12(fi/2) = 
-6fi , so the cartesian coordinates are (6fi,-6fi) . 
(c) x = 4 cos(-K) = 4(-1) = -4 ; y = 4 sin(-n) = 4(0) = 0 , so the 
cartesian coordinates are (-4,O) . 
(d) x = 2 cos(131~/2) = 2 cos(x/2) = 2(0) = 0 ; y = 2 sin(13~/2) = 
2 sin('r12) = 2(1) = 2 , so the cartesian coordinates are (0,2) . 
(e) x = 8 cos(-2x13) = 8(-112) = -4 ; y = 8 sin(-2x13) = 8(-612) = 
- 4 6  , SO the cartesian coordinates are (-4,-46) . 
(f) x = -1 cos(2) = 0.42 ; y = -1 sin(2) = -0.91 , so the cartesian 
coordinates are (0.42,-0.91) . 
Referring to the figure, cos 0 = x/l and 
cos(-8) = x/l also; therefore, cos0= cos(-0) . 
29. By the definition of sine, we have 81c = sin(r/4) = &/2 . Therefore,

Let the height be h meters. Then tan 17'

h 
hl3000 implies h = 3000 tan 17'

37. Use the law of cosines: c2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos 0 where 0 is the measure 
of the angle (in radians) opposite c . Let x be the length of the un- 
known side. It is determined by lo2 = x2 + 52 - 2(x) (5)cos(4~/5) 
or 
2 
0 = x + 8.09~ - 75 . Thus, the quadratic formula gives x % 13.60 . Now, 
the law of cosines yields 52 = lo2 + (13.60)~ - 2(10) (13.60)cos r or 
cos r = 0.956 , i.e., r = 0.30 radians.

41. From the text, we get cos(8 - Q,) = cos @ cos 8 + sin Q, sin 8 and 
cos(8 + 4) = cos 0 cos Q, - sin 8 sin Q, . Subtract to get cos(8 - Q,j - 
cos(8 + 4) = 2 sin 0 sin Q, . Division by two gives the desired product 
formula. 
45. By the addition formula, cos(3~/2 - 8) = cos(3~/2)cos 8+ sin(3n/2)sin0 
O*cos8+ (-1) sine= -sin 0 . 
49. Using the addition formulas, we get cos(8 + ~/2)sin(Q, - 3~12) 
= 
[cos 8 cos(~I2) - sin 8 sin(~r/2)1 [sin Q, cos(3n12) - cos Q, sin(3~12)I = 
[O-cos 8 - 1-sin 81 (0-sin$ - (-1) cos $ 1  
= - sin 8 cos 6 . 
53. Use the half-angle formula. cos(n/l2) = cos [(n/6)/21 
= fi + COS(T/~)] 12 = 
+iTEjZ = 4 3 / 2  . NOW sec(v/l2) = 1/cos(n/i2) = 2 / f i .  
57. Take the reciprocal of both sides and use the half-angle formula

cos (812) = (1 + cos 8)/2 . Then sec (812) = (2 sec 8)/(sec 8 + 1) 
2 
implies cos (812) = (see 8 + 1)/(2 
sec 8) = 112 + 1/(2 sec 8) = 1/2 +

(cos 8)/2 = (1 +cos 8)/2 = cos (8/2) .

We obtain y = 2 cos 38 by compressing

From Fig. 5.1.4(f), 
notice that the concavity changes at -3~12 , - ~ / 2  , 
F/2 , and 3n/2 . In general, the inflection points for cot 0 are

(b) If vl = v2 , then sin 
= sin O2 
implies

the angle of incidence is the same as the angle of refraction, so 
the light travels in a straight line. 
(c) We have v2 = v1/2 , so v1/v2 = 2 = sin(45O)/sin O2 = (fi/2)/ 
sin e2 . This implies sin 0

We will show that sina /a = 1/2R where 
R is the radius of the circumscribed circle. 
Let BD be a diameter of the circle, then 
geometry tells us that LBCD is a right angle. 
Therefore, sin 4 = a/2R . Angle a and 
angle 4 
subtend the same arc, so a = 4 
and 
sin a = a / 2 ~  . Consequently, sin a/a = 1 / 2 ~  .

sin 4 = 0 for 4 = nv , where n is an integer; therefore, we 
solve na sin B/A = nv . The solution is sin 8 = nX/a , so 8

(c) When na sin @/A is close to zero, Exercise 74 tells us that the

STUDY HINTS 
1. 
Derivative of sine, cosine. For the purposes of this course, you should 
memorize that the derivative of sin x and cos x are cos x and 
-sin x , respectively. It is not essential to know the derivation. 
Don't forget the minus sign in (d/dx)cos x = -sin x . 
2. 
Other derivatives of trigonometric functions. You may find it easier to 
write the other trigonometric functions in terms of sin and cos and 
then use the rules of differentiation to derive the derivatives. On the 
other hand, you may prefer to memorize the differentiation formulas. One 
can simply memorize the derivatives of tan and sec and then remember 
that the derivatives of thecofunctionsare the negative cofunctions. For 
2 
example, we know that (d/dx)tan x = sec x . Then, since cot x and 
csc x are the cofunctions of tan x and sec x , respectively, we get 
2 
(d/dx)cot x = -csc x . 
3. 
Trigonometric antiderivatives. There is really nothing new to learn, but 
it is important to get used to the notation and to reading the differentia- 
tion formulas backwards. The antidifferentiation formulas follow directly 
from the differentiation formulas derived in this section.

Guess that the antiderivative is a cos(u/2) . Differentiation gives

Therefore, the integral is (1/2)(-112) 
cos 20 + C = -cos 2014 + C . 
The antiderivative should have the form a cos(8/4) . Differentiation

f (x) = -COS X , SO f'yx) + f(x) = 0 .

Since f '(x) = l/x , we have -(l/cos 0) (-sin 8) = 
tan 0 . Thus, -f(cos 8) + C is the antiderivative for tan 0 .

(3x) cos XI = @ (3x) * (-sin x) +

Inverses. For most cases, we express a function by y = f(x) . If it 
is possible to uniquely find x in terms of y , then we say that x 
is the inverse of y . However, in many instances, an inverse may

"flipping" axes make this statement plausible? 
3. 
Inverse function test. All the test says is that any part of a function 
that is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing is invertible. Think 
about what problem exists if the function is not strictly increasing or 
strictly decreasing. The domain is [f (a) ,f (b)] or [f (b) , f (a)] ; just 
be sure the smaller number comes first. 
4 .  
Inverse function rule. Probably the easiest formula to remember is 
dx/dy = l/(dy/dx) 
because the differentials act like regular fractions. 
The formula is very easy to use if you are differentiating at a specific 
point (See Example 8). 
If you want to differentiate an inverse function, 
you need to know both the function and its inverse. The best way to 
learn to use the formula is to study Example 7 and practice. (You will 
get more practice in the next section.)

f ' (x) = 2 does not change sign, so f (x) 
has an inverse. We have 
f(x) = y = 2x + 5  , f(-4) = -3 , and f(4) = 13 . Solving for the 
independent variable in terms of the dependent variable, we get x = 
(y - 5)/2 . Changing the names of the variables yields f-'(x)

hl(c) = [(t + 3) - (t - lo)] /(t + 312 = 13/(t + 312 does not change 
sign, so h(t)

h(-1) = -1112 , and h(1) = -914 . Solving for the independent 
variable in terms of the dependent variable, we get ht + 3h = t - 10 
or t(h - 1) = -3h - 10 . Thus, the inverse is t = (3h + 10)/(1 - h)

Notation. In this text and most others, sin x is the inverse function 
2 
of sin x , not l/sin x . Do not confuse this notation with sin x or 
3 
sin x , which mean (sin x12 and (sin x ) ~  
, respectively. The notation 
arcsin, arccos, etc., is also commonly used to designate inverse trigono- 
metric functions.

2. 
Inverse sine. Rememberthat angles are expressed in radians. We have 
chosen x to be in [-1~/2,n/21 . Since x = sinmly means sin x = y , 
note that y must be ,in [-I, 11 . 
3. 
Trigonometric functions of inverses. Be sure you understand Example 
2(b). 
By drawing an arbitrary right triangle and labelling it appro- 
priately by using the definitions of the trigonometric functions and 
Pythagoras' theorem, one can easily find the other trigonometric functions. 
4. 
Range for which inverses exist. The angles for which the trigonometric 
functions have inverses include those in the first quadrant of the xy- 
plane and the adjacent (second or fourth) quadrant in which the function 
is negative. If there are two choices, then choose the quadrant which 
maintains continuity. 
5. 
Derivatives. You may desire to learn to derive the derivatives of the 
inverses by using the inverse function rule, but it can be time consuming. 
If memorizing is your forte, you only need to know the derivatives of 
- 1

sin y , tan y , and sec y . The derivatives of the inverses of the 
cofunctions are the same except for a sign change.

Derivative of sec x , csc x . Notice that the donominator is a square 
root which is positive. Thus, Jy2(y2 - 1) 
simplifies to 1 yl dy2 - 1 . 
The absolute value sign is a necessity. See Example 8.

Typical word problem. Example 1 should be studied carefully. The word 
"revolution" should immediately translate into " 2 ~  
radians" in your head. 
Also, since angles are involved, try to relate given and unknown quantities 
in terms of trigonometric functions.

2. 
Review and practice. Many of these problems rely on the chain rule to 
relate distances, angles, and time. If necessary, review the chain rule 
and problem solving techniques from Section 3.5. As always, practice is 
important. 
3. 
Graphing. The usual techniques of graphing carry over to trigonometric 
functions. One new aspect is periodicity, which simplifies your work 
tremendously. Note any symmetry or periodicity first. Note that if a 
function is a sum of trigonometric functions, the period is the largest 
of the periods of the terms.

6 sin 2t) + 2(3 cos 3t - 3 sin 2t)(-9 
sin 3t - 6 cos 2t) = 21-45 cos 2t x 
cos 3t + 45 sin 2t sin 3t] = -90 cos 5t . Thus, the critical points are 
at (2n + 1)~/10 , where n is an integer. At n/10 , d = 0 , but at 
3~110 , d = 6 , so the maximum distance between A and B is 6 . 
(Notice that if we maximize the distance itself, the derivative is more 
complicative; however, the critical points are found by solving essentially 
the same equation.) 
The total time is T = J(x2 - x1)2 + yf + 
J(x3 - x2)2 + y5/3 . To minimize the time, we 
find x2 such that dT/dx2 = 0 .

we must solve (x2 - xl) / J(x2 - x1)2 + y:

Example 2, the left-hand side is sin 0

(a) We use the formula for the length of days. For this problem, we 
have i = 0 because the location is at the equator; T = 0 by 
16.71 
0.0 
definition; and dA/dt is the quantity of interest. Therefore, 
the equation reduces to sin A = 41 - sin*a[cos(2~t/24)] . Dif- 
ferentiating both sides with respect to t gives cos ~ ( d ~ / d t )  
= 
41 - sin2a[-sin(2~t/24)] (2~124) . The formula tells us that all 
17 
10.2 
days at the equator are 12 hours long, so t = 18 at sunrise. 
Also, we know that A = 0 at sunrise, so (dA/dt) = (~112)

41 - sin2a = 0.24 radianslhour or 13.76' /hour .

At = AA/(dA/dt) = ~~/(13.76~/hr.)

57. (a) We want to find an interval in which f(x) 
is strictly increasing 
or decreasing. f '(k) 
= 3x2 - 3 implies the critical points are 
f 1 ; therefore, the interval containing zero is [-I, 
11 . 
(b) f (x) < 0 in [-I, 11 , so it is decreasing and the domain of g 
is [f(b),f(a)] 
= [5,9] . 
(c) By inspection, f (0) = 7 , so g(7) = 0 . Therefore, by the in-

The tangent line is given by y = yo + m(x - xo) , where yo = r sin 0 , 
x0 = r cos 0 , and m = [(tan 0)(dr/d0) + rl / [dr/d0 - r tan 01 . Here 
dr/d0 = -4 sin 40 . At 0 = ~r/4 , tan(~/4) = 1 , r = cos IT = -1 , 
xO = (-1) cos (n/4) = -a12 , and yo = (-1) sin(n/4) = -612 . Thus, 
m = [(I) (0) + (-I)] / [O - (-1) (I)] 
= -1 , and the tangent line is y = 
(-JZi2) + (-1) [x - (-JT/2)] = -x - fi . 
81. We use the chain rule and the inverse function rule. Let y =

then the chain rule tells us that ' (x) = (dg/dy) * (dy/dx) . Now 
according to the inverse function rule, dgldy = l~f'(~(~)) = 11 
f ' (f-'(y)) 
= l/f (f-I(&))

"lawn", so he concludes, "must be reading about building houses." A 
friend tells him that people use the formula A = P[1 + (r/100n)] nt in 
the housing loan business. (This formula is explained on p. 331 of the 
text. )

Be able to differentiate exponential and logarithmic functions. 
2. 
Be able to use the technique of logarithmic differentiation to differ- 
entiate certain functions. 
STUDY HINTS 
1. 
The number e . Similar to n , e has a specific value; it is not a 
variable. 
Its value is approximately 2.718 ... . 
2. 
Notation and definitions. 
Logarithms to the base e are called 
natural logarithms; it is usually denoted by lnx rather than log x . 
logx, without a base written, is understood to be the common logarithm, 
* 
which uses 10 as its base. exp x , without an associated base, is 
understood to be ex , whereas exp x means bX . 
b 
* Except in more advanced courses, where log x means In x, since loglox is 
rarely used.

3. 
Derivatives of exponential functions. d(ex) /dx = ex is something that 
should be memorized. We do not commonly differentiate bX , so its 
derivative is easy to forget. Therefore, if we remember that b = 
exp(1n b) , then bX = exp(x In b) and the chain rule may be used to 
get d(bx) /dx = bXln b . WARNING: nX and xn , for constant n , 
are differentiated differently. 
4. 
Derivatives of logarithmic functions. Memorize (d/dx)(ln 
x) = l/x . 
As with exponentials, logarithms in bases other than e are not often 
used. One can derive (d/dx)log,,x 
= l/(ln b)x 
by writing by = x as 
e(ln b)Y= x ,  so in x =  (In b)y= (In b)logbx, or logbx= Inx/In b 
Differentiating yields (d/ddlogbx = l/x In b . 
5. 
Logarithmic differentiation. This technique is used mainly to differ- 
entiate x to some variable power or complex expressions involving nu- 
merical powers. The technique is to take the logarithm of both sides, 
differentiate, and then solve for dy/dx . Note that (d/dx)(ln y) = 
(l/y)(dy/dx) . Don't forget to express your answer in terms of the 
original variable. Study Examples 7 and 8. 
6. 
Integration. As usual, once you have learned the differentiation for- 
mulas, you can easily recover the antidifferentiation formulas. Note 
that we do not have a special antidifferentiation formula to recover 
log x . This is because if we integrate (d/dx)logbx = l/(ln b)x , we 
b 
get [l/ (ln b)] /(dx/x) , which is one of the given formulas. However, 
it is still correct to write / [dx/(ln b)xl 
= logbx + C . Also, note 
that /(dx/x) = In 1x1 + C , not just In x + C , unless x is re- 
stricted to be positive.
