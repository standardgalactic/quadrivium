What is Quantum Theory?
Quantum theory is the most successful set of ideas ever devised by human
beings. It explains the periodic chart of the elements and why chemical reactions
take place. It gives accurate predictions about the operation of lasers and
microchips, the stability of DNA and how alpha particles tunnel out of the
nucleus.
QUANTUM THEORY IS NON-INTUITIVE AND DEFIES COMMON SENSE.
RECENTLY, ITS CONCEPTS HAVE BEEN LIKENED TO EASTERN PHILOSOPHY AND USED TO PROBE THE SECRETS OF CONSCIOUSNESS, FREE WILL AND THE PARANORMAL.
THIS BOOK ANSWERS THE QUESTION: WHERE DID QUANTUM THEORY COME FROM?
QUANTUM THEORY HAS NEVER FAILED

Niels Bohr’s presentation of quantum theory in 1927 remains today’s orthodoxy.
But Einstein’s thought experiments in the 1930s questioned the theory’s
fundamental validity and are still debated today. Could he be right again? Is
there something missing? Let’s begin at the beginning . . .
The problem is this. Just before the turn of the century, physicists were so
absolutely certain of their ideas about the nature of matter and radiation that any
new concept which contradicted their classical picture would be given little
consideration.
Not only was the mathematical formalism of Isaac Newton (1642–1727) and
James Clerk Maxwell (1831–79) impeccable, but predictions based on their
theories had been confirmed by careful detailed experiments for 4 many years.
The Age of Reason had become the age of certainty!
QUANTUM THEORY HAS NEVER FAILED.
QUANTUM THEORY IS ESSENTIALLY MATHEMATICAL. . .
ITS STRUCTURE HAS REVOLUTIONISED HOW THE PHYSICAL WORLD IS VIEWED.
YOU KNOW, IT’S EASIER TO EXPLAIN QUANTUM THEORY TO AN ABSOLUTE BEGINNER THAN TO A CLASSICAL PHYSICIST.
YOU’RE KIDDING. WHAT’S THEIR PROBLEM, THESE CLASSICAL GUYS, WITH THE MODERN THEORY?

Classical Physicists
What is the definition of “classical”?
By classical is meant those late 19th century physicists nourished on an
academic diet of Newton’s mechanics and Maxwell’s electromagnetism – the
two most successful syntheses of physical phenomena in the history of thought.

Testing theories by observation had been the hallmark of good physics since
Galileo (1564–1642). He showed how to devise experiments, make
measurements and compare the results with the predictions of mathematical
laws.
The interplay of theory and experiment is still the best way to proceed in the
world of acceptable science.
WITH A SIMPLE INNCLINED PLAVE AND A METAL SPHERE, I DEMONSTRATED THAT THE GREAT ARISTOTLE’S PHYSICS WAS FLAWED.
OH, STOP SHOWING OFF!

It’s All Proven (and Classical). . .
During the 18th and 19th centuries, Newton’s laws of motion had been
scrutinized and confirmed by reliable tests.
MY GRAVITATION LAW HAS BEEN USED TO PREDICT MEASURED MOVEMENTS OF THE PLANETS WITH GREAT ACCURACY.

I PREDICTED THE EXISTENCE OF INVISIBLE “LIGHT” WAVES IN MY ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE THEORY OF 1865, AND HEINRICH HERTZ (1857–94) DETECTED THE SIGNALS
IN 1888 IN HIS BERLIN LABORATORY. NOW THEY’RE CALLED RADIO WAVES.

No wonder these classical physicists were confident in what they knew!
THESE WAVES REFLECT AND REFRACT JUST LIKE LIGHT. MAXWELL WAS RIGHT.

“Fill in the Sixth Decimal Place”
A classical physicist from Glasgow University, the influential Lord Kelvin
(1824–1907), spoke of only two dark clouds on the Newtonian horizon.
In June 1894, the American Nobel Laureate, Albert Michelson (1852–1931),
thought he was paraphrasing Kelvin in a remark which he regretted for the rest
of his life.
HOW WAS I TO KNOW THAT ONE OF THESE CLOUDS WOULD DISAPPEAR ONLY WITH THE ADVENT OF RELATIVITY – AND THE OTHER WOULD LEAD TO QUANTAM
THEORY?

ALL THAT REMAINS TO DO IN PHYSICS IS FILL IN THE SIXTH DECIMAL PLACE. (I CAN’T BELIEVE I SAID THAT!)

The Fundamental Assumptions of Classical Physics
Classical physicists had built up a whole series of assumptions which focused
their thinking and made the acceptance of new ideas very difficult. Here’s a list
of what they were sure of about the material world . . .
1) The universe was like a giant machine set in a framework of absolute time
and space. Complicated movement could be understood as a simple movement of
the machine’s inner parts, even if these parts can’t be visualized.
2) The Newtonian synthesis implied that all motion had a cause. If a body
exhibited motion, one could always figure out what was producing the motion.
This is simply cause and effect, which nobody really questioned.
3) If the state of motion was known at one point – say the present – it could be
determined at any other point in the future or even the past. Nothing was
uncertain, only a consequence of some earlier cause. This was determinism.
4) The properties of light are completely described by Maxwell’s
electromagnetic wave theory and confirmed by the interference patterns
observed in a simple double-slit experiment by Thomas Young in 1802.
5) There are two physical models to represent energy in motion: one a particle,
represented by an impenetrable sphere like a billiard ball, and the other a wave,
like that which rides towards the shore on the surface of the ocean. They are
mutually exclusive, i.e. energy must be either one or the other.

6) It was possible to measure to any degree of accuracy the properties of a
system, like its temperature or speed. Simply reduce the intensity of the
observer’s probing or correct for it with a theoretical adjustment. Atomic
systems were thought to be no exception.
Classical physicists believed all these statements to be absolutely true. But all
six assumptions would eventually prove to be in doubt. The first to know this
were the group of physicists who met at the Metropole Hotel in Brussels on 24
October 1927.

The Solvay Conference 1927 – Formulation of
Quantum Theory
A few years before the outbreak of World War I, the Belgian industrialist Ernest
Solvay (1838–1922) sponsored the first of a series of international physics
meetings in Brussels. Attendance at these meetings was by special invitation,
and participants – usually limited to about 30 – were asked to concentrate on a
pre-arranged topic.
The first five meetings held between 1911 and 1927 chronicled in a most
remarkable way the development of 20th century physics. The 1927 gathering
was devoted to quantum theory and attended by no less than nine theoretical
physicists who had made fundamental contributions to the theory. Each of the
nine would eventually be awarded a Nobel Prize for his contribution.

This photograph of the 1927 Solvay Conference is a good starting point for
introducing the principal players in the development of the most modern of all
physical theories. Future generations will marvel at the compressed time scale
and geographical proximity which brought these giants of quantum physics
together in 1927.
There is hardly any period in the history of science in which so much has
been clarified by so few in so short a time.
Look at the sad-eyed Max Planck (1858–1947) in the front row next to Marie
Curie (1867–1934). With his hat and cigar, Planck appears drained of vitality,
exhausted after years of trying to refute his own revolutionary ideas about matter
and radiation.
IT IS COMPARABLE TO SEEING US POSING TOGETHER TO COMMEEMORATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSICAL PHYSICS.

A few years later in 1905, a young patent clerk in Switzerland named Albert
Einstein (1879–1955) generalized Planck’s notion.
That’s Einstein in the front row centre, sitting stiffly in his formal attire. He had
been brooding for over twenty years about the quantum problem without any
real insights since his early 1905 paper. All the while, he continued to contribute
to the theory’s development and endorsed original ideas of others with uncanny
confidence. His greatest work – the General Theory of Relativity – which had
made him an international celebrity, was already a decade behind him.
I STARTED IT ALL IN 1900 BY POSTULATING THAT MATTER CAN ABSORB AND ADMIT ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION (I.E. LIGHT) ONLY IN ENERGY BUNDLES CALLED
QUANTA WHOSE SIZE IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE FREQUENCY OF THE RADIATION.

In Brussels, Einstein had debated the bizarre conclusions of the quantum theory
with its most respected and determined proponent, the “great Dane” Niels Bohr
(1885–1962). Bohr – more than anyone else – would become associated with the
struggle to interpret and understand the theory. At the far right of the photo, in
the middle row, he is relaxed and confident – the 42 year old professor at the
peak of his powers.
In the back row behind Einstein, Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961) looks
conspicuously casual in his sports jacket and bow tie. To his left but one are the
“young Turks”, Wolfgang Pauli (1900–58) and Werner Heisenberg (1901–76)
– still in their twenties – and in front of them, Paul Dirac (1902–84), Louis de
Broglie (1892–1987), Max Born (1882–1970) and Bohr. These men are today
immortalized by their association with the fundamental properties of the
microscopic world: the Schrödinger wave equation; the Pauli exclusion
principle; the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, the Bohr Atom . . . and so forth.
They were all there–from Planck, the oldest at 69 years, who started it all in
1900 – to Dirac, the youngest at 25 years, who completed the theory in 1928.
I SHOWED THAT LIGHT ALWAYS EXISTS AS QUANTA, WHICH IS, OF COURSE, WHY MATTER ABSORBS AND EMITS IT AS SUCH. TOO BAD PLANCK NEVER BELIEVED ME!
IN MY LECTURE, I REVIEWED THE PROBABILISIC INTERRETATION OF QUANTUM THEORY TO THE APPARENT SATISFACTION OF MOSTLY EVERYONE, EXCEPT EINSTEIN.

The day after this photograph was taken – 30 October 1927 – with the historic
exchanges between Bohr and Einstein still buzzing in their minds, the conferees
boarded trains at the Brussels Central Station to return to Berlin, Paris,
Cambridge, Göttingen, Copenhagen, Vienna and Zürich.

They were taking with them the most bizarre set of ideas ever concocted by
scientists. Secretly, most of them probably agreed with Einstein that this
madness called the quantum theory was just a step along the way to a more
complete theory and would be overthrown for something better, something more
consistent with common sense.
But how did the quantum theory come about? What experiments compelled
these most careful of men to ignore the tenets of classical physics and propose
ideas about nature that violated common sense?

Before we study these experimental paradoxes, we need some background in
thermodynamics and statistics which are fundamental to the development of
quantum theory.
What is Thermodynamics?
The word means the movement of heat, which always flows from a body of
higher temperature to a body of lower temperature, until the temperatures of the
two bodies are the same. This is called thermal equilibrium.
Heat is correctly described as a form of vibration . . .
THIS SEAT IS WARM. DID YOU LEAVE SOMETHING THERMAL BEHIND?
NO, IT’S JUST THAT THE MOLECULES IN THE SEAT ARE STILL VIBRATING AT THE SAME RATE AS MY BODY – WHICH IS APPARENTLY FASTER THAN YOURS – SO THE SEAT
FEELS WATM TO YOU.

The First Law of Thermodynamics
Mechanical models to explain the flow of heat developed quickly in 19th century
Britain, building on the achievements of James Watt (1736–1819), a Scot who
had built a working steam engine.
Soon after, the son of a Manchester brewer, James Prescott Joule (1818–89),
showed that a quantity of heat can be equated to a certain amount of mechanical
work.
THIS NEW MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE STUDY OF THERMODYNAMICS.

Then somebody said . . . “since heat can be converted into work, it must be a
form of energy” (the Greek word energy means “containing work”). But it
wasn’t until 1847 that a respectable academic scientist, Hermann von
Helmholtz (1821–94), stated . . .
This is called the law of the conservation of energy. It remains a foundation of
modern physics, unaffected by modern theories.
WHENEVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ENERGY DISAPPEARS IN ONE PLACE, AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT MUST APPEAR ELSEWHERE IN THE SAME SYSTEM.

Rudolf Clausius: Two Laws
In 1850, the German physicist Rudolf Clausius (1822–88) published a paper in
which he called the energy conservation law The First Law of Thermodynamics.
At the same time, he argued that there was a second principle of
thermodynamics in which there is always some degradation of the total energy
in the system, some non-useful heat in a thermodynamic process.
Clausius introduced a new concept called entropy – defined in terms of the heat
transferred from one body to another.

The entropy of an isolated system always increases, reaching a maximum at
thermal equilibrium, i.e. when all bodies in the system are at the same
temperature.
I SHOWED THAT THE TOTAL ENTROPY OF A SYSTEM INCREASES WHEN HEAT FLOWS FROM A HOT BODY (HIGHER TEMERATURE) TO A COLD ONE (LOWER
TEMPERATURE).
BUT SINCE HEAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN OBSERVED TO FLOW FROM HOT TO COLD, I COULD NOW STATE THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS.

The Existence of Atoms
A Greek philosopher named Democritus (c. 460–370 B.C.) first proposed the
concept of atoms (means “indivisible” in Greek).
ATOMS ARE THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS OF MATTER.

The idea was questioned by Aristotle and debated for hundreds of years before
the English chemist John Dalton (1766–1844) used the atomic concept to
predict the chemical properties of elements and compounds in 1806.

But it was not until a century later that a theoretical calculation by Einstein and
experiments by the Frenchman Jean Perrin (1870–1942) persuaded the sceptics
to accept the existence of atoms as a fact.
However, during the 19th century, even without physical proof of atoms, many
theorists used the concept.

Averaging Diatomic Molecules
The Scottish physicist J.C. Maxwell, a confirmed atomist, developed his kinetic
theory of gases in 1859.
I PICTURED THE GAS TO CONSIST OF BILLIONS OF MOLECULES MOVING RAPIDLY AT RANDOM, COLLIDING WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE WALLS OF THE
CONTAINER.

This was qualitatively consistent with the physical properties of gases, if we
accept the notion that heating causes the molecules to move faster and bang into
the container walls more frequently.
Maxwell’s theory was based on statistical averages to see if the macroscopic
properties (that is, those properties that can be measured in a laboratory) could

be predicted from a microscopic model for a collection of gas molecules.
THE MOLECULES ARE LIKE HARD SPHERES WITH THEIR DIAMETERS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM.
THE COLLISIONS BETWEEN MOLECULES CONSERVE ENERGY.
THE MOLECULES MOVE BETWEEN COLLISIONS WITHOUT INTERACTING AT A CONSTANT SPEED IN A STRAIGHT LINE.
THE POSITIONS AND VELOCITIES OF THE MOLECULES ARE INITIALLY AT RANDOM.

It would be impossible to try to compute the individual motions of so many
particles. But Maxwell’s analysis, based on Newton’s mechanics, showed that
temperature is a measure of the microscopic mean squared velocity of the
molecules. That is, the average velocity multiplied by itself.
WHY DID I USE AVERAGES? COULDN’T I CALCULATE THE MOTION OF THE MOLECULES EXACTLY USING NEWTON’S LAWS?
IN A WORD, NO . . . I COULDN’T. THAT’S WHY I CHOSE STATISTICAL AVERAGES.
THINK OF IT. EVEN A SMALL QUANTITY OF GAS, SAY ONE MOLE, CONTAINS 6×1023 MOLECULES. LOOKS RIDICULOUS WHEN IT’S WRITTEN DOWN. . .

Heat is thus caused by the ceaseless random motion of atoms.
The real importance of Maxwell’s theory is the prediction of the probable
velocity distribution of the molecules, based on his model. In other words, this
gives the range of velocities . . . how the whole collection deviates from the
average.
This is the well known curve which physicists today call the Maxwell
Distribution. It gives useful information about the billions and billions of
molecules, even though the motion of an individual molecule can never be
calculated. This is the use of probabilities when an exact calculation is
impossible in practice.
BY ASSUMING THAT THE GAS PARTICLES WERE MOVING UNIFORMLY IN SPACE, WERE MUTUALLY INDEPENDENT AND HAD NO PREFERRED DIRECTION, I COULD
COMPUTE THE PROBABILITY THAT A MOLECULE CHOSEN AT RANDOM WOULD HAVE A PARTICULAR VELOCITY.


Ludwig Boltzmann and Statistical Mechanics
In the 1870s, Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) – inspired by Maxwell’s kinetic
theory – made a theoretical pronouncement.
• He presented a general probability distribution law called the canonical or
orthodox distribution which could be applied to any collection of entities
which have freedom of movement, are independent of each other and interact
randomly.
• He formalized the theorem of the equipartition of energy.
This means that the energy will be shared equally among all degrees of freedom
if the system reaches thermal equilibrium.
• He gave a new interpretation of the Second Law.
When energy in a system is degraded (as Clausius said in 1850), the atoms in the
system become more disordered and the entropy increases. But a measure of the
disorder can be made. It is the probability of the particular system – defined as
the number of ways it can be assembled from its collection of atoms.

More precisely, the entropy is given by:
S = k Log W . . .
where k is a constant (now called Boltzmann’s constant) and W is the
probability that a particular arrangement of atoms will occur. This work made
Boltzmann the creator of statistical mechanics, a method in which the properties
of macroscopic bodies are predicted by the statistical behaviour of their

constituent microscopic parts.

Thermal Equilibrium and Fluctuations
I ASSUMED THAT A SYSTEM WILL EVOLVE FROM A LESS PROBABLE STATE TO A MORE PROBABLE STATE WHEN AGITATED BY HEAT OR MECHANICAL VIBRATION, UNTIL
THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM IS REACHED. AT EQUILIBRIUM, THE SYSTEM WILL BE IN ITS MOST PROBABLE STATE WHEN THE ENTROPY IS A MAXIMUM.
IT’S IMPOSSIBLE TO CALCULATE THE MOTION OF BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF PARTICLES. BUT THE PROBABILITY METHOD CAN GIVE DIRECT ANSWERS FOR THE MOST
PROBABLE STATE.
I ALSO INTRODUCED THE CONTROVERSIAL NOTION OF FLUCTUATIONS.
A SMALL PROBABILITY EXISTS THAT ALL THE MOLECULES OF A SYSTEM OF CONFINED GAS MIGHT APPEAR FOR AN INSTANT IN JUST ONE CORNER OF THE CONTAINER.
THIS POSSIBILITY MUST EXIST IF THE PROBABILISTIC INTERPRETATION OF THE ENTROPY IS TO BE ALLOWED. THIS IS CALLED AN ENERGY FLUCTUATION.

These new ideas – using probabilities and statistics of microscopic systems to
predict the macroscopic properties which can be measured in the laboratory (like
temperature, pressure, etc.) – underlie all of what was to come in quantum
theory.

The Thirty Years War (1900–30) – Quantum Physics
Versus Classical Physics
Now let’s look at three critical experiments in the pre-quantum era which could
not be explained by a straightforward application of classical physics.
Each involved the interaction of radiation and matter as reported by reliable,
experimental scientists. The measurements were accurate and reproducible, yet
paradoxical . . . the kind of situation a good theoretical physicist would die for.

We will describe each experiment step-by-step, pointing out the crisis
engendered and the solution advanced by Max Planck, Albert Einstein and Niels
Bohr respectively. In putting forward their solutions, these scientists made the
first fundamental contributions to a new understanding of nature. Today the
combined work of these three men, culminating in the Bohr model of the atom in
1913, is known as the Old Quantum Theory.

Black-Body Radiation
When an object is heated, it emits radiation consisting of electromagnetic waves,
i.e. light, with a broad range of frequencies.

The dominant frequency shifts to a higher value as the temperature is increased,
as shown in the graph drawn from measurements made in the late 19th century.
MEASUREMENTS MADE ON THE RADIATION ESCAPING FROM A SMALL HOLE IN A CLOSED HEATED OVEN – WHICH IN GERMANY WE CALL A CAVITY – SHOWS THAT THE
INTENSITY OF THE RADIATION VARIES VERY STRONGLY WITH THE FREQUENCY OF THE RADIATION.

A black-body is a body that completely absorbs all the electromagnetic radiation
falling on it. Inside a cavity, the radiation has nowhere to go and is continuously
being absorbed and re-emitted by the walls. Thus, a small opening will give off
radiation emitted by the walls, not reflected, and thus is characteristic of the
black body.
When the oven is only just warm, radiation is present but we can’t see it because
it does not stimulate the eye. As it gets hotter and hotter, the frequencies reach
the visible range and the cavity glows red like a heating ring on an electric

the visible range and the cavity glows red like a heating ring on an electric
cooker.
This is how early potters determined the temperature inside their kilns.
Already in 1792, the famous porcelain maker Josiah Wedgwood had noted that
all bodies become red at the same temperature.
UNDER EQUILIBRIUM CONDITIONS, THE RADIATION DEPENDS ONLY ON THE TEMPERATURE. AT ABOUT 800 DEGREES CENTIGRADE, NO MATTER WHAT IS IN THE OVEN –
COAL, GLASS, OR METAL – A UNIFORM RED COLOUR IS SEEN.

In 1896, a friend of Planck’s, Wilhelm Wien, and others in the Berlin
Reichsanstalt (Bureau of Standards) physics department put together an
expensive, empty cylinder of porcelain and platinum.
At Berlin’s Technische Hochschule, another of Planck’s close associates,
Heinrich Rubens, operated a different oven.
WE RECORDED THE COLOUR DISTRIBUTION OF RADIATION ALLOWED TO ESCAPE FROM A HOLE IN ONE OF ITS ENDS, MEASURING FROM THE NEAR INFRARED INTO THE
VIOLET.

WE MEASURED INTO THE DEEP INFRARED FREQUENCIES.

These radiation curves – one of the central problems of theoretical physics in the
late 1890s – were shown to be very similar to those calculated by Maxwell for
the velocity (i.e. energy) distribution of heated gas molecules in a closed
container.

Paradoxical Results
Could this black-body radiation problem be studied in the same way as
Maxwell’s ideal gas . . . electromagnetic waves (instead of gas molecules)
bouncing around in equilibrium with the walls of a closed container?
Wien derived a formula, based on some dubious theoretical arguments which
agreed well with published experiments, but only at the high frequency part of
the spectrum.
The English classical physicists Lord Rayleigh (1842–1919) and Sir James
Jeans (1877–1946) used the same theoretical assumptions as Maxwell had done
with his kinetic theory of gases.

The equation of Rayleigh and Jeans agreed well at low frequencies but they got
a real shock at the high frequency region. The classical theory predicted an
infinite intensity for the ultraviolet region and beyond, as shown in the graph.
This was dubbed the ultraviolet catastrophe.
What does this experimental result actually mean?
BUT WE PUT WAVES INTO OUR CONTAINER INSTEAD OF PARTICLES.

What Went Wrong?
The Rayleigh-Jeans result is clearly wrong, otherwise anyone who looked into
the cavity (or Mr. Wedgwood into his kiln). . .

If classical physicists had their way, the romantic glow of the embers would
soon turn into life-threatening radiation. Something had to be done!
I WOULD HAVE MY EYEBALLS BURNED OUT!
THE ULTRAVIOLET CATASTROPHE BECAME A SERIOUS PARADOX FOR CLASSICAL PHYSICS.
IF RAYLEIGH AND JEANS WERE RIGHT, IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR US EVEN TO SIT IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE.

The Ultraviolet Catastrophe
Everyone agreed that Rayleigh and Jeans’ method was sound, so it is instructive
to examine what they actually did and why it didn’t work.

WE APPLIED THE STATISTICAL PHYSICS METHOD TO THE WAVES BY ANALOGY WITH MAXWELL’S GAS PARTICLES USING THE EQUIPARTITION OF ENERGY, I.E. WE
ASSUMED THAT THE TOTAL ENERGY OF RADIATION IS DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY AMONG ALL POSSIBLE VIBRATION FREQUENCIES.
BUT THERE IS ONE BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE CASE OF WAVES. THERE IS NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF MODES OF VIBRATION THAT CAN BE EXCITED . . .
. . . BECAUSE IT’S EASY TO FIT MORE AND MORE WAVES INTO THE CONTAINER AT HIGHER AND HIGHER FREQUENCIES (I.E. THE WAVELENGTHS GET SMALLER AND
SMALLER).
CONSEQUENTLY, THE AMOUNT OF RADIATION PREDICTED BY THE THEORY IS UNLIMITED AND SHOULD KEEP GETTING STRONGER AND STRONGER AS THE
TEMPERATURE IS RAISED AND THE FREQUENCY INCREASES.
NO WONDER IT WAS KNOWN AS THE ULTRAVIOLET CATASTROPHE.

Enter Max Planck
Planck’s story begins in the physics department of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
in Berlin, just before the turn of the century.
Planck was a very conservative member of the Prussian Academy, steeped in
traditional methods of classical physics and a passionate advocate of
thermodynamics. In fact, from his PhD thesis days in 1879 (the year Einstein
was born) to his professorship at Berlin twenty years later, he had worked almost
exclusively on problems related to the laws of thermodynamics. He believed that
the Second Law, concerning entropy, went deeper and said more than was
generally accepted
I AM REPEATEDLY BEING CONFRONTED WITH RELIABLE EXPERIMENTAL DATA ON BLACK-BODY RADIATION FROM MY OWN FRIENDS’ EXPERIMENTS WHICH SIMPLY
CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY ANY ACCPETED THEORY.

generally accepted.
Planck was attracted by the absolute and universal aspects of the black-body
problem. Plausible arguments showed that at equilibrium, the curve of radiation
intensity versus frequency should not depend on the size or shape of the cavity
or on the materials of its walls. The formula should contain only the temperature,
the radiation frequency and one or more universal constants which would be the
same for all cavities and colours.
Finding this formula would mean discovering a relationship of quite
fundamental theoretical interest.
History has proved Planck’s insight to be more profound than even he thought.
In 1990, scientists using the COBE satellite measured the background radiation
at the edge of the universe (i.e. left over from the Big Bang), and found a perfect
fit to his Black-Body Radiation Law.
THIS RADIATION LAW, WHENEVER IT IS FOUND, WILL BE INDEPENDENT OF SPECIAL BODIES AND SUBSTANCES AND WILL RETAIN ITS IMPORTANCE FOR ALL TIMES AND
CULTURES . . .
EVEN FOR NON-TERRESTRIAL AND NON-HUMAN ONES.


Pre-Atomic Model of Matter
Planck knew the measurements by his friends Heinrich Rubens and Ferdinand
Kurlbaum were extremely reliable.
Planck started by introducing the idea of a collection of electric oscillators* in
the walls of the cavity, vibrating back and forth under thermal agitation.
IT BECAME IMPORTANT FOR ME TO PUT MY MAXIMUM ENERGY INTO MAKING THIS THEORETICAL CALCULATION ON THE CAVITY RADIATION.

(*Note! Nothing was known about atoms.)
Planck assumed that all possible frequencies would be present. He also expected
the average frequency to increase at higher temperatures as heating the walls
caused the oscillators to vibrate faster and faster until thermal equilibrium was
reached.
The electromagnetic theory could tell everything about the emission, absorption
and propagation of the radiation, but nothing about the energy distribution at
equilibrium. This was a thermodynamic problem.
Planck made certain assumptions, relating the average energy of the oscillators
to their entropy, thereby obtaining a formula for the intensity of the radiation
which he hoped would agree with the experimental results.
Planck tried to alter his expression for the entropy of the radiation by
INITIALLY, I SIMPLY WANTED TO FIND A PROOF FOR THE FORMULA DERIVED BY MY FRIEND WIEN, WHICH EVERYONE THOUGHT TO BE CORRECT.
BUT THE MOST RECENT MEASUREMENTS BEGAN TO CAST DOUBTS ON WIEN’S EQUATION IN THE INFRARED OR LOW FREQUENCY REGION. DISCREPANCIES GREATER
THAN THE POSSIBLE EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS WERE FOUND.

Planck tried to alter his expression for the entropy of the radiation by
generalizing it, and eventually arrived at a new formula for the radiation
intensity over the entire frequency range.
IT WORKS!
IT FITS THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA PERFECTLY. I WILL COMMUNICATE THE FORMULA AT THE PHYSICS SEMINAR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN ON 19 OCTOBER 1900.
THIS IS INSPITE OF THE FACT THAT I DON’T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

The constants C1 and C2 are numbers chosen by Planck to make the equation fit
the experiments.
Among those present at the historic seminar was Heinrich Rubens. He went
home immediately to compare his measurements with Planck’s formula.
Working through the night, he found perfect agreement and told Planck early
next morning.
Planck had found the correct formula for the radiation law. Fine. But could he
now use the formula to discover the underlying physics?

Planck’s Predicament
That light was
. . . FROM THE VERY DAY I FORMULATED THE RADIATION LAW, I BEGAN TO DEVOTE MYSELF TO THE TASK OF INVESTING IT WITH TRUE PHYSICAL MEANING.
AFTER TRYING EVERY POSSIBLE APPROACH USING TRADITIONAL CLASSICAL APPLICATIONS OF THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS, I WAS DESPERATE.
COME ON MAX, DON’T BE SO STUBBORN, IT’S WORTH A TRY.
I WAS FORCED TO CONSIDER THE RELATION BETWEEN ENTROPY AND PROBABILITY ACCORDING TO BOLTZMANN’S IDEAS. AFTER SOME OF THE MOST INTENSE WEEKS
OF MY LIFE, THE LIGHT BEGAN TO APPEAR TO ME . . .

S = k Log W
(Boltzmann’s version of the Second Law of Thermodynamics).
Not once in any of the forty or so papers that Planck wrote prior to 1900 did he
use, or even refer to, Boltzmann’s statistical formulation of the Second Law!

Chopping Up the Energy
So, Planck applied three of Boltzmann’s ideas about entropy.
1) His statistical equation to calculate the entropy.
2) His condition that the entropy must be a maximum (i.e. totally disordered) at
equilibrium.
3) His counting technique to determine the probability W in the entropy
equation.
To calculate the probability of the various possible arrangements, Planck
followed Boltzmann’s method of dividing the energy of the oscillators into
arbitrarily small but finite chunks. So the total energy was written as E = N e
where N is an integer and e an arbitrarily small amount of energy, e would
eventually become infinitesimally small as the chunks became infinite in
number, consistent with the mathematical procedure.

I FOUND THAT I HAD TO CHOOSE ENERGY UNITS PROPORTIONAL TO THE OSCILLATOR FREQUENCIES, NAMELY e = h f, IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE CORRECT FORM FOR THE
TOTAL ENERGY. f IS THE FREQUENCY AND h IS A CONSTANT WHICH WOULD EVENTUALLY DECREASE TO ZERO.

A Quantum of Energy
Eureka! Planck had stumbled across a mathematical method which at last gave
some theoretical basis for his experimental radiation law – but only if the
energy is discontinuous.
BUT THEN A REMARKABLE THING HAPPENED. IF I ALLOWED THE ENERGY CHUNKS TO GO TO ZERO AS THE PROCEDURE DEMANDED, THE GENERAL VALIDITY OF THE
DERIVED EQUATION WAS DESTROYED. HOWEVER. . .
I NOTICED THAT IF I DID NOT REQUIRE THAT ENERGY OR h GO TO ZERO, I OBTAINED MY OWN EXACT RADIATION FORMULA. . .WHICH I KNEW WAS CORRECT.

Even though he had no reason whatsoever to propose such a notion, he accepted
it provisionally, for he had nothing better. He was thus forced to postulate that
the quantity e = h f must be a finite amount and h is not zero.
Thus, if this is correct, it must be concluded that it is not possible for an
oscillator to absorb and emit energy in a continuous range. It must gain and lose
energy discontinuously, in small indivisible units of e = h f, which Planck called
“energy quanta”.
Planck’s quantum relation thus inhibits the equipartition of energy and not all
modes have the same total energy. This is why we don’t get sunburn from a cup
of coffee. (Think about it!)
The classical approach of Rayleigh-Jeans works fine at low frequencies, where
all the available vibrational modes can be excited. At high frequencies, even
NOW YOU CAN SEE WHY THE CLASSICAL THEORY FAILED IN THE HIGH FREQUENCY REGION OF THE BLACK-BODY CURVE. IN THIS REGION THE QUANTA ARE SO LARGE
(e = h f) THAT ONLY A FEW VIBRATION MODES ARE EXCITED.
WITH A DECREASING NUMBER OF MODES TO EXCITE, THE OSCILLATORS ARE SUPPRESSED AND THE RADIATION DROPS OFF TO ZERO AT THE HIGH FREQUENCY END. THE
ULTRAVIOLET CATASTROPHE DOES NOT OCCUR.

though plenty of modes of vibration are possible (recall it’s easier to stuff short
waves into a box), not many are excited because it costs too much energy to
make a quantum at a high frequency, since e = h f.
During his early morning walk on 14 December 1900, Planck told his son that he
may have produced a work as important as that of Newton. Later that same day,
he presented his results to the Berlin Physical Society signalling the birth of
quantum physics.
It had taken him less than two months to find an explanation for his own black-
body radiation formula. Ironically, the discovery was accidental, caused by an
incomplete mathematical procedure. An ignominious start to one of the
greatest revolutions in the history of physics!
– but it is not zero! If it were, we would never be able to sit in front of fire. In
fact, the whole universe would be different. Be thankful for the little things in
life.
Surprisingly, in spite of the important and revolutionary aspects of the black-
body formula, it did not draw much attention in the early years of the 20th
century. Even more surprisingly, Planck himself was not convinced of its
validity.

Now to the second experiment which could not be explained by classical
physics. It is more simple, yet inspired a more profound explanation.
I WAS SO SCEPTICAL OF THE UNIVERSALITY OF BOLTZMANN’S ENTROPY LAW THAT I SPENT YEARS TRYING TO EXPLAIN MY RESULTS IN A LESS REVOLUTIONARY WAY.

The Photoelectric Effect
While Max Planck was struggling with the black-body problem, another German
physicist, Philipp Lenard (1862–1947) was focusing beams of cathode rays
(soon to be identified as electrons) at thin metal foils.
Though this effect had been noticed by Heinrich Hertz ten years before, Lenard
was now able to measure some properties of these photoelectrons with a simple

electrical circuit.
The ejected electrons are produced by illumination of the metal plate called the
emitter and received at another plate called the collector. The total photoelectric
current is measured on the sensitive current-measuring device marked A. The
electrical potential or voltage between emitter and collector can be varied and
has a strong effect on the measured current.
The current decreases sharply when a retarding voltage is applied, making the
collecting electrode negative with respect to the emitting electrode. (Electrons
have negative charge and are repelled by a negative voltage.) At a definite value
of the retarding voltage, marked as Vo in the diagram, the photoelectric current
disappears entirely.
Ejected electrons leave the target plate with a certain kinetic energy and
continuously lose this energy as they travel against the retarding negative
voltage between the emitter and collector plates.
Electrons which are collected and contribute to the measured current must have
had (when initially emitted) at least the energy greater than qVo (q is the charge
THE ELECTRICAL PART OF THIS EXPERIMENT CAN BE VISUALIZED IN SIMPLE PARTICLE TERMS.

of the electron). This is the well-known relationship for the energy of an electron
under the action of a voltage.

A Classical Interpretation
A straightforward interpretation would conclude that the emitted electrons must
acquire their kinetic energy from the light beam shining on the metal surface.
The classical viewpoint would assume that the light waves beat on the metal
surface like ocean waves and the electrons are disturbed like pebbles on a beach.
Clearly, more intense illumination (i.e. brighter) would deliver more energy to
the electrons.

THIS IS NOT WHAT I FOUND. IN 1902, I DISCOVERED THAT THE ELECTRON ENERGIES – AS MEASURED BY THE RETARDING POTENTIALS – WERE ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT
OF THE LIGHT INTENSITY.

Enter Albert Einstein
This time it was not an established, respected university professor who solved
the problem, but a young clerk at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.
In 1905, at the tender age of 26, Einstein published three papers in a single
volume of Annalen der Physik.

Einstein was familiar with the experimental puzzles of the photoelectric
experiment and knew of the work of Planck and his radiation law. Yet his
approach was utterly personal, relying on his own statistical approach to physics
and Boltzmann’s expression for the entropy of a collection of particles.
THESE WERE THE LIGHT QUANTUM PAPER, WHICH CONCERNS US NOW; A SECOND SEMINAL PAPER WHICH PROVED THE EXISTENCE OF ATOMS; AND A THIRD WHICH
INTRODUCED RELATIVITY, SOLVING SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN ELECTRODYNAMICS AND MOTION.

A Small Flat at Kramergasse 49, in Bern
Einstein with his wife mileva (a trained engineer) and young son Hans Albert . . .
MILEVA LIEBCHEN, I WANT TO SHOW YOU MY LATEST CALCULATION. I THINK IT MAY BE QUITE PROFOUND. FIRST OF ALL, YOU REMEMBER THE IMPORTANT LAW OF
BOLTZMANN FOR THE ENTROPY OF A SYSTEM OF PARTICLES IN TERMS OF ITS PROBABILITY, S = k Log W . . .
OH YES, THE EQUATION THAT PLANCK HATED BUT WAS FORCED TO USE ON THE BLACK-BODY PROBLEM.

ALSO, YOU MAY REMEMBER THE RADIATION FORMULA OF WILHEM WIEN, PLANCK’S COLLEAGUE IN BERLIN, WHICH EVERYONE AGREED WAS VALID FOR THE HIGH
FREQUENCY PORTION OF THE BLACK-BODY CURVE.
YES, I DO. IN FACT, DIDN’T PLANCK’S RADIATION FORMULA REDUCE TO WIEN’S FOR HIGH FREQUENCIES?
VERY GOOD, MILEVA.
BUT I DON’T WANT TO USE PLANCK’S THEORETICAL FORMULA.
I WOULD RATHER BASE MY WORK ON WIEN’S EMPIRICAL LAW WHICH WE KNOW FITS THE HIGH FREQUENCY EXPERIMENTS SO WELL. I’M USING A PHENOMENOLOGICAL
METHOD RATHER THAN A STRICTLY THEORETICAL ONE.

I’VE USED THE METHOD OF FLUCTUATIONS WHICH I HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING LATELY TO CALCULATE THE CHANGE IN ENTROPY IF A SYSTEM IS SUDDENLY
COMPRESSED INTO A SMALL SUB-VOLUME OF ITS TOTAL VOLUME.
USING WIEN’S FORMULA IT’S VERY SIMPLE TO CALCULATE THE TOTAL DECREASE IN ENTROPY OF MONOCHROMATIC (I.E. SINGLE FREQUENCY) RADIATION
COMPRESSED INTO A SMALL SUB-VOLUME. NOTICE, LIEBCHEN, THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE ENTROPY DECREASE WHICH ACCOMPANIES A VOLUME CONTRACTION OF
PARTICLES OF AN IDEAL GAS.

BUT MY DEAR MILEVA, I ASSUMED NOTHING ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE PARTICLES OR THE LAWS OF MOTION. I HAVE USED ONLY THE ENTROPY FORMULA, S = k
Log W FROM BOLTZMANN’S FORM OF THE SECOND LAW. THE RESULT FOR THE RADIATION IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE COMPRESSED GAS, SO I CAN EQUATE THE
TWO EXPONENTS AND GET A SIMPLE ANSWER . . .
E = n k B f
SO MY HYPOTHESIS IS THIS . . . WITHIN THE VALIDITY OF THE WIEN LAW (I.E. HIGH FREQUENCY), RADIATION BEHAVES THERMODYNAMICALLY AS IF IT CONSISTS OF
MUTUALLY INDEPENDENT ENERGY QUANTA OF MAGNITUDE k B f. IN OTHER WORDS, LIKE LIGHT PARTICLES.

ONE MORE THING, ALBERT. I NOTICE YOU HAVE THE CONSTANT B FROM THE WIEN LAW IN YOUR ANSWER. BUT DIDN’T PLANCK SHOW THAT B CAN BE WRITTEN AS A
RATIO OF HIS OWN CONSTANT h AND THE BOLTZMANN CONSTANT, k?
YES. BUT I DIDN’T WANT TO INCLUDE ANY CONCLUSIONS OF THE PLANCK RADIATION LAW IN MY PAPER BECAUSE I AM NOT CERTAIN OF ITS RESULTS. I AM
SUGGESTING THE QUANTIZATION OF ALL LIGHT RADIATION.
PLANCK MERELY CONSIDERED OSCILLATORS IN THE CAVITY WALLS.
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ELIMINATE WIEN’S B?
WELL . . . B = h/k SO, E = n h f
IF I DO THAT, I GET AN EQUATION FOR THE ENERGY OF THE RADIATION WHICH IS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF PARTICLES TIMES THE QUANTITY h f, WHICH CLEARLY
INDICATES THAT h f IS THE QUANTUM OF RADIATION.
THIS WOULD MEAN THAT ALL LIGHT AND ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION TRAVELS IN BUNDLES OF ENERGY EQUAL TO h f. IT IS A MUCH MORE GENERAL RULE THAN
ANYTHING PLANCK EVER IMAGINED!

DO YOU THINK THE ANNALEN DER PHYSIK WOULD PUBLISH THIS PAPER? IT’S NOT A DEFINITIVE PROOF OF ANYTHING, BUT I THINK IT CAN BE HELPFUL IN SUGGESTING
FUTURE WORK.
WHY NOT USE THE WORD HEURISTCHEN IN THE TITLE OF YOUR PAPER? IT MEANS NOT A RIGOROUS SOLUTION, BUT SUGGESTIVE OF FURTHER DEVELOPMENT.
THAT WAY YOU CAN PUBLISH THE PAPER AND PRETEND THAT YOU ARE NOT TAKING IT TOTALLY SERIOUSLY BUT OFFERING IT FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION.
GOOD IDEA, LIEBCHEN. I’M SO PLEASED WHEN YOU HELP ME WITH MY WORK. LET’S SEE . . . HOW’S THIS FOR A TITLE?
ON AN HEURISTIC VIEWPOINT CONCERNING THE NATURE OF LIGHT.
SOUNDS GOOD!

Einstein’s Explanation of the Photoelectric Effect
Einstein’s 1905 paper showed that the puzzling features of the photoelectric
effect are easily explained once the illuminating radiation is understood to be a
collection of particles or photons. If the photons can transfer their energy to the
electrons in the target metal, a complete and simple picture is possible. Let’s see
how this works . . .

The simplest way to imagine this is to assume that a light quantum delivers its
entire energy – h f – to the electron which then loses some of this energy by the
time it reaches the surface.
Before being ejected, each electron must perform an amount of work – P –
characteristic of the metal to get out into free space. The electrons leaving the
metal with the largest velocity will be those located near the surface, which will
IF ONE ASSUMES THAT THE INCIDENT LIGHT CONSISTS OF ENERGY QUANTA (PHOTONS) OF MAGNITUDE h f, IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF THE EJECTION OF
ELECTRONS BY LIGHT AS FOLLOWS. ENERGY QUANTA PENETRATE THE SURFACE LAYER OF THE METAL OF THE TARGET ELECTRODE. THEIR ENERGY IS TRANSFERRED,
AT LEAST IN PART, INTO THE KINETIC ENERGY OF THE ELECTRONS AND SOME ARE EJECTED.

have minimum work to get free. The kinetic energy of the electrons is given by .
. .
Einstein thus derived a very simple equation for the photoelectrons which could
be tested in the laboratory. Furthermore, since each interaction leads to the same
KINETIC ENERGY = h f (ENERGY OF THE INCOMING PHOTON) LESS P (WORK TO GET OUT OF THE METAL).
qvo = h f – p, WHERE q DENOTES THE ELECTRON CHARGE.

photon-electron energy transfer, the observation that electron energies do not
respond to changes in light intensity was explained quite simply. The intensity
affects the number of photons and therefore the magnitude of the electron
current, but does not affect the cut-off voltage Vo which is determined by
frequency.
It is clearly a consequence of these arguments and simple equations, that the
maximum retarding potential Vo is a linear function of the frequency of the
incident light. Thus in time-honoured fashion, if the linear (straight-line)
relationship could be tested, it would provide a crucial test of Einstein’s photon
concept. The experiments must measure Vo (the cut-off voltage) for several
different light frequencies and plot a graph to test the linearity.

Millikan: Hard-headed Classical Physicist
During the years 1912–17, Robert A. Millikan (1868–1953), working in the
Ryerson Laboratories at the University of Chicago, submitted the Einstein
equation to this linearity test. He used several different metals, including highly-
reactive sodium, as targets and illuminated them with light of various
frequencies.
His technique was impeccable, even scraping the surface of the metals in
vacuum to avoid oxidized layers which might affect the results. He always
obtained linear results . . . and yet was very disappointed.

Yet Millikan only strengthened Einstein’s explanation by obtaining remarkably
accurate data with near perfect linearity. In fact, it eventually won him a Nobel
REPEATEDLY, THE Vo VERSUS f (FREQUENCY) RELATION WAS DEMONSTRATED TO BE LINER AS REQUIRED BY EINSTEIN. I CAN’T BELIEVE IT!

THEORY OF LIGHT.

Prize.
Such sentiments were typical of physicists in the second decade of the 20th
century. Clearly, the prediction of quantized radiation was not a great triumph
for Planck and Einstein.
In the early 1900s, more sensational discoveries were being made, in
radioactivity by Becquerel and the Curies in France, as well as the miraculous X-
rays demonstrated by Röntgen in Germany. This attracted the attention of
physicists away from the problems of light radiation.
CONTRARY TO ALL MY EXPECTATIONS, I AM COMPELLED TO ASSERT ITS UNAMBIGUOUS EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION IN SPITE OF ITS UNREASONABLENESS.
THE HYPOTHESIS WAS MADE SOLELY BECAUSE IT FURNISHED A READY EXPLANATION OF THE FACT THAT THE ENERGY OF AN EJECTED ELECTRON IS INDEPENDENT OF
THE INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT . . . BUT DEPENDS ON THE FREQUENCY. I UNDERSTAND EVEN EINSTEIN HIMSELF NO LONGER ACCEPTS IT.
IN FACT, DURING THIS PERIOD OUR WORK WAS COMPLETELY IGNORED.

Meanwhile, Planck himself rejected not only Einstein’s, but his own
revolutionary work on light quanta.
However, he was impressed with Einstein’s work in relativity, and wrote to the
Prussian Academy in support of his membership. But he felt it necessary to
apologise for the photons . . .
THOUGH HE MAY SOMETIMES HAVE MISSED THE TARGET IN HIS SPECULATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE IN HIS HYPOTHESIS OF LIGHT QUANTA, THIS CAN’T REALLY BE HELD
AGAINST HIM. FOR IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE FUNDAMENTALLY NEW IDEAS IN THE MOST EXACT SCIENCES WITHOUT OCCASIONALLY TAKING A RISK.

Bright Line Light Spectra
We are now ready for the third experiment which could not be explained by the
classical physicists – Bright Line Light Spectra. Remember the list. . .
Black-Body Radiation (explained by Planck)
The Photoelectric Effect (explained by Einstein)
Bright Line Light Spectra (to be explained by Bohr)
For 150 years, precise observations of light emission from gases had been
accumulating in European physics laboratories. Many believed these held the
secrets of the atom. But how to decipher this vast store of information to create
order from chaos? That was the challenge. Reports began as far back as 1752
when the Scottish physicist, Thomas Melvill, put containers of different gases
over a flame and studied the glowing light emitted.
Melvill made a rather remarkable discovery. He found that the spectrum of light

WITH A PRISM.

from a hot gas when passed through a prism was completely different from the
well known rainbow-like spectrum of a glowing solid.

Emission Spectra
When examined through a narrow slit, the light spectrum from a heated gas
consists of distinct bright lines, each having the colour of the part of the
spectrum in which it was located. Different gases gave different patterns.
The integrating properties of the eye keep us (and other animals) from seeing
REMEMBER IN SCHOOL CHEMISTRY CLASS WHEN YOU PLACED CRYSTALS OF TABLE SALT (SODIUM CHLORIDE) ON A WIRE AND HELD IT IN THE FLAME OF A BUNSEN
BURNER? THE FLAME TURNED A BRIGHT YELLOW.
WHAT HAPPENS IS THIS. THE SALT MELTS IN THE FLAME AND PRODUCES SODIUM GAS VAPOUR WHICH HAS TWO VERY STRONG BRIGHT SPECTRAL LINES IN THE
YELLOW BAND OF THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM.

The integrating properties of the eye keep us (and other animals) from seeing
these lines, combining the separate colours so that we see only the mixture (e.g.
reddish for glowing neon, pale blue for nitrogen, and so on). In the case of
sodium, the eye mixes the two yellow lines and the flame looks like fiery
daffodil petals.
Mercury gas (from vaporized liquid) and nitrogen gas gave sharply defined and
easily recognizable bright line patterns when photographed with a sensitive
device called a spectrometer.
In fact, the spectral patterns of elements are so distinct and the measurements so
exact, that no two are known to have the same set of lines. Spectra could be used
to identify unknown gases, as with the discovery of helium gas in the spectrum
of the sun. But before describing this amazing discovery, a word about dark
lines in light spectra.

Absorption Spectra (Dark Lines)
These three diagrams show how to observe the two different types of spectra.
1) “White light” radiation containing all frequencies is emitted from a hot solid
(like the heated filament in a light bulb) and passes through a slit before entering
the thin end of a triangular prism wedge. A continuous spectrum (rainbow-
like) appears on the screen.
2) The same experimental set-up is used, except a hot gas is used as a source in
place of a hot solid. Now a bright line spectrum appears on the screen and the
shape of each line is the image of the slit.
3) Now, something new. Return to the first case, the hot solid giving off

radiation of all frequencies. The container of gas is interposed between the
source and the slit. But this time, the gas is not heated . . . it is cool.
Now note the screen. A dark line spectrum appears with the missing lines
corresponding exactly to the bright lines of the previous case, when the gas was
hot.
A simple conclusion can be drawn. The cool (unexcited) gas is absorbing light at
precisely the same frequencies at which this same gas emitted light when heated.
There must be certain characteristic energy states in a gas which are reversible,
i.e. can take in or give off energy. Very interesting. . .

Fraunhofer Lines
All this was very puzzling, but at the same time encouraging because in both the
emission and absorption spectra, the frequency (or wavelength) at which these
lines appeared was always the same. Line spectra gave physicists precise
reproducible information about pure elements.
In 1814, Joseph von Fraunhofer (1787–1826) created the first spectroscope,
combining a prism with a small viewing telescope focused on a distant narrow
slit. He subsequently used the instrument to view the sun’s spectrum and saw . . .
. . . AN ALMOST COUNTLESS NUMBER OF LINES WHICH ARE DARKER THAN THE REST OF THE COLOURED IMAGE; SOME APPEARED TO BE ALMOST PERFECTLY BACK.
I HAVE CONVINCED MYSELF THAT THESE LINES ARE DUE TO THE NATURE OF SUNLIGHT AND NOT AN OPTICAL ILLUSION.

These dark lines in the solar spectrum became known as Fraunhofer Lines and
form the basis for astrophysical spectroscopy.

The Discovery of Helium
Gustav Kirchhoff (1824–87) studied these dark lines several years later using
an ingenious method of superimposing the bright yellow lines from a salt (NaCl)
solution onto the Fraunhofer solar spectrum. The exact match demonstrated that
the dark lines were due to the presence of cool vapours of sodium and other
elements in the outer atmosphere surrounding the sun.
IDENTIFYING THE SPECTRAL LINE PATTERNS IN THE SOLAR SPECTRUM INDICATED WHICH ELEMENTS WERE PRESENT IN THE ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDING THE SUN.
WHEN A DISTINCT, PREVIOUSLY UNOBSERVED PATTERN WAS FOUND, A SEARCH WAS BEGUN IN EARTH-BOUND LABORATORIES FOR THIS MYSTERIOUS GAS.

The elusive element – an odourless, colourless and chemically inert gas – was
finally detected and isolated. Appropriately, it was named helium, after the
Greek word (helios) for the sun.

Hydrogen – Test Case for Atomic Structure
Surely these line spectra must be revealing something quite fundamental about
the internal structure of the atom. But what? A closer examination was called
for.
In attempts to relate the characteristic bright lines to some kind of theory of
atomic structure, it is not surprising that physicists chose to examine the spectra
of hydrogen. It is the simplest atom of all the elements.
The four most prominent lines of hydrogen, all in the visible part of the light
spectrum, had been measured accurately as early as 1862 by the Swedish
astronomer, A. J. Ångstrom (1814–74).

I USED SPECTROSCOPIC TECHNIQUES TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF HYDROGEN IN THE SUN AND LATER MADE PRECISE MEASUREMENTS OF THE HYDROGEN SPECTRUM.
THESE VALUES WERE WELL KNOWN AND SUBJECTED TO A SEARCHING ANALYSIS FOR YEARS.

Balmer: the Swiss School Teacher
In 1885, a Swiss school mathematics teacher, Johann Jakob Balmer (1825–
98), published the results of months of work spent manipulating the numerical
values of the frequencies of the lines of the visible hydrogen spectrum.
Miraculously, Balmer had managed to discover a formula involving whole
numbers which predicted almost exactly the frequencies of the four visible
hydrogen lines – and others in the ultraviolet region, later confirmed.
I WAS SIMPLY PROVIDING AN INITIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE RAW DATA. NO REAL PHYSICS WAS INVOLVED, IT WAS PURE, NUMEROLOGY.

Using this equation, Balmer could predict the frequencies of the four hydrogen
lines if nf (final) was chosen to be 2; ni (initial) = 3, 4, 5 and 6 and R was given
the value 3.29163 × 1015 cycles/sec. This gave the best fit to the measurements.
The accuracy was too good to be not true! There must be something
fundamental underlying his equation. Perhaps certain physical laws applied to
the atom might generate an equation of this form.
Meanwhile, Balmer predicted more lines – in the ultraviolet and infrared
frequency range – which could not even be measured at the time. He used
different values for nf and predicted several series of spectra lines.
Balmer’s equation predicted an infinity of lines . . . and was, as you shall see
quite correct! But whether it would lead to a new theory remained to be seen.
LOOK AT THE EXTREMELY CLOSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL FREQUENCIES AND THE FREQUENCIES I COMPUTED USING MY EQUATION.


Hydrogen Frequencies From Balmer’s Formula
Balmer speculated that more hydrogen lines exist with nf taking on values other
than 2. For example, nf = 1 gave a new series in the ultraviolet and nf = 3 and 4
gave other new series in the infrared.
These sequences strongly suggested some kind of energy diagram as the
emission/absorption of light from an atom must correspond to a
decrease/increase in the atom’s energy. The diagram below shows how
Balmer’s formula was used to predict the frequencies of the spectral lines by
starting each sequence with a different number, as in the table.
Hydrogen Frequencies From Balmer’s Formula
This information would be critical to any atomic theory. These changes of whole
numbers, which gave precise frequencies of the emitted radiation, suggested
some rearrangement of the parts of the atom was taking place.
No one had any idea of the make-up of an atom in the 1890s. Yet it seemed clear
that a successful theory of the atom must include the miraculous formula of

that a successful theory of the atom must include the miraculous formula of
Johann Jakob Balmer in some significant way.

Discovery of the Electron
It was in the hallowed halls of the world-famous Cavendish Laboratory of
Cambridge University that the atom began to be dissected by J.J. Thomson
(1856–1940), one of the great classical physicists of the 19th century.
In fact, during the last five years of the 19th century, other so-called rays were
I DEMONSTRATED THAT THE ELECTRON HAD A DISTINCT CHARGE-TO-MASS RATIO AND WAS THUS A PARTICLE, NOT A CATHODE RAY.

shown to behave as particles. Alpha and beta rays became alpha and beta
particles. The next step was to see how these particles might be used to make an
atom.

Christmas Pudding Atom
Thomson and Lord Kelvin developed a model of the atom (probably at
Christmas time) in which the negative electrons were embedded in a uniform
sphere of positive charge, like raisins in a pudding. The usual classical
assumptions were to apply:
Though well-publicized, this scheme was inherently unstable and got nowhere.
Then, about 1907, one of the more imaginative, perhaps even iconoclastic, of the
classical physicists moved to centre stage. Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937), a
former student of Thomson’s at Cambridge, was by this time professor of
physics at the University of Manchester and working in the new research area of
RADIATION FROM THE ATOM SHOULD BE DESCRIBED BY MAXWELL’S ELECTROMAGNETIC THEORY.
THE DYNAMICS IN THE ATOM SHOULD FOLLOW NEWTON’S LAWS OF MOTION.

radioactivity.

Rutherford’s Nuclear Atom
Though at heart an ardent experimentalist, Rutherford was always ready to work
on a theoretical model if based on reliable measurements which he could see and
understand.
He worked closely with his research students, encouraging them regularly by
strolling through the laboratories singing “Onward Christian Soldiers”.
In 1908, while continuing a programme of research on the radioactive alpha
particles, Rutherford got the idea that these massive, positively-charged

projectiles might be the ideal probes to study the structure of the atom. With one
of his students from Germany, Hans Geiger (1882–1945), Rutherford began to
study alpha-scattering by a thin gold foil, observing through a microscope the
tiny flashes produced as individual alpha particles struck a fluorescent screen.
RUTHERFORD, MOST OF THE SCATTERING IS SMALL, ONLY ABOUT ONE DEGREE. YET THE NUMBER OF PARTICLES SCATTERED THROUGH ANGLES OF TEN DEGREES OR
MORE IS MUCH GREATER THAN PREDICTED BY THE THOMSON MODEL.
HMM . . . THE THOMSON ATOM SHOULD HAVE ACTED ONLY SLIGHTLY ON THE PROJECTILE – RATHER LIKE A CLOUD IN WHICH FINE DUST IS SUSPENDED.
DON’T YOU THINK YOUNG MARSDEN, WHOM I AM TRAINING IN RADIOACTIVE METHODS, OUGHT TO BEGIN A SMALL RESEARCH?
WHY NOT LET HIM SEE IF ANY ALPHA PARTICLES ARE SCATTERED THROUGH A LARGER ANGLE? I HONESTLY DON’T THINK THEY WOULD BE, BUT IT’S WORTH A
GAMBLE. BESIDES, MARSDEN WILL LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT OUR SCATTERING TECHNIQUES.

These experiments and Rutherford’s interpretation mark the beginning of the
modern concept of the nuclear model of the atom.
MARSDEN HAS OBSERVED SOME OF THE ALPHA PARTICLES COMING BACKWARD!
THIS IS QUITE THE MOST INCREDIBLE EVENT THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME IN MY LIFE! IT WAS ALMOST AS IF YOU FIRED A 15 INCH SHELL AT A PIECE OF TISSUE
PAPER AND IT CAME BACK AND HIT YOU!
THIS BACKWARDS SCATTERING MUST BE THE RESULT OF A SINGLE COLLISIN . . . BUT THIS CALCULATION SHOWS THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ANYTHING OF THAT
MAGNITUDE UNLESS THE GREATEST PART OF THE MASS OF THE ATOM IS CONCENTRATED IN A TINY NUCLEUS.
THE ATOM MUST HAVE AN INCREDIBLY SMALL BUT MASSIVE CENTRE, CARRYING A POSITIVE CHARGE.

Size of the Nucleus
As a secondary result of these scattering experiments, the size of the nucleus
could be estimated. If an alpha particle moves directly towards a nucleus, its
kinetic energy on approach is transformed to electrical potential energy until it
slows down and eventually stops. The distance of closest approach can then be
computed from the conservation of energy.

Thus, most alpha particles or other projectiles like atoms, electrons or neutrons,
can penetrate thousands of layers of atoms in metal foils or in gases with only an
occasional large deflection backward. That is why Geiger and Marsden had to be
very patient (like most good scientists) to make the back-scattering discovery in
Manchester.
Successful as this model of the nuclear atom was in explaining scattering
phenomena, it raised many new questions.
THE ATOM IS MOSTLY EMPTY, WITH THE NUCLEUS OCCUPYING ABOUT ONLY ONE BILLIONTH OF THE SPACE!

WHAT IS THE ARRANGEMENT OF ELECTRONS ABOUT THE NUCLEUS?
WHAT IS THE NUCLEUS COMPOSED OF AND WHAT KEEPS IT FROM EXPLODING DUE TO REPULSION OF ITS POSITIVE CHARGES?
WHAT KEEPS THE NEGATIVE ELECTRON FROM FALLING INTO A POSITIVE NUCLEUS BY ELECTRICAL ATTRACTION?
I ANSWERED THESE QUESTIONS BY PROPOSING A PLANETARY MODEL FOR THE ATOM, WITH ELECTRONS CIRCLING THE MINIATURE NUCLEUS. THE ELECTRICAL
ATTRACTION WOULD THEN PROVIDE THE CENTRIPETAL FORCE TO KEEP THE ELECTRON MOING IN AN ORBIT.
IF THE ELECTRONS ARE LIKE A MICROSCOPIC SOLAR SYSTEM, MOVING IN CIRCULAR ORBITS ABOUT THE NUCLEUS (AND THUS ACCELERATING) WHAT KEEPS THEM
FROM RADIATING CONTINUOUSLY AS THE CLASSICAL ELECTROMAGNETIC THEORY WOULD PREDICT?
THEY WOULD LOSE ALL THEIR ENERGY IN A FRACTION OF A SECOND.

At least the visualization of the atom had begun. The next step also took place in
Rutherford’s group at Manchester, with the arrival of a young Danish student,
recently transferred from Cambridge . . .
ONE SHOULD NOT EXPECT A MODEL – MADE ON THE BASIS OF ONE SET OF PUZZLING RESULTS WHICH IT HANDLED WELL – ALSO TO HANDLE ALL OTHER PUZZLES.
ADDITIONAL ASSUMPTIONS WOULD BE NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE PICTURE, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE DETAILS OF ATOMIC STRUCTURE.

Arrival of the Quantum Hero, Niels Bohr
At Rutherford’s Manchester laboratory in 1912, the “Great Dane” began his
relentless search for the deepest understanding of quantum physics, which
continued for 50 years to his death in 1962.
In this great endeavour, there is no one to compare with Bohr, not even Einstein.
He is the grandfather of quantum physics, proposing the first ideas and working
with just about everyone who made contributions to the theory’s development.

He arrived in England in 1911 with a large dictionary and the complete works of
Charles Dickens from which to study English. In spite of his language
limitations, Bohr had great self-confidence and an unbelievable capacity for hard
work.
Then Bohr met Rutherford at a Cavendish dinner and was very impressed with
the enthusiasm and praise Rutherford had expressed for the work of someone
else.
I STARTED AT THE CAVENDISH UNDER v.v. THOMSON BUT DID NOT GET ON WITH THE GREAT MAN.
ESPECIALLY AFTER HE TOLD ME HOW DISAPPOINTED HE WAS IN MY PUDDING MODEL OF THE ATOM.

When Bohr arrived at Manchester, the place was buzzing with the application of
Rutherford’s new planetary atom. He was not intimidated by the restrictions on
Rutherford’s model and felt intuitively that classical mechanics did not apply
inside the atom anyway. He knew that the work of Planck and Einstein on light
radiation was very important, not just a clever German idea.
THIS WAS NOT A COMMON EXPERIENCE IN ACADEMIC CIRCLES. I IMMEDIATELY ASKED HIM IF I MIGHT JOIN THE MANCHESTER GROUP TO GET SOME EXPERIENCE.
I ACCEPTED HIM IMMEDIATELY. I LIKED THE IDEA THAT BOHR WAS A FOOTBALL PLAYER.

Bohr’s great breakthrough came when he discovered Balmer’s formula in early
1913. He had not even thought of light spectra until then.
IF THE HYDROGEN ATOM CONSISTED OF AN ELECTRON AND A PROTON, IT WAS LOGICAL TO ASSUME, LIKE RUTHERFORD, THAT THE ELECTRON WAS REVOLVING
AROUND THE NUCLEUS AS IN A LITTLE SOLAR SYSTEM.
BUT HOW COULD IT EXIST? ACCORDING TO CLASSICAL LAWS, AN ELECTRON COULD NOT LAST LONGER THAN A FRACTION OF A SECOND IN THAT CONFIGURATION.
THE REVOLVING ELECTRON WOULD RADIATE AWAY ITS ENERGY AND COLLAPSE INTO THE NUCLEUS.
PERHAPS THERE ARE SPECIAL STABLE ORBITS WHICH HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE PLANCK / EINSTEIN QUANTUM RELATION BETWEEN THE ENERGY OF A LIGHT
PHOTON AND ITS FREQUENCY, E = h f.

That event marks the beginning of the quantum theory of atomic structure.
WHEN I HEARD OF THE BALMER FORMULA, I IMMEDIATELY PROCEEDED TO COMPLETE THE FIRST OF THREE PAPERS CONTAINING THE INTERPRETATION OF BALMER’S
FORMULA IN TERMS OF MY NEW MODEL FOR THE HYDROGEN ATOM.

Bohr Meets Nicholson: Quantized Angular
Momentum
IN 1912, SOMEONE I KNEW AT CAMBRIDGE, V.W. NICHOLSON, PUBLISHED A PAPER WITH AN IMPORTANT IDEA ON THE VALUE OF THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM OF AN
ELECTRON IN AN ATOM.
IF PLANCK’S CONSTANT h HAS AN ATOMIC SIGNIFICANCE, IT MAY MEAN THAT THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM OF A PARTICLE CAN ONLY RISE OR FALL BY DISCRETE
AMOUNTS WHEN ELECTRONS LEAVE OR RETURN.

J.W. Nicholson (1881–1955) had quantized angular momentum, proceeding to
calculate the correct value L = mvR = n (h/2π) for hydrogen.
Bohr did not seem to need Nicholson’s idea to continue his work at that moment.
But it proved important, so we should take a careful look at angular momentum.

First: Linear Momentum
In our everyday language we use the term momentum to refer to something that
is difficult to stop once it is moving. In physics, the meaning is the same. In a
linear or straight line system with no friction, a body set in motion will
continue in motion unless acted on by an outside force. This is called the
principle of conservation of momentum and was known to Galileo even before
Newton was born.

THE NUMERICAL VALUE OF THE LINEAR MOMENTUM IS DEFINED SIMPLY AS THE PRODUCT OF THE MASS OF THE BODY AND ITS SPEED: p = m v (LINEAR MOMENTUM)

Second: Angular Momentum
In a rotating system the physics is similar. If a body is set in rotational motion in
a closed orbit without friction, it will continue undiminished with constant
angular momentum until acted on by an external torque. The magnitude is
simply given by the product of the body’s mass, its speed and the radius of the
orbit. . .

L = m v r (angular momentum)
where m is the mass and v the speed around the orbit.
In Bohr’s model, if an electron is excited from its initial energy state, it can only
“jump” to an orbit where its angular momentum will change – increase or

decrease – by some whole number times h/2π.
THIS IS THE CENTRAL PREMISE OF MY SCHEME . . . THE QUANTIZATION OF THE ELECTRON ORBITS IN THE ATOM IN UNITS OF PLANCK’S CONSTANT.

The Bohr Quantum Postulates
Bohr introduced two new postulates to account for the existence of stable
electron orbits. In the first, he justified the use of the nuclear atom in defiance of
classical objections.
This is the quantum orbital condition.
AN ATOM CAN EXIST IN ANY ONE OF SEVERAL SPECIAL ORBITS WITH NO EMISSION OF RADIATION, CONTRARY TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF CLASSICAL PHYSICS.
THESE ORBITS ARE CALLED STATIONARY STATES AND ARE CHARACTERIZED BY VALUES OF ORBITAL ANGULAR MOMENTUM GIVEN BY . . .
L = m v r = n (h/2π)

The angular momentum L cannot take on any arbitrary value, as is the usual
case in classical physics, but only certain values. L = 1 (h/2π) in the first orbit; L
= 2 (h/2π) in the second orbit; L = 3 (h/2π) in the third . . . and so on. Only
orbits in which L is a whole multiple of the quantized unit h/2π are allowed.
(This integer n is called the principal quantum number.)

What’s the fundamental quantum unit, h or h/2π?
First we saw that light can only exist as finely-divided units of energy E = h f
(frequency). Now we find the angular momentum is also quantized, but this time
in units of h/2π. So what is the difference? Where does the factor 2π come from?
Why is angular momentum quantized differently from energy? An intriguing
question, to be answered soon!

Mixing Classical and Quantum Physics
If the angular momentum of an orbiting body is known – in this case postulated
– it is a simple matter to compute the radius and the energy of the orbit using
classical ideas. Bohr based his derivation on Newton’s planetary model of the
solar system to obtain a formula for the radii of the electron orbits . . .

The size of the orbit thus depends only on the whole number n (which also
quantizes the angular momentum) since all the other terms in the equation are
physical constants.
The smallest radius is for n = 1, when its value is 5.3 × 10–9m or 5.3 nanometres.
This value is close to modern estimates of the size of the atom based on actual
measurements. At this value, called the Bohr radius, the energy of the hydrogen
atom is a minimum and the atom is in its ground state.
Bohr’s Second Postulate
Continuing his analogy of the atom as a mini solar system, Bohr could easily
calculate the energy of each orbit once the radius was known. He could then use
the energy difference between stationary states to determine the frequencies of
the emission and absorption of light. This led to his second postulate. . .
THIS IS MY FORMULA FOR THE RADII OF THE STABLE ORBITS OF THE ELECTRON IN THE HYDROGEN ATOM.

A SUDDEN TRANSITION OF THE ELECTRON BETWEEN TWO STATIONARY STATES WILL PRODUCE AN EMISSION OR ABSORPTION OF RADIATION, WITH A FREQUENCY
GIVEN BY THE PLANCK / EINSTEIN RELATION . . .
h f = E1 – Ef
Ei AND Ef ARE THE ENERGIES OF THE ATOM IN THE INITIAL AND FINAL STATIONARY STATES.

Bohr Derives the Balmer Formula
From these postulates, Bohr set out to derive Balmer’s formula (already known
to give the correct values for the line spectra of hydrogen) using his new atomic
model. He mixed classical and quantum physics together to obtain. . .
This was exactly the same formula Balmer had obtained for the frequencies of
hydrogen, if the constant term R in Balmer’s equation (called the Rydberg
constant) could be shown to be equal to: R = (27π2mq4/h3).
Using values for q, m and h available in 1914, Bohr calculated: R = 3.26 × 1015
cycles/sec, within a few percent of Balmer’s value.
Bohr had derived the Balmer formula (which was known to give all the correct
hydrogen spectra) from a physical theory based on electrons orbiting the
nucleus. A remarkable result.
Bohr could now draw an energy diagram based on physical orbits in the atom to
show how the various spectral series originate. Had the young Dane solved the
riddle of atomic structure? Would his model work – i.e. predict the spectra – for
all the other elements?


A Closer Look at Spectra . . . and More Lines
Soon extra spectral lines appeared, even in simple hydrogen, and Bohr’s model
was being challenged. As more careful measurements of the hydrogen spectra
became available, it was obvious that more structure in the atom was necessary.
There seemed to be more possible states for the electron than Bohr’s simple
circular orbits – with only one quantum number – would allow. But a renowned
theorist came to the rescue.
Arnold Sommerfeld
(1868–1951), the great theoretician and teacher in Munich.

Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) had done the same to explain the deviations
from circularity in the motion of the planet Mars in the light of Tycho Brahe’s
accurate measurements.
I EXTENDED BOHR’S IDEAS TO THE CASE OF ELLIPTICAL ORBITS AND EXPLAINED THESE EFFECTS.

AFTER ALL, THE MOST GENERAL ASPECT OF ORBITAL MOTION IS ELLIPTICAL AND THE CIRCLE IS A SPECIAL CASE.

Another Quantum Number Added, k
In spite of the outbreak of the so-called Great War, papers were transmitted
secretly from Munich to Copenhagen in which Sommerfeld described elliptical
orbits of different shape with the same values of n.
Again, only certain values of the shapes of the orbit were allowed. Another
quantum number was introduced, k . . . also quantized in units of h/2π.

THIS RESULTED IN DIFFERENT VALUES OF ENERGY IN THE STATIONARY STATES WITH SLIGHTLY LARGER OR SMALLER ENERGY TRANSITIONS . . . AND THE RESULTING
MULTIPLE SPECTRAL LINES.

The Zeeman Effect . . . and Still More Lines
As early as the 1890s, the Dutchman Pieter Zeeman (1865–1943) had shown
that extraneous spectral lines appeared when the excited atoms were placed in a
magnetic field. A true atomic theory would have to explain this phenomenon,
which became known as the Zeeman effect. Sommerfeld had an answer.

In February 1916, Einstein wrote to Sommerfeld that he considered the new
results “a revelation”. A month later Bohr added, “I do not believe ever to have
read anything with more joy than your beautiful work”.
THE DIRECTION OR ORIENTATION OF THE ORBIT IS IMPORTANT. WHEN A FIELD IS APPLIED, THE EXCITED ELECTRON CAN SELECT FROM MORE ORBITS POINTING IN
VARIOUS DIRECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE FIELD, ALLOWING DIFFERENT ENERGIES.

Three Quantum Numbers, n, k, m
With Sommerfeld’s calculations to back him up, Bohr worked out a series of
selection rules for atomic transitions on the basis of three quantum numbers . . .
the size of the orbit (n), the shape of the orbit (k), and the direction in which the
orbit is pointing (m).
Each separate energy state could now be assigned a distinct set of these integral
numbers, n, k, and m, and transitions between these states would produce the
observed spectral lines.

Was the Bohr-Sommerfeld scheme now enough to explain all the lines observed
in the hydrogen spectra? Well no, not quite. Something was still missing. Yet
another quantum number was needed to explain fully the magnetic effects.
OH NO! WILL THIS NEVER CEASE?

Wolfgang Pauli: the Anomalous Zeeman Effect,
Electron Spin and the Exclusion Principle
The explanation of the magnetic splitting of the spectral lines, reported by
Zeeman in 1894, was one of the big successes of the Bohr-Sommerfeld orbits.
But later magnetic results produced more lines, and the physicists were stumped.
They called this the Anomalous Zeeman Effect (AZE).

In 1924–5, everyone was mystified by the AZE, not the least of whom was the
Swiss theoretician Wolfgang Pauli (1900–58). In fact, it bothered him so much
that it inspired one of many stories people tell about him, most of which are
probably true.
Pauli had accepted an invitation to work with Bohr in Copenhagen and wrote
two papers on the AZE, neither of which satisfied him. During this stay in 1922
and 1923, he was often depressed and agitated by his lack of progress with this
problem. One day, a colleague met Pauli strolling aimlessly in the beautiful
streets of Copenhagen . . .
BUT IT WASN’T ANOMALOUS AT ALL. THEY JUST COULDN’T UNDERSTAND IT.

Pauli began his schooling in his native Vienna, where as a teenager he was
already advanced in mathematics and physics. In 1918 he enrolled in the
University of Munich and with the encouragement of his professor, Sommerfeld,
he published a review article on general relativity which became legendary when
Einstein wrote: Whoever studies this mature and grandly conceived work might
not believe its author is only 21 years old.
YOU LOOK VERY UNHAPPY, PAULI. WHAT’S WRONG?
HOW CAN ONE AVOID DESPONDENCY WHEN ONE IS THINKING ABOUT THE ANOMALOUS ZEEMAN EFFECT?

The Pauli Effect
Pauli did his Ph.D thesis under Sommerfeld in 1921 on the quantum theory of
ionized hydrogen. He went for half a year as assistant to Born in Göttingen and
then to Hamburg as a privatdozent. From that period date the first occurrences of
the Pauli effect (not to be confused with the Pauli principle) . . .
Whenever he entered a laboratory, something would go badly wrong with
the experimental apparatus! (Pauli effect.)
It was an accepted fact that theorists were hopeless with experiments. But Pauli
was such an exceptional theorist that just his presence alone would cause

equipment to fall apart. He would relate with hilarity how his friend at Hamburg,
the well-respected experimentalist Otto Stern (1888–1969), would consult him
only through the closed door leading to his laboratory.
The Anomalous Zeeman Effect – which had bothered Pauli so much in
Copenhagen – eventually led to Pauli’s being immortalized as one of the major
contributors to quantum theory.

Pauli’s “Hidden Rotation” and the Spinning Electron
Pauli made a hypothesis that a hidden rotation produces the extra angular
momentum responsible for the AZE. He proposed a fourth quantum number
with two values, just what was needed to explain the perplexing AZE.
Meanwhile, two young Dutch physicists, George Uhlenbeck and Sam
Goudsmit, had the same idea. Their professor, Paul Ehrenfest, was more
sympathetic and sent their paper for publication.
BUT I HAVE NO PHYSICAL PICTURE OF THIS HIDDEN ROTATION PROCESS.
COULD IT BE THAT THE ELECTRON IS SPINNING . . . LIKE THE EARTH ON ITS AXIS AS IT GOES ROUND THE SUN?
THAT IS INDEED VERY CLEVER, BUT OF COURSE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY.

It was soon shown that the mysterious results of the AZE were due to the
electron’s spinning, which gave it extra angular momentum.
There was one troublesome aspect of the spin discovery which needs to be
mentioned, since it leads so inevitably to the new quantum theory to follow a
year later. The angular momentum of the spinning electron turned out to be only
one-half of the normal value h/2π of atomic orbits, so-called spin 1/2.
THE SURPLUS LINE-SPLITTING IS NOT DUE TO ANY ADDITIONAL QUANTUM NUMBER FOR THE ELECTRON IN ITS ORBIT . . .
BUT BECAUSE THE ELECTRON ITSELF IS SPINNING.
AND SO, THEY WON A NOBEL PRIZE!
AS THERE ARE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS OF ROTATION – EITHER CLOCKWISE (SPIN UP) OR ANTI-CLOCKWISE (SPIN DOWN) . . .
THIS WAS JUST THE “TWO-VALUENESS” WHICH I HAD GUESSED, THE FINAL CLUE TO MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRUCTURE OF ATOMS.

This is another example of a semi-classical concept which didn’t quite work (e.g.
the electron would have to spin around twice to get back to its starting point!).

Pauli’s Exclusion Principle
The initial puzzle of atomic structure had been why all the electrons do not
simply fall into the ground state. To explain why this doesn’t happen, Pauli had
proposed that each atomic state (a set of three quantum numbers) contained two
electrons and needed its own exclusive orbit. This was given the fancy title of
space quantization.
Now with the double-valued spin concept, Pauli was able to make the final
pronouncement on his exclusion principle . . .

Unlike his earlier hypothesis restricted to the outer (or valence) electrons to
explain the AZE, Pauli now proposed that this principle applied to all electrons
and all atoms. With this simple yet profound principle, the quantum states for
any atom could now be constructed and the form of the periodic table of the
elements could be understood from first principles.
The Periodic Table: Mendeléev
The periodicity of the elements had been known since the 1890s when the
Russian Dimitri Mendeléev (1834–1907) invented a visual aid for students
struggling with organic chemistry.
EACH QUANTUM STATE IN THE ATOM IS NOT LIMITED TO TWO ELECTRONS BUT ONLY ONE ELECTRON. THERE ARE THUS FOUR QUANTUM NUMBERS, COUNTING SPIN UP
OR DOWN, FOR EACH DISTINCT ENERGY LEVEL.
IF A STATE IS OCCUPIED, THE NEXT ELECTRON MUST GO TO AN EMPTY HIGHER ENERGY STATE, FILLING UP THE EMPTY STATES FROM THE LOWEST ENERGY TO HIGHER
ENERGY. THIS IS WHAT KEEPS THE ATOM FROM ALWAYS COLLAPSING TO ITS LOWEST OR GROUND STATE AND GIVES EACH ELEMENT ITS CHARACTERISTIC
STRUCTURE.
THE FACT THE ELECTRONS CANNOT ALL GET ON TOP OF EACH OTHER MAKES TABLES AND EVERYTHING ELSE SOLID.
I HAD REALIZED THAT THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE ELEMENTS WERE REPEATED IF ARRAYED IN A TABLE OF ROWS AND COLUMNS ACCORDING TO INCREASING
ATOMIC NUMBER.

This periodicity remained a mystery until Pauli’s exclusion principle in 1925
gave a truly fundamental explanation. However, Niels Bohr explained it before
Pauli’s discovery, using his orbital model of the atom.
Bohr’s Explanation of the Periodic Table
The periodic table, rather than the explanation of Balmer’s spectra, was Bohr’s
main concern when he began his atomic studies in 1913. He did it with great
physical intuition and the details of his orbital model.
I SUGGESTED THAT THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF AN ELEMENT DEPEND ON HOW THE ELECTRONS ARE ARRANGED AROUND THE NUCLEUS.
I PICTURED THE ELECTRONS AS GROUPED TOGETHER IN LAYERS OR SHELLS.

Each shell can contain no more than a certain number of electrons and the
chemical properties are related to how nearly full or empty a shell is. For
example, full shells are associated with chemical stability. So the electron shells
in the inert gases (helium, neon, argon, etc) are assumed to be completely filled.
Bohr began with the observation that the element hydrogen (with 1 electron) and
lithium (with 3 electrons) are somewhat alike chemically. Both have valence of
one and both enter into compounds of similar types, for example hydrogen
chloride, HCl, and lithium chloride, LiCl.
GIVEN THIS SIMILARITY, I SPECULATED THAT 2 OF THE 3 ELECTRONS OF THE LITHIUM ATOM ARE RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THE NUCLEUS, BUT THE THIRD ELECTRON IS IN
AN ORBIT OUTSIDE THE INER SYSTEM.

Thus, the lithium atom may be crudely pictured as being like a hydrogen atom.
This similar physical structure, then, is the reason for the similar chemical
behaviour. So, the first shell has 2 electrons and the third electron goes into the
next, or outer, shell.

Closed Shells and Inert Gases
Sodium (with 11 electrons) is the next element in the periodic table that has
chemical properties similar to those of hydrogen and lithium. This similarity
suggests that the sodium atom also is hydrogen-like in having a central core
about which one electron revolves. For sodium, then, the eleventh electron must
be in an outer shell, so the second shell has 8 electrons.
THE SAME ARGUMENT WORKS FOR POTASSIUM (WITH 19 ELECTRONS), AGAIN IMAGINING AN INNER CORE OF 18 ELECTRONS AND A SINGLE ELECTRON OUTSIDE IT.
THERE ARE THUS 2,10, AND 18 ELECTRONS OCCUPYING THE INNER CLOSED SHELLS RESPECTIVELY, CORRESPONDING TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE INERT GASES, HELIUM,
NEON AND ARGON.
SINCE THESE GASES HAVE COMPLETE SHELLS, THEY ARE CHEMICALLY STABLE AND CONSEQUENTLY NON-REACTIVE OR INERT.

These qualitative ideas led Bohr to a consistent picture of electrons arranged in
groups, or shells, around the nucleus. Hydrogen, lithium, sodium and potassium
each have a single electron around a core which is very much like the preceding
element, an inert gas. This outlying electron is expected to be easily involved
with nearby atoms, and this agrees with the facts.
Bohr carried through a complete analysis along these lines and in 1921 proposed
the form of the periodic table shown below. Bohr’s table is still useful today, an
example of a physical theory providing a plausible basis for understanding
chemistry.
But it was Pauli who gave the fundamental underpinning for Bohr’s “physical”
periodic chart. His Exclusion Principle (that each and every electron must have
its own set of quantum numbers) automatically produces the magic numbers 2,
8, 18, etc., which Bohr devised for his shells. This is the first indication of the
fact that each electron in an atom “knows the address” of every other electron
and takes its unique space in the atom’s structure. (More on this connectedness
later.)
The table below shows how the Exclusion Principle generates the magic
numbers (i.e. how many electrons are in each orbit or shell). The range of
values for quantum numbers k and m can be inferred from the diagrams on
here–here. The 4th quantum number – determined from the AZE – is s, the
electron spin, which can have only values up or down. In the table, Bohr’s shells
correspond to orbits designated by the principle quantum number n.


The Wave/Particle Duality
Before embarking on a radically new way of viewing electrons in atoms, it is
important to understand the properties of waves and to consider the physicist’s
most perplexing paradox.
Is the fundamental nature of radiation and matter described better by a wave
or a particle representation? Or do we need both?
For the origins of the wave/particle controversy, we must go back to the days
when Isaac Newton and the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens (1629–95)
argued about the nature of light.

So, who is right? And what are the arguments for a wave theory of light?
I AM CERTAIN THAT LIGHT CONSISTS OF PARTICLES, OR AS I CALL THEM, CORPUSCLES.
I SAY LIGHT CONSISTS OF WAVES, AND I PROPOSE A SIMPLE GEOMETRICAL CONSTRUCTION WHICH GIVES THE CORRECT RESULT FOR REFLECTION, REFRACTION,
DIFFRACTION AND INTERFERENCE.

Properties of Waves
Think of a pulse transmitted along a stretched, flexible string. This is the
simplest kind of wave motion.
Now consider pulses generated at each end of the string, travelling toward each
other. What happens when they overlap demonstrates an important property
unique to waves, called superposition (which does not occur for particles).
Superposition
If two pulses on a string travel past a particular point at the same time, the total

displacement of the string is the sum of the individual displacements.
Note that if the pulses have the same size and shape but opposite polarity, they
cancel completely at the common point (the energy goes into the motion of the
string) and pass right through each other.
Periodic Waves
Periodic waves occur if one pulse follows another in regular succession. Sound
waves, water waves and light waves are all periodic.

Wave Speed
The speed (v), wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) of a wave are related in a simple
way: v = fλ. This is obvious from the fact that frequency is the number of waves
per second and λ is the length of the wave.
Interference: the Double-Slit Experiment
Consider the classic double-slit experiment. If two identical periodic waves
arrive at the same point out of phase, i.e. separated by exactly one-half
wavelength, then destructive interference takes place and the waves cancel out
(e.g. for light, a dark spot occurs). If the separation is exactly one whole
wavelength, constructive interference takes place and a bright spot appears
(i.e. for light).
The double-slit experiment was first reported by Thomas Young (1773–1829)
in 1801. His demonstration of interference by alternate bright and dark lines was
taken to be clear evidence for the wave nature of light. See for yourself in
Young’s original sketch reproduced here.


Diffraction and Interference
Diffraction, the bending of waves around an edge, can also cause interference
patterns. When a point source of light (or any other kind of wave) passes through
a small circular hole of a similar size to the wavelength, diffraction from the
edges of the opening spreads the light into a large disk and interference occurs.
The pattern is shown in the photograph. Although the wave paths are more
complicated than the double-slit experiment, the principles are the same. We
shall see this pattern again, the unambiguous evidence for waves.

p

In addition to these interference effects, further evidence for the wave nature of
light was demonstrated by Maxwell’s electromagnetic wave theory of 1865. The
19th century classical physicists were satisfied. Light consisted of waves.

Einstein . . . a Lone Voice
But as the 20th century unfolded, the young Einstein reintroduced the idea of
corpuscles to explain the photoelectric effect (see here). A few years later, in
1909, he applied his powerful new method of statistical fluctuations to Planck’s
black-body law and showed that two distinct terms appeared, indicating a duality
. . .
. . . IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE NEXT PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS WILL BRING US A THEORY OF LIGHT THAT CAN BE INTERPRETED AS A KIND
OF FUSION OF THE WAVE AND PARTICLE THEORIES.

Einstein was alone in his concern over this problem. No one believed in photons.
Not for the first time, he was ahead of his contemporaries in dealing with some
of the ambiguity of quantum theory, at least for light radiation.
But even he wasn’t ready for the shock that came from Paris in 1924.
Fortunately, he was contacted immediately. His opinion was urgently needed!

A French Prince Discovers Matter Waves
In 1923, a graduate student at the Sorbonne in Paris, Prince Louis de Broglie
(1892–1987) introduced the astounding idea that particles may exhibit wave
properties. De Broglie had been greatly influenced by Einstein’s arguments that
a duality may be necessary in understanding light.
In his doctoral thesis of 1924, de Broglie wrote . . .
IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE BASIC IDEA OF THE QUANTUM THEORY IS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF IMAGINING AN ISOLATED QUANTITY OF ENERGY WITHOUT ASSOCIATING IT
WITH A CERTAN FREQUENCY . . .
HOWEVER, IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND PRECISELY THE PHYSICAL SENSE OF THE FREQUENCY IN THE EINSTEIN EQUATION . . .
E
(h) (f)

He was deeply impressed by Einstein’s particles of light which could cause the
photoelectric effect (knock electrons out of a metal) while managing to carry this
“periodic” information to produce interference effects in a different context, like
the double-slit experiment.
Then came the blockbuster. In the first part of his thesis, de Broglie proposed
one of the great unifying principles in all of physics . . .
E = (h) (f)
ENERGY EQUALS PLANCK’S CONSTANT TIMES FREQUENCY
BUT IT APPARENTLY DESCRIBES A CERTAIN INTERNAL “CYCLIC PROCESS”.

I AM CONVINCED THAT THE WAVE/PARTICLE DUALITY DISCOVERED BY EINSTEIN IN HIS THEORY OF LIGHT QUANTA IS ABSOLUTELY GENERAL AND EXTENDS TO ALL
THE PHYSICAL WORLD.
IT SEEMS CERTAIN TO ME THAT THE PROPAGATION OF A WAVE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MOTION OF A PARTICLE OF ANY SORT . . . PHOTON, ELECTRON, PROTON OR
ANY OTHER.

An Associated Wave
What de Broglie did was to assign a frequency, not directly to the internal
periodic behaviour of the particle (as he imagined the Einstein photon), but to a
wave which accompanied the particle through space and time, in such a way
that it was always in phase with the “internal” process.

Could such waves ever be detected? That is, could these mysterious waves
possibly relate to the actual motion of the particle and be measured?
Yes, said de Broglie, these waves are not just abstractions. The physically
important result of the new radical ideas is that there are two velocities
associated with the pilot waves.
THESE WAVES I CALL “PILOT” WAVES WHICH GUIDE THE PARTICLE IN ITS MOTION.

De Broglie identified the group velocity with the velocity of a particle and
showed that the reinforcement region displays all the mechanical properties –
such as energy and momentum – normally associated with a particle. (This is
similar to the way a pulse is produced by a superposition of many waves of
different frequencies.)
ONE IS THE PHASE VELOCITY – THE SPEED AT WHICH A WAVE CREST MOVES – AND THE SECOND IS A GROUP VELOCITY – THE SPEED OF THE REINFORCEMENT REGIONS
FORMED WHEN MANY WAVES ARE SUPERIMPOSED.

Dramatic Conclusions
There were more dramatic conclusions to come when he wrote down the simple
mathematical relationships describing these ideas which were based on an
analogy with photons.

THIS MEANS THAT IF THE WAVELENGTH OF LIGHT IS DECREASED, THE MOMENTUM OF THE INDIVIDUAL LIGHT PHOTONS IS INCREASED.
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT RESULT AND WILL BE USED TO SHOW HOW HEISENBERG EXPLAINED HIS UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE, SO GET IT STRAIGHT HERE. IT’S
FORMALISM IS SIMPLE, ITS CONCEPT, PROFOUND.

To most physicists the concept seemed preposterous. The electron was a
PARTICLE, known by classical physicists since J.J. Thomson’s discovery in
1897!

An Astounding Thesis
These ideas astounded and confounded the examining committee at the
University of Paris in 1924 when de Broglie presented his thesis entitled
Researches on the Quantum Theory. The committee included the eminent
physicist Paul Langevin (1872–1946) who fortunately had secured an advance
copy from de Broglie which he had forwarded to Einstein.
Einstein read the thesis and informed Henrik Lorentz . . .

I BELIEVE DEBROGLIE’S HYPOTHESIS IS THE FIRST FEEBLE RAY OF LIGHT ON THIS WORST OF OUR PHYSICS ENIGMAS.
. . . DE BROGLIE HAS LIFTED THE GREAT VEIL.

Confirmation of Matter Waves
In just a few years, all of de Broglie’s predictions were confirmed by
experiment. Remarkably, in defending his thesis against one sceptical member of
the examining committee, de Broglie had actually suggested.
In a strange ironic twist, such diffraction patterns were first demonstrated by
G.P. Thomson (1892–1975) – proving the wave property of electrons.
MATTER WAVES MIGHT BE OBSERVABLE IN CRYSTAL DIFFRACTION EXPERIMENTS LIKE THOSE CARRIED OUT WITH X-RAYS.

De Broglie had yet another interesting idea about electron waves in atoms . . . as
we can see next.
THIS WAS ABOUT 30 YEARS AFTER MY FATHER v.v. THOMSON FIRST DEMONSTRATED THE PARTICLE PROPERTY OF ELECTRONS.

Electron Waves in Atoms
This is just what Bohr needed in 1913 for his hydrogen atom postulate.
(Remember the unexplained 2π factor?) By just fitting a whole number of
electron waves along the circumference of the atom, and using de Broglie’s
WHEN THE ELECTRON MOVES AROUND IN AN ATOM, ITS ASSOCIATED WAVE IS STATIONARY, I.E. IN A STANDING WAVE PATTERN (SEE P.106), LIKE A WAVE MOVING
ALONG A VIOLIN STRING FIXED AT ITS ENDS.
IN THIS SITUATION, ONLY CERTAIN DISCRETE FREQUENCIES ARE PRODUCED – THE FUNDAMENTAL AND ITS OVERTONES, AS ANY GOOD MUSIC STUDENT KNOWS.

relations, Bohr could have given a complete theoretical justification for the
orbital quantization. Watch, a little algebra . . .
Bohr’s quantum condition is no longer a postulate, it’s a reality . . .

Visualizing the Atom: the “Old Quantum Theory”
The “old quantum theory”, resulting in Bohr’s orbital model of the atom and its
modifications by Sommerfeld, could point to certain real successes: the
hydrogen spectrum, i.e. the derivation of the Balmer formula; quantum
numbers and selection rules for energy states in an atom; explanation of the
periodic table of the elements; and the Pauli Exclusion Principle.

BUT HOW SHOULD WE NOW THINK OF THE ELECTRON IN THE HYDROGEN ATOM . . . AS A TINY CHARGED PARTICLE CIRCLING THE NUCLEUS, JUMPING FROM ONE
ALLOWED ORBIT TO ANOTHER?

For the moment it doesn’t matter. We will need both to continue. But with this
ambiguous picture of wave and particle for the electron inside the atom, we are
getting closer to the real underlying essence of quantum theory.
OR AS A WAVE ADJUSTING ITS LENGTH JUST ENOUGH TO FIT EXACTLY INTO ONE OF THE ORBITS, SETTING UP A STANDING WAVE PATTERN WITH ITS ELECTRIC CHARGE
SOMEHOW DISTRIBUTED AROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE?

Triple Birth of the New Quantum Theory
Now a remarkable report on the end of 25 years of confusion. During the twelve
month period from June 1925 to June 1926, not one, not two, but three distinct
and independent developments of a complete quantum theory were published . . .
and then shown to be equivalent.
The following pages will outline how these discoveries were made and the
context which made them possible. The story begins with Bohr and his new

co te t w c

poss b e.

protégé, Werner Heisenberg.

Heisenberg, Genius and Mountain-Climber
Heisenberg (1901–76) grew up in Munich, where his father was professor of
Greek at the local university. Always interested in mountain walking,
Heisenberg was fortunate that Munich is set at the foot of the Bavarian Alps. He
was a brilliant student and an excellent pianist. At secondary school, he had
already immersed himself in independent studies of physics.

In the autumn of 1920, immediately after he had enrolled in the University of
Munich to study physics with Sommerfeld, he met Wolfgang Pauli. This was the
beginning of a lifelong friendship.
Pauli and Heisenberg were both at Göttingen in June 1922 when Heisenberg first
met Bohr. Only 20 years old and still working toward his Ph.D, Heisenberg rose
to make an objection after one of Bohr’s lectures, to which Bohr replied
somewhat hesitantly . . .

After returning from this walk, Bohr told friends about Heisenberg . . .
But Heisenberg had a surprise for Niels Bohr. He hated the imaginary electron
orbits in Bohr’s atomic model . . .
AT THE END OF THE LECTURE, BOHR CAME OVER AND ASKED ME TO JOIN HIM THAT AFTERNOON FOR A WALK OVER THE HAINBERG MOUNTAIN.
THIS WALK WAS TO HAVE PROFOUND REPERCUSSIONS ON MY SCIENTIFIC CAREER. PERHAPS IT IS MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT MY REAL SCIENTIFIC CAREER ONLY
STARTED THAT AFTERNOON WHEN BOHR TOLD ME . . . ATOMS WERE NOT THINGS!
WE TALKED FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME I SAW THAT ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF QUANTUM THEORY WAS DEEPLY WORRIED BY ITS
DIFFICULTIES. BOHR HAD IMMENSE INSIGHT, A RESULT NOT OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS BUT OF OBSERVATION OF THE ACTUAL PHENOMENA.
HE COULD SENSE A RELATIONSHIP INTUITIVELY RATHER THAN DERIVE IT FORMALLY.
HEISENBREG UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING. NOW THE SOLUTION IS IN HIS HANDS. HE MUST FIND A WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE QUANTUM THEORY.

In the spring of 1925, he left Copenhagen and returned to Göttingen where Max
Born (1882–1970) had made him a privatdozent at the age of only 22! In
Germany he was bothered by two major irritants: the pollen in the air and the
problem of the atomic orbits.
THEY COULD NEVER BE OBSERVED. WHAT GOOD IS IT TO SPEAK OF INVISIBLE ELECTRON PATHS INSIDE INVISIBLE TINY ATOMS?
IF AN ATOM CAN’T BE SEEN, THEN IT IS NOT A MEANINGFUL CONCEPT.
I HAD THIS VERY BAD ATTACK OF HAY FEVER. I COULDN’T EVEN SEE.
I WAS IN A TERRIBLE STATE AND DECIDED TO SEEK BETTER, I.E. POLLEN-FREE, AIR. I LEFT FOR THE ISLAND OF HELGOLAND IN THE NORTH SEA.
I WAS EXTREMELY TIRED WHEN I ARRIVED AND MY WHOLE FACE WAS SWOLLEN. THE LAND LADY AT AN INN ASKED IF I HAD BEEN BEATEN BY SOMEBODY.

Heisenberg’s Picture of the Atom
Heisenberg hardly slept, dividing his time between inventing quantum
mechanics, climbing rocks and memorizing poems by Goethe. He was
attempting to work out a code for connecting the quantum numbers and energy
states in an atom with the experimentally determined frequencies and intensities
(brightness) of the light spectra.

This was similar to what Planck had done on black-body radiation in 1900.
Using the concept which Bohr had called the correspondence principle, (where
quantum and classical regions overlap), Heisenberg imagined the Bohr atom at
very large orbits. There the orbital frequency would equal the radiation
frequency and the atom would be like a simple linear oscillator.
He knew how to analyse this problem from classical physics. Familiar quantities
like the linear momentum (p) and the displacement from equilibrium (q) could
now be used. Classically, he could solve the equation of motion, then calculate
the energy of the particle in the state n, the quantized values, En.
From the largest orbit – where he could get answers – he then tried to extrapolate
inside the atom. Here his intuition, some would call it genius, led him to a
formula for including all the possible states. He had broken the spectral code.
MY STARTING POINT WAS TO TREAT THE ATOM, NOT LIKE A LITTLE SOLAR SYSTEM, BUT LIKE A SIMPLE VIRTUAL OSCILLATOR WHICH COULD PRODUCE ALL THE
FREQUENCIES OF THE SPECTRUM.

At this point, knowing he was close to something quite new, Heisenberg made a
startling discovery.
In order to obtain the correct frequencies and intensities of the spectral lines for
his theory, Heisenberg somehow had to include the quantum postulate, as did
IN CLASSICAL THEORY THE PRODUCT p TIMES q ALWAYS EQUALS THE REVERSE, q TIMES p . . .
BUT IN QUANTUM THEORY, THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE.
THIS IS A VERY DISAGREEABLE SITUATION AND I AM TERRIBLY WORRIED THAT pq DOES NOT EQUAL qp!

Bohr.
That very night on Helgoland, he was able to show that the energy states were
quantized and time independent, i.e. they were stationary as in the Bohr atom.
He later called this . . .
I GUESSED THAT THE DIFFERENCE . . . pq – qp WAS NOT ZERO BUT EQUAL TO WZπi, WHERE i ISV=1, AN IMAGINARY NUMBER.

. . . A GIFT FROM HEAVEN.
IT WAS ABOUT THREE O̱CLOCK AT NIGHT WHEN THE FINAL RESULT OF THE CALCULATION LAY BEFORE ME. AT FIRST I WAS DEEPLY SHAKEN, SO EXCITED THAT I
COULD NOT THINK OF SLEEP.
SO I LEFT THE HOUSE AND AWAITED THE SUNRISE ON TOP OF A ROCK. THAT WAS “THE NIGHT OF HELGOLAND”.

Max Born and Matrix Mechanics
Pauli’s reaction was favourable. So before setting off for a visit to the Cavendish
Laboratory in Cambridge and a walking holiday, Heisenberg set the paper before
Max Born.
And with this, matrix mechanics was born – or perhaps one should write
I WAS VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT HEISENBERG’S WORK AND BEGAN TO THINK DAY AND NIGHT ABOUT THE STRANGE MULTIPLICATION LAW.
THEN ONE MORNING ABOUT 10 JULY, I SUDDENLY SAW THE LIGHT. HEISENBERG’S SYMBOLIC MULTIPLICATION WAS NOTHING MORE THAN MATRIX CALCULUS, WELL
KNOWN TO ME SINCE MY STUDENT DAYS.

“Born”. Working with a talented student, Pascual Jordan (1902–80) – an expert
on matrix methods – Born transposed Heisenberg’s theory into a systematic
matrix language.
Now the frequencies of the optical spectrum could be represented by an infinite
matrix which looks like this . . .
Since Heisenberg’s idea was that the individual oscillators with momentum p(t)
and displacement q(t) vibrate with these frequencies, they will also be infinite
matrices.
Heisenberg’s quantum postulate was introduced to obtain the correct frequencies
and intensities, each represented by a set of two numbers in matrix form.
pq–qp = (h/2πi) I (quantum condition)
I is the unit matrix which looks like this . . .


Pauli Shows Matrix Mechanics is Correct
When this condition was added to the classical equation of mechanics written in
matrix form, a system of equations was obtained which could produce values of
the frequencies and relative intensities of spectral lines of atoms. However, . . .
THOUGH I CAN DERIVE ALL THE OLD NEWTONIAN RESULTS WITH MY NEW THEORY, I CAN’T EVEN CALCULATE THE HYDROGEN SPECTRUM.
DON’T WORRY WERNER, I HAVE MASTERED THE COMPLEXITIES OF YOUR NEW MECHANICS ALREADY AND DEDUCED NOT ONLY THE SPECTRUM OF HYDROGEN BUT THE
ADDITIONAL LINES PRODUCED BY ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS AS WELL.

Heinsenberg had discovered the first complete version of quantum mechanics.
But something was different. The new theory came with no visual aids, no
model to picture in one’s mind. Gone were the intricate electron orbits which
Bohr and Sommerfeld had concocted to explain the hydrogen spectra. This was a
purely mathematical formalism, difficult to use and impossible to visualize. It
simply gave the right answers.
Heisenberg had abandoned all attempts to picture the atom as composed either of
particles or waves. He decided that any attempt to draw an analogy between
atomic structure and the structure of the classical world was destined to failure.
Later, the spectral patterns of other atoms were also derived. Yet no one knew
the physical significance of the strange non-commutability, a fundamental part
of the theory.
Could it mean that the order in which measurements were made might be
important? Could the act of measurement be that critical?
INSTEAD, I DESCRIBED THE ENERGY LEVELS OF ATOMS PURELY IN TERMS OF NUMBERS. SINCE THE MATHEMATICAL DEVICE USED TO MANIPULATE THESE NUMBERS
WAS CALLED A MATRIX, MY THEORY WAS CALLED MATRIX MECHANICS, A TERM I LOATHED BECAUSE IT WAS SO ABSTRACT.

Erwin Schrödinger – Genius and Lover
Meanwhile, other physicists had not given up on the idea of visualizing all
aspects of the physical universe, of which atomic structure should be a part!
Consequently, they did not take well to Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics.
In particular, the talented Erwin Schrödinger in Zürich despised the new theory,
devoid of pictures and full of mathematical complications.

Schrödinger was right about the first part, but dead wrong about the second!
Where Werner Heisenberg needed the solitude of mountain walks in the pollen-
free air, and Paul Dirac the monastic tranquillity of his college rooms at St.
John’s, Cambridge, Erwin Schrödinger needed something quite different for his
inspiration.
Schrödinger was a notorious womanizer, often inspired in his physics work by
his most recent love interest. During the Christmas holidays of 1925, he made
the most important discovery of his career during a passionate tryst in his
favourite romantic hotel in the Austrian Tyrol. He had been thinking about
waves.
I SET OUT TO DEVELOP ANOTHER VERSION BASED ON DE BROGLIE’S CONCEPT OF MATTER WAVES.
I BELIEVE MY APPROACH IS MORE ACCEPTABLE TO PHYSICISTS AND MARKS A RETURN TO THE CONTINUOUS, VISUALIZABLE WORLD OF CLASSICAL PHYSICS.

I HAVE BEEN INTENSELY CONCERNED THESE DAYS. . . UH
WITH LOUIS DE BROGLIE’S THEORY . . . AH
BUT IT HAS GRAVE DIFFICULTIES. OHH
I HAVE TRIEDIN VAIN . . . OOH
TO MAKE A PICTURE OF THE ELECTRON WAVE, REFRACTED SUFFICIENTLY TO TRAVEL IN. . . MHH AHG
ONE OF THE BOHR ORBITS. AND THEN . . .

Schrödinger’s Equation
The solution to Schrödinger’s equation was a wave that described in some
magical way the quantum aspects of the system. The physical interpretation of
I HAVE FOUND AN EQUATION WHICH CAN BE APPLIED TO ANY PHYSICAL SYSTEM IN WHICH THE MATHEMATICAL FORM OF THE ENERGY IS KNOWN.

this wave was to become one of the great philosophical problems of quantum
mechanics.
The wave itself is represented by the Greek symbol ψ, which to every physicist
today means only one thing . . . the solution to Schrödinger’s equation. He had
taken de Broglie’s idea of the wave description of matter very seriously indeed.

Fourier Wave Analysis of Periodic Functions
Although this heading sounds very technical, it is important to say just a few
words about Fourier analysis in order to appreciate the delight of the physicists
when Schrödinger’s equation appeared in January 1926.
I DEVELOPED A METHOD OF SOLVING EQUATIONS BY EXPRESSING ANY MATHEMATICAL FUNCTION AS THE SUM OF AN INFINITE SERIES OF OTHER PERIODIC
FUNCTIONS.
WHEN I WAS CONSIDERING MY WAVE EQUATION, FOURIER’S WELL-KNOWN TECHNIQUE WAS CALED THE METHOD OF EIGEN VALUES (EIGEN IS GERMAN FOR
“CERTAIN”). THE TRICK IS TO FIND THE CORRECT FUNCTIONS AND THE AMPLITUDES OF EACH THAT ADDED TOGETHER BY SUPERPOSITION, WOULD REPRODUCE THE
DESIRED SOLUTION.

Thus, the solution of Schrödinger’s equation – the wave function for the
system – was replaced by an infinite series – the wave functions of the
individual states – which are natural harmonics of each other. That is to say,
their frequencies are related in the ratio of whole numbers, or integers.
The method is shown by the graphs below. The bold curve indicates the initial
function which is then replaced by the sum of the infinite series of the harmonic
periodic waves.
Schrödinger’s remarkable discovery was that the replacement waves described
the individual states of the quantum system and their amplitudes gave the
relative importance of that particular state to the whole system.
IN OTHER WORDS, CONTAINED WITHIN THE WELL-ESTABLISHED AND WELL-UNDERSTOOD MATHEMATICS OF EIGEN VALUE FUNCTIONS WAS THE UNDERLYING
QUANTIZATION OF ATOMIC SYSTEMS.

Schrödinger’s equation has been universally recognized as one of the greatest
achievements of 20th century thought, containing much of physics and, in
principle, all of chemistry. It was immediately accepted as a mathematical tool
of unprecedented power for dealing with problems of the atomic structure of
matter.
Not surprisingly, the work became known as wave mechanics.

Visualizing Schrödinger’s Atom
What Schrödinger did was reduce the problem of the energy states in an atom to
a problem of finding the natural overtones of its vibrating system using Fourier
analysis.
The natural frequencies and the number of nodes of one-dimensional standing
waves (e.g. a violin string) are easy to visualize. This picture can be extended to
a two-dimensional system, such as the vibrations of a struck drum head.
Computer simulation of different vibrational states in a drum gives some
indication of what Schrödinger had in mind.

Though it is very difficult to visualize three-dimensional vibrating systems in
something like the hydrogen atom, the one-dimensional and two-dimensional
pictures should be helpful.
The integers called quantum numbers by Bohr, Sommerfeld and Heisenberg
were now related in a natural way to the number of nodes in a vibrating
system.

The Balmer Formula, the Zeeman Effect and All That
Soon it was shown that Schrödinger’s theory gave a complete description of the
spectral lines in the hydrogen atom, reproducing again the touchstone Balmer
formula. In addition, the splitting in electric and magnetic fields also popped
right out of the wave equation.
Schrödinger was thus able to observe that the integers (number of nodes) derived
from a three-dimensional wave solution precisely correspond to the three
quantum numbers n, k and m from the old quantum theory.

BUT IT WASN’T ANOMALOUS AT ALL. THEY JUST COULDN’T UNDERSTAND IT.

Schrödinger: a Return to Classical Physics?
In spite of the innovation of his breakthrough in quantum theory, the Austrian
mathematical physicist was from the traditional school of physics. He loathed
the concept of discontinuous quantum jumps within the atom proposed by Bohr.
Now he had a mathematical system which could explain the spectral lines
without the need to postulate these despicable quantum jumps. He made an
analogy to sound waves . . .
FREQUENCIES OF BRIGHT LINE SPECTRA CAN NOW BE VISUALIZED AS BEATS BETWEEN THE VIBRATION FREQUENCIES OF TWO OTHER QUANTUM STATES.
HOW MUCH MORE APPEALING IS THE CONCEPTION THAT IN QUANTUM TRANSITIONS ENERGY PASSES CONTINUOUSLY FROM ONE VIBRATION PATTERN TO ANOTHER,
RATHER THAN FROM INDESCRIBABLE JUMPING ELECTRONS.

Schrödinger intended to use his new discovery as a pathway back to a physics
based on continuum processes undisturbed by sudden transitions. He was
proposing an essentially classical theory of matter waves that would have the
same relationship to mechanics that Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetic waves
had to optics.

Who Needs Particles Anyway?
Schrödinger even began to doubt the existence of particles.
THE IMAGE POINT OR PARTICLE OF A MECHANICAL SYSTEM CAN BE REPRESENTED BY A WAVE GROUP WITH SMALL DIMENSIONS IN EVERY DIRECTION.
TODAY THIS IS CALLED A WAVE PACKET. THE IMAGE POINT (OR PARTICLE) MOVES WITH THE GROUP VELOCITY OF THE WAVE PACKET.
THIS LOOKS LIKE A PARTICLE, BUT IT’S REALLY A SUPERPOSITION OF THOUSANDS OF WAVES AS DE BROGLIE DESCRIBED.

Schrödinger wanted to describe all particles as the superposition of waves. But
the grand old man of classical physics, Henrik Lorentz (1853–1928), clear-
minded as ever in the last few years of his life, brought him to his senses with
brutal criticism of his physical interpretation.
THIS MIGHT WORK IN THE ATOM, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FREE ELECTRON?
CAN A WAVE PACKET REALLY STAY TOGETHER AND DESCRIBE A MOVING ELECTRON?
ERWIN, MY DEAR BOY, A FEW POINTS . . .
1) WAVE PACKETS WILL SPREAD WITH TIME AND YOUR IDEA OF REPRESENTING PARTICLES COMPLETELY IN TERMS OF THE SUPERPOSITION OF WAVES IS INVALID.
2) BEAT FREQUENCIES WILL NOT PRODUCE THE SPECTRAL LINES AS YOU HAD INITIALLY IMPLIED.
3) AND YOUR NEW DISCOVERIES CANNOT FIT AT ALL INTO A CLASSICAL FRAMEWORK.

It was soon shown that the wave function does spread out as time increases.
Clearly, Schrödinger was wrong and Lorentz was right!
So what is the relationship between the particle’s wave function and the particle
itself? Tough question. It was the final issue to be resolved in the development
of wave mechanics.
FROM THE SUMMER OF 1926, MY ORIGINAL CONVICTION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF WAVE MOTION AS THE SOURCE OF ALL PHYSICAL REALILTY BEGAN TO WAVER.

Two Theories, One Explanation
Schrödinger wondered if there was any relationship between his own theory and
Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics. At first he could see no connection. But in the
last week of February 1926, he found a remarkable result of his own analysis.
One was based on a clear conceptual wave model of atomic structure and the
other claimed that such a model was meaningless. Yet both gave the same
results. Very strange indeed!
Schrödinger’s equation was here to stay. In 1987 the equation appeared in its
final form on the first day postmark of the Austrian stamp commemorating
Schrödinger’s 100th anniversary.
I AM REPELLED BY THE HEISENBERG FORMALISM BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULT ALGEBRA INVOLVED AND THE LACK OF AN ANSCHAUSLICHKEIT, A VIEWPOINT OR
PICTURE.
YET TO MY SURPRISE, I SHOWED THAT THE TWO THEORIES WERE COMPLETELY EQUIVALENT FROM A MATHEMATICAL POINT OF VIEW.

Schrödinger Meets Heisenberg
In July 1926 Schrödinger lectured in Munich at Sommerfeld’s weekly
colloquium. Heisenberg was in the audience.
Schrödinger finished speaking, his equation on the blackboard. Are there any
questions?. . .
CAN YOU EXPLAIN QUANTIZED PROCESSES SUCH AS THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT AND BLACK-BODY RADIATION ON THE BASIS OF YOUR CONTINUUM WAVE MODEL?

HEISENBERG IS RIGHT! I CANNOT RECONCILE MY INTERPRETATION OF CONTINUOUS ELECTRON WAVES WITH PHENOMENA SUCH AS THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT.
THIS IS THE GREATEST DIFFICULT FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A CLASSICAL THEORY. AT THIS TIME, I CAN FIND NO SOLUTION AT ALL TO THE PROBLEM.

Max Born: the Probability Interpretation of ψ
Schrödinger had decided that ψ represented a “shadow wave” that somehow
indicated the position of the electron. Then he changed his mind, saying it was
the “density of the electronic charge”. Truthfully, he was confused.
A more acceptable idea was developed by Max Born in the summer of 1926. He
wrote a paper on collision phenomena, in which he introduced the quantum
mechanical probability.
One month later, Born stated that the probability of the existence of a state is
given by the square of the normalized amplitude of the individual wave function
(i.e. ψ2). This was another new concept – the probability that a certain quantum
ψ IS THE PROBABILITY AMPLITUDE FOR AN ELECTRON IN THE STATE n TO SCATTER INTO THE DIRECTION m. IT IS, IN A SENSE, ITS OWN INTENSITY WAVE.
WHEN IT IS SQUARED AND THE ABSOLUTE VALUE IS TAKEN, IT TURNS OUT TO BE A PHYSICAL PROBABILITY OF THE ASSOCIATED PARTICLE’S PRESENCE.

state exists. No more exact answers, said Born. In atomic theory, all we get are
probabilities.

Two Kinds of Probability
On 10 August 1926, Born gave a paper at Oxford in which he clearly
distinguished between the old and the new probabilities in physics. The old
classical Maxwell-Boltzmann theory (see here–here) had introduced microscopic
co-ordinates in the kinetic theory of gases, only to eliminate them for average
values based on probability due to ignorance. It had been impossible to calculate
the exact values for so many particles.
Born had found a way to reconcile particles and waves by introducing the
concept of probability. The wave ψ determines the likelihood that the electron
will be in a particular position Unlike the electromagnetic field ψ has no
BUT THE NEW THEORY GETS THE SAME RESULTS WITHOUT INTRODUCING AVERAGES AT ALL. THIS IS NOT PROBABILITY DUE TO IGNORANCE. THIS PROBABILITY IS ALL
WE CAN EVER KNOW ABOUT AN ATOMIC SYSTEM.

will be in a particular position. Unlike the electromagnetic field, ψ has no
physical reality.

Schrödinger’s Cat. . . The Quantum Measurement
Problem
About ten years after Born’s papers, the notion of the probability superposition
of quantum states was becoming generally accepted. Schrödinger, distressed that
his own equation was being misused, created a “thought experiment” which he
believed would demonstrate – once and for all – the absurdity of this concept.
Schrödinger imagined a bizarre experiment in which a live cat is placed in a box
with a radioactive source, a Geiger counter, a hammer and a sealed glass flask
containing deadly poison fumes. When a radioactive decay takes place, the
counter triggers a device releasing the hammer which falls and breaks the flask.
The fumes will then kill the cat.

SUPPOSE THE RADIOACTIVE SOURCE IS SUCH THAT QUANTUM THEORY PREDICTS A 50% PROBABILITY OF ONE DECAY PARTICLE EACH HOUR. AFTER AN HOUR HAS
PASSED, THERE IS AN EQUAL PROBABILITY OF EITHER STATE . . . THE LIVE CAT STATE OR THE DEAD CAT STATE.

Quantum theory (with the Born interpretation) would predict that exactly one
hour after the experiment began, the box would contain a cat that is neither
wholly alive nor wholly dead but a mixture of the two states, the superposition
of the two wave functions.
CAN THE CAT BE ALIVE AND DEAD AT THE SAME TIME?

Schrödinger thought he had made his point. Yet today, 60 years later, his so-
called paradox is used to teach the concepts of quantum probability and the
superposition of quantum states.
SEE, IT’S RIDICULOS!
THE PROBABILITY INTERPRETATION OF MY WAVE FUNCTION IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!
AS SOON AS WE LIFT UP THE LID OF THE BOX TO FIND OUT IF THE QUANTUM PREDICTION IS CORRECT, THE IMPASSE IS RESOLVED.
OUR ACT OF OBSERVATION COLLAPSES THE SUPERPOSITION OF THE TWO WAVE FUNCTIONS TO A SINGLE ONE, MAKING THE CAT DEFINITELY DEAD OR ALIVE.

Consciousness and the Collapsing Wave Function
The Hungarian-born physicist Eugene Wigner (1902–95), an expert on quantum
theory and a Nobel Laureate, seems to have been one of the few bothered by
what actually causes the collapse of the wave function.

Wigner’s has not been a popular explanation among physicists, nor even a
serious concern. Quantum theory works. It gives practical answers to the most
complicated theoretical questions. Those who use quantum theory as a work-a-
day experience could not care less what causes the wave function to collapse!
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE OBSERVER MAKES THE DIFFERENCE. WHEN WE BECOME CONSCIOUS OF SOMETHING, WE BRING ABOUT THE CRUCIAL COLLAPSE OF THE
WAVE FUNCTION, SO THAT THE PERPLEXING MIXED STATES OF LIFE AND DEATH DISAPPEAR.
CRITICS ASKED IF AN AMOEBA COULD CAUSE A COLLAPSE, OR EVEN IF THE CAT’S OWN CONSCIOUSNESS COULD KEEP IT REAL THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIMENT.
PHYSICS SEEMS UNRECOGNIZABLE FROM THE DAYS OF ISAAC NEWTON.

Paul Adrian Maurice Dirac: Genius and Recluse
Having seen two alternative versions of the new quantum theory – the first by
Heisenberg using matrix methods and the second dominated by Schrödinger’s
wave equation – now consider a third, developed independently by the English
mathematician, Paul A.M. Dirac.

In the summer of 1925, Heisenberg gave a talk in the Kapitza Club at
Cambridge, after which he gave his host Ralph Fowler a copy of the unpublished
manuscript of his new pioneering theory. Fowler passed it on to his young
graduate student Paul Dirac with the note, See what you think of this. Dirac took
the instruction seriously.
Working alone – as he would do for the entire 44 years of his career in physics –
Dirac saw that Heisenberg’s was an important new departure.
IT IS CAPABLE OF RESOLVING THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE OLD QUANTUM THEORY OF BOHR, EINSTIEN AND PLANCK.

Dirac’s Version of Quantum Mechanics
At first puzzled by the appearance of non-commuting quantities (where the
product of two quantities depended on their order, so that A x B does not equal
B x A), Dirac realised that this was the essence of the new approach. He quickly
found a link to classical physics and used the new fundamental idea of non-
commutability to develop his own version of Quantum Mechanics.

IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS, I COMPLETED A THIRTY-PAGE PAPER WHICH I SENT TO HEISENBERG FOR HIS OPINION.
I HAVE READ YOUR EXTRAORDINARILY BEAUTIFUL PAPER ON QUANTUM MECHANICS WITH THE GREATEST INTEREST, AND THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT ALL YOUR
RESULTS ARE CORRECT. THE PAPER IS REALLY BETTER WRITTEN AND MORE CONCENTRATED THAN OUR EFFORTS HERE.

Dirac’s Transformation Theory
But he was only just beginning. By November 1925, only four months after
receiving the germ of the new mechanics, Dirac had written a series of four
papers which attracted the attention of-theoreticians everywhere, but particularly
in Copenhagen, Gottingen and Munich, the main centres of quantum research.
Putting these together as a thesis for the Cambridge faculty, they happily gave
him a Ph.D.
Next, Bohr beckoned him to Copenhagen in September 1926. There Dirac
completed another important paper on transformation theory.

I SHOWED THAT BOTH THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED WAVE MECHANICS OF ERWIN SCHRÖDINGER AND HEISENBERG’S ORIGINAL MATRIX MECHANICS COULD BE VIEWED
AS SPECIAL CASES OF MY OWN MORE GENERAL FORMULATION. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY ARE ALL EQUIVALENT.

The Beginning of Quantum Electrodynamics
In Copenhagen and later in Gottingen, Dirac started working on problems of the
emission and absorption of electromagnetic radiation, i.e. light. A quarter of a
century earlier, Planck and Einstein had presented theoretical evidence that light
consisted of particles, which today are called photons.
Despite overwhelming evidence during the 19th century for the wave model of
light, Einstein had rekindled the controversy over the duality of particles and
waves. But common sense demanded that light must be one or the other. Dirac
showed that quantum theory had the answer to this apparent paradox.

The concept of a continuous field, introduced by Faraday and others (remember
those iron filings and the bar magnet in science class?), could now be broken up
into bits in order to interact with matter, already known to consist of discrete
entities like electrons, protons, etc. Dirac’s new approach could treat light as I
waves or particles and give the right answers. Magic!
BY CONSISTENTLY APPLYING TO MAXWELL’S ELECTROMAGNETIC THEORY, I CONSTRUCTED THE FIRST KNOWN SPECIMEN OF A QUANTUM FIELD THEORY.

J.C. Polkinghorne (b. 1930), a former professor of theoretical physics at
Cambridge who learned his quantum mechanics directly from Dirac, is today
still impressed with this achievement, 70 years later. He offers a vivid metaphor.
. .
Since this work of Dirac, the dual nature of light as wave and particle has VV
been free of paradox for those who can follow the mathematics. After World
War II, Dirac’s pioneering work was carried forward by Richard Feynman
(1918–88) and others.
DIRAC’S WAS WELL-UNDERSTOOD FORMALISM WHICH IF INTERROGATED IN A PARTICLE-LIKE WAY GAVE PARTICLE BEHAVIOUR AND IF INTERROGATED IN A WAVE-
LIKE WAY GAVE WAVE BEHAVIOUR. 
IT WAS AS IF SOMEONE HAD ASSERTED THAT IT WAS INCONCEIVABLE THAT A MAMMAL SHOULD LAY AN EGG AND THEN SUDDENLY A DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS
SHOWED UP.

WE CALL OUR THEORY QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS, OR QED FOR SHORT. IT DESCRIBES THE INTERACTION OF LIGHT AND MATTER WITH REMARKABLE ACCURACY.

The Dirac Equation and Electron Spin
International recognition did not change Dirac’s habits greatly. Returning to
Cambridge, he continued working intensely, almost always in the privacy of his
room in the cloistered quadrangle of St. John’s College. He was about to make
another great discovery.
The wave mechanics of Schrödinger had taken centre stage and the ubiquitous
wave equation dominated quantum theory (and still does for most practitioners).
Schrödinger did not know about the electron’s curious magnetic property, called
spin. Consequently, he had not been able successfully to incorporate Einstein’s
relativity into his wave equation. Dirac did it for him in breathtaking style, using
mainly aesthetic arguments.

The formula he found (now known as the Dirac Equation) not only gave the
description of an electron moving close to the speed of light, but predicted
without any ad hoc hypotheses that the electron had a spin of one-half, as was
known from experiments.
PRESERVING THE SYMMETRY OF BOTH SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS, I GUESSED A NEW WAVE EQUATION FOR THE ELECTRON. IT SEEMS TO WORK.

The Prediction of Anti-Matter
Remarkably, Dirac’s equation also dictated the existence of a positively
charged electron, the opposite charge to every electron which had previously
been observed.
THIS WAS THE FIRST THERE MIGHT BE SUCH A THING AS ANTI-MATTER, PARTICLES WITH MASS AND SPIN IDENTICAL TO ORDINARY MATTER, BUT WITH OPPOSITE
ELECTRIC CHARGE.

This prediction was verified a few years later, when anti-electrons, now called
positrons, were discovered by Carl Anderson in a cloud chamber at Caltech in
1932. Dirac had opened up a broad area of anti-particle physics.
Only a year after the positron was observed, Dirac received the Nobel Prize for
1933, awarded jointly to him and Schrödinger for their work on quantum theory.
Let’s go back to 1926–7 . . .

The Uncertainty Principle
In 1927, Heisenberg made a second major discovery, one as important as his
discovery of matrix mechanics. Driven by his positivist belief that only
measurable quantities should be part of any theory, Heisenberg realized that
quantum theory implied a fundamental limitation on how accurately certain pairs
of physical variables could be measured simultaneously. Here’s what he did.
Recall the non-commutability of the two variables – position and momentum
(pq – qp = h/2πi). . .
A quantitative relationship for this uncertainty was easily derived by estimating
the imprecision in a simultaneous measurement of position and momentum. To
locate or “see” precisely any object, the illuminating radiation must be
significantly smaller than the object itself. For an atomic electron, this means
waves much smaller than the ultraviolet, as the diameter of the entire hydrogen
I SHOWED THAT THERE IS NO WAY OF ACCURATELY PINPOINTING THE EXACT POSITION OF A SUN-ATOMIC PARTICLE, UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO BE QUITE
UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE PARTICLE’S MOMENTUM.
ALSO, THERE IS NO WAY TO PINPOINT THE PARTICLE’S EXACT MOMENTUM UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN ABOUT ITS POSITION. TO MEASURE
BOTH ACCURATELY AT THE SAME TIME IS IMPOSSIBLE.

atom is only a fraction of the wavelength of visible light.

Heisenberg’s Gamma-Ray Microscope
To study the problem, Heisenberg chose a hypothetical microscope using
gamma rays, which are very short but carry considerable momentum. Thus, the
path of the electron is not smooth and continuous, but herky-jerky due to
bombardment by the gamma-ray photons. George Gamow’s famous drawing of
Heisenberg’s hypothetical set-up is shown on this page. Bohr helped Heisenberg
clarify this part of the derivation.

This inaccuracy is approximately equal to the wavelength of the radiation being
used, as shown in the sketch. Thus, the imprecision in the position
measurement is Δ Χ ∼ λ. (N.B. Χ is being used for position instead of q, and ∼
means “approximately equal to”.)
Correspondingly, the minimum imprecision in the momentum measurement
is approximately equal to the momentum imparted to the electron by a single
photon used to illuminate the particle, the smallest disturbance possible. From
the de Broglie/Einstein relation, Δp ∼ h/λ, Heisenberg obtained the imprecision
in the momentum. Multiplying the two inaccuracies together, Heisenberg
showed that the product, ΔΧ Δp will always be greater than or equal to (≥) a
certain amount. . .
THE IMPRECISION IN THE POSITION MEASUREMENT OF AN OBJECT UNDER HIGH OPTICAL MAGNIFICATION, E.G. A MICROSCOPE, IS LIMITED BY DIFFRACTION, WHEN
INTERFERENCE PATTERNS OVERLAP.

This is Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle (HUP), which states that. . .
Though we don’t notice HUP in our everyday experience with the gross
macroscopic world, the wave/particle duality defeats the atomic experimentalist
who seeks perfection. But many believe there are serious philosophical
consequences for us all in this idea.
THE UNCERTAINLY IN A SIMULTANEOUS MEASUREMENT OF MOMENTUM AND POSITION IS ALWAYS GREATER THAN A FIXED AMOUNT, APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO
PLANCK’S CONSTANT h.

The Breakdown of Determinism
In the late 18th century, the French philosopher Pierre Simon de Laplace
(1749–1827) stated the Principle of Determinism:
This conclusion has its critics who say that such a relation, based on the atomic
world, cannot legitimately be raised to a universal law. This was answered
eloquently some years ago by Victor Weisskopf (b. 1908), a Hungarian
physicist who attended many meetings in the 1930s at Bohr’s institute.
. . . IF AT ONE TIME, WE KNEW THE POSITIONS AND MOTION OF ALL THE PARTICLES IN THE UNIVERSE, THEN WE COULD CALCULATE THEIR BEHAVIOUR AT ANY OTHER
TIME, IN THE PAST OR FUTURE.
(TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH BY STEPHEN HAWKING)
HUP DESTROYS THE FIRST PREMISE OF THIS STATEMENT, IN THAT WE CANNOT KNOW THE PRECISE POSITION AND MOTION OF A PARTICLE AT ANY TIME. THUS,
DETERMINISM CANNOT BE ACCEPTED CONGRUENTLY WITH HUP.

But no one could have dreamt what was in the other “Great Dane” Bohr’s
philosophy in the spring of 1927.
THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE HAS MADE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NATURE RICHER, NOT POORER. IT LIMITS THE APPLICABLITY OF CLASSICAL PHYSICS TO ATOMIC
EVENTS TO MAKE ROOM FOR NEW PHENOMENA LIKE THE WAVE/PARTICLE DUALITY. TO QUOTE FROM HAMLET:
“THERE ARE MORE THINGS IN HEAVEN AND EARTH, HORATIO, THAN ARE DREAMT OF IN YOUR PHILOSOPHY.”

Complementarity
On a skiing holiday in Norway in 1927, Bohr found what he believed to be the
central core of understanding quantum mechanics, the wave/particle duality. But
he had a new point of view.
ALTHOUGH WAVE AND PARTICLE BEHAVIOUR OF AN OBJECT MUTUALLY EXCLUDE EACH OTHER, BOTH ARE NECESSARY FOR THE FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE
OBJECT’S PROPERTIES. I CALL THIS NEW SITUATION, COMPLEMENTARITY.
IF TWO DESCRIPTIONS ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, THEN AT LEAST ONE OF THEM MUST BE WRONG.
WHETHER AN OBJECT BEHAVES AS A PARTICLE OF AS A WAVE DEPENDS ON YOUR CHOICE OF APPARTUS FOR LOOKING AT IT.


The Copenhagen Interpretation
After arguing with Heisenberg for weeks over this concept, Bohr began to bring
together the various parts of quantum theory into a consistent whole. He
combined various aspects of Heisenberg’s work – matrix mechanics and the
uncertainty principle – with Born’s probability interpretation of the Schrödinger
wave equation and his own complementarity.
EVEN MORE RADICALLY, I CONCLUDED (WITH HEISENBERG, PAULI AND BORN) THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF A STATE OF AN ATOMIC SYSTEM BEFORE A MEASUREMENT,
IS UNDEFINED, HAVING ONLY THE POTENTIALITY OF CERTAIN VALUES WITH CERTAIN PROBABILITIES.

This was another new concept, focusing on the quantum measurement problem
and its all-important connection to classical physics. This collection of ideas
became known as the Copenhagen Interpretation (CHI).

Como, Italy, September 1927
After struggling for months to articulate his thinking on all aspects of quantum
theory, Bohr presented a lecture at Como to most of Europe’s best physicists in
September 1927. Free from Einstein’s critical eye and ear (he would not set foot
in fascist Italy), Bohr described in detail the Principle of Complementarity for
the first time.

SUPPOSE ONE SET OF EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE CAN ONLY BE INTERPRETED ON THE BASIS OF WAVE PROPERTIES AND ANOTHER SET ONLY ON THE BASIS OF PARTICLE
PROPERTIES. THESE TWO SETS OF EVIDENCE ARE NOT CONTRADICTORY.
SINCE THE EVIDECE WAS OBTAINED UNDER DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS, IT CANNOT BE COMBINED IN A SINGLE PICTURE BUT MUST BE REGARDED AS
COMPLEMENTARY.

The Solvay Conference, October 1927
At the end of October 1927, only weeks after the Como meeting, Bohr arrived at
the Metropole Hotel in Brussels for the historic Solvay Conference highlighted
at the beginning of this book.
Einstein wanted a theory to describe the thing itself and not the probability of
its occurrence. Yet Bohr was confident that Einstein would accept his
THIS TIME, EINSTEIN WILL BE PRESENT AND I AM EAGER TO HEAR WHAT HE WILL HAVE TO SAY.

interpretation, which was tied to experiments. This was the method Einstein
himself had used in defending his theory of special relativity, which also
challenged common sense.
But to Bohr’s shock and disappointment, Einstein announced . . .
Einstein set out to demolish CHI by attacking the “distasteful” uncertainty
principle on which it was based. He used ingenious thought experiments, trying
to contradict Heisenberg’s law. But each time Bohr found a flaw in Einstein’s
scheme and refuted the argument.
I DO NOT LIKE THE PROBABILITY THEORY AND BELIEVE THE PATH FOLLOWED BY BORN, HEISENSBERG AND YOURSELF IS ONLY TEMPORARY, OF HEURISTIC VALUE, SO
TO SPEAK.

Einstein’s Box of Light
Three years later, at the next Solvay Meeting, the most serious challenge
occurred. Einstein believed that he had finally found a case where HUP was
violated. He described a box full of light and suggested that both the energy of a
single photon and the time it was emitted could be determined precisely. Time
and energy were, in principle, another pair of variables governed by HUP.
FIRST, THE BOX CAN BE WEIGHED, AFTER WHICH A SINGLE PHOTON CAN BE RELEASED AT A PARTICULAR INSTANT THROUGH A SHUTTER OPERATED BY CLOCKWORK
INSIDE THE BOX.
THEN THE BOX CAN BE WEIGHED AGAIN. KNOWING THE CHANGE IN MASS, THE ENERGY OF THE PHOTON CAN BE CALCULATED FROM MY EQUATION, E = MC2.
THE ENERGY CHANGE WOULD THEN BE KNOWN, AS WOULD THE PRECISE TIME WHEN THE PHOTON WAS EMITTED. SO, THAT’S THE END OF YOUR UNCERTAINTY

PRINCIPLE!

A Sleepless Night
Was Bohr stumped? Apparently he lay awake all night trying to work out what
was wrong with the experiment before the answer finally appeared. Next
morning, he produced a drawing of the box of light. Then, much to Einstein’s
chagrin, Bohr refuted his “light box” argument.

The master had forgotten his own theory, which Bohr used to calculate just the
uncertainty predicted by the Heisenberg relation. After this incident, CHI
became the orthodox way of viewing quantum theory, and has lasted to the
present day.
WHEN THE PHOTON IS RELEASED, THERE WILL BE A RECOIL, CAUSING AN UNCERTAINTY IN THE POSITION OF THE CLOCK IN THE EARTH’S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD.
THIS WILL PRODUCE A CORRESPONDING UNCERTAINTY IN THE TIME RECORDING DUE TO – BELIEVE IT OR NOT – YOUR OWN GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY!

The EPR Paradox
But did Einstein give up? Not exactly. Five years later, after Hitler’s rise to
power had dispersed European physicists all over the world, Einstein ended up at
the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. With two younger
colleagues, Boris Podolsky (1896–1966) and Nathan Rosen (b. 1909), he
developed another challenge to Bohr that was not based on the uncertainty
principle. It is known as the EPR paradox after its authors’ names.

IT IS POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN A PAIR OF PARTICLES, SAY ELECTRONS, IN A SO-CALLED SINGLET STATE WHERE THEIR SPINS CANCEL EACH OTHER TO GIVE A TOTAL SPIN OF
ZERO. LET US SUPPOSE THESE PARTICLES A AND B MOVE WIDELY APART, AFTER WHICH THE SPIN OF A ALONG ONE DIRECTION IS MEASURED AND FOUND TO BE IN THE
“UP” STATE.
BECAUSE THE TWO SPINS MUST CANCEL TO ZERO, IT FOLLOWS THAT PARTICLE B ALONG THE SAME DIRECTION MUST HAVE SPING “DOWN”.
IN CLASSICAL PHYSICS, THIS WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM AT ALL. ONE WOULD JUST CONCLUDE THAT PARTICLE B ALWAYS HAD SPIN “DOWN”, FROM THE TIME OF THE
SEPARATION.

The Locality Principle
HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO CHI, THE SPIN OF A HAS NO DEFINITE VALUE UNTIL IT IS MEASURED, AT WHICH POINT IT MUST PRODUCE AN INSTANTANEOUS EFFECT AT B,
COLLAPSING ITS SPIN WAVE FUNCTION INTO THE OPPOSITE OR “DOWN” STATE.
THIS BIZARRE SITUATION DEMANDS ACTION-AT-A-DISTANCE OR FASTER THAN LIGHT COMMUNICATION, NEITHER OF WHICH IS ACCEPTABLE.
IF TWO SYSTEMS ARE IN SOLATION FROM EACH OTHER FOR SOME TIME, THEN A MEASUREMENT ON THE FIRST CAN PRODUCE NO REAL CHANGE ON THE SECOND.
DON’T FORGET MY SPECIAL RELATIVITY-NOTHING TRAVELS FASTER THAN LIGHT!

Bohr and Non-Locality
This separateness or locality was not allowed, said Bohr. He immediately
reminded Einstein (and the world) what CHI had always asserted . . .
TWO ELECTRONS IN ‘SINGLE’ NET SPIN = ↑ + ↓ = 0
TELL ME IF YOU’RE UP OR DOWN, I HAVE TO BE OPPOSITE.
I WON’T KNOW UNTIL SOMEBODY MEASURES ME. (ACCORDING TO BOHR)
DON’T GET TOO FAR AWAY! YOUR SIGNALS CAN’T EXCEED THE SPEED OF LIGHT.(ACCORDING TO EINSTEIN).
DON’T WORRY, WE’RE BOTH PART OF THE SAME SYSTEM. (ACCORDING TO BOHR).
THIS IS A LARGE SYSTEM.

Quantum mechanics does not permit a separation between the observer and the
observed. The two electrons and the observer are part of a single system. The
EPR experiment does not demonstrate the incompleteness of quantum theory,
but the naivete of assuming local conditions in atomic systems. Once they have
been connected, atomic systems never separate.
The big question was whether this remarkable property of non-locality could
ever be experimentally tested. Or could the existence of Einstein’s separateness
be proven instead?

Bell’s Inequality Theorem
For thirty years after EPR, very little progress was made on this important
question, until a Belfast physicist, John S. Bell (1928–90) took a one-year leave
from CERN (European Centre for Nuclear Research). He developed an
ingenious inequality principle to test the questions raised by the paradox.
THE TEST IS BASED ON CORRELATED PHOTONS (INSTEAD OF ELECTRONS) IN WHICH THE POLARIZATION OF THE LIGHT IS DETECTED INSTEAD OF SPIN. BUT THE
PRINCIPLES ARE THE SAME: HOW DO CHANGES IN A AFFECT B?

To derive his inequality, Bell used certain facts and ideas with which everyone
could agree, except for. . . Einstein’s condition of locality, which he assumed to
be true.
Now, if experiments showed that the inequality was violated, this would mean
that one of the premises in his derivation was false. Bell chose to interpret this to
mean that nature is non-local.
Experiments by John Clauser and others at Berkeley in 1978 and, in particular,
by Alain Aspect’s group in Paris in 1982, indicated experimental verification of
the violation of Bell’s inequality.
This means that in spite of the local appearances of phenomena, our world is
actually supported by an invisible reality which is unmediated and allows
communication faster than light, even instantaneously.

An Undiscovered World
This would seem to be a most remarkable aspect of nature, and a discovery
resulting from the application of quantum theory. Bell’s work, which should
apply to any fundamental theory of nature (i.e. not just quantum theory), could
turn out to be one of the most important theoretical ideas of this century.
In spite of much enthusiasm in the last decade, there now appear to be certain
loopholes in experiments like Aspect’s, based on the statistical analysis of
hundreds of measurements. These loopholes have reverted the proof of Bell’s
theorem to that of an open question. Einstein and the EPR paradox still lives!
Much research is going on world-wide on this question, as noted from the web
page recently down-loaded from the Internet.
DO THESE EXPERIMENTS MEAN THAT EINSTEIN WAS WRONG AND THAT THE EPR EXPERIMENT IS NOT A PARADOX AT ALL?
WELL, NO. MUCH CARE NEEDS TO BE EXERCISED IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE EXPERIMENTS.


Quantum Theory and the New Millennium
The famous exchange depicted in the photo on this page does not represent
Einstein’s most serious challenge to Bohr’s interpretation of quantum theory.
Schrödinger’s waves and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle do work! But the
EPR paradox is another matter.
It is true that the experiments on correlated photons in 1982 (Aspect, et al.)
GOD DOES NOT PLAY DICE WITH THE UNIVERSE.
STOP TELLING GOD WHAT TO DO!

seemed to confirm violations of Bell’s Theorem, suggesting that nature is non-
local. The matter appeared to be settled.
But can non-locality really be true? Can we live with the preposterous concept
of action-at-a-distance (voodoo, ESP, etc)?
Today not everyone agrees that the correlation experiments are conclusive. So,
where does that leave us now?

John Archibald Wheeler, Quantum Physicist
The one man living today to answer this question is John Wheeler (b. 1911),
Emeritus Professor of Physics at Princeton University. Wheeler has been at the
cutting edge of 20th century physics – relativistic cosmology and quantum
theory – for over 60 years. He is well-known for his endless efforts to
comprehend all aspects of the quantum formalism. His work has emphasized the
central role of the observer in creating reality.
SOME OF US JUST CAN’T ACCEPT ALL THE EXPLANATIONS IMPLICIT IN CPI, ESPECIALLY NON-LOCALITY. COULD IT BE THAT EINSTEIN IS RIGHT . . .AGAIN?
FOR THE EPR PARADOX, REMEMBER: WE HAVE TO RIGHT TO ASK WHAT PHOTONS ARE DOING DURING THEIR TRAVEL. NO ELEMENTARY PARTICLE IS A PHENOMENON
UNTIL IT IS REGISTERED. I MUST SAY IN EVERYDAY CONTEXT, QUANTUM THEORY IS UNSHAKEABLE, UNCHALLENGEABLE, UNDEFEATABLE – IT’S BATTLE TESTED.

A Final Word
Wheeler wrote to the author recently . . .
December, 2000, is the 100th anniversary of the greatest discovery ever made in
the world of physics, the quantum. To celebrate, I would propose the title, “The
Quantum: The Glory and the Shame”. Why glory? Because there is not a branch
of physics which the quantum does not illuminate.
The shame, because we still do not know “how come the quantum ?”.
