Preface
The main purpose of this second edition is essentially the same as the ﬁrst edition with changes noted below.
Accordingly, ﬁrst we quote from the preface by Murray R. Spiegel in the ﬁrst edition of this text.
“The theory of functions of a complex variable, also called for brevity complex variables or complex
analysis, is one of the beautiful as well as useful branches of mathematics. Although originating in an
atmosphere of mystery, suspicion and distrust, as evidenced by the terms imaginary and complex
present in the literature, it was ﬁnally placed on a sound foundation in the 19th century through the
efforts of Cauchy, Riemann, Weierstrass, Gauss, and other great mathematicians.”
“This book is designed for use as a supplement to all current standards texts or as a textbook for a formal
course in complex variable theory and applications. It should also be of considerable value to those taking
courses in mathematics, physics, aerodynamics, elasticity, and many other ﬁelds of science and
engineering.”
“Each chapter begins with a clear statement of pertinent deﬁnitions, principles and theorems together
with illustrative and other descriptive material. This is followed by graded sets of solved and supplementary
problems. . . . Numerous proofs of theorems and derivations of formulas are included among the solved pro-
blems. The large number of supplementary problems with answers serve as complete review of the material
of each chapter.”
“Topics covered include the algebra and geometry of complex numbers, complex differential and inte-
gral calculus, inﬁnite series including Taylor and Laurent series, the theory of residues with applications to
the evaluation of integrals and series, and conformal mapping with applications drawn from various ﬁelds.”
“Considerable more material has been included here than can be covered in most ﬁrst courses. This has
been done to make the book more ﬂexible, to provide a more useful book of reference and to stimulate
further interest in the topics.”
Some of the changes we have made to the ﬁrst edition are as follows: (a) We have expanded and cor-
rected many of the sections to make it more accessible for our readers. (b) We have reformatted the
text, such as, the chapter number is now included in the label of all sections, examples, and problems.
(c) Many results are stated formally as Propositions and Theorems.
Finally, we wish to express our gratitude to the staff of McGraw-Hill, particularly to Charles Wall, for
their excellent cooperation at every stage in preparing this second edition.

Complex Numbers
1.1
The Real Number System
The number system as we know it today is a result of gradual development as indicated in the following list.
(1)
Natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . , also called positive integers, were ﬁrst used in counting. If a and
b are natural numbers, the sum a þ b and product a  b, (a)(b) or ab are also natural numbers. For
this reason, the set of natural numbers is said to be closed under the operations of addition and
multiplication or to satisfy the closure property with respect to these operations.
(2)
Negative integers and zero, denoted by 1, 2, 3, . . . and 0, respectively, permit solutions
of equations such as x þ b ¼ a where a and b are any natural numbers. This leads to the operation
of subtraction, or inverse of addition, and we write x ¼ a  b.
The set of positive and negative integers and zero is called the set of integers and is closed
under the operations of addition, multiplication, and subtraction.
(3)
Rational numbers or fractions such as 3
4 , 8
3 , . . . permit solutions of equations such as bx ¼ a
for all integers a and b where b=0. This leads to the operation of division or inverse of multipli-
cation, and we write x ¼ a=b or a 4 b (called the quotient of a and b) where a is the numerator
and b is the denominator.
The set of integers is a part or subset of the rational numbers, since integers correspond to
rational numbers a/b where b ¼ 1.
The set of rational numbers is closed under the operations of addition, subtraction, multipli-
cation, and division, so long as division by zero is excluded.
(4)
Irrational numbers such as
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
and p are numbers that cannot be expressed as a/b where a and b
are integers and b=0.
The set of rational and irrational numbers is called the set of real numbers. It is assumed that the student
is already familiar with the various operations on real numbers.
1.2
Graphical Representation of Real Numbers
Real numbers can be represented by points on a line called the real axis, as indicated in Fig. 1-1. The point
corresponding to zero is called the origin.

Conversely, to each point on the line there is one and only one real number. If a point A corresponding to
a real number a lies to the right of a point B corresponding to a real number b, we say that a is greater than b
or b is less than a and write a . b or b , a, respectively.
The set of all values of x such that a , x , b is called an open interval on the real axis while a  x  b,
which also includes the endpoints a and b, is called a closed interval. The symbol x, which can stand for any
real number, is called a real variable.
The absolute value of a real number a, denoted by jaj, is equal to a if a . 0, to a if a , 0 and to 0 if
a ¼ 0. The distance between two points a and b on the real axis is ja  bj.
1.3
The Complex Number System
There is no real number x that satisﬁes the polynomial equation x2 þ 1 ¼ 0. To permit solutions of this and
similar equations, the set of complex numbers is introduced.
We can consider a complex number as having the form a þ bi where a and b are real numbers and i,
which is called the imaginary unit, has the property that i2 ¼ 1. If z ¼ a þ bi, then a is called the real
part of z and b is called the imaginary part of z and are denoted by Refzg and Imfzg, respectively. The
symbol z, which can stand for any complex number, is called a complex variable.
Two complex numbers a þ bi and c þ di are equal if and only if a ¼ c and b ¼ d. We can consider real
numbers as a subset of the set of complex numbers with b ¼ 0. Accordingly the complex numbers 0 þ 0i
and 3 þ 0i represent the real numbers 0 and 3, respectively. If a ¼ 0, the complex number 0 þ bi or bi is
called a pure imaginary number.
The complex conjugate, or brieﬂy conjugate, of a complex number a þ bi is a  bi. The complex
conjugate of a complex number z is often indicated by z or z.
1.4
Fundamental Operations with Complex Numbers
In performing operations with complex numbers, we can proceed as in the algebra of real numbers,
replacing i2 by 1 when it occurs.
(1)
Addition
(a þ bi) þ (c þ di) ¼ a þ bi þ c þ di ¼ (a þ c) þ (b þ d)i
(2)
Subtraction
(a þ bi)  (c þ di) ¼ a þ bi  c  di ¼ (a  c) þ (b  d)i
(3)
Multiplication
(a þ bi)(c þ di) ¼ ac þ adi þ bci þ bdi2 ¼ (ac  bd) þ (ad þ bc)i
(4)
Division
If c=0 and d=0, then
a þ bi
c þ di ¼ a þ bi
c þ di  c  di
c  di ¼ ac  adi þ bci  bdi2

1.6
Axiomatic Foundation of the Complex Number System
From a strictly logical point of view, it is desirable to deﬁne a complex number as an ordered pair (a, b) of
real numbers a and b subject to certain operational deﬁnitions, which turn out to be equivalent to those
above. These deﬁnitions are as follows, where all letters represent real numbers.
A.
Equality
(a, b) ¼ (c, d) if and only if a ¼ c, b ¼ d
B.
Sum
(a, b) þ (c, d) ¼ (a þ c, b þ d)
C.
Product
(a, b)  (c, d) ¼ (ac  bd, ad þ bc)
m(a, b) ¼ (ma, mb)
From these we can show [Problem 1.14] that (a, b) ¼ a(1, 0) þ b(0, 1) and we associate this with a þ bi
where i is the symbol for (0, 1) and has the property that i2 ¼ (0, 1)(0, 1) ¼ (1, 0) [which can be
considered equivalent to the real number 1] and (1, 0) can be considered equivalent to the real
number 1. The ordered pair (0, 0) corresponds to the real number 0.
From the above, we can prove the following.
THEOREM 1.1:
Suppose z1, z2, z3 belong to the set S of complex numbers. Then
(1)
z1 þ z2 and z1z2 belong to S
Closure law
(2)
z1 þ z2 ¼ z2 þ z1
Commutative law of addition
(3)
z1 þ (z2 þ z3) ¼ (z1 þ z2) þ z3
Associative law of addition
(4)
z1z2 ¼ z2z1
Commutative law of multiplication
(5)
z1(z2z3) ¼ (z1z2)z3
Associative law of multiplication
(6)
z1(z2 þ z3) ¼ z1z2 þ z1z3
Distributive law
(7)
z1 þ 0 ¼ 0 þ z1 ¼ z1, 1  z1 ¼ z1  1 ¼ z1, 0 is called the identity with respect to addition, 1 is
called the identity with respect to multiplication.
(8)
For any complex number z1 there is a unique number z in S such that z þ z1 ¼ 0;
[z is called the inverse of z1 with respect to addition and is denoted by z1].
(9)
For any z1=0 there is a unique number z in S such that z1z ¼ zz1 ¼ 1;
[z is called the inverse of z1 with respect to multiplication and is denoted by z1
1
or 1=z1].
In general, any set such as S, whose members satisfy the above, is called a ﬁeld.
1.7
Graphical Representation of Complex Numbers
Suppose real scales are chosen on two mutually perpendicular axes X0OX and Y0OY [called the x and y axes,
respectively] as in Fig. 1-2. We can locate any point in the plane determined by these lines by the ordered
pair of real numbers (x, y) called rectangular coordinates of the point. Examples of the location of such
points are indicated by P, Q, R, S, and T in Fig. 1-2.
CHAPTER 1
Complex Numbers
3

Since a complex number x þ iy can be considered as an ordered pair of real numbers, we can represent
such numbers by points in an xy plane called the complex plane or Argand diagram. The complex number
represented by P, for example, could then be read as either (3, 4) or 3 þ 4i. To each complex number there
corresponds one and only one point in the plane, and conversely to each point in the plane there corresponds
one and only one complex number. Because of this we often refer to the complex number z as the point z.
Sometimes, we refer to the x and y axes as the real and imaginary axes, respectively, and to the complex
plane as the z plane. The distance between two points, z1 ¼ x1 þ iy1 and z2 ¼ x2 þ iy2, in the complex plane is
given by jz1z2j ¼

Polar Form of Complex Numbers
Let P be a point in the complex plane corresponding to the complex number (x, y) or x þ iy. Then we see
from Fig. 1-3 that
x ¼ r cos u,
y ¼ r sin u
where r ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
x2 þ y2
p
¼ jx þ iyj is called the modulus or absolute value of z ¼ x þ iy [denoted by mod z or
jzj]; and u, called the amplitude or argument of z ¼ x þ iy [denoted by arg z], is the angle that line OP makes
with the positive x axis.
It follows that
z ¼ x þ iy ¼ r(cos u þ i sin u)
(1:1)
which is called the polar form of the complex number, and r and u are called polar coordinates. It is some-
times convenient to write the abbreviation cis u for cos u þ i sin u.
For any complex number z=0 there corresponds only one value of u in 0 u ,2p. However, any other
interval of length 2p, for example p ,u p, can be used. Any particular choice, decided upon in
advance, is called the principal range, and the value of u is called its principal value.
1.9
De Moivre’s Theorem
Let z1 ¼ x1 þ iy1 ¼ r1(cos u1 þ i sin u1) and z2 ¼ x2 þ iy2 ¼ r2(cos u2 þ i sin u2), then we can show that
[see Problem 1.19]
z1z2 ¼ r1r2fcos(u1 þ u2) þ i sin(u1 þ u2)g
(1:2)

A generalization of (1.2) leads to
z1z2    zn ¼ r1r2    rnfcos(u1 þ u2 þ    þ un) þ i sin(u1 þ u2 þ    þ un)g
(1:4)
and if z1 ¼ z2 ¼    ¼ zn ¼ z this becomes
zn ¼ fr(cos u þ i sin u)gn ¼ rn(cos nu þ i sin nu)
(1:5)
which is often called De Moivre’s theorem.
1.10
Roots of Complex Numbers
A number w is called an nth root of a complex number z if wn ¼ z, and we write w ¼ z1=n. From
De Moivre’s theorem we can show that if n is a positive integer,
z1=n ¼ fr(cos u þ i sin u)g1=n
¼ r1=n cos u þ 2kp
n


þ i sin u þ 2kp
n




k ¼ 0, 1, 2, . . . , n  1
(1:6)
from which it follows that there are n different values for z1=n, i.e., n different nth roots of z, provided z=0.
1.11
Euler’s Formula
By assuming that the inﬁnite series expansion ex ¼ 1 þ x þ (x2=2!) þ (x3=3!) þ    of elementary calculus
holds when x ¼ iu, we can arrive at the result
eiu ¼ cos u þ i sin u
(1:7)
which is called Euler’s formula. It is more convenient, however, simply to take (1.7) as a deﬁnition of eiu.
In general, we deﬁne
ez ¼ exþiy ¼ exeiy ¼ ex(cos y þ i sin y)
(1:8)
In the special case where y ¼ 0 this reduces to ex.
Note that in terms of (1.7) De Moivre’s theorem reduces to (eiu)n ¼ einu.
1.12
Polynomial Equations
Often in practice we require solutions of polynomial equations having the form
a0zn þ a1zn1 þ a2zn2 þ    þ an1z þ an ¼ 0
(1:9)
where a0 =0, a1, . . . , an are given complex numbers and n is a positive integer called the degree of
the equation. Such solutions are also called zeros of the polynomial on the left of (1.9) or roots of the
equation.
CHAPTER 1
Complex Numbers
5

A very important theorem called the fundamental theorem of algebra [to be proved in Chapter 5] states
that every polynomial equation of the form (1.9) has at least one root in the complex plane. From this we can
show that it has in fact n complex roots, some or all of which may be identical.
If z1, z2, . . . , zn are the n roots, then (1.9) can be written
a0(z  z1)(z  z2)    (z  zn) ¼ 0
(1:10)
which is called the factored form of the polynomial equation.
1.13
The nth Roots of Unity
The solutions of the equation zn ¼ 1 where n is a positive integer are called the nth roots of unity and are
given by
z ¼ cos 2kp
n þ i sin 2kp
n ¼ e2kpi=n
k ¼ 0, 1, 2, . . . , n  1

If we let v ¼ cos 2p=n þ i sin 2p=n ¼ e2pi=n, the n roots are 1, v, v2, . . . , vn1. Geometrically, they rep-
resent the n vertices of a regular polygon of n sides inscribed in a circle of radius one with center at the
origin. This circle has the equation jzj ¼ 1 and is often called the unit circle.
1.14
Vector Interpretation of Complex Numbers
A complex number z ¼ x þ iy can be considered as a vector OP whose initial point is the origin O and
whose terminal point P is the point (x, y) as in Fig. 1-4. We sometimes call OP ¼ x þ iy the position
vector of P. Two vectors having the same length or magnitude and direction but different initial points,
such as OP and AB in Fig. 1-4, are considered equal. Hence we write OP ¼ AB ¼ x þ iy.

Addition of complex numbers corresponds to the parallelogram law for addition of vectors [see
Fig. 1-5]. Thus to add the complex numbers z1 and z2, we complete the parallelogram OABC whose
sides OA and OC correspond to z1 and z2. The diagonal OB of this parallelogram corresponds to z1 þ z2.
See Problem 1.5.
1.15
Stereographic Projection
Let P [Fig. 1-6] be the the complex plane and consider a sphere S tangent to P at z ¼ 0. The diameter NS is
perpendicular to P and we call points N and S the north and south poles of S. Corresponding to any point A
on P we can construct line NA intersecting S at point A0. Thus to each point of the complex plane P
there corresponds one and only one point of the sphere S, and we can represent any complex number by

CHAPTER 1
Complex Numbers

a point on the sphere. For completeness we say that the point N itself corresponds to the “point at inﬁnity” of
the plane. The set of all points of the complex plane including the point at inﬁnity is called the entire
complex plane, the entire z plane, or the extended complex plane.

The above method for mapping the plane on to the sphere is called stereographic projection. The sphere
is sometimes called the Riemann sphere. When the diameter of the Riemann sphere is chosen to be unity,
the equator corresponds to the unit circle of the complex plane.
1.16
Dot and Cross Product
Let z1 ¼ x1 þ iy1 and z2 ¼ x2 þ iy2 be two complex numbers [vectors]. The dot product [also called the
scalar product] of z1 and z2 is deﬁned as the real number
z1  z2 ¼ x1x2 þ y1y2 ¼ jz1jjz2j cos u
(1:12)
where u is the angle between z1 and z2 which lies between 0 and p.
The cross product of z1 and z2 is deﬁned as the vector z1  z2 ¼ (0, 0, x1y2  y1x2) perpendicular to the
complex plane having magnitude
jz1  z2j ¼ x1y2  y1x2 ¼ jz1jjz2j sin u
(1:13)
THEOREM 1.2:
Let z1 and z2 be non-zero. Then:
(1)
A necessary and sufﬁcient condition that z1 and z2 be perpendicular is that z1  z2 ¼ 0.
(2)
A necessary and sufﬁcient condition that z1 and z2 be parallel is that jz1  z2j ¼ 0.
(3)
The magnitude of the projection of z1 on z2 is jz1  z2j=jz2j.
(4)
The area of a parallelogram having sides z1 and z2 is jz1  z2j.
1.17
Complex Conjugate Coordinates
A point in the complex plane can be located by rectangular coordinates (x, y) or polar coordinates (r, u).
Many other possibilities exist. One such possibility uses the fact that x ¼ 1
2(z þ z), y ¼ (1=2i)(z  z)
where z ¼ x þ iy. The coordinates (z, z) that locate a point are called complex conjugate coordinates or
brieﬂy conjugate coordinates of the point [see Problems 1.43 and 1.44].
1.18
Point Sets
Any collection of points in the complex plane is called a (two-dimensional) point set, and each point is
called a member or element of the set. The following fundamental deﬁnitions are given here for reference.
(1)
Neighborhoods. A delta, or d, neighborhood of a point z0 is the set of all points z such that
jz  z0j , d where d is any given positive number. A deleted d neighborhood of z0 is a neigh-
borhood of z0 in which the point z0 is omitted, i.e., 0 , jz  z0j , d.
CHAPTER 1
Complex Numbers
7

(2)
Limit Points. A point z0 is called a limit point, cluster point, or point of accumulation of a point
set S if every deleted d neighborhood of z0 contains points of S.
Since d can be any positive number, it follows that S must have inﬁnitely many points. Note
that z0 may or may not belong to the set S.
(3)
Closed Sets. A set S is said to be closed if every limit point of S belongs to S, i.e., if S contains all
its limit points. For example, the set of all points z such that jzj  1 is a closed set.
(4)
Bounded Sets. A set S is called bounded if we can ﬁnd a constant M such that jzj , M for every
point z in S. An unbounded set is one which is not bounded. A set which is both bounded and
closed is called compact.
(5)
Interior, Exterior and Boundary Points. A point z0 is called an interior point of a set S
if we can ﬁnd a d neighborhood of z0 all of whose points belong to S. If every d neighborhood
of z0 contains points belonging to S and also points not belonging to S, then z0 is called a
boundary point. If a point is not an interior or boundary point of a set S, it is an exterior
point of S.
(6)
Open Sets. An open set is a set which consists only of interior points. For example, the set of
points z such that jzj , 1 is an open set.
(7)
Connected Sets. An open set S is said to be connected if any two points of the set can be
joined by a path consisting of straight line segments (i.e., a polygonal path) all points of
which are in S.
(8)
Open Regions or Domains. An open connected set is called an open region or domain.
(9)
Closure of a Set. If to a set S we add all the limit points of S, the new set is called the closure of S
and is a closed set.
(10)
Closed Regions. The closure of an open region or domain is called a closed region.
(11)
Regions. If to an open region or domain we add some, all or none of its limit points, we obtain a
set called a region. If all the limit points are added, the region is closed; if none are added, the
region is open. In this book whenever we use the word region without qualifying it, we shall
mean open region or domain.
(12)
Union and Intersection of Sets. A set consisting of all points belonging to set S1 or set S2 or to
both sets S1 and S2 is called the union of S1 and S2 and is denoted by S1 < S2.
A set consisting of all points belonging to both sets S1 and S2 is called the intersection of S1
and S2 and is denoted by S1 > S2.
(13)
Complement of a Set. A set consisting of all points which do not belong to S is called the comp-
lement of S and is denoted by ~S or Sc.
(14)
Null Sets and Subsets. It is convenient to consider a set consisting of no points at all. This set is
called the null set and is denoted by 1. If two sets S1 and S2 have no points in common (in which
case they are called disjoint or mutually exclusive sets), we can indicate this by writing
S1 > S2 ¼ 1.
Any set formed by choosing some, all or none of the points of a set S is called a subset
of S. If we exclude the case where all points of S are chosen, the set is called a proper
subset of S.
(15)
Countability of a Set. Suppose a set is ﬁnite or its elements can be placed into a one to one
correspondence with the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . . Then the set is called countable or denu-
merable; otherwise it is non-countable or non-denumerable.
The following are two important theorems on point sets.
(1)
Weierstrass–Bolzano Theorem. Every bounded inﬁnite set has at least one limit point.
(2)
Heine–Borel Theorem. Let S be a compact set each point of which is contained in one or more
of the open sets A1, A2, . . . [which are then said to cover S]. Then there exists a ﬁnite number of
the sets A1, A2, . . . which will cover S.

construct vector z2. At the terminal point of z2 construct vector z3, and at the terminal point of z3 construct

1.9. Let z1 ¼ x1 þ iy1 and z2 ¼ x2 þ iy2 represent two non-collinear or non-parallel vectors. If a and b
are real numbers (scalars) such that az1 þ bz2 ¼ 0, prove that a ¼ 0 and b ¼ 0.
CHAPTER 1
Complex Numbers
13

Solution
The given condition az1 þ bz2 ¼ 0 is equivalent to
a(x1 þ iy1) þ b(x2 þ iy2) ¼ 0 or ax1 þ bx2 þ i(ay1 þ by2) ¼ 0:
Then ax1 þ bx2 ¼ 0 and ay1 þ by2 ¼ 0. These equations have the simultaneous solution a ¼ 0, b ¼ 0 if
y1=x1 =y2=x2, i.e., if the vectors are non-collinear or non-parallel vectors.
1.10. Prove that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
Solution
Let OABC [Fig. 1-17] be the given parallelogram with diagonals intersecting at P.
Since z1 þ AC ¼ z2, AC ¼ z2  z1. Then AP ¼ m(z2  z1) where 0  m  1.
Since OB ¼ z1 þ z2, OP ¼ n(z1 þ z2) where 0  n  1.
But OA þ AP ¼ OP, i.e., z1 þ m(z2  z1) ¼ n(z1 þ z2)
or (1  m  n)z1 þ (m  n)z2 ¼ 0. Hence, by
Problem 1.9, 1  m  n ¼ 0, m  n ¼ 0 or m ¼ 1
2, n ¼ 1
2 and so P is the midpoint of both diagonals.
1.11. Find an equation for the straight line that passes through two given points A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2).
Solution
Let z1 ¼ x1 þ iy1 and z2 ¼ x2 þ iy2 be the position vectors of A and B, respectively. Let z ¼ x þ iy be the
position vector of any point P on the line joining A and B.
From Fig. 1-18,
OA þ AP ¼ OP
or
z1 þ AP ¼ z,
i:e:, AP ¼ z  z1
OA þ AB ¼ OB
or
z1 þ AB ¼ z2,
i:e:, AB ¼ z2  z1
Since AP and AB are collinear, AP ¼ tAB or z  z1 ¼ t(z2  z1) where t is real, and the required equation is
z ¼ z1 þ t(z2  z1)
or
z ¼ (1  t)z1 þ tz2
Using z1 ¼ x1 þ iy1,
z2 ¼ x2 þ iy2
and z ¼ x þ iy, this can be written
x  x1 ¼ t(x2  x1),
y  y1 ¼ t(y2  y1)
or
x  x1
x2  x1
¼ y  y1
y2  y1
The ﬁrst two are called parametric equations of the line and t is the parameter; the second is called the equation
of the line in standard form.
Another Method. Since AP and PB are collinear, we have for real numbers m and n:
mAP ¼ nPB
or
m(z  z1) ¼ n(z2  z)
Solving,
z ¼ mz1 þ nz2
m þ n
or
x ¼ mx1 þ nx2
m þ n
,
y ¼ my1 þ ny2
m þ n
which is called the symmetric form.

1.12. Let A(1, 2), B(3, 4), C(2, 2) be the three vertices of triangle ABC. Find the length of the median
from C to the side AB.
Solution
The position vectors of A, B, and C are given by z1 ¼ 1  2i, z2 ¼ 3 þ 4i and z3 ¼ 2 þ 2i, respectively.
Then, from Fig. 1-19,
AC ¼ z3  z1 ¼ 2 þ 2i  (1  2i) ¼ 1 þ 4i
BC ¼ z3  z2 ¼ 2 þ 2i  (3 þ 4i) ¼ 5  2i

since D is the midpoint of AB:

1.13. Find an equation for (a) a circle of radius 4 with center at (2, 1), (b) an ellipse with major axis of
length 10 and foci at (3, 0) and (3, 0).
Solution
(a)
The center can be represented by the complex number 2 þ i. If z is any point on the circle [Fig. 1-20], the
distance from z to 2 þ i is
jz  (2 þ i)j ¼ 4
Then jz þ 2  ij ¼ 4 is the required equation. In rectangular form, this is given by
j(x þ 2) þ i(y  1)j ¼ 4,

The sum of the distances from any point z on the ellipse [Fig. 1-21] to the foci must equal 10. Hence, the
required equation is
jz þ 3j þ jz  3j ¼ 10
In rectangular form, this reduces to x2=25 þ y2=16 ¼ 1 (see Problem 1.74).
Axiomatic Foundations of Complex Numbers
1.14. Use the deﬁnition of a complex number as an ordered pair of real numbers and the deﬁnitions on
page 3 to prove that (a, b) ¼ a(1, 0) þ b(0, 1) where (0, 1)(0, 1) ¼ (1, 0).
Solution
From the deﬁnitions of sum and product on page 3, we have
(a, b) ¼ (a, 0) þ (0, b) ¼ a(1, 0) þ b(0, 1)
where
(0, 1)(0, 1) ¼ (0  0  1  1, 0  1 þ 1  0) ¼ (1, 0)
By identifying (1, 0) with 1 and (0, 1) with i, we see that (a, b) ¼ a þ bi.
1.15. Suppose z1 ¼ (a1, b1), z2 ¼ (a2, b2), and z3 ¼ (a3, b3). Prove the distributive law:
z1(z2 þ z3) ¼ z1z2 þ z1z3:
Solution
We have
z1(z2 þ z3) ¼ (a1, b1)f(a2, b2) þ (a3, b3)g ¼ (a1, b1)(a2 þ a3, b2 þ b3)
¼ fa1(a2 þ a3)  b1(b2 þ b3), a1(b2 þ b3) þ b1(a2 þ a3)g

If we start with vector OA, whose magnitude is 6 and whose direction is that of the positive x axis, we can
obtain OP by rotating OA counterclockwise through an angle of 2408. In general, reiu is equivalent to a vector

an angle u.

2epi=4 ¼ 2fcos(p=4) þ i sin(p=4)g ¼ 2fcos(458) þ i sin(458)g
This complex number can be represented by vector OP in Fig. 1-28. This vector can be obtained by start-
ing with vector OA, whose magnitude is 2 and whose direction is that of the positive x axis, and rotating
it counterclockwise through an angle of 458 (which is the same as rotating it clockwise through an angle
of 458).
1.18. A man travels 12 miles northeast, 20 miles 308 west of north, and then 18 miles 608 south of west.
Determine (a) analytically and (b) graphically how far and in what direction he is from his starting
point.
Solution
(a)
Analytically. Let O be the starting point (see Fig. 1-29). Then
the successive displacements are represented by vectors OA,
AB, and BC. The result of all three displacements is represented
by the vector
OC ¼ OA þ AB þ BC
Now

Thus, the man is 14.7 miles from his starting point in a direction 1358490  908 ¼ 458490 west of north.
(b)
Graphically. Using a convenient unit of length such as PQ in Fig. 1-29, which represents 2 miles, and a
protractor to measure angles, construct vectors OA, AB, and BC. Then, by determining the number of units
in OC and the angle that OC makes with the y axis, we obtain the approximate results of (a).

In terms of Euler’s formula, eiu ¼ cos u þ i sin u, the results state that if z1 ¼ r1eiu1 and z2 ¼ r2eiu2, then
z1z2 ¼ r1r2ei(u1þu2) and z1=z2 ¼ r1eiu1=r2eiu2 ¼ (r1=r2)ei(u1u2).
1.20. Prove De Moivre’s theorem: (cos u þ i sin u)n ¼ cos nu þ i sin nu where n is any positive integer.
Solution
We use the principle of mathematical induction. Assume that the result is true for the particular positive integer
k, i.e., assume (cos u þ i sin u)k ¼ cos ku þ i sin ku. Then, multiplying both sides by cos u þ i sin u, we ﬁnd
(cos u þ i sin u)kþ1 ¼ (cos ku þ i sin ku)(cos u þ i sin u) ¼ cos(k þ 1)u þ i sin(k þ 1)u
by Problem 1.19. Thus, if the result is true for n ¼ k, then it is also true for n ¼ k þ 1. But, since the result is
clearly true for n ¼ 1, it must also be true for n ¼ 1 þ 1 ¼ 2 and n ¼ 2 þ 1 ¼ 3, etc., and so must be true for all
positive integers.
The result is equivalent to the statement (eiu)n ¼ eniu.

1.24. Given a complex number (vector) z, interpret geometrically zeia where a is real.
Solution
Let z ¼ reiu be represented graphically by vector OA in
Fig. 1-30. Then
zeia ¼ reiu  eia ¼ rei(uþa)
is the vector represented by OB.
Hence multiplication of a vector z by eia amounts to
rotating z counterclockwise through angle a. We can con-
sider eia as an operator that acts on z to produce this
rotation.

1.27. Prove that (a) arg(z1z2) ¼ arg z1 þ arg z2, (b) arg(z1=z2) ¼ arg z1  arg z2, stating appropriate con-
ditions of validity.
Solution
Let z1 ¼ r1(cos u1 þ i sin u1), z2 ¼ r2(cos u2 þ i sin u2). Then arg z1 ¼ u1, arg z2 ¼ u2.
(a)
Since z1z2 ¼ r1r2fcos(u1 þ u2) þ i sin(u1 þ u2)g, arg(z1z2) ¼ u1 þ u2 ¼ arg z1 þ arg z2.
(b)
Since z1=z2 ¼ (r1=r2)fcos(u1  u2) þ i sin(u1  u2)g, arg z1=z2
ð
Þ ¼ u1  u2 ¼ arg z1  arg z2.
Since there are many possible values for u1 ¼ arg z1 and u2 ¼ arg z2, we can only say that the two sides
in the above equalities are equal for some values of arg z1 and arg z2. They may not hold even if principal
values are used.

1.28. (a) Find all values of z for which z5 ¼ 32, and (b) locate these values in the complex plane.
Solution
(a)
In polar form, 32 ¼ 32fcos(p þ 2kp) þ i sin(p þ 2kp)g, k ¼ 0, +1, +2, . . . .
Let z ¼ r(cos u þ i sin u). Then, by De Moivre’s theorem,
z5 ¼ r5(cos 5u þ i sin 5u) ¼ 32fcos(p þ 2kp) þ i sin(p þ 2kp)g
and so r5 ¼ 32, 5u ¼ p þ 2kp, from which r ¼ 2, u ¼ (p þ 2kp)=5. Hence

By considering k ¼ 5, 6, . . . as well as negative
values, 1, 2, . . . , repetitions of the above ﬁve
values of z are obtained. Hence, these are the only
solutions or roots of the given equation. These ﬁve
roots are called the ﬁfth roots of 32 and are collec-
tively denoted by (32)1=5. In general, a1=n rep-

1.30. Find the square roots of 15  8i.
Solution
Method 1.
15  8i ¼ 17fcos(u þ 2kp) þ i sin(u þ 2kp)g
where cos u ¼ 15=17, sin u ¼ 8=17. Then the square roots of 15  8i are

, and so from (1) and (2) the required square roots are
1 þ 4i and 1  4i. As a check, note that (1 þ 4i)2 ¼ (1  4i)2 ¼ 15  8i.
Method 2.
Let p þ iq, where p and q are real, represent the required square roots. Then
(p þ iq)2 ¼ p2  q2 þ 2pqi ¼ 15  8i
or
p2  q2 ¼ 15
(3)
pq ¼ 4
(4)
Substituting q ¼ 4=p from (4) into (3), it becomes p2  16=p2 ¼ 15 or p4 þ 15p2  16 ¼ 0,
i.e., ( p2 þ 16)(p2  1) ¼ 0 or p2 ¼ 16, p2 ¼ 1. Since p is real, p ¼ +1. From (4), if p ¼ 1, q ¼ 4;
if p ¼ 1, q ¼ 4. Thus the roots are 1 þ 4i and 1  4i.

given equation.
1.33. Suppose the real rational number p/q (where p and q have no common factor except +1, i.e., p/q is
in
lowest
terms)
satisﬁes
the
polynomial
equation
a0zn þ a1zn1 þ    þ an ¼ 0
where
a0, a1, . . . , an are integers. Show that p and q must be factors of an and a0, respectively.
Solution
Substituting z ¼ p=q in the given equation and multiplying by qn yields
a0pn þ a1pn1q þ    þ an1pqn1 þ anqn ¼ 0
(1)
Dividing by p and transposing the last term,
a0pn1 þ a1pn2q þ    þ an1qn1 ¼  anqn
p
(2)
Since the left side of (2) is an integer, so also is the right side. But since p has no factor in common with q, it
cannot divide qn and so must divide an.
Similarly, on dividing (1) by q and transposing the ﬁrst term, we ﬁnd that q must divide a0.
1.34. Solve 6z4  25z3 þ 32z2 þ 3z  10 ¼ 0.
Solution
The integer factors of 6 and 10 are, respectively, +1, +2, +3, +6 and +1, +2, +5, +10. Hence, by
Problem 1.33, the possible rational solutions are +1, +1=2, +1=3, +1=6, +2, +2=3, +5, +5=2, +5=3,
+5=6, +10, +10=3.
By trial, we ﬁnd that z ¼ 1=2 and z ¼ 2=3 are solutions, and so the polynomial
(2z þ 1)(3z  2) ¼ 6z2  z  2 is a factor of 6z4  25z3 þ 32z2 þ 3z  10
the other factor being z2  4z þ 5 as found by long division. Hence
6z4  25z3 þ 32z2 þ 3z  10 ¼ (6z2  z  2)(z2  4z þ 5) ¼ 0
The solutions of z2  4z þ 5 ¼ 0 are [see Problem 1.31]

a1=a0 and (1)nan=a0, respectively.
Solution
If z1, z2, . . . , zn are the n roots, the equation can be written in factored form as
a0(z  z1)(z  z2)    (z  zn) ¼ 0
CHAPTER 1

Direct multiplication shows that
a0fzn  (z1 þ z2 þ    þ zn)zn1 þ    þ (1)nz1z2    zng ¼ 0
It follows that a0(z1 þ z2 þ    þ zn) ¼ a1 and a0(1)nz1z2    zn ¼ an, from which
z1 þ z2 þ    þ zn ¼ a1=a0,
z1z2    zn ¼ (1)nan=a0
as required.
1.36. Suppose p þ qi is a root of a0zn þ a1zn1 þ    þ an ¼ 0 where a0=0, a1, . . . , an, p and q are real.
Prove that p  qi is also a root.
Solution
Let p þ qi ¼ reiu in polar form. Since this satisﬁes the equation,
a0rneinu þ a1rn1ei(n1)u þ    þ an1reiu þ an ¼ 0
Taking the conjugate of both sides
a0rneinu þ a1rn1ei(n1)u þ    þ an1reiu þ an ¼ 0
we see that reiu ¼ p  qi is also a root. The result does not hold if a0, . . . , an are not all real (see Problem 1.32).
The theorem is often expressed in the statement: The zeros of a polynomial with real coefﬁcients occur in
conjugate pairs.
The nth Roots of Unity
1.37. Find all the 5th roots of unity.
Solution
z5 ¼ 1 ¼ cos 2kp þ i sin 2kp ¼ e2kpi

z ¼ cos 2kp
5 þ i sin 2kp
5
¼ e2kpi=5
where it is sufﬁcient to use k ¼ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 since all other values of k lead to repetition.
Thus the roots are 1, e2pi=5, e4pi=5, e6pi=5, e8pi=5. If we call e2pi=5 ¼ v, these can be denoted by
1, v, v2, v3, v4.

Method 2. Substitute x ¼ (z þ z)=2, y ¼ (z  z)=2i in x2 þ y2 ¼ 36 to obtain zz ¼ 36.

Point Sets
1.45. Given the point set S:fi, 1
2 i, 1
3 i, 1
4 i, . . .g or brieﬂy fi=ng. (a) Is S bounded? (b) What are its limit
points, if any? (c) Is S closed? (d) What are its interior and boundary points? (e) Is S open? (f) Is
S connected? (g) Is S an open region or domain? (h) What is the closure of S? (i) What is the comp-
lement of S? (j) Is S countable? (k) Is S compact? (l) Is the closure of S compact?
Solution
(a)
S is bounded since for every point z in S, jzj , 2 (for example), i.e., all points of S lie inside a circle of
radius 2 with center at the origin.
(b)
Since every deleted neighborhood of z ¼ 0 contains points of S, a limit point is z ¼ 0. It is the only limit
point.
Note that since S is bounded and inﬁnite, the Weierstrass–Bolzano theorem predicts at least one limit
point.
(c)
S is not closed since the limit point z ¼ 0 does not belong to S.
(d)
Every d neighborhood of any point i/n (i.e., every circle of radius d with center at i/n) contains points that
belong to S and points that do not belong to S. Thus every point of S, as well as the point z ¼ 0, is a bound-
ary point. S has no interior points.
(e)
S does not consist of any interior points. Hence, it cannot be open. Thus, S is neither open nor closed.
(f)
If we join any two points of S by a polygonal path, there are points on this path that do not belong to S.
Thus S is not connected.
(g)
Since S is not an open connected set, it is not an open region or domain.
(h)
The closure of S consists of the set S together with the limit point zero, i.e., f0, i, 1
2 i, 1
3 i, . . .g.
(i)
The complement of S is the set of all points not belonging to S, i.e., all points z = i, i=2, i=3, . . . :
(j)
There is a one to one correspondence between the elements of S and the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . as

(k)
S is bounded but not closed. Hence, it is not compact.
(l)
The closure of S is bounded and closed and so is compact.

(a) A < B, (b) A > B, (c) A > C, (d) A > (B < C), (e) (A > B) < (A > C), (f) A > (B > C).
Solution
(a)
A < B consists of points belonging either to A or B or both and is given by f3, i, 4, 2 þ i, 5, 0, 1g.
(b)
A > B consists of points belonging to both A and B and is given by fi, 2 þ ig.
(c)
A > C ¼ f3g, consisting of only the member 3.
(d)

Hence A > (B < C) ¼ f3, i, 2 þ ig, consisting of points belonging to both A and B < C.
(e)
A > B ¼ fi, 2 þ ig, A > C ¼ f3g from parts (b) and (c). Hence (A > B) < (A > C) ¼ fi, 2 þ i, 3g.
From this and the result of (d), we see that A > (B < C) ¼ (A > B) < (A > C), which illustrates the
fact that A, B, C satisfy the distributive law. We can show that sets exhibit many of the properties
valid in the algebra of numbers. This is of great importance in theory and application.
(f)
B > C ¼ 1, the null set, since there are no points common to both B and C. Hence, A > (B > C) ¼ 1
also.

Numbers that are not algebraic, i.e., do not satisfy any polynomial equation with integer coefﬁcients, are
called transcendental numbers. It has been proved that the numbers p and e are transcendental. However, it
is still not yet known whether numbers such as ep or e þ p, for example, are transcendental or not.

(x þ 5)2 þ y2 ¼ 16
i.e., jz þ 5j ¼ 4, a circle of radius 4 with center at (5, 0) as shown in Fig. 1-36.
Geometrically, any point P on this circle is such that the distance from P to point B(3, 0) is twice the
distance from P to point A(3, 0).

2m1
Solution
The roots of zm ¼ 1 are z ¼ 1, e2pi=m, e4pi=m, . . . , e2(m1)pi=m. Then, we can write
zm  1 ¼ (z  1)(z  e2pi=m)(z  e4pi=m)    (z  e2(m1)pi=m)
Dividing both sides by z  1 and then letting z ¼ 1 [realizing that (zm  1)=(z  1) ¼ 1 þ z þ z2 þ    þ zm1],
we ﬁnd
m ¼ (1  e2pi=m)(1  e4pi=m)    (1  e2(m1)pi=m)
(1)
Taking the complex conjugate of both sides of (1) yields
m ¼ (1  e2pi=m)(1  e4pi=m)    (1  e2(m1)pi=m)
(2)
Multiplying (1) by (2) using (1  e2kpi=m)(1  e2kpi=m) ¼ 2  2 cos(2kp=m), we have

Then, taking the positive square root of both sides yields the required result.

Functions, Limits, and

2.1
Variables and Functions
A symbol, such as z, which can stand for any one of a set of complex numbers is called a complex variable.
Suppose, to each value that a complex variable z can assume, there corresponds one or more values of a
complex variable w. We then say that w is a function of z and write w ¼ f(z) or w ¼ G(z), etc. The variable z
is sometimes called an independent variable, while w is called a dependent variable. The value of a function
at z ¼ a is often written f(a). Thus, if f(z) ¼ z2, then f(2i) ¼ (2i)2 ¼ 4.

If only one value of w corresponds to each value of z, we say that w is a single-valued function of z or that
f(z) is single-valued. If more than one value of w corresponds to each value of z, we say that w is a multiple-
valued or many-valued function of z.
A multiple-valued function can be considered as a collection of single-valued functions, each member of
which is called a branch of the function. It is customary to consider one particular member as a principal
branch of the multiple-valued function and the value of the function corresponding to this branch as the
principal value.
EXAMPLE 2.1
(a)
If w ¼ z2, then to each value of z there is only one value of w. Hence, w ¼ f(z) ¼ z2 is a single-valued
function of z.
(b)
If w2 ¼ z, then to each value of z there are two values of w. Hence, w2 ¼ z deﬁnes a multiple-valued (in this
case two-valued) function of z.
Whenever we speak of function, we shall, unless otherwise stated, assume single-valued function.
2.3
Inverse Functions
If w ¼ f(z), then we can also consider z as a function, possibly multiple-valued, of w, written
z ¼ g(w) ¼ f 1(w). The function f 1 is often called the inverse function corresponding to f. Thus,
w ¼ f(z) and w ¼ f 1(z) are inverse functions of each other.

2.4
Transformations
If w ¼ u þ iv (where u and v are real) is a single-valued function of z ¼ x þ iy (where x and y are real), we
can write u þ iv ¼ f(x þ iy). By equating real and imaginary parts, this is seen to be equivalent to
u ¼ u(x, y),
v ¼ v(x, y)
(2:1)
Thus given a point (x, y) in the z plane, such as P in Fig. 2-1, there corresponds a point (u, v) in the w plane,
say P0 in Fig. 2-2. The set of equations (2.1) [or the equivalent, w ¼ f(z)] is called a transformation. We
say that point P is mapped or transformed into point P0 by means of the transformation and call P0 the
image of P.
EXAMPLE 2.2
If w ¼ z2, then u þ iv ¼ (x þ iy)2 ¼ x2  y2 þ 2ixy and the transformation is u ¼ x2  y2,
v ¼ 2xy. The image of a point (1, 2) in the z plane is the point (3, 4) in the w plane.

In general, under a transformation, a set of points such as those on curve PQ of Fig. 2-1 is mapped into a
corresponding set of points, called the image, such as those on curve P0Q0 in Fig. 2-2. The particular charac-
teristics of the image depend of course on the type of function f(z), which is sometimes called a mapping
function. If f(z) is multiple-valued, a point (or curve) in the z plane is mapped in general into more than one
point (or curve) in the w plane.
2.5
Curvilinear Coordinates
Given the transformation w ¼ f(z) or, equivalently, u ¼ u(x, y), v ¼ v(x, y), we call (x, y) the rectangular
coordinates corresponding to a point P in the z plane and (u, v) the curvilinear coordinates of P.
u(x, y) = c2
u(x, y) = c1

CHAPTER 2
Functions, Limits, and Continuity

The curves u(x, y) ¼ c1, v(x, y) ¼ c2, where c1 and c2 are constants, are called coordinate curves [see
Fig. 2-3] and each pair of these curves intersects in a point. These curves map into mutually orthogonal
lines in the w plane [see Fig. 2-4].
2.6
The Elementary Functions
1.
Polynomial Functions are deﬁned by
w ¼ a0zn þ a1zn1 þ    þ an1z þ an ¼ P(z)
(2:2)
where a0 =0, a1, . . . , an are complex constants and n is a positive integer called the degree of
the polynomial P(z).
The transformation w ¼ az þ b is called a linear transformation.
2.
Rational Algebraic Functions are deﬁned by
w ¼ P(z)
Q(z)
(2:3)
where P(z) and Q(z) are polynomials. We sometimes call (2.3) a rational transformation. The
special case w ¼ (az þ b)=(cz þ d) where ad  bc=0 is often called a bilinear or fractional
linear transformation.
3.
Exponential Functions are deﬁned by
w ¼ ez ¼ exþiy ¼ ex(cos y þ i sin y)
(2:4)
where e is the natural base of logarithms. If a is real and positive, we deﬁne
az ¼ ez ln a
(2:5)
where ln a is the natural logarithm of a. This reduces to (4) if a ¼ e.
Complex exponential functions have properties similar to those of real exponential functions.
For example, ez1  ez2 ¼ ez1þz2, ez1=ez2 ¼ ez1z2.
4.
Trigonometric Functions. We deﬁne the trigonometric or circular functions sin z, cos z, etc., in
terms of exponential functions as follows:
sin z ¼ eiz  eiz
2i
,
cos z ¼ eiz þ eiz
2
sec z ¼

cos z ¼
2
eiz þ eiz ,
csc z ¼

sin z ¼

eiz  eiz
tan z ¼ sin z
cos z ¼ eiz  eiz
i(eiz þ eiz) ,
cot z ¼ cos z
sin z ¼ i(eiz þ eiz)
eiz  eiz
Many of the properties familiar in the case of real trigonometric functions also hold for the
complex trigonometric functions. For example, we have:
sin2 z þ cos2 z ¼ 1,
1 þ tan2 z ¼ sec2 z,
1 þ cot2 z ¼ csc2 z
sin(z) ¼ sin z,
cos(z) ¼ cos z,
tan(z) ¼ tan z
sin(z1+z2) ¼ sin z1 cos z2+cos z1 sin z2
cos(z1+z2) ¼ cos z1 cos z2+sin z1 sin z2
tan(z1+z2) ¼ tan z1+tan z2
1+tan z1 tan z2

Hyperbolic Functions are deﬁned as follows:
sinh z ¼ ez  ez

cosh z ¼ ez þ ez
2
sech z ¼

cosh z ¼
2
ez þ ez ,
csch z ¼

ez  ez
tanh z ¼ sinh z
cosh z ¼ ez  ez
ez þ ez ,
coth z ¼ cosh z
sinh z ¼ ez þ ez
ez  ez
The following properties hold:
cosh2 z  sinh2 z ¼ 1,
1  tanh2 z ¼ sech2 z,
coth2 z  1 ¼ csch2 z
sinh(z) ¼ sinh z,
cosh(z) ¼ cosh z,
tanh(z) ¼ tanh z
sinh(z1+z2) ¼ sinh z1 cosh z2+cosh z1 sinh z2
cosh(z1+z2) ¼ cosh z1 cosh z2+sinh z1 sinh z2
tanh(z1+z2) ¼ tanh z1+ tanh z2
1+ tanh z1 tanh z2
The following relations exist between the trigonometric or circular functions and the hyperbolic
functions:
sin iz ¼ i sinh z,
cos iz ¼ cosh z,
tan iz ¼ i tanh z
sinh iz ¼ i sin z,
cosh iz ¼ cos z,
tanh iz ¼ i tan z
6.
Logarithmic Functions. If z ¼ ew, then we write w ¼ ln z, called the natural logarithm of z. Thus
the natural logarithmic function is the inverse of the exponential function and can be deﬁned by
w ¼ ln z ¼ ln r þ i(u þ 2kp);
k ¼ 0, +1, +2, . . .
where z ¼ reiu ¼ rei(uþ2kp). Note that ln z is a multiple-valued (in this case, inﬁnitely-many-
valued) function. The principal-value or principal branch of ln z is sometimes deﬁned as
ln r þ iu where 0  u , 2p. However, any other interval of length 2p can be used, e.g.,
p , u  p, etc.
The logarithmic function can be deﬁned for real bases other than e. Thus, if z ¼ aw, then
w ¼ loga z where a . 0 and a=0, 1. In this case, z ¼ ew ln a and so, w ¼ (ln z)=(ln a).
7.
Inverse Trigonometric Functions. If z ¼ sin w, then w ¼ sin1 z is called the inverse sine of z
or arc sine of z. Similarly, we deﬁne other inverse trigonometric or circular functions cos1 z,
tan1 z, etc. These functions, which are multiple-valued, can be expressed in terms of natural
logarithms as follows. In all cases, we omit an additive constant 2kpi, k ¼ 0, +1, +2, . . . , in
the logarithm:

Inverse Hyperbolic Functions. If z ¼ sinh w, then w ¼ sinh1 z is called the inverse hyperbolic
sine of z. Similarly, we deﬁne other inverse hyperbolic functions cosh1 z, tanh1 z, etc. These
functions, which are multiple-valued, can be expressed in terms of natural logarithms as
follows. In all cases, we omit an additive constant 2kpi, k ¼ 0, +1, +2, . . . , in the logarithm:

The Function za, where a may be complex, is deﬁned as ea ln z. Similarly, if f(z) and g(z) are two
given functions of z, we can deﬁne f(z)g(z) ¼ eg(z) ln f(x). In general, such functions are multiple-
valued.
10.
Algebraic and Transcendental Functions. If w is a solution of the polynomial equation
P0(z)wn þ P1(z)wn1 þ    þ Pn1(z)w þ Pn(z) ¼ 0
(2:6)
where P0 =0, P1(z), . . . , Pn(z) are polynomials in z and h is a positive integer, then w ¼ f(z) is
called an algebraic function of z.
EXAMPLE 2.3
w ¼ z1=2 is a solution of the equation w2  z ¼ 0 and so is an algebraic function of z.
Any function that cannot be expressed as a solution of (6) is called a transcendental function. The
logarithmic, trigonometric, and hyperbolic functions and their corresponding inverses are examples of
transcendental functions.
The functions considered in 1–9 above, together with functions derived from them by a ﬁnite number of
operations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and roots are called elementary
functions.
2.7
Branch Points and Branch Lines
Suppose that we are given the function w ¼ z1=2. Suppose
further that we allow z to make a complete circuit (counter-
clockwise) around the origin starting from point A [Fig. 2-5].
We have z ¼ reiu, w ¼
ﬃﬃr
p eiu=2 so that at A, u ¼ u1 and
w ¼
ﬃﬃr
p eiu1=2.
After
a
complete
circuit
back
to
A,
u ¼ u1 þ 2p and w ¼
ﬃﬃr
p ei(u1þ2p)=2 ¼ 
ﬃﬃr
p eiu1=2. Thus, we
have not achieved the same value of w with which we
started. However, by making a second complete circuit
back to A, i.e., u ¼ u1 þ 4p, w ¼
ﬃﬃr
p ei(u1þ4p)=2 ¼
ﬃﬃr
p eiu1=2
and we then do obtain the same value of w with which we
started.
We can describe the above by stating that if 0  u , 2p, we are on one branch of the multiple-valued
function z1=2, while if 2p  u , 4p, we are on the other branch of the function.
It is clear that each branch of the function is single-valued. In order to keep the function single-valued,
we set up an artiﬁcial barrier such as OB where B is at inﬁnity [although any other line from O can be used],
A
O
q = q1
B
z plane
Fig. 2-5
CHAPTER 2
Functions, Limits, and Continuity
45

which we agree not to cross. This barrier [drawn heavy in the ﬁgure] is called a branch line or branch cut,
and point O is called a branch point. It should be noted that a circuit around any point other than z ¼ 0 does
not lead to different values; thus, z ¼ 0 is the only ﬁnite branch point.
2.8
Riemann Surfaces
There is another way to achieve the purpose of the branch line described above. To see this, we imagine that
the z plane consists of two sheets superimposed on each other. We now cut the sheets along OB and imagine
that the lower edge of the bottom sheet is joined to the upper edge of the top sheet. Then, starting in the
bottom sheet and making one complete circuit about O, we arrive in the top sheet. We must now
imagine the other cut edges joined together so that, by continuing the circuit, we go from the top sheet
back to the bottom sheet.
The collection of two sheets is called a Riemann surface corresponding to the function z1=2. Each sheet
corresponds to a branch of the function and on each sheet the function is single-valued.
The concept of Riemann surfaces has the advantage that the various values of multiple-valued functions
are obtained in a continuous fashion.
The ideas are easily extended. For example, for the function z1=3 the Riemann surface has 3 sheets; for
ln z, the Riemann surface has inﬁnitely many sheets.
2.9
Limits
Let f(z) be deﬁned and single-valued in a neighborhood of z ¼ z0 with the possible exception of z ¼ z0 itself
(i.e., in a deleted d neighborhood of z0). We say that the number l is the limit of f(z) as z approaches z0
and write limz!z0 f(z) ¼ l if for any positive number e (however small), we can ﬁnd some positive
number d (usually depending on e) such that j f(z)  lj , e whenever 0 , jz  z0j , d.
In such a case, we also say that f(z) approaches l as z approaches z0 and write f(z) ! l as z ! z0. The
limit must be independent of the manner in which z approaches z0.
Geometrically, if z0 is a point in the complex plane, then limz!z0 f(z) ¼ l if the difference in absolute
value between f(z) and l can be made as small as we wish by choosing points z sufﬁciently close to z0
(excluding z ¼ z0 itself).
EXAMPLE 2.4
Let
f(z) ¼
z2
z=i
0
z ¼ i

Then, as z gets closer to i (i.e., z approaches i), f(z) gets closer to i2 ¼ 1. We thus suspect that
limz!i f(z) ¼ 1. To prove this, we must see whether the above deﬁnition of limit is satisﬁed. For this proof, see
Problem 2.23.
Note that limz!i f(z)=f(i), i.e., the limit of f(z) as z ! i is not the same as the value of f(z) at z ¼ i, since
f(i) ¼ 0 by deﬁnition. The limit would, in fact, be 1 even if f(z) were not deﬁned at z ¼ i.
When the limit of a function exists, it is unique, i.e., it is the only one (see Problem 2.26). If f(z) is
multiple-valued, the limit as z ! z0 may depend on the particular branch.

2.11
Inﬁnity
By means of the transformation w ¼ 1=z, the point z ¼ 0 (i.e., the origin) is mapped into w ¼ 1, called the
point at inﬁnity in the w plane. Similarly, we denote by z ¼ 1, the point at inﬁnity in the z plane. To con-
sider the behavior of f(z) at z ¼ 1, it sufﬁces to let z ¼ 1=w and examine the behavior of f(1/w) at w ¼ 0.
We say that limz!1 f(z) ¼ l or f(z) approaches l as z approaches inﬁnity, if for any e . 0, we can ﬁnd
M . 0 such that j f(z)  lj , e whenever jzj . M.
We say that limz!z0 f(z) ¼ 1 or f(z) approaches inﬁnity as z approaches z0, if for any N . 0, we can ﬁnd
d . 0 such that j f(z)j . N whenever 0 , jz  z0j , d.
2.12
Continuity
Let f(z) be deﬁned and single-valued in a neighborhood of z ¼ z0 as well as at z ¼ z0 (i.e., in a d
neighborhood of z0). The function f(z) is said to be continuous at z ¼ z0 if limz!z0 f(z) ¼ f(z0). Note
that this implies three conditions that must be met in order that f(z) be continuous at z ¼ z0:
1.
limz!z0 f(z) ¼ l must exist
2.
f(z0) must exist, i.e., f(z) is deﬁned at z0
3.
l ¼ f(z0)
Equivalently, if f(z) is continuous at z0, we can write this in the suggestive form
lim
z!z0 f(z) ¼ f lim
z!z0 z

:
EXAMPLE 2.5
(a)
Suppose
f(z) ¼
z2
z=i
0
z ¼ i

Then, limz!i f(z) ¼ 1. But f(i) ¼ 0. Hence, limz!i f(z) = f(i) and the function is not continuous at z ¼ i.
(b) Suppose f(z) ¼ z2 for all z. Then limz!i f(z) ¼ f(i) ¼ 1 and f(z) is continuous at z ¼ i.
Points in the z plane where f(z) fails to be continuous are called discontinuities of f(z), and f(z) is said
to be discontinuous at these points. If limz!z0 f(z) exists but is not equal to f(z0), we call z0 a removable
discontinuity since by redeﬁning f(z0) to be the same as limz!z0 f(z), the function becomes continuous.
Alternative to the above deﬁnition of continuity, we can deﬁne f(z) as continuous at z ¼ z0 if for any
e . 0, we can ﬁnd d . 0 such that j f(z)  f(z0)j , e whenever jz  z0j , d. Note that this is simply the
deﬁnition of limit with l ¼ f(z0) and removal of the restriction that z=z0.
To examine the continuity of f(z) at z ¼ 1, we let z ¼ 1=w and examine the continuity of f(1/w) at
w ¼ 0.
Continuity in a Region
A function f(z) is said to be continuous in a region if it is continuous at all points of the region.
CHAPTER 2
Functions, Limits, and Continuity
47

2.13
Theorems on Continuity
THEOREM 2.2.
Given f(z) and g(z) are continuous at z ¼ z0. Then so are the functions f(z) þ g(z),
f(z)  g(z), f(z)g(z) and f(z)=g(z), the last if g(z0)=0. Similar results hold for
continuity in a region.
THEOREM 2.3.
Among the functions continuous in every ﬁnite region are (a) all polynomials, (b) ez,
(c) sin z and cos z.
THEOREM 2.4.
Suppose w ¼ f(z) is continuous at z ¼ z0 and z ¼ g(z ) is continuous at z ¼ z0.
If z0 ¼ g(z0), then the function w ¼ f[g(z)], called a function of a function or
composite function, is continuous at z ¼ z0. This is sometimes brieﬂy stated as:
A continuous function of a continuous function is continuous.
THEOREM 2.5.
Suppose f(z) is continuous in a closed and bounded region. Then it is bounded in the
region; i.e., there exists a constant M such that j f(z)j , M for all points z of the region.
THEOREM 2.6.
If f(z) is continuous in a region, then the real and imaginary parts of f(z) are also
continuous in the region.
2.14
Uniform Continuity
Let f(z) be continuous in a region. Then, by deﬁnition at each point z0 of the region and for any e . 0, we can
ﬁnd d . 0 (which will in general depend on both e and the particular point z0) such that j f(z)  f(z0)j , e
whenever jz  z0j , d. If we can ﬁnd d depending on e but not on the particular point z0, we say that f(z) is
uniformly continuous in the region.
Alternatively, f(z) is uniformly continuous in a region if for any e . 0 we can ﬁnd d . 0 such that
j f(z1)  f(z2)j , e whenever jz1  z2j , d where z1 and z2 are any two points of the region.
THEOREM 2.7.
Let f(z) be continuous in a closed and bounded region. Then it is uniformly continuous
there.
2.15
Sequences
A function of a positive integral variable, designated by f(n) or un, where n ¼ 1, 2, 3, . . . , is called a
sequence. Thus, a sequence is a set of numbers u1, u2, u3, . . . in a deﬁnite order of arrangement and
formed according to a deﬁnite rule. Each number in the sequence is called a term and un is called the
nth term. The sequence u1, u2, u3, . . . is also designated brieﬂy by fung. The sequence is called ﬁnite or
inﬁnite according as there are a ﬁnite number of terms or not. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we shall only
consider inﬁnite sequences.
EXAMPLE 2.6
(a)
The set of numbers i, i2, i3, . . . , i100 is a ﬁnite sequence; the nth term is given by
un ¼ in, n ¼ 1, 2, . . . , 100
(b)
The set of numbers 1 þ i, (1 þ i)2=2!, (1 þ i)2=3!, . . . is an inﬁnite sequence; the nth term is given by
un ¼ (1 þ i)n=n!, n ¼ 1, 2, 3, . . . .
48
CHAPTER 2
Functions, Limits, and Continuity

2.16
Limit of a Sequence
A number l is called the limit of an inﬁnite sequence u1, u2, u3, . . . if for any positive number e we can ﬁnd
a positive number N depending on e such that jun  lj , e for all n . N. In such case, we write
limn!1 un ¼ l. If the limit of a sequence exists, the sequence is called convergent; otherwise it is called
divergent. A sequence can converge to only one limit, i.e., if a limit exists it is unique.
A more intuitive but unrigorous way of expressing this concept of limit is to say that a sequence
u1, u2, u3, . . . has a limit l if the successive terms get “closer and closer” to l. This is often used to
provide a “guess” as to the value of the limit, after which the deﬁnition is applied to see if the guess is
really correct.

Inﬁnite Series
Let u1, u2, u3, . . . be a given sequence.
Form a new sequence S1, S2, S3, . . . deﬁned by
S1 ¼ u1,
S2 ¼ u1 þ u2,
S3 ¼ u1 þ u2 þ u3, . . . ,
Sn ¼ u1 þ u2 þ    þ un
where Sn, called the nth partial sum, is the sum of the ﬁrst n terms of the sequence fung:
The sequence S1, S2, S3, . . . is symbolized by
u1 þ u2 þ u3 þ    ¼
X
1
n¼1
un
which is called an inﬁnite series. If limn!1 Sn ¼ S exists, the series is called convergent and S is its sum;
otherwise the series is called divergent. A necessary condition that a series converges is limn!1 un ¼ 0;
however, this is not sufﬁcient (see Problems 2.40 and 2.150).
Further discussion of inﬁnite series is given in Chapter 6.

or transformation w ¼ z2. Similarly, z ¼ 1  3i [point Q of Fig. 2-6] is mapped into w ¼ 8  6i [point Q0 of
Fig. 2-7]. To each point in the z plane, there corresponds one and only one point (image) in the w plane, so that
w is a single-valued function of z.
2.2. Show that the line joining the points P and Q in the z plane of Problem 2.1 [Fig. 2-6] is mapped by
w ¼ z2 into curve joining points P0Q0 [Fig. 2-7] and determine the equation of this curve.
Solution
Points P and Q have coordinates (2, 1) and (1, 3). Then, the parametric equations of the line joining these
points are given by
x  (2)
1  (2) ¼ y  1
3  1 ¼ t
or
x ¼ 3t  2, y ¼ 1  4t
The equation of the line PQ can be represented by z ¼ 3t  2 þ i(1  4t). The curve in the w plane into which
this line is mapped has the equation
w ¼ z2 ¼ f3t  2 þ i(1  4t)g2 ¼ (3t  2)2  (1  4t)2 þ 2(3t  2)(1  4t)i
¼ 3  4t  7t2 þ (4 þ 22t  24t2)i
Then, since w ¼ u þ iv, the parametric equations of the image curve are given by
u ¼ 3  4t  7t2,
v ¼ 4 þ 22t  24t2
By assigning various values to the parameter t, this curve may be graphed.
2.3. A point P moves in a counterclockwise direction around a circle in the z plane having center at the
origin and radius 1. If the mapping function is w ¼ z3, show that when P makes one complete revo-
lution, the image P0 of P in the w plane makes three complete revolutions in a counterclockwise
direction on a circle having center at the origin and radius 1.

Solution
Let z ¼ reiu. Then, on the circle jzj ¼ 1 [Fig. 2-8], r ¼ 1 and z ¼ eiu. Hence, w ¼ z3 ¼ (eiu)3 ¼ e3iu. Letting
(r, f) denote polar coordinates in the w plane, we have w ¼ reif ¼ e3iu so that r ¼ 1, f ¼ 3u.

Since r ¼ 1, it follows that the image point P0 moves on a circle in the w plane of radius 1 and center at the
origin [Fig. 2-9]. Also, when P moves counterclockwise through an angle u, P0 moves counterclockwise
through an angle 3u. Thus, when P makes one complete revolution, P0 makes three complete revolutions.
In terms of vectors, it means that vector O0P0 is rotating three times as fast as vector OP.
2.4. Suppose c1 and c2 are any real constants. Determine the set of all points in the z plane that map into
the lines (a) u ¼ c1, (b) v ¼ c2 in the w plane by means of the mapping function w ¼ z2. Illustrate by
considering the cases c1 ¼ 2, 4, 2, 4 and c2 ¼ 2, 4, 2, 4.
Solution
We have w ¼ u þ iv ¼ z2 ¼ (x þ iy)2 ¼ x2  y2 þ 2ixy so that u ¼ x2  y2, v ¼ 2xy. Then lines u ¼ c1 and
v ¼ c2 in the w plane correspond, respectively, to hyperbolas x2  y2 ¼ c1 and 2xy ¼ c2 in the z plane as
indicated in Figs. 2-10 and 2-11.

2.5. Referring to Problem 2.4, determine: (a) the image of the region in the ﬁrst quadrant bounded
by x2  y2 ¼ 2, xy ¼ 1, x2  y2 ¼ 4; and xy ¼ 2; (b) the image of the region in the z plane

bounded by all the branches of x2  y2 ¼ 2, xy ¼ 1, x2  y2 ¼ 2, and xy ¼ 1; (c) the
curvilinear coordinates of that point in the xy plane whose rectangular coordinates are (2, 1).
Solution
(a)
The region in the z plane is indicated by the shaded portion PQRS of Fig. 2-10. This region maps into the
required image region P0Q0R0S0 shown shaded in Fig. 2-11. It should be noted that curve PQRSP is tra-
versed in a counterclockwise direction and the image curve P0Q0R0S0P0 is also traversed in a counter-
clockwise direction.
(b)
The region in the z plane is indicated by the shaded portion PTUVWXYZ of Fig. 2-10. This region maps
into the required image region P0T0U0V0 shown shaded in Fig. 2-11.
It is of interest to note that when the boundary of the region PTUVWXYZ is traversed only once, the
boundary of the image region P0T0U0V0 is traversed twice. This is due to the fact that the eight points P
and W, T and X, U and Y, V and Z of the z plane map into the four points P0 or W0, T0 or X0, U0 or Y0, V0 or
Z0, respectively.
However, when the boundary of region PQRS is traversed only once, the boundary of the image region
is also traversed only once. The difference is due to the fact that in traversing the curve PTUVWXYZP, we
are encircling the origin z ¼ 0, whereas when we are traversing the curve PQRSP, we are not encircling
the origin.
(c)
u ¼ x2  y2 ¼ (2)2  (1)2 ¼ 3, v ¼ 2xy ¼ 2(2)(1) ¼ 4. Then the curvilinear coordinates are
u ¼ 3, v ¼ 4.
Multiple-Valued Functions
2.6. Let w5 ¼ z and suppose that corresponding to the particular value z ¼ z1, we have w ¼ w1. (a) If we
start at the point z1 in the z plane [see Fig. 2-12] and make one complete circuit counterclockwise
around the origin, show that the value of w on returning to z1 is w1e2pi=5. (b) What are the values of
w on returning to z1, after 2, 3, . . . complete circuits around the origin? (c) Discuss parts (a) and (b)
if the paths do not enclose the origin.

Solution
(a)
We have z ¼ reiu, so that w ¼ z1=5 ¼ r1=5eiu=5. If r ¼ r1 and u ¼ u1, then w1 ¼ r1=5
1 eiu1=5.
As u increases from u1 to u1 þ 2p, which is what happens when one complete circuit counterclockwise
around the origin is made, we ﬁnd
w ¼ r1=5
1 ei(u1þ2p)=5 ¼ r1=5
1 eiu1=5e2pi=5 ¼ w1e2pi=5
(b)
After two complete circuits around the origin, we ﬁnd
w ¼ r1=5
1 ei(u1þ4p)=5 ¼ r1=5
1 eiu1=5e4pi=5 ¼ w1e4pi=5
52
CHAPTER 2
Functions, Limits, and Continuity

Similarly, after three and four complete circuits around the origin, we ﬁnd
w ¼ w1e6pi=5
and
w ¼ w1e8pi=5
After ﬁve complete circuits, the value of w is w1e10pi=5 ¼ w1, so that the original value of w is obtained
after ﬁve revolutions about the origin. Thereafter, the cycle is repeated [see Fig. 2-13].
Another Method. Since w5 ¼ z, we have arg z ¼ 5 arg w from which
Change in arg w ¼ 1
5(Change in arg z)
Then, if arg z increases by 2p, 4p, 6p, 8p, 10p, . . . , arg w increases by 2p=5, 4p=5, 6p=5,
8p=5, 2p, . . . leading to the same results obtained in (a) and (b).
(c)
If the path does not enclose the origin, then the increase in arg z is zero and so the increase in arg w is also
zero. In this case, the value of w is w1, regardless of the number of circuits made.
2.7. (a) In the preceding problem, explain why we can consider w as a collection of ﬁve single-valued
functions of z.
(b) Explain geometrically the relationship between these single-valued functions.
(c) Show geometrically how we can restrict ourselves to a particular single-valued function.
Solution
(a)
Since w5 ¼ z ¼ reiu ¼ rei(uþ2kp) where k is an integer, we have
w ¼ r1=5ei(uþ2kp)=5 ¼ r1=5fcos(u þ 2kp)=5 þ i sin(u þ 2kp)=5g
and so w is a ﬁve-valued function of z, the ﬁve values being given by k ¼ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
Equivalently, we can consider w as a collection of ﬁve single-valued functions, called branches of the
multiple-valued function, by properly restricting u. Thus, for example, we can write
w ¼ r1=5(cos u=5 þ i sin u=5)
where we take the ﬁve possible intervals for u given by 0  u , 2p, 2p  u , 4p, . . . , 8p  u , 10p, all
other such intervals producing repetitions of these.
The ﬁrst interval, 0  u , 2p, is sometimes called the principal range of u and corresponds to the
principal branch of the multiple-valued function.
Other intervals for u of length 2p can also be taken; for example, p  u , p, p  u , 3p, etc., the ﬁrst
of these being taken as the principal range.
(b)
We start with the (principal) branch
w ¼ r1=5 cos u=5 þ i sin u=5
ð
Þ
where 0  u , 2p:
After one complete circuit about the origin in the z plane, u increases by 2p to give another branch of
the function. After another complete circuit about the origin, still another branch of the function is
obtained until all ﬁve branches have been found, after which we return to the original (principal) branch.
Because different values of f(z) are obtained by successively encircling z ¼ 0, we call z ¼ 0 a branch
point.
(c)
We can restrict ourselves to a particular single-valued function, usually the principal branch, by
insuring that not more than one complete circuit about the branch point is made, i.e., by suitably
restricting u.
In the case of the principal range 0  u , 2p, this is accomplished by constructing a cut, indicated by
OA in Fig. 2-14, called a branch out or branch line, on the positive real axis, the purpose being that we do
not allow ourselves to cross this cut (if we do cross the cut, another branch of the function is obtained).
If another interval for u is chosen, the branch line or cut is taken to be some other line in the z plane
emanating from the branch point.

Hence, 2iz ¼ 2kpi and z ¼ kp, i:e:, z ¼ 0, +p, +2p, +3p, . . . are the zeros.

f(z) ¼ f(z) are called even functions. Thus sin z and tan z are odd functions, while cos z is an even
function.

2.13. (a) Suppose z ¼ ew where z ¼ r(cos u þ i sin u) and w ¼ u þ iv. Show that u ¼ ln r and
v ¼ u þ 2kp, k ¼ 0, +1, +2, . . . so that w ¼ ln z ¼ ln r þ i(u þ 2kp). (b) Determine the values
of ln(1  i). What is the principal value?
Solution
(a)
Since z ¼ r(cos u þ i sin u) ¼ ew ¼ euþiv ¼ eu(cos v þ i sin v), we have on equating real and imaginary
parts,
eu cos v ¼ r cos u
(1)
eu sin v ¼ r sin u
(2)
Squaring (1) and (2) and adding, we ﬁnd e2u ¼ r2 or eu ¼ r and u ¼ ln r. Then, from (1) and (2),
r cos v ¼ r cos u, r sin v ¼ r sin u from which v ¼ u þ 2kp. Hence, w ¼ u þ iv ¼ ln r þ i(u þ 2kp).
If z ¼ ew, we say that w ¼ ln z. We thus see that ln z ¼ ln r þ i(u þ 2kp). An equivalent way of saying
the same thing is to write ln z ¼ ln r þ iu where u can assume inﬁnitely many values which differ by 2p.
Note that formally ln z ¼ ln(reiu) ¼ ln r þ iu using laws of real logarithms familiar from elementary
mathematics.

2.14. Prove that f(z) ¼ ln z has a branch point at z ¼ 0.
Solution
We have ln z ¼ ln r þ iu. Suppose that we start at some point z1=0 in the complex plane for which
r ¼ r1, u ¼ u1 so that ln z1 ¼ ln r1 þ iu1 [see Fig. 2-16]. Then, after making one complete circuit about the
origin in the positive or counterclockwise direction, we ﬁnd on returning to z1 that r ¼ r1, u ¼ u1 þ 2p so
that ln z1 ¼ ln r1 þ i(u1 þ 2p). Thus, we are on another branch of the function, and so z ¼ 0 is a branch point.

CHAPTER 2
Functions, Limits, and Continuity

Further complete circuits about the origin lead to other branches and (unlike the case of functions such as
z1=2 or z1=5), we never return to the same branch.
It follows that ln z is an inﬁnitely many-valued function of z with inﬁnitely many branches. That particular
branch of ln z which is real when z is real and positive is called the principal branch. To obtain this branch,
we require that u ¼ 0 when z . 0. To accomplish this, we can take ln z ¼ ln r þ iu where u is chosen so that
0  u , 2p or p  u , p, etc.
As a generalization, we note that ln(z  a) has a branch point at z ¼ a.
2.15. Consider the transformation w ¼ ln z. Show that (a) circles with center at the origin in the z plane
are mapped into lines parallel to the v axis in the w plane, (b) lines or rays emanating from the origin
in the z plane are mapped into lines parallel to the u axis in the w plane, (c) the z plane is mapped
into a strip of width 2p in the w plane. Illustrate the results graphically.
Solution
We have w ¼ u þ iv ¼ ln z ¼ ln r þ iu so that u ¼ ln r, v ¼ u.
Choose the principal branch as w ¼ ln r þ iu where 0  u , 2p.
(a)
Circles with center at the origin and radius a have the equation jzj ¼ r ¼ a. These are mapped into lines
in the w plane whose equations are u ¼ ln a. In Figs. 2-17 and 2-18, the circles and lines corresponding

These are mapped into lines in the w plane (dashed in Fig. 2-18) whose equations are v ¼ a. We have
shown the corresponding lines for a ¼ 0, p=6, p=3, and p=2.
(c)
Corresponding to any given point P in the z plane deﬁned by z=0 and having polar coordinates (r, u)
where 0  u , 2p, r > 0 [as in Fig. 2-19], there is a point P0 in the strip of width 2p shown shaded
in Fig. 2-20. Thus, the z plane is mapped into this strip. The point z ¼ 0 is mapped into a point of this
strip sometimes called the point at inﬁnity.
If u is such that 2p  u , 4p, the z plane is mapped into the strip 2p  v , 4p of Fig. 2-20.
Similarly, we obtain the other strips shown in Fig. 2-20.

If w ¼ tanh1 z, then z ¼ tanh w ¼ sinh w

The principal branch is the one for which k ¼ 0 and leads to the required result.
2.18. (a) Suppose z ¼ reiu. Prove that zi ¼ e(uþ2kp)fcos(ln r) þ i sin(ln r)g where k ¼ 0, +1, +2, . . . :
(b) Suppose z is a point on the unit circle with center at the origin. Prove that zi represents inﬁnitely
many real numbers and determine the principal value.
(c) Find the principal value of ii.
Solution
(a)
By deﬁnition,
zi ¼ ei ln z ¼ eifln rþi(uþ2kp)g
¼ ei ln r(uþ2kp) ¼ e(uþ2kp)fcos(ln r) þ i sin(ln r)g
The principal branch of the many-valued function f(z) ¼ zi is obtained by taking k ¼ 0 and is given by
eufcos(ln r) þ i sin(ln r)g where we can choose u such that 0  u , 2p.
(b)
If z is any point on the unit circle with center at the origin, then jzj ¼ r ¼ 1. Hence, by part (a), since
ln r ¼ 0, we have zi ¼ e(uþ2kp) which represents inﬁnitely many real numbers. The principal value
is eu where we choose u such that 0  u , 2p.
(c)
By deﬁnition, ii ¼ ei ln i ¼ eifi(p=2þ2kp)g ¼ e(p=2þ2kp) since i ¼ ei(p=2þ2kp) and ln i ¼ i(p=2 þ 2kp).
The principal value is given by ep=2.
Another Method. By part (b), since z ¼ i lies on the unit circle with center at the origin and since
u ¼ p=2, the principal value is ep=2.
Branch Points, Branch Lines, Riemann Surfaces
2.19. Let w ¼ f(z) ¼ (z2 þ 1)1=2. (a) Show that z ¼+i are branch points of f(z). (b) Show that a complete
circuit around both branch points produces no change in the branches of f(z).
Solution
(a)
We have w ¼ (z2 þ 1)1=2 ¼ f(z  i)(z þ i)g1=2. Then, arg w ¼ 1
2 arg(z  i) þ 1
2 arg(z þ i) so that
Change in arg w ¼ 1
2fChange in arg(z  i)g þ 1
2fChange in arg(z þ i)g
Let C [Fig. 2-21] be a closed curve enclosing the point i but not the point i. Then, as point z goes once
counterclockwise around C,
Change in arg(z  i) ¼ 2p,
Change in arg(z þ i) ¼ 0
so that
Change in arg w ¼ p
Hence, w does not return to its original value, i.e., a change in branches has occurred. Since a complete
circuit about z ¼ i alters the branches of the function, z ¼ i is a branch point. Similarly, if C is a closed
curve enclosing the point i but not i, we can show that z ¼ i is a branch point.
Another Method.
Let z  i ¼ r1eiu1, z þ i ¼ r2eiu2. Then
w ¼ fr1r2ei(u1þu2)g1=2 ¼

If C encloses both branch points z ¼ +i as in Fig. 2-22, then as point z goes counterclockwise around C,
Change in arg(z  i) ¼ 2p
Change in arg(z þ i) ¼ 2p
so that
Change in arg w ¼ 2p
Hence a complete circuit around both branch points produces no change in the branches.
Another Method.
In this case, referring to the second method of part (a), u1 increases from a1 to a1 þ 2p while u2 increases

2.20. Determine branch lines for the function of Problem 2.19.
Solution
The branch lines can be taken as those indicated with a heavy line in either of Figs. 2-23 or 2-24. In both cases,
by not crossing these heavy lines, we ensure the single-valuedness of the function.

2.21. Discuss the Riemann surface for the function of Problem 2.19.
Solution
We can have different Riemann surfaces corresponding to Figs. 2-23 or 2-24 of Problem 2.20. Referring to
Fig. 2-23, for example, we imagine that the z plane consists of two sheets superimposed on each other and
cut along the branch line. Opposite edges of the cut are then joined, forming the Riemann surface. On
making one complete circuit around z ¼ i, we start on one branch and wind up on the other. However, if
we make one circuit about both z ¼ i and z ¼ i, we do not change branches at all. This agrees with the
results of Problem 2.19.
2.22
Discuss the Riemann surface for the function f(z) ¼ ln z [see Problem 2.14].
Solution
In this case, we imagine the z plane to consist of inﬁnitely many sheets superimposed on each other and cut
along a branch line emanating from the origin z ¼ 0. We then connect each cut edge to the opposite cut edge of
an adjacent sheet. Then, every time we make a circuit about z ¼ 0, we are on another sheet corresponding
to a different branch of the function. The collection of sheets is the Riemann surface. In this case, unlike
Problems 2.6 and 2.7, successive circuits never bring us back to the original branch.
Limits

0.
(b) Find limz!z0 f(z) if f(z) ¼

z ¼ z0

.
Solution
(a)
We must show that, given any e . 0, we can ﬁnd d (depending in general on e) such that jz2  z2
0j , e
whenever 0 , jz  z0j , d.
If d  1, then 0 , jz  z0j , d implies that
jz2  z2
0j ¼ jz  z0jjz þ z0j , djz  z0 þ 2z0j , dfjz  z0j þ j2z0jg , d(1 þ 2jz0j)
Take d as 1 or e=(1 þ 2jz0j), whichever is smaller. Then, we have jz2  z2
0j , e whenever jz  z0j , d,
and the required result is proved.
(b)
There is no difference between this problem and that in part (a), since in both cases we exclude z ¼ z0
from consideration. Hence, limz!z0 f(z) ¼ z2
0. Note that the limit of f(z) as z ! z0 has nothing whatso-
ever to do with the value of f(z) at z0.
2.24. Interpret Problem 2.23 geometrically.
Solution
(a) The equation w ¼ f(z) ¼ z2 deﬁnes a transformation or mapping of points of the z plane into points of the
w plane. In particular, let us suppose that point z0 is mapped into w0 ¼ z2
0. [See Fig. 2-25 and 2-26.]

In Problem 2.23(a), we prove that given any e . 0 we can ﬁnd d . 0 such that jw  w0j , e whenever
jz  z0j , d. Geometrically, this means that if we wish w to be inside a circle of radius e [see Fig. 2-26]
we must choose d (depending on e) so that z lies inside a circle of radius d [see Fig. 2-25]. According to
Problem 2.23(a), this is certainly accomplished if d is the smaller of 1 and e=(1 þ 2jz0j).
(b) In Problem 2.23(a), w ¼ w0 ¼ z2
0 is the image of z ¼ z0. However, in Problem 2.23(b), w ¼ 0 is the image
of z ¼ z0. Except for this, the geometric interpretation is identical with that given in part (a).
2.25. Prove that lim
z!i
3z4  2z3 þ 8z2  2z þ 5
z  i

Solution
We must show that for any e . 0, we can ﬁnd d . 0 such that

z  i
¼ 3z3  (2  3i)z2 þ (5  2i)z þ 5i
on cancelling the common factor z  i=0.
Then, we must show that for any e . 0, we can ﬁnd d . 0 such that
j3z3  (2  3i)z2 þ (5  2i)z  4 þ ij , e
when 0 , jz  ij , d
If d  1, then 0 , jz  ij , d implies

Taking d as the smaller of 1 and e=28, the required result follows.
Theorems on Limits
2.26. Suppose limz!z0 f(z) exists. Prove that it must be unique.
Solution
We must show that if limz!z0 f(z) ¼ l1 and limz!z0 f(z) ¼ l2, then l1 ¼ l2.
By hypothesis, given any e . 0, we can ﬁnd d . 0 such that
j f(z)  l1j , e=2
when 0 , jz  z0j , d
j f(z)  l2j , e=2
when 0 , jz  z0j , d
Then
jl1  l2j ¼ jl1  f(z) þ f(z)  l2j  jl1  f(z)j þ j f(z)  l2j , e=2 þ e=2 ¼ e
i.e., jl1  l2j is less than any positive number e (however small) and so must be zero. Thus l1 ¼ l2.

Since limz!z0 g(z) ¼ B, we can ﬁnd d such that jg(z)  Bj , 1

(b) limz!z0 f(z)g(z) ¼ AB,
(d) limz!z0 f(z)=g(z) ¼ A=B if B=0.
Solution
(a)
We must show that for any e . 0, we can ﬁnd d . 0 such that
j[ f(z) þ g(z)]  (A þ B)j , e

We have
j[ f(z) þ g(z)]  (A þ B)j ¼ j[ f(z)  A] þ [g(z)  B]j  j f(z)  Aj þ jg(z)  Bj

(2)
jg(z)  Bj , e=2
when 0 , jz  z0j , d2

Then, from (1), (2), and (3),
j[ f(z) þ g(z)]  (A þ B)j , e=2 þ e=2 ¼ e
when 0 , jz  z0j , d
where d is chosen as the smaller of d1 and d2.

Since limz!z0 f(z) ¼ A, we can ﬁnd d1 such that j f(z)  Aj , 1 for 0 , jz  z0j , d1. Hence, by
inequalities 4, page 3, Section 1.5.
jf(z)  Aj  j f(z)j  jAj,

or

Since limz!z0 g(z) ¼ B, given e . 0, we can ﬁnd d2 . 0 such that jg(z)  Bj , e=2P for
0 , jz  z0j , d2.
Since limz!z0 f(z) ¼ A, given e . 0, we can ﬁnd d3 . 0 such that j f(z)  Aj , e=2(jBj þ 1) for

result would come out to be j f(z) þ g(z)  (A þ B)j , e. Of course, the proof would be just as valid if we had
used 2e [or any other positive multiple of e] in place of e. Similar remarks hold for the proofs of (b), (c),

In this case, the limits of the numerator and denominator are each zero and the theorems on limits fail

CHAPTER 2
Functions, Limits, and Continuity

2.30. Prove that limz!0 (z=z) does not exist.
Solution
If the limit is to exist, it must be independent of the manner in which z approaches the point 0.
Let z ! 0 along the x axis. Then y ¼ 0, and z ¼ x þ iy ¼ x and z ¼ x  iy ¼ x, so that the required limit is
lim
x !0

x ¼ 1
Let z ! 0 along the y axis. Then x ¼ 0, and z ¼ x þ iy ¼ iy and z ¼ x  iy ¼ iy, so that the required
limit is
lim
y!0
iy
iy ¼ 1
Since the two approaches do not give the same answer, the limit does not exist.
Continuity
2.31. (a) Prove that f(z) ¼ z2 is continuous at z ¼ z0.
(b) Prove that f(z) ¼
z2
z=z0
0
z ¼ z0

, where z0 =0, is discontinuous at z ¼ z0.
Solution
(a)
By Problem 2.23(a), limz!z0 f(z) ¼ f(z0) ¼ z2
0 and so f(z) is continuous at z ¼ z0.
Another Method. We must show that given any e . 0, we can ﬁnd d . 0 (depending on e) such that
j f(z)  f(z0)j ¼ jz2  z2
0j , e when jz  z0j , d. The proof patterns that given in Problem 2.23(a).
(b)
By Problem 2.23(b), limz!z0 f(z) ¼ z2
0, but f(z0) ¼ 0. Hence, limz!z0 f(z) = f(z0) and so f(z) is discon-
tinuous at z ¼ z0 if z0 = 0.
If z0 ¼ 0, then f(z) ¼ 0; and since limz!z0 f(z) ¼ 0 ¼ f(0), we see that the function is continuous.
2.32. Is the function f(z) ¼ 3z4  2z3 þ 8z2  2z þ 5
z  i
continuous at z ¼ i?
Solution
f(i) does not exist, i.e., f(x) is not deﬁned at z ¼ i. Thus f(z) is not continuous at z ¼ i.
By redeﬁning f(z) so that f(i) ¼ limz!i f(z) ¼ 4 þ 4i (see Problem 2.25), it becomes continuous at z ¼ i. In
such a case, we call z ¼ i a removable discontinuity.
2.33. Prove that if f(z) and g(z) are continuous at z ¼ z0, so also are
(a)
f(z) þ g(z),
(b)
f(z)g(z),
(c)
f(z)
g(z) if g(z0)=0
Solution
These results follow at once from Problem 2.28 by taking A ¼ f(z0), B ¼ g(z0) and rewriting 0 , jz  z0j , d
as jz  z0j , d, i.e., including z ¼ z0.
2.34. Prove that f(z) ¼ z2 is continuous in the region jzj  1.
Solution
Let z0 be any point in the region jzj  1. By Problem 2.23(a), f(z) is continuous at z0. Thus, f(z) is continuous
in the region since it is continuous at any point of the region.
CHAPTER 2
Functions, Limits, and Continuity
65

2.35. For what values of z are each of the following functions continuous?
Solution
(a) f(z) ¼ z=(z2 þ 1) ¼ z=(z  i)(z þ i). Since the denominator is zero when z ¼+i, the function is continu-
ous everywhere except z ¼+i.
(b) f(z) ¼ csc z ¼ 1=sin z. By Problem 2.10(a), sin z ¼ 0 for z ¼ 0, +p, +2p, . . . . Hence, f(z) is continuous
everywhere except at these points.
Uniform Continuity
2.36. Prove that f(z) ¼ z2 is uniformly continuous in the region jzj , 1.
Solution
We must show that given any e . 0, we can ﬁnd d . 0 such that jz2  z2
0j , e when jz  z0j , d, where d
depends only on e and not on the particular point z0 of the region.
If z and z0 are any points in jzj , 1, then
jz2  z2
0j ¼ jz þ z0jjz  z0j  fjzj þ jz0jgjz  z0j , 2jz  z0j
Thus, if jz  z0j , d, it follows that jz2  z2
0j , 2d. Choosing d ¼ e=2, we see that jz2  z2
0j , e when
jz  z0j , d, where d depends only on e and not on z0. Hence, f(z) ¼ z2 is uniformly continuous in the region.
2.37. Prove that f(z) ¼ 1=z is not uniformly continuous in the region jzj , 1.
Solution
Method 1.
Suppose that f(z) is uniformly continuous in the region. Then, for any e . 0, we should be able to ﬁnd d,
say between 0 and 1, such that j f(z)  f(z0)j , e when jz  z0j , d for all z and z0 in the region.

Thus, we have a contradiction, and it follows that f(z) ¼ 1=z cannot be uniformly continuous in the region.
Method 2.
Let z0 and z0 þ z be any two points of the region such that jz0 þ z  z0j ¼ jzj ¼ d. Then

can be made larger than any positive number by choosing z0 sufﬁciently close to 0. Hence, the function cannot
be uniformly continuous in the region.
Sequences and Series

(b)

4 , i5

2 , i
3 , 1
4 , i
5 , . . . : On plotting the
corresponding points in the z plane, we suspect that the limit is zero. To prove this, we must show that
jun  lj ¼ jin=n  0j , e

CHAPTER 2
Functions, Limits, and Continuity

Now
jin=n  0j ¼ jin=nj ¼ jijn=n ¼ 1=n , e
when n > 1=e
Let us choose N ¼ 1=e. Then we see that (1) is true, and so the sequence converges to zero.

ju11j . 1:2ju10j, ju12j . 1:2ju11j . (1:2)2ju10j, and in general junj . (1:2)n10ju10j. It follows that junj
can be made larger than any preassigned positive number (no matter how large) and thus the limit of
junj cannot exist, and consequently the limit of un cannot exist. Thus, the sequence diverges.
2.39. Given limn!1 an ¼ A and limn!1 bn ¼ B. Prove that limn!1 (an þ bn) ¼ A þ B.
Solution
By deﬁnition, given e we can ﬁnd N such that
jan  Aj , e=2, jbn  Bj , e=2 for n > N
Then for n . N,
j(an þ bn)  (A þ B)j ¼ j(an  A) þ (bn  B)j  jan  Aj þ jbn  Bj , e
which proves the result.
It is seen that this parallels the proof for limits of functions [Problem 2.28].
2.40. Prove that if a series u1 þ u2 þ u3 þ    is to converge, we must have limn!1 un ¼ 0.
Solution
If Sn is the sum of the ﬁrst n terms of the series, then Snþ1 ¼ Sn þ un. Hence, if limn!1 Sn exists and equals S,
we have limn!1 Snþ1 ¼ limn!1 Sn þ limn!1 un or S ¼ S þ limn!1 un, i.e., limn!1 un ¼ 0.
Conversely, however, if limn!1 un ¼ 0, the series may or may not converge. See Problem 2.150.
2.41. Prove that 1 þ z þ z2 þ z3 þ    ¼ 1=(1  z) if jzj , 1.
Solution
Let
Sn ¼ 1 þ z þ z2 þ    þ zn1
Then
zSn ¼
z þ z2 þ    þ zn1 þ zn
Subtracting,
(1  z)Sn ¼ 1  zn
or
Sn ¼ 1  zn
1  z
If jzj , 1, then we suspect that limn!1 zn ¼ 0. To prove this, we must show that given any e . 0, we can ﬁnd
N such that jzn  0j , e for all n . N. The result is certainly true if z ¼ 0; hence, we can consider z=0.
Now jznj ¼ jzjn , e when n ln jzj , ln e or n . (ln e)=(ln jzj) ¼ N [since if jzj , 1, ln jzj is negative]. We
have therefore found the required N and limn!1 zn ¼ 0. Thus
1 þ z þ z2 þ    ¼ lim
n!1 Sn ¼ lim

and r2 ¼ 1, u2 ¼ p=2. Since w ¼ 1 at z ¼ 0, we have from (3), 1 ¼ e(kþ1)pi and we choose k ¼ 1

Solution
Since the points in the z plane are equally spaced, we are led, because of Problem 2.15, to consider a logar-
ithmic function of the type z ¼ ln w.
Now, if w ¼ 1 ¼ e2kpi, k ¼ 0, +1, +2, . . . , then z ¼ ln w ¼ 2kpi so that the point w ¼ 1 is mapped into
the points 0, +2pi, +4pi, . . . .
If, however, we consider z ¼ (ln w)=2p, the point w ¼ 1 is mapped into z ¼ 0, +i, +2i, . . . as required.
Conversely, by means of this mapping function, the points z ¼ 0, +i, +2i, . . . are mapped into the point
w ¼ 1.
Then, a suitable mapping function is z ¼ (ln w)=2p or w ¼ e2pz.

C H A P T E R 3
Complex Differentiation and
the Cauchy–Riemann Equations
3.1
Derivatives
If f(z) is single-valued in some region R of the z plane, the derivative of f(z) is deﬁned as
f 0(z) ¼ lim
Dz!0
f z þ Dz
ð
Þ  f zð Þ
Dz
(3:1)
provided that the limit exists independent of the manner in which Dz ! 0. In such a case, we say that f(z) is
differentiable at z. In the deﬁnition (3.1), we sometimes use h instead of Dz. Although differentiability
implies continuity, the reverse is not true (see Problem 3.4).
3.2
Analytic Functions
If the derivative f 0(z) exists at all points z of a region R, then f(z) is said to be analytic in R and is referred to
as an analytic function in R or a function analytic in R. The terms regular and holomorphic are sometimes
used as synonyms for analytic.
A function f(z) is said to be analytic at a point z0 if there exists a neighborhood jz  z0j , d at all points
of which f 0(z) exists.
3.3
Cauchy–Riemann Equations
A necessary condition that w ¼ f(z) ¼ u(x, y) þ iv(x, y) be analytic in a region R is that, in R, u and v
satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations
@u
@x ¼ @v
@y ,
@u
@y ¼  @v
@x
(3:2)
If the partial derivatives in (3.2) are continuous in R, then the Cauchy–Riemann equations are sufﬁcient
conditions that f(z) be analytic in R. See Problem 3.5.
The functions u(x, y) and v(x, y) are sometimes called conjugate functions. Given u having continuous
ﬁrst partials on a simply connected region R (see Section 4.6), we can ﬁnd v (within an arbitrary additive
constant) so that u þ iv ¼ f(z) is analytic (see Problems 3.7 and 3.8).
77

3.4
Harmonic Functions
If the second partial derivatives of u and v with respect to x and y exist and are continuous in a region R,
then we ﬁnd from (3.2) that (see Problem 3.6)
@2u
@x2 þ @2u
@y2 ¼ 0,
@2v
@x2 þ @2v
@y2 ¼ 0
(3:3)
It follows that under these conditions, the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function satisfy Laplace’s
equation denoted by
@2C
@2x þ @2C
@2y ¼ 0
or
r2C ¼ 0
where r2 ; @2
@x2 þ @2
@y2
(3:4)
The operator r2 is often called the Laplacian.
Functions such as u(x, y) and v(x, y) which satisfy Laplace’s equation in a region R are called harmonic
functions and are said to be harmonic in R.
3.5
Geometric Interpretation of the Derivative
Let z0 [Fig. 3-1] be a point P in the z plane and let w0 [Fig. 3-2] be its image P0 in the w plane under the
transformation w ¼ f(z). Since we suppose that f(z) is single-valued, the point z0 maps into only one
point w0.

Fig. 3-2
If we give z0 an increment Dz, we obtain the point Q of Fig. 3-1. This point has image Q0 in the w plane.
Thus, from Fig. 3-2, we see that P0Q0 represents the complex number Dw ¼ f(z0 þ Dz)  f(z0). It follows
that the derivative at z0 (if it exists) is given by
lim
Dz!0
f z0 þ Dz
ð
Þ  f z0
ð Þ
Dz
¼ lim
Q!P

(3:5)
that is, the limit of the ratio P0Q0 to PQ as point Q approaches point P. The above interpretation clearly holds
when z0 is replaced by any point z.
78
CHAPTER 3
Complex Differentiation

3.6
Differentials
Let Dz ¼ dz be an increment given to z. Then
Dw ¼ f(z þ Dz)  f(z)
(3:6)
is called the increment in w ¼ f(z). If f(z) is continuous and has a continuous ﬁrst derivative in a region, then
Dw ¼ f 0(z)Dz þ eDz ¼ f 0(z) dz þ e dz
(3:7)
where e ! 0 as Dz ! 0. The expression
dw ¼ f 0(z) dz
(3:8)
is called the differential of w or f(z), or the principal part of Dw. Note that Dw=dw in general. We call dz
the differential of z.
Because of the deﬁnitions (3.1) and (3.8), we often write
dw
dz ¼ f 0(z) ¼ lim
Dx!0
f z þ Dz
ð
Þ  f zð Þ
Dz
¼ lim
Dz!0
Dw
Dz
(3:9)
It is emphasized that dz and dw are not the limits of Dz and Dw as Dz ! 0, since these limits are zero
whereas dz and dw are not necessarily zero. Instead, given dz, we determine dw from (3.8), i.e., dw is a
dependent variable determined from the independent variable dz for a given z.
It is useful to think of d/dz as being an operator
that, when operating on w ¼ f(z), leads to
dw=dz ¼ f 0(z).
3.7
Rules for Differentiation
Suppose f(z), g(z), and h(z) are analytic functions of z. Then the following differentiation rules (identical
with those of elementary calculus) are valid.
1.
d
dz f f(z) þ g(z)g ¼ d
dz f(z) þ d
dz g(z) ¼ f 0(z) þ g0(z)

dz g(z) ¼ f 0(z)  g0(z)

dz f(z) ¼ cf 0(z) where c is any constant

dw
dz ¼ dw
dz  dz
dz ¼ f 0(z ) dz
dz ¼ f 0fg(z)gg0(z)
(3:10)
Similarly, if w ¼ f(z ) where z ¼ g(h) and h ¼ h(z), then
dw
dz ¼ dw
dz  dz
dh  dh
dz
(3:11)
The results (3.10) and (3.11) are often called chain rules for differentiation of composite functions.
7.
If w ¼ f(z) has a single-valued inverse f 1, then z ¼ f 1(w), and dw/dz and dz/dw are related by
dw
dz ¼

dz=dw
(3:12)

8.
If z ¼ f(t) and w ¼ g(t) where t is a parameter, then
dw
dz ¼ dw=dt
dz=dt ¼ g0 tð Þ
f 0 tð Þ
(3:13)
Similar rules can be formulated for differentials. For example,
df f(z) þ g(z)g ¼ df(z) þ dg(z) ¼ f 0(z) dz þ g0(z) dz ¼ f f 0(z) þ g0(z)g dz
df f(z)g(z)g ¼ f(z) dg(z) þ g(z) df(z) ¼ f f(z)g0(z) þ g(z) f 0(z)g dz

Derivatives of Elementary Functions
In the following, we assume that the functions are deﬁned as in Chapter 2. In the cases where functions have
branches, i.e., are multi-valued, the branch of the function on the right is chosen so as to correspond to the
branch of the function on the left. Note that the results are identical with those of elementary calculus.

CHAPTER 3
Complex Differentiation

3.9
Higher Order Derivatives
If w ¼ f(z) is analytic in a region, its derivative is given by f 0(z), w0, or dw/dz. If f 0(z) is also analytic in the
region, its derivative is denoted by f 00(z), w00, or d=dz
ð
Þ dw=dz
ð
Þ ¼ d2w=dz2. Similarly, the nth derivative of
f(z), if it exists, is denoted by f (n)(z), w(n), or dnw=dzn where n is called the order of the derivative. Thus
derivatives of ﬁrst, second, third, . . . orders are given by f 0(z), f 00(z), f 000(z), . . . . Computations of these
higher order derivatives follow by repeated application of the above differentiation rules.
One of the most remarkable theorems valid for functions of a complex variable and not necessarily valid
for functions of a real variable is the following:
THEOREM 3.1.
Suppose f(z) is analytic in a region R. Then so also are f 0(z), f 00(z), . . . analytic in R, i.e.,
all higher derivatives exist in R.
This important theorem is proved in Chapter 5.
3.10
L’Hospital’s Rule
Let f(z) and g(z) be analytic in a region containing the point z0 and suppose that f(z0) ¼ g(z0) ¼ 0 but
g0(z0)=0. Then, L’Hospital’s rule states that
lim
z!z0
f zð Þ
g zð Þ ¼ f 0 z0
ð Þ
g0 z0
ð Þ
(3:14)
In the case of f 0(z0) ¼ g0(z0) ¼ 0, the rule may be extended. See Problems 3.21–3.24.
We sometimes say that the left side of (3.14) has the “indeterminate form” 0/0, although such terminol-
ogy is somewhat misleading since there is usually nothing indeterminate involved. Limits represented by
so-called indeterminate forms 1=1, 0  1, 18, 08, 11, and 1  1 can often be evaluated by appropriate
modiﬁcations of L’Hospital’s rule.
3.11
Singular Points
A point at which f(z) fails to be analytic is called a singular point or singularity of f(z). Various types of
singularities exist.
1.
Isolated Singularities. The point z ¼ z0 is called an isolated singularity or isolated singular point
of f(z) if we can ﬁnd d . 0 such that the circle jz  z0j ¼ d encloses no singular point other than
z0 (i.e., there exists a deleted d neighborhood of z0 containing no singularity). If no such d can be
found, we call z0 a non-isolated singularity.
If z0 is not a singular point and we can ﬁnd d . 0 such that jz  z0j ¼ d encloses no singular
point, then we call z0 an ordinary point of f(z).
2.
Poles. If z0 is an isolated singularity and we can ﬁnd a positive integer n such that
limz!z0 (z  z0)nf(z) ¼ A=0, then z ¼ z0 is called a pole of order n. If n ¼ 1, z0 is called a
simple pole.
EXAMPLE 3.1
(a)
f(z) ¼ 1= z  2
ð
Þ3 has a pole of order 3 at z ¼ 2.
(b)
f(z) ¼ (3z  2)= z  1
ð
Þ2 z þ 1
ð
Þ z  4
ð
Þ has a pole of order 2 at z ¼ 1, and simple poles at z ¼ 1
and z ¼ 4.
If g(z) ¼ (z  z0)nf(z), where f(z0)=0 and n is a positive integer, then z ¼ z0 is called a zero of
order n of g(z). If n ¼ 1, z0 is called a simple zero. In such a case, z0 is a pole of order n of the
function 1/g(z).
3.
Branch Points of multiple-valued functions, already considered in Chapter 2, are non-isolated
singular points since a multiple-valued function is not continuous and, therefore, not analytic
in a deleted neighborhood of a branch point.
CHAPTER 3
Complex Differentiation
81

EXAMPLE 3.2
(a)
f(z) ¼ (z  3)1=2 has a branch point at z ¼ 3.
(b)
f(z) ¼ ln(z2 þ z  2) has branch points where z2 þ z  2 ¼ 0, i.e., at z ¼ 1 and z ¼ 2.
4.
Removable Singularities. An isolated singular point z0 is called a removable singularity of f(z) if
limz!z0 f(z) exists. By deﬁning f(z0) ¼ limz!z0 f(z), it can then be shown that f(z) is not only con-
tinuous at z0 but is also analytic at z0.
EXAMPLE 3.3
Thesingularpointz ¼ 0 isaremovablesingularityoff(z) ¼ sin z=z sincelimz!0 (sin z=z) ¼ 1.
5.
Essential Singularities. An isolated singularity that is not a pole or removable singularity is
called an essential singularity.
EXAMPLE 3.4
f(z) ¼ e1=(z2) has an essential singularity at z ¼ 2.
If a function has an isolated singularity, then the singularity is either removable, a pole, or an
essential singularity. For this reason, a pole is sometimes called a non-essential singularity.
Equivalently, z ¼ z0 is an essential singularity if we cannot ﬁnd any positive integer n such
that limz!z0(z  z0)nf(z) ¼ A=0.
6.
Singularities at Inﬁnity. The type of singularity of f(z) at z ¼ 1 [the point at inﬁnity; see pages 7
and 47] is the same as that of f(1/w) at w ¼ 0.
EXAMPLE 3.5
The function f(z) ¼ z3 has a pole of order 3 at z ¼ 1, since f(1=w) ¼ 1=w3 has a pole of
order 3 at w ¼ 0.
For methods of classifying singularities using inﬁnite series, see Chapter 6.
3.12
Orthogonal Families
Let w ¼ f(z) ¼ u(x, y) þ iv(x, y) be analytic and f 0(z)=0. Then the one-parameter families of curves
u(x, y) ¼ a,
v(x, y) ¼ b
(3:15)
where a and b are constants, are orthogonal, i.e., each member of one family [shown heavy in Fig. 3-3] is
perpendicular to each member of the other family [shown dashed in Fig. 3-3] at the point of intersection.
The corresponding image curves in the w plane consisting of lines parallel to the u and v axes also form
orthogonal families [see Fig. 3-4].

Fig. 3-4
In view of this, one might conjecture that if the mapping function f(z) is analytic and f 0(z)=0, then the
angle between any two intersecting curves C1 and C2 in the z plane would equal (both in magnitude and
sense) the angle between corresponding intersecting image curves C0
1 and C0
2 in the w plane. This conjecture
82
CHAPTER 3
Complex Differentiation

is in fact correct and leads to the subject of conformal mapping, which is of such great importance in both
theory and application that two chapters (8 and 9) will be devoted to it.
3.13
Curves
Suppose f(t) and c(t) are real functions of the real variable t assumed continuous in t1  t  t2. Then the
parametric equations
z ¼ x þ iy ¼ f(t) þ ic(t) ¼ z(t),
t1  t  t2
(3:16)
deﬁne a continuous curve or arc in the z plane joining points a ¼ z(t1) and b ¼ z(t2) [see Fig. 3-5].
If t1=t2 while z(t1) ¼ z(t2), i.e., a ¼ b, the endpoints coincide and the curve is said to be closed. A closed
curve that does not intersect itself anywhere is called a simple closed curve. For example, the curve of
Fig. 3-6 is a simple closed curve while that of Fig. 3-7 is not.
If f(t) and c(t) [and thus z(t)] have continuous derivatives in t1  t  t2, the curve is often called a
smooth curve or arc. A curve, which is composed of a ﬁnite number of smooth arcs, is called a piecewise
or sectionally smooth curve or sometimes a contour. For example, the boundary of a square is a piecewise
smooth curve or contour.

Unless otherwise speciﬁed, whenever we refer to a curve or simple closed curve, we shall assume it to be
piecewise smooth.
3.14
Applications to Geometry and Mechanics
We can consider z(t) as a position vector whose
terminal point describes a curve C in a deﬁnite
sense or direction as t varies from t1 to t2. If z(t)
and z(t þ Dt) represent position vectors of points
P and Q, respectively, then
Dz
Dt ¼ z(t þ Dt)  z(t)
Dt
is a vector in the direction of Dz [Fig. 3-8]. If
limDt!0 Dz=Dt ¼ dz=dt exists, the limit is a vector
in the direction of the tangent to C at point P and
is given by
dz
dt ¼ dx

If t is time, dz/dt represents the velocity with which the terminal point describes the curve. Similarly,
d2z=dt2 represents its acceleration along the curve.
3.15
Complex Differential Operators
Let us deﬁne the operators r (del) and r (del bar) by
r ; @
@x þ i @
@y ¼ 2 @
@z ,
r ; @
@x  i @
@y ¼ 2 @
@z
(3:17)
where the equivalence in terms of the conjugate coordinates z and z (page 7) follows from Problem 3.32.
3.16
Gradient, Divergence, Curl, and Laplacian
The operator r enables us to deﬁne the following operations. In all cases, we consider F(x, y) as a real
continuously differentiable function of x and y (scalar), while A(x, y) ¼ P(x, y) þ iQ(x, y) is a complex
continuously differentiable function of x and y (vector).
In terms of conjugate coordinates,
F(x, y) ¼ F z þ z
2
, z  z
2i


¼ G(z, z)
and
A(x, y) ¼ B(z, z)
.
1.
Gradient. We deﬁne the gradient of a real function F (scalar) by
grad F ¼ rF ¼ @F
@x þ i @F
@y ¼ 2 @G
@z
(3:18)
Geometrically, if rF =0, then rF represents a vector normal to the curve F(x, y) ¼ c where c is
a constant (see Problem 3.33).
Similarly, the gradient of a complex function A ¼ P þ iQ (vector) is deﬁned by
grad A ¼ rA ¼
@
@x þ i @
@y


(P þ iQ)
¼ @P
@x  @Q
@y þ i @P
@y þ @Q
@x


¼ 2 @B
@z
(3:19)
In particular, if B is an analytic function of z, then @B=@z ¼ 0 and so the gradient is zero, i.e.,
@P=@x ¼ @Q=@y, @P=@y ¼ (@Q=@x), which shows that the Cauchy–Riemann equations are sat-
isﬁed in this case.
2.
Divergence. By using the deﬁnition of dot product of two complex numbers (page 7) extended to
the case of operators, we deﬁne the divergence of a complex function (vector) by
div A ¼ r  A ¼ RefrAg ¼ Re
@
@x  i @
@y


(P þ iQ)


¼ @P
@x þ @Q
@y ¼ 2 Re @B
@z


(3:20)
Similarly, we can deﬁne the divergence of a real function. It should be noted that the divergence
of a complex or real function (vector or scalar) is always a real function (scalar).
84
CHAPTER 3
Complex Differentiation

3.
Curl. By using the deﬁnition of cross product of two complex numbers (page 7), we deﬁne the
curl of a complex function as the vector
r  A ¼

4.
Laplacian. The Laplacian operator is deﬁned as the dot or scalar product of r with itself, i.e.,
r  r ; r2 ; Refrrg ¼ Re

(3:22)
Note that if A is analytic, r2A ¼ 0 so that r2P ¼ 0 and r2Q ¼ 0, i.e., P and Q are harmonic.
Some Identities Involving Gradient, Divergence, and Curl
Suppose A1, A2, and A are differentiable functions. Then the following identities hold
1.
grad(A1 þ A2) ¼ grad A1 þ grad A2
2.
div(A1 þ A2) ¼ div A1 þ div A2
3.
curl(A1 þ A2) ¼ curl A1 þ curl A2
4.
grad(A1A2)
¼ (A1)(grad A2) þ (grad A1)(A2)
5.
jcurl grad Aj
¼ 0
if A is real or, more generally, if Im{A} is harmonic.
6.
div grad A
¼ 0
if A is imaginary or, more generally, if Re{A} is harmonic.

Then, since the limit depends on the manner in which Dz ! 0, the derivative does not exist, i.e., f(z) ¼ z is
non-analytic anywhere.
3.3. Given w ¼ f(z) ¼ (1 þ z)=(1  z), ﬁnd (a) dw=dz and (b) determine where f(z) is non-analytic.

Since

because f 0(z0) exists by hypothesis. Thus
lim
h!0 f(z0 þ h)  f(z0) ¼ 0
or
lim
h!0 f(z0 þ h) ¼ f(z0)
showing that f(z) is continuous at z0.
(b)
The function f(z) ¼ z is continuous at z0. However, by Problem 3.2, f(z) is not analytic anywhere. This
shows that a function, which is continuous, need not have a derivative, i.e., need not be analytic.
Cauchy–Riemann Equations

ible approaches.

3.6. Given f(z) ¼ u þ iv is analytic in a region R. Prove that u and v are harmonic in R if they have

It will be shown later (Chapter 5) that if f(z) is analytic in R, all its derivatives exist and are continuous in

3.8. Find f(z) in Problem 3.7.
Solution
Method 1
We have
f(z) ¼ f(x þ iy) ¼ u(x, y) þ iv(x, y):
CHAPTER 3
Complex Differentiation
89

Putting y ¼ 0
f(x) ¼ u(x, 0) þ iv(x, 0):
Replacing x by z,
f(z) ¼ u(z, 0) þ iv(z, 0):
Then, from Problem 3.7, u(z, 0) ¼ 0, v(z, 0) ¼ zez and so f(z) ¼ u(z, 0) þ iv(z, 0) ¼ izez, apart from an
arbitrary additive constant.
Method 2
Apart from an arbitrary additive constant, we have from the results of Problem 3.7,
f(z) ¼ u þ iv ¼ ex(x sin y  y cos y) þ iex(y sin y þ x cos y)

Method 3
We have x ¼ (z þ z)=2, y ¼ (z  z)=2i. Then, substituting into u(x, y) þ iv(x, y), we ﬁnd after much tedious
labor that z disappears and we are left with the result izez.
In general, method 1 is preferable over methods 2 and 3 when both u and v are known. If only u (or v) is
known, another procedure is given in Problem 3.101.

Note that f 0(z) ¼ 3z2  4z and dw ¼ (3z2  4z) dz, i.e., dw=dz ¼ 3z2  4z.
(c)
From (a) and (b), Dw  dw ¼ (3z  2)(Dz)2 þ (Dz)3 ¼ eDz where e ¼ (3z  2)Dz þ (Dz)2.
Note that e ! 0 as Dz ! 0, i.e., (Dw  dw)=Dz ! 0 as Dz ! 0. It follows that Dw  dw is an inﬁnitesi-
mal of higher order than Dz.

Then

Solution
(a)
By deﬁnition, w ¼ ez ¼ exþiy ¼ ex(cos y þ i sin y) ¼ u þ iv or u ¼ ex cos y, v ¼ ex sin y.
Since @u=@x ¼ ex cos y ¼ @v=@y and @v=@x ¼ ex sin y ¼ (@u=@y), the Cauchy–Riemann equations are
satisﬁed. Then, by Problem 3.5, the required derivative exists and is equal to

(b) d

(c) d

Solution
(a)
We have w ¼ sin z ¼ sin(x þ iy) ¼ sin x cosh y þ i cos x sinh y. Then
u ¼ sin x cosh y,
v ¼ cos x sinh y
Now @u=@x ¼ cos x cosh y ¼ @v=@y and @v=@x ¼ sin x sinh y ¼ (@u=@y) so that the Cauchy–Riemann
equations are satisﬁed. Hence, by Problem 3.5, the required derivative is equal to
@u
@x þ i @v
@x ¼ i @u
@y þ @v
@y ¼ cos x cosh y  i sin x sinh y ¼ cos(x þ iy) ¼ cos z

3.13. Prove that d
dz z1=2 ¼
1
2z1=2, realizing that z1=2 is a multiple-valued function.
Solution
A function must be single-valued in order to have a derivative. Thus, since z1=2 is multiple-valued (in this case
two-valued), we must restrict ourselves to one branch of this function at a time.
Case 1
Let us ﬁrst consider that branch of w ¼ z1=2 for which w ¼ 1 where z ¼ 1. In this case, w2 ¼ z so that
dz
dw ¼ 2w
and so
dw
dz ¼ 1

CHAPTER 3

Case 2
Next, we consider that branch of w ¼ z1=2 for which w ¼ 1 where z ¼ 1. In this case too, we have w2 ¼ z
so that
dz
dw ¼ 2w
and
dw
dz ¼ 1
2w
or
d

2z1=2
Inboth cases, we have(d=dz)z1=2 ¼ 1=(2z1=2). Notethat the derivativedoesnot existat the branchpointz ¼ 0.
In general, a function does not have a derivative, i.e., is not analytic, at a branch point. Thus branch points are
singular points.
3.14. Prove that d

Solution
Let w ¼ ln z. Then z ¼ ew and dz=dw ¼ ew ¼ z. Hence
d

Note that the result is valid regardless of the particular branch of ln z. Also observe that the derivative does
not exist at the branch point z ¼ 0, illustrating further the remark at the end of Problem 3.13.

z ¼ 2i is a pole of order 2. Similarly, z ¼ 2i is a pole of order 2.
Since we can ﬁnd d such that no singularity other than z ¼ 2i lies inside the circle jz  2ij ¼ d (e.g.,
choose d ¼ 1), it follows that z ¼ 2i is an isolated singularity. Similarly, z ¼ 2i is an isolated
singularity.
(b)
Since sec(1=z) ¼ 1=cos(1=z), the singularities occur where cos(1=z) ¼ 0, i.e., 1=z ¼ (2n þ 1)p=2 or
z ¼ 2=(2n þ 1)p, where n ¼ 0, +1, +2, +3, . . . . Also, since f(z) is not deﬁned at z ¼ 0, it follows
that z ¼ 0 is also a singularity.
Now, by L’Hospital’s rule,
lim
z!2=(2nþ1)p z 

(2n þ 1)p


f(z) ¼

z!2=(2nþ1)p

¼ f2=(2n þ 1)pg2
sin(2n þ 1)p=2 ¼
4(1)n
(2n þ 1)2p2 =0
Thus the singularities z ¼ 2=(2n þ 1)=p,
n ¼ 0, +1, +2, . . . are poles of order one,
i.e., simple poles. Note that these poles are
located on the real axis at z ¼ +2=p,
+2=3p, +2=5p, ... and that there are inﬁ-
nitely many in a ﬁnite interval which includes
0 (see Fig. 3-9).
Since we can surround each of these by a
circle of radius d, which contains no other
singularity, it follows that they are isolated
singularities. It should be noted that the d
required is smaller the closer the singularity is to the origin.
Since we cannot ﬁnd any positive integer n such that limz!0 (z  0)nf(z) ¼ A=0, it follows that z ¼ 0 is
an essential singularity. Also, since every circle of radius d with center at z ¼ 0 contains singular points other
than z ¼ 0, no matter how small we take d, we see that z ¼ 0 is a non-isolated singularity.

(c)
The point z ¼ 2 is a branch point and is a non-isolated singularity. Also, since z2 þ 2z þ 2 ¼ 0 where
z ¼ 1 + i, it follows that z2 þ 2z þ 2 ¼ (z þ 1 þ i)(z þ 1  i) and that z ¼ 1 + i are poles of order 4
which are isolated singularities.
(d)
At ﬁrst sight, it appears as if z ¼ 0 is a branch point. To test this, let z ¼ reiu ¼ rei(uþ2p) where
0  u , 2p.
If z ¼ reiu, we have
f(z) ¼ sin(
ﬃﬃr
p eiu=2)
ﬃﬃr
p eiu=2
If z ¼ rei(uþ2p), we have
f(z) ¼ sin(

p eiu=2)

ﬃﬃr
p eiu=2
¼ sin(

p eiu=2
Thus, there is actually only one branch to the function, and so z ¼ 0 cannot be a branch point.
Since limz!0 sin

p =

p ¼ 1, it follows in fact that z ¼ 0 is a removable singularity.
3.26. (a)
Locate and name all the singularities of f(z) ¼
z8 þ z4 þ 2
(z  1)3(3z þ 2)2.
(b)
Determine where f(z) is analytic.
Solution
(a)
The singularities in the ﬁnite z plane are located at z ¼ 1 and z ¼ 2=3; z ¼ 1 is a pole of order 3 and
z ¼ 2=3 is a pole of order 2.
To determine whether there is a singularity at z ¼ 1 (the point at inﬁnity), let z ¼ 1=w. Then
f(1=w) ¼ (1=w)8 þ (1=w)4 þ 2
(1=w  1)3(3=w þ 2)2 ¼
1 þ w4 þ 2w8
w3(1  w)3(3 þ 2w)2
Thus, since w ¼ 0 is a pole of order 3 for the function f(1=w), it follows that z ¼ 1 is a pole of order 3
for the function f(z).
Then the given function has three singularities: a pole of order 3 at z ¼ 1, a pole of order 2 at
z ¼ 2=3, and a pole of order 3 at z ¼ 1.
(b)
From (a) it follows that f(z) is analytic everywhere in the ﬁnite z plane except at the points z ¼ 1 and 2=3.
Orthogonal Families
3.27. Let u(x, y) ¼ a and v(x, y) ¼ b, where u and v are the real and imaginary parts of an analytic func-
tion f(z) and a and b are any constants, represent two families of curves. Prove that if f 0(z)=0, then
the families are orthogonal (i.e., each member of one family is perpendicular to each member of the
other family at their point of intersection).
Solution
Consider any two members of the respective families, say u(x, y) ¼ a1 and v(x, y) ¼ b1 where a1 and b1 are
particular constants [Fig. 3-10].
Differentiating u(x, y) ¼ a1 with respect to x yields
@u

dx ¼ 0
Then the slope of u(x, y) ¼ a1 is

partials is zero) or one slope is 0 and the other inﬁnity, i.e., one tangent line is horizontal and the other is vertical,
when
@u
@x ¼ @v
@y ¼ 0
or

Thus, the curves are orthogonal if f 0(z)=0.

By Problems 3.7 and 3.27, it follows that ex(y sin y þ x cos y) ¼ b, where b is a real constant, is the required
equation of the orthogonal trajectories.
Applications to Geometry and Mechanics
3.29. An ellipse C has the equation z ¼ a cos vt þ bi sin vt where a, b, v are positive constants, a . b,
and t is a real variable. (a) Graph the ellipse and show that as t increases from t ¼ 0 the ellipse
is traversed in a counterclockwise direction. (b) Find a unit tangent vector to C at any point.
Solution
(a)
As t increases from
0 to p=2v,
p=2v to p=v,
p=v to 3p=2v,
and 3p=2v to 2p=v,
point z on C
moves from A to B, B to D, D to E, and E to A, respectively (i.e., it moves in a counterclockwise direction
as shown in Fig. 3-11).

(b) Determine the acceleration both in magnitude and direction at any time.
(c) Prove that d2z=dt2 ¼ v2z and give a physical interpretation.

(c)
From (b) we see that
d2z=dt2 ¼ av2 cos vt  bv2i sin vt ¼ v2(a cos vt þ bi sin vt) ¼ v2z
Physically, this states that the acceleration at any time is always directed toward point O and has magni-
tude proportional to the instantaneous distance from O. As the particle moves, its projection on the x and y
axes describes what is sometimes called simple harmonic motion of period 2p=v. The acceleration is
sometimes known as the centripetal acceleration.
(d)

Then, the velocity has the greatest magnitude [given by va] where sin vt ¼ +1, i.e., at points B and E
[Fig. 3-11], and the least magnitude [given by vb] where sin vt ¼ 0, i.e., at points A and D.
Similarly, the acceleration has the greatest magnitude [given by v2a] where cos vt ¼ +1, i.e., at
points A and D, and the least magnitude [given by v2b] where cos vt ¼ 0, i.e., at points B and E.
Theoretically, the planets of our solar system move in elliptical paths with the Sun at one focus. In
practice, there is some deviation from an exact elliptical path.

(a)
From Problem 3.5, we have f 0(z) ¼ @u
@x  i @u
@y ¼ u1(x, y)  iu2(x, y).
Putting y ¼ 0, this becomes f 0(x) ¼ u1(x, 0)  iu2(x, 0).
Then, replacing x by z, we have as required f 0(z) ¼ u1(z, 0)  iu2(z, 0).
(b)
Since we are given u ¼ ex(x sin y  y cos y), we have
u1(x, y) ¼ @u
@x ¼ ex sin y  xex sin y þ yex cos y
u2(x, y) ¼ @u
@y ¼ xez cos y þ yez sin y  ex cos y

Complex Line Integrals
Let f(z) be continuous at all points of a curve C [Fig. 4-1], which we shall assume has a ﬁnite length, i.e., C
is a rectiﬁable curve.

Fig. 4-1
Subdivide C into n parts by means of points z1, z2, . . . , zn1, chosen arbitrarily, and call a ¼ z0, b ¼ zn.
On each arc joining zk1 to zk [where k goes from 1 to n], choose a point jk. Form the sum
Sn ¼ f(j1)(z1  a) þ f(j2)(z2  z1) þ    þ f(jn)(b  zn1)
(4:1)
On writing zk  zk1 ¼ Dzk, this becomes
Sn ¼

f(jk)(zk  zk1) ¼

f(jk)Dzk
(4:2)
Let the number of subdivisions n increase in such a way that the largest of the chord lengths jDzkj
approaches zero. Then, since f(z) is continuous, the sum Sn approaches a limit that does not depend on
the mode of subdivision and we denote this limit by
ðb
a
f(z) dz
or
ð
C
f(z) dz
(4:3)
111

called the complex line integral or simply line integral of f(z) along curve C, or the deﬁnite integral of f(z)
from a to b along curve C. In such a case, f(z) is said to be integrable along C. If f(z) is analytic at all points
of a region R and if C is a curve lying in R, then f(z) is continuous and therefore integrable along C.
4.2
Real Line Integrals
Let P(x, y) and Q(x, y) be real functions of x and y continuous at all points of curve C. Then the real line
integral of P dx þ Q dy along curve C can be deﬁned in a manner similar to that given above and is
denoted by
ð
C
[P(x, y) dx þ Q(x, y) dy]
or
ð
C
P dx þ Q dy
(4:4)
the second notation being used for brevity. If C is smooth and has parametric equations x ¼ f(t), y ¼ c(t)
where t1  t  t2, it can be shown that the value of (4) is given by
ðt2
t1
[Pff(t), c(t)gf0(t) dt þ Qff(t), c(t)gc0(t) dt]
Suitable modiﬁcations can be made if C is piecewise smooth (see Problem 4.1).
4.3
Connection Between Real and Complex Line Integrals
Suppose f(z) ¼ u(x, y) þ iv(x, y) ¼ u þ iv. Then the complex line integral (3) can be expressed in terms of
real line integrals as follows:
ð
C
f(z) dz ¼
ð
C
(u þ iv)(dx þ i dy)
¼
ð
C
u dx  v dy þ i
ð
C
v dx þ u dy
(4:5)
For this reason, (4.5) is sometimes taken as a deﬁnition of a complex line integral.
4.4

(a)

CHAPTER 4
Complex Integration and Cauchy’s Theorem

There are various other ways in which the above properties can be described. For example, if T, U, and V
are successive points on a curve, property (c) can be written
Ð
TUV f(z) dz ¼ 
Ð
VUT f(z) dz.
Similarly, if C, C1, and C2 represent curves from a to b, a to m, and m to b, respectively, it is natural for us
to consider C ¼ C1 þ C2 and to write property (d) as
ð
C1þC2
f(z) dz ¼
ð
C1
f(z) dz þ
ð
C2
f(z) dz
4.5
Change of Variables
Let z ¼ g(z ) be a continuous function of a complex variable z ¼ u þ iv. Suppose that curve C in the z plane
corresponds to curve C0 in the z plane and that the derivative g0(z ) is continuous on C0. Then
ð
C
f(z) dz ¼
ð
C0
ffg(z )gg0(z ) dz
(4:6)
These conditions are certainly satisﬁed if g is analytic in a region containing curve C0.
4.6
Simply and Multiply Connected Regions
A region R is called simply-connected if any simple closed curve [Section 3.13], which lies in R, can be
shrunk to a point without leaving R. A region R, which is not simply-connected, is called multiply-
connected.
For example, suppose R is the region deﬁned by jzj , 2 shown shaded in Fig. 4-2. If G is any simple
closed curve lying in R [i.e., whose points are in R], we see that it can be shrunk to a point that lies in
R, and thus does not leave R, so that R is simply-connected. On the other hand, if R is the region
deﬁned by 1 , jzj , 2, shown shaded in Fig. 4-3, then there is a simple closed curve G lying in R that
cannot possibly be shrunk to a point without leaving R, so that R is multiply-connected.

Intuitively, a simply-connected region is one that does not have any “holes” in it, while a multiply-
connected region is one that does. The multiply-connected regions of Figs. 4-3 and 4-4 have, respectively,
one and three holes in them.
CHAPTER 4
Complex Integration and Cauchy’s Theorem

4.7
Jordan Curve Theorem
Any continuous, closed curve that does not intersect itself and may or may not have a ﬁnite length, is called
a Jordan curve [see Problem 4.30]. An important theorem that, although very difﬁcult to prove, seems intui-
tively obvious is the following.
Jordan Curve Theorem. A Jordan curve divides the plane into two regions having the curve as a
common boundary. That region, which is bounded [i.e., is such that all points of it satisfy jzj , M
where M is some positive constant], is called the interior or inside of the curve, while the other region is
called the exterior or outside of the curve.
Using the Jordan curve theorem, it can be shown that the region inside a simple closed curve is a
simply-connected region whose boundary is the simple closed curve.
4.8
Convention Regarding Traversal of a Closed Path
The boundary C of a region is said to be traversed in the positive sense or direction if an observer travelling
in this direction [and perpendicular to the plane] has the region to the left. This convention leads to the
directions indicated by the arrows in Figs. 4-2, 4-3, and 4-4. We use the special symbol
þ
C
f(z) dz
to denote integration of f(z) around the boundary C in the positive sense. In the case of a circle [Fig. 4-2], the
positive direction is the counterclockwise direction. The integral around C is often called a contour integral.
4.9
Green’s Theorem in the Plane
Let P(x, y) and Q(x, y) be continuous and have continuous partial derivatives in a region R and on its bound-
ary C. Green’s theorem states that
þ
C

ðð

(4:7)
The theorem is valid for both simply- and multiply-connected regions.
4.10
Complex Form of Green’s Theorem
Let F(z, z) be continuous and have continuous partial derivatives in a region R and on its boundary C,
where z ¼ x þ iy, z ¼ x  iy are complex conjugate coordinates [see page 7]. Then Green’s theorem can
be written in the complex form
þ
C
F(z, z) dz ¼ 2i

(4:8)
where dA represents the element of area dx dy.
For a generalization of (4.8), see Problem 4.56.

CHAPTER 4
Complex Integration and Cauchy’s Theorem

4.11
Cauchy’s Theorem. The Cauchy–Goursat Theorem
Let f(z) be analytic in a region R and on its boundary C. Then
þ
C
f(z) dz ¼ 0
(4:9)
This fundamental theorem, often called Cauchy’s integral theorem or simply Cauchy’s theorem, is valid for
both simply- and multiply-connected regions. It was ﬁrst proved by use of Green’s theorem with the added
restriction that f 0(z) be continuous in R [see Problem 4.11]. However, Goursat gave a proof which removed
this restriction. For this reason, the theorem is sometimes called the Cauchy–Goursat theorem [see
Problems 4.13–4.16] when one desires to emphasize the removal of this restriction.
4.12
Morera’s Theorem
Let f(z) be continuous in a simply-connected region R and suppose that
þ
C
f(z) dz ¼ 0
(4:10)
around every simple closed curve C in R. Then f(z) is analytic in R.
This theorem, due to Morera, is often called the converse of Cauchy’s theorem. It can be extended to
multiply-connected regions. For a proof, which assumes that f 0(z) is continuous in R, see Problem 4.27.
For a proof, which eliminates this restriction, see Problem 5.7, Chapter 5.
4.13
Indeﬁnite Integrals
Suppose f(z) and F(z) are analytic in a region R and such that F0(z) ¼ f(z). Then F(z) is called an indeﬁnite
integral or anti-derivative of f(z) denoted by
F(z) ¼
ð
f(z) dz
(4:11)
Just as in real variables, any two indeﬁnite integrals differ by a constant. For this reason, an arbitrary con-
stant c is often added to the right of (11).
EXAMPLE 4.1: Since d
dz 3z2  4 sin z

 ¼ 6z  4 cos z, we can write
ð
(6z  4 cos z) dz ¼ 3z2  4 sin z þ c
4.14
Integrals of Special Functions
Using results on page 80 [or by direct differentiation], we can arrive at the results in Fig. 4-5 (omitting a
constant of integration).

Some Consequences of Cauchy’s Theorem
Let f(z) be analytic in a simply-connected region R. Then the following theorems hold.
THEOREM 4.1.
Suppose a and z are any two points in R. Then
ðz
a
f(z) dz
is independent of the path in R joining a and z.
THEOREM 4.2.
Suppose a and z are any two points in R and
G(z) ¼
ðz
a
f(z) dz
(4:12)
Then G(z) is analytic in R and G0(z) ¼ f(z).
Occasionally, confusion may arise because the variable of integration z in (4.12) is the same as the upper
limit of integration. Since a deﬁnite integral depends only on the curve and limits of integration, any symbol
can be used for the variable of integration and, for this reason, we call it a dummy variable or dummy
symbol. Thus (4.12) can be equivalently written
G(z) ¼
ðz
a
f(z ) dz
(4:13)
THEOREM 4.3.
Suppose a and b are any two points in R and F0(z) ¼ f(z). Then
ðb
a
f(z) dz ¼ F(b)  F(a)
(4:14)
This can also be written in the form, familiar from elementary calculus,
ðb

F0(z) dz ¼ F(z)

THEOREM 4.4.
Let f(z) be analytic in a region bounded by two simple closed curves C and C1 [where C1
lies inside C as in Fig. 4-6(a)] and on these curves. Then
þ
C
f(z) dz ¼
þ
C1
f(z) dz
(4:16)
where C and C1 are both traversed in the positive sense relative to their interiors [counter-
clockwise in Fig. 4-6(a)].
The result shows that if we wish to integrate f(z) along curve C, we can equivalently replace C by any
curve C1 so long as f(z) is analytic in the region between C and C1 as in Fig. 4-6(a).

4.6. Extend the proof of Green’s theorem in the plane given in Problem 4.4 to curves C for which lines
parallel to the coordinate axes may cut C in more than two points.
Solution
Consider a simple closed curve C such as shown in Fig. 4-9 in which lines parallel to the axes may meet C in
more than two points. By constructing line ST, the region is divided into two regions R1 and R2 which are of
the type considered in Problem 4.4 and for which Green’s theorem applies, i.e.,

and the theorem is proved. We have proved Green’s theorem for the simply-connected region of Fig. 4-9
bounded by the simple closed curve C. For more complicated regions, it may be necessary to construct
more lines, such as ST, to establish the theorem.
Green’s theorem is also true for multiply-connected regions, as shown in Problem 4.7.

4.7. Show that Green’s theorem in the plane is also valid for a multiply-connected region R such as
shown shaded in Fig. 4-10.
Solution
The boundary of R, which consists of the exterior boundary AHJKLA and the interior boundary DEFGD, is to
be traversed in the positive direction so that a person traveling in this direction always has the region on his/her
left. It is seen that the positive directions are as indicated in the ﬁgure.
In order to establish the theorem, construct a line, such as AD, called a cross-out, connecting the exterior and
interior boundaries. The region bounded by ADEFGDALKJHA is simply-connected, and so Green’s theorem is
valid. Then

4.8. Let P(x, y) and Q(x, y) be continuous and have continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives at each point of a

around every closed path C in R is that @P=@y ¼ @Q=@x identically in R.

Necessity. Suppose Þ
C P dx þ Q dy ¼ 0 around every closed path C in R and that @P=@y=@Q=@x at some point
of R. In particular, suppose @P=@y  @Q=@x . 0 at the point (x0, y0).
By hypothesis, @P=@y and @Q=@x are continuous in R so that there must be some region t containing (x0, y0)
as an interior point for which @P=@y  @Q=@x . 0. If G is the boundary of t, then by Green’s theorem
þ
G
P dx þ Q dy ¼
ðð
t

@y


dx dy . 0
contradicting the hypothesis that
Þ
C P dx þ Q dy ¼ 0 for all closed curves in R. Thus, @Q=@x  @P=@y cannot
be positive.
Similarly, we can show that @Q=@x  @P=@y cannot be negative and it follows that it must be identically
zero, i.e., @P=@y ¼ @Q=@x identically in R.
The results can be extended to multiply-connected regions.
4.9. Let P and Q be deﬁned as in Problem 4.8. Prove
that a necessary and sufﬁcient condition that
Ð B
A P dx þ Q dy be independent of the path in R
joining points A and B is that @P=@y ¼ @Q=@x
identically in R.
Solution
Sufﬁciency. If @P=@y ¼ @Q=@x, then by Problem 4.8
ð
ADBEA
P dx þ Q dy ¼ 0
[see Fig. 4-11]. From this, omitting for brevity the
integrand P dx þ Q dy, we have
ð

ð

and so

i.e., the integral is independent of the path.
Necessity. If the integral is independent of the path, then for all paths C1 and C2 in R, we have
ð
C1
¼
ð
C2
,
ð
ADB
¼
ð
AEB
and
ð

From this, it follows that the line integral around any closed path in R is zero and hence, by Problem 4.8, that
@P=@y ¼ @Q=@x.
The results can be extended to multiply-connected regions.

4.11. Prove Cauchy’s theorem
Þ
C f(z) dz ¼ 0 if f(z) is analytic with derivative f 0(z) which is continuous at
all points inside and on a simple closed curve C.
Solution
Since f(z) ¼ u þ iv is analytic and has a continuous derivative
f 0(z) ¼ @u
@x þ i @v
@x ¼ @v
@y  i @u
@y
it follows that the partial derivatives
@u
@x ¼ @v
@y

are continuous inside and on C. Thus, Green’s theorem can be applied and we have

using the Cauchy–Riemann equations (1) and (2).
By using the fact that Green’s theorem is applicable to multiply-connected regions, we can extend the result
to multiply-connected regions under the given conditions on f(z).
The Cauchy–Goursat theorem [see Problems 4.13–4.16] removes the restriction that f 0(z) be continuous.
Another Method.
The result can be obtained from the complex form of Green’s theorem [Problem 4.10] by noting that if
B(z, z) ¼ f(z) is independent of z, then @B=@z ¼ 0 and so Þ
C f(z) dz ¼ 0.

These follow at once from Cauchy’s theorem since the functions 1, z, and z  z0 are analytic inside C and have
continuous derivatives.
The results can also be established directly from the deﬁnition of an integral (see Problem 4.90).

Now D, D1, D2, D3, . . . is a sequence of triangles, each of which is contained in the preceding (i.e., a sequence
of nested triangles), and there exists a point z0 which lies in every triangle of the sequence.
Since z0 lies inside or on the boundary of D, it follows that f(z) is analytic at z0. Then, by Problem 3.21,
page 95,
f(z) ¼ f(z0) þ f 0(z0)(z  z0) þ h(z  z0)
(6)
where, for any e . 0, we can ﬁnd d such that jh j , e whenever jz  z0j , d.

Now, if P is the perimeter of D, then the perimeter of Dn is Pn ¼ P=2n. If z is any point on Dn, then as seen

i.e., F(z) is analytic and F0(z) ¼ f(z).
4.19. A function F(z) such that F0(z) ¼ f(z) is called an indeﬁnite integral of f(z) and is denoted by
Ð f(z) dz. Show that (a) Ð sin z dz ¼ cos z þ c, (b) Ð dz=z ¼ ln z þ c where c is an arbitrary constant.
Solution
(a)
Since d=dz(cos z þ c) ¼ sin z, we have Ð sin z dz ¼ cos z þ c.
(b)
Since d=dz(ln z þ c) ¼ 1=z, we have Ð dz=z ¼ ln z þ c.
4.20. Let f(z) be analytic in a region R bounded by two simple closed curves C1 and C2 [shaded in

versed in the positive sense relative to their interiors [counterclockwise in Fig. 4-19].
Solution
Construct cross-cut DE. Then, since f(z) is analytic in the region R, we have by Cauchy’s theorem

Solution
(a)
If a is outside C, then f(z) ¼ 1=(z  a) is analytic everywhere inside and on C. Hence, by Cauchy’s
theorem, Þ
C dx=z  a ¼ 0:
(b)
Suppose a is inside C and let G be a circle of radius e with center at z ¼ a so that G is inside C (this can be

Ð
C (12z2  4iz) dz.
Solution
Method 1. By Problem 4.17, the integral is independent of the path joining (1, 1) and (2, 3). Hence, any path can
be chosen. In particular, let us choose the straight line paths from (1, 1) to (2, 1) and then from (2, 1) to (2, 3).
Case 1. Along the path from (1, 1) to (2, 1), y ¼ 1, dy ¼ 0 so that z ¼ x þ iy ¼ x þ i, dz ¼ dx. Then, the
integral equals
ð2

integral equals

We have

Integrating both sides yields

Then

Fig. 5-1
The results (5.1) and (5.2) are called Cauchy’s integral formulas and are quite remarkable because they
show that if a function f(z) is known on the simple closed curve C, then the values of the function and all its
derivatives can be found at all points inside C. Thus, if a function of a complex variable has a ﬁrst
derivative, i.e., is analytic, in a simply-connected region R, all its higher derivatives exist in R. This is
not necessarily true for functions of real variables.
144

5.2
Some Important Theorems
The following is a list of some important theorems that are consequences of Cauchy’s integral formulas.
1.
Morera’s theorem (converse of Cauchy’s theorem)
If f(z) is continuous in a simply-connected region R and if
Þ
C f(z) dz ¼ 0 around every simple
closed curve C in R, then f(z) is analytic in R.
2.
Cauchy’s inequality
Suppose f(z) is analytic inside and on a circle C of radius r and center at z ¼ a. Then
j f (n)(a)j  M  n!
rn
n ¼ 0, 1, 2, . . .
(5:3)
where M is a constant such that j f(z)j , M on C, i.e., M is an upper bound of j f(z)j on C.
3.
Liouville’s theorem
Suppose that for all z in the entire complex plane, (i) f(z) is analytic and (ii) f(z) is bounded, i.e.,
j f(z)j , M for some constant M. Then f(z) must be a constant.
4.
Fundamental theorem of algebra
Every polynomial equation P(z) ¼ a0 þ a1z þ a2z2 þ    þ anzn ¼ 0 with degree n  1 and an=0
has at least one root.
From this it follows that P(z) ¼ 0 has exactly n roots, due attention being paid to multiplicities
of roots.
5.
Gauss’ mean value theorem
Suppose f(z) is analytic inside and on a circle C with center at a and radius r. Then f(a) is the mean
of the values of f(z) on C, i.e.,
f(a) ¼ 1

(5:4)
6.
Maximum modulus theorem
Suppose f(z) is analytic inside and on a simple closed curve C and is not identically equal to a
constant. Then the maximum value of j f(z)j occurs on C.
7.
Minimum modulus theorem
Suppose f(z) is analytic inside and on a simple closed curve C and f(z)=0 inside C. Then j f(z)j
assumes its minimum value on C.
8.
The argument theorem
Let f(z) be analytic inside and on a simple closed curve C except for a ﬁnite number of poles
inside C. Then
1
2pi
þ
C
f 0(z)
f(z) dz ¼ N  P
(5:5)
where N and P are, respectively, the number of zeros and poles of f(z) inside C.
For a generalization of this theorem, see Problem 5.90.
9.
Rouche´’s theorem
Suppose f(z) and g(z) are analytic inside and on a simple closed curve C and suppose
jg(z)j , j f(z)j on C. Then f(z) þ g(z) and f(z) have the same number of zeros inside C.
10.
Poisson’s integral formulas for a circle

We present a proof for the multiply-connected region R
bounded by the simple closed curves C1 and C2 as indi-
cated in Fig. 5-4. Extensions to other multiply-connected
regions are easily made (see Problem 5.40).
Construct a circle G having center at any point a in R so
that G lies entirely in R. Let R0 consist of the set of points
in R that are exterior to G. Then, the function f(z)=(z  a)
is analytic inside and on the boundary of R0. Hence, by

around every simple closed curve C in R. Then f(z) is analytic in R.
Solution
If
Þ
C f(z) dz ¼ 0 independent of C, it follows by Problem 4.17, that F(z) ¼
Ð z
a f(z) dz is independent of the path
joining a and z, so long as this path is in R.
Then, by reasoning identical with that used in Problem 4.18, it follows that F(z) is analytic in R and
F0(z) ¼ f(z). However, by Problem 5.2, it follows that F0(z) is also analytic if F(z) is. Hence, f(z) is analytic in R.

f(z) is bounded [i.e., we can ﬁnd a constant M such that j f(z)j , M]. Then f(z) must be a constant.
Solution
Let a and b be any two points in the z plane. Suppose that C is a
circle of radius r having center at a and enclosing point b (see

if we choose r so large that ja  bj , r=2. Then, since j f(z)j , M and the length of C is 2pr, we have by

Letting r ! 1, we see that j f(b)  f(a)j ¼ 0 or f(b) ¼ f(a), which shows that f(z) must be a constant.
Another Method. Letting n ¼ 1 in Problem 5.8 and replacing a by z we have,
j f 0(z)j  M=r
Letting r ! 1, we deduce that j f 0(z)j ¼ 0 and so f 0(z) ¼ 0. Hence, f(z) ¼ constant, as required.
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
5.10. Prove the fundamental theorem of algebra: Every polynomial equation P(z) ¼ a0 þ a1z þ
a2z2 þ    þ anzn ¼ 0, where the degree n  1 and an=0, has at least one root.
Solution
If P(z) ¼ 0 has no root, then f(z) ¼ 1=P(z) is analytic for all z. Also, j f(z)j ¼ 1=jP(z)j is bounded (and in fact
approaches zero) as jzj ! 1.
Then by Liouville’s theorem (Problem 5.9), it follows that f(z) and thus P(z) must be a constant. Thus, we
are led to a contradiction and conclude that P(z) ¼ 0 must have at least one root or, as is sometimes said, P(z)
has at least one zero.
5.11. Prove that every polynomial equation P(z) ¼ a0 þ a1z þ a2z2 þ    þ anzn ¼ 0, where the degree
n  1 and an =0, has exactly n roots.
Solution
By the fundamental theorem of algebra (Problem 5.10), P(z) has at least one root. Denote this root by a. Then
P(a) ¼ 0. Hence
P(z)  P(a) ¼ a0 þ a1z þ a2z2 þ    þ anzn  (a0 þ a1a þ a2a2 þ    þ anan)
¼ a1(z  a) þ a2(z2  a2) þ    þ an(zn  an)
¼ (z  a)Q(z)
where Q(z) is a polynomial of degree (n  1).
Applying the fundamental theorem of algebra again, we see that Q(z) has at least one zero, which we can
denote by b [which may equal a], and so P(z) ¼ (z  a)(z  b)R(z). Continuing in this manner, we see that
P(z) has exactly n zeros.
Gauss’ Mean Value Theorem
5.12. Let f(z) be analytic inside and on a circle C with center at a. Prove Gauss’ mean value theorem that

Maximum Modulus Theorem
5.13. Prove the maximum modulus theorem: Suppose f(z) is analytic inside and on a simple closed curve
C. Then the maximum value of j f(z)j occurs on C, unless f(z) is a constant.
Solution
Method 1
Since f(z) is analytic and hence continuous inside and on C, it
follows that j f(z)j does have a maximum value M for at least
one value of z inside or on C. Suppose this maximum value is
not attained on the boundary of C but is attained at an interior
point a, i.e., j f(a)j ¼ M. Let C1 be a circle inside C with
center at a (see Fig. 5-6). If we exclude f(z) from being a constant
inside C1, then there must be a point inside C1, say b, such that
j f(b)j , M or, what is the same thing, j f(b)j ¼ M  e where
e . 0.
Now, by the continuity of j f(z)j at b, we see that for any e . 0
we can ﬁnd d . 0 such that
jj f(z)j  j f(b)jj , 1

whenever jz  bj , d

(2)
for all points interior to a circle C2 with center at b and radius d, as shown shaded in the ﬁgure.
Construct a circle C3 with a center at a that passes through b (dashed in Fig. 5-6). On part of this circle
[namely that part PQ included in C2], we have from (2), j f(z)j , M  1
2 e. On the remaining part of the
circle, we have j f(z)j  M.
If we measure u counterclockwise from OP and let /POQ ¼ a, it follows from Problem 5.12 that if

From Problem 5.12, we have

j f(a þ reiu)j du
(3)
Let us suppose that j f(a)j is a maximum so that j f(a þ reiu)j  jf(a)j. If j f(a þ reiu)j , j f(a)j for one
value of u then, by continuity of f, it would hold for a ﬁnite arc, say u1 , u , u2. But, in such case, the
mean value of j f(a þ reiu)j is less than j f(a)j, which would contradict (3). It follows, therefore, that in any
d neighborhood of a, i.e., for jz  aj , d, f(z) must be a constant. If f(z) is not a constant, the maximum
value of j f(z)j must occur on C.
For another method, see Problem 5.57.
Minimum Modulus Theorem
5.14. Prove the minimum modulus theorem: Let f(z) be analytic inside and on a simple closed curve C.
Prove that if f(z)=0 inside C, then j f(z)j must assume its minimum value on C.
Solution
Since f(z) is analytic inside and on C and since f(z)=0 inside C, it follows that 1/f(z) is analytic inside C.
By the maximum modulus theorem, it follows that 1=j f(z)j cannot assume its maximum value inside C and
so j f(z)j cannot assume its minimum value inside C. Then, since j f(z)j has a minimum, this minimum
must be attained on C.
5.15. Give an example to show that if f(z) is analytic inside and on a simple closed curve C and f(z) ¼ 0
at some point inside C, then j f(z)j need not assume its minimum value on C.
Solution
Let f(z) ¼ z for jzj  1, so that C is a circle with center at the origin and radius 1. We have f(z) ¼ 0 at z ¼ 0.
If z ¼ reiu, then j f(z)j ¼ r and it is clear that the minimum value of j f(z)j does not occur on C but occurs inside
C where r ¼ 0, i.e., at z ¼ 0.
The Argument Theorem
5.16. Let f(z) be analytic inside and on a simple closed curve C except for a pole z ¼ a of order (multi-
plicity) p inside C. Suppose also that inside C, f(z) has only one zero z ¼ b of order (multiplicity)
n and no zeros on C. Prove that

5.20. Prove that all the roots of z7  5z3 þ 12 ¼ 0 lie between the circles jzj ¼ 1 and jzj ¼ 2.
Solution
Consider the circle C1: jzj ¼ 1. Let f(z) ¼ 12, g(z) ¼ z7  5z3. On C1 we have
jg(z)j ¼ jz7  5z3j  jz7j þ j5z3j  6 , 12 ¼ j f(z)j
Hence, by Rouche´’s theorem, f(z) þ g(z) ¼ z7  5z3 þ 12 has the same number of zeros inside jzj ¼ 1 as
f(z) ¼ 12, i.e., there are no zeros inside C1.
Consider the circle C2: jzj ¼ 2. Let f(z) ¼ z7, g(z) ¼ 12  5z3. On C2 we have
jg(z)j ¼ j12  5z3j  j12j þ j5z3j  60 , 27 ¼ j f(z)j
Hence, by Rouche´’s theorem, f(z) þ g(z) ¼ z7  5z3 þ 12 has the same number of zeros inside jzj ¼ 2 as
f(z) ¼ z7, i.e., all the zeros are inside C2.
Hence, all the roots lie inside jzj ¼ 2 but outside jzj ¼ 1, as required.

5.25. Suppose f(z) ¼ u(x, y) þ iv(x, y) is analytic in a region R. Prove that u and v are harmonic in R.
Solution
In Problem 3.6, we proved that u and v are harmonic in R, i.e., satisfy the equation (@2f=@x2) þ (@2f=@y2) ¼ 0,
under the assumption of existence of the second partial derivatives of u and v, i.e., the existence of f 00(z).
This assumption is no longer necessary since we have in fact proved in Problem 5.4 that, if f(z) is analytic
in R, then all the derivatives of f(z) exist.
5.26. Prove Schwarz’s theorem: Let f(z) be analytic for jzj  R, f(0) ¼ 0, and j f(z)j  M. Then
j f(z)j  Mjzj

Solution
The function f(z)/z is analytic in jzj  R. Hence, on jzj ¼ R, we have by the maximum modulus theorem,
f(z)

However, since this inequality must also hold for points inside jzj ¼ R, we have for jzj  R, j f(z)j  Mjzj=R
as required.

where x is real. Show that the function f(x) (a) has a ﬁrst derivative at all values of x for which
0  x  1 but (b) does not have a second derivative in 0  x  1. (c) Reconcile these conclusions
with the result of Problem 5.4.
160
CHAPTER 5

Solution
(a)
The only place where there is any question as to existence of the ﬁrst derivative is at x ¼ 0. But, at x ¼ 0,
the derivative is

f(0 þ Dx)  f(0)
Dx
¼ lim
Dx!0
(Dx)2 sin(1=Dx)  0
Dx

Dx!0 Dx sin(1=Dx) ¼ 0
and so exists.
At all other values of x in 0  x  1, the derivative is given (using elementary differentiation rules) by
x2 cos(1=x)f1=x2g þ (2x) sin(1=x) ¼ 2x sin(1=x)  cos(1=x)
(b)
From part (a), we have
f 0(x) ¼
2x sin(1=x)  cos(1=x)
x=0
0
x ¼ 0
n
The second derivative exists for all x such that 0 , x  1. At x ¼ 0, the second derivative is given by
lim
Dx!0
f 0(0 þ Dx)  f 0(0)
Dx
¼ lim
Dx!0
2Dx sin(1=Dx)  cos(1=Dx)  0
Dx
¼ lim
Dx!0 f2 sin(1=Dx)  (1=Dx) cos(1=Dx)g
which does not exist.
It follows that the second derivative of f(x) does not exist in 0  x  1.
(c)
According to Problem 5.4, if f(z) is analytic in a region R, then all higher derivatives exist and are ana-
lytic in R. The above results do not conﬂict with this, since the function f(z) ¼ z2 sin(1=z) is not analytic
in any region which includes z ¼ 0.

If F(z) has a pole of order m at z ¼ a, then F(z) ¼ f(z)=(z  a)m where f(z) is analytic inside and on C, and

Inﬁnite Series
Taylor’s and Laurent’s Series
6.1
Sequences of Functions
The ideas of Chapter 2, pages 48 and 49, for sequences and series of constants are easily extended to
sequences and series of functions.
Let u1(z), u2(z), . . . , un(z), . . . , denoted brieﬂy by fun(z)g, be a sequence of functions of z deﬁned and
single-valued in some region of the z plane. We call U(z) the limit of un(z) as n ! 1, and write
limn!1 un(z) ¼ U(z), if given any positive number e, we can ﬁnd a number N [depending in general on
both e and z] such that
jun(z)  U(z)j , e
for all n > N
In such a case, we say that the sequence converges or is convergent to U(z).
If a sequence converges for all values of z (points) in a region R, we call R the region of convergence of
the sequence. A sequence that is not convergent at some value (point) z is called divergent at z.
The theorems on limits given on page 49 can be extended to sequences of functions.
6.2
Series of Functions
From the sequence of functions fun(z)g, let us form a new sequence fSn(z)g deﬁned by
S1(z) ¼ u1(z)
S2(z) ¼ u1(z) þ u2(z)
..
.
..
.
Sn(z) ¼ u1(z) þ u2(z) þ    þ un(z)
where Sn(z), called the nth partial sum, is the sum of the ﬁrst n terms of the sequence fun(z)g.
The sequence S1(z), S2(z), . . . or fSn(z)g is symbolized by
u1(z) þ u2(z) þ    ¼
X
1
n¼1
un(z)
(6:1)
called an inﬁnite series. If limn!1 Sn(z) ¼ S(z), the series is called convergent and S(z) is its sum; otherwise,
the series is called divergent. We sometimes write P1
n¼1 un(z) as P un(z) or P un for brevity.
169

As we have already seen, a necessary condition that the series (1) converges is limn!1 un(z) ¼ 0, but this
is not sufﬁcient. See, for example, Problem 2.150, and also Problems 6.67(c), 6.67(d), and 6.111(a).
If a series converges for all values of z (points) in a region R, we call R the region of convergence of the
series.
6.3
Absolute Convergence
A series P1
n¼1 un(z) is called absolutely convergent if the series of absolute values, i.e., P1
n¼1 jun(z)j,
converges.
If P1
n¼1 un(z) converges but P1
n¼1 jun(z)j does not converge, we call P1
n¼1 un(z) conditionally
convergent.
6.4
Uniform Convergence of Sequences and Series
In the deﬁnition of limit of a sequence of functions, it was pointed out that the number N depends in
general on e and the particular value of z. It may happen, however, that we can ﬁnd a number N such
that jun(z)  U(z)j , e for all n . N, where the same number N holds for all z in a region R [i.e., N
depends only on e and not on the particular value of z (point) in the region]. In such a case, we say that
un(z) converges uniformly, or is uniformly convergent, to U(z) for all z in R.
Similarly, if the sequence of partial sums fSn(z)g converges uniformly to S(z) in a region, we say that the
inﬁnite series (6.1) converges uniformly, or is uniformly convergent, to S(z) in the region.
We call Rn(z) ¼ unþ1(z) þ unþ2(z) þ    ¼ S(z)  Sn(z) the remainder of the inﬁnite series (6.1)
after n terms. Then, we can equivalently say that the series is uniformly convergent to S(z) in R if,
given any e . 0, we can ﬁnd a number N such that for all z in R,
jRn(z)j ¼ jS(z)  Sn(z)j , e
for all n > N
6.5
Power Series

a0 þ a1(z  a) þ a2(z  a)2 þ    ¼
X
1
n¼0
an(z  a)n
(6:2)
is called a power series in z  a. We shall sometimes shorten (6.2) to P an(z  a)n.
Clearly the power series (6.2) converges for z ¼ a, and this may indeed be the only point for which it
converges [see Problem 6.13(b)]. In general, however, the series converges for other points as well. In
such cases, we can show that there exists a positive number R such that (6.2) converges for jz  aj , R
and diverges for jz  aj . R, while for jz  aj ¼ R, it may or may not converge.
Geometrically, if G is a circle of radius R with center at z ¼ a, then the series (6.2) converges at all points
inside G and diverges at all points outside G, while it may or may not converge on the circle G. We
can consider the special cases R ¼ 0 and R ¼ 1, respectively, to be the cases where (6.2) converges
only at z ¼ a or converges for all (ﬁnite) values of z. Because of this geometrical interpretation, R is
often called the radius of convergence of (6.2) and the corresponding circle is called the circle of
convergence.

6.6
Some Important Theorems
For reference purposes, we list here some important theorems involving sequences and series. Many of
these will be familiar from their analogs for real variables.
A. General Theorems
THEOREM 6.1.
If a sequence has a limit, the limit is unique [i.e., it is the only one].
THEOREM 6.2.
Let un ¼ an þ ibn, n ¼ 1, 2, 3, . . . , where an and bn are real. Then, a necessary and
sufﬁcient condition that fung converge is that fang and fbng converge.
THEOREM 6.3.
Let fang be a real sequence with the property that
(i) anþ1  an
or
anþ1  an
(ii) janj , M (a constant)
Then fang converges.
If the ﬁrst condition in Property (i) holds, the sequence is called monotonic increasing;
if the second condition holds, it is called monotonic decreasing. If Property (ii) holds, the
sequence is said to be bounded. Thus, the theorem states that every bounded monotonic
(increasing or decreasing) sequence has a limit.
THEOREM 6.4.
A necessary and sufﬁcient condition that fung converges is that given any e . 0, we can
ﬁnd a number N such that jup  uqj , e for all p . N, q . N.
This result, which has the advantage that the limit itself is not present, is called
Cauchy’s convergence criterion.
THEOREM 6.5.
A necessary condition that P un converge is that limn!1 un ¼ 0. However, the condition
is not sufﬁcient.
THEOREM 6.6.
Multiplication of each term of a series by a constant different from zero does not affect
the convergence or divergence. Removal (or addition) of a ﬁnite number of terms from
(or to) a series does not affect the convergence or divergence.
THEOREM 6.7.
A necessary and sufﬁcient condition that P1
n¼1 (an þ ibn) converges, where an and bn are
real, is that P1
n¼1 an and P1
n¼1 bn converge.
B. Theorems on Absolute Convergence
THEOREM 6.8.
If P1
n¼1 junj converges, then P1
n¼1 un converges. In words, an absolutely convergent
series is convergent.
THEOREM 6.9.
The terms of an absolutely convergent series can be rearranged in any order and all such
rearranged series converge to the same sum. Also, the sum, difference, and product of
absolutely convergent series is absolutely convergent.
These are not so for conditionally convergent series (see Problem 6.127).
C. Special Tests for Convergence
THEOREM 6.10. (Comparison tests)
(a)
If P jvnj converges and junj  jvnj, then P un converges absolutely.
(b)
If P jvnj diverges and junj  jvnj, then P junj diverges but P un may or may not
converge.

Let limn!1 unþ1=un

Let limn!1

junj

diverges if L . 1. If L ¼ 1, the test fails.

If f(x)  0 for x  a, then P f(n) converges or diverges according as
limM!1
Ð M
a f(x) dx converges or diverges.

Let limn!1 n 1  unþ1=un




¼ L. Then P un converges (absolutely) if
L . 1 and diverges or converges conditionally if L , 1. If L ¼ 1, the
test fails.
THEOREM 6.15. (Gauss’ test)
Suppose unþ1=un

 ¼ 1  (L=n) þ (cn=n2) where jcnj , M for all n . N.
Then P un converges (absolutely) if L . 1 and diverges or converges
conditionally if L  1.
THEOREM 6.16. (Alternating series test)
If an  0, anþ1  an for n ¼ 1, 2, 3, . . . and limn!1 an ¼ 0,
then a1  a2 þ a3     ¼ P (1)n1an converges.
D. Theorems on Uniform Convergence
THEOREM 6.17. (Weierstrass M test)
jun(z)j  Mn, where Mn is independent of z in a region R and
P Mn converges, then P un(z) is uniformly convergent in R.
THEOREM 6.18.
The sum of a uniformly convergent series of continuous functions is continuous, i.e., if
un(z) is continuous in R and S(z) ¼ P un(z) is uniformly convergent in R, then S(z) is
continuous in R.
THEOREM 6.19.
Suppose fun(z)g are continuous in R, S(z) ¼ P un(z) is uniformly convergent in R and
C is a curve in R. Then

In words, a uniformly convergent series of continuous functions can be integrated
term by term.
THEOREM 6.20.
Suppose u0
n(z) ¼ (d=dz)un(z) exists in R, P u0
n(z) converges uniformly in R and
P un(z) converges in R. Then (d=dz) P un(z) ¼ P u0
n(z).
THEOREM 6.21.
Suppose fun(z)g are analytic and P un(z) is uniformly convergent in R. Then
S(z) ¼ P un(z) is analytic in R.

E. Theorems on Power Series
THEOREM6.22.
A power series converges uniformly and absolutely in any region that lies entirely inside
its circle of convergence.
THEOREM 6.23.
(a)
A power series can be differentiated term by term in any region that lies entirely
inside its circle of convergence.
(b)
A power series can be integrated term by term along any curve C that lies entirely
inside its circle of convergence.
(c)
The sum of a power series is continuous in any region that lies entirely inside its
circle of convergence.
These follow from Theorems 6.17–6.19 and 6.21.
THEOREM 6.24.
(Abel’s theorem)
Let P anzn have radius of convergence R and suppose that z0 is a
point on the circle of convergence such that P anzn
0 converges. Then, limz!z0
P anzn ¼
P anzn
0 where z ! z0 from within the circle of convergence. Extensions to other power
series are easily made.
THEOREM 6.25.
Suppose P anzn converges to zero for all z such that jzj , R where R . 0. Then an ¼ 0.
Equivalently, if P anzn ¼ P bnzn for all z such that jzj , R, then an ¼ bn.
6.7
Taylor’s Theorem
Let f(z) be analytic inside and on a simple closed curve C. Let a and a þ h be two points inside C. Then
f(a þ h) ¼ f(a) þ hf 0(a) þ h2
2! f 00(a) þ    þ hn
n! f (n)(a) þ   

2!
(z  a)2 þ    þ f (n)(a)
n!
(z  a)n þ   
(6:4)
This is called Taylor’s theorem and the series (6.3) or (6.4) is called a Taylor series or expansion for
f(a þ h) or f(z).
The region of convergence of the series (6.4) is given by jz  aj , R, where the radius of convergence R
is the distance from a to the nearest singularity of the function f(z). On jz  aj ¼ R, the series may or may
not converge. For jz  aj . R, the series diverges.
If the nearest singularity of f(z) is at inﬁnity, the radius of convergence is inﬁnite, i.e., the series con-
verges for all z.
If a ¼ 0 in (6.3) or (6.4), the resulting series is often called a Maclaurin series.

Laurent’s Theorem
Let C1 and C2 be concentric circles of radii R1 and R2, respect-
ively, and center at a [Fig. 6-1]. Suppose that f(z) is single-
valued and analytic on C1 and C2 and, in the ring-shaped
region R [also called the annulus or annular region] between
C1 and C2, is shown shaded in Fig. 6-1. Let a þ h be any point
in R. Then we have

In the above integrations, we can replace C1 and C2 by any concentric circle C between C1 and C2 [see

This is called Laurent’s theorem and (6.5) or (6.8) with coefﬁcients (6.6), (6.7), or (6.9) is called a Laurent
series or expansion.
The part a0 þ a1(z  a) þ a2(z  a)2 þ    is called the analytic part of the Laurent series, while the
remainder of the series, which consists of inverse powers of z  a, is called the principal part. If the prin-
cipal part is zero, the Laurent series reduces to a Taylor series.

6.10
Classiﬁcation of Singularities
It is possible to classify the singularities of a function f(z) by examination of its Laurent series. For this
purpose, we assume that in Fig. 6-1, R2 ¼ 0, so that f(z) is analytic inside and on C1 except at z ¼ a,
which is an isolated singularity [see page 81]. In the following, all singularities are assumed isolated
unless otherwise indicated.
1.
Poles. If f(z) has the form (6.8) in which the principal part has only a ﬁnite number of terms
given by
a1
z  a þ
a2
(z  a)2 þ    þ
an
(z  a)n
where an =0, then z ¼ a is called a pole of order n. If n ¼ 1, it is called a simple pole.
If f(z) has a pole at z ¼ a, then limz!a f(z) ¼ 1 [see Problem 6.32].
2.
Removable singularities. If a single-valued function f(z) is not deﬁned at z ¼ a but limz!a f(z)
exists, then z ¼ a is called a removable singularity. In a such case, we deﬁne f(z) at z ¼ a as
equal to limz!a f(z), and f(z) will then be analytic at a.
EXAMPLE 6.1:
If f(z) ¼ sin z=z, then z ¼ 0 is a removable singularity since f(0) is not deﬁned
but limz!0 sin z=z ¼ 1. We deﬁne f(0) ¼ limz!0 sin z=z ¼ 1. Note that in this case

5!  z6
7! þ   
3.
Essential singularities. If f(z) is single-valued, then any singularity that is not a pole or removable
singularity is called an essential singularity. If z ¼ a is an essential singularity of f(z), the principal
part of the Laurent expansion has inﬁnitely many terms.
EXAMPLE 6.2:
Since e1=z ¼ 1 þ 1
z þ 1
2!z2 þ 1
3!z3 þ    , z ¼ 0 is an essential singularity.
The following two related theorems are of interest (see Problems 6.153–6.155):
Casorati–Weierstrass theorem. In any neighborhood of an isolated essential singularity a,
an otherwise analytic function f(z) comes arbitrarily close to any complex number an inﬁnite
number of times. In symbols, given any positive numbers d and e and any complex number A,
there exists a value of z inside the circle jz  aj ¼ d for which j f(z)  Aj , e.
Picard’s theorem. In the neighborhood of an isolated essential singularity a, an otherwise analytic
function f(z) takes on every complex value with perhaps one exception.
4.
Branch points. A point z ¼ z0 is called a branch point of a multiple-valued function f(z) if the
branches of f(z) are interchanged when z describes a closed path about z0 [see page 45]. A
branch point is a non-isolated singularity. Since each of the branches of a multiple-valued function
is analytic, all of the theorems for analytic functions, in particular Taylor’s theorem, apply.
EXAMPLE 6.3:
The branch of f(z) ¼ z1=2, which has the value 1 for z ¼ 1, has a Taylor series of the
form a0 þ a1(z  1) þ a2(z  1)2 þ    with radius of convergence R ¼ 1 [the distance from z ¼ 1 to the
nearest singularity, namely the branch point z ¼ 0].
5.
Singularities at inﬁnity. By letting z ¼ 1=w in f(z), we obtain the function f(1=w) ¼ F(w). Then
the nature of the singularity for f(z) at z ¼ 1 [the point at inﬁnity] is deﬁned to be the same as that
of F(w) at w ¼ 0.
EXAMPLE 6.4:
f(z) ¼ z3 has a pole of order 3 at z ¼ 1, since F(w) ¼ f(1=w) ¼ 1=w3 has a pole of order 3 at
w ¼ 0. Similarly, f(z) ¼ ez has an essential singularity at z ¼ 1, since F(w) ¼ f(1=w) ¼ e1=w has an essential
singularity at w ¼ 0.

6.11
Entire Functions
A function that is analytic everywhere in the ﬁnite plane [i.e., everywhere except at 1] is called an entire
function or integral function. The functions e z, sin z, cos z are entire functions.
An entire function can be represented by a Taylor series that has an inﬁnite radius of convergence.
Conversely, if a power series has an inﬁnite radius of convergence, it represents an entire function.
Note that by Liouville’s theorem [Chapter 5, page 145], a function which is analytic everywhere includ-
ing 1 must be a constant.
6.12
Meromorphic Functions
A function that is analytic everywhere in the ﬁnite plane except at a ﬁnite number of poles is called a
meromorphic function.
EXAMPLE 6.5: z=(z  1)(z þ 3)2, which is analytic everywhere in the ﬁnite plane except at the poles z ¼ 1 (simple
pole) and z ¼ 3 (pole of order 2), is a meromorphic function.
6.13
Lagrange’s Expansion
Let z be that root of z ¼ a þ zf(z) which has the value z ¼ a when z ¼ 0. Then, if f(z) is analytic inside and
on a circle C containing z ¼ a, we have
z ¼ a þ

(6:11)
The expansion (6.11) and the special case (6.10) are often referred to as Lagrange’s expansions.
6.14
Analytic Continuation
Suppose that we do not know the precise form of an analytic
function f(z) but only know that inside some circle of conver-
gence C1 with center at a [Fig. 6-2], f(z) is represented by a
Taylor series
a0 þ a1(z  a) þ a2(z  a)2 þ   
(6:12)
Choosing a point b inside C1, we can ﬁnd the value of f(z) and
its derivatives at b from (6.13) and thus arrive at a new series
b0 þ b1(z  b) þ b2(z  b)2 þ   
(6:13)
having circle of convergence C2. If C2 extends beyond C1,
then the values of f(z) and its derivatives can be obtained in
this extended portion and so we have achieved more infor-
mation concerning f(z).
We say, in this case, that f(z) has been extended analytically beyond C1 and call the process analytic
continuation or analytic extension.
The process can, of course, be repeated indeﬁnitely. Thus, choosing point c inside C2, we arrive at a new
series having circle of convergence C3 which may extend beyond C1 and C2, etc.
The collection of all such power series representations, i.e., all possible analytic continuations, is deﬁned
as the analytic function f(z) and each power series is sometimes called an element of f(z).

CHAPTER 6
Inﬁnite Series Taylor’s and Laurent’s Series

In performing analytic continuations, we must avoid singularities. For example, there cannot be any singu-
larity in Fig. 6-2 that is both inside C2 and on the boundary of C1, otherwise (6.13) would diverge at this point.
In some cases, the singularities on a circle of convergence are so numerous that analytic continuation is
impossible. In these cases the boundary of the circle is called a natural boundary or barrier [see Problem
6.30]. The function represented by a series having a natural boundary is called a lacunary function.
In going from circle C1 to circle Cn [Fig. 6-2], we have chosen the path of centers a, b, c, . . . , p, which we
represent by path P1. Many other paths are also possible, e.g., a, b0, c0, . . . , p represented brieﬂy by path P2.
A question arises as to whether one obtains the same series representation valid inside Cn when one chooses
different paths. The answer is yes, so long as the region bounded by paths P1 and P2 has no singularity.
For a further discussion of analytic continuation, see Chapter 10.
SOLVED PROBLEMS
Sequences and Series of Functions
6.1. Using the deﬁnition, prove that limn!1 1 þ z
n


¼ 1 for all z.
Solution
Given any number e . 0, we must ﬁnd N such that j1 þ z=n  1j , e for n . N. Then jz=nj , e, i.e., jzj=n , e
if n . jzj=e ¼ N.
6.2. (a) Prove that the series z(1  z) þ z2(1  z) þ z3(1  z) þ    converges for jzj , 1, and
(b) ﬁnd its sum.
Solution
The sum of the ﬁrst n terms of the series is
Sn(z) ¼ z(1  z) þ z2(1  z) þ    þ zn(1  z)
¼ z  z2 þ z2  z3 þ    þ zn  znþ1 ¼ z  znþ1
Now
jSn(z)  zj ¼ jznþ1j ¼ jzjnþ1 , e
for
(n þ 1) lnjzj , ln e,
i.e.,
n þ 1 . ln e=ln jzj
or
n . (ln e=ln jzj)  1:
If z ¼ 0, Sn(0) ¼ 0 and jSn(0)  0j , e for all n.
Hence limn!1 Sn(z) ¼ z, the required sum for all z such that jzj , 1.
Another Method. Since Sn(z) ¼ z  znþ1, we have [by Problem 2.41, in which we showed that limn!1 zn ¼ 0
if j2j , 1]
Required sum ¼ S(z) ¼ lim
n!1 Sn(z) ¼ lim
n!1 (z  znþ1) ¼ z:
Absolute and Uniform Convergence
6.3. (a) Prove that the series in Problem 6.2 converges uniformly to the sum z for jzj  1
2.
(b) Does the series converge uniformly for jzj  1? Explain.
Solution
(a) In Problem 6.2, we have shown that jSn(z)  zj , e for all n . (ln e=lnjzj)  1, i.e., the series converges to
the sum z for jzj , 1 and thus for jzj  1
2.
Now if jzj  1
2, the largest value of (ln e=lnjzj)  1 occurs where jzj ¼ 1
2 and is given by
(ln e=ln(1=2))  1 ¼ N. It follows that jSn(z)  zj , e for all n . N where N depends only on e and not
on the particular z in jzj  1
2. Thus, the series converges uniformly to z for jzj  1
2.
CHAPTER 6
Inﬁnite Series Taylor’s and Laurent’s Series
177

(b) The same argument given in part (a) serves to show that the series converges uniformly to sum z for
jzj  :9 or jzj  :99 by using N ¼ (ln e=ln(:9))  1 and N ¼ (ln e=ln(:99))  1, respectively.
However, it is clear that we cannot extend the argument to jzj  1 since this would require
N ¼ (ln e=ln 1)  1, which is inﬁnite, i.e., there is no ﬁnite value of N that can be used in this case.
Thus, the series does not converge uniformly for jzj  1.
6.4. (a) Prove that the sequence 1=1 þ nz

 is uniformly convergent to zero for all z such that jzj  2.
(b) Can the region of uniform convergence in (a) be extended? Explain.
Solution
(a) We have (1=1 þ nz)  0

 , e when 1=j1 þ nzj , e or j1 þ nzj . 1=e. Now, j1 þ nzj  j1j þ jnzj ¼ 1 þ njzj
and 1 þ njzj  j1 þ nzj . 1=e for n . (1=e  1=jzj). Thus, the sequence converges to zero for jzj . 2.
To determine whether it converges uniformly to zero, note that the largest value of (1=e  1=jzj)
in jzj  2 occurs for jzj ¼ 2 and is given by 1
2f(1=e)  1g ¼ N. It follows that (1=1 þ nz)  0

 , e for all
n . N where N depends only on e and not on the particular z in jzj  2. Thus, the sequence is
uniformly convergent to zero in this region.
(b) If d is any positive number, the largest value of ((1=e)  1)=jzj in jzj  d occurs for jzj ¼ d and is given by
((1=e)  1)=d. As in part (a), it follows that the sequence converges uniformly to zero for all z such that
jzj  d, i.e., in any region that excludes all points in a neighborhood of z ¼ 0.
Since d can be chosen arbitrarily close to zero, it follows that the region of (a) can be extended
considerably.
6.5. Show that (a) the sum function in Problem 6.2 is discontinuous at z ¼ 1, (b) the limit in Problem 6.4
is discontinuous at z ¼ 0.
Solution
(a) From Problem 6.2, Sn(z) ¼ z  znþ1, S(z) ¼ limn!1 Sn(z). If jzj , 1, S(z) ¼ limn!1 Sn(z) ¼ z. If z ¼ 1,
Sn(z) ¼ Sn(1) ¼ 0 and limn!1 Sn(1) ¼ 0. Hence, S(z) is discontinuous at z ¼ 1.
(b) From Problem 6.4, if we write un(z) ¼ 1=1 þ nz and U(z) ¼ limn!1 un(z), we have U(z) ¼ 0 if z=0 and 1
if z ¼ 0. Thus, U(z) is discontinuous at z ¼ 0.
These are consequences of the fact [see Problem 6.16] that if a series of continuous functions is uniformly
convergent in a region R, then the sum function must be continuous in R. Hence, if the sum function is not
continuous, the series cannot be uniformly convergent. A similar result holds for sequences.
6.6. Prove that the series of Problem 6.2 is absolutely convergent for jzj , 1.
Solution
Let Tn(z) ¼ jz(1  z)j þ jz2(1  z)j þ    þ jzn(1  z)j ¼ j1  zjfjzj þ jzj2 þ jzj3 þ    þ jzjng
¼ j1  zjjzj 1  jzjn
1  jzj


If jzj , 1, then limn!1 jzjn ¼ 0 and limn!1 Tn(z) exists so that the series converges absolutely.
Note that the series of absolute values converges in this case to j1  zjjzj=1  jzj.

(i.e., establish the comparison test for convergence).

Let Sn ¼ ju1j þ ju2j þ    þ junj, Tn ¼ jv1j þ jv2j þ    þ jvnj.
Since P jvnj converges, limn!1 Tn exists and equals T, say. Also since jvnj  0, Tn  T.
Then Sn ¼ ju1j þ ju2j þ    þ junj  jv1j þ jv2j þ    þ jvnj  T or 0  Sn  T.
Thus, Sn is a bounded monotonic increasing sequence and must have a limit [Theorem 6.3, page 171],
i.e., P junj converges.

By using a method analogous to that used here together with the comparison test for divergence [Theorem
6.10(b), page 171], we can show that P1
n¼1 1=np diverges for p  1.
6.9. Prove that an absolutely convergent series is convergent.
Solution
Given that P junj converges, we must show that P un converges. Let
SM ¼ u1 þ u2 þ    þ uM
and
TM ¼ ju1j þ ju2j þ    þ juMj
Then
SM þ TM ¼ (u1 þ ju1j) þ (u2 þ ju2j) þ    þ (uM þ juMj)
 2ju1j þ 2ju2j þ    þ 2juMj
Since P junj converges and un þ junj  0 for n ¼ 1, 2, 3, . . . , it follows that SM þ TM is a bounded
monotonic increasing sequence and so limM!1 (SM þ TM) exists.
Also since limM!1 TM exists [because, by hypothesis, the series is absolutely convergent],
lim
M!1 SM ¼ lim
M!1 (SM þ TM  TM) ¼ lim
M!1 (SM þ TM)  lim
M!1 TM
must also exist and the result is proved.

Taking un ¼ zn=n(n þ 1), vn ¼ 1=n2 in the comparison test and recognizing that P 1=n2 converges by
Problem 6.8 with p ¼ 2, we see that P junj converges, i.e., P un converges absolutely.

6.11. Establish the ratio test for convergence.
Solution
We must show that if limn!1 unþ1=un

(absolutely) convergent.
By hypothesis, we can choose an integer N so large that for all n  N, unþ1=un

constant such that L , r , 1. Then
juNþ1j  rjuNj

etc. By addition,
juNþ1j þ juNþ2j þ     juNj(r þ r2 þ r3 þ    )
and so P junj converges by the comparison test since 0 , r , 1.

Solution
If un ¼ (z þ 2)n1

Then the series converges (absolutely) for jz þ 2j=4 , 1, i.e.,

If jz þ 2j=4 ¼ 1, i.e., jz þ 2j ¼ 4, the ratio test fails. However,

and since P 1=n3 converges [p series with p ¼ 3], the given

It follows that the given series converges (absolutely) for
jz þ 2j  4. Geometrically, this is the set of all points inside and on the circle of radius 4 with center at

for all ﬁnite z. Thus the series converges (absolutely) for all z, and we say that the series converges for

But Mnþ1 þ Mnþ2 þ    can be made less than e by choosing n . N, since P Mn converges. Since N is clearly
independent of z, we have jRn(z)j , e for n . N, and the series is uniformly convergent. The absolute conver-
gence follows at once from the comparison test.

Since P1

converges uniformly (and absolutely) for 1 , jzj , 2.
Note that the convergence, and thus uniform convergence, breaks down if jzj ¼ 1 or jzj ¼ 2 [namely at

cannot converge for y . 0 and y , 0, respectively [since, in these cases, the nth term does not approach
zero]. Hence, the series does not converge for all z such that jzj  1, and so cannot possibly be uniformly
convergent in this region.
The series does converge for y ¼ 0, i.e., if z is real. In this case, z ¼ x and the series becomes
P1
n¼1 cos nx=n3. Then, since cos nx=n3

  1=n3 and P1
n¼1 1=n3 converges, it follows from the Weier-
strass M test (with Mn ¼ 1=n3) that the given series converges uniformly in any interval on the real axis.
6.16. Prove Theorem 6.18, page 172, i.e., if un(z), n ¼ 1, 2, 3, . . . , are continuous in R and P1
n¼1 un(z) is
uniformly convergent to S(z) in R, then S(z) is continuous in R.
Solution
If Sn(z) ¼ u1(z) þ u2(z) þ    þ un(z), and Rn(z) ¼ unþ1(z) þ unþ2(z) þ    is the remainder after n terms, it is
clear that
S(z) ¼ Sn(z) þ Rn(z)
and
S(z þ h) ¼ Sn(z þ h) þ Rn(z þ h)
and so
S(z þ h)  S(z) ¼ Sn(z þ h)  Sn(z) þ Rn(z þ h)  Rn(z)
(1)
where z and z þ h are in R.
Since Sn(z) is the sum of a ﬁnite number of continuous functions, it must also be continuous. Then, given
e . 0, we can ﬁnd d so that
jSn(z þ h)  Sn(z)j , e=3
whenever jhj , d
(2)
Since the series, by hypothesis, is uniformly convergent, we can choose N so that for all z in R,
jRn(z)j , e=3
and
jRn(z þ h)j , e=3
for n > N
(3)
Then, from (1), (2), and (3),
jS(z þ h)  S(z)j  jSn(z þ h)  Sn(z)j þ jRn(z þ h)j þ jRn(z)j , e
for jhj , d and all z in R, and so the continuity is established.
6.17. Prove Theorem 6.19, page 172, i.e., suppose fun(z)g, n ¼ 1, 2, 3, . . ., are continuous in R,
S(z) ¼ P1

As in Problem 6.16, we have S(z) ¼ Sn(z) þ Rn(z) and, since these are continuous in R [by Problem 6.16], their
integrals exist, i.e.,
ð

Theorems on Power Series
6.18. Suppose a power series P anzn converges for z ¼ z0=0. Prove that it converges:
(a) absolutely for jzj , jz0j,
(b) uniformly for jzj  jz1j where jz1j , jz0j.
Solution
(a) Since P anzn
0 converges, limn!1 anzn
0 ¼ 0 and so we can make janzn
0j , 1 by choosing n large enough, i.e.,
janj , 1=jz0jn for n . N. Then

1
Nþ1
janznj ¼
X

Nþ1
janjjzjn 
X

Nþ1
jzjn
jz0jn
(1)
But the last series in (1) converges for jzj , jz0j and so, by the comparison test, the ﬁrst series converges,
i.e., the given series is absolutely convergent.
(b) Let Mn ¼ jz1jn=jz0jn. Then P Mn converges, since jz1j , jz0j. As in part (a), janznj , Mn for jzj  jz1j so
that, by the Weierstrass M test, P anzn is uniformly convergent.
It follows that a power series is uniformly convergent in any region that lies entirely inside its circle of
convergence.
6.19. Prove that both the power series P1
n¼0 anzn and the corresponding series of derivatives
P1
n¼0 nanzn1 have the same radius of convergence.
Solution
Let R . 0 be the radius of convergence of P anzn. Let 0 , jz0j , R. Then, as in Problem 6.18, we can choose
N so that janj , 1=jz0jn for n . N.
Thus the terms of the series P jnanzn1j ¼ P njanjjzjn1 can for n . N be made less than corresponding
terms of the series P n(jzjn1=jz0jn), which converges, by the ratio test, for jzj , jz0j , R.
Hence, P nanzn1 converges absolutely for all points such that jzj , jz0j (no matter how close jz0j is to R),
i.e., for jzj , R.
If, however, jzj . R, limn!1 anzn=0 and thus limn!1 nanzn1 =0, so that P nanzn1 does not converge.
Thus, R is the radius of convergence of P nanzn1. This is also true if R ¼ 0.
Note that the series of derivatives may or may not converge for values of z such that jzj ¼ R.
6.20. Prove that in any region, which lies entirely within its circle of convergence, a power series (a) rep-
resents a continuous function, say f(z), (b) can be integrated term by term to yield the integral of f(z),
(c) can be differentiated term by term to yield the derivative of f(z).
Solution
We consider the power series P anzn, although analogous results hold for P an(z  a)n.
(a) This follows from Problem 6.16 and the fact that each term anzn of the series is continuous.
(b) This follows from Problem 6.17 and the fact that each term anzn of the series is continuous and thus
integrable.
(c) From Problem 6.19, the derivative of a power series converges within the circle of convergence of the
original power series and therefore is uniformly convergent in any region entirely within the circle of con-
vergence. Thus, the required result follows from Theorem 6.20, page 172.
6.21. Prove that the series P1
n¼1 zn=n2 has a ﬁnite value at all points inside and on its circle of convergence
but that is not true for the series of derivatives.
Solution
By the ratio test, the series converges for jzj , 1 and diverges for jzj . 1. If jzj ¼ 1, then jzn=n2j ¼ 1=n2 and
the series is convergent (absolutely). Thus, the series converges for jzj  1 and so has a ﬁnite value inside and
on its circle of convergence.
CHAPTER 6

The series of derivatives is P1
n¼1 zn1=n. By the ratio test, the series converges for jzj , 1. However, the
series does not converge for all z such that jzj ¼ 1, for example, if z ¼ 1, the series diverges.

6.22. Prove Taylor’s theorem: If f(z) is analytic inside a circle C with center at a, then for all z inside C,

CHAPTER 6

Solution
(a) By the ratio test, the series converges for jzj , 2 (shaded in Fig. 6-6). In this circle, the series, which is a
geometric series with ﬁrst term 1
2 and ratio z=2 can be summed and represents the function
1=2

 , 1, i.e., jz  ij ,
ﬃﬃﬃ
5
p
(see Fig. 6-6). In
this circle, the series, which is a geometric series with
ﬁrst term 1=(2  i) and ratio (z  i)=(2  i), can be
summed and represents the function
1=(2  i)
1  (z  i)=(2  i) ¼
1
2  z
Since the power series represent, the same function in
the regions common to the interiors of the circles jzj ¼ 2
and jz  ij ¼
ﬃﬃﬃ
5
p
, it follows that they are analytic continu-
ations of each other.
6.30. Prove that the series 1 þ z þ z2 þ z4 þ z8 þ    ¼ 1 þ P1
n¼0 z2n cannot be continued analytically
beyond jzj ¼ 1.
Solution
Let F(z) ¼ 1 þ z þ z2 þ z4 þ z8 þ    . Then,
F(z) ¼ z þ F(z2);
F(z) ¼ z þ z2 þ F(z4);
F(z) ¼ z þ z2 þ z4 þ F(z8) þ    :
From these, it is clear that the values of z given by z ¼ 1, z2 ¼ 1, z4 ¼ 1, z8 ¼ 1, . . . are all singularities of
F(z). These singularities all lie on the circle jzj ¼ 1. Given any small arc of this circle, there will be inﬁnitely
many such singularities. These represent an impassable barrier and analytic continuation beyond jzj ¼ 1 is
therefore impossible. The circle jzj ¼ 1 constitutes a natural boundary.
Miscellaneous Problems
6.31. Let f fk(z)g, k ¼ 1, 2, 3, . . . be a sequence of functions analytic in a region R. Suppose that
F(z) ¼
X
1
k¼1
fk(z)
is uniformly convergent in R. Prove that F(z) is analytic in R.
Solution
Let Sn(z) ¼ Pn
k¼1 fk(z). By deﬁnition of uniform convergence, given any e . 0, we can ﬁnd a positive integer
N depending on e and not on z such that for all z in R,
jF(z)  Sn(z)j , e
for all n > N
(1)
Now suppose that C is any simple closed curve lying entirely in R and denote its length by L. Then, by
Problem 6.16, since fk(z), k ¼ 1, 2, 3, . . . are continuous, F(z) is also continuous so that Þ
C F(z) dz exists.

But, by Cauchy’s theorem,
Þ

þ
C
F(z) dz ¼ 0
and so by Morera’s theorem (page 145, Chapter 5), F(z) must be analytic.
6.32. Prove that an analytic function cannot be bounded in the neighborhood of an isolated singularity.
Solution
Let f(z) be analytic inside and on a circle C of radius r, except at the isolated singularity z ¼ a taken to be the
center of C. Then, by Laurent’s theorem, f(z) has a Laurent expansion
f(z) ¼

Hence, since r can be made arbitrarily small, we have an ¼ 0, n ¼ 1, 2, 3, . . . , i.e., a1 ¼ a2 ¼ a3 ¼
   ¼ 0, and the Laurent series reduces to a Taylor series about z ¼ a. This shows that f(z) is analytic at
z ¼ a so that z ¼ a is not a singularity, contrary to hypothesis. This contradiction shows that f(z) cannot be
bounded in the neighborhood of an isolated singularity.

have a Laurent series expansion of the form
e1=2a(z1=z) ¼

Let f(z) be single-valued and analytic inside and on a circle C except at the point z ¼ a chosen as the center

(7:4)
Because of the fact that (7.3) involves only the coefﬁcient a1 in (7.1), we call a1 the residue of f(z) at
z ¼ a.
7.2
Calculation of Residues
To obtain the residue of a function f(z) at z ¼ a, it may appear from (7.1) that the Laurent expansion of f(z)
about z ¼ a must be obtained. However, in the case where z ¼ a is a pole of order k, there is a simple
205

formula for a1 given by
a1 ¼ lim
z!a
1
(k  1)!
dk1
dzk1 f(z  a)kf(z)g
(7:5)
If k ¼ 1 (simple pole), then the result is especially simple and is given by
a1 ¼ lim
z!a (z  a) f(z)
(7:6)
which is a special case of (7.5) with k ¼ 1 if we deﬁne 0! ¼ 1.
EXAMPLE 7.1:
If f(z) ¼ z=(z  1)(z þ 1)2, then z ¼ 1 and z ¼ 1 are poles of orders one and two, respectively.
We have, using (7.6) and (7.5) with k ¼ 2,
Residue at z ¼ 1 is lim

If z ¼ a is an essential singularity, the residue can sometimes be found by using known series
expansions.
EXAMPLE 7.2:
Let f(z) ¼ e1=z. Then, z ¼ 0 is an essential singularity and from the known expansion for eu
with u ¼ 1=z, we ﬁnd
e1=z ¼ 1  1
z þ 1
2!z2  1
3!z3 þ   
from which we see that the residue at z ¼ 0 is the coefﬁcient of 1/z and equals 1.
7.3
The Residue Theorem
Let f(z) be single-valued and analytic inside and on a simple closed curve C except at the singularities
a, b, c, . . . inside C, which have residues given by a1, b1, c1, . . . [see Fig. 7-1]. Then, the residue
theorem states that
þ
C
f(z) dz ¼ 2pi(a1 þ b1 þ c1 þ    )
(7:7)
i.e., the integral of f(z) around C is 2pi times the sum of the residues of f(z) at the singularities enclosed by
C. Note that (7.7) is a generalization of (7.3). Cauchy’s theorem and integral formulas are special cases of
this theorem (see Problem 7.75).

Special Theorems Used in Evaluating Integrals
In evaluating integrals such as those of Types 1 and 3 above, it is often necessary to show that Ð

Ð
G eimzF(z) dz approach zero as R ! 1. The following theorems are fundamental.

If F(x) is continuous in a  x  b except at a point x0 such that a , x0 , b, then if e1 and e2 are positive,

a  x  b, a1  a  a2. It can be extended to cases where the limits a and b are inﬁnite or dependent on a.

SOLVED PROBLEMS
Residues and the Residue Theorem
7.1. Let f(z) be analytic inside and on a simple closed curve C except at point a inside C.
(a) Prove that
f(z) ¼

an(z  a)n
where an ¼ 1
2pi
þ
C
f(z)
(z  a)nþ1 dz, n ¼ 0, +1, +2, . . .
i.e., f(z) can be expanded into a converging Laurent series about z ¼ a.
(b) Prove that
þ
C
f(z) dz ¼ 2pia1
Solution
(a)
This follows from Problem 6.25 of Chapter 6.
(b)
If we let n ¼ 1 in the result of (a), we ﬁnd
a1 ¼ 1
2pi
þ
C
f(z) dz,
i:e:,
þ
C
f(z) dz ¼ 2pia1
We call a1 the residue of f(z) at z ¼ a.
7.2. Prove the residue theorem. If f(z) is analytic
inside and on a simple closed curve C except at
a ﬁnite number of points a, b, c, . . . inside C at
which the residues are a1, b1, c1, . . .,
respectively, then
þ
C
f(z) dz ¼ 2pi(a1 þ b1 þ c1 þ    )
i.e., 2pi times the sum of the residues at all
singularities enclosed by C.
Solution
With centers at a, b, c, . . ., respectively, construct
circles C1, C2, C3, . . . that lie entirely inside C as
shown in Fig. 7-4. This can be done since a, b, c, . . .
are interior points. By Theorem 4.5, page 118, we have

þ

f(z) dz ¼ 2pib1,
þ
C3

Then, from (1) and (2), we have, as required,

CHAPTER 7
The Residue Theorem Evaluation

The proof given here establishes the residue theorem for simply-connected regions containing a ﬁnite
number of singularities of f(z). It can be extended to regions with inﬁnitely many isolated singularities and
to multiply-connected regions (see Problems 7.96 and 7.97).
7.3. Let f(z) be analytic inside and on a simple closed curve C except at a pole a of order m inside C.
Prove that the residue of f(z) at a is given by
a1 ¼ lim
z!a
1
(m  1)!
dm1
dzm1 f(z  a)mf(z)g
Solution
Method 1. Suppose f(z) has a pole a of order m. Then the Laurent series of f(z) is
f(z) ¼
am
(z  a)m þ
amþ1
(z  a)m1 þ    þ a1
z  a þ a0 þ a1(z  a) þ a2(z  a)2 þ   
(1)
Then multiplying both sides by (z  a)m, we have
(z  a)mf(z) ¼ am þ amþ1(z  a) þ    þ a1(z  a)m1 þ a0(z  a)m þ   
(2)
This represents the Taylor series about z ¼ a of the analytic function on the left. Differentiating both sides
m  1 times with respect to z, we have
dm1
dzm1 f(z  a)mf(z)g ¼ (m  1)!a1 þ m(m  1)    2a0(z  a) þ   
Thus, on letting z ! a,
lim
z!a
dm1
dzm1 f(z  a)mf(z)g ¼ (m  1) ! a1
from which the required result follows.
Method 2. The required result also follows directly from Taylor’s theorem on noting that the coefﬁcient of
(z  a)m1 in the expansion (2) is
a1 ¼

using L’Hospital’s rule. In a similar manner, or by replacing i by i in the result, we can obtain the residue
at z ¼ 2i.

using L’Hospital’s rule several times. In evaluating this limit, we can instead use the series expansions
sin u ¼ u  u3=3! þ    , cos u ¼ 1  u2=2! þ   .
Method 2 (using Laurent’s series).
In this method, we expand f(z) ¼ ez csc2 z in a Laurent series about z ¼ mp and obtain the coefﬁcient of
1=(z  mp) as the required residue. To make the calculation easier, let z ¼ u þ mp. Then, the function to
be expanded in a Laurent series about u ¼ 0 is empþu csc2(mp þ u) ¼ empeu csc2 u. Using the Maclaurin

The method of Problem 7.16 leads us to consider the integral of eiz=z around the contour of Fig. 7-5. However,
since z ¼ 0 lies on this path of integration and since we cannot integrate through a singularity, we modify that

Case 1: y . 1

Case 2: y , 1
2. Here, as in Case 1,
jcot pzj  jepixpyj þ jepixþpyj

1  ep ¼ A1
Case 3: 1
2  y  1
2. Consider z ¼ N þ 1
2 þ iy. Then
jcot pzj ¼ jcot p(N þ 1
2 þ iy)j ¼ jcot(p=2 þ piy)j ¼ jtanh p yj  tanh(p=2) ¼ A2
If z ¼ N  1
2 þ iy, we have similarly
jcot pzj ¼ jcot p (N  1
2 þ iy)j ¼ jtanh p yj  tanh(p=2) ¼ A2
Thus, if we choose A as a number greater than the larger of A1 and A2, we have jcot pzj , A on CN where A
is independent of N. It is of interest to note that we actually have jcot pzj  A1 ¼ coth(p=2) since A2 , A1.
7.25. Let f(z) be such that along the path CN of Fig. 7-13, j f(z)j  M=jzjk where k . 1 and M are con-

f(n) ¼ fsum of residues of p cot pzf(z) at the poles of f(z)g
Solution
Case 1: f(z) has a ﬁnite number of poles.
In this case, we can choose N so large that the path CN of Fig. 7-13 encloses all poles of f(z). The poles of
cot pz are simple and occur at z ¼ 0, +1, +2, . . ..
Residue of p cot pz f(z) at z ¼ n, n ¼ 0, +1, +2, . . ., is

Thus, from (1) we have as required,

Case 2: f(z) has inﬁnitely many poles.
If f(z) has an inﬁnite number of poles, we can obtain the required result by an appropriate limiting pro-
cedure. See Problem 7.103.

Similarly, the residue at z ¼ ai is (p=2a) coth pa, and the sum of the residues is (p=a) coth pa. Then, by

C H A P T E R 8
Conformal Mapping
8.1
Transformations or Mappings
The set of equations
u ¼ u(x, y)
v ¼ v(x, y)
(8:1)
deﬁnes, in general, a transformation or mapping, which establishes a correspondence between points in the
uv and xy planes. The equations (8.1) are called transformation equations. If to each point of the uv plane,
there corresponds one and only one point of the xy plane, and conversely, we speak of a one-to-one trans-
formation or mapping. In such a case, a set of points in the xy plane (such as a curve or region) is mapped
into a set of points in the uv plane (curve or region) and conversely. The corresponding sets of points in the
two planes are often called images of each other.
8.2
Jacobian of a Transformation
Under the transformation (8.1), a region R of the xy plane is, in general, mapped into a region R0 of the uv
plane. Then, if DAxy and DAuv denote, respectively, the areas of these regions, we can show that if u and v are
continuously differentiable,
lim DAuv
DAxy
¼ @(u, v)
@(x, y)


(8:2)
where lim denotes the limit as DAxy (or DAuv) approaches zero and where the determinant

¼ @u
@x
@v
@y  @u
@y

(8:3)
is called the Jacobian of the transformation (8.1).
If we solve (1) for x and y in terms of u and v, we obtain the transformation x ¼ x(u, v), y ¼ y(u, v), often
called the inverse transformation corresponding to (8.1). If x and y are single-valued and continuously dif-
ferentiable, the Jacobian of this transformation is @(x, y)=@(u, v) and can be shown equal to the reciprocal of
@(u, v)=@(x, y) (see Problem 8.7). Thus, if one Jacobian is different from zero in a region, so also is the other.
Conversely, we can show that if u and v are continuously differentiable in a region R and if the Jacobian
@(u, v)=@(x, y) does not vanish in R, then the transformation (8.1) is one-to-one.
242

8.3
Complex Mapping Functions
A case of special interest occurs when u and v are real and imaginary parts of an analytic function of a
complex variable z ¼ x þ iy, i.e., w ¼ u þ iv ¼ f(z) ¼ f(x þ iy). In such a case, the Jacobian of the trans-
formation is given by
@(u, v)
@(x, y) ¼ j f 0(z)j2
(8:4)
(see Problem 8.5). It follows that the transformation is one-to-one in regions where f 0(z) = 0. Points where
f 0(z) ¼ 0 are called critical points.
8.4
Conformal Mapping
Suppose that under transformation (8.1), point (x0, y0) of the xy plane is mapped into point (u0, v0) of the uv
plane (Figs. 8-1 and 8-2) while curves C1 and C2 [intersecting at (x0, y0)] are mapped, respectively, into
curves C0
1 and C0
2 [intersecting at (u0, v0)]. Then, if the transformation is such that the angle at (x0, y0)
between C1 and C2 is equal to the angle at (u0, v0) between C0
1 and C0
2 both in magnitude and sense, the
transformation or mapping is said to be conformal at (x0, y0). A mapping that preserves the magnitudes
of angles but not necessarily the sense is called isogonal.

The following theorem is fundamental.
THEOREM. 8.1:
If f(z) is analytic and f 0(z)=0 in a region R, then the mapping w ¼ f(z) is conformal at
all points of R.
For conformal mappings or transformations, small ﬁgures in the neighborhood of a point z0 in the z plane
map into similar small ﬁgures in the w plane and are magniﬁed (or reduced) by an amount given approxi-
mately by j f 0(z0)j2, called the area magniﬁcation factor or simply magniﬁcation factor. Short distances in
the z plane in the neighborhood of z0 are magniﬁed (or reduced) in the w plane by an amount given approxi-
mately by j f 0(z0)j, called the linear magniﬁcation factor. Large ﬁgures in the z plane usually map into
ﬁgures in the w plane that are far from similar.
8.5
Riemann’s Mapping Theorem
Let C (Fig. 8-3) be a simple closed curve in the z plane forming the boundary of a simply connected region
R. Let C0 (Fig. 8-4) be a circle of radius one and center at the origin [the unit circle] forming the boundary
of region R0 in the w plane. The region R0 is sometimes called the unit disk. Then Riemann’s mapping
CHAPTER 8
Conformal Mapping
243

theorem states that there exists a function w ¼ f(z), analytic in R, which maps each point of R into a
corresponding point of R0 and each point of C into a corresponding point of C0, the correspondence
being one-to-one and onto, i.e., every point of R0 is the image of exactly one point of R.
z plane

C'

Fig. 8-3
Fig. 8-4
This function f(z) contains three arbitrary real constants that can be determined by making the center of
C0 correspond to some given point in R, while some point on C0 corresponds to a given point on C. It should
be noted that while Riemann’s mapping theorem demonstrates the existence of a mapping function, it does
not actually produce this function.
It is possible to extend Riemann’s mapping theorem to the case where a region bounded by two simple
closed curves, one inside the other, is mapped onto a region bounded by two concentric circles. Also, any
simply connected region that is not the whole x-y plane can be mapped conformally onto the unit disk. For
example, the upper half plane can be mapped conformally onto the unit disk (see Section 8.11).
8.6
Fixed or Invariant Points of a Transformation
Suppose that we superimpose the w plane on the z plane so that the coordinate axes coincide and there is
essentially only one plane. Then we can think of the transformation w ¼ f(z) as taking certain points of the
plane into other points. Points for which z ¼ f(z) are called the ﬁxed or invariant points of the
transformation.
EXAMPLE 8.1:
The ﬁxed or invariant points of the transformation w ¼ z2 are solutions of z2 ¼ z, i.e., z ¼ 0, 1.
8.7
Some General Transformations
In the following, a, b are given complex constants while a, u0 are real constants.
1.
Translation. w ¼ z þ b
By this transformation, ﬁgures in the z plane are displaced or translated in the direction of
vector b.
2.
Rotation. w ¼ eiu0z
By this transformation, ﬁgures in the z plane are rotated through an angle u0. If u0 . 0, the
rotation is counterclockwise while, if u0 , 0, the rotation is clockwise.

CHAPTER 8
Conformal Mapping

3.
Stretching. w ¼ az
By this transformation, ﬁgures in the z plane are stretched (or contracted) in the direction z if
a . 1 (or 0 , a , 1). We consider contraction as a special case of stretching.
4.
Inversion. w ¼ 1=z
8.8
Successive Transformations
If w ¼ f1(z) maps region Rz of the z plane into region Rw of the w plane while z ¼ f2(z) maps region Rz of
the z plane into region Rz, then w ¼ f1[f2(z)] maps Rz into Rw. The functions f1 and f2 deﬁne successive
transformations from one plane to another, which are equivalent to a single transformation. These ideas
are easily generalized.
8.9
The Linear Transformation
The transformation
w ¼ az þ b
(8:5)
where a and b are given complex constants, is called a linear transformation. Letting a ¼ aeiu0, we see that
a general linear transformation is a combination of the transformations of translation, rotation, and
stretching.
8.10
The Bilinear or Fractional Transformation
The transformation
w ¼ az þ b
gz þ d ,
ad  bg=0
(8:6)
is called a bilinear or fractional transformation. This transformation can be considered as a combination of
the transformations of translation, rotation, stretching, and inversion.
The transformation (8.6) has the property that circles in the z plane are mapped into circles in the w plane,
where by circles we include circles of inﬁnite radius that are straight lines. See Problems 8.14 and 8.15.
The transformation maps any three distinct points of the z plane into three distinct points of the w plane,
one of which may be at inﬁnity.
If z1, z2, z3, z4 are distinct, then the quantity
(z4  z1)(z2  z3)
(z2  z1)(z4  z3)
(8:7)
is called the cross ratio of z1, z2, z3, z4. This ratio is invariant under the bilinear transformation, and this
property can be used in obtaining speciﬁc bilinear transformations mapping three points into three other
points.

8.11
Mapping of a Half Plane onto a Circle
Let z0 be any point P in the upper half of the z plane denoted by R in Fig. 8-5. Then, the transformation
w ¼ eiu0 z  z0
z  z0


(8:8)
maps this upper half plane in a one-to-one manner onto the interior R0 of the unit circle jwj ¼ 1. Each point
of the x axis is mapped to the boundary of the circle. The constant u0 can be determined by making one
particular point of the x axis correspond to a given point on the circle.
In the above ﬁgures, we have used the convention that unprimed points such as A, B, C, etc., in the z plane
correspond to primed points A0, B0, C0, etc., in the w plane. Also, in the case where points are at inﬁnity, we
indicate this by an arrow such as at A and F in Fig. 8-5, which correspond, respectively, to A0 and F0 (the
same point) in Fig. 8-6. As point z moves on the boundary of R [i.e., the real axis] from 1 (point A) to þ1
(point F), w moves counterclockwise along the unit circle from A0 back to A0.

The Schwarz–Christoffel Transformation
Consider a polygon [Fig. 8-7] in the w plane having vertices at w1, w2, . . . , wn with corresponding interior
angles a1, a2, . . . , an, respectively. Let the points w1, w2, . . . , wn be the images, respectively, of the points
x1, x2, . . . , xn on the real axis of the z plane [Fig. 8-8].

CHAPTER 8
Conformal Mapping

A transformation that maps the upper half R of the z plane onto the interior R0 of the polygon of the w
plane and the real axis onto the boundary of the polygon is given by
dw
dz ¼ A(z  x1)a1=p1(z  x2)a2=p1    (z  xn)an=p1
(8:9)
or
w ¼ A
ð
(z  x1)a1=p1(z  x2)a2=p1    (z  xn)an=p1dz þ B
(8:10)
where A and B are complex constants.
The following facts should be noted:
1.
Any three of the points x1, x2, . . . , xn can be chosen at will.
2.
The constants A and B determine the size, orientation, and position of the polygon.
3.
It is convenient to choose one point, say xn, at inﬁnity in which case the last factor of (8.9) and
(8.10) involving xn is not present.
4.
Inﬁnite open polygons can be considered as limiting cases of closed polygons.
8.13
Transformations of Boundaries in Parametric Form
Suppose that in the z plane a curve C [Fig. 8-9], which may or may not be closed, has parametric equations
given by
x ¼ F(t), y ¼ G(t)
(8:11)
where we assume that F and G are continuously differentiable. Then, the transformation
z ¼ F(w) þ iG(w)
(8:12)
maps the real axis C0 [Fig. 8-10] of the w plane onto C.

Some Special Mappings
For reference purposes, we list here some special mappings that are useful in practice. For convenience, that
we have listed separately the mapping functions that map the given region R of the w or z plane onto the
upper half of the z or w plane or the unit circle in the z or w plane, depending on which mapping function is
simpler. As we have already seen, there exists a transformation [equation (8.8)] that maps the upper half
plane onto the unit circle.

SOLVED PROBLEMS

8.1. Let the rectangular region R [Fig. 8-61] in the z plane be bounded by x ¼ 0, y ¼ 0, x ¼ 2, y ¼ 1.
Determine the region R0 of the w plane into which R is mapped under the transformations:

Line x ¼ 0 is mapped into u ¼ 1; y ¼ 0 into v ¼ 2; x ¼ 2 into u ¼ 3; y ¼ 1 into v ¼ 1 [Fig. 8-62].
Similarly, we can show that each point of R is mapped into one and only one point of R0 and conversely.

The mapping accomplishes a rotation and stretching as in (b) and a subsequent translation. In general,
the transformation w ¼ az þ b accomplishes a rotation, stretching, and translation. This can be con-
sidered as two successive mappings w ¼ az1 (rotation and stretching) and z1 ¼ z þ b=a (translation).
8.2. Determine the region of the w plane into which each of the following is mapped by the transformation
w ¼ z2. (a) First quadrant of the z plane. (b) Region bounded by x ¼ 1, y ¼ 1, and x þ y ¼ 1.
Solution
(a) Let z ¼ reiu, w ¼ reif. Then if w ¼ z2, reif ¼ r2e2iu and r ¼ r2, f ¼ 2u. Thus points in the z plane at
(r, u) are rotated through angle 2u. Since all points in the ﬁrst quadrant [Fig. 8-67] of the z plane
occupy the region 0  u  p=2, they map into 0  f  p or the upper half of the w plane [Fig. 8-68].

(b) Since w ¼ z2 is equivalent to u þ iv ¼ (x þ iy)2 ¼ x2  y2 þ 2ixy, we see that u ¼ x2  y2, v ¼ 2xy. Then
line x ¼ 1 maps into u ¼ 1  y2, v ¼ 2y or u ¼ 1  v2=4; line y ¼ 1 into u ¼ x2  1, v ¼ 2x or
u ¼ v2=4  1; line x þ y ¼ 1 or y ¼ 1  x into u ¼ x2  (1  x)2 ¼ 2x  1, v ¼ 2x(1  x) ¼ 2x  2x2 or

The regions appear shaded in Figs. 8-69 and 8-70 where points A, B, C map into A0, B0, C0. Note that the
angles of triangle ABC are equal, respectively, to the angles of curvilinear triangle A0B0C0. This is a conse-
quence of the fact that the mapping is conformal.

Solution
As a point moves from z0 to z0 þ Dz along C, the image point moves along C0 in the w plane from w0 to
w0 þ Dw. If the parameter used to describe the curve is t, then corresponding to the path z ¼ z(t) [or
x ¼ x(t), y ¼ y(t)] in the z plane, we have the path w ¼ w(t) [or u ¼ u(t), v ¼ v(t)] in the w plane.
The derivatives dz/dt and dw/dt represent tangent vectors to corresponding points on C and C0.

Note that if f 0(z0) ¼ 0, then a is indeterminate. Points where f 0(z) ¼ 0 are called critical points.
8.4. Prove that the angle between two curves C1 and C2 passing through the point z0 in the z plane [see
Figs. 8-1 and 8-2, page 243] is preserved [in magnitude and sense] under the transformation
w ¼ f(z), i.e., the mapping is conformal, if f(z) is analytic at z0 and f 0(z0)=0.
Solution
By Problem 8.3, each curve is rotated through the angle arg f 0(z0). Hence, the angle between the curves must be
preserved, both in magnitude and sense, in the mapping.

Geometrically, this shows that any region in the z plane [in particular, rectangular region R of
Fig. 8-65, page 257] is mapped into a region of twice the area. The factor j f 0(z)j2 ¼ 2 is called the
magniﬁcation factor.

Given w ¼ f(z) ¼ z2. Then
@(u, v)
@(x, y) ¼ j f 0(z)j2 ¼ j2zj2 ¼ j2x þ 2iyj2 ¼ 4(x2 þ y2)
Geometrically, a small region in the z plane having area A and at approximate distance r from the
origin would be mapped into a region of the w plane having area 4r2A. Thus regions far from the
origin would be mapped into regions of greater area than similar regions near the origin.
Note that, at the critical point z ¼ 0, the Jacobian is zero. At this point, the transformation is not
conformal.
8.7. Prove that @(u, v)

Solution
Corresponding to the transformation
u ¼ u(x, y),

with Jacobian @(u, v)=@(x, y), we have the inverse transformation

In this case @(u, v)=@(x, y) ¼ j f 0(z)j2 by Problem 8.5. If the inverse to w ¼ f(z) is z ¼ g(w) assumed single-

Bilinear or Fractional Transformations
8.9. Find a bilinear transformation that maps points z1, z2, z3 of the z plane into points w1, w2, w3 of the
w plane, respectively.
Solution
If wk corresponds to zk, k ¼ 1, 2, 3, we have
w  wk ¼ az þ b
gz þ d  azk þ b
gzk þ d ¼ (ad  bg)(z  zk)
(gz þ d)(gzk þ d)
Then
w  w1 ¼ (ad  bg)(z  z1)
(gz þ d)(gz1 þ d) ,
w  w3 ¼ (ad  bg)(z  z3)
(gz þ d)(gz3 þ d)
(1)
Replacing w by w2, and z by z2,
w2  w1 ¼ (ad  bg)(z2  z1)
(gz2 þ d)(gz1 þ d) ,
w2  w3 ¼ (ad  bg)(z2  z3)
(gz2 þ d)(gz3 þ d)
(2)
By division of (1) and (2), assuming ad  bg = 0,
(w  w1)(w2  w3)
(w  w3)(w2  w1) ¼ (z  z1)(z2  z3)
(z  z3)(z2  z1)
(3)
Solving for w in terms of z gives the required transformation. The right hand side of (3) is called the cross ratio
of z1, z2, z3, and z.

8.10. Find a bilinear transformation that maps points z ¼ 0, i, 1 into w ¼ i, 1, 0, respectively.

g(0) þ d
(1)
1 ¼ a(i) þ b
g(i) þ d
(2)
0 ¼ a(1) þ b

8.12. Find a bilinear transformation that maps the upper half of the z plane into the unit circle in the w
plane in such a way that z ¼ i is mapped into w ¼ 0 while the point at inﬁnity is mapped into
w ¼ 1.
Solution
We have w ¼ 0 corresponding to z ¼ i, and w ¼ 1 corresponding to z ¼ 1. Then, from w ¼ eiu0f(z  z0)=
(z  z0)g,
we
have
0 ¼ eiu0f(i  z0)=(i  z0)g
so
that
z0 ¼ i.

Solution
The ﬁxed points are solutions to z ¼ (2z  5)=(z þ 4) or z2 þ 2z þ 5 ¼ 0, i.e., z ¼ 1+2i.
8.14. Prove that the bilinear transformation can be considered as a combination of the transformations of
translation, rotation, stretching, and inversion.
Solution
By division,
w ¼ az þ b
gz þ d ¼ a
g þ bg  ad
g(gz þ d) ¼ l þ
m
z þ n
where l ¼ a=g, m ¼ (bg  ad)=g2 and n ¼ d=g are constants. The transformation is equivalent to z ¼ z þ n,
t ¼ 1=z, and w ¼ l þ mt, which are combinations of the transformations of translation, rotation, stretching,
and inversion.
8.15. Prove that the bilinear transformation transforms circles of the z plane into circles of the w plane
where, by circles, we include circles of inﬁnite radius, which are straight lines.
Solution
The general equation of a circle in the z plane is, by Problem 1.44, Azz þ Bz þ Bz þ C ¼ 0 where A . 0, C . 0
and B is complex. If A ¼ 0, the circle reduces to a straight line.
CHAPTER 8
Conformal Mapping
263

Under the transformation of inversion, w ¼ 1=z or z ¼ 1=w, we have that this equation becomes
Cw w þ Bw þ B w þ A ¼ 0, a circle in the w plane.
Under the transformation of rotation and stretching, w ¼ az or z ¼ w=a, this equation becomes
Aw w þ (Ba)w þ (Ba) w þ Caa ¼ 0, also a circle.
Similarly, we can show either analytically or geometrically that under the transformation of translation,
circles are transformed into circles.
Since, by Problem 8.14, a bilinear transformation can be considered as a combination of translation,
rotation, stretching, and inversion, the required result follows.

Solution

If z ¼ x þ iy, then
w ¼ u þ iv ¼ epz=a ¼ ep(xþiy)=a ¼ epx=a(cos py=a þ i sin py=a)
or
u ¼ epx=a cos py=a,
v ¼ epx=a sin py=a.
The line y ¼ 0 [the real axis in the z plane; DEF in Fig. 8-13] maps into u ¼ epx=a, v ¼ 0 [the positive
real axis in the w plane; D0E0F0 in Fig. 8-14]. The origin E [z ¼ 0] maps into E0 [w ¼ 1] while
D [x ¼ 1, y ¼ 0] and F [x ¼ þ1, y ¼ 0] map into D0 [w ¼ 0] and F0 [w ¼ 1], respectively.
The line y ¼ a [ABC in Fig. 8-13] maps into u ¼ epx=a, v ¼ 0 [the negative real axis in the w plane;
A0B0C0 in Fig. 8-14]. The points A [x ¼ þ1, y ¼ a] and C [x ¼ 1, y ¼ a] map into A0 [w ¼ 1] and
C0 [w ¼ 0], respectively.

Any point interior to the circle ABCD [r , 1] is mapped uniquely into a point exterior to the circle
A0B0C0D0 [r . 1].

The Schwarz–Christoffel Transformation
8.17. Establish the validity of the Schwarz–Christoffel transformation.
Solution
We must show that the mapping function obtained from
dw
dz ¼ A(z  x1)a1=p1(z  x2)a2=p1    (z  xn)an=p1
(1)
maps the real axis of the z plane onto a given polygon of the w plane [Figs. 8-76 and 8-77].
To show this, observe that from (1) we have
arg dw ¼ arg dz þ arg A þ a1
p  1


arg(z  x1) þ a2
p  1


arg(z  x2) þ   
þ an
p  1


arg(z  xn)
(2)
As z moves along the real axis from the left toward x1, let us assume that w moves along a side of the polygon
toward w1. When z crosses from the left of x1 to the right of x1, u1 ¼ arg(z  x1) changes from p to 0 while all
other terms in (2) stay constant. Hence arg dw decreases by (a1=p  1) arg(z  x1) ¼ (a1=p  1)p ¼ a1  p
or, what is the same thing, increases by p  a1 [an increase being in the counterclockwise direction].

It follows from this that the direction through w1 turns through the angle p  a1, and thus w now moves
along the side w1w2 of the polygon.
When z moves through x2, u1 ¼ arg(z  x1) and u2 ¼ arg(z  x2) change from p to 0 while all other terms
stay constant. Hence, another turn through angle p  a2 in the w plane is made. By continuing the process, we
see that as z traverses the x axis, w traverses the polygon, and conversely.
We can actually prove that the upper half plane is mapped onto the interior of the polygon (if it is closed)
by (1) [see Problem 8.26].
8.18. Prove that for closed polygons, the sum of the exponents (a1=p)  1, (a2=p)  1, . . . , (an=p)  1
in the Schwarz–Christoffel transformation (8.9) or (8.10), page 247, is equal to 2.
Solution
The sum of the exterior angles of any closed polygon is 2p. Then
(p  a1) þ (p  a2) þ    þ (p  an) ¼ 2p
and dividing by p, we obtain as required,

chosen at inﬁnity. Show that the last factor is not present.
Solution
In (8.9), page 247, let A ¼ K=(xn)an=p1 where K is a constant. Then, the right side of (9) can be written

8.21. Find a transformation that maps the unit circle in the z plane onto a polygon in the w plane.

and the upper half of the z plane maps onto the interior of the polygon.

z ¼ i  z

(2)
on replacing w by z and taking u ¼ p, z0 ¼ i in equation (8.8), page 246. Hence, z ¼ if(1  z)=(1 þ z)g maps

Transformations of Boundaries in Parametric Form

formation
z ¼ F(w) þ iG(w)
maps the real axis of the w plane onto C.
Solution
Suppose z ¼ x þ iy, w ¼ u þ iv. Then the transformation can be written
x þ iy ¼ F(u þ iv) þ iG(u þ iv)
Then v ¼ 0 [the real axis of the w plane] corresponds to x þ iy ¼ F(u) þ iG(u), i.e., x ¼ F(u), y ¼ G(u), which
represents the curve C.
8.23. Find a transformation that maps the real axis in the w plane onto the ellipse (x2=a2) þ (y2=b2) ¼ 1 in
the z plane.
Solution
A set of parametric equations for the ellipse is given by x ¼ a cos t, y ¼ b sin t where a . 0, b . 0. Then, by
Problem 8.22, the required transformation is z ¼ a cos w þ ib sin w.

In this case, Fig. 8-84 reduces to Fig. 8-86. The result
for this case can be found directly from the
Schwarz–Christoffel transformation by considering
P0Q0S0T0U0 as a polygon with interior angles at Q0,
S0, and T0 equal to p=2, 2p, and p=2, respectively.
8.26. Prove that the Schwarz–Christoffel transformation of Problem 8.17 maps the upper half plane onto
the interior of the polygon.
Solution
It sufﬁces to prove that the transformation maps the unit circle onto the interior of the polygon, since we already
know [Problem 8.11] that the upper half plane can be mapped onto the unit circle.
Suppose that the function mapping the unit circle C in the z plane onto polygon P in the w plane is given by
w ¼ f(z) where f(z) is analytic inside C.
We must now show that to each point a inside P, there corresponds one and only one point, say z0, such that
f(z0) ¼ a.
Now, by Cauchy’s integral formula, since a is inside P,

w  a ¼ 1
Then, since w  a ¼ f(z)  a,

But f(z)  a is analytic inside C. Hence, from Problem 5.17, we have shown that there is only one zero (say z0)
of f(z)  a inside C, i.e., f(z0) ¼ a, as required.

CHAPTER 8
Conformal Mapping

8.27. Let C be a circle in the z plane having its center on the real axis, and suppose further that it passes
through z ¼ 1 and has z ¼ 1 as an interior point. [See Fig. 8-87.] Determine the image of C in the
w plane under the transformation w ¼ f(z) ¼ 1
2 (z þ 1=z).
Solution
We have dw=dz ¼ 1
2 (1  1=z2). Since dw=dz ¼ 0 at z ¼ 1, it follows that z ¼ 1 is a critical point. From the
Taylor series of f(z) ¼ 1
2 (z þ 1=z) about z ¼ 1, we have
w  1 ¼ 1
2 [(z  1)2  (z  1)3 þ (z  1)4     ]
By Problem 8.100, we see that angles with vertices at z ¼ 1 are doubled under the transformation. In particular,
since the angle at z ¼ 1 exterior to C is p, the angle at w ¼ 1 exterior to the image C0 is 2p. Hence, C0 has a
sharp tail at w ¼ 1 (see Fig. 8-88). Other points of C0 can be found directly.

It is of interest to note that in this case, C encloses the circle jzj ¼ 1, which under the transformation is
mapped into the slit from w ¼ 1 to w ¼ 1. Thus, as C approaches jzj ¼ 1, C0 approaches the straight line
joining w ¼ 1 to w ¼ 1.
8.28. Suppose the circle C of Problem 8.27 is moved so that its center is in the upper half plane but that it
still passes through z ¼ 1 and encloses z ¼ 1. Determine the image of C under the transformation
w ¼ 1
2 (z þ 1=z).
Solution
As in Problem 8.27, since z ¼ 1 is a critical point, we will obtain the sharp tail at w ¼ 1 [Fig. 8-90]. If C does
not entirely enclose the circle jzj ¼ 1 [as shown in Fig. 8-89], the image C0 will not entirely enclose the image
of jzj ¼ 1 [which is the slit from w ¼ 1 to w ¼ 1]. Instead, C0 will only enclose that portion of the slit which
corresponds to the part of jzj ¼ 1 inside C. The appearance of C0 is therefore as shown in Fig. 8-90. By chan-
ging C appropriately, other shapes similar to C0 can be obtained.

The fact that C0 resembles the cross-section of the wing of an airplane, sometimes called an airfoil, is
important in aerodynamic theory (see Chapter 9) and was ﬁrst used by Joukowski. For this reason, shapes
such as C0 are called Joukowski airfoils or proﬁles and w ¼ 1
2 (z þ 1=z) is called a Joukowski transformation.

9.1
Boundary Value Problems
Many problems of science and engineering when formulated mathematically lead to partial differential
equations and associated conditions called boundary conditions. The problem of determining solutions
to partial differential equations, which satisfy the boundary conditions, is called a boundary-value problem.
It is of fundamental importance, from a mathematical as well as physical viewpoint, that one should not
only be able to ﬁnd such solutions (i.e., that solutions exist), but that for any given problem there should be
only one solution (i.e., the solution is unique).
9.2
Harmonic and Conjugate Functions
A function satisfying Laplace’s equation
r2F ¼ @2F
@x2 þ @2F
@y2 ¼ 0
(9:1)
in a region R is called harmonic in R. As we have already seen, if f(z) ¼ u(x, y) þ iv(x, y) is analytic in R,
then u and v are harmonic in R.
EXAMPLE 9.1:
Let f(z) ¼ 4z2  3iz ¼ 4(x þ iy)2  3i(x þ iy) ¼ 4x2  4y2 þ 3y þ i(8xy  3x). Then
u ¼ 4x2 4y2 þ 3y, v ¼ 8xy  3x. Since u and v satisfy Laplace’s equation, they are harmonic.
The functions u and v are called conjugate functions; and given one, the other can be determined within
an arbitrary additive constant [see Chapter 3].
9.3
Dirichlet and Neumann Problems
Let R [Fig. 9-1] be a simply-connected region bounded by a simple closed curve C. Two types of boundary-
value problems are of great importance.
(1)
Dirichlet’s problem seeks the determination of a function F that satisﬁes Laplace’s equation
(9.1) [i.e., is harmonic] in R and takes prescribed values on the boundary C.
280

(2)
Neumann’s problem seeks the determination of a function F that satisﬁes Laplace’s equation
(9.1) in R and whose normal derivative @F=@n takes prescribed values on the boundary C.

Fig. 9-1
The region R may be unbounded. For example, R can be the upper half plane with the x axis as the
boundary C.
It can be shown that solutions to both the Dirichlet and Neumann problems exist and are unique [the
Neumann problem within an arbitrary additive constant] under very mild restrictions on the boundary con-
ditions [see Problems 9.29 and 9.80].
It is of interest that a Neumann problem can be stated in terms of an appropriately stated Dirichlet
problem (see Problem 9.79). Hence, if we can solve the Dirichlet problem, we can (at least theoretically)
solve a corresponding Neumann problem.
9.4
The Dirichlet Problem for the Unit Circle. Poisson’s Formula
Let C be the unit circle jzj ¼ 1 and R be its interior. A function that satisﬁes Laplace’s equation [i.e.,
is harmonic] at each point (r, u) in R and takes on the prescribed value F(u) on C [i.e., F(1, u) ¼ F(u)],
is given by

9.5
The Dirichlet Problem for the Half Plane
A function that is harmonic in the half plane y . 0 [Imfzg . 0] and that takes on the prescribed value G(x)
on the x axis [i.e., F(x, 0) ¼ G(x), 1 , x , 1], is given by
F(x, y) ¼ 1

9.6
Solutions to Dirichlet and Neumann Problems by Conformal Mapping
The Dirichlet and Neumann problems can be solved for any simply-connected region R, which can be
mapped conformally by an analytic function onto the interior of a unit circle or half plane. [By Riemann’s
mapping theorem, this can always be accomplished, at least in theory.] The basic ideas involved are as
follows.
(a)
Use the mapping function to transform the boundary-value problem for the region R into a cor-
responding one for the unit circle or half plane.
(b)
Solve the problem for the unit circle or half plane.
(c)
Use the solution in (b) to solve the given problem by employing the inverse mapping function.
Important theorems used in this connection are as follows.
THEOREM 9.1.
Let w ¼ f(z) be analytic and one-to-one in a region R of the z plane. Then there exists a
unique inverse z ¼ g(w) in R, and f 0(z)=0 in R [thus insuring that the mapping is
conformal at each point of R].
THEOREM 9.2.
Let F(x, y) be harmonic in R and suppose that R is mapped one-to-one onto R0 of the
w plane by the mapping function w ¼ f(z), where f(z) is analytic. Then f 0(z)=0,
x ¼ x(u, v), y ¼ y(u, v), and F(x, y) ¼ F[x(u, v), y(u, v)] ; C(u, v) is harmonic in
R0. In other words, a harmonic function is transformed into a harmonic function under
a transformation w ¼ f(z), which is analytic [see Problem 9.4].
THEOREM 9.3.
Suppose F ¼ a [a constant] on the boundary or part of the boundary C of a region in the z
plane. Then C ¼ a on its image C0 in the w plane. Similarly, if the normal derivative of F
is zero, i.e., @F=@n ¼ 0 on C, then the normal derivative of C is zero on C0.
Applications to Fluid Flow
9.7
Basic Assumptions
The solution of many important problems in ﬂuid ﬂow, also referred to as ﬂuid dynamics, hydrodynamics or
aerodynamics, is often achieved by complex variable methods under the following assumptions.
(1)
The ﬂuid ﬂow is two dimensional, i.e., the basic ﬂow pattern and characteristics of the ﬂuid
motion in any plane are essentially the same as in any parallel plane. This permits us to
conﬁne our attention to just a single plane that we take to be the z plane. Figures constructed
in this plane are interpreted as cross-sections of corresponding inﬁnite cylinders perpendicular
to the plane. For example, in Fig. 9-7, page 286, the circle represents an inﬁnite cylindrical
obstacle around which the ﬂuid ﬂows. Naturally, an inﬁnite cylinder is nothing more than a
mathematical model of a physical cylinder which is so long that end effects can be reasonably
neglected.
(2)
The ﬂow is stationary or steady, i.e., the velocity of the ﬂuid at any point depends only on the
position (x, y) and not on time.
(3)
The velocity components are derivable from a potential, i.e., suppose Vx and Vy denote the
components of velocity of the ﬂuid at (x, y) in the positive x and y directions, respectively.
Then there exists a function F, called the velocity potential, such that
Vx ¼ @F
@x ,
Vy ¼ @F
@y
(9:4)
282
CHAPTER 9
Physical Applications of Conformal Mapping

An equivalent assumption is that if C is any simple closed curve in the z plane and Vt is the
tangential component of velocity on C, then
þ
C
Vt ds ¼
þ
C
Vx dx þ Vy dy ¼ 0
(9:5)
See Problem 9.48.
Either of the integrals in (9.5) is called the circulation of the ﬂuid along C. When the circulation
is zero, the ﬂow is called irrotational or circulation free.
(4)
The ﬂuid is incompressible, i.e., the density, or mass per unit volume of the ﬂuid, is constant. If
Vn is the normal component of velocity on C, this leads to the conclusion (see Problem 9.48) that
þ
C
Vn ds ¼
þ
C
Vx dy  Vy dx ¼ 0
(9:6)
or
@Vx
@x þ @Vy
@y ¼ 0
(9:7)
which expresses the condition that the quantity of ﬂuid contained inside C is a constant, i.e., the
quantity entering C is equal to the quantity leaving C. For this reason, equation (9.6), or the equiv-
alent (9.7), is called the equation of continuity.
(5)
The ﬂuid is non-viscous, i.e., has no viscosity or internal friction. A moving viscous ﬂuid tends to
adhere to the surface of an obstacle placed in its path. If there is no viscosity, the pressure forces
on the surface are perpendicular to the surface. A ﬂuid which is non-viscous and incompressible,
is often called an ideal ﬂuid. It must of course be realized that such a ﬂuid is only a mathematical
model of a real ﬂuid in which such effects can be safely assumed negligible.
9.8
The Complex Potential
From (9.4) and (9.7), it is seen that the velocity potential F is harmonic, i.e., satisﬁes Laplace’s equation
@2F
@x2 þ @2F
@y2 ¼ 0
(9:8)
It follows that there must exist a conjugate harmonic function, say C(x, y), such that
V(z) ¼ F(x, y) þ iC(x, y)
(9:9)
is analytic. By differentiation, we have, using (9.4),
dV
dz ¼ V0(z) ¼ @F
@x þ i @C
@x ¼ @F
@x  i @F
@y ¼ Vx  iVy
(9:10)
Thus, the velocity [sometimes called the complex velocity] is given by
V ¼ Vx þ iVy ¼ dV=dz ¼ V0(z)
(9:11)
and has magnitude
V ¼ jVj ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
V2
x þ V2
y
q
¼ jV0(z)j ¼ jV0(z)j
(9:12)
Points at which the velocity is zero, i.e., V0(z) ¼ 0, are called stagnation points.
The function V(z), of fundamental importance in characterizing a ﬂow, is called the complex potential.
CHAPTER 9

9.9
Equipotential Lines and Streamlines
The one parameter families of curves
F(x, y) ¼ a,
C(x, y) ¼ b
(9:13)
where a and b are constants, are orthogonal families called, respectively, the equipotential lines and
streamlines of the ﬂow [although the more appropriate terms equipotential curves and stream curves are
sometimes used]. In steady motion, streamlines represent the actual paths of ﬂuid particles in the ﬂow
pattern.
The function C is called the stream function while, as already seen, the function F is called the velocity
potential function or simply the velocity potential.
9.10
Sources and Sinks
In the above development of theory, we assumed that there were no points in the z plane [i.e., lines in the
ﬂuid] at which ﬂuid appears or disappears. Such points are called sources and sinks, respectively [also
called line sources and line sinks]. At such points, which are singular points, the equation of continuity
(9.7), and hence (9.8), fail to hold. In particular, the circulation integral in (9.5) may not be zero around
closed curves C that include such points.
No difﬁculty arises in using the above theory, however, provided we introduce the proper singularities
into the complex potential V(z) and note that equations such as (9.7) and (9.8) then hold in any region that
excludes these singular points.
9.11
Some Special Flows
Theoretically, any complex potential V(z) can be associated with, or interpreted as, a particular two-
dimensional ﬂuid ﬂow. The following are some simple cases arising in practice. [Note that a constant
can be added to all complex potentials without affecting the ﬂow pattern.]
(1)
Uniform Flow. The complex potential corresponding to the ﬂow of a ﬂuid at constant speed V0 in
a direction making an angle d with the positive x direction is (Fig. 9-2)

Source at z ¼ a. If ﬂuid is emerging at a constant rate from a line source at z ¼ a (Fig. 9-3), the
complex potential is
V(z) ¼ k ln(z  a)
(9:15)
where k . 0 is called the strength of the source. The streamlines are shown heavy while the equi-
potential lines are dashed.
(3)
Sink at z ¼ a. In this case, the ﬂuid is disappearing at z ¼ a (Fig. 9-4) and the complex potential is
obtained from that of the source by replacing k by k, giving
V(z) ¼ k ln(z  a)

Flow with Circulation. The ﬂow corresponding to the complex potential
V(z) ¼ ik ln(z  a)
(9:17)
is as indicated in Fig. 9-5. The magnitude of the velocity of ﬂuid at any point is in this case inver-
sely proportional to the distance from a.
The point z ¼ a is called a vortex and k is called its strength. The circulation [see equation
(9.5)] about any simple closed curve C enclosing z ¼ a is equal in magnitude to 2pk. Note
that, by changing k to k in (9.17), the complex potential corresponding to a “clockwise”
vortex is obtained.
(5)
Superposition of Flows. By addition of complex potentials, more complicated ﬂow patterns can
be described. An important example is obtained by considering the ﬂow due to a source at z ¼ a
and a sink of equal strength at z ¼ a. Then, the complex potential is
V(z) ¼ k ln(z þ a)  k ln(z  a) ¼ k ln z þ a
z  a


(9:18)
By letting a ! 0 and k ! 1 in such a way that 2ka ¼ m is ﬁnite, we obtain the complex potential
V(z) ¼ m
z
(9:19)
This is the complex potential due to a doublet or dipole, i.e., the combination of a source and sink
of equal strengths separated by a very small distance. The quantity m is called the dipole moment.

Flow Around Obstacles
An important problem in ﬂuid ﬂow is that of determining the ﬂow pattern of a ﬂuid initially moving with
uniform velocity V0 in which an obstacle has been placed.

Fig. 9-6
Fig. 9-7
Fig. 9-8
A general principle involved in this type of problem is to design a complex potential having the form
V(z) ¼ V0z þ G(z)
(9:20)
(if the ﬂow is in the z plane) where G(z) is such that limjzj!1 G0(z) ¼ 0, which means physically that far
from the obstacle the velocity has constant magnitude (in this case V0). Furthermore, the complex potential
must be chosen so that one of the streamlines represents the boundary of the obstacle.
A knowledge of conformal mapping functions is often useful in obtaining complex potentials. For
example, the complex potential corresponding to the uniform ﬂow in the w plane of Fig. 9-6 is given by
V0w. By use of the mapping function w ¼ z þ a2=z [see entry A-4, page 249], the upper half w plane of
Fig. 9-6 corresponds to the upper half z plane exterior to circle C, and the complex potential for the ﬂow
of Fig. 9-7 is given by
V(z) ¼ V0 z þ a2
z


(9:21)
Similarly, if z ¼ F(z ) maps C0 and its exterior onto C and its exterior [see Fig. 9-8], then the complex poten-
tial for the ﬂow of Fig. 9-8 is obtained by replacing z by F(z ) in (9.21). The complex potential can also be
obtained on going directly from the w to the z plane by means of a suitable mapping function.
Using the above and introducing other physical phenomena such as circulation, we can describe the ﬂow
pattern about variously shaped airfoils and thus describe the motion of an airplane in ﬂight.
9.13
Bernoulli’s Theorem
If P denotes the pressure in a ﬂuid and V is the speed of the ﬂuid, then Bernoulli’s theorem states that
P þ 1
2 sV2 ¼ K
(9:22)
where s is the ﬂuid density and K is a constant along any streamline.

Applications to Electrostatics

Coulomb’s Law
Let r be the distance between two point electric charges, q1 and q2. Then, the force between them is given in
magnitude by Coulomb’s law, which states that
F ¼ q1q2
kr2
(9:25)
and is one of repulsion or attraction according as the charges are like (both positive or both negative) or
unlike (one positive and the other negative). The constant k in (9.25), which is called the dielectric constant,
depends on the medium; in a vacuum k ¼ 1, in other cases k . 1. In the following, we assume k ¼ 1 unless
otherwise speciﬁed.
9.16
Electric Field Intensity. Electrostatic Potential
Suppose we are given a charge distribution, which may be continuous, discrete, or a combination. This
charge distribution sets up an electric ﬁeld. If a unit positive charge (small enough so as not to affect the
ﬁeld appreciably) is placed at any point A not already occupied by charge, the force acting on this
charge is called the electric ﬁeld intensity at A and is denoted by E. This force is derivable from a potential
F, which is sometimes called the electrostatic potential. In symbols,
E ¼ grad F ¼ rF
(9:26)
If the charge distribution is two dimensional, which is our main concern here, then
E ¼ Ex þ iEy ¼  @F
@x  i @F
@y
where Ex ¼  @F
@x , Ey ¼  @F
@y
(9:27)
In such a case, if Et denotes the component of the electric ﬁeld intensity tangential to any simple closed
curve C in the z plane,

(9:28)
CHAPTER 9

9.17
Gauss’ Theorem
Let us conﬁne ourselves to charge distributions, which can be considered two dimensional. If C is any
simple closed curve in the z plane having a net charge q in its interior (actually an inﬁnite cylinder enclosing
a net charge q) and En is the normal component of the electric ﬁeld intensity, then Gauss’ theorem states that
þ
C
En ds ¼ 4pq
(9:29)
If C does not enclose any net charge, this reduces to
þ
C
En ds ¼
þ
C
Ex dy  Ey dx ¼ 0
(9:30)
It follows that in any region not occupied by charge,
@Ex
@x þ @Ey
@y ¼ 0
(9:31)
From (9.27) and (9.31), we have
@2F
@x2 þ @2F
@y2 ¼ 0
(9:32)
i.e., F is harmonic at all points not occupied by charge.
9.18
The Complex Electrostatic Potential
From the above, it is evident that there must exist a harmonic function C conjugate to F such that
V(z) ¼ F(x, y) þ iC(x, y)
(9:33)
is analytic in any region not occupied by charge. We call V(z) the complex electrostatic potential or, simply
complex potential. In terms of this, (9.27) becomes
E ¼  @F
@x  i @F
@y ¼  @F
@x þ i @C
@y ¼  dV
dz ¼ V0(z)
(9:34)
and the magnitude of E is given by E ¼ jEj ¼ jV0(z)j ¼ jV0(z)j.
The curves (cylindrical surfaces in three dimensions)
F(x, y) ¼ a,
C(x, y) ¼ b
(9:35)
are called equipotential lines and ﬂux lines, respectively.
9.19
Line Charges
The analogy of the above with ﬂuid ﬂow is quite apparent. The electric ﬁeld in electrostatic problems
corresponds to the velocity ﬁeld in ﬂuid ﬂow problems, the only difference being a change of sign in the
corresponding complex potentials.
The idea of sources and sinks of ﬂuid ﬂow have corresponding analogs for electrostatics. Thus the
complex (electrostatic) potential due to a line charge q per unit length at z0 (in a vacuum) is given by
V(z) ¼ 2q ln(z  z0)
(9:36)
288
CHAPTER 9
Physical Applications of Conformal Mapping

and represents a source or sink according as q , 0 or q . 0. Similarly, we talk about doublets or dipoles,
etc. If the medium is not a vacuum, we replace q in (9.36) by q=k.
9.20
Conductors
If a solid is perfectly conducting, i.e., is a perfect conductor, all charge is located on its surface. Thus, if we
consider the surface represented by the simple closed curve C in the z plane, the charges are in equilibrium
on C and hence C is an equipotential line.
An important problem is the calculation of potential due to a set of charged cylinders. This can be accom-
plished by use of conformal mapping.
9.21
Capacitance
Two conductors having charges of equal magnitude q but of opposite sign, have a difference of potential,
say V. The quantity C deﬁned by
q ¼ CV
(9:37)
depends only on the geometry of the conductors and is called the capacitance. The conductors themselves
form what is called a condenser or capacitor.
Applications to Heat Flow
9.22
Heat Flux
Consider a solid having a temperature distribution that may be varying. We are often interested in the quan-
tity of heat conducted per unit area per unit time across a surface located in the solid. This quantity, some-
times called the heat ﬂux across the surface, is given by
Q ¼ K grad F
(9:38)
where F is the temperature and K, assumed to be a constant, is called the thermal conductivity and depends
on the material of which the solid is made.
9.23
The Complex Temperature
Suppose we restrict ourselves to problems of a two-dimensional type. Then
Q ¼ K @F


¼ Qx þ iQy
where Qx ¼ K @F
@x ,
Qy ¼ K @F

(9:39)
Let C be any simple closed curve in the z plane (representing the cross section of a cylinder). If Qt and Qn
are the tangential and normal components of the heat ﬂux and if steady state conditions prevail so that there
is no net accumulation of heat inside C, then we have
þ

assuming no sources or sinks inside C. The ﬁrst equation of (9.40) yields
@Qx

@y ¼ 0
(9:41)
which becomes on using (9.39),
@2F
@x2 þ @2F

that is, F is harmonic. Introducing the harmonic conjugate function C, we see that
V(z) ¼ F(x, y) þ iC(x, y)
(9:42)
is analytic. The families of curves
F(x, y) ¼ a,
C(x, y) ¼ b
(9:43)
are called isothermal lines and ﬂux lines, respectively, while V(z) is called the complex temperature.
The analogies with ﬂuid ﬂow and electrostatics are evident and procedures used in these ﬁelds can be
similarly employed in solving various temperature problems.

Suppose F ¼ x2  y2 þ 2y. We have @2F=@x2 ¼ 2, @2F=@y2 ¼ 2. Then (@2F=@x2) þ (@2F=@y2) ¼ 0
and F is harmonic in R.
(b)
Suppose
F ¼ sin x cosh y.
We
have

Then,

9.2. Show that the functions of Problem 9.1 are harmonic in the w plane under the transformation z ¼ w3.
Solution
Suppose z ¼ w3. Then x þ iy ¼ (u þ iv)3 ¼ u3  3uv2 þ i(3u2v  v3)
and
x ¼ u3  3uv2, y ¼ 3u2v  v3.

We must show that F ¼ sin(u33uv2) cosh(3u2v  v3) satisﬁes (@2F=@u2) þ (@2F=@v2) ¼ 0. This can

CHAPTER 9

291

Solution
Method 1. If R does not contain a, then w ¼ ln(z  a) is analytic in R. Hence, the real and imaginary parts are
harmonic in R.
Method 2. Let z  a ¼ reiu. Then, if principal values are used for u, w ¼ u þ iv ¼ ln(z  a) ¼ ln r þ iu so that
u ¼ ln r, v ¼ u.
In the polar coordinates (r, u), Laplace’s equation is
@2F

and, by direct substitution, we ﬁnd that u ¼ ln r and v ¼ u are solutions if R does not contain r ¼ 0, i.e., z ¼ a.
Method 3. If z  a ¼ reiu, then x  a ¼ r cos u, y ¼ r sin u and r ¼

2 lnf(x  a)2 þ y2g, v ¼ tan1fy=(x  a)g.
Substituting these into Laplace’s equation (@2F=@x2) þ (@2F=@y2) ¼ 0, we ﬁnd after straightforward differen-
tiation that u and v are solutions if z=a.

This is a Dirichlet problem for the upper half plane [see Fig. 9-10].
The function Au1 þ Bu2 þ C where A, B, and C are real constants, is harmonic since it is the imaginary part
of A ln(z þ 1) þ B ln(z  1) þ C.
To determine A, B, C, note that the boundary conditions are: (a) F ¼ T2 for x . 1, i.e., u1 ¼ u2 ¼ 0;
(b) F ¼ T1 for 1 , x , 1, i.e., u1 ¼ 0, u2 ¼ p;
(c) F ¼ T0 for x , 1, i.e., u1 ¼ p, u2 ¼ p. Thus
(1) T2 ¼ A(0) þ B(0) þ C,

Method 1. Using conformal mapping.
We map the interior of the circle jzj ¼ 1 onto the upper half of the w plane [Fig. 9-12] by using the mapping
function z ¼ (i  w)=(i þ w) or w ¼ if 1  z)=(1 þ z
ð
Þg [see Problem 8.12, page 263, and interchange z and w].
Under this transformation, arcs ABC and CDE are mapped onto the negative and positive real axis A0B0C0
and C0D0E0, respectively, of the w plane. Then, by Problem 9.81, the boundary conditions F ¼ 0 on arc ABC
and F ¼ 1 on arc CDE become, respectively, F ¼ 0 on A0B0C0 and F ¼ 1 on C0D0E0.
Thus, we have reduced the problem to ﬁnding a function F harmonic in the upper half w plane and taking
the values 0 for u , 0 and 1 for u . 0. But this problem has already been solved in Problem 9.6 and the sol-
ution (replacing x by u and y by v) is given by

Far from the obstacle, we see from (1) that V ¼ V0 approximately, i.e., the ﬂuid is traveling in the

9.11. Show that under the transformation w ¼ z þ (a2=z), the ﬂuid ﬂow in the z plane considered in
Problem 9.10 is mapped into a uniform ﬂow with constant velocity V0 in the w plane.

The complex potential for the ﬂow in the w plane is given by
V0 z þ a2
z


¼ V0w
which represents uniform ﬂow with constant velocity V0 in the w plane [compare entry A-4 on page 249].
In general, the transformation w ¼ V(z) maps the ﬂuid ﬂow in the z plane with complex potential V(z) into a
uniform ﬂow in the w plane. This is very useful in determining complex potentials of complicated ﬂuid patterns
through a knowledge of mapping functions.
9.12. Fluid emanates at a constant rate from an inﬁnite line source perpendicular to the z plane at z ¼ 0
[Fig. 9-15]. (a) Show that the speed of the ﬂuid at a distance r from the source is V ¼ k=r where k is a
constant. (b) Show that the complex potential is V(z) ¼ k ln z. (c) What modiﬁcation should be
made in (b) if the line source is at z ¼ a? (d) What modiﬁcation is made in (b) if the source is
replaced by a sink in which ﬂuid is disappearing at a constant rate?
Solution
(a)
Consider a portion of the line source of unit length [Fig. 9-16]. If Vr is the radial velocity of the ﬂuid at
distance r from the source and s is the density of the ﬂuid (assumed incompressible so that s is constant),
then:
Mass of fluid per unit time emanating from line source of unit length
¼ mass of fluid crossing surface of cylinder of radius r and height 1
¼ (surface area)(radial velocity)(fluid density)

Since Vr ¼ @F=@r ¼ k=r, we have on integrating and omitting the constant of integration, F ¼ k ln r. But
this is the real part of V(z) ¼ k ln z, which is therefore the required complex potential.
(c)
If the line source is at z ¼ a instead of z ¼ 0, replace z by z  a to obtain the complex potential
V(z) ¼ k ln(z  a).
(d)
If the source is replaced by a sink, the complex potential is V(z) ¼ k ln z, the minus sign arising from the
fact that the velocity is directed toward z ¼ 0.
Similarly, V(z) ¼ k ln(z  a) is the complex potential for a sink at z ¼ a.

Find the complex potential due to a source at z ¼ a and a sink at z ¼ a of equal strengths k.
(b)
Determine the equipotential lines and streamlines and represent graphically.
(c)
Find the speed of the ﬂuid at any point.
Solution
(a)
Complex potential due to source at z ¼ a of strength k is k ln(z þ a).
Complex potential due to sink at z ¼ a of strength k is k ln(z  a).
Then, by superposition:

Thus, the complex potential describes the ﬂow of a ﬂuid, which is rotating around z ¼ 0. The ﬂow is some-
times referred to as a vortex ﬂow and z ¼ 0 is called a vortex.

In case g ¼ 4paV0, there is only one stagnation point.
Since r ¼ a is a streamline corresponding to b ¼ (g=2p) ln a, the ﬂow can be considered as one about a
circular obstacle as in Problem 9.10. Far from this obstacle, the ﬂuid has velocity V0 since limjzj!1 V0(z) ¼ V0.
The ﬂow pattern changes, depending on the magnitude of g. In Figs. 9-19 and 9-20, we have shown two of
the many possible ones. Fig. 9-19 corresponds to g , 4paV0; the stagnation points are situated at A and B.
Fig. 9-20 corresponds to g . 4paV0 and there is only one stagnation point in the ﬂuid at C.

Solution
(a)
The electric ﬁeld due to a line charge q per unit length is radial and the normal component of the electric

We must ﬁnd a function, harmonic in the plane, which takes on the values V0 for x . 0 (i.e., u ¼ 0) and
V0 for x , 0 (i.e., u ¼ p). As in Problem 9.6, if A and B are real constants Au þ B is harmonic. Then

Show that the potential due to an inﬁnite plane [ABC in Fig. 9-25] kept at zero potential
(ground potential) and a line charge q per unit length parallel to this plane can be found

The complex potential due to the two line charges [Fig. 9-24] is

To prove this, we must show that the potential (1) reduces to F ¼ 0 on the x axis, i.e., ABC in Fig. 9-25 is
at potential zero. This follows at once from the fact that on the x axis, z ¼ x so that

Solution
By the transformation z ¼ z2, the shaded region of the z plane [Fig. 9-35] is mapped into the region shaded in
Fig. 9-36 with the indicated boundary conditions [see entry A-1 on page 248].
By the transformation z ¼ sin(pw=2), the shaded region of the z plane [Fig. 9-36] is mapped into the region
shaded in Fig. 9-37 with the indicated boundary conditions [see entry C-1 on page 254].
Now the temperature problem represented by Fig. 9-37 with B00D00 insulated is equivalent to the
temperature problem represented by Fig. 9-38 since, by symmetry, no heat transfer can take place across
B00D00. But this is the problem of determining the temperature between two parallel planes kept at constant
temperatures T1 and T2, respectively. In this case, the temperature variation is linear and so must be given
by T1 þ (T2  T1)u.
From z ¼ z2 and z ¼ sin(pw=2), we have on eliminating z, w ¼ (2=p) sin1 z2 or u ¼ (2=p) Refsin1 z2g.
Then, the required temperature is
T1 þ 2(T2  T1)

Analytic Continuation
Let F1(z) be a function of z which is analytic in a region R1 [Fig. 10-1]. Suppose that we can ﬁnd a function
F2(z) which is analytic in a region R2 and which is such that F1(z) ¼ F2(z) in the region common
to R1 and R2. Then we say that F2(z) is an analytic continuation of F1(z). This means that there is
a function F(z) analytic in the combined regions R1 and R2 such that F(z) ¼ F1(z) in R1 and
F(z) ¼ F2(z) in R2. Actually, it sufﬁces for R1 and R2 to have only a small arc in common, such as
LMN in Fig. 10-2.

By analytic continuation to regions R3, R4, etc., we can extend the original region of deﬁnition to other
parts of the complex plane. The functions F1(z), F2(z), F3(z), . . . , deﬁned in R1, R2, R3, . . . , respectively,
are sometimes called function elements or simply elements. It is sometimes impossible to extend a function
analytically beyond the boundary of a region. We then call the boundary a natural boundary.
Suppose a function F1(z) deﬁned in R1 is continued analytically to region Rn along two different paths
[Fig. 10-3]. Then the two analytic continuations will be identical if there is no singularity between the paths.
This is the uniqueness theorem for analytic continuation.
If we do get different results, we can show that there is a singularity (speciﬁcally a branch point) between
the paths. It is in this manner that we arrive at the various branches of multiple-valued functions. In this
connection, the concept of Riemann surfaces [Chapter 2] proves valuable.
We have already seen how functions represented by power series may be continued analytically
(Chapter 6). In this chapter, we consider how functions with other representations (such as integrals) may
be continued analytically.

Schwarz’s Reﬂection Principle
Suppose that F1(z) is analytic in the region R1 [Fig. 10-4] and that F1(z) assumes real values on the part
LMN of the real axis.
Then Schwarz’s reﬂection principle states that the analytic continuation of F1(z) into region R2
(considered as a mirror image or reﬂection of R1 with LMN as the mirror) is given by
F2(z) ¼ F1(z)
(10:1)
The result can be extended to cases where LMN is a curve instead of a straight line segment.
10.3
Inﬁnite Products
Let Pn ¼ (1 þ w1)(1 þ w2)    (1 þ wn) be denoted by Qn
k¼1 (1 þ wk) where we suppose that for all k,
wk =1. If there exists a value P=0 such that limn!1 Pn ¼ P, we say that the inﬁnite product
(1 þ w1)(1 þ w2)    ; Q1
k¼1 (1 þ wk), or simply Q (1 þ wk), converges to P; otherwise it diverges. The
quantities wk may be constants or functions of z.
If only a ﬁnite number of the quantities wk ¼ 1 while the rest of the inﬁnite product omitting these
factors converges, the inﬁnite product is said to converge to zero.
10.4
Absolute, Conditional and Uniform Convergence of Inﬁnite Products
Suppose the inﬁnite product Q (1 þ jwkj) converges. We then say that Q (1 þ wk) is absolutely convergent.
Suppose Q (1 þ wk) converges but Q (1 þ jwkj) diverges. We then say that Q (1 þ wk) is conditionally
convergent.
An important theorem, analogous to one for inﬁnite series, states that an absolutely convergent inﬁnite
product is convergent, i.e., if Q (1 þ jwkj) converges, then Q (1 þ wk) converges (see Problem 10.65).
The concept of uniform convergence of inﬁnite products is easily deﬁned by analogy with inﬁnite series
or sequences in general. Thus, if Qn
k¼1 f1 þ wk(z)g ¼ Pn(z) and Q1
k¼1 f1 þ wk(z)g ¼ P(z), we say that Pn(z)
converges uniformly to P(z) in a region R if, given any e . 0, we can ﬁnd a number N, depending only on e
and not on the particular value of z in R, such that jPn(z)  P(z)j , e for all n . N.
As in the case of inﬁnite series, certain things can be done with absolutely or uniformly convergent
inﬁnite products that cannot necessarily be done for inﬁnite products in general. Thus, for example, we
can rearrange factors in an absolutely convergent inﬁnite product without changing the value.
320
CHAPTER 10

10.5
Some Important Theorems on Inﬁnite Products
1.
A necessary condition that Q (1 þ wk) converge is that limn!1 wn ¼ 0. However, the condition is
not sufﬁcient, i.e., even if limn!1 wn ¼ 0, the inﬁnite product may diverge.
2.
If P jwkj converges [i.e., if P wk converges absolutely], then Q (1 þ jwkj), and thus Q (1 þ wk),
converges [i.e., Q (1 þ wk) converges absolutely]. The converse theorem also holds.
3.
If an inﬁnite product is absolutely convergent, its factors can be altered without affecting the value
of the product.
4.
Suppose in a region R, jwk(z)j , Mk, k ¼ 1, 2, 3, . . . , where Mk are constants such that P Mk
converges. Then Q f1 þ wk(z)g is uniformly (and absolutely) convergent. This is the analog of
the Weierstrass M test for series.
5.
Suppose wk(z), k ¼ 1, 2, 3, . . . , are analytic in a region R and P wk(z) is uniformly convergent in
R. Then Q f1 þ wk(z)g converges to an analytic function in R.
10.6
Weierstrass’ Theorem for Inﬁnite Products
Let f(z) be analytic for all z [i.e., f(z) is an entire function] and suppose that it has simple zeros
at a1, a2, a3, . . . where 0 , ja1j , ja2j , ja3j ,    and limn!1 janj ¼ 1. Then, f(z) can be expressed
as an inﬁnite product of the form
f(z) ¼ f(0)e f 0(0)z=f(0) Y

or orders mk, and if for some integer N, P1
k¼1 1=aN
k is absolutely convergent, then

The Gamma Function
For Refzg . 0, we deﬁne the gamma function by
G(z) ¼
ð1

tz1et dt
(10:4)
CHAPTER 10
Special Topics
321

Then (see Problem 10.11), we have the recursion formula
G(z þ 1) ¼ zG(z)
(10:5)
where G(1) ¼ 1:
Let z be a positive integer n. We see from (10.5) that
G(n þ 1) ¼ n(n  1)    (1) ¼ n!
(10:6)
so that the gamma function is a generalization of the factorial. For this reason, the gamma function is also
called the factorial function and is written as z! rather than G(z þ 1), in which case we deﬁne 0! ¼ 1.
From (10.5), we also see that if z is real and positive, then G(z) can be determined by knowing the values
of G(z) for 0 , z , 1. If z ¼ 1
2, we have [Problem 10.14]
G 1

¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃp

(10:7)
For Refzg  0, the deﬁnition (10.4) breaks down since the integral diverges. By analytic continuation,
however, we can deﬁne G(z) in the left hand plane. Essentially, this amounts to use of (10.5) [see
Problem 10.15]. At z ¼ 0, 1, 2, . . . , G(z) has simple poles [see Problem 10.16].

(10:8)
As seen in Problem 10.18, this is related to the gamma function according to
B(m, n) ¼ G(m)G(n)

(10:9)
Various integrals can be expressed in terms of the beta function and thus in terms of the gamma function.

For Refmg  0 and Refng  0, the deﬁnition (10.8) can be extended by use of analytic continuation.
10.11
Differential Equations
Suppose we are given the linear differential equation
Y00 þ p(z)Y0 þ q(z)Y ¼ 0
(10:12)
If p(z) and q(z) are analytic at a point a, then a is called an ordinary point of the differential equation. Points
at which p(z) or q(z) or both are not analytic are called singular points of the differential equation.
EXAMPLE 10.1
For Y00 þ zY0 þ (z2  4)Y ¼ 0, every point is an ordinary point.

For (1  z2)Y00  2zY0 þ 6Y ¼ 0 or Y00  f2z=(1  z2)gY0 þ f6=(1  z2)gY ¼ 0, we note that
z ¼ +1 are singular points; all other points are ordinary points.
Let z ¼ a be a singular point but (z  a)p(z) and (z  a)2q(z) are analytic at z ¼ a. Then z ¼ a is called a
regular singular point. If z ¼ a is neither an ordinary point or a regular singular point, it is called an irre-
gular singular point.

If Y1(z) and Y2(z) are two solutions of (10.12) that are not constant multiples of each other, we call the
solutions linearly independent. In such a case, if A and B are any constants, the general solution of (10.12) is
Y ¼ AY1 þ BY2
(10:13)
The following theorems are fundamental.
THEOREM 10.1.
Let z ¼ a be an ordinary point of (10.12). Then there exist two linearly independent
solutions of (12) having the form
X
1
k¼0
ak(z  a)k
(10:14)
where the constants ak are determined by substitution in (10.12). In doing this, it may be
necessary to expand p(z) and q(z) in powers of (z  a). In practice, it is desirable to
replace (z  a) by a new variable.
The solutions (10.14) converge in a circle with center at a, which extends up to the nearest singularity of
the differential equation.
EXAMPLE 10.5
The equation (1  z2)Y00  2zY0 þ 6Y ¼ 0 [see Example 10.2] has a solution of the form
P akzk that converges inside the circle jzj ¼ 1.
THEOREM 10.2.
Suppose z ¼ a is a regular singular point. Then there exists at least one solution having
the form
(z  a)c X
1
k¼0
ak(z  a)k
(10:15)
where c is a constant. By substituting into (10.12) and equating the lowest power of
(z  a) to zero, a quadratic equation for c (called the indicial equation) is obtained. If
we call the solutions of this quadratic equation c1 and c2, the following situations arise.
1.
c1  c2 =an integer. In this case, there are two linearly independent solutions
having the form (10.15).
324
CHAPTER 10

2.
c1 ¼ c2. Here one solution has the form (10.15) while the other linearly indepen-

k¼0

(10:16)
3.
c1  c2 ¼ an integer=0. In this case, there is either one solution of the form
(10.15) or two linearly independent solutions having this form. If only one solution
of the form (10.15) can be found, the other linearly independent solution has the
form (10.16).
All solutions obtained converge in a circle with center at a, which extends up to the nearest singularity of
the differential equation.
10.12
Solution of Differential Equations by Contour Integrals
It is often desirable to seek a solution of a linear differential equation in the form
Y(z) ¼
þ
C
K(z, t)G(t) dt
(10:17)
where K(z, t) is called the kernel. One useful possibility occurs when K(z, t) ¼ ezt, in which case
Y(z) ¼

C

(10:18)
Such solutions may occur where the coefﬁcients in the differential equation are rational functions
(see Problems 10.25 and 10.26).

which is called Bessel’s function of the ﬁrst kind of order n.
If n is not an integer, the general solution of (10.18) is
Y ¼ AJn(z) þ BJn(z)
(10:21)
where A and B are arbitrary constants. However, if n is an integer, then Jn(z) ¼ (1)nJn(z) and (10.20)
fails to yield the general solution. The general solution in this case can be found as in Problems 10.182
and 10.183.

If n is a positive integer or zero, the general solution of Legendre’s equation can be written as

(10:28)
where Qn(z) is an inﬁnite series convergent for jzj , 1 obtained from (10.26). If n is not a positive integer,
there are two inﬁnite series solutions obtained from (10.26) that are convergent for jzj , 1. These solutions
to Legendre’s equation are called Legendre functions. They have properties analogous to those of the
Legendre polynomials.

Asymptotic series, and formulas involving them, are very useful in evaluation of functions for large
values of the variable, which might otherwise be difﬁcult. In practice, an asymptotic series may diverge.
However, by taking the sum of successive terms of the series, stopping just before the terms begin to
increase, we may obtain a good approximation for F(z).
Various operations with asymptotic series are permissible. For example, asymptotic series may be added,
multiplied or integrated term by term to yield another asymptotic series. However, differentiation is not
always possible. For a given range of values of z, an asymptotic series, if it exists, is unique.

The Method of Steepest Descents
Let I(z) be expressible in the form
I(z) ¼
ð
C
ezF(t) dt
(10:37)
where C is some path in the t plane. Since F(t) is complex, we can consider z to be real.
The method of steepest descents is a method for ﬁnding an asymptotic formula for (10.37) valid for large
z. Where applicable, it consists of the following steps.
1.
Determine the points at which F0(t) ¼ 0. Such points are called saddle points, and for this reason
the method is also called the saddle point method.
We shall assume that there is only one saddle point, say t0. The method can be extended if there
is more than one.
2.
Assuming F(t) analytic in a neighborhood of t0, obtain the Taylor series expansion
F(t) ¼ F(t0) þ F00(t0)(t  t0)2

þ    ¼ F(t0)  u2
(10:38)
Now deform contour C so that it passes through the saddle point t0, and is such that RefF(t)g is
largest at t0 while ImfF(t)g can be considered equal to the constant ImfF(t0)g in the neighborhood
of t0. With these assumptions, the variable u deﬁned by (10.38) is real and we obtain to a high
degree of approximation

is called an elliptic integral of the ﬁrst kind. The integral exists if w is real and such that jwj , 1. By analytic

where k and k0, called the modulus and complementary modulus, respectively, are such that
k0 ¼

. Then the periods of sn z are 4K and 2iK0, the periods of cn z are 4K and
2K þ 2iK0, and the periods of dn z are 2K and 4iK0. It follows that there exists a periodic set of
parallelograms [often called period parallelograms] in the complex plane in which the values
of an elliptic function repeat. The smallest of these is often referred to as a unit cell or simply a cell.
The above ideas can be extended to other elliptic functions. Thus there exist elliptic integrals of the
second and third kinds deﬁned, respectively, by

SOLVED PROBLEMS
Analytic Continuation
10.1. Let F(z) be analytic in a region R and suppose that F(z) ¼ 0 at all points on an arc PQ inside R
[Fig. 10-6]. Prove that F(z) ¼ 0 throughout R.
Solution
Choose any point, say z0, on arc PQ. Then, in some circle of convergence C with center at z0 [this circle
extending at least to the boundary of R where a singularity may exist], F(z) has a Taylor series expansion
F(z) ¼ F(z0) þ F0(z0)(z  z0) þ 1
2 F00(z0)(z  z0)2 þ   
But, by hypothesis, F(z0) ¼ F0(z0) ¼ F00(z0) ¼    ¼ 0. Hence, F(z) ¼ 0 inside C.
By choosing another arc inside C, we can continue the process. In this manner, we can show that F(z) ¼ 0
throughout R.

10.2. Given that the identity sin2 z þ cos2 z ¼ 1 holds for real values of z, prove that it also holds for all
complex values of z.
Solution
Let F(z) ¼ sin2 z þ cos2 z  1 and let R be a region of the z plane containing a portion of the x axis [Fig. 10-7].
Since sin z and cos z are analytic in R, it follows that F(z) is analytic in R. Also F(z) ¼ 0 on the x axis.
Hence, by Problem 10.1, F(z) ¼ 0 identically in R, which shows that sin2 z þ cos2 z ¼ 1 for all z in R. Since
R is arbitrary, we obtain the required result.
This method is useful in proving, for complex values, many of the results true for real values.
10.3. Let F1(z) and F2(z) be analytic in a region R [Fig. 10-8] and suppose that on an arc PQ in R,
F1(z) ¼ F2(z). Prove that F1(z) ¼ F2(z) in R.

10.4. Let F1(z) be analytic in region R1 [Fig. 10-9] and on the boundary JKLM. Suppose that we can ﬁnd a
function F2(z) analytic in region R2 and on the boundary JKLM such that F1(z) ¼ F2(z) on JKLM.
Prove that the function
F(z) ¼

F2(z)

is analytic in the region R, which is composed of R1 and R2 [sometimes written R ¼ R1 þ R2].
Solution
Method 1. This follows from Problem 10.3, since there can be only one function F2(z) in R2 satisfying the
required properties.
Method 2. Using Cauchy’s integral formulas.
Construct the simple closed curve SLTKS (dashed in Fig. 10-9) and let a be any point inside. From Cauchy’s
integral formula, we have (since F2(z) is analytic inside and on LTKL and since F2(z) ¼ F(z) on LTK)

so that F(z) is analytic at a. But since we can choose a to be any point in the region R by suitably
modifying the dashed contour of Fig. 10-9, it follows that F(z) is analytic in R.
Method 3. Using Morera’s theorem.
Referring to Fig. 10-9, we have

by Cauchy’s theorem. Thus, the integral around any simple closed path in R is zero, and so, by Morera’s
theorem, F(z) must be analytic.
The function F2(z) is called an analytic continuation of F1(z).

By the ratio test, the series converges for jzj , 1. Then, the series represents an analytic function in this

(b)
For jzj , 1, the sum of the series is F2(z) ¼ z=(1 þ z). But, this function is analytic at all points except

For Refzg . 0, the integral has the value F2(z) ¼ 6=z4. But this function is analytic at all points except

continuation.
Schwarz’s Reﬂection Principle
10.7. Prove Schwarz’s reﬂection principle (see page 320).
Solution
Refer to Fig. 10-4, page 320. On the real axis [y ¼ 0], we have F1(z) ¼ F1(x) ¼ F1(x) ¼ F1(z). Then, by
Problem 10.3, we have only to prove that F1(z) ¼ F2(z) is analytic in R2.
Let F1(z) ¼ U1(x, y) þ iV1(x, y). Since this is analytic in R1 [i.e., y . 0], we have by the Cauchy–
Riemann equations,
@U1
@x ¼ @V1
@y ,
@V1
@x ¼  @U1
@y
(1)
where these partial derivatives are continuous.
Now, F1(z) ¼ F1(x  iy) ¼ U1(x, y) þ iV1(x, y), and so F1(z) ¼ U1(x, y)  iV1(x, y). If this is to
be analytic in R2, we must have, for y . 0,
@U1
@x ¼ @(V1)
@(y) ,
@(V1)
@x
¼  @U1
@(y)
(2)
CHAPTER 10

But these are equivalent to (1), since
@(V1)
@(y) ¼ @V1
@y , @(V1)
@x

@x
and
@U1
@(y) ¼  @U1

Hence, the required result follows.

If P1
k¼1 jwkj converges, it follows that Pn is a bounded monotonic increasing sequence and so has a limit,
i.e., Q1

Pn ¼ (1 þ jw1j)(1 þ jw2j)    (1 þ jwnj)  1 þ jw1j þ jw2j þ    þ jwnj ¼ 1 þ Sn  1
If limn!1 Pn exists, i.e., the inﬁnite product converges, it follows that Sn is a bounded monotonic increasing

Solution
If Refzg . 0, G(z) is deﬁned by (10.4), page 321, but this deﬁnition cannot be used for Refzg  0. However,
we can use the recursion formula G(z þ 1) ¼ zG(z), which holds for Refzg . 0, to extend the deﬁnition for
Refzg  0, i.e., it provides an analytic continuation into the left-hand plane.

(b)
Use (a) to show that G(z) is an analytic function except for simple poles in the left-hand plane
at z ¼ 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . .
Solution
(a)
We have G(z þ 1) ¼ zG(z), G(z þ 2) ¼ (z þ 1)G(z þ 1) ¼ (z þ 1)zG(z), G(z þ 3) ¼ (z þ 2)G(z þ 2) ¼

which the required result follows.
(b)
We know that G(z) is analytic for Refzg . 0, from deﬁnition (10.4), page 321. Also, it is clear from
the result in (a) that G(z) is deﬁned and analytic for Refzg  n except for the simple poles at

Solution
(a) z ¼ 0 is a singular point. Since z(1=z) ¼ 1 and z2f(z2  n2)=z2g ¼ z2  n2 are analytic at z ¼ 0, it is a
regular singular point.
(b) At the singular point z ¼ 1, (z  1)f2=(z  1)g ¼ 2 is analytic but (z  1)2  f1=(z  1)4g ¼ f1=(z  1)2g is

The point z ¼ 0 is a regular singular point. Hence, there is a series solution of the form Y ¼ P1

If n ¼ 0, +1, +2, . . . only one solution is obtained. To ﬁnd the general solution in this case, we must
proceed as in Problems 10.175 and 10.176.
Since the singularity nearest to z ¼ 0 is at inﬁnity, the solutions should converge for all z. This is easily
shown by the ratio test.

This is satisﬁed if we choose G(t) so that the integrand is zero, i.e.,
G0(t) þ (2n þ 1)tG(t)  ft2G(t)g0 ¼ 0
or
G0(t) ¼ (2n  1)t

(b)
If Y ¼ zrU, then Y0 ¼ zrU0 þ rzr1U and Y00 ¼ zrU00 þ 2rzr1U0 þ r(r  1)zr2U. Hence
zY00 þ (2n þ 1)Y0 þ zY ¼ zrþ1U00 þ 2rzrU0 þ r(r  1)zr1U

þ [r(r  1)zr1 þ (2n þ 1)rzr1 þ zrþ1]U
The given differential equation is thus equivalent to
z2U00 þ (2r þ 2n þ 1)zU0 þ [z2 þ r2 þ 2nr]U ¼ 0
Letting r ¼ n, this becomes z2U00 þ zU0 þ (z2  n2)U ¼ 0.
Hence, a contour integral solution is

Then

ezt(t2  3t þ 2)G(t) dt ¼ 0

If we choose C so that the simple pole t ¼ 1 lies inside C while t ¼ 2 lies outside C, the integral has the value
2piez. If t ¼ 2 lies inside C while t ¼ 1 lies outside C, the integral has the value 2pie2z.

, n ¼ 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . .
Solution
The Legendre polynomials Pn(z) are of degree n and have the value 1 for z ¼ 1. Similarly, from (10.29),
page 328, it is seen that
F n, n þ 1; 1; 1  z

(1  z)2 þ   
is a polynomial of degree n having the value 1 for z ¼ 1.
The required result follows if we show that Pn and F satisfy the same differential equation. To do this, let
(1  z)=2 ¼ u, i.e., z ¼ 1  2u, in Legendre’s equation (10.25), page 327, to obtain
u(1  u) d2Y
du2 þ (1  2u) dY
du þ n(n þ 1)Y ¼ 0
But this is the hypergeometric equation (10.30), page 328, with a ¼ n, b ¼ n þ 1, c ¼ 1, and u ¼ (1  z)=2.
Hence the result is proved.

1  k2 sn2 z1 sn2 z2
:
Solution
Let z1 þ z2 ¼ a, a constant. Then dz2=dz1 ¼ 1. Let us deﬁne U ¼ sn z1, V ¼ sn z2. It follows that
dU
dz1
¼ _U ¼ cn z1dn z1,
dV
dz1
¼ _V ¼ dV
dz2
dz2
dz1
¼ cn z2 dn z2
where dots denote differentiation with respect to z1. Then
_U2 ¼ (1  U2)(1  k2U2)
and
_V2 ¼ (1  V2)(1  k2V2)
Differentiating and simplifying, we ﬁnd
€U ¼ 2k2U3  (1 þ k2)U
(1)
€V ¼ 2k2V3  (1 þ k2)V
(2)
Multiplying (1) by V, (2) by U, and subtracting, we have
€UV  U €V ¼ 2k2UV(U2  V2)
(3)
It is easy to verify that
_U2V2  U2 _V2 ¼ (1  k2U2V2)(V2  U2)
(4)
or
_UV  U _V ¼ (1  k2U2V2)(V2  U2)
_UV þ U _V
(5)
Dividing equations (3) and (5), we have
€UV  U €V
_UV  U _V ¼ 2k2UV( _UV þ U _V)

But
€UV  U €V ¼ d

so that (6) becomes
