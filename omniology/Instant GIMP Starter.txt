Instant GIMP Starter
So, what is GIMP?
GIMP stands for GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is an open source program that users can
use to retouch images and also create their own drawings; it is a complete painting tool.
Remember a picture where you wished that you could crop out unnecessary object that spoils 
the whole picture? Now you can do exactly that, or even better make that picture your piece of 
memory with beautiful effects.
Throughout the book, I will use GIMP Version 2.8.2, installed on Windows 7. GIMP is available for 
Windows, Linux, or Mac machines; all of these are free.
The user experience should be equivalent between Windows, Linux machine, and Mac. I often
take pictures with my digital camera or my phone. When I come home, I just plug the device into
my Linux machine and transfer my pictures to the USB drive. I might use it on my Linux machine 
to retouch pictures or work on some designs and later bring the USB drive to my personal laptop
to continue working on it. GIMP enables you to bring your work around without any problem.

4
Instant GIMP Starter
I even use GIMP at work. I don't have to worry about licensing or service subscriptions. You may
read them at http://www.gimp.org/about/COPYING. What makes GIMP so usable is that 
I can perform certain tasks faster. I work with lots of images to be inserted into websites or
documents. I have experienced working with thousands of images that need to be edited before
submission. At times like these, there is no room for trial and error. GIMP allows us to perform 
scripts (known as Script-Fu) by which I can do a 5-minute job in a matter of seconds. I will tell 
more about this later in this book.
GIMP is also available as a portable app, where you can copy data into an USB drive and open it in 
any Windows machine without installing it. This book, however, does not cover the portable app.

Instant GIMP Starter
Installation
In a few easy steps, you can install GIMP and get it set up on your system.
Step 1 – what do I need?
Before you install GIMP, you will need to check whether you have all of the required elements, as
listed in the following items:
Ê
256 MB of minimum memory is needed, though 1 GB is recommended for smoother 
work
Ê
Disk space of minimum 100 MB
Ê
For a Linux machine, GIMP requires an X Window System running on the machine
While we're on the subject, in the following screenshot, there is the one and only step shown to
get GIMP installed on Ubuntu:
Open up terminal and issue the following command:
sudo apt-get install gimp
Step 2 – downloading GIMP
The easiest way to download GIMP is from http://www.gimp.org/downloads/. There is a link 
to the latest version of Windows Installer on the website.

6

Step 3 – setting up installation
To set up the installation, follow these steps:
1.
Find the executable downloaded, and double-click on it to begin, as shown in the
following screenshot:
2.
Select the preferred language for use during installation.
Step 4 – installing
To begin installing GIMP, follow these steps:
1.
The installation begins after clicking on the Install button, as shown in the  
following screenshot:

Instant GIMP Starter
2.
On the following screenshot, the installer is unpacking its content and loading it into
the machine. Please wait for the process to finish.

8
Instant GIMP Starter
3.
The final screen for the installation indicates that the installation is successful.Then, 
click on the Finish button to end the installation process.
And that's it!
By this point, you should have a working installation of GIMP and are ready to spark creativity.

Instant GIMP Starter
Quick start – a tour around GIMP
Let's take a tour around GIMP for a start. This tour will give you an exposure to basic tasks to 
do with GIMP. Along the way, we will introduced to the GIMP conceptual idea that makes it
different than some of the other image manipulation programs.
We will go to produce the following image:
Step 1 – creating a new file
Working with GIMP requires you to work on canvas, just like an artist would do. In GIMP, the 
canvas is a file on your system. You may have a clean canvas (a new file), or you may also work 
on an image obtained from various sources.

10
Instant GIMP Starter
The File menu presents you with a number of options. From here, you can create a clean canvas 
by selecting New. From the next screenshot, we can see that there is an extensive menu for 
Create. You may start to import images copied from somewhere else, scan them, or take a
screenshot to begin with.
To create a new canvas, follow these steps:
1.
Click on File.
2.
From the menu, click on New.
3.
Now the Create a New Image dialog box will appear. Adjust the width and height. 
Before clicking on OK, set the background to be filled with nothing by selecting 
Transparency.

11
11
Instant GIMP Starter
Now you have the canvas to work on your first art, as shown in the following screenshot:

12
Instant GIMP Starter
If you have hand drawn the outline of the picture and scanned it previously like I do, locate the 
scanned picture on your machine, and all you got to do is drag the file into the canvas. If you 
happen to have a stylus pen, you could easily draw on the canvas.
Step 2 – setting the picture for painting
It is the perfect time to introduce the toolbox. The Toolbox option provides you with a set of 
tools to complete your work. The collections of tools here involve tools to select areas, painting,
transform, and touch-up tools.
1.
If the Toolbox window does not show up, press Ctrl +
l
B. Following is a screenshot of the 
Toolbox window.

13
13
Instant GIMP Starter
The previous screenshot consists of two parts, the tools and also tool options that 
further define the properties of the tool. The default installation of GIMP puts the 
Toolbox window and Tool option together, but they can be separated. It is one of 
the GIMP feature to be able to dock windows together or separate them according  
to user preference.
2.
Click on Windows and choose Dockable Dialogs to expose various dialog boxes that 
you might want to bring up front while working.
If you're not sure how to go with each item of the menu, place the cursor on the 
icon, and a tooltip will appear together with a shortcut key in bold. At the bottom of 
the Toolbox window is the color chooser, where user can select an active color and
alternative color, making painting easier when these colors are switchable.
3.
Click on the magic wand icon 
. Then, by clicking on the hair of the boy, the hair will
be selected.
4.
Now, duplicate the layer, so we can have a layer exclusively for his hair. This step
involves working with layers.

14
Instant GIMP Starter
Step 3 – create layers
It is a good idea to have a layer for each part of the image. Hair, shirt, skin – all should have their 
own layer. This way you can paint each part without accidently filling other parts.
The concept of layers is important when you are working with GIMP. Think of it as if you are 
drawing on different set of papers or transparencies that you may cut and rearrange before you
paste them on the drawing board.
The Layers dockable window can be accessed from Windows | Dockable Dialogs | Layers.
The Layers window is useful to navigate between layers. Refer to the following screenshot:
To navigate between layers, follow these steps:
1.
Drag a layer to the
 icon to quickly create a duplicate of the layer.
2.
Press Ctrl +
l
I (or click on 
I
Select | Invert) to select the opposite part and delete it. Now 
you have a layer specific for a part.
3.
Create a layer for each of the parts.The layers should be aligned and overlapped on top 
of the original outline. To rename the layers, double-click on the layer name or click on
the layer and press F2.

15
Instant GIMP Starter
The following is a screenshot of how the layers should look:
There are various controls that can be used from the Layers window alone. You may set certain
layers' visibility by clicking on the eye icon and control how it blends with other layers by
selecting the mode.
Layers are best used when composing images. Each of the images can be on a layer, so it is 
easier to adjust them around images on other layers. These layers can be organized to let  
certain layer sit on top of others. To do so, drag the layer to the top to make it sit on top of the 
other image.

16
Instant GIMP Starter
Step 4 – coloring
This is going to be the best part. When the layers are duplicated and separated, it is easy to paint
them. The trick to color carefully, so that the colors stay inside of the parts, is to select outside of 
the parts using the magic wand, and invert the selection (shortcut keys are Ctrl +
l
I). Having done 
so, follow these steps:
1.
Click the Paintbrush Tool
, and pick a color of your choice and paint away.
2.
To select another color, click on
, and you'll be given a menu, which has a set 
of colors to choose from:
3.
It is up to you to pick any color from the spectrum. Once done, click on OK, and you're 
back to the canvas.
4.
Repeat the select-and-paint process for each part. To illustrate the separate layers
being colored, let's look at the following screenshot:

17
Instant GIMP Starter
Every fill on the drawing is separated by layers to enable each layer to be modified without 
affecting the others. You may also specify the opacity of individual layers.
This concludes a brief tour of GIMP. These few basic steps are just the tip of the iceberg. It is 
amazing what GIMP has in store for you.

Top 5 features you'll want to know about
This is the most interesting section of this book. In this chapter we are actually going to discover
how to work like an artist.
The five topics that we are going to look at are how to:
Ê
Draw a poster
Ê
Make precise diagrams (infographic)
Ê
Combine multiple pictures
Ê
Install plugins
Ê
Use filters
Drawing a poster
A poster is a drawing that carries a powerful message. A poster usually contains message in text 
and images to complement the message. A poster may contain a very limited amount of colors.
We will go step by step to produce the following poster:
To produce a poster, follow these steps:
1.
Create a new file by clicking on File | New (or keyboard shortcut Ctrl +
l
N), and you'll be 
presented by this new file menu:

19
19
Instant GIMP Starter
Let's have a setting optimized for an A4 print; choose the A4 (300ppi) template for this
drawing. It is going to be a large canvas with 2480 x 3508 pixels. A large canvas means
the image created will be a very high-resolution image, suitable for printing. A low-
resolution would cause the image to get blurry and jagged when printed.
2.
Click on the Text Tool
Te
T
option to start putting text on the canvas. The setting of the text 
can be modified at the tool options. Here, I choose Rockwell font.

20
Instant GIMP Starter
3.
Now let's write PEN on the canvas. Click-and-drag to form a rectangle on the canvas. 
Type PEN at the placeholder, as shown in the following screenshot:
4.
Make another two rectangles for & and Pencil.

21
21
Instant GIMP Starter
You should have created three text layers; your layers menu should look like the
following screenshot:

22
Instant GIMP Starter
Now let's attempt to make a drawing of a simple fountain pen. To do so, follow these steps:
1.
To make a geometrical shape, we could use the selection where you begin by  
forming a rectangle selection, and put a stroke to the selection, as shown in the
following screenshot:

23
23
Instant GIMP Starter
2.
This requires a few steps to form the fountain pen shape, as shown in the  
following screenshot:
The previous screenshot contains a rectangle, a circle, and a rotated square. Each of 
them requires a selection formed using a rectangle, circle, and square. Then, a stroke  
is applied to the selection to form the shape.

24
Instant GIMP Starter
3.
Rotating the square is a bit tricky. Use the Rotate Tool option to do so. Create a square 
selection first (Ctrl + drag to form a square), click on the 
l
Rotate Tool option, and click-
and-drag the selection of the square to 45 degrees. You may also use the rotate menu 
box; this way the rotation is more precise. Refer to the following screenshot:

25
Instant GIMP Starter
4.
Complete the outline with the Pencil Tool option. Click a start point, and hold the 
Alt key to draw a straight line. Use the edges on the strokes for your guide to make  
t t
a fountain pen tip.

26
Instant GIMP Starter
5.
Now you should be getting used to forming  geometrical shapes. Remove unnecessary
lines using Eraser Tool option. Use the Bucket Fill Tool option to fill in with colors.
6.
To draw a pencil on the other side is simpler than a fountain pen. The basic shape to
form is shown in the following screenshot:

27
Instant GIMP Starter
7.
Notice, there are two circles; they were generated by clicking on the round selection 
tool, and holding Ctrl +
l l
Shift while dragging the cursor from the tip of the pencil.
t

28
Instant GIMP Starter
8.
Erase the unneeded lines, and start filling the drawing with colors. It should look like the
image shown in the following screenshot:
9.
Now let's paint the background that I would like to look  like a triangular gradient 
design. Using the lasso tool, in orderly fashion, click at the top-right corner, bottom-
left corner, top-left corner, and finally click the top-right corner where we started; a 
triangular selection is formed.
10. Set up a gradient fill to have settings like the following, and drag from top-left corner to
the center of the drawing:

29
29
Instant GIMP Starter
11. Repeat the same process for the other half.
12. To quickly invert the selection, to select the other half, press Ctrl +
l
I.

30
Instant GIMP Starter
13. Rearrange the words using the Move Tool option, so they align in the center of the
poster. Now we have a poster ready for print!
Drawing an infographic
Infographics are everywhere these days; they provide diagrams to visualize information.
Infographics are different than posters. While many consider that they look the same,
infographics carry visualization of data in a precise manner. Precision of the drawing is very 
important. We are going to create an infographic to educate people about African animals.
Here is the plan. I had been browsing the Web and found some interesting facts about African
animals. The following table shows the facts that I found out:
Giraffe
Elephant
Baboon
Lion
Cheetah
Speed
32 mph
25 mph
30 mph
50 mph
70 mph
Height
16 ft
10 ft
1.8 ft
5.5 ft
4 ft

31
31
Instant GIMP Starter
I also found some clip art for each animal to copy over to GIMP. Use your Internet browser, and 
go to http://www.freeclipartnow.com/animals. I would like to create this document in an 
A4 size image. To do so, follow these steps:
1.
Click on File | New, and create an A4 size canvas.
2.
Drag the picture into the canvas.

32
Instant GIMP Starter
3.
If the image does not have a visible alpha channel, please add one from the layer  
content menu:
4.
Remove the other surroundings, so that we are left with the shape of a baboon.
5.
Resize the picture so that the picture is proportionate with the other pictures. Use
information from the table to set the height. I represent 1.8 feet with 18 mm, as 1 foot 
is represented as 10 mm.

33
33
Instant GIMP Starter
6.
Select the shape with a magic wand so that it is easier to work with. Add a gradient to
fill the shape and stroke the outline. The result should look like the image shown in the
following screenshot:
7.
Repeat the process for lion, cheetah, elephant, and giraffe.

34
Instant GIMP Starter
8.
Now for the speedometer, draw a basic guide, as shown in the following screenshot:
r,r
9.
On the top of another layer, create radii of the circles. These will be the levels on  
r,r
the speedometer.

35
Instant GIMP Starter
10. This enables the layer to be copied and rotated to fill other quadrants.
11. After the second quadrant, rotate to fill up until the third quadrant merge all three
quadrants. Refer to the following screenshot:

36
Instant GIMP Starter
Now we have a near complete speedometer:
12. Clean up the speedometer and put the labels for each level.

37
Instant GIMP Starter
13. Let's draw the guide for the speedometer needle; we only need to find the center
of the circle.
14. Create a needle that points to zero, and color them according to the animal colors.

38
Instant GIMP Starter
15. Now rotate the needle to show the speed of the animal. Add a drop shadow right after 
that. Click on Filters | Light and Shadow | Drop Shadow to add the drop shadow.
While we're on the subject:
How do I calculate the rotation angle of the needle? Consider the following
values.
Speed of elephant = 25
Full quadrant indicator = 120
Which makes rotation:
The result is shown in the following screenshot:

39
39
Instant GIMP Starter
The overall picture would look like the following screenshot:
16. Now we are going to create an indicator to for the height of the animals. For that,  
we will use the pencil tool to create a straight line.

40
Instant GIMP Starter
17. Click at a point, hold down the Shift key, and it will form a straight line.
t t

41
41
Instant GIMP Starter
18. Add a text to make clear that each image represent height and speed of the animals.

42
Instant GIMP Starter
19. Use your creativity to make the title and the legends for the color-coded animals, as 
shown in the following screenshot:

43
43
Instant GIMP Starter
20. Finally, the infographic is done, as shown in the following screenshot:
y,y

44
Instant GIMP Starter
Combining multiple pictures
In this section, we will learn how to produce a picture composed of multiple pictures.
To do so, follow these steps:
1.
First, we choose a picture and open it as layers, as shown in the following screenshot:

45
Instant GIMP Starter
Following is the picture I selected:
2.
Add an alpha channel to the picture so that it exposes transparency, as shown in the
y,y
following screenshot:

46
Instant GIMP Starter
3.
Use a magic wand to select the sky.
4.
Cut it out and paste it as a new layer. 
5.
Shift the layer backward, so it lies at the back.
Leave the picture for a while; we are looking into drawing a monster on the background. I drew  
a picture of a monster on my sketch book and scanned it. Therefore, I can open it using GIMP.  
We can use threshold setting to get the outline clearer.
To draw a picture on the background, follow these steps:
1.
Use Select by color to select the outline of the monster. 
2.
Clean up the picture, and delete the background, so we can only get the monster.

47
Instant GIMP Starter
3.
Copy the monster and paste it over in the picture we were working on earlier.

48
Instant GIMP Starter
4.
Anchor the layer, and adjust the layer so that the monster falls at the back  
r,r
of the scenery.
5.
Next step is to create the fire. For that, create a new layer, and select a portion of the
r,r
layer near the mouth of the monster. Fill the selection with a gradient, as shown in the
following screenshot:

49
49
Instant GIMP Starter
6.
Deselect the rectangle, and select a bigger portion of the layer.
7.
Go to Filters | Distorts | IWarp to shape the fire to the gradient. Smudge the gradient 
pointing up. Use the Swirl CCW or Swirl CW option to create a beautiful effect of 
fierce fire.
8.
Then click on the Move radio button, as shown in the following screenshot:

50
Instant GIMP Starter
9.
Now that we have a fire-breathing monster, try to do some adjustment to make the fire
r,r
slanting to the position of the head. Use the Move Tool and the Rotate Tool options 
to do so.

1
51
Instant GIMP Starter
Now let's color the monster. To do so, follow these steps:
1.
Apply a gradient on the monster.

52
Instant GIMP Starter
2.
Finally, give the monster some shades using the 
y,y
Airbrush Tool option.
Now, we came up with a fire-breathing monster, terrorizing the neighborhood.
How cool is that!

53
Instant GIMP Starter
Plugins
Plugin are a very interesting part of GIMP. I am not going to explain how to install plugins step by
step. But, the plugin being advanced, I will have to explain how to install one.
Plugins can bring new functionalities to GIMP. It might be a basic batch rotation or a fantastic
vector drawing plugin that draws graphics based on complex mathematic calculation.

54
Instant GIMP Starter
I will be using my own watermarking plugin that puts a watermark on a batch of images. Follow 
these steps:
1.
Browse to https://github.com/fazreil/GIMP-Watermarker/blob/master/
fazreil.scm.
This page shows a plugin I made for GIMP. 
2.
Now, download it from the page.

55
Instant GIMP Starter
3.
Unzip the downloaded file to the script directory in your GIMP installation folder.
My setup follows the path, C:\Program Files\GIMP 2\share\gimp\2.0\
scripts, as shown in the following screenshot:
4.
Restart GIMP 2.0.
5.
After you have restarted the server, it will look like the following screenshot, with a new 
r,r
item in the menu:
There are many places where people keep their written plugins; you might find them if you
search in a search engine or head to http://registry.gimp.org/. Happy hunting and
installing!

56
Instant GIMP Starter
Using filters
Filters are a very cool feature in GIMP. We've used some filters in our work before (like the IWarp 
when creating the fire effect). This time we are going to use more filters to create the following 
picture:
To create the previous picture using filters, follow these steps:
1.
To create a new image, follow the settings shown in the following screenshot:

57
Instant GIMP Starter
2.
Render a blue fog as the background. Click on Filters | Render | Fog, and you will be 
presented with the following menu:
You will have a very random pattern of fog, as shown in the following screenshot:

58
Instant GIMP Starter
3.
I am going to paste the GIMP boy as a new layer to this drawing.
4.
Copy and paste a picture of your choice into a new layer.
5.
Use the Scale Tool option to shrink him to a smaller scale. Hold down Ctrl while
l l
dragging, to maintain the aspect ratio. In the following screenshot, notice that the
GIMP boy is too big to fit in this picture.
6.
Add a lighting effect by clicking on Filters | Light and Shadow | Lighting Effects.

9
59
Instant GIMP Starter
7.
Now, the surrounding looks better with the effect. Next, add in Fin just for fun, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
8.
