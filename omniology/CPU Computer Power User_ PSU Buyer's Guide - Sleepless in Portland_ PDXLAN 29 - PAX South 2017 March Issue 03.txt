AMD Announces First Three Ryzen 
Models; Sets Launch For March 2
AMD has been teasing information about its new Ryzen 
processor lineup since CES in January, but we now have 
more details and a firm release date. The company plans to 
launch its first three Ryzen chips—the 1800X, 1700X, and 
1700—March 2. The 1800X has base/boost clock speeds of 
3.6GHz/4GHz  and TDP of 95 watts. The 1700X has base/
boost of 3.4GHz/3.8GHz and the same TDP. The 1700 
has base/boost of 3GHz/3.7GHz but sips just 65 watts of 
power. The 1700 also will be the only one of the three to 
ship with a cooler, AMD’s new Wraith Spire. The company 
says the cooler operates at a quiet 32 decibels. Preorders 
in the U.S. for the new Ryzen processors are being taken 
by three retailers: Amazon, Newegg, and Micro Center. 
The 1800X/1700X/1700 processors carry MSRPs of $499, 
$399, and $329, respectively.
EVGA Announces Two Closed-Loop 
Coolers With RGB & Flow Control
EVGA has added two new closed-loop liquid CPU coolers to 
its product portfolio. The new EVGA CLC 120 and EVGA 
CLC 280 feature new EVGA fans, one 120mm for the 120 
and two 140mm for the 280, that the company says have 
a new blade design and “Teflon Nano” bearings to produce 
better cooling at lower noise levels. The coolers also have RGB 
lighting that can sync up with select models of EVGA cards. 
Color setting preferences can be saved to firmware. 
EVGA says it has new Flow Control software on the way that 
will let users control fan speed, pump speed, RGB lighting, 
and other settings. Other features the coolers offer include 
fully sleeved tubing and a five-year warranty. Both coolers 
come prefilled so you just plug and play. MSRPs are $89.99 
for the CLC 120 and $129.99 for the CLC 280.

interference) and reduce system crashes. The boards also 
feature enhanced audio specs and have special networking 
technology that helps maximize gaming speeds. 
Lian Li Releases Two-Chamber PC-O11 
Lian Li has officially launched the PC-O11, an aluminum-and-
steel chassis with tempered-glass panels on the front and side. 
The case handles motherboards up to E-ATX and measures 
506 x 277 x 457 (HxWxD, in mm). The case is another of the 
company’s two-chambered models, with a main chamber for 
showing off your motherboard and other main components, 
and a smaller back chamber that hides the power supply and 
drive cages. The cages hold up to four 3.5-inch and two 2.5-
inch drives, or six 2.5-inch drives. If you need more storage 
room than that, you can mount 2.5-inch drives on any of the 
16 (!) fan mounts that are inside the chassis. The main chamber 
is capacious and can hold 360mm radiators on both the top 
and bottom. There’s also room to place a 360mm rad up front, 
if you choose to remove the fan bracket that’s meant to hold up 
to three 120mm fans. The case can handle graphics cards up to 
430mm long and CPU coolers up to 150mm tall. It has eight 
expansion slots. MSRP for the new PC-O11 is $229.99.

Noctua Ships Coolers For AMD Ryzen
Noctua has begun shipping three special editions of existing 
coolers that are designed to work with AMD’s new AM4-
socket CPUs. The three coolers with designated SE-AM4 
versions are the NH-L9x65, the NH-U12S, and the NH-D15. 
Noctua says the coolers will offer new Ryzen owners three 
distinct usage scenarios. The NH-L9x65 SE-AM4 is a compact 
cooler for users with small-form-factor systems, while the NH-
U12S SE-AM4 is a midsized cooler and provides increased 
cooling capacity. The NH-D15 SE-AM4 is the cooler with 
the greatest cooling capacity and is meant for enthusiasts who 
are overclocking and pushing high-end processors to their 
performance limits. The special-edition coolers will come with 
a new mounting system for the AM4 socket called SecuFirm2. 
MSRPs are as follows:
• NH-D15 SE-AM4 = $99.90
• NH-U12S SE-AM4 = $64.90
• NH-L9x65 SE-AM4 = $52.90

Ad-Blocker Use Is Growing 
“Explosively,” Report Says 
About 11% of internet users worldwide use an ad-blocking 
program, equating to about 615 million devices housing 
such software, according to the “2017 Adblock Report” 
from PageFair. In 2016, use of ad-blockers climbed 30% 
globally, the company reports. PageFair’s research indicates 
that usage of mobile device ad-blocking software rose by 
108 million devices in 2016 to reach 380 million active 
devices. Desktop usage of blockers, meanwhile, climbed 
by 34 million to hit 236 million devices—that despite the 
fact that “ever smaller numbers of people” are using desktop 
and laptop computers, PageFair states. In terms of regional 
usage, PageFair found that mobile ad-block usage is growing 
explosively in Asia and is set to spread to North America 
and Europe. Specifically, the company’s data indicates that 
mobile ad-block usage “surged” by 40% in the Asia-Pacific 
region last year. 
Apps Transform How We Interact 
With Each Other & The World
In 2016, smartphone users downloaded more than 90 billion 
apps (up 15% from 2015) and spent about 900 billion hours 
using the apps on their phones (up 25%), according to a study 
by the analytics and market intelligence group App Annie. 
“Apps are transforming how we interact with the world and 
each other,” said App Annie’s Eric Thompson. The App Annie 
report looked at data from both the iOS App Store and Google 
Play and found that apps (excluding games) contributed more 
to overall download growth than games. On the App Store, top 
growth categories were finance, travel, and photo and video; on 
Google Play, the top categories by growth were productivity, 
tools, and social. Compared to iOS, Android is especially 
prevalent among developing markets, according to App Annie, 
where new users are downloading app “essentials.” In more 
developed markets, where iOS is better represented, users likely 
have already downloaded essential apps.

LibreOffice 5.3 easier to develop, maintain, and debug. 
LibreOffice 5.3 improvements include new features such as a 
cross-platform text layout engine, a revised Help menu, and 
better import/export filters to new and legacy Microsoft Office 
documents. LibreOffice Online allows for basic collaborative 
editing of documents in a 
browser. The Writer application 
lets you more easily apply 
formatting to a table and also 
lets you quickly customize page 
settings or jump to other pages in a document. Calc has new 
default cell styles, improved compatibility with other spreadsheet 
software, and a text-entry box to more easily narrow down the 
functions you’re looking for. Impress now starts with a template 
selector and has a new Slide Properties Deck. You can download 
the updated office suite at www.libreoffice.org/download.
Newest Version Of LibreOffice 
Improves Functionality & Interface  
The LibreOffice office suite was first released about six years 
ago, but the latest version, 5.3, marks one of the most feature-

produced. There are new 
features such as collaborative 
editing, which increase its 
competitiveness with other 
offerings, the foundation 
notes, along with incremental improvements that add to the 
program’s reliability, interoperability, and user-friendliness. 
In its six-year history, LibreOffice has attracted more than 
1,100 developers, said Michael Meeks, a board member of 
The Document Foundation. In the past two years, he said, 
the foundation has had an average of 300 people active on the

List Of Most-Used Passwords 
Remains Consistent 
What is 123456? No. 1 on the list of the most-used passwords, 
according to Keeper Security. That’s despite years of work to 
educate users on the need for creating more unique, stronger 
passwords. “While it’s important for users to be aware of risks, 
a sizable minority are never going to take the time or effort 
to protect themselves,” said Keeper Security CEO Darren 
Guccione. His suggestion? “IT administrators and website 
operators must do the job for them.” In creating the list, 
Keeper Security, which specializes in password management 
and digital vault software, looked at 10 million passwords from 
data breaches that occurred in the past year. Four of the top 
10 passwords have six characters or fewer, which means brute-
force cracking software and hardware can unscramble them 
in seconds. Even more clever attempts to secure passwords—
1q2w3e4r and 123qwe, for example— are weak because 
dictionary-based password crackers know how to look for 
sequential key variations, Guccione notes. Here are the others 
in the top five: 123456789, qwerty, 12345678, and 111111. 
Mozilla Effort Aims To Track 
The Health Of The Internet 
Mozilla—a group whose goal is to ensure the internet is a global 
public resource open and accessible to all—has launched a new 
open-source initiative to document and explain what’s happening 
to the health of the internet. The Internet Health Report 
looks at five key areas: Open Innovation, Digital Inclusion, 
Decentralization, Privacy and Security, and Web Literacy. It 
attempts to answer questions such as “Who is welcome online?,” 
“Who controls the internet?,” and “Who can succeed online?” 
Right now, Solana Larsen, editor of the report, calls the initiative 
(in version 0.1) “a snapshot of a moment in time in the life of 
the internet.” It includes articles examining the issues in each key 
area. Mozilla will be gathering feedback through March, with 
plans to then work with partners and develop metrics for the 
initiative. It’ll then spend July to September working with allies 
to shape the next version of the report, which it expects to release 
during the fourth quarter.

We All Like 
Our Social Media 
Some people think all millennials 
are addicted to posting and texting, 
but a study by The Nielsen Co. 
on adult media usage revealed 
members of Generation X spend 
more time on social media. The 
heaviest users of social media, 
though, are not defined by age or 
generation, but by gender. Females 
in general not only spend more time online than males, but they also devote about 25% of their online 
time to social media sites. Males tend to spend less time online overall and about 19% of that time is 
spent on social media. Nielsen says while females average a little more than 6.5 hours per week on 
social media, the heaviest users spend about three hours every day interacting with social media sites.

If something with your overclock 
should go wrong, it’s easy to figure 
out the problem, thanks to onboard 
LEDs that will light up if the CPU, 
memory, graphics card, or storage is 
malfunctioning. A debug display is 
present to troubleshoot other issues. 
There’s also an SB switch, which disables 
the board’s DualBIOS function, should 
it get stuck in a loop during a BIOS

A high-performance rig is no problem 
for the GA-Z270X-UD5. The mainboard

and GIGABYTE has tested it with XMP 
profiles as fast as 4133MHz. GPU-
wise, you can install up to 2-way SLI

equips the motherboard with high-grade, 
precise power-handling to support the 
extreme loads and heat generated by 
overclocking. Power trace paths, for 
example, are built with additional copper 
to handle higher than normal loads. The 
high-quality solid state capacitors are also 
rated to work at maximum efficiency for 
extended periods of time. Overclockers 
should also like that the pins in the CPU 
socket feature 15 Micron thick plating 
(conventional sockets are five microns 
thick) to improve connectivity and 
reliability. 
With such overclocking potential, 
it’s smart that GIGABYTE includes 
onboard tools and features to quickly 
reach peak performance. The voltage 
measurement points include VCCIO, 
VAXG, VDIMM, DDRVTT, PCHIO, 
VSA, VPP_25V, and VCORE to feed 
real-time power measurements to a 
multimeter. GIGABYTE also provides

accents are much more likely to go with 
the components in a build, such as an air 
cooler and aftermarket GPU heatsinks. 
The PCB is still dark black and will blend 
into the dark spaces of your case. 
In terms of expansion slot layout, 
we like that GIGABYTE includes two 
slots worth of space between the top 
two PCIe x16 slots, as the layout gives 
high-powered GPUs room to breathe. A 
third PCIe slot is available, but it shares 
bandwidth with the bottom two PCIe 
x1 slots. Another PCIe x1 slot is located 
above the top PCIe x16 slot, making it 
a nice spot for an add-in sound card or 
wireless card because the PCIe x1 slot 
won’t be blocked be a dual-slot GPU. 
The top PCIe x1 slot also doesn’t share 
bandwidth with any other slots.
We tested the GA-Z270X-UD5 with 
an Intel Core i7-6700K, GIGABYTE’s 
GeForce GTX 1080 Xtreme Gaming, 
16GB of Corsair Vengeance LED 16GB 
DDR4-3200MHz, and a 480GB Patriot 
Hellfire SSD. In 3DMark’s Fire Strike 
Extreme test, the system produced an 
overall score of 10040, a result that’s 
propped up by the Graphics Score of 
11048. The Intel Core i7-6700K was 
efficient in POV-Ray 3.7 with a mark 
of 1976.63 pixels per second. Storage 
speeds with Patriot’s Hellfire reached 
sequential reads of 2598MBps and writes 
of 1392MBps.
Packed with a number of enthusiast 
features, GIGABYTE’s GA-Z270X-UD5 
is a good fit for anyone who plans to 
tweak voltages and optimize component 
performance. We also like the variety of 
storage devices it supports, as well as the 
onboard connectivity. In short, there’s 
very little chance the GA-Z270X-UD5 
won’t support the hardware in your 
Just about all possible storage devices 
are supported. The M.2 slot supports 
both PCIe and SATA M.2 storage, 
as well as all M.2 form factors (type 
2242/2260/2280/22110). GIGABYTE 
also includes a U.2 slot, should you have 
a 2.5-inch Intel SSD 750 Series drive. 
Six 6Gbps SATA ports provide ample 
options for SATA SSDs and HDDs. 
Interestingly, two of the 6Gbps SATA 
ports also support SATA DOM (Disk on 
Module) devices, which are small flash 
memory modules that can serve as boot 
and recovery drives.
I/O connectivity on the rear panel is 
as impressive as the onboard storage. A 
Thunderbolt 3 port is the headliner, as it 
supports transfer speeds up to 40Gbps. 
There’s also a USB 3.1 port, three USB 
3.0 ports, and two USB 2.0 ports for 
peripheral expansion. GIGABYTE 
includes two wired NICs, an Intel 
i219 and Intel i211, that both work 
with the included cFos Speed utility to 
automatically prioritize network traffic. 
The GA-Z270X-UD5 looks nothing 
like recent Ultra Durable series boards. 
Gone are the gold heatsinks and trim, 
which is a smart move because there just 
aren’t many PC components with gold 
in the color scheme. The silver accents 
nicely match the steel shielding on the 
PCIe and DIMM slots. Overall, the silver

MSI CORE FROZR L
coolers that boast 8mm heatpipes within 
a slim fin array, nor are there a lot of 
8mm heatpipe air coolers at the CORE 
FROZR L’s $49.99 price. The 8mm 
heatpipes help the air cooler to dissipate 
up to 200 watts of heat, according to 
MSI. The included 120mm TORX fan 
is another bonus with a static air pressure 
up to 2.09mmH20 and a maximum air 
flow of 71.27cfm. The PWM controlled 
fan spins anywhere between 500rpm 
and 1,800rpm, depending on load. At 
1,800rpm, MSI rates the fan for a noise 
level of 33.6dB(A).
The CORE FROZR L installation 
process is fairly simple. There’s a universal 
backplate that mounts to the back of 
your motherboard. MSI also includes a 
universal anchor plate, which replaces 
the Intel- or AMD-specific bracket you 
typically need to attach to the heatsink. 
By using two thick metal plates as a 
mounting mechanism, MSI believes the 
CORE FROZR L will prevent bends to 
the motherboard over the long term. A 
thick metal strap goes over the heatsink’s 
baseplate and screws into the universal 
anchor to secure the air cooler. Our 
M
SI’s FROZR technology is no 
stranger to enthusiasts, having 
been utilized in MSI GPUs for almost 
a decade. If the FROZR thermal design 
is good enough to cool off the hottest 
GPUs on the planet, it only makes sense 
to adapt the technology for a CPU cooler. 
Enter the CORE FROZR L. This tall air 
cooler features 8mm, nickel-plated copper 
heatpipes—just like the ones you’ll find 
on many MSI GPU coolers. There’s also a 
120mm TORX fan to effectively dissipate 
heat while generating a minimum amount 
of noise.
From the outside, the CORE FROZR 
L looks like a lot of air coolers on the 
market. The 120mm TORX fan clips 
onto a tall array of aluminum fins that 
tower over the CPU socket. The four 
8mm heatpipes are spaced across the fin 
array to efficiently disperse heat. MSI also 
includes two swappable covers (one silver 
and one black) to attractively conceal the 
fin array. When the system is powered 
on, an LED illuminates MSI’s GAMING 
logo and red accents behind the cover.
What makes the CORE FROZR L 
different? To start, there aren’t many air 
biggest complaint about the CORE 
FROZR L installation is the excess 
fan cabling, which requires some cable 
management to conceal.
We paired the CORE FROZR 
L with an Intel Core i7-6700K and 
GIGABY TE’s GA-Z270X-UD5 
motherboard to test it under load. After 
running POV-Ray 3.7 for 10 minutes, 
the processor reached a maximum 
temperature of 61 degrees Celsius 
with an average temperature of 58.7 
C. Next, we ran Prime95’s Small FFT 
test for 10 minutes, and the CPU’s 
average temperature raised to 64.8 C 
with a maximum of 67 C. The cooling 
performance is excellent for a CPU cooler 
in the $50 price range.
Good looks, quiet operation, a 
solid mounting system, and plenty of 
headroom for overclocks are positive 
attributes for any CPU cooler, let alone 
a $49.99 air cooler. The CORE FROZR 
L is absolutely a successful adaption of 
MSI’s FROZR technology.  ■

Patriot Viper 4 Series DDR4-2800 SO-DIMM 16GB
The kit we received contained a matched 
pair of 8GB DDR4-2800 SO-DIMMs, 
but as is typical with Patriot’s families of 
enthusiast memory, the Viper 4 Series 
SO-DIMM lineup encompasses a range of 
speeds and capacities. Batting leadoff is a 
single 8GB stick of DDR4-2400, and the 
Viper 4 Series’ cleanup hitter is a 32GB kit 
(2 x 16GB) of DDR4-2800. Being able 
to buy individual sticks of Viper 4 Series 
SO-DIMMs is a nice option.
Farther down the spec sheet, our test 
kit compares favorably with other DDR4 
SO-DIMMs on the market. The memory 
boasts timings of 18-18-18-43, and the 
operating voltage is 1.2V. Patriot has been in 
the memory game for over three decades, so 
it isn’t terribly surprising that the company 
backs the Viper 4 Series SO-DIMMs with a 
limited lifetime warranty.
As far as aesthetics go, if you’re familiar 
with Patriot’s Viper 4 DDR4 for desktop 
PCs, then the Viper 4 SO-DIMMs will 
be immediately recognizable. Visually, the 
mini modules simply took a page from 
C
an we all agree that it’s time to stop 
calling SO-DIMM DRAM “laptop 
memory”? Despite the fact that SO-
DIMMs continue to be the go-to memory 
for notebooks ranging from Chromebooks 
to DTRs, the modules have carved out a 
role in many other systems, particularly 
mini/SFF PCs, HTPCs, and even some 
Mini-ITX motherboards. Now that 
enthusiasts and manufacturers alike have 
recognized they can turn to SO-DIMMs to 
save space without sacrificing performance, 
there’s a greater need for reliable, high-
performance memory. Brand X ain’t going 
to cut it.
Thankfully, enthusiast memory makers 
have recognized that need. Now that 
DDR4 has trickled down to mainstream 
systems, the usual suspects—Patriot 
included—have expanded their portfolios 
to give power users access to top-notch 
SO-DIMMs. This month, a 16GB kit 
of Patriot’s Viper 4 Series SO-DIMMs 
slithered into our lab, ready to sink its 
fangs into a few benchmarks.
their big brothers and shrunk it down 
to SO-DIMM size. That’s fine in our 
book, since the Viper 4 heat spreaders 
are attractive without being gaudy. It’s 
a shame, though, that most compatible 
systems keep their memory tucked away 
out of sight.
We mentioned mini PCs as a perfect 
candidate for enthusiast-grade SO-
DIMMs, and that’s just what we used to 
test our kit. Dropped into an Intel Skull 
Canyon NUC, the Viper 4 Series DDR4-
2800 kit rampaged through SiSoftware 
Sandra’s memory bandwidth tests to 
the tune of 30GBps. At the time of this 
writing, we couldn’t find the kit for sale at 
its MSRP, but it’s nonetheless a solid set 
of SO-DIMMs. ■

Zalman ZM750-EBT
a secondary protection circuit that 
monitors the PSU rails for overcurrent, 
overvoltage, undervoltage, overpower, 
overtemperature, and short-circuit 
conditions.
The PSU’s modular cables are the flat, 
black ribbon style found on many PSUs 
these days. Zalman uses red connectors 
for the modular PCIe cables, which is 
handy for identification, but generally 
speaking, doesn’t look great inside a build. 
We’d have preferred black connectors, 
like what’s found on the rest of the 
cables, or at least, black connectors on 
the plugs going into the GPU. Cable 
lengths are decently long for the modular 
cables, but those with full towers might 
find the hardwired main power cable 
(19.69 inches long) and EPS cable (25.6 
inches long) too short to route behind 
a motherboard tray. Overall, connector 
selection is respectable with four PCIe 
6+2-pin, eight SATA, and six Molex.
A lot of modern cases come with PSU 
shrouds that conceal the unit entirely, 
but if your case doesn’t, Zalman has you 
covered. The fan intake, for instance, 
P
ower users in the market for a 600 
to 800 watt power supply have 
a tremendous number of options to 
choose from. At press time, there were 
165 PSUs between 600 and 800 watts 
sold by Newegg. The sheer number of 
choices means that a PSU must check 
a lot of boxes to even be considered by 
enthusiasts. Zalman’s ZM750-EBT meets 
the majority of the criteria we look for 
in a quality PSU. It’s 80 PLUS Gold 
certified, is semi-modular (with only the 
20+4-pin, 4+4-pin EPS, and two 6+2-pin 
connectors hardwired), comes with heavy-
duty rail protections to keep our rig safe, 
and boasts a seven-year warranty. 
With the ZM750-EBT, Zalman uses 
high-quality Rubycon capacitors that 
are rated to perform at temperatures up 
to 105 degrees Celsius. To produce an 
efficient, stable signal, the ZM750-EBT 
features an LLC converter circuit 
design and a DC-DC converter for 
the +5V and +3.3V rails. The +12V 
rail can support the maximum power 
of the PSU (750 watts) and an output 
load of 62.5A. Zalman also installs 
includes an attractive, gold brushed 
aluminum trim and a decorative fan grill. 
The rest of the PSU features a smooth 
black finish.
The ZM750-EBT fared well in 
our load tests. We installed it into a 
system with an Intel Core i7-6700K, 
GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1080 Xtreme 
Gaming, and 16GB of Corsair Vengeance 
LED DDR4-3200MHz. Then, we ran 
Prime95’s In-Place mode and Unigine’s 
Heaven 4.0 benchmark to create 
demanding loads on the CPU and GPU. 
At peak power, the ZM750-EBT reached 
345 watts and a power factor of .984. In 
general, power factor results were first-rate 
and routinely between .980 and .995.
Zalman aggressively prices the 
ZM750-EBT at $89.99, while many 
comparable 750 watt power supplies are 
well over $100. Despite the affordable 
price, there’s no compromise on 
efficiency, reliability, or warranty.  ■

Alphacool
Eiswand 360 CPU 
Alphacool also includes two quick 
disconnect fittings, so you can easily 
expand the system with other liquid-
cooling components, such as Alphacool’s 
Eiswolf GPX-Pro AIO—a GPU cooler 
designed with the same quick disconnects. 
Alphacool uses high-quality parts with 
the Eiswand kit. The NexXos XP3 Light 
water block, for example, features a cross-
slotted structure with backflow channels 
to maximize flow rate and recirculation. 
There are four compression fittings with an 
11/8mm inner thread (G1/4 outer thread) 
to perfectly fit the 11/8mm tubing. The 
Eiswand also comes with four long springs 
that slide over the tubing to prevent kinking.
The external unit features a NexXxos 
XT45 360, a full copper radiator that’s 
1.8-inches thick. The integrated reservoir sits 
atop the Eiswand, and Alphacool builds in 
a fill port with a window, so you can easily 
add coolant. To ensure constant operation, 
the Eiswand comes with redundant DC-LT 
2600 low noise pumps. The external frame’s 
base lights up blue during operation. You 
can turn off the LEDs by connecting the 
included silent adapter, which also drops fan 
speed from 1,100rpm to 700rpm. 
Installing the Eiswand 360 CPU is a 
little more complex than a closed-loop 
B
ack when cases weren’t regularly designed 
with liquid-cooling in mind, enthusiasts 
would sometimes bolt radiators and other 
liquid cooling parts to a case’s exterior. 
Typically, externally-mounted components 
didn’t look great, but the design did give 
you the freedom to use thick, long radiators 
that wouldn’t fit inside your case for high 
performance cooling and overclocks. The 
internal space savings was also helpful if your 
build used extra-large components, such as 
monstrous dual GPU cards.
The small form factor movement among 
enthusiasts reintroduces many of the 
liquid-cooling space constraints we faced 
in the past. At the same time, power users 
don’t want to ruin the slim, sleek look of 
a SFF build by bolting anything to the 
outside of the case. Alphacool’s Eiswand 
360 CPU is an elegant workaround, as it 
features an external AIO liquid cooling 
tower with a 360mm copper radiator, six 
120mm fans in a push-pull configuration, 
two pumps, and a reservoir in an elegant 
black aluminum frame.
The Eiswand 360 CPU is a complete 
cooling kit. Alphacool supplies its slim 
NexXxos XP3 Light CPU water block, 
black tubing, black fittings, liquid 
coolant, and an external power supply. 
CPU cooler, as you must cut the tubing, 
install the fittings and quick disconnects, 
and fill the loop. But as long as you have a 
convenient way to route the tubing outside 
your case, the process is much easier than 
designing the custom loop inside a case. 
The Eiswand 360 CPU’s temperatures 
under load were similar to, but a few 
degrees Celsius lower, than the company’s 
Eisbaer 360 (an internal AIO CPU 
cooler). In Prime95’s Small FFT torture 
test, Intel’s Core i7-6700K maxed out at 
75 C with an average temperature of 70 
C. When stress testing with POV-Ray 
3.7, temperatures dropped to an average 
of 60 C with a maximum of 64 C. 
Alphacool designs the Eiswand 360 
CPU so that you can proudly display it 
next to your system. But the included 
tubing is also long enough that you could 
put the unit on the floor, if you’re short 
on desk space or just want to avoid extra 
clutter. Power users and overclockers in 
need of some serious cooling—but lacking 
internal case space to accomplish their 
goals—should consider the Eiswand 360 
CPU to drive extreme performance.  ■

ENERMAX STEELWING
heat to rise up and out. In addition, 
the case will support installation of a 
120mm radiator behind the front-panel 
fan, which means that you can pack in 
an all-in-one CPU cooler if you like. Or, 
if you are skilled and adventurous, you 
can even build in a custom cooling loop; 
ENERMAX’s promo video for the case 
shows a STEELWING rig with a complete 
loop inside, and it looks quite good.
One item to note; the bracket that 
holds the front-panel fan and, potentially, 
a 120mm radiator, is also one of two 
available 3.5-inch drive mounts in the 
case. There is a dedicated 2.5-inch mount 
on top of the rear 3.5-inch mounting 
bracket. You can remove the rear bracket 
if you don’t need it (say, for example, 
you are running an M.2 SSD instead), 
and that will free up some space along 
the bottom. Also, installing a radiator or 
3.5-inch drive behind the front-panel fan 
will limit graphics card size, but there are 
some excellent small form factor graphics 
cards on the market today, so this shouldn’t 
present too great an obstacle. 
L
ast month we reviewed a really nice 
small form factor power supply from 
ENERMAX called the Revolution SFX 
650W. Fully modular and less than four 
inches deep, the SFX did a nice job with our 
benchmarks and would be a smart addition 
to any Mini-ITX or MicroATX build. Lo 
and behold, a month later ENERMAX sent 
us one of the coolest little SFF cases we’ve 
seen to date, the STEELWING.
The STEELWING gets its name from 
the seven wing-shaped vertical aluminum 
plates that are stacked across the front 
of the system right along the front panel 
opening, which is covered in mesh. The 
case is constructed entirely of anodized 
aluminum (ALUMINUMWING?), the 
only exception being its tempered glass 
left-side panel, and ENERMAX says that 
this allows it to dissipate heat at three times 
the rate of a similar case built from steel.
To that end, ENERMAX pre-installs 
a 120mm LED fan behind the vent-
and-mesh front panel for pulling in cool 
outside air, and built in a mesh panel on 
the top, as well, which allows ambient 
This is truly a small form factor case, 
not just a smallish mid-tower like some 
that we’ve seen. It will accept an up to 
11.4-inch graphics card (again, without 
a radiator or drive behind the front fan), 
and of course you can install normal-sized 
processors and memory, but everything 
else needs to be practically Lilliputian in 
order to make this work. The end result, 
however, is an extremely compact PC that 
is also light enough to lug around easily 
(great for LAN parties) and one that looks 
great all the while. The case comes in two 
color variations: silver with a green right-
side panel and a green LED fan behind 
the front panel, or black with a red side 
panel and fan. Regardless of which color 
you choose, this case punches well above 
its weight. ■

The Radeon RX 480’s Polaris 10 
GPU features 36 compute units, 2,304 
stream processors, 144 texture units, 32 
ROPs, and the VRAM runs with a 256-
bit memory bus. This variant comes with 
8GB of GDDR5 memory clocked at 
2,000MHz, but GIGABYTE offers a G1 
Gaming version with 4GB as well. AMD’s 
reference design calls for base and boost 
clocks set to 1,120MHz and 1,266MHz, 
but the GIGABYTE card ships with a 
slight overclock, up to 1,290MHz. 
The RX 480 G1 Gaming has a 150-
watt TDP and a single 8-pin PCIe power 
port delivers all the juice this card needs. 
On the back of the card, you’ll find one 
HDMI, one DVI, and three DP ports. If 
a VR HMD is something you own or plan 
to buy, make sure you have a monitor with 
a DP or DVI interface. 
At its default settings, this card 
delivers good framerates in the games 
we tested, but we did notice some minor 
thermal throttling under load. If you 
really want to push the pedal down, the 
WINDFORCE 2X cooler can handle it, 
and AMD’s driver-based WattMan utility 
or GIGABYTE’s own Xtreme Gaming 
Engine are two ways to squeeze a few more 
drops of power from this card. Even better, 
this card was selling for $235 as we went to 
press, making it a heck of a good deal.  ■

IGABYTE recently sent us its RX 
480 G1 Gaming, and we decided to 
repay the kindness by pummeling the 
unsuspecting piece of silicon with our 
suite of benchmarks. But before we get 
to the performance numbers achieved 
by GIGABYTE’s take on the flagship 
GPU in the Polaris lineup, let’s take a 
closer look at the extras you get when you 
choose this model. 
This card is strapped to GIGABYTE’s 
WINDFORCE 2X cooler, which consists 
of a matte black plastic heatsink shroud, 
a pair of 90mm fans, and an aluminum 
heatsink threaded with a trio of copper 
composite heatpipes, which are built from 
a hollow pipe made of sintered copper 
powder wrapped with another layer of 
copper with grooved inner walls. As liquid 
between the sintered and grooved copper 
layers heats up, it vaporizes and travels to 
the cool portion of the pipes, cools and 
condenses, and then cycles back to the hot 
portion of the pipe. GIGABYTE’s unique 
heatpipes boost cooling capacity by 29%. 
The fans on this heatsink are also atypical; 
they remain motionless when the card is 
idle, but spin up in opposite directions to 
create a more aggressive blast of cool air 
when under load. The GIGABYTE and Fan 
Stop logos are backlit with LEDs, which you 
can personalize using GIGABYTE’s Xtreme 
Gaming Engine utility.
The brushed aluminum black backplate 
is another feature that’s both attractive and 
functional, acting as another avenue for 
heat to escape from the GPU, VRM, and

State-Of-The-Art
Standards
WiGig
Unlike previous 802.11 wireless standards, 
WiGig operates in the 60GHz band to 
deliver much greater bandwidth and lower 
latency than what’s possible over the 2.4GHz 
or 5GHz spectrum—we’re talking data rates 
up to 8Gbps over a single band. 802.11ac, 
by comparison, tops out at a theoretical rate 
of 4.5Gbps with current consumer routers 
delivering maximum theoretical speeds of 
only 2Gbps. The move to the 60GHz also 
skirts interference that you might run into 
with nearby devices communicating via the 
2.4GHz or 5GHz spectrum.
“The problems Wi-Fi faces today are 
interference and capacity,” says Philip Solis, 
research director at ABI Research. “Some 
houses have a family of several people, a few 
of whom are streaming 1080—or even 4K 
video, now—and eventually, video quality 
will reach 4K HDR and 8K resolution.” 
Besides the bandwidth hogging video 
its use. But there’s new hope for WiGig, 
thanks to potential applications in VR and 
AR headsets, wireless docking stations, 
streaming devices, and wireless displays. 
Why WiGig?
The Wireless Gigabit Alliance was incor-
porated in April 2009 to develop wireless 
transmissions in the millimeter wave frequency 
band, and WiGig 1.0 was published in 
February 2010. A proposal based on WiGig 
1.0 was sent to the IEEE 802.11ad task group, 
which was working on a way to deliver high 
throughput over the 60GHz frequency. The 
proposal was approved in May 2010 and 
included backward compatibility with other 
IEEE 802.11 protocols. The IEE 802.11ad 
task group and Wireless Gigabit Alliance 
worked together to evolve the standard 
into the official 802.11ad protocol released 
in December 2012.
N
etworking standards are often developed 
and defined years ahead of mainstream 
adoption. The process allows all involved 
parties, from the IEEE (Institute of 
Electrical and Electronics Engineers) to 
router and device makers, to collaborate 
on the foundations of the standard. Some 
standards, such as 802.11n and 802.11ac, 
gain quick acceptance in devices and 
our home networks. Other times, the 
architecture is designed with an eye to 
the future. Instead of riding the fast track, 
these poor protocols must wait for the 
development of a practical application. 
WiGig, also known as 802.11ad, is 
a wireless networking standard developed 
in 2009 that’s always offered promise with 
huge bandwidth and low latency. Up until 
recently, the standard’s downsides, such as the 
inability to penetrate walls and short effective 
range (up to 33 feet), have severally limited

is actually a good thing for it,” says 
Solis, because it will be relatively easy to 
prevent congestion that’s so common in 
the 2.4GHz band. Many of the current 
use cases for WiGig are designed 
around point-to-point connections. 
Untethering VR headsets is s prime 
point-to-point application, as it would 
be extremely helpful to remove cords 
and free people to use the VR headset 
wherever they want to.
WiGig’s low latency is huge for VR 
headsets, as mismatches in motion and 
visual information can cause dizziness and 
produce an overall poor user experience. 
Leading VR headsets, such as the Oculus 
Rift and HTC Vive, for instance, utilize 
several different techniques in the 
software and hardware to keep latency 
below 20ms. It’s expected that any 
WiGig-certified VR hardware would 
be well under the recommended 20ms 
round-trip latency. 
Wireless PC docks are another exciting 
point-to-point WiGig option. Initial 
versions of WiGig docking stations 
required specific laptop placement to 
achieve the connection, but that’s not the 
case with newer WiGig chipsets. Monitor 
makers might even start to build wireless 
wired connection, but for those that do, 
WiGig and the 60GHz band may become 
the wireless spectrum of choice.
 “The fact that the 60GHz band is 
limited by obstructions, such as walls, 
streams, modern dwellings are likely have 
a PC or tablet accessing the Wi-Fi, as well 
as a few smartphones running apps that 
consistently ping the router.
“The solution [to the congestion] will 
be to divide traffic among the smaller 
2.4GHz band and larger 5GHz band, 
but also the 60GHz band,” says Solis. 
Shifting video streaming to WiGig, in 
particular, could prove an easy way to 
offload traffic from the 2.4GHz and 
5GHz bands. WiGig is merely a way 
to augment existing wireless networks, 
as its relatively short range prevents the 
standard from replacing many of the 
current applications of the 2.4GHz and 
5GHz spectrum.
Where Does WiGig Fit?
As more home electronics connect to 
the Internet via Wi-Fi, there could be a 
very real need for the 60GHz spectrum 
to clear up congestion and fix capacity 
issues. The Wi-Fi Alliance projects that by 
2021 more than 32 billion Wi-Fi devices 
will ship worldwide, up from a projected 
2.8 billion in 2016. Not every device will 
require bandwidth or latency that rivals a 
WiGig products bearing the Wi-Fi CERTIFIED WiGig logo meet interoperability and security standards 
established by the Wi-Fi Alliance.
WiGig is an option to untether the VR headset from the PC.
22 March2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

The 2.4GHz band could be the pathway 
to sync up and provide bandwidth-light 
Wi-Fi to mobile devices.
Ultra-Wide Wireless
The high transmission rates of WiGig 
are possible thanks to ultra-wide channels 
available in the 60GHz spectrum. 
“2.4GHz can be used for longer range 
with 20MHz channels, and 5GHz can 
be used for more bandwidth-heavy 
applications that still need whole-home 
coverage with 40MHz channels in 
802.11n, 80MHz channels in 802.11ac 
Wave 1, and 160GHz channels in 
802.11ac Wave 2,” says Solis. “60GHz 
will be used by 802.11ad, or WiGig, with 
2GHz channels.”
Specifically, the WiGig standard 
divides the 60GHz spectrum into 
2.16GHz channels. For reference, the 
2.16GHz channels are 50 times wider 
than the largest channels available 
in 802.11n and 10 times wider than 
channels in recent 802.11ac devices. 
Globally, not every channel in the 
60GHz range is available, but here in 
the United States, we should have no 
problems. The FCC has reserved the 
gadget receives the necessary bandwidth 
to get the job done. Assuming all devices 
are in range, your HDTV could reserve 
the 60GHz spectrum for streaming, while 
the 5GHz band, for example, is free to 
serve up data to the PCs in your house. 
docks into the display. “You will just place 
your portable PC on your workstation 
and it will wireless charge and connect to 
the dock via WiGig,” says Solis. “All the 
connections to the monitors, peripherals 
via Bluetooth, and Internet via Wi-Fi or 
Ethernet will occur between the dock and 
the peripherals and access point.” Wireless 
charging will need to advance with WiGig 
before we can eliminate the power cord.
WiGig access points could be a huge 
boost to home theater rooms, where 
people typically consume the most 
bandwidth. In this configuration, you’d 
likely need to run an Ethernet cable or 
use powerline networking to provide 
the best possible connection. Wireless 
repeaters, which receive and amplify a 
wireless signal, tend to introduce lag 
would defeat WiGig’s low-latency benefit.
Some WiGig-enabled gadgets are 
expected to support dynamic session 
transfer, so your router and connected 
electronics could switch among spectrums 
based on the most demanding load. 
Dynamic session transfer would require 
devices to feature tri-band radios that 
communicate over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, 
and 60GHz bands. Load balancing is an 
ideal way to make sure that every PC and 
Several companies have released WiGig wireless docks.
Tri-band wireless NICs might feature three wireless radios with a 2.4GHz band, a 5GHz band, and a 60GHz band. 
CPU  /  March2017 23

with the 60GHz spectrum requires some 
creative thinking to boost transmission 
power and reception quality. 
To start, it’s expected that most 
WiGig devices will use high-gain, 
directional antennas to compensate for 
60GHz propagation losses. Using high-
gain antennas with the 2.4GHz band 
isn’t always advisable in environments 
with crowded channels, such as an 
apartment complex, as increasing base 
station power can degrade capacity and 
signal quality to everyone nearby. But 
WiGig’s inability to pass through walls 
negates the problems we often see with 
longer-range wireless spectrums.
WiGig devices are also expected to 
use beamforming techniques, which 
use signal-processing technology 
to transmit and receive signals in a 
particular direction, rather than utilizing 
a 360-degree signal. The directional 
communication maximizes link 
performance and signal efficiency, which 
helps to overcome propagation losses. 
Beamforming also reduces interference, 
because there’s less contention with 
other wireless communications. If 
implemented correctly, WiGig could 
allow for multiple WiGig connections in 
the same vicinity.
Display Extension
The Wi-Fi Alliance developed a 
technical WiGig specification for display 
protocols to optimize the transmission 
of audio and video. The WiGig 
Display Extension uses PALs (protocol 
adaption layers) to support HDMI 
and DisplayPort standards, as well as 
the HDCP schemes that protect digital 
content. There are also input/output 
PALs to support USB peripherals, SD 
cards, and the PCIe bus. The WiGig 
Display Extension capabilities make it 
possible to use WiGig for wireless docks 
and VR headsets. 
Where To Find WiGig Now
Wireless docks were some of the first 
WiGig products to reach consumers. 
Dell, Lenovo, and HP have all released 
WiGig wireless docks that support 
be 68dB, which is 21.6dB worse than 
what we typically experience with the 
5GHz band. As we mentioned, any 
obstacles, including walls, human bodies, 
and furniture can also impact signal 
quality with losses up to 30dB. Signal loss

and other unlicensed uses.

Intel’s RealSense technology can combine elements of VR and AR into a single virtual world.

capabilities, including select configurations 
of Dell’s Latitude 14 7000 lineup. 
What’s Next For WiGig
Freeing VR and AR devices from 
wires appears to be the next big step for 
WiGig. Intel’s Project Alloy, for example, 
is an open VR and AR platform that 
combines WiGig with an Intel suite of 
sensing and computing technologies. Intel 
provides open APIs and development kits 
to partners, such as HTC, Oculus, and 
Razer, many of whom are expected to 
come out with products in 2017. 
At this year’s CES, Intel showed off a 
Project Alloy prototype wireless headset 
with the company’s RealSense technology, 
which is a depth sensor that can create a 
representation of the physical world in the 
virtual world. Intel calls the combined VR 
and AR environment “merged reality.” 
RealSense integration can help you to 
avoid running into real life objects when 
roaming around in the virtual world, and 
the technology has also been used to scan 
real objects in 3D, allowing them to be 
manipulated in digital form.
WiGig might also come into play with 
upcoming self-organizing mesh networks 
where each connection is categorized by 
use case and switched over to a connection 
that’s ideal for the job. Self-organizing mesh 
networks are more likely to be seen in the 
business space, but there are several new 
consumer options designed to provide 
seamless Wi-Fi connectivity over large 
households. The Orbi Home WiFi System, 
for instance, optimizes your connection over 
two 802.11ac bands and one 802.11n band.
Building Momentum
With a few emerging real-life 
applications for WiGig, now is the time 
for hardware and device manufacturers 
to start including 802.11ad radios 
in PCs, network adapters, and 
smartphones. Once the technology is 
built into devices, network hardware 
support of WiGig should follow. Failing 
popular device support, it’s possible that 
WiGig will find a home as a point-to-
point wireless option for displays, VR 
headsets, and wireless docks. ■
Intel’s Tri-Band Wireless-AC 18265 
was one of first products to meet the 
Wi-Fi CERTIFIED WiGig standard. 
The M.2 module is designed for mobile 
clients, such as portable laptops, tablets, 
and convertible notebooks. For WiGig 
connectivity, the Tri-Band Wireless AC 
18265 supports connectivity for two 
1080p displays using the WiGig Display 
Extension. The module also supports the 
WiGig Serial Extension for speedy USB 
3.0 data transfer. When not in range of a 
WiGig connection, the Tri-Band Wireless 
AC 18265 can connect over 802.11ac at 
up to 867Mbps. 
Qualcomm’s QCA9500 is one of the 
first 802.11ad-compatible chipsets to be 
Wi-Fi CERTIFIED WiGig. TP-LINK 
utilizes Qualcomm’s chipsets in its Talon 
AD7200 router that supports WiGig at up 
to 4.6Gbps, as well as the 5GHz band up 
1,733Mbps and the 2.4GHz band up to 
800Mbps. The Talon AD7200 was the first 
consumer router on the market to support 
802.11ad. And although we have yet to see 
an 802.11ad USB or add-in-card adapter 
from TP-LINK, there are a few laptops 
on the market with built-in 802.11ad 
dual displays, as well as the wireless 
transfer of USB and Internet data. 
Unfortunately, the initial WiGig docks 
appear to have a proprietary design and 
will only work with a select number 
of PCs made by same company. For 
improved device support, some WiGig 
docks also include a USB Type-C port 
that supports the same connectivity 
over a single wire. The Toshiba WiGig 
Dock, for example, is a no-compromise 
WiGig dock with USB Type-C ports for 
wired connectivity.
In October of 2016, the Wi-Fi 
Alliance created a certification 
program that ensures devices meet 
strict WiGig standards for security 
and interoperability. Titled Wi-Fi 
CERTIFIED WiGig, the list as of 
press time is fairly short with only five 
products, but more are expected to 
come throughout 2017. “Wi-Fi Alliance 
certification has a strong history of 
accelerating broad technology adoption 
across the industry, and we expect 2017 
to be a breakout year for WiGig on the 
heels of Wi-Fi CERTIFIED program 
availability,” says Solis.
Devices and routers can use beamforming to direct wireless signals where they need to go,

silver Airplex radiators from Aquacomputer.”
Aside from the paint, Fader did a few minor mods to 
his Corsair Carbide Clear 600C, including cutting a fill 
port hole on the top, and drilling a few holes needed to 
mount the system’s radiators. He also spent quite a bit of 
time planning and building Project Wifey’s cooling loop. “I 
wanted the loop to be very symmetrical,” Fader says, “So I 
spent a lot of time planning the loop out and I used acrylic 
pieces here and there to support it and keep it from sagging.”
Marital (& Gaming) Bliss
In addition to its Corsair Carbide Clear 600C case (which 
sports an inverted motherboard tray, by the way), Project 
Wifey consists of an Intel Core i7-6700K, an MSI Z170A 
XPOWER GAMING TITANIUM EDITION motherboard, 
16GB of Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 memory, dual 
EVGA GeForce GTX 970 FTW graphics cards configured 
in SLI, a Corsair RM850x power supply, and three 500GB 
solid-state drives. The cooling loop is built from the 
aforementioned Aquacomputer Airplex radiators, Fractal 
Design Venturi fans, EKWB waterblocks, Barrow fittings, 
and dual XSPC pumps. Fader rounded out the build with 
IceModz custom sleeved power cables.
Fader would like to thank his sponsors: Play-Asia.com, 
EVGA, Corsair, Titan Rig, and IceModz.

ast time we checked in on Travis “The Raw View” 
Jacques (who has recently begun going by “Travis 
Fader”), we were marveling at his first-ever “Mad 
Reader Mod” winner, Project Red Gotham in the June 2016 
issue. Project Red Gotham was very impressive, especially 
from a guy who says he just started building PCs in 2013, 
but Fader wasn’t done yet. He mentioned at the end of 
our coverage of his red small form factor mod that he had 
begun work on a new rig for his wife Rachel, who wanted 
a PC to game on. (Fader says she enjoys adventure games 
like Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor.) Thus was born this 
month’s MRM winner, Project Wifey.
Happy Wife, Happy Life
When Rachel asked him for a gaming rig of her own, he 
went to work. “I just like creating,” Fader says. “For this 
build, I wanted it to be shiny. I was thinking of a black dress 
with silver jewelry.” He tells us he was inspired to try Project 
Wifey’s very cool textured paint after having seen it on a few 
motorcycles; he says getting the paint right accounted for the 
bulk of the 40 to 60 hours he spent on the build. “The paint 
job took a lot of trial and error to get it the way I wanted it,” 
he says.
Fader used silver, black, and glitter clear on Project 
Wifey’s paint job. “It is hard to pick up the glitter effect 
in videos and photos, but it really makes it pop in person 
with this rainbow effect,” he says. “The MSI Titanium

Sleepless In Portland
It’s A Gamer’s Paradise 
At PDXLAN 29 
There are a lot of major LAN parties 
hosted all over the world, and we’ve at-
tended hundreds of them, but PDXLAN is 
the one that we keep coming back to like a 
bad habit. Well, we’d hardly call four days 
of nearly-nonstop gaming and comradery, 
an avalanche of amazing PC component 
prizes, and tens of thousands of dollars 
raised for charity a bad habit. Although 
we changed up our presence a little bit, 
PDXLAN 29 was the same great event, for 
fellow sponsors and attendees alike.
VR To The Masses
We recently got our hands (and faces) on a VR rig, and we thought PDXLAN would be a great place to bring it out and get some feedback on Arizona Sunshine, 
one of the VR games we were in the process of reviewing. (You can read our full take on the VR zombie slayer in this issue). Although there was a steep 
learning curve when it comes to getting around and reloading weapons, we heard plenty of good things from the people who took the game for a spin. By the 
end of the weekend, we were in the top 250 on the leaderboard and people were lining up to give the game’s Horde Mode another go.
30 March2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

Not Your Typical LAN Party
At PDXLAN, it’s not uncommon to look up bleary-eyed from your screen to see something unexpected happening. Yes, that’s a 
Doctor Mario competition happening in all its 8-bit glory. There was also a how-far-can-you-get-on-a-single-life in Super Mario 
Brothers contest, a Nerf dart headshot contest, and a build-a-graphics-card-out-of-duct-tape contest, the results of which were 
very impressive. And the prizes were graphics cards and some seriously powerful PC components. 
A decent number of PDXLAN attendees walk away from the LAN 
party with more than just some new friends and a couple dozen 
more hours of play time in their favorite games. This guy was clearly 
enamored with the Rosewill GUNGNIR he won at our raffle.  
“You just won a Rosewill RGH-3300 
headset!” Given his expression, we 
think he likes the sound of that.
A laptop probably isn’t the first thing 
that comes to mind when you think of 
a LAN rig, but this little gem has SLI, 
a mechanical keyboard, and a slick 
color-shift paint job applied by our 
friends over at XOTIC PC. The photo 
hardly does the lappy’s red-orange-
yellow sheen justice.

Mods, Mods, Everywhere Mods
This wouldn’t be a proper PDXLAN recap article without a heavy dose of mod talk, and this event gave us lots to talk about. We 
had 14 mods to choose from in our mod contest, and although the following four mods didn’t make the top five, we did see lots 
of potential. We’ll be keeping an eye out for what these guys do in the future. 
Dante Mutti told us that he won this Fractal Design case last year, 
and he was determined to mod it and bring his creation back to 
his next event. We love the circuit design vinyl applique, custom 
window, and ultra-clean interior. He’s also got separate SSDs for 
his Steam and Origin games; you know they fight when they’re on 
the same logical partition. 
Brian “Dr. Modalot” Scott brought his console/
PC Frankenbuild to Portland. He’s got front-panel 
controller ports installed for Super Nintendo and 
PlayStation, there’s an NES light gun bolted to the 
side panel that lets you power the PC on and off 
using the trigger, and yes, those are real bullet 
holes, courtesy of a 9mm pistol. 
Will Schmidt’s small but powerful phoenix-themed mod was a work in 
progress, but we were impressed with the intricate liquid-cooling setup

CPU Magazine’s Mod Contest
As you can see, the competition at this event’s mod contest was typically fierce for our finalists, and each one stands on its own 
as a prime example of a PC as a stunning work of art. But there can be only one winner, and you’ll have to wait until next month 
to see who scored the coveted “Mad Reader Mod” slot. Until then, here’s a look at the top five.
Scott McClain took the NCASE M1, the original crowdfunded mini 
PC case, and decided that it was just a little too small. So he 
embiggened it using plastic panels and bits of a second NCASE M1. 
The built-in monitor stand makes this the perfect LAN party system. 
Jeff Colia is the 
only one of our 
finalists to submit a 
scratch build, and 
you wouldn’t know 
it at first glance. 
This grey and green 
beauty features 
a smart-looking 
hardline tubing 
loop, and a unique 
LED system that 
emits just the right 
amount of glow.
We’ve been closely following Jon “PennyWise” Hansz’s progress on 
FrostByte for the last several months, and the final result is truly a sight to 
behold. The hand-painted Magic Sculpt dragon took dozens of hours just 
to paint. We’d say the end result was well worth the effort. Bravo, Jon!
This wasn’t the first 
time we’ve seen Jack 
“Dakotah” Bronk’s 
Iron Man-themed 
mod, built in an itty-
bitty EVGA Hadron, 
but we never get 
tired of seeing the 
impressively clean 
interior and arc-
reactor-equipped 
custom front panel.
Jason Pierce brought his impressive Voltron mod, and we can’t think of 
a better case to base a Voltron mod on than Cougar’s Panzer MAX. There 
are a lot of little details about this mod that we just love, from the custom 
windowed PSU shroud to the mecha-lion front panel.

PAX South 2017
Remember The River Walk
On January 27 through 29, CPU headed to the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center in lovely San Antonio, Texas for the third 
annual PAX (Penny Arcade Expo) South event. We’ve been exhibitors at all three PAX South events, and while the event may 
not quite match the attendee and exhibitor numbers generated by PAX Prime and PAX East, it’s a vibrant show that includes a 
cool expo, a nice-sized BYOC LAN, and all of the keynote and panel goodness that has helped to make PAX a household name 
among gamers across the U.S. and beyond.
If you’ve ever been to a PAX event on day one, you’ll recognize the 
line to get in . . . .
As always, the PAX lounge area and its beanbag chairs were a 
popular place to rest tired feet.

BYOC, Mods & More
No PAX would be complete without a BYOC LAN and its accompanying PC freeplay area. And, as you can probably guess, 
while we were in the BYOC we found a couple pretty cool rigs, as well, including one by Hassan Alaw, who has competed 
in the 2016 Alienware Case Mod-Off, Intel #ExpertMode Rig Wars, and so forth. Alaw’s Golden Age mod (below left) was 
the coolest PC we saw at the event.
eSports events are a big deal these days, and PAX 
included plenty for fans to take in. The Overwatch

MASSIVE
LANFest MLP Winter ’017
On January 6, 7, and 8, AJ Pircio and his staff held another legendary MassiveLAN event at the Erie County Fairgrounds in 
Hamburg, NY. Many of the folks involved with this twice-yearly LAN party have been getting together to play games and have 
a great time for the better part of 13 years, and Pircio has this thing down to a science. In addition to the usual LAN party fare 
(tournaments in games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Rocket League, League of Legends, and Overwatch), the 240-seat 
MLP ‘017 included cool stuff like a Duck Game tourney, a Rainbow Six Siege contest, and a ton of cool AFK events like a Moun-
tain Dew taste test, Hard Drive Hockey, and a contest called Floppy Ninja where contestants try to knock down action figures on 
a table 20-ish feet away by tossing floppy disks at them.
Taking place so early in the year, MLP Winter ’017 was a great way to 
close out the holiday season. 
They start ‘em young in western New York.
The Mountain Dew taste test challenged contestants to guess which 
Mountain Dew flavor was which while wearing blindfolds. Correct 
guesses were awarded by points, and the most points won!

One event that has become a favorite among MassiveLAN attendees is Hard Drive Hockey. Participants head outside into the 
frigid Hamburg evening and compete to shoot old hard drives into a goal using a hockey stick. “We didn’t have an actual goal, 
because the one we used last year got broken during the event,” Pircio says. “We even had one guy bring his own stick just for 
this event, which was awesome to see.”
Ever played Floppy Ninja? MLP attendees have. 
“We set up a table with some action figures on it 
and pit two people against each other,” Pircio says. 
“Their goal was to knock down the figures from 
about 20 feet away; figures were worth various 
points, and we had a single-elimination-style 
bracket.” In the end, one of the MassiveLAN staff 
won the event, and Pircio says the crowd began a 
good-natured chant of “Rigged! Rigged! Rigged!” 
“But he truly did own it,” Pircio says.
Competitive gaming requires lightning-quick reflexes and nerves of 
steel—especially when the game is Duck Game.

Apex Predator 
Alphacool’s Eiswolf 120 GPX Pro Hunts Down Heat
GPU air cooler, which usually pushes 
builders toward watercooling. And if you 
don’t want to commit to a complete custom 
loop, your options further dwindle.
“Decent AIOs for graphics cards are 
basically non-existent on the market, other 
than hybrid solutions that rarely deliver 
sufficient performance,” says Eduard 
Peters, Alphacool market manager.
Alphacool, one of the pioneers of custom 
liquid cooling, knows its way around a 
waterblock (and radiators, pumps, coolant, 
F
or an enthusiast attempting to achieve 
truly heroic levels of performance, few 
villains are as nefarious as heat. Whether 
you’re aiming for a personal best overclock or 
trying to shatter an HWBot world record, 
runaway temperatures can quickly thwart 
your plans. Naturally, you’re going to need 
allies if you expect to win such a battle.
Most power users, even beginners, 
should have no trouble tracking down a 
capable aftermarket cooler for their CPU, 
but graphics cards are another matter. 
Attaching an air cooler to a processor is 
second nature for DIY builders, and the 
spread of AIO (all-in-one) liquid coolers 
has made upgrading to watercooling a 
relatively painless affair. Graphics cards, 
on the other hand, roll out of the factory 
with a cooler preinstalled, so a lot of users, 
even enthusiasts, have never had a reason 
to install or upgrade their GPU cooler. 
Additionally, as AMD and NVIDIA 
allow their partners to riff on their cards’ 
reference designs, slight variations in board 
layout may mean an aftermarket cooler for 
Company A’s graphics card is incompatible 
with Company B’s offering.
When someone does want to kick their 
GPU cooling up a notch, options are more 
limited compared to CPU coolers. Third-
party graphics cards typically have refined 
heatsinks and fans that rival any aftermarket 
etc.). The company, which is headquartered 
in Germany, set out to develop an AIO 
cooler for two of NVIDIA’s most powerful 
graphics cards, the GeForce GTX 1080 
and GTX 1070. The product of months 
of careful R&D, Alphacool’s Eiswolf 120 
GPX emerged from its factory ready to keep 
NVIDIA’s powerful Pascal GPUs cool.
A Wolf In Metal Clothing
Taming Pascal is no small order. When 
the GTX 1080 and 1070 run at full tilt, 
You can hardly throw a processor without hitting an AIO (all-in-one) CPU liquid cooler, but closed-loop GPU 
coolers are decidedly more scarce. Seeing an opportunity to bring its expertise to this underserved market, 
Alphacool unleashed the Eiswolf 120 GPX Pro AIO for NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 and GTX 1070 graphics cards.
“Decent AIOs for graphics cards are basically 
non-existent on the market, other than hybrid 
solutions that rarely deliver sufficient performance.”

a 3D needle scanner, which takes around 
three to four days depending on the size 
of the PCB,” Peters explains. “This gives 
us a scatter plot, which is transformed 
into vectors in order to make a 3D model 
of the card.” Alphacool then identifies 
all the board components that require 
cooling (including minor elements such as 
MOSFETs) and matches them to the 3D 
model. Once Alphacool has developed the 
model, a 3D printer creates a prototype to 
test-fit the card, and designers make changes 
until the waterblock matches the card. 
Aside from the waterblock, the 
Eiswolf 120 GPX features a complement 
of components that Alphacool created 
under its own roof. The AIO’s 45mm-
thick radiator shares its DNA with the 
company’s NexXxos family of all-copper 
radiators. Pull the radiator apart, and you’ll 
find copper everywhere—the cooling 
channels, of course, but also the fins and 
front chambers. In addition to superior 
thermal conductivity to aluminum, 
a radiator with wall-to-wall copper is 
an ideal mate for a copper waterblock. 
By maintaining consistency with the 
their core temp can crest to 94 degrees 
Celsius, which puts a tremendous burden on 
any cooler. When creating the Eiswolf 120 
GPX, Alphacool’s engineers paid attention 
to the present but also looked to the 
future . . . and NVIDIA’s biggest competitor.
“We wanted to alter the familiar 
GPX waterblock’s design, because [high-
bandwidth memory] is just around the 
corner and will bring with it a new set of 
requirements,” Peters says. “After testing an 
AMD Fury X, we have incorporated some 
further improvements. For example, we 
rotated the bottom plate of the waterblock 
and increased its size considerably in order 
to optimally cool the HBM storage. . . . 
The concept expanded from there.”
Peters adds that aesthetics played a big 
role in the Eiswolf 120 GPX’s design. 
After seeing some modders use markers to 
color over their graphics cards’ PCB, Peters 
says that Alphacool opted for a full-cover 
waterblock that would conceal most of the 
graphic card’s PCB.
Alphacool used its meticulous design 
process to develop the Eiswolf 120 GPX’s 
waterblock. “We scan all graphics cards with 
metals used in the Eiswolf’s closed loop, 
Alphacool takes galvanic corrosion out of 
the equation. Peters mentions that he’s seen 
the effects of galvanic corrosion, when it 
breaks downs the channels with a radiator. 
He says that every metal in contact with 
the coolant flowing through Eiswolf is 
either copper or brass.
Alphacool mounts a pair of Eiswind 
sleeve bearing fans to either side of the 
Eiswolf’s radiator. These PWM blowers can 
spin up to 1,700rpm under heavy load but 
can drop to 550rpm during periods of light 
use. When the fans are maxed out, they 
produce a maximum airflow of 63.85cfm, 
although that doesn’t tell the whole story. 
Airflow is a perfectly good metric for case 
fans, but when a fan is bolted to a radiator, 
static pressure is king. With this in mind, 
Alphacool designed the Eiswind fans to 
deliver the necessary static pressure “punch” 
to force a lot of air through the Eiswolf’s 
radiator fins. Alphacool rates the Eiswind’s 
static pressure at an impressive 1.66mmH20. 
Set up in a push-pull configuration, the 
Alphacool’s methodical approach to waterblock design includes using a 3D scanner to accurately 
survey the topography of each graphics card. After scanning a card, a process that can take up to four 
days, Alphacool can produce a precise 3D model as the basis for a matching block.
The Eiswolf 120 GPX’s secret weapon is its 
DC-LT 2600 ultra low-noise ceramic pump. The 
DC-LT 2600 is a suction pump, which reduces 
turbulence as it circulates coolant through the 
Eiswolf. The end result is a lower acoustic profile 
than traditional watercooling pumps.

soon as they’re unboxed. However, closed-
loop coolers regularly require builders to 
pay for that convenience by forfeiting an 
upgrade path in the future, since the tubing 
is effectively fused to the cooler’s waterblock 
and radiator. Alphacool didn’t want the 
Eiswolf to hamstring its customers’ upgrade 
plans, so the company took steps to keep 
enthusiasts’ options open.
The Eiswolf can easily link up with other 
Alphacool liquid-cooling hardware, notably 
its Eisbaer CPU AIO, but you can add it to 
any custom loop. For the former, separate 
Eiswind fans are well suited to blast air 
through the Eiswolf’s thick 120mm radiator.
Alphacool extended its watercooling 
acumen right down to the coolant that 
courses through the Eiswolf’s veins. Rather 
than using glycerin, which Peters says can 
eat away at any plastic, plexiglass, and PVC 
it contacts within a loop, Alphacool prefills 
the Eiswolf with Glysantin.
“Not everyone is familiar with the 
composition and possible materials used 
in a watercooling loop,” he says. “The 
consequences of that can often be found in 
forum discussions.”
Pumped Up
Many users assume that the waterblock, 
radiator, and fans do all of the heavy lifting 
in a closed-loop cooler, but they forget 
about a component that can be either an 
unsung hero or unseen saboteur. Alphacool 
opted for the former as it developed the 
Eiswolf 120 GPX’s integrated pump, a 
process that Peters says began in 2014.
“By the end of 2015, we had the 
first samples ready, which were tested 
independently by several reviewers. All 
of them were very enthusiastic about the 
concept, which encouraged us to perfect it 
and make it market-ready.”
Contrary to some watercooling manu-
facturers, which tend to rely on ODMs 
for their coolers’ pumps (and often more 
than that), Alphacool builds a number of its 
pumps in house. Nestled within the Eiswolf’s 
waterblock is the Alphacool DC-LT 2600 
ultra low-noise ceramic pump, which has a 
neat trick up its sleeve. Alphacool abandoned 
the traditional pump design and made the 
DC-LT 2600 a suction pump. According to 
Peters, the pump draws in coolant from the 
opposite direction; the coolant flows from 
the outer channel through waterblock’s cross-
slot structure. Then, the suction principle 
pulls the coolant up through the middle of 
the pump. Ultimately, the Eiswolf’s suction 
pump cuts down on turbulence as coolant 
flows through loop, diminishing pump noise 
to the point that the pump is almost silent.
Presto Chango
Part of the appeal of AIO liquid coolers 
is that they’re essentially ready to go as 
the Eiswolf’s quick-release connectors and 
then combine them with the Eisbaer’s 
connectors. For other loops, the Eiswolf’s 
standard G1/4 fittings let you incorporate the 
Eiswolf’s waterblock and radiator with other 
companies’ cooling gear.
Alpha Wolf
For first-timers, liquid-cooling a high-end 
GPU such as NVIDIA’s Pascal is a daunting 
process. Alphacool’s Eiswolf 120 GPX takes a 
lot of guesswork out of the equation and a lot 
of heat away from a GPU. ■
Alphacool’s Eiswolf 120 GPX works perfectly well as a self-contained unit, but it’s built to be easily 
expandable. Sporting a pair of quick-release connectors (top), the Eiswolf can join forces with 
Alphacool’s Eisbaer AIO CPU cooler in a matter of seconds. Beyond that, the Eiswolf uses standard 
G1/4 fittings (bottom), so you can incorporate it into custom loops, as well.

For a vast majority of us, gaming is a pastime that we enjoy in the in-between hours, when we get off work or school, when 
the kids are in bed, or whenever there’s a free moment. But for professional gamers, that leisure activity is forged into a career 
and honed into a lifestyle. Nowhere is that truer than it is at Counter Logic Gaming, one of the premier eSports organizations in
North America. At the Los Angeles-based headquarters, players, coaches, and a dedicated team of support staff work tirelessly 
to compete and win in global tournaments for League of Legends, Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Super Smash Bros., 
Overwatch, and more. 
To bring you an in-depth look at the inner workings of the organization and the world of eSports itself, we spoke to Matt 
“Trinitiii” Nausha, CLG Director of eSports; Tony “Zikzlol” Gray, LoL LCS Head Coach; Chet “Imapet” Singh, CS:GO Blue Team 
Strategic Coach; and Matthew Hwu, Head of Physical Performance and eSports Medicine.

Q
: Can you describe an average day in 
the life of a team member at the CLG 
house during the competition season?
MN
: An average day for a compet-
itive player begins with breakfast 
prepared by the cook [Andrew “mnqcook” 
Tye] at the main house. Players will eat and 
interact with players from different teams. 
Coaches and staff members are also present 
at the meals. After breakfast is completed, 
players will go to the gym or will run 
personal errands. Practice will start around 
12:00pm if there are no matches that day. 
Practices will include VOD reviews, scouting, 
drills, and scrimmages. The teams will take 
a break around 3:00pm where they will eat 
lunch prepared by the cook at the main 
house. Practice will resume until 7:00pm 
where the teams will then break and eat 
dinner. Usually, most teams and players are 
present at dinner. This is a great opportunity 
for those in the organization to connect with 
one another. After dinner, most teams will 
break for the day. Oftentimes players will 
choose to keep practicing.

Q
: What changes for the CLG teams 
during the off-season?
TG
: The competitive gaming off-
season for League of Legends is a 
small period after Worlds [the League of 
Legends World Championship] prior to 
the next season, which only really covers 
the months of November and December. 
With Worlds ending in late October and 
a new season right around the corner in 
January, there isn’t much time for staff to 
really enjoy their time off. Taking anything 
longer than a three-week break can be a bad 
decision, due to the fact that there are so 
many changes to rosters and ways that you 
can improve your systems to make training 
or competition more efficient. If you aren’t 
always pushing yourself to improve your 
team and your systems, you will fall behind 
in competition.
Q
: What are some of the difficulties 
young players encounter as pro gamers?
MN
: The hardest thing to balance 
is being a professional player are 
relationships. Relationships with friends, 
games. Mostly the talks between games of 
a set can cover topics such as needing to 
change our focus strategically, or how we 
view things mentally.
Q
: What are the head coach’s primary 
duties?
TG
: My primary duty as head coach is 
to constantly move the team in the 
right direction and consistently challenge 
my staff and players in practice to be the 
best people they can be in order to get the 
most out of the time we set aside to train. 
Q
: How does the head coach job differ 
from that of the player develop-
ment coach?
TG
: I’d say that Grant Rousseau, 
our Player Development Coach, 
focuses primarily on the out-of-game 
development to make sure that they are not 
just elite gamers, but also elite people.
Q
: What does the coach do during a 
match?
TG
: During training, a coach has 
a lot of options to talk during 
matches to change how practice is going, 
but when it comes to game day, there’s 
no player-coach interaction outside of 
a short 10-15 minute break between

by getting quicks on [Terrorist] side and on 
[Counter Terrorist] side, and then just hold 
position passively like a turret and lock down 
bomb sites. The lurking role, which is the 
simplest role, usually just involves a player 
to cut off rotations so when your team starts 
executing onto a site, anyone coming from 
the other side of the map has to deal with the 
possibility of someone coming from behind 
and trying to kill them or they have to deal 
with searching and wasting time finding that 
lurker so they don’t die from behind before 
they try to retake a bomb site. 
Q
: Do team members ever switch roles?
CS
: Team members occasionally switch 
roles. Teams usually do this when 
they feel like they’re in slumps so they can 
try out some fresh ideas and create a new 
team identity if they don’t want to go down 
the route of changing the roster. 
Q
: How important is CLG’s fan 
community and the eSports fan 
community at large? 
MN
: Having a community is very 
important. I would argue it is one 
should take. The AWPer is usually the guy 
who you will almost always give the AWP 
[Arctic Warfare Police, bolt-action sniper 
rifle] to, you can trust this player to get 
entries. The AWPer can open up rounds 
significant others, and family members can 
be hard to maintain during the competitive 
season. There is a lot of sacrifice that needs 
to be made to dedicate yourself to being a 
professional player. 
Q
: What are some of the roles that 
players take on in games that don’t 
employ traditional classes, such as CS:GO?
CS
: In CS:GO players take on specific 
roles, which include In-Game 
Leader, supporting, entry fragging, AWPing 
and/or lurking. In-Game Leading is probably 
the most crucial role in CS:GO; it requires 
a player to completely dedicate themselves 
to put their players in positions to take map 
control, execute strategies, and help players 
rotate around the map. A support player 
is usually someone who puts themselves in 
positions to set up other players (i.e. throwing 
flashes and smokes) and help them succeed, 
usually entry fraggers. An entry fragger is 
the guy who is going to go first in most of 
the team’s strategies. He might not always 
get a kill but he can get valuable information 
on where the enemy is and how they are 
set up. This information can influence the 
IGL’s decision on what bomb site the team

Q
: At the CLG House, there are a 
bunch of people trying to live and 
work together and it sounds like there’s 
a lot of opportunity for some solid life 
experience to happen. Is this the case?
MN
: Yes, the coaches and staff are 
technically in charge. The majority 
of players do not need much direction and 
are respectful of the rules that I have set in 
place for the homes. I would say for younger 
players that have never lived away from home, 
they get a lot of good life experience. Meals 
are provided to the players. However, there are 
many life skills that players must possess to be 
successful in the gaming house. There are a lot 
of interesting things that happen in the home 
and I do believe it would make a great reality 
show. The organization has a wide variety of 
personalities and some very funny people. By 
following our social media, you can see many 
of these experiences as they happen every day. 
Q
: Is it sometimes difficult to balance 
work and free time, or establish and 
maintain personal boundaries in such an 
environment?
MN
: I would say this is the hardest 
thing I struggle with. My 
objective is to assist players and teams to 
be the best they can. At the same time, I 
recognize the importance of players having 
balance in their life. Finding that balance 
can be hard at times. It is something that I 
am very cognizant of. I work directly with 
coaches to assist in identifying burnout and 
maintaining balance for the players. Having 
strong personal boundaries is important to 
have in this environment. Nearly everyone

spend upwards of 10 to 14 hours a day on

Marc “marcam923” Molella is the founder and CEO of the PC building and modding site PrecisionComputing.net. His mods 
have appeared twice in CPU’s “Mad Reader Mod” feature, first in the September 2015 issue when his RevoluTtion mod won the 
Case Mod category at the QuakeCon mod contest, and again in our May 2016 issue when we chose his Fallout Rig as MRM. 
His work has also appeared on GeForce Garage, Intel’s #ExpertMode Rig Wars, and more.
Modder Q&A: Marc Molella
One Fan Hole & He Was Hooked
Superman, I decided to repaint the entire 
case silver so everything was matching, 
add some blue accents and lighting, and 
of course a cool, backlit Superman logo 
on the backside of the case. 
Q
: Is there one modder in particular 
whose work inspired you to start 
doing aesthetic mods? Who was it, and 
what about their work got you started?
MM
: Back when I started, I was 
new to forums, and the entire 
enthusiast scene. It was the passion 
for performance that drove me to 
want to make my rig perform better 
Q
: How long after that did you start 
doing more aesthetic-based mods, 
and what was your first one?
MM
: My first ever mod turned into 
an aesthetic and performance-
based mod. I always try to not just 
improve the design or aesthetics of a case 
when modding, but also to improve on 
the overall case concept. Take something 
great and make it better. Once I had cut 
into the case (this was the era of silver 
cases), I noticed how the silver paint from 
the factory Diablotek case was different 
on the plastic pieces of the case than on 
the metal pieces. So with my love for 
Q
: Back in 2015, you told us in our 
Mad Reader Mod coverage of 
your RevoluTtion mod that you began 
modding primarily for performance 
reasons, to improve ventilation and the 
like. When was that, and where’d you get 
the idea to start cutting in the first place?
MM
: I began modding in roughly 
2004 to 2005. I had been 
building computers for about 10 years 
at the time, but on a small scale, maybe 
one every couple years or so. By 2004, I 
started to get into overclocking; shortly 
after that the Intel Core 2 Duo chips were 
arriving on the market, and I started to 
get into gaming via LAN with friends 
at our different houses locally. As we 
gamed more and more and had multiple 
rigs in the same room for long sessions, 
heat became a factor. I could not afford 
an expensive case that already had great 
airflow, although in my frequent trips 
to Fry’s Electronics and Micro Center, I 
often would check them out to see what 
I could improve about my own case. 
Coming from an automotive background 
and always working on cars, I had 
multiple air tools, and cutting tools, like 
tin snips, a Dremel, an angle grinder, and 
so on. I actually cut my first fan hole with 
snips, and was very rough, but I used 
some door edge guard to protect the edges 
that I had from the automotive work I 
did, and so the overall look wasn’t half 
bad. That just started the modding itch, 
and it was all downhill from there!
CPU  /  March2017 49

My favorite event to date was Rig Wars; even 
though it was a competition, it was friendly, 
and just felt like I was in a shop modding and 
building with a couple good friends, which 
Travis and Hassan are. That event helped me 
grow a friendship even stronger to this day 
with those two great guys, and for that I am 
grateful for the experience. 
Q
: How many complete mod projects 
have you done since you started 
modding, and which one of all them is 
your favorite?
MM
: Well, complete mod projects 
I would say somewhere in the 
ballpark of 25 to 50 mods, the more I 
think about it, the more I remember. 
Q
: Your first Mad Reader Mod win 
was part of our coverage of the 
QuakeCon 2015 mod contest; how 
many QuakeCons have you been to 
now, and how often do you take a new 
mod to the event?
MM
: I have actually only been to 
QuakeCon twice; 2015 was my 
first year in attendance. So in the two years, 
if you consider the live modding, I had 
three mods at the events. One I brought 
each year, and one created on site.
Q
: What are your favorite and least 
favorite parts of every mod project, 
and why?
MM
: Most of the time, projects 
have a limited time frame, so 
my least favorite part is trying to stay 
within time constraints to create the 
vision that is in my head, although so far 
I haven’t missed a deadline. My favorite 
part is twofold: happy accidents and 
paint work. Happy accidents are when 
something turns out better than I could 
have imagined, and I love the end results 
of quality paint work. Seeing the gloss 
come to life is very rewarding to me.
Q
: If someone told you they wanted 
to start modding and asked you 
what tool or piece of equipment they 
Q
: You’ve been involved with several 
modding events in recent years (Rig 
Wars, 24 Hours of Le Mods, and so 
forth). What has been your favorite event 
moment so far, and why?
MM
: Honestly, I loved the 24-hour 
live modding, but it was tiring. 
and competition between local friends 
that I gamed with. I believe the one 
name that I can remember from when 
I started was Mnpctech. But I found 
their website when searching for some 
mod parts and watercooling gear, and 
had not taken an interest in their mods 
at that point.
Molella’s favorite mod project to date is this one: RevoluTtion. This gorgeous mod won first place in the 
QuakeCon 2015 Case Mod category, and was our Mad Reader Mod for September 2015.
50 March2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

should buy first, what would you tell 
them, and why?
MM
: The first thing I tell people to 
do that want to start modding 
is to go out to their garage, gather some 
tools they already own, an old case, or scrap 
metal, even cardboard, and see what their 
hands can create. Our hands are the two 
most important modding tools we have, 
next to our creativity. Everyone has an 
ability to mod, whether through 3D design, 
photo editing, woodwork, metal work, etc. 
. . . . We just all have to find what we are 
good at and start a project, and the results 
will be epic! For a tool to go out and buy, 
a Dremel, as it is the most versatile to use 
across any modding material.
Q
: What do you look for first in a case 
when starting a new mod project?
MM
: Everything has to be cohesive. 
When starting a project, I choose 
parts from the case to the components to 
ensure they all flow together and fit the 
overall theme or mod. So it all depends on 
the mod that I am about to take on. But 
when choosing a case in general, I always 
look for one that has great airflow and 
modularity. From there, the tools do the rest. 
Q
: It’s time for Five Quick Questions!
1) Intel or AMD?
Intel.
2) Coke or Pepsi?
Pepsi.
3) Matte or high-gloss?
High-gloss.
4) “The Simpsons” or “Family Guy”?

A Hot Lead
Find Your Next Power Supply
Traditional marketing jargon for power supplies—”superb stability,” “whisper-quiet,” and “greater efficiency”—might 
sound more like promotional material for a home appliance than a PC part. But like a home appliance, we need a 
power supply to function perfectly every time we use it. Not every PSU, unfortunately, is up to the task for enthusiast 
rigs where continuous clean power is absolutely critical.
Wattage
As graphics cards and processors become more power-efficient, we’re starting to see less of a demand 
for high-wattage (1000 watts and up) power supplies. PSU manufacturers still continue to make high-
wattage PSUs, but the best selection (and the sweet spot for pricing) is generally found between 600 and 
800 watts. NVIDIA’s lack of support for 3-way and 4-way SLI with its 10 Series GPUs also reduces the 
need for kilowatt-plus PSUs.
Efficiency
Steady advancements in power supply efficiency have led to the creation of multiple 80 PLUS certifications. 80 
PLUS Titanium is currently the top level, requiring a PSU to be at least 90% efficient at 10%, 20%, 50%, and 
100% loads, but not many PSUs reach such lofty standards. 80 PLUS Platinum (the second-highest certification) 
and Gold (third-highest) are far more common. Besides a small break on your electric bill, higher efficiency 
models tend to produce less heat.
SFX Form Factor
To maximize space, some small form factor cases require the use of an SFX power supply. In the past, the 
miniature SFX form factor offered limited support for power-user wattages and connectivity, but newer models 
reach between 500 and 700 watts. And with more juice, PSU makers can include multiple PCIe connectors to 
support a powerful GPU. It’s never been easier to build a powerful small form factor rig.
We know that your components and budget play a huge role in selecting a power supply, so you’ll find a wide 
variety of wattages and price points in our buyer’s guide. For easy comparison, there’s a chart at the end 
containing each unit’s key specifications.

Why You’ll Dig It: The RMx series is designed to last you through your current build and beyond. Corsair tests the completely modular RMx models 
at 50 C, so you can be sure the PSUs provide the rated power, even in cases filled with heat-generating components. The RM850x also won’t increase 
temperatures in your rig, as the PSU’s high-efficiency operation (80 PLUS Gold) helps reduce waste heat. The high-efficiency design also allows Corsair to 
suspend fan rotation until load demands, and even then, it’s unlikely you’ll hear the 135mm fan over other system components. Corsair is so confident in 
the RMx series, it backs the PSUs with a 10-year warranty. There’s plenty of connectivity to power a high-end build with two EPS, six PCIe, 10 SATA, and 
eight Molex connectors. Most of the modular cables are flat to make cable routing easier and improve airflow inside your case.

Why You’ll Dig It: A fair number of small form factor cases, such 
as ENERMAX’s STEELWING, now require an SFX power supply, which 
is much smaller than a standard ATX PSU. The REVOLUTION SFX 650W 
is one of the highest wattage SFX PSUs on the market, and according 
to ENERMAX, it’s the highest wattage SFX PSU with a standard 3.94-
inch depth. Outside of the REVOLUTION SFX 650W’s small dimensions, 
the PSU offers the connectivity and features you’d expect on an 
enthusiast-level 650 watt power supply. The REVOLUTION SFX 650W 
meets the 80 PLUS Gold certification, is fully modular, and comes 
with a PWM controlled fan for quiet operation. The REVOLUTION SFX 
650W’s 80mm fan won’t start spinning until load goes above 195 
watts, which means the unit will be completely silent when your PC is 
idle.

Windows 10 Game Mode
F
or a vast majority of us, the OS installed 
on our PC is a means to an end. It’s 
more of a tool shed: we get excited about 
what’s hanging on its walls or what’s inside, 
not the container itself. But as tool sheds 
go, Windows 10 seems to be evolving in 
ways that make what we do with our PCs 
better and more engaging. This month 
we’re talking about Game Mode, one of 
the bullet points of Microsoft’s Creators 
Update, slated to arrive in the spring. 
According to Microsoft, Game Mode is 
designed to increase the performance of 
games, regardless of whether you bought 
them on Steam, GOG, the Windows 
Store, a brick-and-mortar retail store, or 
anywhere else. 
Last month’s Software Tips & 
Projects article revealed some promising 
performance advantages for those running 
Win10 and a DirectX 12-capable graphics 
card. Microsoft has tied new versions of 
DirectX to the contemporary OS before, 
for instance, DirectX 10 and Windows 
Vista. But in addition to supporting any 
Win32 and UWP (Universal Windows 
Platform) title, Game Mode is API 
and DirectX version-agnostic, which 
means there should be benefits for 
Doom running in Vulkan or OpenGL, 
Microsoft’s UWP-based Forza Horizon 
3, Gabe “Windows-8-is-a-catastrophe” 
Newell’s Half-Life 2 Episode 2, and any 
future installment of that franchise should 
hell freeze over and pigs take wing. So 
to recap, Game Mode can deliver better 
game performance, for all of our games, 
and the cost of admission is merely 
Windows 10. Where do we sign up?
What Does Game Mode Do?
According to Microsoft, Game Mode 
aims to increase peak and average frame 
rates, or consistency. It does this by giving 
the crucial game processes priority access 
to the CPU and GPU resources they need 
when running in the foreground. As a 
result, background processes will necessarily 
run slower, but if you’re like most people, 
the game will be running full screen and 
occupying 100% of your attention anyway. 
Because the feature isn’t quite ready 
for consumers, there’s not a whole lot of 
documentation that details exactly how 
the OS gives games higher-priority access 
to system resources in Game Mode. As we 
went to press, there was no list of games 
that benefit the most, or even a range 
of performance improvements to expect. 
Given the varying ways in which games 
leverage system resources, we wouldn’t 
expect every game to benefit in the same 
ways. At this point, we still don’t know 
if Game Mode juggles background OS 
resources, those dedicated to third-party 
apps, or both. 
Although there’s a distinct lack of 
information from Microsoft, we’re not 
completely in the dark. Game Mode, as 
well as a few other notable features from 
the Creators Update, is currently available 
in a handful of the Windows 10 Preview 
builds, which any Win10 user can install 
and begin checking out at any time. 
Be An Insider
If you want to try Game Mode right 
now, ahead of the official launch of the 
Creators Update coming in the spring, 
you’ll need to join the Windows Insider 
Program by visiting insider.windows.com 
and clicking the Get Started button. 
Microsoft has been using the Insider 
Program to deliver frequent updates 
and early software builds to particularly 
enthusiastic Windows users. As long as 
you’re OK with software that may lack 
polish and, more critically, stability, the 
Insider Program is a good place to go to 
get an early look at what Microsoft has 
in store for the Windows platform. To 
Right now, the only way to try the Creators Update, and its new Game Mode feature, is to install a 
Windows Insider Preview Build.

the bottom left of the window. If your 
Windows Insider account is already 
linked to your Win10 profile, you can 
click the Get Started button under the 
Get Insider Preview Builds heading. If 
not, click the Link A Microsoft Account 
button to activate the Preview Builds 
button and click it when you’re finished. 
Beware All Ye Who Enter Here
Before you install a preview build, you’ll 
be faced with a strongly worded warning 
that cautions users that proceeding may 
result in the need to reinstall Windows 
from scratch. You should probably not do 
this using your primary PC, and even if 
something doesn’t crop up that prompts 
a complete reinstall, there will be some 
rough edges, and frequent changes are 
likely occur to the UI of the previewed 
utilities and features. If this warning causes 
you to hesitate, we recommend waiting for 
the official Creators Update. The warning 
screen also has hyperlinks for the Privacy 
Statement and Program Terms should you 
desire more information. If you’re ready 
to install the latest preview build, click 
the Next button and then click Confirm 
to acknowledge that you are aware that 
a reinstall may be required if you want 
to remove a preview build from your 
PC. Restart your PC by clicking the 
appropriate button. 
Fast Or Slow?
If you installed the Anniversary Update, 
you probably don’t remember coming across 
anything in the OS that designates the new 
features as such. So too, Creators Update 
doesn’t appear in your update history; it’s all 
about build versions. You can look up your 
build version number by clicking in the text 
box on the Taskbar and typing winver, then 
pressing ENTER. Before we installed our 
first preview build, our Windows version 
was 1607 (OS Build 14393.693). 
If you’re following along, you need to 
return to the Settings, Update & Security, 
Windows Insider Program screen. 
There will be a drop-down box below 
the Choose Your Insider Level. Use it 
to set select the Fast, Slow, or Release 
Preview Ring, which is how Microsoft’s 
the executable to launch the app, and 
you’ll either get a notification that you 
have the Anniversary Update installed 
or you’ll be prompted to install it via the 
utility. Once that step is complete, click 
Start, Settings, Update & Security, and 
then click Windows Insider Program at 
complete the sign-up process, just sign in 
with your Microsoft account. 
The next step is to make sure you 
have the prerequisite Windows 10 
Anniversary Update installed. To check, 
you can download Microsoft’s Upgrade 
Assistant at bit.ly/2kpErZI. Double-click 
Start by signing up for the Slow Ring, but if that fails to result in the build you’re looking for, install the 
ISO or opt for the Fast Ring.
We signed up for the Fast Ring, which (eventually) let us download and install the Insider Preview 
15025, including the Game Mode feature.

screen, restart the PC, and then check 
for updates until a new build shows up. 
Incidentally, this is what we opted to 
do. If you’re in more of a hurry, you can 
follow the instructions below.
The Impatient Route
If you don’t want to wait for a Game 
Mode preview build to show up, either on 
the Slow or Fast Ring, you can install one 
of a handful of Windows Insider Builds 
manually using the ISOs that Microsoft 
makes available. Before you proceed, 
make sure you have access to your 
Windows 10 product key, as you’ll be 
prompted for it during the installation. If 
you want a quick way of looking up your 
key, check out a utility like the Magical 
Jelly Bean Keyfinder (bit.ly/Yi9BG0), 
which scans your Registry for the product 
key and displays it in handy text form. 
Next, visit bit.ly/2edph9N, sign in with 
your Microsoft Account, and then use 
the Select Edition drop-down menu to 
choose the build you’d like to install. 
When you opt to download the ISO, 
start by selecting an OS Build 15019 or 
higher and your preferred language, then 
click the 32-bit or 64-bit hyperlink that 
corresponds to your current installation 
and wait for the 4GB download to 
complete. The next step involves 
mounting the ISO file to perform an in-
place upgrade. Navigate to the ISO file 
using File Explorer, right-click it, click 
Properties, and then click the Change 
button adjacent to the Opens With 
command. Select Windows Explorer, 
click Apply, and then click OK. Now 
just right-click the ISO file, which for us 
Insider Preview build 
was ready to install. 
As we went to 
press, Windows 
Insiders on the 
Slow Ring were 
granted access to OS 
Build 14986.1001. 
Although considered 
a part of the Creators 
Update (this build 
included Microsoft’s 
ne w Paint 3D 
utility), Game Mode 
doesn’t get added to 
the mix until Preview 
Build 15019. Aside 
from running the 
“winver” command 
to determine the 
presence of the new 
feature we’re looking 
for, you can go to the Settings menu and 
look for the Gaming icon. Sure enough, 
when we checked, it wasn’t there. 
So Now What…
Although we weren’t able to get an 
OS Build of the Creators Update with 
Game Mode on the Slow Ring as we 
went to press, things may have changed 
by the time you try it. The Slow Ring 
is definitely the safer option, so we 
recommend trying it first. If OS Build 
15019 or later still isn’t coming through 
on the Slow Ring, then you have two 
options: install it from an ISO or opt 
for the Fast Ring. If you chose the latter, 
choose Fast from the Settings, Update 
& Security, Windows Insider Program 
developer-centered posts refer to the 
different tiers. Selecting the Fast Ring is 
for PC experts only and results in newer 
features sooner, but there’s a greater risk 
that you’ll encounter bugs, inconvenient 
quirks, and (rarely) system-killing issues. 
The Slow Ring provides minimal risk to 
your installation, and the Release Preview 
Ring installs only updates for the current 
branch. This lattermost option is the 
default setting, but if we leave it as is, we 
won’t get the Creators Update anytime 
soon. If possible, go for the Slow Ring. 
The only way to determine if the ring you 
chose will deliver the Creators Update 
is to try it out and see what Windows 
Update delivers. 
After making your selection, Microsoft 
reports that a background process will 
launch to check your system compatibility 
and register it with the company’s release 
system. It might take as many as 24 hours 
for the updates for your selected ring to 
arrive. On the Update & Security screen, 
click Windows Update, and then click 
Check For Updates, let them install, and 
restart your computer when prompted. 
After an update, we were running OS 
Build 14393.726, which was still not a 
preview build. As it turned out, we had to 
wait a day to get a prompt that a Windows 
Typing winver into the Taskbar search box and pressing ENTER lets you 
see the Windows 10 build version you currently have installed. 
If you’re installing from an ISO and don’t have your Windows Registration Key handy, try looking it up 
using the Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder.

the menu on the left side of the screen. 
We also checked the Get Game Mode 
Notifications checkbox. The OS Build 
we were testing had a known issue where 
Game Mode was enabled by default, 
but the slider showed that it was in the 
Off state. Switching it to On kept the 
setting enabled, but the slider’s status 
was accurate. Also make sure that the 
Game Bar toggle in the Gaming menu 
is set to On. To enable Game Mode on 
a per-game basis, you’ll need to press the 
Windows key + G shortcut while the 
game is running, click the Settings icon, 
and then click the checkbox that enables 
Game Mode for the game. Although not 
specifically directed to do so, we restarted 
each game after enabling or disabling 
Game Mode. 
Our test system consists of a 10-core, 
20-thread Intel Core i7-6950X installed 
in a GIGABYTE GA-X99-Ultra Gaming 
motherboard with 16GB HyperX 
Predator DDR4-3000. We installed a 
lightly overclocked GIGABYTE GeForce 
GTX 1060 G1 Gaming. We wanted 
to make sure to hammer the graphics 
card as much as possible while still 
the Not Right Now button and click 
Next. Input your product key and follow 
the on-screen prompts to continue.
Showtime For Game Mode
Finally, after much fiddling, we 
managed to get our hands on OS Build 
15025. To toggle Game Mode, press the 
Windows key, click the Settings icon, 
Gaming, and then Game Mode from 
was named Windows10_InsiderPreview_
Client_x64_en-us_15025.iso, and 
click Mount. To begin the installation, 
double-click the ISO file to open the 
contents in File Explorer, double-click 
Setup.exe, and then dismiss the UAC 
prompt by clicking Yes. If your machine 
is connected to the internet, leave the 
Download And Install Updates radio 
button selected and click Next, or click 
Access the new Game Mode feature by clicking Start, Settings, Gaming, then Game Mode. 
Upon our first restart after successfully installing the Insider Preview, we got a Windows 10 Creators 
Update welcome message.

That’s It?
As you can see, our results are more 
than a little underwhelming. Although 
there are some games that look like they 
benefitted, there are others that look like 
they suffer to the same degree. Game 
Mode failed to affect scores by more than 
a single frame or two, and as a result, 
we’re not confident that the feature is 
having an impact. 
We knew that Game Mode was going 
to be wet behind the ears when we 
started, so we fully expect Microsoft to 
the charts, we wanted to look at both 
average frame rates and the minimum 
frame rates, because these are the two 
areas where Game Mode is purported 
to have an impact. Additionally, because 
Game Mode’s in-game toggle switch is 
accessed through the Game Bar, you 
won’t be able to turn the feature on in 
any game that doesn’t let you open the 
Game Bar. Most of the games we tried 
let us access the Game Bar, those that 
didn’t would once switched to Borderless 
or Windowed mode. 
maintaining playable frame rates, so we 
tested everything at 2,560 x 1,440. Our 
storage subsystem consists of a 240GB 
OCZ Vertex 3 MAX IOPS SSD for the 
OS and a 1TB WD Black HDD. We’re 
running the 64-bit edition of Windows 
10 Enterprise.
It’s pointless to use synthetic 
benchmarks to show the advantages 
of Game Mode, so we kept our testing 
focus on modern games that you’d be 
most likely to be playing as we went 
to press. Many of these games have a 
DirectX 12 running mode, but as we 
proved last month, AMD and NVIDIA 
cards don’t benefit equally under DX12, 
so in every instance where we had the 
option, we selected DX11. The games 
we ran included HITMAN, Rise Of 
The Tomb Raider, Deus Ex: Mankind 
Divided, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, 
Dying Light (Windowed), and 
Middle-earth: Shadow Of Mordor. 
Although these are the games we 
recorded scores for, we also tested the 
feature with a handful of other games, 
including ASTRONEER, Ashes Of 
The Singularity, Forza Horizon 3, Halo 
5: Forge, Sniper Elite 4, and Metro: 
Last Light. 
For our testing, we recorded frame 
rates from several runs and averaged the 
three closest sets of scores. Those are the 
numbers that appear in the charts. In

if nothing else, serves as an indictment 
against using Intel’s $1,650 processor (or 
any enthusiast-grade processor for that 
matter) solely for gaming. 
Lingering Questions
There are a couple of things we 
noticed while testing games with 
Game Mode. First, you can technically 
enable Game Mode for an app that is 
not a game, in the same way that you 
open the Game Bar by pressing the 
Windows key + G shortcut and using 
the checkbox to designate the app as 
a game. Could Game Mode be used 
to give any application a performance 
boost? Another question we have about 
Game Mode is whether the Game Bar 
needs to be accessible for the feature 
to work. In some instances, including 
Dying Light, we were able to force the 
full-screen game to run in a window 
using the ALT + ENTER shortcut, but 
back in full screen, we had no way of 
knowing if Game Mode was active. As 
we mentioned above, we checked the 
Get Game Mode Notifications checkbox 
from the Settings, Gaming, Game 
Mode menu, but we never once saw the 
notification pop up. 
Another problem with our testing 
could have been the fact that we weren’t 
running any additional applications 
while we performed the benchmarking. 
But if Game Mode only makes its 
presence felt when there’s a bunch of 
stuff running concurrently with the 
game, then we’d argue that most 
enthusiasts and experienced PC gamers 
already put their PCs into a DIY game 
mode every time they play. As a rule, 
we also tend to steer clear of utilities 
that chronically consume more than 
their fair share of system resources, so 
it’s possible that Microsoft’s Game Mode 
didn’t have a whole lot of headroom to 
recover wasted CPU cycles for us. We’re 
not ready to close the book on Win10’s 
Game Mode just yet, and in the coming 
weeks and months, rest assured we’ll 
be keeping a close eye on the feature 
and any performance gains it might be 
capable of delivering. ■
even disabled hyperthreading and Turbo 
Boost, and we down-clocked our Core 
i7-6950X to 2GHz, hoping it would 
become a bottleneck and force Game 
Mode to do something about it. Alas, it 
didn’t affect performance at all. Which, 
make improvements and tweaks between 
now and when the Creators Update 
arrives for everyone. But there’s also a 
chance that our system, or high-end 
systems in particular, just won’t benefit 
much. Using this as a working theory, we

and minimum frame rates, but not by much.

Cord-Cutting In 2017
Have “Cord-Nevers” Become Pay TV’s Biggest Worry?
satellite reception; 17% reportedly only 
rely on broadcast reception (think OTA 
antennas), up from 15% in 2015, while 
6% only rely on internet-based services 
(think Netflix or Hulu), up from 4% 
in 2015. eMarketer recently predicted 
that one in five U.S. adults won’t watch 
traditional pay television programming 
this year. The research group predicts 
households subscribing to cable, satellite, 
or telco TV packages will dip 0.7% this 
year to reach 98.7 million. By 2020, the 
total is predicted to fall to 95 million. 
“This year, 1.7 million U.S. adults will cut 
the cable/satellite cord, as many of them 
both sides, time might be more important 
than money,” Newman says. 
In addition to offering differing 
perspectives on cord-cutting, the following 
details other factors impacting the pay 
TV industry, including “cord-nevers” and 
“cord-shavers,” two types of users some 
experts believe pose bigger challenges to 
the pay TV industry than cord-cutters. 
What The Numbers Say 
Seemingly everyone agrees that cord-
cutting is increasing. A recent report 
from GfK stated that about one-quarter 
of U.S. households now lack cable or 
E
ver since cord-cutting started to 
gain traction with users years ago, 
mainstream coverage, research, data, and 
debate have steadily flowed forth, posing 
issues such as how prevalent cord-cutting 
really is, what impact it’s having on cable 
TV companies and television networks, 
and what the industry should do to react. 
What sometimes gets overlooked is that 
cord-cutting is an actual process, and 
people want advice and guidance from 
those who’ve already done it. 
The following provides such advice—
something becoming more important 
simply because there’s never been as many 
streaming apps, services, and devices 
available to would-be cord-cutters, not to 
mention OTA (over-the-air) antennas to 
acquire free local HD broadcasts. Although 
users have historically viewed cutting the 
cord with their cable companies as a way 
to save money, these newer options and 
upcoming ones are leaving some to view 
cord-cutting as a path to better satisfy their 
changing viewing habits.
Despite this, Jared Newman, a “die-hard” 
cord-cutter who writes a “Cord-Cutter 
Confidential” column at TechHive.com, 
says cord-cutting is still something 
for some but not others. “I’m at a point 
where I wouldn’t return to cable even if 
it was less expensive because I don’t want 
to deal with the baggage,” he says. That 
includes snaking cables around his house, 
constantly switching between a “clunky 
cable box” and “slick streaming devices,” 
and “haggling with my cable company for 
a lower bill every year.” Inertia, though, “is 
a powerful force upon cable subscribers,” 
Newman says, in the sense “the more 
stipulations you have about cable, the 
more work it takes to come up with a 
suitable replacement.” Additionally, “there’s 
something to be said for just leaving well 
enough alone, even if it costs more. On 
Many experts suggest that while the number of cord-cutters has been increasing for several years, it’s 
still not for everyone. Several websites offer guides to help users determine if cord-cutting is for them, 
including Jared Newman’s “Cord-Cutter Confidential” column at TechHive.com.

the opposite? Rayburn says because 
headlines like “Cable TV Is Dying” 
attract attention. “You’ll notice 99% of 
the market to where it’s going to transform 
or drastically change the paid TV market,” 
he says. So, why do some articles suggest 
opt for on-demand OTT [over the top] 
services instead,” eMarketer states. 
Combine such data with more 
streaming options, new OTA antennas 
that incorporate DVR abilities and easier 
accessibility to local broadcast stations, new 
entertainment-focused business models, 
and other developments, and some experts 
are predicting a dramatic transformation 
for the pay TV space this year. Others 
aren’t as certain. “Is streaming increasing? 
Definitely,” says David Tice, GfK senior 
vice president of media and entertainment. 
“Is cord-cutting increasing? Yes, slowly. But 
the changes aren’t as drastic as some people 
suggest. Not all homes are going to drop 
pay TV for streaming or skinny bundles.” 
Audience data, he says, shows viewers still 
devote a “vast majority of viewing time” to 
traditional TV programs. “It’s definitely an 
industry challenge, but I think we’ll see the 
market stabilize in the near future,” he says. 
Similarly, Jan Dawson, Jackdaw 
Research chief analyst, says cord-cutting 
is undoubtedly accelerating and “big pay 
TV operators are collectively losing more 
subscribers than ever,” but cord-cutters are 
still a “small minority” compared to paid 
TV subscribers. Rather than instigating a 
dramatic transformation this year, Dawson 
sees cord-cutting as a “snowball rolling 
down a hill and getting bigger all the 
time.” Every year will bring more viable 
alternatives to traditional pay TV, he says, 
meaning “more people cutting the cord and 
more financial pressure” on traditional TV 
players to offer more compelling options to 
subscribers. This year, for example, Dawson 
says new streaming services expected from 
YouTube, Hulu, and potentially Amazon 
and Apple could accelerate cord-cutting 
because of the brand awareness and 
audiences those companies have.  
Dan Rayburn, Frost & Sullivan 
principal analyst and StreamingMedia.com 
executive vice president, also says cord-
cutters represent a “very small fraction” 
of the overall market, and he doesn’t 
believe this year will differ any from 2016, 
even with newer services such as AT&T’s 
DirecTV Now and Hulu’s expected live 
service coming to market. “It’s just not 
going to impact enough of a portion of 
What’s On & How To Find It 
One complaint among some cord-cutters who turn to watching free OTA (over-the-air) broadcasts 
via antenna and programming via OTT (over-the-top) services like Netflix and Hulu is that it’s not 
always easy or intuitive to see what’s on and available. Numerous apps, websites, and other tools 
are available to help. TitanTV, for example, provides a free programming guide online and via 
mobile apps to view local broadcast lineups. 
Other apps and websites enable searching multiple streaming services to access on-demand 
programming. Leanflix, flixfindr, InstantWatcher, and JustWatch are examples. JustWatch, for 
example, provides iOS and Android apps to use various filters (movies, TV shows, release year, 
genres, price, etc.) to search across Netflix, Hulu, Crackle, Tubi TV, HBO Now, and others. Further, 
a WatchList feature enables saving selections and provides rental and buying options. 
Considering Netflix’s popularity, it’s not surprising there are scads of tools specific to that service 
to search its millions of titles. Flix Roulette is a more unique example, providing filters (director or 
actor’s name, rating, keywords, etc.) and a Spin button to try your luck at finding Netflix content. 
Also noteworthy is the intuitive yet filter-rich FlickSurfer and What’s On Netflix, which helps uncover 
highly rated content based on data from Metacritic, IMDB, and Rotten Tomatoes. 
What’s On Netflix also houses the “largest and most comprehensive list” of Netflix categories 
(3,500-plus) to search among. By using a specific URL (www.netflix.com/browse/genre/NUMBER) 
and “hidden” codes that What’s On Netflix provides, a user can enter, say, the code 1155 in place 
of “NUMBER” in the URL to see titles under a Campy Horror Movies category. An extension for the 
Chrome browser called Netflix Categories puts several hundred in one convenient place, complete 
with the ability to bookmark favorite categories. Another Chrome extension worth considering is 
Netflix Enhancer, which enables hovering over a title in Netflix to display a pop-up that includes 
ratings, the option to watch a trailer (if available), and more. 
JustWatch is an example of the many apps, websites, and other tools available to make it 
easier to see what’s available to watch through various streaming services. JustWatch provides 
numerous filters and icons for streaming services to help narrow searches.

for the paid TV industry because they’re 
typically younger and see no reason to 
subscribe to paid television. “What paid 
TV is providing doesn’t relate to what 
they consider an entertainment choice,” 
he says. “The idea of linear television and 
traditional television is just not of interest.” 
This contrasts with cord-shavers and cord-
cutters, who at one 
time did see value in 
paid television.  
Broadly, Dawson 
s a y s  c a b l e  T V 
providers really want 
millennials and cord-
nevers as customers. 
Thus, some cable 
c o m p a n i e s  a i m 
special offerings at 
them, while “some 
of the OTT services 
we’re seeing from 
pay TV companies 
like DirecTV Now 
and Sling TV from 
Dish are ways they’re 
looking to tap in to 
this audience,” he says. 
“They know they’re 
mostly not likely to buy $100 per month 
pay TV services, at least for now, so they’re 
trying to find other ways to reach them and 
generate at least some revenue from them.” 
Tice says cord-nevers provide a 
potential glimpse into the future. “The 
real interest will come if these young 
adults stay cordless as their incomes 
increase and they start families,” he says. 
“If millennials don’t want traditional 
cords as they become more affluent and 
have families, then pay TV companies 
need to come up with alternative business 
plans. This is why you see companies like 
Dish offer standalone streaming ‘cable’ 
services or see AT&T buy Time Warner—
they can’t just be pipes anymore.” 
For now, Toni Fitzgerald, managing 
editor of Media Life Magazine, believes 
cord-shaving will have the greatest impact 
on the pay TV industry (“you can already 
see it in the roll-out of skinny bundles”), 
but it’s hard to say what the case will be 
moving forward. “My school-aged kids 
Fortune.com recently cited a report from 
PwC that found that households that 
cut the cord or have never subscribed 
reached 23% in 2016, up from 21% in 
2015. Cord-shaving households that kept 
cable but reduced channels and costs 
climbed to 23% from 18%. “We saw 
more audiences customizing their pay TV 
bundles through trimming, even as they 
consume more content than ever before,” 
PwC stated. “Their demands got louder 
in terms of what kind of content they pay 
for and how and when they access it.”
“The affordability of paid TV is a big 
issue. However, before, there really wasn’t 
an alternative that consumers could 
compare paid TV to. Now there is,” says 
Colin Dixon, analyst and founder of 
nScreenMedia. “Increasingly, consumers 
are citing the fact that SVOD [subscription 
video on demand] services like Netflix 
provide a realistic alternative to paid 
television. In the past, that has not been 
the case.”  Effectively, he says, consumers 
are increasingly indicating traditional pay 
TV is too expensive and there are lower-
cost alternatives to heavily rely on. “And 
that’s exactly what people are doing. I 
think that’s the biggest difference between 
now and, say, six years ago,” Dixon says. 
Like others, Dixon believes cord-nevers 
pose the greatest long-term difficulty 
the time when we read articles like that, 
they never talk numbers,” he says. 
“The other thing is that it’s almost kind 
of fashionable to say you hate your cable 
TV provider. Like, if you say you actually 
don’t mind paying $120 a month for 
phone, internet, and cable, people think 
you’re crazy.”
One big red flag 
the pay TV industry 
is facing is a decline 
in consumption 
of linear content, 
including sports, 
especially among 
younger viewers, 
Dawson says. “People 
are abandoning 
traditional TV at 
an alarming rate, 
but that hasn’t yet 
t r a n s l a t e d  i n t o 
abandonment of 
pay TV providers in 
the same numbers,” 
he says. “For now, 
it’s just about lower 
usage, but at some 
point that will cause 
those people to question whether it’s 
still worth paying for a big bundle TV 
service, and then we could reach a kind of 
tipping point.” 
The Case Of Cord-Nevers
Younger viewers currently are the center 
of great attention in this space. A GfK 
survey of 25,000 U.S. consumers found 
that millennials (18 to 34 years old) make 
up 43% of the “cordless” population, or 
those who have cut the cord or have never 
had a cable, satellite, or fiber-optic TV 
subscription. GfK says nearly one-third of 
all U.S. millennials are cordless vs. 16% 
of all Baby Boomers. Cordless millennials 
spend 65% of their viewing time streaming 
video via a TV set or other device. 
Those users who’ve never had a cable 
subscription are known as “cord-nevers.” 
Users who have moved to “skinny 
bundles”—less-expensive cable bundles 
with fewer channels or standalone OTT 
services—are known as “cord-shavers.” 
Cord-cutting experts tout so-called “skinny bundles,” such as Sling TV and DirecTV Now, as a viable 
way to obtain specific content, such as NFL football action, while that content is in season and then 
cancel the subscription when the season is over.

and an antenna drive most of his TV 
viewing. “But the hardware has become 
more sophisticated with devices like 
Apple TV and NVIDIA Shield TV, and 
there are lots of new apps like PBS Kids, 
Pluto TV, and Crackle that help round 
out the streaming experience,” he says. 
Newman also uses Plex DVR to record 
OTA broadcasts. “It’s been so long since 
cross-country and beginning his career. 
Thus, he configured an internet-only TV 
plan. “Netflix was just starting to stream 
video onto TV devices like the Xbox 360, 
and Hulu was putting a lot of new TV 
shows online. Between those options and an 
antenna, we got by,” he says. 
Newman’s configuration hasn’t change 
much since. Netflix, Amazon Prime, 
are cord-nevers,” Fitzgerald says. “In two 
decades, I’d imagine most young people 
will be, as well.” 
The Art Of Cord-Cutting
When Newman cut the cord years ago, 
his motivation was identical to that of many 
other cord-cutters: He was looking to save 
money, specifically after having just moved 
Straight From A Cord-Cutter’s Mouth 
Three years ago, Luke Bouma started CordCuttersNews.com to provide 
news, how-to advice, reviews, and other information concerning cord-
cutting. Like many cord-cutters, Bouma ended his cable TV subscription 
initially to save money. Today, he says, cord-cutting decisions have as 
much to do with changes in people’s viewing habits. We talked with 
Bouma about the cord-cutting lifestyle.
Q: Do you ever regret cutting the cord?
LB: You know, no. It’s always funny when I go to a hotel because I travel 
a lot for business with the site now. I’m always like, “Man, I don’t regret 
that.” My daughter, who is four, has never known anything other than 
cord-cutting, and she cannot grasp this concept of not being able to 
watch the episode or show she wants to watch when we go to hotels. 
So, no. It definitely took a couple of months to find everything we wanted, 
to build our ecosystem of services, but once we put it all together, it was 
downhill from there. 
Q: What motivated you to start the website? 
LB: Three years ago, the coverage of cord-cutting was “it’s not real.” I 
got active on Reddit with the r/CordCutters sub-Reddit. I started posting a 
lot, and my stories were on the top, but I kind of didn’t like the tone. They 
were all like, “Yeah, there might be a few kids in their mom’s basement 
wanting to stream some stuff,” but I was like, “No, I see something a little 
different.” So, I created it to give my point of view on cord-cutting. The 
second week, we had almost 62,000 people come to the site in a single 
day. I thought, “We have something here.” After the first year, I quit my 
job, and I’ve been running it full-time since. 
Q: On a daily basis, what do you try to provide?
LB: There’s kind of a two-pronged approach. First, it’s just informing 
people of all things cord-cutting. News, new devices, new services. The 
news aspect of cord-cutting. The other is helping people become cord-
cutters and helping them get the most out of the cord-cutting experience 
through guides, how-tos, reviews. That may be the secondary focus, but 
we get about 1 million people coming to the site every month looking for 
guides and reviews and “how can I become a cord-cutter?” 
Q: Are there certain traits you find cord-cutters share in common? 
LB: There really isn’t one big basket. I have people in their 80s who are 
cord-cutters and people coming to the site who are 18. Age-wise and 
demographics, it’s all over the place. I have seen a huge trend in the last 
year of more women being the lead in cord-cutting. My take is that a lot 
of women pay the bills and see how much they’re spending. They may 
be the ones saying, “You know, do we really need to be paying $250 for 
cable?” That’s been a big trend, but it’s literally everyone. We did a survey 
of about 1,300 people, and over half were 45 or older. The other half was 
30s and 20s. That goes against the grain of a lot of what you hear about, 
“Oh, it’s a lot of millennials.” 
In addition to advice on cutting the cord, Luke Bouma’s 
CordCuttersNews.com website provides numerous how-to articles that 
help cord-cutters navigate various situations, such as how to watch 
sports action without a cable TV subscription. 
72 March2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

Most advice to cord-cutters includes 
buying an OTA antenna to pick up 
free local HD broadcast channels and 
checking which local channels you 
can expect to pull in with the antenna 
in your region. NoCable.org states that 
90% of the U.S. population is within 
range to stream free OTA HD television. 
AntennaWeb.org, TVFool.com, and 
Antennarecommendations.com all 
provide channel information, as well as 
buying advice for antennas and general 
cord-cutting recommendations. 
For whole-home OTA viewing 
and DVR capabilities, Newman 
suggests looking at more sophisticated 
options such as the Tablo DVR and 
HDHomeRun. Other options include the 
upcoming Tablo Live, which promises to 
stream OTA HD channels via Wi-Fi to 
streaming boxes, smart TVs, and mobile 
devices in the home. The upcoming 
but without losing all their favorite channels 
and DVR. This poses more challenges and 
research, including probably comparing 
Sling TV to PlayStation Vue to DirecTV 
Now to evaluate what channels each offers, 
how the respective DVR services work, and 
if using an OTA antenna can compensate 
for a lack of local live stations. “If you’re new 
to the world of streaming devices like Roku, 
you can easily become overwhelmed,” 
Newman says. “Generally, the more you 
want something like cable, the more work 
you’ll have to do to re-create it.”
Various guides and tools are available 
online to help create cord-cutting setups. 
NoCable.org, for example, offers a Build 
Your Own Home Setup guide that poses 
several questions about the user’s location, 
watching behavior, recording demands, 
internet service, and more. NoCable.org 
also offers a savings calculator to get an 
idea about costs. 
having cable that I don’t feel an urge to 
use skinny bundles like Sling TV and 
PlayStation Vue, but it’s nice having those 
as options,” he says. 
Beyond saving money, Chris Brantner, a 
cord-cutter who runs CutCableToday.com, 
says users also end cable subscriptions to 
gain flexibility. “With cord cutting, you 
can try out a ton of different streaming 
services but never be locked into a 
contract,” he says. “That allows your setup 
to be fluid, which is important in this 
seasonal world of television we live in.” 
Someone who only needs ESPN during 
football season, for example, might 
subscribe to Sling TV for those months 
and then cancel. Some users who consider 
cord-cutting but then stick with cable do 
so because it’s easier, he says. “You pay, 
and they come set it all up for you. It’s 
a set-it-and-forget-it sort of thing,” he 
says. Conversely, cord-cutting requires 
connecting an antenna and streaming 
device, deciding on services to acquire, 
and then likely balancing multiple 
subscriptions. “It’s daunting for those not 
tech-savvy,” Brantner says. 
Elsewhere, some cord-cutters who 
subscribe to multiple services may 
find the cost savings they’d hoped for 
don’t really materialize. Further, even 
subscribing to several streaming services 
might leave some content unavailable 
without a cable or satellite subscription. 
That’s why planning and preparation 
are imperative to obtaining a satisfying 
cord-cutting experience. Brantner advises 
starting with must-haves. “What shows 
do you have to have access to? What 
channels do you need? What are you 
willing to live without? Once you have 
those in mind, you can build your cord-
cutting package around it,” he says. 
Similarly, Newman says setups can 
depend on a user’s mindset. Some users 
simply realize they’re overpaying for cable 
because most of their TV-viewing time 
involves Netflix and Hulu. Someone who 
already uses a streaming device, such as a 
Roku model, and who doesn’t mind some 
sacrifices can “save a lot of money without 
thinking too hard,” Newman says. Other 
users will want to know how to ditch cable 
The Triple Cord-Cutting Threat
For many people, “cord cutting” signifies ending a cable TV subscription, but the term can also 
refer to doing away with a landline phone. Now, Ovum Research states we’re entering a new 
realm of cord-cutting in which more people are discontinuing their home broadband internet 
connections and are instead only using mobile devices for connectivity needs. “This is the reason 
why U.S. service providers are diversifying their business away from their core services toward 
the path of becoming digital service providers,” states Kristin Paulin, Ovum senior analyst. Ovum 
believes this is also why mergers and acquisitions will likely continue. One example is AT&T’s 
proposed acquisition of Time Warner and the considerable video content and distribution assets 
that AT&T would gain. 
Ovum’s research, which covers the third quarter of last year, indicates telcos are particularly 
feeling the impact of this “triple” cord-cutting effect. AT&T and Windstream, for example, both 
experienced customer losses in their landline, cable TV, and broadband services, states Ovum, 
which also reports CenturyLink and Consolidated Communications are in risky positions due 
to declines in two of three areas. Verizon is in an “at-risk category” following declines in fixed 
broadband numbers in 2Q15 and 1Q16 and showing “very low” pay TV subscriber growth. “Most 
U.S. telcos have been losing fixed-voice subscribers for years but are now confronted with 
subscriber losses in either pay TV or fixed broadband, or both,” Ovum states. 
October-released data from Pew Research shows 13% of U.S. adults only used smartphones 
to connect to the internet in 2015 vs. 8% in 2013. Whereas 70% of U.S. adults had in-home 
broadband in 2013, the percentage was 67% in 2015. Saving money and increased smartphone 
capabilities were cited as leading reasons for the change. Of non-broadband users who own a 
smartphone, 59% reportedly cited broadband subscriptions as too expensive, and 65% indicated 
a smartphone does everything they need to do online. Also noteworthy, 59% of non-broadband 
smartphone owners reported having other options for internet access outside the home. 
CPU  /  March2017 73

Currently, Dawson says everything is 
“flawed in one way or another, mostly 
because it’s only a partial solution 
for cord-cutting. Everyone is missing 
channels, content, device support, and 
other elements that would make the 
services really compelling as replacements 
for traditional pay TV.” Watching all the 
sports a user might desire, for example, 
might be really tough without subscribing 
to several different packages and probably 
still using an antenna for OTA broadcasts, 
he says.
What’s To Come 
In the near future, absent of any 
market distortion activity—if the 
FCC, for example, stopped enforcing 
net neutrality and internet providers 
lowered broadband caps dramatically—
Dixon believes “we’re headed for big 
growth in cord-cutting and cord-nevers,” 
particularly if consumers decide that 
streaming options are good substitutes 
for traditional TV. “You could see a much 
bigger number of people than just the 
typical 1% trickle away from paid TV 
over the next several years,” he says. “You 
could see as much as 10 or 15% say, 
‘No, this is good enough for me’ and 
jump to one of those services and drop 
traditional pay television. I think the way 
things are coming together will have a 
quite large segment of the population 
realize that they can really live without 
pay television.”
For now, cord-cutters are still a 
small segment, but one that is growing 
steadily, Fitzgerald says. “More than 
that, though, there are a lot of people 
who say in surveys that they are 
considering cutting the cord, which 
I think is what’s set off the fear,” 
Fitzgerald says. “So far, you’re only 
talking a few million people snipping 
the cord, but if you believe the surveys, 
it could be a lot more.” That’s if people 
follow through. “It’s one thing to tell 
a survey taker you’re fed up with your 
cable bill and quite another to follow 
through with the hassle of canceling 
service and finding a new source of TV 
entertainment,” he says. ■
one or two “premium” streaming services 
such as Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime 
as a foundation before rounding out 
what you need. “Treat yourself to a nice 
streaming box for your main TV—a Roku 
Premiere+, Amazon Fire TV box, Apple 
TV, or NVIDIA Shield TV—and leave the 
cheaper streaming sticks for the TVs you 
don’t use as often,” he says. Connectivity-
wise, plan for a bare minimum of 10Mbps 
or more if multiple people will be 
streaming simultaneously, Newman says. 
Mohu AirWave, meanwhile, will deliver 
live OTA stations to an app on a user’s 
streaming device, meaning he won’t need 
to change a TV’s input settings to watch 
live broadcasts. Elsewhere, upcoming 
Tablo Droid DVR software will enable 
owners of Android streaming devices, 
including the NVIDIA Shield Android 
TV, to record OTA broadcasts.
Overall, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all 
approach to creating a cord-cutting 
setup. Thus, Newman suggests picking 
Streaming devices like the Roku Premiere are a primary staple of a cord-cutter’s setup, particularly when 
combined with an OTA antenna and major streaming service like Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime Video. 
Along with the upcoming Tablo Live and other new releases aimed at cord-cutters, Mohu’s wireless 
over-the-air and over-the-top AirWave device have been cited by some as having the potential to bring 
about a dramatic transformation of the pay TV industry this year.

Messin’ With Sasquatch
BY CHRIS TRUMBLE
$59.99 (PC, XOne)   •   ESRB: (T)een
Microsoft Studios   •   www.halowaypoint.com
When the first Halo Wars launched for Xbox 360 back in 2009, it was a 
considerable step forward for RTS games played on consoles. Although 
it simplified certain aspects of base building and unit selection a little too 
much for some, it gave console gamers a really solid RTS experience 
and, of course, another chance to step back into the Halo universe. Now 
developers Creative Assembly and 343 Industries have unleashed that 
game’s sequel, both on Xbox One and on Windows 10 PCs, and I’m happy 
to report that the game lives up to most if not all expectations.
If you recall, at the end of Halo Wars, the UNSC Spirit of Fire was left in 
the far reaches of space without a functional slipspace drive, effectively 
marooning her crew, which retreated to cryo-sleep in the hopes that they’d 
one day be rescued. As Halo Wars 2 opens, the shipboard AI, Serena, wakes 
Captain Cutter and informs him that “something has happened.” 
As it turns out, quite a lot has happened. The Spirit of Fire was declared lost with 
all hands by the UNSC, humanity’s war with the Covenant ended, and 28 long 
years passed. As Captain Cutter and the crew wake up from their very long nap, 
they discover that Serena terminated herself at the end of her seven-year life 
span to avoid rampancy, as dictated by UNSC protocols. Her message pulling 
Cutter from cryo-sleep is a recorded note that was activated automatically 
when the ship received its first external communication in nearly three decades: 
a UNSC signal originating from Forerunner Installation 00, aka The Ark.
Long story short, the UNSC sent an expedition to The Ark after the war 
with the Covenant, only to have that expedition mostly slaughtered by 
a new threat, an alien army known as The Banished. The Banished are 
a Covenant splinter group led by a ferocious Brute Chieftain named 
Atriox, who was formerly part of a Covenant suicide squad who a) 
refused to die, and b) rebelled against his Covenant handlers and was 
banished. (Hence the name.) Atriox is big and scary and, thanks to 
many raids against his former employers, very well equipped.
The campaign is a series of missions that tell the story of the small UNSC 
force’s battle against Atriox and his army, and although for some the game 
will provide a less compelling connection to the characters and story than 
the Halo FPS games often do, it’s unmistakably part of the Halo mythology 
and is a nice little fix for hardcore fans between Halo 5 and Halo 6. 
The control scheme is improved on Xbox One over that of the first 
game in a couple small but effective ways: the graphics are markedly 
improved (as you’d expect), and Microsoft added several multiplayer 
options, including most notably the new Blitz mode. Blitz is based on a 
new collectible card system; your available units are based on decks 
you create from your collection and play during the game, rather than 
from bases you build. 
Halo Wars 2 is a better game than its predecessor in every way, and 
thanks to Windows compatibility, keyboard and mouse fans will find it 
a lot more approachable, as well. It doesn’t contain the complexity and 
moves-per-second rush that more mature PC RTS franchises do, but 
it’s a lot of fun, and you can play on both platforms for one price. ■
Yeah, we know you have blogs to post, video to encode, reports to write, and code to compile. We do, 
too, but you have to take a break once in a while (and maybe blow some stuff up). That’s why each 
month we give you the lowdown on what to expect from the latest interesting games.

your audience to people with high-end PCs who have gone on to pay 
up to $800 for an HMD. Whether willingly or not, Arizona Sunshine has 
become the de-facto poster child for full-length VR games.
At first glance, Arizona Sunshine feels like a game that was inspired by 
on-rails shooters with plastic guns straight out of ’90s-era arcades. The 
setting is a series of locations in the desert Southwest. There’s been a 
zombie outbreak, and the “Freds,” as the player character refers to them, 
are everywhere. The game consists of fairly open arenas overrun with 
zombies, but you’ll often need to find a key (or a lever, key card, winch, or 
other puzzle-solving item), then fend off wave after wave of the undead 
at the end of the level to proceed. We played the game using the Oculus 
Rift and Touch controllers, which double as guns that we could swap with 
other weapons we’d collected and holstered at our waist. Pressing the A
button ejects an empty mag, and you can reload by bringing the gun to 
your belt. It’s not the same as pointing away from the screen and pulling 
the trigger to reload like at the arcade, but it’s close. 
Although the weapon-handling mechanics are the key to surviving in 
Arizona Sunshine, that’s not the first thing you’ll struggle with when 
starting out. Traversal, the simple act of getting around in Arizona 
Sunshine, is a point of contention that highlights one of VR’s biggest 
unsolved problems. That problem is, if you try to move around in a 
first-person capacity by pressing forward on a joystick (like you do in 
every other non-VR game), a vast majority of players will vomit. It’s the 
reason some Oculus games come with the “Intense” comfort rating, 
and it’s a smoking gun for VR naysayers. Oculus, HTC, Valve, and Sony 
are basically saying that your fabulously expensive game system is 
likely to make you blow chunks if you attempt to play games like we 
currently play them on our 2D monitors and TVs.  
But the developers of Arizona Sunshine knew this going in, which is 
why they made the default mode of transportation one that effectively 
lets you teleport yourself around by pressing forward on the left 
joystick and letting go. It’s fast and effective, and we were able to play 
for hours on end without the slightest hint of motion sickness. But 
being a posterchild, Jaywalkers Interactive succumbed to the outcry 
and added a “walking” means of locomotion following the game’s 
release. Although it’s more immersive than teleporting, it’s a hork fest 
after just a few minutes. 
Is teleporting in Arizona Sunshine, or any VR first-person shooter for 
that matter, a deal breaker? For us, the answer is a firm “no.” The 
experience we were left with in our time with this game, even in the 
face of a sometimes clunky interface, calibration issues that often 
prevented us from picking up things off the ground, cheesy voice 
acting, and some punishing difficulty spikes, was one that simply 
cannot be compared to any other 2D gaming experience we’ve had. 
Arizona Sunshine is a flawed game, on a fledgling VR platform with 
even more flaws, but all of those criticisms dissipate like a red mist the 
first time you pop a Fred at close range and involuntarily flinch. There 
is a lot of room for improvement, but given how much fun we had with 
Arizona Sunshine, we’re more excited than ever to see what’s next. ■

Barbarians Without Borders
BY VINCE COGLEY
$29.99 (PC; Early Access)   •   ESRB: (R)ating Pending
Funcom   • conanexiles.com
The fantasy genre has no shortage of memorable 
characters. You know them by heart—Harry 
Potter, Tyrion Lannister, Gandalf, and on and on.
Don’t sleep on Conan. Most famously a 
barbarian, Conan has worn a lot of helmets 
(as it were) over the years, including usurper, 
wanderer, and freebooter. He’s been adventuring 
in one form or another for 85 years, so after 
nearly a century, Conan’s world is extensive. 
If you’re dreaming up an open-world survival 
game that is brutal to the core, you can’t beat 
Conan. You’d also be out of luck, because 
Norwegian developer Funcom beat you to the 
punch. Launched into early access at the end of 
January, Conan Exiles puts players in Conan’s backyard with little more 
than a loincloth—or, if you prefer, even less. (Let it be said that although 
the game doesn’t yet have an ESRB rating as an early access title, it will 
most certainly earn a big, fat, boldface, possibly highlighted, capital “M.”)
Conan Exiles presents players with lots of ways to customize their 
character while remaining faithful to the lore. You can choose from 
a number of in-universe races and pledge yourself to one of the 
world’s handful of deities. Once you’ve created your character to your 
satisfaction, you’re dropped into the Exiled Lands and must use your 
wit, savagery, and bare hands to avoid becoming a beast’s dinner or an 
opposing player’s target dummy.
Funcom seems to have a solid grasp on the fundamentals of a good 
open-world survival game. You can collect all the basics necessary for 
a rudimentary shelter in less than an hour, but the time and resources 
required to build anything substantial really ramp up from there. So far, 
the balance between time invested and earned rewards feels about right. 
To access all of Conan Exiles’ end-game goodies, you’ll need a lot of 
work or a lot of friends—possibly both.
Comparisons to ARK: Survival Evolved, primarily, are inevitable, but Conan 
Exiles distinguishes itself with a pair of excellent mechanics, the thrall 
system and avatars. By capturing NPCs and dragging them back to your 
headquarters, you can break them on a Wheel of Pain (hey, we told you 
this is not a warm, snuggly environment) and have them do your bidding, 
helping you craft items or defend your base, for example. If you’ve 
aligned yourself with Yog, Set, or Mitra (three of Conan Exiles’ gods), 
building a big enough shrine and performing enough rituals eventually 
lets you summon the corresponding deity and wreak havoc on the land. 
In Conan Exiles, it really feels like you’re building an empire, which I 
imagine will be an incredible experience with a group of like-minded 
barbaric buddies.
Speaking of timesinks, Funcom has plenty of work ahead of itself. For 
starters, combat feels a little clunky. And of course, as an early access 
title, Conan Exiles has its share of bugs, ranging from annoying to game-
breaking. Thankfully, Funcom has been responsive in rolling out hotfixes 
and patches, so we’re hopeful the game won’t slip into development hell. 
Without giving in to the hype (320,000 sales over the course of its first 
week), Conan has the potential to be the killer app that the open-world 
survival genre has been waiting for. At the very least, it really feels like 
Funcom has the right vision for Conan Exiles. We’re looking forward to 
watching the game, and its player base, grow. ■

Boom, Headshot!
BY ANDREW LEIBMAN
$59.99 (PC, XOne, PS4)   •   ESRB: (M)ature  
Rebellion Developments   •   www.sniperelite4.com
For a while now, many historical shooters have been shying away from 
World War II, an era that games had done to death by 2006. But for the 
Sniper Elite series, the second world war is a part of its DNA as much 
as its third-person open-world gameplay. 
Unlike most WWII shooters you’ve probably played, however, the third-
person Sniper Elite Series is the slow, deliberate one that demands 
patience and careful planning. Games in the Call Of Duty franchise use 
scripted set pieces to punctuate dramatic moments, but as of Sniper 
Elite V2, this series’ spectacle comes in the form of the slow-motion 
X-ray Kill Cam shots. When you pull off an impressive or particularly 
skillful kill, the camera follows the bullet as it leaves the gun’s barrel 
and travels toward the target, where you’re treated to an X-ray view 
of the slug puncturing the skull, splintering bones, and annihilating 
organs. It’s a bit like DOOM’s glory kills, but with Nazis. You can fine-
tune the melee and bullet-kill cameras to none, minimal, reduced, 
normal, increased, and frequently and even enable “quick cameras.” 
If you want to cut a kill-cam short, just press the Spacebar. Rebellion 
gives you plenty of opportunities to avoid the cameras if you want, but 
honestly, it’s a big part of the allure of the game, so why would you?
It’s important to take your time and strategize with Sniper Elite 4; your 
foes can hear gunfire and explosions and will go on high alert when 
they’re suspicious. Using your binoculars, you can tag enemies; points 
of interest; and explosive barrels, ammo boxes, and vulnerable parts of 
enemy vehicles (they’re red of course) to make it easier to track patrols 
(even behind walls), take advantage of environmental traps, and plan 
your route of attack. Whenever you fire an unsuppressed weapon, nearby 
enemies who hear will have a rough idea of where the shot came from. 
Take a second or third shot from the same position, and they’ll be able to 
triangulate your position, and before long you may find your cover blown 
and a steady stream of reinforcements charging at you.
The exception to the “stay on the move” rule comes when you’ve found 
a sniper nest without nearby enemies. From those magical perches, you 
can cut down dozens of Jerrys and rack up points like you’re pulling 
tricks in a Tony Hawk game. Points increase your rank and earn money, 
which in turn gives you access to weapon upgrades, skins, and new 
loadout options. We also love the fact that you can demoralize the enemy 
by taking out the officers first, or give yourself more of a challenge by 
saving them until the end of each mission. 
Aside from sniper rifles, you have an SMG and a sidearm to deal damage at 
closer range, and while effective in many circumstances, you can’t rely on 
them to get you through the swarm of soldiers. We know this because we 
tried it, and that sickening click click click of a gun with an empty magazine 
is the last thing you’ll hear if you follow suit. Sniper Elite 4 is a slow-paced 
game, and you will fail if you try to play it like a Call Of Duty game. 
If you’re of the opinion that modern shooters could use a little more World 
War II and a whole lot less wall-running and jet packs, then Sniper Elite 4 is 
the breath of fresh air you’ve been looking for. ■

Q&A With Matt Waite
Exploring The Space 
Where Drones & Journalism Meet 
some new technology in order to do the 
things I want to do.  
Q
: What is it about drones specifically 
that grabbed your interest, and when 
did you realize drones and journalism 
was something you needed to work on? 
MW
: It was sort of the perfect 
intersection of a lot of 
things that I had been looking at for a 
long time. In my career as a newspaper 
reporter, I was very interested in what 
we now call “data journalism,” which is 
using databases of public information 
and analysis software to find stories that 
aren’t immediately apparent. To find 
patterns in the data and reveal things 
that aren’t clear to the naked eye. One of 
those techniques I was really interested 
in using was geographic information 
systems, so computerized mapping and 
using mapping almost as a database 
platform where you could do geospatial 
and all of a sudden these nine-track tape 
machines would start going crazy. We 
thought that was the greatest thing. So, 
yeah, since literally my first memories 
from the late 1970s, I’ve been around 
technology and knew it was going to be a 
part of everything I did, and I always saw 
technology as some sort of a super power 
to whatever I was trying to do. Half the 
time, I’m searching for excuses to learn 
Q
: You have a strong connection with 
technology that started well before 
your work with drones, including 
working on projects involving web 
and app development. Has technology 
always had a presence in your life? 
MW
: Yeah, it’s been pretty much 
a part of my life since the 
beginning. My dad worked at a software 
company that did telephone billing for 
small telephone companies. Some of my 
earliest memories are using old punch 
cards from mainframes as coloring 
paper. When he had to go down to 
the office sometimes at odd hours, me 
and my brother, or just me, he’d take 
us down there, and we’d sit on his lap. 
We’d be sitting in front of these old 
IBM mainframe terminals and these 
giant mechanical keyboards and he’d 
tell us to start typing stuff, and we’d be 
running these massive data jobs on these 
gigantic mainframes. We’d hit ENTER 
Since late August when the Federal Aviation Administration enacted new rules for UAS (unmanned aircraft systems), or drones, 
journalists have been able to use the flying devices for newsgathering purposes, provided the journalist first pass an FAA test 
and obtain a drone operator’s license. Previously, a journalist who wanted to, say, capture footage of a flood or wildfire from 
above had to obtain an aviation pilot’s license to fly a drone for commercial purposes. The alternative was renting helicopter or 
airplane time to take aerial photos, something most newsrooms can’t afford to do consistently. With the new rules, newsrooms 
can now obtain an affordable camera-equipped drone and greatly expand their coverage while simultaneously providing their 
audiences greater insight and different perspectives into their communities. 
Matt Waite has been an integral figure in the use of drones for journalistic purposes. A principal developer of the Pulitzer 
Prize-winning website PolitiFact.com, Waite is currently a professor of practice at the College of Journalism and Mass 
Communications at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln where he teaches reporting and digital product development. In 
addition to creating a Drone Journalism Lab at UNL several years ago, Waite helped organize a sold-out Drone Journalism 
Boot Camp last summer that will expand to several other universities this year. Waite also helped create the Drone Journalism 
Lab Operations Manual, a freely available and open document that provides journalists with guidelines for safely using drones 
in the field. We spoke with Waite about the benefits drones can provide newsrooms and their audiences, privacy and safety 
concerns related to drones, and more. (You can read our full conversation at www.computerpoweruser.com/24120 )

a pretty good model that will do the job. 
When we start to expand it into using them 
for mapping or using different sensors 
on them to do remote sensing and start 
to be able to see things that aren’t actually 
visible in the landscape and start revealing 
deeper meanings in our communities, that’s 
extraordinarily powerful, and that’s not a 
power that has been available to a lot of 
newsrooms. This is not a skill set that is 
common in a lot of newsrooms, to be able 
to do remote sensing analysis or to think 
about mapping. 
I think the power here is clear enough 
that it is going to change newsrooms, and 
it is going to change the skill sets within 
them. And in the process, that’s going 
to open people’s minds up to what their 
communities look like from a different 
perspective, from a different scale. It will 
start to reveal hidden consequences of 
decisions, development decisions, or 
environmental decisions. It will start to 
give us an idea of how big things are or 
how far they extend out into the horizon 
or what kind of impact they have on the 
landscape because it’s really hard to see 
those things from the ground. And now 
that pretty much anybody who can study 
for a test and pass it with a 70% score can 
put a flying camera in the air, that’s going 
to increase the amount of perspectives we 
have into our communities, and that can 
only change the way we see them.
Q
: You started the Drone Journalism 
Lab at the University of Nebraska-
Lincoln. You also held a Drone 
Journalism Boot Camp last summer. 
What was the impetus for both of those 
efforts, and are there plans to hold 
more boot camps?
MW
: Well, breaking news as we’re 
talking, four more boot camps 
have been announced around the country 
for this year. They are at the University of 
Georgia, Syracuse University in upstate 
New York, the University of Wisconsin, 
and the University of Oregon. They will 
be happening at dates throughout the 
year. The announcement literally just 
went up, so we are going to continue 
within a matter of hours after a hurricane 
goes through. I mean, we could do this 
faster than the government could do it.” 
I was just drooling on the floor about 
that idea. So I ran over to the sales guy on 
the convention floor and said, “I’ll take 
that one.” He laughed and handed me 
my wallet back and said, “Well, they’re 
about $65,000 each. And oh by the way, 
they are completely illegal in the United 
States.” So, being sort of heartbroken 
about that, I couldn’t put the idea away. 
It was this perfect intersection of data, of 
technology, of storytelling power, of being 
able to see things that aren’t immediately 
apparent. It seemed like the perfect tool 
for investigative journalism. I couldn’t 
walk away from it from that point on, 
and that’s how it all sort of came about.
Q
: You’ve written that “drones are an 
ideal platform for journalism.” You 
also said in a TED talk that you believe 
drones will help journalists change 
how we see our communities. Can you 
expand on those beliefs? 
MW
: Even right out of the box 
with no real creativity or 
thought given to them, a drone is an 
extraordinarily useful tool for visual 
journalism. With anything that has any 
sort of large-scale extent—a tornado 
goes through a town, a flood happens, 
a big wildfire, all these different events 
that are large—unless you can see some 
perspective on them, they’re really hard 
to sort of wrap your mind around as to 
how large they are. Well, you could take 
a drone straight out of the box, turn it 
on, go straight up into the air 100 feet, 
turn the camera on, just start looking 
around, come straight back down, and 
you’ve done a ton to open people’s minds 
to how big or how far something goes. 
And that’s even before you learned how to 
make it move forward. All you have to do 
is go straight up and down. 
That’s your opening move with a drone. 
You’ve vastly expanded people’s idea of how 
big something is. That alone is worth the 
investment to get one, and we’re talking 
anywhere from $1,500 to $4,000 for 
analysis. In my time in Florida at the St. 
Petersburg Times, I did a lot of satellite 
imagery analysis. I was really interested 
in how we could use remote sensing to 
do journalism and tell stories and how we 
could use aerial imagery. There were all 
these sites that we were going out to while 
I was doing these stories, which were 
about how Florida’s wetlands were being 
wiped out by development at the same 
time that state and federal regulators said 
they were not being wiped. We would go 
out to these locations and I kept thinking, 
“It would be great to get into the air. It 
would be great to get into the air where it 
would be better to see this. Even if it was 
just low altitude, it would be great.” 
But I sort of kept those thoughts to 
myself in the back of my head. There 
wasn’t a lot I could do with it. Even in 
the sort of halcyon days of newspapering 
in the early 2000s when things hadn’t 
totally gone to crap yet, you couldn’t 
just go rent airplanes even if you wanted 
to. It wasn’t until the summer of 2011 
when I was at a GIS conference out 
in Southern California when I saw a 
company selling a drone that billed itself 
as a “fully autonomous aerial mapping 
platform.” It was a fixed-wing aircraft 
with a camera on the bottom of it and a 
computer onboard. You programmed it 
by drawing a rectangle around a field on a 
tablet computer, told it where you wanted 
to take off from and where you wanted 
to land, and you plugged that flight 
plan into a computer and off it went. 
It would fly back and forth across that 
field taking pictures of the ground the 
whole time. The thing would land, you’d 
pull the memory card out of the camera, 
you’d shove it into that tablet computer, 
and it would stitch it all together into a 
high-resolution composite image of the 
ground. It would be geo-rectified so that 
you could put that into any geographic 
information system, any mapping system, 
and it would pop right onto the ground 
where it was supposed to be on the earth.
I thought of all the hurricanes I’d 
ever covered as a reporter in Florida and 
thought, “Oh my, we could be doing 
hyper-accurate damage-assessment stories 
80 March2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

Q
: You also created a Drone Jour-
nalism Lab Operations Manual. 
Why was that something important to 
create, and what does it entail?
MW
: By the time the new FAA 
regulations that allowed for 
commercial drone use came about, we 
had flown drones in like six different 
countries in three different continents 
and had a fair bit of practical experience. 
It became pretty clear to us from just 
doing this that we needed to write down 
the best practices for what we do. How do 
you do things so you do them correctly 
every time? Safety, of course, is one of the 
foremost things. Making sure the drone 
is being maintained and the batteries 
are properly treated and so forth. And 
doing this across a group of people in an 
organization. A fair bit of time, the drone 
went overseas and I did not. It went with 
a student, so that student needed to know 
what the other students needed to know 
and what I needed to know. So it argued 
for formulization. 
Then, as we were doing it and started 
to write things down and saying things 
like, “Before you go out on trip, you 
need to do this, this, and this. Before you 
turn the thing on, you need to do this, 
this, and this. You need to check that 
this is tight. Make sure this is attached. 
Make sure this isn’t loose. Make sure the 
card in the camera is cleared off so you 
don’t run out of space.” Things like this. 
And we realized that if we need this, 
everyone needs this. And a manual was a 
way that we could immediately have an 
impact on the journalism field in a very 
practical and direct means. The Knight 
Foundation, which was our first and most 
generous backer—we had been working 
on sort of an ebook for them—we just 
realized that if we really wanted to have 
an impact that this was the way to do it. 
Just do this manual and make it freely 
available for everybody, and it would just 
jumpstart newsrooms all over the place. 
Have a process. Have policies. Have 
things written down that can help you 
make decisions, and then you can make 
decisions the same way every time. ■
said we were an educational institutional, 
and then a year later, they changed 
their mind and said education isn’t covered 
as a government function. So we needed 
to go be a commercial operation, which 
meant going and getting a pilot’s license, 
an actual manned aircraft pilot’s license at 
the time. 
I went out and did that—got a 
manned aircraft pilot’s license—so I 
could fly a 3-pound hunk of plastic on 
the ground under FAA regulations. And 
then after I had done that, they of course 
changed everything again and came out 
with the now-existing drone rules. It has 
been a wild ride, but mostly the lab is 
space in my office right now. Students 
come in and work with me on things, 
experiments and different things. We’re 
going to be doing some licensing training 
courses for students in the spring. We’ll 
have a course in the fall that will involve 
drones and 360-degree filmmaking. 
That’s all learning coming from the 
lab that will influence that class. We’ve 
intentionally kept it really informal 
because everything was changing so much 
all the time, and half the time, we were 
involved in the very nitty-gritty regulatory 
changes, much to our chagrin. It slowed 
things way, way, way down from what we 
originally expected. 
offering the boot camps. They are 
going to be expanding a little bit. Now 
they’re going to involve faculty from the 
Poynter Institute for Media Studies and 
a more formalized involvement from the 
National Press Photographers Association 
and its general counsel Mickey 
Osterreicher, who is a fabulous guy. He 
was at the boot camp here in Lincoln, 
but the NPPA is now a formal partner 
and sponsor in the boot camps. I had 
hoped to do more last year, but time and 
opportunity slipped away. 
The Drone Journalism Lab was started 
with this very thing in mind. It was started 
with the idea that drones were going to 
be a big deal in newsrooms, and because 
there were really unclear regulations or 
nonexistent regulations and some distant 
promise of regulations down the road, 
we actually took time to do a little bit of 
study and see sort of what the practical 
and legal and ethical problems were going 
to be and how might we mitigate those 
before we even went out and started doing 
our first stories. It turned out to be a much 
more difficult thing to do actual in-the-
field research because we were on the tip 
of the sphere with the FAA and its sort 
of confusion about how to regulate these 
things. They sent us a cease-and-desist 
order in the summer of 2013 because they

that drones were going to be

Q&A With Eugene Kuo
MSI Marketing Manager Talks 
G.A.M.E. UNLIMITED Desktop PCs
our company, and our products reflect 
that. When developing our desktops, we 
sought input from a variety of gamers 
of all types, from casual gamers to pro 
players. By doing this, we were able to 
adjust our products accordingly and 
are able to provide the features and 
functionalities that real gamers are 
looking for. For example, our vertical 
video card design not only helps with 
preventing video card sag or broken 
PCIe slots, but also showcases the 
aesthetics of the Twin Frozr VI GPU 
Cooler, as well.
Q
: Your new lineup includes several 
small-form-factor units, and some-
times SFF rigs can be tightly packed affairs 
with components that are hard to get 
to. What did you do with your desktop 
designs to avoid this problem?
EK
: A lot of gamers are looking at 
SFF rigs these days. Desk space 
others. This keeps the temperatures cooler, 
which in turn helps keep the noise of the 
fans down. For example, the Aegis Ti3 
separates the GPU, CPU, and PSU into 
three separate chambers.
Q
: Do you sell the Dragon liquid-
cooling system separately for builders 
who are interested, or is it strictly available 
in MSI gaming desktops?
EK
: At the moment, we do not sell 
our Dragon liquid-cooling systems 
as a standalone product. However, if there 
is enough interest we might consider it.
Q
: Moving on to the second component 
of the G.A.M.E. acronym, Absolute 
Gaming DNA. Can you explain to readers 
what that means?
EK
: MSI is all about gaming. We 
pour thousands and thousands of 
hours into playing the games we love at 
Q
: So, you recently launched a new 
lineup of gaming desktops equipped 
with Intel Kaby Lake processors, right? 
You’ve referred to the new desktops as 
“G.A.M.E. UNLIMITED.” Can you tell 
us what that means?
EK
: G.A.M.E. UNLIMITED is 
what MSI is trying to bring 
to the table with the latest Intel 
7th Generation Gaming desktops. 
G.A.M.E. stands for Gaming 
Performance, Absolute Gaming DNA, 
Magnificent Audio, and Essential 
Connectivity. We are implementing all 
the feedback from gamers around the 
world into our products.
Q
: OK, let’s start with the first aspect 
of the name, Gaming Performance. 
What do your desktops offer specifically 
in the area of enhanced performance?
EK
: Our goal with gaming perfor-
mance is very simple: getting you 
the highest FPS to play the latest games. 
We implement this by including obviously 
Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors, MSI’s 
award-winning GeForce GTX 10 series 
gaming graphics cards, and a variety of 
features and functionalities such as 
Silent Storm Cooling to help keep your 
temperatures low and Game Boost for no-
nonsense overclocking.
Q
: Generally speaking, increased per-
formance also equals increased heat 
and noise. You mentioned Silent Storm 
Cooling; that’s something designed to 
address these factors?
EK
: With what we call “Silent Storm 
Cooling,” we separate the desktop 
into two or three chambers to keep the 
heat from each component away from the

that more or less a fast LAN connection, 
or is there more to it than that?
EK
: To many, the gaming desktop is 
the central hub of all their tech. 
Almost everything is plugged into it. 
Aside from a fast Killer Network LAN/
WLAN, we implemented a variety of 
different connection options, including 
USB 3.1 with Super Charger 2 (for fast 
charging of your mobile device), USB 
Type-C, and even a VR link to plug your 
VR headset into the front of the desktop 
instead of having to always reach around 
the back to plug it in.
Q
: OK, so what does Dragon Eye 
2.0 do?
EK
: Dual monitor configs are 
becoming more and more 
common in gaming setups, but for 
those who only have one monitor, 
Dragon Eye 2.0 is a program that allows 
you to watch movies or streams/guides 
without having to ALT+TAB between 
windows. It creates a small picture-in-
picture that you can position and resize 
however you like it right on top of your 
current game.
Q
: That sounds great. Where can 
readers go for more information 
about MSI’s new Kaby Lake-equipped 
desktop PCs?
EK
: You can check out more at 
our website: https://us.msi.com/
Landing/msi-kabylake-gaming-desktop.
Q
: Is there anything else you’d like 
readers to know about your G.A.M.E. 
UNLIMITED systems?
EK
: Currently we are offering 
a sweet promotion that can 
net you both For Honor and Tom 
Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Wildlands—
plus the Wildlands season pass—if 
you buy an MSI gaming desktop. You 
can find more info at https://us.msi
.com/Promotion/for-honor-ghost-recon
-wildlands-bundle. ■
EK
: Audio is one of the biggest 
things about gaming. To truly 
immerse yourself and enjoy a game, the 
audio needs to be at a top-tier level along 
with your graphics. We implemented 
a suite of audio enhancements (both 
hardware and software) such as Audio 
Boost, ESS Sabre, and Nahimic Sound 
enhancer to deliver the highest-quality 
audio to your ears.
Q
: We’ve read a little about Nahimic’s 
audio technology in conjunction 
with MSI motherboards; can you talk a 
little more about what it does?
EK
: Nahimic Audio was actually 
something that the French Army 
first adopted for its aircraft training 
simulators. We took that technology and 
brought it to our products to offer gamers 
a 3D sound effect to help them better 
hear where certain sounds are coming 
from. If you are playing an FPS game, 
Nahimic will enhance the directional 
output of the sound so you can get a 
clearer idea of the location it came from.
Q
: Finally, G.A.M.E. UNLIMITED 
includes Essential Connectivity. Is 
is always a very valuable resource, so 
we took it upon ourselves to create a 
product that could be both small and 
powerful at the same time. If you look 
at our Trident 3 mini gaming PC, 
the design and layout of the internals 
were made in a very purposeful way 
so that they’d still be very easy to 
upgrade. There are a lot of DIY SFF 
rigs out there that have definitely 
impressed us, but we’ve also seen 
many that are very cluttered inside. 
Our custom solution gets rid of a 
lot of that clutter, as we are able to 
custom-design and custom-build our 
desktop from the ground up. 
Q
: What can you tell us about MSI’s 
Mystic Light feature?
EK
: Mystic Light is our RGB LED 
feature. You can control both the 
interior and exterior lights through our 
gaming app, which allows you to choose 
different colors and modes to fine-tune how 
you want your MSI desktop to look.
Q
: The third component of the G.A.M.E. 
UNLIMITED formula is Magnificent 
Audio. What does that entail?
Three of MSI’s new G.A.M.E. UNLIMITED desktop PCs: the Aegis Ti3 (left), Aegis 3 (top right), and the 
Trident 3 (bottom right).
