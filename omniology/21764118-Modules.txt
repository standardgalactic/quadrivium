Go Modules
●
Modules are supported starting with Go v1.11 but the implementation was ﬁnalized in Go 
v1.13.
●
But what is in fact a module?
○
A module is a collection of related Go packages stored in a directory tree with a 
go.mod ﬁle at its root. 
●
A module contains one or more packages like a package contains one or more .go ﬁles.
●
A ﬁle called go.mod deﬁnes the module’s path, which is also the import path, and its 
dependency requirements.
●
The go command has direct support to work with modules, including recording and 
resolving dependencies on other modules.
