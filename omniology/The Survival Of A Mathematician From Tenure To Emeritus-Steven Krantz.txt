Preface
The tradition in mathematics is that the profession is a sink-or-swim oper-
ation. Nobody tells you, once you earn the venerable Ph.D., what you are
supposed to do next. If you are lucky, your thesis advisor will get you a job.
If you are especially lucky, this will be an academic job. But, in point of
fact, there are many choices these days. Your ﬁrst job could be at a lab that
is part of the genome project. It could be at Microsoft. It could be with the
Federal Government. But then just what are you supposed to do? How do
you function? What are your goals? What is expected of you? To whom are
you answerable?
It is a hard fact that more than 90% of American Ph.D. mathematicians
never write a paper. Of those who do, most write just one paper based on
the Ph.D. thesis and that’s it. Nothing more. Why is this? Is the cutting of
the (academic) umbilical cord so traumatic that most people just fall oﬀthe
wagon? Or are the reasons more complicated? Do people just get wrapped
up in other duties, or other career pursuits, and decide after a while that
“Publish or perish” is not part of their credo? Are they perhaps in a job
where publishing and doing research is not really the thing that is rewarded?
And what about teaching? If you are working for the National Security
Agency (as, for instance, three of my Ph.D. students now are), then you
certainly will not be teaching classes, or grading papers, or giving grades.
But you will have to give seminars. You will have to mentor others. You
will have to provide guidance to younger staﬀmembers. How does one learn
these skills?
And, no matter where you work or what you do, you will no doubt work
as part of a team. You will have to function in meetings, and on conference
calls, and in interactions with your supervisors and your underlings.

If you are in an academic job, then your role(s) in life are carefully de-
lineated and described in your institution’s Tenure Document: teaching, re-
search, and service are the three branches of an academic’s professional activ-
ity. He/she is judged on each of these, and in diﬀerent ways. For example, if
you manage to prove the Riemann hypothesis, then it doesn’t matter whether
you spend your time at staﬀmeetings rolling your eyes and humming The
Battle Hymn of the Republic. If you are a world-class teacher, then you will
probably be granted some slack in your research program. If you are a terriﬁc
departmental citizen, seen as a person who holds the ship of state together,
then you will perhaps not have to put in quite so much time on the other
two portions of your proﬁle.
The bottom line is that there is an awful lot about this profession that
you are going to have to ﬁgure out for yourself. This book is intended to
help you through the process. One of the main messages here is to talk to
people. Find a senior faculty member who is willing to let his/her hair down
and tell you some things about how life works in your department, or your
organization, or your company. Bond with others who are your peers, and
who can share experiences with you. Become friendly with the staﬀ, with
the Chair, with the key players in your group or department. I can assure
you that—if you are in an academic department—a good deal of the decision
of whether to tenure you is based on raw quality, but another good part of it
is based on collegiality and whether you will ﬁt in. Is this someone that we
want to have knocking about in this building for the next forty years or not?
Is this someone whom we would look forward to seeing each day? These are
intangibles, not written in any guidebook or Tenure Document. But they are
facts of life.
The purpose of the present volume is to give you some hints as to how
to make your way in the academic world, or more generally in the corporate
world or professional world of mathematics. I cannot claim to be expert in
every nuance and corner of the profession; but I have had more experience
than most. I can certainly help you to avoid most of the pitfalls.
I should perhaps stress that I know quite a lot about the life of a math-
ematician in the United States. I know very little about that life in other
countries. I do know that there can be considerable diﬀerences—in culture,
in style, and in emphases. I must leave it to another scholar to write a book
about the mathematical life in Italy or Sri Lanka.
I also note that my book A Mathematician’s Survival Guide was written
a few years ago to help the student learn how to become a mathematician.

ix
This new book is intended to pick up where that one left oﬀ. Reading this
tract will tell you how to advance throug the ranks, how to survive in your
Department, and how to get along in the mathematical life.
It is a pleasure to thank Robert Burckel, Gerald B. Folland, and James
S. Walker for a careful reading of an early draft of this book, and for con-
tributing many useful and incisive comments. Ed Dunne, as always, was an
encouraging and proactive Editor. He read several drafts of the book and
contributed decisively to its form and structure.
Mathematics is a highly varied, rich, and rewarding life. Welcome to it.
I hope that you spend a very pleasant and productive thirty or forty years
making your way throught the profession, and that you ﬁnd many rewards
and comforts. May this book be your touchstone as you get started.

CHAPTER 1. I DIDN’T SIGN ON FOR THIS!
1.1
What am I Doing Here?
And well might you ask. When I landed my ﬁrst job—an Assistant Profes-
sorship at UCLA—I may as well have been placed as ﬁrst trombone in the
Milwaukee Symphony. I had no clue of who I was or where I was supposed to
be or what I was supposed to do. Well, that is not quite true. I knew that I
was a Math Professor and that I was supposed to teach classes and to prove
theorems. But I had no detailed knowledge of what that really entailed.
Certainly the ﬁrst thing you should do when you show up in your new
department is to go to the Chair’s oﬃce and introduce yourself to people.
This includes all the secretaries and the staﬀ, and of course the Chair or
Head himself/herself. Be prepared to sit for a while and pass the time of day
with the Chair. Discuss your duties, your goals, and your frame of mind as
you join this new department. Ask the Chair whom you should meet, who
will be the key people in your life.
You will also want to ﬁnd out who is the Vice-Chair for Undergraduate
Studies and the Vice-Chair for Graduate Studies and introduce yourself to
those people. You may not have meaningful relationships with those people
for a while yet. But they are, or will be, signiﬁcant players in your life. You
want to know who they are, and you want them on your team. Spend a
little time studying the entire composition of the Department. There may
be a Coordinator of lower division Teaching, a Supervisor of Undergraduate
Advising, a Graduate Student Mentor, and any number of other people whom
you never dreamed of before. They are all a part of your world now, and you
would be well to get to know them all. At least to the extent of being able
to say hello to them when you meet them in the hall.
An immediate need and responsibility for you is to ﬁnd out who are the
key people in your subject (i.e., research) area. Knock on their doors. Intro-
duce yourself. Find out when the seminar meets and become an active and
participating member. That means that you should volunteer to give talks,
you should attend all the meetings, you should participate enthusiastically
and meaningfully. If the analysts are all in the habit of going out for a beer
on Friday afternoons, and if you are an analyst, then you had best join in. If
there is an intramural soccer team, then you probably ought to throw your
hat in the ring.
When I was at UCLA, all the movers and shakers in the Math Department
participated in a weekly poker game. It was by invitation only, and I was
never invited. But this was where many of the most important departmental

1.2. GETTING TO KNOW YOU
5
decisions were made. It was the proverbial “smoke-ﬁlled room” where deals
were made and broken. If you were part of it, then you were a “made man.”
Otherwise not.
This is life. What appears on the surface of things, what is written in the
University Catalogue, what is written in the Tenure Document, is only the
tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding how the place really works
and how the power structure really functions. It is essential that you develop
a good, working relationship with a senior mentor—someone who can give
you regular reality checks on how things are going in the department, and
particularly how you are doing in the department. How can you ﬁnd such a
person, and get to know him/her? More will be said about this matter as
the book develops. Certainly attending seminars, going to teas, attending
social events, and cultivating mathematical conversations are obvious ways
to start. Some departments or organizations will actually assign you a senior
mentor the day that you walk in the door. In my own Department we found
that this didn’t work very well because it was a bit artiﬁcial. Most times you
will have to identify and develop a relationship with such a person yourself.
1.2
Getting to Know You
I have already said that you must get to know people. If you land at your
new job and just hide in your oﬃce, then your future will not be bright. You
may be chuckling in your beard, but in fact it’s all too easy in an academic
job to just teach your calculus classes and then go home. That is a sure
recipe for failure.
You really want to become a ﬁxture around the department. You want
the staﬀto like you and to think of you as someone that they can depend
on. You want the senior faculty to look forward to seeing you each day. To
look forward to hearing about your (mathematical) results. What is best is,
when a senior faculty member goes to another school to give a colloquium,
or goes to a conference, he/she should be saying to his friends, “We’ve got
this terriﬁc new young guy/gal in our department. He/she is a real plus
to our program, and a gifted young mathematician. We were lucky to hire
him/her.”
I don’t mean to downplay your potential relationship with other junior
faculty or junior staﬀ. These are really your brothers-in-arms, and you want
to get to know them too. Certainly don’t think of yourselves as competitors

CHAPTER 1. I DIDN’T SIGN ON FOR THIS!
for some mutually exclusive holy grail. It’s not as though if Bob gets tenure
then the slot is gone so you will be denied tenure. Usually tenure is a zero-
one game that you play against yourself. That is, if you make the grade
you get tenure and if you don’t make the grade you don’t. It happens only
very occasionally (contrary to what you may see in a Hollywood movie) that
a department will be told that for budgetary reasons they can only tenure
one person this year—even though they have three good candidates who are
ready for tenure.
These days there are some very useful and proactive organizations that
help young mathematicians, and more generally young scholars, get oriented
in their new professional lives. One of these is the Young Mathematician’s
Network (YMN). Located at http://concerns.youngmath.net/, this is an
organization founded by a group of young mathematicians who wanted to
create a resource for people looking for jobs, people trying to get settled
in a new department, people trying to get tenure. Going to the Web site,
you will see that YMN sponsors conferences, hosts Web sites and discussion
groups, and mentors activities around the country. Most of the founders
of this enterprise now have tenure in some good department around the
country, and the torch has been passed to a new generation. But the activity
continues, and it is certainly valuable and worthwhile. In fact it has spawned
the book [BEC], and this is a ﬁne resource for the beginning mathematician.
Another excellent touchstone for the beginning mathematician, or more
generally the beginning scholar, is Project NExT, sponsored by the Exxon-
Mobil Foundation. Project NExT is overseen and administered by the Math-
ematical Association of America. This is a loose-knit organization of junior
faculty across the country who want to share common interests and con-
cerns. They are mentored by a broad cross-section of senior mathematicians
who make themselves available for consultation or for just chewing the rag.
The Project NExT people have their main meeting each year at the Sum-
mer MathFest (sponsored by the MAA); then they reconvene, at a smaller
event, at the January AMS/MAA meetings. They also organize other special
events. Project NExT endeavors to inform its members about publishing,
about tenure, about teaching, and about getting along in a math depart-
ment.1 It has done a lot of good for a lot of people, and I encourage you to
get involved—the Web site is http://archives.math.utk.edu/projnext/.

1.3
Getting to Know your Teaching
Teaching is exciting and rewarding and can also be fun. Interacting with
bright young people is certainly one of the ﬁner things in life. Explaining
important ideas to a receptive audience is fulﬁlling, and is also important for
bringing a new generation of young adults up to speed in our discipline. You
are fortunate and privileged to be part of an avocation that puts you front
and center in this process. Make the most of it.
What does this mean? First of all, you will get a whole lot more out of
your teaching—and everyone else will too—if you are reasonably good at it.
The ability to teach well is not something you are just born with—like the
ability to hear with perfect pitch. It is a cultivated skill, and one that you
should start working on right away. Some of the traits of a good teacher are
simply matters of tending to business: You prepare your lectures carefully,
you write a good syllabus, you choose an appropriate and readable text.
Other traits are special and personal and will require hard work.
You will probably have had some experience as a Teaching Assistant
or TA, and that is an activity that sort of resembles teaching. But really
teaching—being in charge of a class, writing the exams, assigning the grades,
handling the problem situations—is a rather more sophisticated activity.
I may humbly suggest that you consult the book [KRA1], which will give
you the full story on almost every aspect of teaching, and more particularly
of teaching mathematics. God is in the details, and you will ﬁnd that the
enterprise of teaching is certainly a whole that is greater than the sum of its
parts. Preparation is a big part of being an eﬀective teacher. You want to
convey the immediate and powerful impression that you are a professional
who is on top of the material and who knows how to communicate it. Many
of your other shortcomings will be forgiven, or at least overlooked, if it is
clear that you are a pro who is doing his/her best to do a top-notch job.
You want to be courteous, kind, and fair. I haved always gotten along well
with my classes, and garnered reasonably good teaching evaluations,2 but
in recent years I have done even better than usual because students warm
up to the fact that I am so easy-going. What does this mean? I think it
means that when they come to me with a problem—a forgotten assignment,
or an overslept exam, or a plane ticket that conﬂicts with the ﬁnal, or some
2There are a few exceptions, such as the teaching evaluation that said that I should
not be allowed to teach any biped in any state West of the Mississippi.

CHAPTER 1. I DIDN’T SIGN ON FOR THIS!
other completely irrational, unjustiﬁable quagmire of a situation—I always
say, “OK, we can probably handle that. Let’s sit down and work something
out.” I have found over the years that such an attitude requires no more
eﬀort, and is no more of a strain, than chewing the student out, or trying to
create more trouble for everyone.
There are particular skills to writing a good exam, to grading the exams
fairly, to determining course grades, and so forth. It requires some genuine
insight to assess a class, determine the students’ level and preparation, and
then pitch the lessons so that the students will understand them and beneﬁt
from them. Again, these matters are addressed in some detail in [KRA1].
Good teaching is a skill that you will hone over a period of years, just like
a good golf game or a good attack on the cello. Talking to colleagues, both
your senior mentors and your peer junior faculty, is an extremely valuable
exercise. It is always useful to bounce your ideas oﬀof others with a similar
set of experiences. Sometimes you can do a thought experiment with your
friends and thereby avoid a cataclysm in the classroom.
Whether you hang your hat in a research department or a teaching de-
partment or (like my own) a department that is a mixture of both, you will
do well to have a positive teaching reputation. You will thereby have the re-
spect and admiration of your students and colleagues, and a deﬁnite plus in
your portfolio. It is unlikely that you will get tenure just on the basis of your
teaching alone, but teaching will certainly play a key role in the decision.
1.4
Getting to Know the Other Aspects of
Your Life
We shall say repeatedly in this book that the three big vectors in an academic
life are
• teaching
• research
• service
Of course one of the main messages of the book is that there really is a lot
more to it than that simple list. But those three are milestones, and we shall
say a great deal in the ensuing pages about them.

1.5. COLLEGIALITY
9
Service is in some sense the easy part of your life. Because you don’t
even have to think about it. It will be thrust upon you. That is to say, you
will live your ordinary life in the Math Department, and you will be assigned
certain committee or taskforce duties. And you will do them. For most of us,
that is the extent of service. You can be asked to serve on University-wide
committees, and you should do so with your usual aplomb and profession-
alism. You might be tapped to be Vice-Chair for Undergraduate Studies
or Vice-Chair for Graduate Studies or even Chair (i.e., Chairman or Head).
For these you will probably not give a knee-jerk “yes” answer, because any of
these is a big commitment. On the one hand, you feel an obligation to serve
your colleagues and your institution. On the other hand you have a life to
live. You may have a signiﬁcant other, and a family, and perhaps a church.
You need to balance all the components of your life. Subsequent sections of
this book will discuss the various aspects of these diﬀerent types of service
and what they entail.
Perhaps the most diﬃcult—and also the most rewarding—of the three
components indicated above is research. It is diﬃcult because most likely
nobody has told you how to build your own research career, how to forge a
path in the research world, how to establish a research identity. More at the
level of the nitty gritty, how do you ﬁnd problems that are worth working on
and how do you solve them and how do you write them up and how do you
get them published? This is the essential question to answer if you want to
establish a scholarly reputation and get tenure in a good Department. All
of Chapter 4 is devoted to diﬀerent aspects of the research life, and how to
cope with them.
This book tries to paint your life as a tapestry with many woofs and
wefts. You need to get along with many diﬀerent types of people and you
need to master many diﬀerent kinds of tasks. And do so gracefully and with
skill. If you can do so, then you will lead a rewarding and productive life,
and you can write a version of this book for the next generation.
1.5
Collegiality
In the 1950s, 1960s, and even most of the 1970s, Math Departments were
extraordinarily friendly places. Salaries were low, duties were many, but the
attitude was “we’re all in this together.” The lovely book [DAVH] captures
the spirit of the camaraderie of the time.

10
CHAPTER 1. I DIDN’T SIGN ON FOR THIS!
It was very common in those days for there to be a colloquium each week,
followed by a fairly large and high-spirited colloquium dinner, followed by
a party at someone’s house. When I was an Assistant Professor at UCLA
we had all these features, often followed by a nude swim in Richard Arens’s
pool.
In fact I can recall many a time when, after lunch, one of the guys (and
this time I really do mean a guy) would phone home and say, “Hello, Dear.
Joe Schlomokin from Purdue is in town. He’s giving a talk. Nobody else is
giving the party, so I thought we could do it. Could you run to the store and
pick up some stuﬀ? Also he needs a place to ﬂop and I told him he could
sleep on our sofa. We’ll be going to dinner, and we’ll show up at the party
at 8:00pm.” Miraculously, the spouse would reply with suitable enthusiasm,
and the festivities would begin in due course.
Times have changed.
Today most spouses work.
Many spouses work
as academics, and often in the same department as the other spouse. So
there are a lot of shared responsibilities: child rearing, cooking, soccer game
coaching, and on and on. This means that attendance at colloquium dinners
is much thinner.
This means that there is nobody to phone up and tell
to go out and pick up stuﬀfor an impromptu party. And so forth. There
are very few colloquium parties anymore—except for very distinguished or
special guests.
Also the discipline has become more competitive. In the old days nobody
was paid very well and almost everyone with a body temperature above
93◦had an NSF research grant. Today salaries are all over the map—and
everyone knows it—and NSF grants are about as hard to get as vintage Elvis
Presley records. Often the department colloquium has disintegrated into a
number of competing seminars.
I don’t mean to paint a bleak picture. Math Departments can still be
friendly places—fun to work in and intellectually stimulating. But they are
diﬀerent than in years past.
In the late 1970s at UCLA there was a very special logic seminar called
the Cabal Seminar.
One might wonder about the provenance of this un-
usual name. Certainly it suggests something dark and mysterious for the
cognoscenti. It turns out that the seminar was named after the organizers’
favorite real estate agent. Whenever they used her services to help a new
mathematician relocate, she would give them a kickback from her commis-
sion. And they used the money to run the seminar.
The pleasures derived from this largesse were quite evident. On Fridays,

1.6. WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO LIFE?
11
when the rest of us were at tea eating Ritz crackers and drinking tepid tea,
the logicians would be sitting oﬀin the corner drinking chilled wine and
eating camembert and pˆat´e de foie gras. And they were able to bring in a
number of classy speakers for their mathematical activities.
This is just the reality of life. There was nothing unfriendly about what
the logicians were doing. But those who have enjoy and those who don’t
have don’t.
It is important to do what you can to contribute to the collegiality of your
Department. Go to lunch with colleagues. Participate in pingpong games or
intramural sports. Go out with friends for a beer after work. Get together
on weekends for barbecues or picnics. Give as many parties as you (and your
partner) feel comfortable giving. Working with people whom you like and
trust, and with whom you feel comfortable, is a commodity that you just
cannot buy. It can really smooth things out in your professional life.
1.6
What Else is There to Life?
Well, more than you ever imagined. I have been a Professor now for 33 years,
and my mother still thinks that all I do is teach. When I tell her that my
teaching load is typically two courses per term, she wonders what I do with
the rest of my time. I am tempted to say that I coach the football team.
An academic mathematician is not a high school teacher. While teaching
is a very important part of what you do, it is by no means the only thing.
Measure by the number of hours you will put into it, teaching is well less
than half of what you do.
The rest of what you do is (i) research, (ii) exposition, (iii) Departmen-
tal administrative activities, (iv) University administrative activities, (v)
service to the profession. In item (iii) I am including activities that relate
to teaching, such as undergraduate advising. Which is important if you care
about Math Majors and the program overall. In item (v) I include editing
of journals, service on national committees, attending national meetings like
the January joint meeting of the AMS/MAA. In item (iv) I include anything
that the Dean or the Provost or even your Chair may ask you to do. In item
(ii) I include survey articles, book reviews, textbook writing, and any of the
other myriad writing activities that one may take on in this line of work.
The life of an academic Mathematician is rich and complex. You should
read this entire book to get a palpable feeling for all its many dimensions.

12
CHAPTER 1. I DIDN’T SIGN ON FOR THIS!
You must try to keep all the diﬀerent components in perspective, and make
some decisions about how to apportion your time. If you give all your time
to teaching, then you will not be able to develop your research proﬁle. If
you give all your time to research, then your other activities will suﬀer. You
want to be passionate about all the diﬀerent aspects of your life, and you
also want to give each its due.

CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
2.1
How to Teach
Whole books and many articles have been written on the art and practice
of good teaching (see, for instance, [KRA1], [CAS], [DAV], [GKM], [MOO],
[REZ], [ROSG],[THU], [TBJ], [ZUC], [RIS], [STSA]). It is a gentle and deli-
cate yoga, one that you will (if you are smart and dedicated) hone and perfect
for your entire professional life. Being a good teacher is like being a good
parent, or a good spouse, or a good friend. It is not something you are going
to learn and perfect just by reading a book. Certainly the book can give you
some useful pointers and help you to avoid pitfalls. But, in the end, you are
going to recognize that this is quite a personal activity and you will need to
develop your own values, your own goals, and your own methods.
The Carnegie Foundation has dedicated itself in large part to the develop-
ment and sustenance of teaching and teachers. It established the TIAA/CREF
retirement funds.1 It currently has a massive program to evaluate graduate
education nationwise. It sponsored the book [GTM]. One of the contribu-
tions of the Carnegie Foundation has been to advocate a re-thinking of the
way we evaluate professors and reward them. Another is to consider the
service roles of college and university faculty. It is also the case that the
Carnegie Foundation oﬀers grants for a variety of teaching activities.
The ﬁrst and primary piece of advice is to take your teaching seriously.
You may feel in your heart of hearts that the only thing that really matters
is research; ever since the advent of NSF grants about 56 years ago, that has
been the commonly held belief in our profession. But teaching is what pays
the bills. It is the most visible thing that we do, and it is the thing that
we do that others understand. Even the Dean has only the vaguest sense
of what your research life is about, but he/she certainly knows about your
teaching. Our reputation around campus hinges on our ability to teach. Our
credibility with the administration hinges on our ability to teach. So you are
doing your Department and your colleagues a service to do a (more than)
creditable job teaching.
Some teachers are jocular and are always clowning around with their
classes. Others are quite serious—nearly morose. Still other teachers make
the learning process a group activity; they are more “the guide on the side”
than the “sage on the stage.” All of these are valid and eﬀective didactic
1TIAA stands for “Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association” and CREF stands
for “College Retirement Equities Fund”. These two programs were created by Andrew
Carnegie to insure that America’s teachers were well cared for in their golden years.

2.2. HOW NOT TO TEACH
15
methods in the hands of the right individual. I like to tell a joke now and
then to my classes; self-deprecating humor seems to be particularly eﬀective.
But I never clown around. I am never morose. I am always the sage on the
stage, but I go to great lengths to encourage class participation. These are
my methods; they work for me. I cannot claim that they would work for
everyone.
It is certainly worthwhile to have a teaching mentor chosen from among
the senior faculty.
Any new teacher is bound to have scads of questions
about every aspect of managing a class, writing exams, preparing lectures on
tricky topics, handling graphics, using technology in the classroom, and any
number of other hot issues. It always helps to consult a more experienced
practitioner. It is also useful to brainstorm with your peers—other junior
faculty—about issues that have come up with your classes. Beginners ﬁnd it
comforting to learn that their colleagues at the same level have many of the
same issues and problems. And they can work them out together.
You do not want to develop the reputation in your new department of
someone who does teaching to the exclusion of all else—hangs out with the
students night and day, spends untold hours preparing extra lessons and
handouts, and so forth. Quite frankly, behavior such as this makes it appear
that you have no perspective on the job, that perhaps you are rather imma-
ture, and that you are simply reveling in the somewhat puerile pleasures of
hanging out with 18-year-old kids. Always keep in mind that teaching is a
very important part of what you do, but it is not the only thing. When tenure
time comes around, you will be evaluated for a variety of characteristics—not
just teaching. They need to all be in place.
2.2
How Not to Teach
There is a certain cachet to looking down on all teaching activities. If you are
in a large math department, you will have no trouble locating a subset of its
denizens who like to sit around bad-mouthing the students, bad-mouthing
the teaching assignments, bad-mouthing the University administration, and
generally painting a negative and miserable picture of the entire teaching
enterprise. This group always welcomes new members, and you will have no
trouble making a new group of friends rather quickly.
Well, it’s ﬁne to be friends with these people. As a general rule, you
should be friendly with everyone. But I would caution you against becom-

16
CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
ing an active member of this group. First of all, their mission is not con-
structive. Secondly, you want to make it your goal to be a good—if not
an outstanding—teacher. Third, you don’t want the powers-that-be in the
department to associate you with such negativity.
Like it or not, the welfare of the math department on campus, the way
it is perceived and the way it is funded, depends decisively on how math
department teaching is perceived. If people think that the mathematicians
are a bunch of out-to-lunch eggheads who can’t teach ice to Eskimos (and
often this is precisely how we are viewed, although usually unjustiﬁably so),
then the consequences will be grim.
You cannot—especially if you are a
new, young faculty member—turn the entire math department around and
transform everyone into a model teacher and citizen. What you can do is to
carry your own weight, be a role model for students and for other faculty,
show people that you are a team player who does his/her job to the best of
his/her ability.
I have written in detail about the nuts and bolts of good (and bad)
teaching in other places (see particularly [KRA1]). I shall not repeat all
those details here. Suﬃce it to say for now that you should take each of your
teaching assignments very seriously. Write a good syllabus. Prepare each
lecture or classroom lesson carefully and in detail. Practice your delivery
and make it shine. Get a colleague or friend to watch you teach and make
constructive remarks. It is easy to arrange, through the Teaching Center,
to have yourself videotaped. You will ﬁnd this to be a revealing and (on
occasion) terrifying experience. But it will tell you a lot about how you
come across.
Write neat, clear, coherent assignments and exams. Make yourself avail-
able to students. Be fair, reliable, and punctual. Students need to know that
they can depend on their instructor, and that the instructor will not surprise
them in nasty ways or pull the rug out from under them when least expected.
In this manner, if you are like a good parent to your students, then they will
respect you and forgive some of your other shortcomings.
It is quite easy to talk yourself into a downer over your teaching. While
it should be an uplifting and inspiring part of your life, it could turn into
a distinctly negative experience. Especially if it eats up too much of your
time, if the students turn out to be more of a pain than a pleasure, if your
classes oﬀer you more aggravations than rewards, if you feel that you are not
getting through to the students and instead are just wasting your time.
Looking back on the hundreds of classes that I’ve taught, it is easy to see

2.2. HOW NOT TO TEACH
17
how any of them could have gone south. I could have had an extremely unruly
and uncooperative class. [The fact is that it only takes a few troublemakers
to turn a whole class bad.] I could have been consistently unprepared, made
too many mistakes, given bad exams, and generally created a bad morale
situation. I could have been insensitive to the students’ level, the students’
needs, the students’ background and goals.
If you look over the last paragraph, you will see a few items that are
(in principle) the students’ fault and several items that are (indeed) the
instructor’s fault. This is no accident. When you teach a class, you are in
charge. It is your one-person show. You set the tone, you shape the class
and turn it (we hope) into an eﬀective working unit, and you see it through
to the end. There are a good many mistakes that you could make to prevent
this from happening eﬀectively, or at all.
The principle guiding rule when you teach a class is to treat people the
way that you want to be treated. This precept entails preparing your lessons
well, going to class with a good attitude, treating everyone with dignity and
respect, going out of your way to be helpful, and exerting every eﬀort to be
fair and evenhanded. None of these features should require a special eﬀort on
your part; if you are a committed teacher then they should all come rather
naturally. If instead the attitude that you bring to your teaching is that of a
gang member on a street corner then you will reap the predictable (negative)
reward.
I have learned a lot from watching Jay Leno and David Letterman on
television. Of course both those guys are very funny—which I am not. But
what is special about them from my point of view is that they are really
good at rolling with the punches. No matter what anybody says or does
on their shows, these hosts know just what to do to turn the situation to
their advantage. Everyone comes away feeling good, and as though he/she
has contributed something positive to the occasion. And that is just the
atmosphere that you should foster in your class. If a student asks a stupid
question, or accidentally dumps all his/her books on the ﬂoor to create a
disruption, or has a pizza delivered right in the middle of your brilliant lecture
on the mean value theorem, or if someone’s cell phone goes oﬀduring your
recitation on contour integration, turn the situation into a plus. Crack a
joke, or make a witty observation, or have a piece of the pizza yourself. Do
not endeavor to turn the transaction into some kind of morality play in which
you are God meting out eternal punishment. That is a sure way to alienate
everyone in the room and turn the class against you—not just for that day

18
CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
but for the rest of the term.
It is really a privilege to stand up in front of a group of young adults
for the duration of a semester or term and dole out your aggregate wisdom.
You can make the experience a real pleasure if you think about it in human
terms. You certainly have the math under control—that is what your Ph.D.
attests to. Now you must get the human side of the picture into focus.
Don’t be afraid to ask a senior mentor in your department for tips about
teaching.
Every school has its own special needs, special features of the
students, particular quirks of the curriculum. A seasoned veteran can help
to acquaint you with some of the particular wrinkles, and to come to grips
with the teaching life in your new department. This senior mentor will know
how teaching is judged in that particular department, and will be able to
guide you in developing the right skills and the right values.2
Don’t hesitate to consult the Chair, or the Vice-Chair for Undergraduate
Aﬀairs, or the Coordinator of Lower Division Teaching, for direction and
advice in dealing with particular questions or broader philosophical issues.
After all, this is your life that you are shaping. Your research is directed to
a very limited and recondite audience. But your teaching reputation will be
known to everyone.
Foreigners sometimes have trouble adjusting to our teaching system (see
Section 5.6). The nature of student preparation, and the way that the cur-
riculum is structured, is quite diﬀerent in Italy than in the United States.
Often a well-meaning instructor from Europe will stand in front of a calcu-
lus class pitching the material as though he/she were teaching real analysis
to juniors. Obviously this will not work. If you are a new instructor here
(in the U.S.), you will have to take special pains to acquaint yourself with
the curriculum and the students at your new school.
I can tell you that
the Department and the University administrations will be paying particular
attention to your teaching as they assess your advancement in the system.
2When I visited a particular Math Department in Australia, the Chair told me that
the freshmen at that school were all hooligans. They ran up and down the aisles, shouted
epithets in class, threw paper airplanes, and generally treated the classroom experience
like a brawl. He attributed this idiotic behavior to the fact that most of them still lived at
home, so they were highly immature. But the bottom line was that his new faculty had
to receive special training, and extra counseling, in how to handle these classes.

2.3. HOW TEACHING IS EVALUATED
19
2.3
How Teaching is Evaluated
Saunders Mac Lane used to say frequently—both in print and in public
utterances—that we all know quite well how to recognize and evaluate and
reward good research, but we have no idea how to recognize good teaching.
Teaching is more subjective. It should be left to the individual.
Whatever the merits of Mac Lane’s arguments, they ignore the realities
of the world we live in. Universities today are in intense competition for the
best students. Quality teaching speaks to the students and, perhaps more
importantly, speaks to their parents. Deans and Provosts and Chancellors
and, yes, even Boards of Trustees care deeply about teaching. If you want
to get tenure, if you want to get promoted, if you want to get good raises,
then you had better learn how to teach well. And I don’t just mean well
enough so that you can go home each evening with a clear conscience. While
most of the time you can get by with a clean teaching record that is better
than average, it is becoming more and more the case that the Administration
wants to be able to say that you are really a special teacher. I mean good
enough so that the students sing your praises, so that it is demonstrable that
you are an outstanding teacher. At my own university, this is a necessary
condition for promotion to Full Professor. The University’s view is that, by
this point, you’ve had plenty of years to practice the craft. Now you should
have it right.
It is one of the great mysteries of life to determine how to evaluate teach-
ing. I can tell you that, in my own experience, some of the teachers I had
who were textbook perfect (in terms of preparation and clarity and so forth)
had the least eﬀect on me while others who were chaotic and unprepared
had the most profound and longest term eﬀect on me. Some aspects of good
teaching are almost impossible to quantify or to evaluate in any objective
manner. Others are too trite to merit serious mention.
Surely the most common method to evaluate teaching is with student
teaching evaluations. The traditional method for handling this device was
for the instructor to hand out hard copy teaching evaluation forms at the end
of a class period towards the last days of the term. The students were to sit
right there and ﬁll them out. And a student volunteer was to collect them
and turn them in (this so that the instructor could not see them right away
and be unduly inﬂuenced in his/her subsequent grading of the course). Even
this simple device has undergone some development. At my own university
right now teaching evaluation is done OnLine. This has the advantage that

20
CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
there is no longer any question of objectivity, or of the instructor seeing the
evaluations before he/she should.3 And the results are compiled automati-
cally. One disadvantage is that the instructor is no longer distributing the
forms in class and asking students to complete them on the spot. So the
response rate is now much lower. Again, at my own university, the entire
student evaluation system for teaching used to be handled by the Student
Body. There was nothing wrong with this, and the system seemed relatively
fair and evenhanded. But it made some faculty nervous to think that a sys-
tem on which so much of our welfare (promotions, raises, etc.) depended was
not objectively institutionalized. Now, with the OnLine system, the student
teaching evaluation mechanism is about as objective as you could want.
There are other methods for evaluating teaching. When a candidate is up
for tenure or promotion, it is quite common for the Chair to send a couple of
faculty to observe the person’s teaching ﬁrst hand. The evaluator writes a few
paragraphs describing what he/she saw. This technique can be quite useful,
as faculty evaluators aren’t worried about a grade, or about their ability to
understand the material. So presumably they can be more objective. And
they speak of course from greater experience.
I have always thought that an ideal way to handle teaching evaluation
would be to have a professional psychologist sit down and talk to each student
privately. Such a person would know how to draw the student out, how to ask
the right questions, and how to elicit the information that was truly desired.
Unfortunately, such a system would be quite expensive and time-consuming,
so it is rarely used.
Many schools now have mid-term teaching evaluations, and these can be
quite useful. These are just between the students and the instructor (usually),
and no records are kept. But they are a way for the instructor to ﬁnd out—in
an objective sense—how the course is going, how students are responding to
the material, and what can be improved. Just so, many schools now have
mid-term grades for students. You would think that a student could tell that
he/she was ﬂunking a course. But often they cannot, or simply cannot take
oﬀtheir blinders to see. It is just the same with instructors. It is far too
easy for us to convince ourselves that we are doing a creditable job when in
fact there is plenty of room for improvement. Objective evaluation is the way
3When I taught at UCLA an Associate Professor of Social Studies got in a heap of
trouble for forging (i.e., cooking up from whole cloth) his teaching evaluations. His Teach-
ing Assistant turned him in. Seems that members of the Social Studies faculty had been
under considerable pressure to beef up their teaching reports. This was his solution.

2.4. HOW TO ESTABLISH A TEACHING REPUTATION
21
to get your hands on the necessary information.
One thing that I should stress—and this is an empirically veriﬁable fact—
is that self-evaluation is the least reliable form of assessment. You simply
cannot tell whether you are a good and eﬀective teacher. For one thing,
you are not objective.4 For another thing, you are already a master of the
material. And, lastly, you have no way of telling how well your presentations
and lessons are being received. The long and the short of it is that, if you
really want to develop and improve your teaching, then you must get third-
party input.

How to Establish a Teaching Reputation
If you are really an outstanding teacher—the sort of person whom students
talk about and recommend to their friends—then the word will spread. If
you are not yet tenured, then the Chair and the Executive Committee will be
monitoring your teaching dossier. They will ﬁgure out that you are someone
special. It would not be at all surprising if the Chair got some unsolicited
letters from students praising your abilities as a teacher and mentor. This
will be a great plus for your dossier.
Of course if you are an active participant in a seminar then your colleagues
will have ﬁrst-hand experience of your lecturing and expository skills. And
that will lead them to conclude that you know how to teach.
If you really want to plant your ﬂag then there are more proactive things
that you can do. You could start a teaching seminar. Most likely there are
a number of people in your department who care about teaching issues—
calculus reform, group learning, self-discovery, educational labs, and the
like—and want to discuss and develop them.
This could be a very posi-
tive contribution to Departmental life. Just be careful to run the seminar as
an intelligent exchange of information and ideas. You do nobody any good
if you try to come across as the know-it-all on teaching.
You could volunteer to be on the Undergraduate Committee, and get
involved in ongoing teaching and curricular projects in the Department. Once
you are more senior, you could volunteer to serve a stint as Vice-Chair for
4Almost everyone I know think that he/she is a great teacher. These people can stare
at a handful of really negative teaching evaltuations and say, “The students don’t really
know what they are talking about. They wouldn’t know a good teacher if they saw one.
I am really a talented pedant. Just look at all the great stuﬀI show them.”

CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
Undergraduate Studies. Or perhaps as Coordinator of the Lower Division
Curriculum (although this could be a staﬀposition, and not for you).
You should be aware as you do these things that you will garner the rep-
utation that you deserve. If you spend all your time on teaching activities—
which is certainly a valid and worthwhile thing to do—then your colleagues
will peg you as a “teaching type.” This is something you can be proud of,
and you should not shirk it. But one corollary could be that when there are
discussions of research or hiring issues then your opinion will not carry as
much weight as it once did.
I certainly know perfectly ﬁne mathematicians—quite a number of them
in fact—who at a certain point in their careers said to themselves, “Things
have changed. I no longer have an NSF research grant. I don’t receive the
speaking invitations that I once enjoyed. The invitations to conferences are
fewer and further between. And I now have a more mature perspective. I feel
that I’ve made my research contribution. I have ﬁfty papers on MathSciNet,
and that is an adequate contribution for a lifetime. I have now developed an
interest in teaching and administrative issues, and that is how I am going to
spend my time.” This is great, and is certainly a thoughtful and (potentially)
productive position to take. It beats the heck out of spending your time
staring at the wall wailing “Woe is me.” There is plenty of grant money
available for teaching and administrative activities (probably more than for
research in pure mathematics). And your institution will appreciate your
eﬀorts.
For the fact is that many, if not most, universities take an attitude quite
similar to the one just enunciated for an individual mathematician. When
you are working your way through the ranks, you are supposed to be a ﬁre-
in-the-guts researcher. You should be obsessed by the research life. But, as
you grow older, your focus will change. The institution will ask more service
from you. Your interests will broaden. You will realize that teaching and
research coexists peacefully, and support each other. You will be able to put
an emphasis on both aspects of your eﬀorts. As a result, you will want to
make diﬀerent types of contributions. Everyone will respect that decision,
and many will appreciate it.
The teaching life is a good life, and you should give it its due.
You
are much better oﬀhaving a positive teaching reputation than the opposite.
Teaching and research are not disjoint activities, and you should not perceive
them as such.

2.5. CHOOSING A TEXTBOOK
23
2.5
Choosing a Textbook
Selecting a textbook for your course can be a pleasure or a pain. If you
are teaching calculus then there are a good many choices. And there are
interesting diﬀerences among the diﬀerent calculus books. Some are in the
teaching reform style and some are in the traditional style. Some emphasize
computing and some emphasize applications. There is even a calculus book
that is in the style of a comic book (see [SWJ]). If you are teaching a course
on Arakelov theory then there is only one book, and it is quite recondite.
Few people can read it.
Many courses fall in between. There will only be a handful of texts and
you may not like any of them. Of course that would be a good excuse to
write your own text (see Section 5.1). But that road is not for everyone.5 You
could also cobble something together from several textbooks, but be careful.
It is technically illegal, because of copyright law, to make photocopies of
parts of several books and put them together as a text for your students—it
is especially illegal if you sell it to your students. People often get away with
abuses of the copyright law, especially at colleges and universities. But there
was a big scandal at a major New York University a few years ago because
they had been routinely been compiling a reader for a basic English course
by photocopying parts of various books and having the local photocopy shop
bind it together and sell it as a text. The publishers really went after the
school, and they were right. They won.
You also have to be careful of your department. The only letter of repri-
mand in my otherwise pristine personnel ﬁle chides me for having the nerve
to choose my own calculus text. I had been unaware that calculus texts in
my department were chosen by a committee, and everyone had to use the
chosen text.
These days most major publishers have sales representatives, and these
charming young people will use all their wiles to convince you to adopt their
book. Particularly if you are in charge of the calculus course at a big state
university, your choice of text could be a 1500-unit adoption. That would be
5When Walter Rudin was a Moore Instructor at M.I.T. he had to teach undergraduate
real analysis. He quickly realized that there was no text. Of course this was in the late
1940s—a diﬀerent age. People had been in the habit of learning real analysis—and many
other mathematical subjects—from sets of notes that circulated privately. So he decided to
write a text. And it turned into one of the great classics of twentieth century mathematical
writing. Rudin’s Principles of Mathematical Analysis later won a Steele Prize.

24
CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
a big sale for any calculus rep, and they could oﬀer all sorts of inducements
to get you to swing their way. Taking you out to lunch is a common enough
ploy, and that is probably harmless enough. But another trick is to oﬀer you
work to review manuscripts for the publisher, and to pay you an honorarium
for the work that is far above the going rate ($2,000 let’s say instead of $200).
Without anything being said, everyone is supposed to understand that this
is a bribe.
There are also some calculus publishers today that will actually bribe a
Math Department to adopt its book. How can they get away with this? It’s
actually ridiculously easy. It won’t work at Harvard or Princeton, but imag-
ine the publisher approaching the Math Department at a large, underfunded
state institution, taking the Chair to dinner, and saying, “We’d like to give
your department a $25,000 scholarly fund for the development of your mathe-
matics program. You can use this to send students on trips, or buy computer
equipment, or anything you like. Of course we see part of the development
of your scholarly program as being the adoption of our textbook . . . ” And
so it goes.
The book that you choose for a class can really aﬀect the way that the
course will go. If the text is full of errors, or if the exercise sets are poorly
designed, or if the explanations are confusing and misleading, then you will
ﬁnd yourself spending a disproportionate amount of time compensating for
the shortcomings of your textbook. This is really counterproductive, and can
create a very negative morale in your class. I have actually known instruc-
tors who have said to their class, “This text is so bad that I am going to
recommend that we abandon it and adopt another.” This in mid-semester!
Of course that creates problems of its own, as many students cannot aﬀord
to buy another textbook.
The lesson here is that you want to be careful and meticulous in adopting
a book. You don’t really know a text until you’ve used it, and lived with the
examples and the homework problems and the applications. But you can ask
a more experienced colleague to recommend a text, you can consult Internet
chat rooms (or even Amazon) to read reviews. The American Mathematical
Monthly carries reviews of many new texts. The more information you have,
the better oﬀyou will be.

2.6. TEACHING COOPERATIVELY
25
2.6
Teaching Cooperatively
At a large state university, the following scenario for calculus is quite com-
mon: In the Fall Semester, there are 1500 students. These are divided into
ﬁve large lectures of 300, each taught by a Professor. Then there are about 50
problems sections, each taught by a Graduate Teaching Assistant (or T.A.).
You can see that this is a situation that requires considerable management
and oversight. It is common to make a Professor—usually one of the ﬁve
who is giving the lectures—in charge of the whole course.
Of course the ﬁve Professors will meet regularly—perhaps once per week—
to discuss issues connected with the course. These could include
• management of the TAs
• construction and scheduling of the exams
• proctoring of the exams
• grading issues (for both homework and exams)
• pacing of the course, order of topics, reaching of milestones on key dates
• overall grading policies
• coordination of oﬃce hours
• coordination with the math lab (if there is one)
This is another opportunity for you to interact with your colleagues in a
constructive meeting of minds to tackle a common task. It is really not all
that pleasant, but you can make it congenial and productive. After all, you
all have a common job and a common goal. It is in your best interest to work
together to make this come out as fruitfully as possible.
It is really best if the ﬁve lectures stick to a rigid syllabus and lesson
plan, so that on any given day they are all teaching the same thing. That
way if a student misses a class then he/she can go to a diﬀerent lecture and
not fall behind. Also the lecturers will all get to the same milestones at the
same time so that they are all ready to give just the same midterm. This all
requires a bit of discipline, but it is not hard and the payoﬀis considerable.
There are beneﬁts that you can oﬀer the students in this otherwise trying
learning situation. You can tell students that they are welcome at any pro-
fessor’s oﬃce hour. This will be well received, and not increase your business

26
CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
appreciably. Student can have a choice of several review sessions to attend
when exam time comes around. They can attend several diﬀerent recitation
sessions if they wish to do so.
Typically the ﬁve professors in a situation like this will have a common
syllabus, give common exams, and coordinate their grading. If this is done
right it can save labor for everyone. In addition, you can learn from each
other in the process. You should of course expend every eﬀort to get along
with your colleagues here, to see their point of view, to work together to
make everyone’s life easier. This is obviously in everyone’s best interest.
2.7
Media
Today it sometimes seems as though media control our lives—and we are not
talking here about the CBS nightly news, but rather about computer and
other hardware media. Especially because communication (in both oral and
written form) is so important to our profession, we must deal with media.
In the old days, we would present our lectures with chalk at a board and
do our writing with a pen on paper. If the writing was to be ultimately
published, then someone else would type it up, typeset it, copy edit it, and
get it into print. Today many lectures are given with PowerPoint® or some
variant thereof. Today many of the publishing functions are performed by
the author using electronic methodology. It is a dramatic change that has
impacted all our lives.
In the old days, if you gave a lecture (with chalk on a board) and some-
body missed it then your response was likely to be, “Sorry you missed my
lecture. Maybe you can catch it another time. I could give you a copy of
my notes if you wish.” Of course, like as not, the notes only gave a sketchy
preview (in semi-legible form) of what the lecture really was about. And the
notes would not include any graphics. So the end of the story is that the
person who missed the lecture indeed missed out. And won’t be able to make
it up (although perhaps he/she could borrow another student’s notes).
The next step in the evolution of presentation technology was to use
either an opaque projector (or epidioscope) or an overhead projector. Here
an opaque projector projects (onto a screen) from a printed page or book.
An overhead projector projects from transparent slides. Advantages of this
medium are several:
• Your materials are displayed on a large screen, hence visible to a large

2.7. MEDIA
27
audience.
• Complicated graphics and tedious tables of data can be prepared in
advance on slides.
• Everything looks (in principle) quite polished.
• You will have your presentation in your archive to use on another oc-
casion.
• You can share your lecture materials with people who missed the formal
presentation.
There are also several disadvantages:
• It requires considerable extra time to prepare slides in advance.
• The use of a machine like this puts a psychological barrier between
yourself and your audience.
Some of the intimacy of a chalkboard
presentation is lost.
• There is a temptation to put too much material on each slide. You
must learn to design slides eﬀectively.
• You have to re-train yourself to pace a slide-driven lecture properly.
Since everything is written out in advance, there is a great temptation
to go too quickly.
• The use of slides tends to lock you into a linear order of presentation.
With chalk at a board, you have more control. You can jump around,
restructure the talk in response to a question from the audience, pursue
a digression. With slides this is more diﬃcult. As a result, a slide
presentation could be less lively.
The truly modern way to prepare a presentation is with PowerPoint. This
Microsoft product creates a computer ﬁle with individual frames to project
onto a screen. You cycle through the frames by hitting the right-arrow key
on the computer keyboard, or by using a handheld remote. PowerPoint is
quite a ﬂexible and powerful tool. It allows you to include color, videos,
animated graphics, sound, and many other media devices.
Certainly for
business presentations it is often the way to go. When I was Chair of my

28
CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
Department, I always felt that a presentation to the Dean should be done in
PowerPoint.
Some people are critical of PowerPoint (see, for instance, [TUF]). It can
be too slick, it can distance you from your audience, it can be superﬁcial. But,
like any tool, it can be eﬀective when used well and in the proper context.
It is a bit tricky to incorporate sophisticated mathematics into PowerPoint.
Some mathematicians prefer to use the freeware product Beamer.® The Ger-
man creation Beamer is a LATEX package that produces a *.pdf ﬁle that has
individual frames, just like PowerPoint. And Beamer has much of the func-
tionality of PowerPoint—animated graphics, sound, color, and so forth—but
it also allows you to include any mathematics that can be rendered in TEX.
Of course one of the great advantages to preparing your lectures electron-
ically is that they are then quite portable. You can put them on the Web,
you can send them to friends, you can even publish them. You still have
to worry—quite a lot, actually—about the design of each frame, and about
your pacing. But this is part of today’s world, and if you are interested then
you will do it.
Of course publishing these days is a whole new ballgame. When I was an
Assistant Professor at UCLA the Department had three full-time manuscript
typists. I would write my research paper by hand in ink on paper and humbly
submit it to the crew. One of them would labor away—for up to a week!—to
type up the manuscript. This was done on an IBM Selectric® typewriter—
using special type balls (or elements) for all the special symbols. And then
the project would be given to me for prooﬁng. An indication of how primitive
things were then (around 1975), and how sophisticated we are now, is the
form in which the proofs were given to me.
You would think that the typist would have given me a photocopy of
my paper to proofread, and that he/she would retain the original typescript
for safekeeping.
Thus I would make my edits and corrections in red ink
on the photocopy. But no. In point of fact the typist would give me the
original typescript with a translucent overlay clipped to each sheet. Then
I was provided with a special red wax pen to mark the overlays with my
corrections.6
You see, in those days photocopying was still considered to
be something of a luxury. So the overlay system was UCLA’s attempt at
6You can imagine that some faculty, being not gifted at following instructions, would
lift the overlays and mark with the wax pen on the original typed pages. This did not
please the typists.

2.7. MEDIA
29
economy.
Of course now the world has changed dramatically. Most departments
no longer have manuscript typists. The majority of mathematicians prepare
their own manuscripts—even book manuscripts—in TEX. Advantages of this
new system are
• The author now has complete control over layout, content, and accu-
racy.
• The author can, if he/she wishes, provide graphics using Adobe
Illustrator® or Corel DRAW®or xfig.
• The author retains the electronic ﬁles and can post them (or a derivative
ﬁle such as a *.pdf ﬁle) on the Web.
• The author can submit his/her paper directly to a journal or a book
publisher by either sending the *.pdf ﬁle as an e-mail attachment or
posting it on a Web site. Many times people will ﬁrst submit their work
to the preprint server arXiv. In that case submission is performed in
TEX. With many journals you can submit a paper just by providing a
pointer to the arXiv posting.
There are also disadvantages to the new system. Some of these are:
• The mathematician is now required to learn skills (TEX, Adobe
Illustrator, various operating system maneuvers) that used to be
relegated to staﬀ.
• The mathematician must learn various operating system commands
and techniques in order to be able to manipulate TEX source, graphics,
and other ﬁles to get the desired (uniﬁed) result.
• The mathematician must spend a lot of time typing.
• The mathematician must maintain an electronic proﬁle on line.
• The mathematician may have to learn HTML and how to maintain a
Web page.
This last point is perhaps worth some discussion. These days most of us
have a personal Web page. That page commonly includes:

30
CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
• a version of the CV
• courses taught
• professional aﬃliations
• national committee service
• conferences being organized
• links to newsgroups and chat rooms.
• a list of publications and preprints
• links to those publications and preprints
This new facet of life has many pluses:7 It is now much easier to keep up with
what other mathematicians are doing. If you want to get a new preprint, it
is quite natural and pleasant to go to the author’s Web page and grab it.
But a negative is that the progenitor must spend time maintaining his/her
Web page. Ideally one should update the Web page once per week. One
should update the OnLine CV once every few months. And one should keep
the posted preprints and papers current. It’s a lot of extra work, and time-
consuming.
2.8
Research
The role of research in your life is discussed in detail in Chapter 4. But let me
say point blank that, if you are at a research university—what we in the trade
call a Group I school8—then research is supposed to be a big part of your life.
7Many mathematicians, indeed many people, have an extensive component of their
Web page that is about their personal lives. There can be photos of the family, photos
of hiking trips, material about the oﬀspring’s virtuosity on the violin, pages about the
family pets, extensive philosophical musings or blogs, and so forth. My personal view is
that your Math Department Web page is a business document, and should be treated and
developed as such. Others may diﬀer.
8Pure Math Departments are classiﬁed as Group I, Group II, or Group III. Each group
has 50 schools listed in it. The Group I schools are the research departments—judging
from the number of Ph.D. students produced per annum and the number of papers written
and the number of grants and awards earned. There is more discussion of this topic in
[KRA3].

2.9. COMMITTEE SERVICE
31
It would not be at all unreasonable if half of your professional time is spent
on research—either reading, or engaging in professional correspondence, or
thinking, or calculating, or going to conferences or seminars, or applying
for grants, or writing. At other schools, where there is a greater emphasis
on teaching and service, the amount of time spent on research will be less.
Certainly to get tenure you will have to have a track record in scholarly
publishing. As you rise through the ranks you will ﬁnd that more and more
of your time is taken by departmental work and teaching duties, and your
scholarly life will take a back seat to those activities.
If you work at an industrial job, or at a government research facility, then
the only thing that you will do is “research.” Generally speaking it will not
be research of the academic sort. Such operations often work on government
contracts, and there are very speciﬁc problems to solve or technologies to
develop.9 You will still be developing new ideas, and charting new paths.
But it will often be security work so that you cannot share it or publish it or
get credit for it. And often you will be applying known mathematical ideas
to technological questions in a new way. You will not be developing new
mathematics as such.
2.9
Committee Service
Many departments will reduce the service duties of a young (non-tenured)
faculty member. The view is that an Assistant Professor should be devoting
his/her non-teaching energies to developing a research program and getting
grants. Committee duties are of less importance, and can be carried by the
senior faculty. But some Math Departments pay more attention to infras-
tructure, and will want to get you involved in departmental life right away.
And you will then have a fair portion of committee work.
Take this work seriously. Show up punctually for meetings and be pre-
pared. If there is reading material for a meeting, be sure to read it and
understand it. Ask questions of someone if you don’t. It is entirely possi-
ble that a handout distributed for a meeting presupposes some knowledge
9A notable exception to this paradigm is the Microsoft Mathematics Theory Group.
This remarkable organization in Redmond, Washington or Mountain View, California
employs quite a number of distinguished mathematicians, and they are given free reign to
study whatever they wish. And they can publish anything they like. This is Bill Gates’s
gift to the mathematics world.

32
CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
of departmental history or of past policies. Of course you have no way of
knowing these things. You will have to ask someone if you are to participate
meaningfully in the discussions.
Often committee work will involve homework. You may be asked to re-
search a situation—visit with members of the Physics Department and ﬁnd
out about certain calculus needs, for example—and then write a brief re-
port. Take these duties—even though they may seem tedious and tiresome—
seriously. It is actually fun to become acquainted with members of other
departments. And you could learn something useful in the process.
Try to stay awake during commitee meetings. Try to participate mean-
ingfully. Say things that are intelligent and useful. If you have nothing useful
to say, then have the good sense to shut up.
You will probably not, as an Assistant Professor, be asked to chair a
committee. But if you are then you should agree to do so and you should
apply yourself to the task with aplomb and determination. Do the necessary
background reading. Talk to people and ﬁnd out the history that has led
to the formation of this committee. Get a clear picture of what the goals of
the committee are and how those goals might be met. Formulate a plan of
action. Meet individually with the members of the committee and generate
a working esprit de corps.
Your service on committees will be remembered, and will give your col-
leagues a sense of who you are and what you contribute to the general welfare.
Your service on the Textbook Committee, the Tenure and Promotion Com-
mittee, or the Colloquium Committee could have a lasting and salubrious
eﬀect, and could be remembered. It will certainly leave an impression. You
want that impression to be positive and lasting. It is not that you want to
be repeatedly saddled with tiresome committee duties. Rather, you want to
be respected and admired and valued as a colleague.
It might be mentioned that “service” is a broad concept. As you be-
come more senior in the profession, you may want to consider service to the
non-academic community. Often the local schools need help with their cur-
riculum, or in choosing a textbook. Many times a government agency wants
some help with a report, or with some analysis. I think it is important for
mathematicians to play a proactive role in society, and I hope that you agree.

2.10. A PANORAMA OF COMMITTEES
33
2.10
A Panorama of Committees
A Math Department typically will have quite a selection of committees. Most
of these serve a useful purpose; but many of these also exist in part in an
eﬀort to create the eﬀect of inclusiveness. Math Department members want
to feel that they are taking part in the operation. This doesn’t necessarily
mean that they want to put in the time; but they want to have a say.10
Anyway, a typical panoply of Departmental Committees looks something
like this:
• the Undergraduate Committee
• the Graduate Committee
• the Hiring Committee (there could be several of these)
• the Postdoc Committee
• the Endowed Lecture Series Committee (there will be several of these,
one for each series)
• the Library committee
• the Executive Committee
• the Calculus Committee
• the Computer Committee
• the Committee for the Major
• the Colloquium Committee
• the Committee for Faculty Raises
10There is one major university in Texas where the Chair twenty-ﬁve years ago did
everything himself. He had no committees at all. To give him credit, he became Chair at
a time when the department was still developing. It hadn’t really hit the top tier yet. And
he did a lot to bring it forth: there was never such a period of creative and hard-hitting
hiring as under this man’s stewardship. But I was visiting that department not long after
he stepped down. I was astonished to hear people gleefully say, “Gee, I’d like to go for a
beer with you, but I’ve got to go serve on the chalk committee.” People had really missed
their committee service, and now they were reveling in it.

34
CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
• the Teaching Committee
• the Statistics Committee (assuming that there is a Statistics group in
the Math Department)
Of course the Chair will form additional committees and taskforces as
the need arises. It is important not to have too many committees, as who
will serve on them? Nobody wants to be part of more than two or at most
three committees. The Chair will of course be an ex oﬃcio member of all
committees. He/she need not attend all the meetings, but he/she has the
right to do so if he/she wishes.
Of course all the committee Chairmen need to report to the Department
Chair regularly. This is how the Chair delegates duties and gets things done.
Sometimes a committee or taskforce will be assigned a speciﬁc task and
really not accomplish it. The Chair can then check that oﬀin his his book as
“attempted.” Surely some things will have been learned from the exercise,
and perhaps more can be accomplished the next time around.
2.11
University-Wide Committees
Part of your job as a university professor is to serve on committees that are
not subsets of the Math Department. These are sometimes called University-
wide committees. Examples of such committees are
• the library advisory committee
• the parking committee
• the science curriculum committee
• the bookstore advisory committee
• the teaching awards committee
• the tenure and promotion committee
Actually, the number of committees at a modern college or university can be
quite mind-boggling. You can hardly be aware of all of them. But you are
expected to do your part. Especially for promotion to full Professor, you will

2.12. WHAT GOES ON AT FACULTY MEETINGS?
35
be expected to have carried your weight in university service. This type of
committee work is a standard way to fulﬁll that role.
If you are really well known around campus, then you could be asked
straight out (by someone in the Administration) to serve on certain commit-
tees. For most of us, University-wide committee service is arranged through
the Department Chair, or perhaps through the Dean. My advice would be
to serve on at most one or two such committees in any given year. If you are
asked to serve on more, the shrewd thing to do is to simply point out that
your plate is already full and they should ask someone else.
Of course a committee is a committee is a committee and you will see
that University-wide committees have many of the same characteristics as
departmental committees. But there will be diﬀerences as well. Diﬀerent
departments have diﬀerent agendas, and diﬀerent academic modus operandi,
and diﬀerent value systems. I once served on the library advisory committee
and the question arose of whether new journals should circulate. A quite
distinguished Professor of German Literature on this committee said, “If a
new article in my subject area comes out then I can just stroll to the library
and scan the article in 20 minutes. I don’t need to check it out.” I was
ﬂabbergasted.
Imagine an important new article on your stuﬀappearing
in Acta Mathematica. Could you stroll to the library and scan it in twenty
minutes? You probably could not even ﬁgure out what it was about in twenty
minutes. I think that Herr Doktor Professor could see the puzzlement on my
face, so he said, “How is it with you, Steve?” My response was, “If a really
good new article in my ﬁeld comes out then I might want to spend a year
with it. So it is useful for me to be able to check out new journals.” I can
tell you that the Professor of German Literature was distinctly speechless.
It is really quite entertaining and enlightening to learn about other de-
partments and how they operate. After all, a good education consists of
exposure to diﬀerent modes of discourse. University-wide committee work is
one vehicle for such exposure, and it can broaden you in unexpected ways.
In any event, it’s part of your duty roster and you should expect to spend
some of your valuable time in this pursuit.
2.12
What Goes on at Faculty Meetings?
A faculty meeting is a gathering of equals. Fellow faculty are getting together
to make decisions about the path that the department will take in various

36
CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
matters.
It may be noted that some of these equals may be more equal
than others. Distinguished Chair Professors may have a louder voice than
ordinary citizens. Assistant Professors may not be heeded as carefully as
senior members of the Department. There may be a secretary at the meeting,
but everyone else will be faculty.
Of course the Chair will oﬃciate at the meeting. If the Chair is in fact a
Chairman (see Section 6.1), then he/she serves as a facilitator at the meeting.
The Chair in this case is no diﬀerent from anyone else—except that he/she
is standing in front of the room and perhaps he/she is likely to be better
informed. The faculty and the Chairman make decisions together, and the
Chairman implements them. If instead the Chair is a Head (again see Section
6.1 for this distinction) then in fact the Dean has elevated him/her to a quasi-
exalted position. The Head is actually answerable only to the Dean, and can
make decisions autonomously. The purpose of the faculty meeting in this
case is for the faculty to make recommendations to the Head. But the Head
makes the ﬁnal decisions and acts accordingly.
The primary vehicle for decision-making at faculty meetings is discussion.
If the subject at hand is something routine—like what brand of chalk to
buy—then the discussion is liable to be brief and peremptory.
Likely as
not the Chair will say, “We’ve looked into the chalk situation, here are the
major brands, here are their attributes, and here is what we recommend.”
Somebody, just to be heard, will say, “Is that the most cost-eﬀective chalk
that can be had?” The Chair will say, “Yes,” and a vote will be taken. The
entire matter can be dispatched in about ﬁve minutes.
More exciting is a decision regarding a tenure case. Or a major change
in the way that calculus will be taught.
Or a decision regarding hiring.
Any of these is liable to engender vigorous discussion, and perhaps heated
disagreement. People can get quite emotional over these matters, as they
will feel that these are decisions that can shape their lives. Those who have
weight to throw around may plainly heft it for all to see. An endowed Chair
Professor may remind others of his status. Some guy/gal who just got a $2
million grant may remind people that (by some yardstick) he/she is now the
most visible person in the Department. Others may cite their longevity or
their well-established record of departmental service.
A good faculty meeting can be exciting and envigorating. In the best of all
possible worlds, you will come away from it with a newfound respect for your
colleagues, and an uplifting feeling of decisions well made. Another possibility
(usually the exception) is that you will be angry with your colleagues and

2.13. SERVING AS A MENTOR
37
mad at the world.
Some decisions—the small ones—at a faculty meeting can be made by
consensus. Others will take a show of hands. The really delicate ones are
handled by secret ballot. If it is a question that will require considerable
discussion outside the meeting, then the Chair will instruct the group to get
the ballots into his/her secretary by Friday at noon (or another carefully
chosen time). Otherwise the ballots will be collected on the spot.
Sometimes there are just topics that require discussion, with no particular
decision to be made. In this instance the purpose is to inform people about
a matter that aﬀects everyone. Perhaps a change in the College curricu-
lum. Perhaps a change in University admission policies. Perhaps a proposed
change (by the Dean) in teaching loads (that is liable to engender some spir-
ited commentary!).
So a faculty meeting is also to inform and to focus on questions of the
day. Many departments will have a faculty meeting every month or two. The
smaller teaching departments tend to have faculty meetings every week, or
even more often. I know of some departments where the calculus exams are
written at faculty meetings. I know of a good Physics Department where
the entire department has lunch together every day—and attendance is ex-
pected. You might be excused for a dentist appointment, but generally you
are supposed to be there. And Departmental business—as well as physics—is
discussed.
Every department will have its own method of governance, its own rules
of operation, and its own customs. You will learn them soon in your new
working environment, and you will become accustomed to them. They are
part of your life, and they are something you will want to be a part of.
2.13
Serving as a Mentor
Of course if you are just a tyro at the job—whether it is academic or in-
dustrial or government or other—then it is not likely that you will be put
into a mentoring role right away. This will come later in your career. Some
departments have a formal mechanism for assigning a senior faculty mentor
to each new junior faculty person. Many others do not, and your mentoring
experiences will just come about through ordinary social intercourse.
My own view is that the mathematics profession has been somewhat
derelict in providing adequate mentoring for the beginning members of our

38
CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
tribe. If you are faced with an opportunity to mentor then you should em-
brace it and do what good you can. You will not get a lot of brownie points
for being a good mentor; the reward is in the satisfaction of helping some-
one along (just as you would have appreciated being helped along). It is
worthwhile, and I recommend that you do it.
Good mentoring requires patience, perspective, fairness, and sound judg-
ment. Many people will take a mentoring transaction as an opportunity to
criticize and rat out their colleagues.
This is tempting, but a dreadfully
bad idea. First of all, you should never wash your dirty laundry in public.
Secondly, it makes you look cheap and unprofessional to behave in such a
manner. Thirdly, you would not want your colleagues talking about you in
such a fashion; so show the same courtesy in reverse.
What might a young person ask of you as a mentor? Some sample topics
are:
• How do I organize my new class? What preparation (apart from putting
together my lectures) need I do? How do I write exams? How do I grade
fairly? How do I manage my TAs?
• How do I jump-start my research career? How do I ﬁnd good problems
to work on? With whom should I try to collaborate?
• Where should I publish my work? How do I choose a journal? What
is the procedure for submission of an article? How long should I wait
to hear a decision?
• Where should I apply for grants? How do I apply? Do I do so alone or
with others? What agencies will be most receptive to my ministrations?
• Should I go to a lot of conferences? Is this a good use of my time?
Should I try to speak at conferences?
• Is it useful to go to the annual AMS/MAA meeting in January?
You get the idea. Some of these you can answer right oﬀthe top of your
head, and others you will have to ponder before you can say anything useful.
You want to try to help, as the young person who approached you probably
really needs the help. In a sense it is part of your professional duty to do so.

2.14. UNDERGRADUATE ADVISING
39
2.14
Undergraduate Advising
Part of your job as a Math Professor is to be an advisor or counselor to
some undergraduates. Usually there are people in the University Adminis-
tration building who are full-time professional counselors, and they will do a
certain amount of student advising, especially with Freshmen and with stu-
dents who are having academic diﬃculties. But somebody has to advise the
Math Majors, and that somebody had better be someone with some technical
knowledge.
Often advising consists in just reading the University or College Catalog
a little more patiently and a little more carefully than the student. But if
you are going to be an eﬀective advisor then you need to take a few minutes
to acquaint yourself with the breadth requirements, the pre-requisites for the
major, the diﬀerent versions of the major that are in place, and what sorts
of courses are required for each ﬂavor of the major.
Of course a bright student can indeed read the Catalog and the Course
Guide just as well as you can. So often the sort of advice that a student
will want will be, “Should I take this course or that course?” Or “Should
I take this instructor or that instructor?” You are probably well-equipped
to answer either of those queries, but you should endeavor to be diplomatic
with the latter.
Another fairly common type of question is, “The major seems to require
this computer science course, but I would like to substitute this other course
instead. I never have felt competent to answer some questions, nor did I feel
empowered to make such a judgment. So I would refer the student to the
Vice-Chair for Undergraduate Studies. This action is appropriate for some
other sticky questions as well, especially ones where a policy decision needs
to be made.
Generally speaking a student who is your advisee is required to see you
at the time, or just before, he/she registers for classes. And then you are
required to provide a signature—or perhaps click a box OnLine—so that the
registration can go through.
On occasion—and you can only hope that these will be rare occasions—
student advisees will bring your their personal problems. These could be
troubles with loved ones, or parents, or partners or roommates. They could
be problems with drugs, or problems with the law, or medical diﬃculties.
This is dangerous territory, and I would advise you to refer the student to
a professional counselor—there are plenty of them in the Administration

40
CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
building, and this is why they were hired.
One rewarding and entertaining aspect of undergraduate advising occurs
when you are asked to direct an Honors Thesis. Then you are usually dealing
with a bright and capable student with many interests. You job is to help
the student pick a good topic, give him/her some things to read, and then
answer questions as the student works through the material. Of course you
are obliged to read the thesis and make editorial comments, and ultimately
you will be required to approve it. But it usually satisfying and educational
and I recommend that you give it a try.
2.15
Graduate Advising
I discuss Ph.D. dissertation advising elsewhere in this book, and see also
[KRA3]. But there are other types of graduate student advising.
Sometimes students who are struggling with the quals seek advice. Gen-
erally speaking, it is the job of the Vice-Chair for Graduate Studies to handle
such matters, but you may be called upon because of your area of expertise.
Sometimes you can give some tips on what to study, or how to study, or how
to manage one’s time.
I have had graduate students—with whom I was friendly for other reasons—
seek out advice because they were having personal or ﬁnancial diﬃculties and
were afraid they were going to have to drop out of the program. I was happy
to be able to provide a little guidance, and to oﬀer some suggestions and
alternative.
I have mentioned elsewhere in this tract that my own university has a
system of two oral presentations that each graduate student must perform—
this is after the quals and before the thesis. The student will have a faculty
mentor for each presentation. This is a great opportunity to get to know a
student who might become your Ph.D. student, and it is usually a pleasant
experience.
Generally speaking your position as a Professor makes you a sort of cul-
tural icon and you could be asked advice by almost anyone about almost
anything. I have been phoned up and asked questions (by the Electoral Of-
ﬁce) about designing ballots and counting votes. I have been asked questions
(by lawyers) about the probability of one hive of bees stinging a victim rather
than some other hive of bees stinging that same victim. I have been asked
advice about making machine dies of a particular geometric shape. I have

2.16. YOUR ROLE IN THE PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES
41
been asked advice by the Chief of Campus Police about how to put together
the statistics for a report he was writing. I have been asked by the geography
department how to calculate areas on a large map. And students have asked
me almost any question you can think of about almost any topic you can
think of. It is one of the more recreational parts of the job.
2.16
Your Role in The Professional Societies
I have a rather stodgy view in this matter.
The professional societies—
the American Mathematical Society (AMS), the Mathematical Association
of America (MAA), the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics
(SIAM), American Women in Mathematics (AWM), the National Associ-
ation of Mathematicians (NAM), the Society for Advancement of Chicanos
and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), and many others—are essential
to what we do, and they help us to do it. The AMS, for example, holds many
important conferences (the January joint meeting with the MAA is perhaps
the biggest), publishes many ﬁne book series, publishes important scholarly
journals, sponsors and develops MathSciNet, and develops many professional
tools to help people to apply for jobs and to develop their professional lives.
The MAA concentrates on teaching and dissemination issues. SIAM is the
organization for people who care about applications of mathematics. SAC-
NAS endeavors to meet the needs of mathematicians who are members of
under-represented societal groups. NAM concentrates on professional needs
of African Americans.
I feel strongly that you, a budding mathematician, should belong to one or
more of these professional societies. Membership is relatively inexpensive—
about $160 per annum (in fact AMS dues are reduced for the ﬁrst few years),
or the cost of taking your spouse out for a nice dinner. And the beneﬁts are
considerable. Plus it is important that you be part of the infrastructure of
the profession. Also you will receive in the mail useful periodicals that will
help you to keep up with professonal developments. Finally, the professional
societies can serve as a touchstone for helping you to network with your peers.
It is an observed fact that young mathematicians these days have a de-
creased interest in belonging to the professional societies. This is too bad; it
is their loss as well as ours. It is the upcoming generation that will keep the
societies going. The AMS and the MAA are each about 100 years old (SIAM
and AWM and SACNAS and NAM are considerably younger), and it is no

42
CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
accident that American mathematics rose to considerable world prominence
during those 100 years. The professional societies played a notable role in
the process, and they will continue to do so as we move into the twenty-ﬁrst
century.
2.17
Translators
One important service that a mathematician can provide to the profession
is as a translator. It has come about, even during my time as an academic,
that English has become the predominant language in the subject. Even the
French—who tend to be quite chauvinistic about their lovely language—tend
to publish their articles in English these days. It has been a tradition in good
graduate programs to require all Ph.D. candidates to show proﬁciency in two
languages—usually chosen from among French, German, and Russian. But
even that venerable habitude is falling by the wayside.
There are automatic OnLine translators—Google has one—that one can
use for free to “translate” from almost any language to almost any other.
These tools do not work very well, and they are particularly poor with techni-
cal languages like mathematics. You cannot depend on a computer translator
to help you read a math article.
Certainly there are a number of journals these days—journals which are
basically “English” journals—that will accept papers in French or German.
There is one journal that will accept papers in Latin, and another that will
take papers in Esperanto. The fact remains, however, that English is now
the norm.
The greatest demand for translating in our discipline—at least in modern
times—has been for Russian articles. But in the late 1980s a good many
Russians left the former Soviet Union and moved to the West. Most of these
scientists now publish in English.
So why is there any need for translation of mathematics?
There are
actually several:
• There are still articles in Russian and Japanese and other exotic lan-
guages that one wants to read.
• If you publish a good book—one that students will want to read—in
your native tongue then students in other countries will probably want
to read it too. And, though they learn English in school, they are really

2.18. IS MATHEMATICS JUST A SERVICE DEPARTMENT?
43
not all that comfortable with it. They would like a text in their native
language.11
• Publishers are in the business of selling books, and arranging for a
translation is often in their best interest.
The long and the short of it then is that publishers will need translators.
These will include book publishers and journal publishers and professional
societies. They will pay people to do the translating. Usually they want a
Ph.D. mathematician for the job, because they don’t just want the words
translated—they want the sense translated. Mathematics is subtle. Just
for example, the use of “not” and of negative statements is quite delicate
and must be handled properly. Deﬁnitions must be just right. Proofs must
cohere. So a properly trained person must do the translating.
The trouble is that the budget for publishing advanced math books is
slim. A popular text might sell 200,000 copies and the publisher’s proﬁt on
each unit (after the initial 2,000, which pays for the ﬁxed costs) is about $20,
so there is plenty of cash around for translating or anything else the publisher
might want to do. But an advanced math book might sell only 1000 or fewer
copies. After the ﬁxed costs (typesetting, overhead, etc.) are covered, the
proﬁts are slim. So publishers think of translation as really a luxury. And
what they can pay for this service borders on paltry. A publisher will oﬀer
a few thousand dollars to translate a book. The AMS pays $15 or $20 per
page for journal translation. If you are the translator, and you translate this
remuneration into dollars per hour, you will not end up dancing in the street.
Compared to what your attorney or your physician is paid, this is pretty slim
pickings. If you do translation, you are doing it mainly as a service to the
profession.
2.18
Is Mathematics Just a Service Depart-
ment?
It is a sad but true fact that many administrators, when they think of the
Math Department, have as their ﬁrst thought that, “Oh, yeah. Those are the
11I still recall when my graduate algebra professor adopted Bourbaki’s book—in French,
of course—for our text. I was so exasperated that I refused to read it. This was probably
the worst math course that I ever experienced.

44
CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
guys who teach calculus.” You can bet that their primary consideration is
not, “Oh yeah, those are the guys who proved the Bieberbach Conjecture.”
Mathematics plays a central and vital role in undergraduate education
on campus. We, as the key players in this operation, should be well aware
of this fact and capitalize on it. Typically Mathematics teaches more un-
dergraduate student hours than any other department. Also we teach more
students who don’t want to be there than any other department. Students in
Freshman Chemistry may hate the damned course, but they certainly know
why they have to learn Chemistry (usually they are Chem majors or pre-
meds or Chemical Engineering majors). Students in an Education course are
almost all Education majors, so they certainly do not question their curricu-
lum. Students in eighteenth century French literature are probably there by
choice. In many majors, Math is a requirement just to make the curriculum
more diﬃcult; it serves no practical purpose in the subject matter.
In addition to its key role in the curriculum Mathematics is also a critical
part of modern technology. Most aspects of computer construction and de-
sign are mathematical. Ditto for the main ideas in cryptography, in medical
imaging, and in many other hot ﬁelds. Calculus is a vital part of physics,
economics, and population dynamics. Statistics is central to social science,
engineering, and physics. Probability is the language of quantum mechan-
ics, the social sciences, and ﬁnance. Discrete mathematics plays a vital role
in information technology, biology, counting theory, and many other ﬁelds.
Mathematicians make an essential contribution to the quality of life in this
country. We are scholars of considerable gravitas.
Many departments—such as physics and engineering—require their stu-
dents to take Mathematics because they see their subjects as mathematical.
A knowledge of Mathematics is key to understanding modern Physics (thanks
to Isaac Newton). But Mathematics is special because many of the students
(in calculus let’s say) are there because their Department requires it—but
they require it not because they value Mathematics intrinsically, but because
they want to use the course as a ﬁlter. They recognize the intellectual rigor
of Mathematics, and they ﬁgure that a student who cannot pass Freshman
Calculus should certainly not be in the ursing program, or not be a pre-Med.
You can imagine, and even if you can’t imagine it you will soon experience
it ﬁrsthand, that this leads to a lot of disgruntled calculus students who ask
questions like “What is all this stuﬀgood for?”
The Mathematics Department teaches a great many students, and it
teaches a great many students who would certainly rather be doing some-

2.18. IS MATHEMATICS JUST A SERVICE DEPARTMENT?
45
thing else. And who do not really understand, in a visceral sense, why they
are being required to take Mathematics. This is a diﬃcult audience to face,
but it is what we must do as Mathematics professionals.
So, yes, we are a service department. We give great service to the College,
and to the University. But we are much more. We are at the forefront of
modern scholarly thought. We are serious researchers engaged in important
investigations. We have research grants, we receive invitations from all over
the world, we are widely published, and we give considerable service to the
mathematics and science professions. We are recognized academicians with
worldwide reputations. We are an important part of the professoriate, ones
who make notable contributions in many dimensions of the discipline.
Math is part of the traditional core curriculum at a college or university.
It is one of the standard “three ‘R’s.” It is one of the Liberal Arts of a
classical education. Most people arrive at college or the university having
already seen quite a lot of Math in their lives. Sad to say, many have already
decided that they really don’t like Math. This is the audience that we face.
When the Math Department Chair meets with the Dean to discuss teach-
ing issues, he/she may try to convey some of the information in the preceding
several paragraphs. And he/she may or may not succeed. Deans do not like
to hear (what they perceive as) excuses. What the Dean wants is results.
If the Dean holds in his/her hand statistics that seem to show that Math
Department teaching evaluations average distinctly lower than English De-
partment teaching evaluations, then he/she is going to want to know why.
And he/she will not be receptive to an answer like, “English is easy but Math
is hard.” Or, “The English Department grades easier than the Math Depart-
ment.” or “The students in English like English and want to be taking the
course. The students in Math are there mostly under duress.”
It is certainly true that the typical professional Mathematician has re-
ceived little if any training to be a teacher. I—and many others—consider
myself to be a model teacher, but I spend precious little time instructing
my Ph.D. students on how to teach. I guess, truth be told, I depend on the
Math Department to worry about this matter. And, thankfully, my Depart-
ment does. We have a mandatory, three-credit-hour, semester-long course
on teaching that every ﬁrst-year student takes. And I think that it does a
lot of good. No graduate student T.A. (Teaching Assistant) at Washington
University is allowed to stand in front of a class until he/she has taken that
course. When I was Chair, I taught the course myself—in part to see that
it was done right, and in part to send the signal to the students and to the

46
CHAPTER 2. YOUR DUTIES
entire Department that we take teaching seriously around here.
There are several people in the Washington University Mathematics De-
partment who are teaching heroes, and are well known around campus as
such. That is a real plus for the Department, and helps to assuage the nega-
tives that were adumbrated above. Again, it is the job of the Chair to explain
the Department to the Dean. He/she must help the Dean to understand that
we are a group of committed scholars who take our teaching duties seriously
and dispatch them with professionalism and some ﬂair. We have strengths in
research, strengths in teaching, and strengths in Department and University
service. We frequently communicate with and work with the engineers, the
physicists, and other units on campus. We have broad-ranging interests, and
we make many types of contributions.
As Department Chair, I was once at a meeting—that the Dean called,
without telling me what the topic of discussion was going to be—in which the
Dean began (with raised voice) by telling me that the Math Department’s
priorities are
1. research;
2. the graduate students;
3. the math majors;
4. students who might become math majors;
5. everyone else.
The Dean then ﬁxed me with a baleful stare and declared: “I want you to
reverse the order of these priorities!”
I concluded at that moment that the Dean was a blithering idiot. But I
was confronted with a situation and I had to deal with it. I had to explain
that we teach more undergraduate student hours than any other Department,
we are in the top ten for the number of undergraduate majors that we have,
we have many innovative features in our curriculum, and we have many
committed teachers.
Many of us have to conduct our research programs
almost as a hobby because we have so many other duties—mostly connected
with teaching—in the Department.
One of the main duties of the Math
Department is try to help students who are not Math majors, who do not
have any particular ﬂair for Mathematics, to come to grips with the subject.

2.18. IS MATHEMATICS JUST A SERVICE DEPARTMENT?
47
I frankly do not know whether I convinced the Dean of anything, or
whether I converted him to the true path. But I can say that he backed oﬀ
and never got in my face about this set of issues again. I never found out
whether he delivered a similar harangue to any other science Chair. Given
the way that universities and their administrations work, I would doubt it.
The point is that this is the world we live in. The Dean is, likely as
not, a Chemist (a successful Chemist has to know how to run a lab, so is
almost by deﬁnition an “organization man” with considerable people skills)
and certainly appreciates the value, and the contributions of, the Chemistry
Department. Not so with Mathematics. For us it is an uphill battle to estab-
lish our worth and to maintain it. Even if the Dean pretends to understand
where we are coming from on Day n, he/she will have forgotten by day n+5.
And will have to be convinced anew. Such is the lot of the Math Department
Chair.

CHAPTER 3. STICKY WICKETS
3.1
How to Deal With a Sequence of 1-Year
Jobs
When the job market gets tough, it is usually because of economic strictures
on universities.1 They do not have as many regular 2- and 3-year postdocs
and (potentially) long-term Assistant Professorships to oﬀer as we would all
like. But the schools still need to staﬀtheir courses. An unfortunate upshot of
this situation is that a variety of last-minute, 1-year, non-renewable positions
get cobbled together. You may be the unfortunate recipient of one of these.
I know people who began their careers with a sequence of 1-year positions
like this. They really suﬀered. As I have said elsewhere in this book, you
cannot do mathematics eﬀectively by grabbing snatches of time here and
there. You really must have large chunks of time in which to concentrate on
your work. And these chunks of time cannot occur once per month. They
have to be a regular part of your life. You must also have some stability and
some peace in your life. Bouncing around from job-to-job is not conducive
to such serenity.
When you have 1-year positions you are always packing your bag or
unpacking your bag. You are constantly going through orientation proce-
dures, learning new work schedules and new computer labs and new teaching
paradigms. Your life is fairly chaotic. It is not like a 1-year sabbatical, which
is designed to help you relax. It is more like a 1-year stint in hell.
There is no easy answer to this problem. If you need a job, and you want
to stay in academics, then this may be all you can get for a while. I will say
this (as an alternative point of view): Taking a job in the private sector, or
working for government, is not a one-way door. Just because you go to work
for Microsoft or Hughes Aircraft for a while does not mean that you cannot
return to academe. I certainly know people who have done it. And you
may ﬁnd that you are happier, and deﬁnitely better paid with more peace
of mind, taking another kind of job for a while. You will have a little more
time to get your life organized and to plan your future.
In particular, you should focus on managing your time and your career
1There are other factors that can play a role. For purely political reasons—Tienamen
Square and the collapse of the Soviet Union, for example—there was a great inﬂux of
Chinese and Russians and Eastern Europeans into the American job market in the late
1980s. Many of these immigrants were world-class scholars whom everybody wanted. This
event had a profound impact on the availability of jobs for Americans.

development. Get some research done—stuﬀthat you can put on your CV.
Obviously you can avoid committees and other time drains. Gear your life
to looking your best for your next job search sortee.
3.2
What to Do if You Cannot Get Along
with a Colleague
If you are an Assistant Professor in a Math Department (or perhaps a junior
colleague at an industrial ﬁrm) and you cannot get along with your mentor
or supervisor or Chair then you deﬁnitely have a problem.
First, you should examine your conscience and determine whether this
lack of collegiality is at least partly your fault. If it is, then do something
to ﬁx the situation. If it is deﬁnitely not your fault, then you have some
choices. In the industrial setting the mentor is probably assigned to you
(i.e., he/she is likely your boss) and you are stuck with the person. In the
academic setting you may be able to just ﬁnd another mentor. However, if
you can’t get along with your Chair then look out. The Chair is going to be
assembling and promoting your tenure case. The Chair decides your raises
and your teaching assignments. In short, the Chair is the nearest thing to a
500-pound gorilla that you will see for several years. Make it your mission
to have a good relationship with your Chair.
If you are really stuck with a boss in the private sector who is diﬃcult
or impossible to work with, then try to stay away from him or her. Develop
good working relationships with others. You may be able to make a lateral
move (not initiated by you) and get out of the situation. Otherwise you are
going to have to swallow your pride and live with it for a while.
More generally, it can certainly happen that you will have disagreements
with colleagues. This is what serious discourse is about: If everyone agreed
with everybody else about everything then life would be pretty dull. Ideally,
the folks in the Math Department should be able to have vigorous discussions,
disagree about interpretations of facts or matters of policy, come to some
decision, and then go oﬀand have lunch together. Unfortunately this does
not always happen.
I must return again to a recurring theme in this book. Whereas most
of us have little control over a number of the important parameters in our
lives—taxes, our home life, international politics, the pursuit of a cure for

52
CHAPTER 3. STICKY WICKETS
cancer—we mostly tend to feel that we have a lot of control over what goes
on in the Math Department. This is our little self-created world. We get to
decide the curriculum, we get to decide whom to hire, and we get to decide
whom to tenure. If anyone—including a colleague—dares to encroach on
this purview then there is hell to pay. Just as an instance, there was a huge
brouhaha over a tenure case in a major research department about twenty
years ago. It got played out in the newspapers, and there were lots of lawyers
and lots of suits and countersuits. It became apparent over time that some
key administrators had made some dreadful errors in handling the case, and
things got quite ugly. In the end—after a protracted battle of over seven
years—the Chancellor intervened and just granted the candidate tenure and
back pay and damages. I can tell you that the department was vehemently
split over this tenure issue. People felt that they were not simply diﬀering
over matters of fact, but instead over much more fundamental questions.
The entire aﬀair was a life-changing experience for many of the faculty. And
today, even twenty years later, many of the wounds are still raw.
Another issue that has really split Math Departments in the past twenty
years is the question of teaching reform and calculus reform. Recall that,
in 1986, the inimitable Ron Douglas organized a small meeting (about 25
people) at Tulane University in which he asserted that calculus teaching
in this country is a disaster, the attrition rate is dreadful, and the failure
and dropout rates are a matter of national shame. He provided compelling
statistics to support his contentions. And he uttered the fateful words, “The
lecture is dead.” Thus was launched the so-called “Reform” movemement
in Mathematics teaching. And departments were quickly split. Many of us
old codgers were not in the mood to hear that a teaching method that we
had comfortably used for 30 or 40 years—and which in fact has been used
in many diﬀerent cultural contexts with many diﬀerent audiences for over
2000 years—is now to be thrown out the window and replaced with what?
Well, what was proposed was (among other things) (i) group learning, (ii)
self-discovery, and (iii) computer-aided learning. Several new texts, most
notably the Harvard Calculus Project, were produced in support of the new
movement. There were also notable Reform projects at Duke, at the ﬁve
colleges in Massachusetts,2 and in Oregon. Other projects too numerous to
2These are Amherst, the University of Massachusetts, Hampshire College, Mt. Holyoke,
and Smith. They are all within shouting distance of each other in Western Massachusetts.
In fact there is a bus service that will take you from one campus to another.

mention proliferated all over the country. And there was copious government
money to subsidize the changes that were taking place. Again it happened—
and I describe this phenomenon elsewhere in the book—that people who
had been fairly quiet in the mathematical life up until now suddenly had $3
million dollar grants. That is quite a lot of money—enough to set up an
empire, where the project would have its own oﬃces, its own staﬀ, its own
students, and it own agendas.
Just as people sharing drinks in a bar will really go to the mat over
whether the Yankees or the Mets are the better team this year, so people
just got hysterical over Traditional vs. Reform teaching. The inestimable
Chronicle of Higher Education reported that Math faculty were actually
physically assaulting each other over the question. People who had been
slaving away for many years to prove their little theorems and occasionally
get paltry grants from the NSF were somewhat resentful of these upstarts
getting multi-million dollar grants and exerting so much inﬂuence. And of
course the Dean and the administration don’t know much about Mathemat-
ics and Math teaching. But they know a lot about money. When they gaze
from a distance at the rather mysterious Math Department—full of enigmatic
eggheads who do something or other in some extremely recondite realm of
human thought—the guy/gal with the $3 million dollar grant really stands
out.
Of course fair is fair. These folks with the big grants will also play a
big role in the teaching enterprise of the department—and give it a high
proﬁle.
These people will look after calculus and pre-calculus and other
knotty courses. They will tend to the mentoring of freshmen. They will
design courses and write syllabi. In short, they can make your life easier.
I myself think that it’s ﬁne to disagree with people. This is a healthy
aspect of being a well-educated intelligent person; you discuss and you learn.
If it’s done right, everyone comes away with a new and heartfelt respect for
each other. But things can go awry. Feelings can be profoundly hurt. People
can feel that they have been cut to the quick in a most visceral sense. They
can decide to no longer speak to each other. And that is really a shame. The
Math Department is your extended family. You’ve got to live and work with
these people for forty years. Best if you can all get along. When things are
not going well with your biological family, there are professionals (priests,
rabbis, counselors, psychologists) who can help. In the academic setting it’s
not clear where you are supposed to turn for succor. One option is the Dean,
but likely as not he/she is part of the problem.

54
CHAPTER 3. STICKY WICKETS
I once had a huge ﬁght with a colleague over a matter of departmental
policy—something to do with hiring I think. In fact it had to do with Applied
Math, which has been another hotbed for controversy over the past forty
years. Don’t get me started. This guy and I really liked each other a lot, but
we disagreed in fundamental ways about this particular issue. And we could
be found in the hall yelling at each other at some length. It really got pretty
ugly.
Fortunate the goodness lying at the bottom of our souls ﬁnally got the
better of us. More signiﬁcantly, being the mature individuals that we ob-
viously were, we both realized that this bickering over a secondary matter
was interfering with the collegial and eﬀective running of the Department.
Neither of us was really enjoying this backbiting. At some point we decided
to kiss and make up. We both bent over backwards to repair the damage
and set our relationship back on an even keel. In fact we started working
on a problem together (we were actually in two very diﬀerent ﬁelds), and we
ended up writing two good papers—one with Paul Erd˝os! So there are some
happy endings, and we could use more of them.
3.3
What to Do if You Cannot Get Along
with Your Students
If you cannot get along with your undergraduate students then it probably
is your fault. Most undergraduates are delightful, are happy to be in college,
and are willing to make at least a token eﬀort to play the learning game.
They are generally quite easy to get along with. If, on the other hand, you
are one of those people who feels compelled to come across as a hard-nosed
autocrat, then you may ﬁnd that you have few friends.3
It is true—very rarely—that you can get a class that is just a dud. Some-
how the chemistry is lacking and you all just hate being in the same room
together. You can take strength in the fact that the semester is only ﬁf-
teen weeks long (if you are on the quarter system, make that ten weeks!) so
3One of my colleagues likes to begin a large lecture class—ﬁrst thing on the ﬁrst day—
by laying down the law. He enunciates that teaching a large class entails special managerial
problems, so he has special rules. Among these are: (a) You cannot come to class late;
(b) You cannot leave class early; (c) You cannot hand in homework late; (d) You cannot
eat in class. And on and on. Imagine what kind of tone this sets for the semester. Imagine
what kind of impression this makes on the students. I think that you can do better.

3.4. WHAT TO DO WITH A PROBLEM GRADUATE STUDENT
55
(unlike a bad marriage) it will be over soon. But you can also try varying
your teaching style or your lesson plan. Use some guest instructors—not to
torment them too, but to introduce some variety into the learning situation.
Show a ﬁlm. Have a discussion. It’s just like trying to carry on a conversa-
tion and ﬁnding that the situation is cold and lifeless. There are a variety of
devices that you can use to attempt to bring it back to life.
Students are diﬀerent from you and me. They are much younger, and
their values and goals are quite diﬀerent from the things that you and I
worry about.
Their expectations are in many instances unfamiliar to us.
But we were there not so long ago. With a little perspective, we can learn a
little tolerance and understanding of the student point of view. And it can
be refreshing, and provide a new look at the world around us. The main
point is to be open to what the students have to oﬀer; and to respond in a
constructive fashion.
Teaching—good and eﬀective teaching—is of necessity interactive. Were
this not the case then we could all be replaced by videotapes or OnLine
learning. If something is going awry in your class, then work with the class
to ﬁx it. You should have a good, working relationship with at least some of
the students. You should be able to talk to these people, take the temperature
of the situation, try to dope out where things are oﬀ-kilter and what you can
do to ﬁx them. Mid-term, anonymous teaching evaluations can be helpful.
But nothing beats talking to people.
3.4
What to Do With a Problem Graduate
Student
Usually you will not accept a student to study for the Ph.D. under your
direction unless you know that student fairly well. After all, this is a long-
term commitment, and a fairly intense relationship. It is going to take a
good deal of your time and eﬀort. So this is not an obligation that you are
going to take on lightly.
You can get to know graduate students through classes of course. Many
graduate students will sign up for a reading course with a professor whom
they might be thinking of asking to direct the thesis. At my own university,
we have a system of oral presentations that the student gives after the quals
and before the thesis. The student has a mentor for each of these activities,

56
CHAPTER 3. STICKY WICKETS
and frequently the mentor for one of them ends up being the thesis advisor.
It really is not wise to take on a Ph.D. student cold. You need some
mechanism to ﬁnd out about the student’s work habits and personality. You
need to see whether the two of you can communicate, and work productively
together. You are liable to spend ﬁve years in very close contact, working
towards a very large and diﬃcult grail. Make sure that this is a partnership
that is going to work.
If you do this right, you probably go into the thesis-advisor relationship
with a good idea a priori whether you will be able to get on with this grad-
uate student in the long term. Nonetheless, as with all aspects of human
relationships, things can go wrong. I have had 16 Ph.D. students, so can
count myself among the more successful thesis advisors. But I did have one
graduate student who started leveling death threats against me—in posters
that he hung all around the department! The institution can provide some
help. There are campus psychiatrists and counselors who have considerable
experience dealing with the peculiar stresses and disorders that come from
academic life. It is easy to have a session with such a person, and he/she can
make a number of useful suggestions.
Most likely your graduate students are not going to be taking out con-
tracts on you. But they can become blocked and hide from you (which is
just the opposite of what they should be doing). Some students are innately
lazy—or have never been challenged to really work before—and they just dig
themselves into a hole. Graduate students can also develop substantial per-
sonal diﬃculties—like having an intimate relationship with a student in one
of the classes that they TA. You, as a faculty member, are not necessarily
qualiﬁed to deal hands-on with all these situations. But if you have a good
working relationship with your student then you can get the student pointed
in the right direction—towards counseling, or self-discipline, or whatever the
situation may call for.
Your more experienced colleagues, who may have had similar trials them-
selves, can probably give you some tips. A student who is mentally unstable
and perhaps disruptive is probably not doing well in his/her studies either. It
might be appropriate to get him/her a terminal Masters Degree and gently
ease him/her out the door. Perhaps the department has some experience
with cases like that.
The main point is that you should not try to deal with a diﬃcult situation
like this in isolation. Talk to people. Get some help.

3.5. JOBS IN INDUSTRY
57
3.5
Jobs in Industry
I have seen good books, well-meaning books (such as [BEC]), refer conde-
scendingly to the “transition to industry.” The unspoken implication is that
you couldn’t make it in the academic world so had to fold your tent and take
a job with Microsoft or Daniel Wagner Associates.
I am happy to say that in today’s world this is not the right attitude,
and not the right way to look at things. It’s been a long process, but we in
the mathematics profession now realize and acknowledge that a mathematics
student today faces many exciting opportunities and many choices. The tired
old phrase “If you study math then all you can do is teach” has never been
further from the truth.
A Masters or Ph.D. student today certainly can choose the academic
path, but he/she could also become an actuary, could work in the genome
project, could work in aspects of law, could work for the National Security
Agency (NSA), could work for Hughes Aircraft, or in the ﬁnancial sector,
or many other choices. Three of my former Ph.D. students work at NSA.
One is an Internet Venture Capitalist (and he used to be a tenured Associate
Professor at Tennessee Tech), and one is in software development.
The truth is that—if one wished to take a rather dyspeptic point of view—
academics is perhaps not quite so attractive these days as it once was. It
is far too competitive and really not so friendly.
Salaries are little more
than adequate, and opportunities for advancement are limited.
Insidious
ideas from the business world like Total Quality Management (TQM) are
invading the way that we run our schools, and university administrators
are becoming less like academics and more like drill sergeants. Colleagues
can be brusque and unpleasant and working hours are long. Students can
be rude, tedious, lazy, and uncooperative. Deans and Provosts (and even
Department Chairs!) can be a bore. The ordeal of trying to get tenure and
then battling for promotion to full Professor can put a considerable strain on
your marriage and your personal psyche. It just may not be for you. Working
in the private/industrial sector may prove to be much more attactive.
In academics you have two big promotions in your life—from Assistant
to Associate Professor and from Associate to Full Professor. Each of these is
accompanied (usually) by a notable raise. Apart from those two life-changing
events, your raises in the academic life will be modest (absent getting an

58
CHAPTER 3. STICKY WICKETS
outside oﬀer or winning a big prize).4 Life is diﬀerent in industry. There
you will probably get a raise every year, and you may be up for promotion
every four or ﬁve years. The rewards may be considerable, especially once
you start moving up the management ladder.5
In industry you typically don’t have complete discretion in the problems
that you work on. You may have a choice, but the choice will be among
problems that matter to the company—that their funding sources are willing
to pay for. You are no longer thinking and researching for the joy of the game.
The point is to get results. It is a diﬀerent sort of process, and it has its
own rewards. One of my former Ph.D. students who works at NSA likes the
work, and ﬁnds it satisfying, because she feels that people actually use the
things that she creates.
People experienced with working in the private sector (see BEC]) point
out that academic recruiters are looking for “smart” while industrial re-
cruiters are looking for “team players who can make a contribution.” This
is a bit simplistic. No recruiter is looking for “dumb.” And everyone wants
to hire a team player. Especially if you are applying for a job at a school
where teaching is a major part of life, your academic qualiﬁcations (your
research specialty, the particular school where you got your Ph.D., the bona
ﬁdes of your thesis advisor) may be of only secondary importance. They will
be examining you as a person. Often industrial recruiters are looking for
problem-solving skills as well as people skills.
Fields important to a non-academic employer may include
• computer science
• statistics
• operations research
• numerical analysis
• engineering
4When I worked at UCLA, raises did not occur every year—not even cost-of-living
raises.
What would happen instead was that, every three or four years, there was a
“catch-up” raise. Most of my fellow faculty could document how their earning power had
fallen steadily during their time at U.C.
5It is quite common in the industrial setting—although certainly not mandatory—for
someone who is talented in R&D (Research and Development) to be fast-tracked into
management. This is where all the power, and the big bucks, is.

3.6. WHAT DO PEOPLE IN INDUSTRY DO?
59
This does not mean that your major subject area needs to be chosen from
this list. What it does mean is that it helps if you can show that you have
had some exposure to some of these ideas and techniques. I myself have
never had a course in computer science in my life. But I have created two
major pieces of software—software that actually changed the way that certain
industries do their business. Were I applying for an industrial job, that would
count. I am no expert in operations research, but I have taught a course in
linear programming and I know something about Karmarchar’s algorithm.
That would count. I have collaborated with engineers,6 and that would be
meaningful to an industrial recruiter.
Whenever you are interviewing for a job, you should be prepared to play
up your strong points and acquaint the interviewer with who you are and
what you have to oﬀer. The interviewer is not going to ﬁsh for your best
qualities. It is your job to put them forth. Make a case that your skill set
meshes well with this company (or school), its people, and its goals. This
may be particularly true for an industrial interview, if only because you are
trying to create a marriage between your academic background and the more
practical working environment to which you propose to move.
3.6
What Do People in Industry and Govern-
ment Do?
Good question. Much of this work is classiﬁed, and I can’t describe it (nor
do I know it). But I can say a few words about it.
Many private companies that do mathematics, or are run by mathemati-
cians (Daniel Wagner Associates is an outstanding example and Mitre Cor-
poration is another), survive largely on government contracts. They work on
particular defense projects such as the stealth program7, or robot-controlled
tanks and jets, or various questions in optimal control and systems science.
Those who work for government agencies might work for the Treasury, the
Federal Reserve, the Social Security Administration, or the Census Bureau.
Clearly the jobs there involve a lot of statistics and data management. There
is a great deal of statistical work in the applied world; data mining is a new
6The very fact that I can communicate with engineers would be noticeable.
7This is a program to develop, among other things, jet ﬁghter planes that can be
“invisible” to radar.

60
CHAPTER 3. STICKY WICKETS
set of ideas with considerable interest. A lot of computer graphics. A lot of
expert systems and robotics.
The National Security Agency specializes in (but is not exclusively limited
to) cryptography. The Institute for Defense Analyses studies a variety of
defense mechanisms, including even aspects of psychological warfare.
If you work in the computer industry then it is not diﬃcult to imagine
what you might be doing. I have one friend who worked for Microsoft in
developing Microsoft Word.®Another friend worked for Sun Microsystems;
he wrote a version of their UNIX operating system.
Quite a number of mathematicians, or at least people from the math-
ematical sciences, worked at Xerox Research PARC.8 This was one of the
great cauldrons of creativity in early Silicon Valley days. Founded and run
by George Pake of Washington University Physics, Research PARC saw the
following innovations in the span of just a few years:
• invention of the computer mouse;
• invention of the laser printer;
• invention of the personal computer (really!)
• invention of the Graphics User Interface (now known as Windows);®
• invention of the software now known as Adobe Postscript;®
• invention of the software now known as Adobe Acrobat.®
And that is only a partial list. The book [HIL] gives a detailed and exciting
history of this facility.
Some companies and agencies have the look and feel of academic depart-
ments. For instance, at the National Security Agency one ﬁnds that he/she
works rather autonomously. Certainly not closely supervised. One has par-
ticular projects to work on and one does so, reporting on results only every
several months. There are seminars and head sessions much as in a University
Math Department. But there are also diﬀerences. At NSA one is not allowed
to bring work home (for security reasons). One cannot bring a cell phone
to work. One cannot take public transportation to work. When visitors are
present then one cannot talk freely. It is an atmosphere that requires some
8This is the Palo Alto Research Center.

3.7. WHAT ABOUT TENURE?
61
acclimatization. One can imagine that any company or facility that deals
with high-security material will have similar features.
When I lived in State College, Pennsylvania, H. R. B. Singer was a big
employer. A number of mathematicians worked there. Singer dealt primar-
ily with electronic warfare, and you can imagine that security was high, and
taken very seriously. This really is quite diﬀerent from academics, where ev-
erything is wide open. There are plenty of opportunities for mathematicians
in the IT sector, in medicine, and in ﬁnance (to give just three examples).
Each of these will have diﬀering levels of security and secrecy.
If you work at a place like NSA, you will probably still write math papers.
But much of your work cannot be published in the usual venues.9 Anything
that you want to publish in the “outside world” has to be cleared by a
superior. This, too, takes some getting used to. But I know lots of people
who work at NSA—the largest employer of Ph.D. mathematicians in the
world. They seem to ﬁnd the work satisfying, and you rarely hear of people
leaving NSA.
3.7
What about Tenure?
In academic life, tenure is certainly the holy grail. Typically a career trajec-
tory goes like this:
• Graduate school (4 to 7 years)
• Postdoctoral position (2 or 3 years)
• Assistant Professorship (4 to 6 years)
• Tenure decision
• Associate Professorship (4 to 10 years)
• Promotion to full Professor
• Professorship (20 to 40 years)
9There are special journals that circulate only to people with high-level security clear-
ances in the defense industry. But this is not quite the same as publishing in the Trans-
actions of the American Mathematical Society.

62
CHAPTER 3. STICKY WICKETS
The fourth item is the make-or-break step, because if you don’t get tenure
then you are out of the loop and you will change career paths.
We shall say a good deal more about tenure as the book develops. Tenure
is the University’s lifetime commitment to you: to pay you a salary, provide
an oﬃce, create a supportive work environment, provide students, and so
forth. There are few jobs in this world that are more secure or more pleasant
than a tenured professorship at a University. If the institution does grant
you tenure, then it is stuck with you for thirty or forty years, and it is in for
a ﬁnancial commitment of $5 million or more. So naturally a good deal of
thought will go into the decision.
There is in fact a highly structured, multi-layered process for evaluating
tenure cases. We describe it in detail in the ensuing sections. The Depart-
ment, the Chair, the Dean, the Provost, the Chancellor, and the Board of
Trustees all pass judgment on every tenure case. And this is generally not a
decision that is made by your institution in isolation. In most tenure cases
the Department or the Dean will write out for letters about you—to distin-
guished faculty at esteemed institutions. They want to know how you ﬁt
into the big picture, what is your stature in the profession, what scholarly
contributions you have made.
3.8
Sex and the Single Mathematician
We are all sexual creatures, and we are all subject to temptations of the ﬂesh.
Many students, many staﬀmembers, and many fellow faculty are attractive
and charming and delightful. One may be tempted to get involved with
them beyond the ordinary parameters of social discourse. Worse, one may
be inexorably smitten and lose all control of one’s bodily functions. What to
do?
Generally speaking, it is a good idea to keep your personal life separate
from your professional life. Not doing so can cloud your judgment, compro-
mise your integrity, and get you into a whole passel of trouble. Never, ever
do anything with a student in one of your classes except teach him/her math-
ematics. Don’t go to a bar with your students, don’t go to parties with your
students, don’t play touch football with your students. Universities have
very strict rules about sexual harassment and breaching those strictures is
an entree into a world of grief and pain.
If you are married then it is certainly not my business to tell you how to

3.8. SEX AND THE SINGLE MATHEMATICIAN
63
live your life. You are supposed to already know the answer. If you are single,
then you may very well ﬁnd that meeting people in the math department is
considerably more constructive and convivial than meeting people in a bar
or at a dog ﬁght. It is OK to ask the departmental receptionist for a date,
but the date should be completely separate from your relationship in the
Department. When at the oﬃce you should behave in a businesslike and
dispassionate fashion. Likewise for colleagues. Dating students opens up too
many possibilities of conﬂict of interest and (because you have all the power
and they don’t) harassment, and you would be wise to steer clear of this
temptation.
It is an unfortunate fact of life that if you are accused of sexual harassment
then you are not innocent until proven guilty. You may as well have a red
letter branded on your forehead. The main point is that it’s a he-said, she-
said situation, and once the complainant has spoken then the ﬁx is in.
If you are accused of sexual harassment, then there are several diﬀerent
ways that the situation could play out. In the best of all possible circum-
stances you could have an in-house hearing to adjudicate the charges, and any
punishment that is meted out will be relatively mild and not have a lasting
eﬀect. In the worst possible scenario you could go to jail. Also your mar-
riage could be wrecked, your integrity compromised, and your relationship
with your colleagues tainted. In today’s climate, even a perfectly innocent
faculty member can be tarred with an ugly and damaging brush.
As an instance, a friend of mine was the Graduate Vice-Chair at a big
state university. As part of the ordinary course of his duties, he had to dismiss
a young female graduate students whose performance on the quals was not
up to par. She took this amiss, and decided to ﬁle sexual harassment charges
against him. This action was completely without foundation; she did so just
to be vindictive. Fortunately for my friend, his wife stuck by him and his
department stuck by him. He got through it. It took a full year, and his life
was in stasis for that entire period. But he is now a changed man. He treats
students diﬀerently and, frankly, rather carefully. He is now exceptionally
cautious in all such dealings.
There is not much that you can do to protect yourself against unfounded
accusations of sexual harassment (by students). But here are a few recom-
mendations:
• Never meet with students in your oﬃce with the door closed.
• Do not have sofas or other furniture on which one could recline in your

64
CHAPTER 3. STICKY WICKETS
oﬃce.
• Do not sit close to your students.
• Do not ever touch your students.
• Do not engage in extracurricular activities with students—dates, visits
to bars, going to concerts, visits to museums. You might consider going
to coﬀee with a group of students; it is probably a mistake to go with
just one.
• Do not make suggestive remarks to students; do not give them mean-
ingful or prolonged looks.
The list can go on and on, but the gist is clear. You must be very careful.
You must be aware of what is going on around you. It is all too easy for a
student to start to come on to you, then later on to change his/her mind and
make a charge of harassment.
I really don’t want make it sound as though teaching these days is like
navigating a mineﬁeld. For the most part it is a pleasure. But there are
cautions that one must exercise in order to steer clear of dangerous waters.
3.9
First Kill All the Lawyers
When the bard ﬁrst penned those words, he could hardly have anticipated
the contentious and litigious society that has evolved. You never know who
may sue whom for what. The ﬁrst piece of advice that my ﬁnancial planner
ever gave me was to purchase a $1 million dollar umbrella liability policy—
just to protect against unexpected lawsuits. It costs about $150 per year,
and seems to be money well spent.
We have already, in Section 3.8, discussed the dangers of sexual harass-
ment issues. Sexual harassment is a legitimate issue, and people need to be
protected from it. Just as an instance, the famous movie producer Darrell
F. Zanuck was in the habit of having a young starlet shown into his private
oﬃce every afternoon. The understanding was that he would give her a part
in one of his new movies if she would reciprocate with certain intimate favors.
This sort of behavior was at one time all too common, and something had to
be done to curtail it. The result is the sexual harassment laws that we have
today.

3.9. FIRST KILL ALL THE LAWYERS
65
The trouble with sexual harassment, no matter what the gender of the
accuser or the accusee, is that the charges are all too easy to levy—with or
without any factual support for them. And they are dreadfully diﬃcult to
defend against. There are rarely any witnesses, and the adjudication of the
claim often comes down to innuendo, reputation, and surmise. If you are
a person who tells bawdy jokes, or acts in a swaggering manner, you are
perhaps more vulnerable than most to sexual harassment charges. If you are
a man you are probably more vulnerable than a woman. That’s just the way
it is, and we must learn to live with it. People have lost their jobs, their
marriages, and their peace of mind over sexual harassment disputes. You
can imagine that it is rather diﬃcult to explain to one’s spouse or partner
that one has been accused of sexual harassment but of course the charges are
unfounded.
Another wrinkle of life that we must deal with these days is political
correctness. Political correctness is a concept with a long history—dating
even to a U. S. Supreme Court decision in 1793. Some people attribute the
modern interest in political correctness to a 1992 paper of Arizona State
University Law Professor Richard Calleros. The idea of political correctness
is that language can be used to classify and oppress people. Even without
the speaker being fully aware of the implications of his/her speech, he/she
could be inadvertently fueling the repression of a class of people. Certainly
the use of the term “picaninny” to refer to an African American child, or of
“dugs” to refer to the breasts of a native African woman, are prime examples
of political incorrectness (according to the deﬁnition just given).
Of course colleges and universities are places that prize the exploration of
new ideas; and often people latch on to these ideas and endeavor to turn them
into a campaign or a way of life. This is what has happened with political
correctness. Even some very prestigious, and otherwise quite scholarly and
tony, Eastern private universities have actually circulated to their faculties
lists of terms that are considered to be “politically incorrect” along with
suggested alternative terms that are more acceptable. Examples might be

66

Politically Incorrect Term
Socially Acceptable Term
snowman
eﬃgy of a person fashioned from snow
cheating
academic dishonesty
blind
visually challenged

Well, you get the idea. Some might ﬁnd it demeaning to be so instructed by
their university administration. Others might ﬁnd it laughable. One does not
often hear of lawsuits that derive from a careless use of language, but there is
a certain amount of malice and repression that derives from implementation
of the idea of political correctness.
Of course we should all be respectful of other people—no matter what
their ethnic background or social status. As a result, we should be careful of
what we say. If someone cites you for being politically incorrect, thank them
for the information and promise to do better. There is hardly anything more
that a reasonable person can do.

The Two-Body Problem
Life in the 1950s was simple. Most Math Departments wouldn’t hire women—
period. Misogyny was, quite frankly, rampant. Jobs were few. And nobody
could be bothered to worry about social issues. Also salaries were low and
the workload (i.e., the teaching load) was high. You really had to love math-
ematics to want to go into this profession.
And your spouse had to love
you.
It was like being in the Army: You went where the work was, you were
paid a pittance, you lived in very humble circumstances.
Your wife was
expected to stay home, cook dinners (for you and for visitors), put up guests,
go to boring colloquium parties and laugh at the Chair’s lame jokes, and drink
coﬀee with the other wives. Oh, yes, and raise the kids.
Things are diﬀerent now. Most spouses have careers. And, since college
and graduate school are likely places to meet a spouse, many spouses are
also mathematicians—or at least academics. This means that a Mathemati-
can who is looking to change jobs brings with him/her a certain amount of

3.10. THE TWO-BODY PROBLEM
67
baggage—like a partner who wants a job too. This is called the two-body
problem.10
There are certain legalities that prevent the recruiting Chair from asking
many questions about this so-called “two-body” problem. But the candidate
can bring it up, and probably he/she should. Because certainly this problem
is bound to aﬀect whether the candidate can accept any oﬀer.
As mentioned elsewhere in this tract, there are some universities that
have the power—by way of explicit edict of the institution—to simply cook
up a job for the partner.
And I don’t mean just any old job; I mean a
tenure-track faculty position. Other schools, like my own, will have a person
in the administration who is the go-to person for spouses. This individual
will provide orientation information for the spouse, professional contacts to
aid in looking for a position, and can possibly even help to set up interviews.
In many cases the burden will fall largely on the Department Chair to try
to scare up something for the spouse. This is not so easy, and will depend
a good deal on whom the Chair knows, what kind of networking he/she has
done, what sorts of strings he/she can pull.
Some Math Departments, with the explicit blessing and support of their
Administrations, can try to make an oﬀer both to the original candidate and
to the spouse (assuming that the spouse is also a mathematician). Unfor-
tunately it can happen that the original candidate is the person that they
really want—the one with all the credentials, the hot new theorems, the
glow-in-the-dark letters of recommendation—and the spouse is somewhat
less attractive. In that case the Department must examine its collective con-
science carefully and decide whether it wants to compromise its standards in
order to gain a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.
What people in the Math Department would like to convince themselves
of—and I say this because it comes up every time that questions like this are
considered—is that the position for the spouse is a “freebee.” That the Dean
is just giving this slot to the Department, and it doesn’t count in the great
reckoning of how many tenure-track faculty there ought to be in the Math
Department. Don’t kid yourself. Governor Jerry Brown of California was
right when he said that there is no free lunch; there are also no free faculty
10The name derives from a classical problem in mechanics. Johannes Kepler and Isaac
Newton completely described the motion of two planets acting on each other with the force
of gravity. So the two-body problem is in eﬀect a done deal. The three-body problem is
still open. Well, that is the situation in mechanics. The two- and three-body problems in
human relations are still diﬃcult issues.

CHAPTER 3. STICKY WICKETS
positions. Even if the Dean says it’s free, let me assure you that it’s not. As
soon as the next Dean comes in, he/she is going to count positions in the
Math Department by taking oﬀhis/her shoes and enumerating in the usual
fashion. No slot will be treated any diﬀerently from any other.
If you, as Chair, are asked to handle a two-body situation, then my
advice is to proceed with some delicacy. Show the candidates the utmost
consideration, and be solicitous of their needs.
Do what you can do for
them. You may be thinking, in the back of your cranium, that this is not
how you were treated when you were a candidate here (some thirty or more
years ago). Your spouse was given no particular consideration. Why is this
candidate so special? The answer is that this candidate is not so special.
But the rules of engagement have changed. If you want to compete in this
marketplace then you have to come to terms with these new exigencies.

CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
4.1
What is Mathematical Research?
The trouble with education is that it can make you too dependent on your
teachers. Breaking away from your Ph.D. advisor and your other mentors
and charting your own course in the academic or professional world is ac-
tually quite diﬃcult to do. In point of fact most people do not succeed in
establishing their own scholarly identity.
One of the—although certainly not the only—means by which we estab-
lish our independent gestalt and Weltanschauung as mathematicians is by
founding and developing an individual research program. If you are fresh
out of graduate school then it is probably not at all clear how this is done.
Likely as not, your thesis advisor gave you a thesis problem and helped you
to solve it (although the road can be a little more complicated than that—see
[KRA7]). This is not at all what real life is like. You are now an Assistant
Professor in a Math Department, you no longer have a thesis advisor, you do
not have anyone suggesting problems to you, and you certainly don’t have
anyone holding your hand while you are engaged in your research. So where
do you turn? What do you do?
This is a situation in which omphaloskepsis will not do the trick (although
it has been frequently tried). You cannot succeed at anything in life unless
you know precisely what it is that you are trying to accomplish. So let us
enunciate that ﬁrst: You are trying to establish yourself as a player in an
area of mathematical research. You do so by proving some good theorems
and publishing some papers that report on those theorems.
There are several potential roadblocks to your progress on this program:
• You need to ﬁnd problems that are of interest to you, will give you the
ﬁre in the guts, will make you so consumed that you must solve them.
• The problems of the ﬁrst stripe must also be problems that ﬁt naturally
into the current ongoing ﬂow of mathematics as it is practiced today.
There are many ﬁne mathematicians throughout the world who main-
tain important and distinguished research programs. They, in eﬀect,
deﬁne what mathematics today is all about. Your research program
should mesh with what is of interest to the leaders in the ﬁeld. Be-
cause, in the end, it is they who will judge the value of your work.1 If
1They do so in a variety of ways: By refereeing your papers, by refereeing grant pro-
posals, and by organizing conferences and issuing invitations thereto.

4.1. WHAT IS MATHEMATICAL RESEARCH?
73
you decide to write a sequence of papers about the EMIRP numbers,2
you may derive a certain amount of personal satisfaction but you will
not establish a reputation and you will not get tenure.
• You need to ﬁnd problems that you have a chance of solving, or at
least of making a signiﬁcant contribution towards their understanding.
This is a tricky point, because it takes considerable experience to know
how to weigh a problem and to determine whether this is a problem
that you can make a dent in. That is why you must go to seminars,
go to conferences, and talk to people. One of the great things about
modern mathematics is that there is so much free and open communi-
cation. There are very few of us who keep our problems secret, or keep
our research programs secret. Even going to people’s Web pages can
be an immensely informative and rewarding experience. Many people
maintain problem lists, Wiki-pages, chat rooms, and other OnLine de-
vices for helping people get up to speed in the ﬁeld. You should take
advantage of all these tools.
• You need to actually get the papers written—and written in a form
and style that is of publication quality.
• You need to get the papers submitted to journals, get them through
the editorial process, and get them accepted.
These ﬁve—especially the ﬁrst three—are perhaps the most fundamental
issues in getting a research program going. Unfortunately there are a number
of other junctures where you could stumble or fall. There are quite a few
very talented mathematicians in our world who just cannot seem to manage
to get their work written up. Or, having written it down in some form, they
cannot seem to ﬁnd the energy or discipline to put it into a form that can
be submitted to a journal. Or having perhaps found the wherewithal to get
the paper sent to a journal, they do not have the maturity and the tenacity
to deal with the editor and the referees and make the edits and corrections
that have been requested.
Let me stress that this is your life.
If you choose to be an academic
mathematician, then you will spend a good deal of your time—for the next
2If you do not happen to know what an EMIRP number is then God bless you. The
word “EMIRP”is “prime” spelled backwards. An EMIRP number is a positive integer
with the property that, if you reverse the order of the digits, you get a prime.

74
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
forty years or more—wrestling with getting your ideas recorded, wrestling
with getting your ideas into publishable form, wrestling with editors, and
going three falls with referees. It is very hard work, and requires considerable
discipline and commitment and often some humility. Not all of us are cut
out for it. But there you have it; this is the scholarly world.
4.2
How to Do Mathematical Research
My teacher and friend Fred Almgren used to say that a graduate student
should spend four hours every day doing mathematics; what he/she did with
the rest of the day was his/her business. Now one must understand that Fred
had incredible powers of concentration. When he did mathematics, he was
not distracted by music or coﬀee cups or phone calls or e-mail or answering
the door or anything else. All he did was sit and think. Absolutely nothing
could distract him. Fred was often twenty minutes late for class because he
was so lost in thought that he had no sense of time.
Not many of us are blessed with such powers. But it is an observed fact
that it is nearly impossible to do serious mathematical research for more than
four or ﬁve hours in a day. You can kid yourself and pretend to spend twenty
hours a day working—hanging out in the library, sitting in the coﬀee room
BS-ing about mathematics, going OnLine and reading chat rooms and Web
sites of famous mathematicians, staring at printouts of the latest papers
from famous guys at Princeton and Harvard. But the fact is that, if you
have the discipline and stamina to do so, you are much better oﬀdoing
what Fred Almgren did: Go some place where you absolutely, positively
cannot be interrupted and sit in front of a tablet of paper and think hard
and calculate.3 Try things. Scribble and conjecture and ﬁddle and tinker
and make mistakes and try to learn from them. I’ve had great ideas while
driving the car or taking a shower or lying on the lawn staring at the birds.
But my most productive times have been times spent alone in front of the old
tablet with a pen clutched in my ﬁst, calculating away. If you can produce
four productive hours like this ﬁve or six days per week, then you will be a
very successful mathematician.
Now fair is fair and we must acknowledge that the shape and nature
3Lars Ahlfors liked to say that all a mathematician needs in order to do his/her work
are paper, a pencil, and a waste basket. He went further to say that a philosopher required
even less equipment, as he/she had no need for the waste basket.

4.2. HOW TO DO MATHEMATICAL RESEARCH
75
of mathematical research is ever-changing. Some people—not just numeri-
cal analysts but modelers and many others—do much of their research on
the computer.
Some people do their research in teams.
Interacting with
other people is a key part of their research program. Such people will spend
a few hours every day just banging their heads together, generating ideas.
Some people actually build physical models, and derive ideas from those
physical models. David Hoﬀman and his team GANG at the University of
Massachusetts would generate numerical solutions of the minimal surface
equation and thereby generate graphical models on the computer of certain
minimal surfaces that nobody had known even existed. They would stare at
these graphical images, discuss and debate them, and draw certain concep-
tual conclusions from what they saw. Then they would sit down and prove
theorems in the traditional fashion with pen and paper. I myself do research
in collaboration with some plastic surgeons. At least some of our work is fu-
eled by activity in the operating theater (performed by physicians), opening
up patients and wielding the old scalpel.
Like teaching, doing mathematical research is an intensely personal ac-
tivity. Part of your job, when you are starting out in this discipline, is to
ﬁgure out what works for you, to develop the necessary tools and talents,
and to put them to work. Along the way, you will falter and fail and have to
pick yourself up and try again. But this is life. Progress will take the form
of two steps forward, one step back. But there will be progress indeed if only
you are committed to the process and have your goals clearly in sight.
The ﬂip side of what I have been saying here is that you must have non-
trivial, contiguous chunks of time in which to do your work. Doing math-
ematics is not like polishing shoes—you cannot do your work in 20-minute
snatches. In fact it frequently takes an hour to get all the ideas organized in
your head before you can actually start to calculate and think and try things.
And you must have the leisure to really turn ideas over in your mind, try
diﬀerent approaches, try to prove something is true by ﬁrst trying to prove
that it is false. The great and mysterious fact about mathematical research
is that you frequently do not know what it is you are looking for. That makes
the quest exciting, but it also makes it frustrating and time-consuming. On
the one hand, you cannot productively spend 20 hours per day doing serious
mathematics. But you also cannot usefully spend 20 minutes per day doing
serious mathematics.
It will also happen that you prove a good theorem, give some seminar
talks on it, garner praise and adulation, write up the result so that it glows

76
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
in the dark, submit it to a journal, and have it rejected. Be of stout heart.
Henrik Ibsen and Jane Austen and many another ﬁne writer4 had his/her
best work rejected. Some of my own ﬁnest and most inﬂuential papers were
not only rejected at ﬁrst, but were wholeheartedly insulted by the referees.
And the editors were of no help either. In the intellectual world, tenacity and
self-conﬁdence are two of the most important attributes that you can have.
Maintain your modesty and your dignity, but cultivate these two essential
properties in yourself.
If a paper is rejected, read the reports carefully and endeavor to learn
from them. Find out how to make the paper better and do so. Show the
paper to a senior mentor or even to a peer colleague. Do everything you can
to capitalize on the situation and to learn something from it. Then re-submit
and see whether you can do better. I have never had a paper that I could
not get published. But I have stumbled, I have had papers rejected, I have
needed to swallow my pride and work hard to shore up a paper before I could
get it out the door. That is part of the publishing game; you will get used to
it. And you will learn from it. In the end it is rewarding, and it will make
you stronger.
4.3
How to Establish a Research Reputation
This has to be the key question, as it is the nub of success in the academic
world. It is not just enough to write things and publish them. You must get
people to read them and appreciate them. In the best of all possible worlds,
you want people to be running seminars in which they discuss your work. If
you write a book, you want people to read your book and talk about it. You
want fellow scholars to feel that your ideas have an impact.
This is a lot like asking how to become a great violinist or a great painter.
It is not enough to learn the hand positions and master the details of a
Bach partita (for music). Nor is it enough to learn the basics of color and
composition (for art). There is a great component of inspiration and, indeed,
of genius. Either you’ve got it or you don’t.
But I deﬁnitely do not want to come oﬀhere as saying to you, “If you

4.3. HOW TO ESTABLISH A RESEARCH REPUTATION
77
have to ask then you haven’t got it. Better ply your wares elsewhere.” There
is more to it than that.
Certainly being smart is a big part of being a
mathematician. And being inspired is an inestimable commodity. But the
single most important feature of a successful mathematician is a capacity for
hard work. And dedication and tenacity. Plus the inner strength to forge on
even when the going gets tough and things do not look very promising.
Most mathematicians, indeed most academics, are quite fragile. They
come from a lifetime of many successes and very few failures. School is,
quite frankly, rather rote and repetitious. Once you get the hang of it you
can do quite well—even through graduate school. But once you are a profes-
sional academic you are in the big leagues. You are competing against people
who are every bit as talented as you and sometimes more so. Now you will
not triumph every time. Far from it. Many academics fall by the wayside
because they are simply not temperamentally ﬁt to deal with failure or dis-
appointment. Even small disappointments. If you can muster the tenacity
to pick yourself up and ﬁght on then you will have a great advantage over
most of your colleagues.
You can write very good papers—perhaps not the papers that will rein-
vent a subject, or start a whole new direction—that make a solid contribution
to a ﬁeld just by working hard, mastering a body of material, doing lots of
calculations, thinking deeply, and reporting what you have learned. This can
be the basis for a respectable and rewarding career. And this is in fact what
most of us do. You may not win the Fields Medal, or be a Plenary Speaker
at the International Congress, but you can hold your head up and feel that
you have contributed to the infrastructure of your ﬁeld. You have made a
contribution that is appreciated and will be part of the canon.
There is little of a self-initiated nature that you can do to get your work
appreciated. Your are not a scion of Madison Avenue. Giving lots of talks
about your stuﬀis certainly a good way to get some attention for your ideas.
Writing expository articles is another (although you do not want to develop
the reputation as being someone who writes primarily expository articles).
And just talking to people—sharing your ideas—is another useful way to
cast your bread upon the waters. In the end, people will form their own
judgments. It is the discipline itself that decides the value of your work.

78
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
4.4
Seminars
Seminars are a key part of the mathematical life. A seminar is a device for
sharing new mathematics with colleagues, for stimulating useful discussions,
and even for spawning new collaborations.
If you are a skeptic, you may say that if you want to share mathematics
with a colleague then you will simply knock on his/her door and start talking
about mathematics. But it is a fact of life that people often need a catalyst
to get their communication started. The seminar is a useful device for that
purpose. It is also speciﬁcally designed for getting graduate students involved
and for getting young faculty jump-started on their research careers.
Be sure to ﬁnd out about the relevant seminars in your department (or
in departments at nearby institutions).5 Be an active participant. Give talks
in the seminar. These talks need not be about the latest theorem that you
proved last night. They could be about an interesting paper that you read
recently, or an interesting idea that looks potentially fruitful but hasn’t been
fruitful yet. A seminar should be a friendly, generous, constructive exchange
of information. It is a very positive way to socialize (in a professional manner)
with your colleagues. It is a way to really get to know people.
You will no doubt reach a stage in your career when it is appropriate for
you to start and to run a seminar.6 It doesn’t take much to do so. You hang
an announcement on the Departmental Bulletin Board (and these days you
might also send out an e-mail and put up a Web page) enunciating what you
want this seminar to be about and why there are compelling reasons to start
something up. Then you arrange for an organizational meeting.
If you’ve done things right, and chosen a hot and lively topic (it’s a good
idea to knock on some doors and talk things up with some key potential
participants), then a bunch of people will show up at your organizational
5Here “nearby” could mean within a 100-mile radius. A great many mathematians
have taken jobs around the Boston area just so that they can attend seminars at Harvard
and MIT. When I was at Penn State, people used to drive a considerable distance from
branch campuses to participate in my seminar.
6In France, the seminar of Cartan and the seminar of Lelong—to name just two—
exerted an enormous inﬂuence over the development of twentieth-century French mathe-
matics. The Gelfand seminars in Moscow played a pivotal role in shaping modern Soviet
mathematics, and mathematics in general. We do not have such a system in this country.
But I might note that the Walter Rudin seminar at the University of Wisconsin is widely
viewed as having been extremely inﬂuential, and important in the development of many
ﬁne analysts.

4.5. WRITING PAPERS
79
meetings. At that point you should engender a lively discussion of what this
seminar should be, or what people want it to be. And then you need to
sign up some speakers. If people have shown up at this meeting, then they
will know that they are liable to be tapped to be speakers. So you certainly
ought to get at least a handful of volunteers. You can deﬁnitely oﬀer to
speak yourself, and you should. And then you are oﬀand running. You
must consult with the appropriate staﬀmember to line up a suitable weekly
time slot and of course a room. And then you have a seminar.
Even though we don’t have the French system, it is really true that a
good seminar can have a lasting eﬀect, and can really play a decisive role in
the development of mathematicians both young and old. The seminar that
Dick Palais ran in the 1960s on the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem has had
a tremendous eﬀect. It certainly helped the world to understand what this
important theorem is all about. It helped to promulgate and establish the
signiﬁcance of pseudodiﬀerential operators and K-theory. And the volume
that Palais published based on the seminar certainly established his presence
in the mathematical ﬁrmament.
And this last is a notable point. Your seminar could in principle publish
periodic volumes of its proceedings.
At least you could publish them on
the Web. And if you can develop a proactive relationship with a traditional
publisher then perhaps you can publish them in the more traditional fashion.
As an instance, the Cabal Seminar publications out of UCLA and Cal Tech
have had a positive and lasting eﬀect on the logic community.
Running a seminar makes you a real player in the mathematical life of
your Department. When a job candidate or a visitor comes through, and
asks, “What goes on here?” then it is natural for the host or the Chair to
say, “We have this seminar run by A and we have that seminar run by B.”
These are bellwethers of what is happening in the Department. And the
Dean likes to know that there are seminars. These are indications that the
Department has a lively scholarly life.
4.5
Writing Papers
The full chapter and verse of how to write a paper has been treated in [KRA2].
Here we shall only hit some of the high points.
There are several reasons to write a mathematical paper:
1. You want to plant your ﬂag. You want to establish, for the historical

80
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
record, that you are the one who discovered this theorem and you
proved it ﬁrst.
2. You want to teach something important to the mathematical commu-
nity.
3. You want to establish and describe an important new body of tech-
niques in the subject.
4. You want to explain something that has never been explained before.
5. You want to exposit an important area of mathematics, teach it to
a broad audience, change it from a disconnected collection of isolated
results into a coherent ﬁeld.
If your only goal is 1.—and I am sorry to say that for many mathemati-
cians that is the only goal—then you probably don’t care much about the
quality of writing in your paper, you probably don’t care who your audience
is, you probably don’t give a lot of thought to whether you are communi-
cating eﬀectively or well, and you certainly don’t need to read any further
what I have to say in the matter. If instead your goal is to communicate, to
enlighten, and to play a proactive role in your discipline, then read on.
The ﬁrst and most important precept of any sort of writing is that you
must have something to say. In mathematics—much more so than in many
other academic disciplines—this is really a cut and dried matter.
Either
you have proved a new theorem or you have not. It is virtually impossible
in mathematics to write a paper (and get it published!) that says, “This
morning I woke up and tried to prove the Riemann hypothesis and I failed.”
Dress it up as you will, this just isn’t going to ﬂy. The necessary and suﬃcient
condition for being able to write a new paper (assuming that this is not an
expository paper) is that you have a non-trivial new result to present.
So let us suppose that you do. The next pre-requisite for eﬀective writing
is that you consider carefully who your audience is. Is it graduate students?
Undergraduates? Fully vested mathematicians? Researchers? Specialists in
your subject area? Super-specialists on this particular problem?
In most cases, if you have proved a new theorem in your particular area
of research, then that theorem is probably fairly specialized. Probably rather
technical. Likely of interest only to a limited audience. So your target for the
paper you are writing is going to be at most specialists in analytic number

4.5. WRITING PAPERS
81
theory, or specialists in several complex variables, or specialists in nonlinear
partial diﬀerential equations of second order. It could be more special than
that. Many a good paper addresses a rather limited group of people who
have actually spent time on that particular problem.
The considerations in the last paragraph will aﬀect how your paper is
written. How much can you assume that your audience knows? Will that
audience be acquainted with all the technical jargon?
Will it be familiar
with all the history and background of the problem? Will it have all the
motivation in place? Will it just be saying, “OK, what’s the statement of
the theorem? Where’s the proof? Save the hearts and ﬂowers for another
occasion.” Clearly you cannot formulate your paper eﬀectively (in your mind,
before you set pen to paper) until you have these factors clearly in focus.
Your new paper should be well organized. It should begin with some
background and motivation for the problem at hand. In fact it can safely
be said that most readers will read your abstract, and many readers will
read your introduction. The number that will forge on beyond that is rather
small. So those ﬁrst two components of the paper are of utmost importance.
You should polish them to a high sheen, and make them so that any well-
informed mathematician can get something of value from them. Tell people
what is in the paper and why it is interesting. Give them a reason to want
to read on.
The introduction need not be prolix. One page is more than enough—less
if you can point the reader to a good and accessible source that will give all
the needed background. It is nice if you can give an informal, somewhat less
technical, rendition of the key result before you get down and start rolling
in the mud. That way the reader can spend about ten minutes and get a
good idea of (i) what this paper is about, (ii) what background is needed
to appreciate the paper, (iii) what is the main result, (iv) whether or not
he/she really wants to put in some time and try to understand all the gory
details.
The next part of the paper could give some notation and statements of key
supporting ideas. Although this material is in principle somewhat technical,
mathematicians ﬁnd it rather comforting. This is our bread and butter, and
this is how you will bring the reader up to speed. You may follow this section
with a section that (building on the material just described) gives careful and
rigorous statements of the main theorems.
If the proofs that you are going to present are really diﬃcult and tricky,
then it is nice to provide a section that outlines the key steps of the proof.

82
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
This would be silly if your full-blown proof is just 2.5 pages and not too hard
to read. But if the proof is really long and complicated, then an overview
is much appreciated and will help with the rather diﬃcult reading that lies
ahead.
Finally you present all the dirty details of the proof. Do take advantage
of the formalism of modern mathematics to help you lay things out. Have
enunciated lemmas, propositions, sublemmas, and so forth to organize the
ideas and break the reasoning up into steps. Provide some intermediary prose
to remind the reader of where he/she has been and where we are going. If
appropriate, let the proof span several sections so that the layout of the
ideas—in the large—becomes clearer. Always be sure that the reader knows
where he/she is and what is being proved at any given moment. Do not have
a lot of hanging lemmas and unproved claims and unformulated hypotheses.
It is always best to have everything up-front and explicit.
It is OK, and commonly done, to end a paper with something like
. . . and therefore the sequence converges hemi-semi-demi uniformly
at almost every point of the pseudo-set.
This communicates a certain joie de vivre, and lets the reader know that you
are an author who knows when to call it quits. But such an ending is also
quite likely to leave the reader saying, “Huh??” Because he/she will have to
do a double-take, go back and ﬁgure out why this convergence ﬁnishes the
proof and establishes what was claimed, satisfy him/herself that the job has
been done.
It is always a bit nicer, and certainly more eﬀective communication, to
have some concluding remarks that draw all your ideas together, point out
what has been accomplished and how, and suggest further avenues of re-
search. These remarks can be contained in a special section called Concluding
Remarks. Just as a good talk should end with some summatory observations,
so should a good paper.

Writing Books
I have written quite a number of research papers, some of them quite good.
And some of them quite inﬂuential. But my work that has had the greatest

4.6. WRITING BOOKS
83
and broadest and most lasting impact is the books that I have written. A
book is a diﬀerent type of writing, with a diﬀerent sort of audience, and
certainly diﬀerent goals.
I speak at the moment not of textbooks (which will be disussed elsewhere)
but of stand-alone research monographs and the like. A monograph can be
your deﬁnitive statement about your subject area, based on your struggles
to master it and to make deﬁnitive contributions to it. You can provide
the genesis and history of the ideas, the motivation for the key concepts, a
description of the important techniques, and a panorama of the applications.
This is deﬁnitely the way to make your mark. Especially if the topic has
not been exposited before, you are really making a change in the infrastruc-
ture of mathematics. A good book provides a synthesis of ideas, and presents
them from a particular point of view. In writing this tract you shape your
subject in a powerful and fruitful manner. Your book will stand for a long
time, will be read by a good many students and professional mathematicians,
and will help people to understand a part of the world.
A good deal has been said about the particular tools and techniques that
should be used to write a good book (see [KRA2]), and I shall not regurgitate
them here. Let me just say for now that bookwriting is not for everyone.
Whereas writing up a research paper could take a month or two, the writing
of a book could take one or several years. A book is perhaps 15 times as
long as a paper, but it could take 50 times as much of your life. It is a
complicated business. There are terriﬁc organizational issues, and delicate
decisions about what to include and what not to include. In addition, the
process is suﬃciently protracted that there could be fast-breaking new results
that change the nature of the beast even while you are writing the book!7
Antoni Zygmund’s famous book [ZYG] is a monument to Fourier analysis
and classical analysis in general. It may be the most important analysis book
of the twentieth century. But Zygmund himself said that he give up writing 30
papers in order to pen the volume. You may want to do a similar estimation
before you sit down to write your own book. How will this project impact
your career? Will the overall eﬀect be favorable? If you are a signiﬁcant
7These days it is quite common to use the Web to keep your book up to date. That
way you need not worry that important new theorems are being proved even while your
book is in press. And you can also post ancillary graphics, extra examples, non-standard
exercises, animated diagrams, and variety of other resources. Often your publisher will
help you to develop a Web site for your book. In many instances the publisher will insist
on it.

84
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
person in your ﬁeld and you let your colleagues around the world know that
you are setting time aside to write the book in your subject, then it is likely
that they will be very supportive. They may even help. But you are the
person who has to carry the weight. It is a long haul and you must stay the
course to the bitter end. You don’t beneﬁt anyone if you don’t ﬁnish the
project and just end up with a stack of notes sitting on your shelf. Talk this
project up with your trusted friends and advisors before you ever set pen to
paper.
On top of all that, you must gird your loins and ﬁgure out how to deal
with a publisher. This is really not at all like dealing with a journal—which
is primarily doing business with fellow academics. Often when you publish a
book you are dealing with a commercial publisher. Publishing is a business,
and business people have methods and values which may not be familiar or
comfortable. You must talk about scheduling, copy editing, royalties, and
a variety of other issues in a manner which some people ﬁnd confusing and
others ﬁnd oﬀensive. The book [KRA4] can give you some guidance in the
matter.
Writing a book is rewarding and can be important.
But it can take
a lot out of your life, and in fact can even alter your life.
It can aﬀect
your personal relationships, particularly the amount of time that you have
available to spend with your family. You should think carefully before you
embark on this road. Time management is also a crucial part of the process.
If you cannot manage your time in the small, you will have a much harder
time getting your act together with a project as big as a book.
Far too
often does it happen that a book gets started with a great ﬂush of energy
and enthusiasm, but ultimately it peters out and never gets completed (or
published). That is really too bad, and also a waste of time and energy. You
are much better oﬀto know what you are getting into and to plan how you
will execute and complete the project—before you ever set pen to paper.
You also should be aware that bookwriting is not necessarily rewarded
in the same way that paperwriting is. Generally speaking, bookwriting is
not seen as doing research. True, Andr´e Weil’s Basic Number Theory [WEI]
proved the Riemann hypothesis for function ﬁelds over ﬁnite ﬁelds. The re-
cent book by Harris and Taylor [HAT] proved the local Langlands conjecture.
But these are the exceptions rather than the rule. Books tend to be exposi-
tion, and exposition is valuable. But it is not proving theorems. And your

4.7. WORKING ON YOUR OWN
85
Chair and your Dean know it.8
4.7
Working on Your Own
The default mode of work in the academic mathematics profession is to labor
away on your own. You are the single-combat warrior. It is you against some
large problem, or group of problems. If you win—if you defeat the problem—
then the victory is all yours and you can revel (however brieﬂy) in the glory.
You are like David defeating Goliath or Siegfried defeating Fafnir the dragon.
Likewise, if you lose, then you are nothing. You have nothing achieved, and
have nothing to show.
It is a tough life to cut out for yourself, with potential big wins and
possibly catastrophic losses. You can not only fail to solve your problem,
you could also lose your peace of mind, your mental stability, your friends,
and your marriage. I kid you not: it is a zero-one game in the strongest sense
of the word. Look what happened to John Nash [NAS]. Or Grisha Perelman
[NAG].
But there is another way to look at the matter. All the best mathemati-
cians that I know are masters at snatching victory from the jaws of defeat.
From a distance, it may look as though they bound from success to success,
solving one big problem after another. This really is not true. Like most
of us they end up sticking most of their work in the ﬁling cabinet or the
trash bin. But they have a specially developed skill for looking at a heap of
calculations, and six months of trials and errors, and eliciting something of
value from it. A weak or uncertain mind would just scoop up all the paper
and dump it in the circular ﬁle. A more creative mind will think things over
and say, “Well, I didn’t solve the big problem, but look at what I’ve learned.
There are some new connections here, and that elucidates this other point.”
And before you know it he/she has written a terriﬁc paper.
The advantage of working on your own, the joy of it, is that you can
do your work whenever you like—sitting in your oﬃce, or going for a walk,
or playing pool, or swimming, or mowing the lawn. You can work at your
8I would be remiss not to observe that diﬀerent institutions have diﬀerent value systems.
The comprehensive universities view scholarship in perhaps a diﬀerent manner than does
Princeton or Harvard. If a comprehensive university faculty member writes a textbook,
then that is considered to be a notable achievement, and it is duly rewarded. Publication
of papers is too, of course.

86
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
own pace, and explore any diversions or byways that strike your fancy. Who
knows what gold you may strike?
The disadvantage is that you could easily become discouraged, demoral-
ized, depressed. You could decide to give up, change careers, take a diﬀerent
job. These days almost everyone collaborates, and there is plenty of good
reason to do so. Mathematics has become large and unwieldy. The problems
are immense, and can be overwhelming. It is a great help to have a sounding
board, a reality check, a veriﬁer that only another person can be.
Even if you don’t collaborate, you should treat mathematics as a par-
ticipatory endeavor. Talk to people. Go to seminars. Attend conferences.
Participate in the International Congress of Mathematicians. Publish pa-
pers. Read the Notices. Play the game. It is comforting to be part of the
process, and part of the life. It will keep you strong and focused, and help
you to move ahead.
4.8
Working in Collaboration
One of the joys of modern scholarly life in mathematics is writing papers
with your friends and colleagues. Eighty years ago, when Hardy and Little-
wood were producing their 100 joint papers, such collaboration was virtually
unheard of. Now it is the norm.
Much of modern mathematics is cross-disciplinary—a marriage of analysis
and geometry, or PDE and Lie groups, or logic and algebra (to name just
a few). This makes the subject richer and more diverse, but it also makes
it more complex. It is rather more diﬃcult for a lone individual to make
any progress. Put another way, it is very natural for people from diﬀerent
disciplines to get together to work on a problem that uses ideas from all those
disciplines.
I have written more than 150 papers, and at least half of them are joint.
Working with other mathematicians is an essential part of my professional
life. I generate new ideas naturally and with pleasure while drinking a beer
with a colleague, while having a “math rap session” at the blackboard, or in
the debrieﬁng after an interesting talk. Working alone, it is easy to become
discouraged and confused. Having a collaborator can give you strength, give
you someone oﬀof whom you can bounce your ideas, give you a regular
re-centering of your course.
If you want your collaborations to proceed smoothly and salubriously, if

4.8. WORKING IN COLLABORATION
87
you want everyone to be happy at the end so that you can all look forward to
fortuitous future collaborations, then there are certain precepts of courtesy
and professionalism that ought to be followed:
• Usually the question of who will do what, and who will contribute what,
is answered automatically as the ideas develop. Everyone should really
want to be part of this team. Everyone should really want to pitch in.
When a new task comes up, you don’t expect to hear, “Oh, I’ve got to
go do my gardening this week.” Instead you expect to hear, “That’s
important. I’ll write a draft and show it to the rest of you.” or “That’s
the sort of calculation that I like to do. Let me try it.”
• Nobody should worry about who gets credit for what.
Mathemati-
cal collaborations are democratic endeavors, and all the participants
are equals.
The custom (unlike in other sciences) is to list the au-
thors alphabetically. So there should be no squabbling over priorities
or ranking. It often will be true that, on a given paper, the second
author (named Zymurgy) made a greater contribution than the ﬁrst
author (named Aardvaark). But that is liable to be reversed in the
next paper. In any event, it is counterproductive and damaging to the
psyche to spend time worrying about these pecadilloes. The point of
collaboration is to contribute what you can and derive from it what
you can. If at the end it turns out to be not entirely satisfactory, then
everyone can shake hands and go their separate ways. There are many
other ﬁsh in the sea.
• Part of your job as a collaborator is to provide moral support for your
co-workers. Some of the work will be diﬃcult and confusing, other
parts will be long and tedious. You can take some pleasure, and learn
something yourself in the process, by explaining some of the ideas to
your team-mates.
• Everyone brings something diﬀerent to the altar. Some are good at
concepts, others at calculation. Some shine at writing the stuﬀup,
others at posing the critical questions. It is essential that each of the
collaborators respects and appreciates the other collaborators and what
they have to give to the project.
• Everyone should bend over backwards to be courteous to everyone else.

88
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
You want to exercise some care in choosing your collaborators. There is
one guy in my ﬁeld who has a universal reputation as a rapscallion, a thief, a
charlatan, and a misanthrope. I won’t even talk to him much less collaborate
with him. I usually pick collaborators whom I like, with whom I have a lot
in common, and who share my interests and goals. This takes place fairly
naturally, and has led to many happy team eﬀorts. I hope that you have a
similar experience.
4.9
Publishing Papers
The books [KRA2] and [KRA4] also contain detailed discussions of how to
get a paper published. This is a necessary part of the process, and not a
trivial one. But it need not be an ordeal. We provide here a brief discussion
(see also [KRA5]).
The advent of the Internet has changed everyone’s view of what profes-
sional publishing is, and also of what it means. Certainly after you write
your new paper it is quite simple to post it on the Internet. For mathemati-
cians these days the canonical place to put your paper is the preprint server
arXiv. Originally created by Alan Ginsparg at Los Alamos and now hosted
by Cornell University, this is where mathematicians from all ﬁelds put their
work as soon as it is created. As of today, about 10% of all new mathematics
papers are posted on arXiv, but the number is growing steadily. There are
many other places to post papers, including departmental Web sites and spe-
cialty Web sites for particular subject areas like K-theory or linear algebraic
groups. You can post your work on one preprint server or many. There are
no restrictions.
The point of confusion that I wish to discuss here is whether putting your
work on an Internet preprint server is actually publishing it. In some technical
sense it certainly is. For you are setting your ideas before a broad audience
(in fact, in principle, the entire world) and opening yourself up for criticism
and discussion. That is what the academic/scholarly life is all about. So it is
good. Certainly when Nathan Seiberg and Ed Witten posted their ideas on
the Web about what are now called the Seiberg/Witten equations it caused
a major upheaval in modern gauge theory. This is an example in which the
Internet played a decisive role in making things happen quickly. For a couple
of years theoretical physics was not the same.
But Sieberg and Witten ultimately published their ideas in a standard

4.10. BEING A REFEREE
89
venue (the Journal of High Energy Physics)—that is to say, a recognized,
refereed, scholarly journal. There are lots of good reasons for doing so. First
of all, peer review is a form of validation for your work. When you pick
up the latest issue of the Annals of Mathematics or Acta Mathematica, you
know that the papers inside have been very carefully reviewed and vetted.
Thus the time that you spend with these papers is likely to be worthwhile
and rewarding. Perhaps most signiﬁcantly, if you are up for tenure or for a
promotion, or for some other signal form of recognition, then peer-reviewed
journals are what counts. This is what the Dean sees as the ultimate ﬁlter
for solid, respected academic work. If he/she is going to grant lifetime tenure
to a candidate, then he/she is going to want to know that this candidate has
published signiﬁcant scholarly material that has been reviewed and validated
and given a stamp of approval by other recognized scholars.
Put in other words, the good news about the Internet is that it gets your
work out there rapidly, cheaply, and to a very broad audience. The bad
news is that it sits in an undiﬀerentiated sea of literally billions of electronic
documents.
We need some mechanism to determine what (mathematical
and otherwise) is of value and what is perhaps safely passed over.
You
want your Curriculum Vitae to show quite plainly that you are a scholar of
some accomplishment whose work is recognized and valued by the scholarly
community. Traditional, peer-reviewed journals are the way to get this done.
There are also questions of archiving. Traditional hard-copy journals and
books are archived by putting a thousand copies in a thousand diﬀerent
libraries around the world. Each copy is stable, and the likelihood of all
copies disappearing is slight. Electronic media can also have mirror copies,
backup copies, disaster backups, and so forth. But each copy is unstable, and
sunspots or other natural disasters could wipe out all copies at once. There
is still much to learn about the archiving of electronic media. The source
[KRA4] explores these questions in some detail.
4.10
Being a Referee
After you have become an established mathematician then you will no doubt
be asked to referee papers, or even books. In the case of a paper, there is no
monetary reward for the job—you do it as part of your professional activity.
For reviewing a book there is usually a modest honorarium.
Almost all refereeing is done blind. That means that the author will not

90
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
learn your identity as the referee. This gives you license to say whatever
you like. But you should exercise that license with dignity and restraint.
The right view of the matter is that your are trying to help the author to
function as a scholar. Your job as referee is to determine whether this item
(a paper or a book) ought to be published. Along the way you can help
the author with his/her writing, his/her scholarship, and of course his/her
mathematics. This should all be done in a proactive manner, just as you
would want a referee of one of your works to do.
I sometimes fall oﬀthe wagon—if I think that an author has been im-
mensely careless or sloppy or irresponsible or just plain stupid. Or if he/she
has not adequately cited my own work. I may just lose it, and say a number
of uncharitable things. But I always regret it. Most of the time authors
are immensely appreciative of my input, and say so (the editor is then good
enough to share the sentiment with me, while maintaining my anonymity).
A good referee’s report should tell the editor (of the journal or of the
publishing house) some of the following things:
• Is this paper/book timely?
• Is it interesting?
• Is it correct?
• Is it written in an attractive manner?
• Are the references complete and accurate?
• Are the graphics well-rendered?
• Is the length suitable?
• Is the result suﬃciently important to be published (this query applies
mainly to research papers, but the spirit of the question could apply to
most any piece of writing)?
• Is this author the write person to have written this piece?
Of course you are free, if you wish, to include a list of errata or typos or
errors in English syntax. You may suggest useful references or alternative
proofs.

4.10. BEING A REFEREE
91
A short paper can have a short referee’s report—of a page or so. A longer
paper, purporting to prove a truly signiﬁcant result, probably requires a more
detailed analysis, of perhaps several pages.
Now the referee must surely
consider all the points adumbrated above, but also might address:
• Whether this is the best approach to the result;
• Whether there is a more eﬃcient or more ideal way of proving these
theorems;
• Whether the paper takes into account the existing literature and the
known approaches;
• Whether the content and substance of the paper justify the length;
• Whether the List of References is careful and complete;
• Whether the paper has a good introduction and a good historical
overview, placing this new work into a meaningful context;
• Whether the paper is well-organized and easy to read;
• Whether the paper makes its points clearly, enunciates its results suc-
cinctly, and proves the the theorems cogently.
• Whether the paper is signiﬁcant, or the “ﬁnal word” in a ﬁeld, or solves
an important problem.
Now a report of three pages or more could well be justiﬁed. Some detail is
expected by the Associate Editor handling the paper.
For a longer paper,
purporting to prove a truly signiﬁcant result, perhaps a more detailed report
is in order. Now the referee must surely consider all the points adumbrated
above, but also might address:
• Whether this is the best approach to the result;
• Whether there is a more eﬃcient or more ideal way of proving these
theorems;
• Whether the paper takes into account the existing literature and the
known approaches;
• Whether the content and substance of the paper justify the length;

92
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
• Whether the List of References is careful and complete;
• Whether the paper has a good introduction and a good historical
overview, placing this new work into a meaningful context;
• Whether the paper is well-organized and easy to read;
• Whether the paper makes its points clearly, enunciates its results suc-
cinctly, and proves the the theorems cogently.
• Whether the paper is signiﬁcant, or the “ﬁnal word” in a ﬁeld, or solves
an important problem.
Now a report of three pages or more could well be justiﬁed. Some detail is
expected by the Associate Editor handling the paper.
Your referee’s report should be of a length suitable to the task. A referee’s
report for a paper can be a couple of pages. That for a book could be longer.
You need to say what needs to be said, and make the points that are essential.
No more and no less.
And you need to be timely. A referee’s report that takes you four years
to produce is not going to be all that helpful either to the publisher or to the
author. The editor requesting the referee’s report will give you an indication
of when he/she needs it. If you cannot come close to meeting the deadline,
then you should decline the job. Conversely, if you accept the job then strive
to meet the deadline. It is really your professional obligation.
4.11
How to Apply for a Grant
In this country the main source of funding for pure mathematical research
is the National Science Foundation (NSF). The NSF can give you a grant to
support your work during the summer—pay you a summer salary, subsidize
your travel, support your graduate students.9 Or it can provide money to
help you run a lab, employ postdocs, buy computer equipment. The NSF
can also subvent a conference that you are running. In addition, the NSF has
considerable funds these days to support teaching and educational activities.
9Today the NSF supports fewer than 1/3 of those who apply for grants in pure mathe-
matics. But many fewer mathematicians even apply today, just because money is so tight
and grants are so hard to get.

4.11. HOW TO APPLY FOR A GRANT
93
Support for mathematics is not limited to the National Science Founda-
tion. The Department of Education has the important GAANN program
(Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need) that provides subsidy to
graduate studies for students in subject areas (such as mathematics) that
are perceived to be critical to the national welfare. The Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) provides copious funding for defense-
related research—much of it mathematical. The Oﬃce of Naval Research
(ONR) has traditionally been a steady funder of mathematics. The Depart-
ment of Energy (DOE) has generously funded research in minimal surfaces
and mathematical areas that are perceived to be relevant to oil exploration
and other energy sources.
You can imagine that each of these funding agencies has its own paradigms
and its own needs and its own formalities for applying for funding. We cannot
cover them all here. What we shall do instead is to very brieﬂy describe some
general principles for applying for a grant with any agency (this could even be
a private philanthropical organization—such as the Templeton Foundation).
Good general guidelines are:
• Make your writing shine.
Your grant proposal will not merely be
reviewed by mathematicians. All sorts of administrators and cross-
disciplinary committees and other ﬁltering mechanisms will be looking
at your prose. So make it clear, concise, compelling, complete, and
accurate.
• Your writing should not be too technical. Of course you want to be
precise and on point and to say what must be said. It certainly will not
do to say, “I’m going to work on a hard problem. Send some money
to help me along.”
But if your grant proposal is as recondite as a
research paper then even the experts will have trouble slugging their
way through it (since those reviewing the proposal will not be in their
research-paper-reading mode). Provide more than the usual amount of
explanation and background. Give examples. Help to bring the reader
up to speed. Bear in mind that not all readers of your proposal will be
experts, or even mathematicians.
• Most every granting organization has strict technical rules about how
to formulate a proposal. This could include (a) page margins, (b) type
font, (c) length of each section of the proposal, (d) topics to be covered,

94
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
and many others. You must follow these rules strictly and accurately
or, likely as not, your proposal will simply be returned unread.
• You must ﬁnd out what the funding agency is after and you must
speak to those needs. The NSF (for instance) is looking for cutting edge
research that will advance the cause of basic science, and will beneﬁt the
quality of life in this country. You must describe mathematical research
that is current, of broad interest, and will have a real impact. You must
be able to describe what your contribution is likely to be without making
it sound as though you have already solved the problem.
You must
give careful descriptions of the work that has already been done (by
others and by yourself) and how your program will ﬁt into that context.
You must give detailed references to the literature.
Other funding
agencies will have diﬀerent criteria.
The Department of Education
is looking at educational goals.
The Department of Energy has an
agenda that is dedicated to the advancement of energy research. The
Templeton Foundation (which does in fact fund mathematical research)
is primarily interested in creating a marriage between spirituality and
science.
• In the context of the previous bulleted point, you must describe the
milieu into which your work ﬁts. There is an ongoing ﬂow of frontline
research in your subject area; how does your contribution ﬁt in? How
will it advance that ﬂow?
You must describe previous results and
partial results—both your own and those of other workers in the ﬁeld.
You must make it clear that you know your subject inside out, and what
everyone is thinking. You must know the implications of the work you
propose to do, and what signiﬁcant consequences it may have. You
must describe in detail your plans for future investigations, because
after all that is what this granting agency is supposed to be funding.
• Your proposal must be ambitious and impressive, but it also must be
realistic. I once refereed a grant proposal in which the PI (Principal
Investigator) proposed to ﬁrst prove the Riemann hypothesis, then the
Poincar´e conjecture, then the Hodge conjecture. This from someone
who had not written three papers in the past ten years. It rapidly
became clear that this particular PI was just having us all on.
Of
course your proposal will not read like that. The main point is that
you want to propose to work on problems, and to achieve results, that

4.11. HOW TO APPLY FOR A GRANT
95
it is realistic (based on your track record) to expect that you can shape
and contribute to.
• You must be punctual. Most every granting agency has strict deadlines
for submission of a proposal.10 If you miss the date, then most likely
your proposal will be returned unread.
If you are fairly new to the grant game, then you will ﬁnd it eminently
useful to have a senior academic, one who has (presumably successfully)
submitted many grant proposals, look over your draft proposal. If you are
lucky perhaps you can get someone who has served on an NSF review panel
lately.11 Listen carefully to his/her suggestions and make whatever changes
are needed. You are going to have to exercise some time management skills
here, as you must have time to get your draft written, to have friends and
colleagues vett it for you, and also to have the departmental staﬀhelp you
prepare the budget. Preparing a grant budget is a highly complex and convo-
luted activity that involves many levels of university administration. There
are cost-sharing and other issues that are way beyond most of us. The main
thing that you need to know is that it may take an extra two weeks to hammer
out the budget for your proposal. But you still need to meet the advertised
deadline.
A closing thought is this. Universities and colleges like grants. First,
faculty who have grants add to the prestige of the institution. Second, many
grants kick back a percentage of the bottom line to the host institution.12
So there is a ﬁduciary beneﬁt. Third, having a grant is a measure of your
scholarly quality. It shows that your work stands up to outside peer review.
It looks just terriﬁc in your tenure or promotion dossier. So you want to
learn how to apply for grants and you want to do it.
10Sometimes instead of a deadline there is a “target date,” and that is more ﬂexible.
11The National Science Foundations ﬂies in teams of mathematicians to review all the
grant proposals in a particular subject area in any given year.
The panel spends two
or three days reviewing and discussing the proposals in detail, and then ranking them.
Depending on how much money is available, the top cut in this ranking gets the grants.
The others do not.
12This money is called Overhead, or sometimes Cost Sharing or Indirect Costs.

CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
4.12
How to Give a Talk
Certainly part and parcel of the mathematical research/education life is giv-
ing talks. People ﬁnd talks to be much more accessible than formal research
papers. Without a doubt the published research paper is the way we plant
our ﬂag, record our ideas for the record, and establish an archive for progress
in the subject. But if we want to acquaint our colleagues with the latest
breakthroughs in the ﬁeld, then a ﬁfty-minute talk is a good device for the
purpose.13
The basic precepts of how to give a good talk are recorded in [KRA2].
We shall not repeat all the details here. Delightful treatments of the topic
also appears in [MCC] and [JON]. Many of these guidelines are similar to
ones we have already enunciated for writing a good paper. But they take a
slightly diﬀerent form for oral presentation, and are worth repeating:
• Know your audience. Are you addressing the faculty at Harvard, or an
annual meeting of the Mathematical Association of America, or perhaps
the undergraduates at Bryn Mawr? Each of these putative audiences
has diﬀerent backgrounds, diﬀerent expectations, and diﬀerent needs.
It is your job to endeavor to meet your audience halfway.
• Know your subject matter. Well, you should. Typically this is material
you have created, in which you have immersed yourself for the past
year or two. You almost certainly know more about the topic than
anyone else in the room.
Nonetheless, you should prepare carefully
and have everything down cold. Have all the deﬁnitions and key results
written out succinctly in your notes so that you will not stumble when
presenting them to an audience. Have an outline of your main topics
that you can reference to orient yourself during the talk. Have all your

• Be organized. Remember that your job is ﬁrst to bring your audience
up to speed, so that it is prepared to hear what your latest hot new

At one point during one

room.
Consulted later, Sammy allowed that Mac Lane had given him a terriﬁc idea,

mathematical history.

idea is. You cannot just drop it on them cold. You must acquaint them
with the terminology and key ideas, bolstered by meaningful examples,
so that they are ready to appreciate all the new material that you will
present. Introduce all notation and deﬁnitions that you will need be-
fore you actually use them. Give meaningful—even exciting—examples
whenever you can. Draw pictures. The lecture is both an auditory and
a visual experience. Take advantage of both.
• Punctuate your talk with milestones. These can be important illustra-
tions, nice examples, memorable results, key ideas, brilliant deﬁnitions,
or startling applications. The main point is that you don’t want your
presentation to be a dreary monotone, uninﬂected by any excitement
or insight. Both the style of your presentation and the content of your
presentation should give the audience a sense of a compelling ﬂow of
ideas marked by key results and inspiring acuity.
• Practice, practice, practice. When I rehearse a talk today, I just sit
in a chair and run through the notes—thinking about various junc-
tures in the presentation and how to make them work. But I am an
accomplished speaker of considerable experience. If you are a tyro,
then you will want to actually practice in front of an audience—a small
group of friends, colleagues, and students. One standard device, if you
are scheduled to give an important lecture at an AMS meeting, or at
Harvard, or at the University of Paris, is to give a practice lecture to
your local seminar. In the latter context, you have a group of trusted
colleagues—people who really know you and know your strengths and
weaknesses—who will help you along and aid you in crafting the most
eﬀective possible presentation.
• Think about the physical nature of your presentation. If you are going
to use a blackboard or whiteboard, then learn how to do so eﬀectively.
Write so that your thoughts can be read and appreciated. Organize
things visually. Do not stand in front of what you write. If instead
you are going to use an overhead projector, then learn how to prepare
a good and eﬀective overhead slide. Don’t put too much on each slide;
better to put too little. Learn to pace yourself: It is all too easy to
race through your overhead slides. These days it is popular to give
math talks using PowerPoint or the LATEX alternative Beamer for PC
computers or KeyNote for Macintosh computers. This is great, and

98
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
can be visually stunning, but again you must learn how to use the
medium eﬀectively. No matter how well-intentioned you are, if you
cannot use your tools properly then you are going to be a failure as a
communicator.
• The use of electronic slides can help you with the pacing of your talk,
but this matter will require some thought. Since the slides are prepared
in advance, there is a tendency to ﬂip through them too quickly during
your presentation. You already know what is on them, so you are not
reading them in real time during your talk. But the audience must.
And if you are clicking and advancing too rapidly, then nobody will
be able to complete their internalization of any of the slides.
As a
result, the audience will get lost and your talk will be a ﬂop. People
need time to ponder each slide a bit as you talk. They will refer to
the written words several times as they listen to your remarks. So the
pace should be leisurely. About one slide per minute—with not very
much written on each slide—is the most that you should attempt in
your visual presentation.
I have heard talks by good mathematicians in which the mathe-
matician has a *.pdf ﬁle of his/her latest paper on the computer and
simply ﬂips through it on-screen while talking about it. This is dread-
ful. Typically the paper is in 10 point type, and there are upwards of
30 lines per page. It is nearly impossible to follow such a visual presen-
tation. It is too dense, and there is too much of it on each screen. A
typical slide in a math talk should have about six lines, and be in very
large type. And the lines should be well spaced apart. The Web sites

• If you are going to be using technology in your talk, arrange to check
out the room in advance.
Some lecture rooms have built-in, rather
elaborate computer facilities with projectors, sound systems, multiple
screens, and so forth. It requires a little time and eﬀort to ﬁgure out
how everything works, and you will likely need some help from the
locals. The other option is that a portable computer, a portable pro-
jector, and a portable screen will be carried into the room. This will
require some setup, and you will need to familiarize yourself with how
everything works.
I once gave a large public lecture—in Australia!—in which I was
displaying computer code on the screen and then compiling it in real
time to reveal a displayed graphic. I was working in a room with top-
notch, state-of-the-art equipment, none of which I understood. I was
as nervous as a cat. If the system got hung up in the middle of my talk
then everything would be ruined. I spent a good part of the afternoon
(the talk was in the evening) checking and re-checking the system,
running through the computer routines, making sure everything worked
as it should. And I was glad that I did. When I gave the talk I was
conﬁdent and in control, and everything came oﬀas I had hoped.

100
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
• It is rarely optimal, or eﬀective, to actually explain the deﬁnitive ver-
sion of your theorem. Cutting edge mathematics tends to be rather
technical—after all, you have solved a problem posed by experts for
other experts; you are answering a question that only the cognoscenti
can appreciate fully. When you give a talk, your job is to convey the
ideas to a broader audience. So you might state the optimal version
of your theorem (but I would hesitate even to do that); the explana-
tions will probably be most apposite and most compelling if they are
directed to a special case, or a restricted version of the result.
You certainly, certainly cannot present the full proof (if you can, then
your result is probably fairly trivial and you should not be giving the
talk in the ﬁrst place). And you should not even consider attempting
to do so. Rather, give an indication of what the proof is about. Draw
a picture. Indicate the key techniques. Mention a classical technique
that inspires your methodology; do an illustrative calculation—if it is
interesting and indicative of the big picture; state a pivotal lemma
(but don’t prove it); discuss a compelling consequence. The point is
that your job is to dance around your result and create a sense of
understanding with your audience. Your job is not to teach them the
proof. And you cannot do it, so don’t even try.
Gian-Carlo Rota said that your audience at a colloquium is like a
herd of cows. You should only present these heifers with one idea, and
gently lead them this way or that way. Two ideas will confuse them.
Three ideas will create pandemonium.
You are like the pied piper,
playing his ﬂute and leading them on an entertaining journey. You are
not teaching them to drink from a ﬁrehose.
• Do not, please do not, run overtime. It’s rude, it shows disorganization
and lack of professionalism on your part, and it is ineﬀective. After
about ﬁfty minutes, your audience is simply going to shut down. You
will be standing up there talking to yourself. What’s the point? Your
preparation for your talk (which should be considerable) should provide
a number of diﬀerent exit points so that you can gracefully wrap things
up after 50 minutes (or whatever is the designated time slot). It is very
bad form to, after 45 minutes, start telling your audience that you don’t
have enough time, that you won’t be able to present all your brilliant
ideas, that you should have been allotted more time. Ridiculous. This

is your show, and you are completely in control. Exercise that control
by putting on a good exposition that ﬁts into the given time window.
All the real pros—from Ed Witten to Enrico Bombieri to Jean-Pierre
Serre—always ﬁt their remarks into the given time. And they probably
have a lot more to say than you do. So follow the model of our leaders
and give a talk that is of the right length. It will be more eﬀective, and
certainly better received.
• Have a nice conclusion. Don’t just say, “Well, I guess I’m out of time.”
or “I think I’ll stop there.” or “That’s all, folks.” You can do better
than that. Draw together the ideas. Review your main points. Reiter-
ate the substance of your main result. Point to some ideas for future
work. Give the audience something to take home and mull over (see
[HAL] for the thoughts of a real master on this point). It’s the least
you can do.
4.13
Graduate Teaching
Certainly a part of faculty life that is immensely fulﬁlling and rewarding is
graduate student teaching. It is a real plum to teach a graduate course in
a subject area of your particular interest. This can mesh nicely with your
research program, it can be a source of new ideas, and it can be a way to
attract Ph.D. students. An advanced graduate course or seminar can lead to
a nice new book or monograph. It can lead to a joint project with some of
the students, or with a fellow faculty member who is sitting in on the course.
Teaching a graduate course can be a great deal of work. If the topic is
a well established subject in which there are a number of good texts, then
you can teach the course just by following a well-chosen text. If not, then
you will be developing the material from scratch—often by reading original
papers. In some cases you will be working out the material yourself from ﬁrst
principles. I have taught courses in which I was madly slaving away proving
the theorems for the ﬁrst time the night before my lecture! Of course the
payoﬀis that you are developing new mathematics while you are teaching.
This could lead to a new paper, or at least to some new insights that will be
valuable in your future explorations.
At Princeton University every tenured faculty member teaches an under-
graduate course each semester and and advanced graduate course in his/her

102
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
research area each semester. This is one of the perks of teaching at a ﬁrst-class
department. At other schools it is a real plum to get to teach an advanced
graduate course in your subject area.
There are only so many graduate
students who are at the right level, your department has many other teach-
ing obligations, and so only so many advanced grad courses can be oﬀered
each semester. It is also the case that most schools have an administration-
mandated minimum enrollment in order for a course to run. If you cannot
attract ﬁve students then your course dies (unless you are willing to teach it
for love, and receive no teaching credits for your eﬀorts). In any event, there
is competition among the faculty for the privilege of teaching an advanced
course. Your bread and butter, indeed the Department’s bread and butter,
is teaching calculus, statistics, linear algebra, and the like. That is what you
will teach most of the time. The fun stuﬀis to teach upper division courses
and basic qualifying-exam-level courese. But the real treat is to teach an
advanced course on your pet research topic. You will get to do that every
three years or so. And you should make the most of it.
Of course if you, yourself have a lot of Ph.D students then they have to
take your course and therefore your course will surely run. If not, then you
may have to do some recruiting. At UCLA we actually did some horsetrading
in this regard: Faculty Member A would go to Faculty member B and say,
“I’ll make my graduate students take your course if you will make your
graduate students take my course.”
And then everyone would be happy
(except, perhaps, for the students).
Another form of graduate teaching is the qualifying exam courses. These
are basic real analysis, basic complex analysis, basic abstract algebra, and
basic geometry. At some schools we might add numerical analysis, applied
mathematics, optimization, algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, partial
diﬀerential equations, and a number of other topics to the list. These courses
are fun because they are real mathematics: You get to state theorems and
prove them. You don’t have to worry too much about the level or the prepa-
ration of your students; you know exactly who the audience is. And they are
usually a serious and determined group, because they are preparing for their
quals.
One new wrinkle that has been introduced into the teaching of the qualifying-
exam-level real analysis course (a large part of which is measure theory) is
that, these days, a good many of the students are from Economics and Fi-
nance. That is because of the Black-Scholes theory of option pricing. This
Nobel-Prize-Winning work of Fisher Black and Myron Scholes used stochas-

4.14. DIRECTING A PH.D. THESIS
103
tic integrals to create the world’s ﬁrst option pricing scheme. It has really
revolutionized the world of ﬁnance, and it is very mathematical—at a very
rigorous level. So you will ﬁnd Finance students in your class struggling to
master measure theory. These are good and serious students, but not nec-
essarily as gifted in mathematics as one might like. They will struggle, and
you will ﬁnd yourself doing more hand-holding than is customary. But it is
still fun.
4.14
Directing a Ph.D. Thesis
I have written about the directing of a Ph.D. thesis from the point of view
of the student in [KRA3]. In this section I shall re-rexamine the matter from
the point of view of the thesis advisor.
Agreeing to direct a student’s Ph.D. thesis is a huge commitment. There
are few other obligations in life that compare. You will be having a close
and detailed relationship with this student for a period of three to ﬁve years.
You will be teaching him/her how to conduct a research life, how to wrestle
with a problem, how to deal with frustration and failure, what to do when
things aren’t working out.
You will meet with the Ph.D. student at least once per week. And more
frequently when things are hot or moving. You will be largely responsible
for getting this student a job if and when he/she ﬁnishes the program and
earns the degree. And, if things go well (as they should), then you will have
a lifelong relationship with this student. A former Ph.D. student can become
a good friend, a collaborator, a conﬁdante, and more.
So you do not agree to direct someone’s Ph.D. thesis lightly. You really
ought to get to know him/her ﬁrst. The person might have been a student in
one of your advanced classes, and then taken a reading course from you on a
more advanced topic. The student might have asked you to be a mentor for
some talk or project that is part of the Department’s graduate requirements.
You could have gotten to know the student through a seminar or even on a
Departmental retreat or ﬁeld trip.
The point is that you need to have some sense of whether this is a person
with whom you are compatible, with whom you can communicate eﬀectively,
with whom you are comfortable. Will you look forward to seeing this student
each week, or will you want to just crawl under the desk? Will you be proud
to tell your friends and colleagues that this person was your Ph.D. student,

104
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
or will you wish that you had never even met this person?
These are nontrivial considerations, and ones that must be taken seriously.
There are some students who bounce around from thesis advisor to thesis
advisor, spending a year with this one and eight months with that one.
Probably you don’t want to be the next in line. At the least, if a student
you are unsure of comes and asks you to direct the thesis, then go to the
Departmental Oﬃce and ask to see the student’s record. Talk to colleagues
about the student. Consult the Vice-Chair for Graduate Studies. Chat up
the Chair of the Math Department.
Directing a Ph.D. thesis can certainly be one of the most rewarding fea-
tures of academic life. But it can take a lot out of you. Some have argued
that directing a Ph.D. thesis is giving up seven papers that one might have
written. I don’t know how one makes this estimation. I have certainly writ-
ten new papers because of my Ph.D. students, and I have also written very
good papers with my Ph.D. students. I can’t think of any paper or work that
I gave up because of a student. Certainly I gave some of my time, but I’ve
always felt rewarded for it.
The Mathematical Genealogy project
http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu
reports that Roger Temam (among contemporary mathematicians) has had
100 Ph.D. students. That is the record. Andrei Kolmogorov had 79 and
David Hilbert had 75. I myself have had 16 students, and that puts me in
a club with just 159 members. Most mathematicians have just a handful
of students—ﬁve or fewer. Having a student is just so much work, and not
everyone is up to it. The great Henri Poincar´e had only two students. Harish
Chandra had none.
If a student comes to you and asks you to direct his/her Ph.D. thesis, take
the matter very seriously. Saying “yes” will be one of your more important
decisions, and it could be one of the most rewarding ones.
4.15
Professional Travel
A colleague of mine once remarked that, even though he was not wealthy, he
felt as though he were wealthy. What this meant was that he got to travel
to far-ﬂung parts of the world and meet all sorts of interesting people and
see exotic places.

4.15. PROFESSIONAL TRAVEL
105
Certainly this is one of the notable perks of academic life. Especially if
you publish, and if your work is appreciated, you will get invitations from
all sorts of places—to spend a few days, or a week, or a month, or perhaps a
semester or a year. You could even get oﬀered a permanent job, but let me
save that particular topic for another part of this book.
Usually an invitation of this sort includes a promise to pay your travel
expenses—hotel and airfare at the least. It could also include a per diem
(to cover meals and incidentals). And it could include an honorarium. The
bottom line is that, basically, you get to travel for free. And the price you
pay is that you must give one or more talks and you must hang out and talk
with the other mathematicians. Not a bad gig.
Some invitations—such as an invitation to give a talk in a Special Session
at an AMS meeting—will include no oﬀer of subvention whatever.
Just
because there are no funds for these activities. The hope is that you will
have an NSF grant that will help to cover your expenses, or perhaps your
department will kick in some funds.
NSF grants are getting harder and
harder to obtain: there are many more topnotch people applying and—what
with all the federally funded math institutes and all the new NSF programs—
fewer funds. Departments are also strapped for money, but there is almost
always some sort of fund to help defray travel costs for faculty. Chances are
that your department will be delighted to know that you’ve received a nice
invitation; it will bend over backwards to ﬁnd some funds for you.
There are actually many more paradigms for funding your travel than
the above discussion reveals. For instance, if you are invited to a conference
at the International Research Center at Banﬀ, you will be oﬀered free room
and board during your stay. But you must ﬁnd your own funds for the plane
fare. From Banﬀ’s point of view, this setup makes perfect sense. For their
funds are limited. Since they pay only room and board for each participant,
they know in advance exactly how much each participant will cost them.
They don’t have to deal with some poor scholar from Siberia who has a
$3000 plane ticket. If you are invited to spend time at the Mathematical
Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, you will be oﬀered some
ﬁxed stipend. For example, you might be invited to spend a semester and be
oﬀered $10,000. Of course that amount of money will not cover your costs
for ﬁve months, but it is seed money and the hope is that the rest of your
expenses will be covered by sabbatical funds or a grant.14
14An exception to what was just said about MSRI is that there are full stipends for

106
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
One unusual setup is the American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) in
Palo Alto, California. When you are invited to a one-week workshop at AIM,
then all your travel, all your hotel, plus a per diem are covered. There is no
other math institute in the world that can do this. AIM is funded in part by
the National Science Foundation and in part by Fry’s Electronics.
Sometimes you will have to spend some of your own resources to cover
your professional travel. Usually you will not. One nice feature of this type of
travel is that you can sometimes coordinate it with a personal trip. Perhaps
your spouse can join you at the end of the conference and you can spend
a week sightseeing (this option is probably more attractive in Paris than in
Detroit). Or your spouse can spend a week hanging out with you at the
conference—entertaining himself/herself during the day and socializing in
the evenings—and then you will have a week to yourselves. The professional
part of the trip is still tax deductible and/or reimbursable; the personal part
of the trip is of course “on you.”
4.16
Sabbatical Leaves
The word “sabbatical” has both Greek and Hebrew antecedents. It was a
custom among ancient Jewish farmers to take every seventh year oﬀ. Thus
it has come about that (at least in theory) every seventh year the Professor
gets a year oﬀ.
The purpose of the sabbatical is to give the professor some time to
recharge his batteries, to learn new things, to write a book or conduct a
collaboration. It is a way to help him/her keep his/her scholarly program
alive.
Well, like all good things in this life, the interpretation of what “sabbat-
ical” means has evolved, and it is going to vary considerably from school to
school.
At the University of California the situation is quite structured. For each
six terms that you teach you get a term oﬀ.
Period. You don’t have to
compete for it or justify it; it’s yours. You are given full salary during the
time oﬀ, and you can spend it building a house if you like (in fact I know
one professor at a U.C. campus who did just this, and he gave a student an
Independent Study Course to help him).
beginning mathematicians. These are actually a salary, and cover all expenses.

4.16. SABBATICAL LEAVES
107
At my own institution, after you give full service for six years then you
are entitled to a sabbatical. You can have one semester at full pay or a full
year at half pay. You don’t have to compete for this largesse; it is your right.
At a great many schools, especially state schools, you have to compete for
your sabbatical. The Dean only has so many to give out, and the number is
considerably fewer than the usual “rule of seven” would dictate. So you have
to ﬁll out some paperwork in order to convince the Dean that you deserve
a sabbatical.
This may include reminding the Dean of all the university
service you have been performing.
And it will certainly entail making a
convincing case that you are going oﬀfor a year or a semester to do something
worthwhile. For example, when I was at Penn State, it was a sureﬁre hit with
the Dean if you told him you had arranged to spend a year at Harvard to sit
at the feet of some Nobel Laureate to learn the latest ideas in string theory
(or pick your favorite hot area of scholarly activity); if instead you told the
Dean that you wanted to spend the year at the University of Southeast Idaho
to write a calculus textbook with your former Ph.D. student, then he was
less likely to be moved.
Let me stress that sabbaticals are not available to adjuncts and Instruc-
tors/Postdocs. The sabbatical is, along with tenure, one of the great perks
of being a tenure-track academic. You don’t need tenure (i.e., you don’t have
to be an Associate or full Professor) to take a sabbatical. You just have to
have punched the time clock for the right amount of time.15 The sabbatical
rules at your institution are public knowledge; be sure to apprise yourself of
the law of the land, and to avail yourself of this privilege whenever you can.
A ﬁnal note is this. Faculty also have opportunities to take “leaves of
absence”.
How does a leave diﬀer from a sabbatical?
Usually you take
a leave when some other institution oﬀers to pay your full—or at least a
substantial amount of your—salary and beneﬁts for the year or the semester.
This makes it easy for your Dean to let you go away for a time—because it
doesn’t cost the Dean anything. The Dean will start to get nervous if you
ask for a second year’s leave (because he will worry that you are not coming
back). Most Deans will absolutely forbid a third consecutive year of leave.
15Some Deans, like my own, are willing to be quite generous with sabbaticals for As-
sistant Professors. Of course if an Assistant Professor waits until his/her seventh year
to apply for a sabbatical, then he/she will already be tenured (or not). Our Dean, and
some other Deans, feels that a young scholar deserves this time without duties to develop
a strong research program. So he is willing to give a sabbatical to an Assistant Professor
with only three or four years in the saddle.

108
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
You can imagine that there are certain faculty who have manifold op-
portunities to take leaves: If you are a world-class scholar, recent winner of
the Fields Medal or the Wolf Prize, then of course every institution would
like to have you around for a while. If you do applied mathematics, then
perhaps NASA or some other government agency would like to have you as
a paid consultant. Maybe some big company—like Hughes Aircraft—would
like to put you on staﬀfor a year. It is easy to see how faculty may ﬁnd
these opportunities attractive, and it is also easy to see why the Dean wants
to keep them under control.
4.17
The Mathematics Research Institutes
Today, in the United States, there are seven federally funded Mathematics
Institutes. These include
• The Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley
• The American Institute of Mathematics in Palo Alto
• The Math Biology Institute in Columbus
• The Institute for Mathematics and its Applications in Minneapolis
• The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton
• The Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics at UCLA
• The Statistics and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute at Research
Triangle Park in North Carolina
And there are yet other institutes. The Clay Mathematics Institute in
Cambridge, Massachusetts is funded entirely by private money from venture
capitalist Landon Clay. The University of Maryland Math Department has
the Norbert Wiener Center for Harmonic Analysis and Applications.
In
Canada there is the Math Research Station at Banﬀand the Fields Institute
in Toronto. There is the Paciﬁc Institute of Mathematical Sciences. There
are a good many research institutes in Europe and Asia and other parts of
the world. Compared to 150 years ago, we have almost an embarrassment of
wealth when it comes to facilities to support mathematical research.

4.18. OUTSIDE OFFERS
109
What good do these institutes do for the average mathematician? First,
any of them is a great place to spend a sabbatical leave. You will be im-
mersed in a stimulating research atmosphere, away from the daily vagaries
of departmental life, be supported by a very professional and proactive staﬀ,
and surrounded by your colleagues. What more could you want?
It is also possible to organize an event at one of the Math Institutes.
This could range from a one-week conference or workshop to a semester-
long program. If you go to the Web page of any of the institutes it will
tell you the procedures for setting up a program and obtaining funding. Of
course it is not automatic. You apply to run a program and the institute’s
Scientiﬁc Board will review your proposal and make a decision. If the decision
is positive then all the resources and support mechanisms of the institution
will be put at your disposal. They will help with the invitations, with ﬁnding
housing for the participants, with providing facilities, and so forth. There
will also be money provided to help subvent the travel and living costs of the
participants. This will generally not be full funding; partial funding will be
oﬀered, and it is hoped that sabbatical support or perhaps grant funds can
provide the rest.
Even if you are not a registered member of a formal event at one of these
math institutes, most have an open-door policy. That means that, on your
own funds, you can drop in to hear lectures or participate in discussions
or often even take part in social events. Mathematics is a free and open
community and we welcome everyone to our activities.
4.18
Outside Oﬀers
If you are a bright and active mathematician working in an area of mathe-
matical research that is particularly hot, then your professional reputation
will be well and widely known. Your talents will be valued not just at your
home institution but across the profession.
Well, the truth of the matter is that your home institution can easily
become jaded. Once they’ve got you and given you tenure and given you
an oﬃce and a salary, they stop worrying about you. Why would anybody
leave? This is, after all, such a wonderful place.
Perhaps it is, but the grass can be greener in a variety of diﬀerent ways.
You could be a faculty member at University X and then University Y —
with a working group of 5 people in your subject area—may decide to make

110
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
you an oﬀer. Perhaps University Y is an elite institution that attracts top-
notch students. Maybe University Y has particularly nice salaries. Maybe
you just like the location of University Y —a particularly attractive city or
a nice college town. It is possible that University Y is an especially wealthy
institution that can oﬀer all sorts of research support and creature comforts
that your home institution cannot.
To make a long story short, you may get outside oﬀers. This will really
give your Chair a headache.
If another institution values you, then it is
quite likely that your home—University X—does not want to lose you. And
University X is not accustomed to putting forth any eﬀort to hang on to
you, so now it is going to have to get its act together. It will have to come
up with a competitive salary—to meet or match your outside oﬀer. And it
will have to come up with perks that will make you just about as happy as
the new job would have.
The home institution will not have to try as hard as the new invader,
because if you stay where you are you won’t have to move, you won’t have
to uproot your family, you won’t have to get involved with all the paperwork
and other details connected with changing venues.
So your counter-oﬀer
from University X may be a bit lower in a number of respects than the
outside oﬀer. And you will have to determine how to put this diﬀerence into
perspective.
The invading institution will have you in for one or more visits, and your
spouse as well. They will make special eﬀorts—much more probably than
your home institution has done—to do nice things for your partner (ﬁnd
him/her a job, set up interviews, arrange for him/her to meet people). They
will arrange for a realtor to show you houses and condominiums. They will
acquaint you with the schools. They will take you out for a lot of nice meals.
In short, they will make every eﬀort to turn your head.
As I have said elsewhere in this book, it is healthy to re-invent yourself
and do something new every ﬁve or ten years. So you may ﬁnd it to be just
the ticket to take a new job now and then. After all, you are not going to
get this kind of attention for your entire life. When you do get it, you may
as well enjoy it and try to derive as much from it as you can.
Although outside oﬀers are most commonly given for research qualiﬁca-
tions, there are other reasons that they happen. You could be the progenitor
of an important national teaching program. You could have created a new
mathematics curriculum. You could have been a leader in the teaching re-
form movement. You could be famous for getting big grants to alter the

111
landscape of the teaching profession. Even in late middle age, people can get
oﬀers to relocate because of qualiﬁcations such as these. Many things are
possible.
4.19
What Goes on at Conferences?
In the seventeenth century, and on into the eighteenth century, there were
few mathematics conferences. After all, there were rather few professional
mathematicians. Recall that Isaac Barrow had to give up his post at Cam-
bridge so that Isaac Newton could have a Professorship. A titan like Bern-
hard Riemann did not obtain a Professorship until he was lying on his death
bed. Galois and Abel never had Professorships.
Fermat was an amateur
mathematician—his “day job” was as a Judge in Toulouse.
And there really was no money to ﬁnance mathematics conferences in
those days. There was no National Science Foundation, no Oﬃce of Naval
Research, no DARPA, no UNESCO. Further, there was a certain inbred cul-
tural bias against open communication. The very ﬁrst scientiﬁc journal was
founded by Henry Oldenberg in 1665. At that time there was a standing
tradition for scientists to be quite secretive about their work. Oldenberg
had established himself as something of a go-between among various emi-
nent scientists, arranging to trade scientiﬁc insights for valuable bagatelles
like books.
His ad hoc marketplace of ideas ultimately evolved into The
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.
But the proclivity for secrecy among scientiﬁc researchers did not in-
stantly disappear with the advent of Oldenburg’s journal. Even 150 years
ago, scientists and mathematicians tended to work in isolation. Because there
were so few professional positions, people tended to harbor strong jealousies.
Some mathematicians had wealthy patrons (for example Euler had Frederick
the Great), but those were the lucky few.
So, while the resources to fund conferences were really not available in
the old days, it is also the case that the desire for conferences was at a
fairly low ebb. The International Congresses of Mathematicians, which began
around 1893, were something of a revelation. They ushered in a new era of
international communication among the top workers in the subject.
Today we are in a golden age of mathematics.
Wonderful new cross-
fertilizations are taking place among widely disparate ﬁelds of mathematics.
Fruitful new symbioses are arising among mathematics, engineering, physics,

112
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
and many other parts of modern technology. And this activity is all spurred
by an explosion of communication. For the most part this exchange of infor-
mation is wide open. Few of us are secretive, and there is little motivation to
try to be so. There are myriad sources of funding for conferences—from indi-
vidual universities to government-level scientiﬁc foundations (the NSF being
a prime example) to branches of the armed services to private foundations.
Most active research mathematicians go to at least one conference per year,
and many go to several. It is a great pleasure to organize a conference—to
gather a collection of your brothers-in-arms and spend a week exchanging
ideas and insights and problems. Also to drink some beers and have some
good meals together and to go on hikes or to museums.
So what goes on at a conference? There are many diﬀerent formats. The
most basic conference will have a menu of talks all day. If it is well organized,
then there will be plenty of breaks and a long lunch hour so that people have
a chance to have private conversations, to exchange ideas, and to discuss the
talks. Some conferences will have plenary, one-hour talks in the mornings
and then a lot of shorter talks in the afternoons. Many times the shorter
talks will run in parallel sessions so that everyone who wants to will get a
chance to speak. Sometimes there will be special talks to help bring the
graduate students up to speed. Or there will be a problem session, often
chaired by an especially distinguished member of the group.
It is quite common at a conference (running Monday to Friday) for
Wednesday afternoon to be free. That way people can go sightseeing, or
get together with collaborators and work on problems, or go on a hike. Of
course evenings are usually free, and people can go out for nice meals, or to
the theatre, or to an opera or some other musical event.
The American Institute of Mathematics in Palo Alto, California has for
the past ﬁve years pioneered a new type of mathematics workshop in which
there are two expository talks each morning followed by a breakup into work-
ing groups in the afternoon. Each working group, of size about ﬁve to eight,
tackles some very speciﬁc mathematical problem or group of problems. This
has turned out to be a daring and highly productive way to get people to-
gether to produce new mathematics.
I have been going to conferences for 35 years now. When I ﬁrst started
out, I made a point of going to as many talks as I could. That was prob-
ably appropriate, as I was trying to tool up; I wanted to absorb as much
mathematics as possible. Now my point of view is quite diﬀerent. I go to
conferences to learn new problems to work on, and to establish new collabo-

4.20. THE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF MATHEMATICIANS113
rations. For me, going to talks is an activity of deﬁnitely secondary interest.
I want ﬁrst to meet people and exchang ideas.
You will develop your own style for going to conferences. I know people
who will go to a conference and spend most of the time sitting in their
private room thinking about some new idea. Others will spend the whole
time talking to a collaborator and not attend a single talk or event. Still
others will attend several talks but will not pay any attention; they will
instead have side conversations with their neighbors.
The main point of a conference is to get your juices ﬂowing. It is im-
portant, if one wants to be a successful mathematician, to be immersed in
the current actitivy, to be exposed to all the new ideas. A conference is an
eﬀective vehicle for making that happen.
4.20
The International Congress of Mathe-
maticians
The International Congress of Mathematicians (or ICM) is a watershed event
in mathematical life. It has taken place every four years for the past hundred
years or more (with hiatuses during the great wars). Ever since 1936, the
Fields Medals have been awarded at the ICM. Although few of us harbor any
illusions about actually winning the Fields Medal, we all look to this cere-
mony as a seminal event that helps to deﬁne who we are, what is important
in our ﬁeld, and where we are going.
The ICM is not like a working mathematics conference. You don’t go
there expecting to hook up with a potential collaborator and to start writing
a new paper. It is largely a ceremonial event.
There are three kinds of talks at the ICM. The plenary lectures—of which
there are ten or so—are one-hour talk given by the most distinguished and
accomplished mathematicians in the world. It is a tremendous honor to be
asked to give a plenary talk at the ICM—some say a greater honor than
the Fields Medal. These talks are generally of very high quality, and well
worth hearing.
The second type of talk is the “invited talk.” These are
each 45 minutes in duration. They are given by those who are considered
to be the current movers and shakers in the various ﬁelds of mathematics.
There are several dozen of these talks. These talks are to be taken quite
seriously, and they are generally good. But they are often quite technical

114
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
and you cannot expect to understand the invited talks outside of your special
ﬁeld. Finally, there are the “uninvited talks.” These are volunteer talks; a
partipant will submit an abstract, and then he/she can give a brief talk
(usually twenty minutes or less). Often a mathematician will give one of
these talks to validate his/her participation in the conference so that he/she
can get remunerated by his/her Math Department. These talks are often
forgettable, although there are some notable exceptions.
The main purpose of going to the ICM is to soak up some mathematics,
to get a sense of what is going on in our discipline, and to meet people.
There are lots of ancillary social events as well. The 2006 ICM was special
because people wanted to learn the status of the Poincar´e conjecture. Richard
Hamilton and John Morgan gave splendid talks explaining the mathematics
in broad and accessible language, and assuring the audience that the theorem
really had been proved.
This atop the awarding of the Fields Medal to
Perelman, and the fact that he declined the honor and did not attend the
ceremony.
I would recommend that you go to at least one ICM in your lifetime. It
is a good excuse for some foreign travel, it is lots of fun, and you will be
exposed to the political/social side of the profession in new ways. Organize
a group from your university—that will make it even more fun. Bring the
family. Make it into an outing.
4.21
The January Joint Mathematics Meet-
ings
The American Mathematical Society (AMS) and the Mathematical Associ-
ation of America (MAA) jointly sponsor a big Math meeting each year in
January. The confab lasts about four days, although there are a number
of preliminary activities (seminars and convocations of one sort or another)
that can extend the meeting to a week or more. There are several features
that make this an attractive event to attend:
• The meeting is very well attended. Well, better attended if it is in
San Francisco than if it is in Cleveland. But there are always several
thousand people. And it is a broad cross-section of the profession, from
junior college teachers to Liberal Arts College teachers to comprehen-
sive college teachers to University Professors.

4.21. THE JANUARY JOINT MATHEMATICS MEETINGS
115
• You are liable to see lots of friends, collaborators, colleagues, and old
acquaintances. And you will meet a lot of new people as well.
• There are a number of important invited lectures, and these are gen-
erally quite good and very informative. Many of these are big events,
and have receptions and dinners connected with them.
• There are quite a number of working seminars or “Special Sessions”
in particular areas of mathematics. These are gatherings of ﬁfty or
more people in a particular research area, with a number of fairly brief
(twenty minute or so) invited talks. A Special Session could comprise
three separate three-hour events stretching over three successive days.
• In the past ten or ﬁfteen years it has come about that there is a fair
amount of mathematical sociology at play at these meetings as well.
I have seen Special Sessions on Feminist Linear Algebra, on the role
of Gays in the Mathematics Profession, on Sexual harassment in the
Classroom (including instructive skits), and on How to Get a Grant.
• There is a huge exhibit of publishers and others who market mathe-
matical artifacts. This will include all the mainstream mathematics
publishers, the textbook publishers, the calculator purveyors, the soft-
ware creators (TEX,® Mathematica,® Maple,® MatLab,®and the like),
and also various instructional programs (the MASS program at Penn
State, various summer programs for high school students, the R. L.
Moore project, the Mathematical Genealogy Project, and so forth).
Various math institutes will have booths. The National Science Foun-
dation (NSF), the National Security Agency (NSA), and other gov-
ernment agencies will have booths. Various artists and artisans who
produce “mathematical” artwork and jewelry will have exhibits. One
can spend a good deal of time with these folks, and one should. It is
a big slice of the mathematical pie. If you are thinking of publishing a
book, then this is a good place to meet up with a publisher.
• There are a number of nice outings to see the local sights.
• There are a number of banquets and receptions and other social events.
Often, but not always, the main meeting is in a city’s Convention Cen-
ter, and the canonical lodging is a hotel connected to the Convention Cen-

116
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
ter. Sometimes the meeting will be in a couple of hotels with no Conven-
tion Center involved. Your Math Department will probably at least par-
tially subvent your participation in the Joint National Meetings, especially if
you are a participant (either giving a talk, or serving on a panel, or or-
ganizing an activity).
You can learn more about the Joint Meetings at
http://www.ams.org/amsmtgs. On that Web site, you can register for the
meeting and arrange your hotel accommodations. You can also sign up for
various seminars and excursions and banquets. These meetings are a big
mathematical social event, and many of us go religiously every year. It is a
way to keep tabs on the profession. Consider becoming part of it.
4.22
Prizes and Encomia
A subject like Chemistry is just littered with prizes—encomia to recognize
outstanding research or service or teaching or excellence in some other aspect
of the professional life. Practically every practicing Chemist has some prize
or other.
Mathematics, by contrast, has traditionally been rather chary with prizes.
The last few years have seen the emergence of several new ones, but our
aggregate number of prizes is relatively small.
We mention just some of
them here:
The Fields Medal This is of course the greatest of all Math prizes. Founded
by John Charles Fields in the 1920s, this honor has become the pre-
eminent of all Mathematics prizes. Sometimes called the “Nobel Prize
of mathematics” (mathematicians do not qualify for the Nobel Prize),
this honor is bestowed every four years at the International Congress of
Mathematicians on between two and four young mathematicians under
the age of forty.
The Leroy P. Steele Prizes Given by the American Mathematical Soci-
ety each year, there are three of these awards. One is for a seminal
paper, one is for an entire oeuvre of scientiﬁc work, and one is for
writing. The dollar amount of the prize is $5,000, but the honor and
prestige of winning a Steele Prize are considerable.
The Bergman Prize This prize, founded in 1988, is funded by the estate
of complex analyst Stefan Bergman. Administered by the American

4.22. PRIZES AND ENCOMIA
117
Mathematical Society, it recognizes outstanding work in ﬁelds that were
of interest to Bergman (complex analysis, several complex variables).
The BirkhoﬀPrize Named in honor of George David Birkhoﬀ, this prize
was founded in 1967 to recognize excellent work in applied mathemat-
ics.
The Moore Prize Named in honor of E. H. Moore, this prize was estab-
lished in 2002 to recognize an outstanding research article in one of the
AMS primary research journals.
The Robbins Prize Named in honor of David P. Robbins, this prize was
established in 2005 to recognize work in algebra, combinatorics, or dis-
crete math that has a signiﬁcant experimental component.
The Wiener Prize Named in honor of Norbert Wiener, this prize was es-
tablished in 1967 to recognize outstanding work in applied mathemat-
ics.
The Conant Prize Named in honor of Levi L. Conant, this prize was es-
tablished in 2000 to recognize an excellent expository paper in either
the Bulletin of the AMS or the Notices of the AMS.
The Morgan Prize Named in honor of Frank and Brennie Morgan, this
prize was established in 1995 to recognize excellent research by an un-
dergraduate.
The Veblen Prize Named in honor of Oswald Veblen, this prize was es-
tablished in 1961 to recognize outstanding work in geometry.
The Satter Prize Named in honor of Ruth Lyttle Satter, this prize was
founded in 1990 to recognize outstanding mathematical research by a
woman.
The Wolf Prize Funded by the Wolf Foundation and awarded in Israel,
this prize recognizes scientists and artists in a variety of ﬁelds. Among
these are mathematics and physics. The cash value of the prize is about
$600,000.

118
CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH
The MacArthur Prize Funded by the John and Catherine MacArthur
Foundation, this prize recognize excellence in all ﬁelds of human en-
deavor. A number of mathematicians have been so honored, most re-
cently Fields Medalist Terence Tao. The premise of the prize is that
extremely talented individuals should not be burdened with worrying
about worldly pecadillos like paying the bills. The cash value of the
prize is ﬁve years’ salary.
The Cole Prize Named after Frank N. Cole, this is one of the pre-eminent
prizes in algebra. It is administered by the American Mathematical
Society.
The Bˆocher Prize Named after Maxime Bˆocher, this is one of the top
honors in mathematical analysis. It is administered by the American
Mathematical Society.
The AMS Book Prize This is a relatively new prize, only awarded once
or twice to date. It is for an outstanding book that has been profoundly
inﬂuential.
The Chauvenet Prize Named after William Chauvenet of Washington Uni-
versity, this is a prize usually given for an outstanding expository
article—often one that has appeared in the American Mathematical
Monthly. The prize is administered by the Mathematical Association
of America.
The Franklin and Deborah Tepper Haimo Award This is a national
award for mathematics teaching, administered by the Mathematical
Association of America. It is named after Frank and Deborah Haimo,
both outstanding St. Louis mathematicians.
A Plenary Talk at the ICM This is not a prize as such, but it is better
than most prizes. Because it really puts you in the pantheon. Only
the most esteemed and accomplished mathematicians in the world are
asked to give a one-hour talk at the ICM. Everyone will remember that
you were a plenary speaker. It is a very big honor. There is only one
classical mathematician (Volterra) who has given four plenary talks at
the ICM. Ahlfors is the only one who has given three.
And just a
handful have given two. Even to give one is a huge deal.

4.22. PRIZES AND ENCOMIA
119
For most—but not all—mathematics prizes, the cash value of the prize is
of little consequence. It is a considerable honor to garner one of these awards,
and the concomitant reputation will follow you around for your entire life.
Whenever you are introduced—as a colloquium speaker or honored visitor—
it will always be mentioned that you are a holder of the Chauvenet Prize,
or the Steele Prize, or the Fields Medal. Most of us do mathematics for the
love of the game, and not in pursuit of prizes. But it is a special honor and
pleasure—and a privilege—to have one’s work singled out by one’s colleagues
and given special recognition. By some yardsticks, honors like these make
life worth living.

5.1
Writing a Textbook
Textbook writing is book writing to be sure, but it is quite a diﬀerent animal
from the other types of writing in the profession. The textbook market—
especially at the lower division (i.e., freshman and sophomore) level, is very
competitive. And everyone teaches lower division courses—this is our bread
and butter. So everyone thinks that they have a good textbook in them. As a
result, it’s pretty tough to get a contract to write a lower division book. Once
you get that contract, you will ﬁnd out that it is quite a regimen to get the
book written in publishable form. Gone is the idea that you write your stuﬀ,
polish it up, send it in, and then go have a beer. Now you will be wrestling
with armies of reviewers and Developmental Editors and other personnel
whose job it is to turn your inchoate ravings into a marketable product. There
are also delicate design issues, questions about the use of color, complicated
matters of copyright of ﬁgures, legalities concerning material borrowed from
other sources, and the list goes on and on.
Writing a textbook can take a big chunk out of your life—both profes-
sionally and psychologically. Again consult the sources [KRA2] and [KRA4]
for further details in this matter. It is not something to be entered lightly.
You might be wise to consult a more experienced colleague—one who has
been down this path—to get a sense of what sort of life-changing experience
you might be entering here.
Of course it is possible to make a good deal of money in writing text-
books. Roland Larson (a Math Professor at Penn State Behrend Campus)
has produced textbooks and other education materials that have grossed 3/4
of a billion dollars. I’ll let you ﬁgure what percentage of that total was his
cut. Larson has his own publishing company now with upwards of ﬁfty em-
ployees. Mary Dolciani wrote the textbooks on the New Math in the 1960s
that the teachers could actually understand. She had most of the state adop-
tions for several years. Dolciani has now passed on, but there is a Dolciani
Foundation that uses her money for educational purposes. James Stewart
has had the bestselling calculus book for a number of years now—and there
are 500,000 calculus books sold worldwide each year. So he has made a good
deal of money.
Money is one of the temptations to write a textbook. I have one friend
who wrote a calculus book to aid in his putting his many kids through college.
This was an ill-fated mission, and the book did not sell at all. He pocketed
his advance, and that is about all the money he ever saw from that multi-

5.1. WRITING A TEXTBOOK
123
year project. My view, as one who has written textbooks, is that you better
have some better reasons than the old folding green for investing so much
time and eﬀort in textbook writing. Perhaps you want to change the way
that a subject is taught. Perhaps you really have something to say. Perhaps
you want to have an impact on the profession. I think that those are better
motivators, with more lasting value, and will see you through a big project
like this with more of your life and your integrity intact.
Upper-division textbook writing is a somewhat more gentle process. You,
the author, will have more control of the basic steps, and you will have
much more latitude to write what you want. The entire writing regimen will
probably take considerably less time than for a lower-division book, and you
will certainly go through fewer drafts. The entire time-window for producing
the book could be as little as two years, and at the end you will have a nice
contribution to the didactic literature to hold in your hand and share with
your colleagues and family. Writing a graduate text is an even more gentle
activity—it’s really writing mathematics, and you can concentrate more on
the content and less on the exposition (although you should spend time on
both). We shall say no more about the delineations among diﬀerent types of
textbook writing here; see [KRA4] for a more discursive discussion.
The bad news is that, in today’s market, not so many commercial publish-
ers are interested in upper-division publishing. A successful lower-division
text can sell 50,000 copies per year. A successful upper-division text might
sell 5,000 copies per year. It’s all in the numbers. The sale of the ﬁrst several
thousand copies of the book will cover the publisher’s “plant costs”—these
are the salaries of the editors, the typesetting costs, the design costs, the pro-
duction costs, the warehousing costs, the printing costs, and so forth. And
there will be more such costs for a lower-division book than for an upper-
division book. But after the sales pass that basic accounting threshhold then
it’s all gravy, and publishers are in business to make a proﬁt. So books that
sell more grab all the attention. In the old days (even thirty years ago) a
publisher would market a calculs book to make some money and thereby be
able to subsidize the more academic advanced book program. Conversely,
the advanced books would lend prestige to the overall enterprise. No more.
Now every book must stand on its own; it must make a proﬁt. This is a dif-
ferent world, and not a very pretty one for those who want to write advanced,
recondite mathematics books.
When I was in graduate school there were more than twenty publishers
that would develop and market research monographs.
That was because

124
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
most of the major universities and research institutions had standing orders
with all the publishers. Any reasonable monograph had guaranteed sales of
1000 copies, and publishers simply geared their prices so that after 750 copies
they were making a proﬁt. It was a win-win situation for everyone. Today
money is tighter, library budgets are cut to the bone, and few institutions
have many standing orders. Most libraries pick and choose the books that
they want, and there are no longer any guaranteed sales ﬁgures. As a result,
the number of publishers interested in publishing mathematical monographs
has dropped to about ﬁve.
Just so with upper-division texts. The number of Math Majors is ﬂat at
best, and not large. The really booming majors these days are biomedical
engineering, supply line management,1 psychology, and media studies. That
is where the publishers are gravitating. If you go to the annual AMS/MAA
meeting held in January, you will see that the number of mathematical text-
book publishers has dropped dramatically (from 25 years ago) and the num-
ber that are hawking upper-division texts is few.
The real money is in marketing lower-division texts, and the big money is
in so-called developmental math. Developmental math is corporate double-
speak for pre-calculus and pre-pre-calculus.
Big state schools have huge
enrollements in these remedial courses. Teaching gurus like Uri Treisman
inveigh against it; Treisman feels that the high schools should teach this el-
ementary material and colleges and universities should teach the real stuﬀ.
But the reality of life is that students vote with their feet. They get to college
not particularly liking math, but faced with the reality that they have to take
it. Their preparation being rather weak, they end up enrolling in remedial
courses. So that’s where the sales are.
5.2
The Mathematics Curriculum
I have been involved with universities continuously for the past forty years.
As as student, I went through a fairly standard Mathematics curriculum at
a good school, and I myself have taught the Mathematics curriculum at a
number of institutions. And it hasn’t changed much. It still goes pretty
much like this:
1You may have never even heard of this one. It is based on Amazon’s business plan of
having no warehouses, and drop-shipping all book orders directly from the publisher.

5.2. THE MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM
125
• calculus
• linear algebra
• ordinary diﬀerential equations
• abstract algebra
• real analysis
• complex analysis
• geometry
The last two items on the list may be considered optional. I had a very
strong undergraduate training in Mathematics, and I didn’t have either one
of those courses (I later learned them on my own).
Many Departments now oﬀer diﬀerent ﬂavors of the Math major—Statistics,
Applied, Teaching, Computational, and the like—and this gives the students
some ﬂexibility in designing their course of study. At Washington University
the most popular Math option by far is the Statistics option. Turns out that
is because it is a tried-and-true way to avoid taking real analysis.
Even though schools that have kept up with the times are now oﬀering
students some variation and ﬂexibility in the course of study, the fact remains
that the basic structure of the Undergraduate Major has not changed in quite
some time. And perhaps it should. Because of the rise of computing, and
the blossoming of theoretical computer science as an independent discipline,
discrete mathematics has become ever more important. Where does that
ﬁt into the curriculum? There are those who will argue that caculus has
had its day; it no longer ﬁts with the problems that are most important in
our world. The curriculum should in fact center around discrete math and
algebra. Others will argue that the most important thing is logic; after all,
the P/NP problem is (in the opinion of some inﬂuential people) the most
important question in mathematics, if not in all of science.
Of course applied mathematics too has a high proﬁle these days, and well
it should. It makes good sense that the undergraduate curriculum should
embrace applied math—at least to the extent of oﬀering Fourier analysis,
partial diﬀerential equations, and numerical analysis.
You will note that the adumbration of the math curriculum that I pro-
vided above does not contain any discrete math or logic or probability or

126
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
statistics. This is not meant to exhibit any prejudice or disapproval on my
part; but it could be a manifestation of my ignorance. The key point that
I am trying to make is that there are serious issues to consider here. And
somebody should be considering them. The NSF announced about ten years
ago that it was funding a new program to encourage Math Departments to
discard their old curriculum and develop a new one. I think that the jury is
still out regarding the success of that program. But it is bound to produce
some interesting and useful results.
You, as a tenured faculty member in your department, may wish to take
up this gauntlet. Of course you will want to do this as part of a team, so
the ﬁrst step will be to determine whether anyone else is interested. And
you will want to take the temperature of the entire department—perhaps at
a faculty meeting—to determine whether your eﬀorts (which will be consid-
erable and protracted) will be met favorably. Certainly ﬁnd out whether the
Chair and the Executive Committee approve of your eﬀorts. You might even
ask permission to run it by the Dean.
It would be foolish and disheartening to spend a couple of years re-
designing the undergraduate curriculum only to ﬁnd that everyone is content
with the curriculum you have and that nobody wants to hear anything to
the contrary. This is the sort of well-meaning but wrong-headed nonsense
that can easily lead to major rifts among faculty, and to the sundering of
otherwise good and productive relationships. You may think that you are a
knight on a white horse, setting out to do a world of good. Others may see
you as a misanthrope who just wants to rock the boat.
Of course one path, once you have laid the groundwork for your mission,
is to get a grant to support your eﬀorts. As I have already indicated, there
is copious government money (and private foundation money as well) to
support eﬀorts to beef up the American math curriculum. What you do at
your particular school could be perceived as a model for departments across
the country. You could ﬁnd yourself with a $3 million grant—much larger
than any other grant in the department—to subsidize your humble eﬀorts.
This is in fact what happened with some of the teaching reform eﬀorts in the
1980s and 1990s. It was a remarkable social phenomenon—the last shall be
ﬁrst and the ﬁrst shall be last (I think that the Bible said this ﬁrst). It had
a huge impact on the infrastructure of many departments, and created new
resentments that nobody even knew had existed. This is an exciting path
to pursue, but you should have a clear picture of what you are getting into
before you start the journey.

5.3. HOW TO BE A DEPARTMENTAL CITIZEN
127
5.3
How to be a Departmental Citizen
Part of this will be thrust upon you.
Most everyone has committee and
administrative duties of one sort or another (if you are an endowed Chair
Professor then you may be exempted from such activity). These are part
of your job, and you should endeavor to acquit yourself professionally and
admirably in their dispatch. If you do so, and if it becomes widely known that
you are an estimable colleague on committees, one who does his homework
and contributes constructively, then you will be admired and respected as a
departmental citizen.
Of course you can take up the gauntlet and carry it further. You can
initiate projects—be they projects to modify the administrative structure of
the department, or projects to augment or modify the curriculum, or projects
to develop joint curricula with other departments (Physics or Engineering or
Finance) or projects to develop relations with local industry. You should
certainly clear any such activity with the Chair. Don’t just go oﬀon your
own. And the Chair may in turn want to run the idea past the Executive
Committee. But once you get a green light then you will probably have
considerable latitude to develop your own program and put your stamp on
something worthwhile. Activities of this kind can certainly count positively
towards your tenure or promotion, but don’t kid yourself. They don’t count
as much as writing and publishing research papers. Being the departmental
dishrag is not the same as being a world-class scholar.
Most of us ﬁnd that the best way to live our lives is to concentrate on being
a mathematician. If we are called upon to serve on a committee, or head a
taskforce, then we do so in a serious fashion and to the best of our abilities. If
we are called upon to serve as Chair or in some other administrative capacity,
then we take the matter seriously, and perhaps agree to throw our hat in the
ring. But most of us don’t go out of our way to assume administrative tasks.
And it all works out in the end. Our primary mission is not to serve on
committees. In fact our primary mission is to do mathematics and to teach
mathematics—not necessarily in that order.
5.4
Letters of Recommendation
Once you have become an established mathematician, you are likely to be
asked for letters of recommendation. Such a document could be a letter of

128
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
recommendation for a tenure case, or for a promotion, or for both. It could
be a letter recommending a young person for a ﬁrst or second job. It could be
a letter recommending a senior person for an endowed Chair Professorship,
or for the Chair-ship of a department. (For the sake of this discussion, I will
call these “professional letters”.) It also could be a letter of recommendation
for a student—an undergraduate applying to graduate school, or a graduate
student applying for a job, or a student at any level appling for a fellowship
(such letters are treated a bit diﬀerently from professional letters—see be-
low). There are many variants; here I would like to distill out some unifying
principles on writing letters of recommendation.
In my view, it is both unprofessional and irresponsible to dodge the task
of writing a letter. Let me be more precise. There certainly will arise cir-
cumstances where you either cannot write or should not write. Perhaps you
have had a ﬁght with the candidate in question and feel that you cannot
oﬀer an objective opinion; perhaps you have a conﬂict of interest; perhaps
you are unfamiliar with the general area in which the candidate works; or
perhaps you do not know the candidate well at all. In any of these cases, or
similar ones, you should quickly and plainly write to the person (the Dean or
Chair) who requested the letter and say that you cannot write. Sometimes
the person who is to be the subject of the letter asks you directly to write
on their behalf. Again, you should give this person an honest answer right
away. If you can write an accurate and supportive letter in a timely fashion,
then say that you will do so and do it. If for some reason you cannot write
or will not write, then say that. Do not shilly-shally around, and do not
be dishonest. Don’t tell the person that you will write, knowing full well
that you will never do it. If you cannot write, best is if you can give the
reason, but it is acceptable if you cannot. Do not agonize over the task for
six months and then decline to write; take care of the matter right away.
The circumstances described in the last paragraph should be considered
to be exceptions. In most instances, you will be asked to write about some
particular person for some particular circumstance and you should say “yes”
and then you should do it.
I know mathematicians who will agree to write an important letter and
then not do it. This paradox usually occurs for one of two reasons: (1)
the putative letter writer is pathologically disorganized and forgets, or (2)
the putative letter writer has nothing nice to say about the issue or person
at hand and does not want to say it. I have already addressed the second
of these conundra. The ﬁrst of these situations is not likely to arise if the

5.4. LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION
129
request to write was submitted to you as a formal letter—from a Dean, for
instance. For then the piece of paper is sitting somewhere on your desk and
you will probably get to it eventually. The paradox can occur if instead
a student pokes his head in your door and asks for a recommendation to
graduate school. You give a cheery “yes” and then the entire matter vacates
your head. To avoid this error, ask the student to put the following on a slip
of paper: his name, any classes he took from you or other pertinent data,
and the address to which the letter is to be sent. (This ruse also helps you
to avoid the embarrassment of having to ask the student’s name.) Now you
have it in writing. Also ask the student to come back in a week or so and
remind you. I usually ﬁnd it convenient to write the letter right away (if the
student has poked his head in the door then it is likely my oﬃce hour and I
might as well be doing something). For once the request has been tendered,
I am probably already thinking about what I am going to say; I might as
well write it down and be done with it.
There are certain individuals—and I certainly admire these folks for their
organization and tenacity—who have set up an interactive Web page for
students who request a letter. When a student comes in and says, “Please
write a letter for me,” these faculty tell the student to go ﬁll out the Web
page. It requests the student name, level, what courses he/she has taken from
the Professor, what grades received, what other interactions the student and
Professor have had, other extracurricular activities that would be relevant,
academic and career goals, distinctions in the Department, and anything else
that would be relevant and would help this Professor to write a good letter
for the student. What a great idea! Certainly this reduces the amount of
legwork that the Professor will have to do; in eﬀect, the student has already
generated a draft of the necessary letter.
Having decided to perform the task—that is, to write the requested
letter—you must do what you have been asked to do. That is, you must
formulate an opinion, state it clearly, and defend it. The standard format
will be explained below.
In the ﬁrst few sentences, state plainly the question that you are address-
ing. For example:
The purpose of this letter is to support the tenure and promotion
of Lloyd George. I have known the candidate and his work for a
period of six years, and have been impressed with his originality
and his productivity.
I indeed think that tenure and promotion

130
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
are appropriate. My detailed remarks follow.
Alternatively:
You have asked for my opinion on the tenure, and promotion
to Associate Professor, of Dr. Andrew Jackson. Dr. Jackson is
now six years from the Ph.D., and in that time has produced
nothing but some rotten teaching evaluations and a letter to the
editor of the Two-Year College Math Journal.
Based on that
track record, my opinion is that he is worthy of neither tenure
nor of promotion.
The bulk, or body, of the letter follows, and it should support in detail
the thesis enunciated in the ﬁrst paragraph. The concluding paragraph of
the letter should sum up the case, re-state the thesis, and emphasize the
conclusion.
Once the body of the letter is written—and this could comprise one or
two (or even more) pages—then you must write a concluding paragraph. You
must write it. You must sum up the point you have made, and restate your
thesis. A sample of this practice is
In view of the stature of Laszlo Toth in the ﬁeld of computa-
tional algebraic geometry, and considering his accomplishments
as a teacher and as a scholar, I can recommend him without
reservation for promotion and tenure in your department.
(I am assuming that you have in fact described Toth’s status and accom-
plishments, in a favorable manner, in the preceding paragraphs.) Another
possibility is:
In sum, I feel strongly that Ish Kabibble should not be pro-
moted or tenured. Indeed, I cannot imagine the circumstances in
which such a move could be considered appropriate.
There are those who, although experienced letter writers, do not adhere
to the general scheme just described. One of the standard rationales for this
behavior is that, in many states and at many institutions, it is (theoretically)
possible for the candidate to have access to the complete text of his/her
letters of recommendation—including the identities of the writers. If such

5.4. LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION
131
is the case, then the soliciting school will inform the writer at the time
the letter is requested. Of course the letter writer is oﬀered the option up
front of declining to write if he/she is uncomfortable with this “freedom of
information” situation.
There are those who, still uncomfortable, agree to write but are afraid to
say anything. The most negative thing that they are willing to do is to “damn
with faint praise.” Not only does this artiﬁce undercut the responsibility of
the letter writer, but it puts on those evaluating the case the onus of trying
to ﬁgure out what the writer was trying to (but did not) say. In the best
of all possible circumstances, someone at the soliciting institution will phone
the letter writer and just ask what the letter was meant to say. In the worst
of circumstances, the evaluators are left to guess what was meant. Given
that someone’s life and career are in the balance here, it is a genuine shame
for such a circumstance to come to pass.
Enough preaching. I will now give some advice about the body of the
letter. If you want your (professional) letter to have some impact, and to
be taken seriously, then you must do two things: (i) make some speciﬁc
comments about speciﬁc work or speciﬁc papers of the candidate, (ii) speak
of particular qualities of the candidate, speciﬁc contributions that he/she has
made to the subject or to the profession, objective information about his/her
academic qualiﬁcations, (iii) make binary comparisons. You may also wish
to discuss other attributes of the candidate. No matter what these may be,
you should heed these principles: be precise, speak of particular attributes,
and speak only of those topics of which you have direct knowledge. Now let
me explain.
Your letter had better say more than “Konrad Adnauer is a hail fellow,
well met. Give him whatever he wants.” First, such a letter does not say
anything. Second, given the circumstances described above, in which some
letter writers attempt to avoid litigation by “damning with faint praise,” such
a vague letter could be construed as sotto voce damnation. If your comments
are instead detailed and speciﬁc then it is diﬃcult for people to misconstrue
them.

132
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
Thus you should dwell, for a page or more, on speciﬁc virtues of the
candidate’s scientiﬁc work. Make detailed remarks about particular papers:
Why is this result important? How does it improve on earlier work? How
does the work advance the ﬁeld? Who else has worked on this problem? This
material should not be a self-serving introspection. Remember that most of
the readers of the letter will be nonspecialists. Many, including the Dean and
members of his committee, will not even be mathematicians. Thus attempt,
brieﬂy, to give background and motivation. Drop some names. For example,
say that Ignatz of MIT worked on this problem for years and obtained only
feeble partial results. The candidate under review murdered the problem.
If appropriate, point out that the candidate publishes in the Annals and
Inventiones—and that these are eminent, carefully refereed journals.
It is astonishing, but true, that even highly placed people, who write
dozens of inﬂuential letters every year, seem to be unaware of the need for
binary comparisons. To put it bluntly, an important letter that is to have a
strong eﬀect must compare the candidate being discussed to other people, of
a similar age and career level, at other institutions. The comparison should
be with people—preferably other academic mathematicians—whose names
the informed reader will recognize. Thus, if the candidate is an algebraic
geometer and you say in your letter that “this candidate is comparable to
Mumford when Mumford was the same age” then most algebraic geometers
will know exactly what you mean and will be extremely impressed; they will
in turn explain to their colleagues the signiﬁcance of your remarks. If instead
you say “this candidate is comparable to Prince Charles when Charlie was
a student at Gordonstoun” then nobody will know what you are talking
about—and you can be sure that they will not be impressed.
To come to the point, if you are writing an important letter that you
want people to notice, then you must say something like
The ﬁve best people under the age of 35 in this area are A, B,
C, D, E.
In the best of all circumstances, the candidate under consideration in your
letter is one of A through E—and you should point out that fact. Alterna-
tively, you could say
Two of the best people in this ﬁeld, at the beginning tenure stage,
are Jones and Schmones. Candidate Bones ﬁts comfortably be-

5.4. LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION
133
tween them. Bones is surely more original than Schmones and
more powerful than Jones.
Or you could say that the candidate falls into the next group. Or that the
candidate is so good that it would be silly to compare him to the usual ﬁve
best. Say what you think is appropriate. But say something. If you do not,
then the readers will notice the omission and infer that, between the lines,
you are saying that this guy is not any good. Better to say that he is number
15 than to say nothing at all.2
Your letter of recommendation can contain other speciﬁcs and details
that might grab the reader’s attention. You could say that the candidate
gives excellent talks at conferences. You could say that he/she is a wonderful
collaborator. You could say that the candidate has beautiful insights, and
that talking mathematics with this person is a pleasure. You could describe
in glowing and heartfelt terms the process of proving a theorem, or of writing
a paper, with the candidate.
These days, credible evidence that the candidate is a good teacher will
certainly help the case. Of course you are probably not in the same depart-
ment as the candidate, so you very well may not be able to discuss his/her
teaching. If the candidate is a truly outstanding teacher, then perhaps you
have heard his/her colleagues mention his/her talents, or perhaps you know
that he/she has won a teaching award. It makes quite an impression on letter
readers if Professor A, from University X, can comment knowledgeably and
in detail on the teaching of Professor B from College Y .
When you are writing a letter for a candidate, then a heavy responsibil-
ity rests on your shoulders. The Dean or Chair who solicits the letters of
recommendation is not simply casting his net and taking a vote: this person
wants a mandate. He/she will not weigh good letters against bad: he wants
2A caveat is in order if the letter that you are asked to write is not solicited from a
research institution. If the candidate is in fact at a four-year college, where the primary
faculty activity is teaching, then the school probably demands a lot of classroom activity—
and not so much scholarship. These days, almost every school wants its permanent faculty
to have some sort of academic proﬁle; but a teaching college can hardly expect its instruc-
tors to stand up to hard-nosed binary comparisons. The lesson is this: read the soliciting
letter carefully; speak to people in their language, and tell them what they want to know.
If the soliciting letter is from a teaching institution, then it is probably most appropriate
for you to write about teaching, curriculum, publications in the Monthly, and letters to
the editor of UME Trends. A disquisition on Gelfand-Fuks cohomology is probably less
apropos.

134
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
to be socked between the eyes. A tough Dean once told me “If a case is not
overwhelming then I turn it down. If the candidate is any good, he’ll land
on his feet. If not, then we are better oﬀwithout him.” Thus if your letter
for a tenure case says
Benedict Arnold is no good. Don’t do it.
then you may as well face the music and realize that your letter alone will
have killed the case—at least for now. I cannot repeat this point too strongly:
it is dead wrong to say to yourself “This is a negative letter that I am writing,
but it will not count unless all the other letters are negative too.” Baloney!
One negative letter will usually stop the case cold. That is all there is to it.
The writing of letters of recommendation is not formulaic. Indeed, if all
letters of recommendation ﬁt a pattern and sounded the same, or if all your
letters look the same, then they will eventually be ignored. Mathematicians
keep a mental database on letter writers in the same way that good base-
ball pitchers keep a database on batters. After several years, we know who
“tells it like it is” in his letters, who spins tales, and who simply cannot be
trusted. We know who always writes the same letter for everyone. And we
act accordingly.
You will develop your own style of writing letters.
Mathematics is a
suﬃciently small world that, after several years, people will recognize your
letters of recommendation at a glance. But, no matter how you write your
letters, you will want to take into account the issues raised in this section.
Although there is an art to writing a “professional letter”, it is also the
case that at least you are dealing with familiar territory, and speaking of
matters on which you are expert. Any professional mathematician for whom
you might write has a publication list, and a track record in teaching, and a
reputation as a lecturer, and some gestalt as a collaborator. When you are
writing for a student, by contrast, matters are more nebulous. The student
has none of the professional attributes that you are comfortable discussing.
Yet, if you want your letter to be memorable, and to be perceived positively,
then you still want to say something noteworthy about the student.
While the precepts of organization that I have stated above still apply
in a letter for a student, some of the other particulars do not. For exam-
ple, you most likely cannot remark on the student’s scientiﬁc work, and you
most likely cannot make binary comparisons. In fact any attempt at binary
comparison is likely to be ludicrous. Imagine saying “I am delighted to rec-
ommend Priscilla Albright. She is every bit as good as Martha Washington,

5.4. LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION
135
whom I recommended ﬁve years ago to a diﬀerent institution.” If in fact
you previously recommended a student who turned out to be a well-known
star—or at least a well-known star at the institution to which your letter
is addressed—then by all means make a binary comparison involving that
person if such a comparison is appropriate. Usually it is not appropriate, so
no such comparison should be included.
Thus in practice you must try a bit harder to say something speciﬁc
about the student for whom you are writing a letter. After you have been
teaching for several years, it may be the case that you have actually taught
a few thousand students (this would be true, for example, if you have taught
calculus in large lectures several times). It becomes diﬃcult to distinguish
students—even good ones—in your memory, much less to say something of
interest about any of them. If you apply yourself to the task, then you can
nevertheless come up with some noticeable things to say.
Here are some
examples, taken from genuine letters:
Benjamin Disraeli is one of the ﬁve most talented undergraduates
that I have encountered in twenty years of teaching.
Betsy Ross is hardworking and perseverant. She can think on
her feet—at the blackboard—just like a mathematician. She is
original and imaginative.
In order to test her creative abilities, I have given Mary Pop-
pins extra work outside of class. She discovered a new proof of
Gronwall’s inequality, discovered Euler’s equation in the calculus
of variations on her own, and has also posed numerous interest-
ing problems of her own creation. Needless to say, she breezed
through all the standard class work.
As usual, the point is to say something—and that something should be quite
speciﬁc. The view of letter readers is that if the letter writers cannot say
anything unambiguous and remarkable about a student, then there is prob-
ably nothing remarkable about that student. So what if the student can
earn mostly A’s in his classes?—that is no big deal, and in any event can be
gleaned from the transcript.
One of the most critical, and delicate, types of letter that you will have
to write is a letter seeking a job for a student completing his M.A. or Ph.D.

136
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
under your direction. Your statements are a priori suspect because you ob-
viously have a vested interest in ﬁnding this student a job, and in seeing
him/her succeed. Thus you must strive to put into practice the precepts
described above: (i) say why this student is good, (ii) say what this stu-
dent has accomplished, (iii) if possible, compare the student favorably with
other recent degree holders, (iv) say something about the student’s ability
to teach, (v) say something about the student’s ability to interact with other
mathematicians.
A meat-and-potatoes job application from a fresh Ph.D. has a detailed
letter from the thesis advisor that conforms, at least in spirit, to the sug-
gestions just adumbrated.
This detailed letter is accompanied by two or
three additional letters from other instructors at the same institution, each
of which is rather vague and says in eﬀect “Doo dah, doo dah; see the letter
by the thesis advisor.” If you want your student’s dossier to stand out, and
to really garner attention, then you should strive to help the student make
his/her dossier rise above this rather dreary norm. Endeavor to ensure that
the other writers know something about what is in the thesis. If possible,
convince someone from another institution to write a letter for the student.
Make sure that the dossier includes detailed letters about the student’s teach-
ing abilities.
When you write a letter of recommendation, tell the truth. If all your
letters read “This candidate is peachy, and a dandy teacher too. Give him
X” (where X is the plum that the candidate is applying for), then after a
while nobody will pay any attention to what you say. I presume that if you
take the trouble to write letters, then that is not the result that you wish.
The infrastructure has a memory. It will remember whether you are a person
who can make tough decisions, or whether you are wishy-washy. If you want
your letters to count, then you must call it as you see it. It is hard to be
hard, but that is what the situation demands.
One issue that we, as letter writers, often must address is whether or not
a job candidate can speak English, and how well (this question could even
apply to an undergraduate student—especially if that student is applying to
graduate school and might be considered for a Teaching Assistantship). In
this matter we are, in the United States, cursed by our group dishonesty over
the past twenty years. Too often have we said in a letter that “this candidate
speaks excellent English, can teach well, and is a charming conversationalist
to boot.” In a more frank mode, we might have said “This candidate speaks
better than average English” (recalling Garrison Keillor’s statement about

5.5. EDITING
137
the town of Lake Woebegon, in which “all the children are above average”).
When the candidate arrived to assume his position, the hiring institution
often found that he/she could not understand even simple instructions and
had no idea how to teach.
Occasionally you will have to address a truly thorny matter in one of your
letters of recommendation. As an instance, I was once writing on behalf of a
young mathematician who was applying to several dozen ﬁrst class universi-
ties for a position. I thought that I knew this person quite well. But, a few
days before I was going to draft my letter, I learned that the candidate was
undergoing a sex change. I had to decide whether I should mention this fact
in my letter. I reasoned as follows: if he were changing from Catholicism to
Judaism, or from Democrat to Republican, or from carnivore to vegetarian, I
certainly would not consider discussing the matter in my letter of recommen-
dation for a mathematical post; so why should I treat trans-sexuality? And I
did not. Some time later, I discussed the matter with one of my mentors. He
told me that I had erred. In stern terms, he informed me that a matter like
this could aﬀect the candidate’s ability to teach, and his ability to function
as a colleague; therefore I was morally obligated to mention the matter. I
still do not know what the correct course of action should have been. I only
hope that I will not be faced with another choice like this one any time soon.
5.5
Editing
The editor interfaces between the author and the publishing mechanism.
That mechanism is either a commercial publishing house or an academic
publisher or a professional society or perhaps a free-standing journal. It is
taken for granted in this setup that the author is an expert in his subject mat-
ter, but does not know a great deal about the publishing process. The editor
probably may not know any mathematics, or may not know the mathematics
contained in this particular manuscript, but he/she is quite experienced in
publishing. He/she shepherds the author through the publishing yoga.
There is no school or training camp or “minor league” for editors. There
is no college major in editing. Most textbook editors begin as sales represen-
tatives for some publishing house and work their way up through the ranks.
Editors for the professional societies, and for the high-level monograph se-
ries, often have advanced training in mathematics or in some science. They
do not work their way up through the ranks, but are hired straight out as

138
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
editors.
There is no “typical” book editor. As noted, the editor could be a Ph.D.
in the ﬁeld who is plying his trade and his passion in the publishing realm.
He could be a college English major. In the textbook business, he could
be someone who worked his way up from sales rep to Editorial Assistant to
junior editor to editor. Your editor is a person with a passion for books, who
values learning and erudition, and who likes dealing with writers. The editor
certainly has an interest in publishing good stuﬀ.
But he is answerable
to the company.
The book editor, for example, had better publish more
successful books than not or else that editor will ﬁnd himself out on the
street. Likewise, the Managing Editor of a journal must maintain the quality
of the journal, keep the paper ﬂow robust, keep the referees and Associate
Editors in line. Publishing is a business. A lot of what the editor does is
businesslike activity: managing people, managing the ﬂow of work, seeing
that projects are completed.
From the point of view of the author, the editor is the person that you
go to when you need something or when you have a problem or when you
want to make a proposal. The editor is the “point man” for your publishing
projects.
When you send your research work into a journal, you send it to an
editor. When you send your book manuscript into a publisher, you send it
to an editor. When you come to grips with referee/reviewer reports then you
do so using the editor as an intermediary (you never deal directly with the
reviewer or referee, as the anonymity of those good folks must be protected).
When you interact with the actual publishing process, you do so through
an editor. When you negotiate the details of your publishing contract, you
usually do so through the editor. The editor may interrupt the negotiations
to say, “I have to go check with my Publisher,” or “I have to go check with
the lawyers.”3 You will never talk to the Publisher or to the lawyers directly.
The editor will serve as your conduit.
A good editor will watch over your work from inception to completion.
He/she will help enlist it in the ﬁrst place, shepherd it through the publishing
process, and rejoice with you when it hits the street. He/she will propose
3It has been my observation that editors think that it is perfectly OK for them to
invoke a higher authority—a Publisher or a lawyer (and, believe me, publishing houses
have phalanxes of lawyers). But if you, in the course of negotiations, say “I am going to
bring in my agent,” or “I am going to consult my lawyer,” then they get all bent out of
shape.

5.5. EDITING
139
and nurture your next project. He/she will be your friend and conﬁdant and
advisor.
5.5.1
The Purpose of Editors
Of course the editor represents the publisher to the world. An organization
is no better than its people, and publishing is a very human activity.
With today’s technology, it would be possible for you to simply shove
a TEX disk into one end of a big machine and, after the machine crunched
on it for a while, a box of journals or books would come out the other end.
Some robot would load it onto a truck or train, and it would eventually be
delivered to the distributor. All without human intervention.
The world could some day be run in this fashion, but I am currently
grateful that it is not. As has been described elsewhere, people add value to
every stage of the publication process:
• The editor chooses the reviewers or referees;
• The editor helps to evaluate the reviews and reports. He/she oversees
the rewriting. When there are diﬀerences between the author and the
referee, the editor helps to clear the air and put matters in perspective;
• The editor decides in which series to publish the book (if it is a book)
and in which issue to publish the paper (if it is a paper);
• For a journal, the editor maintains paper ﬂow and quality. He/she
oversees diversity in subject matter, diversity in authorship, manages
page length issues, adjudicates priority disputes, and overall keeps the
ship of state on track.
• The editor oversees the copy editing, the art editing, the page compo-
sition, and the overall production of the book;
• The editor sees that the book goes to press on schedule, or the paper
goes to the printer on schedule, and that it is handled properly after it
hits the street.
I can honestly tell you that it is my editors who have turned my inchoate
ravings into papers or books that we all can be proud of. They have really
added a lot, sometimes by taking me by the collar and yelling in my ear. We

140
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
all need guidance and direction when we are on unfamiliar turf. Get to know
your editor and listen to him/her.
5.5.2
Types of Editors
No list of the various types of editors can be complete. What we can do here
is to describe some of the principal types of editors.
Journal Editors
(a)
The Managing Editor This is the editor who oversees the entire op-
eration of the journal—from the academic point of view. He/she deals
with the people at the publishing house, he/she supervises all the As-
sociate Editors (see below), he/she worries about the quality of the
papers, he/she worries about the paper ﬂow. The Managing Editor
makes the ﬁnal decision about the publication (or not) of each paper.
If there are problems with the refereeing, problems with plagiarism,
problems with priority disputes, he/she is the person on the scene. It
is a big job, with many responsibilities. If you (as author) are ever
having trouble with an Associate Editor (see below), then your ﬁrst
recourse is to consult the Managing Editor.
The Managing Editor must keep track of the volume of papers, and
must be sure that there are enough papers for the upcoming issues.
He/she must maintain quality. And he/she must keep in touch with the
people from the publishing house as needed. When necessary, he/she
will have to communicate with authors and referees (although this will
usually be handled by the Associate Editors). If a paper is too long
in process, or the Associate Editor is having trouble getting a useful
referee’s report, or if other diﬃculties arise, the Managing Editor will
usually have to step in and make things right.
Another global issue that the Managing Editor must worry about
is the rate of acceptance. Certainly journals are judged in part by the
percentage of submitted papers that pass the refereeing process and
make it into print. If a given journal only publishes 10% of papers sub-
mitted, then it is perceived to be a tough journal with high standards.
If instead it publishes 80% of papers submitted, then it is thought to
be a journal with no standards or taste.

5.5. EDITING
141
Of course this is a balancing act. The journal needs enough papers
so that it can keep publishing in a timely manner. But it wants to
publish only good papers. And some journals—such as The Annals of
Mathematics—have an automatic pre-ﬁltering process: The Annals is
perceived to be so tough that most authors are chary of submitting
anything to such an august and forbidding judge. So the rejection rate
at the Annals—while still high—is perhaps not as high as one might
suppose.
Alongside the publisher, the Managing Editor must worry about
paper ﬂow. If the journal does not have enough papers so that the
issues may be published in a timely manner, then the entire enterprise
will look bad. Such a situation is embarrassing for all concerned. And
there will be a temptation to accept papers that are substandard. What
can a Managing Editor do to sustain paper ﬂow? The journal could
advertise. The members of the Editorial Board could promote word-
of-mouth endorsement. Especially for a startup journal, it is necessary
to make extra eﬀort to establish a presence and make authors aware
of this new forum for their work. The Managing Editor can work hard
to be sure that the journal has a strong reputation and that it is well
known that it handles papers expeditiously and fairly.
(b)
The Associate Editors The Associate Editor (AE) is answerable to
the Managing Editor. Typically, the Managing Editor will assign cer-
tain papers to the Associate Editor for handling. It is the Associate
Editor’s job to get each paper refereed, to evaluate the referee’s re-
port, and to make a recommendation (to publish or not to publish)
to the Managing Editor (who makes the ﬁnal decision about publica-
tion). The Associate Editor may handle ten to twenty papers per year
(although some journals with a heavy paper ﬂow could have a notably
higher work load).
On rare occasions the Associate Editor will read a paper himself—in
eﬀect, he/she is the referee. He/she should only indulge in this service
occasionally—when the paper is of particular personal interest, or in a
ﬁeld of his/her special expertise, or on a subject in which he/she has a
stake. For it is only the AE’s job to get a paper reviewed (by a third
party). It far exceeds his/her obligation to actually read the papers.
The Associate Editor must know how to ﬁnd a good referee for any

142
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
given paper. There are several parameters to consider: (i) the referee
should be an expert in the subject area, (ii) the referee should be
dependable, (iii) the referee should not be prejudiced, (iv) the referee
should be someone who can get the job done. Of course a good and
experienced editor is like a baseball pitcher: he/she knows everyone
who is out there and who could be a referee; he knows whom he/she
can count on and work with.
In some instances the editor will not have a name at his/her
ﬁngertips to be the referee for a given paper. There are some standard
tricks for dealing with this situation. One is to look at the names in
the References section of the paper. The other is to use MathSciNet
to search for the names of authors of cognate papers. A third method
is to ask a colleague.
A good editor must also know how to deal with the referees that
he/she has working on papers. He/she must keep track of how long each
referee has had his/her assignment (a spreadsheet could be useful here).
Managing paper ﬂow, and backlog, is an essential part of running an
eﬃcient operation. You may ﬁnd that using an electronic calendar or
personal digital assistant is a good way to monitor work ﬂow. Business
people use an array of project-management matrices (such as GANNT
charts, named after Henry L. Gannt) for this purpose. Even using a
separate paper calendar—just for tracking papers and referees—may
be just what you need to keep on top of things.4
Part of this managing process is to exercise some discretion: If the
referee is handling a paper that is three pages long, then perhaps the
editor can expect a quick report; if the paper if ﬁfty pages long, then the
editor should allow some more time. If the editor must pester the referee
for a report, he/she should do so in such a way that everyone comes
away feeling good about the transaction. Start with a friendly e-mail—
this should be perceived as proactive, and in the vein of a “how ya
doin’?” note. If you cannot get a useful response from your electronic
message, then try a more formal letter. Sometimes the Associate Editor
4Some commercial publishers, such as Elsevier, have completely electronicized their
operations. Today with Elsevier, papers are submitted electronically, assigned to Associate
Editors electronically, and refereed electronically. The editors can use the OnLine system—
with considerable ease—to track papers, see where they are in the editorial process, check
how long they have been in the system, and to take action when required.

5.5. EDITING
143
must resort to telephoning an intransigent referee. Try to make this a
positive encounter. Obviously the referee is a busy person with many
obligations. He simply has not gotten to this particular task. Try to
talk him/her through the situation so that you can work out a means
to a completion date. If these reminders are handled propitiously, then
the referee will feel that his eﬀorts are appreciated and that he/she and
the editor are working together to get this job done.
Diﬀerent journals have diﬀerent routines for handling the refereeing
process. Some will have the Associate Editor send a hard copy of the
paper to the referee, together with a cover letter (which is usually boil-
erplate) containing some formal guidelines for the refereeing process.
Others may send an electronic version (probably a *.pdf ﬁle) as an e-
mail attachment, together with an e-mail text with referee’s guidelines.
These guidelines—whether hard copy or electronic—may certainly sug-
gest a time frame for the refereeing process as well. It is not often that
the instructions to the referee will give detailed advice on what points
to address or how to formulate the report. But many times the letter
will say, “Our journal has high standards. We only wish to publish
timely papers that are important. Please put this paper in context,
tell us whether the results are signiﬁcant and why.” Or words to that
eﬀect. The letter to the referee also will usually not suggest a length
for the report. But I will suggest one right now.
The report needs to be long enough to do the job. If the paper is
short (ﬁve pages or fewer), then a referee’s report of one page or less
will surely be adequate. The referee’s report must address a number of
key points, and these are outlined in Section 4.10.
Too often have I seen referee’s reports that said
I read some of this paper.
It looks pretty good.
I can-
not vouch for all the mathematics, but it’s probably OK.
I wouldn’t mind if you publish the paper, but I shall leave
the ﬁnal decision up to you.
A report such as this suggests a careless attitude towards the entire
editorial process, and a sloppy and irresponsible view of scholarship in
general. It is certainly an uninformative report, and not a useful one.5
5I know excellent mathematicians—who are also very serious and punctilious referees—

144
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
This is almost certainly a referee that you will not want to use in the
future.
What should an editor do with a referee’s report that is irresponsible
or inconclusive or incomplete or hopelessly out-to-lunch? My personal
view is that it is unprofessional and incorrect for an editor to simply
“lose” a referee’s report—even a lousy one. The referee’s report, no
matter how slipshod and devoid of information, is part of the paper
trail for this paper. You need to keep it as part of your archive. It
is not likely, but it is conceivable, that a couple of years later that
selfsame referee may come to you and say, “You know, I did not much
like that paper, and you published it anyway. How come?” You could
say, “Your report was quite terse and uninformative. It did not make
a deﬁnitive recommendation. I had to make an executive decision.”
That is OK, and you will probably live to see another day. But much
better is if you can say. “Your report was helpful but not deﬁnitive. I
solicited two other reports to help me put the matter in perspective.
They were quite enthusiastic, and tipped the scale for publication. So
that is what I did.”
In short, it may happen that you will get a referee’s report—and
you may even have to wait quite a time for it—that is hasty, slipshod,
and does not tell you what you want to know. There is no alternative
but to solicit one or two additional reports and then base your decision
on the aggregate of the information that you have.
Of course a good Associate Editor must know how to read and assess
a referee’s report.
The ideal report will say, “This paper deﬁnitely
should be accepted. It meets the journal’s standards (which are thus
and such) and it has these speciﬁc merits.” Or the report may instead
say, “This paper in no way meets the publishing criteria of this journal
and must be rejected. The reasons are . . . .” Unfortunately, a great
many referee’s reports are rather more circumspect. Some reports will
who often write a referee’s reports that is longer than the paper itself. The referee oﬀers
copious commentary, new proofs of each of the results, a plethora of references and cita-
tions, and myriad other bits of knowledge. This is OK I guess, but it is really overkill.
More information than anyone needs or desires. When a journal editor solicits a referee’s
report he/she is conducting a business transaction. He/she needs a very speciﬁc piece of
information or advice—that is, whether or not he/she should publish this paper. Brevity
is the soul of wit.

5.5. EDITING
145
make some commentary on the paper at hand and then say, “I leave it
to you to decide whether to publish this paper.” So the AE must know
what to do.
If the details of the referee’s report are incisive and detailed and on
point, then the AE may be able to draw an appropriate conclusion (to
accept or reject). If not, he/she may have to spend some time himself
looking at the paper. Or he may need to ﬁnd a second referee. This
does not necessarily mean that the ﬁrst report had no value; it simply
was not adequate to get to the ﬁnish line.
The Associate Editor will want to think carefully about the mechan-
ics of rejecting a paper. The fact that a paper is rejected does not have
to mean that the work is bad or the author is a weak mathematician.
Papers get rejected for lots of reasons. It is always best if the Associate
Editor can help the author of a rejected paper to maintain his dignity
and learn from the experience.6 The following sample rejection letter
indicates the sort of proactive sentiment that one can express in the
process of turning down a paper:
Dear Professor Schlivovitz:
Thank you for submitting your paper New socles for Mo-
ufang loops to The Journal of Symbolic Number Crunching.
I enclose the referee’s report.
As you can see, the referee is not enthusiastic about pub-
lication. He feels that the results are too technical to justify
the length. Moreover, the writing is sometimes careless and
the proofs not always convincing. There is a list of speciﬁc
errata and suggestions that may help you to improve the pa-
per. Note particularly the error cited on page 12; this could
be a serious gap, and clearly requires some attention.
Given our severe backlog, and the high quality of papers
that we are receiving these days, we are forced to reject your
6Some journals remove the rejection process from the Associate Editor’s hands. Some
central oﬃce sends out the rejection letters. I, the author of this book, have no inﬂuence
over central oﬃces. So I am addressing these remarks to an Associate Editor (or Managing
Editor) who may have to handle rejections.

146
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
paper. We wish you good luck publishing it elsewhere.
Sincerely,
Sophus P. Lie
Associate Editor, Journal of Symbolic Number Crunching
In point of fact, the Associate Editor may not always be able
to use the referee’s report as written. The report may contain infor-
mation that compromises the referee’s identity. It may also contain
unnecessarily critical, or nonconstructive, or even insulting, remarks.
Sometimes it is necessary for the Associate Editor to edit, abbreviate,
or even summarize a referee’s report. I sometimes ﬁnd myself para-
phrasing the report. Again, your goal here is to help the author to
understand the situation so that he can improve the paper and get it
published somewhere.
These days it is fairly diﬃcult to ﬁnd good referees who will do the
job, and do it eﬃciently and well. My advice would be not to burden
your referees with a list of instructions about what you want them to
write in their report, or what form you want that report to take. It is
your job to take the report that is submitted and make good use of it.
This could entail editing or rephrasing the referee’s report; so be it.
As I have said elsewhere, a good Associate Editor values his/her
referees and the good working relationship he/she has with them. Thus
he/she does not want to impose, or to over-use the referee’s services.
After all, if the guy is good, then he is probably being dinged by a
dozen or more journals to do refereeing jobs. The poor referee also has
to live his life. I try not to use any referee more frequently than once
every year.
(c)
The In-House Editor If you are the Managing Editor or Associate
Editor for a journal published by a commercial publishing house, then
you will work with an editor who is paid by, and is answerable to, that
publishing house. In the industry, such a person is sometimes known
as a “Publishing Editor”. These monickers can vary from company to

5.5. EDITING
147
company. The titles “Commissioning Editor”, “Acquisitions Editor”,
and “Series Editor” are also used. If you are the editor for a journal
published by a professional society, then you will work with an editor
who is employed full-time by that society; and he will have one of these
titles, or some variant thereof.
This “in-house” editor will not exercise much say over the academic
aspects of the journal. That is your (the academic editor’s) purview.
Rather, the in-house editor is concerned with scheduling, with paper
ﬂow, with subscription management, and with keeping track of the
money. He will usually not try to encroach on your turf, and you will
certainly have little interest in encroaching on his. Typically, you will
have once- or twice-yearly meetings with the in-house editor to discuss
policy issues and management issues.
In the interim you will have
regular communications by phone and by e-mail.
Proceedings Editors
Many of us get our start in editing by becoming involved in producing a
conference proceedings.
Your role will be as “editor” of the proceedings.
You will usually work with an in-house editor at the publishing house that
will produce the proceedings.
This is a good mechanism for learning the ropes. For you must determine
how to collect papers, how to get them refereed, and then you must decide
which ones to publish and which ones not. You will interface with other
editors, you will communicate with authors, and you will interact with the
in-house editor at the publishing house of your proceedings volume.
This experience will give you a taste of the editing life—both its joys and
its sorrows. You will get the satisfaction of putting a slice of the mathematical
pie before a focused audience, and having had an impact on your ﬁeld that
may have lasting value.
And this may be a good place to note that a volume of conference pro-
ceedings places special demands on the editors. First, the conference will
have been peopled by many of your friends, collaborators, and colleagues.
They will all be assuming that their work will appear in this volume. The
tradition in mathematics, up until about twenty years ago, was that confer-
ence proceedings were not carefully refereed and they were often a repository
for rather technical work that was not necessarily of the highest standard.
Times have changed, and those few publishers that will even consider pub-

148
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
lishing a conference proceedings today will almost certainly demand that
you, the editor, have the papers refereed.
I usually ﬁnd it best to play musical chairs with the papers for a con-
ference proceedings. Send the paper of participant A to participant B for
a referee’s report. Make it clear that you want a serious refereeing job, but
also make it clear that you expect to publish most of the works of most
of the participants. Endeavor to obtain constructive referee’s reports that
have useful recommendations about both the mathematics and the writing.
In this way you can maintain quality while showing everyone that they are
being treated fairly and as expected.
You will need to set page limits on the papers for your conference proceed-
ings—and enforce them. You do not want a collection of 100-page-long semi-
unreadable diatribes in your volume.
Instead you want a book that will
be a milestone in the subject, and a source for those who want to become
acquainted with the latest ideas in this area of mathematics.
The web site
http://www.ams.org/authors/checklist.html
has a useful checklist for the preparation of a conference proceedings. This
checklist in fact can serve as a useful touchstone for most any book in which
the author/editor bears the primary burden for preparation. It addresses
such issues as
• Check the size of the type block (i.e., the printed matter—without the
margins—on the page);
• Be sure that the entire manuscript is carefully proofread;
• Be sure that all necessary permissions have been obtained;
• Be sure that ﬁgures have been properly rendered in PostScript, and
at the proper resolution;
• Be sure that all grant and contract support has been acknowledged;
• Include 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification Numbers and Key
Words
Endeavor to convince some of your conference participants to write survey
articles. You, the editor, might consider penning one. The survey articles

5.5. EDITING
149
in a conference proceedings are like anchor stores in a mall. These are the
underpinnings that hold the project together; they serve as a basis for the
other papers; they give the volume substance and depth. So you must be
careful in choosing those who will write these seminal pieces.
The conference proceedings volume should have a strong and compelling
introduction. Tell what the conference was about, and what the subject is
about. Introduce the papers, and introduce the participants. If the proceed-
ings is dedicated to a particular mathematician, then that will help to give
your thoughts a focus. Relate the subject of the conference and the papers to
the work of this individual. Tell a little bit about his contribution to math-
ematics, and why it is eminently suitable to dedicate this volume to him.
Your introduction can be three or four or more pages. It should be fulsome
and detailed, but should not become bogged down in extraneous tedium.
Editing a conference proceedings can be a rewarding and worthwhile ex-
perience. It is a good bit of work, but the end result can be valuable and
much appreciated. In your ﬁrst go-round, do not try to do the entire job
alone. Get a couple of colleagues—perhaps some more seasoned scholars—to
help you out. Make it clear that you will shoulder the main burden, but get
them on board so that you can get useful advice. It is a good way to make
friends, and it will help you to produce a better volume.
Book Editors
There are many diﬀerent types of editors associated with the process of pub-
lishing books. Some of these—the most common ones—are described below.
(a)
The Acquisitions Editor The Acquisitions Editor is the person who
ﬁnds authors for his book series. Many times such an editor will visit
college and university campuses or go to professional meetings. The
editor will collar people, talk them up, ﬁnd out if they have any book
projects in the works. In some cases the Acquisitions Editor will con-
vince one of these hapless souls (who in fact had not been thinking of
writing a book) to write a book. In other cases he will ﬁnd someone
who is already writing or planning a book, and convince him to hook
up with his company’s publishing program. In summary, the purpose
of the Acquisitions Editor is to attract books to the company.
(b)
The Production Editor The production editor oversees the process
of developing a book from manuscript form to the format and medium

150
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
which is ready to go to press. This process includes copy editing, art
editing, page composition, accuracy checking, and many other proce-
dures as well.
(c)
The Copy Editor Working under the supervision of a Production
Editor, the Copy Editor reads your manuscript painstakingly and checks
it for grammar, syntax, accuracy, and consistency (these days, the Copy
Editor and the Production Editor could be the same person). He will
be in constant touch with you to work out rough spots or troublesome
passages. A good Copy Editor has a deep and detailed knowledge of
English and usage.
And he will also have a lot of good sense.
He
will know the Chicago Manual of Style [CHI] forwards and backwards,
and will be prepared to cite it chapter and verse. He will know the
diﬀerence between “comprise” and “compose”, between “alternative”
and “alternate”, between “ﬂout” and “ﬂaunt”, between “that” and
“which”, between “less” and “fewer”, and between “good” and “well”.
And he will be prepared to teach these things to you.
It is a pleasure to work with a good Copy Editor. You will derive
a lot from the experience, and your book will be much better for the
process.
(d)
The Art Editor The art editor will be an expert on graphic design,
on the visual display of quantitative information (see the lovely books
[TUF1], [TUF2]), and on the software that is available for producing art
for books (this includes Adobe Illustrator,® Corel DRAW,® Harvard
Graphics,® MacDraw,® MacPaint,® xfig, and many others). He will
help turn the artwork that you have supplied yourself (whether these
be hand-drawn sketches or semi-professional pictures produced with
drafting equipment or graphics that you have created with software or
pictures that you have borrowed from other sources) into publication-
quality graphics. The end result will be ﬁgures for your book that will
reﬂect well on you and reﬂect well on the publisher.
(e)
The Design Editor If you are publishing an elementary textbook,
then design is a big part of the book’s future success. Cover design,
page design, page layout, design of each of the page elements (how does
a theorem look? how does a remark look?, how are ﬁgures displayed?,
etc.), use of color, use of boxes and other elements for design and

5.5. EDITING
151
display, design of the front and back matter, all play a role in how the
book will do in the marketplace.
To be sure, any book has a cover design and a page design and an
overall look and feel. Specialists at the publishing house will apply their
expertise to make your book have the right gestalt for the marketplace
for which it is intended. [As an instance, a book on complex analysis
for engineers will be given a more ﬂashy essence, with a cover having
purples and yellows and design elements that jump out at you. This is
what the engineering market expects. A similar book for a mathematics
audience will have a diﬀerent, perhaps more subdued, appearance.]
However the process for an advanced book is considerably more low-
key, and much less labor-intensive, than for an elementary book. With
elementary books, appearance is a big part of what the book is about.
(f)
The Developmental Editor For an elementary book (certainly not
for a monograph) there is usually a developmental editor assigned to
oversee the reviewing process, help the author to interpret the reviews,
recommend revisions and augmentations to the manuscript, supervise
the design, and shepherd the project to completion. The developmental
editor will help to oversee the work of the copy editor, the art editor, etc.
A good developmental editor is a blessing; a bad one is a nightmare.
Editorial Assistants
Both book editors and journal editors can and will have Editorial Assistants.
I have an Editorial Assistant to help me with the six journals that I work on.
She is a marvel. She keeps track of every paper and every editor and every
referee. She knows when a paper has been out too long with the editor or
with the referee. She knows when there are problems (with an editor who
is not doing his job, or an author who is not cooperating, or a referee who
is unreachable). She interfaces with the typesetter and the printer and the
subscription managing service. She brings any problems to my attention,
and I handle them. This is appropriate; for it is I who have the authority to
whip people into line, and it is I who have the scientiﬁc expertise. But she
does all the legwork to manage all the information and keep the manuscripts
and the schedules at our ﬁngertips. I could not function without her.
Likewise, a book editor uses his assistant to keep track of projects and
authors and reviews. As with my own editorial assistant whom I described

152
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
above, the assistant to a book editor does all the legwork and clerical work
so that the editor can be on top of all his assignments.
It is sometimes true in a publishing house that a good Editorial Assistant
will eventually be promoted to editor. A good editor can be promoted to
senior editor or Managing Editor or Executive Editor, and after that to
Publisher.
The Editorial Board
Often a book series or a journal will have an Editorial Board.
For a book series, there will be one or two Consulting Editors (who are,
together with a designated “Publishing Editor” at the publishing house, in
charge of the series) and then perhaps a dozen members of the Editorial
Board. The members of this board are selected by the Consulting Editors.
They function to attract authors to the series, to select subject areas and
topics for books, and to review manuscripts. The Editorial Board provides
the imprimatur for each book in the series. For example, it meant a great
deal to me when my ﬁrst book was published in a series for which Lipman
Bers was the Consulting Editor and Richard Courant one of the founders.
Members of the board are encouraged to contribute volumes to the series;
it gives the series credibility if those who manage it believe in it enough to
publish in it.
For a journal, the Editorial Board is the union of all the editors. The
Journal of Geometric Analysis has a Managing Editor (yours truly), a body
of Executive Editors, and a larger corpus of Associate Editors. The Executive
Editors are ﬁgureheads. They suggest policy and serve to attract good papers
to the journal. The Associate Editors carry the burden of the work: they are
assigned papers to have refereed. The Managing Editor oversees the entire
operation, and makes the ﬁnal decision about what gets published and when.
5.5.3
Dealing with Editors
Dealing with a journal editor is straightforward. He/she is the be-all and
end-all of your dealings with any given journal.
You send him/her your
paper, he/she gets it refereed, he/she evaluates the reports, he/she makes a
publishing decision, and he/she conveys it to you. If you have any complaints
then you deal with that editor and that editor only (except under egregious
circumstances—see Section 5.7). It is a simple transaction.

5.5. EDITING
153
Book editors are diﬀerent. There are many diﬀerent types of book editors
(as previously indicated), and they all play diﬀerent roles. The best way to
deal with book editors is politely. I know too many academics who get bristly
and are arrogant when any editor dares to suggest anything. This is no way
to do business. Most editors know their limitations. They realize that they
often do not know whereof they speak. The right thing to do is to listen
to what the editor has to say and then either agree with it or disagree with
it. But do so in a constructive and courteous manner. If you are going to
continue to do business with this guy, this is really the only way to behave.
As described elsewhere in this book, there are Copy Editors and Produc-
tion Editors who will work with you on the prose in your book. Syntax,
style, and consistency will be issues under discussion. These people have a
good sense of how to use the language, and their advice is generally valuable.
When we write mathematics, we tend to be absorbed by the technicalities
and therefore to overlook various writing issues and organizational issues.
The editors can help you shore up your book and make it a more powerful
and useful academic tool.
You want to develop and maintain a good working relationship with your
editor(s). This is especially true for a book editor, with whom you will be
dealing over a protracted period of time. Let him/her know how your work
is going, what kind of progress you are making. Also let him/her know if
you have hit roadblocks, and if you can use some help. Get into the habit
of going to the January meetings of the AMS/MAA and schmooze up with
your editor. Go out for a drink and get to know him/her.
It is really to your advantage to have a proactive relationship—indeed a
friendly relationship—with your editor. If, after the book is written and you
are in the production process, you ﬁnd that there are problems—perhaps
the book is too long in production or the ﬁgures are not being rendered
satisfactorily—then you can go to him as a friend and seek help (and get
it!). Later on, if you are not satisﬁed with the way that your book is being
promoted, you can go to the editor and seek some attention. If you will be
writing more books in the future, then it is a special pleasure to be working
with an editor with whom you have developed a personal (and productive)
relationship.

154
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
5.6
What if You are a Foreigner?
The United States is currently, and has been for many years, a welcoming
place to foreign mathematicians. Certainly we beneﬁted immensely from the
inﬂux of European mathematicians prior to World War II. This brain drain
really helped to put American Mathematics on the map. In the late 1980s
there was another great inﬂux of Chinese and Russian and other Eastern
European mathematicians. Certainly our professional culture and our overall
quality was enriched by this social transference.
If you are a foreign mathematician getting settled at a college or university
in the United States then you will have certain adjustments to make. The
nature of our students, the nature (and pace and level) of our classes, and
the university structure and administration will all be unfamiliar to you. If
you want to ﬁt in, if you want to succeed, if you want to get along with your
colleagues, then you need to learn a bit about your new environment.7
In many European countries, a test is given to all students in high school
to determine their future course. As a result, some students are directed to
the University and others are directed to trade schools. A consequence of this
system is that the Universities are less open and more focused than in the
United States. European universities often do not have breadth requirements,
and students jump right into their majors early on. It is quite common for
an Italian math major to take 21 year-long math courses during his/her
undergraduate math education. I am a famous, senior mathematician, and I
have not had 21 year-long courses in my entire life!
The European students I have been describing here will also have had
a good deal of math in high school—rather more than a typical American
student gets exposed to. So an easy mistake for a foreign-born instructor in
our country to make would be to misjudge the level of American students.
To walk into a calculus class and assume a degree of sophistication and
7In the year 2007 more than seven senior mathematicians in Sweden were terminated
or relieved of their duties or forced to retire or resign. This occurred at several institutions
around the country. Many of these individuals were quite accomplished mathematicians,
and well known in the international mathematics community. And most of them were
foreigners (not Swedes). It appears that the nub of the diﬃculty in most cases is that
these were people who made no eﬀort to become team players. Many of them refused
to learn Swedish, were disruptive at faculty meetings, were constantly lodging complaints
with the administration. Swedes are people who value collegiality and cooperation. Even
though some of these faculty had been on the scene for twenty years or more, the powers
that be decided that enough was enough.

preparation that simply does not exist. The foreign-born teacher may also
assume a degree of maturity, and a level of study skills, that deﬁnitely is
not present. He/she may give exams that are way to hard. Or show a great
impatience with elementary questions. Or appear to be rigid or unbending
or unfair.
Of course everyone respects the background and the training and the
scholarly standards that your foreign education gave you. But you don’t
want to be the sore thumb in your Department. You want to get along, you
want to be someone that the group can depend on, and you don’t want to
make waves with your teaching. With your research you can of course ﬂy as
high and as close to the sun as you may wish. Set any standard of excellence
that you please. But with teaching you may have to retrain (and restrain)
yourself.
There is a well known story of a German Professor who was spending
a sabbatical leave at a large university in the Midwest.
To supplement
his income, he taught a course for them. In fact they gave him remedial
trigonometry to teach. He had a standard 350-page textbook written by
some well-known American author. He stormed into the undergraduate of-
ﬁce at the end of the ﬁrst week and declared, “OK, I’ve ﬁnished with this
book. Now what do you want me to do?” Just an illustration of how there
can be a disconnect when people come from diﬀerent backgrounds.
The administrative aspects of life are also going to be diﬀerent. I have one
colleague at Washington University who is from India, and he is constantly
baﬄed by our dealings with the administration. At one point we were trying
to compose a planning document for the Dean, laying out our vision of the
Department’s development over the next ﬁve years. We on the committee
kept saying, “Well, the Dean seems to want this. And if we want to please the
Dean then we should do that. And the Administration seems to have those
expectations.” After a while, in exasperation, my Indian colleague said, “If
you already know what the Dean wants, then why do you call it ‘planning’?”
Dealing with the college or university administration is something that
we all have to get used to. It can be mysterious, it can be Byzantine, it
can be frustrating. Talking to each other about it is one way to come to
grips with the situation. Working with the Administration is another. It
is an observed fact that very few foreign-born scholars become high-level
university administrators in this country. There is just a barrier there that
is hard to bridge.
I have a friend who was quite an accomplished mathematician in Texas.

156
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
At one point in middle age he became a high-level adminstrator at a Uni-
versity in Germany. This took us all by surprise. Of course his wife was
German, and they had been interested in moving to Germany, so this change
made sense in terms of where he wanted his life to go. But it was astonishing
to see that he could sell himself to the Germans, and succeed in his new
position.
The bottom line for the foreign-born professor trying to make his/her way
in this country is to be open-minded and to listen. Talk to people. Watch
television. Learn how things are done. Learn to understand the language
at a visceral and colloquial level (this is really necessary if you are going
to understand your students). Many foreign faculty become very popular
teachers, and I believe that this is for several reasons:
• They bring a fresh approach to teaching that the students appreciate.
• They are willing to re-think their attitude in the classroom and to learn
the basic precepts anew.
• They create an atmosphere that the instructor and the students are in
this together. They make the learning experience a shared adventure.
• They inject refreshing aspects of their foreign culture into the discourse
of the subject and help to bring it alive for the students.
I will repeat that our welcoming of foreign colleagues has been, and con-
tinues to be, a source of strength for our profession. All of us should pitch
in to help them acclimate, and to make them part of who we are and what
we do.

National Service
The AMS (American Mathematical Society) and the MAA (Mathematical
Association of America), to name just two, are large national organizations.
Each has a highly developed infrastructure for both governance and service.
It would be quite reasonable, and natural, for you to belong to both the AMS
and the MAA (and perhaps some other mathematical organizations as well).
Doing so, you may ﬁnd yourself asked to serve on some national committees.
These service committees are of many diﬀerent stripes. The AMS has
more than 250 committees (see http://www.ams.org/secretary), and I cer-
tainly cannot describe them all. Among others, the AMS has

5.7. NATIONAL SERVICE
157
• an Ethics Committee
• a Publications Committee
• an Editorial Boards Committee
• a History of Mathematics Editorial Committee
• a Graduate Studies in Mathematics Committee
• an Executive Board
• a Council
• a Board of Trustees
• an Investment Committee
• a Long Range Planning Committee
• a Salary Committee
• a Nominating Committee
• an Abstracts Editorial Committee
and there are many, many more. It may be diﬃcult, at ﬁrst blush, to de-
termine which of these committees is interesting or which is important. The
Editorial Boards Committee, just as an instance, is quite important because
it governs who serves on the Editorial Boards for diﬀerent journals, and who
will serve as Managing Editor. The Nominating Committee is signiﬁcant
because it governs who is nominated for important national oﬃces.
Bear in mind that the AMS, MAA, SIAM, and all the other active and
useful mathematical professional organizations, exist for the beneﬁt of math-
ematicians.
And this includes mathematicians of all stripes—researchers,
teachers, expositors, and others. The beneﬁts that our professional organi-
zations provide for us are truly valuable, and enrich our lives. Just as an
instance, the AMS has been a pioneer and a leader in developing electronic
media for disseminating mathematics, and in exploring means to keep the
costs of research journals under control. All the professional organizations
hold important and useful meetings. They are part of the fabric that holds
our profession together.

158
CHAPTER 5. NON-RESEARCH
Serving on national committees (i.e., committees of some professional
organization) is informative and useful, and it can also be fun. It is great
to give back to the profession, and also exciting to be on top of things and
to know what is happening before anyone else does. Plus you can put this
service on your CV, and it will count—at least a little bit—towards your
tenure or promotion.

CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
6.1
What is a Chair?
Some departments have Chairmen and some have Heads.1 A Chairman is a
leader among equals. Apart from a modest salary bump for being Chairman,
the Chairman is no diﬀerent from anyone else; he/she is just the designated
point person for departmental business. A Head is diﬀerent. The Head is
answerable directly to the Dean and can make decisions autonomously—
without consulting the other faculty. The faculty can and will make recom-
mendations to the Head, but the Head makes the decisions.
Most mathematicians think that they elect their Chair or Head, and
most mathematicians would be wrong.
The Dean appoints the Chair or
Head. Period. The Dean may take the faculty vote as a recommendation, a
plebiscite, or even as a mandate. But the decision is the Dean’s and nobody
else’s. The Chair or Head serves at the pleasure of the Dean, and can be
terminated by the Dean.
In the present book we shall consistently use the word “Chair” to des-
ignate the Departmental leader (either the Chairman or the Head). Any
reﬁnement of the term will be indicated in context.
6.2
Characteristics of a Chair
Being Chair of the Department is not just a social position. It is true that
the Chair can give the “welcome back” party in the Fall, can host dinners for
colloquium speakers, and can be the standup guy at various social events.
But there is a lot more to being Department Chair than that.
A Math Department has an important pedagogical and scholarly mission.
Its charge is to educate the students and also to nurture and promote research
among its faculty. The job of the Chair is to make sure that those things
really happen as eﬀectively as possible. This involves much hard work and
many skills, plus cooperation from your colleagues and your staﬀ. It is not
to be taken lightly.
Being an eﬀective and well-liked Chair demands some people skills. You
must learn to be patient. I am proud of the fact that, during my ﬁve-year
1When Szeg˝o was at Stanford he was the Executive Head of the Mathematics
Department—appointed directly by the University President and the Board of Trustees.
Thus he had considerable power and autonomy.

6.3. FIRST, DO NO HARM
161
term as Chair, I never yelled at anyone. I never cursed at anyone. I might
have yelled and cursed in private, but nobody ever knew about it.
You can disagree with someone without losing your respect for him/her.
Any interesting topic can be viewed from many diﬀerent perspectives. It
is possible to draw a number of diﬀerent conclusions from the same set of
data.
You and your colleagues will examine a number of diﬀerent issues
together, will exchange views, and will reach some working conclusions—
often by consensus. This can be done honorably and amicably, even though
you will sometimes disagree (sometimes strongly). The point is that, at the
end, you all must be able to shake hands and move on.
The Chair can
facilitate this process.
Always remember that the Mathematics department is the faculty. It is
not the building, it is not the library, it is not the computer lab, it is not even
the students. It is the faculty. The faculty deﬁnes the curriculum, teaches
the courses, grants the degrees, does the research, and maintains the ﬂow
and direction of studies. The Chair’s job is to facilitate all this activity.
A Chair should be reasonably honest and have reasonable ethical stan-
dards. And he/she should hold others to those standards. Your professional
code will reﬂect both on you and on your department. You don’t want to
do anything that will compromise either. You may, as Chair, be put in the
position of having to call a colleague or a staﬀmember on their conduct.
You may even have to chew them out. Just remember that it is essential to
let them keep their dignity. You are only trying to educate them in the error
of their ways; you are not trying to debase them.
The American Mathematical Society has an Ethics Document which lays
out guidelines for our professional behavior. It is a good and well-thought-
out document, and one that you as Chair should be acquainted with. It can
be found at
http://www.ams.org/committee/profession/ethics.html
There is also an Ethics in Employment Document that can be found at
http://www.ams.org/committee/profession/supportive-prgms.html
6.3
First, Do No Harm
This medical admonition in fact applies to many aspects of modern life. Your
primary goal as Chair should be to do the most good for the most people

162
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
most of the time. Otherwise why do the job? There will be times when you
are faced with nothing better than a choice among evils, but even then you
are trying to minimize the harm caused.
You can take some pleasure and some satisfaction in the job of Chair if
you (a) strengthen the undergraduate program, (b) attract more and better
graduate students, (c) recruit outstanding faculty, (d) promote research, and
(e) create a convivial and productive atmosphere in the Department. And
you can then look back on your period in oﬃce as time well spent.
Most of the time, like most of us, you will be concentrating on daily
tasks, just trying to get the job done. But there will be occasions when it is
appropriate to ponder the long-term goals of your job, what you have been
able to accomplish and what you might hope to achieve. What do you want
to do next for your faculty, and what can you do to facilitate these goals?
What do you plan for the Math Major, and what speciﬁc policies can you
implement to eﬀect those plans? What can you do to strengthen and enhance
the graduate program, and who can help you do it?
You should always be motivated by the concept of the greatest good
for the greatest number. It is almost always a mistake to pander to special
interests—even if that special interest is a wonderful mathematician who just
proved a great theorem.
6.4
How to Become the Chair
First, it is virtually a pre-requisite to being Chair that you be a full Profes-
sor. This is in part because you are supposed to be a leader, and therefore
you should have some seniority. Perhaps more important is that your job
will entail promotions of Associate Professors to full Professor and other per-
sonnel questions that virtually necessitate that you have a senior rank in the
department.
There are exceptions to what I just said. One of my former Ph.D. students
served as Chair of her department when she was still an Assistant Professor.
But this was an unusual situation; the department had just two faculty, and
they took turns.
In some departments there will actually be a campaign for the Chair-ship.
Each candidate will be given various opportunities to make his/her pitch,
answer questions, show his/her wares. In other departments the process is
treated more dispassionately. The names will just be put on a ballot and a

6.5. HOW TO STAY CHAIR
163
vote taken. In still other departments there will be a single faculty meeting
in which all the candidates can let it all hang out, answer questions, strut
their stuﬀ. And then there is a vote. I can tell you by contrast that, in the
Chemistry Department at Washington University (the Dean is a Chemist),
there is no vote and precious little consultation of the faculty. The Dean just
strikes a deal with one of the faculty to be Chair, there is a handshake, and
that’s it. And Chemistry is deﬁnitely one of his favored departments!
In any event, when it becomes time to select a new Chair, it is common
for the departmental members to be consulted in some fashion (at some
highly proletarian departments, like U. C. Berkeley, the staﬀand even the
janitors are sometimes consulted).
In most cases there will be a formal
ballot. Sometimes there will be a departmental meeting at which each of the
candidates will make a speech and foment some discussion. Sometimes, in
order to sidestep the idea that the department is “electing” the Chair, the
Dean will actually sit down and talk to each faculty member in private. This
way he/she can assess sentiment and (one hopes) identify a consensus.
When the dust clears, the Dean will issue an announcement saying, “I
have asked Professor Delmore Schwartz to serve as Chair for the next ﬁve
years and he has agreed.” And that is it. There will be some mechanism for
the sitting Chair to move out of the royal oﬃce, and the new Chair will be
moved in, and there you have it.
The term for the Chair will vary considerably from school to school and
department to department.
A Head (the autocratic type of Head that I
described at the beginning of this discussion) is by nature more like a benev-
olent dictator and is liable to serve for as long as ten years. A Chairman (the
more populistic leader that I described at the beginning of this discussion)
is generally understood to be rotating, so the term could be three years or
ﬁve years. Often the term is renewable. Deans like working with a Head or
Chairman who will be in oﬃce for a while. Assuming that this is someone
the Dean can get along with, the Dean prefers a seasoned veteran whom he
has dealt with before, and who is reliable and steady.
6.5
How to Stay Chair
An experienced and somewhat embittered Department Chair once said to
me that he viewed his life as a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space. Each of his
colleagues represented a dimension. And every year the dimension of his

164
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
space shrunk. Which is to say that every year there were fewer people in
the department who would talk to him. His list of friends was growing ever
shorter.
The trouble with being Chair is that your two chief jobs are (i) to explain
the Dean to the Department and (ii) to explain the Department to the Dean.
The Dean, if he/she is an experienced administrator, will probably not get
terribly emotional when you discuss teaching loads or salaries or research
track records with him/her.
But the faculty—especially those with little
acumen or experience for administration—are liable to get quite exercised
over these same questions. And of course to blame you for any circumstances
that do not suit their fancy. You may rapidly become the “bad guy,” and be
subjected to accusations like, “You are no longer one of us. You are now a
patsy for the administration.”
This is certainly not what you signed on for when you agreed to be Chair.
And surely you never planned to cut down on your Christmas card list. But
it is a hard reality of life that people who know full well that they have no
control over taxes or social welfare or the war in Iraq do in fact believe that
they have, or should have, considerable sway over the direction and future
of the Math Department. If these people feel that you, in collusion with
the Dean, are wresting that power from their hands, then they are liable to
become exasperated and to behave rather irrationally in the process.
I certainly do not claim to have the magic pill that will help you to address
these issues. I can advise you, if you are Chair, to run your Department in as
open a fashion as possible. Make extra eﬀorts to be sure that everyone feels
they have a voice in all important decisions. And even some of the minor
ones. Have plenty of committees so that everyone feels they are taking part.
Have plenty of Deputies and Vice-Chairs and Associate Chairs so that you
can spread the power around. Have plenty of faculty meetings.
A really popular thing to do—something that worked well for me when I
was Chair—is to have frequent teas.2 Many of the top departments, such as
Princeton and Chicago and Harvard, have tea every afternoon. You can do
this too if the resources are available. And of course you, as Chair, should
attend the tea. This is everyone’s opportunity to interact with you informally,
sound you out on key issues, ﬁnd out what is in the air. It is a great way to
2The idea of mathematicians having tea together each day was begun by Oswald Veblen
at Princeton in the 1920s. He was married to a British woman and thought the ceremony
charming. So he instituted it in the Math Department there, and the custom spread.

6.5. HOW TO STAY CHAIR
165
keep the information pipelines clear and running.
A good Chair is not one who never makes waves. It is not a person who
just rubber-stamps things and spends his/her time trying to make everyone
opiated and content. A good Chair has ideas and will start initiatives and
make things happen—even if some of the faculty are intransigent and un-
cooperative. If you are such a Chair, and if you have a good Dean, then
the Dean will stand behind you and help you to achieve your goals. He/she
will support you if the faculty start to get restless, and even start to com-
plain. But beware: the Dean has a bigger picture in mind; if he/she starts
to perceive you as a rabble-rouser, then there will be a price to pay.
It can happen—and this can be quite unpleasant if it happens to you—
that there will be a groundswell in the department to depose you as Chair.
This means, in eﬀect, that the Department will go directly to the Dean and
say that you are not a good or eﬀective leader and they want you replaced.
They will probably have a laundry list of complaints, some of them valid
and some not, and it will be up to the Dean to decide how to handle the
situation.
Deans are very sensitive in these matters. The Dean wants someone at
the top of the Math Department, or any department, whom he/she can de-
pend on and who won’t create excessive unrest. [The operative word here
is “excessive”, and the judgment of when the line has been crossed is ob-
viously a subjective one.] The Dean wants to know that he/she can spend
a week thinking about other things, being reasonably sure that the Math
Department will chug along without his/her direct supervision. If the mem-
bers of the Department are over in his/her oﬃce raising the roof, then this
is deﬁnitely interpreted as a negative signal.3
The Dean could decide to stand behind the Chair, and thereby tell the
department to suck it up and get with the program. This is the least likely of
all eventualities. The Dean wants to keep the people content. What is more
likely is that the Dean will call a faculty meeting at which he will preside
3You yourself should be sensitive to when it is time for you to cease being Chair. If you
have stopped being eﬀective, if you cannot garner any cooperation from your colleagues,
if your research is suﬀering, if your personal life is suﬀering, if you are no longer achieving
your goals, if there is a great successor waiting in the wings, then perhaps it is time to
move on. Chat regularly with your friends and colleagues about how things look, and
what are the prospects for the future. Consult your spouse or partner. Be mature and
realistic about the situation. There are other things in life than being Chair of the Math
Department.

166
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
and attempt to ﬁnd out what is in the air. Even with or without a faculty
meeting, it is likely that the Dean will call for new nominees for Chair, and
then the Department will go through the exercise of choosing a new major
duomo. The sitting leader will be retired, and life will go on.4
Unfortunately a situation as we have just described is quite humiliating
for the Chair who is deposed. I know of situations where the Chair was so
discomﬁted that he retired or quit or moved to another institution. Many of
us do not have the ﬂexibility or resources to make such a dramatic move, so
instead we must retreat to our oﬃce and spend our time licking our wounds
and deciding what to do with the rest of our lives. It’s not a very pretty
picture.
6.6
How to Cease Being Chair
The simplest and most direct way to cease being Chair is to let your term
expire, decline to seek renewal of oﬃce, and then be done with it.
The
Department chooses another leader, and on you go. I would say that 90% of
the time that is what actually happens, nobody’s feelings are hurt, and life
proceeds.
But, as indicated in the last section, things can go awry. Feelings can be
hurt, nerves can get raw, anger can ﬂare up, and then all hell breaks loose. I
know of one situation where a young faculty member proved that the sitting
Chair—a Chair of long standing who had enjoyed many successes—had com-
mitted fraud by deliberately miscounting the ballots in an election. One can
just imagine the sort of upheaval this caused in the department. Four years
later, the department is still hurting and there is still a leadership crisis. I
know of another situation in which the Department Chair was sincere and
hardworking, but had an insuﬃcient supply of “people skills.” Everything he
did seemed to anger his colleagues more and more. That particular depart-
ment has always been very political, and people served to stoke each others’
anger. The Dean ended up pulling this Chair from oﬃce before his ﬁrst year
was out. He is now retired, living a private life, and no longer a member of
the department.
None of this is very uplifting. You don’t want it to happen to you, and
4The operative point here is that the Dean doesn’t care a whit for the sitting Chair’s
feelings. Or whether the accusations against him/her are just. The Dean has bigger ﬁsh
to fry.

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
167
probably it will not. But being Chair can be a thankless job, and it can be
a trial. It can put a strain on your marriage, and it can sap your strength.
Certainly it can interfere with your research program. If you are a good
departmental citizen, committed to the welfare of your institution and your
colleagues, then you may feel that you ought to serve your stint as Chair. But
you should go into the job with your eyes open, and exercise some caution
as you proceed.
6.7
The Chair’s Duties
What does the Chair’s job consist of?
This will vary from institution to
institution.
At some institutions—especially the elite private universities
in the East—the administration carries much of the load and the Chair’s
job is largely ceremonial. At other institutions the Dean gives the Chair a
pot of money at the beginning of the year and expects him/her to run the
Department. Don’t worry: If you become Chair, the Dean will make it very
clear what your job is and what his/her expectations are. We shall give here
an adumbration of typical duties. You will probably deal with all of them to
a greater or lesser extent.
In this long section we lay out the nuts and bolts of the Chair’s job.
Who are the people that you manage, and what are the parameters that you
manage? Who assists in the process and who does not? What will be the
roadblocks, and what will be the blessings?
It is a long journey, but an interesting one.
6.7.1
The Budget
Your Department will have a budget. This will include faculty salaries, staﬀ
salaries, money for supplies, money for travel, money for visitors, money for
colloquium speakers, money for computers, and some other miscellaneous
funds as well. Some of the wealthy elite institutions have special deals set
up whereby they leave some faculty slots unﬁlled and the Dean gives the
Department those salaries each year as an unencumbered slush fund. This
provides the Department considerable latitude in planning, in inviting last-
minute visitors, in giving a graduate student who ﬁnishes late in the year a
short-term position, in holding spur-of-the-moment conferences. You won’t
see arrangements like this at most public universities.

168
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
Money talks and baloney walks. It’s is a grim fact of life that money
shapes much of what we do. And, in an enterprise like a Math Department,
the resources and funds that you have at your disposal will be the unseen
guiding hand in every decision that you make. It has been said that Princeton
rose to be the pre-eminent Math Department in the country because of the
considerable resources that were put at its disposal (see [NAS]). The same
no doubt could be said about the University of Chicago or Harvard. For
the same reason, Sacramento City College (a rather good junior college)
will never be a powerhouse mathematics institution. Your job as Chair is
to come to terms with the budget that you have and to make the most of
it. Some Chairs become particularly skillful at prying extra resources out
of the Dean; others become skillful at ﬁnding what parts of the budget are
fungible, and making the most of the money that is at his/her disposal. Still
other Chairs spend a period of three or ﬁve years basking in considerable
frustration. The ﬁrst thing that you will learn as Chair is that managing a
Departmental budget is not the same as managing a household budget. The
sources of money are diﬀerent, the ways that they can be used are diﬀerent,
and certainly the means by which they are replenished are diﬀerent. There
will be a learning process for you to see how to manage this multi-million
dollar enterprise.5
Some universities have generous alumni and other donors who set up
special funds for distinguished speakers, distinguished visitors, faculty travel,
and the like. All of these enrich the life of the math department, and certainly
make it a pleasure to be a part of such an enterprise. Most departments,
unfortunately, live much closer to the bone.
Typically you as Chair will have a not-very-generous fund for supplies
(a fund which does not go up much each year), a not-very-generous fund
for Colloquium speakers, and a not-very-generous fund for faculty travel.
You simply have to learn to operate within the constraints that the ﬁgures
impose. Faculty will come to you all year long asking for money to attend
this conference or that function and you will have to decide how to dole out
the money. Probably you will have to put an upper limit of $500 or so on each
request, and even then you may be limited in what you can do. Graduate
students will also come to you asking aid for travel. Sometimes the Dean of
Graduate Studies can help you out with those requests.
5I am including here faculty salaries, staﬀsalaries, and operating funds. If you are
Chair of a big department then your aggregate budget could be $5 million or more.

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
169
Faculty salaries are a more interesting, and perhaps a more delicate, as-
pect of the budget picture. Everyone thinks he/she is underpaid, everyone
is touchy about their salary, everyone is jealous of everyone else’s rewards.
That’s just human nature. At some schools the Chair has nothing to say
about faculty salaries. The Dean does it all. More speciﬁcally, each faculty
member in the Fall ﬁlls out a form (sometimes called the Good Works Form)
reporting what he/she has been up to—what papers or books written, what
courses taught, what committee service performed, what invitations received,
what awards garnered, grants earned, and so forth. The Dean will evaluate
that information and use it as a basis for deciding what raises to give. The
Chair may be invited to contribute additional information about the faculty,
or to make pitches for certain individuals. Or he/she may not be.
At some schools, like my own, the Chair is told in the Spring that his/her
department will get a 3% bump in the aggregate faculty salaries. Then it
is up to the Chair (in consultation with the Dean) to decide how to divvy
up this bequest. One thing that I can tell you for certain is that you do not
want to give everyone the same dollar amount for a raise, and you also do
not want to give everyone the same percentage increase as a raise. If you
do so, the Dean will conclude that you have no leadership qualities, and you
cannot discern quality from lack thereof.
This is certainly one of the hardest parts of your job.
Life would be
grand if you could give everyone a good raise every year, but that simply is
not going to happen. There are certain individuals who are working hard and
being very productive and getting papers in the Annals and being invited to
speak at the International Congress of Mathematicians and they must be
rewarded. Others have made mighty contributions to the teaching eﬀort or
the curriculum or in particular departmental service.6 Certain other Depart-
mental members will be less productive, contribute less to the general weal,
and therefore probably deserve less. A cardinal rule of leadership is that you
must be able to make hard decisions and you must be able to defend them.
If one of your colleagues storms into your oﬃce and demands to know why
6Today a big project for a department to engage in is to apply for a VIGRE (Vertical
Integration of Research and Education in the Mathematical Sciences) grant from the NSF.
Such a grant can provide millions of dollars per year to beef up the graduate program and
the postdoc program in a department. Those math departments that have VIGREs have
been substantially changed—often for the better. Putting together a VIGRE proposal is
a huge undertaking, and the faculty member who oversees the process deserves a lot of
credit.

CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
he/she got only a 2% raise while somebody else got 4% then you must be
prepared to explain your actions.
Of course the Dean will discuss each raise with you and may overrule
some of them. Or suggest modiﬁcations. Or at least suggest that in future
years you do things diﬀerently. One dodge that you may cautiously employ is
to tell your colleague that you wanted to give him/her a higher raise but the
Dean wouldn’t approve it. You should only use this ploy when it is actually
true, and you are still honor-bound to provide the details if you can.
I know one very successful Chair who would sit down privately with each
of his colleagues every year and say, “OK, George, let’s look at your contri-
butions around here and discuss what sort of raise you should have. I can
see that your teaching evaluations are of this quality, your contributions to
the curriculum are thus and so, your publication record is at this level, and
your overall service is about average. I think that you deserve a 2% raise,
and that is what I am going to request for you. If you want more, then we
have to think about how you can contribute more. I could, for example, raise
your teaching load. Or you could be more productive in your research. Or
. . . ”
You can see that this is really a hard line, and not all of us would be up to
implementing such a policy. If you are going to endeavor to follow this path,
you should ﬁrst discuss it with the Dean and be sure that he/she supports
you. You cannot very well tell a colleague that if he teaches more then you
will raise his/her salary unless you can actually follow through and do it.7
The Chair that I just described is now the Dean at another large university.
What many Chairs do—and this is just the Realpolitik of faculty life—is
that they have a committee of say ﬁve faculty who adjudicate the faculty
raises. In the year in which those ﬁve serve, they of course have nothing to
say about their own raises. This committee evaluates all the Good Works
Forms, discusses the diﬀerent individuals and their merits, and makes rec-
ommendations.
In some departments the recommendation will be rather
streamlined: each individual will be put into one of three groups—say Mer-
itorious, Good, and Fair. The Chair and the Dean then use these rankings
to dole out the raises.
Chairs and Deans like the system of a salary committee because it creates
7At some state schools now it is mandated by the Legislature that there be a system for
regular evaluation of faculty quality and development. The Deans enforced this legislative
mandate by telling the Departments Chairs that they should set up such a system or else
there will be no raises. Period.

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
171
a fairly objective buﬀer in the raise situation. If a faculty member comes to
the Chair to complain, the response can be, “Well, the committee looked over
your credentials and this is what they recommended. You have to remember
that there are 45 hard-working faculty in this department and only so much
money to go around. This is the best we can do for you this year.” This is
not likely to send the complainant away happy, but it is a reasonably honest
answer to the query.
As you dole out raises, a good rule of thumb to follow is to give everyone
at least something. A 0% raise is a real slap in the face.8 As long as the
person teaches his/her classes and does not cause trouble, he/she probably
deserves a 1% increase. That may take a away a bit from someone else who
is eminently deserving, but it is probably best for the overall Gem¨utlichkeit
of the Department.
The Chair also is, in principle, in charge of staﬀraises. Typically, at
least in a big department, you will have a head secretary and you might
ask him/her to recommend raises for each of the staﬀmembers. It is, after
all, important for the head staﬀperson to feel empowered, and he/she will
probably have more detailed knowledge of each person’s contributions than
you do. You, the Chair, will handle the raise for the head secretary.
6.7.2
Promotion and Tenure
This is another big, big part of the Chair’s duties. The decision of whether
to give a young mathematician tenure is a life-changing one. Granting tenure
sets the person on one career path; denying tenure charts quite a diﬀerent
course. It happens occasionally that an individual who is denied tenure can
get the decision reversed. But that is really the exception rather than the
rule. Generally speaking, if the decision is negative then that is the end of
the line.
The tenure process has several steps, and they will vary from institution
to institution. But they are roughly as follows:
1. The Chair forms a committee to put together the tenure case for an
8When I taught at Penn State we had one particularly intransigent faculty member who
hated his undergraduate teaching duties. He once loused up one of his classes so badly
that the Chair had to pull him (and replace him with me!—and I was supposed to be on
leave at the time). Of course for this particular faculty member the Chair’s action was
not a punishment. It was a blessing. For now he did not have to teach. His punishment
was that he got 0% raises for a period of several years.

172
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
individual.
This includes (i) writing for outside letters to evaluate
the research, (ii) collecting information about the individual’s teach-
ing, (iii) giving a report on the person’s departmental and university
service. I shall say more about some of these components below.
2. After having collected all the relevant information, the committee re-
ports ﬁrst to the Chair and then to the Department about the quality of
the case. Typically the committee makes a recommendation for tenure
or not. At many institutions, the Chair has the power to veto a tenure
case before it is passed on to the next level. This is a very important,
but rarely exercised, feature. Many times a Department will vote to
give an individual tenure because people like him/her, they feel that the
person makes worthwhile contributions to the department, and his/her
mathematics looks pretty good. But an experienced Chair can look at
the dossier and see that it is ﬂawed. Either there are not enough pa-
pers, or they do not appear in suﬃciently distinguished journals, or the
teaching is uneven, or the outside letters are erratic or inconclusive.9
The Chair knows that the Dean and his/her committee will take a hard,
objective look at this dossier and ﬁnd many ﬂaws in it. It weakens the
Department, and it weakens the Chair, to send on a tenure case that
is inadequate and that will not ﬂy. This is a juncture when the Chair
must consider exercising his/her veto power. It is a tough decision, but
one that sometimes must be made.
In any event, once the tenure dossier is complete, the Department will
have a meeting about the tenure case. Someone (probably a member
of the tenure committee for this case) will make a presentation to the
faculty about the merits of the case. Any weaknesses will be noted
at that time. Often a vigorous discussion ensues. Some department
members go out of their way to see the good features in any case;
others will be considerably more critical. Everyone wants to maintain
standards in the Department, and to tenure only those who will improve
the overall quality of life.
In the end—one hopes—there will be a
9It is essential that each letter say point blank that the candidate deserves tenure.
Each letter should make binary comparisons with mathematicians in the same ﬁeld at a
comparable level. Each letter should speak in detail about the mathematical work. The
book [KRA2] discusses in detail the art of writing a good letter of recommendation. See
also Section 5.4.

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
173
consensus either to tenure the candidate or not.10 Generally speaking,
the vote is by secret ballot.
3. If the Department approves the tenure case, then it is passed on to the
Dean. The Dean will want to know the vote count, and he/she may
demand to know exactly how each individual faculty member voted.
Typically the Dean will have a committee, consisting of faculty from
across campus, that will study a tenure case very carefully, discuss
it, and make a judgment. Usually the Department Chair will make a
presentation to this committee, and will be expected to answer some
rather pointed questions. Then the Dean’s committee takes a vote.
The committee’s vote is a recommendation to the Dean; he/she may
accept it or not. In the end, the Dean makes a decision about tenure
and passes it on to the next level.
4. Most colleges and universities have a Provost. He/she sits above all the
Deans. Whereas certainly the Department, and probably the Dean,
will look at all aspects of a tenure case—especially the research—the
Provost takes a broader view. He/she will probably feel that the re-
search has been adequately vetted when a case reaches the Provost’s
level. So the Provost will want to know whether this candidate is a
good teacher, whether he/she is a good departmental citizen, whether
he/she will contribute to the overall welfare of the University. If in fact
this person’s tenure is approved then he/she is liable to be around for
forty years and will cost the institution $5 million in salary and bene-
ﬁts. Is this a good bet? The Provost too will have a committee to help
in the decision.
5. Finally the Chancellor and the Board of Trustees must pass on each
tenure case. One might think that this is just a rubber stamp. After all,
the Trustees are mostly business people and other public ﬁgures. What
do they know about academics? They cannot judge the scholarly work
of an Assistant Professor. They also do not know much about teaching.
So we might think that they would accept the recommendations of the
Dean and the Provost.
For the most part they do.
But there are
10Diﬀerent departments have diﬀerent rules in this matter. I can tell you straight out
that if the vote is close then the Dean will not be very happy. He/she wants a strong
majority in favor of tenure. Some departments require a unanimous vote. At my own
University, the Chair is required to explain each negative vote to the Dean.

174
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
exceptions. At my own institution we had a tenure candidate who was
a ﬁne biologist, a good teacher, and was well liked by his colleagues
and his students. But he was a Communist. Really. He had cut sugar
cane with Fidel Castro. The Trustees had a problem with this. The
Chancellor and the Board of Trustees had a real standoﬀover this one.
In the end the Chancellor prevailed and the candidate got tenure. But
this was a situation in which the Trustees really had their say.
There are many legalities associated with tenure cases, and the best advice
I can give you is to be very careful. The institution will indemnify you, so
that you are protected if you are sued for turning someone down for tenure.
That is, as long as you were not negligent or incompetent. You would be wise
to familiarize yourself with the school’s tenure procedures and rules. Have
a session with the Dean or another appropriate administrator to learn how
it is done. Consult a previous Chair to learn the basic steps. Study tenure
dossiers from recent cases—both successful ones and unsuccessful ones.
Promotions to full Professor are handled quite similarly to tenure cases.
All of the basic steps outlined above are still relevant. Some of the emphases
will be diﬀerent. A candidate for full Professor will be expected to have a
more mature and well-developed research program. He/she will be expected
to have done more University-wide service. He/she will be expected to have
a more extensive and bountiful teaching dossier.
One essential feature of both a tenure dossier and a promotion dossier is
the Chair’s cover letter. This is a letter of ﬁve pages or so presenting the
case to the Dean and his/her committee (and to the administrators and the
committees above the Dean). This is really the document that delineates the
case to the world, and it should be prepared with exceptional care. In writing
this letter, you must assess all the outside letters, evaluate the teaching,
and get a line on the service and other departmental contributions. You
must craft an incisive, compelling, cogent presentation of all the candidate’s
qualities. Don’t make the letter too long (more than seven pages) or too
short (fewer than four pages). You should say just what needs to be said,
and not more. Our Dean laments of English and Philosophy Chairs who
write 18-page cover letters for tenure cases. That is not useful. Nobody has
the time or patience to read such a diatribe
Be honest in this cover letter.
If there are ﬂaws that will be evident
to anyone reading the case, then you should endeavor to address them in
the letter. If there are particular strengths, then bring them out. The best

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
175
possible letter will answer any questions that may come up in a reader’s mind
as he/she evaluates the evidence. The Chair’s cover letter can make or break
a tenure or promotion case. So it should represent your best eﬀort. After
you draft it, show it to your Executive Committee or some of your trusted
colleagues. Revise it and hone it and make it the sharp tool that it should
be.
Part of the process that we have been describing is that Assistant Profes-
sors need regular assessment of their progress before they get to the tenure
decision. Certainly there should be a 3-year review—about halfway to the
tenure mark—to tell the junior faculty member how he/she is doing. This
should be like a mini-tenure-review. You should write out for about two
outside letters, have a hard look at the teaching, and examine the service
component. After all the information is in, after you and your Executive
Committee have evaluated it, then you must sit down with the Assistant
Professor and assess the case honestly with him/her. Engage the candidate
in discussion, and make sure that he/she really understands what is being
said. It is all too easy for the young Assisant Professor to say, “Uh huh, uh
hun.” and not really listen to anything that you are telling him/her. This is
one time when you had better be sure that they get the message. If necessary
have the person’s senior mentor chat with him/her as well.
In very rare instances you will say to this junior faculty member, “Bob,
this really isn’t working out. You should look for another line of work. We
shall renew your contract for one more year and then you will be terminated.”
I know of very few cases where this has actually transpired. What is more
typical is that the Chair will say, “George, your dossier is mostly strong. But
there are a couple of items that require attention and I thought we should
discuss them.” And you do. The point of the exercise is to bring the Assistant
Professor along, give him/her strength, and make it more likely that he/she
will achieve tenure a few years down the line.
Many departments actually have yearly reviews of the junior faculty.
These are much smaller in scale than the 3-year review. There will be no
outside letters for the annual review, as you don’t want to pester and/or
waste the time of these famous people. The yearly review would consist of
a committee of two senior faculty looking over the CV and the research and
teaching achievements and the service component of this individual’s track
record and then writing a one-page report summarizing their observations.
Again, the Chair should sit down with the candidate and go over the good
and the bad points. Make sure that the candidate understands what you are

176
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
saying. Chat him/her up every few months and determine whether he/she
is implementing what you taught him/her—whether progress is being made.
At my own university, there was a tenure case in the History Department
in which the candidate’s research credentials depended on her pioneering
work in “history on the Web.” This was a tough case for all concerned. In
the end the department put her up for tenure; they thought she had built a
substantial body of scholarly inquiry that constituted a serious contribution
to the literature of their subject.
The Dean did not agree.
Deans, and
especially the Dean’s committee, tend to be rather narrowly focused and
traditional. They have very rigid and hidebound ideas of how one establishes
a research reputation, and how one checks and veriﬁes research credentials.
To come to the point, they are looking for a body of work published in
established journals, ones that are carefully peer-reviewed and that have
a track record of publishing excellent work. They expect the candidate’s
research agenda to follow a traditional path, using sources that also appeared
in well-established and recognized journals. Doing research on the Web is
unfamiliar, its standards are not well established, and there is little track
record. Publishing on the Web is even more problematic, because nobody is
quite sure how papers are vetted, what is the ﬁltering process, and what are
the standards of the OnLine journals.
I have published a good deal, and my reputation is well established. I
might choose to publish in an OnLine journal just to show my support for
the enterprise, or because I want to get my ideas out there quickly and to
a broad audience. But a junior candidate for tenure has to face the matter
more analytically. He/she should become familiar with how things are done
at the particular university at which they are facing tenure. Some schools will
be anxious to branch out into new lines of inquiry, new forms of publishing,
new styles of scholarship. The more established institutions probably will
not.
6.7.3
Hiring
As indicated elsewhere, academics take comfort (and empowerment) from the
fact that they each play a signiﬁcant role in the oversight and management
and planning for the Department. This is a piece of the world over which
they have some control. One of the biggest ways in which a faculty member
exercises that control is through participating in the hiring process. When the
Dean gives the Department a position, it is like free money. The Department

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
177
can go out and hire anyone it pleases (assuming, that is, that the position has
no strings attached), just so long as the necessary salary and other perks can
be assembled and the candidate can be convinced to come. So, unlike many
other humdrum Departmental activities, hiring is one in which everyone will
participate, everyone will have an opinion, everyone will have a pet candidate.
It is exciting, envigorating, and even fun. It really will impact the future life
of the department, as any new person will be someone whom you will interact
with on a daily basis.
In some ways hiring is one of the most glamorous parts of your job as
Chair. Ten years after you cease being Chair, people will remember your
successes (or lack thereof) in hiring. Because of course new hires have a
long-term, daily eﬀect on Departmental life. They can increase the proﬁle of
the Department, they can add prestige to the Department, they can attract
other strong people, they can pump up the teaching, and have a number of
unanticipated eﬀects as well. The only other activity of the Chair that is
quite so signiﬁcant is the handling of tenure cases. And for just the same
reasons.
Of course the entire hiring process is overseen by the Chair. Candidates
will be brought in to meet the Department, give a talk, meet the Dean, get
acquainted with the institution, and so forth. Certainly the candidate will
have an interview with the Chair, or perhaps with the Chair’s hiring commit-
tee. Along the way, the Chair will become acquainted with the candidate,
and will ﬁnd out what his/her particular needs are. What salary? What
kind of startup fund? Does he/she have a spouse with special needs? Does
the candidate want to take the ﬁrst year oﬀto spend in Princeton or Paris?
The Chair will ask some pointed questions, and endeavor to determine just
what this particular candidate has to oﬀer. What can he she contribute to
the research program, to the teaching eﬀort, to overall departmental devel-
opment?
After the Chair has assessed the candidate and his/her needs, then it is
necessary to consider the case that must made to the administration. Can
the University and the Department muster the wherewithal to meet all the
candidate’s demands? Will the Dean participate proactively, and help you
make the oﬀer? Will he/she meet the salary needs? The startup needs?11 Or
11Startup funds are easy from a ﬁscal point of view because they are one-oﬀitems—i.e.,
nonrecurring debts. The salary is of course an entitlement, and will certianly give the
Dean pause for thought.

178
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
will he/she be an albatross around your neck, making it a foregone conclusion
that you lose the person you really want and instead will hire someone well
below the standards that you have set for the department?
Usually one point of contention is salary. Deans like to advertise jobs at
the beginning Assistant Professor level. This is partly because such a job
represents a minimal commitment (no tenure) and also a minimal salary.
Often the candidate you come up with will be at a more advanced level.
If the candidate is actually a somewhat more advanced Assistant Professor,
then the Dean will probably not give you a very hard time about it. But if
the candidate is a tenured Full Professor then you will have a ﬁght on your
hands. This is not at all what the Dean had in mind. You must make a
case that this is the chance-of-a-lifetime for the Department. That the entire
nature of the enterprise will change—and deﬁnitely for the better—if you
can hire this very special person. If you can make a case that Princeton and
Harvard also want to make this scholar an oﬀer, it will really strengthen your
case. Of course such a candidate is liable to want a princely salary, and that
will give you problems with the Dean as well. You must argue that if your
institution is going to be competitive in the marketplace then it must pay
competitive salaries. And oﬀer competitive perks. You as Chair will have to
learn a whole new vocabulary for selling candidates to the Dean.
You may want to give some thought to what hoops you want a visiting job
candidate to jump through. Of course he/she will meet the hiring committee,
and probably the rest of the faculty as well. If the job is a tenured position,
then the candidate will certainly meet the Dean.
It is standard for the
candidate to give a ceremonial talk and then be taken to dinner. At my own
institution—at least for a time—we required every job candidate to give a
calculus lecture in front of a group of calculus students. This may have been
a good idea in theory, but it really irritated the heck out of our job candidates
and it did not seem to be an eﬀective use of anyone’s time.
I have, as a job candidate, been asked to meet with a teaching committee
and to discuss current teaching issues (calculus reform, self-discovery learn-
ing, computer-aided learning, and so forth). I have been asked to go drink
beer with the other analysts (this was not too taxing). I have been asked to
go on a hike in the woods. I happily complied.
It is just a fact that emotions can run high at hiring time. People feel that
the future of the Department, the quality of life, the ranking of the program,
depend critically on each hiring decision. Especially these days when money
is tight and there is not nearly as much hiring as there was forty years ago,

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
179
each new position is perceived as something precious and irreplaceable. Each
faculty member will not only defend his/her own candidate vigorously, but
may also attack your candidate. In many instances you will ﬁnd yourself
comparing apples with oranges, and it will be diﬃcult to see objectively
which candidate is truly “best” for the Department or the University.
The message here is that this is one context in which your people-manage-
ment skills will play a central role. You will have to supervise some big egos
and some hurt feelings and some lousy behavior. You will have faculty stand
up at meetings and say in eﬀect, “I am clearly much better than you and I
should be listened to and you should not.” It is your job then to point out
the merits of all sides of the argument, to make sure that everyone is heard,
to guarantee that all candidates get a fair hearing.
Looking back on my own time as Chair, I feel that some of my biggest
and most lasting accomplishments are my successful hires—new people who
came and stayed with us and have had a powerful and positive eﬀect on
departmental life. If you do things right, then you will be able to take some
of the same satisfaction in these activities.
One of the somewhat aggravating mechanical aspects of dealing with a
hiring situation is making peace with the University’s Aﬃrmative Action
Committee. The purpose of this government-mandated committee is to see
that hiring is evenhanded and above board, to ensure that members of under-
represented societal groups get a fair shot at any job that is oﬀered.12 This
means that you must prepare an Aﬃrmative Action dossier for each job
that you advertise.
You must provide statistics that show the nature of
your search, and what steps you have taken to make your process fair and
inclusive. This can create a great deal of extra work for your staﬀ(spe-
cial spreadsheets, extra data accumulated on each candidate, special ads in
particular periodicals), and a dose of additional frustration. But you must
take this exercise seriously. I know of job searches on which the Dean has
pulled the plug—and this was very late in the game, when the Department
had a candidate to which it really wanted to make the oﬀer—because it was
perceived that Aﬃrmative Action was not handled correctly.
It has been true for a long time that a new faculty member in Physics
and Chemistry and Biology and other lab sciences will have a startup fund.
12The intention here is to ﬁght the “old boy network”. As an instance of that network in
action, I got my ﬁrst job—a very good Assistant Professorship—with one phone call from
my advisor. No letters, no teaching evaluations, no nothing. Just a phone call. Today
this would be considered wrong.

180
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
This is because such a scholar will likely have a lab, and it takes a good deal
of money to set up a new lab from scratch. The candidate will no doubt get
grants to keep the lab going from year to year, but the initial conﬁguration
of the lab—that is, the startup—will require a preliminary infusion of funds.
This could really be quite a lot—half a million dollars or more. If there is
specialized equipment, it could be a couple of million dollars. And Deans are
accustomed to this. Especially if the Dean is a chemist, he/she will know
what a mass spectrometer costs and will be prepared with the old checkbook.
The idea of a startup fund for a mathematician is relatively new. Most
of us don’t have labs. What we do have are computing needs, needs to travel
to meet with a collaborator, needs to bring in visitors, needs connected with
getting your Ph.D. students set up. So it is common now for the Math Chair
to ask the Dean for a startup fund for a job candidate. The sad fact of the
matter is that the Dean is somewhat less sympathetic to this request than
one might hope. First of all, Deans like to save money. Second, the Dean just
doesn’t understand our needs as well as he/she would understand the needs
of a lab scientist. Many times the Chair can pry $20,000 out of the Dean for
a startup fund for an “ordinary” faculty member, and perhaps $50,000 for a
“superstar” faculty member. Other times not, and you as Chair will have to
scrape something out of the (already quite limited) departmental budget.
It is also common to oﬀer a reduced teaching load to a new faculty mem-
ber. This is just one more perk that you can throw the candidate’s way to
make the job oﬀer more attractive. If you are lucky, the Dean will support
you in this eﬀort. More likely, however, you will have to do this “under the
table” by shuﬄing everyone’s teaching assignment around a bit.
Finally—and this is a big issue these days—there is the so-called two-
body problem. Many a job candidate will have a spouse or signiﬁcant other
who also has a career and therefore has professional needs. Sometimes that
signﬁcant other will be a mathematician, and you will ﬁnd yourself looking
at two hires instead of one. [Many Deans are anxious to pay lip service to
their commitment to solving two-body problems. But when push comes to
shove—when the Dean may have to produce another position out of thin air—
then you may ﬁnd that he/she sings a diﬀerent tune.] Section 3.9 discusses
two-body problems.

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
181
6.7.4
General Departmental Management
On a day-to-day basis, the Chair must face a variety of tasks. These in-
clude oversight of the budget, managing the staﬀ(and refereeing internicene
squabbles), requisitioning supplies, writing reports for the Dean, engaging in
a variety of planning activities, supervising the teaching and research, and
many other jobs that come up as needed.
Many Chairs ﬁnd it useful to have an Executive Committee (and in fact
many Departmental Bylaws mandate that the Chair have one). This is a
group of about ﬁve senior faculty with whom the Chair meets regularly to
hash out decisions and set the course for the Department.
The Executive Committee can be a useful tool for a canny Chair:
• First, it is always useful to have trusted colleagues oﬀof whom to
bounce your ideas, to oﬀer advice, and to provide other perspectives.
• Second, there will be times when you just don’t know what to do. A
particular situation has you completely ﬂummoxed. A good Executive
Committee can help you wade throught the complexities and to see
what is really going on.
• Third, the Executive Committee can serve as a buﬀer. If someone—a
colleague or an administrator or a student—comes to you complaining
of some decision, you can say, “The Executive Committee considered
the matter and here is what they decided and why.” That takes some
of the burden oﬀof you, and spreads the responsibility around in a
plausible manner.
• Used with restraint, the members of the Executive Committee are peo-
ple whom you can ask to help out with key tasks. You can’t ask them
to do large tasks on the spur of the moment. But if you need a little
legwork done, or some key information, then they often can help.
Typically the Executive Committee is elected by the Department. But
some slots on the Committee may be appointed—by the Dean, or by the
Chair him/herself. Usually a new Executive Committee is appointed each
academic year. You will generally ﬁnd the Executive Committee to be a
useful and constructive ally which will make your job a bit easier.
In a reasonably good-sized department there will be a secretary dedicated
to undergraduate aﬀairs (and who works closely with the Vice-Chair of Un-
dergraduate Studies) and another secretary dedicated to graduate student

182
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
aﬀairs (and who will work closely with the Vice-Chair of Graduate Studies).
These people are your allies, and frankly will know more about the details
of their respective purviews than do the cognate Vice-Chairs. You should
consult with these folks regularly just to keep the pulse of the program and
to be sure that the curriculum is functioning as it should.
Also check regularly with your computer people to see that the system is
running properly, that there are no crises in the oﬃng, that the equipment
needs are being met. No reasonable Dean is going to leave a Department
without e-mail or without adequate computer support. If you plan ahead,
then you can often get the Dean to help you when there is a “sudden” need
for a RAID system or a laser printer or a multi-bus server.
Finally, keep in touch with your Departmental Librarian. As discussed
in Subsection 6.7.24, the library is the intellectual heart of the Department.
Today, with electronic media, the library is becoming more and more dis-
tributed. But this probably means that the managing issues (and the costs!)
are more complex. So you want to be well informed in the matter.
6.7.5
The Reward System
Several years ago the AMS actually had a taskforce—supported ﬁnancially
by a big grant—to study the reward system in the profession. The question
was: Are mathematicians fairly rewarded for their eﬀorts? Do all the big
raises and all the perks and all the promotions go to those who prove the big
theorems? What about eﬀorts for the curriculum? What about departmental
and university service? What about extraordinary teaching performance?
How about service to the profession?
The AMS Taskforce visited a great many departments and interviewed
Department Chairs, Deans, and rank-and-ﬁle mathematicians to get a sense
of what was in the air. Certainly the general feeling among the rank-and-
ﬁle was that the reward system was not equitable. You can imagine that,
in today’s American Math Department, most of the denizens are in their
forties or older. Likely as not their best theorem-proving days are behind
them. But they still want to be rewarded. They still have families, and
kids to put through college, and other tangible needs. So they want raises
and other creature comforts. They feel that they are still making valuable
contributions to the Departmental weal, but not getting a fair amount of
recognition. Chairs and Deans acknowledged that there was a problem here,
but were cautious in saying too much about it. The Taskforce recommended

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
183
that departments re-think the system, but not much came of it.
The fact is that recognition of the American mathematical research en-
terprise is rather recent. It dates back to G. D. Birkhoﬀand Norbert Wiener,
so is not even 100 years old. And we are proud of it; not likely to turn our
collective backs on it any time soon. It is also a fact that the way you get
tenure, and the way you get promoted to full Professor, is to publish. Even
at a school where the primary mission is to teach, the powers that be expect
each candidate to have a scholarly proﬁle—which means that you have to
create some new mathematics. So research has a high proﬁle in American
mathematics. Research gets rewarded.
I would say that in recent years the teaching reform movement (see
[KRA1] and the references therein for some details on this phenomenon)
and the copious Federal funding that it has received have somewhat changed
our view of matters. People now recognize that the Harvard Reform Project,
the Duke Reform Project, and many others are worthwhile enterprises that
have had a positive eﬀect. And, at least in principle, they acknowledge that
these should be suitably rewarded.
But I can tell you that even very recently, in my own department, a
seasoned veteran who is quite sympathetic to the importance of teaching
and departmental service was quoted as saying, “I just got a paper in the
Annals and you are going to give a big raise to these guys who do a good job
teaching calculus? Where’s my piece of the pie?”
The fact is that there is only so much money to go around, and if you give
more to one person then you are going to give less to someone else. You, as
Chair, would be making a strong statement—and the wrong statement—not
to recognize a paper in one of the top journals. But if we are going to be
objective then we ought to recognize that most mathematicians spend ten to
ﬁfteen years doing frontline research (if they are lucky) and much of the rest
of their careers doing other things. So we should be prepared to recognize,
and to reward, those other things.
The Carnegie Foundation has played a proactive role in helping people
to understand the many diﬀerent contributions that college and university
faculty make, and the diﬀerent ways that these activities can be assessed
and reward.
In particular, the book [GTM] (sponsored by the Carnegie
Foundation) lays out their key ideas.
You will have to work with your Dean to ﬁnd a fair way to carry out the
programs that I have brieﬂy described here. After all, it is he who allocates
the resources and approves the raises.

184
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
6.7.6
When One of Your People Wins a Prize
If one of your faculty wins a prize, then it’s time to celebrate. Certainly
knock on the individual’s door and oﬀer hearty congratulations. And don’t
leave it at that. Ask about the prize, for what work it was given, and how it
came about. Really make a do over it.
Organize a Departmental tea so that the entire Mathematical family can
celebrate the event. Make a little speech. Perhaps get some senior faculty
member in the honoree’s ﬁeld of expertise to make some remarks as well.
Jack Welch was the very successful CEO of General Electric for twenty
years, and is considered to have been one of the most successful and inno-
vative managers in history. He advises to ﬁnd any excuse to celebrate with
your people. Make them feel important and special. Hold a ceremony and
make a fuss.
The advice that I am giving here is perhaps even more important if one
of your staﬀwins a prize. Most universities have a variety of awards for
staﬀ.
These are nothing like the Fields Medal or the Bˆocher Prize. But
staﬀget little enough recognition and appreciation.
So this approbation
will be important for the recipient. Now is the time to really put on the dog:
show this person how much he/she is appreciated as part of the Mathematics
Department family.
6.7.7
Relations with Other Departments
Some departments—Earth and Planetary Science (EPS) is a good example—
interact naturally with many other units on campus. People in EPS naturally
have to talk to Physicists and Astronomers and Chemists and perhaps even
Engineers. Mathematicians—pure mathematicians—do not. Traditionally a
pure mathematician does not collaborate with people in other departments.
In fact it is only a fairly recent development—in the past thirty years or
so—that a pure mathematician will even collaborate with people in his/her
own department.
That is our culture, and there is nothing wrong with it. But we pay a
price. Deans value interdisciplinary programs and interdisciplinary curricula.
This is in part because such activities advertise well: When Mr. and Mrs.
Jones come to campus with their beloved oﬀspring to determine whether
this is where Mary should spend her formative years, they are impressed
by cross-disciplinary Science & Technology Programs, by joint Medicine and

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
185
Engineering majors, and by biotech labs and supercomputer centers. It is
also the case that interdisciplinary programs tend to attract funding—if only
because there are more sources that they can turn to. Such enterprises tend
to leave most mathematicians in the dust, and frankly don’t interest us much
in the ﬁrst place.
But, to repeat a shopworn phrase, we pay a price for this isolation. If the
Dean perceives that we are not team players, that we are not getting with
the current ﬂow of instructional development, then he/she is not going to be
sympathetic when the Chair comes to him for more funds, or more positions,
or more graduate assistantships, or more resources of some other kind.
In my travels around the country, I have noted that today Mathematics
Departments are making a concerted eﬀort to correct the image that I have
just described. Everyone is aware that, about twelve years ago, the Dean
at the University of Rochester shut down the graduate program in their
Mathematics Department. This was in large part because of his perception
that the Math Department was isolated, was not making a viable contribution
to the teaching eﬀort, and overall wasn’t carrying its weight. With the aid of
the American Mathematical Society, the situation at Rochester was ﬁnally
rectiﬁed. But a dire knell was sent out to the Mathematics community: This
could happen to you. In my own negotiations with our Dean at Washington
University (when I was Chair), the Dean actually brought up the Rochester
situation. And he did not do so in an eﬀort to be friendly. He was threatening
me and my Department.
As indicated elsewhere in this book, it’s generally a bad idea for the
Math Department to be an isolated entity on campus. We do a tremendous
amount of lower division teaching and other campus-wide service. So it is
rather natural for us to be involved in campus life. And we should be.
When I was Department Chair, we had a consortium of Science Chairs
that met every month or two to discuss matters of mutual interest. Some of
the topics that we considered at length are
• Asking the Dean to set up an oﬃce to manage Undergraduate Research
projects (these are often funded by grants, and there is a considerable
amount of infrastructure and paperwork).
• Asking the Dean to be more supportive of our graduate programs.
• Asking the Dean to set up a high-speed Internet system for the Sciences.

186
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
• Asking the Dean to provide supercomputing resources.
• Asking the Dean to make more of the income from the endowment
available to the Departments.
Obviously there is strength in numbers. If just one Department Chair
goes to the Dean and asks for a high-speed Internet hookup, then it is just
too easy for the Dean to brush oﬀ. But if all the Science Chairs go to him/her
as a group, then that is bound to garner some attention.
In addition, it is fun and collegial to interact with leaders from other
Departments. This is your opportunity to learn how other Departments deal
with some of the same issues—personnel problems, promotions, money for
travel, computing resources—that you must deal with. You will ﬁnd that
even nearby ﬁelds like Physics have quite diﬀerent values, and quite diﬀerent
goals, from the ones that we are familiar with. And you will learn from
discussing them.
I was once in a conversation with other Department Chairs and the Chair
of Psychology (Psychology was included with the Sciences because it was a
very analytical department) said that he thought that the best place for
a budding Psychology Professor to go to college was a small Liberal Arts
College.
I was a bit surprised.
I think that small Liberal Arts Colleges
are great—certainly one of the unique strengths of the American education
system—but they have certain limitations in mathematics education. A re-
ally bright student who races through the undergraduate curriculum in two
years will want to start going to seminars and taking graduate courses. A
Liberal Arts College may only have limited choices to oﬀer in this regard. If
the Liberal Arts College happens to be in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then
the student can go down the block to Harvard for some enrichment. If in-
stead the Liberal Arts College is in Portland, Oregon then the choices may
be fewer.
It turns out that the reason that the Psychology Chair made his assertion
is that (in his view) a student at a small Liberal Arts college will have lots of
opportunities to get involved in a Professor’s Lab and thereby have hands-
on research experience. Well, this had never occurred to me.
It doesn’t
necessarily make sense for mathematics. But it certainly gave me food for
thought.

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
187
6.7.8
Vice-Chairs
If you have a department of reasonable size then it makes sense to have
certain people appointed as Vice-Chairs in charge of certain particular activ-
ities. Many Departments have a Vice-Chair of Undergraduate Studies and a
Vice-Chair of Graduate Studies. There can also be an Administrative Vice-
Chair. Each of these people is a Professor, and usually each of these people
is handpicked and appointed by the Chair. These folks can lift a consid-
erable administrative burden oﬀthe Chair’s shoulders, and can help insure
that critical parts of the Departmental mission are executed smoothly. The
Administrative Vice-Chair can carry a lot of the weight in preparing tenure
cases, hiring cases, and so forth.
It makes sense to give your Vice-Chairs certain perks as a reward for
their services. This could include a salary boost, or time oﬀfrom teaching,
or perhaps a new computer or a travel fund. What is feasible, and what you
can actually manage, will depend on what resources your Department has at
its disposal. In some (unfortunately rare) instances the Dean will actually
help you in this matter. In most cases, you are going to have to scrimp and
do some creative bookkeeping.
Your Vice-Chairs are also people whom you can consult—much like the
Executive Committee—about Departmental issues, about matters of policy,
about hiring and promotion and so forth.
These should be among your
trusted advisors, people you can rely on and who will support you when
times get tough. Your relationship with the Vice-Chairs is a symbiotic one,
and you can derive much from having these allies.
6.7.9
Committees
If you are a reasonably well organized Department Chair who has an agenda
and seems to know what he/she is doing, then there is a temptation to do
everything yourself. After all, you know much better than anyone else in the
Department what is going on on campus, what the Dean is thinking, what
resources are available, and what the institution’s goals are. Why waste your
time explaining any of this to your colleagues? They will only muddy things
up with their uninformed and puerile questions.
This is an easy attitude to fall into, but it is not the right one. Academics
have a very powerful sense of self-determination. They want to think that
they control the future of the department. On any issue that has any weight,

188
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
they want to be heard.
And that is the key point. In the end, the buck stops with you (the Chair).
But everyone wants to have a voice in the Department’s future. That is why
you need to have committees and you need to have regular faculty meetings.
Certainly any decision that will aﬀect the whole department should be made
by a committee. After all, a tenure or promotion decision aﬀects the whole
department indirectly. And, anyway, it is important. It is good to have more
heads in on the job.
It is natural to want to put your buddies on all the committees, but you
really need to spread the responsibility around.
And be sure that junior
faculty also have adequate representation on the committees. Junior faculty
can easily convince themselves that they are disenfranchised, and will thereby
become disaﬀected. That is not good for anyone. Try to be inclusive in
everything that you do.
6.7.10
Graduate Students
As you ponder the great panorama of your life as Chair, you will see cer-
tain milestones. Among these may be hiring, tenure cases, promotions, and
faculty raises. Perhaps the graduate students loom somewhat smaller in the
great scheme of things.
But in fact the Graduate Program is an essential part of any research
Mathematics Department. Graduate education is important, and it requires
a good many resources. It is signiﬁcant that the University funds it, and it
does so for a reason.13
Training the next generation of scholars is a critical part of what we do.
In addition, working with graduate students is really good for your scholarly
work. It helps to keep you alive and vigorous.
So it is important to be sure that the graduate students are well-treated,
and that they know they are well-treated. Do your utmost to be sure that
the graduate student stipends are at a competitive level. Work with the
Vice-Chair for Graduate Studies to be sure that everything possible is done
to attract the very best graduate students.
13Running a graduate program is very expensive. Many countries simply cannot aﬀord
to oﬀer graduate education. Prior to 20 years ago, there were no Ph.D. programs in Italy,
for example. The great diversity of graduate programs in the United States is one of the
things that makes us special.

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
189
Some departments will actually ﬂy in a group of prospective Graduate
Students each Spring and do a hard sell to convince them to come. This may
include a dog-and-pony show of various faculty presentations, social time
spent with contented graduate students who are already in the program, and
time spent getting acquainted with the institution and the city. As Chair,
you can make sure that things like this happen and you can participate to
good eﬀect.
The graduate students should know that they can bring you their concerns
and they will be met with an open mind and a proactive attitude. You want
the graduate students to feel that they can depend on you.
Most of us are aware that, at some schools, the graduate students (at
least the Teaching Assistants) are unionized. This phenomenon seems to oc-
cur primarily in the public universities. But when the graduate students at
New York University (a private school) unionized, the other private schools
took notice. My institution—Washington University in St. Louis (which is
intensely private) took great pains to get together with graduate student
leaders, take the temperature of the situation, see what their concerns were.
I myself was quite pleased to learn that the graduate students reported that
they were very happy, they felt they were treated well, and especially impor-
tant to them was that people in power listened to their concerns and acted
accordingly. I was proud of my institution. You, of course, want to be proud
of yours too. So look after your graduate students.
6.7.11
The Graduate Vice-Chair
As indicated elsewhere, you as Head will ask one of your colleagues—probably
a senior faculty member—to direct the Graduate Program. This is an im-
portant position, and entails a fair amount of (episodic) work. The Grad-
uate Vice-Chair oversees the admissions process for new graduate students.
He/she also supervises the graduate students who are actually in the pro-
gram. This means that he/she makes sure that the students get through
their qualifying exams in good order, get hooked up with a thesis advisor,
and make good progress towards the degree. He/she makes sure that the
graduate students dispatch their duties (teaching and so forth) in a profes-
sional and competent manner. And the Graduate Vice-Chair oversees the
payment of Graduate Student stipends.
If your Department puts on a yearly extravaganza for students who have
been admitted to the graduate program—in an eﬀort to get them to accept

190
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
your oﬀer—then the Graduate Vice-Chair will probably organize that eﬀort.
Of course his/her secretary will help.
This is a lot of stuﬀ. It’s a big job. Of course he/she will be assisted by
a Graduate Secretary and a Graduate Committee. But the ball is carried
by the Vice-Chair. These days the Vice-Chair also has to think about good
strategies for recruiting top students to the program. This can include ad-
vertising and also asking faculty who are on travel to put in plugs for the
program. The Vice-Chair should do his/her best to see that the graduate
program oﬀers competitive stipends. These days there is stiﬀcompetition for
the best students—especially native American students. Some departments,
even the top ones, oﬀer signing bonuses to new graduate students (on top of
a quite generous stipend and a lowered teaching load). The new GAANN
grants (Section 4.10) have set a new standard for graduate student stipends,
at least for American citizens.
6.7.12
Undergraduate Math Majors
You should look after your undergraduate majors for many of the same rea-
sons that you should look after your graduate students. But there is an even
more fundamental reason to do so. Deans pay careful attention to which
departments and programs have the majors and which ones don’t. If your
Department has a signiﬁcant number of majors (say in the top ten or so
departments), then you will really have the Dean’s attention.
When I was at Penn State we developed some fairly ﬂashy ways to attract
majors. In those days (the early 1980s), there were more computer science
majors than you could shake a stick at. The Computer Science Department
kept raising the bar, and it was turning away hundreds of students every
year. So the Math Department developed a Computational Math Major.
Well, the number of our majors then skyrocketed!
In a diﬀerent direction, we noticed that there were a lot of students ﬂoat-
ing around who couldn’t decide what to major in. So we designed the “roll
your own” math major, which allowed the student to (with proper guid-
ance) design a custom Math Major to suit his/her goals and needs. This was
another big hit.
With these two devices we increased the number of Math Majors by a
factor of ten. And I can tell you that this was well worth doing. Our proﬁle
with the Dean was transformed overnight.
You may ﬁnd the two examples above—of ploys to attract majors—to be

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
191
a bit too Madison-Avenue-like. Well, ﬁne. Design your own. There are lot of
things to do to attract majors. If word gets out that the Math Department
provides a lot of good counseling, then the number of majors will go up. If
the Department oﬀers a menu of diﬀerent types of majors that the students
ﬁnd appealing, then the number of majors will go up. If the Department has
a vigorous and far-reaching Minor program, then the number of clients will
go up. Have faculty make a pitch to their vector-calculus classes, or their
ODE classes, or their linear algebra classes, about the value of being a math
major. Invite good students to Math Department events. Send out e-mails
to prospective majors.
It is up to you, the Chair, to tend your own vineyard and make things
happen. Of course your Vice-Chair for Undergraduate Studies will help, but
it is you who calls the shots.
6.7.13
The Undergraduate Vice-Chair
As indicated elsewhere, you as Head will ask one of your colleagues—probably
a senior faculty member—to direct the Undergraduate Program. This is an
important position, and entails a fair amount of constant work.
Of course the Undergraduate Vice-Chair looks after the Math Majors,
makes sure their needs are being met, and endeavors to recruit more of them.
He looks after the Majors at graduation time, helps to choose some of them
for awards, probably attends the ceremony.
The Undergraduate Vice-Chair also worries about the Undergraduate
Curriculum (see Subsection 6.7.13). Is it meeting the needs of the students?
Is it contemporary and competitive? How does it stack up against Physics
and Engineering? Does the Math Department’s course requirement and pre-
requisites make it a tough department, an easy department, or somewhere
in between?
The Undergraduate Vice-Chair will have an advisory committee that
helps with many of these tasks.
But there is a good deal of day-to-day
work that is the lot of the Undergraduate Vice-Chair. He/she needs to see
that there is a Web page for each course, that syllabi are posted on the Web,
that all faculty have oﬃce hours and that those hours are posted.
The Undergraduate Vice-Chair may also oversee Undergraduate Advising—
though the Department may have a special oﬃcer for that task. In any event,
it’s part of the curriculum so he/she will certainly be involved.
It is likely, though not always so, that the Undergraduate Vice-Chair will

192
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
ﬁeld student complaints about Math courses or Math instructors. This is not
always a pleasant task, especially if the Department has people who tend to
generate complaints. It can be time-consuming and aggravating to have to
deal with the matter. In some Departments the Chair does it; in others it’s
the Undergraduate Vice-Chair.
From the point of view of the students, and to some degree the Dean, the
Undergraduate Vice-Chair is the “point man” for the Department. He/she
is highly visible, and represents your team’s most important product. So
choose somebody good for the job.
6.7.14
The Curriculum
The curriculum is the aggregate of all the Mathematics courses—and allied
courses in Physics, Computer Science, Engineering, and the like—that are
part of the mathematics education at your institution. Quite frankly, at most
schools the curriculum does not get nearly the attention that it deserves.
Most of us take for granted that we live with a collection of Math courses,
most of these are quite familiar because they are pretty much the same
courses that we took when we were students, and we take turns teaching
them. It is not often that a new course is created, and it is even less common
for an old and moribund course to be taken oﬀthe books.
We probably should, as a regular exercise, review the Math curriculum
and rethink it. After all, the world changes. We are now teaching more and
more non-majors as a service to other departments. The advent of computer
science as a freestanding academic discipline must cause one to re-think the
role of discrete mathematics and algebra. Cryptography is now an important
part of pure mathematics. Statistics is now a much bigger and more robust
subject than ever it was before. Most every Math Department now has a
group of applied mathematicians, and applied mathematics is a part of every
undergraduate curriculum.
It probably doesn’t make any sense to just throw the entire curriculum
out the window and create a new one. Parts of it—real analysis and algebra
and geometry—are just as valuable today as they were 100 years ago. But the
way that the pieces ﬁt together, and the overall shape of the subject, deserve
attention and re-thinking. You as Chair may consider asking the Vice-Chair
for Undergraduate Studies to form a Taskforce to study the matter and make
recommendations.
Comments like these could also be applied to the Graduate Curriculum.

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
193
In the old days we thought of our graduate students as clones of ourselves,
and we trained each of them to be a chip oﬀthe old block. But, in today’s
world, the mathematically trained face a bewildering array of career choices.
Government research centers, private industry, defense think tanks, schools
of many stripes, the ﬁnancial sector, the Genome Project, the Social Secu-
rity Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) all employ Ph.D. mathematicians. It’s ﬁne to teach our graduate
students measure theory and functional analysis and diﬀerential geometry
and ring theory, but perhaps we should oﬀer them more choices. Perhaps we
should make it possible for them to work computer science, or optimization,
or systems science, or mathematical physics into their program.
This circle of ideas does not necessarily entail that we math faculty must
retrain ourselves. It is probably not realistic to expect someone who has been
studying Moufang loops for the past 25 years to suddenly retool him/herself
as an expert in Karmarchar’s algorithm.
But what we do need to do is
to work cooperatively with faculty in other departments who do have the
expertise in these other areas. Certainly a student can have more than one
thesis advisor, and the advisors do not all need to come from the Math
Department. It can enrich us all to have a productive working relationship
with Engineering or Physics or many another department, and it could lead
to new research projects as well.
6.7.15
Getting Along With the Staﬀ
The staﬀ—the secretaries, and the computer support team, and the people
who tend to the undergraduate curriculum—are in many ways the people who
hold the Department together. They don’t win a lot of prizes nor garner a
lot of prestige for the University, but they get the work done. While the
faculty are running oﬀto Paris or Taiwan or Rio de Janiero, giving fancy
talks and drinking sangria, the staﬀare at their desks making sure that the
department runs smoothly and reliably. If you are Chair, then your life will
be made inﬁnitely simpler if you have a reliable and congenial staﬀthat you
can work with and depend on. Conversely, if you cannot get along with your
staﬀthen your life will be hell.
Make an extra eﬀort to be nice to your staﬀ. Of course be friendly and
tell them jokes and laugh at theirs. But take them to lunch, bring them
little gifts. One particularly popular and successful Chair that I know used
to quite regularly bring in a half-gallon of ice cream and ice cream cones and

194
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
then sit around having a treat with his staﬀ. They loved him for it.
Some faculty are downright rude to the staﬀ. Presumably they think they
are so important, or so harried, or so overworked, that they have the right
to yell at those who are less privileged than themselves. This is intolerable,
and as Chair you should not tolerate it. If a faculty member gets out of line
with the staﬀthan take him/her to task for it. One of the most important
attributes of a good leader is to stand up for your people. And they will
respect you for it and appreciate your support.
Treat your staﬀwith respect. Ask their advice, and really listen to it.
Let them do their jobs without micromanaging; show your appreciation—in
some detail—for what they do. Make it clear that you know what they do,
you understand what they do, and you like what they do. Everyone wants
to be valued. They will give as good as they get. And it is your job as Chair
to make sure that the staﬀis supported and appreciated.
One of your jobs as Chair is to hire new staﬀ. This may be the one task
in your panorama of duties that is furthest from your recognized expertise.
Generally speaking, the university will screen applicants for university jobs,
put their dossiers into some kind of standard form, administer typing and
other clerical tests, and then pass relevant folders on to you. My university
also hires an independent company to do various background checking on
candidates. But, in the end, you will have to interview the candidates and
make a choice. It will probably be helpful to have another faculty member
at the interview, and probably the Departmental Administrative Assistant
or Oﬃce Manager (i.e., the head staﬀmember).
You will have to think about what questions to ask at the interview,
and this will depend in turn on what you are looking for. What technical
proﬁciencies are needed?
What people skills?
Is the written, oﬃcial job
description an accurate picture of the job? Or are other duties expected?
Will this person have to be ﬂexible about hours, or perhaps work on weekends
(if the candidate is a single parent then this could be very relevant). Find
out what the candidate wants to ask you; this could be quite revealing. Of
course acquaint yourself with the candidate’s employment history, and try
to get a sense of why he/she left the previous positions.
In the end you will have to make a decision, help train and acclimate
the new employee, and try to help him/her ﬁt in and do the job. Another
unfortunate feature of being Chair is that you must also decide when a staﬀ

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
195
member has to be terminated.14 A bad apple among the staﬀcan be ex-
tremely disruptive and aﬀect the entire departmental work ﬂow. It is your
job, and basically yours alone (in concert with the Administrative Assistant
or Oﬃce Manager), to monitor the staﬀsituation and make sure that things
are going smoothly and people are getting along. If they are not, then you
must do something about it. There are people in the administration whose
job it is to help you with these matters; you should call on them without
hesitation to help you get through these situations smoothly.
6.7.16
Working Together as a Team
Getting mathematicians to work together on a project is like herding cats. I
am not the ﬁrst to utter this witticism, and I won’t be the last. We are by
nature—in fact by our very training—bohemians. Each of us tends to march
to his/her own drummer. To set our own goals and pursue our own truths. A
good geophysicist once told me that in his discipline they do not value ideas
and originality—in fact they ﬁnd such artifacts quaint and confusing. What
they value is organizing data. Such a statement is bewildering and almost
oﬀensive to the mathematician. Ideas and originality are just about the only
things that we do value. And we tend to pursue them in the tradition of the
single-combat warrior—alone on a steed looking for a grail.
However the view of university administrators is rather diﬀerent. Deans
like departments that work together on big projects. I can’t tell you how
many times, as Chair, I went to our Dean with some big idea for our
Department—perhaps re-inventing our calculus sequence, or re-designing the
Math Major, or setting up an Internship program for our graduate students.
Every time—every time—the Dean would bestow upon me a pitying smile
and say, “How are you going to pull this oﬀwith that group of clowns you
have over in the Math Building?” The Dean, too, knew that we were bo-
hemians each plowing his/her own path, but he saw the matter somewhat
less charitably than you and I do.
I once served on the Provost’s advisory committee at my university. Our
job was to examine diﬃcult situations that the Provost was called upon to

14As Chair, I attended a meeting of Chairs, hosted by the Dean, which he began by
saying, “You can’t get rid of your tenured faculty but you can get rid of your staﬀ. Take
a hard look at your staﬀ. If any of them is not performing up to snuﬀ, we can show you
how to terminate them.

of the dental school, (ii) a particularly egregious and thorny case of cheating
by an undergraduate, (iii) a tricky tenure case that was being challenged.
The tenure case involved a young fellow who had been denied tenure in some
Engineering Department.
He thought the decision unjust, and he ﬁled a
formal grievance. On our investigation, it did appear that the candidate had
reasonable scientiﬁc credentials, and his teaching was at an acceptable if not
stellar level; so perhaps there was something to investigate. Here is what we
found.
This was an academic department that functioned according to the fol-
lowing paradigm (quite unfamiliar to the academic mathematician): The
Department, as a group, would identify a large, long-term research project
to work on. It would apply for several large grants to fund the work. Get-
ting the grants, the Department would then set up laboratories, apportion
the work among the entire faculty (and the graduate students), and then
begin their investigations. The point that I want to stress is that the entire
department—faculty and graduate students and staﬀ—would engage in this
big research project. There were no exceptions, no crusty individualists who
said, “I’ve got this other little thing I want to do. The rest of you have fun.”
It was a zero-one game.
Well, this tenure candidate came from a cultural background wherein it
was customary to be rude, abrasive, and uncooperative (by Western stan-
dards). He couldn’t get along with anyone in the Department. He couldn’t
function proactively at the weekly team meetings. He couldn’t collaborate.
He was not, by any stretch of the imagination, a team player. And that is
why they denied him tenure. The decision was not a judgement against the
quality of his scientiﬁc work, nor a criticism of his teaching, nor a criticism
of his departmental service. They just didn’t like him. He couldn’t get with
the program.
I, as a Mathematician, had a problem with this situation. I am quite
accustomed to people who cannot get with the program, who are not team
players, who revel in being a thorn in our collective sides. Some of these
people are my best friends. If I want to form a judgment about a Mathe-
matician, I look at his/her record on MathSciNet, assess the published works,
read some of them as appropriate, and reach some conclusion based on the
quality of the scientiﬁc work. You would never catch me saying, “This per-
son has an abrasive personality, he/she is no fun on committees, he can’t
get with the program in the lab, so don’t tenure him/her. Or don’t promote
him/her. Or don’t give him/her the perk that he/she is applying for.” I’m

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
197
just not made that way, and I think that in fact most of us are not.
In the end the Provost’s Advisory Committee decided to uphold the De-
partment’s decision not to tenure this particular scholar. Even though the
case was problematic, even though there were valid arguments on both sides
of the question, in the end we realized that we could not veto the way that
this Department does business. Clearly this candidate knew what he was
getting into when he accepted this job. And he just couldn’t play the game.
It was unavoidable to conclude that the situation we had was at least partly
of his own making. So we upheld the denial of tenure. And he is now gone.
Part of my message here is that the Provost was quite sympathetic to
the point of view of that particular Engineering Department. The Provost
values teamwork, and admires a department that can organize itself to work
on a big project. He had little sympathy for a candidate who could not toe
the line. Like it or not, that is how Administrators see the world.
If you are lucky, in your own Department, you as Chair will be able to
identify a notable subset of your faculty who can function as team players. It
would be especially eﬀective if some of those team members were also people
who were active researchers and good teachers. Because that will give the
team credibility, and increase the likelihood that you can recruit new people
to the team in the future. Having such a team, you will be able to take on
some larger projects, and thereby curry the favor of your Dean or Provost.
6.7.17
Supporting Your Faculty’s Teaching Eﬀorts
Clearly this is one of the most important things you can do as Chair. When
you are just an ordinary citizen in the Department, there is little of substance
that you can attempt in order to show support for your colleagues’ teaching
eﬀorts. But as Chair you can really make a diﬀerence.
For one thing you can reward those who excel at teaching. When it comes
time for raises, single out those who shine. Praise them to the Dean—with
concrete information to support your case—and propose a good raise. Deans
typically don’t know much about mathematics, but they fancy that they
know a good bit about teaching. They should respond proactively to this
situation.
What else can you do for your teaching force? Provide the equipment
that they need. Overhead projectors are easy (because they are relatively
cheap). Computers and allied peripherals somewhat less so just because they
tend to be expensive. But the Department ought to have two or three nice

198
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
notebook computers that people can use in their classrooms. Of course you
need computer projectors to go with them, and the good news is that these
have come down dramatically in price in the past couple of years.
Every college and university these days has a program to make classrooms
electronic. This can mean providing built-in computers (with a high-speed
Internet connection of course) with projectors and screens and other nice
peripherals.
It can mean SmartBoards® or variants thereof.15
Do what
you can to get some of the classrooms in the Math Building—especially the
rooms over which you have scheduling control—equipped in this fashion. If
your building has an Undergraduate or Graduate Lounge, see that these are
outﬁtted with suitable equipment.
If a faculty member comes to you with a request for support of his/her
teaching eﬀorts, be as proactive as you can.
Perhaps he/she needs extra
grading time, or another Teaching Assistant, or wants to make a ﬁeld trip.
Obviously you are not Donald Trump, but you do have some discretionary
funds. Try to use them proactively.
If one of your faculty wants to start a new course—in discrete dynamical
systems, or circle-packing, or cryptography, or anything else of hot and cur-
rent interest, then give suitable support to the project. You probably don’t
have the expertise to give the project your wholehearted a priori support,
but you can see to it that the idea gets a fair shot at being established.
Likewise, if one of your colleagues has a well-thought-out idea for changing
the curriculum—say merging linear algebra and ODEs, or creating a new
discrete math track—then be sure that the idea gets a fair hearing. Talk to
the Vice-Chair for Undergraduate Studies to make sure that the right people
get to review the proposal and make a measured judgment. The same remark
applies to new graduate courses, though there should be some discretion to
allow for diﬀerent people’s research interests.
6.7.18
Supporting Your Faculty’s Research Eﬀorts
Again, there is hardly anything more important that you can do in your role
as Chair. When you are an ordinary citizen, you can support your colleagues’
research by going to seminars, by collaborating with them, by helping them
15Here a SmartBoard is an electronic display board that you write on with a special
stylus.
It automatically records what you write as a binary ﬁle.
Conversely, you can
prepare a lecture at home and then present it on the SmartBoard.

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
199
with their grant proposals, and by always being willing to talk. But as Chair
you can do more.
Certainly your Dean ought to provide you with a travel fund for your
faculty. Be as generous as you can in subventing trips. If a faculty member
tells you that he wants to go to Paris and you oﬀer $150, that is really not
very helpful. Try to suit the largesse to the situation.
Sometimes one of your faculty may want to bring in a visitor—perhaps an
important collaborator. Maybe he/she wants the visitor for a full semester.
This is going to be expensive. My department has a “reserve fund” which
consists of a gratuitous kickback from the administration of grant overhead.
I could sometimes dip into this fund for larger requests like this. But many
Department Chairs will not have such discretion.
If a faculty member wants a new printer, I think that the answer should
always be “yes.” Printers are cheap, and they make people happy. For a new
computer people may have to wait their turn. If somebody wants something
moderately fancy, then you may have to take the matter under advisement.
For instance, if the faculty member wants a RAID unit, or some kind of fancy,
high-speed color scanner—something that costs a few thousand dollars—then
at the least you may have to consult your Executive Committee. You will
need to determine whether the proposed use justiﬁes the expense. Another
approach is to determine whether several members of the faculty could make
good use of this high-tech gimcrack, and then buy one for general use.
Some faculty members—especially the neophytes—may request help in
preparing a grant proposal. You may be qualiﬁed to provide that help, or
you could hook the tyro up with someone who can.
6.7.19
Endowed Lecture Series
My own Math Department is very fortunate these days because we have ﬁve
diﬀerent endowed lecture series. Each of these is a privately funded event,
taking place once per year, that brings in a distinguished speaker for one or
several days to give some talks.
Of course we have past Chairs to thank for raising the money to endow
these diﬀerent lecture series. Because they are endowed, they are a permanent
feature of our mathematical life. We can depend on them year after year.
We have one lecture series in geometry, one in analysis, one in algebra, one in
probability, and one for undergraduates. People have a lot of fun with these
events. It is a pleasure to pick the speakers. And we can oﬀer an attractive

200
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
honorarium and other perks, thus increasing the likelihood that the guests
will accept our invitation.
Endowed lecture series are a signiﬁcant component of the tapestry of
mathematical life. They are something that everyone can rally around—not
just the mathematical part but the social activities pertaining thereto. And
it doesn’t take a great deal of money to endow a lecture series. About $40,000
will do it nicely. Donors like to give money for an activity of this sort, because
it can and probably should be named after them. Each year you can give the
Ingrid Toth Lecture Series on Algebraic Geometry, and you can invite the
good Ms. Toth to the proceedings. Have her make a few remarks. Certainly
create a fuss over her. Have her to the tea and to the dinner. This is the
way that you build a relationship with a supporter of the Math Department,
and curry future giving (which could and should be of a larger caliber). The
initial rather modest gift that endows a lecture series could later grow into a
more magniﬁcent gift that endows a Chair.
If your department does not have any endowed lecture series then perhaps
you could spearhead an eﬀort to raise the money for one. Talk to your Chair
about what needs to be done and how to do it. Give a call to your University
Development Oﬃce and get something started.
6.7.20
Faculty Complaints
If some (faculty) member of the Math Department is unhappy about some-
thing then, likely as not, you as Chair will be the ﬁrst to hear of it. Sometimes
a colleague will break rank and go around you to the Dean. You hope that
this won’t happen. But it might. Then you are going to have a political
situation to mop up. Let me deal with that elsewhere.
My view as Chair of faculty complaints is that I welcomed them. In the
sense that I wanted to hear from my faculty, and I wanted the opportunity to
exchange views. And it happens that I have a particular talent for deﬂecting
blame, and making it seem as though any matter of concern is something
that is probably somebody else’s fault (certainly not mine), and something
that we could deal with together. I could usually turn these exchanges into
something productive, a catalyst for cooperation to solve a problem of mutual
interest. This is a technique that you ought to consider cultivating in yourself.
Of course some faculty complaints can be downright nasty. Sexual ha-
rassment charges are no day at the beach. Allegations that a colleague has
plagiarized, or appropriated ideas, are ugly. With any situation like this you

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
201
are going to need professional help. Your institution will have particular peo-
ple in the administration who specialize in the legalities and the psychological
issues attendant to such charges. Before you take any action whatever—and
in fact before you oﬀer any substantive comment—you should consult these
good folks. They are, after all, there to help you.
There are fun aspects to being Chair, but handling faculty complaints is
probably not one of them. Nonetheless, you can learn to turn these transac-
tions into something you can build on, and in fact a way to strengthen your
relations with your colleagues. You are like a union steward, looking after
the best interests of the Math Department faculty. If you can convey that
idea to your colleagues, you will all be better oﬀ.
6.7.21
Faculty Discipline
It does not come up often—thank heaven—but sometimes a member of your
faculty will need to be disciplined.
If the infraction is sexual harassment or something of that nature, then
it is a legal situation and higher powers will take over. You, the Chair, will
play an ancillary role.
If the faculty member is guilty of ﬁnancial misconduct then, again, you
as Chair cannot really act alone. It is not so easy to engage in fraud as a
member of the Math Department. You would really have to work at it. One
possibility is that the individual borrowed from petty cash and failed to pay
back the “loans.” If that is the case you may be able to just get the person
to pay up, give him/her a good talking to, and then get back to business as
usual. But I know of a case, for example, in which the Chair was in cahoots
with the Administrative Assistant to ﬁle fraudulent travel reports and pocket
the ghostly reimbursement checks. This clearly is thievery and fraud. They
were caught and sent to jail.
Certainly in cases such as this last the administration will have to become
involved. And it is really not so pleasant, nor very pretty, to have to be the
whistle blower. If you become aware of an infraction of the sort just described,
you would probably do well to ﬁnd a colleague who will support you in the
eﬀort to bring the oﬀenders to justice. And you might be smart to hire a
personal attorney as well.
If instead the faculty member has failed to meet his/her classes, then you
the Chair will be directly involved. You will have to document the dates
and times and extent of the misdeeds. Was the faculty member routinely

202
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
late, or did he/she actually miss class? How many times? And with what
consequences for the students? Did this occur just in one semester—perhaps
when the faculty member’s spouse was hospitalized—or has it occurred re-
peatedly? Have you, the Chair, tried to discuss the matter with the faculty
member, and with what eﬀect? Is some improvement on the horizon?16
If you are put in the position of having to level threats against the un-
cooperative faculty member then you will have to do so in concert with the
Dean. The Dean has the power to actually take measures against the intran-
sigent faculty member. You really do not (unless the Dean is behind you).
You will ﬁnd that the Dean has very little sympathy for faculty who do not
acquit their teaching duties reliably and professionally. He/she will be quick
to act if you bring in a case of dereliction of duty.17
Everyone makes mistakes, and everyone should be given a chance to rec-
tify those mistakes. It is the recurring problems that must be dealt with
decisively. If you are lucky you can sniﬀout these problems early on and nip
them in the bud before they become felonious. If not, then you will have a
price to pay with your time and your eﬀort and your peace of mind.
6.7.22
Prima Donnas and the Like
A prima donna is a female, solo opera singer. The prima donna is often a
soprano, and is generally the star of the show. People will attend an opera
because of who the prima donna is that evening. Because of the popularity
16There was a famous case about thirty-ﬁve years ago of a tenured Professor at an
important university in the Northeast who ran a publishing company in another city. He
was absent a lot from his job. He generally got other faculty to cover his teaching for
him, but they got tired of it after a while. Complaints were ﬁled. And some point the
Chancellor issued this faculty member a forthwith: You will be in front of your class on
thus and such a date, and continuously thereafter until the end of the semester, or you
will be terminated. The faculty member said, “Oh, Chancellors never do that. I’m safe.”
He was terminated.
17Another fairly well publicized case concerned a professor in Illinois who was the world’s
foremost expert on nude beaches. Really. He was very much in demand whenever there
was a court case anywhere in the country involving nude beaches. He would be ﬂown in,
put up in fancy hotels, and paid a handsome honorarium to provide his testimony. So
naturally he was having a ball. But he missed a lot of classes. He worked in a department
where teaching was the main thing; most of his colleagues really didn’t have a scholarly life
to speak of. And they were quite jealous of Mr. Nude Beach. They got tired of covering
his classes for him, and they ﬁnally just turned him in. He was dismissed from his tenured
position.

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
203
factor for prima donnas, they are often confused with divas.
Maria Callas was a prima donna, and so was Beverly Sills. While Beverly
was a kind and gracious lady, generous with all who worked with her, Maria
was something of a contentious pain in the neck. Indeed, Prima donnas are
reputed to be vain, hot-tempered, and diﬃcult.
The arena of mathematics has its fair share of prima donnas. They are
usually not female—just because the profession is still dominated by males.
The guy/gal who just got a paper into the Annals, or who just got an invita-
tion to the International Congress, or who just won the Steele Prize, or just
got a big grant, may be your local prima donna. It will be your privilege,
and your burden, as Chair to deal with this person.
The prima donna mathematician is liable to have many demands. Surely
he/she will want a very nice salary. And one of the nicest oﬃces in the de-
partment. And perhaps more than the usual allotment of secretarial help.
He/she may want a special travel fund. If this person really is a quite dis-
tinguished mathematician, then it is likely that quite a few people will want
to visit him/her. And you, the Chair, will be expected to pay for this travel.
Of course you want to take care of the accomplished people in your crew.
The prima donna no doubt adds quite a lot of luster to your Math Depart-
ment, and helps to make it famous. The Harvard Department was famous
in the 1950s because it had Oscar Zariski and Lars Ahlfors. Nobody remem-
bers very many of the other people. Fortunately Oscar and Lars were fairly
reasonable guys, and overall added to everyone else’s pleasure in life.
The trouble, of course, is that your resources are limited.
You have
plenty of other individuals in your ﬂock who work hard and accomplish a lot.
They may not glow in the dark like your favorite prima donna, but they are
quite deserving of emoluments and recognition. You will have to work with
your Dean to do right by everyone. If you can arrange an endowed Chair
Professorship for your prima donna, then that will solve your problem in one
fell swoop. For then that particular faculty member is no longer on your
budget—he/she is instead on the Dean’s budget (because the Dean controls
the Chair professorships). So the prima donna’s raises, and all his/her perks,
are under the Dean’s purview. And you can use the limited raise money given
to you each Spring to look after all your other faculty.
Many of your duties as Chair are a balancing act, and this item of handling
your celebrity faculty is just one of them. There is always the danger that
a fancy faculty member who feels that he/she is not being treated right will
get an outside oﬀer and leave (see the next section). You will have to cross

204
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
that bridge when you come to it.
6.7.23
Outside Oﬀers
Certainly one of the more challenging and interesting events that can occur
under your watch is that one of your faculty will come to you with an outside
oﬀer (see also Section 4.16 for the faculty member’s point of view). This
means that he/she has a job oﬀer from another university—presumably with
a nice salary and other accoutrements to make it attractive.
You will have to examine your conscience to decide how to respond to an
outside oﬀer. Of course you want to treat your colleagues with dignity and
respect. The gentlemanly thing to do is to make a competitive counteroﬀer.
Of course one of the most frustrating things about being Chair is that there
are lots of things that you want to do and you do not have the power to do
them. So you will have to go to the Dean.
The Dean always has his eye on the budget, and he/she will probably
require some convincing. If the outside oﬀer is from Harvard or Princeton,
then you hold a lot of good cards. If instead the outside oﬀer is from South-
east Arkansas State then you may have a problem on your hands. I know
of more than one situation in which a Dean simply refused to respond to an
outside oﬀer. He said, “I guess that this person wants to go there for per-
sonal reasons. I am not going to make a counter-oﬀer for an institution like
that one.” In a situation like this, you may have some discretionary funds in
the department that you can use to sweeten your colleague’s position a bit.
Or perhaps you can adjust the teaching load down for a time. Or set up a
travel fund. Or arrange for some nice raises for a few years. But, without
the Dean’s cooperation, an actual counter-oﬀer may not be possible.
If the Dean is willing to play ball with you, then you need to have all the
relevant information at your ﬁngertips. Find out all the details of the oﬀer,
and all the perks. Find out what is special about this school, and why your
colleague thinks he/she wants to go there. Find out about his/her spouse’s
situation. Is the competing school doing something special for the spouse?
Can you respond to that? What about his/her kids?
There is only so much you can do, especially since you as Chair do not
write the checks. In many instances—certainly not all—the faculty member
with an outside oﬀer is simply looking for some attention and some kudos.
After all, it is a lot of trouble (and quite disruptive) to move. If you can
make a civilized and attractive counter-oﬀer then you may have a ﬁghting

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
205
chance of getting him/her to stay. If, however, the outside oﬀer is from the
candidate’s “dream institution”, or in the candidate’s “dream location”, then
you may be dead in the water no matter what you do.
The fact is that excellent people are movable. And they will move. We
must learn to come to grips with it. And then we hire more excellent people
and life goes on.
6.7.24
The Library
The library is really an essential part of scholarly life. In the best of all
possible worlds, the Math Department will have its own library right in
its own building.18 And also have its own dedicated librarian. The Math
collection could also be in the main library—with all the other books. That
is OK, but slightly less convenient.
Mathematicians really need to have all the latest books and journals at
their ﬁngertips. Interlibrary loan is OK, but it causes a delay of from three
days to three weeks. A good idea could be lost or go into hibernation during
that period. Often, by the time the book ﬁnally arrives, you have forgotten
why you ordered it.
Thus it is incumbent upon the Chair to look after the library, make sure it
is well funded, make sure that the right books and journals get ordered, make
sure that the Math Librarian is an asset to the Department. Typically the
Chair will appoint a colleague—as part of his/her committee duties—to look
after the library. But the Chair should keep his/her ﬁnger on the pulse of the
situation. These days, with so many resources available electronically, and so
many books and journals available at reduced prices through bundling, the
library decisions are technical and complex. The Chair will do well to have
a good relationship with the Math librarian so that decisions can be made
in the full ﬂower of good information and knowledge of what all the choices
are.
18At the Universite Autonoma de Madrid they brag that the Math Library is right there
in the building. And indeed it is. But the building dates from the Fascist era in Spain—it
is a huge ediﬁce.
In fact the Math Library is about a 20-minute walk from the Math
oﬃces.

206
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
6.7.25
Computer Support and Technology for the De-
partment
Any time the Department develops a new need then new funds are going to
be required. And, absent private donations, you the Chair are going to have
to get those funds from the Dean.
Thirty-ﬁve years ago, departments had to convince the Dean to buy or
lease a big, fancy photocopy machine for the group. Prior to that people
had reproduced their exams and even their research papers with either ditto
masters or mimeograph masters. This was quite a primitive technology, with
roots in nineteenth century methods of document reproduction. But it was
all we had. The great thing about a ditto or a mimeograph machine is that it
only cost a couple of hundred dollars, and it required very little mainenance.
Also the cost per copy was very low. A photocopy machine is several orders of
magnitude diﬀerent in every category. Edwin Beckenbach, one of the grand
old men of the UCLA Math Department when I knew him in the late 1970s,
told me that the biggest ﬁght he ever had with the Math Department when
he was Chair was when he advocated that they get a motor-driven ditto
machine to replace their hand-cranked one.19 Even in the early 1980s when I
was at Penn State the old timers used a mimeograph machine to copy exams.
Even when I came to Washington University in 1986 the department used
to send out its big photocopy jobs. It had no large-scale photocopy machine.
Now it has two large, state-of-the art machines right in the oﬃce. Photocopy
machines require not only an initial outlay of money but also a maintenance
and service contract.
This is what the Dean calls an entitlement, which
means that it’s not a one-oﬀexpense.
It is a continuing ding in his/her
budget. So the Dean will think hard before saying “yes” to something like
this.
A more recent ﬁscal development—especially for Math Departments—is
computers. Now every faculty member20 wants a computer on his/her desk,
and certainly wants access to e-mail with a high-speed connection. Both
of these cost money. I know people who work at small colleges where the
computer support just isn’t there; and they buy their own Internet service
with their own funds. At big universities we expect the institution to do it.
19In those days Math Departments did little hiring, and there were few people to tenure,
and there was certainly never any discretionary money, so there was little else to ﬁght
about.
20The graduate students too need access to computers.

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
207
And any good-sized Math Department will want not only the equipment,
but also someone to maintain the system. With ﬁfty or more people net-
worked, and printers and scanners, and a staﬀthat is perhaps on a LAN so
that they can share databases and spreadsheets, there are innumerable com-
puter headaches that require constant attention. So you can just imagine
the Chair going to the Dean and saying, “My Department needs a full-time
computer technician. These guys don’t come cheap. I ﬁgure a salary of $80K
per year plus beneﬁts.” The Dean would have myocardial infarction.
The Washington University Physics Department supports most of its
computer people using soft money from grants. But a Math Department
typically will not have that kind of money in grants. So the University has
to pitch in. It is a battle to get this money, and to convince the Dean that
computer maintenance people are now part of life and he/she would have to
pony up. For many years a number of Math Departments maintained their
computer systems with faculty volunteers—obviously not an attractive op-
tion. In my own department we had to sneak our computer person in through
the back door. We brought him in as a scholar from China on a grant that
one of us had. He was a harmonic analyst who also happened to have some
computer skills. Over time, his activities became more and more computer-
oriented and less and less math-oriented. And his salary moved away from
the grant and onto the Department budget. Now he is a full-time, salaried
member of the staﬀ. We also have a regular budget item each year—of about
$10,000—to buy new computer equipment for the faculty and staﬀ. These
are all new budget items that have come about in the last twenty years, and
they had to be pried out of the Dean. But they are essential to the way that
we now run our lives.
6.7.26
Part-Time Faculty and Freeway Fliers
Most modern Math Departments do more Lower-Division teaching than any
other department in Arts & Sciences. What with pre-calculus, calculus, dis-
crete math, linear algebra, statistics, and diﬀerential equations, there is a
great panoply of subject areas that need mathematics. And more and more
disciplines—such as Biology—are becoming mathematical. So the demand
is increasing. At my own university, in a typical semester, the Math Depart-
ment will oﬀer about 75 courses while the Chemistry Department (which has
more faculty) will oﬀer about 15 courses. Even with this growth in clientele,
many Math Departments have shrunk in size in the past 25 years. Ohio

208
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
State used to be the leader with about 110 faculty. Now it has about 85.
U. C. Berkeley and other major departments have also shrunk. But we still
must cover our courses. We do not want the University to start pondering
having Engineering teach its own calculus courses or Physics teach its own
diﬀerential equations courses. Don’t laugh. These other department feel that
they are well-qualiﬁed to teach such courses, and they would love to have the
business.
Many parts of life consist in making peace among conﬂicting vectors.
In the situation under discussion here, we want to do a responsible job of
covering our teaching obligations. But we certainly do not want to raise
faculty teaching loads. In the 1940s and 1950s, even people like Andr´e Weil
taught three or more courses per semester. But that is no longer considered
acceptable. Two courses per semester is considered reasonable, and many
institutions have a lower teaching load than that.
If you take oﬀyour shoes and count, you realize that it simply is not
possible to cover all the teaching obligations that a modern Math Depart-
ment has using just the tenure-track faculty. Of course one can also ask the
instructors and postdocs to teach, and typically we do. An important part
of being a postdoc is getting some teaching experience. But that still won’t
cover the nut at many schools. Especially at big state schools, there is a huge
clientele in calculus and even pre-pre-calculus (today, in an eﬀort at politi-
cal correctness, these sorts of courses are given the monicker “developmental
math”). So what is to be done?
The answer is to hire part-time faculty. These are people who are usu-
ally not under contract, and are hired course-by course.
The pay is not
muniﬁcent—often between $2,500 and $4,000 per course. Usually the courses
that these folks are given to teach will be subjects that the regular faculty
don’t want to teach—pre-calculus, statistics, freshman calculus, and the like.
Part-time faculty frankly are not treated very well. They usually do not have
the full services of the staﬀ; often they must do their own photocopying and
other clerical tasks. They are certainly not provided with department-paid
graders. They must do their own grading.
Some part-timers—the lucky ones—will get year-long contracts. They
will teach six to eight courses during the year and receive a salary of $35,000
or so. Of course these people do not have tenure, and do not have any of the
perks that a tenure-track faculty member would have. Tey don’t have their
own oﬃces; often they get by with just a cubicle, or a shared desk. They
do not participate in faculty meetings, they do not direct graduate students,

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
209
they do not get regular raises.
Other part-timers are not so lucky. Known as freeway ﬂiers, these folks
will teach two courses at this school and one course at that school and three
courses at some other school. If one is energetic and determined then it is
actually possible to make a living in this fashion. But it is draining and not
very rewarding.
The harsh reality today is that many junior colleges have just a nucleus
of permanent faculty and a huge collection of part-timers. With the budget
that a typical Junior College Math Department has, this is all that can be
managed. As one goes up the food chain, one sees the proportions change.
At Washington University we used to have a small collection of about four
part-timers who did a really good job handling certain courses for us. But
the Dean decided that a high-class place like Washington University should
have all its courses taught by regular faculty. So we had to dismiss all our
part-time faculty. This caused a real strain on our resources, but that is how
it is. It is ironic that the Dean ignores the fact that English uses an army of
part-timers to teach Freshman Writing, and the French Department uses a
gaggle of part-timers to teach basic French. But Math is treated diﬀerently.
What else is new?
When I was Chair, it used to put quite a strain on my budget to pay our
part-time faculty. For a time the Dean gave me money to help out. Then he
stopped, as part of an eﬀort to freeze them out. When I persisted in hiring
part-time faculty, he ﬁnally just ordered me not to do it anymore.
The Princeton Math Department doesn’t hire part-time faculty; the Rut-
gers Math Department—which is right up the road—certainly does. The
Harvard Math Department doesn’t hire part-time faculty; the University
of Massachusetts Math Department—which is right up the road—certainly
does. This is the world we live in. It is an embarrassing but solid fact that
often the part-time faculty are better teachers than the regular faculty. This
is because in many cases they are young, committed, they are not trying to
develop research careers, and they care. It certainly gives the Dean pause
for thought when he/she sees that someone who is getting $4,000 to teach a
course gets notably better Teaching Evaluations than someone who is getting
a salary of $130,000 per year.

210
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
6.7.27
Chair Professorships for the Department
One indicator of the Dean’s regard for the Math Department is how many
endowed Chair Professorships he is willing to give the group.21 An endowed
Chair is a special position for a distinguished scholar that entails
• a special salary
• a reduced teaching load, or special courses to teach
• a discretionary fund for travel, computer equipment, visitors, and the
like
• a personal secretary
• invitations to special events
The endowed Chairs are really the royalty of the university. They are invited
to special functions, a big fuss is made over them at every opportunity, and
they are something to show oﬀto visitors and dignitaries.
One great thing about an endowed Chair is that the holder of the Chair
is taken oﬀthe Departmental budget. He/she is paid from the endowment,
which is the Dean’s funds. This means essentially that the Department still
gets the beneﬁt of this person’s presence, and this person’s teaching, but
doesn’t pay for it. Obviously a good deal. Therefore, when the Chair is
ﬁguring raises, he/she can concentrate on everyone else; because the bigshot
is the Dean’s problem. And all the bigshot’s perks are the Dean’s problem
also.
It’s obviously a good thing for the Math Department to have several
endowed Chairs, or at least to have about as many as Chemistry or Physics
or Biology has. At my own university Mathematics has one endowed Chair
while History has ﬁve. Chemistry has three. Physics has four. When, as
Chair, I went to the Dean to discuss getting more endowed Chairs for Math
he would always give me the ﬂip answer that, “Donors don’t give money for
Math.” And that was the end of that discussion.
It costs about $2 million to $4 million to endow a Chair, depending on
how much the University is willing to kick in. A donor likes to give money for
an endowed Chair because it is something quite visible that his/her name will
21Many public universities do not have endowed Chairs, so my remarks may be primarily
relevant to private universities in the United States.

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
211
be attached to: The Joe Schlomokin Endowed Chair in Fractal Technology is
typical. It is true—consistent with my Dean’s dismissive claim—that donors
in recent years have concentrated on women’s studies, the humanities, and
the arts. Donations for Chairs in science are fewer. And Chemistry and
Physics do seem to be more visible—in the public eye—than Math. The
big winner for endowed Chairs is Medicine, largely because of the grateful
patient syndrome. If the favorite nephew of some wealthy St. Louis scion
is cured of cancer by the good doctors at Barnes Hospital, he/she will want
to show appreciation in a big way. Endowing a Chair is a win-win situation
for everyone: Mr. Gotrocks gets a Chair named after him/herself, and the
University gets a big plum. Unfortunately, nobody ever died of taking a
calculus exam (although they may have felt as though they had).
I, as Department Chair, endeavored to raise money for an endowed Chair
for the Department.
I in fact worked with the University Development
Oﬃce—and these are the real pros at drumming up funds. I was able to
raise money for some smaller things, like an endowed lecture series and an
Undergraduate scholarship. But we never came close to getting a Chair.
If your department has an endowed Chair Professor, and he/she an-
nounces that he/she will retire, then it is standard for people to start to
discuss who next should get the Chair. This is wrong-headed. The Chair
does not belong to the Department. It belongs to the Dean, and it goes back
into his pool. The Math Department will have to compete for it along with
everyone else.
Sometimes a wealthy donor will give the University funds for an endowed
Chair in some ﬁeld that the University would rather stay away from. Not too
many years ago some rather tainted Middle Eastern oil money was oﬀered
for an endowed Chair in Petroleum Studies. The donors had a hard time
ﬁnding an American University that would accept the gratuity, but they
ﬁnally did. Around the same time some Ross Perot type gave Washington
University about $15 million to endow ﬁve Chairs in the study of Fractals.
The University took the money, and endowed the Chairs, but it interpreted
“the study of Fractals” rather loosely, and the Chair Professors are in many
diﬀerent departments doing many diﬀerent things.
6.7.28
Retirement and Emeritus Professors
Not long ago the retirement laws in the United States changed. It used to
be that everyone retired at age 65. Then it became 70. In the early 1990s,

212
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
as a nod to the “gray panthers”, the retirement age was raised to +∞for
all but those in a few select professions. One of the select professions was
the professoriate. These folks still had to retire at age 70. Then, in 1994,
the law changed one last time: Now the retirement age is +∞for everyone.
This means that you never have to retire if you don’t wish to.
Well, it’s more complicated than that. Clearly we can’t have Math Pro-
fessors who are a bit dotty, and who no longer can calculate a derivative.
How could such a person teach? So what we ought to do is give a compe-
tence exam—right? The trouble with that is you cannot give a competence
test just to the old guys. You have to give it to everyone. That’s the law.
And the younger guys/gals certainly don’t want to take such a test.
Some states now do administer competence tests to everyone. So every
ﬁve years each of the distinguished faculty, as well as the geezers, must sit
down and show that he/she can solve a ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerential equation,
or integrate by parts. Most states don’t. And that’s the point.
There are certain individuals whom you as Chair would like to get to
retire. And they don’t seem to want to do it. There are a variety of reasons
for this. Some individuals have no other interests. Their life is coming to
the Math Department, doing a little teaching, and hanging out with the
gang. Some individuals think that they need the money. Some people are
committed to a certain program, or a certain curriculum, and want to manage
it. Some people are just stubborn.
There are lots of solipsistic reasons for you as Chair to want to get rid
of these people. One is that they may no longer be the best teachers. You
could probably do better to hire some bright young guy/gal who represents an
active research area and will inject new energy and life into the Department.
And if you can get this older person to retire then you just might be able to
convince the Dean to give you a new position and hire such a ray of light.
And for much less money! So how is this done?
Sometimes the university will help. Just as an instance, the University
of California has in recent years had two very attractive golden parachute
programs. For people who had been in the saddle for 25 or 30 years, it was
almost impossible not to retire—the ﬁnancial incentives were just too strong.
Plus one could still go back and teach a course now and then if one wished to
do so—and be paid for it. And one could keep an oﬃce in the Math Building.
What could be better?
One of the reasons that U.C. could institute such a program is that the
University of California retirement fund is a separate ﬁnancial instrument

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
213
from the regular U.C. budget. And in fact it is quite well ﬁxed these days.
Unlike the Social Security system, it has plenty of excess cash, so it can aﬀord
to make allotments to get some of the old codgers oﬀthe books and into a
happy retirement.
Not every school can make such an arrangement. Lots of college and
university faculty have TIAA/CREF plus Social Security for a retirement
package. That has much to recommend it, but it doesn’t have the built-in
latitude to create golden parachuter programs. So then it is up to the Dean
to do something. Our Dean will oﬀer two years full salary with no duties to
anyone who will sign on the dotted line and agree to retire.
A few years ago we had a faculty member who had some severe medical
disabilities. As a result he had a a hard time teaching well. He still enjoyed
working on his own, and doing mathematics. But the medications he was
taking interfered with his hearing and his vision so he could not be a good
and eﬀective teacher. But he didn’t want to go on disability, in part because
that arrangement was not ﬁnancially very attractive. So I, as Chair, had to
sit down and talk to him and his wife and convince him that we would all be
better oﬀif he retired. And of course I outlined things that I, with the Dean’s
approval, could do for him to make his life comfortable and rewarding and to
insure that he would still be considered an active member of the Department.
This actually worked, and he agreed to retire.
When one of your colleagues does retire, it is nice for everyone if you
can treat him/her with some dignity and respect. The custom at Princeton,
for example, is that when you retire they ask for your oﬃce key and wave
goodbye. That’s it. The only faculty member who was allowed to retain an
oﬃce after retirement was Solomon Lefschetz, and he used to come into work
when he was well into his 90s. The reason that Salomon Bochner became
Chair at Rice University after his retirement is that he felt no longer welcome
in Princeton.
Many of us can do better than old Princeton. Often the Chair can arrange
for the retired Professor to have an oﬃce—though it may be a shared oﬃce.
He/she should be allowed access to a telephone, have a library card, to use a
computer with a high-speed Internet connection, and to ask for small favors
from the staﬀ. In some cases it is possible to arrange for the retired faculty
member to teach occasionally—assuming that he/she wishes to do so—and
even to be paid for it. It is very pleasant to be a retired faculty member,
with no committee duties or other tiresome obligations, and still be able to
oﬀer a class from time to time. It makes one feel as thought he/she is still

214
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
part of the enterprise, and still contributing.
It can be a problem if a retired faculty member comes in with a 100-
page mathematical manuscript and wants it typed. These old guys don’t
know from TEX, and they remember the old days of manuscript typists.
When this happened to me during my time as Chair, I—in an eﬀort to be
accommodating—had to use Department funds to hire a student to type up
the paper. It cost me about $500.
A standard courtesy is to grant a newly retired Professor the status of
Emeritus. This is sometimes done by a vote of the faculty and sometimes
simply decided by the Dean. The Emeritus nomenclature is just a way to
formalize the fact that the retired faculty member is still a member of the
group and still has certain rights and privileges. An acquaintance of mine
recently had a very unpleasant separation from his Mathematics Department.
He was, in eﬀect, forced to retire—and was banned from campus. It was really
pretty ugly, and there were a lot of lawyers involved. Part of the settlement
is that everyone is under a gag order, so that the rest of us cannot determine
what really went on there. Another part of the settlement is that this guy is
not allowed to refer to himself as Emeritus.
6.7.29
Tenured Faculty Changing Departments
When I was an undergraduate I heard a lecture by some bigshot at U. C.
Berkeley who announced during his talk that he had just changed departments—
from Mathematics to Celestial Mechanics. He allowed that he had done so
“for epistemological reasons.” I was ﬂabbergasted. I could hardly imagine
being a tenured faculty at any university—much less a prestigious place like
U. C. Berkeley. That said, I couldn’t imagine why one would want to change
departments. What better place could there be than the good old Math
Department?
Well, people’s interests change. If you as a Mathematician begin a col-
laboration with a Chemical Engineer or a Physicist, then the focus of your
research could shift dramatically. It could, over a period of years, start to
make sense for you to spend much more time in the allied department than
in your home department. Does this justify a formal shift in your aﬃliation?
First we should say something about what the role of your department
is in your life. After all, you are you. Your research is yours. Your teach-
ing is yours. What diﬀerence does it make if you are even a member of the
Etruscan Philology Department? The answer is this: (a) your tenure is to

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
215
a particular department, (b) your teaching assignment comes from a partic-
ular department, (c) your committee duties are in a particular department,
(d) your raises come from a particular department. So your departmental
aﬃliation can shape your life, and certainly aﬀect your life. You should not
change aﬃliation lightly.
As a ﬁrst step, if you feel a shift taking place, it could be arranged that
you have a courtesy appointment in the allied department. In practice this
means that you can check books out of their library, and perhaps oﬀer a
course in that other department. As a next step, with the cooperation of
the two Chairs and the Dean, it can be designed that you will have a joint
appointment.
This is a real shift, and will really impact your day-to-day
life. For now you have two sets of teaching obligations, two sets of service
obligations, and two sets of research obligations. And two Chairs have a say
about your raises, and your travel funds, and your other perks. You may ﬁnd
the joint appointment unsatisfactory—a case in which the whole is greater
than the sum of its parts, but in a negative way—and then decide to make
the full move. This will have to be done with the cooperation of the Dean
and the two relevant Chairs. And the faculty may need to vote on it. It is
liable to be complicated, but in the end may be a very positive change for
you.
6.7.30
Raising Money for Your Department
Most Chairs give little thought to the question of raising outside funds for
their Departments. Each year the Chair is given a budget, and he/she works
to live within it. The Chair ﬁgures that the University has a Development
Oﬃce, and those are the folks who know how to raise money. So let them
do it.
This is a perfectly reasonable attitude, and a widely held one. But the
Lord helps those who help themselves. I know one successful Chair at a big
research university who managed to raise $3 million from Department alumni
and corporate donors in his ﬁrst three years of oﬃce. Imagine having such a
fund for one’s discretionary use. The income from this principal would be at
least $150,000 per year, and that is quite a discretionary fund to have.
The fact is—and professional fundraisers will tell you this—that there are
lots of people out there who have money to give, and who want to give, and
they just need to be educated. You need to convince those good folks that
they would be happier giving the money to you than to somebody else. There

216
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
are good books (see [BRA] or [FLA]) that will help you to learn how to do
this. You need to make the donor part of the Math Department family, invite
them to events, make them feel that they are contributing to a dynamic,
exciting, growing enterprise that enhances the American educational eﬀort.
I have known some of these donors personally, and they spoke glowingly of
how their relationship with the University had enriched their lives (while
they concomitantly enriched the University!).
There is a particular style and form that a letter soliciting donations
should take. The books on this subject will tell you what type of stationery
to use, what shape the paper, what kind of stamp to put on the envelope,
and how to write the return address. The point is that you don’t want the
recipient to drop your letter in the trashbin; you want him/her to read it and
think about it. There are particular tricks for making this happen. Once you
have your foot in the door, then you must arrange to meet the donor and
make your pitch. And you must follow through.
Getting people to donate money—especially big money—is not a one-
shot operation. It may take six months to a year to develop the right sort
of relationship and then to getting around to making the money pitch. It is
a real art, and one that you will have to learn. But the potential payoﬀis
enormous.
6.7.31
The Interface Between the Dean and the Fac-
ulty
Your Dean—perhaps he/she is the Dean of Arts & Sciences or the Dean of
Science or maybe even the Dean of Mathematical Sciences—manages a good
many departments. It is quite common for a Dean of Arts & Sciences to
manage twenty-ﬁve or more departments. Yours is just one of them. The
Dean is most likely not a mathematician (in fact odds are that the Dean is
a Chemist), and probably doesn’t know much about Mathematics. If the
Dean is a good Dean, and a Dean who wants what is best, then he/she will
be good at managing people and good at setting goals for the University.
But he/she cannot possibly have detailed knowledge of every discipline.
It is easy to understand these concepts in the abstract but sometimes
hard to get your arms around them in concrete situations. You will go to
a meeting with the Dean thinking you are going to say to him/her, “We
have lost certain faculty through retirement or attrition. We have distinct

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
217
and severe needs in arithmetic algebraic geometry, string theory, nonlinear
PDEs, and several complex variables.” And you expect the Dean to know
what you are talking about. Well, he/she won’t. If you want to communicate
eﬀectively and well, then you have to speak to people in their own language.
What is the Dean after? What are his/her goals for the College and for the
Department? Whatever they may be, they are surely NOT formulated in
the language of arithmetic algebraic geometry and string theory.
If you are inexperienced as an administrator then you may ﬁnd this situ-
ation quite baﬄing. How do you approach this situation? You must learn to
make the points that are obvious to a mathematician—about speciﬁc subject
areas of mathematics, about hot-breaking ﬁelds, about particularly strong in-
dividuals or new movements in the subject—secondary and instead to play
up programmatic needs, new majors that are emerging, new job opportuni-
ties for graduate students, new directions in science overall. This may be
quite foreign to you, and you will need to think hard about these issues and
to develop new skills that will serve you well in Dean-talk. Your Executive
Commitee can help here.
If you are lucky, then the Dean will have a beniﬁcent view of the Math-
ematics Department. This will at least make him/her a priori receptive to
whatever pitch you may be making on a given day. Unfortunately, at many
schools the administration has a dim view of Mathematics. We are perceived
campus-wide as poor teachers, as scholars who are isolated and do not inter-
act with other departments, as scientists who have small grants (or in many
cases no grants at all!), and as strange ducks who are generally uncoopera-
tive. Mathematicians by nature and by training are not team players; rather,
we are more like bohemians, following our own drummer and seeking our own
truths. If the Dean wants to ﬁnd a senior member of the Chemistry faculty,
he/she phones up the Chemistry Department and says, “I want to speak to
Professor Czogolz.” The answer he/she will get is most likely, “Professor
Czogolz is in his lab. Let me get him for you.” If instead the Dean phones
the Math Department and says, “I want to speak to Professor Krantz,” the
answer that he/she gets may be, “Oh, Krantz is playing pingpong with his
graduate students.” Or “Krantz has gone for a walk in the woods.”
Or
“Krantz is taking his weekly hatha yoga class.” This unfortunately makes
no sense to the Dean. He/she doesn’t understand that my lab takes a dif-
ferent form from a Chemist’s. There are diﬀerent activities that spur my
thinking. He may, sadly, conclude that we are a bunch of unreliable weirdos
and ﬂakes.

218
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
Part of your job as Chair is to explain to the Dean—in language that he
will understand—who we are and what we are about and what we are after.
The fact of the matter is that we are serious and hardworking scholars; and
we are generally creditable teachers. But the Dean may need some help to
see these virtues clearly. Conversely, you will have to go back to the Math
Department and explain to your colleagues how the Dean has responded to
your well-thought-out proposal and what will happen next. This last task
is not always pleasant, as your colleagues may come (all too easily) to the
conclusion that you have become an apologist for the Administration.
Generally speaking, you will ﬁnd it most eﬀective to bring proactive pro-
posals to the Dean that are formulated in language, and with values, that
he/she will appreciate. Of course, if you are clever, then good things for the
Math Department will be woven into any pitch that you put to the Dean; but
the overall gloss will be that this is something that is good for the College
and good for the Undergraduate students (or whatever segment of the Uni-
versity population you may choose to beneﬁt on that day). The Dean will
not respond well to a proposal that sounds like “Gimme, gimme, gimme.”
He/she wants to think that you are a team player, and that you are taking
the broad view (just as he or she presumably is).
Deans like long-term planning. Rather than go to the Dean each year with
a narrow, limited view of what hiring you would like to do right now, you
will ﬁnd it better received to have a ﬁve-year plan for hiring. Such a plan
should take into account (i) upcoming retirements, (ii) impending tenure
cases (which may or may not be successful), (iii) new scholarly developments,
(iv) hot-breaking ﬁelds, (v) long-term medical issues for certain individuals,
(vi) disability issues. Most Deans are hard-liners about retirements. They
know full well that a faculty member can, and indeed might, hang around on
the payroll until he/she turns 80. So if you say to the Dean, “Joe Dokes is
turning 65 next year; we need to think about replacing him.”, you will ﬁnd
that the Dean is singularly unsympathetic—unless you have a signed letter
from Joe Dokes stipulating precisely when he intends to retire.
A very important point, and one that you will have to explain to your
colleagues over and over again, is this. If Professor Beans retires, or Professor
Jeans takes a job at Harvard, then that is no guarantee that the Department
will get the position restored in order to replace the lost individual. In fact
the Chair must argue for each new position as though it were from scratch.
Nobody is “automatically” replaced. The one type of replacement that is
supposed to be sacred is that if an Assistant Professor is terminated (i.e.,

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
219
not tenured) then you get to replace him/her.
This is to ensure that a
Department will not be tempted to tenure a weak candidate just to ensure
not losing the position.
My own experience as Chair was that even that
sacred trust was not universally honored.
Always prepare for meetings with the Dean.
Deans have an uncanny
ability to be on top of all sorts of information and statistics that you’ve never
even heard of. No matter what proposal or idea you come up with, he/she
can drown you in disinformation. You can ﬁght back by always knowing in
advance what the topic of any meeting with the Dean will be, and having the
relevant information at your ﬁngertips. I got to be pretty good at this, and
I was often able to turn the table on the Dean with information or statistics
that he/she had never seen.
If you are going to the Dean with a concrete proposal, you should have a
version of it with you in writing (and in multiple copies!). That way you can
leave him/her something to think about. If, by some luck, he/she approves
it on the spot then you can ask him/her to sign or initial the proposal right
then and there. It is also a good habit to send the Dean a memo after your
meeting summarizing what was said and what agreements might have been
reached.

220
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
6.7.32
Miscellany of Being Chair
Many Departments will have a formal document that comprises the Depart-
mental Bylaws. It is possible that this document is widely promulgated and
that the Department expects you to run the show according to those rules.
In my own Department (as Chair) I was the only person who had a copy of
these Bylaws. I thought they were pretty silly and I ignored them. But you
may not be able to get away with this, and you shouldn’t try.
The Department may also have a Mission Statement. This is diﬀerent
from the Bylaws, because it does not deal with details like how to run a
faculty meeting or how to distribute raises. Instead it deals with philosophical
issues about goals in research, teaching, and service. It talks about the role
of the faculty and the role of the Chair.
It talks about the place of the
Department in the University at large.
Good universities have regular outside reviews of their departments. The
way this works is that the Dean will solicit three or four distinguished scholars
in the ﬁeld (for us it would be Mathematicians) to come to your Department
and spend a few days evaluating everything that you do. This would include
teaching, research, service, interaction with the Dean, and interaction with
other parts of the institution. The review committee will examine who in the
Department has grants, who gets outside invitations, who serves on Editorial
Committees, who serves on national committees.
Usually the outside Committee is composed of people from quite distin-
guished departments, and they take their task quite seriously. Typically they
will interview every faculty member and a good many of the graduate stu-
dents and undergraduate majors. The outside Committee will write a report
that will be taken very seriously by the administration, and is liable to stand
as a template for the Department’s development for some time to come.
Of course the Chair cannot actually shape what the outside Committee
does nor how it operates. But the Chair can have an eﬀect. First, the Chair
can have a lot to say about who is chosen to serve on this Committee. And
the Chair will schedule the Committee’s activities. When my Department
had an outside review about eight years ago, the busy Committee members
could only spend two days with us. And the Chair allowed their schedule to
include half a day alone with the Dean of Engineering—a man who had a
draconian agenda against the Math Department. This was obviously a big
mistake.
If your Department does have an outside review, this will probably be

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
221
mandated and engineered by the Dean. I recommend that you as Chair form
a Taskforce to help you deal with the situation, see that the proper materials
are assembled so that the Committee will have the information that it needs
(information about faculty research, recent Ph.D.s, undergraduate majors,
and so forth), make sure that the Committee talks to the right people and
spends its time wisely.
Meet with the Dean to plan the outside review;
make sure that this is a joint eﬀort, designed and form to achieve mutually
agreeable goals.
An outside Committee report can be a great thing; it really carries some
weight with the Dean. It will have a decided eﬀect on the Department’s
future (in particular, on future hiring). Use what discretion you have as
Chair to make sure it comes out right.
Throughout this book I have emphasized the importance of hiring to
the Department. It is certainly something that everyone cares about, and a
process in which everyone will participate. I once asked Saunders Mac Lane
why the University of Chicago Math Department apparently lost ground in
the 1950s. Prior to that, their Department was arguably the pre-eminent one
in the country; after that it was not. His answer was that, in the 1950s, he
was Chair for eight years. And during that time the administration did not
allow him to do any hiring.
I have mentioned before that, after you meet with the Dean, you should
send him a memo summarizing what was said and what was agreed to. This
is also good practice when you have a meeting with a colleague. You don’t
have to generate a memo if you spent a half hour with your local ring theorist
jawing about trout ﬁshing in America. But if you talked about his/her raise,
or his/her teaching assignment, or something else of signiﬁcance, then protect
yourself with a memo. The memo is just insurance that everyone remembers
the meeting in the same way.
Some Chairs take great comfort in knowing that they can resign, and
they subliminally plan to use this as a cudgel when the going gets rough: If
the Dean won’t play ball, then threaten to resign; if the faculty is churlish
and uncooperative, then threaten to resign. I personally think that this is
wrong-headed. You signed on for this job, and you should have a considerable
commitment to seeing it through. When the situation gets tough, you should
dig in and try to make the most of the circumstance.
Resigning should
really be the action of last resort.
If you do resign, it will weaken your
standing—both with the Dean and with your colleagues—and it will weaken
the Department.

222
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
A Chair gives up some independence. You cannot travel as freely as you
once did. You cannot necessarily take weekends oﬀ. You can no longer be
the Departmental hothead. You need to comport yourself at meetings—in
fact all day long—with dignity and grace. You are the face of the Math
Department, and you represent Math to the entire campus. So you should
be someone that we can all be proud of.
6.7.33
The Duration of Your Term as Chair
Math Departments like the idea that their Chair is a rotating position. So
typically a term is three years or ﬁve years.
The trouble with a three-year term is that you spend the ﬁrst year ﬁguring
out how the job works and you spend the last year looking at the door. So
you really only have one eﬀective year in the job. Five years is probably a
more productive period of time to spend in oﬃce.
Deans take a diﬀerent view of these matters. I have certainly worked
at universities—Penn State was one of them—where the Dean viewed the
departmental Chair position as essentially a lifetime job. So the Chair of
Astronomy, the Chair of Chemistry, the Chair of Physics were all the Dean’s
handpicked henchmen, and had been in oﬃce for as long as anyone could
remember. The Math Department as usual were the bohemians, and insisted
that their Chair be rotating. This was a thorn in the Dean’s side, because
he wanted department leaders who were his handpicked crew, people who
would help him implement his policies, people he was comfortable working
with. Put a slightly diﬀerent way, the Dean ﬁnds it annoying to have to
break in a new Math Department Chair every three or ﬁve years. He/she
would strongly prefer to get a good and reliable person in there for a stretch
of time. It just makes his/her life easier.
The Dean at Penn State had a College Executive Committee whose mem-
bers were precisely these handpicked Chairs, and he used that committee to
veto decisions and policies that he did not like. So a Department would send
up a tenure case, or a new curriculum, or a new set of policies, and it would
sail through all the usual corridors of power, and then it would reach the
hallowed Executive Committee. If the Dean didn’t like this new creation, he
would just tell his gang, and they would veto it. And that would be the end
of it. That’s university politics for you.
No matter what your Dean’s paradigm for the Chair’s term, I think that
the smart thing to do when you agree to serve as Chair, and when you have

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
223
your all-important meeting with the Dean where you seal the deal and shake
hands, you should say that you will serve an initial ﬁve years and then you
can both assess the situation and see how everyone feels. That way you in
eﬀect leave your options open, and build some ﬂexibility into the situation.
6.7.34
Staying Alive While You Are Chair
Your life has many dimensions. Becoming Chair may cause you to emphasize
some and minimize others of these. But you want to keep your personal life
on an even keel. You want to keep your spouse/partner and children happy.
You want to still have some diversions and sources of pleasure. And you
want to keep your research program going.
This is diﬃcult. I spoke to one outgoing Chair at a major research insti-
tution (not in Math) who told me that, during her ﬁve-year term, she put
in eighty hours per week and that was all on departmental business. She
had no time for anything else. In addition, three of her colleagues attempted
suicide during that period. Just imagine. This would drive almost anyone
around the bend.
You must learn serious time management skills in order to maintain a
balance in your life. In my ﬁrst year as Chair, I frequently came to the
Department saying to myself, “The afternoon is wide open. Today I’ll be
able to do some math.” And I ended up doing stuﬀfor the Department
instead. You really must learn to delegate tasks. It is not necessary that you
personally do everything—just see that it is done, and done correctly. You
have a good many colleagues who can help, and you have a staﬀwho can
help. Even the Administration and its staﬀcan pitch in to make your load
a little easier in some contexts.
It is a good idea, if you can manage it, to set aside one or two afternoons
per week for yourself. This is both good for your psyche and sense of self-
worth, and also for your productivity.
I have always taken it as axiomatic that a Chair teaches little or not at
all. When I was Chair I always taught one course per year. The norm in
my Department had been double that. Many Chairs do not teach at all, and
have no trouble justifying this policy. Your Dean may have other ideas. As
mentioned elsewhere, I frequently taught the Teaching Course for graduate
students because (a) this did not require a great deal of preparation or eﬀort
and (b) I wanted to send a signiﬁcant message to the students and everyone
else that we think teaching is important. At my university, even the Dean

224
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
teaches a course sometimes. Diﬀerent institutions will be diﬀerent.
6.7.35
A Second Term as Chair
If you are reasonably successful in your ﬁrst term as Chair—this could be a
three- or ﬁve-year period—then you may be asked to serve a second term.
Or even a third term. There are upsides and downsides to this situation.
The good thing about your second term is that you have already ﬁgured
out how to do the job. There is no “burning-in period.” Second, you have
a chance to implement policies and ideas that you didn’t get around to in
the ﬁrst term. Third, you may have developed a good working relationship
with the Dean and the Department and can now hope to push it further and
get more for the Department. Last, you may take some satisfaction in doing
things for the Department and may now feel that you can do even more.
One bad feature of a second term—and I have seen this happen all too
often—is that you can get cocky. I have seen a Chair wake up one morning
early in his/her second term and say, “I’ve got this job ﬁgured out. I can do
anything. These guys/gals in the Department don’t know what’s going on.
I run the show. I know how to play it with the Dean, how to sell a proposal.
I am the Math Department.” You may think that I am making this up, but
I am not.
One such Chair at a major state university ended up, fairly early in his
second term, crafting a plan with the Dean to have a Teaching Faculty and
a Research Faculty in the Math Department. This was a perfect example
of putting a pitch to the Dean that would appeal to his/her baser instincts,
but that also had something in it for the Math Department. For the Dean’s
greatest ambition was to push this Math Department into the top ten in
the country. The Chair’s ambition was to get more resources for the Math
Department. Obviously a marriage made in heaven.
Well, the Chair and the Dean got this plan all doped out.
Then the
Chair called a faculty meeting. He stood conﬁdently in front of his ﬂock
and announced, “OK, gang, we are going to have a Teaching Faculty and a
Research Faculty. The Teaching Faculty will do all the work and the Research
Faculty will get all the perks. Fair enough? OK—you, you, you, and you are
the Teaching Faculty. And you, you, you, and you are the Research Faculty.
He just dropped it on them cold. And you can imagine how they re-
acted. They marched as one person over to the Dean’s oﬃce and said—no,
shouted—“What in the bloody heck is going on here? The Chair of the Math

6.7. THE CHAIR’S DUTIES
225
Department has just announced that we have two faculties with two diﬀerent
sets of privileges. This is worse than draconian. What do you have to say
about this?” The Deans reply was, “Huh. First I’ve ever heard of it.”
There are several lessons to be learned here. Number one is that you
cannot always trust the Dean. Number two is to always ﬁrst run new policies
by your Executive Commmittee and other trusted colleagues. Number three
is to have a little humility. Pride goeth before the fall. This particular Chair
was summarily dragged out of oﬃce with his ﬁngernails in the carpet—in
spite of the fact that his Chair-ship had been, overall, quite successful. And
it took him quite a while to recover, and to get his life back together. There
were a number of his colleagues who would never speak to him again.
Interestingly, that selfsame department had a diﬀerent Chair not too
many years later who was much more politically savvy. Working with the
same Dean, he was able to actually implement the “two faculties” policy,
and it still stands today. But he was much more clever: He never announced
it to the faculty—he just did it. And he was sure that the Dean was solidly
behind him before he began. And his ﬁrst move was to set up the necessary
infrastructure and reward system.
That Chair is now the Chancellor at
another major university.
Another downside of second and third and more terms beyond that—not
unrelated to the dangers of hubris that I’ve just described—is that you can
get stale.
In your ﬁrst term as Chair you will really try, really listen to
people, really exert yourself to be fair and balanced. After a while you will
become jaded, you won’t care so much, you will take it as more and more
obvious that the only person in the building who really understands what’s
going on is yourself. You will do less and less for the Department and more
and more to feather your own nest and advance your own agendas. I do not
mean to suggest that you will become dishonest; but you could become lazy.
And certainly less eﬀective.
I would say that, for most of us, two terms is plenty. After all, you have
another life. You are a mathematician with scholarly interests and a research
program. Why not get back to it? You might enjoy it.
6.7.36
Do You Want to Become a Dean?
Probably not. But it could be the right thing for the right person. Read on.
After you have been Chair for a while you may feel that you are a changed
person. You have developed a new skill set, you’ve learned how to manage

226
CHAPTER 6. BEING DEPARTMENT CHAIR
people, and you can get things done. You’ve beneﬁted your Department a
good deal, and now you want to take the next step and move up into the
administration. That way you can have more inﬂuence and aﬀect a good
many more people’s lives.
Even during my time as a mathematician I have seen more and more
colleagues follow this path.
Robert Zimmer at the University of Chicago
started out as Department Chair. Now he is President of the University.
Richard Herman is Chancellor at the University of Illinois in Urbana. Britt
Kirwan was Chancellor at the University of Maryland, then at Ohio State,
and now he is Chancellor of the entire University of Maryland system. A great
many mathematicians have become Deans and Provosts—I’ll just mention
Tony Chan of UCLA and Dick Gross at Harvard and Ron Douglas of SUNY
Stony Brook.
It speaks well for our discipline that we (as a group) have become more
worldly and can contribute to the running of the university. It is always good
to have allies in the upper ranks. Of course it would be foolish to expect that,
as soon as a mathematician becomes Dean or Provost or Chancellor, then
all riches will be showered on the Math Department. Quite the contrary.
The new oﬃceholder will have to bend over backwards to establish his/her
objectivity, and the person may start out actually being rather tough on his
old colleagues.
Another consideration is that it is relatively easy to become Chair. Few
others want to do the job, there is a sense that everyone should take a turn,
so if you are willing you will probably get it.
The Deanship is another
situation. There is usually a signiﬁcant pay boost, and you will have a lot
more power. Lots of people want to be Dean—including people from outside
the University. So there will be a lot more competition for the post.
Being Chair, realistically speaking, is a half-time job. If you use your time
well, you can still manage to do some mathematics and keep your scholarly
interests alive. You can go to conferences, enjoy your colleagues as you always
have, and learn new things. Being Dean (or higher) is quite another story.
Those are big jobs, often requiring that you work seven days a week. And
you do not get summers oﬀ. It is really a major change in your life path, and
you should think carefully before you embark down this road.

CHAPTER 7. LIVING YOUR LIFE
7.1
Time Management
The older you get, the more you realize how valuable your time is. Money is
nice, but you’ve probably got enough to get along. Possessions are OK, but
after a while they get tiresome. By contrast, each hour that comes your way
is the only one [in that particular slot] that you will ever get. When you are in
the position of Professor, or perhaps some other mathematical professional,
you will ﬁnd that there are a great many demands on your time—more than
seem reasonable. In today’s world, we are all being asked to do more and
more with fewer resources. The fact of the matter is that you are probably
more than competent to perform any particular one of the tasks that is on
your plate. What is diﬃcult is to ﬁnd the time to do all of them adequately
and to your own (and everyone else’s) satisfaction.
Deﬁnitely the wrong way to go about your work is to begin to think about
Task A and then, after a few minutes, say to yourself, “Oh my God, I’d better
have a look at Task B. And then after staring at B for a while, you jump
to Task C. And so forth. What you are doing here is spending just enough
time with each job to remind yourself what it is, and then tossing it aside
and repeating the exercise with the next job. But you are not actually doing
or accomplishing anything.
The syndrome that I am describing is perhaps best understood with a
particular example. Consider the job of refereeing a paper for a journal. Here
is what most mathematicians do—no fooling! He/she tosses the envelope into
the workpile on the desk. After a time—days, weeks, or perhaps months—
the envelope surfaces. The mathematician picks it up and has a look at it.
He/she reads the title of the paper. Maybe he/she goes further and reads
the Abstract and the statement of the main theorem. And of course he/she
checks the end of the paper to see whether his/her work is cited. Then he/she
says, “I’ll have to get around to refereeing this eventually.” And then throws
it back on the pile. Just what has been accomplished here?
The answer is: absolutely nothing. And the next iteration will be the
same. Likely as not, on the tenth iteration, the mathematician will say, “I’m
never going to get around to refereeing this paper. I should send it back to
the journal.” And then he/she throws it back on the pile. What a complete
waste of time.
First, this scholar has wasted several hours just looking at the paper and
not doing anything. In the end, he/she punted and just sent the paper back.
It is perfectly all right to tell a journal that you have neither the time nor

7.1. TIME MANAGEMENT
231
the expertise to referee the paper that has been sent you, but you should do
so right away, while the envelope is still in your hand. Get the thing oﬀyour
desk! If you are going to referee it, then make that decision right away and
then sit down and do it. It will take you a couple of hours to do a proper
job. But just set aside those couple of hours and get the job done.
And this last illustrates a key point of getting your work completed. On
any given workday (which, presumably, has about eight hours in it), say to
yourself, “Today I’m going to tackle jobs A, B, C. I shall allot 2 hours for the
ﬁrst, 3 hours for the second, and 2 hours for the third. That leaves 1 hour for
slack that you can apply to any of the three tasks that requires extra time.
Of course, if you have some experience in your profession, you will be pretty
good at estimating how long any given task will take. So these 2- and 3-hour
time slots will be meaningful and will get the job done.
What’s great about this method is that, at the end of the day, you can
look back and say, “Today I accomplished these three things.” You can go get
a well-deserved beer, or work out, or go home and be nice to your spouse.
You’ve earned your keep for one more cycle of the sun. The alternative,
to jump around from job to job and not accomplish anything, is both self-
defeating and psychologically debilitating.
Another self-defeating habit, one that we all have, is to spend a good
deal of the day standing around in the hall or sitting in the coﬀee room
and BS-ing about how much work one has to do, or how overworked and
unappreciated one is. One key to success in the academic game, or in any
professional avocation, is to have the Sitzﬂeisch to knuckle down and actually
do the work that needs to be done. Shun all distractions. Get your coﬀee
cup and your pencils in place and do what has to be done. Promise yourself
a nice lunch with friends—after you have put in 3 or 4 hours doing the jobs
that you’ve been assigned to do. Repeat this process in the afternoon. Of
course we all have distractions like teaching and committee meetings. But
the fact is that you probably teach only 6 or 9 hours in a week, and you
can’t possibly have more than 6 to 8 hours of committee meetings in a week
(if you are Chair then this ﬁgure could be higher). That leaves 20 hours or
more to do the other stuﬀ. If you don’t waste that time, you can actually
get quite a lot accomplished.
And it is especially important when you are Chair to use your time wisely.
You could easily spend 20 or more hours per week just listening to your
colleagues kvetching. Of course you should make yourself available. Of course
you should have an open-door policy. But, just as you do with your students,

232
CHAPTER 7. LIVING YOUR LIFE
you should have certain times when you “receive company” and certain other
times when your door is closed and you work. Any Chair should have a
secretary who protects him/her from the great unwashed, and helps him/her
to manage his/her time. It is also your prerogative as Chair to let it be
known that you always spend Tuesday afternoons at home—with the phone
oﬀthe hook if necessary. This can be your time to do research, or read, or
ponder, or whatever it is that you need to do for yourself.
7.2
Publish or Perish
One of the hardest things you will ever do, and also one of the most im-
portant and rewarding, is to develop your own research program, to prove
theorems, and to write papers and publish. In doing so, you will develop
an international reputation, you will receive invitations from all over to give
colloquia, to attend conferences, to be a distinguished visitor, and so forth.
This is really a great life. You get to travel to exotic locales, you will have
friends and colleagues (and, we hope, collaborators) everywhere, and you will
have a professional network that bolsters your activities and increases your
productivity. When, in 1942, Logan Wilson (in his book The Academic Man:
A Study in the Sociology of a Profession [WIL]) coined the phrase “Publish
or perish,” he could hardly have dreamed of what a prescient and meaningful
utterance this was. If you want to advance in the profession, if you want to
establish a reputation, if you want to get tenure, if you want to get a research
grant, if you want to get speaking invitations, if you want to earn the respect
and admiration of your colleagues (and your Dean!), then you had better
publish. The alternative may not be to perish, but you may end up wishing
you had perished.
Having a successful publishing program requires good time management—
you can’t prove theorems and write papers by snatching a 20-minute time
interval here and there. You really need large chunks of time so that you
can internalize all the necessary ideas and really concentrate on your mathe-
matics. Otherwise you will never really get anywhere. The task also requires
considerable tenacity and determination and in fact also a dose of courage.
For in order to put your ideas forth into the scholastic marketplace you must
believe in them, and you must be prepared for criticism and (occasionally)
calumny. Your papers will sometimes be rejected, your grants will sometimes
not be funded, your application to attend a conference (or to get funding to

7.2. PUBLISH OR PERISH
233
attend that conference) will not always be approved. Always remember: It’s
not how many times you fall down; it’s how many times you get up. Man-
aging your time well will put you more in control of things. You will less
frequently be caught by surprise, and you will more often be able to make the
best of the hand you are dealt and move your work and your career ahead.
If you are very senior, and very accomplished, and very independent, and
very original, then you may be able to sit alone in your oﬃce and crank out
great work. There are precious few of us who can actually do this. You need
to see and communicate with other mathematicians. You need to feel the
buzz of mathematics going on around you. You need to go to seminars, watch
other mathematicians do their stuﬀ, hear the words, and talk the talk. That
is why you are in a Math Department or a mathematics research facility.
That is why you have colleagues and students. It really helps a good deal to
be able to share your ideas, to bounce thoughts oﬀof others, to get reactions
to your conjectures and surmises.
There are few among us who can maintain a vigorous research program
for forty years or more. One device, which Steve Smale of Berkeley and Ed
Nelson of Princeton and other key people have pulled oﬀwith success and
aplomb, is to change ﬁelds every several years. This will keep you fresh and
young, and maintain your enthusiasm and your interest. Some people stop
doing research because their ﬁeld drys up. If you are a moving target, then
this cannot happen to you.
When you are fresh out of graduate school, if you are lucky and are one
of those who hits the ground running, then you will enjoy a very fertile and
productive period of ten years or more. You will operating on momentum
from your graduate school experience, ideas from your thesis advisor, youth-
ful vigor, and intensity of purpose. All of these attributes wane with time.
Fields change and even expire. New ideas germinate and blossom and you
cannot keep up with all of them. You will wake up one day and realize that
you are no longer one of the movers and shakers in your ﬁeld. You will have
to reinvent yourself. Not everyone has the resources or the energy or the
opportunities to do this. So, for many people, the research life quiets down
after a time.1 I do not necessarily subscribe to the old saw that mathematics
is a young man’s game; you are by deﬁnition dead when you turn forty.2
1It is diﬀerent in a ﬁeld like literature, for instance. There you spend twenty or thirty
years reading and developing your ideas. You actually get better as you grow older
2Alexandre Grothendieck quit mathematics when he was forty, and so did David Mum-
ford. Each, however, managed to contribute monumental amounts to the subject before

234
CHAPTER 7. LIVING YOUR LIFE
In fact a ﬁfty-year-old mathematician has the advantage of maturity, expe-
rience, and a broad perspective. He/she may have an extensive network of
collaborators and colleagues with whom to discuss ideas. Dan Mostow proved
his great theorem about rigidity of symmetric spaces when he was fairly far
along. Andrew Wiles was 40 years old when he (and Richard Taylor) proved
Fermat’s Last Theorem. There are other examples. So be of stout heart.
But the other message here is that it is not the end of the line just because
your research program is getting quieter. The mathematical life has many
diﬀerent dimensions, and there are lots of interesting things to do. You could
write a book. You could get involved in curricular development. You could
get involved in a national project for the betterment of the profession. A
good general rule is to keep your options open.
Going to tea every day, or as often as you can, is a friendly and salubrious
habit. It will help you to keep up with what is going on in your Department,
and it will also give you a chance for informal discussions about mathematics
or whatever you like. It will give you a sense of the rhythm of the department,
of who is doing what, whose research program is thriving and who else’s is
stuck. It is refreshing and invigorating. After tea you have another one or
two hours—should you care to use them—to get some work done or think
about some theorems or both.
7.3
Tenure and the Like
After I got promoted to Full Professor, the Chair said to me, “Well, now it’s
just a long, slow slide into the grave.” That’s one way to look at it. There
is hardly any more secure and comforting job than a tenured Professorship
at a good institution of higher learning in this country. You can just spend
the next thirty years or so treading water—if that is what you want to do.
Personally I have found it most rewarding, and most invigorating, to
seek to reinvent myself every ﬁve or so years. At least take on some new
projects (a new kind of book, or a new kind of course, or a new position of
responsibility), or buy a new house, or move to a new community. It really
is all too easy to fall into a rut and then just stay there.
Traditionally the purpose of tenure was to free the Professor to pursue
controversial truths, to teach daring ideas, and to invest long periods of
time in his/her research without necessarily producing any results.
As a
shifting interests.

7.3. TENURE AND THE LIKE
235
mathematician, it is unlikely that you will be tempted to teach any ideas
so daring that the public attention will be attracted. You might decide to
devote ten years to trying to prove the Riemann hypothesis, and you might
experience a loss of productivity during that period. But it has been said—
with some justiﬁcation—that the main purpose of tenure today is to protect
you from your colleagues. As we have seen lately with Larry Summers3 at
Harvard or Ward Churchill4 at the University of Colorado, university faculty
can come under ﬁerce attack—to the point of having to resign positions.
Tenure does give you a certain peace of mind, and the cerebral tranquility
to concentrate on big ideas and lofty goals. It gives you the freedom and
discretion to change ﬁelds, or change research direction, or change emphasis
in your line of research. It gives you the time, and the support, and the
resources that you need in order to be a creative individual. Having tenure
is really a privilege, and you should make the most of it.
If you were always worried whether you would have a job next year, or
whether your salary might go abruptly down, it would be hard to concen-
trate on your work. If you do ﬁnd a big, dangerous5 idea that you want to
pursue, tenure will give you the freedom to do it. It can be argued that the
universities pay us half of what we are worth but give us certain perks in
exchange—like tenure and free summers.
In any event, this is the life we choose to live. It is stable and comforting,
and it gives you the opportunity to develop your own ideas and to create a
scholarly life for yourself. It is a good life if you make the most of it.
3Summers was the President of Harvard University. He got in trouble for stating, in a
public speech, that innate diﬀerences between men and women might be one reason fewer
women succeed in science and math careers. Summers also questioned how much of a role
discrimination plays in the dearth of female professors in science and engineering at elite
universities.
4Churchill wrote an essay that argued that American foreign policies provoked the
attacks [on the World Trade Center Towers on 9/11]. He described the people working in
the World Trade Center as “little Eichmanns.”
5In mathematics, for example, it might be dangerous to develop a program to prove
that the Riemann hypothesis is false. Because nobody believes that that is the case. Were
you to do so, you might ﬁnd that granting agencies are not receptive to your ideas. And
that conference organizers do not want to hear what you have to say. And perhaps that
journals do not want to publish your papers. When I was at Penn State I had a colleague
who had a well-developed program to show that the Poincar´e conjecture was false. His
approach was quite original, and at ﬁrst it garnered some attention. After a while people
got tired of hearing it, and he was shunned. Finally some experts sat down with him and
explained why this quest was doomed to failure.

236
CHAPTER 7. LIVING YOUR LIFE
So how do you get tenure? Do you hold your mouth a certain way? Is
there a magic pill that you can take? Is it more a matter of attitude or of
style?
It is safe to say that, among the 2850 institutions of higher learning in this
country, there may be 2850 diﬀerent ways to think about tenure. I work at a
major research university, but it wasn’t very long ago that tenure decisions
there were pretty much decided by a (brief) phone call between the Chair
and the Dean. Today, for legal reasons as well as others, tenure procedures
at various types of institutions are becoming somewhat uniformized. At least
they have many properties in common. We shall describe many of them here,
and also indicate some of the diﬀerences that might come up.
First, most every institution of higher learning has a so-called Tenure
Document. You will not ﬁnd this item widely disseminated around cam-
pus. It is not dropped in bundles from low-ﬂying planes. But it sits in the
Chancellor’s oﬃce and the Dean’s oﬃce and you can get a copy if you need
one. This missive charts out just what tenure means at this institution, how
you get it, and how you can lose it. It is a legal document that holds great
portent for your life. So you would be well to acquaint yourself with it.
One thing that the Tenure Document will say is that a tenure case is
judged on three factors: (i) teaching, (ii) research, and (iii) service. Some-
times there will be a veiled implication that these three factors are weighted
equally. Other times not. I can tell you with some certainty that they are
not weighted equally. They all count, and if you are dreadfully deﬁcient in
one category then you are likely not to get tenure at your institution. But
diﬀerent institutions will weight them diﬀerently.
At a research university—Princeton or Harvard or Berkeley or Chicago or
the like—research is the main thing. Your tenure dossier must demonstrate
beyond any doubt that you have a major research program, supported by
ten to twenty published papers and strong letters of recommendation (about
six to ten) from outside experts, in a particular ﬁeld of mathematics. The
papers should be published in independent, peer-reviewed journals of good
repute. Deans are well aware of the pecking order among journals. A savvy
Dean will know that a paper in the Annals counts a lot more than a paper
in Mathematicae Portugalae. Deans also know (see Section 5.4) that a good
letter of recommendation will have a number of speciﬁc components that
show that you deserve tenure. These will include:
• A reasonably detailed discussion of your research, why it is signiﬁcant,

7.3. TENURE AND THE LIKE
237
how it compares with the research of others at your level.
• Explicit binary comparisons of you (the candidate) with other young
mathematicians at the same level. For example, if one of your letters
says, “Benjamin Disraeli just got tenure at Johns Hopkins and this
candidate is much more talented.”, then that will count for a lot.
• A discussion of your activities in the profession, your collaborations, the
talks you give at conferences, your propensity to communicate mathe-
matics and to work well with others.
A good letter of recommendation will be two to three pages long, and will
be very speciﬁc about your attributes. It will make a very positive and very
explicit recommendation for tenure. It will leave nothing to the imagination.
Your teaching must also be evaluated objectively and in detail. There are
a variety of ways to do this. The Chair might send some professors to your
classes to observe your teaching. They will write a report, detailing your good
points and your not-so-good. The Chair will assess your written teaching
evaluations from students and write a precis of what they say. The head will
poll other faculty to see what they know about your teaching. Sometimes the
Chair will solicit letters from some of your former students. The teaching
aspect of the dossier must be concrete and full of real information about
what you can do and how you do it. It must not sound like a bunch of ﬂuﬀ.
The Dean needs to know that you are someone who will make worthwhile
contributions to the teaching enterprise for the next forty years.
Finally there is your service. This too is taken seriously, but it is not on
the same level of gravitas as the ﬁrst two criteria. There needs to be docu-
mentation that you have served on committees—both at the Departmental
and the University level—and that you have done your homework and ac-
quitted yourself honorably.
If you have volunteered for service activities,
certainly that will reﬂect well on your gestalt as a Departmental citizen. If
you have done undergraduate advising, or directed Ph.D. students, that will
be to your credit.
What you must do, as an Assistant Professor, to earn tenure is to work
hard at all three of these desiderata. As noted previously, diﬀerent schools
will weight these factors diﬀerently. A research institution will count the re-
search at least 75% and the remainder for the other two aspects. A primarily
teaching institution will count teaching about 60%, service about 30%, and

238
CHAPTER 7. LIVING YOUR LIFE
will want to know that you have a research proﬁle but will not be too con-
cerned about the details. A comprehensive school (see [KRA3] for the word
about these schools—which are most of the schools in this country) will have
standards that are somewhere in between.6
As we have said, a front line research institution will write to prominent
professors at Berkeley, Harvard, Paris, G¨ottingen, and elsewhere to get the
straight poop on your research, and how it ranks in the ﬁeld. But if you teach
at Southwest Missouri State then it is unlikely that such an exercise would
be meaningful. You have probably done some research, but you don’t work
in a research department. You have many teaching and service obligations,
and you simply don’t have the time to develop a high-level research program.
And you are not expected to. It would make absolutely no sense for your
Chair to write out to Paris or Harvard and ask for an assessment of your
work. And he/she will not do so. Often tenure cases at teaching schools are
decided primarily in-house. At one pretty good school where a friend of mine
teaches, he was asked simply to ﬁll out a form explaining to the Dean why
he deserved tenure. And he got it!
You yourself have very little control over the tenure process itself. You
may be invited to suggest names of letter-writers, or of people who you would
prefer did not write letters. You may be asked to contribute information
about your teaching or your service. But, for the most part, the spaghetti
factory takes over and processes your tenure case. You simply must wait for
the outcome. And you will be given few if any clues along the way.
7.4
How to Be a Tenured Faculty Member
I must say that, once I got tenure, my view of the world—and of life in
general—changed distinctly. Now I was a vested member of one of the oldest
and most digniﬁed professions on earth.
Now I was set for life.
Now I
could do—at least academically—just whatever I wanted, and for as long
as I wanted, with whatever results I might care to produce. I was now one
of the haves, whereas formerly (as a student and deﬁnitely as an Assistant
Professor) I was deﬁnitely one of the have nots.
That is a selﬁsh rendition of the picture, but nonetheless accurate. There
is also a more charitable side. Now that you are tenured, you have the leisure
6One Math Department at a comprehensive school of my acquaintance recently had a
faculty vote to the eﬀect that teaching will count 50%, scholarship 25%, and service 25%.

7.4. HOW TO BE A TENURED FACULTY MEMBER
239
and perhaps the power and wherewithal to exert some positive change on
your surroundings. How can you make the overall level of teaching in the
Department better? How can you improve the quality of the Mathematics
curriculum?
Can you develop collaborations with your colleagues?
How
can you make the Department a more proactive unit that works eﬀectively
to achieve larger goals (than isolated individuals can achieve)?
How can
you create a dialogue between pure and applied mathematics?
How can
you eﬀect some synergy between Mathematics and Engineering, or between
Mathematics and Physics?
There is no easy answer to any of these questions. If there were then I
would bottle it and sell it. But this is why you have tenure. Now you can
devote some time to one or more of these issues (presumably in collaboration
with a friend and colleague) and really make a diﬀerence.
Another path to take—and this could be a very important one—is to
pick a really big research project and attempt to make some headway on
it. This would be the kind of problem that would be too daunting for an
Assistant Professor—the sort of thing on which you could easily spend six
years and then have nothing to show (which would of course lead to a bad
end for an Assistant Professor). Realistically, you would probably be wisest
to both formulate and attack a goal of this magnitude in collaboration with
a trusted colleague. It is all too easy to choose a project that is far too large
for one person and then to get smothered by it. One of the keys to success
in the academic game is to choose problems that are the right size, that you
can make a dent in, that you can use to establish your reputation. If you
choose, for example, to work on the Riemann Hypothesis then you would be
rather foolish to anticipate that you were actually going to solve it. Every
major number theorist for the past 150 years—and several analysts too—has
banged his/her head against this one. And nobody has come close. But you
can hope to shed some light, to create a new approach, to suggest some new
connections. This is what you must dope out before you actually engage
in your multi-year quest. You can’t just go in blindly and start swinging
your ﬁsts around. It is impossible to succeed at anything unless you know in
advance just what it is you are trying to accomplish.

240
CHAPTER 7. LIVING YOUR LIFE
7.5
What Happens if You Don’t Get Tenure?
Most mathematicians are not cut out to handle failure well. Most of us
have spent our lives being the best and the brightest and the smartest at
everything that we did, and we sailed from one triumph to the next. This
included getting into a great undergraduate institution and a ﬁne graduate
program.
But going up for tenure is a whole diﬀerent ballgame.
Now you are
competing—at least in theory—against all the best young people in your
ﬁeld.
Why should your University tenure you if there is a bright young
guy/gal at Chicago who is better and wants to come? This is the battle of
a lifetime, and the stakes are high. It is like oﬀering to sacriﬁce your Queen
in chess: if it works you win the whole enchillada, but if it fails then you are
cooked.
Getting turned down for tenure is a huge blow, and often it comes un-
expectedly. This is because frequently we are not getting good counsel from
our senior mentors; or it could be because we got the counsel but we didn’t
listen. In the best of all possible worlds, no Assistant Professor would go up
for tenure unless he/she was virtually a sure shot for success. Anything less
and either the Chair or the mentors would just tell the candidate, “Look,
kid. This isn’t going to work. We’ll give you a year to pack your bags, and
you’d better use it to ﬁnd another line of work.” Unfortunately, most Math
Departments don’t have their act together suﬃciently to pull this oﬀ. Usu-
ally, if a candidate wants to go up for tenure, he/she goes up for tenure. And
let the cards fall where they may.
Being turned down for tenure is not necessarily the end of the line. Today
there are four famous Professors at Harvard and Princeton who were turned
down for tenure at their ﬁrst jobs. In three of these cases the failure was
because the candidate could not get along with his senior mentor; in the other
case it was because the candidate could not teach. But these guys fought
on, and they succeeded. They are now all world-class mathematicians. I
myself was turned down for tenure at UCLA. It was not very pretty, but I
was fortunate that a lot of good people stood up for me and helped me to
land on my feet. And the experience made me stronger.
If indeed you are turned down for tenure, then you will want to explore
what your options are. You may be able to get another academic job, but it
will be at a lesser institution. And you can ﬁght your way back up the ladder.
Or you might want to consider a job in industry, or in a research lab at a

7.6. IF TENURE DOESN’T MAKE YOU HAPPY
241
medical school, or with the government. [The Social Security Administration,
just as an instance, employs many mathematicians. The National Aeronau-
tics and Space administration (NASA) employs a number of mathematicians.
The National Security Agency (NSA) employs more Ph.D. mathematicians
than any other company or organization in the world.] It is certainly possible
to work in the private sector for a while and then go back to academics—if
that is what appeals.
I know one mathematician who didn’t get tenure who runs a woodworking
shop now. Another runs a metal machine shop. Yet another crafts wooden
planters and cutting boards. Another has started his own publishing house.
It is a big world out there, and you are a talented person. There are a great
many things that you can do. Being a Professor is nice, but it’s not the only
thing.
7.6
What Happens if You Get Tenure and it
Doesn’t Make You Happy?
There are those of us who will be unhappy no matter where we are or what
we are doing. There are others who always seek new challenges. Still more
will ﬁnd the life of a Professor to be too sedentary and not ﬁlled with enough
challenges.
One of my Ph.D. students got tenure at a pretty good place but quit to
start his own Internet Company. The fact that his wife was unhappy where
they were played a factor here, but it was not the only factor. Another of
my Ph.D. students now develops software in Silicon Valley. He was a very
talented mathematician and could have had a ﬁne academic career. But,
again, personal factors inﬂuenced his thinking.
Three of my former Ph.D. students now work at the National Security
Agency (NSA). One of these had several academic oﬀers, but did not want
to move away from his family. Another just couldn’t get an academic oﬀer.
The third—a very talented teacher and good researcher—decided a priori
that she did not want an academic job. NSA oﬀered a high starting salary
and the opportunity to live in Washington, so she took it. And likes it very
much.
Washington University had a very bright Ph.D. student ﬁnish a couple
of years ago. He wrote a strong thesis, but through bad luck could not get

242
CHAPTER 7. LIVING YOUR LIFE
an academic job. He ended up accepting a position in the ﬁnancial sector in
New York City. His starting salary was close to $200K.
Another friend was virtually a shoo-in for tenure at a very good place,
but he psyched himself out. He convinced himself that anything he worked
on—for a year or two—his thesis advisor could do in ﬁve minutes. So why
should he waste his time banging his head against the wall? He went oﬀ
to start his own publishing house. Yet another friend got a good job, with
tenure, at a ﬁne school in Colorado. She got sick of the academic politics,
and quit to go to work for AT&T. She met her now husband there and is
very happy with her life.
One acquaintance of mine was put up for promotion to full Professor at
his (rather good) institution. He received some negative letters (one of them
from this author), and the case did not go through. He quit his tenured job
so that he could pursue his avocation of playing the guitar. Adult life in this
country consists of making choices—it is probably diﬀerent in Afghanistan—
and if one is lucky he/she makes more good ones than bad ones. Remaining a
tenured professor all your life just may not be for you. It can become boring
and repetitious and, indeed, cloying. Especially living in a small college town
could drive you (or your spouse) bats. The candidate just described almost
certainly could have been promoted next time around—he just needed to
clean up his act a bit. But he is probably much happier doing what he is
doing now.
As you go through graduate school you will be indoctrinated—as we all
are—with the idea that there is only one life worth living and that is to be a
clone of your thesis advisor. That’s an OK way to look at the world, but it is
extremely limited. And it leaves you few choices if the academic life doesn’t
work out. Better is to acquaint yourself with what all the choices are. That
way you can make a more informed decision when the time comes, and do
what is best for you and your family.
7.7
How to Keep Your Teaching Alive and
Vital
I started teaching at the University when I was 23 years old. I was pretty
good at it, but I had a real advantage in being so young. I looked just like a
student, I dressed like a student, and the kids automatically wanted to like

7.7. HOW TO KEEP YOUR TEACHING ALIVE AND VITAL
243
me. They laughed at my jokes, they respected what I had to say, and for the
most part my teaching was successful.
I will say that being a young instructor had its downside. Students ﬁnd
younger faculty to be more approachable, and I certainly experienced an
unreasonable number of tearful episodes over grades and other issues. I was
approached about matters that a more senior faculty member would never
hear about.
Now I am more like an old, dead white guy. The students still like me and
respect me, but they perceive me to be more austere. I never have tearful
episodes over grades anymore. Students do not approach me with outrageous
or unseemly requests. Perhaps this is an improvement. But the ﬂip side of
all this is that I am no longer anything like a student. I don’t talk their talk
and I don’t walk their walk. I haven’t seen the movies they’ve seen, I don’t
listen to the music they listen to. I read books and they don’t. In sum, we
have a lot less in common.
When you are older, it is perhaps a bit harder to connect with the stu-
dents. You would like to have a good rapport with your classes, at it makes
communication that much more eﬀective.
But you are going to have to
try harder to make this happen. The students may not ﬁnd your jokes so
funny anymore. The students may ﬁnd your remarks about campus life to be
crusty and ill-humored. In short—and I am sorry to say this—the students
may think you are a bore.
Some people decide that this is just the nature of life, and they slog
through the teaching experience with ever-diminishing enthusiasm.
They
feel as though they are teaching alien beings, ones with whom meaningful
communication is all but impossible. But they have tenure, they know how
to teach (at least in principle), and they just stand up there and do it.
There are ways to cut through this predicament. I have one friend who
brings the newspaper to class with him each day. He picks out an article
that he thinks will be a touchstone of common interest, and he discusses it
with the class; or makes witty remarks; or asks for their witty remarks. This
turns out to be a great class habit, and the students really look forward to
it. Your class is like your (extended) family, and you can use devices to keep
things lively in your class that are similar to ones you might use around the
dinner table with your kids. Corny, self-deprecating jokes can work wonders.
Especially jokes (or habits) that become like a daily ritual.
One of the more successful teaching heroes these days is Ole Hald of U.
C. Berkeley. He uses the following device with great success. Imagine that

244
CHAPTER 7. LIVING YOUR LIFE
he is teaching the chain rule to a class. The traditional way to do it is to
present the idea and then give ﬁve examples. That will ﬁll up an hour, and it
is a perfectly reasonable way to proceeed. But Ole has a better idea. He does
two examples, and then he has the students do one right there in class. It is
a short example that they can do in a few minutes. He makes quite a ritual
out of it—there are assistants who hand out the examples on little slips of
paper. When the students are ﬁnished with their task, Ole makes sure that
they understand what the right answer is and why. He assesses how many
people got it right. Then he does another example. And he ﬁnishes with the
students doing another example.
What a great idea! The same amount of material is covered, but now
the students are empowered. It is one thing for them to watch you do the
stuﬀ. But then they are likely to go home and—three days later when they
try it—they will have forgotten everything. With Hald’s technique they have
actually conﬁrmed for themselves on the spot that they can do the chain rule.
Ole’s students leave the room in an upbeat frame of mind, convinced that
they have really learned—and begun to master—something new. This is a
real triumph: a simple idea that really works.
If you give some real thought to your teaching—and you should do this
every semester—then you will produce your own devices for getting in touch
with your class. You can present vignettes from the history of mathematics.
You can tell amusing anecdotes about mathematicians (see [KRA6], [KRA7]).
I got one class so that they just loved Norbert Wiener stories.
Students
used to stop me when I walked across campus and beg for a Norbert Wiener
story. You can show the students interesting snippets of mathematics that are
related to but not directly a part of the course. Students should understand
from the get-go that these “will not be on the exam.” They are presented
for everyone’s cultural ediﬁcation, and for just a little diversion.
In the 1960s I was an admirer of David Harris, who was the leader of
the anti-draft movement. A particular quality that he had is that he could
talk to anyone. He could not only pitch the anti-draft philosophy to radical
students; he could also pitch it to farmers, and Methodists, and Chinese
immigrants. He could ﬁgure out where people lived and talk to them in
language that they could understand. This is what you must learn to do. It
is part of teaching eﬀectively and well, part of your craft, and you would do
well to cultivate it.

7.8. PROMOTION THROUGH THE RANKS
245
7.8
Promotion through the Ranks
When I was a graduate student at Princeton and I attended a memorial
service for Steenrod or some other eminent mathematician, I always mar-
veled over the recitation of the person’s career, especially the part where the
speaker said, “He worked his way through the ranks and became a full Pro-
fessor in 1963.” Or something like that. It all sounds so routine. In point of
fact, for many of us, it can be quite an ordeal to get tenure and another ordeal
altogether to be promoted to full Professor. Diﬀerent schools are diﬀerent.
The attitude at Princeton is that once you get tenure you should certainly
be made a full Professor. The sooner the better and let’s be done with it.
At Harvard they have essentially eliminated the rank of Associate Professor.
Their view is that if you are good enough to be tenured at Harvard then you
should be a full Professor. No need to shilly-shally around. Other schools are
much more lockstep in their approach to the matter. At some universities
it is etched in stone that an Associate Professor must wait eight years, or
ten years, or some other pre-determined length of time to be put up for full
Professor. Never mind the merits of the case; everyone else has had to wait
ten years, and this new guy/gal will have to wait ten years also. At other
schools a candidate can be put up for promotion whenever he/she and the
department feel that the case is ready.
At some schools the process of considering a candidate for tenure and the
process of considering a candidate for promotion to Associate Professor are
separate operations. Generally the second comes before the ﬁrst. At most
schools the two elevations take place at the same time. You will learn to deal
with the paradigm that is in place at your institution.
There is a certain delicacy to the matter. If you are put up too soon for
promotion and the Dean slaps you down, then it is demoralizing. And you
will have to wait another three years or more to be put up again. If the
Chair has a good relationship with the Dean then he can get a preliminary
reading on a case and he/she will know whether or not it is going to ﬂy.
Otherwise it is just a good bet.
The Chair makes the best case he/she
can make, and does his/her utmost to push it through the system. When
he/she collects outside letters, they are sometimes disappointing, and do not
support the case that the Chair wants to make. Of course the Chair wants to
be supportive of his faculty. If a particular individual feels passionately that
it is time for him/her to be made a full Professor, then of course the Chair
wants to help. But sometimes the case is just not there. The letters will not

246
CHAPTER 7. LIVING YOUR LIFE
support the claim. The teaching and service are just not up to par. The
publication record is lacking. Then the Chair is faced with the distasteful
task of telling this candidate that he would be wise to wait; it would weaken
the Department and weaken the candidate’s case to put him/her up at this
time. This is one of the tougher aspects of being Chair.
Most every department has certain individuals who have been pegged
as “lifetime Associate Professors”.
These are people whose research pro-
gram has gone into stasis, who are not making any special contributions to
the teaching program or to the curriculum, whose service record is nothing
spectacular. Generally speaking these are good and likeable people. Their
overall contribution to the quality of life is positive rather than negative. But
they simply do not meet the objective criteria for promotion. As a result,
these individuals often feel beaten down, they have the hope of a better life
wrung out of them, they have no expectations for bettering themselves in
this lifetime.
You, as Chair, must deal with these cases. If you can (and this is very
hard), try to work with the individual to strengthen his/her case and ulti-
mately put the person up for promotion. Consult with the Dean and work
with him/her to decide what needs to be done in each instance. Not everyone
is ready to bring a moribund research program back to life. But there are
other useful and worthwhile paths that a scholar may pursue; there are other
kinds of publishing, there is curricular work, there are teaching initiatives.
One Associate Professor at a big state university wrote an important book
and got promoted. Another created an outreach program for high school
students; this had the additional beneﬁt that it attracted more top students
to the institution, and strengthened the Math Major. That was enough for
promotion. Still another Associate Professor (this time at a private school)
became the key person in the Department for the Undergraduate Program,
and served as Vice-Chair of Undergraduate Studies for many years; the Dean
was happy to promote him.
You really show your special talents as an administrator if you can take
a person who has been written oﬀas deadwood and bring him/her back to
life. You can consider that to be one of your real accomplishments as Chair.

7.9. STRIKING A BALANCE
247
7.9
Striking a Balance
We would all like to think of ourselves as hotshot mathematical researchers—
not just now, not just for the ﬁrst several years of our careers, but actually for
the duration. We would like to think that the papers we write when we are
70 years old are just as exciting and vital as the papers that we wrote when
we were 30. Probably this is not the case, and there is external evidence to
prove it: (a) You are not enjoying the speaking engagements that you once
did; (b) You no longer have a research grant; (c) Your presence at important
conferences does not seem to be as essential as it once was; (d) You no longer
have vibrant collaborators clambering to work with you; (e) You no longer
have any graduate students.
Be of stout heart. We all grow older, and as we do we become less a
part of the mainstream. It is nothing to bemoan, for you can develop new
interests. You can make new contributions. You can garner new friends.
Unfortunately mathematicians often are not built this way.
We are
trained from the get-go to be excellent, to be at the top of our ﬁelds, to
be on the cutting edge. We have spent our entire lives being the best at
what we do, and being praised for it. But it is the ordinary course of things
that the young geniuses of today become the senior mentors of tomorrow, and
new young geniuses take their place. There are an exceptional few among us
who really do maintain the old ﬁre-in-the-guts well into their 70s. But for
most of us some adjustments are in order.
As you move into your 50s, it will start to seem reasonable to serve a
term as Chair, and you should consider the option seriously. Or at least
serve as Vice-Chair for Graduate Studies. Some universities have rotating
Dean-ships: the term is three years and then you are out. This is to give a
variety of faculty the experience of being an Administrator, and also to keep
the position fresh with a ﬂow of new blood and new ideas. That may be
something that you wish to try.
Some senior mathematicians that I know keep their hand in with research,
but give the bulk of their time to developing fruitful relationships with local
high schools. Especially when people have kids in school, they develop a
particular passion for the quality of public education. The Math Wars in
California (see the essay by David Klein in [KRA1]) were largely fueled by
Stanford and Berkeley Math Professors. The long-running brouhaha over the
NCTM (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) Standards for Math
Education was largely fought by college and university faculty. And these

248
CHAPTER 7. LIVING YOUR LIFE
are not minor dalliances. They are fundamental public issues that aﬀect all
of society.
I have one friend, formerly an outstanding geometer, who now devotes all
his time to teacher training. He runs workshops every summer to bring high
school Math teachers up to speed in geometry and other key subjects. I have
another who has become the go-to person for school textbooks. There are
so many innovative and unusual approaches these days, such as the CORE
PLUS textbook series, that it is good to have someone who has read all
the books and can compare them critically. This particular individual is a
member of the National Academy of Sciencs and a very distinguished math-
ematician. But it is worth his time to study the textbook scene and consult
for people across the country.
It is a big, complicated world out there, and there are many useful and
exciting things that we can contribute. There comes a point where your heart
may not be in proving a new theorem. Be aware that there are a number of
alternatives.
7.10
How to Know When You are Done for
the Day
Reviewing what was said earlier, if you can manage your time well then, at
the beginning of each day, you will set realistic goals for yourself. And at
the end of the day you will have achieved them. As a result, you will feel
that you have done an honest day’s work and you can go home and relax.
This might mean taking your spouse or partner out to dinner, or going to a
concert, or watching a movie, or reading a book. It could also mean reading
some mathematics that is not directly related to anything that is sizzling
on your plate right now, or browsing the Web for new ideas. It could mean
planning a hiking trip for the coming weekend or setting up lunch with a
friend. It does not have to mean hardcore mathematics, and you are no less
of a mathematician for not spending every waking hour at the altar making
burnt oﬀerings.
If you put in four or ﬁve hours a day actually doing intense mathematical
research, and another ﬁve hours dancing around the ﬁre, then you have done
more than it is reasonable to oﬀer to this goddess, and more than will produce
good eﬀect. John E. Littlewood always made a point of taking Sunday oﬀ.

7.11. MANAGING YOUR LIFE
249
He would take a hike, or spend time with family, or do something to relax
his cranium. He always found then that on Monday he had a good idea.
Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned here. Littlewood wrote more than
a hundred papers with Hardy, and his total production over a lifetime was
awesome. But he still took Sundays oﬀ.
All of this comes down once again to time management. If you use your
time well then you will feel at the end of each day that you have done
something worthwhile, that you have actually accomplished something. You
will not feel as though you have to sweat the night away in some neurotic
angst. You can begin the next day fresh and ready for new challenges. That
is the way it should be. Being a mathematician does not have to be akin
to being a tormented artiste. You can actually be like everyone else—just a
little more inspired and perhaps a little more driven.
7.11
Managing Your Life
I know mathematicians—good ones—who sit in their oﬃces from 8:00am to
5:00pm each day, go home and have dinner with their families, and then go
back to the oﬃce for a few (or sometimes several) more hours. I frankly don’t
understand the point of this habit. There is no evidence that these people
are any more productive than anyone else. And surely they have a workspace
at the house. Why can’t they work at home, surrounded by their families,
in the evenings? I would think it would put a strain on any relationship to
have a partner who is married to his/her job to such a degree. And I repeat:
where is the evidence that this leads to greater productivity?
You need to strike a balance between your professional life and your
personal life. One of the reasons that personal relationships in Hollywood
are so unstable is that people are simply unable to diﬀerentiate between
their public persona and their private persona. It is your responsibility to
diﬀerentiate between your gestalt as a mathematician and your gestalt as a
person. You owe something to your profession, but you also owe something
to your spouse or partner. And of course to your children. I was talking to
a mathematician a while ago about why he got divorced. His answer was,
“Early on in the marriage I told my wife my priorities: number one was

into fourth place.” Well, this was an honest evaluation of his life, and it led
to a predictable outcome. If you go back to the oﬃce each night after dinner
then perhaps you are sending your spouse or partner a similar signal.
As I have said elsewhere in this book, if you can put in a good piece of
time on mathematics each day, then you will be a productive and successful
mathematician. No doubt about it. Spending twenty hours a day playing
at being a mathematician will not make you any better, and certainly not
make you any more successful. A little self-knowledge will take you a long
way here. Decide what is important in your life and act on that insight. You
will be a happier person as a result.

Glossary
As with any sophisticated professional activity, being a math-
ematician carries with it a certain amount of verbal baggage.
There are all sorts of terms that we commonly bandy about that
would mystify the average layman. And, if you are new to this
business, they may mystify you as well. So we include most of
them here for your delectation. Deﬁnitions are the author’s own,
and the reader may ﬁnd variants in the literature.
A.B.D.
Abbreviation for “all but dissertation” (also called “A.B.T.”, or
“all but thesis”). The phrase describes a student who has completed all parts
of the Ph.D. program except for the dissertation. At many schools, “A.B.D.”
is an oﬃcial status, and you ﬁll out some paperwork to ratify the fact that
you have done everything but the dissertation.
There are a great many
students who leave graduate school at the A.B.D. stage and never complete
the degree.

Society in recognition of excellent work in algebra.
college major
At most colleges and universities, an undergraduate will
have a ﬁeld of concentration. Thus the student will take a certain number of
courses of general study—just to ensure some background in the humanities
and the arts and the social sciences and laboratory science—before picking
a particular subject area in which to concentrate. The student will typically
take 20 class hours or more in the major subject area.
college minor
In addition to a college major, an undergraduate student
today will often have a second ﬁeld of concentration called a “minor”. This
will be a subject, perhaps related to the major area, in which the student
will take several courses and perhaps even write an undergraduate thesis.
colloquium
A formal lecture, usually given by a member of another de-
partment and often by a professor from another university, that is given for
the beneﬁt of the entire math department. The lecture is usually preceded
by a ceremonial tea, and there is often a celebratory dinner and even a party
afterward.
comprehensive university
These institutions started out as the “normal
schools”, that is, schools that were dedicated to teacher training. Seventy-
ﬁve years ago there were hundreds of these throughout the country. Today
most of these institutions have changed their names, and in some cases,

teaching
Teaching students—especially undergraduates—is the way that
college and university faculty justify their existence to the public and to the
administration. This is the one faculty activity that everyone understands.
Teaching Assistant (TA)
A graduate student who assists in the teaching
of university classes.
This is usually done as part of the arrangement to
justify the ﬁnancial support of a graduate student.
teaching evaluation
Traditionally these are paper surveys that are dis-
tributed to students in a class near the end of the semester to assess the
eﬀectiveness of the teaching. These are collected by a student and turned
into the Math Department oﬃce so that the Professor cannot see them until
after the semester is completed. Today teaching evaluations are sometimes
done OnLine.
teaching load
The number of courses per semester, or per year, that
you are required to teach. Mathematicians frequently describe their teaching
load as “3-and-2”—meaning that they teach three courses in one semester
and two course in the other. Sometimes people will describe their teaching
load in terms of the number of contact hours.
tenure
This is a form of job security that is special to academic life. A
tenured faculty member is very diﬃcult to terminate. Typical grounds for

7.11. MANAGING YOUR LIFE
265
termination of tenure are (a) moral turpitude, (b) ﬁscal indiscretions, (c)
academic fraud. Tenure was originally created so that faculty could pursue
daring or controversial courses of study, or teach “dangerous” ideas in class.
tenure clock
Every Assistant Professor, by the rules of the American
Association of University Professors, must be considered for tenure before
seven years of his/her contract expire. Thus every Assistant Professor is on
a tenure clock. When a person accepts a job as an Assistant Professor, there
is some negotiation as to how the tenure clock will be initially set. Sometimes
the new Assistant Professor gets credit for time served elsewhere, sometimes
not.
Tenure Document
Every college or university has a document called the
Tenure Document which lays out (i) what tenure is, (ii) how you get tenure,
and (iii) how you can lose tenure. It is not clear to anyone what the legal
status of the Tenure Document is, but in the context of the university it
deﬁnes how things work. All tenure decisions are based on this document.
All cases of adjudication of tenure are based on this document. Although it
is not widely disseminated, it is readily available to all faculty.
tenure dossier
The collection of materials, including teaching evaluations,
outside review letters, information about service, a publication list, and other
information that pertains to a tenure case.
tenure, loss of
It is quite diﬃcult to lose tenure, but ﬁscal malfeasance,
sexual misconduct, or failure to teach are some of the reasons that this can
come about. There are strict and detailed procedures, outlined in the Tenure
