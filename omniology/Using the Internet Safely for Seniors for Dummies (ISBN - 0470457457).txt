T
he Internet seems to have become an inte-
gral part of our lives in the blink of an eye,
and in a sense, that’s true. It’s been only about
20 years or so since its beginnings, and now
many people couldn’t live without it. We use it
to check news stories, watch movies, balance
bank accounts, buy any number of things, and
communicate with others.
If you realize that you can’t avoid using the
Internet, but you worry about some of the risks
it harbors, this book will help you understand
what’s going on out there, help you acquire
skills that can keep you safer, and show you
how to enjoy your online time with greater
peace of mind.
About This Book
This book is specifically written for mature
people like you, folks who are relatively new to
using a computer and want to discover how to
use the Internet safely. In writing this book,
we’ve tried to take into account the types of
activities that might interest a senior citizen
who’s either discovering computers for the first
time or discovering how to use them more
safely.
Foolish Assumptions
This book is organized by sets of sections and
tasks. These sections and tasks start from the
very beginning, assuming you know little
about computers and online safety, and they 
Conventions used in this book 
This book uses certain conventions to help you find your
way around, including the following:
➟When you have to type something in a text box, we
put it in bold type. When you have to take action, such
as clicking a button or link, we put the name of the
item you have to act upon in bold type. Whenever we
mention a Web site address, we put it in another font,
like this.
➟When we introduce a term that you might not be famil-
iar with, the term appears in italics, followed by a
plain-English definition of the term.
➟For menu commands, we use the ➪ symbol to sepa-
rate menu choices. For example, you might see this
instruction: Choose Tools➪Internet Options. The ➪
symbol is just our way of saying “Open the Tools menu
and then click Internet Options.”
➟Callouts for figures draw your attention to an action
you need to perform. In some cases, points of interest
in a figure might be identified. The text tells you what
to look for, the callout makes it easy to find.
Tip icons point out insights or helpful sugges-
tions related to tasks in the step list.
Warning icons indicate online behaviors that
might put you, your information, your loved
ones, or your pocket book in jeopardy.
➟
Introduction

guide you through, from the most basic steps in easy-to-understand
language. Because we assume you’re new to computers, the book pro-
vides explanations or definitions of technical terms to help you out.
All computers are run by software called operating systems, such as
Windows. Because Microsoft Windows–based personal computers
(PCs) are the most common type, the book focuses mostly on
Windows functionality. Specifically, we use Windows Vista and Internet
Explorer in most of our examples. But rest assured that the majority of
the advice in this book about staying safe online works no matter
whether you use a Mac, a Windows-based PC, or a Linux machine.
Why You Need This Book
You’ve probably decided it’s time to go online to take advantage of all
the Internet has to offer, but you hesitate to take the plunge because
you hear all these stories about predators, scams, and spam. Well, here’s
a shocker: Even if you’ve never gone online, your information is out
there from a variety of sources, and you are at risk. By going online and
doing so safely, you may be able to mitigate your risk while learning
your way around. You may also discover how to help protect your fam-
ily online.
With the simple step-by-step approach of this book, you can get up to
speed with the Internet and learn the ins and outs of smart, defensive
computing.
You can work through this book from beginning to end, or you can
simply open up a chapter to solve a problem or help you learn a new
skill whenever you need it. The steps or bulleted lists in each section get
you where you want to go quickly, without a lot of technical explana-
tion. In no time, you’ll start picking up the skills you need to become a
safer Internet user.

Using the Internet Safely For Seniors For Dummies

How This Book Is Organized
This book is conveniently divided into several handy parts to help you
find what you need.
➟Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely:
This part helps you understand what’s going on out
there that puts Internet users at risk, including the
predators’ activities, e-mail scams, ID theft, and more.
You find out how the financial model online makes
information about you — your interests, location,
shopping habits, and more — into a very valuable
commodity. Chapter 3 helps you get much safer right
away by modifying some typical risky behavior
quickly and easily.
➟Part II: Use the Internet While Dodging the Risk: In
these chapters, you begin to explore the Internet,
starting with the basics of navigating with an Internet
browser, such as Internet Explorer. You discover the
ins and outs of safe e-mailing, how to post photos
and videos safely, and how to protect your personal
information online.
After you have the basics about getting around and
posting safely, you get to explore the fun side of the
Internet, safely. These chapters cover the world of
social networking and blogging, online games, virtual
worlds, and entertainment, and how you and your
grandkids can have fun online together.
➟Part III: Your Wealth and Your Health: The Internet
isn’t all games and videos. You can use your computer
to shop, manage your money, and get advice about
your health. Of course, the trick is to do all these
things without putting yourself at risk, and that’s
what the chapters in this part help you do.
➟
3
Introduction

➟Part IV: Being Proactive: Besides modifying your
behavior online, you can use technology tools to
block computer viruses and spyware and push back
on companies and the government to work to make
you safer. The two chapters in this part give you the
tools you need to protect your computer, report
abuse, and make a difference in making the Internet
safer for us all.
➟Glossary: The Glossary is your place for quickly find-
ing the meaning of common Internet and safety
terms.
Get Going!
Whether you’re somewhat computer savvy but need to find out how to
be safer online or you’re just starting to use the Internet, working your
way through this book will help you become even savvier than your
grandchildren or the kid next door.
Think of that!

The Foundation of
Using the Internet
Safely


Understand
What’s Going 
On Out There
T
hroughout this book, we point out again
and again what a great tool the Internet is.
Why? Because you hear a lot of hype about
what a dangerous place the Internet is, and
that hype sometimes causes people to miss out
on a wealth of information, entertainment,
communication, and opportunity.
Do Internet risks exist? Yes, just as risk exists
every time you step out your front door, climb
behind the wheel, or cross a street. But you
haven’t stayed in your house your entire life;
you’ve learned how to stay relatively safe while
exploring the world all these years.
You can stay just as safe online. First, you need
a basic understanding of how Internet risks
occur so that you can place any Internet safety
advice in context. Once you know the nature
of online risks, you can then begin to acquire
skills to stay safer.
This chapter explores the landscape of risk
online; in the process, we show you which
risks are real and which are largely myth, look
at the financial model that drives the Internet
and the factors that allow abuses to occur, and
show you how your own behavior can some-
times put you in harm’s way.

Congratulations: You’re the Most 
Sought-After Generation Online
With millions of seniors going online and expanding their Internet
activities, service providers see folks over 50 as a critical new target
audience (see Figure 1-1 from AARP) . . . and so do online criminals.
Every age group has unique vulnerabilities in addition to general
Internet risks, and seniors are no exception. Few entirely new types of
crime are created to target seniors; instead, existing crimes are tailored
specifically to exploit older Internet users.
For example, while an online scam targeting minors promises trips to
Disneyland or cool toys, scams aimed at seniors are more likely to
offer discount medications and low-cost insurance. Phishing scams are
e-mails that frequently target seniors with fake bank notices or official-
looking fake government documents.
Figure 1-1
➟

Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

In addition to being targeted for different types of crime, seniors may
share characteristics that make them especially vulnerable online. Here
are some of the major factors that make seniors vulnerable:
➟Lack of computer skills. Although many seniors are
very computer savvy, many more aren’t. They may
not understand technologies such as firewalls and
anti-spyware that they can use to protect their data.
➟Lack of Internet skills. Though many seniors are 
cutting-edge users of Internet services, most are
beginners when it comes to interacting with others
and doing business online. You have a wealth of
experience in judging the character of people you
meet in person, but you have probably developed
fewer skills for assessing the character of the people
and companies you meet online.
Lack of exposure to technology can make you more
vulnerable. Understanding how content you place
online (an activity called posting) might be misused,
how criminals try to deceive you, or how to deter-
mine the trustworthiness of a site, for example, actu-
ally has little to do with how well you can use a
computer. See the section “It’s Not Always about
Technology, It’s Often about Behavior,” later in this
chapter, for more about this key concept.
➟More trusting. Seniors are typically more trusting
and respectful of official-looking material than
younger generations, so seniors are more apt to fall
for scams. And you’re more worried about notices
that claim that there’s a problem with your informa-
tion that might somehow sully your good name or
threaten your life savings.
➟

Chapter 1: Understand What’s Going On Out There

Roads Have Rules, The Internet Doesn’t
The Internet began as a tool for university researchers to share informa-
tion. When it took off with the general public, nobody was in charge,
nobody owned the Internet, and no rules governed what you could
and couldn’t do online. Today, this is largely unchanged.
In addition, because of its global nature, the Internet lets us all cross
borders — for good, and for bad. Some governments have regulations
about Internet use. But with an international population using the
Internet, it’s hard to enforce the laws of a single country — and it’s easy
for people to fly under government radar. For example, in the United
States, gambling online can be illegal, yet the casino in Figure 1-2
actively solicits U.S. customers.
Figure 1-2
➟

Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

In essence, we have a very sophisticated and powerful tool existing
within a frontier culture — something akin to giving Jesse James and
his gang laser guns. The current state of affairs is the result of a lot
more than bad guys armed with technology. In fact, six factors con-
tribute to the current online situation:
➟Lack of knowledge. Consumers of every age and at
every level of technical expertise lack broad online
safety education. This lack of knowledge isn’t limited
to seniors, but extends to the general population,
including computer specialists who may not know any
more than others about online predatory behavior.
➟Carelessness. Even when we know better, we make
mistakes. Usually, we make those mistakes when
we’re tired, rushed, or don’t have a complete under-
standing of the risks involved. This is especially true
when we see no obvious cause and effect to help us
correct our behavior. When you post information
and a month later criminals use that information to
rob your home, you aren’t likely to recognize a con-
nection between the two events. In fact, the vast
majority of victims of online crime never recognize
that an action they or someone else took online
made them vulnerable to a criminal act.
➟Unintentional exposure of (or by) others. It may be
a grandchild, friend, employer, or volunteer organiza-
tion that provides publicly accessible information
that exposes you. Perhaps your own computer (or
mobile phone, or other connected device) has been
compromised with spyware that enables criminals to
collect your personal information. Maybe when a
friend’s computer or other Internet-enabled device
was lost or stolen, your information fell into the
wrong hands.
➟

Chapter 1: Understand What’s Going On Out There

➟Technology flaws. Online products and services can
expose consumers — either because the companies
that offer them fail to secure their customers’ data
and are hacked, or because a company fails to build
adequate safeguards and safety messaging into their
product to protect consumers.
➟Holes in consumer protection standards. Right
now, most of the burden of online safety is on con-
sumers. Because of the rapid growth of the Internet,
governments have not yet been able to create a full
set of standards and laws.
➟Criminal acts. Placing the word cyber in front of 
-criminal, -thief, -robber, -molester, or -predator only
changes the criminal’s tools, not his motivations or
goals. Criminals still want to steal your money, domi-
nate or abuse, or destroy property. The Internet didn’t
create crime, and sadly, it won’t abolish it. But it does
offer some powerful tools for criminals to take
advantage of.
The first five issues in this equation create an environment in which
criminal and malicious acts can flourish. What’s new is that the
Internet gives criminals broader access to more people and informa-
tion than ever before. Predators are generally equal-opportunity
offenders, happy to target victims of any age. Young people represent
only one segment; adults and seniors are equally at risk, although the
motivation for exploitation of older consumers is more often for finan-
cial gain than for emotional or sexual gratification.
Online Anonymity
Although you may think you are anonymous online, you may not be.
Online companies may have exposed you. For example, some e-mail
programs display your full name in every e-mail you send, even if you’ve
come up with a clever e-mail alias. If you join a social networking site
➟
12
Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

such as MySpace or Eons (a senior-focused site), your publicly viewable
profile might give away your name, location, and gender (see Figure
1-3), even if you set your page to private.
Though you may not be as anonymous online as you think, criminals
are very good at staying anonymous or pretending to be someone or
something they aren’t. Offline, no one can build a fake bank or store
on some street corner for a few days, so you don’t have to worry about
whether the bank or store is real. When you enter, you quickly get a
sense of whether it’s a reputable business. If you have a problem with a
purchase, you can march right back through the door and demand
service.

On the Web, those physical attributes and clues are all gone. Anyone
can build a Web site that looks official and legitimate for very little
money. They can trick search engines to make their Web sites show up
as one of the first results when someone runs a search. Anyone can
copy the look and content of any other Web site. This means that 
the fakes are sometimes very, very hard to identify, no matter what
your age.
It’s Not Always about Technology; 
It’s Often about Behavior
Ironically, people who are computer savvy are sometimes more at risk
online because they believe that being computer savvy means they are
Internet savvy. In reality, Internet safety is often more a matter of
understanding human behavior than understanding technology.
Think about your average phishing scam. This particular form of e-mail
spam appears to come from your bank, investment company, or
another site where you do financial transactions. (See Figure 1-4.) The
e-mail will claim some “reason” why they need to verify your account
number or password or credit card, Social Security Number, and so on
(or all of the above!). The e-mail looks official, and it provides links
for you to visit their site and verify your identity. But the site is as
fraudulent as the e-mail and any information you provide is in the
hands of financial predators. These e-mails may even display a promi-
nent safety and privacy message meant to help convince you that the
site is legitimate. However careful study of the message reveals several
red flags once you know what to look for (see Figure 1-5).
Technology makes it possible for somebody to make a scam e-mail
look authentic right down to using the legitimate company’s logo, and
send it to you. But what’s putting you at risk isn’t technology, it’s the
danger that you’ll fall for the bait — hook, line, and sinker. If you’re
savvy, you’ll know that the link to the site might take you to a mocked-
up site that may look like your bank, but it isn’t. Be suspicious of any
e-mail that wants your bank account number or other sensitive infor-
mation. Don’t click on links! Instead, look up your bank’s phone num-
ber (don’t call the number provided in the e-mail, which could also be
false), call, and report the scam.

Hit or Myth: Online Information Exposure
Having your information exposed online is one of the greatest risks
you face, but seniors generally buy into a few myths about how their
information is exposed online.
The first myth is that if you don’t use a computer or go online, you
aren’t exposed online. False. Just because you didn’t put information
online doesn’t mean it isn’t there — virtually everyone has information
online.
Here are a few examples:
➟Publicly available government records show if you
own a home, vote, have a criminal record (or speed-
ing ticket), and much more.
➟Your location (including photos in most cases) is
listed online through any Internet mapping service
like the one shown in Figure 1-6.
➟Unless you’ve been very careful to ensure your phone
number isn’t in any phone book, or taken care to
have never entered it in a sweepstakes or other con-
test, it’s online. Even if you have been careful, you
should check to see. Type your home phone number
(with area code and hyphens) into any search engine
and see if it brings back your information — chances
are that it will.
➟If you donate to a charity without doing so anony-
mously, the charity’s Web site probably lists you as a
donor as a way to thank you.
➟If you volunteer with an organization, belong to a
church group, sports group, action committee, and so
on, chances are you are listed on its Web site.
➟
16
Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

Figure 1-6
➟If your grandchild has a blog (an online journal), or
has registered for her wedding or a new baby, your
name, location, and other information may appear
there.
➟If a relative enjoys genealogy, you and your relatives’
names, birth dates, wedding dates, death dates, 
locations, and more may be posted on a genealogy
site.
The second myth is that if you haven’t fallen for an Internet scam, 
you won’t be the victim of an Internet crime. The truth is that you 
may never know what the Internet connection is (or even if there was
one) in most crimes. For example, online public records may give a
criminal the information and means to rob your home or steal your
identity.
The third myth is that only people you know are going to look at the
information you post online. Everything on the Internet is copied and
indexed — constantly. Even if you take your information off the
Internet, a copy of it may still be out there, although you can reduce
exposure by removing personally identifiable information from any-
thing you or family members post online.
➟

Keep Your Information Private
Sharing personal information with the wrong people is one of your
biggest risks online. Before you provide personal information, be sure
you’re comfortable with how it will be handled. Table 1-1 lists some
common pieces of personal information, along with the risk of expos-
ing this data online.

additional family members to ID theft, fraud, or 
personal harm.
Information about your car, 
Can lead to car theft, insurance fraud, and access to

VIN (vehicle identification number); 
registration information; insurance 
carrier; loan information; and 
driver’s license number
Information about work history 
Helps criminals take over your identity and gain more 
and credit status
access to your financial records.
Social security numbers
Enables ID theft, fraud, and access to additional 
information about you.
How Information Accumulates
Every detail you share online about your life and the extended group
of people you interact with is stored somewhere. Understanding the
way this information accumulates is critical.
➟
18
Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

Many people are very casual about giving out personal information
online because they fail to fully understand the ramifications of doing
so. Think of each piece of information as a drop of water. Today, each
drop of information posted online is collected into personal virtual
buckets. The information rarely disappears; rather, it accumulates,
slowly building a comprehensive picture of your identity and life.
Small details about your appearance, where you live and work, 
where you went to school, your financial status, emotional vulner-
abilities, and the lives of those close to you all add up in a smart
predator’s mind.
People post resumes that include hobbies, past employers, past
addresses, and professional associations. People post highly personal
and identifiable information in online journals called blogs. On travel
sites, you may reveal your excitement about an upcoming trip. Perhaps
you are exposing friends and family’s e-mail addresses by forwarding
e-mails. (See Figure 1-7.)
Figure 1-7
The good news is that you can begin to control the information you
expose about yourself, and even ask friends and family members to
limit how they expose you. Just keep in mind that you, your friends,
and family aren’t the only ones sharing information, so remember to
Exposed e-mail addresses
➟
19
Chapter 1: Understand What’s Going On Out There

periodically search the Web for information and then, if you find
something you don’t want shared, ask the site owner to remove the
information:
➟Employers need to consider the level of informa-
tion they share about current and former employ-
ees. Consider carefully what information is
appropriate to include in an employee bio that is
posted on your company Web site. How much
should be visible to other employees on your
intranet (your internal company “Internet”)? When
you attend a conference, is the attendee list shown in
online conference documents? Teach employees to be
careful about the information they leave in out-of-
office messages; saying ‘taking the grandkids to
Disneyland’ also says ‘our home will be empty’ and
potentially makes them a target for burglary.
➟Organizations should be cautious about exposing
volunteer information on their Web sites if the
general public can view those sites. Posting photos
and identifying volunteers or staff by last name can
place people in harm’s way. Posting schedules of club
activities along with information about what activi-
ties an individual participates in provides a criminal
with the physical location and time where he can
find that person.
Consider who can see your information before you
post it. It is your choice how much personal informa-
tion you post online in publicly viewable sites, how
much you share on private sites, and what you
choose not to share online at all. Schools and compa-
nies can restrict access to parts of their sites to make
information available to those who need it, but not
to anyone outside of your organization. See Chapter
8 for more about social networking site settings.
➟
20
Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

Online Information Is Forever
One of the reasons information exposed online puts you at such great
risk is because, once it’s out there, it stays out there. Comments,
actions, or images posted online may stay online long after you delete
the material from your site or request that a friend delete your infor-
mation from his or her site. You won’t know who else has downloaded
what you wrote or what search engine crawled (automatically searched
the Internet) and stored a photo. You can’t know who else sees your
comments and judges you by them, nor will you have the opportunity,
in most cases, to explain. (See Chapter 7 for more about sharing infor-
mation safely online).
Another aspect of information permanence is the difficulty it presents
when you want to distance yourself from something in your past or go
in new directions. Perhaps you no longer want to be associated with an
old relationship, but the information remains online to haunt you and
for anybody to come across. 
Anyone — with good intentions, as well as those with intent to do
harm — can dip into your public virtual bucket and search for your
information years from now. It may be the new pastor at your church,
a potential employer, a new friend, or your grandchildren who discover
something you’d rather keep private. Or it could be an identity thief,
any other kind of predator, or anyone in your life who wants to lash
out at you to cause harm.
What seems like a good idea at the time may come back to bite you in
a variety of ways, so think before you post. It’s far easier to think twice
and refrain from posting than it is to try to take it back. By doing so,
you can control your information exposure and privacy while staying
safer online.

f you want to avoid a pickpocket in a
crowded marketplace, it helps to know that
the world has such things as pickpockets, that
they hang out in crowded marketplaces, that
they use certain tactics, and that they want to
steal money and other valuables from you
(hence, you know which pocket to protect).
The online analogy (you knew there’d be one)
is that you have to understand what types of
activities go on online, what you have that has
value, who wants it, and how companies and
individuals use what they take. We explore
these things in this chapter, and when you
understand them, you’re much better able to
traverse the online world with your finances,
privacy, and reputation intact.
Understand the Online 
Financial Model
In the early days of the consumer-based Internet
(about 1995 or so), some Web companies set
about selling subscriptions to their sites. You
would pay $29.95 a year to subscribe to AOL,
for example, for which you got an Internet con-
nection and this large portal of news, an e-mail
account, access to chat rooms, and so on.

Chapter

At some point, right around the .com crash in the late 1990s, Web
companies realized that most people weren’t really willing to pay for
services. That’s when everybody’s high-tech stocks took a dive and
many online services and sites essentially became free. Browse the Web
today and you’ll find free e-mail accounts, free news, free mortgage cal-
culators, free recipes, and on and on (see Figure 2-1).
Figure 2-1
This begs the question, how do these companies make money? Ask
most people how free online services and sites make money, and they’ll
answer in one word: advertising.
In reality, the primary way most free services tend to make money isn’t
by selling advertising space to other companies. What they sell, depend-
ing on their terms and conditions, is access to you and your information to
advertisers, marketers, researchers, and others who want your informa-
tion for a wide variety of ethical, unethical, or entirely illegal purposes.
➟
24
Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

In fact, you’re still paying for these services, but what’s changed is the
currency — you no longer pay in dollars; instead, you pay in loss of 
privacy.
As you provide information online, it’s important that you consider
which parts are sold, bought, or simply taken, and you should under-
stand how that information may be used to create potential outcomes.
Then you can select your comfort level and act accordingly.
What Information Do Others Want, and Why?
Just about every piece of information about you has value: which soft
drink you buy, what kind of car you drive, your income bracket, your
medical information, your musical tastes, and even what kind of mood
you’re in today.
Some of this information is useful for
➟Making the service better for you.
➟Selling you products or services.
➟Scoping out the user demographics of sites, again with
the goal of designing and targeting products or serv-
ices more successfully to consumers. (See Figure 2-2.)
➟Employers or insurers who want to check your back-
ground or search your medical history, for example.
They may search (or hire a company to search) for
your information, unbeknownst to you.
Some people feel that more targeted advertising simply makes sense —
you avoid seeing ads for things that are useless or even offensive to you.
However, there’s also the seedy side of the Internet, which includes
criminals who compile catalogs of information about people who just
bought expensive electronics. They can sell this information to thieves.
➟
25
Chapter 2: How the Internet Views You

Figure 2-2
Information about you and your Internet-connected
devices is collected from a variety of sources. Some is
information that you’ve posted to sites, some comes
from other people who know you, and some is placed
online by companies, organizations, and the govern-
ment. See Chapter 7 for more about protecting your
information online and understanding how others
may expose you.
How Posted Information May Be Used against You
Every piece of information you or others post about you and every
action you take online has commercial value to someone. That isn’t
necessarily a bad thing, if it simply helps companies target your inter-
ests and preferences, but your information may be used in negative and
sometimes criminal ways. For example, it might be used by
➟
26
Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

➟Someone who wants to embarrass or bully you.
➟Plagiarists who want to claim your content as 
their own.
➟Criminal organizations or individuals building profiles
of people to scam, steal identities from, hijack comput-
ers, find interesting homes to break into or cars to
steal, target people to physically harm, and so on.
➟Companies who want to use your information in
ways that act against your interests. Consider these
examples:
• Insurance companies may use information posted
on blogs to deny coverage of medical claims, car
accident claims, and so on.
• A potential employer may reject your job applica-
tion based on information about you online. Or
your current employer may find reasons to fire you.
Set Boundaries for Information Exposure
Where you set your own boundaries for information exposure is an
entirely personal choice, but here’s a quick overview of what you should
consider in making your choices. If a site requires personal information,
you should recognize the differences in these types of data:
➟Information that an organization has to collect
before you can use its Web site: Many services have
to collect some information from you in order for
them to interact with you. Online shopping Web sites,
for instance, need to have your name and address,
among other data, for financial transactions. (See
Figure 2-3.) They need to know certain things about
your computer, such as your IP address (this stands for
Internet protocol, which is a unique identifier assigned ➟
27
Chapter 2: How the Internet Views You

to devices, such as your computer, that connect with
the Internet) to route information to and from you.
They check which Internet browser you use (such as
Internet Explorer or Firefox) and whether you use a
Windows or Mac operating system (and which ver-
sion) to best display their Web pages on your monitor.
If you’ve been to the site before, they may have put a
cookie on your computer that identifies you when you
visit again and provides your preferred experience
automatically.
A cookie is a small piece of code that’s downloaded to
your computer. This code contains information about
you and your browsing or purchasing habits. Sites
such as Amazon.com might download a cookie, for
example, so that they can greet you by name and rec-
ommend books or music you might like, based on
which items you’ve looked at or purchased. Browsers
offer the option of choosing whether to block the
download of cookies or to specify sites you trust and
want to allow to download cookies. 
➟Information that isn’t essential but that you’re com-
fortable sharing: A company may ask how you heard
about its site, or it may ask you to rate products so
they can make other recommendations, for example.
This exchange of information is relatively harmless,
unless the sells your preferences to others to spam you
(send you unsolicited offers). Still, providing these
pieces of information shouldn’t be mandatory, as they
aren’t required to complete a transaction or interac-
tion, in most cases.
➟Information that you aren’t comfortable sharing: For
example, if you’re buying a book and the store asks
for your gender and income bracket, that’s highly per-
sonal information that isn’t required to complete the
transaction. If this information is optional, don’t pro-
vide it. If it isn’t optional, you shouldn’t do business
with that site. Period.
➟
28
Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

Figure 2-3
How Web Sites Use Demographics
Web sites typically need information — for a variety of reasons —
about the people who visit. They have the ability to do the following:
➟Capture a set of information that they may use for
better matching your interests or for marketing/infor-
mation reselling purposes.
➟Monitor how long you stayed on their site and which
articles/pages you visited while there.
➟Track which Web site you were on before coming to
their site and which site you go to after you leave
their site. (See Figure 2-4.)
Web sites require personal information for financial transactions
➟
29
Chapter 2: How the Internet Views You

Figure 2-4
Although Web sites learn this information, they may or may not use it
in any way other than to improve their services. They may also sell
information about their general audience demographics to advertisers,
who want this information to better target ads. In general, this isn’t par-
ticularly invasive, but some cases may warrant particular attention. For
example:
➟If the Web site you just visited was a medical site con-
taining information about an illness you have, the
next Web site you visit knows you were looking at
that information.
Web sites can track your online activity
➟
30
Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

➟If you were just on your bank’s Web site, the site you
go to next knows where you bank.
If the site you go to is one you trust, this really represents no issue. If,
however, you go to a questionable site, this level of information collec-
tion may make you somewhat less comfortable. At this point, it begins
to be important that
➟You go to only reputable sites that respect your privacy.
➟If you log in to your bank or insurance company’s
site, for instance, close your browser after you log out
of that site so that your browsing history from that
session is no longer available.
How Search Engines Use Your Information
In theory, personal information is stripped out of anything search
engines share with other companies, but in reality, this isn’t always 
the case.
Search engines collect information about what you search for because
they want to
➟Improve the quality of their search results.
➟Target advertising to you.
➟Resell that information to other companies.
Use a search engine you trust; the major services such as Yahoo!,
Google, Ask (shown in Figure 2-5), and AOL are generally safe. Note
whether you get increased spam or pop-ups after using a search engine.
If it’s related to what you were searching for, find another search
engine.
➟
31
Chapter 2: How the Internet Views You

Figure 2-5
Your searches tell a great deal about you, and search
engines have come under heavy pressure — particularly
in Europe — to limit the length of time they store
information about all the search queries you’ve made.
This pressure on search engines is a result of a
demand for increasing your privacy and reducing the
invasiveness of the information stored — and sold —
about you.
Understand Terms and Conditions
Remember that an important aspect of making choices about sharing
information is your trust in the company you’re interacting with. Its
terms and conditions can help you decide how much you trust it. For
example, you’re probably far more comfortable sharing your financial
➟
32
Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

information on a banking site because its terms state that it holds the
information in the strictest confidence. However, you may be uncom-
fortable with posting information or images on a social networking site
that has terms that state that it owns and can use any content you place
there in any way it likes.
Every service you use should state its terms and conditions of use. The
statement should include a clear itemization of the type of information
they collect about you and the rights you grant them if you choose to
use the service. Although we realize that reading the fine print is about
as much fun as watching laundry spin, reading this fine print for any
site where you want to share personal information is important because
there are significant differences in services.
Look at these two examples:
➟Read the terms and conditions that the social net-
working site Bebo (www.bebo.com) uses for content
ownership. (See Figure 2-6.) It clearly states that it
has no ownership rights to your material, may not
sell your material, and that you retain full control of
your material.
➟Now look at the terms that another social networking
site, Facebook (www.facebook.com), imposes. (See
Figure 2-7.) It claims full rights to your material, to
sell, reuse, and distribute it. It also claims this right
even if you remove your content because the site can
retain and use archived copies.
Figure 2-6
➟
33
Chapter 2: How the Internet Views You

Figure 2-7
Quizzes and Surveys
Take a look at quizzes and surveys to understand how their creators use
your information.
➟Quizzes are created for revenue. Ask yourself who
profits from you answering the questions and who
else gets to see your answers. We have yet to see a
quiz that provides you with a clear set of terms and
conditions informing you of the rights the company
has to use your answers, and how they intend to use
that information.
➟Seniors who use social networking sites that cater to
silver surfers are often targeted with quizzes and sur-
veys (see Figure 2-8) that often have very invasive
questions about their health, wealth, and personal
lives.
➟Any information posted in these quizzes is highly
likely to be sold and used by many companies.
➟
34
Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

Figure 2-8
➟If the quiz has no questions of a personal nature, how
and where the quiz provider shares that information
may not matter to you. But answer a health quiz and
you may find that your insurance claims, even your
ability to get insurance, are affected.
➟Consider who else you may put at risk through your
answers. If you answer a medical survey that asks for
information about illnesses that run in your family,
might this information be used to decline coverage or
increase premiums for grandchildren?
➟
35
Chapter 2: How the Internet Views You

➟Quizzes can also generate targeted spam offers based
on your answers. If you answer a diabetes quiz that
asks about your least attractive feature, and you
answer your skin, what do you want to bet that skin
lotion and anti-wrinkle cream spam mail begins to
appear in your inbox?
You must be especially careful about spam regarding
medications and miracle cures. Never buy medical
supplies or medications from online drug stores that
you don’t already have a personal relationship with in
the brick-and-mortar world.
Protect Yourself
Now that you understand the value of your information to others, you
can keep yourself relatively safe by following this advice:
➟Interact with only sites you trust. These might be
sites that people you know recommend or businesses
you trust offline. You can also use a feature in your
Internet browser or a security product, such as McAfee
Site Advisor (read more about these in Chapter 4), to
identify and avoid sites that are known to download
malware (malicious software) onto your computer.
➟Don’t expose private information to the general
public. If you’re sharing personal information such as
your name, location, or daily schedule, keep settings
in social networking and other accounts private. (See
Figure 2-9.) If you’re writing for the broader public,
take care to avoid exposing private information at all.

others — including friends, organizations that you
volunteer or work with, and the government — may

the target of a scam, and forwarding the messages to your friends puts
them at risk as well. By forwarding chain e-mail, you may help spam-
mers collect new e-mail addresses to target people and sell a variety of
products and services to them. If you do choose to forward an e-mail
to a group, do so responsibly.
1. Check a site like Snopes.com or TruthOrFiction.com to
see if it is a known scam. If it is, delete it. If it isn’t a
known scam you still have to be cautious. With the mes-
sage open in your e-mail program, start by clicking and
dragging your mouse over the message text to select it.
2. In your e-mail application, choose Edit➪Copy to copy the
content. (The keystroke shortcut for copying is to press
Ctrl+C.) (See Figure 3-1.)
3. Open a new e-mail, click in the message field,and choose
Edit➪Paste to paste the message contents into the form.
(Ctrl+V)
4. Place your e-mail address in the To: field and, if you are
sending to more than one person and the people do not
already know each other’s e-mail addresses, place recipi-
ents’ e-mail addresses in the Bcc: field. 
Bcc means blind carbon copy. The message is sent to any
e-mail addresses you put in that field, but none of the
e-mail’s recipients see each other’s e-mail addresses. Some
e-mail programs display the field on messages, in others
you have to click a button or link labeled something like
Show Cc and Bcc or Add Cc and Bcc.
5. Enter a subject and click Send.
To check out the latest scams, visit www.snopes.com

search feature on this site to look for scams using the
title of the e-mail or keywords found in it such as
bank account or Nigeria.

Don’t Play Russian Roulette with Links
Never trust a link from someone you don’t know. If you click it, it may
take you to a phony site that may look like your bank or credit card
company, for example, but isn’t. One thing a criminal can’t fake is the
actual Web site address of a company or bank — but they can make it
look very close to legitimate. For example, eBey.com or eBay.com.il can
look very close to eBay.com. Instead of clicking a link in an e-mail,
protect yourself by verifying the link. Here’s how you can do that:
1. Enter the company name in a search engine, such as
Google or Ask.com.
Choose Copy

correct site, as some criminals create phony sites with
similar-sounding names. If your browser or another pro-
gram provides validation for sites, as with McAfee Site
Advisor, check the rating for the site before going to it to
be safer.

5. If you determine the site is legitimate and think you’ll
want to return to it, bookmark it. Before you leave the
site, save it as a favorite in your browser so that one click
brings you there anytime. in Internet Explorer, click the
Add to Favorites button and choose Add to Favorites

Create Safer E-Mail Aliases
Your real name displays by default on e-mails you send from many of
the major e-mail services, so whoever you e-mail can see your full
name and your e-mail address. Because a last name and an online 
people directory (like WhitePages.com) may be all it takes to locate
your family, look up your phone number, and have a sense of your
income bracket based on the location of your home, you may want to
avoid having your full name display in your e-mails. The good news is
that you can change this setting.
1. In Windows Live (if you don’t have a Windows Live Mail
account, see the following tip), click the Options button
on the right side of the screen (next to the Help icon with
a question mark on it) and choose More Options; then
continue with the steps that follow.
Other e-mail services have their own procedures for
changing the display of your name in sent messages.
If your email service displays your name, and you
don’t find a setting like the one in Windows Live Mail
to change, e-mail your provider or search its Help site
for the proper procedure. If the provider doesn’t allow
you to make this change, ask it to do so, or consider
changing services.
2. Click the View and Edit Your Personal Information link.
3. Click the Settings link on the left side of the screen.

Use Passwords Wisely
The prospect of creating a strong password, changing a password, or
using multiple passwords makes many people anxious because they
believe it requires memorizing multiple complex passwords, such as
Wts4e_79PBa13^_qnS. The result is that people find the task so
daunting that they continue to use one password. This just isn’t safe,
particularly if the password is a simple one.
Safe passwords don’t have to be hard to create; they just have to be
hard to guess. Here are a few ground rules:
Edit your first and last name
➟
46
Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

➟Use unique passwords on sensitive sites so that, if
one password is compromised, all of your Web infor-
mation isn’t compromised.
➟Passwords that are short, simple words or include
numbers that relate to personal information (such 
as birth date or address) are easy to guess. Don’t 
use them.
➟If you made hard-to-remember passwords, you prob-
ably did so because your business or a Web site
forced you to. In this case, you’re likely to have a list
of the passwords next to your computer — even
though you know this also compromises your safety.
It’s okay to keep the list, just put it in a safe place
that’s not near your computer.
Recognize Weak Passwords
Use Table 3-1 to help make sure your passwords aren’t weak.
Table 3-1
Weak Passwords
Password
Weakness
Password
The word password is the most commonly used password, and 
it’s pathetically weak — as are default and blank. These are 
simple words and easily guessed or broken with a dictionary 
assault on the password.

Although this uses nine characters and includes letters and 
numbers, names that are associated with you or your family, 
or other identifying information such as birth year, are easily 
hacked.

Although it mixes upper- and lowercase letters and numbers, 
it’s too short. And substituting the number 1 for the letter l is 
easy to guess.

Chapter 3: Raise Your Safety Bar Today

It’s easy and can actually be fun to create strong passwords — you just
have to know how — and the payoff in increased safety is huge.
Create Strong Passwords
Table 3-2 outlines five principles for creating strong passwords.
Table 3-2
Principles for Strong Passwords
Principle
How to Do It
Length
Use at least 10 characters if the site allows it, otherwise 
make it as long as possible.
Strength
Mix it up with upper- and lowercase letters, characters, 
and numbers.
Obscure
Use nothing that’s associated with you, your family, your 
company, and so on.
Protect
Don’t place paper reminders near your computer. If you are 
viewing a password-protected Web site, and others are nearby, 
lock the computer before stepping away. 
Change
The more sensitive the information, the more frequently you 
should change your password.
Look at Table 3-3 for examples of password patterns that are safe but
also easy to remember.

Beware of Simple Password Hints
Often, a site gives you a choice of password “hints” when setting up a
membership or an account. Don’t use security questions with answers
that someone can discover with a search engine. If hackers can answer
your security question, they can access your password and expose you
to theft on the site involved — and any other sites using that password
if you didn’t make it unique. Figure 3-7 shows a list of password hints,
some of which are safer (name of first pet) and some of which aren’t
(Mother’s birthplace).Follow these guidelines in providing password
hints:
Figure 3-7
Choose your password hint
➟
50
Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

➟Never pick a hint with an easily discoverable answer.
Your street name, place of birth, mother’s maiden
name, and even your car model may be easy to find,
whereas your favorite author may not.
➟When all the choices are easily discoverable, ignore
the question and use a word that means something
to you; for example, sunshine. The site isn’t validat-
ing this information for accuracy; if you forget your
password they just want you to provide the same
answer that you used to establish the account. Enter
whatever you want, but make sure you remember it!
Figure Out Who’s Exposing You
Remember that you aren’t the only one sharing information. Use 
a browser to search for information about you and consider these 
possible sources:
➟Family and friends may post information about you
in blogs, on genealogy sites, and in photo-sharing
sites, for example.
➟Does your employer share information about you on
the company Web site? Review what’s posted to see if
you are comfortable with what is in your employee
bio. If you are working in a big company, you may
also want to be cautious about how much is visible
to other employees on an intranet (a company inter-
nal Internet). When you attend a conference, has
your company provided a bio of you for use in
online conference documents? If your company
encourages employees to leave out-of-office messages
on their e-mail (see Figure 3-8), be aware that these
may reveal when you’ll be away from home and
make you a target for burglary.

➟Many seniors head back to school in later years. Be
sure your school does not expose student informa-
tion on their Web sites if the general public can
access those sites. If they post photos and identify
students by last name this put you at risk. Posting
schedules of after-school activities along with infor-
mation about which activities a student participates
in makes you physically locatable.
Be Careful What You Share Online
Before sharing information online, consider what you are sharing (how
sensitive the information is) and who you want to share the information
Avoid revealing too much information

with. If the information is general in nature or restricted to a site that
isn’t available to the general public, there should be little risk in sharing
it. However, if the information identifies you, your possessions, or some-
one else in some way, you want to limit access to that information.
Here are some categories of information you may want to consider as
you determine what you’re comfortable sharing — or having others
share about you publicly. This list doesn’t presume to be a definitive
inventory of identifying information, but it can get you thinking about
what you share and where you share it.
➟Identifying information: birth year, birth date,
zodiac sign, social security number, city, state, hob-
bies, emotional state.
➟Addresses: This includes home and work addresses,
as well as any other location you visit regularly,
Consider what information goes in birth, wedding,
graduation, and death announcements.
➟Phone numbers: This includes home, mobile phone,
work number, and friends’ numbers.
➟Personal numbers: Bank accounts, credit cards, debit
cards, PINs, phone calling card, SSN, passport, dri-
ver’s license number, birth date, wedding date, insur-
ance policy numbers, loan numbers, VIN numbers,
license plate, and more.
➟Information rich photos: A perfectly innocent photo
can reveal more than you think. You might put your-
self, family members, or friends at risk by posting
photos that show where you live or work, for exam-
ple. Learn more in Chapter 6.
Don’t place information about others online without
first obtaining their express permission. And ask your
friends and family to do the same for you.

Avoid Risky Default Settings
Many social sites claim in their usage terms the right to use any of the
information you provide in any way they choose. See Figure 3-9 which
shows the terms for Facebook for an example.
Figure 3-9
If they own your content and profile and decide to reuse or resell your
information (for example to sell your personal information to an
advertiser or use your granddaughter’s picture for advertising), there
isn’t much you can do about it.
In addition, even if you select the Private setting on a social-networking
site or discussion forum, your profile settings are typically public. When
you sign up for a service and provide the required information, select-
ing the private mode, may not prevent your photo, name, URL, city,
state, and date you last logged in from showing. Check your public pro-
file after you sign up to see what’s exposed. If you’re not comfortable
with the exposure, remove some information, or close your account.
This information can be used to help ID thieves, cyberbullies, scammers
who pretend to share your interests and other criminals.

ground. How she dresses says a lot about her socio-
economic status.

To make this so-called private page truly private, she should do the 
following:
➟Change her profile picture to something less 
identifiable.
➟Take her city (at least) out of her profile.
➟Use a nickname instead of her real name.
➟Make her URL anonymous.
➟Hide her age.
Spot Bad Sites a Mile Away
You’re much safer online if you deal only with sites you trust. Look for
a couple of things, including the following, to help you identify trusted
Web sites.
➟Check before you click. Use a tool that lets you know
before you click a Web site if it is likely to download
malware or spam. These tools display a rating to indi-
cate whether they are known to be a safe site or if
they are likely to give problems such as downloading
malware, putting you on a spam list, or making you a
target of fraud. Both Internet Explorer and Firefox
browsers offer free tools to help warn users about
questionable Web sites Additionally, some security
suites like premium versions of McAfee include strong
Web site reputation tools. (See Figure 3-11.)
➟Is the site listed with the BBB? or rated by other
Web site rating services? If it is topic specific, (such
as a medical site) does it have association approval? 
➟
56
Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

➟Before entering your information on any site, look
for the site’s privacy policy. It should answer your
questions about how it treats personal information,
how it uses your information, whether it gives third
parties access to your information, how accurate the
information on its Web site is, what level of security
it implements, and so on. If you can’t easily find the
site’s privacy policy, go elsewhere! (See Figure 3-12.)
See Chapter 12 for more about identifying trusted
sites when shopping online and Chapter 14 for
advice about using healthcare related sites.

Understand the Risks in Contests and Sweepstakes
If you spend any time online, you’ve seen ads claiming things like “You
are already a winner; click here.” (See Figure 3-13.) Or “Click to enter
our sweepstakes and win fabulous prizes.” You probably also receive
spam informing you that you’ve “Won the lottery.”
These offers have only one purpose — to make money for the sender
or advertiser. At best, they make you jump through all kinds of hoops
to get the “free” prize. It’s much more likely, however, that you will get
nothing, but have given a lot – your personal information, preferences,
and so on. That information may be resold to reputable, or to less than
reputable, companies, organizations, and individuals.
A site’s privacy policy
➟
58
Part I: The Foundation of Using the Internet Safely

Figure 3-13
Typically, these prize awards require all sorts of information from you
for “authorization” and for “transferring the funds to your bank” —
which is scammer language for “We’re going to steal your identity and
empty your bank account.” They may also try convincing you to send
money to cover “handling costs” that for some reason have to be paid
before they can send you what you “won.”
Never provide information about yourself or others to any site that you
do not know and trust. Look for clear terms and conditions and a pri-
vacy policy that protects you. An amazing number of people forget
these common sense rules, and provide tons of information to spuri-
ous sites that don’t even offer a privacy policy. They pay dearly for it.
Fortunately, you’ve been around the block a couple of times and know
that you just don’t get something for nothing.
Even going to the Web sites these sweepstakes and contests direct you
to is taking a risk; the Web sites are highly likely to download malware
(malicious software) onto your computer if you don’t have anti-virus
or anti-spyware software in place. (See Chapter 15 for information on
obtaining and using anti-virus and anti-spyware programs.)
Spam attempting to collect personal information
➟
59
Chapter 3: Raise Your Safety Bar Today

This isn’t to say that you can’t find some legitimate sweepstakes and
lotteries — you can. And you can identify these legitimate companies
through the Better Business Bureau. (See Figure 3-14.) Never trust the
claims that unknown companies or entities make about themselves or
others. Legitimate sweepstakes, lottery, and prize-giveaway companies
don’t contact you via unsolicited e-mail nor do they advertise in flash-
ing animation displayed on unrelated Web sites. These indicators are
clear red flags.

Navigating the
Internet Safely
T
he Internet represents nearly the sum of all
information humans have learned and col-
lected. Think of any topic, and you’re likely to
discover a wealth of information about it —
for example, for the search term World War II
buttons you can get more than 17 million
search results. The term dust mites returns more
than two million results, and how to yodel
shows 225,000 results. Pretty amazing.
How safe you are while surfing through all this
information depends a lot on you. As you click
links to various Web sites, check out special
offers and ads, play games, and more, it’s
important that you understand how your
choices and actions, the sites you visit, and the
links you click protect you or put you at risk
for scams, malicious software, or landing on
offensive sites.
You can help keep your online browsing 
experience safe by using browser security 
settings and learning to identify safer sites.
Additionally, you are accountable for your
activities online; you need to understand the
laws and ethics for use of online information,
materials, and communications so that you
can avoid committing plagiarism or other
crimes, or simply being rude.

Note that we use Internet Explorer version 7 for tasks in this chapter,
but other browsers and versions have similar functionality.
Choose the Best Browser for You
To navigate the Internet, you use a software program called a browser.
There are several browsers available, free of charge. The most popular
are Microsoft’s Internet Explorer (see Figure 4-1), Mozilla’s Firefox (see
Figure 4-2), and Apple’s Safari (which can run on both Mac and
Windows).
The browsers mentioned here all have reasonable
security features, so your choice probably comes down
to your personal preference for the appearance of the
browser and ease of use of features. Remember:
Offering security settings is only half the battle. You
have to apply those settings to make your browsing
experience safer. We tell you how to adjust those set-
tings in the “Customize Browser Security Settings” sec-
tion, later in the chapter.

Browsers are free, so read reviews and comparisons about the various
options and consider trying a few out. Look for the following features
as you do:
➟Set up: All browsers are fairly easy to install and set
up, but not all make it easy to import your settings or
contacts from an old browser to a new one. If this
matters, evaluate the options.
➟Speed: Browsers also perform differently in terms of
how fast they download and display content and how
well they display text and graphics on various Web
sites. Does one browser do a better job for you than
another?
➟Navigation tools: A browser lets you move from one
page on the Web to another, move back a page, go to a
page by entering its online address (called a URL), and
jump back to your home page (the page you want to
open by default whenever you start your browser; note
that many browsers allow you to set more than one
home page to appear on tabs in the browser window).

➟Favorites, Bookmarks, and History features: If there
are sites you like to visit often, a Favorites or
Bookmarks feature allows you to save those sites in a
list and quickly go to them again. The History feature
lets you see sites you’ve visited in recent days or weeks
and go there again without having to look up the site
names or URLs. Favorites are perfect for those times
that you accidentally close a site and can’t remember
how you got there.
Storing favorite sites is a really good feature to use for
saving the proper URLs for sites that could be used in
phishing schemes. For example, save your financial
sites as favorites and open them via your favorites list
instead of clicking a URL in an e-mail that may lead
you to a phony site.
➟Security and safety settings: All browsers let you
choose the security level you want, and these settings
are critical to a safe online experience. Some browsers
offer more security options than others. Security fea-
tures include tools that let you adjust these types of
settings:
• How your browser handles small bits of down-
loaded code used to let Web sites recognize you
whenever you visit (called cookies) 
• How you’re alerted if a Web site you attempt to visit
has an out-of-date security certificate or a question-
able reputation 
• Whether you want your browser to save passwords
for certain sites 
• Whether you want to block pop-up windows from
appearing

➟Personalization: Browsers offer different levels of cus-
tomization for the browser appearance, such as color
schemes, themes that include graphic symbols, style
and size of font choices, backgrounds, and so on.
Many users never personalize their browsers; others
swear by it.
➟Tools: Download managers make downloading files
easier. Viewing tools make it easy to zoom in and out
or show the browser in full screen (making toolbars
disappear and filling your screen with the browser).
Tabs allow you to have several sites open at one time
and use tabs to move among them. Thumbnails pro-
vide visual access to your most visited sites.
Identify Secure and Trusted Web Sites
You’re much safer online if you go to only those sites with good reputa-
tions. These may be sites of companies you already know and trust, or
sites that your browser or a third-party program indicates is trustworthy.
There are several tools to help you identify trusted Web sites:
➟Check before you click. All the major browsers we
mention in the preceding section provide a feature
that advises you on the trustworthiness of Web sites.
Products such as McAfee SiteAdvisor (see Figure 4-3)
do this as well. These are fabulous tools that let you
know, before you click a search result, if the Web site
is likely to be dangerous and might download mal-
ware or spam. Such tools place a rating next to sites
returned in a search to indicate how safe they are to
visit. We strongly urge you to use this functionality: It
will save you a great deal of grief. 
➟
67
Chapter 4: Navigating the Internet Safely

➟Look for the site’s privacy policy. Even when a site
has been tested to ensure that it won’t dump mali-
cious software on your computer, you still need to
evaluate if the site is ethical. A site’s privacy policy
should answer your questions about how it treats and
uses personal information and whether third parties
will have access to your information, and it should
provide assurances about the accuracy of the informa-
tion on its Web site, its level of security, and so on. 
If you can’t easily find the site’s privacy policy, go

Web by using a browser. Internet Explorer (also called, simply, IE) from
McAfee SiteAdvisor indicates trustworthy sites
➟

Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

Microsoft is probably built into your Windows operating system, so it’s
a good place to start. (Safari comes with Mac operating systems.)
1. Open Internet Explorer by clicking its icon on the Quick
Launch bar located on the Windows Vista taskbar (it looks
like a little blue “e”).
2. If you want to adjust text size for better readability, near
the top-right side of the browser choose Page➪Text Size
and select a larger size setting. You can also hold down the
Ctrl key on your keyboard and move the scroll wheel on
your mouse up or down to enlarge or shrink text.
3. Enter a Web site address in the Address bar, as shown in
Figure 4-4, and then press Enter. If you don’t know any
URLs, type ilookbothways.com into the address bar to
visit our Web site.
Figure 4-4
4. On the resulting Web site, you’ll notice different areas of
content on the page, including a horizontal navigation bar
with text or graphics you can click to visit various pages
on the site. The rest of the page includes content in the
form of text and graphics. Usually, the browser window
doesn’t display a whole page. To display the rest of the
page, click the arrow on the bottom right side of the win-
dow (on the scrollbar), or press the Page Down key on
your keyboard.
5. Hover your mouse over any of the text, graphics, photos,
and buttons on the page. If the mouse pointer changes
from an arrow to a hand with a finger poised to press a
button, you know that you can click that element for
more information. Click whatever interests you.

6. The Back button on your browser takes you back, page by
page, through where you’ve been. If you go back one or
more pages, you can use the Forward button to navigate
toward your most recently viewed page.
7. Click the down-pointing arrow at the far right of the
Address bar to display a list of sites that you visited
recently, as shown in Figure 4-5. Click a site in this list to
go there.
Figure 4-5
The Refresh button (the up and down green arrows to
the right of the Address bar) and the Stop button (the
red X) are useful for navigating sites. Click Refresh to
redisplay the current page. This is especially useful if a
page updates information frequently, such as on a
stock market site, or if a page doesn’t load correctly; it
might load correctly when refreshed. If you make a
mistake entering the address or if the page is taking
longer than you’d like to load, click Stop to halt the
process.
A pop-up is a small window that might open from
time to time as you browse, and pop-ups usually con-
tain annoying advertisements. You can use the Pop-Up
Blocker to stop pop-up ads from appearing. Choose
Tools➪Pop-Up Blocker➪Turn On Pop-Up Blocker to
activate this feature. You can also use the Pop-Up

Blocker Settings command on this same menu to
specify sites on which you do want to allow pop-ups.
For details, see Chapter 15, which explains how you
can adjust privacy settings.
Many people feel anonymous when browsing online,
but that isn’t entirely correct. The level of information
any site learns about you when you browse (even if
you don’t log in) may be considerably more than you
realize. See Chapter 2 for more about how sites gather
your personal information and how they use it.
Use Tabs in Browsers
Internet Explorer (IE), Firefox, and Safari, offer a feature called tabbed
browsing. In addition to opening multiple home pages on tabs, you can
open new tabs as you browse the Web. (See Figure 4-6.) You can then
click tabs to jump to other sites that you’ve displayed on those tabs
without having to navigate backwards or forwards in a single window
to sites you’ve previously visited.
Figure 4-6
Here’s how to use tabbed browsing for maximum efficiency in Internet
Explorer:
1. Click the New Tab button to open a new, blank tab. The
new tab now appears above the body of the tab area to
the right of any other open tabs.

2. Type an address in the Address bar and press Enter; the
site appears in your newly displayed tab.
3. Click another tab to jump to another site and keep the
first site displayed in your browser.
4. Click the New Tab button again to add another tab for
browsing.
5. Click the Close button (the X on the right side of the tab)
on any active tab to close it.
You can open a linked page in a new tab quickly by
right-clicking the link and choosing Open in New
Tab. A new tab opens with the page displayed.
Set Up a Home Page
If you find yourself going to one Web page often (for example, your
e-mail page or the local weather), you can create one or more home
pages. Whenever you open your browser, home pages display on tabs
automatically.
1. To try this, open IE and choose Tools➪Internet Options.
2. In the resulting Internet Options dialog box, click the
General tab. In the Home Page box, type a Web site
address to use as your home page, as shown in Figure 4-7.
Note: You can enter multiple home pages that appear on
different tabs every time you open IE. Just type a Web
address, press Enter, and type the next Web address on the
next line.
Alternatively, click one of the following preset option
buttons:
• Use Current: Sets whichever page is currently displayed
in the browser window as your home page.
➟

• Use Default: This setting makes the MSN Web page your
home page.
• Use Blank: If you’re a minimalist, this setting is for you.
No Web page displays; you just see a blank area.
3. Click OK to save your settings and close the dialog box.
4. Back in Internet Explorer, click the Home icon (it looks
like a little house) on the top-left side of the browser win-
dow to go to your home page.
To remove a home page that you’ve set up, click the
arrow next to the Home icon and choose Remove. In

Add a Web Site to Favorites
1. Open Internet Explorer, type the address of a Web site that
you want to add to your Favorites list, and then press
Enter. (In the Firefox browser, favorites are called book-
marks, but they operate in the same way.)
2. Click the Add to Favorites button and then choose Add to
Favorites.
3. In the resulting Add a Favorite dialog box, as shown in
Figure 4-8, you can modify the name of the Favorite list-
ing to something easily recognizable, or leave it as is.

Regularly cleaning out your Favorites list is a good
idea — after all, do you really need the sites that you
used to plan last year’s vacation? With the Favorites

Search the Internet
Simple-to-use programs called search engines make it easy to find infor-
mation on the Internet — probably more information than you ever
wanted!
1. To use Internet Explorer’s search feature, open IE and click
in the Search text box in the top-right corner on the tool-
bar. The default search engine is Windows Live Search.
2. Type a search term in the text box and then click Search
(the little magnifying glass shaped button to the right of
the search field). A search term is simply a word or phrase
that relates to the results you seek. For example, if you
want information about arthritis, enter the word arthritis
or the phrase joint pain. Keep these guidelines in mind:
• Be as specific as possible. For example, to look for infor-
mation on train travel in Canada, don’t just enter
Canada; instead, enter something like train trips, Canada.
• You can separate several terms with commas, such as
dogs, retrievers to search for results with either or both
words. (This depends on the search engine; Google
looks for only those results with both words; some 
others won’t.)
➟
78
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

• You can use a plus sign to require that all terms are
included in the results (such as dogs+retrievers so that the
results include both dogs and retrievers).
• You can use phrases such as the Civil War. However,
many search engines disregard words like the and of.
Also, capitalization usually makes no difference, as
search engines typically aren’t case sensitive.
• The order of the terms can be important. If you want to
search for a job, for example, but only freelance jobs,
consider entering freelance jobs rather than jobs, freelance
to put the emphasis on the type of job you want.
3. In the resulting list of links (see Figure 4-13), click a link
to go that Web page.
Note that browsers often return sponsored links at the
top or right side of the search results page. These are
sites that pay to have their information included. You
can click them, but remember that they’re paid adver-
tisers, and there’s a greater risk of downloading dan-
gerous software to your computer if you click a
sponsored link.
4. If you don’t see the link that you need, click and drag the
scrollbar on the right side of your browser to view more
results.
Before searching, find out about the data retention
(what information of yours they can keep) and data
resell (what information they resell) policies of the
search engine you’re using. If the policies don’t match
your comfort level for safety and privacy, consider a
different search service.

box. Use the following options to narrow your results:
• Match Whole Word Only: Select this option if you want
to find only the whole word. (For example, use this
option if you enter elect and want to find only elect and
not electron or electronics.)
• Match Case: Select this option if you want to match the
case. (For example, use this option if you enter Catholic
and want to find only the always-capitalized religion
and not the adjective catholic.)
3. Click the Next button. The first instance of the word is
highlighted on the page. (See Figure 4-15.) If you want to

Find dialog box.
Many Web sites, such as www.amazon.com, have
Search This Site features that allow you to search not
only the displayed Web page but all Web pages on a

Use Caution with Internet Ads
There are several ways in which advertising on search engines or Web
sites can place you at risk.
➟Banner ads: Some sites still offer blatantly disrep-
utable banner advertising. (See Figure 4-16.) Clicking
these may put you at risk by downloading spyware,
adware, or other malware, or asking for private infor-
mation that will be resold to spammers, telemar-
keters, snail-mail marketers, and the like.

➟Sponsored ad links: Most users believe that spon-
sored ads (see Figure 4-17) have somehow been
vouchsafed for by the hosting company — whether by
a search engine company or a Web site owner. This is
incorrect. Sponsored ads are really paid placement
ads. The company pays the search engine to get top
placement. According to McAfee, clicking sponsored
advertising is more likely to deliver malware to your
computer than clicking other links. Always check a
site’s safety ranking from a product such as McAfee
SiteAdvisor before clicking any search result.

➟Search terms: Choosing certain search words or
phrases can also place you at risk. For searches that
included the word free, 14 percent of the results led to
disreputable or fraudulent sites, according to a
McAfee study. The problems people encounter
include hidden fees; misleading billing practices;
charges for software that would be free from other
sources; changes to your Windows registry settings;
the delivery of spyware, adware, and so on; and mis-
use of your e-mail information to send hundreds of
spam e-mails to unsuspecting users who think the
e-mail is coming from you.

Avoid Download Theft and Plagiarism
You know that copying material to claim it as your original work is pla-
giarism, which is illegal. The problem is that the Internet makes it easy
to plagiarize; you don’t even have to retype the information; just copy
and paste it. A great deal of information online is available for anyone
to download and use — although you still can’t claim it as your own
work. However, a great deal of content is proprietary — you can read it
and recommend it to others, but you may not make a copy without
obtaining permission from the content owner. Many people who
would never dream of breaking the law inadvertently do so by copying
or downloading material that has copyright protection in place. Here
are some tips to help you understand online copyrights:
➟Read the site terms of use to see whether content on a
Web site is copyrighted. Web site owners may have
established rights to the materials or services they
offer for download.
➟File-sharing programs that allow users to illegally
download music and videos are commonly used, in
spite of some much-publicized arrests. Many people
don’t seem to realize that downloading a copyrighted
video or song that you haven’t paid for is the same as
stealing from the video or music store in your town.
Always check to see if permissions or restrictions
apply to any content you intend to download.
➟Assess the type of site you’re viewing. Is it an educa-
tional site, government site, commercial site, or a per-
sonal site? Government information is free to use, but
commercial or personal content isn’t.
Taking someone else’s content, whether it’s text, pho-
tos, or art, is a common problem with content posted
on social networking sites. While it may not be illegal
to do so, it’s certainly unethical to take someone else’s
material without obtaining their express permission to
do so.
➟
85
Chapter 4: Navigating the Internet Safely

Many sites allow visitors to upload files that others
(privately or publicly) can then download. On such
sites, it’s safest to download from only those users you
know and trust.
Community file-sharing programs that allow music
and movie downloads are notorious for infecting
machines with spyware, viruses, and other forms of
malware. Be very cautious if you download programs
from these sites!
Download Safely
As you browse the Web, you might find files you want to download,
such as music or movie files that you either buy from an online store or
obtain from a site that legally offers them free of charge.
1. Open a Web site that offers files you want to download.
Typically, Web sites display a Download button or link
that initiates a file download.
2. Click the appropriate link to proceed. Windows Vista
might display a dialog box asking your permission to pro-
ceed with the download; click Yes.
3. In the resulting File Download dialog box, as shown in
Figure 4-18, choose either option:
• Click Open to download to a temporary folder. You
can run an installation program for software, for exam-
ple. However, beware: If you run a program directly from
the Internet, you might introduce dangerous viruses to
your system. You should buy and follow the software
manufacturer’s instructions to install and set up an anti-
virus program, such as McAfee or Norton Antivirus, to
scan files before downloading them.
• Click Save to save the file to your hard drive. In the Save
As dialog box, select the folder on your computer or
➟
86
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

removable storage media (a CD-ROM, for example)
where you want to save the file. And remember where you
save it. If you’re downloading software, you need to locate
the downloaded file and click it to run the installation.
If a particular file will take a long time to download,
you might have to babysit it for several minutes. If
your computer goes into standby, it might pause the
download. Check in periodically to keep things mov-
ing along.
Figure 4-18
Customize Browser Security Settings
1. With IE open, choose Tools➪Internet Options and click
the Privacy tab, as shown in Figure 4-19.
2. Click the Settings slider and drag it up or down to select
different levels of security settings. The information to the
right of the slider changes depending on your setting.
3. Read the choices and select a setting that suits you.
The default setting, Medium, is probably a good bet
for most people who have a basic sense of how to
avoid risks online.

Notice that on the Privacy tab, you can also adjust
your pop-up blocker settings. Pop-ups can be in the
form of annoying advertisements, or they can be pop-
up windows that allow you to perform an action on a
site, such as calculating estimated payments on a
mortgage site. You can use pop-up blocker settings on

Risk-Free E-Mail
T
o a great extent today e-mail messages have
replaced letters, providing an almost
instantaneous way to stay in touch, conduct
business, and exchange documents.
However, e-mail carries certain risks that you
should be aware of. These typically fall into
three categories:
➟An e-mail may contain links or files that,
if opened, can place malicious code onto
your computer — or cell phone.
➟Spam is generally e-mail advertising for
some product that arrives unsolicited
from somebody you don’t know.
➟Spam becomes a scam when criminals
use the e-mail to commit fraud. It may
be a financial scam (called phishing)
where they make the e-mail look like an
official notice of some kind to lure you
into revealing financial information that
they can use to steal your money or iden-
tity. Or it may be to get you to click on a
link to place malicious code on your
computer to steal all your information.
These scams come in several varieties, but
they share certain characteristics that we
explore in this chapter.

Chapter

Luckily you can use safe e-mailing practices, filters, and your smarts to
avoid spam and malware, and spot common scam characteristics so
you can avoid becoming a victim. In this chapter, you discover how to
e-mail . . . and do so safely.
E-Mail Safety Basics
Adopt the following e-mail practices to keep you safer every time you
e-mail:
➟Don’t share. Never share sensitive personal informa-
tion such as passwords, social security numbers, and
credit card numbers in e-mail. Even if you e-mail this
information to a known person or business, it can be
intercepted along the way.
Pay attention if you use an automatic e-mail signature
such as the one shown in Figure 5-1. This is a handy
feature that automatically provides whatever signature
information you choose to share. Many people
include their full name, address, and phone numbers
in their signatures. But if it’s inserted in all your e-mail
responses, you might be sharing more information
with people you don’t know than you intend to, espe-
cially if your friends forward your e-mail to others.
➟Consider who you want to e-mail. Just because
someone sends you an e-mail doesn’t mean you need
to read it or respond to it. You can set up your spam
filters to be fairly restrictive and then check your junk
mail folder periodically to see if something important
accidentally got blocked. (If you aren’t sure how to do
this, consult the Help documentation for the e-mail
program you use.)
➟
90
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

Figure 5-1
➟Think twice before you open attachments or click
links in e-mail. If you don’t know the sender, delete
the e-mail; if you do know the sender but weren’t
expecting an attachment, double-check that she actu-
ally sent the e-mail. If your friend didn’t send you the
attachment, delete the message. If her computer is
infected with malicious code, it may automatically
send you e-mails (without her knowledge) with links
or attachments in an attempt to infect your computer
as well.
➟Talk to your friends about their online security. If
they don’t protect their computers from viruses, spy-
ware and other malicious code, they put you at risk
every time they send something to you.
Automatic e-mail signature
➟
91
Chapter 5: Risk-Free E-Mail

➟Report offensive, inappropriate, and illegal material
sent via e-mail to your ISP (Internet service
provider). If the content is illegal, you should also
report it to your local law enforcement agency.
➟Be cautious about meeting online contacts in per-
son. You may know certain people only through
e-mail or contact on a Web site. Just remember that
everything someone tells you about himself and his
motivation for meeting you may be completely true —
or completely false. If you decide to meet someone,
don’t go alone, make sure others know where you’re
going, meet in a very busy, public place, and keep your
cell phone handy.
➟Consider what you’re saying and sharing in e-mail
and how you’d feel if the information was shared
with someone other than the recipient. Anything
you say in e-mail can be forwarded to others or moni-
tored by employers or other family members.
Avoid typing sensitive information into public comput-
ers such as those found in libraries or Internet cafes.
Sensitive information includes your name, phone num-
bers, account numbers, passwords, and home or e-mail
addresses. These computers may be infected with spy-
ware that records your information and sends it to a
criminal. Never select the feature that automatically
logs you on to e-mail when you start the computer, and
don’t select a Remember My Password option when
using a public computer. If you do so by mistake, use
the Forget My Password option in the login screen for
that account to reverse the action. 
Create an E-Mail Account
You can create an e-mail account through a variety of service providers.
These steps take you through creating a Windows Live Hotmail account,

2. Enter the URL www.windowslive.com in your browser
address bar.
3. On the resulting page, click the Sign Up link.
4. Enter the information requested in the Sign Up form that
appears (see Figure 5-2), enter your preferred e-mail
address in the Windows Live ID box. (See the next section
for advice on creating a safe e-mail alias).
5. Click the Check Availability button to find out if the
name you entered is available. If it isn’t, enter another
name and check again until you find one that works, or
select one of the alternates the service offers you.

• Alternate e-mail: Windows Live uses this alternate
e-mail address to e-mail your ID and password to you if
you forget them. If you don’t have another e-mail or
would rather not have a message sent, click the Or
Choose A Security Question for Password Reset link and
proceed with the activity in the next bullet.
• Password hint: Select a password hint question from the
drop-down list. Never choose a question that you can
answer using publicly-available information such as your
place of birth, a school you attended, or your mother’s
maiden name. If none of the questions allow you to give
an answer that others couldn’t discover, use a fake
answer — but remember it! The service doesn’t know if
your answer is correct, it verifies only that you can give
the answer that you provided again if you forget your
password.
• The minimum amount of personal information
required: You may be required to include your name,
gender, year of birth, country, state, and postal code.
7. Type the characters that you see in the Picture box. (See
Figure 5-3.) 
This feature, which asks you to enter the series of rather
strange-looking numbers and/or letters that appear in a
box, may seem annoying, but it’s here to protect you.

creating thousands of fake e-mail accounts. It requires a
human to read the letters or numbers displayed, which 
no computer program can do, to successfully complete 
the form.

Create Safe E-Mail Aliases
Your choice of an e-mail alias can provide as little or as much informa-
tion about you as you choose to share. An e-mail alias like Jack
Stanfield@hotmail.com exposes your full name. This may be
exactly what you want, or you may not want to give away any personal
information. Just remember that whatever information you provide in
your e-mail address, many kinds of criminals — whether their intent is
to cause financial, emotional, or physical harm — can see it, in addi-
tion to those you trust.
Consider the exposure in this e-mail aliases: SusieDoe_64_small_
town@google.com.au reveals enough for someone to find Susie —
her name, age, and small town in Australia. And flirtatious names 
like sexyOver50 may cause unwanted attention and expose you to
greater risk.
If you want the safest personal e-mail alias or nickname (versus your
work e-mail, over which you may have little control), don’t provide
identifiable information, such as:
➟Names: First, middle, or last names. Be sure to read
the next section to change settings if your e-mail
provider displays your full name next to your alias by
default, or avoiding the use of your name won’t do
you any good.
➟
97
Chapter 5: Risk-Free E-Mail

➟Location information: City, town, country, or region,
such as Northwest. Don’t give away your employer in
your personal e-mail alias.
➟Sexual or physical suggestion: Certain words such 
as hot or sexy let others know how you want to be 
perceived, while words like snuggly or lonely suggest 
an interest in intimacy that criminals can take advan-
tage of.
➟Work descriptor: Teacher, engineer, dentist, retired, or
a description of your place of employment.
➟Emotional vulnerability: Words such as sad, grieving,
lost, suicide, and lonely place you at risk; there’s
always a criminal waiting to be your “best friend.”
➟Risk behaviors: Names that speak, even in fun, 
of drug use (littletokr), criminal activity 
(carjacker), or violence (shootingspree) may
attract the wrong kind of person.
➟Ethnic identifiers: May increase the risk of hate
crimes, or they may help identify you — for example,
Asiandoll, N8tive (native), or mxed (mixed).
➟Hobbies or sports: An unusual sport such as polo 
or barrel racing, sports that imply a specific socio-
economic bracket, or sports that are done in only a
few locations (skeet shooting or bull fighting, for
example) are more identifying than baseball or soccer.
Criminals can use such interests to make a personal
connection with a victim.
Employers may have defined domains (@company.
com) and assigned protocols for your name — even
using your full name. It’s important in these cases that
you limit the additional pieces of personal information

that you associate with that account. For example, you
may provide your work phone number in your signa-
ture, but avoid including a personal cell phone num-
ber or your personal e-mail account.
Hide Your Name in E-Mails
Some e-mail services automatically include your full name as well as
your e-mail alias to everyone you send e-mail to. If this isn’t what you
want, you’ll need to find out if this is happening. Send yourself an
e-mail and look at who it’s from. If your name appears there, take steps
to remove this information.
Think about it. Your last name and an online directory search may be
all it takes to locate your family, find your phone number, learn the
value of your home, and more.
Check your e-mail provider’s help topics to get steps for this procedure.
(For Windows Live Hotmail and Yahoo!, the steps are on our Web site

6. When your message is complete, click the Send button.
Believe it or not, e-mail messages have been known to
suddenly get sent before you finish writing them.
Great minds have conjectured that this happens when
you hit some odd keystroke combination unknow-
ingly, or perhaps it’s done by magic. For this reason,
some people prefer to leave the To: line empty until
the message is written just as you want it to be so
you’re not embarrassed by an unfinished or unpol-
ished e-mail going out before you intend.
Any time you send or forward e-mail to a group of
people who don’t know each other, you need to
respect and protect everybody’s identity by placing all
the e-mail addresses in the Bcc: (or blind carbon
copy) field of the message so you don’t expose every-
body’s name to everybody else. See Chapter 3 for
details on how to do this.
Add an Attachment
You can add any kind of file to an e-mail, such as a picture or docu-

Manage Spam
Spam is e-mail sent in bulk to recipients who haven’t requested it.
People usually get spam from senders they don’t know. Spam can be
transmitted over any Internet-connected device (such as a computer,
cell phone, or PDA). It’s a cheap way to market products or services, but
it’s illegal in many countries.
Nearly 70 percent of all e-mail traffic in the world is spam. In 2007,
one study showed that 90 billion spam messages are sent per day.
While Internet service providers are making serious efforts to block junk
(spam) e-mail, determined spammers are making equally serious
efforts to find ways to keep filling your inbox. They constantly evolve
new methods of fooling the anti-spam filters. Here is some advice
about how to avoid and deal with spam:
➟Understand your e-mail provider’s anti-spamming
features and use their settings to flag spam or put it in
a separate junk mail folder. (See Figure 5-16.)
See the next section to set up and use spam filters.
➟
110
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

Figure 5-16
➟Review the junk mail folder periodically to make sure
legitimate e-mail hasn’t been placed there. Then
delete the spam e-mails.
➟Stay up-to-date on spam tactics. (Visit our site at
www.ilookbothways.com or sites such as www.
snopes.com for the latest information.) And when
in doubt about the origin or intent of an e-mail,
delete it.
➟Always have strong anti-spam, anti-virus, and anti-
phishing tools installed on every computer you own,
set these tools to update automatically, and use set-
tings in your e-mail program to block spam. See
Chapter 16 for more about these tools.
Use Spam Filters
Spam filters identify spam and keep it out of your inbox. Most e-mail
programs have built-in filters that route spam to a Junk folder or imme-
diately delete it.
➟
111
Chapter 5: Risk-Free E-Mail

1. To make these settings in Windows Live Hotmail, click the
Options button in the upper-right corner and select More
Options.
2. On the resulting Hotmail Options page (see Figure 5-17),
click the Filters and Reporting link in the Junk E-Mail 
section.
3. On the Filters and Reporting page that appears (see Figure
5-18), adjust any of the following settings:
• Choose a Junk E-Mail Filter: This is where you select
your filter level. The trick here is to find a level that
won’t send e-mail from legitimate sources that aren’t
already contacts into the Junk mail folder, while keeping
your inbox relatively spam free.
Most spam is easy for filters to identify. It can flag
known bad senders or spot keywords in the subject
lines, such as Viagra or sex. But no matter what filter
level you choose, you should periodically check your
Junk mail folder. Spam filters aren’t infallible, and
legitimate e-mails can end up in there by mistake.
• Delete Junk E-Mail: Here you choose when to delete
junk mail. You can choose to just let Windows Live
Hotmail delete junk e-mail immediately or place it in
the junk folder and delete it after 10 days. (We recom-
mend the latter setting so you have a chance to look for
legitimate e-mails that were accidentally routed into the
junk folder.)
• Report Junk Messages: These settings let you choose
whether to report spam. If you select the setting to
report junk, clicking the Junk button will both delete
and report spam; if you choose not to employ this set-
ting, clicking the Junk button simply deletes the mes-
sage. By reporting spam, you can help your e-mail
provider more accurately track and reduce spam for
everyone.

Use Verification Programs
If you’ve had it with spam, consider using a program (see Figure 5-19)
that authenticates users. But keep in mind that most of these services
charge a fee. These programs use a verification system to check any
sender who hasn’t been approved. Here’s how this usually works: 
➟The program scans your contact list and automatically
allows everyone listed there to contact you.
➟When you receive an e-mail from someone who isn’t
in your contact list, the program holds the e-mail in
limbo until two things happen. First, the service sends
an e-mail to the sender and asks that person to verify
that he’s a real person by answering a challenge
response (entering text that he sees onscreen).
Second, only when the sender has successfully
responded to the challenge is the e-mail delivered to
your inbox. Because spam e-mail is sent by auto-
mated malicious programs, there’s no human to
respond to the challenge. Consequently, an auto-
mated sender’s e-mail doesn’t get through. Any e-mail
that doesn’t pass this test doesn’t land in your inbox.
➟People not on your list have to answer the challenge
only once for each email account they use to be vali-
dated for all future e-mails.
➟Any e-mail from those who aren’t verified is stored in
a special folder for a week. This gives you the chance
to review the messages in case you want to accept any
of them.
One such program, Spam Arrest (refer to Figure 5-21),
allows you to try its service free for a month before
you purchase a subscription. Go to www.spam

“preempts all state law that regulates commercial e-mail except to the
extent that state law prohibits falsity or deception.”
The federal statute does the following:

Recognize Fraud and Scams
As in the offline world, the Internet has a criminal element. These
cybercriminals use Internet tools to commit the same crimes they’ve
always committed, from robbing you to misusing your good name and
financial information. Know how to spot the types of scams that occur
online and you’ll go a long way towards steering clear of Internet crime.
Before you click a link that comes in a forwarded e-mail message or for-
ward a message to others, ask yourself: 
➟Is the information legitimate? Sites such as
www.truthorfiction.com, www.snopes.com
(see Figure 5-20), or http://urbanlegends.
about.com can help you discover if an e-mail is 
a scam.
➟Does a message ask you to click links in e-mail (see

whether a message is genuinely from a company or
bank that you use, call them, using the number from
a past statement or the phone book. Remember: Don’t

116

call a phone number in the e-mail; it could be fake.
To visit a company’s or bank’s Web site, type the
address in yourself if you know it or use your own
bookmark rather than clicking a link. If the Web site
is new to you, search for the company using your
browser and use that link to visit its site. Don’t click
on the link in an e-mail, or you may land on a site
that looks right — but is just a good fake.
➟Does the e-mail have a photo or video to down-
load? If so, exercise caution. If you know the person
who sent the photo or video, it’s probably fine to
download, but if the photo or video has been for-
warded several times and you don’t know the person
who sent it originally, be careful. It may deliver a
virus or other type of malware to your computer.

Avoid the Latest E-Mail Scam-of-the-Day
E-mail scams are typically low-value, high-volume crimes where the
cost to a given consumer is comparatively low, but large numbers of
victims mean that the money quickly adds up for the criminals behind
the scam.
One of the ways consumers trip up relates to the relevancy of the scam’s
topic. E-mail scammers are smart about making their scams look cur-
rent because people are much more likely to fall for scams related to
topics already on their minds.
This spam wants you to click a link

For example, Valentine scams circulate around Valentine’s Day. Last
year, a Valentine scammer e-mailed messages with titles including “In
your arms,” “Sending you all my love,” “I love you because . . .,” and so
on. These have short messages and links your are encouraged to click.
Clicking the links downloads malicious software onto your computer.
The subject lines of e-mail scams morph constantly;
there were at least 50 titles in circulation in 2008
alone.
Also around any holiday, be on the lookout for e-mail messages offer-
ing “great deals” on flowers, chocolates, dinners, and so on. If you
aren’t sure that a store is reputable, don’t go there.
When you’re in tax season, tax-related scams abound, including scams
about being audited, getting tax rebates, or offering tax-filing assistance.

Deal with Phishing E-Mails
Phishing scams are an attempt to trick you into divulging sensitive per-
sonal information that allows somebody to steal your identity or empty
your bank account.
Don’t be fooled by phishing. Be very skeptical if you receive an e-mail
that looks like it is from your bank, broker, or other trusted company
but asks you to verify or re-enter sensitive personal or financial infor-
mation through e-mail, a Web site it directs you to, or a phone number
it provides. It’s quite likely a scam.
Look for these telltale signs to spot a phishing e-mail. (See 
Figure 5-22.)
1. You don’t know the sender.
➟
119
Chapter 5: Risk-Free E-Mail

2. The e-mail is illiterate.
3. You’re asked to provide information such as an account
number, phone number, or social security number.
4. The e-mail address is odd or doesn’t include the business
name. Legitimate businesses have their own domain
names (such as aol.com or amazon.com).
5. You are asked to click a link to respond or take an action.
If you check the properties of the link in Figure 5-22 by
right-clicking it and choosing properties, you will find that
the address is bismark.net, not Amazon.
6. You are told that you must click the link and provide
information to get access to your account.
7. You are told not to reply to the e-mail as it is an automated
e-mail and won’t be answered. You are instead urged to log
into your account (using the link they provide).
If you receive a phishing e-mail, take these precautions:
➟Instead of clicking the links in the e-mail, use your
favorite search engine to find the Web site for the
company that sent the e-mail or locate that informa-
tion on your statement.
➟Contact the institution using a phone number from a
statement or type in a company Web site address in
your browser to go to its site and ask about the com-
munication.
➟Report the scam to your e-mail service provider.

P
hotos help to record life moments big
and small and capture the beauty of the
world around us. The ability to nearly instanta-
neously share photos of a new baby, the first
tooth lost, a game victory, or a tragedy can
bridge the gap of distance and time to unite
friends and family. With digital cameras and
camera phones, we’ve entered a new age of
sharing and documenting everyday life and
events as they occur. In this chapter, we tell you
how to post images in various formats and on
various Web services to share them with others.
Of course, it’s important that you remember
that when you share images, you are sharing
information about yourself with others. For
that reason, you have to learn how to share
photos and video online so that you can
remain safe and avoid having your personal
images stolen and used in inappropriate or
even illegal ways.
One final aspect of sharing images online is
understanding copyrights. You should know
what constitutes illegal acts when forwarding
or copying images you find online, and when
your own rights are violated if somebody else
steals your images.

with private settings), you’re providing a face to place with all the other
information about you that may be online.
Images that you post online may provide these types of information:
➟Information to help locate you, such as a house
address, street sign, or business name (See Figure 6-1.)
➟An impression of your mood or level of self-esteem
from your posture or expression, which can give a
predator a way to manipulate your emotions
Figure 6-1

➟Ways to break into your house if your home is in the
picture: windows, doors, possible location of a spare
key, and so on
➟Your socio-economic status, by what you wear, your
home, car, and so on.
➟People in your family or your friends, what they look
like, and where they hang out
Posting photos on private sites allows you to manage
who gets to see them, unless those you give access per-
mission to download a copy and share it. Posting
photos on a public Web site makes the image public,
something you may well want to do. If, however, you
regret posting the image and choose to take it down
you are likely to find that it is very hard to remove all
copies. If the photo has been copied or posted to mul-
tiple sites it is unlikely you will be able to get rid of
each and every copy. For those likely to post embar-
rassing photos (typically teens) or photos with too
much information included, this is a real concern as
you may never entirely erase the damage done. 
When photos and videos are posted on the Internet in a publicly acces-
sible spot, predators and criminals can use the information contained
in them to commit a variety of abuses and crimes. For example, your
images can be:
➟Manipulated to embarass you. Image-altering software
is so advanced that it can be nearly impossible to tell
an altered image from the real deal. Bullies alter
images to humiliate, create conflicts, and deliberately
expose others to risk. Sexual predators alter images for
their own gratification.
➟Sold for false passports or other forms of ID. Faces are
commodities. They’re bought, sold, and reused in a
variety of ways we prefer not to contemplate.
➟
125
Chapter 6: Posting Photos and Videos Safely

➟Sold to pornography sites. One of the fastest ways to
generate ‘new’ pornography images is to add new
faces to old material. 
➟Used in advertising without your knowledge or
approval.
➟Used to steal your identity or scam others. If a crook
has a picture of you and can describe you, your home,
or car, another member of your family may be more
open to believing that the person knows you and may
succumb to a scam.
It isn’t just photos taken with standard cameras that
could cause problems. The quality of cameras embed-
ded in cell phones is rapidly improving. The Asian cell
phone market now has many phone choices with five
or more megapixels, and Samsung has even developed
a 10-megapixel camera phone. These phones take
photos and short videos that have a high enough reso-
lution that they become interesting to copy if posted
publicly. Add this to the new services that carriers are
providing to make it easy to post photos directly to
the Web, and the result is many people are posting
images without really reviewing them from a safety
perspective — usually the comment we get afterwards
is that “it seemed like a good idea at the time.”
Particularly concerning are the highly sexual images
that teens in particular are taking of themselves or oth-
ers with their cameras and then sending to someone —
typically a boy- or girlfriend, all too often these get
shared much further than ever intended and a great
deal of embarrassment occurs. Worse than the embar-
rassment however is that these images are child
pornography — even when the teen is the picture 
taker — and sending as well as receiving these is a
felony offense. These pictures (and short videos) have
monetary value to predators and can make victims
truly identifiable — and locatable.
➟
126
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

Taking pictures of unsuspecting people with camera
phones has become such a problem in parts of the
world that some countries have enacted various levels
of regulations. Saudi Arabia bans the sale of camera
phones outright. South Korea requires manufacturers
to make mobile devices that emit a beep whenever a
picture is taken. France has strict laws about publish-
ing digital images taken without consent.
The risk to your privacy is compounded when an image is combined
with a caption or other descriptive text. You, your family, your
employer, your school, a friend, a sport or after-school club, or even the
local newspaper may sharing an image with text that contains too
much private information.
For example, in Figure 6-2, note the following:
➟The house number is displayed. (Copying the photo
and enlarging it makes the number easily readable.)
➟The photo includes the For Sale by Owner sign listing
the family phone number.
➟The text under the photo indicates that the phone
number won’t change. The area code would help
locate the woman who posted this image, if her pro-
file on the photo-sharing site didn’t already provide
her city and state.
➟The house implies a great deal about the family’s
financial status.
➟The house is empty — the family has moved. It sits
alone on a hill. That’s a lot of information for anyone
wanting a place to party, do (or sell) drugs, steal, van-
dalize, or the like.

When you understand the potential misuses of images, you can make
conscious choices about what you post online. It makes sense to take
precautions, use only reputable photo-sharing sites, and share with
only those people whom you trust.
Share Photos Safely
With digital cameras and camera phones, we’ve entered a wonderful
new age of sharing and documenting everyday life and events as they
occur. Cell phones with cameras are with many of us all the time, and
the quality of the cameras is rapidly improving. With the explosion of
blogs, mobile blogs (called moblogs), photo-sharing sites, personal Web
sites, and image sharing in e-mails and instant messaging, sharing pho-
tos and videos has never been easier. Here’s some advice for managing
who sees your digital images, from photos to videos, to avoid the
potential exposure of private or personal information to people outside
your trusted friends and family:
➟Use only reputable sites, and share only photos that
contain identifiable information with people you trust. 
➟
128
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

➟Use a photo-editing tool such as Windows Photo
Gallery (see Figure 6-3) to cover up or crop out infor-
mation that could put you at risk — for example the
house number, your street sign, and so on. You may
also choose to blur small sections of the image.
➟Strip any additional information that may be stored
along with your photos or video. Many cameras and
cell phones have functionality that collects and stores
both the time and date, and the location where the
photo/video was taken. Web sites typically do not
strip out this information when photos are posted, so
anyone viewing a photo can right-click on it and from
the pop-up menu select Properties. If the information
was collected when the photo was taken, it will be
visible. This means a photo taken in your backyard
would provide anyone viewing the information with
the exact latitude and longitude of your home — and
online mapping services will take this information
and display your home and it’s address.
➟Reduce the photo’s resolution. Some Web sites allow
you to copyright protect your photos, but unfortu-
nately most do not. If the photo is one you are happy
sharing publicly, but do not want people to copy and
reuse and the site does not have a way for you to
block copying, you may choose to post the image
with reduced resolution. It can still look good on the
Web, but the lower resolution makes it less likely that
others will copy and reuse the photo. There are many
software products available (perhaps even one that
comes with your camera) that you can use to remove
or hide information in photos, you may want to
‘paint’ over a section, blur portions of the image,
adjusting the contrast or colors to make certain
aspects less recognizable, or crop the image to remove
information for example.
➟
129
Chapter 6: Posting Photos and Videos Safely

Figure 6-3
Share Videos Safely
Video sharing online through sites such as YouTube (see Figure 6-4)
has exploded in the last couple of years with content from professional
media and individuals. The content ranges from breaking news stories,
to hilarious personal videos and professional comedian’s material, lots
of animal footage, cartoons, educational and how-to content, music
videos, fashion and style videos, events and activist videos, travelogs,
and of course family videos. 
These sites also have hundreds of how-to videos that teach criminal
skills like picking locks, pornographic material (which most sites try to
remove), and videos that promote hate and violence. 
Video content can be particularly compelling for criminals. Videos gen-
erally provide more visual information than a photo, plus they may
allow the criminal to hear a person’s voice and watch their manner-
isms. There are often clues in the background of videos that provide
additional personal or location information for the person who knows
how to look for it.
➟
130
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

Figure 6-4
Check these tips when posting videos online:
➟Select a reputable service. You may want to use a dedi-
cated video hosting company like YouTube, or you may
want to post videos on your social networking site.
Some ways to determine if the site is reputable are (1)
have you heard of it? (2) has it received good reviews?
(3) do you know anyone else using the service? (4) has
there ever been a data breach on the service? (5) do
they retain the right to use your material or do you
control any use of your content?
➟Understand the site’s Terms and Conditions. If it
doesn’t allow you to retain full control of your con-
tent, consider selecting a different site.
➟Before posting video content, consider all the infor-
mation it contains in voice and images. If it includes
personally identifiable information, consider restrict-
ing access to the video by making the site setting pri-
vate so that only those you give access to can view it. ➟
131
Chapter 6: Posting Photos and Videos Safely

➟Listen to what is said; words can also give away infor-
mation about your identity and location.
➟If the video shows friends or family members, you
may be putting them at risk, too. You should obtain
permission from everyone shown in the video before
posting it.
➟Remember that after you post information publicly, it
can stay around forever and may pop up when you
least expect it.
➟If you see inappropriate content or comments on
your video page, report it. The service should review
the report and take appropriate action. You may
choose to not even allow comments on your page if
comments become a problem.
While most Web sites have policies against pornogra-
phy, violence, posting copyrighted material, and so
on, they primarily rely heavily on users to report
abuse (which means you have already been exposed
to the abusive content) rather than filtering the con-
tent before it’s uploaded. This means that you may
come across a great deal of inappropriate material, so
select search terms carefully.
Avoid Image Copyright Infringement
According to U.S. law, any artwork “in a fixed tangible form” automati-
cally has copyright protection. Any use of a photo, video, or other art-
work without express permission of the creator is an infringement of
copyright. Unfortunately, on the Internet, copyrights are frequently disre-
garded and photos posted publicly are likely to be stolen or repurposed.
Consumers should be aware that anything they post online may be
misused in inconsiderate, inappropriate, or even illegal ways. Do 
you part: Never violate a copyright or commit plagiarism with others’
➟
132

materials. If you don’t own the image, you need to assume someone
else does unless the images are on sites specifically offering the free use
of images. When in doubt, contact the person who posted the image
for permission. 
Use Web Cams
Web cams are relatively inexpensive, and many laptops now come with
Web cams embedded in their lids. (See Figure 6-5.) They are relatively
inexpensive (many under $20).
Figure 6-5
Web cams have revolutionized the way we can interact with friends and
family from afar. They allow businesses to meet key people in places far
away without having expensive travel. They are particularly great for
grandparents who want to stay in touch with grandchildren and for
parents who are divorced or traveling or away from home for extended
periods and want to “see” their kids. 
➟
133
Chapter 6: Posting Photos and Videos Safely

Like everything else, Web cams can also be used in negative ways. They
have all the risk potential that sharing videos has, with lots of rich infor-
mation in the background, and being able to hear and see the person in
front of the lens, but they also allow for real-time interactions, not just
viewing. This can make Web cams particularly concerning if they are
used in conversations with strangers, or between teens in private as the
conversations sometimes degrade into fairly graphic exposure.
Web cams can also be high-jacked and turned on remotely. This allows
others to view and listen in without the individuals’ knowing what is
going on. When you aren’t using your Web cam, consider turning it off,
turning it to face the wall, or disconnect the Web cam if it isn’t a built-
in model.
Teens in particular struggle to use good judgment
when using Web cams. If you have grandchildren or
other children in your care, realize that normal inhibi-
tions seem to fall away when they aren’t physically
present with the person they’re speaking to — and
many expose themselves, figuratively and literally. In
addition to having a conversation about appropriate
Web cam use with children and teens, it may be wise
to limit access to Web cams to specific times or in
places where you have some oversight.
Save Photos and Videos in Different Formats
Photos and video files can be saved in a variety of formats. Unlike
some software that saves files in its proprietary format (such as the
.doc or .docx format for a Microsoft Word document or template
file), most photo and video programs can save files in a variety of stan-
dardized formats, depending on your needs. Here’s a quick rundown of
the strengths of each.
➟
134
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

Photos and other graphic images are often saved in one of these formats:
➟TIFF (tagged image file format): If you’re editing
your photo, it’s good to know that TIFF files retain
their integrity better than formats like JPEG. However,
TIFF compression isn’t quite as efficient as some other
formats, which can result in larger files.
➟GIF (graphics interchange format): Files in this for-
mat have fewer colors, so they may work well on a
Web site but aren’t so great for printed photos. Their
smaller sizes make them easier to exchange or share,
although this format is more typically used for logos
or other graphic objects rather than photos.
➟JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group): The JPEG
format often offers more options for controlling
image quality. Use the lowest quality to most easily
send JPEGs via e-mail or speed upload to an online
site. Note that with this format, images degrade every
time you save them.
Some common movie file formats include these:
➟MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group): This format
was developed as an international standard for com-
pression (squeezing memory-hog movies into a
usable form). It’s a common standard with good
compression to save your movies in smaller-sized
files.
➟AVI (Audio Video Interleave): This format was devel-
oped by Microsoft, for Windows. This is probably one
of the most popular formats for playing movie files,
so many players support it.
➟
135
Chapter 6: Posting Photos and Videos Safely

➟MOV (the QuickTime movie format): Originally cre-
ated by Apple, the format has now become popular
and can be played from computers with almost any
operating system using the free QuickTime player. It’s
excellent at integrating text, graphics, video, anima-
tion, and 3D images in a single file.
➟RealVideo (from RealNetworks): RealVideo uses
streaming video, so you can watch a video while
downloading it. Although it’s a proprietary format that
requires RealPlayer software to run (see Figure 6-6), it
has a large group of users. (Which means that if you
send someone such a file, he’s likely to be able to play
it.) And the free player supports various other movie
formats.

Sharing Your
Information 
with Others
T
he Internet offers many options for connect-
ing with people and sharing information.
You’ll find discussion boards and chat sites on
a wide variety of sites, from news sites to recipe
sites, sites focused around grief and health
issues, and sites that host political- or con-
sumer-oriented discussions.
There are some great senior chat rooms for
making friends, and many sites allow you to
create new chat rooms on topics at any time.
Another way people share information is
through mini-comments on social journals
(not to be confused with social networks).
These sites, which limit any comment to no
more than 140 characters (about three sen-
tences), allow you to add your comments
about your life in an ongoing stream of com-
ments from many users. Creating rich, short
messages has become almost an art form
among devotees.
Instant messaging (IM), on the other hand,
isn’t a Web site but a service. Using software
such as MSN Messenger, IM allows you to chat
in real time with your contacts. You can access
instant messaging programs via your computer
or your cell phone.

Chapter

As with any site where users share information (such as social networks
and blogs, covered in Chapter 8, and e-mail, covered in Chapter 5), you
can use these chats, discussions, social journals, and instant messaging
programs safely if you know how to sidestep some abuses, including
data mining for criminal intent, social engineering ploys, ID theft
scams, and so forth. If you’re careful to protect your privacy, you can
enjoy socializing without worry.
In this chapter, we look at some ways of sharing information and we
tell you how to do so safely. But first, you’ll discover how information
placed online accumulates. You aren’t the only one to place it there.
Your Information Is Online, Even If You Aren’t
Many people think that if they aren’t active online, their information
isn’t exposed. But you aren’t the only one sharing your information:
➟Employers: Many employers share information about
employees. Consider carefully how much information
you’re comfortable with sharing through an employee
bio posted on your company Web site. How much
should be visible to other employees on your
intranet? When you attend a conference, is the
attendee list shown in online conference documents?
And even if you’re retired, there may still be informa-
tion about you on your old employer’s Web site.
Review the site to determine if it reveals more than
you’d like it to — and ask your employer to take
down or alter the information if needed.
➟Government agencies: Some agencies post personal
information, such as documents concerning your
home purchase and property tax (see Figure 7-1), on
publicly available Web sites. Government agencies
may also post birth, marriage, and death certificates,
and these documents may contain your social security
number, loan number, copies of your signature, and
so on. You should check government records carefully
to see if private information is posted and demand
that it be removed.

Figure 7-1
➟Family members and friends: They may write about
you in their blogs or mention you on special-interest
sites such as those focused on genealogy.
➟Clubs and organizations: Organizations with whom
you volunteer, the church you attend, and profes-
sional associations may reveal facts such as your
address, age, income bracket, and how much money
you’ve donated.
➟Newspapers: If you’ve been featured in a newspaper
article, you may be surprised to find the story, along
with a picture of you or information about your work,
activities, or family, by doing a simple online search.
If you’re interviewed, ask for the chance to review the
information that the newspaper will include, and 
be sure that you’re comfortable with exposing that
information.
➟
139
Chapter 7: Sharing Your Information with Others

➟Online directories: Services such as www.white
pages.com or www.anywho.com, shown in Figure
7-2, list your phone number and address, unless you
specifically request that these be removed. You may
be charged a small fee associated with removing your
information — a so-called privacy tax — but you may
find the cost worthwhile. Online directories often
include the names of members of your family, your
e-mail address, the value of your home, your neigh-
bors’ names and the values of their homes, an online
mapping tool to provide a view of your home, driving
directions to your home, and your age. The record
may also include previous addresses, schools you’ve
attended, and links for people to run background
checks on you.
Figure 7-2
Online directories publicize personal information
➟
140
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

Because services get new information from many
sources, you’ll need to check back periodically to see if
your information has again been put online — if it
has, contact the company or go through their removal
process again.
Try entering your home phone number in any
browser’s address line; chances are you’ll get an online
directory listing with your address and phone number
(although this doesn’t work for cell phone numbers).
Understand How Information Is Spread and Collected
Sharing personal information with friends and family enriches your
relationships and helps you build new ones. The key is to avoid sharing
information with the wrong people and shady companies because, just
as in the real world, exposing your personal information online is one
of your biggest risks.
Criminals come in all flavors, but the more savvy ones collect informa-
tion in a very systematic way. Each piece of information is like another
drop of water that, over time, collects to form a very clear picture of
your life. And after criminals collect and organize the information, they
never throw it away because they may be able to use it many times over.
Fortunately, information exposure is a risk you have a great deal of con-
trol over. Before sharing information, make sure that you’re comfort-
able with how the recipient will use each type.
➟Address and phone number: Abuse of this informa-
tion results in you receiving increased telemarketing
calls and junk mail. Although less common, this
information may also increase a scammer’s ability to
steal your identity and make your home a more inter-
esting target for break-ins.
➟Names of husband/wife, father, and mother
(including mother’s maiden name), siblings, chil-
dren, and grandchildren: This information is very ➟
141
Chapter 7: Sharing Your Information with Others

interesting to criminals, who can use it to gain your
confidence and then scam you, or use it to guess your
passwords or secret question answers, which often
include family members’ names. This information
may also expose additional family members to ID
theft, fraud, and personal harm.
➟Information about your car: Limit access to license
plate numbers; VINs (vehicle identification numbers);
registration information; make, model, and title num-
ber of car; your insurance carrier’s name, coverage
limits, loan information, and driver’s license number.
The key criminal abuse of this information includes
car theft (or theft of parts of the car) and insurance
fraud. The type of car you drive may also indicate
your financial status, and that adds one more piece of
information to the pool of data criminals collect
about you.
➟Information about work history: In the hands of
criminals, your work history can be very useful for
“authenticating” the fraudster and convincing people
and organizations to provide them with more of your
financial records or identity.
➟Information about your credit status: This informa-
tion can be abused in so many ways that any time
you’re asked to provide this online, your answer
should be no. Don’t fall for the temptation to check
your credit scores for free through sites that aren’t
guaranteed reputable. Another frequent abuse of credit
information is found in free mortgage calculators that
ask you to put in all kinds of personal information in
order for them to determine what credit you qualify
for. See Chapter 13 for more about financial safety
online.
➟
142
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

Many people leave messages on their e-mail letting
people know when they’ll be away from their offices.
This is really helpful for colleagues, but exercise cau-
tion and limit who you provide the information to.
Leaving a message that says, “Gone 11/2-11/12. I’m
taking the family to Hawaii for ten days,” may make
you a prime target for burglary. And you’ll probably
never make the connection between the information
you exposed and the offline crime.
You may need to show your work history, particularly
on resumes you post on Internet job or business net-
working sites. Be selective about where you post this
information, create a separate e-mail account to list on
the resume, and tell what kinds of work you’ve done
rather than give specifics about which companies and
what dates. Interested, legitimate employers can then
contact you privately, and you won’t have given away
your life history to the world. After you’ve landed 
the job, take down your resume. Think of it as risk
management — when you need a job, the risk of infor-
mation exposure is less than the need to get the job.
Consider the Cumulative Effect
Every detail you or others share online about your life and the extended
group of people you interact with is stored somewhere. That information
may be copied, posted in other locations, and perhaps stay online for a
very, very long time. Understanding the way this information accumu-
lates, and how permanent that information may be, is critical.
Over the years, you may have built quite a profile of yourself through
items you and others have posted about you online, including the 
following:
➟Resumes
➟Blogs you’ve written
➟
143
Chapter 7: Sharing Your Information with Others

➟Comments in discussion groups
➟Information you’ve posted in wedding or baby reg-
istries (see Figure 7-3) or on grief sites
➟Articles you’ve published in your professional life
➟Government records
➟Friends’ Web sites
➟Clubs, church groups, and other organizations
Those who want to build a picture of you can work from all that infor-
mation and, potentially, offline sources of information. Before you
share information online, consider how sensitive the information may
be, how you’d feel if it was abused, and who (including which compa-
nies) you want to share the information with. 
Figure 7-3
Gift registries can expose personal information
➟
144
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

If the information is restricted to a site that isn’t avail-
able to the general public, has a strong password, and
respects your privacy, there should be little risk in
sharing with friends and family. If the information is
something you’re comfortable sharing with the gen-
eral public, feel free to do so. However, if the informa-
tion identifies you, your possessions, or someone else
in some way, you may want to limit access to that
information or not post it at all.
Find Yourself Online
Start by getting an idea of what information about you is online. Make
sure you’re using a browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox that
shows you if the Web sites that appear in your search results are legiti-
mate by including a ranking icon and information about level of risk
for activities such as frequency of downloaded malware. Or make sure
that you have a product such as McAfee Site Advisor installed.
1. Navigate to your favorite search engine, such as www.
google.com, and enter your name in the search field. 
2. Click the Go or Search button (depending on your
browser) to search for your information.
3. In the results (see Figure 7-4), ignore any listing that obvi-
ously isn’t you. If you see a listing that might concern you,
and your browser/site adviser considers the link safe, click
it to open the Web page. Or you can enter the site URL in
your browser address field to go there.
4. Scan the contents to see what information about you is
displayed and evaluate whether you’re comfortable with
that information online. In some cases, you may want to
request that the site owner removes part or all of your
information.
➟
145
Chapter 7: Sharing Your Information with Others

Figure 7-4
5. Click the Back button (the left-pointing arrow) to go 
back to the search results and continue to review listings
about you.
You should use at least a couple of search engines (such as Yahoo!,
Google, Ask.com, and so on), as they’re likely to find slightly different
results. In addition, use online directories, such as www.white
pages.com and www.anywho.com, to search for your address 
information.
Visit government sites that might list information about family mar-
riages, births, and deaths, home purchases, property tax, school records,
and powers of attorney.
If you find listings you want to ask a site to remove, find and click the
Contact Us link on the site and submit an e-mail requesting that the
information be removed. Not every site will do this, but it’s worth a try
if the information reveals too much about you. Persistence helps.
You may want to build a list of sites that contain
information about you, and you can easily do this
within your browser by bookmarking (saving) the
Look for your name in the search results
➟
146

links to those sites. In Internet Explorer, for example,
use the Add to Favorites tool to save any open Web
site addresses so you can find them again easily.
You may not be able to convince government sites to
remove all information from public access (by law,
some information is public), but no law says that it
has to be online. For many people, these records con-
tain far more information than is legally required, and
all too often the records contain information that can
place you at economic and personal risk. At the very
least, when you know what information about you is
public, you’ll be much less likely to fall for requests
from people who seem legitimate just because they
know some of your personal information.
Respect Other People’s Information
You know what’s okay to say about your friends in the physical world,
but consider some differences in talking to, or about, others online.
➟The first thing to consider is who will see your words
online. In face-to-face conversations, you see who
you’re talking to and modify your comments to fit the
situation. Over the phone, you know who’s on the
call and can do the same. Online, however, you may
or may not know who will read what you say because
recipients forward e-mails, a friend may change per-
missions for accessing a social networking page, and
so on.
➟If someone else’s site (or your site) is locked down to
just friends you both know, you can use the same
considerations as you would face-to-face or over the
phone.
➟If you don’t know who else may see the interaction,
you have to assume that anyone can see it; respect
your friends’ privacy as you would expect them to
➟
147
Chapter 7: Sharing Your Information with Others

respect yours. It’s rude to expose information about
someone — including pictures and videos — without
permission.
How do you know what information your friends and
family are willing to expose? It’s low tech, but the
only way you’ll know what they want kept private is
to ask them; and the only way for them to know what
you want private is to tell them.
Spot How People Expose Others
You may be surprised to discover how much you may inadvertently
expose about others, especially on social networking sites, which host
personal journals that often contain mention of people other than the
author. Figure 7-5 shows a public social networking site of a woman
who made her profile anonymous. She didn’t give her name, used a
photo of her cat instead of herself, didn’t provide her age or city, and
mentioned only her state. But three comments by friends completely
exposed her. Read through these postings to her blog and find the
information that was exposed:
➟Her name is Blanche O’Connelly, her birthdate is July
16th, and she turns 66 in 2009.
➟You know where her party is going to be held, where
she lives, and the name of the hospital where she vol-
unteers. (Her state combined with the hospital name
gives it away.)
➟You know where to find her and how to identify her.
(She’ll be with her friend, and you know what her
friend looks like.)
➟A friend has also provided her telephone number.
➟In addition, all of these friends have photos of
Blanche on their sites — you know who Blanche is
because the photo captions show her name.
➟
148
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

That’s a lot of information to expose about someone who went to great
lengths to remain private. There are two problems here: Although
Blanche did a lot to protect her privacy, she didn’t tell her friends that
her privacy was important to her, and Blanche’s friends were disrespect-
ful by posting identifiable information about her without first learning
her privacy boundaries.
Figure 7-5
Use Discussion Boards
A discussion board is a place where you can post written messages, pic-
tures, and videos on a topic. Others can reply to you, and you can reply
to their postings.
Discussion boards are asynchronous, which means that you post a mes-
sage (just as you might on a bulletin board at the grocery store) and
wait for a response. Somebody might read it that hour — or ten days or
several weeks after you make the posting. In other words, the response
isn’t instantaneous, and the message isn’t usually directed to a specific
individual.
You can find a discussion board about darn-near every topic under the
sun, and these are tremendously helpful when you’re looking for➟
149
Chapter 7: Sharing Your Information with Others

answers. They’re also a great way to share your expertise — whether you
chime in on how to remove an ink stain, provide history trivia about
button styles on military uniforms, or announce the latest break-
throughs in your given field. Postings are likely to stay up on the site
for years for people to reference.
1. To try one, enter this URL in your browser address field:

2. On the left side of the screen, click English (or another

4. When you click a posting that has replies, you’ll see that
they are organized in the middle of page in easy-to-follow

ments as they add their ideas to the entire conversation.

Participate in Chat
A chat room is an online space where groups of people can talk back
and forth via text, audio, Web camera, or a combination of media. (See
Figure 7-8, which shows a Web site that links to hundreds of chat

rooms.) In chat, you’re having a conversation with one or more people
in real time, and your entire conversation appears in the chat window.
Here are some characteristics of chat you should know:
➟When the chat is over, unless you save a copy, the
conversation is typically gone.
➟Interactions are in real time (synchronous), which
means you can interact with others in the moment.
➟Several people can interact at once, although this can
take getting used to as you try to follow what others
are saying and jump in with your own messages.
➟When you find a chat you want to participate in, you
simply enter the chat room, enter your message, and
submit it. It shows up in the stream of comments and
others may — or may not — reply to it.
When you’re talking to someone in a chat room that
multiple people are visiting, you can, if you’d like
invite him to enter a private chat room, which keeps
the rest of the folks who wandered into the chat room
out of your conversation. Also, others can invite you
into private chat rooms. Be careful who you interact
with in this way, and be sure you understand the
motivations for making your conversation private.
This may be entirely reasonable, or it may be 
that you’re dealing with someone with suspect 
motivations.
Before you get started, check out the Web site’s Terms
of Use, privacy, and monitoring and abuse reporting
procedures to understand the safety protections in
place before joining a conversation. Some sites are
well monitored for signs of abusive content or interac-
tions; others have no monitoring at all. If you don’t
like the terms, find a different site.

Contribute to Social Journaling Sites
Social journaling sites are like collective blogs in real time, in that they
ask everybody visiting to throw in their two cents, often about a specific
question such as “What are you doing right now?” The Web site might
show the various comments in a moving timeline, as on Plurk.com.
(See Figure 7-9.)
Consider these safety tips when using social journaling sites:
➟As with other social networking types of sites, be care-
ful about the profile you create for yourself when you
join and how much information it gives away.
➟Don’t reveal too much personal information in your
publicly viewable comments. This is harder to do
than you might imagine because little bits of informa-
tion add up. One time you say, “I’m headed out for
my Pilates class,” and the reader notices it’s Tuesday ➟
153
Chapter 7: Sharing Your Information with Others

at 6:15 p.m. You probably have the class every week
at that time. Another comment says, “Volunteering 
for Emily’s class at Carl Sandburg,” and the time is
11:15 a.m. A reader learns that you volunteer and you
know a little girl (probably related) at a specific ele-
mentary school. Between friends, this intimacy can be
a wonderful exchange, but with the public, it quickly
represents a level of risk you may not welcome.
➟These sites often ask you to see if your friends are on
online; they do this by searching your e-mail contacts
database, which gives them access to all your family,
friends and acquaintances.

See Chapter 8 for more about social networking and
blogs.
One of the most popular companies  offering this
functionality are Twitter (elite users are called the
Twitterati). Nearly a thousand entries were received for
Twitter’s first haiku writing contest in November 2008.
On average, most people have about 10 people follow-
ing their comments, and they follow about 10 other
people’s comments themselves.
Send and Receive Instant Messages (IMs)
Instant messaging (often called just IMing) used to be referred to as real-
time e-mail. It used to onlybe synchronous, meaning that two (or more)
parties could communicate in real time, without any delay. It still offers
synchronous communication, but now you can also leave a message
that the recipient can pick up later.
Instant messaging is a great way to stay in touch with the younger gen-
erations, who rarely use e-mail. IM is ideal for quick little messages
where you just want an answer without forming a formal e-mail, as
well as for touching base and saying hi. Text messaging on cell phones
is largely the same phenomena: This isn’t a tool you’d typically use for
a long, meaningful conversation, but it’s great for quick exchanges.
Depending on the IM service you use, you can do the following:
➟Write notes to friends, grandchildren, or whoever, as
long as they use the same IM service that you’re using.
➟Talk as if you were on the phone.
➟Send photos, videos, and other files.
➟
155
Chapter 7: Sharing Your Information with Others

➟Use little graphical images, called emoticons (such as
smilies or winks) and avatars, to add fun to your IM
messages.
➟See participants via Web cameras.
➟Get and send e-mail.
➟Search the Web, find others using Global Positioning
System (GPS) technology, listen to music, watch
videos, play games, bid on auctions, find dates, 
and more.
➟Track the history of conversations and even save tran-
scripts of them to review later.
Instant messaging programs vary somewhat, and you have several to
choose from, including Windows Live Messenger (available at http://
download.live.com/?sku=messenger), Yahoo! Messenger (avail-
able at http://messenger.yahoo.com), and AOL Instant
Messenger, also know as AIM, (available at www.aim.com).
To get started with a new messaging program, you need to follow the
general steps in the upcoming list. But as with any software, if you
aren’t sure how to use its features, consult its Help documentation for
specific instructions.
1. Download and install the messaging program according
to the instructions on the provider’s Web site.
2. Set up an account and sign in; this may simply involve
entering your e-mail address and password.
You can send IMs from a computer to a mobile phone
(and vice versa) and from one mobile phone to
another. If you include your mobile phone number as
➟
156
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

part of your IM profile, anyone who can see your pro-
file can view it. This is useful information for friends
and criminals, so it’s important to consider whether
you want your number exposed — especially if you
have many people on your contact list who you don’t
personally know.
3. Click a contact to initiate your conversation. (You can
import contacts from your e-mail contacts when you sign
up, or you can add them yourself.)
4. Click the phone button or icon to initiate a phone call.
IM programs let your contacts see when you’re 
online, unless you change your settings to hide this
information — something that’s good to know when
you’re busy and don’t have time to chat. You can
choose availability settings such as Online, Busy, Be
Right Back, Out to Lunch, or even display your status
as Offline, even when you aren’t. In the Windows Live
Messenger IM program shown in Figure 7-10, click the
arrow next to your name to access such a list.
IM is one place where people use shortcut text. Some
of this will be familiar to you, such as FYI (for your
information) and ASAP (as soon as possible). Other
short text may be less familiar, such as LOL (laughing
out loud). Visit http://look-both-ways.com/
stayingsafe/IM.htm#having_trouble for 
a table of common shortcut text terms. Knowing 
these will make communicating with younger folks
more fun.

➟
158
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

Deciding to share your photo depends on whether
you talk to friends only, and how you feel about hav-
ing your photo publicly available. Consider what your
photo tells people about you, including your age, eth-
nic background, identifiable objects in the back-
ground, economic status, and so on.
➟Consider who you want to use IM with. You create
buddy lists in instant messaging programs and enter
the online addresses of people with whom you want
to exchange instant messages. Most services allow you
to block messages from anyone not on your buddy
list. (See Figure 7-11.) Remember: A friend of a friend
is often a stranger.
Figure 7-11
➟
159
Chapter 7: Sharing Your Information with Others

➟Sending photos, documents, and links in IM is an
easy and convenient way to share with others. Just
think twice before opening attachments or clicking
links in instant messages. Make sure that you know
the sender, are communicating with that person at the
time, or are expecting the material. Links or attach-
ments sent out of context may indicate that the
sender’s IM has been infected with a virus, and open-
ing the attachments or clicking the links will then
infect you and send the virus to all of the people in
your address book. There are many things that are
great to share; computer viruses aren’t.
➟Understand that IM isn’t a totally secure communica-
tion channel. Your conversation will probably never
be snooped on, but for safety’s sake, don’t share sensi-
tive personal information such as passwords, social
security numbers, credit card information, and the
like in IM messages.
➟Be careful about the information you show in your
status bar, where you can leave short messages and
show your mood. Avoid showing emotions to people
you don’t know well. Don’t expose yourself to bur-
glary by saying that you’re headed out of town on a
specific date. 
➟Most services allow you to keep your online status
private so that you simply appear to be offline. But of
course, that means your friends don’t know when
you’re online either.
➟You may get an invitation to join someone else’s IM
buddy list, or a request to add someone to your
buddy list. Before adding people to your list or join-
ing other people’s lists, be sure you know who they
are. Many scammers use names that make you feel
comfortable. Once added, they send spim (IM spam)
and malicious links, or they try to gain your trust for
confidence tricks — or flood you with pornography.
➟
160
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

➟If you use a Web camera with IM, be careful that you
don’t expose visual information to a stranger, such 
as the location of your home or office, images of 
your home that expose your financial status, or your
possessions.
➟If anyone sends you inappropriate material, report it.
If you need to document the material to report it to
the police, don’t shut down the computer; instead,
minimize the application or turn off the monitor only
and seek advice on how to report the occurrence.
Inform your ISP (Internet service provider) and the
police, if appropriate.
➟Be cautious about meeting up with someone you
know only through IM. If you decide to meet some-
one, never go alone, meet in a busy public place, and
make sure your loved ones know where you’re going
and when to expect to hear from you. Always have
your cell phone handy.
➟Think about how to use the IM features safely. For
example, some IM games may contain mature mate-
rial, and you might want to limit voice and video
interactions with people you haven’t met.
➟One great feature that also has great risk in IM is the
ability to give someone else remote access to your
computer. This is great if you need help fixing some-
thing that isn’t working. Just make sure that you
totally trust the person you’re giving access to.
Remember that you need to trust two things: that she
won’t make the problem worse and that she won’t
snoop through everything you’ve stored on your com-
puter. Never give anyone but the most trusted individ-
uals this kind of access to your computer via IM.
➟Report harassment or bullying to your IM service
provider. As in real life, this is unacceptable behavior,
and in some cases, it can be illegal. Every service
➟
161
Chapter 7: Sharing Your Information with Others

should have a clearly visible Report Abuse function
(see Figure 7-12); if it doesn’t consider switching
providers. If you feel physically threatened, contact
your local law enforcement agency immediately.
Consider what you’re saying and sharing in IM and
how you’d feel if the information was made public.
IM allows you to store your conversation history,
which is super useful if you need to go back and check
something that was said. But it has its downside.
Anything you include in IM can be forwarded to oth-
ers.  If you’re at work, keep in mind that many
employers monitor IM (and e-mail) conversations.
If you run across illegal content — such as child
pornography — downloading or continuing to view
this for any reason is illegal. Report the incident to
law enforcement immediately.

he Internet provides rich opportunities for

old friends, finding romance, and sharing
interests with others . . . but there are some
risks to think about.
When you meet a person offline, you have
visual clues as to her age, gender, and general

assess social contacts, and you have to be cau-
tious about how much you expose about your-
self before you’re sure who you’re dealing with.
Whether you’re posting a blog (online journal)
on a social networking site (which is a category
of Web site where people share their thoughts,
images, or videos) or using a dating site, you
may encounter risks from individual predators
who want to take advantage of your emotions
or steal your money. You might also unwit-
tingly provide information to companies who
want to mine your data. They might use this
data for marketing campaigns directed at you
and/or sell your data to others.

Although teens make up a large percentage of social networkers, they
aren’t the largest user segment. In fact, millions of adults and seniors
are also active on social networking sites. Some social networking sites
exist for very specific purposes — such as creating business contacts —
but most of the popular sites offer a wide variety of functionality. These
sites are likely to host blogs, photo and video albums, classified ads,
forums, e-mail, instant messaging, and entertainment.
Social networking sites allow people to build and maintain online net-
works of friends and others with common interests. They open up great
new opportunities to share, communicate, and meet new people.
However, social networking products and services have widely different
levels of protections for consumers, and it’s important that you under-
stand the safety and privacy protection of any service you choose to use.
In this chapter, you discover some of the things you can do to stay safe
as you roam social sites.
Overview of Collaborative and Social Networking Sites
Although you may think kids are the most active group using social
networking, you can see from the table in Figure 8-1 that it isn’t the
case. In fact, persons 35–54 years old make up the largest segment of
social networkers.
There are several types of sites where people collaborate or communi-
cate socially. The following definitions may be useful:
➟Wiki: A Web site that allows anyone visiting to con-
tribute (add, edit, or remove) content. Wikipedia, for
example, is a virtual encyclopedia built by users pro-
viding information in their areas of expertise. Because
of the ease of collaboration, wikis are often used
when developing group projects or sharing informa-
tion collaboratively.
➟
164
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

➟Blog: An online journal (blog is short for web log) that
may be entirely private, open to select friends or fam-
ily, or available to the general public. You can usually
adjust your blog settings to restrict visitors from com-
menting on your blog entries, if you’d like.
➟Social networking site: This type of Web site (see
Figure 8-2) allows people to build and maintain
online Web pages and create networks of people that
they’re somehow connected to — their friends, work
associates, and/or other members with similar inter-
ests. Most social networking sites also host blogs and
have social networking functions that allow people to
view information about others and contact each
other.

Tips for Safe Blogging
Simply put, blogs are online journals. Just as with any journal, the blog
owner (or blogger) can hold forth on any subject he or she wants to, in
words, photos, or videos. But unlike traditional journals, entries can
also include videos, links to Web sites, search tools, and quizzes.
Depending on your settings and the site’s privacy policy, millons of
people may view your blog. 
Each blog entry usually contains a title, a date stamp, the blogger’s
name, and the blogger’s comments. (See Figure 8-3.) It may also
include a profile of the author and a photo or videos.
Here are 12 steps to take to stay safe while blogging:
➟Make sure the blogging site you use has clear privacy
and security policies and outlines how the site will
respond to reports of abuse. The site should offer site
monitors and tools to help protect your safety, such
➟
166
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

as a way to control who has permission to see your
blog, the ability to block harassing users, and a setting
that allows you to turn coments off.
➟Read the terms and conditions of the blog site. (See
Figure 8-4.) Even some of the most popular blog and
social networking sites have clauses that give the serv-
ice the right to use anything you post in any way they
choose. Choose a service that respects your right to
own your content and keep your privacy.
➟Think carefully about how public you want your blog
to be. If your blog isn’t set to private, anyone can visit
and possibly comment on what you’re saying or post-
ing. Most blog sites default to public access, and you
have to change the setting to make your blog private.

Chapter 8: Getting the Most from Social Networks and Blogging

Figure 8-4
The more personal or identifiable the information
you share, the fewer people you should share it with.
If you choose to make your blog public, disclose only
information that you want anyone and everyone in
the world to know.
➟Periodically review who has access to your site and
make changes if necessary. Friends change over time,
and once-trusted people may become less trusted.
➟Keep identifying details to yourself and close friends.
• Think carefully before using your real name on
your site (or anyone else’s real name, either).
Create a nickname or screen name that doesn’t
attract the wrong kind of attention or allow some-
one to find you.
• Be cautious about giving information that puts you
on the map. Don’t mention such details as your
address, where you work, or even your town name
(especially if it’s a small town).
➟On blogs that are set to be viewable by the general
public, be smart about the photos you post. Consider
these things:
➟
168
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

• What’s in the background? Does the photo show
your house number, a street sign, a license plate, or
landmark?
• Did you caption your photos with full names or
other identifying details?
• What’s printed on your shirt? Don’t post photos that
show the name of your bowling team or crafts club.
• Who’s in the picture? If it shows friends or family
members, you may be putting them at risk, too.
• Can someone tell your economic status from the
photo? This may be an enticement for offline crime.
➟Be careful about sharing your feelings if your blog is
public. You can express feelings in your blog in vari-
ous ways. The poems you select, the music you list,
and the pictures you post all tell a lot about who you
are and how you feel. This allows a predator who’s on
the hunt to find opportunities to prey on your vulner-
ability. Whether what you reveal is greed, sadness,
anger, or even happiness, there is always a scam or
exploit that can be tailored to take advantage of it.
➟Check out what your friends write about you in their
blogs. They may be giving out your address or real
name or revealing which church you go to, or perhaps
they have a photo of you on their site with a caption
indicating who you are. Any of these actions may
enable someone to find you. Check the comments
friends leave on your blog to make sure they don’t
give away personal details.
➟Be very cautious about meeting in person someone
you know only through blogging. As with online
dates, keep first meetings with blogging buddies
short, and agree to meet in a public place during a
busy time of day.
➟
169
Chapter 8: Getting the Most from Social Networks and Blogging

➟If there’s a problem on your blog or on a blog that
includes information about you, report it immedi-
ately. No one has the right to threaten or upset you. If
anyone (even someone you know) behaves threaten-
ingly or asks lots of personal questions, report the
problem. Every service should make it easy to report
abuse; if your blogging service doesn’t, consider
switching providers.
➟Talk to your family about the kinds of information
they’re willing to make public and what they’d rather
keep private. Posting information about others isn’t
okay — in comments, photos, and so on — unless
they agree to share that information. When asking
permission to share, make clear who can see your site.
➟Before changing your settings to be more public, it’s
your obligation to again seek permission from all
people you may expose. If they aren’t comfortable
with additional exposure, remove any content about
them from your site.
Sign Up for a Social Networking Service
When signing up for a service, understand what is required information
and what is optional. You should clearly understand why a Web service
needs any of your personally identifiable information and how they
may use that information — before providing it. Consider carefully the
questions that sites ask users to complete in creating a profile.
Accepting a social networking service’s default settings
may expose more information than you intend.
Walk through the signup process for Eons, a senior social networking
site, to see the kinds of information they ask for. Follow these instruc-
tions to do so:

settings default to Everyone, allowing anyone on the site

11. Change any privacy settings you wish and click Save.
Remember that social networking sites sometimes ask
for information during signup that they use to provide
you with a customized experience that suits your
needs. But sometimes the information isn’t needed for
the service they’re providing you at all — they simply
want it for marketing purposes, to show to other
members, or to sell.
It’s often very difficult to remove information from
sites if you later regret the amount of information
you’ve shared. It’s best to be conservative in the infor-
mation you share during the signup process; you can
always add more later.

Spam and Other Malware on Blogs and Social Networks
Advertisers understand the value of blogs. Legitimate advertisers pay to
have their ads posted on the sites; disreputable advertisers often create
fake user profiles and blog sites for their marketing campaigns. These
run the gamut of legal to entirely illegal offers. These fake blog sites are
called splogs (splog is short for spam blog), and they can be an annoying
and potentially harmful form of spam.
Some splog ads appear as comments that get spammed onto social net-
working sites. These typically include links to sites that may place mal-
ware on your computer, or they may contain content that’s offensive to
you. This is a good reason for you to make settings to your blog so that
you can review and approve comments before they are posted, if such
settings are available. See Chapter 5 for more about spam and Chapter
15 for more about malware and how to protect your computer from it.
Understand Site Privacy Settings
Permission settings determine who has access to your and your family’s
information. These settings typically include the following:
➟Public: This setting allows every Internet user (more
than two billion people) to see your information.
➟Friends of friends: Allows your friends and their
friends to see your information. (See Figure 8-8 for
an example of how many people this might involve.)
Remember that the friend of a friend is likely to be a
stranger, so this setting is often the one that exposes
people the most. You may feel safe because visitors
are “friends,” but in reality, this setting can result in
thousands of people viewing the information.
➟Friends only: Selecting this setting means only the
people in your friends or buddies list can see all your
information.
➟
174

➟Private: This allows you to decide who (if anyone)
can see your information. Some people may choose
to keep their site entirely private and use it as their
personal diary.
Figure 8-8
Work towards an understanding about which information each person
involved with your blog or social network needs you to keep private for
safety reasons and which information each is comfortable sharing, and
with whom. You should have conversations with the following people:
➟Spouses and partners.
➟Family members and extended families.
➟Colleagues and employers.
➟Clubs, organizations, churches, charities, or other
groups that you’re affiliated with — or were affiliated
with in the past.

Meet Someone Safely Offline
If you decide to meet an online acquaintance offline, follow these
guidelines:
➟Meet in a safe environment, preferably a public place
during a busy time of day.
➟Keep the first meeting short.
➟Make sure somebody knows where you are.
➟Take a mobile phone with you.
➟If the person doesn’t look as he or she represented,
walk away.
➟If you have any problems, report the person to the
social site.
The advice we provide here applies no matter where
on the Internet you meeting someone. If you are
involved in online dating or considering taking the
leap, see Chapter 9 for more specific advice for using
dating services.
Online Quizzes and Surveys
Quizzes and surveys you find online, including those on social net-
working sites, are usually entertaining and may seem like a harmless
pastime. But quiz and survey companies are for-profit businesses.
Because consumer information is a commodity, you should assume
that anything you enter in quizzes and surveys is being sold. Some sites
➟
176
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

allow users to create their own quizzes and surveys, but in most cases,
the sites are still making money from the answers.
Just by reviewing the types of surveys or quizzes you take, a criminal
may learn a great deal. Answering whether you’re Hot or Not or a
Fashion Disaster or Diva provides not only businesses in the fashion or
teen magazine industries with information, it also provides information
to a potential predator about topics that interest you. Some quizzes and
your answers are displayed on your social networking sites, which is
something to consider carefully if your site is publicly viewable —
because your answers may expose personal information to a criminal.
Quizzes and surveys on senior social networking sites are typically
more financially or medically invasive. For example, the information
from a medical quiz may be passed directly to pharmaceutical compa-
nies, online drugstores, or insurance companies. (See Figure 8-9.) After
answering a quiz, you may find you receive spam targeted to your med-
ical conditions or financial interests, or have a health insurance policy
cancelled.
Figure 8-9
➟
177
Chapter 8: Getting the Most from Social Networks and Blogging

Make sure you understand the reputation, privacy policies, and terms of
use of the site creating or hosting the quizzes. Before taking any quiz or
survey, consider the answers to the following questions:
➟Why did the company create this quiz?
➟What will they do with the information?
➟Who will see my answers?
Report Abuse
If you experience abusive behavior as a result of your participation in a
Web site, it can help others if you report the abuse so that companies -
and, when needed, law enforcement — understand the potential for
online crime and act to improve conditions. If physical abuse occurs,
first help the victim get to safety and reassure them they will get help.
Then take these steps to report the crime and find help:
1. Report the abuse to your local law enforcement agency
and the Web site where you first encountered the predator.
2. Contact the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network
(RAINN, at www.rainn.org), the nation’s largest anti-
sexual assault organization. (See Figure 8-10.)
3. Consult the Department of Justice Web site
(www.usdoj.gov), which lists organizations in every
state that provide assistance to sexual abuse victims and
their families.

Dating Safely
Online
A
lthough you may never have thought
about using the Internet to find a partner,
the fact is that millions of people use online
dating services — or less formal online social
settings — to meet a mate. Seniors aren’t to be
left out of this; they use dating and social net-
working sites targeting seniors. These sites
often host chat or other ways to connect, flirt,
and discover others.
In this chapter, you find out how to use online
dating services safely as you search for the love
of your life (or a casual date), how to be aware
when you’re exposing your emotions, and how
a criminal — whether he’s after your money or
you — might take advantage.
How Online Dating Works
Here’s how you can jump into the world of
online dating:
➟Choose a reputable dating site. (See the

➟Sign up and provide information about your likes,
dislikes, preferences, and so on. This often takes the
form of a self-guided interview process. See Chapter 2
for advice about creating anonymous online aliases.
➟Create and modify your profile to both avoid expos-
ing too much personal information and ensure that
you’re sending the right message about yourself to
prospective dates. (Get more information about this
in Chapter 8 on social networking).
➟Use search features on the site (see Figure 9-1) to find
people who interest you and send them messages or
invitations to view your profile.
Figure 9-1
Indentify the type of people you’d like to meet
➟
182
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

➟You’ll get messages from other members of the site, to
which you can respond (or not). Use the site’s chat
and e-mail features to interact with potential dates.
You may also be able to read comments about the
person from others who’ve dated him or her, if the
site has that feature.
➟When you’re comfortable with the person and feel
there might be a spark, decide if you want to meet the
person offline. See the next section for detailed advice
about meeting an online acquaintance offline for the
first time.
Guidelines for Safer Online Dating
Millions of people of all ages have tried Internet dating services, such as
the one shown in Figure 9-2, as a way to meet new friends and possi-
bly find a lifelong partner. It’s a great way to get acquainted with people
you never would’ve met otherwise. When you do it with caution, online
dating may be safer, even, than meeting people in the real world
because you have more time to get to know the person before meeting
him or her in person.
Dating online requires that you take steps to protect yourself, including
these:
➟Learn the lingo. Online daters use some phrases with
specific meanings that go beyond the literal transla-
tions. For example someone who wants a “discreet”
relationship may be asking you to join him or her in
an extramarital affair. It’s important to understand any
subtext in the conversations, especially if you’re new to
online dating. You may want to just read entries for a
while to get used to what’s really being said.
➟
183
Chapter 9: Dating Safely Online

➟Be cautious about marital status. About 30 percent
of males on dating sites are, in fact, married and just
looking for something on the side. A certain number
of women may be doing the same. Be sure to ask
pointed questions.
➟Maintain anonymity to protect your identity. Don’t
include your full name, phone number, where you
work, or detailed location information in your profile
or during early communications with potential dates.
Stop communicating with anyone who presses you
for this type of information.
➟Be smart about choosing profile pictures. Make sure
your photos reflect what you want to say about your-
self. Provocative pictures may attract the wrong peo-
ple. Make sure that your images do not contain
identifying information such as nearby landmarks or
a shirt with your town’s name embroidered on it.
Figure 9-2
➟
184
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

➟Check to see if a potential date has a good reputa-
tion among other daters on the service.
➟Be realistic. Read the profiles of others with skepti-
cism. As you correspond or talk on the phone, ask
questions, seek direct answers, and note any inconsis-
tencies. Look for warning signs such as a display of
anger, an attempt to control you, disrespectful com-
ments, or any physically threatening or otherwise
unwelcome behavior. Rule of thumb: If they’re weird
online, they’ll be weirder in person.
➟Trust your instincts when interacting with a poten-
tial date. If something doesn’t feel right, cut off con-
tact. If a person becomes abusive, report it and block
that person (using your account settings) from con-
tacting you again.
➟When you decide to meet, create a safe environ-
ment. Keep first dates short, and agree to meet in a
public place during a busy time of day. Use your own
transportation. Make sure somebody knows where
you’re going. If your date doesn’t look like his or her
photo, walk away and report that person to the dating
service.
Formal dating sites aren’t the only places that people
meet online, but they typically have the best safe-
guards in place. If you want to interact with people
you meet on other sites, you should provide your own
safeguards. Create a separate e-mail account (so you
can remain anonymous and abandon the e-mail
address if needed). Many dating sites screen partici-
pants and provide strong reporting measures that are
missing on other types of sites, so be particularly care-
ful. Take your time getting to know someone first
before connecting.
➟
185
Chapter 9: Dating Safely Online

Select a Dating Service
Select your online dating service carefully.
➟Look for an established, popular site with plenty of
members and a philosophy that matches your own.
➟Review the site’s policy regarding your privacy and its
procedures for screening members. Make sure you’re
comfortable with them.
➟Use a service that provides an e-mail system that you
use for contacting other members only (sometimes
called private messaging). By using the site’s e-mail
rather than your own e-mail address, you can main-
tain your privacy.
➟Some sites, such as http://saferdates.com,
shown in Figure 9-3, offer stronger levels of authenti-
cating members. Safer Dates, for example, uses finger-
print identification and screening to make you more
confident that you know who you’re interacting with.
➟Visit a site such as www.onlinedatingtips.org
for comparisons of sites. Whether you choose a sen-
ior-specific dating site such as DatingForSeniors.com
or a general population site such as PerfectMatch.
com, reading reviews about them ahead of time will
help you make the best choice.
If you try a site and experience an unpleasant incident
involving another member, report it and make sure
the service follows through to enforce its policies. If it
doesn’t, find another service.

Avoid Emotional Exposure
The Internet, and particularly dating sites, blogs, and social networking
sites, are wonderful outlets for emotional sharing and building and
maintaining friendships, but when you find yourself experiencing
extremes of joy or grief, consider carefully what you share online. Just
as there are offline criminals who read birth, graduation, wedding, and
obituary announcements in newspapers to find vulnerable people to
target, there are online criminals watching as you post information
about your feelings and significant life events. Be careful when using
sites that reveal your emotional condition and potential vulnerability.
(See Figure 9-4 for an example of site where members express grief over
a lost or ill pet.)
➟
187
Chapter 9: Dating Safely Online

Figure 9-4
The joy of a wedding or the arrival of a new grandchild may inspire
individuals to share information on wedding sites and baby registries
that they would otherwise keep private. People may post pictures, full
names, locations, dates, and a great deal more. Your daughter, for exam-
ple, may join a baby registry site. If she puts your names in the
Grandparents field and states that her parents are coming east for the
birth on such and such a date, it may put your home at risk of a bur-
glary. This kind of sharing may also help criminals identify and target
you for ID theft or financial scams.
There are four simple guidelines for safely sharing strong emotions,
from grief to joy, in any online socializing. Always do these things:
➟Learn whether the Web site allows you to make
some (or all) information private.
➟Review the information fields and a few sample
pages to see what material is typically displayed. To
get an idea of what does and doesn’t seem appropriate
➟
188
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

to share, review other people’s postings and look for
risks to which they may have inadvertently exposed
themselves.
➟Make a conscious choice about whether you want
the site to have restricted (only those whom you
allow) or public (available to anyone) access. Then
you can decide what information you want to provide.
➟Let others know your safety boundaries so they can
share with you on the site in a way that respects
your wishes. And take the time to learn other’s
restrictions so that you’re respectful of their safety and
privacy.
➟Think about using a friend as a safety check. When
you’re caught up in joy or grief, safety may be the last
thing on your mind. Asking a friend to monitor the
site for risks — so that you can concentrate on what
matters to you in the moment — is a great way to let
others help.
➟Create a unique e-mail address if you put contact
information online. That way, if the account ends up
getting too much spam, you can shut it down without
compromising your main e-mail account.
Understand How Criminals Groom Victims
Criminals, unfortunately, are an unpleasant fact of life. The idea that
criminals are online is concerning, but there is a large gap between the
sensational way that news reports present facts and the reality. With
some simple steps, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling vic-
tim to online crimes.
Criminal grooming occurs when criminals interact with potential victims
to create an environment of trust that enables crime. Criminals may do
➟
189
Chapter 9: Dating Safely Online

this to gain your trust for a confidence trick or to get access to your
financial holdings or belongings. A person may pretend to be a friend
to more effectively cyberbully or smear your reputation.
In rarer cases, grooming may be aimed at physically or sexually exploit-
ing the victim. Although the group most at risk for sexual predation 
is teens between the ages of 13 and 15, adults and seniors can also be
targets.
As a senior, you may be at risk for criminal grooming in several ways,
including the following:
➟A financial predator may create a trusted relationship
as a way to get at your money.
➟An online dating or other connection may turn out to
be physically threatening in an in-person meeting.
➟A criminal may use information you post online to
approach another family member — your child or
grandchild, for example.
Criminals who attempt to groom or socially engineer their victims
share some common tactics:
➟They try to gain your trust by indicating common
interests or claiming common friends or organiza-
tions. (They gather most of this information through
reading information that you, or others, have posted
online and through communications with you
designed to elicit this information.)
➟Criminals often act generous in ways that cost them
nothing. They may be liberal with praise and virtual
gifts, such as sending you e-cards or photos to win
you over. If a gift is well received, they may begin
offering real gifts to make you feel further indebted.
➟
190
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

➟Groomers look for emotional or character 
weaknesses — if you’re lonely, they want to be your
friend; if you’re sad, they’ll cheer you up, if you’re in
need of money they have a get-rich-quick scheme.
➟If they can, criminals may attempt to drive a wedge
between you and the people in your support network
because if you feel estranged from others you will be
easier to manipulate and they are more likely to suc-
ceed in their goal.
➟Over time, a criminal will subtly seek information that
gives clues to your social standing, your financial assets,
your location, and so on. This may come in the form
of asking advice, including these types of questions:
• I’m unhappy with my current bank; what bank do 
you use?
• I’m tired of living in the Midwest; why did you pick
the town where you live?
• E-mailing is so cumbersome. Here’s my phone
number; let’s talk sometime. (The person will see
your number on caller ID when you call.)
➟Another method criminals use is to gain your sympa-
thy by telling you of their own hardships, with the
end game of asking you for a loan, or exploiting you
in some other way. 
Anyone who’s been around the block a couple of times knows that con
artists use a thousand angles to elicit information — and that you have
to be on guard against these tactics. Always ask yourself, “What is moti-
vating this question or action?”
If a date or other online acquaintance asks you for a
loan or any financial information, no matter how sad
the hard-luck story, it’s virtually always a scam. Block
further contact and report it.

the form of games, gambling, music,
socializing, TV shows, and blockbuster movies.
The ease of access and low price of these diver-
sions (from free to a few dollars) is appealing.
But you have to be aware of your responsibili-

Play a World of Games Online 
Playing games online is entertaining, allows
you to connect with others, helps maintain
your mental fitness, and relieves stress. Here’s
some basic information about playing online
games to get you started.
➟Some games are Web games — you play
them on the Internet only — while other
games require you to download a client
(a piece of software that you need to play
a game online) or even the whole game
to your computer.

➟Some games are installed on your cell phone; others
require game consoles. Some games cross multiple
device environments.
➟You aren’t likely to break anything. For some reason,
many adults are very hesitant about playing games on
dedicated gaming devices, because they seem to think
they’re going to break something. In reality, gaming
devices are sturdy and in a legitimate game you aren’t
going to get you into trouble, so press all the buttons,
move all the levers, and try all the features — Worst
case? You lose the game.
➟You can find a broad range of online games, from
simple games you play against the service (such as
Solitaire, shown in Figure 10-1) to two-person games
such as chess and checkers that you play with a friend
or against the service, to highly interactive games that
you can play with thousands of people at a time in
enormous fantasy worlds. (See Figure 10-2.)
➟A 2008 study by NPD Group notes that 72 percent of
Americans have played online games. Contrary to
popular belief, the average player of casual games isn’t
a teen — it’s the teen’s mother or grandmother. 71
percent of survey respondents were 40 years or older,
76 percent of them female.

Safely Gaming Online
Before you dive into the world of online gaming, consider these basic
safety issues:
➟Make sure you’re using a reputable site or software.
MSN Games, for example, allows you to choose free
online games, for-pay online games, downloadable
games, and games you play within MSN Messenger.
➟If you want to interact with other players, but don’t
personally know them, set up a safe profile with
nicknames, usernames, and gamer tags that don’t
identify you. Consider what information about your-
self you want to share — including name, photos,
location, e-mail address, and so on.
➟Understand the game’s rating. (If it doesn’t show
one, it’s probably for general audiences.) The
Entertainment Software Rating Board provides ratings
for downloadable and purchased games. Take a look
at Figure 10-3 to see the rating icons used by ESRB.
The ratings help parents (and grandparents) supervise
kids’ online gaming; but they are equally useful in
helping you identify games you find appropriate for
your own use. Other countries have their own version
of ESRB ratings. (For more information on ESRB’s sys-
tem, go to www.esrb.org.)
➟Review the site’s Terms and Conditions to under-
stand what types of behavior it allows. This docu-
ment should also state the site’s policies and practices
for monitoring behavior and responding to abuse.
(See Figure 10-4 for an example of a typical Terms
and Conditions statement for a gaming site.)
➟Be alert to inappropriate comments or suggestions
on chats and messages you receive. Let the game site
know if anything makes you uncomfortable, includ-
ing requests for your real name or location.
➟
196
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

➟Report any abuse and, if needed, block the abuser
from further contact.
Now . . . have fun!
Getting to know new people online is a great way to
expand your social circle, but be cautious about trust-
ing or meeting someone you’ve met only through
online gaming. Keep personal information private,
and if you choose to meet, keep first meetings short.
Meet in a public place during a busy time of day with
people present. Let people know where you’re going
and when to expect a call from you. Always bring a
cell phone.
Some gamers are very poor sports when they lose, and
some are cyberbullies. If you experience anyone who
is insulting or abusive, use the game settings to block
further contact and notify the service.

Figure 10-4
Select a Gaming Site
A great deal of what keeps you safe playing online games involves
selecting a site that’s respectable and safeguards its users. Safe, in this
case, involves a site that won’t download malware, has good policies
about behavior on the site, and enforces those policies.
Consider these issues when determining whether a site is safe:
➟If you play online or download games for your com-
puter from reputable sites such as Yahoo! Games,
MSN Zones, and AOL Games (see Figure 10-5), you
run very little risk of any harm.
➟If you aren’t familiar with a site’s reputation, search
online for trustworthy gaming sites by searching on
reviews of games.
All gaming sites should list their Terms and Conditions
➟
198
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

Figure 10-5
➟Trustworthy sites make a clear distinction between
what they provide for free (without hidden clauses or
malware threats) and what you pay for.
➟If you use a less well-known site, you should check
the fine print first. If a gaming site is free, ask yourself
what its getting in return. Is it just the ability to place
ads in front of you, or does it reserve the right to sell
your information to others?
➟If you use a search engine to find online games, do
not assume that sponsored gaming sites in search
results are safe. A sponsored site is one in which the
company specifically pays a search engine to put it at
the top of the list of results. This does not guarantee
quality or safety. A McAfee study of search engine
safety found that sponsored results are still two-and-
a-half times more likely to return risky Web sites than
non-sponsored results.
Spam e-mails or shady Web sites that offer free games
might ask you to fill out extensive profiles. They may
then sell the information you provide in those profiles. ➟
199
Chapter 10: Being Entertained Online

These e-mails and Web sites may also download mal-
ware and adware to your computer. Be alert and avoid
clicking links in e-mail or using gaming sites unless
you trust the source.
Play Console Games
Not all games are played on a computer. Many are played on other
devices, called game consoles, like Microsoft’s Xbox (see Figure 10-6),
Nintendo’s Wii, and others. These consoles typically plug into a TV to
give you a large screen for interacting.
Figure 10-6
Here are the basics on console games:
➟Many game consoles can be enabled with Internet
connectivity, but they don’t have to be. Connecting
online allows you to interact with other players out-
side your home, even around the world. This gives
➟
200
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

you a great opportunity to play against many new
people, but of course, it carries with it the same types
of risks you can face in other interactive online envi-
ronments.
➟Having an Internet connection allows you to down-
load new games and game demos directly, instead of
purchasing games in stores or shopping online from
your computer.
It’s important to remember that other players may or
may not be who they claim to be, so take care not to
provide personal information. 
Report any obnoxious or offensive behavior to the
game company.
➟In the past, most console games were like computer
games where you just sat still and played. Now, many
games get you up and moving to exercise at whatever
level you’re comfortable with. You can play golf or
tennis, bowl, ski, play baseball, practice your balance,
or work out with your own virtual trainer right in your
living room. And the games are a lot of fun to play. In
fact, they are so engaging and entertaining that many
seniors (and senior centers, retirement communities,
and retirement homes) are buying game consoles as a
great way to motivate activity, strengthen bones,
loosen joints, and increase eye-hand coordination.
With an emphasis on gentle motions, balance, and
coordination wrapped in appealing games, you can
play lots of console sports without throwing your back
out or risking other injury. The games also encourage
a bit of fun competition and socializing among
friends, and they’re a great way to bond with grand-
children of all ages.
➟

Play Games on Handheld Devices
You’ve seen kids playing with handheld devices such as Game Boy,
Sony PSP, and Nintendo DS, but these easy to take with you devices
have lots to offer seniors as well. Most handheld devices can connect
with other players, and interact with other devices in your nearby vicin-
ity so you can play with other gamers. If used to play with people in
your vicinity that you do not know, these devices carry the same types
of risks you can face in other interactive online environments and the
same precautions should be taken.
With great games like Tetris, any number of card games, Sudoku, and
more, these devices provide lots of entertainment while you’re sitting in
your dentist’s or doctor’s waiting room, or waiting for a bus. Playing
challenging games is a great way to keep your mind sharp.
Play Games on Your Mobile Phone
Your cell phone probably has at least a couple of games installed on 
it — have you tried them out? Mobile games that come preinstalled on
mobile phones or are downloaded for a small fee are mostly single
player games. (It’s just you against the game.) Hundreds of mobile
phone games are available (see Figure 10-7). Check on your mobile
phone carrier’s site to see which games your phone can support.
Figure 10-7

Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

Many adults find that the phone’s keypad is rather small for gaming
and opt for handheld devices for on-the-go gaming, but with a bit of
practice, you can get the hang of the tiny keys and enjoy the conven-
ience of playing on your phone.
To be safest, stick to downloading games (or ringtones, background
screens, and so on) from your carrier. This ensures that there’s no mal-
ware (malicious software) in the games and that the games are compati-
ble with your particular phone. If you are more savvy and want a
greater selection, be sure you download from a reputable site, as mobile
viruses are, unfortunately, an increasing threat.
Participate in Massively Multiplayer 
Online Games (MMOGs)
Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) place huge numbers of
gamers in a single environment, hence the name. (Popular games have
tens of thousands of users online at any time.) Some MMOGs (such as
Second Life, see Figure 10-8) aren’t games as much as whole virtual
worlds that may have their own currencies, stores and businesses, social
clubs, events, and more. MMOGs are usually subscription services (oth-
ers are ad revenue driven) and offer consistent virtual universes where
the game continues whether or not any specific gamer is playing.
Here are some safety guidelines for playing MMOGs:
➟Select a game that matches your comfort level for lan-
guage, violence, etc. 
Although many conversations are monitored by oth-
ers in the game, with the ability for users to chat
online in real time, you have the risk of negative
behavior. Stay in the main areas of the games, where
this abuse is much less likely to occur.
➟Just as with any online interaction, be careful about
what personal information you expose to other
gamers and the level of trust you place in them.
➟
203
Chapter 10: Being Entertained Online

Figure 10-8
➟Many sites offer points, tokens, extra lives, clothes for
your game character, gifts, and currency you can trade
or give to others. (See Figure 10-9.) Gift giving in any
of these forms is a fun way to interact with friends
and strangers. However, keep in mind that undesir-
able people sometimes use gift giving as a tactic to
befriend and gain the trust of others for a variety of
reasons.
Some users get very addicted to playing online games, particularly
young players. Think about setting time limits for minors in your care,
and be mindful of the amount of time you spend playing. If the gam-
ing begins to interfere with other aspects of your life, you may need to
consider scaling back.

Gamble Online
We’re living in a society where legalized gambling isn’t only socially
accepted, it’s widely promoted and highly visible. Online gambling is ille-
gal in the United States, but despite that we’re in the midst of an Internet-
gambling boom. Young Americans and adults place millions of bets on a
regular basis in online casinos (see Figure 10-10) and sports sites.
Figure 10-10

Chapter 10: Being Entertained Online

Know what you’re getting into if you gamble online:
➟According to an article in the Washington Post
(November 30, 2008, by Gilbert M. Gaul), worldwide
online gambling revenue has more than tripled over
five years, to an estimated $18 billion in 2008. As
Internet gambling grows, so does Internet gambling
fraud. This is partially due to the fact that many gam-
bling operators are based in countries with little
online regulation and even less enforcement.
➟In contrast to the real-world casinos that have strong
security, in online casinos you have little or no way to
know who is viewing your hand, where exactly your
money is being held, or if the dice have been shaved.
Because casinos are often partnerships with locations
in various countries, it’s even hard to hold any one
group accountable if your winnings are never paid
and your stake disappears.
➟Another significant problem with online gambling is
the addictive nature of the activity. With a pace that’s
considerably faster than in real casinos, and where
you can play multiple games at one time, losses can
quickly pile up.
To help identify when gambling has become an addiction, whether
online or offline, review the following list of questions from the
Connecticut Council on Problem Gambling (www.ccpg.org): 
➟Is gambling the most exciting activity in your life?
➟Do you miss work, activities, or other events due to
gambling?
➟Has anyone expressed concern about your gambling?
➟Do you lie to your friends or family about your 
gambling?
➟
206

➟Do you borrow money to gamble?
➟Have you sold personal belongings to get money to
gamble?
➟Have you stolen from your family, friends, or
employer to gamble or to pay back gambling debts?
➟After losing, do you try to win your money back by
gambling?
➟Are you preoccupied with thoughts of gambling?
➟Have you tried to stop gambling but can’t?
Access Videos and Music Online
You can find a wealth of entertainment content online, from music to
your favorite TV shows and Hollywood blockbusters. Sites such as
Netflix and Hulu allow you to watch content online for free, or you can
purchase content for download for a small fee (as low as $1.89 or so
for video and $0.99 for MP3 music downloads as of this writing) from
sites such as Amazon.
Here are the steps for watching a show on Hulu, which is free, but be
aware that it does insert commercials into the programming:
1. Connect to the Internet and enter www.hulu.com in your
browser address field. Click the Sign Up link to create an
account and log in.
2. In the resulting window (see Figure 10-11), click a cate-
gory, such as Movies, and click the picture above an item
that appears to play it. If you don’t find something you
want to watch, enter the name of a movie or TV show in
the Search field and click the Search button.
3. When the item appears in the window shown in Figure

the playback.

available to their advertisers to market other products
or services to you. Others may push spam at your
e-mail. Read terms of service carefully and decide how
much you are willing to “pay” to get free programming
or other services or products online.
Even with the very low pricing on downloading con-
tent, many are tempted to share content that they
don’t have the rights to give away. It may seem harm-
less, but it isn’t like loaning a book to a friend. The
idea that you may inadvertently steal content catches
many seniors by surprise. Even if you share down-
loaded content with only a few friends, any artwork in
a fixed tangible form automatically has copyright pro-
tection. Any use of music, a photo, video, or other art-
work without express permission of the creator is an
infringement of copyright. Loaning or giving such a
file to someone else is violating copyright and consti-
tutes an act of plagiarism.

W
hether you have grandkids (or grand
nieces or nephews) that live at a 
distance — or you’re a child’s care giver — it’s
important that you understand what those kids
and teens are doing online and how you can
interact with them online and help them stay
safer.
Kids may understand the technology better
than you, but many of the risks online have
nothing to do with technology and everything
to do with human nature. Your life experience
is an invaluable asset because you understand
human behavior better and have many more
years of experience in interacting safely in the
world.
Some of the advice we provide in this chapter
for helping kids stay safe is similar to advice
we give you throughout this book, but here we
put the emphasis on the specific risks for
younger people you should be aware of, sug-
gest ways to discuss online safety in a positive,
nonconfrontational manner, and outline skills
that help keep kids and teens safer. Finally, we
provide advice about protecting your own pri-
vacy when kids use your computer.

Understand How Kids 
Use the Internet
Your first step in helping kids is to understand what services they’re using
online and what devices they’re using to connect to the Internet. Kids go
online through many devices including cell (mobile) phones, game con-
soles, iPods and other media players, and, of course, computers.
And what are they doing with that access? A lot.of kids use the Internet
for a variety of tasks, such as the following:
➟Researching topics for homework
➟Using social networking sites to hang out with friends
and share their photos and thoughts
➟Sharing videos — often made via their cell phones —
on sites such as YouTube.com
➟Sending text messages (called texting), sharing music,
photos, and videos via their cell phones with friends
➟Playing games — single-player and interactive, multi-
player games
➟Collaborating on school projects 
➟Shopping
➟Selling items on classified sites
➟Finding new bands and downloading music 
➟Applying for jobs and college
➟Finding dates and flirting
➟Seeking out advice, humor, content, styles, and how
to do things
➟
212
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

The odds are that your grandkids are getting far more benefit from the
Internet than harm, but just as you pay attention to their behavior offline
to keep them safe, it helps if you’re aware of what they’re doing online.
Talk to them about their Internet activities and be observant if you notice
any unusual behavior, such as spending too much time online, making
or receiving cell phone calls or instant messages late at night, or develop-
ing a serious relationship with someone they’ve met only online.
Bond online with your grandchildren. Learn how to
use the tools your kids are using: blogs, e-mail, instant
messaging, and so on. This is a great opportunity to
ask for help to set up your own blog, get started with
instant messaging, start searching, or show you what-
ever it is you don’t yet know how to do.
Checklist for Online Family Safety
By the time kids turn 18 they need to have fully developed the skills to
be productive, responsible Internet users ready to succeed in the 21st
century. This doesn’t happen without practice — and a few failures
along the way. We aren’t doing our jobs as guardians if we don’t ade-
quately prepare young people for the road ahead.
Start on the right foot. Internet safety isn’t about “don’t,” “never,” or
“no.” It’s about learning how to create an environment to say “yes.”
“Grandma, I want to start social networking.” Answer: “That would be
great wouldn’t it! Let’s figure out how we can make that happen. There
are some skills you’ll need to learn, and some responsibilities you’ll
have to master to protect our privacy and respect others. So let’s get
started.”
Effective safety is something families do together. You really can’t force
people over the age of about 10 to act safely online.
Fortunately, kids have a basic sense of self-preservation most of the
time. They don’t want to be insulted, ripped off, or abused by a scam-
mer, thief, or criminal. And when they realize their actions may place
not only themselves, but their family members or friends, at risk, they
are fairly interested in using safety measures.
➟
213
Chapter 11: Grandparents Rule!

Here are some steps to help you get started making a safer online expe-
rience for the whole family:
➟Discuss online safety positively with your grandchil-
dren or other minors in your care — especially those
who want to go online from your computer(s). Listen
to what they want to do, and talk about what it takes
to respect each other’s safety needs.
➟Figure out what works for your personal and family
values. Treat each child and teen uniquely because
there is no one-size-fits-all solution.
➟Decide which activities they are ready for, and create a
plan to help them get ready to take on new activities
with the corresponding responsibilities that go with
them.
➟Install safety software (see Norton Antivirus, shown in
Figure 11-1, for an example), use it unfailingly and
always keep it current. (Much of this software is free).
Depending on the age and maturity of minors in your
care, or using your computer, you may also want con-
tent filtering and family safety (parental control) soft-
ware installed. See Chapter 15 to learn more about
technology tools.
➟Be transparent. Nothing will kill trust and collabora-
tion faster than spying. If you install family safety
tools to monitor activity be up front about it and
explain why it’s there.
➟Encourage the children in your care to be selective
about who they interact with online and which sites
they visit.
➟
214
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

➟It may make sense for you to set an access password
on your user account so that grandchildren can’t go
into your files without you expressly granting access.
See Chapter 3 for more about choosing passwords.
Set up a separate user account for the kids to use to
go online and save their own files and programs.
➟Set boundaries about posting information that can
personally identify you, a family member, or friend.
Learn more about sharing info safely in Chapter 7.
➟Teach grandchildren the skills and savvy to avoid
opening links or attachments in ads or e-mails that
can transmit spam and viruses to your computer.
➟For the youngest grandchildren, you may want to put
your computer and Internet-connected game consoles
in a central location. This helps you to keep an eye on
what they’re doing online.
Figure 11-1
➟
215
Chapter 11: Grandparents Rule!

➟Work together, find out how and where to report
abuse on every service your grandchildren use. Create
an environment that encourages kids to report any
problems to you. Demonstrate to them that acting as
a responsible Internet citizen can help stop the illegal
activity, harassment, and predatory behavior of online
criminals.
➟Talk about not trading personal information for free-
bies. Just as in the physical world, if it sounds too
good to be true, it probably is. Unwanted software,
such as spyware and viruses, often piggybacks on soft-
ware or other merchandise that’s free.
➟Request information about the safeguards on the com-
puters that your grandchild uses outside the home.
This includes computers at school, the public library,
and the homes of other family members or friends.
➟Help your grandchildren choose safe e-mail addresses,
IM names, chat nicknames, and other such identifiers.
➟If you’re a full-time care giver, sit down periodically
with the kids to review who they communicate with
and what they’re doing online. Review their safety set-
tings to be sure they are still appropriate, or adjust as
needed as they grow.
Help Protect Grandchildren Using E-Mail
Today, kids don’t consider e-mail cool, so they don’t use it often.
However, it’s a tool they’ll use now and then, so follow this advice 
for safer e-mailing:
➟For young children, use a service that enables you to
limit your child’s contacts to people you know.
➟
216
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

➟Talk to teens about who they communicate with and
what they talk about. Set boundaries that match your
family’s values and your grandchild’s age, reassessing
these boundaries periodically as your grandchild
matures or wants to begin using new services.
➟Caution them not to list their e-mail addresses pub-
licly or respond to e-mail from people they don’t per-
sonally know.
➟Teach them to ignore all sweepstakes and any quiz
that asks them to enter their e-mail address They
should always guard their e-mail account information.
Help your grandchild understand that use of any
online service, and access to additional features within
those services, is a privilege that requires mastery of
new skills and a commitment to new responsibilities.
Agree upon ground rules for safe use of services prior
to expanding your grandchild’s venture into new areas
or use of new devices.Learn more about e-mail safety
in Chapter 5.
Help Create Safe Instant Messaging Experiences
Instant messaging (IM) is primarily done from a computer, although it
can also be done through some mobile (cell) phone services. IM allows
people to interact online in real time, sending short messages back and
forth, something like a text-based phone call. Here are some tips to help
keep younger children and teens safer when they use instant messaging:
➟For younger children, use services that allow you to
limit your grandchildren’s contacts so that they can
send IM or text messages to only people you both
know.
➟
217
Chapter 11: Grandparents Rule!

➟Teach them not to list their IM names publicly, for
example on their social networking pages, or respond
to IMs from people they don’t know personally. Look
for options in their instant messaging programs to
help them set their profiles to private. (See Figure
11-2 for such settings in MSN Messenger.)
Figure 11-2
Some IM programs have an option that allows friends
of friends to send instant messages to you. This
option is all about connecting people with common
interests. However, limiting access to your information
is harder using this approach, which is one of the real
concerns about adding strangers to your IM buddy list
Restrict contact to only those you know.
➟
218
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

➟Familiarize yourself with all the features in the IM
program your grandchild wants to use and consider
potential risks. IM programs may enable sharing of
photos, allow you to give remote access to your com-
puter (which gives a person on another computer
access to your files), facilitate group communications,
and provide location finders that help someone pin-
point a device’s location.
Stay Safer on Social Networking Sites
Two things can help you determine the appropriateness of a social 
networking site for your grandchild:
➟Age restrictions. Typically, social networking sites
provide clear age guidelines. For example, Club
Penguin (see Figure 11-3) is designed for 6–14 year
olds, but it’s open to all ages; Webkinz is designed for
users 6–13+; MySpace and Facebook require users to
be 13 or older.
➟Spend time browsing the site and reading the site’s
safety and privacy protection policies with your
grandchild. Look at the types of interactions and
communications that are occurring and compare the
site’s stated standards to their actual enforcement of
standards. Nothing beats actually exploring a site for
helping you determine whether it’s appropriate for
children in your care.
When you’re grandchild is ready to sign up, be aware that accepting the
service’s default settings may expose more information than he or she
intended. Children should be especially cautious about exposing too
much about their name, age, or location. Here’s how to make smart
choices when opening a social network account:
➟
219
Chapter 11: Grandparents Rule!

➟Help kids evaluate the questions that services ask in the
registration process. There’s a clear difference between
required information and optional. (See Figure 11-4.)
The rule of thumb is to enter as little as possible. If,
over time, they want to add more, the can do so, but
taking information back is far more difficult. 
➟Sites often encourage sharing more information than
is required, and they typically position doing so as a
way to be more popular, a ploy children and teens fall
for more often than adults. Sometimes this informa-
tion provides them with a more customized experi-
ence. Sometimes they simply want it for marketing
purposes, or to sell.
Figure 11-3
➟
220
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

Figure 11-4
➟Teach them to understand what they share (see
Chapter 7 to learn this for yourself). It’s often very
difficult to remove information from sites, and many
have come to regret the amount of information they
shared. Future employers, romantic partners, college
admissions officials, cyberbullies, and others may
search for them online, and early indiscretions can
stay up there to haunt them throughout their lives.
Sites should state what is required and what is optional
➟
221
Chapter 11: Grandparents Rule!

Blog Safely
Social networking sites allow users to interact with each other in many
ways, and to share their thoughts through blogs (which is short for Web
logs). Here are some tips for kids sharing through blogs:
➟The site should offer site monitors and tools to help
protect user safety, such as a way to control who has
permission to see the blog and the ability to block
harassing users and turn comments on or off.
➟Know who owns the content. Read the terms and
conditions of the blog site relative to content. Even
some of the most popular blog and social networking
sites have clauses that give the service the right to use
anything people post in any way they want. Choose a
service that respects your grandchildren’s right to their
own content and retain their privacy.
➟If a blog is not set to private, anyone can visit and
comment on what the blogger is saying or posting.
Kids don’t realize that most blog sites default blog
posts to being publicly viewable; they have to change
the setting to make their blog private. The more per-
sonal or identifiable the information your grandchil-
dren share, the fewer people they should share it
with. If your grandchildren choose to make their
blogs public, they should disclose only what they
would want anyone on the Internet to know.
➟Periodically review or ask your grandchildren to
review who has access to their pages. Friends change
over time and once-trusted people may become less
trusted. It is particularly important for them to imme-
diately block access to anybody with whom they have
➟
222
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

had a disagreement. One of the most common causes
of cyberbullying is the breakup of a friendship; the
content they have on their blog pages becomes the
most common ammunition used against them.
➟Help them protect their real names on their sites, and
everyone else’s names too. (See an example of what
not to do in Figure 11-5.) Their friends know their
names; nobody else needs to.
• Keep information that puts them on the map out of
their blog. Tell them not to mention such details as
their addresses, schools, or even their town names
(especially if they live in small towns).
• They should protect any information that gives away
their actual birth dates (birth year is enough to sign
up with services) or year of graduation.
Figure 11-5

➟
223
Chapter 11: Grandparents Rule!

➟Help them to understand how to really see what
information is being shared.
Most social networking sites show the user’s profile
photo, even when the user’s pages are set to private.
See Chapter 6 for more about how to spot risks in
photos or videos that you post online.
➟Help children in your care to understand the need to
be careful about sharing their feelings in a blog
because that information is permanent. Explain that
they express feelings in a blog in various ways. The
moods they show, poems they select, the music they
list, the pictures they post, all tell a lot about who
they are and how they feel.
➟Suggest your grandkids check out what their friends
expose about them in their blogs and help them learn
to talk to others about respecting their privacy.
Friends may accidentally be giving out their real
names or information that can locate them, such as
the schools they attend. (See Figure 11-6.) Perhaps a
friend has a photo of friends on her site with a cap-
tion indicating who your grandchild is.
➟Spam messages on social networking sites often
appear as comments. These typically include links to
sites, and young people need to avoid these like the
plague — they often place malware on your computer
or contain offensive content.

Understand Exposure in Quizzes and Surveys
Quizzes and surveys that your grandchildren find online (see Figure
11-7), including those on social networking sites, are usually entertain-
ing and may seem like a harmless pastime. But quiz and survey compa-
nies are for-profit businesses, and they typically make their money by
selling the consumer information they collect. (See Chapter 8 for more
about quizzes and surveys.)

information about the person posting the survey, as

Understand Mobile Phones and Texting
Most mobile (cell) phones today are small computers with rich feature
sets. Before you buy a phone for a child or teen in your care, ask your-
self what are the features on the phone, and what services do these fea-
tures enable? Look at the answers from a safety perspective: Which
safeguards are in place, along with all those cool features?
Here are some cell phone features to think about before buying:
➟Does the phone have Internet access? Depending on
the age and maturity of a minor, this may or may not
be desirable.
➟Does the phone offer filters that block content that
could be harmful to children or offensive to you? Is
the filter turned on? If the filter isn’t on by default
and you think it should be, ask the sales person to
turn it on for you in the store and help you set appro-
priate filter levels.
➟Which services do the filters cover? If the phone has
TV, find out if the service allows you to set ratings
restrictions on shows. Find out how this feature treats
unrated programs. Are there filters that apply to music
services?
➟Does the phone or device have location (GPS) capa-
bility? (See Figure 11-8.) You should be able to block
this capability or limit it if you choose to, so that 
your grandchildren can’t allow people to track their
location.
➟Does the phone have a camera? The rising image
quality in mobile phone cameras documents a lot of
poor choices. While most teens use cameras sensibly,
others document extreme behavior to look cool for
each other, take and swap inappropriate pictures or
➟
227
Chapter 11: Grandparents Rule!

short videos of themselves or allow someone else to
do so. They also snap photos or shoot video humili-
ating or harming others to post online; they photo-
graph their crimes, and take inappropriate photos of
other minors. Some find that embarrassment isn’t the
only consequence: they may also face criminal
charges. Those photographing sexual images of them-
selves or others may face felony charges for creating
and distributing child sexual abuse images.
➟Can the phone link your child to social networking
sites? Social networking sites are seeing huge increases
in traffic via mobile phones. Teens in particular use
these features to update their statuses and monitor
their friends’ communications and activities. Spur-of-
the-moment posts, whether on the computer or a
mobile device, are often done without considering
safety. What seems like a good idea to share today
may not seem like a good idea in the long term.
➟Do you know how to report theft of the phone? You
may need to provide serial numbers or other informa-
tion found on the phone itself — usually found
under the battery. Ask the sales clerk what informa-
tion you need in order to report theft. If you don’t
have this information written down, you surely won’t
be able to find it after the phone is stolen.
➟Do you know how to report harassment or bullying?
The carrier should have a clear set of procedures that
you can use to report any malicious calls. It’s best to
know these in advance of any trouble. Discuss these
procedures and all other issues listed here with any
child who will use a phone.

Many care givers like pre-paid phone plans because they prevent any-
one who uses the phone from exceeding their spending limit. Should
they run out of minutes, they can choose to purchase more at any store
that sells pre-paid minute phone cards, which includes just about every
grocery and convenience store.
However, consider a couple of things before you choose between a 
pre-paid account and an account that bills monthly. These include the
following:
➟Some companies allow you to review incoming and
outgoing calls made on pre-paid accounts; some don’t.
➟
229
Chapter 11: Grandparents Rule!

An account with a monthly bill shows every phone
number called including time of day and helps you
understand who your child communicates with.
Review their call history with your child and explain
that this isn’t an invasion of privacy but a way to help
keep him or her safe. Especially note unfamiliar num-
bers from out of your area.
➟The monthly bill (see Figure 11-9) tells you what
times of day calls are taking place. If a child’s having
difficulty getting up for school in the morning or
sneaking out at night, look at the child’s phone call-
ing and texting history. If calls and text messages are
flying in the middle of the night, you may need to
take the phone away from the child after a certain
time in the evening, setting a time that the family
believes is too late for accepting or making phone
calls, and returning the phone in the morning.
It’s also useful to pay attention to calls and text messages sent during
school hours. Most schools prohibit use of cell phones during school,
except for emergencies. If a child or teen’s phone record shows a lot of
calls or text messages placed during school hours (especially to other
students) this may indicate a problem with paying attention in class or
cheating on tests.
Sit down with the children in your care to periodically
check the content on the phone. Which ringtones are
they using? Are the photos they’ve taken and the pho-
tos sent to them appropriate? What other items have
they downloaded (games, ads and coupons, and so
on)? What services have they purchased? Are the serv-
ices appropriate, and do they have ongoing monthly
fees? You may not find some services appropriate.
Does the phone allow them to watch videos? If so,
which videos are they watching?

Protect Students at School
Official school Web sites, online newsletters, team Web sites, and the
like often contain specific information about students, including full
names and photos, identifying student council participants, various
sports team members (see Figure 11-10), and so on. Some classes may
also create their own publicly viewable Web sites so that students can
post projects and care givers and students can check out homework
assignments.
This information automatically associates students with specific school
locations, and often contains details about exactly when and where
meetings, practices, and events will take place. This is enough for any-
one to locate children, know their patterns of going to and from
school, and their interests.
➟
231
Chapter 11: Grandparents Rule!

Figure 11-10
If the school your grandchildren attend publicly exposes personal infor-
mation about students, it’s time for the school to do a safety analysis of
all online communications to identify and minimize risks. Encourage
the school to consider making the information two-tiered: Some is visi-
ble to the general public, while some is restricted to the approved list of
e-mail addresses that students and parents provide at the beginning of
each year.
Play Games Safely
All the advice we give about gaming in Chapter 10 applies to kids and
teens as well as adults. Here’s a quick rundown of what you should
help minors in your care keep in mind:
➟
232
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

➟Choose safe gaming sites by reviewing their policies
and evaluating the companies behind them. Gaming
sites such as MSN, AOL, and Yahoo! (see Figure 11-11),
xBox, World Of Warcraft, and Lordsgame are very
respectful of people’s privacy, won’t download malware
(malicious software) to computers, and monitor their
services for safety, for example. Other sites may not
maintain these standards.
Figure 11-11
➟Be aware that kids play Internet-connected games on
a variety of devices, from game consoles to cell
phones, as well as computers in your home or in
friends’ homes. Discuss which games are appropriate
for them to play based on their ages, maturity levels
and your family values.
➟
233
Chapter 11: Grandparents Rule!

➟Some people use game environments as a way to bully
others. Teach your grandkids that they may never be
abusers, and help them report the abuse to the service
provider, and block the abuser from contacting them
again. Make it clear that retaliating isn’t acceptable
(and almost always leads to an escalation of abuse).
➟If a child is bullied or solicited in a gaming site, cutting
them off from the game isn’t a solution, as their online
world is an important part of their support network.
Instead, help them to block specific abusers and report
the abuse. Encourage children in your care to talk to
you or another adult if they’re having problems.
Understand the Act of Cyberbullying
All bullying is carried out by malicious attackers seeking implicit or
explicit entertainment or profit through the abuse of another person.
Cyberbullies just have new tools to use in these attacks. When you add
e-mail, blogs, instant messaging, mobile phones, digital images, and
other electronic tools, bullying takes on entirely new dimensions.
➟The Internet allows large numbers of people to wit-
ness a bully’s abuse.
➟Taunts and threats are no longer restricted to the
school grounds and can occur 24/7.
➟Cyberbullies can attack victims in their most private
refuges through their phones and Web sites.
➟The accusations cyberbullies hurl may be perma-
nently viewable, haunting the victim for the rest of
their lives as people who search for them online come
across the malicious content.
➟Cyberbullies can choose to cloak their actions in
anonymity, which may encourage them to act out in
vicious ways.
➟
234
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

Cyberbullying, also called online harassment and cyber stalking, can
involve any of these acts:
➟Sending mean or threatening e-mails or IMs.
➟Posting insulting, threatening, or derogatory com-
ments about someone on one or more Web sites.
➟Spreading rumors about someone through blogs, 
discussions, or social journals.
➟Threatening physical harm or verbally intimidating
someone.
➟Stealing and altering photos in damaging ways or
adding derogatory comments; they can then post
them on social networking sites (such as MySpace) or
send them to the victim’s friends, family, school,
employers, and so on.
➟Pretending to be the victim by creating fake blogs to
start trouble with the victim’s friends. Posting embar-
rassing images under the victim’s identity.
The full scope of cyberbullying is difficult to measure
because of real issues surrounding underreporting.
However, research indicates that nearly one in six U.S.
children grades six to ten (that’s 3.2 million students)
are victims of online bullying every year (though chil-
dren of all ages can experience this phenomenon).
Six Steps to Avoid and Prevent Cyberbullying
Have minors in your care follow these steps to avoid cyberbullying: 
➟Keep personal information (address, phone number,
and so on), feelings, and personal photos private so
that abusing this information is more difficult for a
➟
235
Chapter 11: Grandparents Rule!

bully to find. Advise the child or teen to immediately
restrict access to information from anyone who
becomes angry with them.
➟Use technology tools (see Figure 11-12) to block any-
one whose behavior is inappropriate or threatening in
any way. (If they’re younger they’ll need help with this.)
➟Never answer phone calls or read messages, e-mail, or
comments from cyberbullies. Do set them aside in
case authorities need them as evidence.
Figure 11-12
➟
236
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

Check in with your grandchildren periodically to ask whether they’re
being bullied, whether in person, on the computer, or on their cell
phones.Make sure children know why they should never bully others,
and make it clear what the consequences will be if they do. Some par-
ents of bullies tend to minimize or dismiss their children’s behavior.
They consider such behavior as being “just a phase,” or they say that
“kids will be kids.” Not only does this point of view utterly disregard
the tremendous damage done to victims, it also fails to recognize the
very dangerous paths bullies walk.
Those who participate in cyberbullying head down a
very negative path. They are far more likely to also
become involved in other delinquent behavior online
and offline. These problem behaviors include abusing
alcohol, cheating on school tests, skipping school,
physically assaulting peers or adults, damaging prop-
erty, shoplifting, drug abuse, running away from
home, carrying weapons, and detention or suspension
from school. Bullies also have significantly increased
risk of imprisonment, failed relationships, and failure
to succeed in a work environment in later life. If your
grandchild is a bully, find help now.
What to Do If Your Grandchild Is Cyberbullied
Often, young people who are victims of bullying are told they should
just ignore it or toughen up. Instead of dismissing them, support them
when they speak up about online abuse.
To help kids and teens who are being cyberbullied, follow these 
guidelines:
➟Help the victims of cyberbullying understand that the
bullying isn’t their fault. If you ask most bully victims
why they’re being bullied, they say it’s because they
➟
237
Chapter 11: Grandparents Rule!

have whatever ‘deficiency’ the bullies claim — they’re
too short, have a lisp, are too fat or skinny, or what-
ever. In reality, bullies choose an easy target and then
figure out a justification for the bullying. Too often,
victims feel their characteristics caused them to be
singled out, and they feel that they’re somehow at
fault. They aren’t.
➟Teach your grandchild that it’s a myth that weaklings
tattle. In reality, those who tell are the ones who
aren’t willing to be bullied. Speaking out and getting
help are positive declarations that they deserve to be
treated better and are willing to take steps to ensure
that they are.
➟Protect your grandchild from further abuse. This
means reacting and acting very carefully to not make
matters worse. The biggest fear kids have in telling
adults about bullying is that their fears will be dis-
missed, that they’ll be blamed, or that their Internet
access will be cut off.
➟If you feel that you or your grandchild is in any way
at risk, call the police. Don’t hesitate or wait to see if
the abuse will stop.
➟If you or your grandchildren are harassed or threat-
ened online, report the abuser to the Web service.
(See Figure 11-13.) If the online services don’t pro-
vide the support you need, change services and let the
provider know why you changed.
➟Report online abuse to your Internet service provider
(ISP) or phone abuse to your cell phone company,
and follow any instructions for documenting the
problem and taking action against the abuser.
➟
238

You may want to contact the school for advice, even if
the cyberbullying isn’t by another student, as schools
have to deal with this issue daily.

Talk to Kids about Sexual Predators

make online sexual exploitation of minors seem like an hourly event
and reality. For the most part teens know how to deal with sexual

239
Chapter 11: Grandparents Rule!

solicitation as a crude and dismissable fact of life. That said, you should
educate yourself about the tactics of sexual predators, warning signs of
children at risk, and candidly discuss these with children in your care.
Certain things, including the following, put some kids more at risk of
sexual attention than others:
➟Internet sexual predators, like offline sexual predators,
prey on people of all ages. The group most at risk for
online sexual predation is teens between the ages of
13 and 15. Younger kids are less likely socialize online,
and older teens are generally a bit more cautious.
➟Young people with low self-esteem and few friends
have significantly increased vulnerability for this type
of grooming — they’re seeking understanding, they’re
willing to be extreme, and they’ve already lost their
footing. There are simple steps that you can take to
significantly reduce the risk of online sexual exploita-
tion of children in your care.
➟Don’t preach “stranger danger.” Sexual predators who
use online tools are often not strangers to their vic-
tims. Family members, family friends, teachers,
coaches, club leaders, and others who want to exploit
a minor sexually frequently use the Internet (and cell
phones) as grooming tools.
➟Talk to kids and teens about online sexual predators
in the same matter of fact way you talk about other
kinds of potential threats they may face.
➟Sexual predators groom children to establish trust,
isolate the victims from their friends and family, and
make the victim feel special with gifts and so on.
➟
240
Part II: Using the Internet While Dodging the Risk

Teach your kids to question why someone they meet
online is actively seeking their trust, sending gifts, or
trying to alienate them from their family or friends.
➟Teach kids to trust their instincts when something
feels weird and report it to you.

Crimes against Children Research Center. Also, visit
our Web site, www.ilookbothways.com, and search
for the latest information on sexual predators.
If You Think Your Grandchild Is Being Groomed
If you suspect your grandchild is being groomed by a sexual predator,
follow these steps:
➟Stay calm. Fear and anger are natural reactions; how-
ever they can frighten the child. Never blame, punish,
or embarrass a victim.
➟Believe your child. Children don’t typically lie about
sexual abuse. Believe what you’re being told and lis-
ten carefully.
➟Reassure the victim that this isn’t his fault. Thank
the child for telling you. Give positive messages such
as, “This isn’t your fault,” or “You were very smart to
tell me about this.”
➟
241
Chapter 11: Grandparents Rule!

➟Allow your child to express feelings but control
your own feelings about the situation. Put your
child’s feelings center stage and don’t confuse them
with your own reactions.
➟Get back to normal life as soon as possible. Protect
your child, but don’t make her feel different or 
isolated.
➟Seek help for yourself. Care givers often feel angry,
guilty, or to blame when they learn their child has
been groomed by a sexual predator. Talk to someone
you trust, or call a counselor who can help you.
Report Sexual Abuse
To gather evidence and report abuse, follow these steps:
➟Look at the files and communications on your grand-
child’s computer, mobile phone and other devices
together with your grandchild.
➟If any of the following occurs, contact the police, and
follow their instructions:
• You believe your child is at physical risk.
• Your child or anyone in the household has received
child pornography or abusive images.
• Your child has been sexually solicited or receives sex-
ually explicit images
➟Inform your service provider of the abuse on its service.
To report known or suspected child exploitation anywhere in the coun-
try, contact the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children

Use Software to Keep Grandkids Safer
Chapter 15 is all about how technology can keep your computer safe
from threats such as viruses and spyware, but in addition to these pro-
grams there are software products you can use to help your grandkids
stay safe online. These include the following:
➟Content filtering and safety settings (often called
parental controls) Browsers provide some content fil-
tering, to help you set boundaries for the types of
sites, text, and images returned in search results.
Operating systems, Internet service providers, and
Web portals provide safety settings that you can set 
to filter content based on keywords or categories of
content (such as sexually explicit or violent content).
You can also use these programs to limit or monitor
your child’s online activities.

Protect Yourself As Well
Kids sometimes misbehave and get into trouble. Some grandchildren
leverage unprotected information to make purchases, empty bank
accounts, steal identities, or even cyberbully their grandparents. To 
protect yourself, take these measures:
➟Password-protect your user account to protect your
own information and privacy before you allow grand-
children or anyone else to use your computer.

Shop ’Til You
Drop . . . But
Safely
T
he convenience of shopping online is won-
derful. You can buy just about any product
or service online, any time of the day, any day of
the week. Return policies are usually generous.
(Although you may have to pay for return ship-
ping in addition to the original shipping, which
is the online equivalent of the time and gas it
costs you to return something to the mall.)
In addition to convenience, online shopping,
whether through a store, classified, or auction
site, provides a much larger selection than you
can find under one roof in a store in town. You
also have the ability to learn a lot more about
most products, compare brands and features,
read the product reviews of other customers
and see what kind of experience they had with
the store or seller. Another great benefit of
online shopping is that it almost always gets
you the best prices, out-of-state purchases may
be tax free, and shipping is often free or at 
low cost. 
Shopping safely, which we discuss in this chap-
ter, involves knowing who you’re doing busi-
ness with, understanding what information to
provide, avoiding scams, and knowing which
methods of payment are safest.

Overview of Online Shopping Safety
Getting a great deal online involves considerably more than getting the
lowest price. Before buying anything online, consider these points: 
➟You should be sure that the product arrives on time,
it’s of the quality you expect, and it includes a proper
warranty. The seller should also clearly state its return
policy and provide support with any questions or
issues you have.
➟Is the offer too good to be true? (See Figure 12-1 for
an example of an offer that looks suspicious.) Avoid
buying from any e-store (online store) that promises
too much at too low a price. If the price is low, you
have to consider whether the merchant came by the
items legally, whether you’ll ever receive the items,
whether the items will work, if you’ll be able to return
damaged goods, or if the merchant is also generating
revenue by selling your financial information.
Figure 12-1
➟
248
Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

➟Use a payment service or credit card for payment. The
U.S. Federal Trade Commission limits your liability
for credit card purchases to no more than $50 of
unauthorized charges if your financial information is
stolen. Don’t use debit or ATM cards as in most cases
there is no limit to your liability if these get abused
and you could find your account emptied. Don’t use
checks as they have too much of your personal infor-
mation on them including your bank, your bank
account number and your banks routing number for
transferring money out of your account. Any seller
that asks for a cashier’s check, wire transfer, or money
order is almost always a scam, and once the money is
sent, you have no way to get it back.
➟Use payment services (such as PayPal shown in Figure
12-2) that allow you to register with them and pay
companies through them without ever exposing your
credit card number or personal information to the
seller.
Figure 12-2
➟
249
Chapter 12: Shop ’Til You Drop . . . But Safely

➟It’s wise to create a dedicated e-mail account for
online shopping and transactions to reduce the risk of
getting more spam into your primary e-mail account.
We also recommend using one credit card exclusively
for online transactions. If that card is compromised,
you can quickly shut it down quickly without disrupt-
ing any other accounts.
➟Review the company’s shipping methods. Understand
which carriers they use, their shipping rates, their
tracking tools, and insurance coverage.
Disreputable stores frequently run an absurdly low-
price offer and then, claiming the item is out of stock,
try to sell you something else; this is a classic bait-
and-switch technique.
Choose Safe Sites
The fundamental safety consideration when shopping and performing
transactions online is the same issue Internet users have to consider
when sharing personal information: trust. Learning how to determine
which companies, institutions, and individuals are worthy of your trust
when it comes to your financial information is a critical life skill.
Consider the following:
➟Do you know the store from the brick-and-mortar
world? If the Web site is owned by a store you already
do business with and where you can physically return
any item, or you have experience with their level of
service and trustworthiness, you’re probably in very
good hands.
➟What is the site’s reputation? The really big, well
known online brands work hard to maintain their
reputation and should give excellent service and sup-
port if there are questions. On less-known sites, if you
➟
250
Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

know others who have had consistently positive expe-
riences with the online store, you can be reassured of
the site’s quality.
➟Doing your own background check. Found a great
price but it’s from a store you don’t know? Check it
out on sites dedicated to reviewing e-stores, such as
Epinions (www.epinions.com), BizRate (www.
bizrate.com), and the Better Business Bureau
(www.bbb.org). If you can’t find any (positive)
review for the store, think hard before shopping there.
Another Web site to consider is The National Fraud
Information Center (www.fraud.org; shown in
Figure 12-3) which watches out for shady Internet
dealings and offers consumer tips on its Web site.
Figure 12-3
➟Is the Web site secure? Legitimate online merchants
offer secure transactions. Look for two assurances to
see if you’re on a secure site. The URL should show
➟
251
Chapter 12: Shop ’Til You Drop . . . But Safely

https: (note the addition of the s at the end of
http) when you’re making a purchase. Also, you
should see a lock symbol in to the right of the Web
address bar. (See Figure 12-4.)
Figure 12-4
➟Does the merchant collect more information than is
necessary to complete the sale? You’ll need to pro-
vide some method of payment, an address, and a tele-
phone number, but that should be all. If, for example,
if a merchant requests your social security number or
driver’s license number, never provide it. Some rep-
utable companies ask additional questions about your
interests to enhance their service. These questions
should always be optional. Remember, your informa-
tion is a commodity, and you should feel that you’re
This indicated a secure site
➟
252
Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

getting appropriate value in return and understand
how the information will be used (will it be resold to
others?) before providing your information.
Make Online Purchases
Although every site is slightly different, making a purchase online 
usually involves these steps:
1. Browse the site using links or their search feature until you
find an item you want to buy.
2. Click the button called something like Buy or Add to Cart
or Add to Shopping Bag. (See Figure 12-5.) Some sites
have shopping carts, some shopping bags, some checkout
carts or shopping baskets — but they fulfill the same func-
tion, and it’s pretty easy to figure out where to put your
purchases.
Figure 12-5
Click this button to make a purchase
➟
253
Chapter 12: Shop ’Til You Drop . . . But Safely

3. You’re then usually taken to your shopping cart, which
shows the item you just put in it. You can go back to
shopping. (Some sites offer a Continue Shopping link
you can click to go back to the previous page, or you can
just click the site logo to go to the home page or a link to
shop a category of items.)
4. When you finish putting all the items you want to buy in
your cart, click the link called My Shopping Cart (or
Checkout, or My Shopping Basket, or whatever the site
calls it). 
5. At this point, you may want to look for discount coupons.
Even when the company’s Web site isn’t displaying
coupons, they may well have some, and the product man-
ufacturer may also provide coupons. The best way to look
for these is to open a new browser window so you don’t
lose your place in the store. Search using the company
name and the word coupon to find any coupon codes or
promotional codes that you can use. Enter these into the
promotional code field on the store’s purchase screen.
Repeat the search using the name of the product and the
word coupon. If you are lucky, you may get more than
one discount to apply. Note: there are also Web sites that
specialize in providing discount coupon codes for thou-
sands of online stores. Search on the term coupons, (be
sure to only use Web sites that are reputable), and see
what you find.
6. When you’ve added any promotional/discount codes,
review your purchases and quantities to make sure they
are correct. When you’re sure they are, continue the check-
out sequence, which will involve:
• Entering your billing and shipping addresses
• Choosing a shipping method, such as standard or
express
➟
254
Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

• Entering payment information (usually your credit
card information, but some sites take PayPal)
• Reviewing and authorizing the purchase
7. When the purchase goes through, the seller sends an
e-mail to you, confirming the purchase and providing a
way to track the items as they’re processed and then
shipped to you. (See Figure 12-6.) Save the e-mail as both
a receipt and to track or dispute (if it becomes necessary)
the purchase.
Figure 12-6
Sell on Classified Sites
Selling items through an online classified site is a much better option
than using newspaper classifieds. Far more people will see the ad, 
it’s usually much cheaper to place, and you can include lots more infor-
mation. (See Figure 12-7.) Follow a few safety tips to have the best
experience:
➟
255
Chapter 12: Shop ’Til You Drop . . . But Safely

➟When describing the item for sale, limit the personal
information you give. For example, don’t include in
photos anything that pinpoints your location or iden-
tity, such as a house number, your child, other posses-
sions, or identifying information that isn’t relevant to
the item being sold.
➟Only give a general location, such as the name of
your city, not a specific address, in your ad.
➟Only deal with local people who you can meet face to
face. The further away a buyer (or seller) is, the higher
your risk of fraud. Out-of-area buyers are almost
always fraudulent.
➟Never accept payment in the form of a cashier’s check,
wire transfer, money order, money transfer, or escrow
services. These are scams. You will end up without the
item you “sold” and without payment. To add insult
to injury, you may also get stuck paying the bill for the
check or wire! You want cash at the time of the trans-
action or through a reputable payment service. (See
the section “Payment Services” later in this chapter).
➟Be wary of suspicious behavior. If someone offers to
pay more than the asking price, he’s committing
fraud. If someone asks for your checking account
information so she can transfer funds, the transaction
isn’t legitimate. Providing this information will put
the money in your bank account at high risk of theft.
➟Never send an item before payment in the form of
cash or a transfer of funds into a PayPal (or similar
service) has been received. 
➟Scammers often use hard-luck stories to get you to
give them the item for free. No matter how sad the
story sounds, it’s likely a scam.
➟
256
Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

Figure 12-7
➟Unless the item is too big to easily transport, always
bring the item to a public place to show potential
buyers rather than having the buyer come to your
home. Don’t invite trouble to your doorstep.
➟Never meet buyers alone. Always have someone with
you, even if you’re meeting the buyer in a public
place.
➟If you’re selling a device such as an iPod or PDA
through a classified or auction site, consider what
content is on the device. Strip off all personal infor-
mation and make sure that it doesn’t contain copy-
righted content that isn’t yours to sell.
Buy on Classified Sites
Online classifieds have great deals on all kinds of items, and a few
smart safety precautions will help you have a positive experience.
Advice for buyers is similar to that for sellers (see the previous section),➟
257
Chapter 12: Shop ’Til You Drop . . . But Safely

but from a buyer’s unique perspective. Here are safety tips for online
classified site buyers:
➟Before buying or selling anything on a classified site,
read the site’s Terms and Conditions, understand its
abuse reporting procedures, and any safety tips the
site provides.
➟When creating an account on a classified ad site, use a
separate e-mail account (not your personal e-mail
account). Many sites provide an e-mail account for
you, but if the site you choose to use doesn’t, create a
new e-mail account for yourself for your classified
transactions. You shouldn’t share your personal e-mail
account with strangers.
➟Don’t ever include a personal phone number in your
profile or when responding to an ad.
➟Only deal with local people who you can meet face to
face. The further away a buyer or seller is, the higher
your risk of fraud.
➟Research the item carefully before purchasing and be
wary if the asking price is unrealistically low. Check
other ads for the same item on the same or another
classified or auction site.
➟Check the item carefully before releasing payment.
For example, if it’s an electronic gadget, plug it in or
turn it on to be sure it works.
➟The best way to pay for items is with cash or with a
secure payment service. (See the next section.) If the
seller asks you to pay more than the original price
and offers to give you a check for the difference, say
no — it’s a scam. Don’t pay with a personal check, as
they show your address, full name, and sometimes
your phone number, along with your bank account
and routing number.
➟

Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

➟Avoid going to someone’s house to view an item
unless it’s too large to expect the seller to transport.
Ask to meet in a busy public place. Always bring
someone with you.
➟Report any abuse to the classified service provider (see
Figure 12-8), and law enforcement, if necessary.
If you are the victim of a scam, report it though the
Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.ic3.gov/

Payment Services
A great way to protect your financial identity when shopping online is
to use an online payment service. There are several payment services,
the most common are PayPal, Yahoo!, and PayDirect (see Figure 12-9).
Payment services enable you to use a third-party service so you never
expose your credit card or bank information to online companies or➟
259
Chapter 12: Shop ’Til You Drop . . . But Safely

individuals. Typically you have three basic options: you can put cash
into your account on their service, link your account on their service to
your bank account, or you can have them securely store your credit card
information. Then, when you buy something, the service holds your
payment until a buyer confirms the purchase is complete and releases
the payment. The seller only sees Paypal’s transaction information. This
offers buyers an increased level of protection from a fraudulent seller.
Proprietary payment services may increase a buyer’s protection by pro-
viding another avenue for complaints, and they may also screen out
fraudulent sellers because of the reduced anonymity of the transaction.
However, the degree of protection for a defrauded buyer may be lim-
ited, depending on the particular features of the payment service.
Figure 12-9
Online Auctions
Online auctions sites such as eBay continue to increase in popularity as
consumers participate from computers and mobile phones. These sites
are a great way to pick up good deals and unusual items (see Figure
12-10), and with a few simple safety precautions you can have great
experiences both buying and selling in auctions. Reputable services go
to great lengths to monitor their services for any scams or abuse, but
you still need to stay alert and use some common sense.
➟
260
Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

Figure 12-10
Here are some things to keep in mind when participating in online
auctions:
➟Auction sites provide buyer and seller reputation rat-
ings. Always look at the reputation of the seller (or
buyer if you are selling an item). Your chances of a
positive experience are far higher when dealing with
individuals and companies with sterling reputations. 
➟Be particularly careful if buying ‘antiques’ or expen-
sive name brand items through auction sites. Unless
you are happy with knockoffs, you want to be able to
verify authenticity of the items.
➟
261
Chapter 12: Shop ’Til You Drop . . . But Safely

➟Some auction scams tempt victims to send money for
promised items and then deliver nothing — or items
far less valuable than the promised items.
➟Another ploy is overpaying for an item. In this sce-
nario,a criminal buys an item from you with a check
for a larger amount than the item’s value and asks
you to reimburse the difference. It’s only after you’ve
shipped the goods and refunded the difference that
you discover the check bounces and the criminal gets
away with your property and your cash.
➟Be particularly careful with international sellers. If
something goes wrong in one of these transactions,
there’s very little that can be done to help you get
your funds or goods back.

M
any people are worried about conduct-
ing any part of their financial lives
online. They worry that the danger of having
their accounts broken into or their identity
stolen is somehow greater online than offline.
In fact, the greatest risk of ID theft is still that
someone might take mail from your mailbox
or discarded documents from your trash. With
a good understanding of creating and using
strong passwords (see Chapter 3), some savvy
about avoiding e-mail scams (see Chapters 5),
protecting yourself against downloaded spy-
ware (see Chapter 15), and the specific advice
we provide about online investing, banking,
and bill paying in this chapter, you can go a
long way towards avoiding ID theft and enjoy
the convenience of safely managing your finan-
cial life online.
Invest Online
Online investing and investment tracking is
fast, efficient, and often less expensive than
using an offline broker. The Internet also
makes it very easy to check the value of any
stock you are interested in. Many online com-
panies such as E*TRADE and Charles Schwab
let you place your own orders for a small fee.

No matter where you invest, do your research. The types of investment
fraud seen online mirrors the fraud perpetrated over the phone or
through the mail.
For example:
➟Hundreds of online investment newsletters offer
seemingly unbiased information, free of charge,
about featured companies or recommended stock
picks. While legitimate online newsletters can help
investors gather valuable information, many simply
offer useless information for a fee. If an investment
newsletter comes unsolicited to you, it’s probably 
a scam.
➟Criminals may use a combination of Internet tools to
help them look legitimate. They may build sophisti-
cated Web pages, send newsletters, post fake news on
investment Web sites and more. Then they may refer-
ence these and urge you to visit them as a way of ver-
ifying that you’ve checked several sources.
To invest wisely and steer clear of fraud, get the facts
from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s
Web site at www.sec.gov.
➟E-mail phishing scams (see Figure 13-1) may attempt
to get you to divulge your account numbers or pass-
words. No legitimate financial institution will ever
ask you for sensitive information via e-mail — or
notify you of a problem with your account via
e-mail. Discover more about phishing in Chapter 5.
While bank accounts are protected by government
insurance programs from theft, investment accounts
(online or offline) aren’t. Be particularly protective of
your investment accounts, and consider spreading
investments into several accounts so that your entire
nest egg isn’t put at risk from a single scam.

Bank Online
Banks go to great lengths to safeguard your information and online
transactions and there are protections in place to shield consumers in
the event of banking fraud. (See Figure 13-2.)
Banking and paying bills online is convenient, and it can be safer than
banking and bill paying in the physical world, where lost and stolen
mail and having discarded statements stolen from your trash are con-
cerns. Online account access allows you to check balances, transfer
funds between accounts, view statements, and pay bills online.
You can also choose to use a software product such as Quicken from
Intuit (see Figure 13-3) to manage your budget and bill paying and
synchronize with your bank records and pay bills online.
In most cases, the weakest link in online banking is the consumer. This
is good news because it means that you can control your online risk by
educating yourself.

Follow these steps to stay safer:
➟Make sure your computer has up-to-date versions of
anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and continue to
install all updates you receive from the software.
➟If you open an account with an online-only bank,
confirm that the bank is legitimate and that your
deposits are insured.
➟Create strong passwords (see Chapter 3 for informa-
tion about how to do this) for accessing your
account, and keep personal information private and
secure.
➟Never conduct financial transactions from a public
computer because you don’t know if these computers
are infected with malicious programs that may be
stealing your information.
➟Always type your bank’s Web address into your brow-
ser yourself or use your bookmark. (See Chapter 4.)
You can find the Web address on your statements or
by searching for your bank’s Web site using a search
engine.) If you click a link provided in an e-mail, you
may land on a site that looks legitimate, but isn’t. 
Protect Your Identity Online
Identity theft is a serious crime, and it occurs when criminals steal and
use your information to commit financial fraud or other crimes. These
actions can have a serious impact on your financial credibility and
security. Thieves or cyberbullies may use your information to ruin your
reputation, steal and sell your medical records, obtain loans in your
name, or misuse images of you. Whatever else these criminals steal and
do, at a minimum they take away your sense of security and safety.
The total cost of identity theft is astounding. In 2007, the cost in the
U.S. was $45 billion dollars. Business loss drives up business costs, so➟
267
Chapter 13: Watching Your Pennies Online

consumers pay this portion as well, just indirectly. The average victim
spends hundreds of hours trying to restore his or her identity.
Although most victims are discovering the abuse earlier (and quick
action is key in reducing the time it takes you to clean your records
up), it now takes longer on average to eliminate fraudulent transac-
tions from credit reports and other sources than ever before.
Stay alert to avoid this kind of attack, and take the following actions
wherever you roam online:
➟Be conservative with personal information online,
whether it’s on your social networking page, dating
site, discussion board, survey, quiz, or somewhere
else. ID thieves look to accumulate information
about you.
➟Never delay. If you see a questionable charge on an
account, check it out. The sooner you identify and
begin to solve a case of identity theft, the easier it is
to clean up.
ID theft may also be very emotionally distressing.
Most victims feel violated and frustrated, particularly
because they don’t know how or from where the
information was stolen. If you’re a victim of ID theft,
get help from the Identity Theft Resource Center at
www.idtheftcenter.org.
If one family member’s identity is compromised, it
increases the risk to other family members. If your
child or grandchild is a victim, for example, some of
your information may make its way into criminal
hands. Don’t assume that youth is any protection from
ID theft. Some children’s identities are stolen even
before they’re born if parents announce the child’s
name and expected birth date in a public way. If some-
thing happens to anybody in your family, take all the
steps given here to monitor your credit reports, finan-
cial accounts, and medical records to spot irregularities. 
➟

Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

Understand Medical ID Theft
It’s important that seniors know about medical identity theft because it
can have very serious consequences. Financial ID theft can threaten
your finances and reputation. Medical ID theft can threaten your life.
Those who use your identity to gain access to medical care or services
may introduce changes to your medical records to get what they are
after. For example they may want drugs for resale. To accomplish this
they may alter your records to show you have conditions that require
the drugs. This can put you at real risk in an emergency when a deci-
sion is based off false information. 
It can be very difficult to identify and to undo those changes.
Discovering medical identity theft can be harder to detect than finan-
cial identity theft and you may have to hunt to unearth it. Some peo-
ple discover medical identity theft when medical bills they aren’t
responsible for show up in the mail. Sometimes an insurance investi-
gator alerts victims, or doctors notice errors in patients’ medical files.
Based on some of the cases of medical identity theft that have come to
light, here’s some advice from www.worldprivacyforum.org:
➟Closely monitor any “Explanation of Benefits” sent
by an public or private health insurer.
➟Pro-actively request a listing of benefits from your
health insurers.
➟Request a copy of current medical files from each
health care provider.
➟File a police report.
➟Correct erroneous and false information in your file.
➟Keep an eye on your credit report.
➟Request an accounting of disclosures.
➟
269
Chapter 13: Watching Your Pennies Online

Online Personal Health Records
There is a push by the government, doctors, and insurance companies
to get all medical records online. The benefits are obvious: records
could be combined to provide the best overall medical history of a
patient, there could be instant access to critical information in emer-
gencies, and so on.
But placing your medical records online also leaves you extremely vul-
nerable if the database holding your records is compromised. There is
a lot of conjecture about how secure these records will be, but the real-
ity is we have significant data breaches of all types of secure records
and databases, even in the most sensitive military and national security
records.
You may have received a letter from Health and Human Services invit-
ing you to sign up with a company that provides PHR (Personal Health
Record) services, stating that the companies will guarantee your pri-
vacy. Be very cautious.
The quotes below are from the Department of Health and Human
Services brochure at www.medicare.gov/phr.
➟“Since you will have a unique user ID and password,
only you will be able to view your record. Most com-
panies that provide PHRs offer a secure site to protect
and keep your information safe.”
➟“Most health care providers and Health Plans who
offer PHRs must give you a Notice of Privacy
Practices, which tells you how they keep your per-
sonal information private and safe.”
The use of the word “most” in these statements is very concerning,
because this clearly means “not all.” If you choose to register for 
a Personal Health Record, understand that these records may be 
➟
270
Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

compromised and your sensitive medical history could then be in the
hands of criminals.
Understand the Risk of Identity Theft by Age
As a senior, you may feel particularly at risk for ID theft and financial
scams. In fact, 18–29-year-olds are most at risk because they most
likely haven’t yet damaged their credit, are less likely to check their
credit, are more likely to share too much information online, move 
frequently — so records go to others — and are more likely to apply
for credit cards without reading the fine print or considering the
source. (See Figure 13-4.)

Some people believe that if they have little money in their bank
account, there’s nothing to steal. Unfortunately, what matters isn’t just
how much you have in your bank account; it’s how far in debt the thief
can place you by using your information to apply for loans or purchase
expensive items on your credit. In fact, a criminal may leave the money
in your checking account untouched and drive up debt so that it takes
longer for you to be alerted the problem.

from Rutgers University to help you learn better
habits to prevent ID theft. Try it out at http://

Get Your Free Credit Reports
All people over the age of 14 or so need to be monitoring their credit
score, as this is one of the quickest ways to spot ID theft. Here are
some important facts about obtaining your credit reports:
➟You have the right to one free credit disclosure in a
12-month period from each of the three national
credit reporting companies — TransUnion (www.
transunion.com), Experian (www.experian.
com), and Equifax (www.equifax.com).
➟The easiest way to get these reports is through
AnnualCreditReport.com (see Figure 13-5), a service
created by these three credit institutions specifically
to help consumers get free annual reports. Simply go
to this site, answer some questions to verify your
identity, and submit your request. As of this writing,
➟
272
Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

all three agencies allow you to submit this request
online. (You may see offers that charge you for
reports, but why pay when you can use this site to get
them for free.)
➟You can also pay for credit monitoring services to
watch your credit for you. (See Figure 13-6.)
Figure 13-5
➟
273
Chapter 13: Watching Your Pennies Online

Figure 13-6
Freeze Your Credit
You may hear the terms security, credit freeze, and fraud alert. Here’s
what they mean:
A security or credit freeze is a request to a credit bureau to stop sharing
your credit file with potential creditors or insurance companies. You,
too, can’t open new credit while a freeze is in place. Individuals can
request that the credit bureau temporarily lift the freeze for the pur-
pose of obtaining new credit, although there may be a fee involved to
do so. A freeze is not 100 percent safe because some creditors issue
➟
274
Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

credit without pulling a credit report. Companies with whom you have
an existing relationship can still pull a report despite the freeze, and
your information may be given out for the purpose of prescreening
you for credit offers. Credit freezes cost about $10, unless you’ve been a
victim of ID theft — in which case, they’re free. Placing a freeze on
your accounts is an excellent safeguard.
A fraud alert is a less restrictive option that can help prevent fraud. An
alert doesn’t block new credit, but it does insert a comment on your
history that indicates that you may be a victim of fraud. Call the toll-
free fraud number of any one of the three major credit bureaus to
place a fraud alert on your credit report for 90 days. The other two
credit bureaus are automatically notified to place fraud alerts. All three
credit reports are then sent to you at no charge.
Continue Protecting Your Identity Online
After an identity theft, even when you’ve gone through all the steps to
restore your identity and financial standing, you remain at increased
risk of a recurrence because much of your identity doesn’t change.
You can change your credit card account number, close your bank
account, and fix a manipulated credit history, but your birth date, birth
place, mother’s maiden name, names of past employers, and other per-
sonal information never changes.
This information is likely to remain in criminal databases, and it has
the potential of being reused many times. Once you’ve been a victim,
you’ll need to be extra diligent in monitoring your identity forever.
You can take many significant steps to protect yourself, but there’s no
silver bullet or magic solution, especially as you may not be the one
exposing your information. Publicly available property tax records,
court records, and housing records all make finding information about
you easier.
➟
275
Chapter 13: Watching Your Pennies Online

Follow these steps to keep yourself safer from ID thieves:
➟As discussed elsewhere in this chapter, everyone
above the age of 14 needs to actively monitor his
credit history by obtaining credit reports at least three
times a year.
➟Consider if you want all, part, or none of your infor-
mation viewable in online phone directory searches.
It usually costs money to keep your information pri-
vate (often referred to as a privacy tax), but the few
dollars it costs may be well worth it to you.
➟Check your county Web site for your property records
to be sure these do not also show your loan papers,
social security numbers or other information that is
not required by law. Check to see if birth, marriage,
and death certificates are available online, and if so,
how much information these contain. Demand that
sensitive information be removed.
➟If your identity is stolen, contact your bank(s) and
other financial institutions immediately. Contact
local law enforcement and file a report. Contact your
medical insurance company. Freeze your credit with
the three credit reporting companies. (Ideally, you
freeze this now and leave it frozen to avoid the
fraud.)
➟If you’re a victim of identity theft, go to the FTC’s
Identity Theft Web site (www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/
microsites/idtheft; see Figure 13-7) to get
information about additional steps you may need 
to take.

family. Your identity theft means friends and family
may also be affected, depending on the information
stolen or abused.

Connect with Others with 
Similar Concerns
When you have a medical condition, it’s great to talk to someone else
who’s gone through the same experience. Although it’s no replacement
for your doctor’s advice, sharing with others may help you through a
stressful time. Here are some things to keep in mind when connecting
with others about health-related topics:
➟People with serious medical conditions often share a
great deal of information about themselves that can
lead to identity theft. To stay safer when sharing infor-
mation about a health-related issue, talk about the ill-
ness but refrain from sharing personally identifying
information.
➟Always take others’ comments with a grain of salt.
These people aren’t experts, may be self-diagnosing
inaccurately, may not share the same condition you
have, or may have had unique responses to drugs or
treatments. Ask your doctor the same questions you ask
others online so that you get a balanced perspective.
➟Sites that are primarily medical information sites, such
as WebMD (www.webmd.com), host forums and mes-
sage boards on a wide variety of health topics. Choose
a reputable site for participating in discussions.
➟Some social networking sites provide ways to interact
with other members over health-related issues.
However, you should always be cautious about sharing
health information if you’re identifiable, for example,
from information in your social network profile.
➟For those with addictions like alcoholism, there are
sites such as SoberCircle (www.sobercircle.com;
shown in Figure 14-1) and DailyStrength (www.
dailystrength.org), where the encouragement 
of others can help you with recovery.
➟
280
Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

Figure 14-1
➟Some sites focus on emotional support for people
with specific serious diseases. One example is
PatientsLikeMe (www.patientslikeme.com;
shown in Figure 14-2), a social networking health site
with communities for ALS, MS, Parkinson’s Disease,
HIV, and mood disorders such as depression and
bipolar disorder, progressive supranuclear palsy, mul-
tiple system atrophy, and Devic’s disease.
➟If you find the behavior or comments of anyone you
meet in a health-related discussion online to be rude,
aggressive, or invasive, stop the communication and
report the person to the site immediately.
A site to check out if you’re dealing with cancer is
ChemoCoach (www.chemocoach.com), which cov-
ers several types of cancer in its discussion forums.

Be Wise about Using Online Medical Advice
There are very reputable medical Web sites that provide a wealth of
information about a broad spectrum of medical conditions. On the
other hand, there are also plenty of quack sites that dispense entirely
spurious medical “advice.” So how can you tell the difference?
Here’s some advice about online medical advice sites:
➟It may seem obvious, but one of the best resources for
advice on good medical sites is your doctor. Ask your
health professional if he recommends a Web site for
your specific condition.
➟Look for the Health on the Net Foundation (HON)
seal of approval. (See Figure 14-3.) This seal is given
to only those sites that are accredited against a strict
set of principles. If you don’t see this seal on the site,
search for sites that have it.
➟A company called URAC gives accreditation to health-
related sites. A committee of experts regularly reviews
accredited sites for accuracy and quality.
➟
282
Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

Figure 14-3
➟Remember that the nomenclature .org at the end of
a site name denotes a non-profit organization rather
than a commercial business. A site such as Mayo
Clinic.org (www.mayoclinic.org; shown in Figure
14-4), focused on research and education, won’t
bombard you with advertisements for healthcare
products, and visiting the site may be less likely to
result in spam.
Your health and the health of those you love is not
something to take chances on. Although qualified
medical Web sites provide a wealth of information
that can help you understand symptoms and illnesses,
no source will provide you with better or more reli-
able information than a well-trained medical special-
ist who knows you, your family members, or your pet.
Before treating yourself based on information you
find online, always consult with your medical advisor.
Remember many medical Web sites are for-profit busi-
nesses, and as such are there to make money. This
isn’t a bad thing per se, but you do need to be aware
of how they make their money, and if their recom-
mendations are biased towards their own products.
You also need to be clear about how they treat any
information you disclose about yourself, as they may
sell information to drug and medical companies. It’s
critical that you’re aware of the terms and conditions
and privacy rights to make informed choices about
what information you share.

Discount Drugs and Online Prescriptions
Buying drugs online can be private and convenient, but you have to
make sure you’re dealing with a reputable pharmacy. The U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) recommends using only Web sites of
U.S.–based pharmacies licensed by a state’s board of pharmacy. Check
out the Web site of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy
(NABP; www.nabp.net), which can tell you how to get in touch with
your state’s board. This site also offers a list of online pharmacies that
have been accredited through its Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice
Sites (VIPPS) program. (See Figure 14-5.) If you live in a country other
than the U.S., check with your regional authority to get similar guidance.
Also, according to the U.S. FTC, avoid sites that
➟Don’t require a prescription or prescription

➟Don’t provide their physical business addresses and
phone numbers.
➟Are based outside the U.S. or aren’t licensed by the
state board of pharmacy where they’re based.
Regarding buying drugs from online sites not based in
the U.S., the U.S. FDA has stated this: “The FDA, due
to the current state of their regulations, has taken the
position that virtually all shipments of prescription
drugs imported from a Canadian pharmacy by a U.S.
consumer will violate the law.”
Don’t gamble with your health. The money you save
could cost you dearly. Disreputable sellers may send
drugs that are fake, expired, mislabeled, or the wrong
dosage. The drugs may contain dangerous ingredients,
or may not be stored or shipped correctly. If the site is
based outside the U.S., there’s very little that the U.S.
government can do if there is a problem.

Medical Identity Theft
With the increase in personal medical records being stored online,
medical ID theft is of great concern. People with serious medical condi-
tions may be more willing to provide information that leads to identity
and financial theft. Just because you share information about a health-
related issue online doesn’t mean you have to share personally identify-
ing information.
Medical ID theft may result in your medical records becoming inaccu-
rate, as insurance claims for conditions you don’t have go into your file.
You may end up paying thousands of dollars for deductibles or treat-
ment of uncovered conditions. Your credit could be damaged, and
insurance cancelled.
Medical ID theft is a lucrative business. Your medical coverage can be
leveraged or sold in a variety of ways:
➟Using your insurance and your identity someone with
no health coverage can buy prescription drugs online
or get medical treatment charged to your insurance
policy.
➟Your information can be used to submit false claims
to insurance companies, and the criminal collect the
payments.
➟
286

Vigilance is your best defense against Medical ID theft. Always review
any medical bills and insurance notices for charges that seem suspect.
Online, there are a few key principles to follow. (See Chapter 13 for
more detailed information on ID theft.)
➟Don’t personally identify yourself if discussing your
health online, either in your own blogs, or in discus-
sion forums; this includes making sure your screen
name does not give you away. 
➟Make your blog private if you intend to publish any
health-related information.
Never take online health quizzes or forward e-mails
with such surveys or quizzes. 
➟Never provide information such as your insurance
policy number, doctor’s name and location, or
medicare/Medicaid policy numbers to anyone online.
Not in e-mail, IM, or any other online communica-
tion tool. You may need to provide some pieces of
this information when logging into your insurance
company’s or doctor’s Web site, but be extremely cau-
tious to ensure you are on their legitimate site. 
➟Check your health insurance provider’s Web site (see
Figure 14-6) for advice on avoiding medical ID theft.
Unlike credit information, which is held by the three
credit reporting bureaus, medical records are often
scattered all over, in doctor’s offices, insurance compa-
nies, and pharmacies, so it’s hard to track false infor-
mation. Under HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act), the federal law that addresses
medical privacy, you’re entitled to a copy of medical
record documents, although you may have to pay for
it. If there’s an error, you can add a correction to the
record, but you can’t have information deleted.
➟
287
Chapter 14: Healthcare That Makes You Feel Better

Figure 14-6
There are several outcomes of medical ID theft, which
can be harder to undo than financial ID theft. Stay
vigilant, and challenge any questionable charge imme-
diately. If you suspect fraud, have a notice placed on
your account so the insurance company double-checks
before paying claims. 
Warning Signs of Health Fraud
Health-fraud con artists use the same tactics and phrases repeatedly.
Learning to spot them can help you avoid scam sites and offers.
Health-fraud red flags, according to the FTC, include
➟Web sites that offer quick and dramatic cures for a
wide variety of ailments. A site may claim that a treat-
ment is beneficial in treating cancer, ulcer, prostate
problems, heart trouble, and more, for example.
➟Statements that suggest the product can treat or cure
diseases. You might see claims that a product shrinks
tumors, cures impotency, and the like.
➟
288
Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

➟Promotions that use words like scientific break-
through, miraculous cure, secret ingredient, and
ancient remedy. (See Figure 14-7.)
➟Text that uses impressive-sounding terms like hunger
stimulation point and thermogenesis for a weight-loss
product. These terms are sometimes plucked out of
scientific journals, but they may have nothing to do
with the disease or condition you have — let alone
legitimize the cure you’re being peddled.
➟Undocumented case histories or personal testimonials
by consumers or doctors claiming amazing results.
“After eating a teaspoon of this product each day, my
pain is completely gone.” Most are made up, and oth-
ers are hearsay. Some patients’ recoveries may be due
to a remission of the disease from previous or concur-
rent treatments.
➟Limited availability and advance payment require-
ments. Hurry! This offer will not last, for example.
Figure 14-7
Beware of these types of “treatments”
➟
289
Chapter 14: Healthcare That Makes You Feel Better

➟Promises of no-risk money-back guarantees. If after
30 days you have not lost at least four pounds each
week, your uncashed check will be returned to you, and
the like.
➟Promises of an easy fix. For many serious diseases,
there are no cures, only therapies to help manage
them.
➟Paranoid accusations — suggesting that healthcare
providers and legitimate manufacturers are in league
with each other to suppress this miracle cure.
Look closely at the vocabulary that these Web sites
use. The words in days can mean any amount of time.
The term rapid is ambiguous.
Beware of products offered as a Free Trial! — You pay
only shipping and handling. In these cases, the charges
levied for shipping and handling are exhorbitant and
one way scammers make money. Think about it: If the
pills cost them 45 cents and the mailing costs them
two dollars, but they charge $19.95 in shipping and
handling, they still earn $17.50 from every customer.
If they can scam ten thousand consumers, they earn
$175,000 dollars.
Surveys on Health Can Make You Sick
Quizzes and surveys you find online (such as the one shown in Figure
14-8), including those on social networking sites, are usually entertain-
ing and may seem like a harmless pastime. But quiz and survey compa-
nies are for-profit businesses. Because consumer information is a
commodity, you should assume that information you enter in quizzes
and surveys is being sold. (Chapter 8 provides more information about
quizzes and surveys.)
➟
290
Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

Figure 14-8
Here are some things to keep in mind if you’re tempted to take online
quizzes:
➟Seniors especially need to be careful about taking
health-related surveys. For example, the information
from a medical quiz may be passed directly to phar-
maceutical companies, online drugstores, or insur-
ance companies. The medical quiz shown above for
example asks extremely detailed questions — clear
down to how often do you eat processed meats in a
week — and routes all this sensitive information
instantly to CVS Pharmacy, that uses it to push its
products based on your responses. 
➟Your quiz and survey information may be used to
limit coverage of preexisting conditions, deny cover-
age and more. The ramifications of this do not end
with you, the information may also impact the insur-
ance coverage of your children and grandchildren. 
➟
291
Chapter 14: Healthcare That Makes You Feel Better

➟Make sure you understand the reputation, privacy
policies, and terms of use of the site creating or host-
ing the quizzes. Our recommendation is clear: NEVER
take an online medical quiz or survey. If you choose
to do so, at least consider the answers to the follow-
ing questions:
• Why did the company create this quiz?
• What will the company do with the information?
➟Could taking a quiz impact my medical coverage or
the coverage of family members?
Miracle Medicine For Sale
One of the most loathsome forms of online fraud is perpetrated against
people struggling with serious illnesses who are eager for a cure from
any quarter, no matter how unlikely. Consider the following:
➟Internet health fraud is a growing problem. The FDA
describes health fraud as offering “articles of
unproven effectiveness that are promoted to improve
health, well being, or appearance.”
➟Scammers’ products run the gamut — from miracle
drugs (see Figure 14-9) to medical devices, foods, and
even cosmetics. Whether offered in the form of a fruit
juice, a vitamin pill, salve, or inhalant, the companies
that offer these products provide jargon and hype
with amazing claims of success to particularly vulner-
able people.
➟Many victims of health fraud suffer from a variety 
of illnesses and conditions, including cancer, AIDS,
heart disease, diabetes, herpes, obesity, and sexual
dysfunction.
➟
292
Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

Figure 14-9
People with these and other conditions should be aware of several
problems with online offers for alternative drugs and cures.
➟The goal of these scams is to steal money by selling
hope. At best, patients are purchasing placebos where
only their pockets incur damage — some end up
throwing their life’s savings, even incurring debt in
their pursuit of health.
➟These products may be contaminated, diluted, ineffec-
tive, out of date, or have harmful side effects. Any
product, synthetic or natural, potent enough to work
like a drug is potent enough to cause side effects, and
any treatments you use without a prescription can
have adverse reactions, particularly in conjunction
with medications you’re already taking. Many strug-
gling with illnesses are paying for products that
abbreviate rather than prolong their lives.
➟
293
Chapter 14: Healthcare That Makes You Feel Better

➟Beyond the direct risks of damage from spurious
cures, there’s an indirect risk: Taking these instead of
proven treatments could mean that patients get sicker.
➟Don’t be fooled by the term natural (see Figure
14-10) — it doesn’t equate to safe. Many natural
ingredients are lethal — cyanide, for example, is
found in many common plants. Conversely, 60 per-
cent of over-the-counter drugs and 25 percent of pre-
scription drugs are based on natural ingredients.
Alternative cures have no exclusivity on the use of
natural ingredients.
How rampant is health fraud online? Consider the results for some
health cures from a recent Google search:
➟44,800 results for black salve, a cancer treatment
which claims to draw cancer out through the skin but
in reality burns healthy skin tissue and causes severe
scarring.
➟11,100 results for Hoxsey cancer treatment, an
unproven herbal remedy that the FDA has tried to get
rid of since the 1950s.
➟3,150,000 results for diabetes cures. (Diabetes can’t be
cured, just managed.)
➟Weight loss gets a whopping 70,300,000 results.
Weight-loss pills alone commands 2,120,000 links.
There just isn’t a guaranteed weight-loss supplement
that the five o’clock news and your doctor missed,
although there are several that can cause serious harm.
Although many search results on health cures lead to
scholarly articles, a great many more lead to fraudu-
lent sites. It’s easy to create a slick site and pose as a
medical practitioner online and make wild claims that
link to a variety of fraudulent supporting medical
studies.
➟
294
Part III: Protecting Your Wealth and Your Health

Figure 14-10
Products that cure serious diseases are widely reported in the media,
not discovered on obscure Web sites. 
The older you are, the more heavily targeted you are likely to be for
these types of scams so be especially vigilant. 
To check out a health product you encounter online, the FDA suggests
that you take these steps:
➟Talk to a doctor or other health professional whom
you trust, and follow their advice.
➟Check the source. If you are looking for prescription
drugs, follow the advice listed above for finding certi-
fied pharmacies. If you are looking for other types of
health products, make sure the company is based in
your country by calling their phone number and veri-
fying their address. If you’re a United States citizen, ➟
295
Chapter 14: Healthcare That Makes You Feel Better

for example, you can file complaints against U.S.
companies, but there is little than can be done if you
don’t get what was promised from a foreign-based
company.
➟Check with the Better Business Bureau or your attor-
ney general’s office to see if complaints have been
lodged against the company.
➟Check with a relevant professional medical group
such as the American Heart Association or National
Arthritis Foundation to see if they endorse the Web
site or product.
➟Contact your local FDA office (find the number in the
blue pages of your phone book, or go to www.fda.
gov/default.htm, shown in Figure 14-11) to find
out if they’ve taken any action against the product or
its marketer.
➟Report fraud to the service provider where the ad was
posted, to the Better Business Bureau, and to the FDA.

our computer contains software and files
that can be damaged in several different
ways. One major source of damage is from
malicious attacks that are delivered via the
Internet.
➟Some people create damaging programs
called viruses specifically designed to get
into your computer hard drive and
destroy or scramble data.
➟Companies might download adware on
your computer, which causes pop-up ads
to appear, slowing down your computer’s
performance.
➟Spyware is another form of malicious
software that you might download by
clicking a link or opening a file attach-
ment. Spyware sits on your computer and
tracks your activities, whether for use by a
legitimate company in selling you prod-
ucts or by a criminal element to steal
your identity.
Microsoft provides security features within
Windows Vista that help to keep your com-
puter and information safe, whether you’re at
home or traveling with a laptop computer.

Chapter

In this chapter, we introduce you to the major concepts of computer
security and cover Windows Vista security features that allow you to do
the following:
➟Understand computer security and why you need it.
➟Run periodic updates to Windows, which installs
security solutions and patches. (Essentially, patches fix
problems with the operating system.)
➟Enable a firewall, which is a security feature that
keeps your computer safe from outsiders and helps
you avoid several kinds of attacks on your data.
➟Work with Windows Defender, which is new in
Windows Vista. Windows Defender is a built-in solu-
tion for managing all your security settings centrally.
➟Set up Windows Defender to run automatically.
➟Set up trusted Web sites so that Windows doesn’t dis-
play alerts when you try to go to those sites. Make set-
tings so that sites you trust are displayed and sites you
don’t trust are blocked.
➟Protect your network with an encryption key.
➟Discover how to use cell phones more safely.
Understand Computer Security
When you buy a car, it has certain safety features built in. After you
drive it off the lot, you might find that the manufacturer slipped up
and either recalls your car or requests that you go to the dealer’s service
department to have a faulty part replaced. In addition, you need to
drive defensively to keep your car from being damaged in daily use.
➟
302
Part IV: Being Proactive

Your computer is similar to your car in terms of the need for safety. It
comes with an operating system (such as Microsoft Windows) built in,
and that operating system has security features. Sometimes that operat-
ing system has flaws, and you need to get an update to keep it secure.
And as you use your computer, you’re exposing it to dangerous condi-
tions and situations that you have to guard against.
Threats to your computer security can come from a file you copy from a
disc you insert into your computer, but most of the time, the danger is
from a program that you download from the Internet. These downloads
can happen when you click a link, open an attachment in an e-mail, or
download one piece of software without realizing that malware (mali-
cious software) is attached to it.
You need to be aware of these three main types of dangerous programs:
➟A virus is a little program that some nasty person
thought up to spread around the Internet and infect
computers. A virus can do a variety of things, but typi-
cally, it attacks your data, deleting files, scrambling
data, or making changes to your system settings that
cause your computer to grind to a halt.
➟Spyware consists of programs responsible for tracking
what you do with your computer. Some spyware sim-
ply helps companies you do business with track your
activities so that they can figure out how to sell you
things; other spyware is used for more insidious pur-
poses, such as stealing your passwords.
➟Adware is the computer equivalent of telemarketing
phone calls at dinner time. After adware is down-
loaded onto your computer, you’ll get annoying pop-
up windows trying to sell you things all day long.
Beyond the annoyance, adware can quickly clog up
your computer. Its performance slows down, and it’s
hard to get anything done at all.
➟
303
Chapter 15: Using Technology to Keep You Safer

To protect your information and your computer from these various
types of malware, you can do several things:
➟You can buy and install an anti-virus, anti-spyware,
or anti-adware program. It’s critical that you install
an anti-virus program, such as those from McAfee,
Symantec (see Figure 15-1), or Trend Micro, or the
freely downloadable AVG Free. People are coming up
with new viruses every day, so it’s important that you
use software that is up-to-date with the latest virus def-
initions and protects your computer from them. Many
anti-virus programs are purchased by yearly subscrip-
tion, which gives you access to updated virus defini-
tions that the company constantly gathers throughout
the year. Also, be sure to run a scan of your computer
on a regular basis. For convenience, you can use set-
tings in the software to set up automatic updates and
scans. Consult your program’s Help tool for instruc-
tions on how to use these features.
➟Install a program that combines tools for detecting
adware and spyware. Windows Vista has a built-in
program, Windows Defender, which includes an anti-
spyware feature. (We cover Windows Defender tools
covered later in this chapter.) If you don’t have
Windows Vista, you can purchase programs such as
Spyware Doctor from PC Tools.
➟Use Windows tools to keep Windows up-to-date
with security features and fixes to security problems.
You can also turn on a firewall, which is a feature that
stops other people or programs from accessing your
computer without your permission. We cover these
two features in this chapter.
➟

Understand Windows Update Options
When a new operating system like Windows Vista is released, it’s been
thoroughly tested; however, when the product is in general use, the
manufacturer begins to find a few problems or security gaps that it
couldn’t anticipate. For that reason, companies such as Microsoft
release updates to their software, both to fix those problems and deal
with new threats to computers that appeared after the software release.
Windows Update is a tool you can use to make sure your computer has
the most up-to-date security measures in place. You can set Windows
Update to work in a few different ways. Here’s how:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Windows Update.
2. Click the Change Settings link on the left side of the
Windows Update window.
➟
305
Chapter 15: Using Technology to Keep You Safer

3. In the resulting dialog box (see Figure 15-2), check the
option you want from among these settings:
• Install Updates Automatically: With this setting
enabled, Windows Update starts at a time of day you
specify, but your computer must be on for it to work. If
you turn off your computer, the automatic update will
start when you next turn on your computer, and it might
shut down your computer in the middle of your work to
complete the installation.
• Download Updates But Let Me Choose Whether to
Install Them: With this setting enabled, Windows
Update downloads updates and notifies you (through a
little pop-up message on your taskbar) when they’re
available, but you get to decide when the updates are
installed and when your computer reboots (turns off and
then on) to complete the installation. This is our pre-
ferred setting because we have control and won’t be
caught unawares by a computer reboot.
• Check for Updates But Let Me Choose Whether to
Download and Install Them: With this setting enabled,
you neither download nor install updates until you 
say so, but Windows notifies you that new updates are
available.
• Never Check for Updates: You can stop Windows from
checking for updates, and you’ll want to check for them
yourself, manually. (See the next section.) This puts your
computer at a bit more risk, but it’s useful for you to
know how to perform a manual update. For example,
you might discover that a new update is available, and
you might need that update to proceed with a task (such
as getting updated drivers or a language pack.)
4. If you want to have Windows recommend updates for
your system, select the Recommended Updates checkbox.

No matter which Windows Update setting you choose (see the preced-
ing section), you can run a manual update at any time. To do so, make
sure you have an active Internet connection and follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Check for Updates.
2. In the resulting Windows Update window, click Check for
Updates. Windows thinks about this for a while, so feel
free to page through a magazine for a minute or two.
3. In the resulting window, shown in Figure 15-3, click the
View Available Updates link.

4. In the resulting window, which shows the available
updates (see Figure 15-4), select the check boxes for the
updates you want to install. (It usually doesn’t hurt to just
accept all updates, if you have the time to download them
all.) Then click the Install button.
5. A window appears, showing the progress of your installa-
tion. When the installation is complete, you might get a
message telling you that it’s a good idea to restart your
computer to complete the installation. Click the Restart
Now button.
You can set up Windows Update to run at the same
time every day. Click the Change Settings link in the
left pane of the Windows Update window (refer to
Figure 15-3) and choose the frequency (such as every
day) and time of day to check for and install updates.
Click this link to check for updates
➟
308
Part IV: Being Proactive

Figure 15-4
If you set Windows Update to run automatically, be
forewarned that when it runs, it might also automati-
cally restart your computer to finish the update instal-
lation sequence. Although it displays a pop-up
message warning that it’s about to do this, it’s easy to
miss. Then you might be startled to find that whatever
you’re working on shuts down and your computer
restarts when you least expect it. Pick a time to check
for updates when you know the computer will be on
but not likely to be in use (for example, two in the
morning if your computer is always on).
Enable the Windows Firewall
A firewall is a program that protects your computer from the outside
world, preventing others from accessing your computer and stopping the
downloading of dangerous programs such as viruses. With a firewall on,
Click this button
➟
309
Chapter 15: Using Technology to Keep You Safer

if you try to access sites or download software, you’re asked whether you
want to allow such access. Be aware, however, that you must turn on
your firewall before you connect to the Internet for it to be effective.
Follow these steps to turn on the firewall in Windows Vista:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Check This Computer’s
Security Status.
2. In the Windows Security Center window that appears (see
Figure 15-5), verify that the Windows Firewall has a status
of On. If it isn’t, click the Windows Firewall link in the
left pane of the window and then click the Change
Settings link in the resulting dialog box. Note that you
have to have a user account with administrator permis-
sions to change these settings. You can control this
through the Control Panel under the User Accounts and
Family Safety settings.

4. Click the Close button to close Windows Security Center
and the Control Panel. Your firewall is now enabled and
should stay enabled unless you go in and change the 
setting.
Anti-virus and security software programs might offer
their own firewall protection, and they might display
messages asking whether you want to switch. Check
their features against the Windows Firewall features and
then decide. (Usually, most firewall features are compa-
rable. The important thing is to have one activated.)

shown in Figure 15-7. To unlock the settings, click the
lock symbol again and enter your user authentication
information (username and password).
Run a Windows Defender Scan
Spyware and adware cause pop-up ads to appear on your screen or
track your online activities. With the amount of spyware and adware
attempting to download to your computer, an anti-spyware/adware 
program is a must-have security tool. If you don’t guard against these,
those annoying pop-ups will be the least of your problem. Eventually,
these programs will slow your computer performance to a crawl.
Several good free programs are available, or use your operating system’s
tools (such as Windows Defender, in Windows Vista). With some pro-
grams, you may need to purchase a subscription to get automatic
updates. As with anti-virus software, you can set up anti-spyware/
adware to run scans automatically at a specific time.
If you use Windows Defender to detect spyware, you must run a scan of
your computer system on a regular basis, which searches your computer
for any problem files. You set Windows Defender to run scans automat-
ically, or you can manually run a scan at any time. To adjust these set-
tings, follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Windows Defender.
2. In the resulting Windows Defender window, click the
down-pointing arrow on the Scan button (if you click the
Scan button itself the scan begins). (See Figure 15-8.) In
the resulting menu, choose one of three options:
• Quick Scan: This runs a scan of the likeliest spots on
your computer where spyware might lurk. In many cases,
this quicker scanning process finds most, if not all, prob-
lems and is good choice for a daily automatic scan.
➟
313
Chapter 15: Using Technology to Keep You Safer

• Full Scan: This scan checks every single file and folder
on your computer and gives any currently running pro-
grams the once-over. However, be aware that during a
Full Scan your computer might run a little more slowly.
• Custom Scan: This scan allows you to customize where
to scan. This is helpful if you suspect that a particular
drive or folder harbors a problem.
3. If you choose Quick Scan or Full Scan, the scan begins
immediately. If you choose Custom Scan, you can click
the Select button in the Select Scan Options dialog box
that appears. Then, in the Select Drives and Folders to
Scan dialog box (See Figure 15-9.), select drives, files, and
folders to scan. Click OK. Back in the Select Scan Options
dialog box, click Scan Now.

Figure 15-9
4. When a scan is complete, a dialog box appears, listing any
instances of spyware that were found and deleted or
informing you that no spyware was found. Click the Close
button to close the Windows Defender window.
The History button in Windows Defender reviews
Windows Defender’s activities and actions. This is
especially useful if you choose to run scans manually
and don’t remember whether you ran one recently. In
that window, you can also view your settings for
Microsoft SpyNet. By default, Windows Defender sets
you up with a basic membership in SpyNet so that
your computer automatically reports actions to
remove spyware to Microsoft. 
An advanced membership is also available. Like the basic membership,
it doesn’t cost you anything. It alerts you when new threats are detected
and also provides Microsoft with more data about your computer —
and some personal information might get through as well.

Protect Yourself on the Go: Cell Phone Safety
For most people, it’s hard to imagine how we managed before we had
mobile (cell) phones. Most cell phones today are actually small com-
puters with rich feature sets. Before you buy a phone for yourself or
your grandchild, ask these questions:
Select your encryption type
➟
328
Part IV: Being Proactive

➟Does the phone or device have Internet access? If
you want to check e-mail or use the Web to look up
restaurants or directions when you’re on the road,
you need Internet access.
➟Does the phone with Internet access offer filters
that block content that could be harmful to chil-
dren or offensive to you? Is the filter turned on? If
the filter isn’t on by default, ask the sales person to
turn it on for you in the store and help you set appro-
priate filter levels.
➟Does the phone or device have location (GPS)
capability? GPS allows you to let your phone’s loca-
tion be tracked. This is useful for emergencies, such as
a car accident when you can dial 911. If the phone
doesn’t have GPS capability, 911 may not be able to
identify your location. If you need to, you should be
able to block this capability or limit it so that your
grandchild can’t grant access to predators who are try-
ing to track your location.
➟Is the phone or device Bluetooth enabled? Bluetooth
is a technology that allows a mobile phone to seek, dis-
cover, and talk to other Bluetooth-enabled devices in
the area. This capability is available in some cars so
that you can talk hands-free while driving, which is, in
fact, required by law in many states. However, with
Bluetooth enabled, nearby devices can access informa-
tion on your phone. When Bluetooth functionality is
turned off, other devices can’t detect the phone, pull
information from it, or send information to it.
Here are some additional cell phone safety tips: 
➟Know how to report theft of the device. You may
need to provide hardware information found within
the device, under the battery. If you don’t have this
➟
329
Chapter 15: Using Technology to Keep You Safer

information written down, you surely won’t be able
to find it once the phone is stolen.
➟Know how to report harassment or bullying. The
carrier should have a clear set of procedures you can
use to report any malicious calls. It’s best to know
these in advance of harassment.
When buying a cell phone and/or signing up for cell phone service,
consider whether you should get a pre-paid account or an account that
bills charges monthly. Depending on your phone usage, it may be more
economical to get an account where you buy minutes, rather than pay-
ing a monthly fee and taxes whether you use the phone that month or
not. If you use the phone only when you go on trips, for example, 
a pre-paid plan such as one offered by Tracfone (find this at www.
tracfone.com, shown Figure 15-20) makes sense.

Knowing Your
Rights and
Making a
Difference
You are part of the brave new world of the
Internet. This is a frontier in which laws,
ethical standards, and common-sense
approaches to daily behavior are still evolving.
The way you behave, the way you treat others,
the way you allow yourself to be treated, and
how you hold companies and governments
responsible for their behavior will help to
shape this world.
In order to hold up your end, you have to
understand what your rights are and what you
should demand of others — both individuals
and companies. In this chapter, we explore
those rights, the recourse you have if you’re the
victim of certain types of abuse, and what you
can and should demand of online entities to
leave your mark on this world for yourself and
future generations.

It’s Never the Victim’s Fault
In any crime, the predator bears the entire blame.
➟Predators frequently try to make a victim believe that
the abuse was the victim’s fault. If that person feels
stupid, guilty, or ashamed, he or she will be much
less likely to report it.
➟Predators who use emotions to help achieve their
goals — whether their aim is financial or sexual —
often try to convince their victims that the interaction
was something they wanted. People who are lonely or
have low self esteem are particularly susceptible to
this tactic.
➟If you’re victimized online or offline, don’t blame
yourself. Preserve whatever evidence you may have —
e-mails, instant messages, purchases, and so on —
and report the abuse to both the service provider and
your local law enforcement agency. It doesn’t matter
where the criminal says he is, you always report
crimes against you to local law enforcement, and they
will contact other jurisdictions if needed. Your actions
may help to save another person from the heartache
that you’ve experienced.
There’s no such thing as consensual sex between
adults and minors. Sexual acts with minors are illegal
and exploitive. As a society, everyone must be commit-
ted to protecting minors — even when the minor acts
against his or her own best interests. Whether you are
a caregiver, grandparent, uncle or aunt, or friend of a
young person, you owe it to the minor to learn how
to protect her. See Chapter 11 for more about how to
do this.

ID Theft Victims’ Rights
If you’re a victim of ID theft, you may have months of work ahead of
you to clear up your records, but if you know your rights, you can move
forward more confidently. Although state regulations may vary (see
Figure 16-1), here are some of the provisions you should check into:
➟Limitations imposed on collection agencies: A col-
lection agency may not call a debtor more than one
time in 180 days in order to collect on debts associ-
ated with an identity theft, as long as the victim for-
wards information regarding the alleged theft. A
victim must provide the following:
•
A written statement describing the nature of the
fraud or theft and identifying the documents
and/or accounts involved.
•
A certified copy of a police report. According to
the FTC, “In your report, you should give as much
information as you can about the crime, including
anything you know about the dates of the identity
theft, the fraudulent accounts opened and the
alleged identity thief.” Detailed information
should specifically identify the relevant financial
institutions, account numbers, check numbers,
and so on.
•
A copy of a government-issued photo identifica-
tion card dated before the date of the identity
theft, such as your driver’s license or passport.
•
A statement that a debt is under dispute as the
result of identity theft. Collection agencies are pro-
hibited from calling consumers about transactions
that are identified as fraudulent.
➟
333
Chapter 16: Knowing Your Rights and Making a Difference

Figure 16-1
Under certain limited circumstances, a collection
agency may not be liable for repeated contact with a
debtor, even contacts that would otherwise violate the
statute. This is the case if it acts in good faith and the
contacts are covered by any one of several exceptions.

➟Limitations imposed on reporting agencies: Within
thirty days of receiving proof of a consumer’s identifi-
cation and a copy of a filed police report verifying the
claim of identity theft, a credit reporting agency must
•
Permanently block information from a credit
report that may be the result of identity theft.
•
Tell the entities furnishing information covered by

Your Rights Regarding Spam
The federal CAN-SPAM Act (see Figure 16-2) went into effect on
January 1, 2004. Federal lawmakers created The CAN-SPAM Act
(Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing
Act of 2003) to help stop the onslaught of spam. The CAN-SPAM Act
preempts all state law that regulates commercial e-mail, except with
regard to how state law prohibits falsity or deception.
Figure 16-2
The federal statute
➟Requires that senders of commercial e-mail allow
people to opt out of receiving more e-mail.

Your Internet Safety Bill of Rights
Everyone’s sense of safety and content-appropriateness varies some-
what, depending on their own moral compass, the country they live in,
their social peer group, and the situations they find themselves in.
Risk aversion or risk tolerance thresholds, like morality-based filter
options, should be easy-to-set clear choices. Unfortunately, all too
often, no choice is provided, or default choices are assumed.
The first step to take charge of your Internet experience is to know your
rights as a user.
All Internet users have the right to a safe Internet experience. Your
safety and the safety of your family on the Internet should not be left to
features a company adds at the last minute (add-ons) or those you have
to pay extra for. You can’t buy a new car without safety belts or air bags;
you shouldn’t have to settle for Internet products or services that fail to
offer safety in the same basic way.
➟
336
Part IV: Being Proactive

In a nutshell, we believe every online consumer has these rights:
➟You have the right to an informed online experience.
•
You should know in advance about any potential
risks in Web programs and services such as
Internet dating services, social networking or blog-
ging sites, or instant messaging programs, so that
you can appropriately respond and make safe
choices.
•
You have the right to complete information about
every safety feature in a product or service (see
Figure 16-3), and safety recommendations by fea-
ture should be easy to discover. At the bare mini-
mum, you should be able to find safety infor-
mation in the Help section that specifically covers
how to apply every feature. Ideally, however, the
program would give safety advice at key points,
such as when you type in information or before
you post a picture.
•
When services are upgraded, you have the right to
be informed of new features or changes to exist-
ing features and their impact on your safety. You
should also have a clear way to opt out of any fea-
tures you’re uncomfortable with. For example, if
changes are made to a subscription you’ve paid
for and you want to cancel, you should be able to
get a refund for remaining time.
➟You have the right to set your own terms for your
online experience (within the constraints of the law).
•
You have the right to get content that matches
your values and blocks content you don’t wish to
see, no matter what your age.
➟
337
Chapter 16: Knowing Your Rights and Making a Difference

Figure 16-3
•
You have the right to set boundaries so that you’re
exposed to only the level of potential risk you’re
comfortable with, whether you’re more willing to
take risks or more risk averse. This includes being
able to manage the online experience of minors
in your care.
•
You have the right to know if you’re being moni-
tored online and how you’re being monitored —
such as which of your activities is being tracked
and to whom it’s reported, whether it’s to compa-
nies or other individuals. Your children have this
right, too.
➟You have the right to expect online products and
services to guard your safety.
•
You have the right to feel confident that products
and services won’t be released to the public with-
out undergoing rigorous safety, privacy, and legal
reviews and testing.
•
You have the right to know the privacy and safety
policies of online products and services. (See
Figure 16-4.) These should be easy to find and
written in terms that are easy to understand.
➟
338
Part IV: Being Proactive

•
You have the right to easily report abuse of the
products or abuse through the products of you or
a loved one. You also have the right to know how
well the company enforces its policies and to
expect immediate action from the company if a
problem arises.
•
You have the right to expect the equivalent of a
product recall notice if a significant safety risk is
discovered in an online product or service.
Figure 16-4
As a consumer, you can — and should — vote with
your feet if the experience you’re having on a service
doesn’t meet your expectations. You can make a differ-
ence. Your safety rights won’t be established in
Internet programs and services overnight. But if you
let companies know what you think, they’ll surely be
delivered faster.

Demand More from Online Companies
Just as not every person is trustworthy, not every company is worthy of
your trust in equal measure. This is why it’s important to choose which
information we provide to various businesses in the brick-and-mortar
world. What information you provide to a grocery store clerk differs
from the information you share with your bank manager. This ability to
select what companies know about you is at least as necessary online.
However, in addition to taking the time to identify reputable online
companies that will respect your information, we aren’t hearing enough
about the responsibility of companies to build safer products. Our
background is in the Internet industry. We love technology. But the
industry as a whole hasn’t taken enough steps to design or provide a
safer consumer experience.
➟In most cases companies simply provide people with
access to products and urge them to have fun. These
products hurtle consumers through cyberspace at
warp speed but don’t provide the equivalent of a
user’s manual, let alone a driver’s education.
➟Most online services fail to build basic safety meas-
ures equivalent to the brakes, locks, or airbags that are
built into your car, and even fewer adequately test
their products for safety.
➟Companies provide terms of use and codes of con-
duct on their sites, but most fail to take the responsi-
bility to enforce their policies and ensure reasonable
safety for users on their sites. In their own online envi-
ronments, service providers must be the first line of
safety and enforcement.
➟Companies have a responsibility to inform consumers
about changes to their products that have an impact
on safety. Many adult IM users are surprised to dis-
cover that IM has steadily upgraded far beyond the
real-time e-mail service they thought they knew.
➟
340
Part IV: Being Proactive

➟As companies rush to add great new features, such as
rich profiles, avatars, extended networking (friends of
friends), video and music players, bots, gadgets, buddy
searches, and shopping and location tools, they cut
corners on hardening the products against a variety of
online crimes and abuse, leaving consumers at risk.
➟In the race to be first with a new feature, or to catch
up with a competitor, tradeoffs are required. All too
often, the first features cut and the last features reluc-
tantly added are safety related, such as filters for
images and text, safety information within products,
the ability to turn off or restrict access to high-risk fea-
tures, as well as tools that specifically help users man-
age their exposure, and tools to help companies track
abuse behind the scenes on their services.
Service providers will continue to innovate, and this is good news for
everyone. However, consumers have the right to be informed about
each new feature that affects their exposure to risk, and we should be
able to determine whether the risk potential is appropriate for us and
our families. Automatic upgrades without safety messaging bears a
strong resemblance to the old bait-and-switch tactics when consumers
aren’t given the right to choose. The Internet industry has for years pro-
moted self-regulation of online tools and services, but it’s consistently
failed to deliver adequate safeguards for consumers.
Use your common sense when dealing with online
services. Most Internet services and products are busi-
nesses. They’re for-profit organizations, not philan-
thropic endeavors. Building safety into products costs
money, may slow development, and probably restricts
the number of users (like restricting users under a cer-
tain age, or filtering content prior to exposing it on
the site) which in turn reduces their revenue.
It’s important to remember that many free sites aren’t
free; the companies might make their money by sell-
ing advertisers access to their users, so more users
➟
341
Chapter 16: Knowing Your Rights and Making a Difference

equals more money. It isn’t usually in a company’s
financial interest to restrict access even to those users
with a history of bad behavior, as it restricts ad rev-
enue. Nor is it in the immediate best interest of the
companies to build safety tools unless consumers or
regulations demand it.
The great news is that you have tremendous power in this financial
model. When companies make money by having lots of users, they lose
money when users leave their sites — and they become very concerned
and responsive if users threaten to leave their sites because of poor poli-
cies, lack of safety, and so on. If you and others act, you can make a
tremendous difference.
Hold the Government Accountable for Your Privacy
Some safety precautions, such as crossing the street safely or locking
your house when you go out, are your responsibility.
Other safety measures aren’t. We don’t ask consumers to build public
roads, ensure that the roads meet quality standards, or require con-
sumers to enforce speed limits. In the same way, we can’t place the full
burden of online safety on consumers. 
These three key responsibilities lie firmly in the domain of government:
➟Establishing minimum safety standards for compa-
nies and their products and services so that con-
sumers can use technology without fear of harm.
➟Monitoring companies’ compliance with established
safety standards and penalizing companies that fail to
meet them.
➟Enforcing the law. Fighting criminals isn’t a job for
ordinary citizens; it leads to fear and vigilantism (as
we’ve seen in the vigilante efforts of ordinary citizens
to trap predators online).
➟

Part IV: Being Proactive

There are several areas where current government response is lacking
and where you need to demand improvement.
➟Society has tasked government with ensuring the dis-
semination of public safety messages such as the
health warnings on cigarette packaging. Regrettably,
holistic Internet safety messaging is still lacking — and
much of the current Internet safety messaging fails to
provide useful, actionable information. Safety messag-
ing must explain both potential risks and how to eval-
uate risks so that you can determine your own comfort
level.
➟Governments and courts need to set age boundaries,
establish the dividing line between legal and illegal
content, and between safe and unsafe product quality.
It should support these laws by
•
Creating and enforcing minimum safety standards 
to restore consumer confidence in online tools and 
services.
•
Passing legislation that enables law enforcement to
arrest criminals and get convictions for crimes that
aren’t covered by existing laws.
•
Making funds available for equipment, training,
and additional officers. Mandates without funding
aren’t priorities; they’re merely political lip service.
Let your elected officials know that you demand regulations that
require consumer protection in online services and products and the
development of laws that will allow law enforcement to arrest and
prosecute online criminals.
If you have grandchildren you should know that a
Texas judge’s ruling determined that parents own the
primary responsibility for protecting minors online, as
➟
343
Chapter 16: Knowing Your Rights and Making a Difference

he dismissed a lawsuit filed by the parents of a young
teen girl against MySpace. According to the Los
Angeles Times, Judge Sparks’ specific comment was “If
anyone had a duty to protect Julie Doe, it was her par-
ents, not MySpace.”
This statement is on par with claiming that parents are primarily
responsible for traffic deaths of their teens. If someone hands a 14-year-
old keys to a faulty car and says “go have fun” down a poorly main-
tained freeway that doesn’t warn of steep curves, would society blame
the parents for the ensuing crash?
What Law Enforcement and Government 
Agencies Must Do
Law enforcement has primary responsibility to monitor society’s safety,
prevent crime, and bring to justice those who break the law. Yet, this is
a tall order when adequate laws and regulations are missing to facilitate
enforcement, adequate safety features weren’t built into the products to
minimize the potential for exploitation, and even so-called public sites
are owned and run by companies, not society. Crime has always
enjoyed better funding than law enforcement, but without assurances
of basic safety, the public can’t fully realize the tremendous opportuni-
ties the Internet has to offer.
No government’s intent has ever been to abet criminals or expose con-
sumers to crime. Unfortunately, intent doesn’t deter crime; actions do.
Law enforcement and government agencies must work hand in hand to
➟Clearly indicate in government-sponsored public mes-
saging the government role in exposing consumers 
to risk.
➟Thoroughly evaluate and justify all information they
make public about individuals.
➟
344
Part IV: Being Proactive

➟Do a comprehensive review of the implications of the
existing practices around the Freedom of Information
Act. (See Figure 16-5.) Changes must swiftly be made
to protect individuals while safeguarding the public’s
right to know about government actions, policies, and
so on.
Figure 16-5
➟Establish a timeframe to require all government agen-
cies to remove sensitive information about individuals.
➟Find the funding to educate law enforcement staff
and empower them to enforce laws and regulations.
Something you can do is to watch for news about pro-
posed and pending Internet safety, privacy, and policy
legislation and speak out. Contact your local, state,
and national representatives, and let them know that
this matter is important to you.
