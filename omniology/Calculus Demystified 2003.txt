PREFACE
Calculus is one of the milestones of Western thought. Building on ideas of
Archimedes, Fermat, Newton, Leibniz, Cauchy, and many others, the calculus is
arguably the cornerstone of modern science. Any well-educated person should
at least be acquainted with the ideas of calculus, and a scientiﬁcally literate person
must know calculus solidly.
Calculus has two main aspects: differential calculus and integral calculus.
Differential calculus concerns itself with rates of change. Various types of change,
both mathematical and physical, are described by a mathematical quantity called
the derivative. Integral calculus is concerned with a generalized type of addition,
or amalgamation, of quantities. Many kinds of summation, both mathematical and
physical, are described by a mathematical quantity called the integral.
What makes the subject of calculus truly powerful and seminal is the Funda-
mental Theorem of Calculus, which shows how an integral may be calculated by
using the theory of the derivative. The Fundamental Theorem enables a number
of important conceptual breakthroughs and calculational techniques. It makes the
subject of differential equations possible (in the sense that it gives us ways to solve
these equations).
Calculus Demystiﬁed explains this panorama of ideas in a step-by-step and acces-
sible manner. The author, a renowned teacher and expositor, has a strong sense of
the level of the students who will read this book, their backgrounds and their
strengths, and can present the material in accessible morsels that the student can
study on his own. Well-chosen examples and cognate exercises will reinforce the
ideas being presented. Frequent review, assessment, and application of the ideas
will help students to retain and to internalize all the important concepts of calculus.
We envision a book that will give the student a ﬁrm grounding in calculus.
The student who has mastered this book will be able to go on to study physics,
engineering, chemistry, computational biology, computer science, and other basic
scientiﬁc areas that use calculus.
Calculus Demystiﬁed will be a valuable addition to the self-help literature.
Written by an accomplished and experienced teacher (the author of How to Teach
Mathematics), this book will aid the student who is working without a teacher.

It will provide encouragement and reinforcement as needed, and diagnostic exer-
cises will help the student to measure his or her progress. A comprehensive exam
at the end of the book will help the student to assess his mastery of the subject, and
will point to areas that require further work.
We expect this book to be the cornerstone of a series of elementary mathematics
books of the same tenor and utility.

CHAPTER 1
Basics
1.0
Introductory Remarks
Calculus is one of the most important parts of mathematics. It is fundamental to all
of modern science. How could one part of mathematics be of such central impor-
tance? It is because calculus gives us the tools to study rates of change and motion.
All analytical subjects, from biology to physics to chemistry to engineering to math-
ematics, involve studying quantities that are growing or shrinking or moving—in
other words, they are changing. Astronomers study the motions of the planets,
chemists study the interaction of substances, physicists study the interactions of
physical objects. All of these involve change and motion.
In order to study calculus effectively, you must be familiar with cartesian geome-
try, with trigonometry, and with functions.We will spend this ﬁrst chapter reviewing
the essential ideas. Some readers will study this chapter selectively, merely review-
ing selected sections. Others will, for completeness, wish to review all the material.
The main point is to get started on calculus (Chapter 2).
1.1
Number Systems
The number systems that we use in calculus are the natural numbers, the integers,
the rational numbers, and the real numbers. Let us describe each of these:
•
The natural numbers are the system of positive counting numbers 1, 2, 3, ….
We denote the set of all natural numbers by N.

CHAPTER 1
Basics
2
•
The integers are the positive and negative whole numbers and zero:
. . . , −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . . We denote the set of all integers by Z.
•
The rational numbers are quotients of integers.Any number of the form p/q,
with p, q ∈Z and q ̸= 0, is a rational number. We say that p/q and r/s
represent the same rational number precisely when ps = qr. Of course you
know that in displayed mathematics we write fractions in this way:
1
2 + 2
3 = 7
6.
•
The real numbers are the set of all decimals, both terminating and non-
terminating. This set is rather sophisticated, and bears a little discussion. A
decimal number of the form
x = 3.16792
is actually a rational number, for it represents
x = 3.16792 = 316792
100000.
A decimal number of the form
m = 4.27519191919 . . . ,
withagroupofdigitsthatrepeatsitselfinterminably,isalsoarationalnumber.
To see this, notice that
100 · m = 427.519191919 . . .
and therefore we may subtract:
100m = 427.519191919 . . .
m =
4.275191919 . . .
Subtracting, we see that
99m = 423.244
or
m = 423244
99000 .
So, as we asserted, m is a rational number or quotient of integers.
The third kind of decimal number is one which has a non-terminating dec-
imal expansion that does not keep repeating. An example is 3.14159265 . . . .
This is the decimal expansion for the number that we ordinarily call π. Such
a number is irrational, that is, it cannot be expressed as the quotient of two
integers.

CHAPTER 1
Basics
3
In summary: There are three types of real numbers: (i) terminating decimals,
(ii) non-terminating decimals that repeat, (iii) non-terminating decimals that do not
repeat. Types (i) and (ii) are rational numbers. Type (iii) are irrational numbers.
You Try It:
What type of real number is 3.41287548754875 . . . ? Can you express
this number in more compact form?
1.2
Coordinates in One Dimension
We envision the real numbers as laid out on a line, and we locate real numbers from
left to right on this line. If a < b are real numbers then a will lie to the left of b on
this line. See Fig. 1.1.

On a real number line, plot the numbers −4, −1, 2, 6. Also plot the sets
S = {x ∈R: −8 ≤x < −5} and T = {t ∈R: 7 < t ≤9}. Label the plots.
SOLUTION
Figure 1.2 exhibits the indicated points and the two sets. These sets are called
half-open intervals because each set includes one endpoint and not the other.

Math Note:
The notation S = {x ∈R: −8 ≤x < −5} is called set builder
notation. It says that S is the set of all numbers x such that x is greater than or equal
to −8 and less than 5. We will use set builder notation throughout the book.
If an interval contains both its endpoints, then it is called a closed interval. If an
interval omits both its endpoints, then it is called an open interval. See Fig. 1.3.

EXAMPLE 1.3
Find the set of points that satisfy the condition
|x + 3| ≤2
(*)
and exhibit it on a number line.
SOLUTION
In case x + 3 ≥0 then |x + 3| = x + 3 and we may write condition (∗) as
x + 3 ≤2
or
x ≤−1.
Combining x + 3 ≥0 and x ≤−1 gives −3 ≤x ≤−1.
On the other hand, if x +3 < 0 then |x +3| = −(x +3). We may then write
condition (∗) as
−(x + 3) ≤2
or
−5 ≤x.
Combining x + 3 < 0 and −5 ≤x gives −5 ≤x < −3.
We have found that our inequality |x + 3| ≤2 is true precisely when either
−3 ≤x ≤−1 or −5 ≤x < −3. Putting these together yields −5 ≤x ≤−1.
We display this set in Fig. 1.5.

1.3
Coordinates in Two Dimensions
We locate points in the plane by using two coordinate lines (instead of the single
line that we used in one dimension). Refer to Fig. 1.6. We determine the coordinates
of the given point P by ﬁrst determining the x-displacement, or (signed) distance
from the y-axis and then determining the y-displacement, or (signed) distance from
the x-axis. We refer to this coordinate system as (x, y)-coordinates or Cartesian
coordinates. The idea is best understood by way of some examples.

Fig. 1.6
EXAMPLE 1.4
Plot the points P = (3, −2), Q = (−4, 6), R = (2, 5), S = (−5, −3).
SOLUTION
The ﬁrst coordinate 3 of the point P tells us that the point is located 3 units
to the right of the y-axis (because 3 is positive). The second coordinate −2 of
the point P tells us that the point is located 2 units below the x-axis (because
−2 is negative). See Fig. 1.7.
The ﬁrst coordinate −4 of the point Q tells us that the point is located 4 units
to the left of the y-axis (because −4 is negative). The second coordinate 6 of
the point Q tells us that the point is located 6 units above the x-axis (because
6 is positive). See Fig. 1.7.
The ﬁrst coordinate 2 of the point R tells us that the point is located 2 units
to the right of the y-axis (because 2 is positive). The second coordinate 5 of the
point R tells us that the point is located 5 units above the x-axis (because 5 is
positive). See Fig. 1.7.
The ﬁrst coordinate −5 of the point S tells us that the point is located 5 units
to the left of the y-axis (because −5 is negative). The second coordinate −3 of
the point S tells us that the point is located 3 units below the x-axis (because
−3 is negative). See Fig. 1.7.

SOLUTION
The point X is 1 unit to the right of the y-axis and 3 units below the x-axis.
Therefore its coordinates are (1, −3).
The point Y is 2 units to the left of the y-axis and 1 unit above the x-axis.
Therefore its coordinates are (−2, 1).

CHAPTER 1

7
The point Z is 5 units to the right of the y-axis and 4 units above the x-axis.
Therefore its coordinates are (5, 4).
The point W is 6 units to the left of the y-axis and 5 units below the x-axis.
Therefore its coordinates are (−6, −5).
You Try It:
Sketch the points (3, −5), (2, 4), (π, π/3) on a set of axes. Sketch
the set {(x, y): x = 3} on another set of axes.
EXAMPLE 1.6
Sketch the set of points ℓ= {(x, y): y = 3}. Sketch the set of points k =
{(x, y): x = −4}.
SOLUTION
The set ℓconsists of all points with y-coordinate equal to 3. This is the set
of all points that lie 3 units above the x-axis. We exhibit ℓin Fig. 1.9. It is a
horizontal line.

Fig. 1.9
The set k consists of all points with x-coordinate equal to −4. This is the set
of all points that lie 4 units to the left of the y-axis. We exhibit k in Fig. 1.10.
It is a vertical line.
EXAMPLE 1.7
Sketch the set of points S = {(x, y): x > 2} on a pair of coordinate axes.
SOLUTION
Notice that the set S contains all points with x-coordinate greater than 2.
These will be all points to the right of the vertical line x = 2. That set is
exhibited in Fig. 1.11.
You Try It:
Sketch the set {(x, y): x + y < 4}.

Identify the set (using set builder notation) that is shown in Fig. 1.12.

The Slope of a Line in the Plane
A line in the plane may rise gradually from left to right, or it may rise quite steeply
from left to right (Fig. 1.13). Likewise, it could fall gradually from left to right,
or it could fall quite steeply from left to right (Fig. 1.14). The number “slope”
differentiates among these different rates of rise or fall.
Look at Fig. 1.15. We use the two points P = (p1, p2) and Q = (q1, q2) to
calculate the slope. It is
m = q2 −p2
q1 −p1
.

It turns out that, no matter which two points we may choose on a given line, this
calculation will always give the same answer for slope.
EXAMPLE 1.8
Calculate the slope of the line in Fig. 1.16.
SOLUTION
We use the points P = (−1, 0) and Q = (1, 3) to calculate the slope of
this line:
m =

1 −(−1) = 3

We could just as easily have used the points P = (−1, 0) and R = (3, 6) to
calculate the slope:
m =

3 −(−1) = 6
4 = 3
2.
If a line has slope m, then, for each unit of motion from left to right, the line
rises m units. In the last example, the line rises 3/2 units for each unit of motion to
the right. Or one could say that the line rises 3 units for each 2 units of motion to
the right.

EXAMPLE 1.9
Calculate the slope of the line in Fig. 1.17.
SOLUTION
We use the points R = (−2, 10) and T = (1, −5) to calculate the slope of
this line:
m = 10 −(−5)
(−2) −1 = −5.

CHAPTER 1
Basics
12
We could just as easily have used the points S = (−1, 5) and T = (1, −5):
m = 5 −(−5)
−1 −1 = −5.
In this example, the line falls 5 units for each 1 unit of left-to-right motion. The
negativity of the slope indicates that the line is falling.
The concept of slope is undeﬁned for a vertical line. Such a line will have any
two points with the same x-coordinate, and calculation of slope would result in
division by 0.
You Try It:
What is the slope of the line y = 2x + 8?
You Try It:
What is the slope of the line y = 5? What is the slope of the line
x = 3?
Two lines are perpendicular precisely when their slopes are negative reciprocals.
This makes sense: If one line has slope 5 and the other has slope −1/5 then we
see that the ﬁrst line rises 5 units for each unit of left-to-right motion while the
second line falls 1 unit for each 5 units of left-to-right motion. So the lines must be
perpendicular. See Fig. 1.18(a).

The equation of a line in the plane will describe—in compact form—all the points
that lie on that line. We determine the equation of a given line by writing its
slope in two different ways and then equating them. Some examples best illustrate
the idea.
EXAMPLE 1.10
Determine the equation of the line with slope 3 that passes through the point
(2, 1).
SOLUTION
Let (x, y) be a variable point on the line. Then we can use that variable point
together with (2, 1) to calculate the slope:
m = y −1
x −2.
On the other hand, we are given that the slope is m = 3. We may equate the
two expressions for slope to obtain
3 = y −1
x −2.
(∗)
This may be simpliﬁed to y = 3x −5.
Math Note:
The form y = 3x −5 for the equation of a line is called the slope-
intercept form. The slope is 3 and the line passes through (0, 5) (its y-intercept).
Math Note:
Equation (∗) may be rewritten as y −1 = 3(x −2). In general, the
line with slope m that passes through the point (x0, y0) can be written as y −y0 =
m(x −x0). This is called the point-slope form of the equation of a line.

CHAPTER 1

You Try It:
Write the equation of the line that passes through the point (−3, 2)
and has slope 4.
EXAMPLE 1.11
Write the equation of the line passing through the points (−4, 5) and (6, 2).
SOLUTION
Let (x, y) be a variable point on the line. Using the points (x, y) and (−4, 5),
we may calculate the slope to be
m =
y −5
x −(−4).
On the other hand, we may use the points (−4, 5) and (6, 2) to calculate the
slope:
m =
2 −5
6 −(−4) = −3
10 .
Equating the two expressions for slope, we ﬁnd that
y −5
x + 4 = −3
10 .
Simplifying this identity, we ﬁnd that the equation of our line is
y −5 = −3
10 · (x + 4).
You Try It:
Find the equation of the line that passes through the points (2, −5)
and (−6, 1).
In general, the line that passes through points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) has equation
y −y0
x −x0
= y1 −y0
x1 −x0
.
This is called the two-point form of the equation of a line.
EXAMPLE 1.12
Find the line perpendicular to y = 3x −6 that passes through the point
(5, 4).
SOLUTION
We know from the Math Note immediately after Example 1.10 that the given
line has slope 3. Thus the line we seek (the perpendicular line) has slope −1/3.
Using the point-slope form of a line, we may immediately write the equation
of the line with slope −1/3 and passing through (5, 4) as
y −4 = −1
3 · (x −5).

CHAPTER 1
Basics
15
Summary:
We determine the equation of a line in the plane by ﬁnding two
expressions for the slope and equating them.
If a line has slope m and passes through the point (x0, y0) then it has equation
y −y0 = m(x −x0).
This is the point-slope form of a line.
If a line passes through the points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) then it has equation
y −y0
x −x0
= y1 −y0
x1 −x0
.
This is the two-point form of a line.
You Try It:
Find the line perpendicular to 2x + 5y = 10 that passes through
the point (1, 1). Now ﬁnd the line that is parallel to the given line and passes
through (1, 1).
1.6
Loci in the Plane
The most interesting sets of points to graph are collections of points that are deﬁned
by an equation. We call such a graph the locus of the equation. We cannot give all
the theory of loci here, but instead consider a few examples. See [SCH2] for more
on this matter.

We plot these points on a single set of axes (Fig. 1.19). Supposing that the

in Fig. 1.20. This curve is called a parabola.

Trigonometry
Here we give a whirlwind review of basic ideas of trigonometry. The reader who
needs a more extensive review should consult [SCH1].
When we ﬁrst learn trigonometry, we do so by studying right triangles and
measuringanglesindegrees.LookatFig.1.25.Incalculus,however,itisconvenient
to study trigonometry in a more general setting, and to measure angles in radians.

 measured in degrees
Fig. 1.25
Angles will be measured by rotation along the unit circle in the plane, beginning
at the positive x-axis. See Fig. 1.26. Counterclockwise rotation corresponds to
positive angles, and clockwise rotation corresponds to negative angles. Refer to
Fig. 1.27. The radian measure of an angle is deﬁned to be the length of the arc
of the unit circle that the angle subtends with the positive x-axis (together with an
appropriate + or −sign).

In degree measure, one full rotation about the unit circle is 360◦; in radian
measure, one full rotation about the circle is just the circumference of the circle or
2π. Let us use the symbol θ to denote an angle. The principle of proportionality
now tells us that
degree measure of θ
360◦
= radian measure of θ
2π
.
In other words
radian measure of θ = π
180 · (degree measure of θ)
and
degree measure of θ = 180

· (radian measure of θ).

EXAMPLE 1.16

measure.
SOLUTION
Since
π/6
2π = 1
12,
the angle subtends an arc of the unit circle corresponding to 1/12 of the full cir-
cumference. Since π/6 > 0, the angle represents a counterclockwise rotation.
It is illustrated in Fig. 1.28.

6 = 30◦.
Math Note:
In this book we always use radian measure for angles. (The reason
is that it makes the formulas of calculus turn out to be simpler.) Thus, for example,
if we refer to “the angle 2π/3” then it should be understood that this is an angle in
radian measure. See Fig. 1.29.
Likewise, if we refer to the angle 3 it is also understood to be radian measure.
We sketch this last angle by noting that 3 is approximately 0.477 of a full rotation
2π—refer to Fig. 1.30.
You Try It:
Sketch the angles −2, 1, π, 3π/2, 10—all on the same coordinate

Several angles are sketched in Fig. 1.31, and both their radian and degree
measures given.
If θ is an angle, let (x, y) be the coordinates of the terminal point of the corre-
sponding radius (called the terminal radius) on the unit circle. We call P = (x, y)
the terminal point corresponding to θ. Look at Fig. 1.32. The number y is called the
sine of θ and is written sin θ. The number x is called the cosine of θ and is written
cos θ.
Since (cos θ, sin θ) are coordinates of a point on the unit circle, the following
two fundamental properties are immediate:
(1)
For any number θ,
(sin θ)2 + (cos θ)2 = 1.

Math Note:
Notice that if θ is an angle then θ and θ +2π have the same terminal
radius and the same terminal point (for adding 2π just adds one more trip around
the circle—look at Fig. 1.34).
As a result,
sin θ = x = sin(θ + 2π)

and
cos θ = y = cos(θ + 2π).
We say that the sine and cosine functions have period 2π: the functions repeat
themselves every 2π units.
In practice, when we calculate the trigonometric functions of an angle θ, we
reduce it by multiples of 2π so that we can consider an equivalent angle θ′, called
the associated principal angle, satisfying 0 ≤θ′ < 2π. For instance,
15π/2
has associated principal angle
3π/2
(since 15π/2 −3π/2 = 3 · 2π)
and
−10π/3
has associated principal angle
2π/3
(since −10π/3 −2π/3 = −12π/3 = −2 · 2π).
You Try It:
What are the principal angles associated with 7π, 11π/2, 8π/3,
−14π/5, −16π/7?
What does the concept of angle and sine and cosine that we have presented here
have to do with the classical notion using triangles? Notice that any angle θ such
that 0 ≤θ < π/2 has associated to it a right triangle in the ﬁrst quadrant, with
vertex on the unit circle, such that the base is the segment connecting (0, 0) to (x, 0)
and the height is the segment connecting (x, 0) to (x, y). See Fig. 1.35.

Then
sin θ = y = y
1 = opposite side of triangle

and
cos θ = x = x
1 = adjacent side of triangle

.
Thus, for angles θ between 0 and π/2, the new deﬁnition of sine and cosine using
the unit circle is clearly equivalent to the classical deﬁnition using adjacent and
opposite sides and the hypotenuse. For other angles θ, the classical approach is to
reduce to this special case by subtracting multiples of π/2. Our approach using the
unit circle is considerably clearer because it makes the signatures of sine and cosine
obvious.
Besides sine and cosine, there are four other trigonometric functions:
tan θ = y
x = sin θ
cos θ
cot θ = x
y = cos θ
sin θ
sec θ = 1
x =
1
cos θ
csc θ = 1
y =

sin θ .
Whereas sine and cosine have domain the entire real line, we notice that tan θ and
sec θ are undeﬁned at odd multiples of π/2 (because cosine will vanish there) and
cot θ and csc θ are undeﬁned at even multiples of π/2 (because sine will vanish
there). The graphs of the six trigonometric functions are shown in Fig. 1.36.

Compute all the trigonometric functions for the angle θ = 11π/4.

We ﬁrst notice that the principal associated angle is 3π/4, so we deal with
that angle. Figure 1.37 shows that the triangle associated to this angle is an
isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse 1.

1.8
Sets and Functions
We have seen sets and functions throughout this review chapter, but it is well to
bring out some of the ideas explicitly.
A set is a collection of objects. We denote a set with a capital roman letter, such
as S or T or U. If S is a set and s is an object in that set then we write s ∈S and
we say that s is an element of S. If S and T are sets then the collection of elements
common to the two sets is called the intersection of S and T and is written S ∩T .
The set of elements that are in S or in T or in both is called the union of S and T
and is written S ∪T .
A function from a set S to a set T is a rule that assigns to each element of S a
unique element of T . We write f : S →T .
EXAMPLE 1.21
Let S be the set of all people who are alive at noon on October 10, 2004
and T the set of all real numbers. Let f be the rule that assigns to each
person his or her weight in pounds at precisely noon on October 10, 2004.
Discuss whether f : S →T is a function.
SOLUTION
Indeed f is a function since it assigns to each element of S a unique element
of T . Notice that each person has just one weight at noon on October 10, 2004:
that is a part of the deﬁnition of “function.” However two different people may
have the same weight—that is allowed.

CHAPTER 1
Basics
31
EXAMPLE 1.22
Let S be the set of all people and T be the set of all people. Let f be the
rule that assigns to each person his or her brother. Is f a function?
SOLUTION
In this case f is not a function. For many people have no brother (so the rule
makes no sense for them) and many people have several brothers (so the rule
is ambiguous for them).
EXAMPLE 1.23
Let S be the set of all people and T be the set of all strings of letters not
exceeding 1500 characters (including blank spaces). Let f be the rule that
assigns to each person his or her legal name. (Some people have rather
long names; according to the Guinness Book of World Records, the longest
has 1063 letters.) Determine whether f : S →T is a function.
SOLUTION
This f is a function because every person has one and only one legal name.
Notice that several people may have the same name (such as “JackArmstrong”),
but that is allowed in the deﬁnition of function.
You Try It:
Let f be the rule that assigns to each real number its cube root. Is this
a function?
In calculus, the set S (called the domain of the function) and the set T (called
the range of the function) will usually be sets of numbers; in fact they will often
consist of one or more intervals in R. The rule f will usually be given by one or
several formulas. Many times the domain and range will not be given explicitly.
These ideas will be illustrated in the examples below.
You Try It:
Consider the rule that assigns to each real number its absolute value.
Is this a function? Why or why not? If it is a function, then what are its domain and
range?
1.8.1
EXAMPLES OF FUNCTIONS OF A REAL
VARIABLE
EXAMPLE 1.24
Let S = R, T = R, and let f (x) = x2. This is mathematical shorthand for
the rule “assign to each x ∈S its square.” Determine whether f : R →R
is a function.
SOLUTION
We see that f is a function since it assigns to each element of S a unique
element of T —namely its square.

CHAPTER 1
Basics
32
Math Note:
Notice that, in the deﬁnition of function, there is some imprecision
in the deﬁnition of T . For instance, in Example 1.24, we could have let T = [0, ∞)
or T = (−6, ∞) with no signiﬁcant change in the function. In the example of the
“name” function (Example 1.23), we could have let T be all strings of letters not
exceeding 5000 characters in length. Or we could have made it all strings without
regard to length. Likewise, in any of the examples we could make the set S smaller
and the function would still make sense.
It is frequently convenient not to describe S and T explicitly.
EXAMPLE 1.25
Let f (x) = +
√
1 −x2 . Determine a domain and range for f which make
f a function.
SOLUTION
Notice that f makes sense for x ∈[−1, 1] (we may not take the square root
of a negative number, so we cannot allow x > 1 or x < −1). If we understand
f to have domain [−1, 1] and range R, then f : [−1, 1] →R is a function.
Math Note:
When a function is given by a formula, as in Example 1.25, with no
statement about the domain, then the domain is understood to be the set of all x for
which the formula makes sense.
You Try It:
Let
g(x) =
x
x2 + 4x + 3.
What are the domain and range of this function?
EXAMPLE 1.26
Let
f (x) =

−3
if x ≤1
2x2
if x > 1
Determine whether f is a function.
SOLUTION
Notice that f unambiguously assigns to each real number another real num-
ber. The rule is given in two pieces, but it is still a valid rule. Therefore it is
a function with domain equal to R and range equal to R. It is also perfectly
correct to take the range to be (−4, ∞), for example, since f only takes values
in this set.
Math Note:
One point that you should learn from this example is that a function
may be speciﬁed by different formulas on different parts of the domain.

CHAPTER 1

33
You Try It:
Does the expression

if x ≥2
deﬁne a function? Why or why not?
EXAMPLE 1.27
Let f (x) = ±√x. Discuss whether f is a function.
SOLUTION
This f can only make sense for x ≥0. But even then f is not a function
since it is ambiguous. For instance, it assigns to x = 1 both the numbers 1
and −1.
1.8.2
GRAPHS OF FUNCTIONS
It is useful to be able to draw pictures which represent functions. These pictures,
or graphs, are a device for helping us to think about functions. In this book we will
only graph functions whose domains and ranges are subsets of the real numbers.
We graph functions in the x-y plane. The elements of the domain of a function
are thought of as points of the x-axis. The values of a function are measured on the
y-axis. The graph of f associates to x the unique y value that the function f assigns
to x. In other words, a point (x, y) lies on the graph of f if and only if y = f (x).
EXAMPLE 1.28
Let f (x) = (x2 + 2)/(x −1). Determine whether there are points of the
graph of f corresponding to x = 3, 4, and 1.
SOLUTION
The y value corresponding to x = 3 is y = f (3) = 11/2. Therefore the
point (3, 11/2) lies on the graph of f . Similarly, f (4) = 6 so that (4, 6) lies on
the graph. However, f is undeﬁned at x = 1, so there is no point on the graph
with x coordinate 1. The sketch in Fig. 1.38 was obtained by plotting several
points.
Math Note:
Notice that for each x in the domain of the function there is one and
only one point on the graph—namely the unique point with y value equal to f (x).
If x is not in the domain of f , then there is no point on the graph that corresponds
to x.

SOLUTION
Observe that, corresponding to x = 3, for instance, there are two y values
on the curve. Therefore the curve cannot be the graph of a function.

Graph the function y = x + |x|.
EXAMPLE 1.30
Is the curve in Fig. 1.40 the graph of a function?

CHAPTER 1
Basics
35
Fig. 1.40
SOLUTION
Notice that each x in the domain has just one y value corresponding to it.
Thus, even though we cannot give a formula for the function, the curve is the
graph of a function. The domain of this function is (−∞, 3) ∪(5, 7).
Math Note:
A nice, geometrical way to think about the condition that each x in
the domain has corresponding to it precisely one y value is this:
If every vertical line drawn through a curve intersects that curve just once,
then the curve is the graph of a function.
You Try It:
Use the vertical line test to determine whether the locus x2 + y2 = 1
is the graph of a function.
1.8.3
PLOTTING THE GRAPH OF A FUNCTION
Until we learn some more sophisticated techniques, the basic method that we shall
use for graphing functions is to plot points and then to connect them in a plausible
manner.
EXAMPLE 1.31
Sketch the graph of f (x) = x3 −x.

We plot these points on a pair of axes and connect them in a reasonable way
(Fig. 1.41). Notice that the domain of f is all of R, so we extend the graph to
the edges of the picture.
EXAMPLE 1.32

We plot these on a pair of axes (Fig. 1.42).
Since the deﬁnition of the function changes at x = 2, we would be mistaken
to connect these dots blindly. First notice that, for x ≤2, the function is
identically constant. Its graph is a horizontal line. For x > 2, the function is a
line of slope 1. Now we can sketch the graph accurately (Fig. 1.43).

Sketch the graph of h(x) = |x| ·

We begin by noticing that the domain of f , that is the values of x for which
the function makes sense, is {x: x ≥−1}. The square root is understood to
be the positive square root. Now we compute a table of values and plot some
points.

COMPOSITION OF FUNCTIONS
Suppose that f and g are functions and that the domain of g contains the range of f .
This means that if x is in the domain of f then f (x) makes sense but also g may
be applied to f (x) (Fig. 1.46). The result of these two operations, one following
the other, is called g composed with f or the composition of g with f . We write
(g ◦f )(x) = g(f (x)).
x
f (x)
g( f (x))
Fig. 1.46
EXAMPLE 1.35
Let f (x) = x2 −1 and g(x) = 3x + 4. Calculate g ◦f .
SOLUTION
We have
(g ◦f )(x) = g(f (x)) = g(x2 −1).
(∗)
Notice that we have started to work inside the parentheses: the ﬁrst step was
to substitute the deﬁnition of f , namely x2 −1, into our equation.
Now the deﬁnition of g says that we take g of any argument by multiplying
that argument by 3 and then adding 4. In the present case we are applying g to
x2 −1. Therefore the right side of equation (∗) equals
3 · (x2 −1) + 4.
This easily simpliﬁes to 3x2 + 1. In conclusion,
g ◦f (x) = 3x2 + 1.
EXAMPLE 1.36
Let f (t) = (t2 −2 )/(t + 1 ) and g(t) = 2t + 1. Calculate g ◦f and f ◦g.
SOLUTION
We calculate that
(g ◦f )(t) = g(f (t)) = g

t2 −2

= 2t2 −4
t + 1 + 1

.
One of the main points of this example is to see that f ◦g is different from
g ◦f . We compute f ◦g:
(f ◦g)(t) = f (g(t))
= f (2t + 1)
= (2t + 1)2 −2
(2t + 1) + 1
= 4t2 + 4t −1
2t + 2
.
So f ◦g and g ◦f are different functions.
You Try It:
Let f (x) = |x| and g(x) = √x/x. Calculate f ◦g(x) and g ◦f (x).
We say a few words about recognizing compositions of functions.
EXAMPLE 1.37
How can we write the function k(x) = (2x + 3)2 as the composition of two
functions g and f ?
SOLUTION
Notice that the function k can be thought of as two operations applied in
sequence. First we double and add three, then we square. Thus deﬁne f (x) =
2x + 3 and g(x) = x2. Then k(x) = (g ◦f )(x).
We can also compose three (or more) functions: Deﬁne
(h ◦g ◦f )(x) = h(g(f (x))).
EXAMPLE 1.38
Write the function k from the last example as the composition of three
functions (instead of just two).

CHAPTER 1
Basics
42
SOLUTION
First we double, then we add 3, then we square. So let f (x) = 2x, g(x) =
x + 3, h(x) = x2. Then k(x) = (h ◦g ◦f )(x).
EXAMPLE 1.39

SOLUTION
Firstwesquaret andadd3,thenwedivide2bythequantityjustobtained.Asa
result, we deﬁne f (t) = t2+3 and g(t) = 2/t. It follows that r(t) = (g◦f )(t).
You Try It:
Express the function g(x) = 3/(x2 + 5) as the composition of two
functions. Can you express it as the composition of three functions?
1.8.5
THE INVERSE OF A FUNCTION
Let f be the function which assigns to each working adult American his or her
Social Security Number (a 9-digit string of integers). Let g be the function which
assigns to each working adult American his or her age in years (an integer between
0 and 150). Both functions have the same domain, and both take values in the non-
negative integers. But there is a fundamental difference between f and g. If you
are given a Social Security number, then you can determine the person to whom it
belongs. There will be one and only one person with that number. But if you are
given a number between 0 and 150, then there will probably be millions of people
with that age. You cannot identify a person by his/her age. In summary, if you know
g(x) then you generally cannot determine what x is. But if you know f (x) then you
can determine what (or who) x is. This leads to the main idea of this subsection.
Let f : S →T be a function. We say that f has an inverse (is invertible) if
there is a function f −1 : T →S such that (f ◦f −1)(t) = t for all t ∈T and
(f −1 ◦f )(s) = s for all s ∈S. Notice that the symbol f −1 denotes a new function
which we call the inverse of f .
Basic Rule for Finding Inverses
To ﬁnd the inverse of a function f , we
solve the equation
(f ◦f −1)(t) = t
for the function f −1(t).
EXAMPLE 1.40
Find the inverse of the function f (s) = 3s.

CHAPTER 1
Basics
43
SOLUTION
We solve the equation
(f ◦f −1)(t) = t.
This is the same as
f (f −1(t)) = t.
We can rewrite the last line as
3 · f −1(t) = t
or
f −1(t) = t
3.
Thus f −1(t) = t/3.
EXAMPLE 1.41
Let f : R →R be deﬁned by f (s) = 3s5. Find f −1 .
SOLUTION
We solve
(f ◦f −1)(t) = t
or
f (f −1(t)) = t

3[f −1(t)]5 = t
or
[f −1(t)]5 = t

It is important to understand that some functions do not have inverses.
EXAMPLE 1.42
Let f : R →{t : t ≥0} be deﬁned by f (s) = s2. If possible, ﬁnd f −1 .

CHAPTER 1
Basics
44
SOLUTION
Using the Basic Rule, we attempt to solve
(f ◦f −1)(t) = t.
Writing this out, we have
[f −1(t)]2 = t.
But now there is a problem: we cannot solve this equation uniquely for f −1(t).
We do not know whether f −1(t) = +√t or f −1(t) = −√t. Thus f −1 is not
a well deﬁned function. Therefore f is not invertible and f −1 does not exist.
Math Note:
Thereisasimpledevicewhichoftenenablesustoobtainaninverse—
even in situations like Example 1.42. We change the domain of the function. This
idea is illustrated in the next example.
EXAMPLE 1.43
Deﬁnef : {s : s ≥0} →{t : t ≥0} by the formulaf (s) = s2. Findf −1 .

f −1(t)]2 = t.
This looks like the same situation we had in Example 1.42. But in fact things
have improved. Now we know that 
f −1(t) must be +√t, because 
f −1 must

f −1 : {t : t ≥0} →{s : s ≥0} is given by

f −1(t) = +√t.
You Try It:
The equation y = x2+3x does not describe the graph of an invertible
function. Find a way to restrict the domain so that it is invertible.
Now we consider the graph of the inverse function. Suppose that f : S →T
is invertible and that (s, t) is a point on the graph of f . Then t = f (s) hence
s = f −1(t) so that (t, s) is on the graph of f −1. The geometrical connection
between the points (s, t) and (t, s) is exhibited in Fig. 1.47: they are reﬂections of
each other in the line y = x. We have discovered the following important principle:
The graph of f −1 is the reﬂection in the line y = x of the graph of f .
Refer to Fig. 1.48.

EXAMPLE 1.44
Sketch the graph of the inverse of the function f whose graph is shown in
Fig. 1.49.
SOLUTION
By inspection of the graph we see that f is one-to-one (i.e., takes different
domain values to different range values) and onto (i.e., takes on all values in
the range) from S = [−2, 3] to T = [1, 5]. Therefore f has an inverse. The
graph of f −1 is exhibited in Fig. 1.50.

Sketch f (x) = x3 + x and its inverse.
Another useful fact is this: Since an invertible function must be one-to-one, two
different x values cannot correspond to (that is, be “sent by the function to”) the
same y value. Looking at Figs. 1.51 and 1.52, we see that this means
In order for f to be invertible, no horizontal line can
intersect the graph of f more than once.
Fig. 1.51

CHAPTER 1
Basics
47
In Fig. 1.51, the fact that the line y = 2 intersects the graph twice means that
the function f takes the value 2 at two different points of its domain (namely at
x = −2 and x = 6). Thus f is not one-to-one so it cannot be invertible. Figure 1.52
shows what happens if we try to invert f : the resulting curve is not the graph of a
function.
Fig. 1.52
EXAMPLE 1.45
Look at Figs. 1.53 and 1.55. Are the functions whose graphs are shown in
parts (a) and (b) of each ﬁgure invertible?
Fig. 1.53
SOLUTION
Graphs (a) and (b) in Fig. 1.53 are the graphs of invertible functions since
no horizontal line intersects each graph more than once. Of course we must
choose the domain and range appropriately. For (a) we take S = [−4, 4] and
T = [−2, 3]; for (b) we take S = (−3, 4) and T = (0, 5). Graphs (a) and (b)

of Fig. 1.53 respectively. They are obtained by reﬂection in the line y = x.

In Fig. 1.55, graphs (a) and (b) are not the graphs of invertible functions.
For each there is exhibited a horizontal line which intersects the graph twice.
However graphs (a) and (b) in Fig. 1.56 exhibit a way to restrict the domains
of the functions in (a) and (b) of Fig. 1.55 to make them invertible. Graphs (a)
and (b) in Fig. 1.57 show their respective inverses.

A Few Words About Logarithms
and Exponentials
We will give a more thorough treatment of the logarithm and exponential functions
in Chapter 6. For the moment we record a few simple facts so that we may use
these functions in the sections that immediately follow.
The logarithm is a function that is characterized by the property that
log(x · y) = log x + log y.
It follows from this property that
log(x/y) = log x −log y
and
log(xn) = n · log x.
It is useful to think of loga b as the power to which we raise a to get b, for any
a, b > 0. For example, log2 8 = 3 and log3(1/27) = −3. This introduces the idea
of the logarithm to a base.
You Try It:
Calculate log5 125, log3(1/81), log2 16.
The most important base for the logarithm is Euler’s number e ≈2.71828 . . . .
Then we write ln x = loge x. For the moment we take the logarithm to the base e, or
the natural logarithm, to be given. It is characterized among all logarithm functions
by the fact that its graph has tangent line with slope 1 at x = 1. See Fig. 1.58. Then
we set
loga x = ln x
ln a .
Note that this formula gives immediately that loge x = ln x, once we accept that
loge e = 1.

CHAPTER 1
Basics
50
Fig. 1.58
Fig. 1.59
Math Note:
In mathematics, we commonly write log x to mean the natural log-
arithm. Thus you will sometimes encounter ln x and sometimes encounter log x
(without any subscript); they are both understood to mean loge x, the natural
logarithm.
The exponential function exp x is deﬁned to be the inverse function to ln x.
Figure 1.59 shows the graph of y = exp x. In fact we will see later that exp x = ex.
More generally, the function ax is the inverse function to loga x. The exponential
has these properties:

ab+c = ab · ac;

Limits
The single most important idea in calculus is the idea of limit. More than 2000 years
ago, the ancient Greeks wrestled with the limit concept, and they did not succeed. It
is only in the past 200 years that we have ﬁnally come up with a ﬁrm understanding
of limits. Here we give a brief sketch of the essential parts of the limit notion.
Suppose that f is a function whose domain contains two neighboring intervals:
f : (a, c) ∪(c, b) →R. We wish to consider the behavior of f as the variable x
approaches c. If f (x) approaches a particular ﬁnite value ℓas x approaches c, then
we say that the function f has the limit ℓas x approaches c. We write
lim
x→c f (x) = ℓ.
The rigorous mathematical deﬁnition of limit is this:
Deﬁnition 2.1
Let a < c < b and let f be a function whose domain contains
(a, c) ∪(c, b). We say that f has limit ℓat c, and we write limx→c f (x) = ℓwhen
this condition holds: For each ϵ > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that
|f (x) −ℓ| < ϵ
whenever 0 < |x −c| < δ.
It is important to know that there is a rigorous deﬁnition of the limit concept, and
any development of mathematical theory relies in an essential way on this rigorous
deﬁnition. However, in the present book we may make good use of an intuitive

understanding of limit. We now develop that understanding with some carefully
chosen examples.
EXAMPLE 2.1
Deﬁne
f (x) =

3 −x
if x < 1
x2 + 1
if x > 1
See Fig. 2.1. Calculate limx→1 f (x).
Fig. 2.1
SOLUTION
Observe that, when x is to the left of 1 and very near to 1 then f (x) = 3 −x
is very near to 2. Likewise, when x is to the right of 1 and very near to 1 then
f (x) = x2 + 1 is very near to 2. We conclude that
lim
x→1 f (x) = 2.
Wehavesuccessfullycalculatedourﬁrstlimit.Figure2.1conﬁrmstheconclusion
that our calculations derived.
EXAMPLE 2.2
Deﬁne
g(x) = x2 −4
x −2 .
Calculate limx→2 g(x).
SOLUTION
We observe that both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction
deﬁning g tend to 0 as x →2 (i.e., as x tends to 2). Thus the question seems
to be indeterminate.
However, we may factor the numerator as x2 −4 = (x −2)(x + 2).
As long as x ̸= 2 (and these are the only x that we examine when we
TEAMFLY

CHAPTER 2
Foundations of Calculus
59
calculate limx→2), we can then divide the denominator of the expression
deﬁning g into the numerator. Thus
g(x) = x + 2
for x ̸= 2.
Now
lim
x→2 g(x) = lim
x→2 x + 2 = 4.
Fig. 2.2
The graph of the function g is shown in Fig. 2.2. We encourage the reader to
use a pocket calculator to calculate values of g for x near 2 but unequal to 2 to
check the validity of our answer. For example,
x
g(x) = [x2 −4]/[x −2]

We see that, when x is close to 2 (but unequal to 2), then g(x) is close (indeed,
as close as we please) to 4.
You Try It:
Calculate the limit limx→3

.
Math Note:
It must be stressed that, when we calculate limx→c f (x), we do not
evaluate f at c. In the last example it would have been impossible to do so. We want
to determine what we anticipate f will do as x approaches c, not what value (if any)
f actually takes at c. The next example illustrates this point rather dramatically.

EXAMPLE 2.3
Deﬁne
h(x) =

3
if x ̸= 7
1
if x = 7
Calculate limx→7 h(x).
SOLUTION
It would be incorrect to simply plug the value 7 into the function h and
thereby to conclude that the limit is 1. In fact when x is near to 7 but unequal
to 7, we see that h takes the value 3. This statement is true no matter how close
x is to 7. We conclude that limx→7 h(x) = 3.
You Try It:
Calculate limx→4[x2 −x −12]/[x −4].
2.1.1
ONE-SIDED LIMITS
There is also a concept of one-sided limit. We say that
lim
x→c−f (x) = ℓ
if the values of f become closer and closer to ℓwhen x is near to c but on the left.
In other words, in studying limx→c−f (x), we only consider values of x that are
less than c.
Likewise, we say that
lim
x→c+ f (x) = ℓ
if the values of f become closer and closer to ℓwhen x is near to c but on the right.
In other words, in studying limx→c+ f (x), we only consider values of x that are
greater than c.

CHAPTER 2
Foundations of Calculus
61
EXAMPLE 2.4
Discuss the limits of the function
f (x) =

2x −4
if x < 2
x2
if x ≥2
at c = 2.
SOLUTION
As x approaches 2 from the left, f (x) = 2x −4 approaches 0. As x
approaches 2 from the right, f (x) = x2 approaches 4. Thus we see that f
has left limit 0 at c = 2, written
lim
x→2−f (x) = 0,
and f has right limit 4 at c = 2, written
lim
x→2+ f (x) = 4.
Note that the full limit limx→2 f (x) does not exist (because the left and right
limits are unequal).
You Try It:
Discuss one-sided limits at c = 3 for the function
f (x) =



x3 −x
if x < 3
24
if x = 3
4x + 1
if x > 3
All the properties of limits that will be developed in this chapter, as well as the
rest of the book, apply equally well to one-sided limits as to two-sided (or standard)
limits.
2.2
Properties of Limits
To increase our facility in manipulating limits, we have certain arithmetical and
functional rules about limits. Any of these may be veriﬁed using the rigorous deﬁ-
nition of limit that was provided at the beginning of the last section. We shall state
the rules and get right to the examples.
If f and g are two functions, c is a real number, and limx→c f (x) and
limx→c g(x) exist, then
Theorem 2.1
(a)
limx→c(f ± g)(x) = limx→c f (x) ± limx→c g(x);

CHAPTER 2
Foundations of Calculus
62
(b)
limx→c (f · g) (x) = (limx→c f (x)) · (limx→c g(x)) ;
(c)


(x) = limx→c f (x)
limx→c g(x) provided that limx→c g(x) ̸= 0;
(d)
limx→c (α · f (x)) = α · (limx→c f (x)) for any constant α.
Some theoretical results, which will prove useful throughout our study of
calculus, are these:
Theorem 2.2
Let a < c < b. A function f on the interval {x : a < x < b} cannot have two
distinct limits at c.
Theorem 2.3
If
lim
x→c g(x) = 0
and
lim
x→c f (x) either does not exist or exists and is not zero
then
lim
x→c
f (x)
g(x)
does not exist.
Theorem 2.4 (The Pinching Theorem)
Suppose that f, g, and h are functions whose domains each contain S = (a, c) ∪
(c, b). Assume further that
g(x) ≤f (x) ≤h(x)
for all x ∈S. Refer to Fig. 2.4.

If

x→c g(x) = ℓ

CHAPTER 2

63
and
lim
x→c h(x) = ℓ
then
lim
x→c f (x) = ℓ.
EXAMPLE 2.5
Calculate limx→3 4x3 −7x2 + 5x −9.
SOLUTION
We may apply Theorem 2.1(a) repeatedly to see that
lim
x→3 4x3 −7x2 + 5x −9 = lim
x→3 4x3 −lim
x→3 7x2 + lim
x→3 5x −lim
x→3 9.
(∗)
We next observe that limx→3 x = 3. This assertion is self-evident, for when x
is near to 3 then x is near to 3. Applying Theorem 2.1(d) and Theorem 2.1(b)
repeatedly, we now see that
lim
x→3 4x3 = 4 ·
	
lim
x→3 x

·
	
lim
x→3 x

·

= 4 · 3 · 3 · 3 = 108.
Also

lim

lim
x→3 x

= 7 · 3 · 3 = 63,
lim
x→3 5x = 5 ·
	
lim
x→3 x

= 5 · 3 = 15.
Of course limx→3 9 = 9.
Putting all this information into equation (∗) gives
lim
x→3 4x3 −7x2 + 5x −9 = 108 −63 + 15 −9 = 51.
EXAMPLE 2.6
Use the Pinching Theorem to analyze the limit
lim
x→0 x sin x.
SOLUTION
We observe that
−|x| ≡g(x) ≤f (x) = x sin x ≤h(x) ≡|x|.
Thus we may apply the Pinching Theorem. Obviously
lim
x→0 g(x) = lim
x→0 h(x) = 0.
We conclude that limx→0 f (x) = 0.

The denominator tends to 0 while the numerator does not. According to
Theorem 2.3, the limit cannot exist.

2.3
Continuity
Let f be a function whose domain contains the interval (a, b). Assume that c is a
point of (a, b). We say that the function f is continuous at c if
lim
x→c f (x) = f (c).
Conceptually, f is continuous at c if the expected value of f at c equals the actual
value of f at c.
EXAMPLE 2.8
Is the function
f (x) =

2x2 −x
if x < 2
3x
if x ≥2
continuous at x = 2?
SOLUTION
We easily check that limx→2 f (x) = 6.Also the actual value of f at 2, given
by the second part of the formula, is equal to 6. By the deﬁnition of continuity,
we may conclude that f is continuous at x = 2. See Fig. 2.5.
EXAMPLE 2.9
Where is the function
g(x) =



1
x −3
if x < 4
2x + 3
if x ≥4
continuous?

CHAPTER 2
Foundations of Calculus
65
Fig. 2.5
SOLUTION
If x < 3 then the function is plainly continuous. The function is undeﬁned
at x = 3 so we may not even speak of continuity at x = 3. The function is also
obviously continuous for 3 < x < 4. At x = 4 the limit of g does not exist—it
is 1 from the left and 11 from the right. So the function is not continuous (we
sometimes say that it is discontinuous) at x = 4. By inspection, the function is
continuous for x > 4.
You Try It:
Discuss continuity of the function
g(x) =



x −x2
if x < −2
10
if x = −2
−5x
if x > −2
We note that Theorem 2.1 guarantees that the collection of continuous functions
is closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (as long as we do not
divide by 0), and scalar multiplication.
Math Note:
If f ◦g makes sense, if limx→c g(x) = ℓ, and if lims→ℓf (s) = m,
then it does not necessarily follow that limx→c f ◦g(x) = m. [We invite the reader
to ﬁnd an example.] One must assume, in addition, that f is continuous at ℓ. This
point will come up from time to time in our later studies.
In the next section we will learn the concept of the derivative. It will turn out
that a function that possesses the derivative is also continuous.

CHAPTER 2

2.4
The Derivative
Suppose that f is a function whose domain contains the interval (a, b). Let c be a
point of (a, b). If the limit
lim
h→0
f (c + h) −f (c)
h
(∗)
exists then we say that f is differentiable at c and we call the limit the derivative
of f at c.
EXAMPLE 2.10
Is the function f (x) = x2 + x differentiable at x = 2? If it is, calculate the
derivative.
SOLUTION
We calculate the limit (∗), with the role of c played by 2:
lim
h→0
f (2 + h) −f (2)
h
= lim
h→0
[(2 + h)2 + (2 + h)] −[22 + 2]
h
= lim
h→0
[(4 + 4h + h2) + (2 + h)] −[6]
h
= lim
h→0
5h + h2
h
= lim
h→0 5 + h
= 5.
We see that the required limit (∗) exists, and that it equals 5. Thus the function
f (x) = x2 + x is differentiable at x = 2, and the value of the derivative is 5.
Math Note:
When the derivative of a function f exists at a point c, then we denote
the derivative either by f ′(c) or by (d/dx)f (c) = (df /dx)(c). In some contexts
(e.g., physics) the notation ˙f (c) is used. In the last example, we calculated that
f ′(2) = 5.
The importance of the derivative is two-fold: it can be interpreted as rate of
change and it can be interpreted as the slope. Let us now consider both of these
ideas.
Suppose that ϕ(t) represents the position (in inches or feet or some other standard
unit) of a moving body at time t. At time 0 the body is at ϕ(0), at time 3 the body is
at ϕ(3), and so forth. Imagine that we want to determine the instantaneous velocity
of the body at time t = c. What could this mean? One reasonable interpretation
is that we can calculate the average velocity over a small interval at c, and let the

CHAPTER 2
Foundations of Calculus
67
length of that interval shrink to zero to determine the instantaneous velocity. To
carry out this program, imagine a short interval [c, c + h]. The average velocity of
the moving body over that interval is
vav ≡ϕ(c + h) −ϕ(c)
h
.
Thisisafamiliarexpression(see(∗)).Asweleth →0,weknowthatthisexpression
tends to the derivative of ϕ at c. On the other hand, it is reasonable to declare this
limit to be the instantaneous velocity. We have discovered the following important
rule:
Let ϕ be a differentiable function on an interval (a, b). Suppose that ϕ(t)
represents the position of a moving body. Let c ∈(a, b). Then
ϕ′(c ) = instantaneous velocity of the moving body at c.
Now let us consider slope. Look at the graph of the function y = f (x) in Fig. 2.6.
We wish to determine the “slope” of the graph at the point x = c. This is the same
as determining the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f at x = c, where the
tangent line is the line that best approximates the graph at that point. See Fig. 2.7.
What could this mean? After all, it takes two points to determine the slope of a line,
yet we are only given the point (c, f (c)) on the graph. One reasonable interpretation
of the slope at (c, f (c)) is that it is the limit of the slopes of secant lines determined
Fig. 2.6
Fig. 2.7

CHAPTER 2
Foundations of Calculus
68
by (c, f (c)) and nearby points (c + h, f (c + h)). See Fig. 2.8. Let us calculate this
limit:
lim
h→0
f (c + h) −f (c)
(c + h) −c
= lim
h→0
f (c + h) −f (c)
h
.
Fig. 2.8
We know that this last limit (the same as (∗)) is the derivative of f at c. We have
learned the following:
Let f be a differentiable function on an interval (a, b). Let c ∈(a, b). Then
the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f at c is f ′(c ).
EXAMPLE 2.11
Calculate the instantaneous velocity at time t = 5 of an automobile whose
position at time t seconds is given by g(t) = t3 + 4t2 + 10 feet.
SOLUTION
We know that the required instantaneous velocity is g′(5). We calculate
g′(5) = lim
h→0
g(5 + h) −g(5)
h
= lim
h→0
[(5 + h)3 + 4(5 + h)2 + 10] −[53 + 4 · 52 + 10]

CHAPTER 2
Foundations of Calculus
69
We conclude that the instantaneous velocity of the moving body at time t = 5
is g′(5) = 115 ft/sec.
Math Note:
Since position (or distance) is measured in feet, and time in seconds,
then we measure velocity in feet per second.
EXAMPLE 2.12
Calculate the slope of the tangent line to the graph of y = f (x) = x3 −3x
at x = −2. Write the equation of the tangent line. Draw a ﬁgure illustrating
these ideas.
SOLUTION
We know that the desired slope is equal to f ′(−2). We calculate
f ′(−2) = lim
h→0
f (−2 + h) −f (−2)
h
= lim
h→0
[(−2 + h)3 −3(−2 + h)] −[(−2)3 −3(−2)]
h

h
= lim
h→0
h3 −6h2 + 9h
h
= lim
h→0 h2 −6h + 9
= 9.
We conclude that the slope of the tangent line to the graph of y = x3 −3x at
x = −2 is 9. The tangent line passes through (−2, f (−2)) = (−2, −2) and
has slope 9. Thus it has equation
y −(−2) = 9(x −(−2)).
The graph of the function and the tangent line are exhibited in Fig. 2.9.
You Try It:
Calculate the tangent line to the graph of f (x) = 4x2 −5x + 2 at the
point where x = 2.
EXAMPLE 2.13
A rubber balloon is losing air steadily. At time t minutes the balloon contains
75−10t2 + t cubic inches of air.What is the rate of loss of air in the balloon
at time t = 1?

CHAPTER 2

70
x
Fig. 2.9
SOLUTION
Let ψ(t) = 75 −10t2 + t. Of course the rate of loss of air is given by ψ′(1).
We therefore calculate
ψ′(1) = lim
h→0
ψ(1 + h) −ψ(1)
h
= lim
h→0
[75 −10(1 + h)2 + (1 + h)] −[75 −10 · 12 + 1]

h
= lim
h→0
−19h −10h2
h
= lim
h→0 −19 −10h
= −19.
In conclusion, the rate of air loss in the balloon at time t = 1 is ψ′(1) =
−19 ft3/sec. Observe that the negative sign in this answer indicates that the
change is negative, i.e., that the quantity is decreasing.
You Try It:
The amount of water in a leaky tank is given by W(t) = 50 −5t2 + t
gallons. What is the rate of leakage of the water at time t = 2?
Math Note:
We have noted that the derivative may be used to describe a rate of
change and also to denote the slope of the tangent line to a graph. These are really
two different manifestations of the same thing, for a slope is the rate of change of
rise with respect to run (see Section 1.4 on the slope of a line).

2.5
Rules for Calculating Derivatives
Calculus is a powerful tool, for much of the physical world that we wish to analyze
is best understood in terms of rates of change. It becomes even more powerful when
we can ﬁnd some simple rules that enable us to calculate derivatives quickly and
easily. This section is devoted to that topic.
I
Derivative of a Sum [The Sum Rule]:
We calculate the derivative of a sum
(or difference) by
(f (x) ± g(x))′ = f ′(x) ± g′(x).
In our many examples, we have used this fact implicitly. We are now just
enunciating it formally.
II
Derivative of a Product [The Product Rule]:
We calculate the derivative
of a product by
[f (x) · g(x)]′ = f ′(x) · g(x) + f (x) · g′(x).
We urge the reader to test this formula on functions that we have worked with
before. It has a surprising form. Note in particular that it is not the case that
[f (x) · g(x)]′ = f ′(x) · g′(x).
III
Derivative of a Quotient [The Quotient Rule]:
We calculate the derivative
of a quotient by
f (x)
g(x)
′
= g(x) · f ′(x) −f (x) · g′(x)
g2(x)
.
In fact one can derive this new formula by applying the product formula to
g(x) · [f (x)/g(x)]. We leave the details for the interested reader.
IV
Derivative of a Composition [The Chain Rule]:
We calculate the
derivative of a composition by
[f ◦g(x)]′ = f ′(g(x)) · g′(x).
To make optimum use of these four new formulas, we need a library of functions
to which to apply them.
A
Derivatives of Powers of x:
If f (x) = xk then f ′(x) = k · xk−1, where
k ∈{0, 1, 2, . . .}.
Math Note:
If you glance back at the examples we have done, you will notice that
we have already calculated that the derivative of x is 1, the derivative of x2 is 2x,

CHAPTER 2
Foundations of Calculus
72
and the derivative of x3 is 3x2. The rule just enunciated is a generalization of these
facts, and is established in just the same way.
B
Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions:
The rules for differentiating sine
and cosine are simple and elegant:
1.
d
dx sin x = cos x.
2.
d
dx cos x = −sin x.
We can ﬁnd the derivatives of the other trigonometric functions by using these two
facts together with the quotient rule from above:
3.
d
dx tan x = d
dx
sin x
cos x = cos x(d/dx) sin x −sin x(d/dx) cos x
(cos x)2
= (cos x)2 + (sin x)2
(cos x)2
=
1
(cos x)2 = (sec x)2.
Similarly we have
4.
d
dx cot x = −(csc x)2.
5.
d
dx sec x = sec x tan x.
6.
d
dx csc x = −csc x cot x.
C
Derivatives of ln x and ex:
We conclude our library of derivatives of basic
functions with
d
dx ex = ex
and
d
dx ln x = 1
x .
We may apply the Chain Rule to obtain the following particularly useful general-
ization of this logarithmic derivative:
d
dx ln ϕ(x) = ϕ′(x)
ϕ(x) .
Now it is time to learn to differentiate the functions that we will commonly
encounter in our work. We do so by applying the rules for sums, products, quotients,
and compositions to the formulas for the derivatives of the elementary functions.

CHAPTER 2
Foundations of Calculus
73
Practice is the essential tool in mastery of these ideas. Be sure to do all the You Try
It problems in this section.
EXAMPLE 2.14
Calculate the derivative
d
dx[(sin x + x) · (x3 −ln x)].
SOLUTION
We know that (d/dx) sin x = cos x, (d/dx)x = 1, (d/dx)x3 = 3x2, and
(d/dx) ln x = (1/x). Therefore, by the addition rule,
d
dx (sin x + x) = d
dx sin x + d
dx x = cos x + 1
and
d
dx (x3 −ln x) = d
dx x3 −d
dx ln x = 3x2 −1
x .
Now we may conclude the calculation by applying the product rule:
d

(sin x + x) · (x3 −ln x)

= d
dx (sin x + x) · (x3 −ln x) + (sin x + x) · d

This is the composition of functions, so we must apply the Chain Rule. It is

will play the role of g.
Notice that, if x is the variable, then x3 −x2 is applied ﬁrst and sin
applied next. So it must be that g(x) = x3 −x2 and f (s) = sin s. Notice that

THE DERIVATIVE OF AN INVERSE
An important formula in the calculus relates the derivative of the inverse of a
function to the derivative of the function itself. The formula is
[f −1]′(t) =
1
f ′(f −1(t)).
(⋆)
We encourage you to apply the Chain Rule to the formula f (f −1(x)) = x to obtain
a formal derivation of the formula (⋆).
EXAMPLE 2.19
Calculate the derivative of g(t) = t1/3 .
SOLUTION
Set f (s) = s3 and apply formula (⋆). Then f ′(s) = 3s2 and f −1(t) = t1/3.
With s = f −1(t) we then have
[f −1]′(t) =

f ′(f −1(t)) =

2.6
The Derivative as a Rate of Change
If f (t) represents the position of a moving body, or the amount of a changing quan-
tity, at time t, then the derivative f ′(t) (equivalently, (d/dt)f (t)) denotes the rate
of change of position (also called velocity) or the rate of change of the quantity.

CHAPTER 2
Foundations of Calculus
77
When f ′(t) represents velocity, then sometimes we calculate another derivative—
(f ′)′(t)—and this quantity denotes the rate of change of velocity, or acceleration.
In specialized applications, even more derivatives are sometimes used. For
example, sometimes the derivative of the acceleration is called jerk and sometimes
the derivative of jerk is called surge.
EXAMPLE 2.20
The position of a body moving along a linear track is given by p(t) = 3t2 −
5t + 7 feet.Calculate the velocity and the acceleration at time t = 3 seconds.
SOLUTION
The velocity is given by
p′(t) = 6t −5.
At time t = 3 we therefore ﬁnd that the velocity is p′(3) = 18 −5 = 13 ft/sec.
The acceleration is given by the second derivative:
p′′(t) = (p′)′(t) = (6t −5)′ = 6.
The acceleration at time t = 3 is therefore 6 ft/sec2.
Math Note:
As previously noted, velocity is measured in feet per second (or
ft/sec).Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time; therefore
acceleration is measured in “feet per second per second” (or ft/sec2).
EXAMPLE 2.21
A massive ball is dropped from a tower. It is known that a falling body
descends (near the surface of the earth) with an acceleration of about 32
ft /sec. From this information one can determine that the equation for the
position of the ball at time t is
p(t) = −16t2 + v0t + h0 ft.
Here v0 is the initial velocity and h0 is the initial height of the ball in feet.1
Also t is time measured in seconds. If the ball hits the earth after 5 seconds,
then determine the height from which the ball is dropped.
SOLUTION
Observe that the velocity is
v(t) = p′(t) = −32t + v0.
Obviously the initial velocity of a falling body is 0. Thus
0 = v(0) = −32 · 0 + v0.
1 We shall say more about this equation, and this technique, in Section 3.4.

CHAPTER 2
Foundations of Calculus
78
It follows that v0 = 0, thus conﬁrming our intuition that the initial velocity
is 0. Thus
p(t) = −16t2 + h0.
Now we also know that p(5) = 0; that is, at time t = 5 the ball is at height 0.
Thus
0 = p(5) = −16 · 52 + h0.
We may solve this equation for h0 to determine that h0 = 400.
We conclude that
p(t) = −16t2 + 400.
Furthermore, p(0) = 400, so the initial height of the ball is 400 feet.
You Try It:
Suppose that a massive ball falls from a height of 600 feet. After how
many seconds will it strike the ground?

Graphing of Functions
We know that the value of the derivative of a function f at a point x represents the
slope of the tangent line to the graph of f at the point (x, f (x)). If that slope is
positive, then the tangent line rises as x increases from left to right, hence so does
the curve (we say that the function is increasing). If instead the slope of the tangent
line is negative, then the tangent line falls as x increases from left to right, hence
so does the curve (we say that the function is decreasing). We summarize:
On an interval where f ′ > 0 the graph of f goes uphill.
On an interval where f ′ < 0 the graph of f goes downhill.
See Fig. 3.1.
Withsomeadditionalthought,wecanalsogetusefulinformationfromthesecond
derivative. If f ′′ = (f ′)′ > 0 at a point, then f ′ is increasing. Hence the slope of the
tangent line is getting ever greater (the graph is concave up). The picture must be as
in Fig. 3.2(a) or 3.2(b). If instead f ′′ = (f ′)′ < 0 at a point then f ′ is decreasing.
Hence the slope of the tangent line is getting ever less (the graph is concave down).
The picture must be as in Fig. 3.3(a) or 3.3(b).
Using information about the ﬁrst and second derivatives, we can render rather
accurate graphs of functions. We now illustrate with some examples.

SOLUTION
Of course this is a simple and familiar function, and you know that its graph
is a parabola. But it is satisfying to see calculus conﬁrm the shape of the graph.
Let us see how this works.

CHAPTER 3 Applications of the Derivative
83
First observe that f ′(x) = 2x. We see that f ′ < 0 when x < 0 and f ′ > 0
when x > 0. So the graph is decreasing on the negative real axis and the graph
is increasing on the positive real axis.
Next observe that f ′′(x) = 2. Thus f ′′ > 0 at all points. Thus the graph is
concave up everywhere.
Finally note that the graph passes through the origin.
We summarize this information in the graph shown in Fig. 3.4.
Fig. 3.4
EXAMPLE 3.2
Sketch the graph of f (x) = x3.
SOLUTION
First observe that f ′(x) = 3x2. Thus f ′ ≥0 everywhere. The function is
always increasing.
Second observe that f ′′(x) = 6x. Thus f ′′(x) < 0 when x < 0 and
f ′′(x) > 0 when x > 0. So the graph is concave down on the negative real
axis and concave up on the positive real axis.
Finally note that the graph passes through the origin.
We summarize our ﬁndings in the graph shown in Fig. 3.5.
You Try It:
Use calculus to aid you in sketching the graph of f (x) = x3 + x.
EXAMPLE 3.3
Sketch the graph of g(x) = x + sin x.
SOLUTION
We see that g′(x) = 1 + cos x. Since −1 ≤cos x ≤1, it follows that
g′(x) ≥0. Hence the graph of g is always increasing.
Now g′′(x) = −sin x. This function is positive sometimes and negative
sometimes. In fact
−sin x is positive when kπ < x < (k + 1)π, k odd

CHAPTER 3 Applications of the Derivative
84
Fig. 3.5
and
−sin x is negative when kπ < x < (k + 1)π, k even.
So the graph alternates being concave down and concave up. Of course it also
passes through the origin. We amalgamate all our information in the graph
shown in Fig. 3.6.

EXAMPLE 3.4
Sketch the graph of h(x) = x/(x + 1 ).

CHAPTER 3 Applications of the Derivative
85
SOLUTION
First note that the function is undeﬁned at x = −1.
We calculate that h′(x) = 1/((x + 1)2). Thus the graph is everywhere
increasing (except at x = −1).
We also calculate that h′′(x) = −2/((x + 1)3). Hence h′′ > 0 and the graph
is concave up when x < −1. Likewise h′′ < 0 and the graph is concave down
when x > −1.
Finally, as x tends to −1 from the left we notice that h tends to +∞and as
x tends to −1 from the right we see that h tends to −∞.
Putting all this information together, we obtain the graph shown in Fig. 3.7.

You Try It:
Sketch the graph of the function k(x) = x ·
√
x + 1.
EXAMPLE 3.5
Sketch the graph of k(x) = x3 + 3x2 −9x + 6.
SOLUTION
We notice that k′(x) = 3x2 + 6x −9 = 3(x −1)(x + 3). So the sign of k′
changes at x = 1 and x = −3. We conclude that
k′ is positive when x < −3;
k′ is negative when −3 < x < 1;
k′ is positive when x > 3.
Finally, k′′(x) = 6x +6. Thus the graph is concave down when x < −1 and
the graph is concave up when x > −1.
Putting all this information together, and using the facts that k(x) →−∞
when x →−∞and k(x) →+∞when x →+∞, we obtain the graph shown
in Fig. 3.8.

Maximum/Minimum Problems
One of the great classical applications of the calculus is to determine the maxima
and minima of functions. Look at Fig. 3.9. It shows some (local) maxima and (local)
minima of the function f .
Fig. 3.9
Notice that a maximum has the characterizing property that it looks like a hump:
the function is increasing to the left of the hump and decreasing to the right of the
hump. The derivative at the hump is 0: the function neither increases nor decreases

CHAPTER 3 Applications of the Derivative
87
at a local maximum. This is sometimes called Fermat’s test. Also, we see that the
graph is concave down at a local maximum.
It is common to refer to the points where the derivative vanishes as critical points.
In some contexts, we will designate the endpoints of the domain of our function to
be critical points as well.
Now look at a local minimum. Notice that a minimum has the characterizing
property that it looks like a valley: the function is decreasing to the left of the valley
and increasing to the right of the valley. The derivative at the valley is 0: the function
neither increases nor decreases at a local minimum. This is another manifestation
of Fermat’s test. Also, we see that the graph is concave up at a local minimum.
Let us now apply these mathematical ideas to some concrete examples.
EXAMPLE 3.6
Find all local maxima and minima of the function k(x) = x3−3x2−24x +5.
SOLUTION
We begin by calculating the ﬁrst derivative:
k′(x) = 3x2 −6x −24 = 3(x + 2)(x −4).
We notice that k′ vanishes only when x = −2 or x = 4. These are the only
candidates for local maxima or minima. The second derivative is k′′(x) =
6x −6. Now k′′(4) = 18 > 0, so x = 4 is the location of a local minimum.
Also k′′(−2) = −18 < 0, so x = −2 is the location of a local maximum.
A glance at the graph of this function, as depicted in Fig. 3.10, conﬁrms our
calculations.
EXAMPLE 3.7
Find all local maxima and minima of the function g(x) = x + sin x.
SOLUTION
First we calculate that
g′(x) = 1 + cos x.
Thus g′ vanishes at the points (2k + 1)π for k = . . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . ..
Now g′′(x) = sin x. And g′′((2k + 1)π) = 0. Thus the second derivative test
is inconclusive. Let us instead look at the ﬁrst derivative. We notice that it is
always ≥0. But, as we have already noticed, the ﬁrst derivative changes sign at
a local maximum or minimum. We conclude that none of the points (2k + 1)π
is either a maximum nor a minimum. The graph in Fig. 3.11 conﬁrms this
calculation.
You Try It:

the sheet and then folding up the sides (see Fig. 3.12). What is the box of
greatest volume that can be constructed in this fashion?
Fig. 3.12
SOLUTION
It is important in a problem of this kind to introduce a variable. Let x be the
side length of the squares that are to be cut from the sheet of cardboard. Then
the side length of the resulting box will be 12 −2x (see Fig. 3.13). Also the
height of the box will be x. As a result, the volume of the box will be
V (x) = x · (12 −2x) · (12 −2x) = 144x −48x2 + 4x3.
Our job is to maximize this function V .
x
12 _ 2x
Fig. 3.13
Now V ′(x) = 144 −96x + 12x2. We may solve the quadratic equation
144 −96x + 12x2 = 0
to ﬁnd the critical points for this problem. Using the quadratic formula, we
ﬁnd that x = 2 and x = 6 are the critical points. Now V ′′(x) = −96 + 24x.
Since V ′′(2) = −48 < 0, we conclude that x = 2 is a local maximum for the
problem. In fact we can sketch a graph of V (x) using ideas from calculus and
see that x = 2 is a global maximum.
We conclude that if squares of side 2′′ are cut from the sheet of cardboard
then a box of maximum volume will result.
Observe in passing that if squares of side 6′′ are cut from the sheet then (there
will be no cardboard left!) the resulting box will have zero volume. This value
for x gives a minimum for the problem.

the garden of greatest area?
SOLUTION
Look at Fig. 3.14. Let x denote the side of the garden that is perpendicular
to the side of the garage. Then the resulting garden has width x feet and length
100 −2x feet. The area of the garden is
A(x) = x · (100 −2x) = 100x −2x2.

We calculate A′(x) = 100 −4x and ﬁnd that the only critical point for the
problem is x = 25. Since A′′(x) = −4 for all x, we determine that x = 25 is
a local maximum. By inspection, we see that the graph of A is a downward-
opening parabola. So x = 25 must also be the global maximum that we seek.
The optimal dimensions for the garden are
width = 25 ft.
length = 50 ft.

The sum of two positive numbers is 60. How can we choose them so as to

SOLUTION
Let x be one of the two numbers. Then the other is 60 −x. Their product is
P(x) = x · (60 −x) = 60x −x2.

CHAPTER 3 Applications of the Derivative
91
Thus P is the quantity that we wish to maximize. Calculating the derivative,
we ﬁnd that
P ′(x) = 60 −2x.
Thus the only critical point for the problem is x = 30. Since P ′′(x) ≡−2, we
ﬁnd that x = 30 is a local maximum. Since the graph of P is a downward-
opening parabola, we can in fact be sure that x = 30 is a global maximum.
We conclude that the two numbers that add to 60 and maximize the product
are 30 and 30.

Related Rates
If a tree is growing in a forest, then both its height and its radius will be increasing.
These two growths will depend in turn on (i) the amount of sunlight that hits the
tree, (ii) the amount of nutrients in the soil, (iii) the proximity of other trees. We
may wish to study the relationship among these various parameters. For example,
if we know that the amount of sunlight and nutrients are increasing at a certain rate
then we may wish to know how that affects the rate of change of the radius. This
consideration gives rise to related rates problems.
EXAMPLE 3.11
A toy balloon is in the shape of a sphere. It is being inﬂated at the rate
of 20 in.3/min. At the moment that the sphere has volume 64 cubic inches,
what is the rate of change of the radius?
SOLUTION
We know that volume and radius of a sphere are related by the formula
V = 4π

The free variable in this problem is time, so we differentiate equation (∗) with

A 13-foot ladder leans against a wall (Fig.3.15).The foot of the ladder begins
to slide away from the wall at the rate of 1 foot per minute. When the foot is
5 feet from the wall, at what rate is the top of the ladder falling?

SOLUTION
Leth(t)betheheightoftheladderattimet andb(t)bethedistanceofthebase
of the ladder to the wall at time t. Then the Pythagorean theorem tells us that
h(t)2 + b(t)2 = 132.
We may differentiate both sides of this equation with respect to the variable t
(which is time in minutes) to obtain
2 · h(t) · h′(t) + 2 · b(t) · b′(t) = 0.
Solving for h′(t) yields
h′(t) = −b(t) · b′(t)
h(t)
.

At the instant the problem is posed, b(t) = 5, h(t) = 12 (by the Pythagorean
theorem), and b′(t) = 1. Substituting these values into the equation yields
h′(t) = −5 · 1
12 = −5
12 ft/min.
Observe that the answer is negative, which is appropriate since the top of the
ladder is falling.

EXAMPLE 3.13
A sponge is in the shape of a right circular cone (Fig. 3.16). As it soaks up
water, it grows in size. At a certain moment, the height equals 6 inches, and
is increasing at the rate of 0.3 inches per second. At that same moment, the
radius is 4 inches, and is increasing at the rate of 0.2 inches per second.
How is the volume changing at that time?

We know that the volume V of a right circular cone is related to the height

3.4
Falling Bodies
It is known that, near the surface of the earth, a body falls with acceleration (due
to gravity) of about 32 ft/sec2. If we let h(t) be the height of the object at time t
(measured in seconds), then our information is that
h′′(t) = −32.
Observe the minus sign to indicate that height is decreasing.
Now we will do some organized guessing. What could h′ be? It is some function
whose derivative is the constant −32. Our experience indicates that polynomials
decrease in degree when we differentiate them. That is, the degree goes from 5 to 4,
or from 3 to 2. Since, h′′ is a polynomial of degree 0, we therefore determine
that h′ will be a polynomial of degree 1. A moment’s thought then suggests that
h′(t) = −32t. This works! If h′(t) = −32t then h′′(t) = [h′(t)]′ = −32. In fact
we can do a bit better. Since constants differentiate to zero, our best guess of what
the velocity should be is h′(t) = −32t +v0, where v0 is an undetermined constant.
Now let us guess what form h(t) should have. We can learn from our experience
in the last paragraph. The “antiderivative” of −32t (a polynomial of degree 1)
should be a polynomial of degree 2.After a little ﬁddling, we guess −16t2.And this
works. The antiderivative of v0 (a polynomial of degree 0) should be a polynomial
of degree 1. After a little ﬁddling, we guess v0t. And this works. Taking all this
information together, we ﬁnd that the “antiderivative” of h′(t) = −32t + v0 is
h(t) = −16t2 + v0t + h0.
(†)
Notice that we have once again thrown in an additive constant h0. This does no
harm:
h′(t) = [−16t2]′ + [v0t]′ + [h0]′ = −32t + v0,
just as we wish. And, to repeat what we have already conﬁrmed,
h′′(t) = [h′(t)]′ = [−32t]′ + [v0]′ = −32.

CHAPTER 3 Applications of the Derivative
95
We now have a general formula (namely (†)) for the position of a falling body at
time t. [Recall that we were ﬁrst introduced to this formula in Section 2.6.] See
Fig. 3.17.
Fig. 3.17
Before doing some examples, we observe that a falling body will have initial
velocity 0. Thus
0 = h′(0) = −32 · 0 + v0.
Hence, for a falling body, v0 = 0. In some problems we may give the body an
initial push, and then v0 will not be zero.
EXAMPLE 3.14
Suppose that a falling body hits the ground with velocity −100 ft/sec. What
was the initial height of the body?
SOLUTION
With notation as developed above, we know that velocity is given by
h′(t) = −32t + 0.
We have taken v0 to be 0 because the body is a falling body; it had no initial
push. If T is the time at which the body hits the ground, then we know that
−100 = h′(T ) = −32 · T.
As a result, T = 25/8 sec.

CHAPTER 3 Applications of the Derivative
96
When the body hits the ground, its height is 0. Thus we know that
0 = h(T ) = h(25/8) = −16 · (25/8)2 + h0.
We may solve for h0 to obtain
h0 = 625
4 .
Thus all the information about our falling body is given by
h(t) = −16t2 + 625
4 .
At time t = 0 we have
h(0) = 625
4 .
Thus the initial height of the falling body is 625/4 ft = 156.25 ft.
Notice that, in the process of solving the last example, and in the discussion
preceding it, we learned that h0 represents the initial height of the falling body and
v0 represents the initial velocity of the falling body. This information will be useful
in the other examples that we examine.
EXAMPLE 3.15
A body is thrown straight down with an initial velocity of 10 feet per second.
It strikes the ground in 12 seconds. What was the initial height?
SOLUTION
We know that v0 = −10 and that h(12) = 0. This is the information that we
must exploit in solving the problem. Now
h(t) = −16t2 −10t + h0.
Thus
0 = h(12) = −16 · 122 −10 · 12 + h0.
We may solve for h0 to obtain
h0 = 2424 ft.
The initial height is 2424 feet.
You Try It:
A body is thrown straight up with initial velocity 5 feet per second
from a height of 40 feet. After how many seconds will it hit the ground? What will

EXAMPLE 3.16
A body is launched straight up from height 100 feet with some initial velocity.
It hits the ground after 10 seconds. What was that initial velocity?
SOLUTION
We are given that h0 = 100. Thus
h(t) = −16t2 + v0t + 100.
Our job is to ﬁnd v0. We also know that
0 = h(10) = −16 · 102 + v0 · 10 + 100.
We solve this equation to ﬁnd that v0 = 150 ft /sec.
You Try It:

CHAPTER 4
The Integral

Introduction
Many processes, both in mathematics and in nature, involve addition.You are famil-
iar with the discrete process of addition, in which you add ﬁnitely many numbers
to obtain a sum or aggregate. But there are important instances in which we wish
to add inﬁnitely many terms. One important example is in the calculation of area—
especially the area of an unusual (non-rectilinear) shape. A standard strategy is to
approximate the desired area by the sum of small, thin rectangular regions (whose
areas are easy to calculate). A second example is the calculation of work, in which
we think of the work performed over an interval or curve as the aggregate of small
increments of work performed over very short intervals. We need a mathematical
formalism for making such summation processes natural and comfortable. Thus we
will develop the concept of the integral.
4.1
Antiderivatives and Indefinite
Integrals
4.1.1
THE CONCEPT OF ANTIDERIVATIVE
Let f be a given function. We have already seen in the theory of falling bodies
(Section 3.4) that it can be useful to ﬁnd a function F such that F ′ = f . We call

CHAPTER 4
The Integral
100
such a function F an antiderivative of f . In fact we often want to ﬁnd the most
general function F, or a family of functions, whose derivative equals f . We can
sometimes achieve this goal by a process of organized guessing.
Suppose that f (x) = cos x. If we want to guess an antiderivative, then we
are certainly not going to try a polynomial. For if we differentiate a polynomial
then we get another polynomial. So that will not do the job. For similar reasons
we are not going to guess a logarithm or an exponential. In fact the way that we
get a trigonometric function through differentiation is by differentiating another
trigonometric function. What trigonometric function, when differentiated, gives
cos x? There are only six functions to try, and a moment’s thought reveals that
F(x) = sin x does the trick. In fact an even better answer is F(x) = sin x +C. The
constant differentiates to 0, so F ′(x) = f (x) = cos x. We have seen in our study
of falling bodies that the additive constant gives us a certain amount of ﬂexibility
in solving problems.
Now suppose that f (x) = x2. We have already noted that the way to get a
polynomial through differentiation is to differentiate another polynomial. Since
differentiation reduces the degree of the polynomial by 1, it is natural to guess that
the F we seek is a polynomial of degree 3. What about F(x) = x3? We calculate
that F ′(x) = 3x2. That does not quite work. We seek x2 for our derivative, but
we got 3x2. This result suggests adjusting our guess. We instead try F(x) = x3/3.
Then, indeed, F ′(x) = 3x2/3 = x2, as desired. We will write F(x) = x3/3 + C
for our antiderivative.
More generally, suppose that f (x) = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d. Using the reasoning
in the last paragraph, we may ﬁnd fairly easily that F(x) = ax4/4 + bx3/3 +
cx2/2 + dx + e. Notice that, once again, we have thrown in an additive constant.
You Try It:
Find a family of antiderivatives for the function f (x) = sin 2x −
x4 + ex.
4.1.2
THE INDEFINITE INTEGRAL
In practice, it is useful to have a compact notation for the antiderivative. What we
do, instead of saying that “the antiderivative of f (x) is F(x) + C,” is to write

f (x) dx = F(x) + C.
So, for example,

cos x dx = sin x + C
and

x3 + x dx = x4
4 + x2
2 + C

CHAPTER 4
The Integral

and

e2x dx = e2x
2 + C.
The symbol

is called an integral sign (the symbol is in fact an elongated “S”)
and the symbol “dx” plays a traditional role to remind us what the variable is. We
call an expression like

f (x) dx
an indeﬁnite integral. The name comes from the fact that later on we will have a
notion of “deﬁnite integral” that speciﬁes what value C will take—so it is more
deﬁnite in the answer that it gives.
EXAMPLE 4.1
Calculate

sin(3x + 1) dx.
SOLUTION
We know that we must guess a trigonometric function. Running through
the choices, cosine seems like the best candidate. The derivative of cos x is
−sin x. So we immediately see that −cos x is a better guess—its derivative
is sin x. But then we adjust our guess to F(x) = −cos(3x + 1) to take into
account the form of the argument. This almost works: we may calculate that
F ′(x) = 3 sin(3x + 1). We determine that we must adjust by a factor of 1/3.
Now we can record our ﬁnal answer as

sin(3x + 1) dx = −1
3 cos(3x + 1) + C.
We invite the reader to verify that the derivative of the answer on the right-hand
side gives sin(3x + 1).
EXAMPLE 4.2
Calculate

x
x2 + 3 dx.
SOLUTION
We notice that the numerator of the fraction is nearly the derivative of the
denominator. Put in other words, if we were asked to integrate
2x
x2 + 3

CHAPTER 4
The Integral
102
then we would see that we are integrating an expression of the form
ϕ′(x)
ϕ(x)
(which we in fact encountered among our differentiation rules in Section 2.5).
As we know, expressions like this arise from differentiating log ϕ(x).
Returning to the original problem, we pose our initial guess as log[x2 + 3].
Differentiation of this expression gives the answer 2x/[x2 + 3]. This is close
to what we want, but we must adjust by a factor of 1/2. We write our ﬁnal
answer as

x
x2 + 3 dx = 1
2 log[x2 + 3] + C.


xe3x2+5 dx.
EXAMPLE 4.3
Calculate the indeﬁnite integral

(x3 + x2 + 1)50 · (6x2 + 4x) dx.
SOLUTION
We observe that the expression 6x2 + 4x is nearly the derivative of x3 +
x2 + 1. In fact if we set ϕ(x) = x3 + x2 + 1 then the integrand (the quantity
that we are asked to integrate) is
[ϕ(x)]50 · 2ϕ′(x).
It is natural to guess as our antiderivative [ϕ(x)]51. Checking our work, we
ﬁnd that
([ϕ(x)]51)′ = 51[ϕ(x)]50 · ϕ′(x).
We see that the answer obtained is quite close to the answer we seek; it is off by
a numerical factor of 2/51. With this knowledge, we write our ﬁnal answer as

(x3 + x2 + 1)50 · (6x2 + 4x) dx = 2

Area
Consider the curve shown in Fig. 4.1. The curve is the graph of y = f (x). We set
for ourselves the task of calculating the area A that is (i) under the curve, (ii) above
the x-axis, and (iii) between x = a and x = b. Refer to Fig. 4.2 to see the geometric
region we are considering.
y = f (x)
Fig. 4.1

y = f (x)
Fig. 4.2
We take it for granted that the area of a rectangle of length ℓand width w is
ℓ×w. Now our strategy is to divide the base interval [a, b] into equal subintervals.
Fix an integer k > 0. We designate the points
P = {x0, x1, x2, . . . , xk},
with x0 = a and xk = b. We require that |xj −xj−1| = |b −a|/k ≡△x for
j = 1, . . . , k. In other words, the points x0, x1, . . . , xk are equally spaced. We call

CHAPTER 4
The Integral
104
the set P a partition. Sometimes, to be more speciﬁc, we call it a uniform partition
(to indicate that all the subintervals have the same length). Refer to Fig. 4.3.
b _ a
k
x0 = a
xj
xk = b
Fig. 4.3
The idea is to build an approximation to the area A by erecting rectangles over
the segments determined by the partition. The ﬁrst rectangle R1 will have as base
the interval [x0, x1] and height chosen so that the rectangle touches the curve at its
upper right hand corner; this means that the height of the rectangle is f (x1). The
second rectangle R2 has as base the interval [x1, x2] and height f (x2). Refer to
Fig. 4.4.
x0 = a
xk = b
x1 x2
y = f (x)
Fig. 4.4
Continuing in this manner, we construct precisely k rectangles, R1, R2, . . . , Rk,
as shown in Fig. 4.5. Now the sum of the areas of these rectangles is not exactly
equal to the area A that we seek. But it is close. The error is the sum of the little
semi-triangular pieces that are shaded in Fig. 4.6. We can make that error as small
as we please by making the partition ﬁner. Figure 4.7 illustrates this idea.
Let us denote by R(f, P) the sum of the areas of the rectangles that we created
from the partition P. This is called a Riemann sum. Thus
R(f, P) =
k

j=1
f (xj) · △x ≡f (x1) · △x + f (x2) · △x + · · · + f (xk) · △x.
Here the symbol k

the instances j = 1 to j = k.

The reasoning just presented suggests that the true area A is given by

We call this limit the integral of f from x = a to x = b and we write it as

a
f (x) dx.

CHAPTER 4
The Integral
106
Thus we have learned that
area A =
 b
a
f (x) dx.
It is well to take a moment and comment on the integral notation. First, the
integral sign

is an elongated “S,” coming from “summation.” The dx is an historical artifact,
coming partly from traditional methods of developing the integral, and partly from
a need to know explicitly what the variable is. The numbers a and b are called the
limits of integration—the number a is the lower limit and b is the upper limit. The
function f is called the integrand.
Before we can present a detailed example, we need to record some important
information about sums:
I.
We need to calculate the sum S = 1 + 2 + · · · + N = N
j=1 j. To achieve this
goal, we write
S = 1 + 2
+ · · · + (N −1) + N
S = N + (N −1) + · · · + 2
+ 1
Adding each column, we obtain
2S = (N + 1) + (N + 1) + · · · + (N + 1) + (N + 1)


N times

Thus
2S = N · (N + 1)
or
S = N · (N + 1)

.
This is a famous formula that was discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855)
when he was a child.
II.
The sum S = 12 + 22 + · · · + N2 = n
j=1 j2 is given by
S = 2N3 + 3N2 + N

We shall not provide the details of the proof of this formula, but refer the interested

Refer to Fig. 4.8 as we reason along. Let f (x) = x2.

We conclude that the desired area is 8/3.
You Try It:
Use the method presented in the last example to calculate the area
under the graph of y = 2x and above the x-axis, between x = 1 and x = 2. You
should obtain the answer 3, which of course can also be determined by elementary
considerations—without taking limits.
The most important idea in all of calculus is that it is possible to calculate an
integral without calculating Riemann sums and passing to the limit. This is the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, due to Leibniz and Newton. We now state the
theorem, illustrate it with examples, and then brieﬂy discuss why it is true.

Math Note:
Observe in this last example, in fact in all of our examples, you can
use any antiderivative of the integrand when you apply the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus. In the last example, we could have taken F(x) = ex −(1/2) sin 2x +
x4/4−2x2 +5 and the same answer would have resulted. We invite you to provide
the details of this assertion.
Justiﬁcation for the Fundamental Theorem
Let f be a continuous function on
the interval [a, b]. Deﬁne the area function F by
F(x) = area under f , above the x-axis, and between 0 and x.
Fig. 4.9
Let us use a pictorial method to calculate the derivative of F. Refer to Fig. 4.9
as you read on. Now
F(x + h) −F(x)
h
= [area between x and x + h, below f ]
h
≈f (x) · h
h
= f (x).
As h →0, the approximation in the last display becomes nearer and nearer to
equality. So we ﬁnd that
lim
h→0
F(x + h) −F(x)
h
= f (x).
But this just says that F ′(x) = f (x).
What is the practical signiﬁcance of this calculation? Suppose that we wish to
calculate the area under the curve f , above the x-axis, and between x = a and
x = b. Obviously this area is F(b) −F(a). See Fig. 4.10. But we also know that

CHAPTER 4
The Integral

that area is
 b
a f (x) dx. We conclude therefore that
 b
a
f (x) dx = F(b) −F(a).

y = f(x)
F(b) _ F(a)
Fig. 4.10
Finally, if G is any other antiderivative for f then G(x) = F(x) + C. Hence
G(b) −G(a) = [F(b) + C] −[F(a) + C] = F(b) −F(a) =
 b
a
f (x) dx.
That is the content of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
You Try It:
Calculate the area below the curve y = −x2 + 2x + 4 and above the
x-axis.
4.3
Signed Area
Without saying so explicitly, we have implicitly assumed in our discussion of area in
the last section that our function f is positive, that is its graph lies about the x-axis.
But of course many functions do not share that property. We nevertheless would
like to be able to calculate areas determined by such functions, and to calculate the
corresponding integrals.
This turns out to be simple to do. Consider the function y = f (x) shown in
Fig. 4.11. It is negative on the interval [a, b] and positive on the interval [b, c].

CHAPTER 4
The Integral
112
Suppose that we wish to calculate the shaded area as in Fig. 4.12. We can do so by
breaking the problem into pieces.
Fig. 4.11
Fig. 4.12
Of course, because f ≥0, the area between x = b and x = c is given by the
integral
 c
b f (x) dx,justaswehavediscussedinthelastsection.Butourdiscussions
do not apply directly to the area between x = a and x = b. What we can do is
instead consider the function g = −f . Its graph is shown in Fig. 4.13. Of course
g is a positive function on [a, b], except at the endpoints a and b; and the area
under g—between x = a and x = b—is just the same as the shaded area between

CHAPTER 4

x = a and x = b in Fig. 4.14. That area is

[a, c], is

 c

CHAPTER 4
The Integral
114
Fig. 4.15
What we have learned is this: If f (x) < 0 on the interval under discussion, then
the integral of f will be a negative number. If we want to calculate positive area
then we must interject a minus sign.
Let us nail down our understanding of these ideas by considering some examples.
EXAMPLE 4.8
Calculate the (positive) area, between the graph of f (x) = x3 −2x2 −
11x + 12 and the x-axis, between x = −3 and x = 4.
SOLUTION
Consider Fig. 4.16. It was drawn using the technique of Section 3.1, and it
plainly shows that f is positive on [−3, 1] and negative on [1, 4]. From the
Fig. 4.16

Notice that, by design, each component of the area has made a positive
contribution to the ﬁnal answer. The total area is then

EXAMPLE 4.9
Calculate the (positive) area between f (x) = sin x and the x-axis for
−2π ≤x ≤2π.
SOLUTION
We observe that f (x) = sin x ≥0 for −2π ≤x ≤−π and 0 ≤x ≤π.

negative area as negative. Our calculation shows that the aggregate area is positive.

4.4
The Area Between Two Curves
Frequently it is useful to ﬁnd the area between two curves. See Fig. 4.17. Following
the model that we have set up earlier, we ﬁrst note that the intersected region has
left endpoint at x = a and right endpoint at x = b. We partition the interval [a, b]
as shown in Fig. 4.18. Call the partition
P = {x0, x1, . . . , xk}.

CHAPTER 4
The Integral
117
Fig. 4.17
Fig. 4.18
Then, as usual, we erect rectangles over the intervals determined by the partition
(Fig. 4.19).
Notice that the upper curve, over the interval [a, b], is y = f (x) and the lower
curve is y = g(x) (Fig. 4.17). The sum of the areas of the rectangles is therefore
k

j=1
[f (xj) −g(x)] · △x.
But of course this is a Riemann sum for the integral
 b

[f (x) −g(x)] dx.

CHAPTER 4

We declare this integral to be the area determined by the two curves.
EXAMPLE 4.11
Find the area between the curves y = x2 −2 and y = −(x −1)2 + 3.
SOLUTION
We set the two equations equal and solve to ﬁnd that the curves intersect
at x = −1 and x = 2. The situation is shown in Fig. 4.20. Notice that y =
−(x −1)2 + 3 is the upper curve and y = x2 −2 is the lower curve. Thus the
desired area is

INTRODUCTION
Consider the limit
lim
x→c
f (x)
g(x) .
(∗)
If limx→cf (x) exists and limx→cg(x) exists and is not zero then the limit
(∗) is straightforward to evaluate. However, as we saw in Theorem 2.3, when
limx→cg(x)
=
0 then the situation is more complicated (especially when
limx→cf (x) = 0 as well).
For example, if f (x) = sin x and g(x) = x then the limit of the quotient as
x →0 exists and equals 1. However if f (x) = x and g(x) = x2 then the limit of
the quotient as x →0 does not exist.
In this section we learn a rule for evaluating indeterminate forms of the type (∗)
wheneitherlimx→c f (x) = limx→c g(x) = 0orlimx→c f (x) = limx→c g(x) = ∞.
Such limits, or “forms,” are considered indeterminate because the limit of the quo-
tient might actually exist and be ﬁnite or might not exist; one cannot analyze such
a form by elementary means.

5.1.2
L’HÔPITAL’S RULE
Theorem 5.1 (l’Hôpital’s Rule)
Let f (x) and g(x) be differentiable functions on (a, c) ∪(c, b). If
lim
x→c f (x) = lim
x→c g(x) = 0
then
lim
x→c
f (x)
g(x) = lim
x→c
f ′(x)
g′(x) ,
provided this last limit exists as a ﬁnite or inﬁnite limit.
Let us learn how to use this new result.
EXAMPLE 5.1
Evaluate
lim
x→1
ln x
x2 + x −2 .
SOLUTION
We ﬁrst notice that both the numerator and denominator have limit zero
as x tends to 1. Thus the quotient is indeterminate at 1 and of the form 0/0.
l’Hôpital’s Rule therefore applies and the limit equals
lim
x→1
(d/dx)(ln x)
(d/dx)(x2 + x −2),
provided this last limit exists. The last limit is
lim
x→1
1/x
2x + 1 = lim
x→1
1
2x2 + x .
Therefore we see that
lim
x→1
ln x
x2 + x −2 = 1
3.

You Try It:
Usel’Hôpital’sRuletoevaluatelimh→0(sin h/h)andlimh→0(cos h−

EXAMPLE 5.2
Evaluate the limit
lim
x→0
x3
x −sin x .

CHAPTER 5
Indeterminate Forms
125
SOLUTION
As x →0 both numerator and denominator tend to zero, so the quotient is
indeterminate at 0 of the form 0/0. Thus l’Hôpital’s Rule applies. Our limit
equals
lim
x→0
(d/dx)x3
(d/dx)(x −sin x),
provided that this last limit exists. It equals
lim
x→0
3x2
1 −cos x .
This is another indeterminate form. So we must again apply l’Hôpital’s Rule.
The result is
lim
x→0
6x
sin x .
This is again indeterminate; another application of l’Hôpital’s Rule gives us
ﬁnally
lim
x→0
6
cos x = 6.
We conclude that the original limit equals 6.
You Try It:
Apply l’Hôpital’s Rule to the limit limx→0 x/[1/ ln |x|].
Indeterminate Forms Involving ∞
We handle indeterminate forms involv-
ing inﬁnity as follows: Let f (x) and g(x) be differentiable functions on (a, c) ∪
(c, b). If
lim
x→c f (x) and lim
x→c g(x)
both exist and equal +∞or −∞(they may have the same sign or different signs)
then
lim
x→c
f (x)
g(x) = lim
x→c
f ′(x)
g′(x) ,
provided this last limit exists either as a ﬁnite or inﬁnite limit.
Let us look at some examples.
EXAMPLE 5.3
Evaluate the limit
lim
x→0 x3 · ln |x|.

CHAPTER 5
Indeterminate Forms
126
SOLUTION
This may be rewritten as
lim
x→0
ln |x|
1/x3 .
Notice that the numerator tends to −∞and the denominator tends to ±∞as
x →0. Thus the quotient is indeterminate at 0 of the form −∞/ + ∞. So we
may apply l’Hôpital’s Rule for inﬁnite limits to see that the limit equals
lim
x→0
1/x
−3x−4 = lim
x→0 −x3/3 = 0.
Yet another version of l’Hôpital’s Rule, this time for unbounded intervals, is
this: Let f and g be differentiable functions on an interval of the form [A, +∞).
If limx→+∞f (x) = limx→+∞g(x) = 0 or if limx→+∞f (x) = ±∞and
limx→+∞g(x) = ±∞, then
lim
x→+∞
f (x)
g(x) =
lim
x→+∞
f ′(x)
g′(x)
provided that this last limit exists either as a ﬁnite or inﬁnite limit. The same result
holds for f and g deﬁned on an interval of the form (−∞, B] and for the limit as
x →−∞.
EXAMPLE 5.4
Evaluate
lim
x→+∞
x4
ex .
SOLUTION
We ﬁrst notice that both the numerator and the denominator tend to +∞as
x →+∞. Thus the quotient is indeterminate at +∞of the form +∞/ + ∞.
Therefore the new version of l’Hôpital’s Rule applies and our limit equals
lim
x→+∞
4x3
ex .
Again the numerator and denominator tend to +∞as x →+∞, so we once
more apply l’Hôpital’s Rule. The limit equals
lim
x→+∞
12x2
ex
= 0.
We must apply l’Hôpital’s Rule two more times. We ﬁrst obtain
lim
x→+∞

You Try It:

EXAMPLE 5.5
Evaluate the limit
lim
x→−∞
sin(2/x)
sin(5/x) .
SOLUTION
We note that both numerator and denominator tend to 0, so the quotient is
indeterminate at −∞of the form 0/0. We may therefore apply l’Hôpital’s Rule.
Our limit equals
lim
x→−∞
(−2/x2) cos(2/x)
(−5/x2) cos(5/x).
This in turn simpliﬁes to
lim
x→−∞
2 cos(2/x)
5 cos(5/x) = 2
5.
l’Hôpital’s Rule also applies to one-sided limits. Here is an example.
EXAMPLE 5.6
Evaluate the limit
lim
x→0+
sin √x
√x
.
SOLUTION
Both numerator and denominator tend to zero so the quotient is indeterminate
at 0 of the form 0/0. We may apply l’Hôpital’s Rule; differentiating numerator
and denominator, we ﬁnd that the limit equals
lim
x→0+
[cos √x] · (1/2)x−1/2
(1/2)x−1/2
= lim
x→0+ cos √x

Other Indeterminate Forms
5.2.1
INTRODUCTION
By using some algebraic manipulations, we can reduce a variety of indeterminate
limits to expressions which can be treated by l’Hôpital’s Rule. We explore some of
these techniques in this section.
5.2.2
WRITING A PRODUCT AS A QUOTIENT
The technique of the ﬁrst example is a simple one, but it is used frequently.
EXAMPLE 5.7
Evaluate the limit
lim
x→−∞x2 · e3x.
SOLUTION
Notice that x2 →+∞while e3x →0. So the limit is indeterminate of the
form 0 · ∞. We rewrite the limit as
lim
x→−∞
x2
e−3x .
Now both numerator and denominator tend to inﬁnity and we may apply
l’Hôpital’s Rule. The result is that the limit equals
lim
x→−∞
2x
−3e−3x .
Again the numerator and denominator both tend to inﬁnity so we apply
l’Hôpital’s Rule to obtain:
lim
x→−∞
2
9e−3x .
It is clear that the limit of this last expression is zero. We conclude that
lim
x→−∞x · e3x = 0.
You Try It:
Evaluate the limit limx→+∞e−√x · x.
5.2.3
THE USE OF THE LOGARITHM
The natural logarithm can be used to reduce an expression involving exponentials
to one involving a product or a quotient.

CHAPTER 5

EXAMPLE 5.8
Evaluate the limit
lim
x→0+ xx.
SOLUTION
We study the limit of f (x) = xx by considering ln f (x) = x · ln x. We
rewrite this as
lim
x→0+ ln f (x) = lim
x→0+
ln x
1/x .
Both numerator and denominator tend to ±∞, so the quotient is indeterminate
of the form −∞/∞. Thus l’Hôpital’s Rule applies. The limit equals
lim
x→0+
1/x
−1/x2 = lim
x→0+ −x = 0.
Now the only way that ln f (x) can tend to zero is if f (x) = xx tends to 1. We
conclude that
lim
x→0+ xx = 1.
EXAMPLE 5.9
Evaluate the limit
lim
x→0(1 + x2)ln |x|.
SOLUTION
Let f (x) = (1 + x2)ln |x| and consider ln f (x) = ln |x| · ln(1 + x2). This
expression is indeterminate of the form −∞· 0.
We rewrite it as
lim
x→0
ln(1 + x2)
1/ ln |x| ,
so that both the numerator and denominator tend to 0. So l’Hôpital’s Rule
applies and we have
lim
x→0 ln f (x) = lim
x→0
2x/(1 + x2)
−1/[x ln2(|x|)]
= lim

The numerator tends to 0 (see Example 5.3) and the denominator tends to 1.

PUTTING TERMS OVER A COMMON
DENOMINATOR
Many times a simple algebraic manipulation involving fractions will put a limit
into a form which can be studied using l’Hôpital’s Rule.
EXAMPLE 5.10

.
SOLUTION
We put the fractions over a common denominator to rewrite our limit as
lim
x→0
3x −sin 3x
3x · sin 3x

.
Both numerator and denominator vanish as x →0. Thus the quotient has
indeterminate form 0/0. By l’Hôpital’s Rule, the limit is therefore equal to
lim
x→0
3 −3 cos 3x
3 sin 3x + 9x cos 3x .
This quotient is still indeterminate; we apply l’Hôpital’s Rule again to obtain
lim
x→0
9 sin 3x
18 cos 3x −27x sin 3x = 0.

lim

4x(e4x −1) .
Notice that the numerator and denominator both tend to zero as x →0, so this
is indeterminate of the form 0/0. Therefore l’Hôpital’s Rule applies and our
limit equals
lim
x→0
4e4x −4
4e4x(1 + 4x) −4.
Again the numerator and denominator tend to zero and we apply l’Hôpital’s

OTHER ALGEBRAIC MANIPULATIONS
Sometimes a factorization helps to clarify a subtle limit:
EXAMPLE 5.12
Evaluate the limit
lim
x→+∞

x2 −(x4 + 4x2 + 5)1/2 
.
SOLUTION
The limit as written is of the form ∞−∞. We rewrite it as

=
lim
x→+∞
1 −(1 + 4x−2 + 5x−4)1/2
x−2
.
Notice that both the numerator and denominator tend to zero, so it is now
indeterminate of the form 0/0. We may thus apply l’Hôpital’s Rule. The result
is that the limit equals
lim
x→+∞
(−1/2)(1 + 4x−2 + 5x−4)−1/2 · (−8x−3 −20x−5)
−2x−3
=
lim
x→+∞−(1 + 4x−2 + 5x−4)−1/2 · (2 + 5x−2).

CHAPTER 5

Since this last limit is −2, we conclude that
lim

x2 −(x4 + 4x2 + 5)1/2

ex
.
Notice that both the numerator and denominator tend to zero (here we use the
result analogous to Example 5.7 that x4e3x →0). So our new expression is
indeterminate of the form 0/0. l’Hôpital’s Rule applies and our limit equals
lim
x→−∞
−(1/3)(1 −x4e3x)−2/3 · (−4x3 · e3x −x4 · 3e3x)
ex
=
lim
x→−∞(1/3)(1 −x4e3x)−2/3(4x3 · e2x + 3x4 · e2x).
Just as in Example 5.7, x4·e3xx3·e2x, and x4·e2x all tend to zero. We conclude
that our limit equals 0.

Improper Integrals: A First Look
5.3.1
INTRODUCTION
The theory of the integral that we learned earlier enables us to integrate a continuous
function f (x) on a closed, bounded interval [a, b]. See Fig. 5.1. However, it is
frequently convenient to be able to integrate an unbounded function, or a function
deﬁned on an unbounded interval. In this section and the next we learn to do so, and
we see some applications of this new technique. The basic idea is that the integral
of an unbounded function is the limit of integrals of bounded functions; likewise,
the integral of a function on an unbounded interval is the limit of the integral on
bounded intervals.

INTEGRALS WITH INFINITE INTEGRANDS
Let f be a continuous function on the interval [a, b) which is unbounded as
x →b−(see Fig. 5.2). The integral
 b
a
f (x) dx
Fig. 5.2
is then called an improper integral with inﬁnite integrand at b. We often just say
“improper integral” because the source of the improperness will usually be clear
from context. The next deﬁnition tells us how such an integral is evaluated.
If
 b
a
f (x) dx
is an improper integral with inﬁnite integrand at b then the value of the integral is
deﬁned to be
lim
ϵ→0+
 b−ϵ

provided that this limit exists. See Fig. 5.3.

4(8 −x)−1/3 dx,
provided the limit exists. Since the integrand is continuous on the interval

Improper integrals with integrand which is inﬁnite at the left endpoint of
integration are handled in a manner similar to the right endpoint case:
EXAMPLE 5.16
Evaluate the integral

provided that this limit exists.
Since 1/(x ln2 x) is continuous on the interval [ϵ, 1/2] for ϵ > 0, this last
integral can be evaluated directly and will have a ﬁnite real value. For clarity,
write ϕ(x) = ln x, ϕ′(x) = 1/x. Then the (indeﬁnite) integral becomes

ϕ′(x)
ϕ2(x) dx.
Clearly the antiderivative is −1/ϕ(x). Thus we see that

Now as ϵ →0+ we have ln ϵ →−∞hence 1/ ln ϵ →0. We conclude that
the improper integral converges to 1/ ln 2.
You Try It:

Many times the integrand has a singularity in the middle of the interval of inte-

which the integrand is inﬁnite at one endpoint, and evaluate each piece separately.
EXAMPLE 5.17

It is dangerous to try to save work by not dividing the integral at the singularity.

A glance at Fig. 5.4 shows that something is wrong. The function x−4 is
positive hence its integral should be positive too. However, since we used
an incorrect method, we got a negative answer.
Fig. 5.4
In fact each of the integrals in line (∗) diverges, so by deﬁnition the improper

diverges.

CHAPTER 5

EXAMPLE 5.19
Analyze the integral
 1

1
x(1 −x)1/2 dx.
SOLUTION
The key idea is that we can only handle one singularity at a time. This
integrand is singular at both endpoints 0 and 1. Therefore we divide the domain
of integration somewhere in the middle—at 1/2 say (it does not really matter
where we divide)—and treat the two singularities separately.
First we treat the integral
 1/2
0
1
x(1 −x)1/2 dx.
Since the integrand has a singularity at 0, we consider
lim
ϵ→0+
 1/2

1
x(1 −x)1/2 dx.
This is a tricky integral to evaluate directly. But notice that

We evaluate the integral: it equals ln(1/2) −ln ϵ. Finally,

The ﬁrst of our integrals therefore diverges.

AN APPLICATION TO AREA
Suppose that f is a non-negative, continuous function on the interval (a, b] which
is unbounded as x →a+. Look at Fig. 5.5. Let us consider the area under the graph
of f and above the x-axis over the interval (a, b]. The area of the part of the region
over the interval [a + ϵ, b], ϵ > 0, is
 b
a+ϵ
f (x) dx.
Fig. 5.5
Therefore it is natural to consider the area of the entire region, over the interval
(a, b], to be

This is just the improper integral

becomes

ϕ4/3(x) dx = −

equals 3/[ln 2]1/3.

INTRODUCTION
Suppose that we want to calculate the integral of a continuous function f (x) over
an unbounded interval of the form [A, +∞) or (−∞, B]. The theory of the integral
that we learned earlier does not cover this situation, and some new concepts are
needed. We treat improper integrals on inﬁnite intervals in this section, and give
some applications at the end.

The interval of integration is (−∞, +∞). To evaluate this integral, we break
the interval up into two pieces:

(The choice of zero as a place to break the interval is not important; any
other point would do in this example.) Thus we will evaluate separately the

EXAMPLE 5.25
Because of inﬂation, the value of a dollar decreases as time goes on.Indeed,
this decrease in the value of money is directly related to the continuous
compounding of interest. For if one dollar today is invested at 6% contin-
uously compounded interest for ten years then that dollar will have grown
to e0.06·10 = $1.82 (see Section 6.5 for more detail on this matter). This
means that a dollar in the currency of ten years from now corresponds to
only e−0.06·10 = $0.55 in today’s currency.
Now suppose that a trust is established in your name which pays 2t +50
dollars per year for every year in perpetuity, where t is time measured in
years (here the present corresponds to time t = 0). Assume a constant
interest rate of 6%, and that all interest is re-invested. What is the total
value, in today’s dollars, of all the money that will ever be earned by your
trust account?
SOLUTION
Over a short time increment [tj−1, tj], the value in today’s currency of the
money earned is about
(2tj + 50) ·

e−0.06·tj 
· 8tj.
The corresponding sum over time increments is

j
(2tj + 50) · e−0.06·tj 8tj.
This in turn is a Riemann sum for the integral

(2t + 50)e−0.06t dt.
If we want to calculate the value in today’s dollars of all the money earned from
now on, in perpetuity, this would be the value of the improper integral
 +∞
0
(2t + 50)e−0.06t dt.
This value is easily calculated to be $1388.89, rounded to the nearest cent.
You Try It:
A trust is established in your name which pays t +10 dollars per year
for every year in perpetuity, where t is time measured in years (here the present

account?

Introductory Remarks
There are two types of functions: polynomial and transcendental. A polynomial
of degree k is a function of the form p(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · · + akxk.
Such a polynomial has precisely k roots, and there are algorithms that enable us to
solve for those roots. For most purposes, polynomials are the most accessible and
easy-to-understand functions. But there are other functions that are important in
mathematics and physics. These are the transcendental functions.Among this more
sophisticated type of functions are sine, cosine, the other trigonometric functions,
and also the logarithm and the exponential. The present chapter is devoted to the
study of transcendental functions.
6.1
Logarithm Basics
A convenient, intuitive way to think about the logarithm function is as the inverse
to the exponentiation function. Proceeding intuitively, let us consider the function
f (x) = 3x.
To operate with this f, we choose an x and take 3 to the power x. For example,
f (4) = 34 = 3 · 3 · 3 · 3 = 81

f (−2) = 3−2 = 1
9
f (0) = 30 = 1.
The inverse of the function f is the function g which assigns to x the power to
which you need to raise 3 to obtain x. For instance,
g(9) = 2
because f (2) = 9
g(1/27) = −3
because f (−3) = 1/27
g(1) = 0
because f (0) = 1.
We usually call the function g the “logarithm to the base 3” and we write g(x) =
log3 x. Logarithms to other bases are deﬁned similarly.
While this approach to logarithms has heuristic appeal, it has many drawbacks:
we do not really know what 3x means when x is not a rational number; we have
no way to determine the derivative of f or of g; we have no way to determine the
integral of f or of g. Because of these difﬁculties, we are going to use an entirely
new method for studying logarithms. It turns out to be equivalent to the intuitive
method described above, and leads rapidly to the calculus results that we need.
6.1.1
A NEW APPROACH TO LOGARITHMS
When you studied logarithms in the past you learned the formula
log(x · y) = log x + log y;
this says that logs convert multiplication to addition. It turns out that this property
alone uniquely determines the logarithm function.
Let ℓ(x) be a differentiable function with domain the positive real numbers
and whose derivative function ℓ′(x) is continuous. Assume that ℓsatisﬁes the
multiplicative law
ℓ(x · y) = ℓ(x) + ℓ(y)
(∗)
for all positive x and y. Then it must be that ℓ(1) = 0 and there is a constant C
such that
ℓ′(x) = C
x .
In other words
ℓ(x) =
 x
1
C
t dt.
A function ℓ(x) that satisﬁes these properties is called a logarithm function.
The particular logarithm function which satisﬁes ℓ′(1) = 1 is called the natural

logarithm: In other words,
natural logarithm = ln x =
 x

t dt.
For 0 < x < 1 the value of ln x is the negative of the actual area between the
graph and the x-axis. This is so because the limits of integration, x and 1, occur in
reverse order: ln x =
 x
1 (1/t) dt with x < 1.
Fig. 6.1
Notice the following simple properties of ln x which can be determined from
looking at Fig. 6.1:
(i)
When x > 1, ln x > 0 (after all, ln x is an area).
(ii)
When x = 1, ln x = 0.
(iii)
When 0 < x < 1, ln x < 0

since

t dt = −

.
(iv)
If 0 < x1 < x2 then ln x1 < ln x2.
We already know that the logarithm satisﬁes the multiplicative property. By
applying this property repeatedly, we obtain that: If x > 0 and n is any integer then
ln(xn) = n · ln x.
A companion result is the division rule: If a and b are positive numbers then
ln
a

= ln a −ln b.
EXAMPLE 6.1
Simplify the expression
A = ln

CHAPTER 6

150
SOLUTION
We can write A in simpler terms by using the multiplicative and quotient
properties:
A = ln(a3 · b2) −ln(c−4 · d)
= [ln a3 + ln(b2)] −[ln(c−4) + ln d]
= [3 ln a + 2 · ln b] −[(−4) · ln c + ln d]
= 3 ln a + 2 · ln b + 4 · ln c −ln d.
The last basic property of the logarithm is the reciprocal law: For any x > 0
we have
ln(1/x) = −ln x.
EXAMPLE 6.2
Express ln(1/7) in terms of ln 7. Express ln(9/5) in terms of ln 3 and ln 5.
SOLUTION
We calculate that
ln(1/7) = −ln 7,
ln(9/5) = ln 9 −ln 5 = ln 32 −ln 5 = 2 ln 3 −ln 5.
You Try It:
Simplify ln(a2b−3/c5).
6.1.2
THE LOGARITHM FUNCTION AND THE
DERIVATIVE
Now you will see why our new deﬁnition of logarithm is so convenient. If we want
to differentiate the logarithm function we can apply the Fundamental Theorem of

(iii)
ln(1) = 0,
we know that ln x is an increasing, concave down function whose graph passes
through (1, 0). There are no relative maxima or minima (since the derivative is
never 0). Certainly ln .9 < 0; the formula ln(.9n) = n ln .9 therefore tells us that
ln x is negative without bound as x →0+. Since ln x = −ln(1/x), we may also
conclude that ln x is positive without bound as x →+∞. A sketch of the graph of
y = ln x appears in Fig. 6.2.
We learned in the last paragraph that the function ln x takes negative values which
are arbitrarily large in absolute value when x is small and positive. In particular,
the negative y axis is a vertical asymptote. Since ln(1/x) = −ln x, we then ﬁnd
that ln x takes arbitrarily large positive values when x is large and positive. The
graph exhibits these features.
Since we have only deﬁned the function ln x when x > 0, the graph is only
sketched in Fig. 6.2 to the right of the y-axis. However it certainly makes sense to

6.2
Exponential Basics
Examine Fig. 6.4, which shows the graph of the function
f (x) = ln x,
x > 0.
Fig. 6.4
As we observed in Section 1, the function f takes on all real values. We already
have noticed that, since
d
dx ln x = 1
x > 0,
the function ln x is increasing. As a result,
ln : {x : x > 0} →R
is one-to-one and onto. Hence the natural logarithm function has an inverse.

CHAPTER 6
Transcendental Functions
155
The inverse function to the natural logarithm function is called the exponential
function and is written exp(x). The domain of exp is the entire real line. The range
is the set of positive real numbers.
EXAMPLE 6.7
Using the deﬁnition of the exponential function, simplify the expressions
exp(ln a + ln b)
and
ln(7 · [exp(c)]).
SOLUTION
We use the key property that the exponential function is the inverse of the
logarithm function. We have
exp(ln a + ln b) = exp(ln(a · b)) = a · b,
ln(7 · [exp(c)]) = ln 7 + ln(exp(c)) = ln 7 + c.
You Try It:
Simplify the expression ln(a3 · 35 · 5−4).
6.2.1
FACTS ABOUT THE EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION
First review the properties of inverse functions that we learned in Subsection 1.8.5.
The graph of exp(x) is obtained by reﬂecting the graph of ln x in the line y = x.
We exhibit the graph of y = exp(x) in Fig. 6.5.
Fig. 6.5
We see, from inspection of this ﬁgure, that exp(x) is increasing and is concave
up. Since ln(1) = 0 we may conclude that exp(0) = 1. Next we turn to some of
the algebraic properties of the exponential function.

CHAPTER 6
Transcendental Functions
156
For all real numbers a and b we have
(a)
exp(a + b) = [exp(a)] · [exp(b)].
(b)
For any a and b we have exp(a −b) = exp(a)
exp(b).
These properties are veriﬁed just by exploiting the fact that the exponential is
the inverse of the logarithm, as we saw in Example 6.7.
EXAMPLE 6.8
Use the basic properties to simplify the expression
[exp(a)]2 · [exp(b)]3
[exp(c)]4
.
SOLUTION
We calculate that
[exp(a)]2 · [exp(b)]3
[exp(c)]4
= [exp(a)] · [exp(a)] · [exp(b)] · [exp(b)] · [exp(b)]
[exp(c)] · [exp(c)] · [exp(c)] · [exp(c)]
= exp(a + a + b + b + b)
exp(c + c + c + c)
= exp(a + a + b + b + b −c −c −c −c)
= exp(2a + 3b −4c).
You Try It:
Simplify the expression (exp a)−3 · (exp b)2/ exp(5c).
6.2.2
CALCULUS PROPERTIES OF THE EXPONENTIAL
Now we want to learn some “calculus properties” of our new function exp(x).
These are derived from the standard formula for the derivative of an inverse, as in
Section 2.5.1.
For all x we have
d
dx (exp(x)) = exp(x).
In other words,

exp(x) dx = exp(x).
More generally,
d

and

exp(u) du
dx dx = exp(u) + C.
We note for the record that the exponential function is the only function (up to
constant multiples) that is its own derivative. This fact will come up later in our
applications of the exponential
EXAMPLE 6.9
Compute the derivatives:
d
dx exp(4x),
d
dx(exp(cos x)),
d
dx([exp(x)] · [cot x]).
SOLUTION
For the ﬁrst problem, notice that u = 4x hence du/dx = 4. Therefore we
have
d
dx exp(4x) = [exp(4x)] · d
dx (4x) = 4 · exp(4x).

EXAMPLE 6.12
Evaluate the integral

6.2.3
THE NUMBER e
The number exp(1) is a special constant which arises in many mathematical and
physical contexts. It is denoted by the symbol e in honor of the Swiss mathematician
Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) who ﬁrst studied this constant. We next see how to
calculate the decimal expansion for the number e.
In fact, as can be proved in a more advanced course, Euler’s constant e satisﬁes
the identity

it can be determined that
e = 2.71828182846
to eleven place decimal accuracy. Like the number π, the number e is an irrational
number. Notice that, since exp(1) = e, we also know that ln e = 1.
EXAMPLE 6.13
Simplify the expression
ln(e5 · 8−3 ).
SOLUTION
We calculate that
ln(e5 · 8−3) = ln(e5) + ln(8−3)
= 5 ln(e) −3 ln 8
= 5 −3 ln 8.

CHAPTER 6

You Try It:
Use your calculator to compute log10 e and ln 10 = loge 10 (see
Example 6.20 below). Conﬁrm that these numbers are reciprocals of each other.
6.3
Exponentials with Arbitrary Bases
6.3.1
ARBITRARY POWERS
We know how to deﬁne integer powers of real numbers. For instance
64 = 6 · 6 · 6 · 6 = 1296
and
9−3 =
1
9 · 9 · 9 =
1
729.
But what does it mean to calculate
4π
or
πe?
You can calculate values for these numbers by punching suitable buttons on your
calculator, but that does not explain what the numbers mean or how the calcu-
lator was programmed to calculate them. We will use our understanding of the
exponential and logarithm functions to now deﬁne these exponential expressions.
If a > 0 and b is any real number then we deﬁne
ab = exp(b · ln a).
(∗)
To come to grips with this rather abstract formulation, we begin to examine some
properties of this new notion of exponentiation:
If a is a positive number and b is any real number then
(1)
ln(ab) = b · ln a.
In fact
ln(ab) = ln(exp(b · ln a)).
But ln and exp are inverse, so that the last expression simpliﬁes to b · ln a.
EXAMPLE 6.14
Let a > 0. Compare the new deﬁnition of a4 with the more elementary
deﬁnition of a4 in terms of multiplying a by itself four times.
SOLUTION
We ordinarily think of a4 as meaning
a · a · a · a.

CHAPTER 6
Transcendental Functions
161
According to our new deﬁnition of ab we have
a4 = exp(4 · ln a) = exp(ln a + ln a + ln a + ln a)
= exp(ln[a · a · a · a]) = a · a · a · a.
It is reassuring to see that our new deﬁnition of exponentiation is consistent
with the familiar notion for integer exponents.
EXAMPLE 6.15
Express exp(x) as a power of e.
SOLUTION
According to our deﬁnition,
ex = exp(x · ln(e)).
But we learned in the last section that ln(e) = 1. As a result,
ex = exp(x).
You Try It:
Simplify the expression ln[ex · xe].
Because of this last example we will not in the future write the exponential
function as exp(x) but will use the more common notation ex. Thus
exp(ln x) = x
becomes
eln x = x
ln(exp(x)) = x
becomes
ln(ex) = x
exp(a + b) = [exp(a)] · [exp(b)]
becomes
ea+b = eaeb
exp(a −b) = exp(a)
exp(b)
becomes
ea−b = ea
eb
ab = exp(b · ln a)
becomes
ab = eb·ln a.
EXAMPLE 6.16
Use our new deﬁnitions to simplify the expression
A = e[5·ln 2−3·ln 4] .
SOLUTION
We write
A = e[ln(25)−ln(43)] = eln 32−ln 64 = eln(32)
eln(64) = 32
64 = 1
2.
We next see that our new notion of exponentiation satisﬁes certain familiar rules.

6.3.2
LOGARITHMS WITH ARBITRARY BASES
If you review the ﬁrst few paragraphs of Section 1, you will ﬁnd an intuitively
appealing deﬁnition of the logarithm to the base 2:
log2 x is the power to which you need to raise 2 to obtain x.
With this intuitive notion we readily see that
log2 16 = “the power to which we raise 2 to obtain 16” = 4
and
log2(1/4) = “the power to which we raise 2 to obtain 1/4” = −2.
However this intuitive approach does not work so well if we want to take logπ 5
or log2
√
7. Therefore we will give a new deﬁnition of the logarithm to any base
a > 0 which in simple cases coincides with the intuitive notion of logarithm.
If a > 0 and b > 0 then
loga b = ln b
ln a .
EXAMPLE 6.19
Calculate log2 32.
SOLUTION
We see that
log2 32 = ln 32
ln 2 = ln 25
ln 2 = 5 · ln 2
ln 2
= 5.
Notice that, in this example, the new deﬁnition of log2 32 agrees with the
intuitive notion just discussed.
EXAMPLE 6.20
Express ln x as the logarithm to some base.
SOLUTION
If x > 0 then
loge x = ln x
ln e = ln x
1
= ln x.
Thus we see that the natural logarithm ln x is precisely the same as loge x.
Math Note:
In mathematics, it is common to write ln x rather than loge x.
You Try It:
Calculate log3 27 + log5(1/25) −log2 8.

CHAPTER 6

We will be able to do calculations much more easily if we learn some simple
properties of logarithms and exponentials.
If a > 0 and b > 0 then
a(loga b) = b.
If a > 0 and b ∈R is arbitrary then
loga(ab) = b.
If a > 0, b > 0, and c > 0 then
(i)
loga(b · c) = loga b + loga c

exponential operations.
EXAMPLE 6.21

log3(34)−5·log2(23)−3·lne4 = 4·log33−5·[3·log22]−3·[4·lne]

SOLUTION
We take the natural logarithm of both sides:

.
Applying the rules for logarithms we obtain
ln(5x) + ln(23x) = ln 4 −ln(7x)
or
x · ln 5 + 3x · ln 2 = ln 4 −x · ln 7.
Gathering together all the terms involving x yields
x · [ln 5 + 3 · ln 2 + ln 7] = ln 4
or
x · [ln(5 · 23 · 7)] = ln 4.
Solving for x gives
x =
ln 4
ln 280 = log280 4.
EXAMPLE 6.23
Simplify the expression
B = 5 · log7 3 −(1/4) · log7 16
3 · log7 5 + (1/5) · log7 32 .
SOLUTION
The numerator of B equals
log7(35) −log7(161/4) = log7 243 −log7 2 = log7(243/2).
Similarly, the denominator can be rewritten as
log7 53 + log7(321/5) = log7 125 + log7 2 = log7(125 · 2) = log7 250.
Putting these two results together, we ﬁnd that
B = log7 243/2
log7 250
= log250(243/2).

Since g(x) = ax is the inverse function to f (x) = loga x, the graph of g is the

Exponential Growth and Decay
Many processes of nature and many mathematical applications involve logarithmic
and exponential functions. For example, if we examine a population of bacteria,
we notice that the rate at which the population grows is proportional to the number
of bacteria present. To see that this makes good sense, suppose that a bacterium
reproduces itself every 4 hours. If we begin with 5 thousand bacteria then
after 4 hours
there are
10 thousand bacteria
after 8 hours
there are
20 thousand bacteria
after 12 hours there are
40 thousand bacteria
after 16 hours there are
80 thousand bacteria . . .
etc.
The point is that each new generation of bacteria also reproduces, and the older
generations reproduce as well.Asketch (Fig. 6.12) of the bacteria population against
time shows that the growth is certainly not linear—indeed the shape of the curve
appears to be of exponential form.
Fig. 6.12

CHAPTER 6
Transcendental Functions
173
Notice that when the number of bacteria is large, then different generations of
bacteria will be reproducing at different times. So, averaging out, it makes sense
to hypothesize that the growth of the bacteria population varies continuously as
in Fig. 6.13. Here we are using a standard device of mathematical analysis: even
though the number of bacteria is always an integer, we represent the graph of the
population of bacteria by a smooth curve. This enables us to apply the tools of
calculus to the problem.
Fig. 6.13
6.5.1
A DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
If B(t) represents the number of bacteria present in a given population at time t,
then the preceding discussion suggests that
dB
dt = K · B(t),
where K is a constant of proportionality. This equation expresses quantitatively
the assertion that the rate of change of B(t) (that is to say, the quantity dB/dt) is
proportional to B(t). To solve this equation, we rewrite it as
1
B(t) · dB
dt = K.
We integrate both sides with respect to the variable t:

1
B(t) · dB
dt dt =

K dt.
The left side is
ln |B(t)| + C
and the right side is
Kt + 
C,

CHAPTER 6
Transcendental Functions
174
where C and 
C are constants of integration. We thus obtain
ln |B(t)| = Kt + D,
where we have amalgamated the two constants into a single constant D. Exponen-
tiating both sides gives
|B(t)| = eKt+D
or
B(t) = eD · eKt = P · eKt.
(⋆)
Notice that we have omitted the absolute value signs since the number of bacteria is
always positive.Also we have renamed the constant eD with the simpler symbol P .
Equation (⋆) will be our key to solving exponential growth and decay problems.
We motivated our calculation by discussing bacteria, but in fact the calculation
applies to any function which grows at a rate proportional to the size of the function.
Next we turn to some examples.
6.5.2
BACTERIAL GROWTH
EXAMPLE 6.30
A population of bacteria tends to double every four hours. If there are 5000
bacteria at 9:00 a.m., then how many will there be at noon?
SOLUTION
To answer this question, let B(t) be the number of bacteria at time t. For con-
venience, let t = 0 correspond to 9:00 a.m. and suppose that time is measured
in hours. Thus noon corresponds to t = 3.
Equation (⋆) guarantees that
B(t) = P · eKt
for some undetermined constants P and K. We also know that
5000 = B(0) = P · eK·0 = P.
We see that P = 5000 and B(t) = 5000 · eKt. We still need to solve for K.
Since the population tends to double in four hours, there will be 10,000
bacteria at time t = 4; hence
10000 = B(4) = 5000 · eK·4.
We divide by 5000 to obtain
2 = eK·4.

CHAPTER 6
Transcendental Functions
175
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields
ln 2 = ln(eK·4) = 4K.
We conclude that K = [ln 2]/4. As a result,
B(t) = 5000 ·

e([ln 2]/4)t
.
We simplify this equation by noting that
e([ln 2]/4)t = (eln 2)t/4 = 2t/4.
In conclusion,
B(t) = 5000 · 2t/4.
The number of bacteria at noon (time t = 3) is then given by
B(3) = 5000 · 23/4 ≈8409.
It is important to realize that population growth problems cannot be described
using just arithmetic. Exponential growth is nonlinear, and advanced analytical
ideas (such as calculus) must be used to understand it.
EXAMPLE 6.31
Suppose that a certain petri dish contains 6000 bacteria at 9:00 p.m. and
10000 bacteria at 11:00 p.m. How many of the bacteria were there at
7:00 p.m.?
SOLUTION
We know that
B(t) = P · eKt.
The algebra is always simpler if we take one of the times in the initial data to
correspond to t = 0. So let us say that 9:00 p.m. is t = 0. Then 11:00 p.m. is
t = 2 and 7:00 p.m. is t = −2. The initial data then tell us that
6000 = P · eK·0
(∗)
10000 = P · eK·2.
(∗∗)
From equation (∗) we may immediately conclude that P = 6000. Substituting
this into (∗∗) gives
10000 = 6000 · (eK)2.
We conclude that
eK =

6.5.3
RADIOACTIVE DECAY
Another natural phenomenon which ﬁts into our theoretical framework is radio-
active decay. Radioactive material, such as C14 (radioactive carbon), has a half life.
Saying that the half life of a material is h years means that if A grams of material is
present at time t then A/2 grams will be present at time t + h. In other words, half
of the material decays every h years. But this is another way of saying that the rate
at which the radioactive material vanishes is proportional to the amount present.
So equation (⋆) will apply to problems about radioactive decay.
EXAMPLE 6.32
Five grams of a certain radioactive isotope decay to three grams in 100
years. After how many more years will there be just one gram?
SOLUTION
First note that the answer is not “we lose two grams every hundred years
so ….” The rate of decay depends on the amount of material present. That is
the key.
Instead, we let R(t) denote the amount of radioactive material at time t.
Equation (⋆) guarantees that R has the form
R(t) = P · eKt.
Letting t = 0 denote the time at which there are 5 grams of isotope, and
measuring time in years, we have
R(0) = 5
and
R(100) = 3.
From the ﬁrst piece of information we learn that
5 = P · eK·0 = P.
Hence P = 5 and
R(t) = 5 · eKt = 5 · (eK)t.

CHAPTER 6
Transcendental Functions
177
The second piece of information yields
3 = R(100) = 5 · (eK)100.
We conclude that
(eK)100 = 3
5
or
eK =
3
5
1/100
.
Thus the formula for the amount of isotope present at time t is
R(t) = 5 ·
3
5
t/100
.
Thus we have complete information about the function R, and we can answer
the original question.
There will be 1 gram of material present when
1 = R(t) = 5 ·
3
5
t/100
or
1
5 =
3
5
t/100
.
We solve for t by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
ln(1/5) = ln
!3
5
t/100"
=
t
100 · ln(3/5).
We conclude that there is 1 gram of radioactive material remaining when
t = 100 · ln(1/5)
ln(3/5) ≈315.066.
So at time t = 315.066, or after 215.066 more years, there will be 1 gram of
the isotope remaining.
You Try It:
Our analysis of exponential growth and decay is derived from the
hypothesis that the rate of growth is proportional to the amount of matter present.
Suppose instead that we are studying a system in which the rate of decay is propor-
tional to the square of the amount of matter. Let M(t) denote the amount of matter
at time t. Then our physical law is expressed as
dM
dt = C · M2.

CHAPTER 6
Transcendental Functions
178
Here C is a (negative) constant of proportionality. We apply the method of
“separation of variables” described earlier in the section. Thus
dM/dt
M2
= C
so that
 dM/dt
M2
dt =

C dt.
Evaluating the integrals, we ﬁnd that
−1
M = Ct + D.
We have combined the constants from the two integrations. In summary,
M(t) = −
1
Ct + D.
For the problem to be realistic, we will require that C < 0 (so that M > 0 for
large values of t) and we see that the population decays like the reciprocal of a
linear function when t becomes large.
Re-calculate Example 6.32 using this new law of exponential decay.
6.5.4
COMPOUND INTEREST
Yet a third illustration of exponential growth is in the compounding of interest. If
principal P is put in the bank at p percent simple interest per year then after one
year the account has
P ·

1 + p
100

dollars. [Here we assume, of course, that all interest is reinvested in the account.]
But if the interest is compounded n times during the year then the year is divided
into n equal pieces and at each time interval of length 1/n an interest payment of
percent p/n is added to the account. Each time this fraction of the interest is added
to the account, the money in the account is multiplied by
1 + p/n
100 .
Since this is done n times during the year, the result at the end of the year is that
the account holds

dollars at the end of the year. Similarly, at the end of t years, the money accumulated
will be

.
Let us set

.
It is useful to know the behavior of the account if the number of times the inter-
est is compounded per year becomes arbitrarily large (this is called continuous
compounding of interest). Continuous compounding corresponds to calculating the
limit of the last formula as k (or, equivalently, n), tends to inﬁnity.
We know from the discussion in Subsection 6.2.3 that the expression (1+1/k)k
tends to e. Therefore the size of the account after one year of continuous
compounding of interest is
P · ep/100.
After t years of continuous compounding of interest the total money is
P · ept/100.
(⋆⋆)
EXAMPLE 6.33
If $6000 is placed in a savings account with 5% annual interest compounded
continuously, then how large is the account after four and one half years?
SOLUTION
If M(t) is the amount of money in the account at time t, then the preceding
discussion guarantees that
M(t) = 6000 · e5t/100.
After four and one half years the size of the account is therefore
M(9/2) = 6000 · e5·(9/2)/100 ≈$7513.94.

birth and is locked in at 11% interest compounded continuously. How much
principal should be put into the account to yield the desired payoff?
SOLUTION
Let P be the initial principal deposited in the account on the day of the
nephew’s birth. Using our compound interest equation (⋆⋆), we have
100000 = P · e11·21/100,
expressing the fact that after 21 years at 11% interest compounded continuously
we want the value of the account to be $100,000.
Solving for P gives
P = 100000 · e−0.11·21 = 100000 · e−2.31 = 9926.13.
The aunt needs to endow the fund with an initial $9926.13.

6.6
Inverse Trigonometric Functions
6.6.1
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
Figure 6.14 shows the graphs of each of the six trigonometric functions. Notice that
each graph has the property that some horizontal line intersects the graph at least
twice. Therefore none of these functions is invertible. Another way of seeing this
point is that each of the trigonometric functions is 2π-periodic (that is, the function
repeats itself every 2π units: f (x + 2π) = f (x)), hence each of these functions is
not one-to-one.
If we want to discuss inverses for the trigonometric functions, then we must
restrict their domains (this concept was introduced in Subsection 1.8.5). In this
section we learn the standard methods for performing this restriction operation
with the trigonometric functions.
6.6.2
INVERSE SINE AND COSINE
Consider the sine function with domain restricted to the interval [−π/2, π/2]
(Fig. 6.15). We use the notation Sin x to denote this restricted function. Observe
that

on the interval (−π/2, π/2). At the endpoints of the interval, and only there, the
function Sin x takes the values −1 and +1. Therefore Sin x is increasing on its
entire domain. So it is one-to-one. Furthermore the Sine function assumes every
value in the interval [−1, 1]. Thus Sin : [−π/2, π/2] →[−1, 1] is one-to-one and
onto; therefore f (x) = Sin x is an invertible function.
We can obtain the graph of Sin−1x by the principle of reﬂection in the line
y = x (Fig. 6.16). The function Sin−1 : [−1, 1] →[−π/2, π/2] is increasing,
one-to-one, and onto.

The study of the inverse of cosine involves similar considerations, but we must
select a different domain for our function. We deﬁne Cos x to be the cosine function
restricted to the interval [0, π]. Then, as Fig. 6.17 shows, g(x) = Cos x is a one-to-
one function. It takes on all the values in the interval [−1, 1]. Thus Cos : [0, π] →
[−1, 1] is one-to-one and onto; therefore it possesses an inverse.
We reﬂect the graph of Cos x in the line y = x to obtain the graph of the function
Cos−1. The result is shown in Fig. 6.18.

THE INVERSE TANGENT FUNCTION
Deﬁne the function Tan x to be the restriction of tan x to the interval (−π/2, π/2).
Observe that the tangent function is undeﬁned at the endpoints of this interval.
Since
d
dx Tan x = sec2x
we see that Tan x is increasing, hence it is one-to-one (Fig. 6.19). Also Tan takes
arbitrarily large positive values when x is near to, but less than, π/2.And Tan takes
negative values that are arbitrarily large in absolute value when x is near to, but
greater than, −π/2.ThereforeTan takes all real values. SinceTan : (−π/2, π/2) →
(−∞, ∞) is one-to-one and onto, the inverse function Tan−1 : (−∞, ∞) →
(−π/2, π/2) exists. The graph of this inverse function is shown in Fig. 6.20. It
is obtained by the usual procedure of reﬂecting in the line y = x.

OTHER INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
The most important inverse trigonometric functions are Sin−1, Cos−1, and Tan−1.
We say just a few words about the other three.
Deﬁne Cot x to be the restriction of the cotangent function to the interval (0, π)

Therefore the inverse

Deﬁne Sec x to be the function sec x restricted to the set [0, π/2) ∪(π/2, π]
(Fig. 6.23). Then Sec x is one-to-one. For these values of the variable x, the cosine
function takes all values in the interval [−1, 1] except for 0. Passing to the recip-
rocal, we see that secant takes all values greater than or equal to 1 and all values
less than or equal to −1. The inverse function is
Sec−1 : (−∞, −1] ∪[1, ∞) →[0, π/2) ∪(π/2, π]

values of the x variable, the sine function takes on all values in the interval [−1, 1]
except for 0. Therefore Csc takes on all values greater than or equal to 1 and all
values less than or equal to −1; Csc−1 therefore has domain (−∞, −1] ∪[1, ∞)
and takes values in [−1, 0) ∪(0, 1] (Fig. 6.26).

AN EXAMPLE INVOLVING INVERSE
TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
EXAMPLE 6.42
Hypatia is viewing a ten-foot-long tapestry that is hung lengthwise on a
wall.The bottom end of the tapestry is two feet above her eye level. At what
distance should she stand from the tapestry in order to obtain the most
favorable view?
SOLUTION
For the purposes of this problem, view A is considered more favorable than
view B if it provides a greater sweep for the eyes. In other words, form the
triangle with vertices (i) the eye of the viewer, (ii) the top of the tapestry, and
(iii) the bottom of the tapestry (Fig. 6.27). Angle α is the angle at the eye of
the viewer. We want the viewer to choose her position so that the angle α at the
eye of the viewer is maximized.

2 ft




Fig. 6.27
The ﬁgure shows a mathematical model for the problem. The angle α is the
angle θ less the angle ψ. Thus we have
α = θ −ψ = Cot−1(x/12) −Cot−1(x/2).
Notice that when the viewer is standing with her face against the wall then
θ = ψ = π/2 so that α = 0.Also when the viewer is far from the tapestry then
θ −α is quite small. So the maximum value for α will occur for some ﬁnite,
positive value of x. That value can be found by differentiating α with respect
to x, setting the derivative equal to zero, and solving for x.

CHAPTER 7
Methods of
Integration
7.1
Integration by Parts
We learned in Section 4.5 that the integral of the sum of two functions is the sum
of the respective integrals. But what of the integral of a product? The following
reasoning is incorrect:

x2 dx =

x · x dx =

x dx ·

x dx
because the left-hand side is x3/3 while the right-hand side is (x2/2) · (x2/2) =
x4/4.
The correct technique for handling the integral of a product is a bit more subtle,
and is called integration by parts. It is based on the product rule
(u · v)′ = u′ · v + u · v′.
Integrating both sides of this equation, we have

(u · v)′ dx =

u′ · v dx +

u · v′ dx.
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that the left-hand side is u · v. Thus
u · v =

u′ · v dx +

u · v′ dx

CHAPTER 7
Methods of Integration

or

u · v′ dx = u · v −

v · u′ dx.
It is traditional to abbreviate u′(x) dx = du and v′(x) dx = dv. Thus the
integration by parts formula becomes

u dv = uv −

v du.
Let us now learn how to use this simple new formula.
EXAMPLE 7.1
Calculate

x · cos x dx.
SOLUTION
We observe that the integrand is a product. Let us use the integration by parts
formula by setting u(x) = x and dv = cos x dx. Then
u(x) = x
du = u′(x) dx = 1 dx = dx
v(x) = sin x
dv = v′(x) dx = cos x dx
Of course we calculate v by anti-differentiation.
According to the integration by parts formula,

x · cos x dx =

u dv
= u · v −

v du
= x · sin x −

sin x dx
= x · sin x −(−cos x) + C
= x · sin x + cos x + C.
Math Note:
Observe that we can check the answer in the last example just by
differentiation:
d
dx [x · sin x + cos x + C] = 1 · sin x + x · cos x −sin x = x · cos x.
The choice of u and v in the integration by parts technique is signiﬁcant. We
selected u to be x because then du will be 1 dx, thereby simplifying the integral.
TEAMFLY

CHAPTER 7
Methods of Integration
199
If we had instead selected u = cos x and dv = x dx then we would have found
that v = x2/2 and du = −sin x dx and the new integral

v du =
 x2
2 (−sin x) dx
is more complicated.
EXAMPLE 7.2
Calculate the integral

x2 · ex dx.
SOLUTION
Keeping in mind that we want to choose u and v so as to simplify the integral,
we take u = x2 and dv = ex dx. Then
u(x) = x2
du = u′(x) dx = 2x dx
v(x) = ex
dv = v′(x) dx = ex dx
Then the integration by parts formula tells us that

x2ex dx =

u dv = uv −

v du = x2 · ex −

ex · 2x dx.
(∗)
We see that we have transformed the integral into a simpler one (involving
x · ex instead of x2 · ex), but another integration by parts will be required. Now
we take u = 2x and dv = ex dx. Then
u(x) = 2x
du = u′(x) dx = 2 dx
v(x) = ex
dv = v′(x) dx = ex dx
So equation (∗) equals
x2 · ex −

u dv = x2 · ex −

SOLUTION
This example differs from the previous ones because now we are evalu-
ating a deﬁnite integral (i.e., an integral with numerical limits). We still use
the integration by parts formula, keeping track of the numerical limits of
integration.
We ﬁrst notice that, on the one hand, the integrand is not a product. On the
other hand, we certainly do not know an antiderivative for log x. We remedy
the situation by writing log x = 1 · log x. Now the only reasonable choice is to
take u = log x and dv = 1 dx. Therefore
u(x) = log x
du = u′(x) dx = (1/x) dx
v(x) = x
dv = v′(x) dx = 1 dx

CHAPTER 7

201
EXAMPLE 7.4
Calculate the integral
 2π
π/2
sin x cos x dx.
SOLUTION
We use integration by parts, but we apply the technique to the corresponding
indeﬁnite integral. We let u = sin x and dv = cos x dx. Then
u(x) = sin x
du = u′(x) dx = cos x dx
v(x) = sin x
dv = v′(x) dx = cos x dx
So

sin x cos x dx =

u dv
= uv −

v du
= (sin x) · (sin x) −

sin x cos x dx.
At ﬁrst blush, it appears that we have accomplished nothing. For the new
integral is just the same as the old integral. But in fact we can move the new
integral (on the right) to the left-hand side to obtain
2

sin x cos x dx = sin2 x.
Throwing in the usual constant of integration, we obtain

sin x cos x dx = 1
2 sin2 x + C.

We see that there are two ways to treat a deﬁnite integral using integration by
parts. One is to carry the limits of integration along with the parts calculation. The
other is to do the parts calculation ﬁrst (with an indeﬁnite integral) and then plug
in the limits of integration at the end. Either method will lead to the same solution.

Since b2 −4ac < 0, the ﬁnal expression in parentheses is positive. For simplicity,
let λ = b/2a and let γ = c −b2/(4a). Then our integral is

Of course we can handle this using II above. We ﬁnd that

PRODUCTS OF LINEAR FACTORS
We illustrate the technique of partial fractions by way of examples.
EXAMPLE 7.5
Here we treat the case of distinct linear factors.
Let us calculate

1
x2 −3x + 2 dx.

CHAPTER 7
Methods of Integration
204
SOLUTION
We notice that the integrand factors as
1
x2 −3x + 2 =
1
(x −1)(x −2).
(∗)
[Notice that the quadratic polynomial in the denominator will factor precisely
when the discriminant is ≥0, which is case IV from Subsection 7.2.1.] Our
goal is to write the fraction on the right-hand side of (∗) as a sum of simpler
fractions. With this thought in mind, we write
1
(x −1)(x −2) =
A
x −1 +
B
x −2,
where A and B are constants to be determined. Let us put together the two
fractions on the right by placing them over the common denominator (x −1)×
(x −2). Thus
1
(x −1)(x −2) =
A
x −1 +
B
x −2 = A(x −2) + B(x −1)
(x −1)(x −2)
.
The only way that the fraction on the far left can equal the fraction on the far
right is if their numerators are equal. This observation leads to the equation
1 = A(x −2) + B(x −1)
or
0 = (A + B)x + (−2A −B −1).
Now this equation is to be identically true in x; in other words, it must hold for
every value of x. So the coefﬁcients must be 0.
At long last, then, we have a system of two equations in two unknowns:
A + B = 0
−2A −B −1 = 0
Of course this system is easily solved and the solutions found to be A =
−1, B = 1. We conclude that
1
(x −1)(x −2) =
−1
x −1 +
1
x −2.
What we have learned, then, is that

Now we consider repeated linear factors.
EXAMPLE 7.6
Let us evaluate the integral

dx
x3 −4x2 −3x + 18 .
SOLUTION
In order to apply the method of partial fractions, we ﬁrst must factor the
denominator of the integrand. It is known that every polynomial with real
coefﬁcients will factor into linear and quadratic factors. How do we ﬁnd this
factorization? Of course we must ﬁnd a root. For a polynomial of the form
xk + ak−1xk−1 + ak−2xk−2 + · · · + a1x + a0,
any integer root will be a factor of a0. This leads us to try ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±9
and ±18. We ﬁnd that −2 and 3 are roots of x3 −4x2 −3x + 18. In point of
fact,
x3 −4x2 −3x + 18 = (x + 2) · (x −3)2.
An attempt to write
1
x3 −4x2 −3x + 18 =
A
x + 2 +
B
x −3
will not work. We encourage the reader to try this for himself so that he will
understand why an extra idea is needed.
In fact we will use the paradigm
1
x3 −4x2 −3x + 18 =
A
x + 2 +
B
x −3 +
C
(x −3)2 .
Putting the right-hand side over a common denominator yields
1
x3 −4x2 −3x + 18 = A(x −3)2 + B(x + 2)(x −3) + C(x + 2)
x3 −4x2 −3x + 18
.

CHAPTER 7
Methods of Integration
206
Of course the numerators must be equal, so
1 = A(x −3)2 + B(x + 2)(x −3) + C(x + 2).
We rearrange the equation as
(A + B)x2 + (−6A −B + C)x + (9A −6B + 2C −1) = 0.
Since this must be an identity in x, we arrive at the system of equations
A + B
= 0
−6A −B + C
= 0
9A −6B + 2C −1 = 0
This system is easily solved to yield A = 1/25, B = −1/25, C = 1/5.
As a result of these calculations, our integral can be transformed as follows:

1
x3 −4x2 −3x + 18 dx =

1/25
x + 2 dx +
 −1/25
x −3 dx +

1/5
(x −3)2 dx.
The ﬁrst integral equals (1/25) log |x + 2|, the second integral equals −(1/25)
log |x −3|, and the third integral equals −(1/5)/(x −3).
In summary, we have found that

1
x3 −4x2 −3x + 18 dx = log |x + 2|

7.2.3
QUADRATIC FACTORS
EXAMPLE 7.7
Evaluate the integral

x dx
x3 + 2x2 + x + 2 .
SOLUTION
Since the denominator is a cubic polynomial, it must factor. The factors of
the constant term are ±1 and ±2. After some experimentation, we ﬁnd that
x = −2 is a root and in fact the polynomial factors as
x3 + 2x2 + x + 2 = (x + 2)(x2 + 1).

CHAPTER 7
Methods of Integration
207
Thus we wish to write the integrand as the sum of a factor with denominator
(x + 2) and another factor with denominator (x2 + 1). The correct way to do
this is
x
x3 + 2x2 + x + 2 =
x
(x + 2)(x2 + 1) =
A
x + 2 + Bx + C
x2 + 1 .
We put the right-hand side over a common denominator to obtain
x
x3 + 2x2 + x + 2 = A(x2 + 1) + (Bx + C)(x + 2)
x3 + 2x2 + x + 2
.
Identifying numerators leads to
x = (A + B)x2 + (2B + C)x + (A + 2C).
This equation must be identically true, so we ﬁnd (identifying powers of x) that
A +
B
= 0
2B + C = 1
A
+ 2C = 0
Solving this system, we ﬁnd that A = −2/5, B = 2/5, C = 1/5. So

Substitution
Sometimes it is convenient to transform a given integral into another one by means
of a change of variable. This method is often called “the method of change of
variable” or “u-substitution.”

CHAPTER 7
Methods of Integration
208
To see a model situation, imagine an integral
 b
a
f (x) dx.
If the techniques that we know will not sufﬁce to evaluate the integral, then we might
attempt to transform this to another integral by a change of variable x = ϕ(t). This
entails dx = ϕ′(t) dt. Also
x = a ←→t = ϕ−1(a)
and
x = b ←→t = ϕ−1(b).
Thus the original integral is transformed to
 ϕ−1(b)
ϕ−1(a)
f (ϕ(t)) · ϕ′(t) dt.
It turns out that, with a little notation, we can make this process both convenient
and straightforward.
We now illustrate this new paradigm with some examples. We begin with an
indeﬁnite integral.
EXAMPLE 7.8
Evaluate

[sin x]5 · cos x dx.
SOLUTION
On looking at the integral, we see that the expression cos x is the derivative
of sin x. This observation suggests the substitution sin x = u. Thus cos x dx =
du. We must now substitute these expressions into the integral, replacing all
x-expressions with u-expressions. When we are through with this process, no
x expressions can remain. The result is

u5 du.
This is of course an easy integral for us. So we have

[sin x]5 · cos x dx =

u5 du = u6
6 + C.
Now the important ﬁnal step is to resubstitute the x-expressions in place of
the u-expressions. The result is then

[sin x]5 · cos x dx = sin6 x
6
+ C.

2x

x2 + 1 dx.
SOLUTION
We recognize that the expression 2x is the derivative of x2+1. This suggests
the substitution u = x2 + 1. Thus du = 2x dx. Also x = 0 ←→u = 1 and
x = 3 ←→u = 10. The integral is thus transformed to
 10

√u du.

Since cos x is the derivative of sin x, it is natural to attempt the substitution

Integrals of Trigonometric Expressions
Trigonometric expressions arise frequently in our work, especially as a result of
substitutions. In this section we develop a few examples of trigonometric integrals.
The following trigonometric identities will be particularly useful for us.
I
We have
sin2 x = 1 −cos 2x
2
.
The reason is that
cos 2x = cos2 x −sin2 x =

1 −sin2 x

−sin2 x = 1 −2 sin2 x.
II
We have
cos2 x = 1 + cos 2x
2
.
The reason is that
cos 2x = cos2 x −sin2 x = cos2 x −

1 −cos2 x

sin x.
Then

Integrals involving the other trigonometric functions can also be handled with

handled with the identity
tan2 x + 1 = sin2 x
cos2 x + 1 = sin2 x + cos2 x
cos2 x

cos2 x = sec2 x.
EXAMPLE 7.14

Volumes by Slicing
8.1.0
INTRODUCTION
When we learned the theory of the integral, we found that the basic idea was that
one can calculate the area of an irregularly shaped region by subdividing the region
into “rectangles.” We put the word “rectangle” here in quotation marks because the
region is not literally broken up into rectangles; the union of the rectangles differs
from the actual region under consideration by some small errors (see Fig. 8.1). But
the contribution made by these errors vanishes as the mesh of the rectangles become
ﬁner and ﬁner.
We will now implement this same philosophy to calculate certain volumes. Some
of these will be volumes that you have heard about (e.g., the sphere or cone), but
have never known why the volume had the value that it had. Others will be entirely
new (e.g., the paraboloid of revolution). We will again use the method of slicing.
8.1.1
THE BASIC STRATEGY
Imagine a solid object situated as in Fig. 8.2. Observe the axes in the diagram, and
imagine that we slice the ﬁgure with slices that are vertical (i.e., that rise out of
the x-y plane) and that are perpendicular to the x-axis (and parallel to the y-axis).
Look at Fig. 8.3. Notice, in the ﬁgure, that the ﬁgure extends from x = a to x = b.

If we can express the area of the slice at position x as a function A(x) of x,
then (see Fig. 8.4) the volume of a slice of thickness △x at position x will be about
A(x) · △x. If P = {x0, x1, . . . , xk} is a partition of the interval [a, b] then the

technique of Example 8.1 to verify this more general formula.
EXAMPLE 8.2
A solid has base the unit disk in the x-y plane. The vertical cross section at

EXAMPLE 8.3
A solid has base in the x-y plane consisting of a unit square with center at
the origin and vertices on the axes. The vertical cross-section at position x
is itself a square. Refer to Fig. 8.9. What is the volume of this solid?

double the answer. Of course the extent of x is then 0 ≤x ≤1/

Calculate the volume inside a sphere of radius 1.
SOLUTION
It is convenient for us to think of the sphere as centered at the origin in the
x-y plane. Thus (Fig. 8.11) the slice at position x, −1 ≤x ≤1, is a disk. Since
we are working with base the unit circle, we may calculate ( just as in Example

Volumes of Solids of Revolution
8.2.0
INTRODUCTION
Auseful way—and one that we encounter frequently in everyday life—for generat-
ing solids is by revolving a planar region about an axis. For example, we can think
of a ball (the interior of a sphere) as the solid obtained by rotating a disk about
an axis (Fig. 8.12). We can think of a cylinder as the solid obtained by rotating
a rectangle about an adjacent axis (Fig. 8.13). We can think of a tubular solid as
obtained by rotating a rectangle around a non-adjacent axis (Fig. 8.14).
Fig. 8.12
Fig. 8.13

CHAPTER 8
Applications of the Integral
225
Fig. 8.14
There are two main methods for calculating volumes of solids of revolution:
the method of washers and the method of cylinders. The ﬁrst of these is really an
instance of volume by slicing, just as we saw in the last section. The second uses a
different geometry; instead of slices one uses cylindrical shells. We shall develop
both technologies by way of some examples.
8.2.1
THE METHOD OF WASHERS
EXAMPLE 8.5
A solid is formed by rotating the triangle with vertices (0, 0), (2, 0), and (1, 1)
about the x-axis. See Fig. 8.15. What is the resulting volume?
(1,1)
(2,0)
(0,0)
Fig. 8.15
SOLUTION
For 0 ≤x ≤1, the upper edge of the triangle has equation y = x. Thus
the segment being rotated extends from (x, 0) to (x, x). Under rotation, it will
generate a disk of radius x, and hence area A(x) = πx2. Thus the volume
generated over the segment 0 ≤x ≤1 is
V1 =
 1
0
πx2 dx.
Similarly, for 1 ≤x ≤2, the upper edge of the triangle has equation y =
2 −x. Thus the segment being rotated extends from (x, 0) to (x, 2 −x). Under

CHAPTER 8
Applications of the Integral
226
rotation, it will generate a disk of radius 2−x, and hence area A(x) = π(2−x)2.
Thus the volume generated over the segment 1 ≤x ≤2 is
V2 =
 2
1
π(2 −x)2 dx.
In summary, the total volume of our solid of revolution is
V = V1 + V2

EXAMPLE 8.6
The portion of the curve y = x2 between x = 1 and x = 4 is rotated about
the x-axis (Fig. 8.16). What volume does the resulting surface enclose?
Fig. 8.16
SOLUTION
At position x, the curve is x2 units above the x-axis. The point (x, x2), under
rotation, therefore generates a circle of radius x2.The disk that the circle bounds

CHAPTER 8

has area A(x) = π · (x2)2. Thus the described volume is

Math Note:
The reasoning we have used in the last two examples shows this:
If the curve y = f (x), a ≤x ≤b, is rotated about the x-axis then the volume
enclosed by the resulting surface is
V =
 b
a
π · [f (x)]2 dx.
You Try It:
Calculate the volume enclosed by the surface obtained by rotating
the curve y = √x + 1, 4 ≤x ≤9, about the x-axis.
EXAMPLE 8.7
The curve y = x3, 0 ≤x ≤3, is rotated about the y-axis. What volume
does the resulting surface enclose?
SOLUTION
It is convenient in this problem to treat y as the independent variable and x as
the dependent variable. So we write the curve as x = y1/3. Then, at position y,
the curve is distance y1/3 from the axis so the disk generated under rotation will
have radius y1/3 (Fig. 8.17). Thus the disk will have area A(y) = π · [y1/3]2.
Also, since x ranges from 0 to 3 we see that y ranges from 0 to 27. As a result,
Fig. 8.17

the volume enclosed is

curve x = g(y), c ≤y ≤d, is rotated about the y-axis then the volume enclosed
by the resulting surface is
V =
 d
c
π · [g(y)]2 dy.
You Try It:
Calculate the volume enclosed when the curve y = x1/3, 32 ≤x ≤
243, is rotated about the y-axis.
EXAMPLE 8.8
Set up, but do not evaluate, the integral that represents the volume gener-
ated when the planar region between y = x2 + 1 and y = 2x + 4 is rotated
about the x-axis.
SOLUTION
When the planar region is rotated about the x-axis, it will generate a donut-
shaped solid. Notice that the curves intersect at x = −1 and x = 3; hence
the intersection lies over the interval [−1, 3]. For each x in that interval, the
segment connecting (x, x2 + 1) to (x, 2x + 4) will be rotated about the x-axis.
It will generate a washer. See Fig. 8.18. The area of that washer is
A(x) = π · [2x + 4]2 −π · [x2 + 1].
[Notice that we calculate the area of a washer by subtracting the areas of two
circles—not by subtracting the radii and then squaring.]
It follows that the volume of the solid generated is
V =
 3
−1
π · [2x + 4]2 −π · [x2 + 1] dx.
8.2.2
THE METHOD OF CYLINDRICAL SHELLS
Our philosophy will now change. When we divide our region up into vertical strips,
we will now rotate each strip about the y-axis instead of the x-axis. Thus, instead
of generating a disk with each strip, we will now generate a cylinder.
Look at Fig. 8.19. When a strip of height h and thickness △x, with distance r
from the y-axis, is rotated about the y-axis, the resulting cylinder has surface area
2πr · h and volume about 2πr · h · △x. This is the expression that we will treat
in order to sum up the volumes of the cylinders.

EXAMPLE 8.9
Use the method of cylindrical shells to calculate the volume of the solid
enclosed when the curve y = x2, 1 ≤x ≤3, is rotated about the y-axis.
SOLUTION
As usual, we think of the region under y = x2 and above the x-axis as
composed of vertical segments or strips. The segment at position x has height
x2. Thus, in this instance, h = x2, r = x, and the volume of the cylinder is
2πx · x2 · △x. As a result, the requested volume is
V =

SOLUTION
We reverse, in our analysis, the roles of the x- and y-axes. Of course y
ranges from 0 to 9. For each position y in that range, there is a segment stretch-
ing from x = √y to x = 3. Thus it has length 3 −√y. Then the cylinder
generated when this segment (thickened to a strip of width △y) is rotated
about the x-axis has volume

DIFFERENT AXES
Sometimes it is convenient to rotate a curve about some line other than the
coordinate axes. We now provide a couple of examples of that type of problem.
EXAMPLE 8.11
Use the method of washers to calculate the volume of the solid enclosed
when the curve y = √x, 1 ≤x ≤4, is rotated about the line y = −1. See
Fig. 8.21.

SOLUTION
The key is to notice that, at position x, the segment to be rotated has height
√x −(−1)—the distance from the point (x, √x) on the curve to the line
y = −1. Thus the disk generated has area A(x) = π ·(√x +1)2. The resulting

Fig. 8.22
SOLUTION
Solving the equations simultaneously, we ﬁnd that the points of intersec-
tion are (5, 0) and (5, 4). The region between the two curves is illustrated in
Fig. 8.22.
At height y, the horizontal segment that is to be rotated stretches from
((y −2)2 + 1, y) to (−(y −2)2 + 9, y). Thus the cylindrical shell that is

CHAPTER 8

generated has radius y −2, height 8−2(y −2)2, and thickness △y. It therefore
generates the element of volume given by
2π · (y −2) · [8 −2(y −2)2] · △y.

Work
One of the basic principles of physics is that work performed is force times distance:
If you apply force F pounds in moving an object d feet, then the work is
W = F · d
foot-pounds.
The problem becomes more interesting (than simple arithmetic) if the force is
varying from point to point. We now consider some problems of that type.
EXAMPLE 8.13
A weight is pushed in the plane from x = 0 to x = 10. Because of a
prevailing wind, the force that must be applied at point x is F(x) = 3x2 −
x + 10 foot-pounds. What is the total work performed?
0

Fig. 8.23
SOLUTION
Followingthewaythatweusuallydothingsincalculus,webreaktheproblem
up into pieces. In moving the object from position x to position x + △x, the

CHAPTER 8
Applications of the Integral
234
distance moved is △x feet and the force applied is about F(x) = 3x2 −x +10.
See Fig. 8.23. Thus work performed in that little bit of the move is w(x) =
(3x2 −x + 10) · △x. The aggregate of the work is obtained by summation. In
this instance, the integral is the appropriate device:
W =

= 1050 foot-pounds.
EXAMPLE 8.14
A man is carrying a 100 lb sack of sand up a 20-foot ladder at the rate of
5 feet per minute.The sack has a hole in it and sand leaks out continuously
at a rate of 4 lb per minute. How much work does the man do in carrying
the sack?
Fig. 8.24
SOLUTION
It takes four minutes for the man to climb the ladder. At time t, the sack has
100 −4t pounds of sand in it. From time t to time t + △t, the man moves
5·△t feet up the ladder. He therefore performs about w(t) = (100−4t)·5△t
foot-pounds of work. See Fig. 8.24. The total work is then the integral
W =

A man drags a 100 pound weight from x = 0 to x = 300. He resists
a wind which at position x applies a force of magnitude F(x) = x3 + x + 40. How
much work does he perform?
EXAMPLE 8.15
According to Hooke’s Law, the amount of force exerted by a spring is propor-
tional to the distance of its displacement from the rest position.The constant
of proportionality is called the Hooke’s constant. A certain spring exerts a
force of 10 pounds when stretched 1/2 foot beyond its rest state. What is
the work performed in stretching the spring from rest to 1/3 foot beyond its
rest length?
Fig. 8.25
SOLUTION
Let the x-variable denote the position of the right end of the spring (Fig. 8.25),
with x = 0 the rest position. The left end of the spring is pinned down. Imagine
that the spring is being stretched to the right. We know that the force exerted
by the spring has the form
F(x) = kx,
with k a negative constant (since the spring will pull to the left).Also F(0.5) =
−10. It follows that k = −20, so that
F(x) = −20x.
Now the work done in moving the spring from position x to position x + △x
will be about (20x) · △x (the sign is + since we will pull the spring to the
right—against the pull of the spring). Thus the total work done in stretching
the right end of the spring from x = 0 to x = 1/3 is

Radius at depth x
equals √100 _ x2
Fig. 8.26
SOLUTION
A glance at Fig. 8.27 shows that the horizontal planar slice of the tank, at the
level x feet below the top, is a disk of radius
√
100 −x2. This disk therefore
has area A(x) = π · (100 −x2). Thus a slice at that level of thickness △x will
have volume
V (x) = π · (100 −x2) · △x

and (assuming that water weights 62.4 pounds per cubic foot) weight equal to

Thus the work in raising this slice to the top of the tank (where it can then
be dumped) is
W(x) =

Averages
In ordinary conversation, when we average a collection p1, . . . , pk of k numbers,
we add them together and divide by the number of items:
σ = Average = p1 + · · · + pk
k
.
The signiﬁcance of the number σ is that if we wanted all the k numbers to be equal,
but for the total to be the same, then that common value would have to be σ.
Now suppose that we want to average a continuous function f over an interval
[a, b] of its domain. We can partition the interval,
P = {x0, x1, . . . , xk},
with x0 = a and xk = b as usual. We assume that this is a uniform partition, with
xj −xj−1 = △x = (b−a)/k for all j. Then an “approximate average” of f would
be given by
σapp = f (x1) + f (x2) + · · · + f (xk)
k
.
It is convenient to write this expression as
σapp =

Arc Length and Surface Area
Just as the integral may be used to calculate planar area and spatial volume, so this
tool may also be used to calculate the arc length of a curve and surface area. The
basic idea is to approximate the length of a curve by the length of its piecewise
linear approximation. A similar comment applies to the surface area. We begin by
describing the basic rubric.

Suppose that f (x) is a function on the interval [a, b]. Let us see how to calculate
the length of the curve consisting of the graph of f over this interval (Fig. 8.28).
We partition the interval:
a = x0 ≤x1 ≤x2 ≤· · · ≤xk−1 ≤xk = b.
Look at Fig. 8.29. Corresponding to each pair of points xj−1, xj in the partition
is a segment connecting two points on the curve; the segment has endpoints
(xj−1, f (xj−1)) and (xj, f (xj)). The length ℓj of this segment is given by the

ℓj =

We denote the quantity xj −xj−1 by △x and apply the deﬁnition of the derivative
to obtain
f (xj) −f (xj−1)
△x
≈f ′(xj).
Now we may rewrite the formula for ℓj as
ℓj ≈([8x]2 + [f ′(xj)8x]2)1/2
= (1 + [f ′(xj)]2)1/28x.
Summing up the lengths ℓj (Fig. 8.30) gives an approximate length for the curve:

As the mesh of the partition becomes ﬁner, the approximating sum is ever closer to
what we think of as the length of the curve, and it also converges to this integral.
Thus the integral represents the length of the curve.

integral would have been harder to evaluate) had we expressed the curve in the

SURFACE AREA
Let f (x) be a non-negative function on the interval [a, b]. Imagine rotating the
graph of f about the x-axis. This procedure will generate a surface of revolution,
as shown in Fig. 8.31. We will develop a procedure for determining the area of such
a surface.

a cylindrical surface. Now the area of a true right circular cylinder is 2π · r · h. We
do not have a true cylinder, so we proceed as follows. We may approximate the
radius by f (xj). And the height of the cylinder can be approximated by the length
of the curve spanning the pair xj−1, xj. This length was determined above to be
about

Thus the area contribution of this cylindrical increment of our surface is about

Hydrostatic Pressure
If a liquid sits in a tank, then it exerts force on the side of the tank. This force is
caused by gravity, and the greater the depth of the liquid then the greater the force.
Pascal’s principle asserts that the force exerted by a body of water depends on
depth alone, and is the same in all directions. Thus the force on a point in the side
of the tank is deﬁned to be the depth of the liquid at that point times the density of
the liquid. Naturally, if we want to design tanks which will not burst their seams, it
is important to be able to calculate this force precisely.
Fig. 8.35
Imagine a tank of liquid having density ρ pounds per cubic foot as shown in
Fig. 8.35. We want to calculate the force on one ﬂat side wall of the tank. Thus
we will use the independent variable h to denote depth, measured down from the
surface of the water, and calculate the force on the wall of the tank between depths
h = a and h = b (Fig. 8.36). We partition the interval [a, b]:
a = h0 ≤h1 ≤h2 ≤· · · ≤hk−1 ≤hk = b.

CHAPTER 8
Applications of the Integral
248
Assume that the width of the tank at depth h is w(h).The portion of the wall between
h = hj−1 and h = hj is then approximated by a rectangle Rj of length w(hj) and
width 8h = hj −hj−1 (Fig. 8.37).
h = a
h = b
Fig. 8.36
w(hj)
h
Fig. 8.37
Now we have the following data:
Area of Rectangle = w(hj) · 8h square feet
Depth of Water ≈hj feet
Density of Liquid = ρ pounds per cubic foot.
It follows that the force exerted on this thin portion of the wall is about
Pj = hj · ρ · w(hj) · 8h.
Adding up the force on each Rj gives a total force of

SOLUTION
We let the independent variable h denote depth, measured vertically down
from the surface of the water. Since the pool is rectangular with vertical sides,
w(h) is constantly equal to 20 (because we are interested in the long side). We
use 62.4 pounds per cubic foot for the density of water. According to (∗), the
total force on the long side is

SOLUTION
As shown in Fig. 8.40, at depth h (measured down from the surface of the

similar to the triangle describing the end of the tank. The height of this triangle
is 5 −h. Thus we can solve
w(h)

20 feet below the surface. The window is in the shape of a square of side
4
√
2 feet with vertical and horizontal diagonals (see Fig. 8.41). What is the
total force on this window?
SOLUTION
As usual, we measure depth downward from the surface with independent
variable h. Of course the square window has diagonal 4 feet. Then the range of
integration will be h = 20−4 = 16 to h = 20+4 = 24. Refer to Fig. 8.42. For
h between 16 and 20, we notice that the right triangle in Fig. 8.42 is isosceles
and hence has base of length h −16. Therefore
w(h) = 2(h −16) = 2h −32.

For the lower half of the window, we examine the isosceles right triangle in

Numerical Methods of Integration
While there are many integrals that we can calculate explicitly, there are many
others that we cannot. For example, it is impossible to evaluate

e−x2 dx.
(∗)
Thatistosay,itcanbeprovedmathematicallythatnoclosed-formantiderivativecan
be written down for the function e−x2. Nevertheless, (∗) is one of the most important
integrals in all of mathematics, for it is the Gaussian probability distribution integral
that plays such an important role in statistics and probability.
Thus we need other methods for getting our hands on the value of an integral.
One method would be to return to the original deﬁnition, that is to the Riemann
sums. If we need to know the value of
 1
0
e−x2 dx
then we can approximate this value by a Riemann sum
 1

(⋆)
The trouble with these “numerical approximations” is that they are calcula-
tionally expensive: the degree of accuracy achieved compared to the number of
calculations required is not attractive.
Fortunately, there are more accurate and more rapidly converging methods for
calculating integrals with numerical techniques. We shall explore some of these in
the present section.
It should be noted, and it is nearly obvious to say so, that the techniques of
this section require the use of a computer. While the Riemann sum (∗∗) could be
computed by hand with some considerable effort, the Riemann sum (⋆) is all but
infeasible to do by hand. Many times one wishes to approximate an integral by the
sum of a thousand terms (if, perhaps, ﬁve decimal places of accuracy are needed).
In such an instance, use of a high-speed digital computer is virtually mandatory.
8.7.1
THE TRAPEZOID RULE
The method of using Riemann sums to approximate an integral is sometimes called
“the method of rectangles.” It is adequate, but it does not converge very quickly
and it begs more efﬁcient methods. In this subsection we consider the method of
approximating by trapezoids.
Let f be a continuous function on an interval [a, b] and consider a partition
P = {x0, x1, . . . , xk} of the interval. As usual, we take x0 = a and xk = b. We also
assume that the partition is uniform.
Fig. 8.44
In the method of rectangles we consider a sum of the areas of rectangles.
Figure 8.44 shows one rectangle, how it approximates the curve, and what error

CHAPTER 8
Applications of the Integral
254
is made in this particular approximation. The rectangle gives rise to a “triangular”
error region (the difference between the true area under the curve and the area of the
rectangle). We put quotation marks around the word “triangular” since the region
in question is not a true triangle but instead is a sort of curvilinear triangle. If we
instead approximate by trapezoids, as in Fig. 8.45 (which, again, shows just one
region), then at least visually the errors seem to be much smaller.
Fig. 8.45
In fact, letting △x = xj −xj−1 as usual, we see that the ﬁrst trapezoid in the
ﬁgure has area [f (x0)+f (x1)]·△x/2. The second has area [f (x1)+f (x2)]·△x/2,
and so forth. In sum, the aggregate of the areas of all the trapezoids is
1
2 · {f (x0) + f (x1)} · △x + 1
2 · {f (x1) + f (x2)} · △x + · · ·
+ 1
2 · {f (xk−1) + f (xk)} · △x
= △x
2 · {f (x0) + 2f (x1) + 2f (x2)
+ · · · + 2f (xk−1) + f (xk)}.
(†)
It is known that, if the second derivative of f on the interval [a, b] does not exceed
M then the approximation given by the sum (†) is accurate to within
M · (b −a)3
12k2
.
[By contrast, the accuracy of the method of rectangles is generally not better than
N · (b −a)2
2k
,
where N is an upper bound for the ﬁrst derivative of f . We see that the
method of trapezoids introduces an extra power of (b −a) in the numerator

CHAPTER 8
Applications of the Integral
255
of the error estimate and, perhaps more importantly, an extra factor of k in the
denominator.]
EXAMPLE 8.29
Calculate the integral
 1
0
e−x2 dx
to two decimal places of accuracy.
SOLUTION
We ﬁrst calculate that if f (x) = e−x2 then f ′′(x) = (4x2 −2)e−x2 and
therefore |f ′′(x)| ≤2 = M for 0 ≤x ≤1. In order to control the error, and to
have two decimal places of accuracy, we need to have
M · (b −a)3
12k2
< 0.005
or
2 · 13
12k2 < 0.005.
Rearranging this inequality gives
100
3
< k2.
Obviously k = 6 will do.
So we will use the partition P = {0, 1/6, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 5/6, 1}. The corres-
ponding trapezoidal sum is
S = 1/6
2 ·
$
e−02 + 2e−(1/6)2 + 2e−(1/3)2 + 2e−(1/2)2
+ 2e−(2/3)2 + 2e−(5/6)2 + e−12%
.
Some tedious but feasible calculation yields then that
S = 1
12 · {1 + 2 · .9726 + 2 · .8948 + 2 · .7880
+ 2 · .6412 + 2 · .4994 + .3679}
= 8.9599
12
= .7451.
We may use a computer algebra utility like Mathematica or Maple to
calculate the integral exactly (to six decimal places) to equal 0.746824. We thus
see that the answer we obtained with the Trapezoid Rule is certainly accurate
to two decimal places. It is not accurate to three decimal places.

CHAPTER 8
Applications of the Integral
256
It should be noted that Maple and Mathematica both use numerical tech-
niques, like the ones being developed in this section, to calculate integrals. So our
calculations merely emulate what these computer algebra utilities do so swiftly and
so well.
You Try It:
How ﬁne a partition would we have needed to use if we wanted four
decimal places of accuracy in the last example? If you have some facility with a
computer, use the Trapezoid Rule with that partition and conﬁrm that your answer
agrees with Mathematica’s answer to four decimal places.
EXAMPLE 8.30
Use the Trapezoid Rule with k = 4 to estimate
 1

Of course we could calculate this integral precisely by hand, but the point

A bit of calculation reveals that
S = 1
8 · 5323
850 ≈0.782794 . . . .
Now if we take f (x) = 1/(1 + x2) then f ′′(x) = (6x2 −2)/(1 + x2)3.
Thus, on the interval [0, 1], we have that |f ′′(x)| ≤4 = M. Thus the error
estimate for the Trapezoid Rule predicts accuracy of
M · (b −a)3
12k2
= 4 · 13
12 · 42 ≈0.020833 . . . .
This suggests accuracy of one decimal place.
Now we know that the true and exact value of the integral is arctan 1 ≈
0.78539816 . . .. Thus our Trapezoid Rule approximation is good to one, and
nearly to two, decimal places—better than predicted.
8.7.2
SIMPSON’S RULE
Simpson’s Rule takes our philosophy another step: If rectangles are good, and
trapezoids better, then why not approximate by curves? In Simpson’s Rule, we
approximate by parabolas.

CHAPTER 8
Applications of the Integral
257
We have a continuous function f on the interval [a, b] and we have a partition
P = {x0, x1, . . . , xk} of our partition as usual. It is convenient in this technique to
assume that we have an even number of intervals in the partition.
Fig. 8.46
Now each rectangle, over each segment of the partition, is capped off by an
arc of a parabola. Figure 8.46 shows just one such rectangle. In fact, for each pair
of intervals [x2j−2, x2j−1], [x2j−1, x2j], we consider the unique parabola passing
through the endpoints
(x2j−2, f (x2j−2)),
(x2j−1, f (x2j−1)),
(x2j, f (x2j)).
(∗)
Note that a parabola y = Ax2 + Bx + C has three undetermined coefﬁcients, so
three points as in (∗) will determine A, B, C and pin down the parabola.
In fact (pictorially) the difference between the parabola and the graph of f is
so small that the error is almost indiscernible. This should therefore give rise to a
startling accurate approximation, and it does.
Summing up the areas under all the approximating parabolas (we shall not
perform the calculations) gives the following approximation to the integral:
 b
a
f (x) dx ≈△x
3 {f (x0) + 4f (x1) + 2f (x2) + 4f (x3)
+ 2f (x4) + · · · + 2f (xk−2) + 4f (xk−1) + f (xk)}.
If it is known that the fourth derivative f (iv)(x) satisﬁes |f (iv)(x)| ≤M on [a, b],
then the error resulting from Simpson’s method does not exceed
M · (b −a)5
180 · k4
.

0 e−x2 dx to two decimal places of
accuracy.
SOLUTION
If we set f (x) = e−x2 then it is easy to calculate that
f (iv)(x) = e−x2 · [12 −72x2 + 32x4].
Thus |f (x)| ≤12 = M.
In order to achieve the desired degree of accuracy, we require that
M · (b −a)5
180 · k4
< 0.005
or
12 · 15
180 · k4 < 0.005.
Simple manipulation yields
200
15 < k4.
This condition is satisﬁed when k = 2.
Thus our job is easy. We take the partition P = {0, 1/2, 1}. The sum arising
from Simpson’s Rule is then
S = 1/2
3 {f (0) + 4f (1/2) + f (1)}
= 1
6{e−02 + 4 · e−(1/2)2 + e−12}
= 1
6{1 + 3.1152 + 0.3679}
≈1
6 · 4.4831
≈0.7472
Comparing with the “exact value” 0.746824 for the integral that we noted in
Example 8.29, we ﬁnd that we have achieved two decimal places of accuracy.
It is interesting to note that if we had chosen a partition with k = 6, as we did
in Example 8.29, then Simpson’s Rule would have guaranteed an accuracy of
M · (b −a)5
180 · k4
= 12 · 15
180 · 64 ≈0.00005144,
or nearly four decimal places of accuracy.

SOLUTION
Of course this example is parallel to Example 8.30, and you should compare
the two examples. Our function is f (x) = 1/(1 + x2) and our partition is
P = {0, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 1}. The sum from Simpson’s Rule is

Comparing with Example 8.30, we see that this answer is accurate to four
decimal places. We invite the reader to do the necessary calculation with the
Simpson’s Rule error to term to conﬁrm that we could have predicted this
degree of accuracy.

Of course v(t) = p′(t) = 12t −5 so v(4) = 43 feet/second. The average
velocity from t = 2 to t = 8 is
vav = p(8) −p(2)

= 364 −34

= 55.
Thederivativeofthevelocityfunctionis(v′)′(t) = 12.Thisderivativenever
vanishes, so the extrema of the velocity function on the interval [5, 10] occur
at t = 5 and t = 10. Since v(5) = 55 and v(10) = 115, we see that the
maximum velocity on this time interval is 115 feet per second at t = 10.

Figure S3.2 shows a schematic of the imbedded cylinder. We see that the
volume of the imbedded cylinder, as a function of height h, is
V (h) = π · h · (3 −h/2)2.
Then we solve
0 = V ′(h) = π ·
	
9 −6h + 3h2/4

.

Chapter 3
281
Fig. S3.2
The roots of this equation are h = 2, 6. Of course height 6 gives a trivial
cylinder, as does height 0. We ﬁnd that the solution of our problem is height
2, radius 2.

We know that
V = ℓ· w · h
hence

= 1 · 60 · 15 + 100 · (−0.5) · 15 + 100 · 60 · 0.3
= 900 −750 + 1800 = 1950 in/min.
4.
We know that v0 = −15. Therefore the position of the body is given by
p(t) = −16t2 −15t + h0.
Since
0 = p(5) = −16 · 52 −15 · 5 + h0,
we ﬁnd that h0 = 475. The body has initial height 475 feet.
5.
We know that
V = 1
3 · πr2 · h.
Therefore
0 = d
dt V = 1
3 · π · r2 · dh
dt + 1
3 · π · 2r · dr
dt · h.
At the moment of the problem, dh/dt = 3, r = 5, h = 12/(5π). Hence
0 = π · 52 · 32 + π · (2 · 5) · dr
dt · 12
5π

or
0 = 225π + 24 · dr
dt .
We conclude that dr/dt = −75π/8 microns per minute.
6.
Of course
10000 = V = π · r2 · h.
We conclude that
h = 10000
π · r2 .
We wish to minimize
A = (area of top) + (area of sides)
= π · r2 + 2π · r · h = π · r2 + 2π · r · 10000
πr2 .
Thus the function to minimize is
A(r) = π · r2 + 20000
r
.
Thus
0 = A′(r) = 2πr −20000
r2
.
We ﬁnd therefore that
r3 = 10000
π
or r = 3√10000/π. Since the problem makes sense for 0 < r < ∞, and
since it clearly has no maximum, we conclude that r =
3√10000/π, h =
3√10000/π.

We calculate that g′(x) = sin x+x cos x and g′′(x) = 2 cos x−x sin x. The
roots of these transcendental functions are best estimated with a calculator
or computer. Figure S3.7 gives an idea of where the extrema and inﬂection
points are located.
8.
We know that v0 = −5 and h0 = 400. Hence
p(t) = −16t2 −5t + 400.
The body hits the ground when
0 = p(t) = −16t2 −5t + 400.
Solving, we ﬁnd that t ≈4.85 seconds.

We see that

x
x2 −1
h′(x) = −x2 + 1
(x2 −1)2
h′′(x) = 2x(x2 + 3)
(x2 −1)3
We see that the function is undeﬁned at ±1, decreasing everywhere, and
has an inﬂection point only at 0. The sketch is shown in Fig. S3.9.

We know that
V = 4π
3 r3.
Therefore
dV
dt = 4π
3 · 3r2 dr
dt .
Using the values V = 36π, r = 3, dV/dt = −2, we ﬁnd that
−2 = 4π · 32 · dr
dt
hence
dr
dt = −1
18π in. per sec.

The acceleration due to gravity, near the surface of the earth, is about
−32 ft/sec2 regardless of the mass of the object being dropped. The two
stones will strike the ground at the same time.
12.
He can drop a rock into the well and time how long it takes the rock to strike
the water. Then he can use the equation
p(t) = −16t2 + 0t + h0
to solve for the depth. If the well is very deep, then he will have to know
the speed of sound and compensate for how long it takes the splash to reach
his ears.
13.
Refer to Fig. S3.13 to see the geometry of the situation.
Let (x, y) be the point where the rectangle touches the line. Then the area
of the rectangle is
A = x · y.
But of course 3x + 5y = 15 or y = 3 −(3/5)x. Hence
A = x · [3 −(3/5)x].
We may differentiate and set equal to zero to ﬁnd that x = 5/2 and y = 3/2
is the solution to our problem.
14.
Let s be a side of the base and let h be the height. The area of the base is s2
and the same for the top. The area of each side is s · h. Thus the cost of the
base and top is
C1 = [s2 + s2] · 10 cents

Chapter 3
285
x
y
Fig. S3.13
while the cost of the sides is
C2 = 4(s · h) · 20 cents.
We ﬁnd that the total cost is
C = C1 + C2 = 20s2 + 80sh.
(∗)
But
100 = volume = s2 · h
hence
h = 100/s2.
Substituting this last formula into (∗) gives
C(s) = 20s2 + 80s · [100/s2] = 20s2 + 8000
s
.
We may calculate that
0 = C′(s) = 40s −8000
s2 .
Solving for s gives the solution s ≈5.8479 and then h ≈2.9241.

We see that the equation for the position of a falling body will now be
p(t) = −20
2 t2 + v0t + h0.
It is given that v0 = 0 and h0 = 100. Hence
p(t) = −10t2 + 0t + 100.
The body hits the surface when
0 = p(t) = −10t2 + 100.
This occurs at time t =

Let R(t) denote the amount of substance present at time t. Let noon on
January 10 correspond to t = 0 and noon on February 10 correspond to
t = 1. Then R(0) = 5 and R(1) = 3. We know that
R(t) = P · eKt.
Since
5 = R(0) = P · eK·0,
we see that P = 5. Since
3 = R(1) = 5 · eK·1,
we ﬁnd that K = ln 3/5. Thus

Let the amount of bacteria present at time t be

Let t = 0 be 10:00 a.m. We know that B(0) = 10000 and B(3) = 15000.
Thus
10000 = B(0) = P · eK·0
so P = 10000. Also
15000 = B(3) = 10000 · eK·3
hence
K = 1
3 · ln(3/2).
As a result,
