use system for writing online repair manuals. The 
iFixiteers helped us adapt the platform for use as 
a project website. 
 Make: Projects is collaborative, not only in the 
sense that individuals can create and improve on 
how-to instructions, but also in the sense that com-
munities (hackerspaces, collectives, educators, and 
so on) can share their own projects and contribute 
to the creation of the ultimate makers’ manual.
 We invite you try Make: Projects. Start by taking 
a look at the dozens of great projects we’ve already 
seeded there, such as a green surfboard, a spy 
microphone, and a wind turbine. You can make 
changes to any of the articles by clicking the Edit 
button. Or click Make A New Project, and start writ-
ing instructions for something entirely new. 
 Make: Projects is currently in beta, a work in 
progress, which means we need your help and your 
ideas to maximize its potential. Please send your 
feedback to us at projects@makezine.com.
 We’re looking forward to your contributions!
H
aving built seven cigar box guitars over 
the past couple years (see my how-to in 
MAKE Volume 21), I wanted to try building 
a battery-powered cigar box amplifier. 
 Naturally, I referred to our Cracker Box Amplifier
project in MAKE Volume 09. And when I visited 
makezine.com to read the comments about the 
project, I discovered that several readers had posted 
additional instructions and clarifications that really 
helped me understand how to build the amp.
 This experience drove home our belief that 
MAKE’s readers are our most important resource. In 
addition to writing our how-to articles, our readers 
often improve on those projects after we print them. 
But there hasn’t been a well-defined place online to 
document these modified instructions, so readers 
tended to post them on their own blogs or other 
non-obvious places.
 That’s why we’re so excited about Make: Projects 
(makeprojects.com), our brand new beta library 
of project instructions written by you, the readers. 
We’re developing Make: Projects in partnership 
with the folks behind ifixit.com, a powerful, easy-to-

Dwight can instantly let ski patrol, Copper Mountain 
staff, and the people zipping down the slopes know 
which trails to hit.
Whether you’re building a status system for an 
entire mountain or just wirelessly reaching across

Brian Melani (MAKE engineering intern) lives in Rohnert Park, Calif., and has a pet snake 
named Legato. He got into “building and designing various things from a very young age, 
when my father would bring home stuff from work for me to take apart so I could see how it 
works.” He has many hobbies but is most involved in FIRST Robotics and machining. In his 
free time, one of the projects he’s working on is an LED dot-matrix display using a few PIC 
microcontrollers. Brian is a student at Santa Rosa Junior College, but his goal is to transfer 
to Cal Poly to earn degrees in mechanical and aerospace engineering.
Contributors
John Keatley (cover photography) settled in Seattle by way of Northern California,
trading steady sunshine for sun breaks. He specializes in advertising and editorial portrait 
photography with a diverse group of clients, and is frequently traveling for work. He’s a 
huge baseball and soccer fan — the Dodgers come first, but the Mariners have been added 
to the list since he moved to Seattle. He and his wife recently became the proud parents of 
a baby girl, whom they take on walks to the beach near their house as often as possible. In 
summer, John can be found skimboarding at low tide.
Jamie O’Shea (Immaculate Telegraphy) is an artist living in New York City. He creates 
inventions to test the boundaries of the impossible and impractical. He usually fiddles with 
memory, light, and time, and lately he can’t stop thinking about all that extra gravity out 
there. Jamie creates his work at the Eyebeam Art & Technology Center and frequently looks 
for excuses to go play in the woods.
J. Tregre (Mystery Electronic Switches) is an electrical design engineer and Star Trek model 
builder. Originally from New Orleans and a graduate of Louisiana Tech, he lives in the Dallas 
area, where he has worked for Texas Instruments as a submicron failure analysis engineer. 
He’s affiliated with the IPC Designers Council, IEEE Reliability Society, and IEEE Electro-
magnetic Compatibility Society. For fun, he designs futuristic LED lighting effects circuits 
for his very large-scale Star Trek models. You can see more at buildingultimatemodels.com.
While in the fifth grade, Matthew Gryczan (Gyrocar) completed his first invention: 
a “talking matchbox” that produced spooky sounds to mystify people attending a séance.
Equally practical projects soon followed, such as a chocolate milk mixing machine using 
a tin can for a brain, and a spinthariscope that makes radiation visible. He’s written a 
book on how to win carnival games, served as a newspaper reporter and editor, and 
worked as an engineer specializing in electrochemical machining. Based in Grand Rapids, 
Mich., Matt now operates a public relations firm for science and technology issues.
3ric Johanson (Mosquito Zapper) has been a hacker for many years. He’s been involved 
with several successful projects, most of which he can’t talk about and which never
really happened. What we do know is that he’s designed and built a system that shoots 
mosquitoes with lasers. His past work includes excessive voltages, ShmooCon, Hackerbot 
Labs (a Seattle-based hackerspace), Vend-O-Rand, and rainbow tables. By day, he is a
project scientist and entropy generator at Intellectual Ventures Laboratory; by night, he’s 
been spotted wearing his “so sue me already” T-shirt while drinking overcaffeinated
coffee. His hobbies include building and breaking things in secret underground lairs.

READER INPUT
  MAKE Volume 21 (Desktop Manufacturing) is 
brilliant — I’m subscribing. As an engineer in the 
mid-90s, I drove usage of tools like SLA, SLS, and 
NC machining to create rapid prototypes, and they 
quickly showed their benefit in lower cost, better 
and faster design iterations, and improved under-
standing. It’s awesome to see these tools getting to 
a broader community — it will allow more creativity, 
capability, and fun!        —Jeff Zemsky, Glenmont, N.Y.
  “The Revolution Will Be Squirted” (Volume 21) 
was a bit too rosy about the CupCake CNC. The 
article does a good job of pointing out its major 
differences from commercial offerings, but not its 
shortcomings, such as the quality of the objects 
it outputs. The article does state that it uses a 
0.3mm filament, but fails to show a close-up shot 
to reveal the objects’ coarseness and irregularity. 
 Another shortcoming is repeatability. Running 
a print is hit-or-miss. A part can degenerate halfway 
through because the open-loop motion control is 
drifting or the filament’s properties have changed.
 Hopefully this article will spur many readers to 
join the desktop manufacturing revolution. I just 
wish it didn’t sound so much like a promotional 
piece for MakerBot Industries.
—Charles Erignac, Seattle, Wash.
EDITOR’S REPLY: Thanks for the clarifications. We could 
have shown finer detail, but with its typical 0.37mm 
layer thickness, the CupCake isn’t about ultra-precision 
— it’s about rapid prototyping, invention, and fun.
  MAKE has changed my life and the lives 
of my children, and a few hundred kids at their 
grade school. I built the electrostatic generator 
(“Remaking History,” Volume 21) and presented 
it — you should have heard the kids gasp when just 
turning a PVC handle with some rabbit fur made 
a piece of neon tubing light up. They couldn’t wait 
to line up and get shocked by the Leyden jar.
 My kids can’t wait for Saturdays when we get
to build.                                   —Ron White, Helena, Mt.
  I found “Instant Paddle” (Volume 21) intriguing
— a new and simple way to construct a paddle. 
However, as a woodworker I was shocked at the 
unsafe router technique shown. When rounding over 
the corners of thin stock, the safe way is to securely 
mount the router in a router table with a fence. The 
fence guides your stock and also “hides” the majority 
of the router bit, keeping your fingers safe. The use of 
feather boards would make the procedure even safer.
 I built a basic router table (wordsnwood.com/ 
2007/p.rt) for about $20. Pat Warner’s website 
(patwarner.com) is dedicated to routing and router 
tables; a Google search will produce dozens more.
—Art Mulder, contributing editor, Canadian Home 
Workshop magazine, London, Ontario 
  My student teams in the Destination 
ImagiNation program (idodi.org) have used MAKE’s 
ideas to help them succeed. In this video (makezine.
com/go/di), one of my teams uses two “Boom 
Sticks” (Volume 13) to make loud cannon booms 
during their pirate skit.
—Jeff Harris, Delano, Minn.
MAKE AMENDS
On our “Traditional Cigar Box Guitar” (Volume 21) the
tuners were mounted upside down. Flip them so the 
string tension pulls the shaft toward the gear. Thanks 
to Bill Ludeman of Palatka, Fla., for spotting our error.
In the breadboard diagram for “Motion-Sensitive 
Camera Trap” (Volume 22), the LEDs should be wired 
to ground (not power), and the wire from pin 10 should 
meet a blue LED’s positive lead (it overshot by one 
hole). The corrected diagram is at makezine.com/22/
cameratrap. Also, 3 standoffs and 6 screws are needed 
to mount the Arduino.
In “Puzzle of the Crowned Pulleys” (Volume 22),
Figure C was misinterpreted. In fact the upper edge
of the cylindrical pulley (line b) is not parallel to line
a, and line b is not perpendicular to the incoming
portion of the belt. Thanks to reader Miguel Dimase
of Buenos Aires, Argentina, for catching our slip.

entertaining (and pedagogically efficient) about watching someone start with a pile o’ parts and a bright 
idea, and end up with a working widget. We learn, and we live vicariously the excitement of creating.
 MAKE has built up an impressive library of instructional video series on our website, on a breadth of
DIY topics and projects. Here are a few highlights — explore makezine.com for many more.
 Weekend Projects Since 2006, hosts Bre Pettis 
and Kip Kay have shown how to make everything 
from a rodent-powered nightlight to a Rubik’s-

MAKING TROUBLE
BY SAUL GRIFFITH
Smiley Face Technologies
 T
here are innumerable things to make one 
depressed these days. Oil spills, a dysfunctional 
economy, worsening political extremism, and 
an awful long-term environmental outlook.
 Fortunately for me, I have an antidote that keeps 
me upbeat, something special and beautiful that 
keeps me optimistic about the human condition, the 
human mind, and the power of thinking. I apparently 
have a high enough public profile that I receive some-
thing like “fan mail.” People share their ideas with me. 
 Many are just ideas — not well-developed, and 
thousands of hours and many over-turnings of the 
original idea away from becoming an idea that will 
change the world in the manner in which the thinker 
hopes. Which is not to say they’re bad ideas;
I don’t think any ideas are bad. Ideas are just ideas, 
things to play with, things to inspire, thought experi-
ments. “Wouldn’t it be cool if?” “If only I had a ...” 
“The world really needs a ... !”
 I get all these ideas sent to me, but I’m not sure 
what people think I’m going to do with them. I’m 
struggling to get through my own pile of ideas!
I keep mine in a stack of numbered notebooks, and 
look at them every New Year’s Eve to remind myself 
that there is more to do next year, including ignoring 
a lot of the ideas that were good at the time but silly 
upon reflection.
 A lot of the ideas people send me are accompa-
nied with a note: “I hope you can do something with 
this idea. I don’t have the resources, but I know the 
world needs it.” I really, really love those — but more 
on that later. The ideas I don’t like are the ones with 
a note like this: “I have this idea, and it’s so good, 
you’ll have to promise me all sorts of things before 
I tell you about my idea.” No thanks. Keep your idea 
and your paranoia and don’t send me intellectual 
extortion of that kind.
 To all the people who send me ideas saying, 
“Please do something with this idea,” I thank you. 
I can’t promise you that I’ll do something with them 
(like I said before, I’m struggling with my own), but 
I thank you anyway. And the next best thing is to 
celebrate you and your ideas. Congratulations! You 
have ideas, and what’s more, you have generosity. 
You could just sit at home and watch television, but 
you don’t. You tinker about, having ideas.
 One of my favorite correspondents is a fellow in 
prison. Yes, prison. I don’t know what he did to get 
there (let’s assume it was an unpaid traffic infringe-
ment), but here’s the thing: he’s a guy, in prison. 
Society has given him the ultimate “no thank-you” 
and locked him up. But from within that prison, he 
still has the audacity, and the hope, to have ideas. 
Not ideas for him to escape prison — no, these are 
his ideas that he feels could benefit humanity!
 And right there is the reason my eyes well up with 
every one of these letters.  People believe that their 
ideas can help the world. And they do! There is noth-
ing more beautiful, more generous, more hopeful. 
 To all of you out there with ideas, I salute you. 
Keep having those ideas. Some of those ideas will 
make it. Some of them will cure cancer. Some of 
them will make a better dishwasher. Your hope is 
mine, the hope that with the collection of our ideas, 
good and ill-formed, we’ll make the world a better 
place for us and our children to live in.
 I have a wonderful friend, Dan Paluska. He has 
ideas — lots of them. He’s got some wisdom, too. 
He categorizes the world of technology and ideas 
into two kinds: good practical ideas and technolo-
gies (things you use every day), and “smiley face 
technologies.” I love the very concept of the latter. 
When I first heard him describe it, I naturally asked, 
what are these smiley face technologies? He said, 
“The Slinky, Pac-Man, rubber duckies — you know, 
the things that aren’t necessarily useful for anything 
other than putting a smile on your face.“
 So here’s what I ask. Don’t just concentrate on 
good, practical ideas for saving a small or large piece 
of the world. Be sure to include the odd “smiley face 
technology.” If we’re going to celebrate any ideas at 
all, we should also celebrate the ones that have no 
purpose other than making us smile. We do have a lot 
of problems that need ideas, but we shouldn’t be so 
serious about humanity’s purpose as to forget that 
making people smile and inventing silly things might 
actually be the highest purpose of all.

Developer Program, make it, then send it to Apple 
and pray. If Apple smiles on you, you can send your 
hack to the world. If Apple frowns on you, you cannot.
 What’s more, Apple uses code signing to restrict 
which apps can run on the iPad (and iPhone): if your 
app isn’t blessed by Apple, iPads will refuse to run 
it. Not that it’s technically challenging to defeat this 
code signing, but doing so is illegal, thanks to the 
1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which makes 
it a crime to circumvent a copyright-protection 
technology. So the only app store — or free reposi-
tory — that can legally exist for Apple’s devices is 
the one that Apple runs for itself.
 Some people say the iPad is a new kind of device: 
an appliance instead of a computer. But because 
Apple chose to add a thin veneer of DRM to the 
iPad, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act applies 
here, something that’s not true of any “appliance” 
you’ve ever seen. It’s as if Apple built a toaster that 
you can only use Apple’s bread in (or face a lawsuit), 
or a dishwasher that will only load Apple’s plates.
 Apple fans will tell you that this doesn’t matter. 
Hackers can simply hack their iPads or shell out 
$99 to get the developer license. But without a 
means of distributing (and receiving) hacks from all 
parties, we’re back in the forbidden-knowledge Dark 
Ages — the poverty-stricken era in which a mere 
handful of ideas was counted as a fortune.

 W
hen I was a grub, we traded in forbidden 
knowledge: “If you unscrew the receiver 
on a pay phone and short the screws on 
the back of the speaker by touching them to the 
chrome on the side of the phone, you get an open 
dial tone.” 
 Or: “Here is how you fold an origami crane.” Or: 
“Thus and so and thus and so, and now you’ve
taken the motor out of your old tape recorder and 
attached it to your Meccano set.” Or: “If you POKE  
this address on your Commodore PET, you’ll shut 
the machine down.” The knowledge diffused slowly, 
and each newly discovered crumb was an excite-
ment and cause for celebration.
 Today, as a nearly senescent 38-year-old, I look 
back on that period with a kind of wonder and 
dismay. I knew ten interesting things I could do with 
the gadgets, devices, and materials around me, and 
I thought myself rich. I knew that the Whole Earth 
Catalog, the Amok catalog, Paladin Press, and other 
purveyors of big secrets could send me dozens of 
new interesting things in mere weeks.
 Thinking on my collection of hacks in those dim, 
pre-internet days, I’m reminded of the book fanciers 
of the Middle Ages who might, in a lifetimes, amass 
five or ten books and think themselves well-read.
 Because, of course, today I have millions of hacks 
and tips and tricks and ideas at my fingertips, thanks 
to the internet and the tools that run on top of it. 
When I invent or discover something, I immediately 
put it on the net. And when I find myself in a corner 
of the world that is not to my liking, I Google up 
some hack that someone else has put on the net 
and apply it or adapt it to my needs.
 Making, in short, is not about making. Making is 
about sharing. The reason we can make so much 
today is because the basic knowledge, skills, and 
tools to make anything and do anything are already 
on the ground, forming a loam in which our inspira-
tion can germinate.
 Consider the iPad for a moment. It’s true that 
Apple’s iTunes Store has inspired hundreds of 
thousands of apps, but every one of those apps is 
contingent on Apple’s approval. If you want to make 
something for the iPad, you pay $99 to join the
Cory Doctorow’s latest novel is Makers (Tor Books U.S., 
HarperVoyager U.K.). He lives in London and co-edits the 
website Boing Boing.

The R2-D2 that Daniel Deutsch built at age 14 pretty 
much charted his career in movie props and anima-
tronics. It also foretold the day he would cruise the 
streets in his own full-sized, drivable landspeeder. 
 Deutsch, 43, moved to Orlando, Fla., in 1987 to 
work for Disney, and was soon tapped to build the 
R2-D2 that has appeared for years at Walt Disney 
World. He’s created dozens of mechanical animated 
characters since then.
 Today he does custom design and fabrication, 
out of a shop with “all the toys we need to fabricate 
anything”: a multi-axis CNC mill, a laser cutter, 
chrome-plating equipment, and the Dimension 
1200 3D printer and NextEngine 3D scanner he 
bought from Jay Leno. “We recently were sent the 
original stunt Ark from [Raiders of the Lost Ark] to 
be re-gold-plated — that was a really cool project! 
A piece of cinematic history,” he enthuses. 
 Deutsch invented Tireflys, those little LED lights 
that screw into tire valve stems, and lately he’s been 
developing special effects using soap bubbles.
 In 2007 he got the idea to build his landspeeder. 
“I realized that nobody had built a faithful replica of 
the speeder that would actually drive. So, why not?”
 With its electric motor and aluminum chassis, 
Deutsch’s three-wheeled speeder will do 30mph. To 
make the body, his team of five designed a “buck” 
model in CAD, laser-cut it from wood, and filled out 
its curves with urethane foam. Then they cast the 
final parts in fiberglass and resin. The side grills are 
water-jet-cut PVC, and the windshield is PET plastic 
vacuum-formed over a drape mold. 
 For the fanboys, Deutsch and colleague “Super 
Ted” Hyde added digital sound effects and engine 
lights. The build was done in six weeks, just in time
to debut at the Star Wars Celebration IV convention 
in Los Angeles. 
 But wait. Star Wars Celebration V is this August
in Orlando. Is Deutsch working on anything special?  
“I intend to have a full-scale replica of the speeder 
bike done before the event,” he says. “Although this 
time it won’t be drivable.”

Kinetic light sculptor Jason Krugman has followed 
a circuitous path to success. Raised in Boston, the 
27-year-old recent graduate of NYU’s Interactive 
Telecommunications Program (ITP) obtained 
a bachelor’s degree in economics from Tufts 
University and spent two years working on Wall 
Street before leaving to pursue art full-time.
 “I wanted a skill set that wasn’t so disparate,” 
says Krugman, “allowing me [to do] creative and 
commercial work at once.” 
 His first project — the needy Single White Android 
— was an instant hit, and his interest in nature’s 
intricacies paved the way for larger, more organic 
pieces. “I really like the slogan, ‘It is what it does,’” 
says Krugman. “LEDs or resistors, they have very 
basic functions, but are also aesthetically enticing.” 
 This is apparent in Firefly 1440, a wind-actuated 
8'×20' display comprised of 40 individual plexiglass 
panels and 1,440 LED/switch pairs. “The entire 
piece is a massive array of sensors and outputs,” he 
says. As wind encounters it, switches activate each 
LED individually, forming dancing light patterns 
based on the wind’s force, timing, and direction.
 “My goal is to produce work that’s intensely stim-
ulating to the senses,” says Krugman. “Firefly looks 
complicated, but what’s happening is simple.” 
 Firefly 1440 is intended for large outdoor spaces 
like building exteriors and bridges, though it 
remains under development. 
 “I’m in the process of pushing the pieces I’ve 
made to the limits,” he says, “to see where and how 
they will fail.” Next he’ll add metal plating to the LED 
legs, to increase weather resistance. 
 Encouraged by recent interest in his work (Firefly 
1440 was shown at the All Points West festival in 
Jersey City, N.J., and Firefly 870 is on display at 
the New York Hall of Science in Flushing, Queens), 
Krugman plans to approach building owners, archi-
tects, and museums about realizing site-specific 
installations. Most of his recent work, including
LED mesh chandeliers, is available for sale on a 
customized basis.                                 —Laura Kiniry

Sculptor Christopher Fennell prefers to use mate-
rials that have been cast out by society, so the idea 
of creating a bus stop shelter out of actual retired 
buses seemed like a natural. 
 Fennell responded to a call for bus stop designs 
by the city of Athens, Ga., with a vision of a shelter 
that would look like a moving bus in stop-motion 
photography, and would utilize large pieces from 
three old school buses. 
 Scavenging for old school buses to use wasn’t 
without adventure. “I ended up in someone’s front 
yard cutting off bus sections and briefly catching 
his lawn on fire,” recalls Fennell.
 The most challenging part of the project was 
retaining the distinguishing markings, such as 
bus numbers and serial numbers, because it was 
important to Fennell that he maintain as much of 
the buses’ original history and charm as possible.
 Like all his sculptures, Fennell’s bus stop is made 
almost entirely of recycled materials. Part of the 
project build is documented in a video on YouTube 
that shows the scaffolding, crane, and heavy lifting 
required to assemble the large bus sections.
 Residing now in Birmingham, Ala., Fennell 
received a degree in mechanical engineering from 
the University of South Florida and worked in robot-
ics and aerospace before deciding to go back to 
school to study sculpture.
 “Making engaging public art was more challeng-
ing for me than designing flight simulators at my 
engineering job,” Fennell says about the unorthodox 
career change. 
 Fennell’s engineering background comes in 
handy for figuring out the structural challenges of 
his massive sculptures, however. Bus Stop Shelter 
is actually a small piece for Fennell, whose work 
verges on the colossal. For his next project he’s 
looking for 44 truck chassis to make into a 63-foot-
long guitar for the location where Elvis performed 
his first concert. We can’t wait to see the video of 
that one.

In a hallway of the National Aquarium in Baltimore, 
a boy stares, entranced by a long glass mural that 
shows sea lions diving in the waves. He’s discovered 
that as he walks, the creatures swim along with him.
 The animated mural is the work of Rufus Butler 
Seder, an inventor, filmmaker, and artist whose 
interactive panels or Lifetiles can be found in 
museums and public spaces across the United 
States — from the Smithsonian, where he’s brought 
Duke Ellington to life at the keyboard, to Zoo Miami, 
where he’s set toucans and anacondas gliding 
through an Amazonian jungle.
 Seder constructs his pieces like mosaics, assem-
bling anywhere from a handful to hundreds of tiles, 
which he casts in his Boston foundry. 
 The process is meticulous and time-consuming — 
a mural can take up to six months — but the underly-
ing principle draws on the same low-tech techniques 
used in lenticular art (e.g. those animated cards in 
Cracker Jack boxes) or flipbooks. 
 “Anything that creates the illusion of motion 
without electricity or motors has always fascinated 
me,” Seder explains, and he cites his collection of 
antique zoetropes and optical toys as inspiration.
 Seder starts by breaking a motion sequence into 
several digital images. On the computer, he slices 
each image into super-thin vertical stripes, then 
merges all the images into one frame that he then 
sandblasts onto the back of a glass tile. 
 The front of each tile has a ribbed pattern that 
acts as a lens, magnifying and revealing the sliced 
images underneath, one at time. When viewed 
rapidly in succession, the images appear to move. 
 For his next project, Seder brings his optical 
magic to San Francisco with an animated mural of 
the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge — just in 
time for the 75th anniversary of the legendary span.

Pink knitted motorcycle cozies and tool belts may 
not be the stuff that boys or girls dream of, but for 
Theresa Honeywell they speak to both her femi-
nine and masculine sides. Plus, they look great.
 “It makes things more interesting to contrast 
opposites,” she says. “Whether it’s textures (hard 
vs. soft) or mediums (metal vs. knitting) or ideas 
(masculine vs. feminine, or crafts vs. Art).”
 While getting a master’s degree at Tennessee’s 
Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts, Honeywell 
explored her macho side using “feminine” arts such 
as knitting and embroidery. Tattoos and “lowbrow 
art” were represented in colorful thread and yarn.
 She found her first Kawasaki in a junkyard. “I was 
very particular about the style of bike; I wanted an 
early-80s, rugged macho-bike,” she remembers.
 Honeywell, who lives in Jacksonville, Fla., began 
with machine guns and handguns, then tools and tool 
belts, a jackhammer, an electric guitar, and finally the 
Knit Motorcycle Series. She’s knit three motorcycles 
to date, and embroidered hundreds of tattoos. 
 “The tattoos that I stitch are typically macho-
associated icons, but I’m redrawing them out of 
thread — a softer and typically domestic-associated 
material,” she says. “The images are based on 
vintage tattoo imagery, and my designs are made in 
the similar labor-intense way that a tattoo is made.”
 Each piece of tattooed embroidery takes about 
two weeks to complete, the knitted pieces even lon-
ger. “The motorcycles can take up to two months,” 
she says. “Many people are shocked at the time 
involved, but the labor process is a huge conceptual 
part of the piece. I am a woman using domestic 
techniques to change the appearance and associa-
tions of typically masculine-associated objects.”
 Honeywell’s work has been displayed in San 
Francisco, New York, and lots of places in between. 
Next up is the Country Club Plaza in Kansas City, 
Mo., where she’s planning a few surprises. “I would 
love to do something really large and crazy; maybe 
a bulldozer or something for tearing up the ground 
or buildings,” she says.

Dale Sander proudly continues the amateur tele-
scope maker’s tradition of building upon the work of 
others. Sander’s latest innovative design, which he 
calls a “truss telescoping telescope,” was inspired 
partly by his friend Tom Noe, who built the first tele-
scoping Dob scope that Sander had ever seen. 
 John Dobson is credited with popularizing the 
type of large, portable, easy-to-make telescopes that 
became known as Dobsonian telescopes (or “Dobs”) 
and are now a mainstay of amateur astronomy. 
 Dobson admits he didn’t invent anything par-
ticularly novel; his telescope design was based 
on military cannon mounts that had been in use 
for hundreds of years.
 Sander, 58, had already built two Dob telescopes 
that used detachable four-pole support systems, but 
he was looking to design a new one that was even 
easier to set up and move around. 
 Using mostly parts left over from previous tele-
scope projects, along with some high-quality Baltic 
birch plywood, six camera tripod legs, and a Lycra 
spandex shroud, Sander created a truss-based 
telescope that’s his most lightweight and easy-to-
assemble model to date.
 “Many people buy telescopes only to find out they
are too difficult to move and too slow to set up, so 
the scopes just sit in their closet unused,” Sander 
points out. 
 For this reason, his primary design criteria were 
light weight, for easy portability, and fast setup 
time. He achieved both: the 10-inch truss telescope 
weighs in at a slender 38 pounds and can be set up 
in approximately 1 minute. 
 A longtime amateur astronomer, Sander lives and 
stargazes in Dallas, where he works as a printing 
press operator. He’s been making telescopes since 
he was 8 years old. Not surprisingly, Sander has 
posted meticulous build notes and photos online 
so that others can build on his work.

“We squeezed and squeezed and squeezed!” say 
Daniela Kostova, 36, and Olivia Robinson, 34, 
former grad students of Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute (RPI). They aren’t talking about making 
OJ — they’re talking about extracting salt from 
sopping T-shirts.
 Kostova and Robinson are the creators of Waste 
to Work, a project exploring sweat as a catalyst for 
energy. Commissioned by the Schenectady Museum, 
the project is inspired by the relationship between 
Schenectady’s General Electric factories (the com-
pany’s former headquarters) and their workers.
 “We saw a connection between sweat used as 
electrolytes for batteries, and as a metaphor for 
labor,” says Robinson. They enrolled in a residency

more about electrochemical principles, tapping into 
a larger network of people working in BioArt, includ-
ing faculty member Robert Linhardt, developer of a 
supercapacitor that runs on blood, sweat, and urine. 
 Waste to Work’s first phase ran at the museum in 
2008 and was made of 250 galvanic cell batteries, 
each connected through artery-like wires to an illu-
minated LED map based on a NASA satellite photo 
of the Earth at night.
 They crafted the batteries from recycled containers, 
artist charcoal (carbon), nails (zinc), and sweat, which 
they gathered through random T-shirt exchanges at 
construction sites, saunas, and parades.
 At the opening, audience members could activate 
the batteries — and light up sections of the map 
— using a turkey baster. “Two things became appar-
ent,” says Kostova. “People were amazed at how [the 
world’s] electricity use is concentrated, and [they 
were] really grossed out by each other’s sweat.”
 For the second phase, Robinson and biomed 
students at Syracuse University prototyped a wear-
able integration of the batteries that doubled as 
a sweat- harvester. Now she’s working on a sweat 
harvesting caravan. Waste to Work will be on exhibit 
— sans body odor — at the Pratt Manhattan Gallery 
in New York City, this fall.

The Infrared Thermometer: 
An Essential Science Gadget
most organic materials, including you and me. But 
shiny metallic surfaces, snow, brick, cotton fabric, 
and other materials may have lower emissivities. 
Some IR thermometers allow the emissivity setting 
to be adjusted so that temperature measurements 
are consistent.
Selecting an IR Thermometer
An online search will lead you to many different IR 
thermometers from a dozen or more manufacturers.
Some are intended mainly for measuring hot 
objects, while others have a much broader temp-
erature response. Because I frequently measure the 
IR temperature of the sky, I prefer IR thermometers 
with the lowest temperature capability, which is 
around –76°F. Most IR thermometers have a mini-
mum range of –20°F to –50°F.
 IR thermometers are specified according to 
their field of view (FOV), which is expressed as a 
distance-to-spot ratio: the ratio of the distance to
a target compared to the diameter of the spot 
viewed by the thermometer. For example, an FOV of 
1:1 means the instrument will be looking at a circle 
1 foot in diameter at a distance of 1 foot. A narrower 
FOV of 30:1 means it will be looking at a 1-foot circle 
at a distance of 30 feet.
 For measuring very large objects, an FOV of from 
1:1 to 10:1 should usually work. For smaller targets, 
select an instrument with an FOV of 30:1 or narrower.
Using an IR Thermometer
Be sure to read the instructions that come with an 
IR thermometer to learn how to operate the display 
backlight (if present), how to switch between Fahr-
enheit and Celsius temperature scales, and how to 
adjust the emissivity.
 Keep in mind that IR thermometers are not 
designed to measure the temperature of shiny 
metal surfaces, which tend to have low emissivity. 
When pointed at objects on the far side of a glass 
window, they’ll measure the temperature of the 
glass. Similarly, steam, smoke, and dust will also 
interfere with temperature measurements. Some 
 Your Science Tool Kit
If you do casual or even serious amateur science, 
you might already have some first-class science 
gadgets in your science tool kit. They might include 
a computer, a digital camera, and a thermometer. 
But do you have an infrared (IR) thermometer? 
 While I’ve spent 20 years measuring sunlight, 
haze, the ozone layer, and the water vapor layer 
using various homemade instruments, a couple of 
IR thermometers are among the most important 
gadgets in my science toolbox.
 IR thermometers allow you to measure the temper-
ature of objects without actually coming in contact 
with them. This is why they’re called noncontact 
thermometers. They’re ideal for basic chores like 
measuring the temperature of car engines, cooking 
surfaces, refrigerators, heaters, and streams and 
lakes. They also have many scientific applications.
IR Thermometers
Everything with a temperature above absolute zero 
emits IR radiation. IR thermometers use a thermal 
sensor such as a miniature thermopile to detect the 
IR emitted by objects. The signal from the sensor 
is corrected for the ambient temperature and sent 
to a digital readout. Some IR thermometers include 
an analog output for use with a data logger. Prices 
vary from $20 up to thousands. The Omega OS540 
shown in this article cost $85; newer versions start 
at $95.
 IR thermometers are usually employed to
measure the temperature of surfaces, which may 
have different emissivities. According to the Hand-
book of Military Infrared Technology (Office of Naval 
Research, 1965), emissivity is the ratio of the IR 
emitted by a surface to the IR that would be emitted 
by a blackbody at the same temperature.
 A blackbody, which may not appear visually black, 
is a perfect absorber and emitter of IR, which means 
it has an emissivity of 1. Most surfaces aren’t per-
fect blackbodies, and their emissivity is less. For this 
reason, most IR thermometers are set for a default 
emissivity of .95, which is close to the emissivity of

of my tiny rural office always leaf out faster than 
their neighbors due to the warmth of the building.
 An IR thermometer is ideal for studying heat 
islands. Instead of simply assuming that an asphalt 
road is warmer than the grass that borders it, you 
can measure the exact temperature of both the 
road and the grass.
 The temperatures of different building materials 
illuminated by full sunlight are of special interest. 
I’ve studied such materials by placing various bricks, 
concrete blocks, wood, and asphalt on a common 
background and measuring their temperatures over 
time. Also interesting are their rates of temperature 
decline when the sun is low in the sky.
» Studying Clouds
Both amateur and professional astronomers use IR 
detectors to detect clouds that might interfere with 
their telescope observations. An IR thermometer 
works well as a cloud detector because the base of 
a cloud is warmer than the clear sky.
 Cumulus clouds form when the temperature of 
moist air falls to the dew point. The temperature 
indicated when an IR thermometer is pointed at the 
base of a low cumulus cloud is often within a few

manufacturers advise that their IR thermometers 
aren’t intended for medical applications or for 
measuring body temperature.
!
CAUTION: Many IR thermometers include
a laser pointer that illuminates the portion of an object
that is being measured. Be careful to avoid pointing the 
thermometer at a person’s face or at shiny surfaces
that might reflect the laser beam into your eyes or 
someone else’s.
Applications for IR Thermometers
There are dozens of applications for IR thermom-
eters, some of which can provide very useful 
scientific information.
» Studying Heat Islands
Heat islands are most often described as the 
dome of warm air that forms when sunlight heats 
buildings, streets, and other manmade things in 
cities. Actually, a heat island can be anything in the 
environment that becomes warmer than its sur-
roundings, including rural roads, gravel, boulders, 
and remote farmhouses.
 You can sometimes see evidence of these heat 
islands, for example, when they cause snow around 
them to melt faster (see my column “Snow Science”

degrees of the dew point measured at the Earth’s 
surface. I’ve also learned that the temperature 
indicated when an IR thermometer is pointed at
the clear zenith sky is well correlated with the total 
water vapor overhead. I’ll soon have two years’ 
worth of water vapor data and will write a scientific 
paper about this finding.
» Energy Conservation and Storage
IR thermometers are very useful for evaluating the 
insulation in houses and other buildings. They’re 
especially good at indicating temperature leakage 
through glass windows, and hot spots in electrical 
wiring.
 An IR thermometer is also useful in developing
solar water heaters. You can quickly try this method 
by placing a gallon of water in a black plastic trash 
bag. Seal the bag and lay it flat on a surface exposed 
to full sun. Measure the temperature of the bag
every minute or two for 30 minutes and plot the 
data to see the increase in temperature over time.
» Other Studies
Plants and animals provide many interesting tem-
perature studies. For example, prickly pear cactus 
pads become much warmer than the leaves of trees 
and most other plants.
 Fire ant hills can easily exceed 100°F on a warm 
day. I recently measured the surface of one at 114°F, 
then removed a 1-inch layer of soil from a portion 
of the hill, which then measured only 92°F. I wanted 
to continue this investigation by going deeper, but 
hundreds of angry fire ants forced my retreat.
Going Further
By now I hope you understand why an IR thermom-
eter is one of the most important gadgets in my 
science kit. The ideas given here merely scratch 
the surface of what can be done with one of these 
remarkable devices, especially if you photograph 
the thermometer readout, as shown in the accom-
panying figures. Chances are you’ll find entirely new 
uses when you begin probing your home, workplace, 
and environment with an IR thermometer.

MAKER’S CORNER
BY DAN WOODS
Summer’s Here
Time to get serious about that long-overdue MAKEcation.
 O
ne comment I hear constantly from makers 
is, “I have more ideas about things I want 
to make or repair than I have time.” Sadly, 
I can relate all too well. Here I am, surrounded by 
hundreds of cool maker-made project kits, amazing 
tools, inspirational makers … but oh, so little time. 
 This summer, I’m doing something about it. The 
Woods family is planning at least two MAKEcations: 
time away from the office, without email or cell-
phones, no Facebook (the horror), and no TV. So 
I polled my Maker Shed comrades: what would make 
for the ultimate MAKEcation with three kids and 
a wife who loves to repair things? What must-have 
tools and kits would you take on a MAKEcation?
Make: Electronics Book 
This book’s cover says it best: “Burn things out, 
mess things up — that’s how you learn.” 
 Charles Platt’s primer for the new electronics 
enthusiast is wildly popular, because it’s all about 
learning electronics by discovery. Start working on 
excellent projects the moment you crack open this 
unique, hands-on book. Build the circuits first, then 
learn the theory behind them. 
 And if your dream MAKEcation is more about 
making and doing than scouring the internet for 
supplies, consider these companion packs to our 
Make: Electronics book. We’ve spent hours sourcing 
these parts so you don’t have to. Pack 1 includes 
everything you need to tackle the first two chapters, 
experiments 1–11. Pack 2 covers experiments 12–24. 
 The awesome thing about these kits is that they 
aren’t limited to just one experiment or outcome, 
but rather support a myriad of different projects. 
Perfect for the aspiring electronics enthusiast.
Deluxe Make: Electronics Toolkit
Do you want to learn to solder? Does someone in 
your family? This toolkit takes the trouble out of 
searching for the right tools. 
 The kit includes everything you need to get 
started in the wonderful world of electronics — 
from a 30-watt adjustable soldering iron to a digital 
multimeter to the Panavise Jr. for holding those 
PCBs while you solder. We even included your first 
project, the WeeBlinky, and a Maker’s Notebook to 
help you document your next project.
ShapeLock
One of the hottest products at Maker Faire! If you 
haven’t played around with ShapeLock yet, you owe 
it to yourself to buy a sack and check it out. 
 ShapeLock is a space-age plastic that melts at 
160°F then remains safely moldable by hand until 
locking rigidly as it cools to room temperature.
 The stuff is reusable (just reheat and remold), 
tough, safe, and nontoxic, and it’s machinable (easy 
to saw, drill, tap, and mill) and paintable (readily
accepts acrylic hobby paints, dyes, and pigments).  
 Prototype your invention right now — without 
machine tools. Create super-strong custom parts, 
prototypes, molds, servo brackets, robot housings, 
sculptures, science projects, and more. No maker 
space or workshop should be without ShapeLock.
Now in all honesty, in their zeal for the MAKEcation 
concept, the Maker Shed crew nominated more 
than a dozen fabulous tools and kits they consid-
ered indispensable for a range of interests. But alas, 
I’m allocated just so many words. For the complete 
list, check out makershed.com/makecation.
 Happy MAKEcationing!

Kid Robot
Young makers are seizing 
breakout opportunities on the 
wild frontier of Detroit.
Hobbyists. That was the keyword Andrew Archer used 
in his help-wanted ad on Craigslist. Andrew needed help 
completing a large robot he was developing for use in 
auto factories. He wanted to target hobbyists who were 
curious and willing to figure things out for themselves. 
Jeff Sturges saw the ad and responded. Like Andrew, Jeff 
had moved to Detroit within the last year.
Andrew was offering only $10 to $12 an hour, 
but Jeff thought it was more interesting than 
any IT job he might find. On the phone, Jeff told 
Andrew about a community meeting for Maker 
Faire Detroit at the Henry Ford Museum that 
Sunday, and they agreed to meet there. That’s 
where I met both of them in January of this year.
Jeff had moved from New York City, where he’d 
been involved in the Sustainable South Bronx 
Fab Lab. In Detroit, he was able to buy a house 
for $500, and he rode his bike around town to 
live on the cheap. Jeff, who grew up in the Boston 
area, has a degree in architecture from Cran-
brook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., 
so he knew the area. He returned hoping to cre-
ate a hackerspace and develop school programs 
to get kids involved in making things.
Andrew had moved to Detroit from Duluth, 
Minn., where he’d started his company, Robotics 
Redefined. He was using off-the-shelf compo-
nents to design new kinds of robots for factories. 
He said he had a dozen contractors working for 
him and had sales worldwide. I had to ask how 
old he was. “Twenty-one,” he said. I immediately 
thought that finding people like Andrew and Jeff 
was a good sign for Detroit, and that makers 
were already connecting with each other.

acqueline Campbell Archer is Andrew’s 
mother and his financial officer. As a single 
mom raising Andrew, she recognized that he had 
unique gifts that amazed and baffled her. “As a 
kid,” she said, “if he went to sharpen his pencil, 
he’d end up taking apart the pencil sharpener.” 
 From age 6, he took over the garage, bringing 
home things from yard sales or dumpsters. 
“Andrew liked anything with a cord,” said 
Jacqueline. Once he hauled home a toilet so 
he could see how it worked. He then turned it 
into a fish tank. She would buy him tools as 
birthday presents. He built a capacitor from 
cookie sheets and mineral oil. 
For a ninth-grade science project, he built a 
two-foot-tall Tesla coil, something his teacher 
didn’t believe he — or anyone his age — could do. 
He did a demonstration in class, and the teacher 
was so afraid of electrocution that he made him 
shut it down. “I was really comfortable that I was 
a person making weird stuff,” said Andrew.
Andrew was mostly bored in school, feeling 
held back from exploring what interested him. 
He didn’t like sports. He didn’t connect easily 
with his peers. He dreamed of building a private 
spacecraft in his garage that would take him 
away to a new world. 
 More practically, he noticed that the rich kids 
in town all had mopeds to get around on. Un-
able to buy one himself, he began hacking one 
together from four bikes and an industrial weed-
whacker engine.
Jacqueline worried about her son. When 
he was young, she had taken him to the Mayo 
Clinic, to consult with specialists. She learned 
that Andrew had a genius-level IQ, but she could 
easily see him dropping out of school or getting 
involved in drugs. She determined that high 
school was not challenging enough for him, and 
she sought to enroll her 14-year-old in courses at 
Lake Superior College. To do that, she had to sue 
the local school board.
One very positive experience for Andrew was 
his involvement in SkillsUSA and its annual 
competitions. In 10th grade, he entered the 
robotics competition and won third place in the 
state. “They gave us a robotic arm and a boxful 
of components to build an automated assembly,” 
recalled Andrew. “You had no knowledge going 
in of what you’d have to build.” The next year he 
was the state champion, traveling to the national 
competition in Kansas. A year later he was the 
national champion, requiring just four of the 
eight hours allotted to complete his project.
Andrew graduated from high school in 2006 
and a year later completed his degree in robotics 
at the community college. He’d already completed 
a degree in machining at 16. “I was planning on 
going to Carnegie Mellon in fall of 2007, but 
I decided not to,” said Andrew. While he liked 
CMU, he didn’t want them owning what he 
worked on as a student. “I decided instead to 
pursue my own thing,” he said, and started his 
robotics company that year.
A
t high-school graduation, Andrew saw his 
biological father, Bryan Fisher, for only the 
second time. Fisher, an inventor, had developed 
industrial baling equipment and built a successful 
company, Excel Manufacturing. 
 From the short time they spent together, 
Andrew thought that the two of them were 
identical. “What he was thinking, I was thinking. 
He’d approach problems the way I’d approach 
problems, and we’d come up with the same 
solutions and say it the exact same way,” said 
Andrew. “It was very strange.”
Nonetheless, Fisher remained distant. He “had 
his own set of issues and stayed away thinking he 
would probably be more of a negative influence 
on Andrew,” said Jacqueline. 
 Both Andrew and Jacqueline say that Fisher 
was consumed with his own success, living life 
in the fast lane. In April of this year, Fisher was 
found murdered in his home, part of a triple 
homicide by a tattoo parlor owner involved in 
selling drugs and running an escort service.
Fisher’s company website said about the 
46-year-old founder: “All who knew Bryan knew 
he possessed an all-consuming passion for power 
and precision, which manifested itself through 
his love of airplanes, cigarette boats, Ducati 
motorcycles, and scary fast sports cars. That 
same passion guided his equipment designs and 
broke the industry mold.”
Andrew visited Excel Manufacturing the week 
after his father’s death to meet his employees and 
take them out for an informal dinner, something 
they said that his father would have done. “I tried 
to take away just the positive things,” said Andrew.

ike his father, Andrew has a fascination with 
motorcycles. On a summer night in 2009, 
Andrew was riding a Ducati Hypermotard and 
hit a broken culvert. “When I crashed, my first 
thought was — oh God, my bike.” 
 He didn’t notice at first that he’d nearly torn 
his thumb off and his foot was crushed. Regard-
less, he rode the motorcycle to the hospital. His 
injuries, which included a lacerated spleen, kept 
him in the ICU for several weeks. Doctors worked 
to reconstruct his foot, and he used a walker for 
the rest of the summer. His planned move to 
Detroit would have to wait until October.
Jacqueline helped Andrew find a place over-
looking the Detroit River in a brick building near 
the downtown area. He set up a small workshop 
where he could work whenever he wanted. 
There’s orange tape on the wooden floor for 
testing some of his line-following robots, and 
his furniture comes from antique stores.
A
fter Andrew connected with Jeff in January 
of 2010, they began working together to 
meet a March deadline for the factory robot. 
“I give everyone a test to find out what they can 
do,” said Andrew. “Jeff got 94% on the test. It’s 
really hard. Electrical engineers coming out of 
school would get about 64% on the test. That 
Jeff did so well is really odd because he has an 
architectural background.”
Jeff, a young 33, started out by assembling 
circuit boards, doing surface-mount assembly, 
and learning how to test the boards. With his 
excellent people skills, he soon began doing 
project management. 
 Jeff also recruited Bilal Ghalib, a maker from 
Ann Arbor, Mich., who organized the All Hands 
Active hackerspace there. Bilal’s job was to 
write the laser-scanner interface for the robot. 
“I just threw him at it,” Andrew said. “I didn’t give 
him any instructions, and he did it.”
Meanwhile, Jeff was also looking to find a place 
in downtown Detroit to set up a hackerspace. On 
a cold March day, he was in the Eastern Market 
district looking at vacant buildings in the old 
meatpacking area. The buildings smelled of dried 
blood and worse, and they were in terrible shape. 
 Pieces of mail were strewn about the floors, 
a good many of them delinquent tax notices. 
Jeff could see only the possibilities for each 
space, believing that they could be transformed. 
He liked the support he was getting from the

the city’s largest farmer’s market and an area in 
need of new occupants now that the butchers

A
ndrew’s nickname for his factory robot is 
the Orange Twinkie. About three feet long 
and a foot-and-a-half tall, the Orange Twinkie 
consists of subsystems for vision, drive, safety, 
and human interface, all tied together by a core 
system running under the Microsoft .Net Micro 
Framework, which is what Andrew programs.
I saw a demonstration of the Orange Twinkie, 
moving autonomously around a test track 
defined by orange tape. Its goal was to approach 
a heavy item, pick it up, and relocate it. All the 
while the robot was busy, it played a chiptune 
from the Nintendo 64 game Mega Man, which 
Bilal had added.
A well-built Lego Mindstorms robot could follow 
tape using a sensor to detect contrast between 
the floor and the tape; however, a factory envi-
ronment is not a typical Lego playfield. The tape 
can be removed easily to disrupt the robot, and 
the robot needs to be able to know if there are 
any obstacles in the way. 
 Andrew’s robot can follow the tape, but it 
also knows what to do if it gets bumped off the 
path. One of its upgrades is a vision system that 
can tell if people are in its path. If pushed away 
from the tape, the robot can reorient itself and 
get back on track. Andrew explained: “We have 
forward-looking vision and see ten feet out. 
We can cross aisles without having to put tape 
there.”
He’s learning about just how harsh the factory 
environment is. The robot will get kicked and 
even abused by workers who don’t like that a 
robot may be doing a job previously done by 
humans. One engineer who’s been in the field for 
20 years told Andrew about examining a dam-
aged robot that had numerous holes drilled in it, 
making it look like Swiss cheese.
The March deadline for the Orange Twinkie 
was set so that a safety inspector from one of 
the auto companies could put the robot through 
a battery of tests. “I am here to try and destroy 
your robot,” he said. 
Andrew couldn’t believe it as the inspector 
slammed the robot, tried to kick in its sensors, 
and pushed against it to spin it violently off its 
path. Andrew perceived it as abuse and took a 
personal dislike to the inspector. 
 Jeff said it was “shocking that the guy took 
incredible pride in trying to defeat what the robot 
wanted to do.” The robot withstood the beating, 
but it didn’t pass all the tests that day.
Andrew knew the robot would perform better 
over time. He was mainly satisfied that he and his 
band of hobbyists worked so well together.
“The hobbyist way is a really effective way to 
do things,” Andrew told me. “We’re utilizing tools 
that are available to everyone.” He wants Robot-
ics Redefined to become a kind of think tank for 
building things. “I’m wanting to do some things 
that are unconventional,” he said with boundless 
enthusiasm.

ing an entrepreneurial community workshop to

Earthworks, a leader in Detroit’s urban agricul-
ture movement. And he’s teaching electronics

been demolished. Charles Brady King, an old friend 
(and the first person to drive a horseless carriage 
on the streets of Detroit) did the detective work 
needed to re-create the little building.
 In a 1932 letter to Ford, King pondered the vast 
changes brought about by his friend’s accomplish-
ment. Marveling at how Ford had achieved such 
success from humble beginnings, King made a 
startling suggestion regarding the power of a work-
space: “Perhaps ‘58 Bagley’ did it. Who knows?”
 A space for storing fuel instead becomes the 
fuel? It’s not too alien a notion for Ford, who, after 
all, regarded the artifacts and buildings he was 
then assembling as capable of teaching “more than 
books will teach.” 
 The re-created Bagley Avenue workshop stands 
not only as testament to the convergence of talents, 
dreams, and fingertip knowledge that played out there 
in 1896, but also as inspiration — and provocation. 
How about your space — where is it pointing you?
The workshop where Henry Ford made his first car. By Marc Greuther
58 Bagley Ave.
A 
workspace, tools, a project or two — hardly 
an unfamiliar scenario for readers of MAKE, 
except that this is Henry Ford’s workshop, 
his first car, and on the bench, his first engine. 
 But not exactly. In fact, the engine and car, even 
the workshop itself, are reproductions.
 The original space, a small brick outbuilding 
behind Ford’s modest house on Detroit’s Bagley 
Avenue, was intended to store coal and wood. Ford 
established a workshop there and equipped it with 
a small lathe, drill press, and basic tools. After read-
ing about an engine design in American Machinist 
he decided to build a vehicle he came to call the 
Quadricycle; his neighbor, fascinated by the project, 
allowed expansion into his half of the structure. 
 In early June 1896 — the precise date is uncertain 
— the finished vehicle was ready for its first run. 
The workshop’s door onto the alley, too narrow for 
the now fully assembled vehicle, was swiftly modi-
fied with the help of a handy axe.
 By the time Henry Ford began to collect historic 
buildings for Greenfield Village — his educational 
site in Dearborn, Mich. — the original workshop had

and everywhere — alleys in Brooklyn, farm ﬁ elds 
in Wisconsin, even in the lonely deserts of Arizona. 
Most of the gear is homemade, a lot of the materials 
for melting are either scrap metal or donated, 
and almost all the labor comes free with the iron-
pouring community.
 Some cupolas are custom fabricated, while 
others are repurposed objects such as water 
heaters or garbage cans. Basically anything that’s 
tube-shaped will work, as long as you can line it 
with 3 inches of high-temperature refractory mate-
rial. Add a few tuyeres (holes for blasting air), one 
spout for slag and another for the metal to tap out 
of, and a trap door on the bottom, and you’ve got 
an iron furnace. I’ve even seen a soda can used as 
a cupola. 
 Once you have the cupola, you ﬁ ll it up with bits 
of iron and enough charges of black, chunky coke

racking iron is one of the most difﬁ cult, 
labor-intensive processes in art making. 
Busting up old cast-iron bathtubs and
radiators into little pieces with a sledgehammer 
can be very taxing on an artist’s delicate hands. 
 When I ﬁ rst went to art school, the counselors 
told me to take a life drawing class or a pottery 
class because they’re so calming. But I’m pretty 
sadistic, and I like to smash things and set things 
on ﬁ re, so by the end of my ﬁ rst year I found myself 
down in the dark dungeon known as the foundry, 
pulverizing iron so that we could melt it down and 
make some sculpture.
 In the past 30 years or so, cast-iron art has 
grown into a vast, nationwide network of artists 
building their own iron-melting furnaces. These 
furnaces, known as cupolas, are taken to get-
togethers called iron pours that are held anywhere

and limestone to melt the metal, at which point a 
steel spike is driven into the tap spout, releasing 
the clay plug holding back the well of molten iron. 
 Then sweet, glowing orange metal comes spew-
ing into a ladle and is poured into premade sand 
molds which are usually made at a mold-making 
workshop the week before. Patterns for molds can 
be abstract or representational, as small as a belt 
buckle or as large as a cannon.
 Pours are usually two-day events. The ﬁ rst day 
is for setting up all the portable gear, lighting the 
furnace in the evening, and melting iron until all the 
molds are ﬁ lled. The night culminates in the ever-
popular “dropping bottom,” where the trap door 
in each cupola is kicked open and all the white-hot 
coke and slag comes ﬂ aming out, relieving the 
furnace of the high temperatures. This is the most 
ﬁ ery spectacle for a gathering of pyromaniacs, and 
usually the most popular with photographers. 
 Everything is left to cool overnight (most partici-
pants camp nearby), and in the morning, individuals 
break apart their sand molds to check out how well 
the metal cast. The castings are packed up to be 
cleaned and polished later, and everything else is 
broken down and put away for the next pour.

 I initially got into metal casting as a way of
making art but ended up discovering a whole
community of makers. And as satisfying as it is
to drive a sledgehammer through an old bathtub, 
it’s all about producing work. 
 In 2008, with the help of some friends, I built a 
furnace and started an annual pour at the Broc Allen 
Ceramics Studio in northern Wisconsin near where
I grew up, on the south shore of Lake Superior. It’s
a small pour, but it has a good vibe, and it’s nice
having control over how much metal I can actually 
cast (a lot of pours have weight limits). 
 And this last spring, the School of the Art Institute 
of Chicago (SAIC), where I ﬁ rst learned casting, 
had its 20th annual Lake Bluff Iron Pour. It was a 
three-day event, ﬁ lled with ﬁ re performances, a chili 
cook-off (I won for Hottest Chili), and a people-
powered cupola trolley blasted with bellows made 
of old foundry leathers. I even got to make some art.

 Hackers seem to love the fact that Club-Mate 
keeps them up at night without the crashes and
jitters that accompany other energy drinks. “The 
buzz just slowly dissipates and you can go to sleep 
if you need to,” Goldstein explains.
 At the same time, the beverage has a taste that 
the most adventurous of foodies would describe as 
unique. Many people find it repulsive when they first 
taste it, and yet, Club-Mate has found legions of 
fans around the world.
 Manufactured in Münchsteinach, Germany, by 
Brauerei Loscher KG, a fifth-generation family brew-
ery, Club-Mate’s unofficial but oft-repeated slogan 
is “Man gewöhnt sich daran” which translates 
roughly as “You get used to it!”
 In 2008, Goldstein set about importing Club-
Mate to the United States, intending to feature it at 
Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE), a hacker conven-

Hacking Club-Mate
C
omputer programmers have always loved 
caffeinated beverages, whether Mountain 
Dew, Jolt, or plain old coffee. It helps them 
keep their groove going overnight as they crank 
out code. German hackers, however, prefer a lightly 
carbonated yerba maté iced tea called Club-Mate 
(kloop MAH-tuh) and lately this beverage has made 
its way to the United States where it’s caught on 
among the homegrown hackerati.
 Emmanuel Goldstein, publisher of hacker zine 
2600: The Hacker Quarterly, first encountered
Club-Mate at a convention in Germany. 
 “I noticed all of these German hackers running 
around with these glass bottles filled with some 
sort of energy drink. It was a pretty weird scene,” 
Goldstein says. “Then the Americans tried it out, 
and all they could do was talk about how amazing it 
was. In front of my eyes they became addicted.”

tion he helps organize. It was quite an undertaking. 
The pallets had to be shipped from Europe via 
freighter, and there were frequent delays.
 On top of that, the shipping costs at least equaled 
the cost of the beverage. Goldstein overcame the 
hurdles and Club-Mate made its U.S. debut at the 
convention. “People who haven’t had a bottle since 
then still remember it vividly,” Goldstein says. “That 
can be seen as either a good or a bad thing.”
 Goldstein is now the sole U.S. distributor of 
Club-Mate. A 12-bottle case costs about $60 with 
shipping. A pallet of 800 bottles comes to about $3 
per bottle. Either way it’s a pricy proposition, which 
has led some fans to question the need to ship the 
product from thousands of miles away when theo-
retically, it could be brewed in anyone’s kitchen.
 Case in point is David Toews of Minneapolis, Minn., 
who was intrigued by Club-Mate’s punch and its odd 
flavor. “I’ve always had a thing for weird caffeinated 
beverages,” he says. “I used to order Bawls from 
ThinkGeek during my college’s 40-hour trivia mara-
thon when the only place you could get it was online.”
 Faced with the steep costs of shipping Club-Mate, 
and knowing that he could easily acquire the basic 
ingredients, Toews decided to brew his own.
 Toews (pronounced TAYVZ) began with a kilogram 
sack of yerba maté (yur-buh MAH-tay), the heavily 
caffeinated herb that provides the core flavor of the 
beverage. Known to scientists as Ilex paraguarien-
sis, yerba maté is a species of holly used to make a 
traditional South American tea, drunk from a gourd. 
 For his first batch, Toews skipped Club-Mate’s 
high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in favor of agave 
syrup, a sweetener produced in Mexico. “I’m not sold 
on the whole HFCS health controversy, but I tend to 
prefer sugar-based beverages due to the smoother 
flavor profiles,” Toews says. “I sort of stumbled upon 
the agave at Costco, and decided to give it a try.” 
 After steeping the yerba maté for five minutes, 
Toews strained the tea and added the other ingredi-
ents — the agave and a bit of citric acid for tartness 
— then carbonated the result in his kegerator.
 And how did the batch turn out? “Absolutely 
mouth-puckering,” Toews admits. “I thought that 
carbonating it might mitigate the sourness, but it 
was not to be. It was very encouraging, though, to 
be able to taste the tea flavor and tell that I might 
be able to replicate it with a bit more tweaking.”
 Intent on matching the flavor of the original bever-
age, Toews set out to equal its sweetness. His wife, 
Sarah, provided invaluable assistance, suggesting 
various combinations of simple syrup, corn syrup, 
and molasses in place of some of the agave. Toews 
also reduced the steeping temperature a few degrees 
to help mitigate the astringency of the first batch.
 Toews continued refining his recipe, producing 
1-liter batches, tweaking the mix, and then trying 
again. “Whenever you reduce a liquid to extract 
form, you lose some of the subtlety. I think this is 
also why the Club-Mate has that malty aspect to 
it,” he says. “When I brew beer, and want to create 
that profile, I’ll boil the wort longer, creating more 
Maillard reaction compounds that are associated 
with malty and caramel flavors.”
 With batch six, Toews called it done. The resulting 
beverage, which he calls Dave-Mate, is extremely 
close to the original, while displaying a unique twist. 
So what’s next? “I think I’d like to try a hybrid pro-
cess in which I melded the maté with a light-style 
beer to make a hacker-friendly alco-pop,” he says.
 He’s excitedly producing batches of Dave-Mate for 
the new Twin Cities hackerspace, the Hack Factory. 
“It would be my small contribution to insomnia for 
the sake of creativity,” he says.

DAVE-MATE RECIPE
(Makes about 1 liter)
1L water
50mL (3½Tbsp or 20g) yerba maté tea leaves
15mL agave syrup
15mL simple syrup
1.25mL (¼tsp) molasses
1.25mL (¼tsp) guarana 
0.6125mL (1tsp) citric acid
Drop of orange bitters
Heat the water to 75°C/167°F, then steep the yerba 
maté in the water for 5 minutes.
Strain the tea into another container. You may need 
to filter multiple times to remove all the sediment.
Add the sweeteners, citric acid, bitters, and guarana.
(Simple syrup is 1 part sugar dissolved in 1 part hot 
water.) The guarana simply serves as concentrated 
caffeine — it doesn’t add any flavor, but it may 
affect the overall flavor of the beverage. 
Stir until blended, then carbonate. Toews used a
1L soda bottle with a carbonator cap, then added 
CO2 from a cartridge using a method called forced 
carbonation. This equipment and instructions on 
the process may be found in any home brewing 
store.

electrical signal — the start of an ahistorical internet.
Quest for Fire
The project became a study of fire. In order to
produce a voltage, I would need to melt metals from 
their rock ores, and this requires a very hot fire. 
 Beginning empty-handed, I needed something to 
collect piles of material from the surrounding area 
— so my first tool was a simple basket, woven with 
tree bark that a beaver had chewed down. 
 Next came axes, ropes, and knives made of 
chipped stones and plant fibers. This suite of cave-
man tools was in the interest of making fire. I opted 
for a bow drill fire starter (see MAKE Volume 21, 
page 123), and bloodied my hands for days spinning 
two sticks together in an attempt to create wood

A
ll of my tools are made by bigger tools some-
where else. How far back does this lineage of 
tools go? I wondered if someone alone in the 
woods could make an Information Age object, armed 
with nothing but information?
 In the summer of 2009, I headed out for the
wilderness of Mineral County, Montana, to test this 
question. With no tools or materials except the abil-
ity to search the internet, I endeavored to learn how 
sticks and stones lying on the ground have been 
transformed into a metallic, electric society. The 
question would ultimately demonstrate whether 
electronic technologies could have existed at any 
point in history, if only people had had the know-how.

dust and heat it to 800°F.
 The tiny ember produced in this way represented 
a crucial step, releasing energy on its own, so
I wouldn’t have to do all the work anymore. Before 
this, for every chipped stone, gouged log, and dug 
hole, the energy had to come through my own
muscles. It’s quite humbling to realize how little 
impact a human with no tools can have — the
activities of beavers seemed like impossible feats
to me after a few days, let alone the roads and 
houses I would return to at the end of the day. 
 Finally, once I conceded to using a nylon rope for 
my bow drill, I was able to whoop for joy as I created 
a campfire. Given more time and less rainy weather, 
I’m confident I could have made it work with plant 
fiber rope, but I had to move on. For now, the nylon 
persists in my process like an umbilical cord to 
industry. 
 Google provided enough information to teach me 
the bow drill — which types of wood to use, what 
the ashy dust should look like, and how to bring an 
ember to a fire once I had kindled it. But a campfire 
didn’t prove anything yet; it would be a long time 
before I got this fire to the transformative tempera-
tures of the Metal Ages.
Ore Country
Collecting metal ores wasn’t too difficult in my 
location. Dozens of out-of-use mines pockmark the 
mountains in Mineral County. Copper ores often 
look metallic, or show vibrant greens and blues.
Iron ore can look like chunks of rust. 
 If I had relied only on internet information to find 
these locations, I would have ended up on the tops 
of mountains for no reason. I found precise coor-
dinates that were precisely a mile off. Some mines 
had no record at all, merely piles of leftover rocks at 
the collapsed entrances. Once again I needed local 
advice, as well as paper maps, to find them. 
Smelter Fail
The task of constructing a metal smelting furnace 
exceeded the information I found freely available 
online. My first furnace was hopelessly naive; I was 
wasting my energy pumping bellows for hours and 
sucking poisonous gases. 
 In retrospect, it’s possible I got mild arsenic 
poisoning twice, from roasting ores containing the 
heavy metal in open air and breathing it. This blun-
der illustrated that more-natural technologies are 
not automatically more environmentally sound: my

furnace had no emissions control and consumed 
charcoal very inefficiently. 
 This first trial probably never got above the
temperature of a campfire. I had to give up on 
Session One of the project after picking through
the remnants of this failed furnace and coming up 
with handfuls of ash. I was mired in the Paleolithic, 
nothing more than a caveman with big dreams.
 When I returned in the fall, I came armed with a 
dozen detailed articles from paid-access archives, 
about ancient furnaces in the Andes, Africa, and the 
Middle East. I started construction of a new, much 
smaller furnace with a chimney set into a hillside. 
Foolishly, I started with a wooden chimney. It went 
up in flames. 
 I mortared a new chimney with river clay and 
flat stones, and set to work building bellows. The 
most effective one ended up looking like a classic 
European fireplace bellows. At most points in this 
process, however, a classic mental picture of a tool 
led me astray; making something that looked like 
an axe was a waste of time, when just the head of 
an axe in my hand did the job. 
Metal Triumph
Within a couple weeks of refining my technique,
I was melting rocks and achieving the right temper-
atures, and soon I had tiny lumps of metal: first 
copper, and then wrought iron. Pounding these into 
disks and placing wedges of potato between them,
I arrived at the simplest electric battery.
 In the end, I triumphed, and was able to assemble 
a switch producing Morse code at 0.7 volts — a 
working telegraph possible in the Stone Age.
 Of course, this success is incomplete by itself. 
What good is a signal with no receiver? To go any 
further, I would need the cooperation of many other 
people, to build a wire network, and receivers, and 
to learn a code system. 
 In fact, I had already relied heavily on cooperation 
to make my metal switch. In order to have six weeks 
of free time to do this project, I had all my needs 
taken care of by modern society. 
 It may very well have proved impossible for a lone 
Paleolithic human to convince the people around 
her to participate in electronic communication. 
Even in the 1840s, Samuel Morse’s telegraph was 
mocked in Congress as a conjuring trick. 
 DIY goes only so far, because there is no commu-
nication with only one person.

to destroy mosquitoes. I work at Intellectual Ventures Lab, which is part of 
Intellectual Ventures, founded in 2000 by Microsoft’s former chief technology

Infected mosquitoes transfer a parasite that 
causes malaria. When you’re infected with malaria, 
not only do you feel miserable, you may die — par-

that infects nearly 250 million people every year 
and kills close to a million of them, mostly in Africa.
If you take mosquitoes out of the equation, people 
with malaria either get better or die without trans-
mitting it, and the disease goes away. At one time, 
DDT was commonly used to kill mosquitoes, but 
because of its unfortunate environmental impact, 
its use has become very limited. 
Today, big money is being invested in a number 
of ways to attack malaria, including vaccines and 
defenses such as bed nets and wall sprays. How-
ever, these aren’t completely effective (drugs are 
misused, resulting in drug-resistant malaria para-
sites, and bed nets are frequently removed from 
beds). In short, the current tools aren’t adequate, 
and something additional is needed to help.
As inventors, we’re constantly discovering how 
we can use computers to change the world. So we 
asked ourselves: could we leverage Moore’s Law to 
help reduce the population of mosquitoes? More 
speciﬁ cally, could we design and build a system 
capable of detecting mosquitoes and blasting them 
out of the air with lasers?
Honestly, when the idea was ﬁ rst proposed to me 
two years ago by physicist Lowell Wood, Myhrvold, 
and Jordin Kare (a colleague at Intellectual Ventures 
Lab), I was skeptical at such an outlandish notion.

COMPONENTS OF THE 
MOSQUITO DEATH RAY
Others broke out in laughter. But I began thinking 
about it seriously, and I came around to the idea 
because I realized it might actually work. You see, 
I’m a hacker, and I love to work on both hardware 
and software projects. The skills I’ve picked up as a 
hobbyist could be applied to this project.
Five years ago, I opened a hackers’ workshop 
in Seattle. We have an assortment of tools: an 
11,000-pound mill, sewing machines, CNC lathes, 
and MakerBots. Every Saturday we host Hackerbot 
Labs (hackerbotlabs.com), where friends come over 
to break and/or make things for fun.
It was on one of these nights about four years ago 
that some friends and I built a sentry robot to enter 
into a competition at the annual Def Con hacking 
conference in Las Vegas. In this competition, teams 
compete to shoot white targets off shelves. It’s like 
a shooting gallery for airsoft guns, but instead of 
people shooting the guns, it’s robots. 
We hacked our contraption together using some

Rutschman, Dave Nash, Nathan Pegram, Daniel 
MacDonald, Geoff Deane, Jordin Kare, Lowell Wood, 
Nathan Myhrvold, and Nels Peterson. Starting from 
scratch, we identified the key hardware and soft-
ware challenges in making what we came to call the 
“photonic fence insect tracker.” They were: spotting 
and tracking tiny flying insects at a distance, singling 
out mosquitoes from other flying insects, and zap-
ping the mosquitoes in midflight. What follows is a 
description of how we did it.
Where Is It?
How do you (or a computer vision system) spot 
a 2mm black insect from distances up to 100 feet 
away, in the dark? Under such conditions, direct 
illumination is out of the question. A better solution
is to project light on a retroreflector and look for 
facial recognition software adapted to identify small 
white targets instead of faces, and implemented 
a MAKE Controller to control servos for making the 
gun pan and tilt. We used web cams as the robot’s 
eyes; it was a messy robot with plenty of duct tape 
holding it together. There were a lot of autonomous 
robots competing, and somehow our bundle of 
parts managed to win third place — not because it 
was the fastest, but because it was reliable.
Shortly after that I started making my own laser 
light show by shining lasers into a mirror and mov-
ing the mirror so I could make patterns on the wall.
I got hooked on lasers.
Ultimately I realized that a mosquito tracking 
and zapping system was not only possible, but it 
could be done using less than a couple of thousand 
dollars’ worth of hardware. I could combine my 
love of lasers with my hacking experience to make 
something new and exciting that could be an impor-
tant part of a comprehensive solution Intellectual 
Ventures is working on to improve and save millions 
of lives by helping to eradicate malaria. 
Making the Photonic Fence
I had the honor of teaming up with a few ridiculously
smart people, such as Jeremy Bruestle, Phil

black dots flying in front of the illuminated back-
drop. (A retroreflector is simply a surface that 
reflects light back in the direction of its origin, 
with a minimum of scattering. It works by having 
thousands of little corner prisms along its surface. 
They’re commonly used on street signs.) We pur-
chased a large sheet of retroreflector material, 
which cost about $1 per square foot.
Next, we looked at different ways to illuminate the 
retroreﬂ ector. Possibilities included LEDs, ﬂ ash-
lights, ﬂ ood lamps, and even very low-power lasers. 
As it turned out, standard consumer-grade LED 
ﬂ ashlights worked well enough for our purpose. 
We mounted the LED ﬂ ashlights in a square 
pattern with a 35mm camera lens (hooked up to a 
CMOS or CCD sensor) in the middle. In this setup, 
the camera sees the silhouette of anything between 
it and the retroreﬂ ector. We then placed a 10-gallon 
ﬁ sh tank ﬁ lled with mosquitoes into the ﬁ eld of
view, and we were able to see them ﬂ ying around. 
(During early testing, we also made use of a fake
insect dangled from a ﬁ shing line by waving it 
around with an electromechanical device.)
Now that we had a way to see the mosquitoes, 
we could track them using image recognition and 
machine vision software (OpenCV is an amazing 
software package that makes the process of track-
ing moving objects trivial). Tracking allowed us to 
lock the bugs into the machine vision software’s 
crosshairs. But we weren’t ready to start blasting 
away at them yet. We decided to raise the bar by 
inventing a system that would shoot only mosquitoes 
and leave honeybees and other ﬂ ying insects alone. 
That led to the second challenge of our system.
What Is It?
How can a computer tell the difference between 
a mosquito and a bee? There are several ways: by 
measuring the size of the target, how fast it’s mov-
ing, or how fast it beats its wings. Mosquitoes beat 
their wings at a much higher frequency than most 
other insects and have a distinct harmonic compo-
nent. By looking at all of these data points, we can 
confirm the genus and gender of an insect. (Only 
female mosquitoes bite, and male mosquitoes beat 
their wings more quickly due to smaller body size.) 
How do you hear the wing-beat frequency of a tiny 
insect from hundreds of feet away? Optically!
First, we had to see if it was even possible to 
optically measure wing-beat frequency. We had 
a camera that could record up to about 2,000 
frames per second, but we were limited to a mere 

52
Make: Volume 23
64×64 pixels resolution. It’s not easy to convince a 
mosquito to stay in a frame at such a low resolution. 
After several failed attempts to record them in ﬂ ight, 
we developed a method for keeping them still: we 
anesthetized them with carbon dioxide, then dipped 
the tip of a needle in super glue and gently touched 
it to a bug’s thorax. Ta-da! Mosquito on a stick.
Now we could test our wing-beat detection plan. 
This took a while — we learned that mosquitoes only 
want to ﬂ ap their wings for so long while glued to a 
needle, so we had to keep a ready supply of rested 
mosquito shish kebabs on hand for testing. (Here’s a 
tip about maintaining a supply of mosquitoes: make 
sure you have the hoses on your mosquito aspiration 
system connected in the correct direction, lest you 
spray live insects into your friend’s face by mistake.)
To optically measure the wing-beat frequency, we 
created a kind of “photonic microphone” by point-
ing a low-powered laser beam at the mosquitoes. 
This returned a very strong retroreﬂ ective signal 
of the mosquito’s shadow. We sent the modulated 
signal to a photodiode purchased through an online 
auction, which provided very fast, very accurate 
information about the wing-beat frequency.
After working out all of the, um, bugs, we needed 
some kind of beam-steering technology so that the 
low-powered laser could track the free-ﬂ ying 
mosquitoes. That’s where a galvanometer (or as 
we call them, a galvo) came in handy. We got ours 
for about $100 on eBay. A galvo is basically a 
mirror mounted on a servomotor, and it can point 
a reﬂ ected beam of light in any direction. 
Driving the galvo could be done from something 
like an Arduino acting as a digital-to-analog bridge, 
but I eventually ﬁ gured out that we could do it with 
a sound card (by removing the DC blocking caps). 
Insects move fast, and I spent a lot of time address-
ing the latency of the image processing to the galvo 
position loop, because failure to have a timely 
response to new image data results in poor tracking.
With two challenges — Where is it? and What is it? 
— out of the way, we focused on our third:
Extermination!
Killing the mosquitoes required another galvo and 
another, more powerful laser. You can see videos 
at intellectualventureslab.com that show our early 
experiments with shooting mosquitoes, in which we 
literally burned mosquitoes to death in midflight. 
But we soon realized we didn’t want to do that, and 
not only because burned mosquitoes smell really 
bad. We also wanted the photonic fence to be solar-

powered, so energy conservation was critical. 
By testing lasers of different wavelengths, we 
ﬁ gured out the minimum photonic dose that would 
kill a mosquito within a few hours of exposure, which 
would render it a nonproductive member of the 
malaria transmission cycle. (It happens to be about 
50 to 100 millijoules of energy.)
If you want to design your own insect tracking 
system at home, that’s great, but let me offer some 
strong words of warning: lasers are dangerous. Just 
a few milliseconds of laser exposure at 5 milliwatts 
are enough to hurt yourself or others. If you decide 
to play with lasers, be careful and be aware that you 
face blindness if you make a mistake. 
I personally always wear laser goggles, and even 
though I take massive amounts of caution, I’ve 
singed my beard and had to shave when the smell 
of burning hair wouldn’t go away. I am speciﬁ cally 
not advocating the construction of a high-powered 
laser system. 
It’s really quite satisfying just to see the insects 
tracked and identiﬁ ed. A system costing $300 could 
be programmed to recognize certain kinds of ﬂ ying 
insects, or even birds, monkeys, and so on. It could 
even be a boon to citizen scientists who conduct 
migration counts.
The Future of the Photonic Fence
We’re building “rev 3” of the photonic fence. It will 
be much more compact and consume much less 
power. At Intellectual Ventures Lab, we don’t make 
products — we prove or disprove ideas. Folks keep 
asking when such a device will be available for pur-
chase. We’re looking to partner with someone who 
can help us produce these things for mass markets. 
Working on projects that could help make the world 
a better place is something I find very satisfying.

ho’s the fairest of them all? Ask the Magic Mirror, which plays 
prerecorded animations keyed to real-world data like how close 
you’re standing, the current weather, stock market data, even alcohol 
level readings from an onboard breathalyzer.
How It Works
Running the show is a Seeeduino microcontroller 
board, an Arduino clone from Seeed Studio 
(seeed studio.com). For easy assembly, I made 
a custom Magic Mirror Shield board that fits on top 
of the Arduino and has plug-and-play connectors 
labeled for all of the controller’s different inputs and 
outputs, plus all the necessary pull-down resistors 
(following page). 
The video plays from a computer (Windows, Mac, 
or Linux) that’s connected to the Arduino via USB. The 
computer uses Adobe Flash ActionScript 3.0 to run 
the video clips, communicating with the Arduino using 
the AS3glue library (code.google.com/p/as3glue). 
On the Arduino side, Firmata software tells 
ActionScript when to trigger the clips, and also 
Touch a magic “weather” spot on a rainy day, and a 
courtly visage greets you with, “Rain I see, in all its 
glory. When will it end? Ask tomorrow, for the story.” 
Or blow into the breathalyzer after a few too many, 
and a smart-alecky pumpkin cracks, “You’re drunker 
than a skunk — someone get this guy’s keys!”
The animations play on an LCD monitor that’s 
hidden under a 2-way mirror and built into an ornate 
frame. When the screen is off, the arrangement 
looks like a regular mirror, but when the Magic 
Mirror comes to life, an eerie talking image appears 
behind the glass.
I made my ﬁ rst Magic Mirror for a playhouse that 
I built for my 2 girls. Since then, I’ve upgraded the 
hardware, software, and content, turning it into a kit that 
you can build and conﬁ gure to do lots of fun things.

You can use your own animations with the Magic 
Mirror, but the kit software comes complete with 
80 video clips that feature 4 different characters: 
a courtly “Princess” mask, a scary Halloween skull, 
pirate skull, and a “New York cabbie” jack-o-lantern 
that dispenses insults with a Bronx accent (Figure A). 
To switch between characters, you turn an 
onboard potentiometer knob on the MM Shield. 
I went upmarket on this content, licensing digital 
puppet renderings from ImaginEERIEing (www.
imagineerieing.com) and hiring professional voice 
actor Alan Harrison (alansvoice.com) for the audio. 
The results look and sound great. You can see all 
4 sets of 20 clips at diymagicmirror.com. 
 In addition, the Magic Mirror can also speak your 
tweets from Twitter as well as speak custom sensor 
responses set by you using the recently added text-
to-speech feature.
There are 2 versions of the Magic Mirror kit, both 
of which come pre-assembled: a version that’s 
boxed up and has the character select knob and 
breathalyzer attached, and the raw kit version. 
Either way, the electronics are basically plug-and-

and if they have standard headers (for 3-lead 
sensors) or lead pairs (for simple switches), you just

plug them into the MM Shield; no soldering required 
(Figure B). 
The circuitry is easy; what takes more doing is 
building the display itself and embedding the sensors 
and wiring into your walls or wherever else you want 
to put them. Also, the breathalyzer needs a housing 
for users to blow into, so I’ll show you how to make 
one of those, and how I installed the whole thing.
BUILD YOUR MAGIC MIRROR
Time: 1–2 Weekends  
Complexity: Moderate
Choose and Connect the Inputs
The Magic Mirror’s range of functionality depends 
on which inputs you connect. The proximity sensor 
detects if someone is there and how far away; if 
they’re far, the mirror asks them to come closer. 
The breathalyzer detects alcohol (this sensor isn’t 
installed in my daughters’ playhouse version). On 
the MM Shield itself, a potentiometer knob selects 
which of the 4 animated characters will appear.
Capacitive touch sensors trigger weather and 
stock market clips; ActionScript 3.0 calls the Yahoo 
API for current data and then selects an appropriate 
clip based on whether the weather is warm, cold, 
or rainy, or a selected stock portfolio is up, down, or 
unchanged. A third capacitive sensor triggers the 
X10 clip, in which the animated character seems to 
magically turn something on and off in the room.
I used capacitive touch sensors because you can 
embed them into walls or other surfaces to make 
“magic spots” that don’t look like switches. But you 
can also install 3 regular momentary (or toggle) 
switches to trigger the weather, stock, and X10 clips. 
These are less expensive. You can even use both

in parallel; in my playhouse installation, you get the 
weather by either touching the wall or taking a small 
magnetic ﬁ gurine off a shelf that has an embedded 
reed switch. 
Two more regular switches activate additional 
functions. One functions as a doorbell, triggering a 
bell sound and showing streaming video from a web-
cam installed at the front door (Figure C, page 56). 
Another switch puts the Magic Mirror into slideshow 
mode, in which it displays Picasa photo albums.
There are 2 ways to go on the wiring. For short 
distances, it’s easier to plug the sensors into the 
headers, and the switches and LEDs into the screw 
terminals. But for long runs and in-wall installation, 
it’s better to use T-568B standard CAT5 cable, split-
ting out and soldering the wires on the far end. 
For all connections, you can use the pinout “cheat 
sheet” printed in the middle of the MM Shield, and 
also refer to the logical and physical wiring diagrams
at makezine.com/23/magicmirror. There are 
detailed step-by-step manuals and video tutorials 
at diymagicmirror.com.
Make the Mirror Display
The Magic Mirror looks like a normal mirror when 
the monitor is off, but when the animations are 
running, you can see them along with some reflec-
tion in the mirror, which is a cool effect. Here’s how 
to make the display, which you can use for magic 
mirror projects of your own design.
For an in-wall installation, frame out an opening for 
the monitor and attach the LCD monitor mounting 
bracket (Figure D, previous page). Also drill openings 
for routing cables for the monitor’s VGA and power 
cables. 
Be sure to leave some room for ventilation, then 
drywall as needed. Check your local electrical code 
for compliance. If in-wall isn’t an option, build a cus-
tom box. Attach the monitor to its mount (Figure E).
Attach the 2-way mirror to the back of the picture 
frame (Figure F). Note that the mirror will look 
transparent until it’s mounted. One side has to be 
darker than the other for the effect to work.
For my daughters’ playhouse, I added a fake 
ﬁ replace below the Magic Mirror. A green LED lights 
up when the subject is within range, and red LEDs 
ﬂ icker like a ﬁ re (Figure G).
Make the Breathalyzer Housing
Hot-glue the breathalyzer into the middle of the ABS 
tee fitting (Figure H), and attach the PVC reducers 
to the stem. Connect the sensor to the MM Shield. 
When it’s time to party, hand out ½" PVC risers as 
mouthpieces for your guests. To use the breatha-
lyzer, insert the mouthpiece into the reducers, touch 
the trigger sensor, and blow (Figure I).
CAUTION: The Magic Mirror breathalyzer is not 
a professional breathalyzer and should be used 
for novelty purposes only. Drive safely!

Install and Configure the Software
The Firmata code for the Arduino is included with 
the Magic Mirror software. Upload it to the Arduino 
via USB. Then launch the Magic Mirror configura-
tion program to turn on the sensors you’ve con-
nected, and enter configuration options and data: 
sensor and webcam ports, location for weather 
forecast, stocks in portfolio, X10 codes, Picasa 
album info, your Twitter account, etc. (Figure J). 
The Conﬁ guration pane also lets you display text 
to accompany the animations, and if your mirror 
is framed with an oval matte, you’ll need to adjust 
the text’s size and position to make sure it isn’t 
covered up.
After conﬁ guration, run the Magic Mirror applica-
tion itself in verbose mode. This displays all the 
sensor values, allowing you to test everything out. 
Once that’s done and you see that the sensors all 
work, turn off verbose mode, add the Magic Mirror 
software to your computer’s startup folder so it 
launches automatically, and you’ll be off and running.
Applications
The Magic Mirror is a centerpiece of my daughters’ 
playhouse. It’s also a natural for Halloween parties; 
I use the same wall setup, changing the character 
to the Halloween skull. The Goblyns Glen Haunt 
(goblynsglen.com) in Los Gatos, Calif., has one at 
the bottom of a well (Figure K). 
 In stealth mode, the Magic Mirror can also 
masquerade as a normal bathroom mirror, giving 
guests a surprise when they approach the sink to 
wash their hands (Figure L).
I’ve also exhibited the Magic Mirror at Maker 
Faire, and there’s one installed at the Table Rock 
Motel, in the town of Bandon on the southern coast 
of Oregon. Their Magic Mirror is embedded in a 
suitcase in the lobby (Figure M), where it’s always 
available to tell guests the weather forecast.

circuits, so this step will vary. Some cards also have 
a speaker for sound — I wish mine had sound!
Refer to the schematic diagram (Figure B) to build 
the circuit. My PCB had the trigger between the 
ground (–) and battery, but others have the trigger 
between the positive power (+) and battery. 
I used a clear plastic antiperspirant container, 
so that my audience could see all the working elec-
tronics of this circuit. The circuit board ﬁ t perfectly 
into this container, allowing 2 AAA batteries in their 
holder to ﬁ t on the underside.
Place the reed switches inside your container 
on the left and the right, so they’ll be close to the 
magnetic ring whichever way you hold the container. 
Figure C shows a bit of perf board used to keep the 
reed switches in place; they’re connected in parallel, 
then placed in series with the 3 toggle switches.
Revealing the Mystery
A good illusionist never discloses the secret that 
makes a trick work, Once you do, the magic has 
ended. With that said, I’ll break my own rule and 
reveal how my circuit really works: inside the con-
tainer are 2 reed switches that can be activated by 
a magnet, and you’ll wear a special magnetic ring 
to activate them. Whenever you display your ability 
to make the LEDs light up, you must make sure that 
your ﬁ nger with the magnetic ring is placed right 
alongside one of the magnetic reed switches.
Build the Circuit
Remove the printed circuit board (PCB) from the 
LED greeting card. Find the positive and negative 
contacts on the PCB for the battery pack (Figure A).

LED display circuit was very ﬂ at and required only

GADGETS
Three handy gizmos that 
snap, magnify, and play.

I 
love gadgets, but I must see a specific need for them, and the gadget must 
be a good value. When I can’t find what I’m looking for, I make it. Here are 
three of my favorite and most useful homemade gadgets.
1. The Close-Up Webcam began life as a $10 web-
cam. After hacking, it’s now capable of over 100x 
magnification. I’ve used it to photograph everything 
from coins to arachnids to flower pistils.
2. The Camera Shutter Control repeatedly presses
a digital camera’s shutter at an adjustable regular 
interval. I recently flew it from a kite to take aerial 
photographs, and there are lots of other uses for it.
3. The Winamp Joystick saved me from having to 
buy a complicated remote control just for playing 
music. The hard-wired Joystick controls 8 common 
Winamp functions, including Play, Next, Pause, and 
Volume Up and Down. My favorite is Jump. I still use 
the Webcam and Shutter Control occasionally, and
I use my Winamp Joystick almost every day.

Close-Up Webcam
When I inherited some silver coins, I had to 
decide whether to keep them for their collector’s 
value or sell them. To get expert advice, I needed 
close-up photos that showed the coins’ conditions. 
But microscope camera adapters and photo-
graphing microscopes can be expensive. Instead, 
I ﬁ gured I could hack a cheap webcam and build a 
simple stand and illuminator for it. It wouldn’t need 
an adjustable focus because you can just move the 
webcam toward or away from its subject.
The trick is to get into the tube in the webcam 
that holds its lens so you can move the lens a bit 
farther out than designed. A small change in lens 
position can make a big difference in the camera’s 
magnifying power. This blurs photography at normal 
distances, but makes close-ups razor sharp.

WEBCAM MATERIALS
NOTE: Your mileage may vary.
Webcam
Wood or other material for base
Threaded rod with matching nuts
Thin metal rod
LEDs: white (3) and red
Resistors: 390Ω (3) and 560Ω
2.5kΩ potentiometers (3)
5V DC power source I used a 12V wall wart with 
a voltage regulator and heat sink.
Solderless breadboard and solid-core hookup wire
White cardboard
Epoxy and glue
Dremel tool, drill, scissors
I’ve made a few of these using different webcams 
I had on hand. With one of them, I discovered that 
the lens had once been totally adjustable, screw-
ing in and out of a plastic sleeve that snapped over 
the image sensor on the board (Figure A), but the 
manufacturer had melted it in a ﬁ xed position! 
I only had to Dremel away a bit of melted plastic, 
and voilà — the lens screwed out about 1", perfect 
for close-ups.
Your webcam’s design will probably be different 
from mine, so you’ll have to adapt. Epoxy is probably 
all you need, and maybe a bit of plastic tubing to 
hold the lens farther out from the board (although 
I’ve never needed this).
While you’re hacking, look for a shutter-release 
button. Not all webcams have this, but if you ﬁ nd 
one, you can wire it to a remote shutter switch.
Minor jitters will appear 100 times larger, so you 
need a stable base to hold the camera and subject 
still. I made a wooden base with a small rectangular 
shuttle that carries the camera. Two rods attach 
to the base and run vertically through the shuttle: 
a threaded rod that holds the shuttle up and turns 
to adjust its position, and a thin guide rod that 
prevents the shuttle from rotating around.
The Close-Up Webcams I’ve made usually wind 
up ½" or so above the subject and move maybe 1" 
each way. Precise construction is not critical, and 
your mileage will vary depending on your camera.
Because the camera is so close, you’ll need to 
illuminate the subject. I ringed the webcam lens 
with a circular reﬂ ector cut out of white cardboard 
and mounted 3 white LEDs underneath, about 120° 
apart and pointing toward the center. I installed 
3 potentiometers to independently control their 
brightness, which is useful for adding shadows to

highlight raised markings on coins (Figure B). 
I also wired in a red “On” indicator LED. All the 
wiring was done on a solderless breadboard; Figure 
C shows the schematic. For the power, I connected 
a 12V wall wart through a 5V voltage regulator 
mounted to a heat sink. It might also work to split 
5V DC off the USB that connects the webcam, but
I didn’t try it.
One of the most satisfying things about web-
cam close-ups is that you see the results on your 
computer monitor in real time as you position
the subject and focus the camera. To capture still 
images (Figures B and D) use the shutter button
(if present) or look for a screen-capture mode in 
your webcam’s software.

Camera Shutter Control
One of my hobbies is kite aerial photography 
(KAP). Nowadays, almost all KAPers take photos 
with radio-controlled digital cameras. But I some-
times favor kites that just go up and up, out of radio 
range, almost out of sight until you can’t tell which 
way the camera is pointing. With these rigs, I need 
some way to snap the shutter repeatedly.
Most cameras can’t do this. Yes, there are few digi-
cams with a built-in intervalometer (repeat-shutter) 
SHUTTER MATERIALS
Digital camera
Flat hard plastic, 1" thick, at least 2" square 
I used a scrap of acrylic.
Solarbotics GM2 gearmotor, item #SBGM2 from 
Maker Shed (makershed.com), $6. Or you can

Potentiometers: 100kΩ and 500kΩ
Resistor: 1kΩ
Capacitors: 0.01μF, 1μF, 22μF
4×AAA battery pack with batteries or other source 
of DC power between 5V and 9V
Solderless breadboard and solid-core hookup wire
Small mounting screws and washers for gearmotor

Mounting the gearmotor so the cam sits the 
right distance directly above the shutter button will 
require some tweaking. 
I made a bracket out of ¾"×1" aluminum that 
attaches at the tripod mounting-screw hole in the 
bottom of the camera. It bends up and over to 
hold the gearmotor, which is attached through its 
mounting holes. The aluminum is strong enough 
to minimize play, but ﬂ exible enough that it springs 
back a little when the shutter button bottoms out.

Winamp Joystick
I love Winamp, but I don’t like having to use a 
mouse or hotkeys with it. When I’m multitasking, it 
bugs me to have to Alt-Tab over, then click around 
or remember that X is Play and V is Stop.
So I built a joystick (more of a “joywheel,” actually; 
Figure I) that emulates 8 of what I consider to be 
Winamp’s most important functions: Play (hotkey: 
X), Stop (V), Jump to File (J), Pause (C), Previous
Track (Z), Next Track (B), Volume Up (↑), and Volume
Down (↓). To this list, you might want to add a ninth 
switch in the middle to emulate the Enter or Esc key.
Most control functions require a single satisfying 
push on the big, bright wheel, and if I want to hear a 
particular tune, I simply hit Jump, type a few letters 
unique to the song title, and hit Enter. 
The arrangement worked so well that I converted 
an old IBM ThinkPad into a dedicated music player.
(Note: Laptop or desktop computers work equally 
well for this project; I tend to lean toward portability.)
WINAMP MATERIALS

the Winamp computer and doesn’t conflict with 
its normal keyboard.

#275-016 or #275-002 from RadioShack

Insulated wire 22- to 24-gauge telephone wire

a bit larger than the PCB inside the keyboard
Small box to hold keyboard’s PCB. I made one out

You can set up on a crowded street or beach,
turn on the Shutter Control, and walk away until
the memory is full or the batteries die. (Chain the 
camera to a parking meter or lifeguard stand so it 
isn’t stolen.) Later, dump your shots into a photo 
editor, and I can almost guarantee that you’ll get 
some with serendipitous timing and framing, like
my lucky shot of a lighthouse beam (Figure E).
The shutter button is pressed by a cam (Figure F)
that’s driven by a DC gearmotor. I used a band saw 
to cut 1"-thick acrylic into a shallow spiral cam 
about 1" across with a 1" drop. The drop should 
slightly exceed the throw of your shutter button, so 
that the shutter is pressed gradually and releases 
fully. For the ﬂ attened hole that ﬁ ts the gearmotor 
axle, I drilled undersize and ﬁ led the hole to shape.
A simple circuit uses a 556 timer chip to run
the motor continuously or in pulses, with 2 potenti-
ometers adjusting the pulse length and frequency. 
If you’re using a low voltage to save battery weight, 
pulsing the motor provides enough torque to press 
the button when continuous power might not.
Slow speeds and mechanical triggering also let 
point-and-shoots focus normally before each shot.
Occasionally the cam will press the shutter while 
the camera is still “digesting” the last shot, but this 
has done no harm to any cameras I’ve tried.
Figure G shows a schematic of the circuit, which
I often just leave on a prototyping board (Figure H). 
Substitute different capacitor and resistor values to 
change the possible pulse and delay interval ranges.

I cleared its hard drive of everything but the OS 
and Winamp and copied a huge MP3 collection to 
it. Then I plugged in my newly minted joystick and 
tuned out.
The joystick works just like pressing Winamp’s 
hotkey buttons on a second keyboard — literally. 
You make the joystick out of an old keyboard by re-
moving its circuit board and wiring switches across 
the traces that are normally bridged by the hotkeys. 
I used SPDT microswitches because they’re small, 
cheap, and have short button travel.
Modifying the keyboard is easy — unscrew and 
dismantle everything but the hard printed circuit 
board and its connection to the cable. Remove the 
big mylar strips that connect onto the board and 
carry traces out from the small board to the full 
keyboard layout.
Now comes the tricky part: ﬁ nding the solder 
pads for the hotkeys you want to control. These 
contacts usually sit in 2 long rows under the mylar 
sheets. I’ve decoded 3 keyboards now, and the 
contacts were arranged differently on all of them.
To locate the pads you want, you could painstak-
ingly follow the traces from the key positions on the 
mylar sheets to the circuit board, but I prefer using 
this trial-and-error method:
  1. Draw a diagram of the rows of solder pads that 
formerly accepted the mylar sheets. I labeled my 
short row a1–a9 and the long row b1–b18.
  2. Using your normal keyboard, fire up Notepad. 
Plug in the circuit board cable. Use a short wire 
jumper to bridge pairs of solder pads (Figure J), 
and watch Notepad to see which pairs generate 
the hotkey letters you want. Note that some sol-
der pads serve multiple keys. When you find one, 
write it down. For example, on my latest circuit 
board, bridging a5 to b2 produces a J. Test every 
pair of pads multiple times, always with the key-
board cable plugged in. With patience, you’ll find 
what you need.
 Be especially careful of the number pad, if your 
keyboard has one, and make sure the Num Lock key 
is off. Your Winamp’s volume should be controlled by 
the ↑ and ↓ keys, not the 2 and 8 keys on the number 
pad, which translate to ↑ and ↓ when Num Lock is on.
Next cut and strip some leads a few inches long, 
and tin the ends with solder. Solder them to the 
pads you identiﬁ ed (Figures K and L). The pads are 
very close together, so don’t add any more solder; 
the solder on the pad and lead should be enough.

Test the leads by touching their 2 ends together and 
conﬁ rming that the character you want appears in 
Notepad. When they’re all working, consider gluing 
them down with hot glue.
Now for the “stick” part. Mount 8 momentary 
switches in a circle, 45˚apart, to some surface that 
lets you wire them to the PC board underneath. 
If your switches have metal levers, remove them. 
I arranged SPDT microswitches around a hole in 
a piece of Formica, and they all just touched in the 
middle (Figure M). I mounted them with hot glue, 
which is ﬁ ne for microswitches. For a ninth Enter/
Esc switch, you can add it in the center.
Solder the leads from the circuit board cable to 
the appropriate switches. If you use SPDT switches, 
be sure to wire to the common (C) and normally 
open (NO) legs, leaving the normally closed (NC) 
leg unconnected.
Plug the joystick into the Winamp computer. It 
should emulate the 8 hotkeys you’ve selected. Of 
course the computer’s keyboard should also work 
normally, like for entering song titles.
Make a box to hold the circuit board and support 
the switches, and cover the switch push buttons with 
a colorful “function circle” (Figure N). I printed mine 
on heavyweight photo paper and then laminated it. 
See makezine.com/23/favoritegadgets for my print-
able designs. The circle must be ﬂ exible enough that 
when you press one of the sectors, only one switch 
is actuated.
To keep the circle ﬁ xed and centered over the 
switches, I glued a short wooden dowel in the 
middle underneath, so it hangs down between the 
switch bodies. You may want to wrap a few turns of 
tape around the dowel to make it a light press-ﬁ t 
within the switch bodies; also consider double-
faced tape to stick the bottom of the function circle 
to the switches.
I love the Winamp skin Nucleo_NLog_v102
 (Figure O), which seems appropriate for my 
ThinkPad Winamp player, or sometimes I use the 
Wurlitzer_v2 skin (Figure P), which complements 
the 1966-vintage Wurlitzer jukebox I have in the 
same room.

hen you insert a plunger into 
the toilet bowl, you create a 
seal around the exit of the toilet so 
that when you push down, a positive 
pressure is created that moves the 
blockage downstream. The drawback 
to this design is that when you pull 
the plunger back up in preparation for 
the next push, you create a vacuum 
that moves the blockage back to its 
original position.
So, to effectively clear your toilet, you either need
a plunger with a stroke volume large enough to 
move the blockage to a larger cross section of 
drainpipe with a single push, or you must plunge
so aggressively that you not only dislodge the 
blockage but break it up, which allows the toilet
to flush properly. Most plungers don’t have an
adequately large volume to succeed in just one 
stroke, and aggressive plunging makes messes.
After much contemplation, it occurred to me 
that a one-way valve installed in your plunger would 
allow you to create a positive pressure on the push 
stroke, but avoid pulling the undesirable vacuum 
with the plunger bell. This would allow you to 
steadily pressurize a pipe, thus moving the offend-
ing blockage downstream with each stroke. 
My solution was built for just a few dollars. I took 
a cheap rubber plunger bell and drilled a hole in 
its handle socket. The socket was built to accept 
a wooden handle with threads carved into it, but 
you can use a length of ½" PVC pipe as the handle 
instead. Carefully shave the threads of the plunger 
bell with a pocketknife (not too much, or your 
handle will fall out), or if you’re strong enough, just 
force your new handle in there. This modiﬁ cation 
creates an airway connecting the stroke volume of 
the plunger bell to the hollow PVC handle.
Stick a one-way valve on the end of your ½" pipe 
and you now have a plunger that pushes but doesn’t 
pull. Or, if you’d like, you could turn your one-way 
valve around and create a plunger that can pull
your blockage back into the toilet bowl … but I’m not 
really sure you want to do that.

SKELETAL SYSTEM
Squelette is a see-through amplifier that 
sounds ridiculously good while showing 
off your soldering (it looks nothing like a 
typical audio product). Build it with com-
mon materials and enjoy music played 
through a component you made yourself.
 I love to build audio gear: speakers, turntables, preamplifiers, 
tube amps, transistor amps, and anything else that repro-
duces music. A few years ago I read rave reviews of an exotic 
audiophile amplifier based on a National Semiconductor 
amplifier chip. After more research, I learned that NatSemi’s 
Overture series of audio amp ICs pack a ton of musical good-
ness into one robust and flexible chip, combining all the 
features of a well-designed transistor amp.
 I decided to use their LM1875 chip to make a small, simple 
stereo amplifier. I dubbed the result Squelette (skeleton 
in French), after mechanical wristwatches that show their 
internal workings. Squelette is a chip amp in its simplest 
form: it has 2 source inputs and a volume control, and it puts 
out a useful 11 watts per channel. Building it requires no 
exotic parts; I made careful design choices and sourced 
everything except for the LM1875 from RadioShack and 
the plumbing aisle at the hardware store. Here’s how you 
can build your own, from materials costing less than $50.

PROJECTS: MINI CHIP AMP
Illustration by Timmy Kucynda
A good design makes every part earn its keep. Here’s how the Squelette ampliﬁ er’s common components team up 
to make a whole that’s greater than its parts.
A  The input jacks connect to the audio source.
B  The power cord connects to one side of a 25.2V 2A 
transformer. The LM1875 chip can handle larger 
transformers, but scaling the other components 
and the heat-sinking design to match would make 
the amp signiﬁ cantly bulkier, more complicated, 
and more expensive.
C  The heart of the amp is a small, hand-built circuit 
board. The grid pattern of the board’s perforations 
lends itself to easy, solder-by-numbers instructions.
The power supply components (along the top and 
middle of the board as shown here) convert AC from 
the transformer into DC for the ampliﬁ cation circuits.
D  Each of the 2 identical ampliﬁ cation channels is 
built around a NatSemi LM1875 ampliﬁ er chip.
E  Capacitor C1 isolates the chips’ pin 1 inputs from 
DC, and resistor R1 provides a ground reference.
F  Capacitors C2, C3, C4 and C5 bypass the power 
supply to the V+ and V– pins of the LM1875, ensuring 
a low-impedance power source at high frequencies.
G  Resistor R2 and cap C6 form a Zobel ﬁ lter, 
presenting a low-impedance load to the output at 
very high frequencies. This loads down and damps 
out oscillations and spurious signals outside the 
audio band.
H  Resistors R3 (on back of board) and R4, AC-coupled 
to ground through C7, form a global negative feedback 
loop from the chip’s output pin back to its negative in-
put signal terminal. This feedback sets the overall volt-
age gain, reduces the output impedance, and reduces 
internally generated noise and distortion.
I  The circuit board is housed in a cabinet made from 
stock aluminum angle and plexiglass. The aluminum 
attaches to the LM1875 chips as a heat sink, as well as 
serving as the circuit ground. The plexiglass lets you 
see the circuitry.
J  All ground connections run directly to one shared 
“star” ground, a large loop of wire centered on the 
back of the PCB that connects to the cabinet. This 
wiring prevents interactions between circuit features 
that could cause noise and instability.
K  The 3P2T (triple-pole, double-throw) input selector 
switches both the signals and the grounds of 2 input 
devices, to completely isolate the deselected input 
device. This avoids ground currents and noise that 
can come from connecting different inputs’ grounds 
together. Wired for “center off,” the switch also lets you 
mute the amp without changing the volume setting.
L  Two acorn nuts at the upper corners of the chassis 
let you expose the amp’s innards to open air, and 5 
more screws let you remove the Squelette’s circuitry 
from the chassis completely, without unsoldering.

BUILD YOUR 
MINI AMPLIFIER
START>>
MAKE IT.
Time: 2 Weekends  Complexity: Moderate
1. BUILD THE CIRCUIT BOARD
This board looks complex, but each LM1875 chip contains 46 transistors; imagine hand-wiring all of those!
Photography Ross Hershberger

75
Make:
1a. Cut a 33×15-hole piece of perf board, then sand the edges. Scour the copper side with a Scotch-Brite 
pad and wipe with alcohol. Tape a cardboard frame around the edges and label the rows 1–15 and the col-
umns A–AG, with the origin at upper left on the component (non-copper) side.
NOTE: You can download a schematic diagram for the Squelette at makezine.com/23/chipamp.
1b. Start with the power supply. Connect the following hole pairs with diodes, cathode side (marked with a 
line) listed second: B1 to G1, H1 to M1, X1 to S1, and AD1 to Y1. 
On the copper side, jumper G1 to H1, X1 to Y1, and M1 to S1. Clip the leads at H1 and X1 off to ½" and bend 
them under in a tight loop. Clip all other leads off completely.
TIP: If any holes are too small, ream them from the component side with a needle file, a knife point, or (fastest) a 
Dremel tool with a tapered diamond bit.
1c. Strip some 24-gauge wire, thread it through A1, and solder it in back to bridge A1 and B1. Route it over 
the 4 diodes, and strip, thread, and solder the other end to connect AE1 and AD1.
1d. Stuff a 4,700μF cap into P3 (+) and P6 (–) and another into P10 (+) and P13 (–). Jumper S1 to P3. 
Electrolytic capacitors have the (–) terminal labeled.
1e. On the component side, pass a 24-gauge wire through AF1 and connect to AD1. Route it between rows 
1 and 2, then down between columns S and T. Thread the other end through S14, insulated, then cut, strip, 
and connect only to P13. 
1f. Connect P6 to P10 in back with a raised loop of bare 18-gauge 
wire. This is the star ground node, and a lot of wires attach here, 
so leave some room.
1g. To test this circuit, clip-lead (alligator jumper) the transformer’s secondary center tap lead (black) to 
the 0V star ground at P6/P10, and its secondary (yellow) leads to X1 and H1. Temporarily solder one side 
of the fuse holder to one of the transformer’s primary leads (black) and tape the joint. Insert a 500mA 
fuse. Split a power cord (not plugged in), connect it between the free side of the fuse and the free primary 
transformer lead, wrap with electrical tape, and use a switched power strip to apply power to the trans-
former. 
If nothing sparks or pops, measure the DC voltages across both capacitors. You should get around –18V 
from P10 to P13 and around +18V from P10 to P3. If the voltages read 0V, check the fuse. If it’s blown, 
there’s a wiring error. If the voltages check out, turn it off and clip a 22K resistor between P3 and P13 to 
bleed off the charge on the caps.

1h. Stuff and solder the following left channel components:
 • LM1875 into D13–H13, perpendicular to and facing the center 
of the board (pin 1 in H13, heat-sink side out)
 • 1K resistor into H15, K15
 • 22μF capacitor into L15 (+), L14 (–)
 • 22K resistor into J10, J13
 • 1μF cap into I8, I13.
On the back of the board, solder K15 to L15 and clip off. Solder 
H15 to G15. Solder J13, I13, and H13 trogether and clip off. Clip 
the other leads except for I8, J10, and L14.
1i. Stuff and solder a 0.1μF cap into G10, G14; and a 100μF cap into F8 (+), F9 (–). On the back, bend lead F9 
down and solder it to F13 and G14. Bend lead G10 up and solder it to F8. Clip the other leads, except for F8.
1j. Stuff and solder a 1Ω resistor into D9, E14; and a 0.22μF cap into D5, D8. In back, solder E14 to E15, and 
D8 to D9. Clip except for D5 and E15.
1k. Stuff and solder a 100μF cap into C12 (–) and C13 (+); and a 0.1μF cap into A9 and A13. Bend lead C12 
up to A9 and solder, then solder A13, C13, and D13 together.
1l. Use separate jumpers to wire A9, D5, F8, J10, and L14 to the 
ground wire loop in back. Put a red 24-gauge jumper through L3 
from the component side and connect it to P3. Pass the other 
end through B14 and connect it to D13. Put a green jumper 
through O15 from the component side and connect it to P13; 
pass the other end through F12 and connect it to F13. 
Finally, connect a 20K resistor (or a 22K and 220K in parallel) 
on the copper side between G15 and E15, making sure it doesn’t 
project past the edge of the board. This is the feedback resistor. 
Clip off its lead at G15 and leave its other lead in place.
1m. Stuff and solder the following right channel components 
(just like building the left channel):
 • LM1875 chip into AC13, AB15, AA13, Z15, and Y13, perpendi-
cular to and facing the center of the board (pin 1 in Y13, heat-sink 
side out). The chip should clear the bottom edge of the PCB.
 • 1K resistor into AC15, AF15
 • 22μF cap into AG14 (–), AG15 (+)
 • 22K resistor into AE10, AE13
 • 1μF cap into AD8, AD13.
On the back of the board, solder AF15 to AG15 and clip off. Solder 
AC15 to AB15. Solder AE13, AD13, and AC13 together and clip off. 
Clip the other leads except for AD8, AE10, and AG14.
1n. Stuff and solder a 0.1μF cap into AB10 and AB14; and a 100μF into AA8 (+) and AA9 (–). On the back, 
bend lead AA9 down and solder it to AB13 and AA14. Bend lead AB10 up and solder it to AA8.

77
Make:
1o. Stuff and solder a 1Ω resistor into Z14 and Y9, and a 0.22μF cap into Y5 and Y8. In back, solder Z14 to 
Z15, and Y8 to Y9. Clip except for Y9 and Z15.
1p. Stuff and solder a 100μF cap into X12 (–) and X13 (+), and a 0.1μF cap into V9 and V13. Bend lead X12 
up to V9 and solder it, then solder V13, X13, and Y13 together.
1q. Use separate jumpers to wire V9, Y5, AA8, AE10, and AG14 
to the ground wire loop in back. Put a red 24-gauge jumper wire 
through U3 from the component side and connect it to P3; pass 
the other end through U13 and connect it to Y13. Put a green 
jumper through S14 from the component side and connect it to 
P13; pass the other end through AA12 and connect it to AA13.
For the right channel feedback, connect a 20K resistor (or a 
22K and 220K) on the back between AB15 and Z15. Clip off 
lead AB15.
2. TEST THE AMP
2a. For the power indicator light, stuff your favorite color LED into AC3 (anode, longer leg) and AD3 (cath-
ode). Bend and solder the cathode lead to AD1. Stuff an 830Ω, ½W resistor into Z3 and V3, then solder V3 
to the ground wire loop, and Z3 to AC3. 
2b. The circuit board is done now, and the only unconnected leads remaining should be I8 (left channel 
input), E15 (left channel output), AD8 (right channel input), Z15 (right channel output), X1 and H1 (AC 
input), and the ground at P6–P10.
To set up testing, hook up the transformer to the power supply as in Step 1g. Clamp a heat sink to the tab 
of each LM1875 chip, making sure they don’t touch anything conductive. For dummy loads, clip-lead a 
10Ω–25Ω, 10W resistor from E15 to ground, and a second resistor from Z15 to ground. Connect AD8 to I8. 
Connect I8 to ground for the moment.
2c. Power up the circuit as in Step 1g. The power LED should come on. Measure the DC voltage across 
each dummy load resistor. If it’s over 0.05 volts, power down and look for wiring errors.
2d. For signal testing, disconnect I8/AD8 from ground and connect 
them to any signal generator source with a volume control. Power 
the circuit back up and test across the load resistors, measuring 
AC voltage this time. Briefly increase the volume of the input, and 
look for the voltage to read up to about 9V AC output. But keep all 
signal testing brief, to avoid overheating the chips. If you have an 
oscilloscope, look for clipping at about 25V peak-to-peak. Reduce 
the signal to 1V AC output on one channel, and then test the other 
channel; it should also measure 1V AC. Switch the meter to DC and 
confirm that both channels measure 0V DC. Try a speaker in place 
of the load resistor to make sure the output signal sounds like 
clean sine wave. If it all checks out, your board is done and working.

3. MAKE THE CABINET
3a. Download and print the mechanical drawings at makezine.com/23/chipamp. Part A is the chassis front, 
B is the inside back, and C is the outside back. Parts D and E are rails that hold the plexiglass ends and top. 
3b. Cut three 9" lengths of the 2” aluminum angle and four 3" lengths of the 3"×½" aluminum channel. 
Sand the edges smooth.
3c. To protect the aluminum and mark the patterns for drilling 
and cutting, cover the surfaces with masking tape. Transfer the 
markings from the drawings.
3d. On Part C, position the transformer and check the clearance between the switch and transformer 
underneath. Adjust the position of the switch hole to suit your switch, and mark it.
3e. Time to drill. Use a sharp punch and a hammer to dimple the 
center of each hole to be drilled. Drill the smallest holes first. 
TIP: Some holes need to align for assembly: the row of four t" and 
Y" holes on parts A and B; the 1" holes in the D spacers and the bot-
tom corners of A and B; and two Y" holes on parts B and C. For these, 
drill one part, clamp it up to the other part, and mark the hole locations 
with a Sharpie. Punch and drill on your marks, and the holes will match 
up. This is cheating but it works.
3f. For larger holes, drill a small hole first to make the bit easier 
to center. You can also cut large holes with a step bit (aka castle 
bit or unibit).
3g. Use a tapered reamer or round file to open the large holes up 
to their final size. Deburr the small holes with a large drill bit or 
chamfering tool. Deburr the large holes with a round file. Holes C 
at the bottom of part A must be completely smooth. Any burrs 
there might poke into and short out the LM1875 chips.

79
Make:
3h. For the square hole on part B, the input panel, you can drill a 
3" hole and use a ¼" metal nibbler to cut the perimeter. Finish 
the hole with a flat file.
3i. Part C has 2 large areas to cut out. Saw these with a hacksaw or band saw and deburr. Make two 1"×¼" 
shims out of the cut-out material. These will fill a gap between parts B and D.
3j. For the long slots in parts B and C, drill a ¼" hole at the end, 
and saw up to the holes, making ¼" slots with round ends.
3k. Assemble the metal parts to check for hole alignment: two 
3½" screws with acorn nuts at the tops of parts A and B, through 
rails E; #8-32×½" screws and nuts through the matching Y" 
holes on A and B, and B and C; and #4-40×3/8" screws securing 
rails D to the bottom corners of A and B. Adjust the positions of 
any off-center holes with a needle file.
3l. Cut 6"-thick plexiglass into one piece 8½"×24" (for the top) and 2 pieces 24"×1½" (for the sides). 
Notch out the lower corners of the side pieces so they clear the nuts in the D rails. Test-fit these pieces 
and trim to fit.
3m. For the input terminal panel, cut a 1½"×2" piece of Formica 
or other thin, stiff plastic. Tape it inside the input terminal cutout 
on B, then transfer the screw hole positions and cutout shape to 
the plastic with a Sharpie. 
Drill the 3 smaller holes for #4 screws (0.100") and the larger 
hole for the #8 screw (0.16") to mount the transformer. Find 
positions on the cutout area where the input jacks will not 
touch part B’s metal, then drill the plastic and install the input 
connectors there.

4. CONNECT THE OFF-BOARD COMPONENTS
4a. Test-fit the volume knob onto the dual potentiometer shaft. 
Cut the shaft to length, being careful to keep metal bits from 
getting inside the potentiometer.
4b. Referring to the photo of the potentiometer and 3P2T switch 
at right (and the tip below), use 4" wires to connect the following 
input jack and switch terminals: input 1 left to switch 7, input 1 
right to switch 9, input 1 ground to switch 8, input 2 left to 
switch 1, input 2 right to switch 3, and input 2 ground to switch 2.
Use 3" wires to connect switch 6 to volume pot 4, switch 5 to volume pot 3 and 6 (both), and switch 4 to 
volume pot 1.
With 6" wires, connect volume pot 3 and 6 to the star ground wire on the PCB, volume pot 5 to PCB lead 
AD8, and volume pot 2 to PCB I8.
TIP: Recall that with headphone plugs, the tip is the left channel, the ring is the right, and the body or “shield” is 
ground.
4c. Cut the socket end off your extension cord. Near the plug, 
cut out a section of the live wire (the wire connected to the plug’s 
narrower prong). Splice in the inline fuse holder with enough 
slack so you can open it up, and insulate these solder joints with 
heat-shrink tubing. Write “½ A” on the fuse holder, or otherwise 
label it in case the fuse is lost. 
Slide cable sleeving up over the fuse holder and position it so 
it can be pushed back for changing the fuse. Fix one end of the 
sleeve to the cord with shrink wrap or a zip tie, and the other end 
with a loop of double-sided velcro.
4d. Install the speaker terminals, power switch, and transformer 
on parts B and C, running the transformer secondary (yellow and 
black) wires in through the slots. Temporarily screw the PCB to 
part B with screws through the LM1875 tabs. Bend the 2 yellow 
leads to the hooked diode leads H1 and X1, and carefully mark 
where they meet. Do the same for the 1 black center tap lead to 
connect to the ground wire loop at P6–P10. You’ll connect these 
3 wires later, but their lengths are critical because they support 
the upper edge of the PCB.
4e. Measure and note the distances from the PCB ground to the speaker terminal black posts, and from 
the speaker terminal red posts to the amplifier outputs at E15 and Z15. Remove the PCB from the chassis 
and set it aside.

81
Make:
4f. Test-fit the power line cord to the chassis with a nylon P-clip 
on the transformer mounting screw under the switch. Measure, 
cut, and solder the cord’s neutral (wide prong) side to one 
transformer primary lead, and its live (narrow prong) side to one 
switch lead. Solder the other switch lead to the remaining trans-
former primary lead. Insulate all solder joints with heat-shrink, 
and refit the power cord and P-clip.
4g. Disassemble everything and then cut and strip the transformer wires (yellow and black) where you 
marked them in Step 4d. Flip everything over and solder the transformer leads to the PCB.
4h. Solder two 18-gauge stranded wires to the PCB’s ground wire loop and run them to the speaker ter-
minal black posts, trimming their lengths and connecting them to the posts with spade terminals crimped 
and soldered onto the wires. Similarly connect 2 more 18-gauge wires between the PCB’s E15 and Z15 
positions and the speaker terminal red posts. Be careful not to damage the feedback resistors soldered to 
those output terminals.
4i. Crimp and solder a spade lug to one end of a 2" length of 
18-gauge stranded lead, and solder the other end to the PCB’s 
star ground loop P6-P10. This will be the ground connection, 
screwed down at the transformer’s right mounting screw. The 
circuit is now electrically complete. You can test it again to make 
sure it still works.
5. ASSEMBLE EVERYTHING
5a. Put two #8 screws through the plastic feet, pass them up through the Y" holes from underneath 
parts A and B, and secure them with nuts on top. Part A overlaps on top of part B. Install rails D as in 
Step 3k, filling the gap between B and D with the 1"×¼" shims you cut in Step 3i.
5b. Install the speaker binding posts.
5c. Place TO-220 mounting insulators over the t" holes on 
part A, where the chips will bolt down. Use thermal grease if 
they’re mica insulators.

5d. Carefully place the assembled electronics into the A/B 
assembly. Secure the input switch and volume control to the 
front of A with nuts. Install the volume knob. Install the three 
#4 screws that hold the input panel to B, and nut them on 
the back.
5e. Slide part C between the transformer and part B. Install the power switch in part C. From the back, 
pass a #8×½" screw through the transformer mounting hole, parts C and B, and the input panel. Pass 
#8×½" screws through the P-clip holding the power cord, the transformer mounting hole, and parts C and 
B on the speaker side. Nut these 3 screws on the inside, trapping the PCB ground wire lug under one nut 
to ground the PCB to the chassis.
5f. Screw down the LM1875 chips with #6 nylon screws from 
below and metal nuts on top. Don’t use metal screws. The chip 
tabs must be electrically insulated from the chassis.
5g. Connect the speaker ground leads from the PCB to the black 
speaker terminals. Connect the speaker signal leads to the red 
speaker terminals, right to lower and left to upper.
5h. Drop the plexiglass side panels in place in rails D. They’re left loose for airflow.
5i. With washers, pass the #8×3½" screws through the upper corner holes in parts C, B, and A from the 
back. Install washers and acorn nuts on them at the front. Slide one rail E over the long screw from the 
side. Tighten the nut on the screw to hold the E rail in place. Slide one end of the plexi top into the E rail. 
Slide the E rail over the other end and tighten the long screw’s nut to hold it in place.
5j. You're done. Hook it up and take it for a spin!

OPTIONS
Simple Power Amp If you plan to use a single sig-
nal source, you can omit the 3P2T source selector 
switch and wire your input connectors directly to 
the volume pot. 
 And if your source has a volume control of its 
own, you can build the Squelette as a plain power 
amp by replacing the 100K volume pot with a 100K 
resistor to ground for each channel.
Headphones There’s no headphone jack in this 
build, but you can add one by connecting it to pin 4 
of each chip through 150Ω resistors in series with 
the signal leads. This configuration limits current, 
preventing you from accidentally smoking your 
’phones. Insulate the headphone jack body from 
the metal chassis and ground it to P6–P10.
Radio A good mini amp deserves a good mini 
source. For FM stereo, AM, and shortwave listen-
ing, I recommend Grundig’s compact radios. 
RadioShack sells the high-performance G8 model 
for $50.
Speakers Quality speakers make a huge difference
to music reproduction. I polled the speaker experts 
on audiokarma.org for suggestions on good-
sounding compact speakers under $250. We 
recommend the JBL Control 1, the Paradigm Atom, 
the PSB Alpha Series, and the Sony SS-B1000. 
Any of these will provide clean, well-balanced 
sound from your Squelette.
The basic Squelette circuit can be used for other 
applications as well. Install a chip amp inside a 
speaker cabinet. Convert an old tube table radio to 
a powered iPod dock. Make an amplifier to match 
your customized Chumby. 
 Build your own steampunk amplifier, complete 
with brass meters, knife switches, a japanned steel 
cabinet, and a fly-ball governor for voltage regula-
tion. Please! I so want to steampunk one of these, 
but I have always opted for minimalism.

BALANCING ACT
Outfit a toy gyroscope with an electric 
motor to make it run continuously, and 
add an adjustable drive wheel that lets 
it chug along a monorail, balance on 
a string, circle the rim of a pot, and 
perform other tricks.
Anyone who’s played with a gyroscope toy powered by 
pulling a string wound around its axle knows that it’s fasci-
nating, but also frustrating because it runs down so quickly 
and has to be rewound. I decided to make an electric version 
that runs for as long as its AAA batteries hold out — which 
can be at least a half-hour, since the spinning gyroscope 
wheel stores some energy, easing the load on the motor.
 I went through 3 iterations before arriving at this simple 
design, which is easy to build and works well. In addition to 
battery power, the Gyrocar has a small track wheel at the 
bottom that’s friction-powered by the main gyroscope wheel. 
The track wheel drives the Gyrocar along any thin, horizontal 
edge while it bears the gyroscope’s weight, but otherwise 
it doesn’t press against the main wheel, to avoid draining 
energy. Three screws let you adjust the track wheel or disable 
it entirely so that the Gyrocar stays idling in one place.
 I’m sure MAKE readers will improve on my design. And if 
you’ve got access to a metal lathe, you can make an original 
version that isn’t based on the toy.

A  Three AAA batteries power 
the Gyrocar’s motor for 30+ total 
minutes.
B  The plywood motor mount 
holds the batteries on top and the 
motor underneath.
C  The motor’s axle points down-
ward and attaches inline directly to 
the gyroscope axle.
D  The gyroscope wheel hangs 
down and rotates horizontally, 
creating gyroscopic forces. There’s 
no axle underneath.
E  Three screws let you adjust the 
plastic cap’s position to precisely 
engage (or disengage) the gyro-
scope wheel with the drive wheel.
F  The drive wheel turns verti-
cally, centered underneath the 
gyroscope wheel. It’s shaped like 
a biased pulley, and its larger side 
is friction-driven by the gyroscope 
wheel close to the center.
G  A plastic cap attaches the 
motor mount to the bracket that 
holds the drive wheel, enclosing the 
gyroscope. The cap’s thin plastic 
material flexes under the weight 
of the gyroscope, so that the gyro-
scope only engages with the drive 
wheel when the drive wheel bears 
the Gyrocar’s weight.

Staying Up
When a gyroscope (or top) isn’t spinning, gravity just pulls down one side and it falls. But when it spins fast,
gravity’s force on that side is quickly rotated to other positions before the gyro has a chance to fall. As a 
result, the gyro self-corrects, with its axle tending back toward a right angle to gravity.
THE KASHMIR LIMITED: 
BRENNAN’S GYRO MONORAIL
Our Gyrocar was inspired by the work of Louis Brennan, 
the inventor who made a fortune by creating the first 
guided torpedo for the British Royal Navy in the 1870s. 
Brennan spent the rest of his life trying to commercial-
ize monorail systems that used huge gyroscopes for 
balance. He even built a 24-ton gyro locomotive for the 
British War Office and the Maharaja of Kashmir. But 
his ideas never caught on — neat factor aside, it’s not 
practical to devote so much weight and energy to gyro-
scopes when you can simply balance on 2 rails.

BUILD YOUR 
GYROCAR 
START>>
MAKE IT.
Time: A Day  Complexity: Easy
1. MAKE THE MOTOR ASSEMBLY 
1a. Trace around the plastic cap on the plywood sheet. Use a saw 
or router to cut out a disk that size, then file and sand it down 
until it fits flush just inside the cap.
TIP: If you use a hole saw, back the plywood with another piece of wood. 
This ensures that the saw won’t rip the grain on the exit side, so the 
disk will have clean edges. A hole saw also drills a hole in the center, 
which is fine. 
1b. Measure the diameter of the motor, then scribe, cut, and sand 
2 plywood rings whose inner diameters are just smaller than the 
motor and whose outer diameters are about twice the motor’s 
diameter. File or sand the holes until the motor fits snugly inside. 
You can also cut a matching hole in the larger disk, which will give 
the gyroscope wheel more vertical space to fit inside the cap.
1c. The battery pack attaches flat on top of the large disk, so you 
need to make a way for the wires to run through the disk to the 
motor underneath. If you cut a motor-sized hole, use a small file 
or hobby knife to make a small channel deep enough to accom-
modate the wires under the battery pack. Otherwise, drill small 
holes that the wires can pass through, as shown here. 

89
Make:
1d. Drill 3 roughly equidistant pilot holes into the circumference 
of the large disk, and temporarily insert 3 small wood screws.
1e. Glue the 2 small rings together on the bottom of the 
large disk, with all their centers aligned so that the motor 
fits in vertically. 
1f. Test-fit the motor into the disk assembly and route the leads 
out the top. Use the remaining 2 small wood screws to attach
the battery holder centered to the top of the large disk.
2. 
CONNECT THE 
GYRO WHEEL AND MOTOR 
Now we’ll attach the gyroscope wheel to the motor shaft. Getting this connection precise and strong is
the most important part of the build, and you may want to use some ingenuity based on what your gyro 
wheel and motor are like.
2a. Remove the gyroscope wheel from its wire housing and try 
tapping the axle out with a hammer. If it comes free, you can fit in 
a plastic rod, which will make things easier. If the rod is a bit too 
wide to press-fit through the hole, chuck it in an electric drill and 
turn its diameter down by running it against a file. 
If you can’t extract the axle, saw it off and file or grind it down on 
both sides of the wheel.
2b. Use a caliper or micrometer to measure the diameter of the motor shaft. Find a drill bit that’s the 
same size, or a few thousandths of an inch smaller if you’ve fit in a plastic rod. I used a #55 drill bit. The 
center hole you’ll drill in the wheel must grip the shaft tightly, so that it doesn’t detach at high speeds.

90
Make: Volume 23
PROJECTS: GYROCAR
makezine.com/23/gyrocar
2c. As best you can, find the exact center point of the gyroscope wheel. (If you have access to a lathe,
you can chuck the wheel on its outer diameter and drill a center hole on the lathe, skipping to Step 2e.)
If you inserted a plastic rod, push a pin into it where you think the center should be, then hold the pin 
pointing upward and gently spin the wheel like a top to see if it wobbles. Keep adjusting the pinpoint
location and spinning the wheel, using trial and error until you find a good balancing point.
If you filed down the original metal axle, you can scribe crosshairs with a try square set to 45°, mark the 
point with a hammer and center punch, and test-spin the wheel with the pin in the mark.
NOTE: If you have a metal lathe, you might even try making your own gyroscope wheel. 
2d. After you’ve found the center point, drill the hole for the 
motor shaft precisely at that point, as perpendicular to the wheel
as possible.
 
2e. Press or tap the wheel onto the motor, as close as possible 
without interfering with it turning freely. This connection needs
to be tight and strong. You can reinforce it with hot glue. 
3. MOUNT THE TRACK WHEEL 
3a. Download the track wheel mounting bracket template at 
makezine.com/23/gyrocar and print it at full size. Cut and trace 
the outline onto sheet metal, then cut it out with tinsnips and 
bend it with pliers, following the notes on the template. 
3b. Drill the holes in the mounting bracket, as noted on the 
template. 

91
Make:
3c. Use a file or grinding wheel to remove the head of the rivet 
that connects the tension roller to its spring steel leg. This will 
leave you with a free-turning wheel held by a small metal bracket; 
this is the drive wheel, or track wheel.
File or grind down one edge of the track wheel to reduce its
diameter all around. The track wheel will be centered underneath 
the gyro wheel, but you want only one of its circular edges to 
touch the gyro wheel. 
3d. Thread the existing hole in the wheel bracket with the 10-32 
NF tap, and attach it with a #10-32 machine screw and nut to the 
mounting bracket you made. The screw should be about 2" long; 
it mustn’t interfere with the free turning of the track wheel. 
3e. Fit the motor into the plywood rings and route the wires back through as you did in Step 1f. 
3f. The depth of the plastic cap from rim to inside bottom should 
be about ¼" greater than the height of the motor assembly from 
the top of the large disk to the bottom of the gyroscope wheel. If 
the cap is too deep, mark and trim its rim down evenly. 
3g. Turn the cap over and mark a 7"×4" rectangle centered 
on the cap, plus 2 points 7" from the long sides, matching the 
bracket mount holes. Cut out the rectangle and drill the holes 
with a 1" bit.
3h. Secure the bracket and drive wheel to the bottom of the cap 
using two 6-32×2" machine screws, washers, and nuts.

4. ASSEMBLE AND ADJUST 
4a. To simplify construction, you can trim and connect both 
motor wires to the battery pack directly. This way, you turn the 
car on and off by popping one of the batteries in or out. But to 
make my latest Gyrocar easier to operate, I wired a small switch 
into one connection. 
4b. In the rim of the plastic cap, cut 3 slots about ¼" long each, 
sized and spaced to accommodate the 3 screws on the circum-
ference of the large disk. 
4c. Now put the Gyrocar together by fitting the cap over the
3 screws on the disk. Run the motor and fix the cap’s position
so that the gyroscope doesn’t press against the track wheel
constantly, but only when the Gyrocar is resting on the track 
wheel and the thin plastic cap flexes slightly under the gyro-
scope’s weight.
 
4d. Finally, adjust the screws that hold the drive wheel bracket 
to the cap so that the Gyrocar remains upright as it runs, rather 
than leaning to one side. You want to center the Gyrocar’s center 
of gravity, and the holes in the bracket are large enough for some 
adjustment room. That’s it; you’re done! After these 2 adjust-
ments are made, you won’t have to make them again.

HIGH-WIRE ACTS
You can use a large cooking pot as a simple track 
for your Gyrocar, or you can make a track that 
offers more interest. I used an old band saw blade 
½" wide by 64½" long that worked very well as a 
track for my Gyrocar. 
 To hold the blade upright, I cut some 1"-wide 
blocks of wood out of standard 2" wooden furring 
strip and cut a ¼" deep slot in each with a thin saw 
blade. You can watch videos of the Gyrocar running 
on this track at makezine.com/23/gyrocar.
 If you adjust the Gyrocar so that its track wheel 
doesn’t turn, it will rest comfortably on a taut 
string — even travel along the string if it’s raised
or lowered. 
 I’ve built a few Gyrocars with different designs. 
For one of them, I used foamcore board instead
of plywood, which I covered with colored foil
wrapping paper. I also covered the battery pack 
with a hemispherical spray-can lid, all of which 
gave the Gyrocar a flying-saucer look.

PARADOX BOX
Last year I saw a video of the “Leave Me 
Alone Box” built by Michael Seedman. 
Flip its switch on, and an arm reaches
out of a door to turn the switch back off. 
That’s what it does, that’s all it does, and 
it will not stop until its circuit is dead.
I had to have one of my own, so I made one. Seedman’s design 
uses a microcontroller to run two servomotors: one to open 
the lid, and another to push the switch. This makes for an 
impressive performance, but seemed too complicated, and 
actually, his circuit remains powered even when the box is idle.
 For existential purity, I wanted a super-simple machine that 
really turned itself off. So I came up with a single-motor design 
controlled by a 555 timer chip, with a curved arm that both 
lifts the lid and flips off the switch. I called it the “Most Useless 
Machine” and posted it on Instructables along with a YouTube 
video of the box in action. The project soon went viral, attract-
ing millions of viewers, thousands of comments, and many 
builds and design variations. Whew!
 Along the way, Instructables member Compukidmike came 
up with an even simpler version that dispenses with the 555 
circuitry entirely by using a gearmotor and two switches. The 
resulting project, presented here, is the ultimate in technology 
for its own sake, a minimal assemblage of parts that, through 
its one meaningless act of defiance, speaks volumes.

PROJECTS: MOST USELESS MACHINE
Illustration by Rob Nance
The Most Useless Machine has a toggle switch, a motor, and a micro lever switch.
The toggle runs the motor forward or backward, depending on which way it’s ﬂ ipped. 
Running forward, the motor swings a wooden arm that ﬂ ips the toggle switch the 
other way. The motor then runs backward, and as the wooden arm returns to its 
original resting position, it triggers the lever switch to cut the power off.
The plain-looking box A  has a hinged lid and a toggle 
switch on the outside.
Inside the box, a 4×AA battery pack B  powers the
motor. 
The motor C  is a gearmotor whose built-in gearing 
gives its small DC motor enough torque to move a 
wooden arm. 
When the motor runs forward, the curved wooden 
arm D  swings up, pushes open the lid, and knocks 
into the toggle, switching it the other way.
The toggle switch E  is a double-pole double-throw 
(DPDT) switch that’s wired to feed power to run the 
motor forward or backward, depending on how it’s 
switched.
The micro lever switch F , located under the wooden 
arm, is a single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switch. It’s 
wired from its normally closed (NC) pin to cut the 
motor-backward power when the wooden arm pushes 
down on its lever.
CONTROL SEQUENCE:
1. When the machine is idle, the circuitry is fully
powered down. The toggle switch is in its “off” position. 
Inside, the lever switch is held down in its Off position 
by the wooden arm. 
2. When a person ﬂ ips the toggle switch “on” (forward), 
it powers the servo to rotate the arm into the toggle 
switch and ﬂ ip it back “off” (reverse).
3. Once the toggle switch is ﬂ ipped “off,” the servo moves 
in reverse until the arm rests on the lever switch, which is 
the real Off switch. This shuts the motor off again.
Turn-ons and Turn-offs
ORIGINS
The Most Useless Machine has a proud heritage.
The ﬁ rst machine that simply switched itself off was 
built by information theory pioneer Claude Shannon in 
1952, based on an idea by artiﬁ cial intelligence pioneer
Marvin Minsky. The device sat on Shannon’s desk at 
Bell Labs, and in 1958, sci-ﬁ  author Arthur C. Clarke 
dubbed it “The Ultimate Machine” in Harper’s Magazine 
and in his nonﬁ ction book Voice Across the Sea. Since 
then, knockoffs and variations on the theme have 
ranged from mass-produced novelties to works of art.

MAKE IT.
Time: An Afternoon  Complexity: Easy
1. PREPARE THE BOX
One half of the lid hinges up, while the other half carries all of the machine’s workings. The workings all 
mount onto the same piece so that they’ll stay aligned.
1a. Remove any latches and hinges on the box’s lid.
1b. Cut the lid approximately in half through the middle cross-
wise, undercutting at a slight angle so that the hinged half won’t 
bind when opening. (You can see this undercut in Step 2c or the 
overview illustration on page 96.) Before you cut, make sure the 
machine half has at least enough space to fit both the motor and 
the micro switch lined up lengthwise.
2. DETERMINE THE LAYOUT
2a. Use the pencil to draw scale paper templates of the motor, 
toggle switch, micro switch, and the machine half of the lid, all in 
side-view, and cut them out. Also cut a template for the motor’s 
mounting wheel or horn, and mark the axle on both the motor 
and mount templates.
Photography by Ed Troxell

99
Make:
2b. Use the component templates to figure out the shape of 
the arm and how everything should attach to the lid. Download 
sample templates at makezine.com/23/uselessmachine. You 
want the back of the arm (or a mounting horn) to push against 
the lever switch when it’s retracted. Then the arm should rotate 
and clear the lid while its “hand” swings over and pushes the 
toggle switch.
Cut templates for the arm and for a standoff bracket that holds 
the motor and the lever switch. Refine their shapes and sizes and 
move the pieces of paper around until you’re sure that they all 
work together, while still leaving room for wire connections.
2c. Mark the positions on the templates where they meet: the 
toggle and bracket’s position on the lid, and the motor and 
switch’s position on the bracket.
2d. Trace the template shapes onto ¼" plywood and cut the 
pieces out. File and sand the edges smooth.
2e. Mount the arm to the motor’s mounting wheel or servo horn. 
Drill 5" pilot holes in the arm and mount it with small screws 
(usually included).
2f. Measure and mark a centerline across the machine half 
of the lid, perpendicular to its cut end. Then mark the toggle’s 
distance along this line, following its position marked on the 
templates.

3. BUILD THE CIRCUIT
3a. Now it’s time to fire up the soldering iron. If your motor 
already has leads attached, solder them to each of the 2 middle 
legs of the toggle switch. Otherwise, cut, strip, and solder wire 
leads between each motor terminal and the middle toggle pins; 
4" long is plenty for all connections in this circuit, and you may 
want to shorten them later for neatness.
3b. Solder a short jumper wire diagonally between 2 opposite 
corner legs of the toggle switch, then solder separate leads to
the remaining 2 legs at the other corners.
3c. Solder the 2 free leads from the toggle to the lever switch. 
Connect one to the common tab (marked C), closest to the 
lever’s pivot. Connect the other lead to the normally closed (NC) 
leg, farthest from the pivot. Don’t connect anything to the 
normally open (NO) tab in the middle.
3d. Solder the battery pack’s leads to the 2 legs at either end of 
the toggle. The circuit is complete! Test it by loading batteries 
into the pack. The motor should run, the toggle should reverse its 
direction, and the lever switch should shut it off in one direction. 
If it all checks out, remove the batteries, leave the toggle thrown 
in the direction that the lever interrupts, and mark or note this 
direction on the motor. 
4. ASSEMBLE AND ADJUST
4a. Drill a ¼" hole in the machine side of the lid, at the toggle 
position you marked in Step 2f.
4b. Fit the toggle switch up through the hole, positioned with the 
toggle thrown in the direction opposite the lid cut. Don’t glue it 
in yet.

101
Make:
4c. Hold the wooden bracket, motor, and lever switch in place 
against the lid so that they align properly with each other and 
with the toggle. Mark their positions with the pencil.
If the motor turns in the opposite direction from what you antici-
pated while determining the layout (if the interruptible direction 
turns the arm out, not in) you should reverse the connections to 
the motor, or else position the motor the other way and arrange 
the pieces in mirror-image on the opposite side of the box.
4d. Temporarily hold all the pieces in place with a bit of hot glue. 
Put the lid on the box with the other half off, load the batteries,
and check to see that everything works perfectly (which is 
unlikely).
4e. Tweak the components’ placement and the shape of the arm 
as needed, ungluing and regluing with hot glue, until everything 
does what it should. You may need to file down part of the arm
so it clears the bottom of the box, or fine-tune the position of the 
all-important micro lever switch.
When everything checks out, mark the final locations. Then 
mount the motor to the bracket with its included screws and 
attach the other components in place with permanent glue.
4f. For the other half of the lid, replace (or install) the hinges on 
the narrow end opposite the machine half, drilling 5" pilot holes.
4g. At this point, you should have a fully functioning Useless 
Machine. Don’t wear it out!

CUSTOMIZED USELESSNESS
The Most Useless Machine, like Claude Shannon’s 
original, is a desktop or tabletop conversation piece.
I went with a minimal aesthetic that leaves it most 
open to interpretation, but you can dress it up by 
labeling the switch positions, using a recognizable 
object like a doll’s arm for the arm, or otherwise 
decorating it.
 On a much larger scale, Swiss artist Hanns-
Martin Wagner built a version that used an old 
wooden trunk as a box, a weathered prosthetic 
arm, and an air compressor for power (see below).
 I was amazed at the response to my original 
Instructable. Everyone wants one of these boxes, 
and wants to share details of their own build! Its 
social appeal was also shown this past spring,
when the Birmingham, U.K., hackerspace FizzPop 
(www.fizzpop.org.uk) hosted a Useless Machine-
making workshop led by Nikki Pugh (at right).

Have you ever wanted fruit or vegetables that are 
out of reach? Ever found it difficult to fit that long, 
store-bought fruit plucker in your car? Well, here’s 
how you can make your own collapsible fruit picker 
in about 5 minutes.
1. Attach the wire loop.
If you’re using PVC pipe instead of a tent pole,
drill a hole in the end of one pipe segment. Loop the
wire through the hole and twist it around itself so
it will hold. We made a big loop to pick big tropi-
cal fruits, but you can make a smaller loop to pick 
smaller fruits like apples and pears.
 If you’re using a tent pole, you can wrap the wire 
around one end of the pole below the flange, so the 
wire won’t slip off the end.
2. Connect the PVC segments together 
with the couplings.
Don’t glue them, just slip-fit them so you can disas-
semble the picker for easy storage and portability. 
They should fit together firmly. 
3. Tie the rope around the wire loop.
Because the pipe is just held together with a friction 
fit, you’ll need the rope to pull down the fruit.
Use It.
Go pick some fruit. Use the pole to raise the wire 
loop over the fruit you want, until the loop is above 
the fruit and around its stem. Then pull on the rope 
to yank the fruit off. Watch for falling fruit!
We use our fruit picker in Hawaii to collect jackfruit 
(shown here); the edible seeds are the consistency 
of macadamia nuts, but the flesh surrounding them 
is what’s really good to eat. We also pick breadfruit 
(delicious when buried in the embers of a beach 
bonfire for 40 minutes), and coconuts. 
 These are all large fruits, and they’re often out of 
reach. We went to Hawaii for years without being 
able to harvest the breadfruit and coconuts we 
desperately wanted. The fruit picker helps us reach 
the tantalizing fruit.

Programmable logic
controllers never fail.
By Tim Hunkin
Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are
industrial computers about the size of a brick. 
Like microcontrollers, they loop through a list of 
instructions that repeatedly polls their inputs and 
generates outputs. But PLCs are larger and more 
expensive than microcontrollers, and they have 
much slower cycle times — usually no faster than 
10 loops per second, unless you plug in special 
extra modules. And instead of programming them 
with C++ or BASIC, you use an arcane language 
called ladder logic (described later in this article).
 Given these disadvantages, you’d think PLCs 
would have become extinct, but they’re widely 
used because they’re so reliable, durable, and 
easy to install. PLCs typically control large-scale 
machinery like roller coasters or factory produc-
tion lines, and I use them for all the coin-operated 
amusement machines I make. Although I often 
think I’ll change to PIC microcontroller chips,
I haven’t, because PLCs keep improving and 
many are now affordable secondhand on eBay.

PLCS
RUGGED AND UNSTOPPABLE 
An hour’s downtime in a factory is very expensive, 
so PLCs are designed to work reliably no matter 
what. I may make lots of mistakes getting a PLC 
program to run, but once it works, it will usually 
keep working reliably forever. The bricks work in 
extremely hot, cold, or humid conditions, and are 
unaffected by electromagnetic interference. You 
can switch them on and off at will without worrying 
about crashing hard disks or corrupting data. 
 I recently bought a used PLC from a carwash 
company and it arrived with water dripping out of
it. I nearly sent it back, but out of curiosity I tried 
plugging it in. It worked perfectly, and has ever 
since. An engineer from Rockwell Automation told 
me he’d found a PLC in a tea factory that was com-
pletely full of tea leaf dust but had been working fine 
for more than ten years. 
 When a PLC does finally fail, you can replace it 
easily using just a screwdriver — no circuit boards 
or soldering. Figure C shows a modern PLC “brick” 
with 2 rows of screw terminals, one for inputs such 
as switches and sensors, and one for outputs such 
as transistors and relays (the red rectangles).
 There’s even a small, built-in power supply for the 
sensors. That way, engineers configuring assembly 
lines or conveyors (Figure D) can plug in standard-
ized sensors and pneumatic rams, rather than 
having to design and build circuits from scratch.
RELAY AND LADDER LOGIC
PLCs evolved out of the era when all industrial 
process control and machine tool control was done 
with relays. Entire computers had been made of 
relays, most famously the Z3, built by German com-
puter pioneer Konrad Zuse in 1941. Machines often 
had rows of cabinets full of relays wired together, 
and on an even larger scale, telephone exchanges 
were literally whole buildings full of relays.
 Alongside these relays there were ingenious 
electromechanical devices like time-delay relays, 
cam timers, and uniselectors. Time-delay relays 
have piston dashpots that slow the movement of 
the relay contacts. Cam timers use geared motors 
to turn mini camshafts that operate a row of micro 
switches. Uniselectors are stepping relays that use 
a series of pulses (particularly the old telephone 
dialing pulses) to move contact wiper arms to many 
different positions.
 Relays needed a lot of wires. Figure A shows the 
circuit for a single flip-flop, which is controlled by 
a normally open set switch and a normally closed 
reset switch. Closing the set switch charges the coil, 
which closes the relay. If you then open the reset 
switch, the current is interrupted and the relay 
opens.
 The first PLC, designed in 1968 by a company 
called Modicon (Modular Digital Controller), used 
solid-state elements to replace cabinets full of 
such relays. To program these digital logic arrays, 
Modicon developed ladder logic, a language that 
mimicked the logic used with relays. Programs were 
structured like ladders, with each rung represent-
ing an IF-THEN rule. IF the conditions of the virtual 
inputs or relay contacts along the left are met, 
THEN a relay coil on the right will be energized. The 
program executes each step of the ladder, then 
jumps back to the beginning again and continues
to loop through the rules indefinitely.
 Translated into ladder logic, our flip-flop relay
circuit looks like Figure B. Ladder logic was designed
so that ladders could be drawn using fixed-width 
ASCII characters. For example:
 Normally open switch:  
-| |-
 Normally closed switch:  
-|/|-
 Normally open coil:  
-( )-
 Normally closed coil:  
-(/)-
 In our flip-flop ladder rung, M1 represents one 
of hundreds of individually addressable relays in 
the PLC. A relay’s switch and coil components are 
treated separately in ladder logic, so M1 refers to 
both parts.
 To program a PLC, you hook it up to a PC via a
serial cable, and then run an interface application 
that lets you write and upload your programs. You

can draw your programs as ladders, or write them 
as series of instruction codes, which is the method 
I prefer. And instead of using a computer, you can 
also write and edit instruction code from a handheld 
keypad, but these only show a few lines of code, so 
it’s hard to keep track of what you’re writing.
 Programmed as instruction codes, our flip-flop 
relay becomes:
LD X1
OR M1
ANI X2
OUT M1
 The LD (load) command starts a new rung on
the ladder, OR and ANI mean logical OR and AND-
Inverted, and OUT outputs to coil M1. 
 Converting equipment from relay logic to ladder 
logic running on a PLC makes it simpler. One of 
my older coin-op machines, The Doctor (Figure G), 
writes and dispenses an illegible prescription form. 
I made the original version in 1987 using relays, and 
its correct operation depended on a lot of micro 
switches triggering everything in the right order.
 A few years ago I replaced the relays with a 
PLC and was amazed how much less cluttered it 
became. The accurate timers in the PLC made half 
the original micro switches redundant. The machine 
is now much simpler, more reliable, and even has 
a xenon beacon that flashes when the prescription 
forms run out.

PLC HISTORY: WIDE TRACES 
AND RUBBER HAMMERS
Modicon introduced the PLCs to replace cabinets 
full of relays with a digital equivalent. They devel-
oped a new architecture so processors would be 
fast enough to simulate ladders of fast-switching 
relays within a high-level processing language.
 To make PLCs more reliable than the computers 
of the time, they increased signal-to-noise ratio by 
making everything bigger: larger ferrite cores for 
memory and wider tracks on the circuit board. They 
also avoided fans; outside air could carry dirt and 
cause corrosion.
 Modicon engineers built a test chamber called 
“the blue box.” A PLC had to run for a minimum of 
24 hours in arctic and tropical conditions. It was 
then vibration tested, run next to a Tesla coil to test 
electromagnetic interference, and hit repeatedly 
with a rubber hammer.
 PLCs soon grew more sophisticated, supporting 
mathematical functions and flowchart programming 
to run subsections of the ladder. Real-time clocks 
were added, but never widely used because they 
were irrelevant to most industrial control. They rep-
resented the year with just 2 digits, which I suspect 
inspired some of the “millennium bug” panic.
 Several years ago, soft PLCs came out. These 
turned Windows PCs into ladder-programmable 
PLC-alikes, but they never caught on. Small, limited 
operating systems are more reliable than anything 
running on top of a complete PC operating system.

PLCs TODAY: SMARTER 
AND MODULAR
Computers are more reliable today than they were 
in the 1970s, so PLCs now use many of the same 
chips, often ARM RISC processors. However, today’s 
PLCs are still built to run in tough environments. 
 They still have no cooling fans, and work at tem-
peratures up to 140°F (60°C), far hotter than any 
PC. They also still work next to a Tesla coil; I’ve tried 
it. (The input filtering that lets them work in strong 
electromagnetic fields is the main restriction on 
their clock speed, limiting it to about 100Hz.)
 Today’s PLCs have plug-in modules for motion 
control of servomotors, industrial modems for 
remote operation, and SCADA interfaces (supervi-
sory control and data acquisition) that diagram and 
manage entire industrial processes from a touch-
screen (Figure E). PLCs can also connect to distant 
motors or sensors via a network, which saves lots of 
wiring. Some factories link all their PLCs together, 
but many network systems are incompatible, and 
a network failure can make a whole factory grind to 
a halt. For this reason, some companies, including 
Ford, prefer to keep their machines separate.
 At the other end of the spectrum, there are now 
simple PLCs called intelligent relays (Figure F), 
designed to replace just one or two relays or timers. 
E
F
These are programmed graphically in logic blocks, 
quite similar to a Lego Mindstorms controller. It’s 
easy to get a simple program to run on these, but 
I find them very frustrating. If a program has more 
than a few logic blocks, it’s difficult to arrange them 
on-screen so that all the connections remain visible. 
Every edit tends to cover up some of the connec-
tions. Last year, while helping a friend put together 
a giant sculpture clock, I spent three days inside a 
cramped steel sphere cursing his “intelligent” relay.
 Generally, though, I’m a huge fan of PLCs. Even 
their limitations have advantages for me. Being
restricted to a limited number of slow-switching, 
on/off digital outputs forces me to keep my 
machines cheap and simple.
 For a simulator ride, my PLC will just trigger a 
CompactFlash card video player to start playing. 
The PLC then controls the motion by timed on/off 
outputs to the actuators. There’s no communica-
tion with the video, but they stay quite adequately 
in synch, and the jerky, unrealistic movements are 
amazingly effective.
 I wish computers were more like PLCs. They don’t 
need their enormous complexity for most tasks they 
perform, and they could certainly be more robust. If 
only every computer were built to be dropped, run 
next to a Tesla coil, and hit with a rubber hammer.
Trained as an engineer, Tim Hunkin has worked as a cartoonist (The Rudiments of Wisdom), a television writer and presenter 
(The Secret Life of Machines), and as a designer, builder, and curator of museum exhibits. Since 2001 he has been obsessed 
with his amusement arcade, Under the Pier Show, in Southwold, England, when not distracted by building enormous clocks.

AMUSEMENT MACHINES 
The reliability of PLCs is important to 
me because people get cross if they
put money in one of my coin-operated 
machines and it doesn’t work.
 Many of my machines use a Mitsubi-
shi FX0-30. This has 14 outputs, which 
is enough for machines like Test Your 
Nerve and Microbreak (Figure H). Some 
machines need more outputs, so my 
Expressive Photobooth (Figure I) uses 
an FX0N-60 with 24 outputs. Some, 
like Mobility Master-class, use an FX1S, 
which has more program memory.
 I stick with Mitsubishi for compatibil-
ity, but their recent budget PLCs (FX1S, 
FX1N) are infuriating because the 
surface-mount LEDs that show input/
output status are really difficult to see.

Want to know the height of a person or building?
Using simple trigonometric principles, you can 
closely estimate the height of objects with an easy-
to-make hypsometer (hyps means height in Greek).
1. Make it.
Tape the straw along the top of the card. Punch a 
small hole in the right side of the card, 10cm from 
the bottom. Straighten the paper clip, bend one end 
into a small hook, and hang it in the hole so it swings 
freely. Next, write numbers 0 to 12, 1cm apart, from 
right to left across the bottom of the card, starting 
with 0 directly beneath the hanging paper clip, pro-
ceeding leftward to 12. Here’s a tip: If you use a thick 
plastic bag instead of the card, your hypsometer 
can be rolled up and carried in your pocket.
2. Test it.
Standing 10' away, look through the straw at the 
top of a friend’s head. When you tilt your head (and 
the hypsometer), the paper clip will move leftward 
at an angle as gravity keeps it pointing down at the 
ground. In Figure 2, it points to number 1.
 By measuring your distance from an object (in 
centimeters) and the angle of tilt indicated by your 
hypsometer, you can calculate your friend’s height.
 
3. Calculate it.
You’ll need 2 more numbers for your calculation:
the height of the card (10cm), and the height of your 
eye line, measured from the ground. You can also 
measure from the top of your head, then subtract 
this number from your height. For instance, if you’re 
5'8" tall and your eyes are 4" from the top of your 
head, your eye line is 5'4", or 164cm, off the ground.
 Metric measurements are much easier to calcu-
late with a hypsometer, because metric is a base 10 
system. Use a metric ruler, or write equivalents on 
your hypsometer as shown in Figure 3.
 Multiply the distance to your friend (10' or 305cm) 
by the angle number indicated by the paper clip (1), 
then divide by the card height (10); in this case, you 
get 30.5. Add this to your eye line height (164cm),
for a total of 194.5cm. That’s about 6'3" tall. 
Now test your hypsometer with objects of unknown 
height, such as doors, walls, and buildings, to cali-
brate it and sharpen your measuring skills.

WILDERNESS WORKSHOP
Build your own inexpensive yet sturdy 
worktables and shelving. By Charles Platt
Recently I had a problem and an opportunity.
The opportunity was to move my little prototype 
fabrication business from an industrial park in 
Southern California to a beautiful wilderness retreat 
in Northern Arizona.
 The problem was that I didn’t have much time or 
money. Could I establish an entire workshop within 
a couple of months, starting from bare earth and 
ﬁ nishing with all the tools and benches in place? 
And after I paid the construction costs, could I 
install the ﬁ xtures for less than $1,000? (I already 
owned all the tools.)
 In some ways this challenge was a blessing in
disguise. If you have to be fast, you can’t be fancy, 
and if you have to be cheap, you can’t be self-
indulgent. This would not be one of those jobs that 
drag on for months because the details become
an obsession in themselves.
WORKSHOP
DIY
 I speciﬁ ed a work area of 19'×24' to allow ample 
space for lifting, rotating, and cutting 4'×8' sheets of 
plastic and plywood. To minimize heat loss, increase 
security, and maximize wall space, I decided not to 
have any windows, but I did include a massive sec-
tional roll-up garage door. The climate where I live 
is so benign during most of the year, you can work 
comfortably with a door wide open. And during the 
winter, a sectioned door on tracks can be quite well-
insulated.
 After establishing the basics, I stepped back and let 
the contractors get to work. There was no way I could 
do the construction myself in the time available.
Free-Standing Benches 
In less than a month I had a bare box standing on 
a concrete slab. It was insulated, drywalled, and 
painted. Now for the interesting part: I wanted to 
111
Make:

avoid all the frustrations and errors associated with 
the workshops I had used previously over the years.
 The big central work area allowed me to place 2 
free-standing benches of a design that I had always 
wanted but had never seen. They would be stocky 
tables, each 4' square. Placing them centrally would 
allow me to walk around them while building heavy 
items such as furniture, and a 2" gap between them 
would facilitate saw cuts.
 I stopped using a table saw a few years ago when 
one of them kicked a piece of plastic at me that 
almost shattered my arm. Since I don’t have enough 
money or space for the kind of vertical panel saw you 
see at Home Depot or Lowe’s, I like to lay the wood 
ﬂ at and use either a handsaw or a handheld circular 
saw, which I run along a clamped straightedge. My 
plan was to align these cuts with the gap between 
the tables. This would be like using sawhorses, but 
much more accurate and less aggravating.
 With my helper Shawn Hollister, I built the tables 
lower than a typical workbench, so that we’d be able 
to reach across them or climb up onto them when 
making long cuts. We gave them protruding lips so 
that I could apply clamps easily, and made them 
heavy to minimize vibration (Figures A and B). 
Plastic Bins for Tool Storage
For tool storage, I’m unenthusiastic about the usual 
options. Tools hanging on pegboard pick up dust 
and dirt, and when you buy an extra tool, you have 
to move the others around to make room. As for 
tool chests, they’re expensive, and you have to walk 
to and fro every time you want something. 
 My preferred method is so cheap, it’s almost 
embarrassing: plastic tubs from the local big-box 
store. I group tools in tubs by function, so that when 
I want, say, a metal ﬁ le, I pull down the tub contain-
ing all the various shaping tools and put it on my 
worktable. Now I have a full range of options within 
arm’s reach. As for small items such as screwdriver 
bits and hole saws, I put them in small boxes inside 
the tubs. At the end of a job, everything is returned 
to the tubs and stays clean and neat, with the lids 
snapped on tight.
Shelves That Don’t Sag
Where to put the plastic tubs? On shelves, of 
course, above the side benches where I have a drill 
press, compound miter saw, band saw, and belt 
sander, the four tools I consider indispensable for 
the kind of work I do. But how should the shelves be 
built? Quickly and cheaply!
Fig. A: The tabletop is a 4'×4' sheet of ¾" plywood, 
braced and edged with 2×4s. The table legs are 4×4s. 
Fig. B: Two tables a couple of inches apart allow long 
cuts across big sheets of plywood or plastic, by running
the saw through the gap between the tables. The 
extended table edge allows quick, easy clamping.

 Since I don’t like the look of sagging wooden 
shelves, I chose steel shelves of the type sold for 
warehouses. A standard length is 4', so you don’t 
need many uprights to support them, but they still 
take heavy loads without bending. You can bolt 
them to wooden uprights instead of the ugly perfo-
rated vertical bars that are normally used.
 I chose melamine-coated particleboard for the 
end pieces, because it’s available in exactly the 
same 11¼" width as the shelves, and it’s preﬁ nished, 
requiring no painting. I cut the melamine board 
into sections, drilled them to ﬁ t the holes in the 
ends of the shelves, and bolted them on. Then I cut 
2×4s into rails 47" long and screwed them into the 
wooden studs behind the drywall in my conventional 
framed construction. We hung the shelves on the 
rails, adding a couple of nails to prevent the shelves 
from falling off (Figures C–E). That was that. 
 The horizontal rails must be a full 47" so that the 
load carried by the shelves is spread across the 
entire wooden support. Any unsupported metal
section will tend to bend. 
NOTE: Since melamine board is made from 
compressed wood chips, it can come apart, so 
you should use pine boards for uprights if you 
intend to load your shelves very heavily. Or 
place an additional 47" rail beneath each shelf. 
Tighten the bolts to the max, to take advantage of 
the friction between the end of the shelf and the 
upright. Friction is proportional to the force perpen-
dicular to the surface, and it supports a load more 
effectively than just the shaft of a bolt in a hole 
drilled through wood.
A Wood Rack on Wheels
Another problem was how to store materials
efﬁ ciently. I have to stock wood and plastic in bulk, 
because the nearest retail sources are 50 miles 
away. I dislike stacking sheets against the wall 
where I can’t pull anything out easily, so my answer 
was a wood rack on wheels (Figures F and G). I’ve 
never seen this elsewhere, but it seems an obvious 
idea to me. When you don’t need it, you roll it out of 
the way, into a corner. I used heavy galvanized wire 
to make dividers in the rack, so that I would lose as 
little horizontal space as possible, and I put a ﬂ at 
top on it, where I could stack small pieces of scrap, 
with even smaller pieces in some more plastic tubs. 
 As for seldom-used, bulky tools such as bolt 
cutters and reciprocating saws, I stashed them all

in plastic toolboxes that I placed under the benches 
against the wall. The boxes aren’t strictly necessary;
you can just scatter your tools on shelves. But I 
wanted to keep them clean and categorized. In a 
shared workshop, when all storage is labeled, you’re 
less likely to misplace things (and less likely to argue 
with each other when you can’t ﬁ nd something).
1.3 Kilowatts of Illumination
The last consideration was in some ways the most 
fundamental: lighting. If you can’t see what you’re 
doing, you can’t do good work. I splurged about half 
of my $1,000 ﬁ xtures budget on some GE Ecolux
54-watt high-intensity daylight-spectrum ﬂ uores-
cents, and suspended them from cables stretched 
from wall to wall below the track of the garage
door. When all 24 tubes are glowing they draw 
almost 1.3kW, and so to reduce energy consumption 
I installed a separate pull-switch on each ﬁ xture,
with a chain dangling, so that I can obtain light only 
where I need it.
 During daytime, we don’t need the lights at all. 
We open the huge door and feel as if we’re working 
outside, which is an absolute delight compared with 
the basement workshops I’ve used over the years. 
It’s also a lot more pleasant than the industrial 
park that was my previous environment. When the 
breeze wafts in and I can look across 30 miles of 
national forest to a distant mountain, it deﬁ nitely
alleviates the tedium of cutting and shaping 
components. Bees from a nearby nest sometimes 
invade the space, but to discourage them we simply 
sprinkle some xylene on a rag and leave it lying 
around. They dislike the smell of this industrial 
solvent even more than I do.
 My workshop isn’t going to be featured in 
Architectural Digest. It was obviously outﬁ tted on 
a budget. But I couldn’t be happier with its func-
tionality. Tools are easily accessible and don’t get 
lost, the space is uncluttered and easy to clean, the 
lighting reveals every little detail, and as a result, the 
work ﬂ ow is fast and accurate. Most important, the 
pleasure of working in an outdoor ambience is very 
special indeed. 
 It certainly justiﬁ es the hassle of moving every-
thing from California.

If you’re organizationally challenged like me, then 
you probably have a garage or shop full of tools and 
parts that are just everywhere. That’s how it used 
to be for me; whenever I needed some tool from my 
shop for a project around the house, it usually took 
longer to round up everything I needed than it did to 
actually do the job.
 Sometimes I couldn’t ﬁ nd what I needed and had 
to go buy another at the store; later I would stumble 
upon what I couldn’t ﬁ nd earlier. I knew I had to get 
organized. But how?
 There are many products you can buy to help 
you get organized, such as storage bins, parts bins, 
cabinets, shelves, and hanging racks. I had tried 
bins, but they’re more for long-term storage and it’s 
hard to see what’s in them.

for: nuts and bolts, screws, nails, staples, wire-nuts, 
and any other small parts that usually end up in a 
junk drawer. 
 These containers are pretty easy to install. I hung 
them underneath some shelving. The 100-pack
containers are extra deep to hold lots of parts.
1. Remove the spindle from the base. Most brands 
just pop off with a little effort (Figure A).
2. Drill holes for the mounting screws. I drilled my 
holes in the existing circular protrusions for added 
strength (Figure B).
3. Arrange the bases. I could ﬁ t 3 containers per 
section under my shelves so I built a simple jig to 
place them all the same distance apart. The slots in 
the base ﬁ t right onto the jig.
 Once 3 bases were in the jig, I taped them in 
(Figure C). Then I could just turn the jig over and put 
them all in place under the shelf.
4. Screw the bases to the shelf. I used 3 screws per 
container (even though I drilled 4 holes) and they 
hold plenty of weight (Figures D and E).
5. Mount the container. The container snaps into 
place with a twist (Figure F) and you can easily see 
what’s in it. Figure G shows a mounted container
full of long screws.
While these CD/DVD parts containers didn’t solve 
all my organizational problems, they were a catalyst 
and a starting point for me to get organized. I put
up pegboard, built shelving, put long-term storage
in bins, and recycled or threw out stuff I just didn’t 
need.
 I can now say that things have greatly improved, 
and ﬁ nding stuff no longer takes up more time than 
actually doing the project. As an added bonus I even 
save money because I’m not re-buying things that
I couldn’t ﬁ nd.

COMPRESSED EARTH 
BLOCK FLOOR
Lay your own earthen brick ﬂ oor for 
about $60. By Abe Connally and Josie Moores
When considering what material to use for a ﬂ oor, 
few people look beyond a concrete slab, with some-
thing like tile or carpet as a ﬁ nish. For us, however, 
a brick ﬂ oor made of stabilized compressed earth 
blocks (SCEB) was far more appealing. 
 Why? It’s cheaper than concrete, and it’s easier
to do yourself. It requires less people power, and
it doesn’t have to be done all in one go. It’s beautiful
as is — no need for tiles or anything else on top. 
And it has a better thermal mass quality, saving you 
heating and cooling costs.
 A 130-square-foot ﬂ oor took 2 inexperienced 
people — one passing the bricks, one laying them — 
just 2 hours to pave, once the area had been leveled, 
and cost only $60. An additional couple of hours 
HOME
DIY
and $40 are required to seal it. 
 Using mortar between the bricks increases the 
price and time a little, but saves effort and varnish 
when sealing the ﬂ oor. However, for the beginner, 
laying your bricks without mortar and sweeping 
sand into the cracks is easier, and that’s the method 
we discuss here. 
1. Prepare the area.
Prepare your subﬂ oor, perhaps adding a vapor 
barrier, heating system, or insulation if you wish.
 Put a 1" layer of ﬁ ne-screened sand over the 
entire area. Compact and level the sand. The easiest 
way to do this is to bury and level a length of square 
tubing in the sand on either side of the room, so that 
117
Make:

the top of the metal is ﬂ ush with the level you want 
the sand to be (Figure A). You then bridge another 
piece of metal across the 2 pieces of square tubing, 
so that it sits on top of them, and drag it backward 
and forward over the area until it’s smooth. 
 Set up your boards and tools where you’ll begin 
working. It’s often best to start along the room’s 
straightest edge, so that your ﬁ rst row of bricks fol-
lows a good line. Also, it’s easier to begin near where 
the bricks are coming from, so that the person 
handing you bricks can use the ﬁ nished part of the 
ﬂ oor to walk on, instead of having to set up more 
boards to walk on.
2. Pick a pattern.
Running bond may be the easiest pattern to get your 
feet wet, but none of them are hard (Figure B). Her-
ringbone can be difﬁ cult to visualize, but once you 
get going, it’s not nearly as intimidating as it seems. 
3. Cut or break the bricks.
Whichever pattern you choose, you’ll need some 
half bricks. Try and work out roughly how many 
you’ll need for your starting edge, and cut those 
ahead of time. You can do the ones needed at the 
other end of your rows, once the rest of the ﬂ oor 
is laid. Cut the bricks using a circular saw with a 
masonry blade. A dust mask is a good idea, as this 
kicks up a bunch of very ﬁ ne dust.
 If you’re not too particular about the edges of 
your cut bricks, it’s far easier to break them instead 
of cutting. We did this by turning a piece of angle 
iron upside down, so that its corner is pointing 
upward. We then hit the metal with the brick at the 
point where we wanted it to break. It’s a little ragged, 
but you can clean it up with a chisel or hammer.
4. Lay the main section of the ﬂ oor.
Place each brick, one by one, where you want it to go. 
With the long level, check that each brick is level with 
previously placed bricks or with existing ﬂ oors that 
you wish to match. With the short level, make sure 
the brick itself is level in all directions. You also want 
to check that it’s lined up well with the wall. If the ﬁ rst 
brick is angled just a little, so that one side is closer to 
the wall than the other side, this will be highly visible 
by the time you lay an entire row of bricks.
 Use the rubber mallet to tap the brick tight against 
its neighbors (Figure C). Then tap down on it if nec-
essary to get the level correct. Add or remove sand if 
necessary. Bear in mind that the bricks themselves 
are not always smooth — they may rise slightly at 
the edges. If you wish, you can sand these edges 
down by rubbing them with another brick or a trowel.
 When you reach the opposite end of the wall and 
don’t have a brick to ﬁ t in the space, leave it. You’ll 
place all the edge bricks at the end. 
 Even before the ﬂ oor is ﬁ nished, you can walk on 
it, but don’t tread near the unﬁ nished edges.
5. Lay the edge bricks.
You may have to measure each space and cut or 
break bricks to ﬁ t. Alternatively, you can ﬁ ll the edge 
gaps with a very ﬁ ne concrete when you do the
perimeter. Be sure to check that the edge bricks 
(and pieces) are level with the main ﬂ oor.
6. Fill the perimeter with concrete.
Once you’ve laid the main bricks and edge bricks, 
you can ﬁ ll in the perimeter — in between the bricks

Compressed earth blocks (CEB) You can find these 
at building supply stores. Most are stabilized with 
about 5%-10% Portland cement to make them 
more water-resistant.
Screened sand If you buy sand, it will have been run 
through a screen to remove large pebbles and 
other detritus. We made a sifter with some hail 
screen (1"–¼" welded mesh) and screened sand 
from the local riverbed to remove the rocks.
Concrete mix You’ll use a little concrete around the 
perimeter of your floor only.
Sealer Use an acrylic or oil-based concrete sealer
or varnish that can handle moisture.

Boards to stand on (2) You don’t want to stand on 
the sand, because your feet will make large dents. 
When you stand on a board, your weight is spread 
out and the smooth surface of the sand isn’t 
compromised.
Surgical tape (optional) When laying the brick,
tape your fingertips with surgical tape. This helps
protect them without compromising dexterity.

and the walls — with concrete. This doesn’t use 
much concrete, and can be done in half an hour. Mix 
your concrete with screened sand, and then trowel it 
smooth and level with the tops of the bricks. Do this 
along the entire perimeter of your ﬂ oor, and then let 
the concrete dry completely (Figure D).
7. Fill the cracks with sand.
After your concrete perimeter is dry, sweep ﬁ ne sand 
into all the cracks between your bricks (Figure E). 
 Allow the ﬂ oor to settle for a couple of days, and 
then sweep more sand into the cracks. Repeat this 
several times until the sand no longer settles.
8. Seal the ﬂ oor.
To seal the bricks so that you can sweep and mop 
them, use an acrylic or oil-based concrete sealer 
or varnish. Until you’ve sealed them, the bricks will 
be coated in a ﬁ ne dust as you gradually wear them 
down; this is OK for a patio or outdoor ﬂ oor, but it’s 
not as acceptable indoors. 
 Use a roller to spread the sealer, and a brush to 
coat any cracks that the roller can’t penetrate. Give 
it at least 2 coats. The difﬁ culty in sealing arises 
from the sand in the cracks where the bricks join. As 
you roll the varnish on, the roller picks up sand and 
spreads it over the bricks. To avoid this problem, wet 
the sand down beforehand and use a sealer that’s 
not compromised by moisture (many concrete 
sealers are designed to help cure concrete, meaning 
that they trap the moisture inside and allow the 
concrete to dry more slowly). 
 
NOTE: The sealer will darken the natural color 
of the bricks (Figure F). 
Most concrete sealers and varnishes have a strong 
smell. Always provide adequate ventilation, and plan 
to keep those windows open for a few days.

THE MICRODOODLE
Convert an old-school microﬁ che reader 
into a magnifying machine. By Mister Jalopy
What is a microdoodle? Well, I made the term up! 
It’s a microﬁ che reader recast as a social magnify-
ing machine! 
 Before the internet, businesses used microﬁ che 
(pronounced micro-feesh) machines to read trans-
parencies of documents shrunk to micro-size.
Real estate agents consulted city plat maps, and 
libraries had newspapers shrunk to allow easier 
storage of archives. 
 Not as powerful as a microscope, an old micro-
ﬁ che reader is a wonderful machine for amateur 
naturalists, with a big screen that friends can 
gather around.
1. Get a microﬁ che machine.
Real estate agents, catalog salesmen, and libraries 
were top users of microﬁ che machines, so start 
your search there. Having found three sub-$20 
microﬁ ches within a week, I wouldn’t pay much.
Be patient and a microﬁ che will ﬁ nd you (Figure A). 
 Before buying one, plug it in to verify that the 
bulb hasn’t burned out, as replacements are 
frightfully expensive. Verify that the focusing knob 
still works. My microﬁ che was broken, which made 
for a little project-before-the-project. 
2. Clean it up! 
Blow off your microdoodle with compressed air

and then soap it up with window cleaner (Figure B). 
An old T-shirt is an almost lint-free cleaning cloth 
that is ideal for this purpose. 
3. Grease the rollers.
Whether you’re lubing car door hinges, drawer 
slides, or a microﬁ che carriage, white lithium 
grease is the professional choice for good lubrica-
tion. Just a tiny amount will do the job (Figure C).
4. Clean the interior optics.
A light is projected through the bottom and
reﬂ ected off a perfect mirror onto the semi-
opaque screen. Since the tiniest dust speck will 
appear jumbo-size, pop out the screen (Figure D), 
blow the inside out with compressed air, and use
a scant bit of window cleaner on the mirror. 
5. Place an object to view.
Microﬁ che pages were about 4"×5" so there is 
ample room to place a leaf, butterﬂ y wing, feather, 
or other thin object in the ﬁ che carrier (Figure E).
 For $4, I bought a set of prepared slides that 
included a fruit ﬂ y, wool ﬁ bers, a slice of bamboo, 
and bunch of other great stuff (Figure F). What
a deal!

TIME-LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY
WITH A MACBOOK
Make mini movies from a command line. 
By Nir Yariv
When a blizzard hit New York City last winter, I found 
myself without a camera, but with a spare MacBook 
laptop computer. So I decided to try and take some 
time-lapse photos of the storm with its built-in 
iSight camera. Here’s how I did it.
Snapping the Frames
First I installed free iSightCapture software, which 
lets you control the MacBook’s camera from the 
command line. To test it, I opened an OS X Terminal 
(Applications  Utilities  Terminal) and entered:
/Applications/isightcapture ~/test.jpg
 The camera’s green light ﬂ ashed and a newly cap-
tured photo named test.jpg appeared in my home 
directory. (Note that before you run iSightCapture, 
you need to turn off any other program that uses the 
camera, such as Photo Booth, or you’ll get an error.)
 My next step was to write code to make iSight-
Capture take pictures at a ﬁ xed interval. I chose Ruby

122 Make: Volume 23

for this task, since it’s a nicely readable language that 
comes pre-installed on every modern Mac.
 Here’s the script in its entirety, which I saved into 
a ﬁ le called timelapse.rb. You can also ﬁ nd this code 
at makezine.com/23/diyimaging_timelapse:
# Conﬁ guration settings — edit to your needs. 
path = “~/lapse” # Directory where images will be 
stored. Must exist and be writable.
duration = 4 * 60 * 60 # Time to run, in seconds
(4 hours here)
interval = 5 * 60 # Time between each photo, in
seconds (5 minutes here)
# Start working...
end_at = Time.now + duration
i = 0
while Time.now <= end_at do
 i += 1
 system ‘say “cheese”’ 
# comment out if sound 
not wanted
 system “/Applications/isightcapture #{path}/%05d.
jpg” % i
 sleep interval
end
 Move this script into your home directory and
create an empty path folder in the location speciﬁ ed
at the top of the code. Then you can launch the 
script from Terminal by entering:
ruby timelapse.rb
 The script should start taking pictures at the 
given interval, and save them to the path folder 
under incremental ﬁ lenames like 00001.jpg, 00002.
jpg, and so on (Figure A, inset). It will run for the 
duration set in the duration variable, or you can 
Ctrl-C to stop it sooner. If you have more than
one computer, you might want to make the path
a shared folder, which lets you access its contents 
and check progress from another machine.
 The optional ‘say “cheese”’ line uses OS X’s built-in 
say utility to make a sound when a photo is taken.
Creating a Clip
With a sequence of up to a dozen photos or so, you 
can string them together into an animated GIF, 
which will play anywhere, as a loop, and will embed

more easily than ﬁ les in standard video formats. 
Free GIFfun software (stone.com/GIFfun) lets you 
easily import all the photos from path and assemble 
them into an animated GIF (Figure B).
 With large numbers of frames, the GIF ﬁ les
become unwieldy, so it makes more sense to
convert them to a video format, which uses com-
pression. Another free tool, FFmpeg (ffmpeg.org), 
can help with that. If you have MacPorts installed, 
you can install FFmpeg with a simple command:
sudo port install ffmpeg
 Manually installing FFmpeg is beyond the scope
of this article, but Stephen Jungels has a good
guide at makezine.com/go/jungels. Once FFmpeg
is installed, you can create a video with:
ffmpeg -f image2 %05d.jpg lapse.mpeg
 FFmpeg is a powerful utility with many other
capabilities. It isn’t known for its ease of use, but 
with a little searching you can ﬁ gure out many more 
fun ways to use it.

videos, I’d love to see them! Please feel free to send

SOLAR CAR SUBWOOFER
Self-sufﬁ cient station-wagon 
sonic splendor. By Henry Herndon
Toyota has been advertising the “solar roof” option 
for its Prius, which is basically a solar panel that 
powers the cabin ventilation fan on hot and sunny 
days. But what they don’t tell you is, you can have a 
solar roof on any car!
 Last July I set up my own solar roof for a 2,300-
mile road trip, and it worked like a charm, supplying 
me with laptop charge and ample stereo bass the 
whole way. (One of my prime objectives for the 
system was to power my subwoofer, because what’s 
a road trip without awesome tuneage?)
 The setup was simple. Power came from an 
80-watt solar PV panel that I bolted to my station 
wagon’s roof rack. I ran the power down through
the rear hatchback to a charge controller and 2 
lead-acid gel batteries behind the driver’s seat.
 With the resulting 12V DC power, I was able to 
run a subwoofer ampliﬁ er for the stereo and a small

MATERIALS AND TOOLS
Car with roof rack or roof rails
Solar panel, 40W–150W, 12V system compatible
See the “Choose a Solar Panel” section. I used 
an old 80-watt Photowatt module borrowed from 
my roof.
Small (5A–10A) charge controller (optional) You 
won’t need this if your solar panel has integrated 
charge control or if it’s tiny (less than 10 watts).
I used an M20 from BZ Products (bzproducts.net), 
since replaced by their model M20+.
Subwoofer amplifier and speaker for car stereos,
12V DC I used a 15-year-old Legacy brand 600-watt
sub that came OEM in a Chevy Equinox.
Battery or batteries, 12V lead-acid, sealed
See the “Choose the Battery” section. Available
at RV and boating stores; don’t buy online 
because the weight usually makes shipping very 
expensive. I used 2 tired old 33Ah Power-Sonic 
batteries, each 7¾"×5¼"×7".
Electrical tape 
2×2 lumber (2) long enough to run the width of
your roof rack. Actual dimensions: 1½"×1½".
U-bolts (4) to fit through roof rack
Nylon insert lock nuts (8) matched to U-bolts
Flexible plastic tubing enough for 4 short lengths
to fit around U-bolts
Machine screws and nuts (4) for attaching PV panel 
to lumber
Fuses with fuse holders: 10A–15A and 30A–50A 
Two good options are ¼" blade type (ATC) fuses 
or glass cylinder “car stereo” fuses. I neglected 
to use fuses (aside from the charge controller’s 
internal fuses) but you should! Luckily, I’ve been 
spared any disasters. There is some benefit to 
using a fuse block, but this strays from the KISS 
(keep it simple, stupid) ideal of the project.
Landscape lighting cable, 12-gauge minimum
10- or 8-gauge is better.
Inverter (optional) to plug in laptops, etc. I used
a High Gear 300-watt inverter.
Push-button switch (optional) for turning off the 
amp. I used a “Hazard” flashers push button
scavenged from a junkyard BMW.
Choose a Solar Panel and
Charge Controller
You’ll need to match the PV panel to the shape and 
size of your car’s roof, but also make sure that its 
expected daily output (peak watts × typical peak 
sun hours) will cover your expected daily load (total 
watts used × usage hours).
 Also make sure the panel is designed for 12V 
battery charging systems; these will typically have 
36 cells and open circuit output between 18V–20V. 
Most panels will ﬁ t the bill, but avoid the newer 
type that works with super-high-voltage grids. And 
if a panel is priced more than $5 per watt, you can 
probably ﬁ nd a better deal.
 PV systems need a charge controller to keep the 
battery from getting overcharged. Some PV panels 
designed for small systems have charge control 
built in. This can be the simplest way to get a system
running, but it’s often less cost-effective than using 
a separate charge controller.
 Some controllers, like the Morningstar SunSaver 
and Steca Solsum 6.6, include a low-voltage dis-
connect that prevents the battery from draining too 
low under small loads. Completely draining a lead-
acid battery hurts its performance, so this is a nice 
feature.
Choose the Battery
Pick a battery size using a similar calculation to
sizing the panel. Your expected amp-hour (Ah)
usage during non-sunny times (watts × hours /
12 volts) should be less than 2/3 times the battery’s 
amp-hour rating (to ensure no more than a 2/3 
discharge). For more capacity, connect 2 batteries 
in parallel, which is what I did.
 Also check your charge controller’s documenta-
tion for minimum battery size recommendations. 
Controllers are often designed to work with a mini-
mum battery capacity.
 In an enclosed car, you must use a sealed lead 
battery, rather than the less expensive ﬂ ooded 
kind that’s typically available at auto parts and 
warehouse stores. Flooded batteries are unsuitable 
because they emit explosive gases during charging, 
they tend to accumulate corrosive acidic residue 
near their vents, and they can spill acid if you don’t 
keep them upright.
Installation
My car’s roof rack made mounting the PV panel 
easy. I attached lengths of 2×2 lumber perpendicu-
lar to the rack’s rails using U-bolts and Nyloc nuts, 
slipping plastic tubing around the bolts to protect 
the rails (Figure B, following page). After more than 
3,000 highway miles, I noticed no loosening or 
deformation of any part.
 My PV panel’s frame consists of aluminum
C-channel with holes in back for mounting. So
I drilled holes through the 2×2s and used machine 
screws to attach the panel to the wood, securing 
them with nuts inside the aluminum channel.

MUSIC
 I stashed the charge controller and batteries
behind the driver’s seat (Figure C), and the sub
amp and speaker box under the passenger seat.
I located the small inverter in the middle, on a cable 
long enough to let it reach the front seat and charge 
my laptop and other gadgets. All of the equipment 
stayed out of my way and didn’t interfere with fold-
ing the rear seats down.
 To connect it all, I used landscape lighting cable 
because it’s weatherproof, widely available, and inex-
pensive. For the interior, you could use any insulated 
wire 12-gauge or heavier.
 I ran the output cable from the PV cell through 
the rear hatch rain gasket (Figure D) and up to the 
charge controller, simply stringing it over the interior 
carpet and around the back seat.
 For switching the amp on and off (to save battery 
power), I wired a switch in between the amp’s
+12V DC and Remote Turn-On terminals. The switch 
I used was a “Hazard” push button from a dash-
board, which seemed appropriate (Figure E).
 To protect your equipment, install fuses on the 
wires from the positive terminals of the battery and 
the PV panel. Locate the main fuse (30A–50A) on 
the battery, as close as possible to its positive termi-
nal. A 30-amp fuse will support 350 watts of load.

 Insulate all connections well with electrical tape 
to protect them from short circuits caused by 
jostling in the car, especially the battery posts and 
the main fuse holder. Make sure that no wires are in 
a position to get frayed or yanked. If you use crimp 
terminals, crimp them tight; the wire should break 
before it comes out of the crimp.
 You can add inverter outlets or cigarette lighter 
receptacles to a system like this; auto parts stores 
have many options for serving multiple circuits.
I can see systems like this being worthwhile for
avid car-campers. Many RVers put up solar panels; 
why should they have all the fun?
 I already had all the equipment for this project, so 
it was a no-brainer for me, and it kept me supplied 
with charging power and sweet tunes for two weeks, 
all the way up and down the West Coast. While pow-
ering a car subwoofer may not be the most practical 
use for solar power, it brought a smile to my face

EASY PITCH CONTROL HACK
Make audio circuits sing higher and lower. 
By Peter Edwards
Here’s an easy way to add a pitch adjustment to 
audio circuits such as the ones in many kids’ toys, 
in order to greatly enhance their circuit-bending 
potential.
 All you have to do is replace the circuit’s ﬁ xed 
clock-speed resistor with a variable resistor (aka 
potentiometer) and a limiting resistor, wired in 
series (Figure A). 
 Then, simply turning a knob will dial the circuit’s 
base pitch up or down, which not only raises and 
lowers the sounds it generates, but can also unlock 
bizarre hidden behaviors.
 Overclocking the pitch of some audio circuits 
makes them malfunction and spit out random 
sounds and melodies. And setting the pitch very
low can reveal micro-modulated tones that are 
otherwise impossible to hear. Fun!

MATERIALS
Digital audio circuit, battery-powered and fairly 
simple Kids’ toys are fair game; they’re cheap and 
easy to find, and they usually make lots of differ-
ent sounds. For this article I used a Multi Voice 
Changer megaphone sold under the Toysmith and 
Tech-Gear brands.
Potentiometers The value of the pot used will vary 
from project to project, so it’s good to have an 
array on hand: 1kΩ, 10kΩ, 100kΩ and 1MΩ.
Resistors The value used will vary between 1kΩ and 
10kΩ. I suggest buying in bulk from mouser.com, 
or getting a sampler pack from radioshack.com
or jameco.com.
Knobs to fit potentiometers
Insulated wire, around 22-gauge
Heat-shrink tubing, 1" or ¼" diameter
TOOLS
Soldering iron and solder
Wire cutters and strippers
Screwdriver to disassemble toy or other circuit 
source
Multimeter or ohmmeter
Alligator clip leads (4)
Drill and drill bits for mounting the potentiometer
in the housing
Resistor substitution box (optional) 
Audio Circuit Clock Speed
All digital audio electronics rely on a clock, which 
determines the rate at which the circuit produces 
and processes data. With circuits that generate 
audio, the clock speed typically determines a base 
pitch that all outputs then derive from. 
 With most cheap audio circuits, this clock speed 
is set by the value of a resistor sitting between the 
circuit’s power supply and the main chip’s clock 
speed node, or sometimes between 2 clock speed 
nodes on the chip. This is the clock speed resistor, 
aka pitch resistor, and the quick hack described 
here works for circuits like this.
 Other audio circuits set their clock speed using 
a crystal or inductors, so adding a pitch control to 
them requires more involved circuitry. You’ll start 
this project by determining whether or not your 
circuit has a clock speed resistor. If you follow the 
steps below and still can’t ﬁ nd it, you probably have 
one of these other guys, and you should ﬁ nd a
different circuit to modify.
NOTE: This project is the simplest way to add
a pitch adjustment to audio circuits that have a 
pitch resistor. More complicated methods allow 
for a wider pitch range and ﬁ ner tuning.
Resistor Substitution Box
For finding ideal potentiometer and limiting resistor 
values, I use a resistor substitution box. You can buy 
these, but I built one myself in about an hour. It has 
5 pots wired in series: 1kΩ, 10kΩ, 100kΩ, 1MΩ, and a 
fancy 10-turn 1kΩ pot with a 3-digit dial that I liber-
ated from some old test equipment (substitution: 
Mouser part #882-DC22-10-1K, $75). 
 
Connecting the box into a circuit and adjusting 
its knobs from top to bottom lets you zero in on the 
value that works best for any set resistor. Then you 
simply read the resistance off the box using an ohm-
meter. A toggle lets you switch over from infinite 
resistance.
 
I use my resistor substitution box a lot, to dial 
in resistor values that determine pitch, brightness, 
motor speed, and other circuit characteristics.
!
CAUTION: Unless you’re a trained electrical 
engineer, you should only work on circuits that are 
battery powered, or that use a very low-amperage 
power supply (50mA or so). Poking around inside 
high-voltage and/or high-current circuits can be fatal.

1. Find the pitch resistor.
First, open the device you intend to hack. Make sure 
you put all the screws in a safe place! Examine the 
circuit board and try to ﬁ nd the audio generator or 
“brain” of the circuit. This is usually a black blob 
covering a proprietary chip; these are also called 
“gumdrop” ICs. With my Voice Changer toy, this was 
on the green, solder-pad side of the board rather 
than the yellow, component side (Figures B and C). 
 If your circuit has no gumdrop, the biggest chip
is likely to be where the audio signal is generated.
(If your circuit has no chips at all, you’re probably 
dealing with an analog circuit. This is a different 
beast altogether, and it requires different steps to 
modify than the ones outlined here.)
 Once you’ve found the brain, look for the closest 
resistor, which is usually on the reverse side of the 
board (Figure D), because 9 times out of 10 this will 
be your pitch resistor. Test your theory by touching 
the resistor’s leads while the circuit is making sound. 
If you’re right, the pitch should jump up or down.
 If you hear no change, lick the tip of your index 
ﬁ nger and touch other parts of the board to see if 
they affect the pitch. When you ﬁ nd a spot, narrow 
down your search (start using your pinky) until 
you’ve found a single point or two at a resistor that

generation IC, which is often a black blob “gumdrop.”

alter the pitch. If you still can’t ﬁ nd this, your circuit 
may not be using a resistor to set the clock speed.
2. Swap in a potentiometer.
Once you’ve found the clock speed resistor, make 
a note of its value by reading the stripes. Turn the 
circuit off or remove its batteries. Unsolder the 
resistor and remove it from the board, then solder 
2 wires about 8" long to the same contacts. These 
wires will attach to a potentiometer.
 To ﬁ nd the best value of potentiometer to install,
I use one of 2 different methods. The quick and dirty 
method is to just multiply the value of the original 
pitch resistor by 10 and try a pot that’s roughly
the same value. If the original value is 15kΩ, for
example, replace it with a 100kΩ potentiometer. 
 Clip the pot to the leads with alligator clips, one to 
the middle wiper leg and the other to either of the 
ﬁ xed contacts. Then power up the circuit and see 
how the pot performs. You may need to try a few 
values before you ﬁ nd the right one.
!
WARNING: Don’t turn the potentiometer 
all the way up at any point during your testing. 
Turning the pot to zero resistance can fry your 
circuit.
129

MUSIC
 A better method for ﬁ nding a proper potentio-
meter is to connect in a resistor substitution box 
(see sidebar on page 128). Twiddle the knobs to 
ﬁ nd a resistance range that affects the pitch nicely 
(Figure E, previous page), then measure the resis-
tance across the box and round it up to your nearest 
potentiometer value.
3. Install a peak-limiting resistor.
To limit the peak pitch and avoid damaging your 
circuit, you also need to add a limiting resistor. Clip 
your chosen potentiometer into the circuit, then 
carefully turn it up until the pitch is as high as you 
want it to go. Glitching is ﬁ ne, and part of the fun. 
You’ll be safe so long as the output stays within a 
pleasant and musical range — but if you go too far, 
you’ll get a one-way ticket to burnt-out-circuit-land.
 Use an ohmmeter to determine the potentio-
meter’s resistance when it’s turned as far as you 
dare, and ﬁ nd a resistor that’s about the same
value. This will usually be between 1kΩ and 10kΩ.
If you don’t have an ohmmeter, I suggest starting 
with a 1kΩ resistor. It may need to be increased 
some, but it will work in many cases.
 Solder the resistor to one of the leads from the 
board (Figure F) and insulate the connection with 
heat-shrink tubing (Figure G). Then solder and 
insulate a short lead to the other side of the resistor.
4. Mount the pot and close up
the housing.
Solder the potentiometer to the free leads from the 
board and the limiting resistor (Figures H and I). 
Then choose a location for your pitch adjustment 
knob, making sure there’s room inside for the back 
of the pot. For my Multi Voice Changer, I picked a 
prominent spot on one side of the megaphone’s bell 
(Figure J). 
 Drill a hole for mounting the potentiometer, and 
add the knob on the outside. Once that’s done,
carefully replace the circuit board and close up
the housing. Done!

LILY PAD POOL WARMERS
Use hula hoops to heat your swimming 
pool using the sun. By Edward Hujsak
Here’s an easy way to warm your pool that’s 
efﬁ cient, low-cost, safe, and actually enhances 
the beauty of the pool. The Lily Pad pool warmer 
doesn’t need to be removed to swim, sweep, or 
vacuum, and it meets new requirements in water 
conservation areas to keep at least half of a pool’s 
surface covered. 
 Best of all, the Lily Pad pool warmer can be 
made by anyone who’s just a bit handy with tools. 
It’s made of hula hoops, with black polyethylene 
ﬁ lm stretched over them to actually warm the 
water they come in contact with.
The Attractive Solution 
The Lily Pad pool warmer uses black (low albedo) 
polyethylene ﬁ lm stretched over hula hoops. The 
ﬁ lm is in contact with the water, so it captures and 
transmits most of the sun’s incoming radiation 
directly into the pool, warming the surface of the 
water. Calorimetric tests have shown that at high 
noon, a single Lily Pad will transmit more than 500 
BTU per hour.
 As a bonus, this solution is highly attractive. 
Since it doesn’t need to cover the entire pool, it 
gives the appearance of a dynamic sculpture as 
the pads nudge each other and form constantly 
varying patterns across the surface. 
 To swim, it’s not necessary to remove the pads. 
Half the pool area is open, and the bow wave ahead 
of a swimmer causes the pads to ﬂ oat aside. If you 
want to open the entire area for swimming, the 
pads can be removed in less than 5 minutes. And 
they can be seasonally stored in the boxes in which 
the hula hoops are shipped. My experience has 
shown that it’s also not necessary to remove the 
pads for sweeping or vacuuming the pool.

Make:

1. Mod the soldering iron.
Polyethylene ﬁ lm can be easily spot-welded to 
hula hoops made of the same material, by using a 
slightly modiﬁ ed soldering iron. 
 Add a simple guide to your iron so that it self-
guides along a spot-welding path that’s uniform 
around the entire hoop. To do this, just add a bar 
that extends 1½" past the tip of the soldering iron. 
Clamp the small metal bar onto the barrel of the 
soldering iron, using a scrap of metal as a spacer 
between, so that the guide stands 2" away from 
the iron’s tip (half the width of a hula hoop). Use 
small hose clamps to secure the guide (Figure A). 
 After you’ve made the guide, grind the tip of the 
soldering iron to a ﬂ at surface of about 1" diameter. 
2. Build a jig for assembly.
Since an average pool may require 50 or more Lily 
Pads, it’s handy to build a simple jig for quicker 
assembly (Figure B).
THE POOL OWNER’S DILEMMA 
The thermal behavior of swimming pools is
complex, due to a number of factors that act to 
cool the water, while the sun and artificial means 
work to keep the water warm. Cooling forces are 
at work day and night, and include evaporation, 
conduction into surrounding soil, air current 
effects, and nighttime longwave (infrared)
radiation into space. 
Gas-fired heaters are the most common pool 
warmers, but up-front costs for equipment and 
installation run into the thousands of dollars.
And then there’s the operating cost and the price 
of natural gas. These heaters are prodigious
polluters; for an average-sized pool, a 1°F rise
in temperature results in spewing 50lbs to 60lbs 
of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 
Roof-mounted solar heaters are a second option. 
Water from the pool is pumped through solar-
heated heat exchangers and returned to the pool. 
Like gas-fired heaters, solar heaters are costly and 
are generally unsightly. They’re also a problem in 
frost-prone areas. 
Bubble plastic blankets are passive devices that 
cover the pool. They function mainly as water 
conservation devices by inhibiting evaporation, 
thus slowing evaporative cooling. They also block 
nighttime radiation loss. 
Manufacturers claim these blankets also behave 
as warmers, transmitting additional energy from 
the sun into the water. But water already has 
a very low albedo (ratio of incident energy to 
reflected energy). It’s about .10 for deep water,
a bit higher in white-bottomed pools, and it’s 
doubtful that bubble covers improve on that. 
(The low albedo of water is the reason for the 
great concern about the receding of the polar ice 
caps. Open water warms much more rapidly than 
ice fields, which reflect more than 80% of the 
sun’s energy.)
Moreover, pool blankets destroy the aesthetic 
appeal of a backyard pool; they’re hard to manage, 
difficult to clean, and unsafe where small children 
are around; and they’re often dumped after a 
single season.
MATERIALS AND TOOLS
Black polyethylene film, 6 mil commonly used by 
landscapers and builders
Hula hoops, 30" diameter (50 or more) You need 
enough to cover at least half your pool’s 
surface. These can be purchased from school 
sports suppliers all over the web for about 
$2.50 per hoop; in my experience, the shipping 
usually costs more than the hoops. 
Metal bar, 1"×½" for the spot-welding guide.
This should be 1½" longer than your soldering 
iron’s shaft.
Small hose clamps (2) 
¾" MDF, plywood, or particleboard for the
assembly jig turntable. You need a disc the 
same diameter as your hula hoops, usually 30".
2×4 fir lumber: 6' length (1) and 8" lengths (2) 
That’s one 6-footer and two 8-inchers.
Brads, ½" or longer (8–9) for the assembly jig
Carriage bolt, ½"×6", with matching nut 
and washers
Metal bar, about 36" long (optional) to cool the 
spot welds. Aluminum or steel is OK. Instead, 
you could use the back of the small bar (your 
spot-welding guide), but you’ll have to cool it
in water frequently. 
Small electric soldering iron
Drill with ½" bit
Box cutter or utility knife with sharp blades

132 Make: Volume 23
OUTDOORS

 Made of common materials, the jig is just a long 
handle and a rotating circular platform that holds 
the hula hoop securely while you spot-weld the 
polyethylene ﬁ lm to it.
 Cut a disc of plywood or other ﬂ at, sturdy mate-
rial that’s 30" in diameter (or the diameter of your 
hoops). This is your turntable. Drill a ½" hole in the 
center.
 Center a hula hoop on top of the disc, and mark a 
circle on the disc along the inner edge of the hoop 
(about ¾" in from the edge).
 Hammer in brads along the inner circle you 
drew, spacing them evenly about 10" apart.
 Lay the three 2×4s ﬂ at. Drill a ½" hole in the 
center of each 8" length, and a ½" hole centered
4" from the end of the 6' length.
 Take the 6-footer, stack the two 8-inchers on 
top, and lay the turntable on top of that, aligning all 
the holes. Attach them all with the carriage bolt.
3. Prepare the black plastic
and the hoops.
The polyethylene ﬁ lm circles should be cut about 
1" bigger than the hula hoops all around, 31" for a 
30" hoop. Using a hoop for a template, cut out the 
circles with a sharp box knife or scissors (Figure C). 
If needed, use a piece of cardboard under the ﬁ lm 
as a safe cutting surface. Cut all the ﬁ lm circles you 
need before moving on to the spot-welding. 
 I discovered the hard way that hula hoops are 
not watertight. Seal the joint by wrapping a few 
turns of electrician’s tape around the joint and over 
the adjacent staples (Figure D). Don’t worry about 
spot-welding in this area. 
 Now we have watertight hoops and circles of 
black plastic ready to be united. Here’s how I did it.
4. Make your Lily Pads.
Lay the hula hoop on the rotating assembly jig. 
Stretch the polyethylene ﬁ lm over it, and hold the 
ﬁ lm in place using the 6 clamps, evenly spaced 
around the circumference (Figure F, following 
page). I marked the turntable every 60° to make 
spacing easier (Figure E).
 Make 2 spot welds on either side of each clamp, 
always holding the ﬁ lm taut when you’re welding 
(Figure G). Work from one side to the other, turning 
the hoop around on its rotating jig. 
 Immediately after each spot weld is made, it’s 
necessary to ﬂ atten and cool it. This is best done 
with a 36" bar of metal laid across the diameter of 
the ﬁ lm (Figure H). Alternatively, you can use the

back of the soldering iron guide, chilling it in water 
after every few welds. 
 Spot-weld the remainder of the ﬁ lm to the hoop, 
with spot welds about 1" apart, including the area 
under the clamps. Soon enough, the feel of the 
operation will become obvious. A little practice on 
a test piece is recommended.
 Once the spot welding is completed, trim the 
overhanging ﬁ lm with a sharp box cutter, rotating 
the table against the knife (Figure I).
 Finally, use the tip of the soldering iron to 
puncture 9 small vent holes in the ﬁ lm, one in the 
center and the rest distributed in a circle of about 
24" diameter. Without these vents, vapor bubbles 
would form under the stretched polyethylene, and 
lower the heat transfer.
 You’re done! Now make more.
Maintenance 
Like any pool cover, the Lily Pads will gather dust 
and dirt over time. The pads are easily cleaned 
using a water detergent solution, then rinsing 
(Figure J). In pools where the water hasn’t been 
changed for a long time, evaporation of water from 
the surface of a pad will leave a salt deposit. In this 
case, cleaning is best done with an acid solution, 
while wearing rubber gloves (1 cup of pool acid to 
2 gallons of water, then rinse). Cleaning restores 
the ﬁ lm to a like-new condition. Judging from the 
condition of the Lily Pads at the end of one season, 
the useful life could be three or more years. Should 
a spot-welded bond come apart, it can be easily 
repaired.
 Save the boxes in which the hula hoops are 
shipped. These make a handy place to store them, 
off-season. 
TIP: When using Lily Pads, it’s best to operate 
the pool pump at night only. When the pump 
operates, the skimmer will draw warm water 
(created at the surface by the pads) into the 
ﬁ lter and return lines, where heat is lost by 
conduction. This is true of all blanket pool 
warmers.

COLLEGE BIKE TRUNK
Make a lockable carry-all box from sheet 
metal. By Frank E. Yost
Growing up, I would often visit my grandparents in 
Dinkytown, the southeast Minneapolis neighbor-
hood near the University of Minnesota that was 
named after the freshman cap worn there a century 
ago. I remember seeing students on ten-speeds 
carrying their stuff in milk crates that they strapped 
to the rear rack with bungee cords. 
 Inspired by that image, I wanted something
better and more secure. Car drivers can lock things
up while running errands, so why should cyclists 
have to carry everything around with them?
 So I designed this sheet metal bike trunk. I sized
it to hold two 1-gallon jugs of milk with a little room 
to spare. Its top angles away from the seat like a 
saddle does, so nothing rubs against the rider. And 
its 2 latches will accept 2 padlocks to secure the 
contents against casual theft.
1. Cut and drill the trunk pieces.
Download the project templates from makezine.
com/23/diyhome_biketrunk and print them at full 
size. Cut them out, and tape them onto the sheet 
metal using double-sided tape, or else cut holes in 
the templates and stick masking tape over the holes. 
 Trace around the edge of each template with a 
ﬁ ne permanent marker, and use tinsnips to cut out 
pieces A1/A2, B1, C1/C2, and D1. Don’t cut apart 
A1 and A2 or C1 and C2 yet. After cutting, pound 
ﬂ at any uneven edges with a hammer and wood 
block, and ﬁ le smooth the sharp edges.
 I used shiny aluminum for the “chrome” tail 
ornament E1, but stainless would also work. I’ve 
found that aluminum doesn’t pound back ﬂ at well, 
so I cut it out with a Dremel and cutting wheel.
 For the base piece (not shown on the templates) 
cut a 14"×7¼" rectangle out of thicker aluminum.

through these holes to hold the pieces in place 
temporarily, then drill through all the remaining 
holes (Figure C). 
 Drill out the pop-rivets using the same 1" bit, 
pull everything apart, and ﬁ le down any burrs.

6. Cut out and mount the door.
Cut templates A1/A2 and C1/C2 apart as indicated, 
tape them in place on the trunk, and trace them 
with a marker. Then use a Dremel tool to cut out the 
door A2 and the hinge joint between C1 and C2.
 Cut a ¼" gap between C1 and C2 for the hinge, 
then clamp on the hinge, mark and drill through its 
mounting holes, and pop-rivet it in place.
 Use a Dremel to widen the gap between door 
A2 and trunk A1 to 1". Bend the trunk lip D1 to ﬁ t 
inside A1, level or angled just slightly downward 
(Figure E). Clamp it in place, then drill and rivet in 
place, backing the rivets with washers. 
7. Mount the base and the latches.
Drill the tabs around the underside of the trunk 
with 1" holes 1" apart. Fit the trunk over the base, 
then mark and drill matching holes in the alu-
minum. Put a bead of silicone glue between the 
panels over the holes, and rivet the base in place. 
Wipe excess silicone with a rag and let dry.
 Place the 2 hasps, one on each side. Mark and 
drill through the mounting holes, then rivet the 
hasps in place using the larger, 6" bit and rivets, 
reinforced with washers.
 Drill a hole for the brass knob on top of the door. 
For decorative tailpiece E1, position it on the door 
and mark and drill 1" holes in both pieces, but 
don’t rivet it on yet.
 Fit the 7" pipe clips around the tubing on either 
side of the bike rack platform. Flip the trunk upside 
down and center the bike rack on the base (Figure F). 
Mark the clip mounting hole positions and drill 4 cor-
responding ¼" holes in the base, plus an extra hole 
centered in back where the rack already has a hole.
8. Paint and ﬁ nish.
Paint the inside of the trunk ﬂ at black. Sand down 
the putty on the exterior, then paint it with primer 
and white paint (to keep cool in the sun). I cut
“College Bike Trunk” emblems out of black tape 
and stuck them to the sides. Finally, pop-rivet the 
tail on, and stick the red reﬂ ector on the back.
 Install your new bike trunk on the rack using the 
¼-20 bolts. To lock the trunk, use padlocks with 
shackles 1½" long, one on each latch. 
 Now you’re done. It’s time to celebrate like a
college student — go to the store, and pick up 
some beer!

The Scenario: Despite the heavy construction they’ve been doing along this stretch of 
freeway, you’re making really good time on your nightly commute home from work when — 100 
yards ahead of you — all hell breaks loose as a multi-vehicle accident unfurls. By the time you hit 
the brakes and manage a safe stop, you see a jackknifed tanker truck and a battered SUV with its 
front wheels hung up over the temporary cement divider, telling you, at the very least, you’re not 
moving anytime soon.
 Along with others, you jump out to investigate. Everyone’s more or less OK except the driver of the 
SUV, who is unconscious and remains strapped in his seatbelt with his head against the driver’s-side 
window because that side of the car is tilted toward the ground at about a 30-degree angle. 
 What’s more, you clearly see gasoline dripping from both the SUV and the tanker truck, and the 
SUV’s doors are wedged shut by the damage to the car, showing gaps between the doors and the 
surrounding frame where they’ve twisted away from each other. Any spark could turn this scene 
into an explosive inferno and burn that driver alive, which is why almost all the onlookers are 
backing away fast and calling for help on their cells.
The Challenge: Due to the construction, there’s no shoulder, and now that the entire freeway 
is jammed with cars, you realize it would take emergency crews tens of minutes, if not consider-
ably longer, to reach the scene. Do you just clear out like the others and hope the SUV driver 
survives until then? Or do you figure out some way to get him out of the car while you can? 
(The theme of this issue is gadgets, remember?)
What You’ve Got: A well-equipped roadside emergency pack with tools to do basic auto 
repair, including all the standard tools to change a flat; a very good first-aid kit with a heavy-duty
emergency blanket; a flashlight and extra batteries; 100 feet of strong nylon rope; and — of
course — your Swiss Army knife or Leatherman tool. In addition there’s whatever would typically 
be found at a freeway construction area: rebar, steel plate, chain, concrete rubble, shovels,
sledgehammers, pry bars, assorted framing lumber, etc.
 The clock is ticking, the gas is dripping, and the only other people who haven’t left yet are both 
looking at you like you’re wearing a T-shirt that says … got plan?

I’ve dropped a lot of quarters, over the years, 
into machines that offer the peculiar pleasure
of hitting moles on their heads with a padded
mallet. I’m referring, of course, to the Whac-A-Mole 
amusement-arcade game in which five oversized, 
grinning moles pop up at random, inviting you to 
whack them back into their holes. It’s such a peren-
nial favorite that it even has a Wikipedia entry.
 I decided to build “Zap-a-Mole,” using illuminated 
push buttons instead of moles. In this column I’ll
describe an Old School Version powered by logic 
chips. In my next column I’ll show a More Modern 
Version in which a single microcontroller replaces
almost all the chips — and adds more game features.
 If you try these projects, you’ll learn how chips 
can talk to each other and how microcontrollers can 
emulate their function quickly, simply, and cheaply.
The Logical Approach
Logic chips started out inside computers but ended 
up everywhere from car alarms to pinball machines. 
In this project I’ll show you not just how to build a 
game with logic chips, but how to design it.
 My first step in designing a circuit is to write down 
what it has to do. For Zap-a-Mole, it looks like this:
1. Power the game for a fixed time.
2. Light an LED at random (representing a mole
to be zapped).
3. Wait for the player to press the right button
(to zap it).
4. Add 1 to the score.
5. Repeat.
 A plain old 555 timer can run the game for a fixed 
time. I’ll call this the Game Timer. Its high output 
can power a counter chip, which I’ll call the Flash 
Counter. It flashes 5 LEDs in sequence, thousands 
of times per second, and then stops arbitrarily. 
This is the usual ploy to achieve a “random” result. 
I’ll need another 555 timer, which I’ll call the Burst 
Zap-a-Mole
The first of a series of columns for readers who have relatively little 
knowledge of electronics and would like to know more.

Timer, to start the Flash Timer and then stop it.
Take a look at the block diagram in Figure A to get
a better sense of this.
 How will the system know if the player presses the 
right button? Suppose I hook a push button to the 
input of each LED. This way, if the LED is powered, 
the button is also powered, but if any other button is 
pressed, it has no output. Therefore, if button #1 or 
#2 or #3 or any of the other buttons emits positive 
voltage, the player has scored a hit. 
 Those “or” words suggest that I can link all the 
push button outputs together through an OR logic 
gate. This is a key concept. The OR gate’s output is 
normally low, unless one or more of its inputs goes 
high, in which case its output goes high. I’ll use this 
to retrigger the Burst Timer, which restarts the 
Flash Timer to select another LED at random, so 
that the game cycle will repeat. 
 Unfortunately a 555 timer is triggered by a low 
pulse, not a high pulse. What to do? Well, instead
of an OR gate, I can use a NOR gate. Its output is 
usually high unless at least one of its inputs goes 
high, in which case its output goes low. To learn 
more about logic chips, check the Online Resources 
section of this article, or read my book Make:
Electronics (makershed.com).
 My game will need a Score Counter that advances 
whenever the player presses the correct button. 
The trouble is, when you press a button, its contacts 
vibrate or “bounce” for an instant, and a counter chip 
is so sensitive, it will count multiple button-presses 
instead of just one. I need to “debounce” the signal.
 This is another thing that a 555 timer can do. It 
reacts to the first impulse from a button and 
ignores the subsequent bounces, so long as it’s 
completing its high-output cycle. So, the Burst Timer 
will debounce the buttons automatically, and I can 
tap into its high output to trigger the Score Counter. 
Check Figure A again to trace out the logic of this.

Game Timer activates 
other chips to set the

Flash Timer receives a 
reset signal from the 
Burst Timer, and starts 
sending rapid pulses to 
the Flash Counter.
Flash Counter counts 
pulses from the Flash 
Timer. It stops when 
the pulses stop.
Player presses a 
button. If it matches 
the lit LED, a high signal 
goes to the NOR gate.
NOR gate has a 
normally high output, 
but high input(s) will 
drive its output low.
Burst Timer receives
a low signal from the 
NOR gate. This flips its 
output from low to 
high. The length of this 
pulse is randomized by 
a photoresistor. The 
pulse runs the Flash 
Timer briefly, and 
advances the score.

 I’ll use a 4026 CMOS chip for the Score Counter, 
because it can power 7-segment numeric displays 
directly. For compatibility, all the other chips should 
be CMOS, too. They’re somewhat archaic now, but 
that’s what you get, here in the Old School Version 
of Zap-a-Mole. And since old CMOS chips are toler-
ant of a wide voltage range, I can power the Flash 
Counter directly from the Game Timer, and run 
everything with a 9-volt battery.
 And to make the Burst Counter run for a truly 
random time interval, I can adjust its duration with a 
photoresistor that changes its resistance slightly in 
ambient lighting. 
Putting It Together
The schematics in Figures B and C (on the following 
pages) are laid out like a breadboard version of the 
circuit, shown in Figure D. It’s simpler than it looks.
I like to cut every little piece of wire to the exact length, 
but if you’re less obsessive than I am and use pre-cut 
wire, you can finish the job in less than 2 hours. 
 Start by wiring the scoring section (Figure C). 
Connect the pin labeled 1a on the counter to 1a on 
Fig. A: This block diagram shows how the components 
interact.

the display; pin 1b on the counter to 1b on the dis-
play; and so on. I omitted the actual wires for clarity. 
 I’m specifying high-value 1.5K resistors to protect 
the LED numerals because I’m driving the display 
directly from the 4026 chip, which can only deliver 
about 3mA per pin. If you check the current passing 
through one segment of the display by inserting 
your multimeter, and you see more than 3mA, 
increase the value of your resistors.
 After wiring the display and the score counters, 
apply power and touch a positive wire to pin 1 of the 
upper counter. The numbers should advance. If they 
flicker and “overcount,” this is normal, because the 
wire contact is creating its own “switch bounce.” 
 Now build the rest of the circuit. I put the game 
LEDs and tactile switches on a separate mini-
breadboard, to make them easily transferable into an 
enclosure. For this game, I think push buttons that 
have their own LEDs inside them are ideal, so that 
you can whack the thing that lights up. Still, they cost 
about $5 each. Tactile switches are much cheaper.
 What if it doesn’t work? The most common error 
is allowing an input of a CMOS chip to “float” in an 
undefined state. Note the 10K “pull-down” resistors 
shown in the circuit on every pin connected with 
a button. The pull-down resistor holds the pin at a

low voltage until the button overwhelms the resistor 
with positive voltage. The only pins you can leave 
unconnected are labeled “NC” (meaning “no con-
nection”) in the schematic. 
 When you power up the game, if the score counter 
doesn’t show 00, press the Score Reset button. 
Then press the Game Start button. The Game Over 
LED goes out (if you wired it the right way), and you 
can start playing.
 All the LEDs come on simultaneously as the Flash 
Counter cycles them, and then one stays lit until 
you hit the button identified with it. After about a 
minute, the Game Over light comes on and your 
score freezes. Another game? Press the Score Reset 
and the Game Start button again. Happy zapping!
Lessons to Learn
Figure E (previous page) shows the pulses emit-
ted by chips and switches in the schematic. This 
provides a clearer idea of what’s actually happening. 
If you design a circuit of your own, drawing this kind 
of diagram will help you get the chips to talk to each 
other. Figure F shows pinouts for the chips; compare 
their functions with the way they’re wired in Figure B.
 The Flash Counter is a decade counter with de-
coded outputs, meaning that the counter responds 
to each positive input pulse by moving a positive 
voltage from one output pin to the next. After it 
counts from 0 to 9, the counter goes back to 0. In 
Zap-a-Mole, I have only 5 LEDs, so I connected a 
jumper wire from pin 1 (the “5 output”) to pin 15 
(the “reset”). This forces the chip to go back to 0 
after counting from just 0 to 4.
 We’ve talked about the 555 timer in MAKE before 
(see Volume 10, “The Biggest Little Chip”), but this 
game emphasizes the use of its reset pin. Remem-
ber: the timer’s output goes from low to high when 
the input pin goes from high to low (assuming the 
reset pin is held constantly high). But the output also 
goes from low to high if the reset pin goes from low 
to high (assuming the input pin is held constantly 
low). Check Online Resources for more information.
Going Further
Instead of a battery, try using a 12-volt AC adapter 
(which has a DC output), and passing it through a 
9-volt voltage regulator such as the LM7809. 
 A problem with this game is that it waits for you 
to press a button, no matter how long you take. In 
the real Whac-A-Mole, if you don’t whack the mole 
promptly, it drops back down and you miss your 
chance. Can you figure out how to add this feature 
using logic chips? A microcontroller would handle 
it much more easily. I’ll show you how in the More 
Modern Version, in the next issue. 
 I have mixed feelings about microcontrollers. 
They’re powerful and versatile, but you lose the aes-
thetics of pure hardware. When you open the back of 
your Zap-a-Mole cabinet and look at those vintage 
CMOS chips trading voltage pulses, I think they 
inspire a fascination that software can never equal.

 To give it the look of the front of an amp, make a 
framed tray with quarter-round molding on a piece 
of plywood. For the look of Tolex amp covering, 
use contact cement and a staple gun to cover the 
frame with textured vinyl upholstery material. 
 For the bulletin board, cut some high-density 
fiberboard to make a thin backer board to fit 
inside the frame. Use more staples and contact 
cement to wrap the speaker cloth around the 
cork and board. Print out a label for a control 
panel (I lifted some Fender amplifier script art). 
 Here’s the trick part — the “knobs” are really
pushpins! Use RTV rubber to make a mold 
around a real knob, then cast acrylic to make 
perfect copies. Suspend a pushpin in the 
uncured resin. Unmold the cured knob, spray 
with black paint, then wipe with white paint to 
fill in the markings. Drill some small storage 
holes for the knob/pins in the control panel.
 Top it off with a red LED stuck directly on a 
button battery. Build it into a cap from a tube of 
lip balm to create a glowing bezel.
 If you really want to take the concept to “11,” 
add working speakers. The miniature dynamic 
speakers scavenged from a talking greeting 
card would fit into this thin design. Cut a circular 
hole in the cork and insert the wired-up speaker 
before adding the speaker cloth. Connect it to a 
mini plug, then hook up to an iPod. Rock on!

Make your mark, power up on the go, launch paper rockets, 
break from proprietary software, and leave the gloves on. 
In 2005, I came out with a book from a great small 
publisher with zero marketing budget. Naturally, my 
thoughts turned to guerrilla marketing, and I recalled 
a photo I’d seen years before in Popular Science: 
a penny with the word “Microstamp” imprinted into 
it. As it happened, a new nickel was coming out, 
and it had plenty of blank space right in front of 
Jefferson’s eyes. I figured I could stamp a bunch 
of nickels there with my book’s title, and then the 
coins would circulate and work as mini billboards. 
Everyone likes examining new coin designs, right? 
 I found Microstamp online and learned that the 
stamp I wanted was their custom “Maker’s Mark,” 
a hard steel straight stamp that you hammer into 
metal (or plastic) like a center punch. The product 
is aimed at jewelers, crafters, and anyone else who 
wants to put their logo discreetly and indelibly onto 
flat metal (it’s also good for marking metal cases to 
indicate ownership, in case of theft). 
Want more? Check out our searchable online database of tips and tools at makezine.com/tnt. 
Have a tool worth keeping in your toolbox? Let us know at toolbox@makezine.com.
 Prices for the Maker’s Mark start at $85 but 
complicated images cost more, and you need to 
send them an image to get a quote.
 I received my stamp in the mail two weeks later, 
and when I tried it on a nickel, it worked beautifully! 
It’s fun giving it a tap with a hammer and seeing the 
little image appear underneath. The image size was 
too small, but that was all my fault — my enthusiasm 
at the neato-ness of making the letters as tiny as 
possible clouded a sober analysis of what would 
actually provoke attention and be legible on a coin.
 I went to the bank and got rolls of new nickels, 
then stamped them and started using them as 
bus fare. I’ve never heard of anyone noticing one of 
these coins, and I don’t know if any copies of The VJ 
Book (Feral House) ever sold as a result. But if you 
look closely — extremely closely — at the change in 
your pocket, you just might find that you have one 
of them right now!                                     —Paul Spinrad

Kumiki Wooden Puzzles
$33 nadascientific.com
The complex interlocking wooden puzzles known as kumiki
have been manufactured in the Ashigarashimo District of 
central Japan since the late 19th century, but the traditional 
fastenerless joinery techniques from which their intricate 
designs are derived are truly ancient.
 Unlike Western-style “burr” puzzles, which tend to have 
simple abstract shapes, kumiki are usually representative, 
with some of the earliest examples taking the form of classic 
Japanese shrines and temples. 
 Today, however, kumiki come in all shapes and sizes, and 
are commonly made to resemble animals, food items, or 
vehicles. This space shuttle kumiki by Tokyo’s Ogawa Seiki 
Company is a beautiful modern example. It has 34 pieces 
meticulously crafted from four different woods, weighs nearly 
a pound, and is the size of a man’s hand. It comes almost 
completely assembled, which was slightly disappointing to 
me until I realized that taking it apart was as much a puzzle — 
and a pleasure — as putting it back together again.

Case Pocketknives
$35 and up wrcase.com
Despite the array of gee-whiz 
Leathermans and Swiss Army knives 
I own, there’s one tool I carry with 
me all day every day: my W.R. Case 
and Sons Peanut pocketknife. These 
knives have been around since 1889, 
and are still handcrafted in Bradford, 
Pa. The ingredients list is refreshingly 
familiar — surgical steel blades, brass 
bolsters, and bone or wood handles — 
and the knives have a satisfying heft 
and always-sharp blades. 
 
Case makes dozens of styles, from 
tiny to titanic, and whether you’re a 
desk jockey or Alaskan bear hunter, 
there’s one perfect for you. With mine, 
I sharpen pencils, slice salami, cut zip 
ties, and open boxes. 
 
And if I ever happen to encounter 
my great-grandfather, we could each 
get out our Case pocketknives and 
compare them.
 
With thousands of different kinds 
produced over the past 120 years, 
it’s no surprise there’s an avid 
community of Case collectors. 
Yes, these knives are 
beautiful pieces of 
American workman-
ship, but first and 
foremost they’re damn 
fine tools.

LensBaby Muse
$100–$150 lensbaby.com
The Muse is a selective focus attachment lens for a DSLR 
camera. It’s got a flexible, bellows-like neck that lets you 
change the focal plane manually. If you want to take a normal 
shot, the Muse pops back to “regular” mode automatically.
 Even better, the Muse lets you swap in any LensBaby optics 
(sold separately) without taking the whole lens out. They offer 
a plastic-lensed model that simulates the effect of a toy cam-
era, as well as pinhole, fisheye, and soft-focus attachments. 
 The soft-focus is my favorite. It’s customizable, with a passel 
of hole-punched, stackable aperture disks that give you control 
over the character of the softness. LensBaby makes getting 
funky and experimental with your DSLR easy.      —John Baichtal

Stirred, Not Shaken
$425–$449 lisa.makersmarket.com
Why, you may rightly ask, do I need perfect, 
glassy, 3-inch spheres of ice? Taisin, the 
Japanese company that first marketed these 
molds, would have you believe a spherical
ice cube is the only truly acceptable way to 
chill fine whiskey. Because it has the lowest 
possible surface-area-to-volume ratio, spher-
ical ice melts more slowly than ice of some 
other, lesser shape, and thus will minimize 
watering down of your fine sippable during 
the time it takes you to drink it.
 
However, the honest answer is: you don’t. 
But I got a chance to play with one recently 
at Maker Faire, and it was absolutely delight-
ful to watch the heavy, turned-aluminum 
molds slowly cut a rough chunk of ice into 
a perfect sphere over the course of about 
two minutes. People came from all over the 
fairground to stop and watch. What’s more, 
this version, manufactured by indie Makers 
Market seller Lisa Lane of Carson City, Nev., 
will only set you back about one-quarter of 
the price of the fancy Japanese version.

The Age of Makers
The Age of Wonder by Richard Holmes
$40 Pantheon Books
Dear Makers: Please read this book. It’s a wonderful history of the
period of discovery and invention at the end of the 18th century that led 
to huge leaps forward in astronomy, chemistry, philosophy, and poetry 
(yup, I said poetry). 
 Holmes wrestles this weighty subject into a highly readable form by 
telling linked stories of the men and women who passionately grappled 
with the problems of their day. Joseph Banks, William and Caroline 
Herschel, and Humphry Davy rub elbows with Captain Cook and Percy 
Bysshe Shelley, Babbage and Darwin, Scottish explorers and Italian 
aeronauts. In this day and age of incredibly specialized knowledge, 
it’s hard not to be a touch jealous at the thought that everything then 
seemed knowable, soon, if only you applied yourself.
 Above all, Holmes shows how accessible the sciences were at the 
time; there were few graduate programs or peer-reviewed journals, so 
dabblers and tinkerers could end up creating cutting-edge microscopes, 
overhauling chemistry, or even running the Royal Society. 
 It was a time when scientists and poets saw their work as linked, when 
words and equations were just different ways of looking at the same 
problem (and in fact when the word scientist was invented!). This is a 
perfect book for any maker, or for a loved one who doesn’t quite under-
stand the drive to create something from nothing; after reading this, 
they will.                                                                                                                   —AOG
Emotional Machinery
Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology by Valentino Braitenberg
$22 MIT Press
It’s interesting that some of the most seminal work in bottom-up bots 
(those with little or no brains) was done by neurologists. Grey Walter 
(profiled on page 68 of Volume 19) was one, Valentino Braitenberg 
is another.
 In this intriguing little 1986 volume, Braitenberg undertakes a series 
of thought-experiments in behavior and social interaction using simple 
conceptual machines (dubbed “Braitenberg Vehicles”). Each vehicle is 
built upon the design/logic of the previous one. 
 While the machines are imaginary and are designed to get us to think 
about our behavioral perceptions (e.g., a robot that charges a light 
source appears to us to be aggressive, one that “hides” under the couch 
seems cowardly), their basic, sense-act architecture and the thinking
about machine behavior they inspired were big influences on the 
burgeoning behavior-based robotics “school” of the 1980s and 90s. 
Like Marvin Minsky’s The Society of Mind and Douglas Hofstadter’s 
Gödel, Escher, Bach, this is a book that rewards frequent reading and 
casual exploration.

Induction Introduction
Practical Electronics for Inventors, 2nd Edition by Paul Scherz
$40 McGraw-Hill
When I began my career 20 years ago, it was possible to be a successful
mechanical engineer without really knowing how to push electrons. 
However, as time passed, I began to suspect that my understanding of 
engineering had a big, gaping hole in it as I ran into issues like ground 
loops and impedance mismatches in my data acquisition setups. 
 And after I discovered microcontrollers like the BASIC Stamp and the 
Arduino, it was quite clear that my very limited knowledge of electronics 
was a huge roadblock in my pursuit of fun!
 Practical Electronics for Inventors bridges the gap between theory 
and practice. If you want to know how and why an inductor works, the 
background material is in Chapter 2 (the well-written, 260-page chapter 
on theory). Or you can jump to the detailed inductor selection guide 
in Chapter 3, or just skip to the chapter on filters to figure out how to 
design the low-pass filter, which is the reason why you started wondering 
about inductors in the first place.
 This book deserves a place on the table right between the soldering 
iron and the DIY power supply!                                                   —Daniel Sullivan
Watching Birders
The Ardent Birder by Todd Newberry and Gene Holtan
$15 Ten Speed Press
This charming little book talks about the craft of birding (or birdwatch-
ing), rather than bird identification techniques. In 50 short essays, 
author Todd Newberry shares wisdom gained from hours in the field, but 
this isn’t a dry how-to; it’s a manual that reads like a love letter to the 
practice of watching birds. Lively sketches and cartoons by Gene Holtan 
bring the book to life.
 Tips include how to get “on a bird” quickly; that is, how to go from
seeing a speck or movement in the trees to actually focusing on the bird 
with your binoculars. It’s not as easy as you might think! There are also 
nice recommendations about meeting other birders in the field, taking 
notes on rarities, and various other techniques that can take your birding 
to the next level very quickly. 
 If you’re a beginning birder, you’ll appreciate this as your handbook to 
the culture of birding as you sort out terms like BVD, listers, and lifers. 
Advanced birders will also benefit from Newberry’s mentorship, includ-
ing how to be a good birding mentor, and 15 steps that every trip leader 
should take to heart. And if you find yourself in a disagreement over what 
bird your group has actually seen, you’ll appreciate the essay, “On Being 
Doubted.” An overlooked gem on the topic of how to go birding!

Ubuntu Karmic Koala
(v. 9.10) 
Free ubuntu.com
My switch to Ubuntu came from
a desire to break away from propri-
etary software. I started with Jaunty 
Jackalope (version 9.04) and was a bit 
afraid to make the jump to the new 
OS, Karmic Koala (version 9.10), due 
to some hardware issues. Fortunately, 
my fears were needless. But while on 
the technical side everything is quite 
fast, Ubuntu still suffers from a plain, 
default GUI. Ubuntu’s primary goal over 
the next few releases is to create their 
own version of an App Store, which 
should be completed by 10.04. 
 
In Koala, Ubuntu users see the first 
step toward a fully functional app 
store: Ubuntu One is a free, 2GB online 
cloud storage service that allows 
Ubuntu users to sync and share files 
with other online users. The current, 
upgraded repository is nice to look 
at, clean when searching, and easy to 
install. With Lucid Lynx (version 10.04) 
just released in April, Koala is a great 
OS to utilize until Lynx establishes its 
base in the community.

The RC200 does everything you’d expect from a multimeter: 
measures voltage, resistance, capacitance, and continuity,
checks diodes, and switches between manual and auto 
ranging using a stripped-down interface, basically just an LCD 
with a couple of buttons letting you toggle through the modes. 
The RC200 measures voltages up to 600V, 6nF to 60mF 
capacitance, and resistance ranging from 600Ω to 60MΩ. 
It does not measure inductance.
 While the RC200’s ratings aren’t likely to blow anyone way, 
it has one outstanding feature: its tweezers. These allow you 
to test components — including tiny surface-mount hardware 
— loose or directly on the PCB, making the RC200 invalu-
able for tinkerers, circuit benders, and hardware hackers. A 
convenient adjustment wheel opens and closes the tweezers 
to accommodate different-sized components, or you can just 
squeeze them as you would any pair of tweezers.
 If you don’t need the tweezers, you can always swap them 
out for a module packing the usual test lead ports, making for 
a very compact standard multimeter — about 7"×1½" in size, 
and weighing a meager 2.3oz.                                                        —JB

LilyPad Bobbin kit, or a 
larger supply if you like. 
Now sew through the tip of 
the index finger, leaving lots 
of messy loops on the inside 
to ensure contact with your 
finger. You want the thread 
on the outside to be a nice 
little nib. 
You’re ready to touch that

Dremel EZ Lock System
$20 dremel.com
The Dremel EZ Lock system is a significant advance in small-tool 
cutting technology. While the heart of the system is a quick-release 
arbor (eliminating the tiny mandrel screw), its greatest improve-
ment is the new series of cutoff wheels, brushes, buffs, sanding 
disks, and specialty wheels that go with it.
 The new, metal-reinforced cutoff wheels have twice the life of 
fiberglass versions, are much less prone to breakage, and are avail-
able in thin-kerf versions, as well as specific wheels for cutting
plastic, wood, laminates, and tile. And a new line of abrasive detail 
brushes removes rust, paint, or tarnish from a variety of materials.
  My favorites are the wheels designed for cutting plastic, which 
are great for case modding; and I’ve used the diamond wheels
to cleanly cut borosilicate glass (with appropriate hand and face 
protection). I’ve used these EZ Lock cutters for weeks and am still 
very much impressed by them.                         —Christopher Singleton

Rope and pulley systems, such as the block and 
tackle, have been useful since earliest times. They 
were among the “simple machines” described by 
Archimedes, and are among the first mechanical 
systems studied in introductory physics courses. 
 High school physics students in my day knew the 
block and tackle system seen in Figure A, and knew 
that its ideal mechanical advantage is equal to the 
number of rope segments supporting the load (in 
this case 6) which is also equal to the ratio of the 
distance the applied force moves compared to the 
distance the load moves. This assumes a perfectly 
efficient machine with no mechanical energy losses 
— the rope doesn’t stretch, there’s no friction, and 
the weight of any moving pulleys is negligible. This 
idealized mechanical advantage is defined by the 
force ratio (load weight / applied input force).
 The efficiency of the ideal system (work out / 
work in) would equal 1, or 100%. But real pulley 
systems come nowhere near this ideal; their work 
efficiencies can range from less than 50% to more 
than 90%, but 80% is typical.
 There’s a problem with this sort of “crammed 
knowledge.” If the student is confronted with a 
pulley system that is not a block and tackle, the 
“number of ropes suspending the load” rule is out 
the window.
 In physics-ed circles, many of us know of the 
“fool’s tackle” deception, shown in Figures B and 
C. There isn’t much about it on the internet, and it 
seldom appears in textbooks, so I assume it’s not 
generally known. It looks good on paper, and the 
naive student will conclude that its mechanical 
advantage is 2.
 Here’s the trouble: you can’t construct it. Any hon-
est attempt to build it causes its collapse. Of course, 
you can use deception to make constructions that 
appear to be fool’s tackles, and can even make ones 
that seem to work. You can also draw an inverted

version of it that doesn’t work either, as in Figure D. 
 Combining an impossible device with other
mechanical devices, either workable or unworkable
ones, is not productive either. There’s a lesson in 
that: a plausible-looking drawing can often deceive.
I see a lot of that in email stimulated by my “Unwork-
able Devices” web pages. I also see it in the patent 
literature.
 This device goes a long way back. Sailors, in
the days when ships had sails, were expected to 
understand ropes, knots, and pulleys, and be able
to construct and use pulley systems. Newbie sailors 
were given some rope and pulleys and assigned 
tasks to test their skills. Sometimes this included 
the task of building and using one of these fool’s 
tackles, partly as a joke, partly to see how savvy 
they were about machines. 
 We physics profs would do the same with students 
in elementary physics courses, and most students 
fell for it, some even spending half an hour trying to 
build the system before asking for help. I’d usu-
ally respond to these plaintive requests by saying, 
“Didn’t we tell you to do a pencil and paper analysis 
of the system’s performance before building it?” 
There were even some who reported fake data and

analysis, hoping it wouldn’t be noticed.
 Some things that you can describe in words are 
simply not possible in nature. For example, a four-
sided triangle, or a string with only one end — but 
these are semantic deceptions. Some impossible 
tasks violate the physics of the real world, such as
a walking path that traverses a closed loop to return 
to its starting point, downhill all the way. How about 
constructing an equilateral triangle in a flat plane 
with no two angles equal? Give those tasks to some-
one who asserts that “anything is possible.”
 So how should one analyze a rope and pulley
system? In the idealized (and static) case, the 
tension in the entire length of a rope of negligible 
weight is nearly constant throughout its length. Call 
that tension T. So the segments of a rope passing 
over a pulley sheave have the same tension.
 In the diagram of the fool’s tackle, Figure E, we 
see that this tension exerts forces on the pulleys as 
shown. But the pulley at the right experiences twice 
PITY THE FOOL: Fig. A: (Opposite page) A typical block and tackle. Fig. B: The fool’s tackle. A pulley system 
can’t physically exist in this configuration; it collapses immediately. This one is stopped by a wedge of foam 
plastic between the top pulley and its frame. (Call it a “blocked tackle”?) Fig. C: The classic fool’s tackle.

the tension acting downward as is acting upward, so 
that pulley cannot be in equilibrium. That pulley will 
fall due to the unbalanced forces. The system has an 
internal contradiction. It’s even worse in reality due 
to the weight of the right-hand pulley. The system 
will collapse if you try to build it.
 Now try your skills on the pulley system in Figure 
F, called the “Spanish burton.” It’s shown in Leonardo 
da Vinci’s notebooks. What’s the number of rope 
segments supporting the load? That’s hard to count, 
because only two forces from one rope act directly 
on the load. The “count the ropes” rule is useless for 
anything other than block and tackle systems. 
 But the analysis of this system (or any pulley 
system) is easy. First assume the system is in 
equilibrium. Start at the right, calling the tension 
in the right rope F. This rope passes over the pulley 
second from the right, exerting an upward force 2F 
on that pulley. So, to maintain equilibrium, the rope 
acting downward on that pulley must have tension

2F. At the next pulley the downward force is 4F, and 
at the next it is 8F, and by the time we get to the last 
pulley, the downward force must be 32F = L. So the 
mechanical advantage is 32, and there are nowhere 
near that many ropes or even rope segments in the 
system. (There are 5 ropes and 10 segments.)
 One thing seldom addressed in textbooks is how 
to do estimates (back-of-envelope calculations) 
comparing efficiency of different systems. Suppose 
that each pulley, moving or not, has a force due to 
friction, proportional to the weight its axle directly 
supports. Suppose also that each pulley that moves 
up and down has a non-negligible weight. Now what 
could possibly be the superiority of the Spanish 
burton over a block and tackle with the same ideal 
mechanical advantage?
 The block and tackle would require 32 pulleys 
compared to the 6 of the Spanish burton, and the 
block and tackle would have 16 pulleys moving, 
compared to 5 of the Spanish burton (moving at 
different speeds, of course). But the Spanish burton 
has geometric problems, as well as problems with 
rope stretch. Figure E is misleading, because the 
pulley spacing, bottom to top, must be 1, 2, 4, 8, and 
so on, at all times. This system is seldom seen with 
more than 2 or 3 movable pulleys. Da Vinci took 
things to extremes, often drawing pictures of things 
that weren’t practical.
 I’ve raised some questions that you can easily
answer by building such systems and testing their 
performance. Small pulleys can be obtained at 
science supply stores, or from toy construction 
sets. Add some stout, non-stretchy cord and some 
weights or small spring scales, and you can have
a lot of fun learning about simple machines.
 You can also devise puzzles such as “Given N 
pulleys and N ropes, what’s the greatest mechani-
cal advantage you could achieve using all of the 
pulleys? What’s the greatest efficiency you can get 
from them?” No matter how ingenious you are, you 
probably won’t find an unworkable system that 
doesn’t have a fool’s tackle hidden within it. (Some 
mathematician may be able to prove or disprove this 
as a theorem.)
 You can buy “simple machines” educational toy 
kits with the necessary parts. But to get full benefit 
from them, children need to have some guidance 
and be challenged by “What if?” and “How?” ques-
tions that stimulate measurement and quantitative 
analysis.

PULLEY TEASER
Draw as many 2-dimensional pulley
systems as your inventiveness allows. 
Two-dimensional systems are those where the 
pulleys can only move up or down, and all rope 
segments are parallel. Classify them as workable 
or unworkable. Without doing a force analysis, can 
you spot the common geometric feature of the 
unworkable ones? (Failed machine designs are 
always due to an attempt to violate the geometry 
of the universe.)
ANSWER: A movable pulley has 3 rope segments 
acting on it, 2 of them due to a single rope passing 
over the sheave. The 2 segments over the sheave 
exert a net force 2T on the pulley in the same 
direction, so the third rope segment must have 
tension 2T in the opposite direction, to achieve 
force equilibrium. Therefore that third segment 
cannot be part of the same rope passing over the 
sheave, for its tension is only T throughout.
CONCLUSION: An idealized pulley system is 
unworkable if even one movable pulley is acted 
upon by only one rope. 
TIMELESS TEASER
Drill 3 holes in a rectangular piece of wood. Thread 
2 wooden hearts or beads onto a string. Loop and 
tie the cord as shown. The challenge is to get the 
hearts or beads onto the same loop. 
ANSWER: Draw the left heart along the string 
through the loop in the middle until it reaches the 
back of the center hole, pull the loop through the 
hole, and pass the heart through the 2 loops that 
will then be formed. Then draw the string back 
through the hole as before, and the heart may be 
easily passed to its companion.

This method works great for moving trees that a 
vehicle can’t get to. It’s like a giant furniture mover’s 
dolly for trees. Manual methods work OK for small 
trees, and when there’s vehicle access the A-frame

no vehicle access. New methods were needed.
 Or ancient ones. In England in the 1700s, Lancelot

them when they’re asleep. Like vampires. 
 Also, California’s rainy season is coming to an end.

contains some giant steel hooks I made to lift the 
tree’s root ball (Figure C).
First Use!
James in Fremont needed two trees moved. He had 
already trenched around this apricot tree (Figure E).
The root ball is smaller than I’d like. I cut under it 
with a long, skinny, sharpened shovel while the dolly 
supported the weight of the tree. Figures D and G 
show a good root ball. The roots are cut cleanly so 
they can heal well and fight off infections.
Tip for Transport
Pull on the masthead guy rope to lift the tree and
tip the dolly back. It’s amazing how little force it 
takes. Guide the tree and root ball onto a good rest-
ing spot on the dolly as you do this. Add pads and 
blocks under it if necessary. Don’t let the dolly fall 
and clobber anyone. Secure the root ball to the dolly 
with more inner tubes (Figures F and G).

the hook into the ground with a sledgehammer and

irregular ground. When we untied the tree, it swung 
to the right, so we blocked up one end of the 2×4.
Planting
James filled around the tree as I lowered it into the 
hole (Figure I). We leaned the dolly over the hole so 
we could easily rotate the suspended tree.
 Dig a bigger hole than you need. When the tree 
is standing upright in the hole, remove the padding 
from the root ball. Plant the tree no deeper than the 
bulge at the bottom of the trunk. Mulch over the 
roots, water regularly, and if high winds or college 
students are in the area, tie guy ropes to the trunk 
so it doesn’t get knocked over. Happy tree moving!

Drive a Car
By Gever Tulley with Julie Spiegler
Take command of 5,000 pounds of metal.
DANGER!
Driving a car is serious business. Show that you’re 
ready for the experience by paying attention when 
other people are driving.
1. Pick your location.
Find an empty parking lot or open, flat field. Fewer 
obstacles means fewer opportunities for collisions. 
Have the adult drive the car to a spot where there is 
nothing in front of the car for as far as possible and 
turn off the engine.
2. Get behind the wheel.
The adult will have to work the pedals and levers, so 
have them slide their seat back to make a space on 
their lap for you to sit. Make sure that they can still 
safely reach the steering wheel in case they need to 
take control. Review with them which of the controls 
you are and are not allowed to touch.
3. Prepare. 
Have the adult start the car and put it in drive, but 
ask them to keep their foot on the brake. You are 
about to take control; relax and take a deep breath. 
When you are ready, ask the adult to remove their 
foot from the brake and to apply a little gas.
4. Learn to steer.
As the car rolls slowly forward, make small turns 
with the steering wheel so that the car weaves
gently along your route. This will help you get a feel 
for how the car responds to the steering wheel.
5. Drive.
When you are ready, pick a point ahead where there 
is a streetlight, lane marking, or concrete curb, and 
plan to turn right or left around it. Keep planning 
and making turns until you can reliably turn the car 
when you want to, and have it go where you mean 
it to. If there are lane markings, try staying in your 
lane when you make a turn. 
SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
It’s perfectly legal for a child to steer a car as long
as it’s on private property. 
 
Driving on public roads is a privilege that is
granted to a person by the state when they issue 
a license. Unlike your constitutional rights (free 
speech, freedom of religion, etc.), which can never 
be taken away from you, the state can take your 
driver license away if you behave irresponsibly in 
a car.
 
Driving on a road, with other cars, has more
potential for danger than any of the activities in
this magazine.
REQUIRES
Car
Empty parking lot (private)
An adult
Duration: Short 
Difficulty: Moderate
Keep your speed down and stay far away from any 
obstacles. Stop the car immediately if other cars or 
pedestrians enter the parking lot. 
WARNING
!
  Make up little driving goals and then try to do 
them. For example, in a parking lot with regular 
streetlights, you could say, “I’m going to drive in 
between the light poles.”

Prior to Samuel F.B. Morse’s invention of the 
electric telegraph, there was no good way to com-
municate information across distance at any speed 
greater than that of a horsed rider. Sure, there were 
some limited experiments, such as semaphore. Men 
stood on hilltops signaling with flags and noting one 
another’s coded movements through spyglasses. 
This was clumsy and slow. Worse, it was incredibly 
expensive because it required a lot of men on a lot of 
hilltops to relay messages over any distance at all.
 In the 1820s and early 1830s, Morse was well 
known as an accomplished painter. In 1830, he left 
his home in New York for Europe, intending to refine 
his skills even further by studying with the masters 
of Italy, Switzerland, and France.
 It was during this time, however, that painting 
began to lose its hold over the ever-restless Morse. 
Although he was at the peak of his artistic prowess, 
other ideas of how he might spend his life evidently 
encroached upon his thoughts. In 1832, at the age 
of 41, he boarded the packet boat Sully and cruised 
westward, back across the Atlantic. 
 Morse chanced upon a conversation with other 
passengers about the era’s hot science topic — 
electromagnetism — and what he heard fascinated 
him. It became a turning point not only in his life but 
also in the future of communications technology. 
 Morse had boarded the ship an uninspired artist; 
he left it an aspiring inventor. As he disembarked, 
he told the ship’s skipper, “Well, Captain Pell, should 
you ever hear of the ‘telegraph’ one of these days as 
the wonder of the world, remember the discovery 
was made on the good ship Sully.”
 Despite the fact that Morse had little if any knowl-
edge of electricity, he plunged ahead as only a man 
in the throes of a serious midlife career crisis could. 
In his crude laboratory, his homemade batteries 
had little energy, and his elementary attempts at 
electromagnets produced no magnetism. He didn’t 
even understand the role of insulation on wires.
 But Morse did have two important assets: plenty 
of determination, and smart friends. By asking the

right questions of his friend Leonard Gale, a chem-
istry professor at New York University, he was able 
to make headway, building a telegraph capable of 
sending messages a quarter mile. A few years later, 
he asked the right questions of Gale’s friend Joseph 
Henry, perhaps the most important American scien-
tist in the period between Franklin and Edison. 
 Armed with Henry’s answers, Morse was able to 
unlock the secret of long-distance telegraphy: the 
electromagnetic relay, a switch that opens or closes 
a circuit based on input from another circuit. With 
multiple relays, electrical signals could travel any 
distance and arrive at a receiving station with nearly 
as much power as when they were transmitted.
 In 1843, Morse received the then-huge sum of 
$30,000 from the U.S. government to construct the 
first long-distance telegraph line, stretching from 
Washington, D.C., to Baltimore along the tracks 
of the B&O Railroad. The wires were strung from 
poles and trees, insulated from the ground by crude 
insulators made from broken glass bottles. On May 
24, 1844, the first telegraph message, “What hath 
God wrought,” was tapped from the B&O’s Mount 
Clare Station in Baltimore to the Capitol Building 
in Washington. The era of electronic, high-speed 
information transfer had begun.
 You can make a telegraph system to communicate 
with friends, practice Morse code, or simply get a 
better appreciation for Samuel Morse and his world-
changing invention. A system like the one Morse 
demonstrated in 1844 consists of 4 parts: the key, 
the sounder, the battery, and the wire (Figure A).

1×4 lumber, 7" length
Flat-shaped brass cabinet knob with machine screw
For the sounder and telegraph wire:
Magnet wire, 26-gauge, coated (50') roughly ½oz
by weight. You need 45' to make the relay, and
a few extra feet for your telegraph wire.
7" bolt, 2" long
12-gauge mild steel bars: 1"×12" (1) and 1"×3½" (2)
#8 wood screws, ½" long, with washers (4)

Make the Telegraph Key
1. Glue the wood trim into the aluminum angle, with 
the angle’s ¾" leg on the bottom and its ½" leg on 
the side. Let it dry. This is the key’s lever or “tapper.”
2. Drill a vertical hole through the lever (Figure C),
centered ¼" from one end, for the knob screw 
(usually #8, but check your knob’s threads before 
drilling). Then drill a horizontal 6" hole centered
2" from the same end (Figure D).
3. Drill holes on the face of the 1×4 board as shown 
in Figure B. This is the key’s base.
4. Glue the wooden dowel into the 7" hole, so it 
protrudes no more than ¼". Place the spring over 
the dowel. 
5. Attach the mending plate to the base with wood 
screws; this is the “anvil.” Affix the corner braces to 
the base with wood screws (Figure E).
7. Mount the knob so that its screw’s head is on the 
lever’s aluminum bottom.
8. Insert the #8 machine screw through the corner 
braces and the horizontal hole in the lever, securing 
it with a nut and washer (Figure F, following page).

Make the Sounder
1. Drill holes on the metal bars, the 1×4, and the
2×4 as shown in the sounder assembly diagram 
(Figure G). Fasten the boards together with nails or 
deck screws.
2. To make your electromagnet, place the 7" bolt 
in the chuck of the drill so the bolt’s head and 1" of 
thread is exposed.
 Leaving about 12" of wire trailing, wrap 45' of
magnet wire around the threads closest to the bolt 
head. With a helper holding the magnet wire spool 
so it’s free to spin, start the drill and slowly wrap
the wire, using an up-and-down motion so that the 
wire turns are distributed as evenly as possible 
(Figure H). Stop winding when there’s 12" left, and 
tie or tape it off so it doesn’t unravel.
 Now you’ve got an electromagnet with two 12" 
leads (Figure I).
3. Screw the electromagnet into the ¼" hole on the 
1×4 base.
4. Screw the 3½" steel bars onto the 2×4, but don’t 
tighten them completely.
5. Slip the 12" steel bar under the 3½" bars, center-
ing it on the 2×4. Then tighten the short crossbars 
slightly.
Wire the Telegraph
Wire the telegraph key to the 9V battery and the 
sounder as shown in the wiring diagram (Figure J).
This diagram shows how the telegraph key and 
sounder are wired for a single person (practice use).
 Adjust the placement of the 12" steel bar on the 
sounder so it responds quickly and smoothly; it 
should audibly clap to the electromagnet when the 
telegraph key is closed. When it’s well adjusted, 
tighten the crossbars to hold it fast.

Pennywhistle made 
from pennies.
Sometimes it costs more to buy it than to make it from the money itself.

P
ennywhistles aren’t expensive, and a quick 
search online finds plenty of sites showing how 
to make them out of plastic, metal, or wood. They’re 
easy to make, too, but the devil is in the details. 
Adjusting one for good tone requires patience and
a little trial and error. 
 For my pennywhistle, I wanted to fashion a 
universal mouthpiece or “fipple,” so that I could 
experiment with as many different materials and 
proportions as possible. I made a sandwich of 3 
pennies, with the center section of one removed to 
form an air channel or windway. I made tiny rivets 
of copper wire to hold these in place while I fused 
them together with a fourth penny drilled with a 
hole, using non-lead solder. Then I added a piece of 
scrap copper tubing with a sharp-edged hole, and 
a small wooden half-cylinder plug to help direct the 
air from the mouthpiece toward the sharp edge of 
the hole, known as the lip or blade. The whistle’s 
overall tone depends on airflow over the blade.
 I used a piece of bamboo for my tube, but copper 
or plastic pipe works, too. The fundamental note of 
the whistle is largely determined by the length of the 
tube, measured from the blade edge to the far open 
end. You can adjust its pitch by shortening the tube. 
 When you have a pitch you like, measure the 
length from the open end of the tube to the sharp 
edge of the blade, multiply that length by the ratios 
.85, .75, .68, .60, .52, and .45, and drill 6 finger holes 
whose edges are these distances from the blade.
 Now tinker until it works. I may add another piece 
of sharp-edged penny to my copper mouthpiece so 
that it has its own built-in blade, but that’s going to 
raise the overall coin count to nearly 5 cents!

Luis Cruz is a high school senior in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. 
Videos and more details about his project can be found at

■ Video games have been part of my life in
Honduras since I was a kid, but it wasn’t until I was 
14 that my interest in game programming began. 
 At first I developed software primarily to learn pro-
gramming, in a variety of languages. Later I decided 
to apply my programming knowledge to the digital-
electronics world, using integrated circuits such as 
Atmel microcontrollers to develop my own projects. 
Online, I bought everything I needed to start learn-
ing electronics and microcontroller programming 
from NerdKits, a company founded by MIT students.
 In October 2009, just one year after I started 
studying electronics, I decided to build my own video 
game system, applying everything I’d learned about 
microcontrollers and game programming to a single 
system. In spite of a lack of resources for develop-
ers in Honduras, and with limited free time as a high 
school student and even more limited capital, I set 
out to accomplish my goal.
 By generating the correct waveforms with two 
Atmel AVR microcontrollers, I sent data for both 
monaural sound and monochromatic composite 
video to an NTSC analog television. Everything was 
done in the code, with the help of only a handful of 
resistors and capacitors. 
 Although sending information to a TV wasn’t an 
easy task, I decided to take on another challenge. 
One day, while using my TV’s remote control, I had 
the idea to develop my own remote control to send 
information wirelessly with infrared light. 
 My idea was to use a third AVR processor to cre-
ate a motion controller for my console. This chip 
reads the output from a dual-axis accelerometer, 
whose signal changes proportionally to the game 
controller’s movement, and then the chip drives an 
infrared LED on and off using pulse-width modula-
tion, according to the controller’s movement or 
button presses. Yet another microcontroller in the 
console decodes this infrared information remotely.
 My project was featured in local newspapers and 
TV programs as the “first video game system devel-
oped in Honduras,” and was selected in February as 
the best NerdKits project of the month. 
 I named my console Embedded Entertainment 
System, or EES. I hope my success with the EES 
will encourage other developers to build their 
own projects without fear of failing. With enough 
effort and perseverance, almost any goal can be 
accomplished.

What is the

Electronics instructor Ollie Circuits planned to show his class of freshman electrical 
engineering students how to use a super capacitor as a memory back-up capacitor,
but first he wanted to show how the students could make their own super capacitor 
and demonstrate its charge/discharge cycles with the simple circuit above. Most of 
the components were already on his workbench, the homemade super capacitor 
would be made from several layers of lemon juice-soaked paper towels interleaved
between several layers of a mystery material to form a multi-layer stack.The stacked 
layers would then be sandwiched between the two copper-clad PC boards and held
together with a rubber band. Ollie rushed to a nearby pet shop. What did he buy?
