This month in our special m
games issue the editor asks qg
fair play It
to
PLAYING GAMES HAS HAD RATHER A
bad press. "Stop playing games with me,''
we are told and recognise at once the
ac c us ation o f  dev ious nes s  a n d
dishonesty. People who play games either
meet deservedly sticky ends o r  they
become the scheming heads of multi-
national o il companies, lik e jR. And
someone shot him.
Take the play, Sleuth, for example.
Now I can't remember the plot exactly,
but I  c an recall that there are tw o
characters (or was it three?) who keep
playing games with each other. First, one
has murdered the other one's wife (or was
it his mother?) who in turn (him, not his
wife) dresses up as a policeman (or was he
one all along?), then someone is shot (or
was it stabbed?) but it's only pretend (I
think!). All in all there's a lot of confusion
and not just on stage.
So, playing games is either sinister or
it's something which we are supposed to
grow out of along with short trousers and
spots. Sport is different, of course. It's
O.K. for a grown man to spend an hour
and a half on a Saturday afternoon knee
deep in mud chasing after a funny shaped
ball while trying to avoid ﬁfteen even
more f u lly  gr own m e n  intent o n
separating his head from his body. Games
are for those of us who haven't grown up!
Well, what about darts or snooker?
Surely, they're games? Afraid not. The
deﬁnition of a sport is an activity practised
by men who are too big to argue with
(darts and anything done by Geoff Capes)
or if it's on the telly (snooker, darts and
Geoff Capes). I will admit that dominoes
and shove-ha'penny ar e t w o  games
played by  grown men. However, they
usually take place in the back rooms of
pubs s o  ﬁlled w it h smoke that it's
impossible to tell what's going on.
Unfortunately, some of these attitudes
have rubbed off onto computer games.
How often have you heard, "I'm a serious
programmer. I don't play games." Or "I
didn't buy you a computer just so you
could play games." It seems that if you're
'serious' about computing, then y ou
don't play games; if  you bought your
computer for some fun then you feel
guilty about playing them and if you are
under a  certain age then you're not
allowed to play them.
Well, I like playing computer games
and I refuse to feel guilty about it. The
good ones don't bypass the brain and
even the bad ones are no more mindless
than a weekly mud bath which leaves you
with lungs like those of the ﬁre-eater who
sucked rather than blew. No one who has
been following our Sense of Adventure
series could possibly argue that computer
games are not intellectually stimulating.
The good adventure combines all the
imaginative power of a novel with tests of
reasoning and logic to stretch even the
mathematical genius.
recently researched an article on
computers in schools and was surprised at
the number of teachers who told me, "Of
course, we don't allow anyone to play
games." It may be preferable to get the
class to run the 200 metres or do the high
jump rather than waggle the joystick back
and forth to make Daley Thompson do it
(though I have my doubts). But there are a
lot of games which require brainpower as
well as manual dexterity. Take Impossible
Mission (and if you win our competition
this month you'll be able to do just that).
Here is a game which is immediately
attractive w it h brilliant graphics and
speech but of such complexity that it will
take a long time for you to crack it. Like all
such games it teaches one of the most
important truths about education, that
practice is the path to improvement.
Programming is, of course, important
and Your Commodore is doing its best to
encourage it .  Games ar e t h e  bes t
examples of good programming which
are easily accessible to all of us. It seems to
me, therefore, that if good programming
is to be encouraged then the best way of
doing it, is to show people exactly what
can b e  achieved o n  t h e  computer.
Software houses s hould d o  this  b y
producing the best possible games for the
machine, ones  whic h us e all o f  its
capabilities to the full. We are doing it by
letting you know which games are the
best and b y  printing some excellent
examples ourselves. Cherry Picker in this
issue is a long listing but for those of you
with the patience and perseverence, this
is a game worthy of any software house.
You will also learn a lot about good
programming just from typing it in.
Finally, games are entertainment. They
are meant to be enjoyed. I hope that all
you read in this issue will entertain you
and perhaps even encourage you to start
producing y our  ow n games t o  giv e
pleasure to others. If you become good
enough you'll be interested to read the 3
article on getting your games marketed by
a software company. Or you could send
them to Your Commodore and share your
talent with all our readers.

Gemini fall under the business spotlight this
month.

leff 'The Yak' Minter is one of
the best known personalities in
games programming. Kevin
Cox went to meet the hairy
one.
EVERYTHING ABOUT JEFF MINTER IS
hairy. His hair is hairy, his beard is hairy
and his games are about hairy animals. His
dog, an Afghan, was so hairy it quite
startled m e  —  I  thought is  was an
undersized, overhaired llama —  and I
shan't mention the old adage about dogs
starting to look lik e their owners. His
kitten was not that hairy but obviously
aspired t o  t h e  c ondition. I  c a n ' t
remember now, but I'm sure that even the
carpet was a thick shag-pile.
So, it was with some trepidation that
went to visit Jeff. Perhaps I should explain:
I am not that hairy. It has been mentioned
that I am thinning on top just a little,
perhaps receding. certainly not balding. I
am not touchy about it (not much, Kojak
- Ed), but I had nothing to worry about.
Fortunately. Jeff is not a man to be taken
in by appearances unlike some I could
mention (who is this Ed anyway?). He
realised that I was as hairy as the next man,
on the inside. And that's important,
because hairiness for Jeff is a philosophy,
it proc laims  h is  indiv iduality , h is
unwillingness t o accept things at face
value. It also means that he doesn't have
to fork out a fortune for a haircut as often
as the rest of us.
I visited Jeff at home in his family's
bungalow in Tadley, a village half-way
between Reading and Basingstoke. As
soon as you arrive, you know Jeff lives
there. On the wall is a large painted Llama.
Inside they're everywhere. The room Jeff
works in is a specially built extension
packed with computer equipment: 64,
Vic, C16 (he'd just bought one), Apple,
Atari, MSX, B/3C, Q L plus his  stereo
compact disc and the video machines,
including The Tempest and Atari's Star
Wars. But the most striking feature of the
room is the mural all along one wall. And
the subject matter? Llamas, of course. And
then the Llamas on top of the monitors —

ﬂuffy ones, plastic ones, metal ones. Not
to mention the camels and the alpacas.
It seems that Jeff can't remember
when this obsession with large ruminant
„quadrupeds began. While still at school
one of his ﬁrst games, programmed on an
8K Pet, was called Vicuna.
In those days, he used to get up at
6 o'clock in order to get to school and start
programming. There was  only  o n e
machine and time on it was limited. It
took him two or three months to learn
BASIC, but he soon tired of its limitations,
so h e  taught himself machine code.
"It took ine three days to to
780 machine code."
Getting up at six takes its toll, though, and
he saved for 6 months to buy a ZX80. By
this time, his talent was obvious and he
told me, "It took me three days to learn
Z80 machine code." Gulp.
Unfortunately, no-one recognised his
gift at university, where only a third of his
course was computing, so he left after a
year. Then, after a  couple o f  spells
working for dk'Ironics (he developed a
Graphics RO M for the ZX81) and for
Interceptor Micros (where he produced
versions of Amidar and Defender), he
started on his own. Gridrunner arrived
and the real Llamasoft was born.
No more getting up at six now. "I work
whenever I feel like it," he told me. But his
work-rate is prodigious. Just think of the
number o f  games, all different and
innovative, which he has produced in the
last 18 months: Hover Bovver, Hellgate,
Revenge of the Mutant Camels, Sheep
in Spac e ( ' m y  per s onal fav our ite
scrolling shoot-em-up' h e  said) and
Ancipital. And that's just a selection. Plus,
he is now producing a regular magazine,
the Nature of the Beast, all done on the
wonderful Macintosh. It's very readable,
very controversial in its opinion of games
(and magazines), and a lot of fun. If you
haven't seen a  copy, write t o Jeff at
L lamasoft.
When I met Jeff he hadn't exactly been
slacking. "I've never worked so hard in
my life," he said. He had just spent two
weeks on a brand new program, really a
brand new idea, Psychedelia. He had
been working on a game when the idea
came to him, and once that had happened
he dropped everything to complete it. In
two weeks it was ﬁnished, not just on the
64, but on the Vic and C16 as well.
So what is Psychedelia? It is not a
megagame. There are n o ladders, no
ramps., no bullets, no score, no lives, no
aliens, no smooth scroll, no sprites, no
lasers. Not a lot of anything, in fact, I
thought. Just shows how wrong you can
be. Jeff turned down the lights, put on
Thomas Dolby (the one with the Llama on
the album cover!), picked up the joystick
and started. The plain white pixel in the
middle o f  the screen burst into life.
Colour was  everywhere, i n  shapes,
patterns, movement. Pschedelia had me
hooked, I couldn't take my eyes off the
screen. I'll wear a ﬂower in my hair. (What
hair? Ed)
Psychedelia is a light synthesiser. It is
designed to be 'played' with a joystick, in
much the same way as you would play a
musk synthesiser. The keyboard offers a
variety of options such as pre-deﬁned
shapes (including a Llama), symmetry,
colour choice, shape sampling etc. The
joystick lets you create to the music of
your choice, t o interpret in  light the
sounds you most enjoy. Anyone can do it,
and skilfully too. If I have any criticism, it is
that the results that a novice can get are so
effective that I cannot see how practice
will necessarily impr ov e them. Yo u
cannot sit down at a music keyboard and
C:-

just play a tune. But perhaps I haven't seen
what a really skilful player can do. After
all, when I saw it, Jeff was the world's most
experienced user, and he'd only been
doing it for two weeks!
The program's  possibilities a r e
endless. Think o f  creating your own
audio-visual extravaganza for a party —
the 64 version will save up to an hour to
tape. Or you can just sit in a dark room to
enjoy the experience.
“I work whenever i feel like it.
Now that Psychedelia is out of his
system, Jeff can return to the game he
abandoned. It is called Mamma Llama,
and the stars are three llamas, a mother
and two youngsters. It is much more in the
tradition o f  Minter games —  smooth
scroll, excellent animation, bullets, aliens,
and of course llamas. It is clear, however,
that Jeff feels the time for such games is
passing. A lot of the innovations he began,
everybody has n o w  copied. Smooth
scrolling, for example. He was the ﬁrst on
the 64. He had seen it on the Atari and
then h e  "sussed i t  o u t  f r o m  t h e
Commodore manual." H e  feels that
Mamma Llama is his last game to use the
technique. It has been done to death and
he is very scathing of programmers like
Tony Crowther whom he feels use it for
no other reason that it's there. It goes
against his ﬁrst principle of games writing:
'Originality is where it's at," he said.
So whose games does he like? Taskset
was a name which came in for a lot of
praise. And h e  also showed me two
imported games for the Atari, developed
by Lucasﬁlms, called Behind Jaggi Lines
and Ballblaster. They're good, very good.'
Fingers crossed that they come over here
for the Commodore.
Mamma Llama may not be as great a
departure as Psychedelia„ but it has all the
quirkiness that sets a Minter game apart
from the rest. As Jeff said, "It takes a
certain type of mind to develop games —
freaky". He certainly has that. Our family

of Llamas travel through Peru, to Egypt
(got to get the camels in somewhere) and
to the moon. On the way, look out for
references to Jeff's favourite radio station
KMEL106 FM from Los Angeles (symbol: a
camel) and to his favourite drink, Inca
Cola, a yellow, Peruvian version of the
more famous original.
He discovered Inca Cola on his trip to
Peru last year. (For a full report, read The
Nature of the Beast 3). While I was with
him, he showed me his photos. And if
can't yet share his fascination for Llamas
(every plc had at least one in it) I can
certainly see why he would want to visit
their homeland. He travelled all round
the country, to Lima the capital, on a
railway at 14,000 feet above sea level,
to the mountains surrounding the great
Inca ruin of Machu Pichu. Jeff is not a
programmer who is manacled to the
computer. Like a good writer or musician
he is open to all sorts of inﬂuences and
they are reﬂected in his work.
His energy is limitless; he goes running
every day and he also skis. If there's one
word which sums up his attitude, it's
enthusiasm. A  lot of people enjoy his
games because they  realise h e  is  a
programmer w ho likes playing games
himself—and his own games are the ones
he most likes playing. He likes to hear
from people about what they think of his
games (and other people's) and, above all,
he likes going t o  shows to meet the
people who share his interest. I saw him at
the last PCW show, not selling lik e
everyone else, but completely engrossed
in a two-handed game of Ancipital with a
fellow enthusiast.
"It takes a certain hype of mind
to develop games — freaky."
He is not commercially minded and
doesn't like the new atmosphere. He is
prepared to put free programs up on
Compunet, for example, and nearly did so
with Psychedelia until persuaded by his
mother that it  might not be a  wise
decision. He liked the early days when
everyone w as  a n  enthus ias t a n d
understands t h e  tragedy  o f  g o o d
programmers being hyped Out of  the
market nowadays. But I cannot share his
belief that the o ld  days will return,
"Maybe this summer will sort out the
sheep from the goats," he said somewhat
ironically.
Jeff M in t e r  i s  t h e  bes t k now n
programmer in this country. A superstar? I
asked him. "I don't really think of myself
as a superstar," he said. "My idea of being
a superstar is to play a light synthesiser at a
concert." I hope it happens. He is a very
modest superstar, the best kind to be.

"We do not react to Atari" says Commodore boss
JACK TRAMIEL, FORMER BOSS O F
Commodore, and now the head of Atari
breezed into the country recently t o
announce his new company's range for
this year. He announced his intention to
'build a new line, a more advanced line
for the masses.'
His scheme is  based around four
different families of machine. The ﬁrst are
the games machines t o  replace t he
existing range. The second are the 8-bit
machines, 4  o f  them: 64K, 128K. a
mac hine w i t h  a d v a n c e d  m u s i c

Commodore's r eac tion t o  t h e

muted. Howard Stanworth, Commodore
UK's General Manager told me, "Our

Commodore 64 and VIC 20 programs

Finally, how does Commodoree view
Atari's policy of selling the 800-XL at E130?
Howard Stanworth again, "The customer
has demonstrated that the consumer is

it all promises to be an interesting battle.

MARSH right over to the programmer

realise what a COWDREY I am. I'll give it a

The simulation in  question is  Tim

received is pre-production and has few
anomolies which will be ironed out later. I
quote from the blurb: " In production

not have a distressing tendency to take
over the wicket-keeping in the ﬁelding

a real-life simulation.

PRACTICORP LTD HAS JUST RELEASED A
new, low-cost software package for the 64
which incorporates spreadsheet, word

can be incorporated into a single working

It is  Practicalc II and costs E69.95.
Looking at the spec, it seems to offer the
small business user a  fair  range o f
features: the database, for example, has
automatic alphabetic and numeric search

capabilities f o r  wr iting, editing a n d

user to create pictures and sound 'with
the simplicity and fun of playing a game'.
It is supposedly impossible to enter a
command which the computer doesn't
understand since a  Command menu

The only sources of protection at your disposal are quick wits and fast reﬂexes.
The only reward is to survive against monsters of unbelievable ferocity and

on a trip through the outer universe. This is the real world, populated by the

Use your memory and
judgement to guide
the tank driver
through the mineﬁeld]
and back safely to his
tank in Paul Randall's
game for the
unexpanded VIC 20.
The mines appear at the start
and then disappear. You must
remember where they are and
do your best to avoid them:
You must go around the trees
which are scattered around the
screen. You control the main
either by using a joystick or the
keyboard. When you reach the
tank, the game starts again with
more mines but less time to
study them.
To play the game, type in
the ﬁrst, smaller program and,
after checking the data, save it.
Then type in the other program
and save it (don't RUN it as the
program contains mac hine
code so it might crash). If it
crashes, check t h e  data i n
program 1.

This month Runecaster picks
up his joystick and grapples
his way through arcade
adventures.
THE ADVENTURE GAMES WE KNOW
and love so much, provide us with a narra-
tive as we move along — the descriptive
location texts, that so often make or mar a
good adventure. Additionally there may
be a graphic representation of what we
can _see at the different locations.
But if we go back to the original basic
scenario for an adventure, we may well
ﬁnd that there is another path by which
we can achieve our goal — the arcade
adventure. In certain cases it is difﬁcult to
know where to draw the line between
what is purely an arcade game and what is
an arcade adventure. Many of you will be
familiar with Chuckie Egg (A 'n' F Soft-
ware) and Manic Miner (Software Pro-
jects). Both of these involve moving
around a speciﬁc series of locations col-
lecting sufﬁcient objects to enable you to
move on to the next screen.
In neither of these two cases would
anyone call them adventures. The puzzles
involved are principally those of physical
co-ordination and manipulation of the
joystick, even though a logical path has to
be determined as well.
As time passes, I think we will see more
and more adventures which are joy,tick
operated, and that have little or no text.
That Is not to say that they will take the
place of the more traditional form but will
appear as a  separate branch of the
expanding software options that become
available.
Four arcade adventures
For some time there have been a
number of programs for the Sinclair
Spectrum that ﬁt this category, such as
Atic Atak and Sabre Wulf (both by
Ultimate). Only recently have we had
similar productions for the Commodore
EA. Four programs that move along this
alternative branch of the 'adventure tree'
are: Hercules, Cuthbert Enters the Tombs
of Doom, Quo Vadis and Impossible
Mission. How do they rate as adventures?
Hercules by Interdisc, looks at ﬁrst
sight to be another Manic Miner variant.
You play the part of Hercules and have to
solve the twelve labours set him by King
E
" Eyrystheus. Each task is preceeded by a
screenful of text describing the labour
that has been set. There are no objects or
treasures to be found as you progress
through each adventure but what you do
have to solve are a series of logical
puzzles/mazes that will enable you to
reach your objective.
Each labour consists of several screens
(50 in all) but unlike Chuckie Egg or Manic
Miner, not all of the ﬂoors are visible —
you have to work out where they are.
Some paths burst into ﬂames when you
tread on them, some disappear. Ropes
that you jump for, could brek under your
weight.
A reasonable amount of physical
(joystick) dexterity is required and if you
tarry too long at the beginning of each
part, the ﬂoor beneath you burns and you
perish. Be prepared to die fairly often as
you determine the right path to success!
Unlike many related games, Hercules
uses random access to the ﬁrst eleven
labours, so you are not continually faced
with the same screen each time you start.
Only having solved the ﬁrst eleven can
you then attempt the ﬁnal part!
Although Hercules can only barely
scrape into the 'arcade adventure' class, it
nonetheless presents a time consuming
and interesting game, with good graphics,
and many of the problems that you will
ﬁnd in other types of adventure. With
Cuthbert by Microdeal, not only do you
get a game with the now familiar 'cuddly
Cuthbert' as its hero, but also a very well-
presented small booklet with "ye sette of
instructions and clues". Read it carefully
— not only will you gain an insight to
playing the game, but Cuthbert's sense of
humour should bring some amusement
to the proceedings. I particularly liked the
pages entitled 'Tombstones' —  read
the small print!
Your (Cuthberf s) task is to travel as far
as possible through the ancient tombs of
Ledromica. Travel far enough and you will
come across areas of the tombs that
represent letters; spot all of these and a
prize awaits you from Microdeal. We are
told that there are more than 200
chambers, so you have some way to go!
Every so often you will ﬁnd your way
blocked by a locked door — easy enough
to open, all you need is a key! The keys are
heavy, so you may only hold one at a time
and having used it, you must ﬁnd another
to open the next door. The air between

each set of locked doors is steadily being
used up as you puff and pant your way
around. To make it more difﬁcult, there is
a deﬁnite time limit, within which you
must get a key to open the next door.
There are numerous treasures to be
found along the way but do not let your
greed overcome your need for oxygen!
There are 'baddies' that appear shortly
after you enter a chamber and you may
destroy these by using the 'Ray of Ra' (but
they still come back if you hang around).
You also have another ultimate weapon
that paralyses the evil ones — but having
used it, you must then collect enough
treasure from appropriately coloured
rooms to top up its potency for re-use!
This is  not a  very intellectually
demanding game —  other than
remembering where you last saw a key or
spotting red herrings that may tempt you
to use a key or your time unwisely. It can
certainly become quite addictive up to a
point a nd will tax t he  average
adventurer's skill to progress past about
100 chambers! T h e  only  r e a l
disappointment is that although the
graphics are quite good, they are
repetitive and probably this fact alone will
ﬁnally inhibit further incentive t o
continue.
Third in our present list of arcade
adventures is Quo Vadis by The Edge. For
those whose Latin is a little rusty, the title
translates as "whither goest thou?" Very
apt for an adventure game and especially
this one whose sheer size of area to
explore is probably approaching the
equivalent of 1000 screens!
Your aim is to ﬁnd the 'Sceptre of
Hope' hidden deep underground —
should you be the ﬁrst to do so and send
in a map of Quo Vadis, you may stand a
chance of winning an actual sceptre
worth £10000. Go to it!
You play the part of a 'spritely knight'
whose name in another reincarnation
must surely have been 'Spring Heeled
Jack' — his capacity for jumping is more
commendable! Not only is the movement
very smooth but as he moves he ﬁres a
continuous stream of ﬁre balls — very
reassuring. There are many rocky
platforms in the chambers for you to jump
to/from, and you won't die if you fall from
a great height — unless you happen to
land in a pit of boiling tar! There are ropes
to climb and a whole host of beasties to
ﬁght off. Should they or their missiles hit
you, you lose 'strength points', which in
turn may be accumulated (up to a
maximum of 100) by ﬁnding a series of
chests hidden in the caverns.
The background scenery is basically a
variation of the same graphics again and
again, but as the layout is so vast and the
combinations so cleverly put together,
you do not become bored with any
similarity. Also the variety of 'baddies'
keeps you on your toes.
There are a number of 'force ﬁelds'
that these aggressive inhabitants are
unable to pass and these enable our
intrepid adventurer to nip out, take a few
pot shots and retreat to safety. Repeating
this routine allows you to clear the way
with little or no loss to your strength. On
the other hand there are some positions
where it is impossible to employ this
technique.
Although this game does not appear to
provide a vast number of puzzles in the
sense o f  the  more conventional
adventure, it certainly gives the would-be
explorer a vast area to wander about,
together witheall the problems involved in
mapping and ﬁnally solving such an epic.
Impossible Mission from Epyx must
rate as the top of the range as far as arcade
adventures go at the present time. Very
brieﬂy the scenario is that you (Special
Agent 4125) must penetrate the
underground stronghold o f  mad
Professor Elvin Atombender (hereafter
known as Elvin) and break his security
codes to ﬁnd his control centre.
Having located Elvin you must stop
him completing his evil plans to destroy
the world. Your predecessors, Agents
4116 and 4124 (may they rest in peace!)
were able to send back a little information
that may help you (all given in the
excellent instruction booklet) but apart
from this, your only weapons are your
keen analytical mind and your MIA9366B
pocket computer!
On loading the  game you are
welcomed by Prof Elvin with: "Another
visitor; stay awhile...stay forever". This is
to enable you to adjust your volume
control. Yes, Impossible Mission has
speech synthesis — clear as a bell too!
You start in a lift (elevator to our
American cousins) and whilst here, or in
one of the passages directly alongside,
part of the screen displays your pocket
computer output. With this you can map
the rooms already visited, view the coded
puzzle pieces you may have found and
rotate these pieces to see if they ﬁt a
pattern or change their colour. Other
coded patterns may be found to enable
you to paralyse the robot guards or reset
the moving ﬂoor panels. The PC display
also keeps track of the time you have left
to succeed in your mission.
Travelling in the lift allows access to
other ﬂoors and rooms and moving along
corridors or  rooms creates excellent
echoing footsteps. Press the ﬁre button
and Agent 4125 executes the most
remarkable mid-air forward ﬂip — very
useful for somersaulting over robots
(sometimes!) Enter a room and you hear
Elvin's voice saying: "Destroy him my
robots". You fall through a hole in the
ﬂoor and hear yourself scream on the way
down!
Impossible Mission is  quite a
remarkable game and, although I'm
better at solving text puzzles than at
solving jigsaws (the hidden coded
patterns), I would recommend this one to
anyone — if only to see what can be done
with the modern home computer.
Each of the four 'adventures' I've
reviewed requires a certain dexterity with
the joystick — but if one has an arcade
adventure, I think you must expect it,
after all that is the 'raison d'être' of the
arcade game.
Not all of these games will appeal to
everyone, but try and get your local
computer shop to get them up and
running for you. I wouldn't mind betting
that at least one of them will 'get you'. It
will certainly prove interesting to see how
this branch of the computer adventure
saga progresses in the future.
More on mapping
Those that have read this column before
will probably have realised that I put a
great deal of stress on thorough mapping
of advenuture games. In its most simple
form, all you need is a large sheet of
paper, a pencil (and an eraser for the odd
mistake) and a cool head!
Where we can so easily go wrong is by
not being neat and methodical and also
the silly situation where we draw our
boxes too large and don't have enough
room on the paper, or make them too
small to list all we ﬁnd in that location!
Print n'Plotter Products have now
come to the aid of the adventurer with
their 'Adventure Planner'. In the past this
ﬁrm have produced several extremely
useful products that have made the life of
the programmers much easier — mainly
plotting sheets for Hi-Res pixel graphics,
sprite design pads and so on.
Adventure Planner gives you 50 sheets
of A3 size paper with 154 linked location
boxes (on an 11 x 14 grid) printed in light
grey. The boxes are a reasonable size to
write a brief description of a location,
together with what you have found there.
Outline the box and the movement
possibilities in pen or soft pencil and your
map will stand out from the grid —simple,
useful and logical — thanks P'n'PP.
Notes on how to use, and a simple
example are included on the ﬁrst page —
thereafter there is room for Adventure
name, notes, dates, vocabulary etc. The
only point I would add is; still do a rough
initial map on a scrap of paper, as before
serious mapping you should have some
idea whether your adventure will develop
to the North, South, East or West! For
instance, Eric the Viking (Mosaic) starts in
the East and all initial action takes place as
you move West — therefore you would
start mapping to the right of your page,
wouldn't you?
Print n'Plotter Products A3 Adventure
Planner should retail at £3.95 — if you
cannot ﬁnd one locally, write directly to
them at: 19 Borough High Street, London
SE1 9SE, and enclose £4.50 which includes
post and packing.

Title: Computer Art and
Graphics
Author: Axel  Bruck
Publisher: Petzold
Price: i 14.
WITH MO S] O F  THE HOME CO M-
puters appearing today having some form
of advanced graphics capability, interest is
increasing in the area of computer art.
This volume presents a serious but easy to
use discussion of certain aspects of the
topic. As I'll discuss later, the book is sadly
lacking in a number of areas. The pro-
grams presented in the book were devel-
oped on the Apple computer, but can be
readily extended to other machines.
Before continuing, I think it's a good
idea to attempt to differentiate between
graphics and art. The word "graphics" is
often misused. My  interpretation is that
graphics are simply the representation of
visual information — on your TV screen, a
sheet of paper or a bathroom wall, for
ex ample, w h e r e a s  a r t  i s  t h e
communication o f  ideas through a
suitable medium such as stone, paint or
your computer's graphics. The point the
book and I  are making is  that your
computer's graphics are simply a means to
an end, and that end can be art.
In the foreword, the author of the
book suggests t w o  approaches t o  -
"computer ar t". First w e  hav e t h e
computer specialist approach. In this case
the computer is given a full set of design
rules, a full set of algorithms and the
result is  a  100% computer generated
product. O n  t h e  other  hand, t h e

generates a variety of shapes or effects.
The picture is then ﬁnished by the artist
giving a  human element. The author
adopts t h e  latter  approach, simply
because art needs that human element.
To assist your creation of pictures, a
library o f  routines are necessary. This
book provides such tools. It has been
known f o r  a  long time that three
dimensional matter can be resolved into
geometric forms . T h e  cubists a n d
Cezanne, for  example, exploited this
idea. Similarly, most of the routines given
in the book produce hexagons in various
forms. Using this simple shape, complex
structure can be created.
The book is carefully structured and
routines slowly become more complex as
you progress. Things start with simple
single and multiple shapes and progress
to 2  dimens ions , 3  dimens ions ,
perspective and movement. The most
complex routines enable you to build up
shapes. ellipsoids and toroids using solid
sub-shapes. Again these shapes can be
moved and made to obey the rules of
perspective. Throughout t h e  book ,
colour plates o f  pictures ar e giv en
showing what can be done. Most of these
plates have to be drawn on a plotter with
colour and other effects air brushed on
afterwards.
The book is a joy to use and very easy
to follow. The program listings are clearly
laid out with copious notes in the text. The
development of ideas is augmented by
clear diagrams and the presentation is
faultless. As  a  hard-back book , this
volume is good value for money and
deserves a place on your library shelf.
Inevitably, ther e are weaknesses.
Firstly, the emphasis on hexagonal forms
leads t o  rather monotonous pictures.
Other for ms  such as  triangles and
tetrahedra hav e t h e ir  o w n  v alue,
especially in the formation of  smooth
undulating surfaces. The author seems to
have a  predilection for  surreal forms
featuring eye balls. Whilst the pictures are
technically excellent, more variety would
be an idea. None of the routines use
hidden line removal. Which can be slow
and complex, but if you're using the TV
rather than a plotter, it makes pictures
easier t o  resolve. I n  spite o f  these
reservations, the library of routines is
extensive and powerful.
For the sake of 64 owners, the author
includes a BASIC routine for plotting
points which can be readily inserted into
the drawing programs. Since all is in
BASIC, the drawing of shapes tends to be
slow. Owners of extended BASIC such as
BC BASIC or Simon's BASIC should have
little difﬁculty in converting the routines.
I tested out the routines using Supersoft's
GRAPHIX 64 and found the results quite
acceptable.
The one drawback of the approach
used in this book is that things are still
rather mechanical. If you want to produce
a freer form of art, you must resort to
alternative methods. These include light
pens, graphics pads and mechanical
tracers. There are a number of excellent
products about and the only limitation is
your skill and imagination.
Title:' Game Master
uthor: P.K. McBride
blisher: Longman
ce: £5.95
THIS BOOK INCLUDES LISTINGS FOR
the reader t o  ty pe i n  as  w e ll a s
programming advice. Whilst this means
that you only get four games to play, you
will learn something at the same time. The
book is split into three sections covering
action games, adventures and interactive
or strategic games.
The author introduces each aspect of
the type of game, demonstrates it with
some example routines and then gives a
full listing to type in.
The ﬁrst section deals w it h  t h e
creation of arcade type, "zap-the-alien"
games. The areas discussed include the
design of title pages, movement of sprites..
delays, sights for shooting games, halls of
fame, mazes, special effects and sound.
There's quit e a  degree o f  overlap
between sections b u t  this  tends t o
enhance the impact. Above all, there is
sufﬁcient information a n d  ideas t o
stimulate mos t users. Mu c h  t o  my

surprise, the author acknowledges the
speed limitations of BASIC and discusses
the use of compilers and FORTH as faster
alternatives.
As an adventure buff, I found the next
section interesting. Again all aspects of
the programming methods used ar e
discussed, ranging from planning the
scenario to randomness. The ﬁnal section
on strategy games is, not unsurprisingly,
the shortest. General concepts ar e
discussed, but when it comes down to it,
simulations are pretty tough to program
well. T he book concludes with three
appendices w h ic h  discuss BASIC
keywords, the design of characters and
the manipulation of sprites.
Game Master is a rather rare breed.
Firstly, it is fun in that it gives a number of
full games and some short routines to
input and play. Secondly, it's a mine of
useful facts, hints and most importantly
for games writers, ideas. At the price, it
represents excellent value and is worth
close examination.

ASK ANYONE IN  THE STREET WHAT
their conception of a computer is and
they will probably think of something
between Metal Mickey, Hal (from 2001)
and R2D2. The sad truth is, however, that
computers are basically pretty stupid and
1MAR
Commodore 64
will only do what they are told. This book
discusses some of the ways in which you
can make your M  appear to be intel-
ligent. Rather than adopt an erudite,
in-depth approach to the subject, the
authors combine a  little theory with
demonstration programs w hic h a r e
described section b y  section. These
programs can be used as a base upon
which you can develop more complex
models. To help the reader understand
the techniques described, many ﬂow
diagrams are provided.
The ﬁrst ﬁve chapters deal with the
interpretation o f  language. Thes e
artiﬁcial
on the commodore 64
tholoavour micro think
keith s t e
techniques feature in adventure games
and such Al classics as Eliza and Abuse.
The problem of parsing the input text,the
recognition and interpretation of words
and the formulation o f  responses are
covered i n  detail. T he chapters are
carefully structured s o  t h a t  s imple
concepts are introduced and then reﬁned
to give greater ﬂexibility and power.
Having a computer that simply gives
an amusing response to something you
type in does become a little dull, In the
next couple of chapters, the authors apply
themselves to learning programs in which
the computer acts as an expert with an in
built data base. The idea is  that the
machine asks you questions on a subject
and i t  remembers your replies, using
them to modify its reactions later. One of
the ideas developed gives you a fault
ﬁnding system for cars. The computer asks
you questions and gives it's diagnosis of
the fault based on your responses.
The ﬁnal chapters deal w ith t h e
problem o f  rec ognition. Firstly, a
technique called "Fuzzy Matching" is
discussed. This is a system introduced in
the USA to assist in census taking. By using
a set of rules, names are reduced to a four
character code. A program is provided
which shows how the matching of names
can be carried out using this technique.
Finally, a simple demonstration of shape
recognition is given.
This is both an educational and fun
book w h ic h  handles  a  potentially
complex topic in a nice simple manner. If
you want to really see what your 54 can do
rather than just play games, try this book,
it's well worth reading.

Title: Music and Sound ﬁg
the Commodore 64
Author: B.L. Behrendt.
Publisher: Prentice-Hall
Price: £34.78
THE INCLUSION O F SOPHISIICATED
sound chips such as the 6581 means that
you have the added extra o f  sound
synthesis without the need t o  buy  a
separate synthesiser. In addition to the
annoying lack of sound commands on the
64, sound synthesis is a complex ﬁeld that
isn't readily mastered. This book is one of
many dedicated t o  the discussion o f
sound synthesis. The package in  fact,
comprises a disc and a book. Rather than
force you to type in all the programs
discussed, they are recorded on the disc
leaving you free to concentrate on the
theory of the music.
The book starts with three chapters on
theory. These cover the physics of sound
and the fundamental units o f  sound
synthesisers. T hes e c hapter s  a r e
important s inc e they  introduce t h e
subject and describe how the operations
encountered later work. Details of the
various registers in the 6581 are given
along with operational parameters.
The remaining chapters cover many
interesting aspects of sound synthesis and
provide routines t o  demonstrate the
lessons learned. The most noteworthy
routines pr ov ide fac ilities  f o r  t h e
development of sounds, music editing
and a simple sequencer. The information
in the text provides example settings
which can be used in the programs to
produce interesting effects.
Computers can be programmed with
certain rules of operation to behave in a
human-like manner. This is often called
artiﬁcial intelligence. A similar exercise
can be carried out with sound so that the
computer generates music. Simple music
generation techniques are introduced
into the book demonstrating how sound
based on simple scales or chords can be
generated. Surprisingly the effects are
quite pleasant if not a little monotonous.
Finally, you are provided with a number
of routines for sound effects which are
not only suitable for use in your own
programs but can be developed to give
further effects.
Overall, this is a highly entertaining
and useful package which is well written
and presented but the price is ludicrous:
half the price would be nearer the mark.
Title: Turbocharge your 64
Author: P .  Worlock
Publisher: Longman
Price: 0 . 9 5
AUTHORS OF BOOKS LIKE THIS OWE A
lot to Commodore's policy of providing
useless manuals with their computers.
This book ,  r ather  t h a n  pr ov iding
information on the basics of the 64, claims
to tell you how "the Professionals" do it. I
rather dispute this claim but some readers
might believe it. In essence the book gives
masses of hints, tricks and wheezes which
w ill c e r t a i n l y  e m b e l l i s h  y o u r
masterpieces. Because of this approach,
the treatment of information tends to be
of a "potted" nature rather than " in
depth".
To get you in the mood for writing
wonder programs, we start with program
structure and a discussion of the various
functions available from BASIC. As a
simple intoduction t o  structure, these
chapters aren't bad, but the lessons learnt
aren't very earth shattering. The section
on func tions  discusses t h e  trans-
cendentials and RND but doesn't cover
any new ground.
One of the "in" phrases in computer
circles is  "user friendly". The author
recognises this attribute and gives quite a
decent section on interaction. This covers
methods of inputting information, error
trapping and formatting of displays. A
short machine code PRINT AT routine is
given as a  handy utility. The area of
interfacing is extended later in the book
to cover joysticks. Again a machine code
utility is supplied as an aid.
The sections on graphics are of a
higher standard and cover most of the
important areas. There's a fair discussion
of the memory organization of the 64 and
how to redeﬁne characters, the use of
sprites and high resolution graphics.
Simple character movement is described
as is the use of sprites to give simple
animation effects.
Finally for lovers of music and sound
effects, t he operation o f  the SID is
examined along w it h  a  reasonable
amount of musical theory.
I found it a little difﬁcult to decide
whether I loved or loathed this book. The
treatment of the material is good but the
book does  n o t  g iv e  t h e  c laimed
"professional' techniques. The material
supplied is quite standard and no more
than I  w ould expect i n  a  manual.
Throughout ther e ar e s hort BASIC
routines which demonstrate various
points and the presentation is lively and
attractive. If I do have a complaint, it is
that the chapters tend to be rather short
and occasionally superﬁcial.

part three of this
!pries, David Rees
Plows you how to
overcome the main
drawback of BASIC 111
tames — lack of 1 1 1
speed.
MOST BASIC GAMES LACK
one vital commodity — speed.
This means that the majority of
BASIC arcade type games are
slow a n d  b o r i n g  w h e n
implemented, a n d  t h u s
become unpopular. Machine
code (including those routines
given in the ﬁrst two parts of
this series) helps t o  speed
things up, but BASIC running
time is still the main limiting
factor. T o remedy this, part
three concentrates on speed
increases in this domain.
Some speed increases are
obvious (e.g. removing spaces
and putting several statements
onto each line), but others
need greater investigation. It is
always a good idea to put the
main routine (the section that is
used constantly when the game
is in progress) near to the start
of the program. Not only does
this mean that GOTO line
numbers will be shorter, but
exeucution time is saved. This is
because each line in  Com-
modore BASIC is  found by
tracing along from the start of
the program, so the nearer it is
to the start, the quicker it is
found.
Style and logical layout are
also important. If you put all
eventualities i n  t h e  m a i n
routine, the game will be very
slow. It is best to strip the main
routine to the bone, leaving
only a PRINT, GET, GOTO and
a few IF/THENs (with a few SYSs
if machine code is to be used).
To cope with the other needs
of the game, simply GOTO or
GOSUB separate routines. For
instance, to test key presses,
you only need a GET statement
and an IF condition. This can
decide if any key at all has been
pressed, and if  this is so, a
separate routine can handle
the combinations o f  presses
(quick tip here: POKE 650.128
gives repeat for all keys, and
POKE 650,0 giv es  nor mal
repeat, w hile POKE 650,64
stops all repeating).
It is sensible t o  put all
routines in order of frequency
of use so that those needed
most often can be accessed in
less time. Thus, a key respond
will be ﬁrst in most cases, while
a los e lif e  r outine w ould
probably be last.
Usage of certain functions
should be kept to a minimum.
For example, the easy way to

update the screen ﬁgures is to
PRINT them with each routine
cycle.
However, score and most
certainly lives lost does not
need this rapid update. It is
more appropriate to print out
each set of ﬁgures only when
they change, thus saving time.
Instructions
Hopefully, your own ingenuity
and the information provided
in thes e articles has  lead
you to create a fast, interesting
game. However, many people
falter at the next, ﬁnal step.
A game is only fun if it is easy
to use and has some extra in-
centives attached, but many
programmers miss this point
in the rush for their family's
and friends' acclaim.
One of the most important
extras i s  t h e  instructions.
Essentials, such as which key to
press, should be included but a
friendly, well set out intro-
duction adds polish t o  the
game. Options at the end of the
game should not be ignored. If
somebody wants  t o  hav e
another game, he should be
allowed t o  d o  so easily, by
following c lear ly  s e t  o u t
instructions, rather than b y
RUNning the program again_
Finally, a player always likes
to seem important, no matter
how well he or she did. The
best way to accomplish this
is to use a score table. Listing
1 gives a score program for the
Commodore, and allowances
have been made so it can be
easily integrated into a games
program. Colour produced by
the program is not shown in the
screen dump, but it is still a
powerful tool. Colour can be
used for highlighting, and can
easily make the game title and
top score outstanding.
C

Having produced what is in
your view the game of 1985
how do you convert your
hobby into an arguably
lucrative profession? In search
of an answer, Alison Hiut
spoke to some of the leading
software houses. 11
IT'S CERTAINLY TOUGH AT THE TOP.
All the software houses I spoke to will
look at any game submitted to them, but
the standard is very high. "Everything sent
to us gets looked at", insists Jeremy Cooke
of Virgin Games. But, "The new market
requires a high standard. It's increasingly
difﬁcult to ﬁnd good stuff." Virgin accept
approximately 5% of the games submitted
to them; this is about average. A'n'F, for
example, receive about 150 to 200 games a
year of which around 4% are accepted.
Other are less generous: Anirog accept
about one game a year. How, then, do you
qualify?
First steps
The software house moguls disagree on
the form in which they wish to receive,
your game initially. Jeffrey Heath o f
Activision believes that the idea behind
the game rather than its actual content is
paramount. Activision would then pass it
on to their European designers and, if the
idea is approved, the programmer would
be invited to discuss it further. Other
companies, such as Quicksilva, would
prefer to see the completed game.
However, m o st  l i k e  t o  see a
demonstration version. Roger Gamon of
Anirog thinks it is necessary to see some
concrete evidence of the game so his
software experts can 'see all potential
aspects of the game'.
Selection procedures
All the software houses I spoke to have
different selection procedures. They vary
from o n e resident software expert
employed solely f or the purpose o f
assessing submitted games to a team of
E
Bubble Bus, "A review body of 4 or 5
decides if the idea needs to be pursued".
If your game is given the 'thumbs
down', it will be returned (but there's
always another plan of  attack -  read
SO YOU'VE
WRITTEN A
GAME
on). And don't raise your hopes too high
even if you are given the initial stamp of
approval. Mike Fitzgerald of A'n'F says
that 30 or 40 of the games produced by
them are never ﬁnalised. However, if the
contract is withdrawn, they return the
copyright to the programmer.
Very few games are published in their
initial state. "We would accept very few
games a s  presented", says M i k e
Fitzgerald. All software companies have
teams of experts who enhance graphics
and sound, for example_ Mike Fitzgerald
reckons that 4 to 6 weeks usually pass from
the time of receiving a game to the time
it's marketed.
What's in a game
Originality scores top marks, Jeremy
Cooke says, "To some extent, there are
still too many people sending in a straight
rip off. It's like the music business where
people copy a Paul McCartney song and
then wonder why they're not successful."
Like all software houses, Virgin are very
anxious to hear from programmers with
novel ideas.
But a few borrowed routines may be
acceptable — as long as this isn't carried to
excess. Mike Fitzgerald told me: "If
somebody actually disembowelled Jet Set
Willy, I'd turn it down. But, for example,
in Krazy Kong, there is a routine with
things rolling down a  girder. Now, if
somebody used the same routine in a
game submitted, I wouldn't turn it down
because of this."
Original ideas are hard to come by.
"We haven't had any really good original
ideas sent in." said Roger Gamon. So,
what else helps sell your game to the
'powers-that-be'?
Addiction is also very important. It is
described by Jeremy Cooke as, "That
magic quality whereby it's easy to start a
game but difﬁcult to keep going" or.
simply, as 'playability', by Sandy Marchant
of Bubble Bus.
Games written in BASIC are generally
unpopular. Roger Gamon believes that
some games (although strategy games
rather than arcade games) 'can be written
quite well in BASIC' but others believe,
that games written in BASIC are given a
bad press. "The punters tear it apart —
they don't like it", says Jeremy Cooke.
Mark Eyles of Quicksilva was the most
outspoken in his condemnation of BASIC
games: "I can't think of any program
written in BASIC good enough to publish;
it would need to be in machine code".
The initial impact o f  the game is
COMMODORE 64 JOYSTICK CONTROL

obviously important and, therefore, the
sound and graphics should be of a high
standard. But, as Mark Eyles pointed out,
anybody submitting a game to a software
house is assumed to be of a high technical
standard — and software houses employ
teams of people to enhance sound and
graphics.
But, technical ability and creativity
don't always go hand in hand — "Often
good programmers aren't always the
people with good ideas", says Jeremy
Cooke. An exceptional programmer will
be welcomed and encouraged as would
an excellent game. " I f  the game is
technically very good — say, an amazing
version of hangman — although we're not
interested in the game, we might use the
programmer for conversion work or feed
him with ideas".
Money, money, money...
So, your game — or your potential as a
programming genius  —  has  been
accepted. What are your rewards? It's a
myth t h a t ,  o n c e  y ou'r e regarded
favourably by one of the top software
houses, you're on a quick road to fame
and fortune. " A programmer's earning
capacity has been exagerrated", says
Roger G amon. H av ing w r it t e n  a
successful program, a programmer can
earn as much as 11-2,000 a month but
success soon wanes: the life of a program
is now very short — about 2-3 months.
Some programmers can earn 110-20,000 a
year whereas others will earn a mere one
or two hundred for one game which has
gained minimal success.
Most companies encourage their
programmers to accept royalties but, in
some circumstances, the programmer can
receive a straight fee. Royalties present
more of a risk. Mark Eyles says, "If the
game does well, we both do well," — and,
of course, vice versa! But royalties do
offer higher potential earnings. Roger
Gamon stated the example where one
programmer, who would have received
an outright fee of [1,500, earned [11,000
in commission.
Most companies a r e  als o q u it e
prepared t o  offer their programmers
advanced royalties —  to assist in  the
purchase of equipment crucial to the
development o f  t h e ir  n e x t  master-
piece, for example.
Other assistance
It is not only to your ﬁnancial advantage to
be found and nurtured by one of the
leading software houses, As Mark Eyles
told me, "With the market as it is now, if a
programmer is capable of producing a top
selling game, we will keep with him. With
the life of games being not as long as they
once were, programmers need to keep
churning out hits. A lot of programmers
produce one amazing game. When we
ﬁnd a good programmer, we encourage
them to do a follow-up straight away —to
keep on working". Their service to their
programmers includes regular contact
through newsletters, They also provide
them w it h  equipment, as  d o  mos t
software houses. Their new programmers
will also have a wealth of advice and
technical expertise at hand.
The software houses are always on the
look out 'for new blood. Anirog, for
example, advertise for new programmers.

Points to remember:
•  Originality
•  Presentation
•  Addiction
•  Machine code
•  Sound & Graphics
•  Technical ability

—Software houses don't want another version of
Pacman
—Initial impact and documentation are very important.
—A low boredom rating on a game means better value
for money.
—BASIC isn't strictly taboo but Machine Code is more
efﬁcient and professional.
—Such details grab the software expert's attention.
—Maybe you haven't got an original idea in your head
- but the software houses are always on the look out
for technical expertise.
"We are deﬁnitely on the look out for
new programmers," says Roger Gamon.
Their programming requirements exceed
the availability. This said, it is very difﬁcult
to ﬁnd programmers o f  t he calibre
required and many resort to other means.
Says Jeffrey Heath, "Because we have
such a superb supply of products from our
parent company, the standards needs to
be exceptionally high."
Final note
However, don't be disillusioned by the
seemingly impossible odds  y ou face
should you decide to submit your game to
one of the software houses. Just bear in
mind a few important facts. First of all,
choose y our potential publisher with
care. I f  your game is a fast, addictive
arcade type game opt for  a  software
company which trades in that sort of
software, such as Anirog. If adventure is
your forte, then Level 9 are likely to take
more interest in it than, say Virgin Games.
Secondly, remember that the software
houses receive a very large input of games
and so those with instant appeal are likely
to grab their attention. Make sure your
game i s  w e l l  pres ented a n d  t h e
documentation is clear and accurate. As
we've learnt from experience, there's
nothing worse than receiving a game with
a sound and interesting idea when, due to
minimal doc umentation, w e  c an't
decipher how the hell to play it!
Magazines
OK, so maybe the produce of your labour
isn't a  totally original game of Manic
Miner standards. But it's good. Why
should it only be reserved for the eyes of
your nearest and dearest? Games players
everywhere should bear witness to your
semi-genius. All is not lost. Your deserved
acclaim can yet exceed a  look of
admiration from little brother or a pat on
the head from Aunt Alice. There's a
wealth o f  computer magazines strewn
across t h e  shelves o f  y o u r  loc al
newsagents (although only one of any
note, I hasten to add!).
Magazines look for the same basic
qualities i n  a  submitted game as the
software houses — originality, technical
ability , g o o d  p r e s e n t a t io n  a n d
documentation (and a 110 note — Ed.).
You should also take into consideration
that we haven't a supply of technical
experts on call to add amendments to
your sound and graphics. So, it is probably
more important that your game is totally
bug free and does exactly what it says it
does. The documentation should also be
very clear and accurate as our readers
who have to type in the game may not be
as technically adept as you are — and we
will be inundated with phone calls if they
can't get the game to work!

A CROSSWORD IS A  NAT-
ural arena for developing and
using techniques for handling
strings a n d  arrays. T h e
computer can b e  made t o
display t h e skeleton f o r a
crossword, to accept entries for
it, and even t o  verify and
display these entries. By writing
a program to do these things,
we can create an 'interactive
crossword', which can do a
great d eal m o re  t h an  a
crossword t h at  i s  merely
printed i n  a  newspaper.
Besides verifying entries, i t
could even be made to ﬁll in an
entry if the person tackling the
crossword w ere genuinely
stuck.
For this month's program-
ming project, we shall look at
how the numbering plan for a
crossword can be computed
from its skeleton, and how the
length of the solution to each
clue can be found. We shall
then go on to construct a basic
interactive crossword that
veriﬁes the solver's attempt at
the answer to any clue. The
programs that are presented
for these activities should
provide a  ﬁrm basis for the
creation of a truly interactive
crossword that is much more
user friendly than a conven-
tional one. In creating this, we
can demonstrate that t h e
computer is a  much more
advanced m e d i u m  f o r
supporting a crossword than
the commonly used medium of
paper.

42 displaying a crossword
A small crossword is shown,
together with its clues in Figure
1. T h e solution t o  this is
1111111111/1N/M111111111MINIMEM
contained i n  t h e programs
presented l at er o n .  T h e
skeleton of the crossword is
shown in Figure 2. Obviously, it
consists only of black and white
squares, which makes t h e
problem of displaying it quite
simple. I n  fact, w e  shall
represent it with a surround of
dark squares, as shown i n
Figure 3. By doing this, we can
treat the squares at the edge of
the crossword itself in the same
way as all the others during
computations on them. It also
makes t h e display o f  t h e
crossword on the screen more
effective.
The crossword can  b e
represented in the computer
by using a  two-dimensional
array of string variables. Each
element
a sin g le sq u are o f  t h e
crossword, by containing the
letter that should be placed in
that s q u a r e  w h e n  t h e
crossword is ﬁlled in, or some
other character to represent a
black square (we shall use a
space character f o r  t h is
purpose). 
-
We shall use an array named
CROSSS to store the crossword.
As our crossword has 6 rows
and 6 columns, we shall give
CROSS$ dimensions of 7 by 7,
and then rows 0 and 7, and
columns 0 and 7 can be used to
hold the border. We can now
represent the crossword itself

After this the crossword can be
displayed b y  a  si m p l e
procedure which w e  shall
package a s  a  subroutine
starting with the line number
1000. I t  w ill display t h e
crossword in the opposite style
to that in which it appears on
paper, with the squares that are
black on paper appearing light
on the screen. After adding the
calling instruction
150 GOSUB 1000
the display subroutine is
written as:
:50 WW1,  1000
160 EAD
41e I F  CRO S W FO W . 0 0 0 . 0 " THEN PRINT CHRS(.166,, 6 0 TO  440

1010 FOR J=0 TO 7  FO R 1
1020 I F  CRO I
1030 P I I l T "
1040 NEXT 1‹ P RI NT
lelai RETURN
This is ﬁne if we want to
display the crossword, but a
crossword puzzle solver wants
to see the skeleton so that it can
be ﬁlled in. However, our
display subroutine can b e
adapted t o  give only t he
skeleton by changing line 1030
to:
1030 PRINT' ";
so that it prints a space rather
than any letter forming part Oa
solution. Again, the crossword
skeleton will appear on the
screen with the reverse of its
appearance on paper.
Finding the numbering
plan
The numbering plan for a
crossword is the set of numbers
that is added to it to identify the
positions in which the solutions
of the clues are to be written.
The solution to 5 across, for
example, starts in the square
numbered Sand goes across, or
horizontally, from there, while
the solution to 7 down starts in
the square numbered 7 and is
written downwards from there.
The numbering plan can be
determined automatically from
the skeleton. This is done by
examining each square in turn,
i i i i
Figure 2. The crossword skeleton
row by row, starting at the top
left and ﬁnishing at the bottom
right. T h e  numbers a r e
associated only with blank
squares, so the others may be
ignored during this process.
When each blank is examined,
a code-is assigned to it in a way
that r e ﬂe c t s  i t s  f o u r
neighbouring squares to the
north, east, south and west. All
the possible conﬁgurations for
the squares surrounding a
blank square are shown in
Figure 4 .  T h e  c o d e  i s
determined by counting 1 for a
black square to the north, 2 for
one to the east, 4 for one to the
south, and 8  for one to the
west. The codes are also shown
on Figure 4. A little thought will
show that solutions can only
begin in a square having one of
the codes 1,3,8,9,11,12 and 13.
But the codes give more
information than just where a
solution begins. They also show
whether the word goes across
or down, or even if a square can
have answers going both across
and down starting from it. By
referring to Figure 4 again, we
can see that words starting in a
square with the code 8,12 or 13
go across, and those starting in
a square coded as 1,3 or 11 go
down. If a square has the code 9
then there will be words going
across and down from it.
Using this information, we
can ﬁnd the numbering plan
and print it on the skeleton
with the following program,
which computes the numbers
and stores them in an array
named N .  This section o f
program starts a t  line 150,
overwriting the call t o  the
display subroutine, which is
not needed again as this
section of program contains its
own display routine. After
adding the dimensions for the
array N to line 10 with:
10 DIM CROSS$(7,7),N(6,6)
the addition to the program is:
FEADY.
Figure 3 Crossword with surround
Note t h a t  w h e n  t h e
skeleton is printed complete
with numbers, any number
from 10 upwards is truncated so
that only its least signiﬁcant
digit is displayed. This is for the
very good reason that only one
character can be displayed in
one character position! But
despite the fact that only the
last digit o f  the number is
displayed t h e  number i s
computed in full. To prove this,
we can print a  list o f  the
numbers and directions for all
the clues in the crossword by
adding the lines
222 IF 1=1 OR T=3 OR 1=11 OR
T=9 THEN PRINT N; "DOWN"
224 IF T=8 OR T=12 OR T=13 OR

Our interactive crossword can
now b e  programmed fairly
simply to accept an attempt at a
solution and to ﬁnd whether it
is correct or not by comparing
it with the answer that it already
holds. This is the point at which
it really  starts t o  become
interactive.
To enter a  potential
solution to a clue, we could
expect the user to provide us
with three things: the number
of the clue, whether it goes

indeed go across or down, so
verifying t h e  second it e m

since we know how to ﬁnd the

different ways,
Summary
The p ro g ram  fragments
presented here provide a kit of
parts for the construction of a
bask 'interactive crossword'.
The parts need to be assembled
coherently, the code needs to
be made secure against the
entry of invalid data, and there
is scope for further develop-
ment before a fully interactive
crossword p r o g r a m  i s
produced.
Nevertheless, many of the
necessary building blocks and
ideas a re  here, T h e basic
structure of the program needs
improving, n o t  least  b y
packaging routines that are
needed more than once as
subroutines. T h e ultimate
success o f  a  program i n
providing a n  interactive
crossword may depend on its
structure.
A complete listing of the
program developed i n  this
article is given in Figure 5.

FROM A  SUPERF ICIAL
viewpoint, we could deﬁne a
subroutine as a collection of
programming lines terminating
in the keyword RETURN and
activated (called) b y  t h e
keyword GOSUEt. After a few
weeks playing around with
programs we would probably
reach the conclusion that a
subroutine functions as a kind
of subcontract t o  the main
program. Like a subcontractor
in t h e building trade who
specialises in , say, making
window frames, a subroutine
can be given the responsibility
of providing a picturesque and
coloured border around the
screen or, on a slighte higher
plane, ﬁn d in g  t h e  t w o
solutions o f  a  quadratic
equation. T h e beneﬁt o f
subcontracting in real life is the
fact that advantage can b e
taken of specialised expertise
and equipment. It is the same
with programminng. As your
experience widens, you will
begin to notice that programs,
however c o m p l e x  a n d
different in overall objectives,
contain many similar ingre-
dients even though there may
be differences i n  variable
names. Once this is recognised,
you w ill realise that w ell
designed subroutines can be
used over and over again in a
wide variety of programs. As a
result, yo u r approach t o
programming could change
dramatically. In fact you will
probably ease o f f  writing
complete programs until you
have built up a stock of useful,
general purpose subroutines
— a subroutine library in fact.

Subroutines and
structure
A w ell stocked subroutine
library can save an enormous
amount of programming time
in the future and, above all,
help y o u  t o  p l a n  w e l l
structured programs. Unfor-
tunately, w h en  a  w rit er
introduces the word 'structure'
it usually means that the next
few thousand words will be
devoted to a boring explana-
tion o f  what it  means and,
worse still, a certain amount of
name dropping. Names like
Edsger W. Dijkstra (reputedly
quite clever but something of
an intellectual snob) and
Niklaus Wirth (the creator of
PASCAL) are mentioned with
the kind o f  humility and
deference normally accorded
to royalty and disc jockeys! The
subject of program structure,
although inherently worthy, is
ridden w it h  pretentious
cultism, p rej u d i ce a n d
pedantry. We shall be content
with a simple deﬁnition:
A well structured program is
easy to modify and the listing is
easy to follow.
The liberal use of subroutines
within a program will certainly
contribute t o  t he structure
providing they are reasonably
well thought out in the ﬁrst
place.
Subroutine layout
Although subroutines are good
for structure, there is n o
denying that their worst aspect
is the need to ca I them by
means of a line number. For
example, suppose we have a
subroutine which starts at 1467
and designed to draw a row of
characters across the screen.
We would call it by means of:
GOSUB 1467
A line number has n o
humanity. I t  i s  abstract
symbolism and, even worse, it
is quite probable that the
number is provisional and will
most likely be changed as the
result o f  a  renumbering
excercise during program
development.
How much better it would
be if  BASIC allowed us to
choose a  meaningful label
instead of a line number. For
example, instead of  GOSUB
=
=

P r o g r a m m i n g
1467, it would be much easier
to follow the listing if we could
write GOSUB D I  (aabbrevia-
!ion for Draw Line). Alas, we
are not allowed to, so the next
best thing is to make sure that
all subroutines stand out well
on a listing by a REM statement
which brieﬂy describes their
function.
For example, the following
few lines are a guide to how a
'draw line' subroutine should
appear on a listing:
9999 R EM DRAW LINE SR
10000 PRINT" 
P
t
10010 RETURN
This is not expected to score
high marks for subtlety o r
invoke Dijstra's envy but it
serves to illustrate two points:
(a) T h e R EM statement is
given a 'one-less' line number.
(b) T h e ﬁrst effective line is a
nice round ﬁgure in thousands.
Neither o f  these points are
mandatory but they help to
keep a program looking tidy.
The reason for choosing an odd
number for the REM line is to
emphasise the fact that it is an
'outsider' (non executable) and
not the starting number for the
subroutine. The rule is never,
never GOSUB (or GOTO for
that matter) to a REM statement
because, to save memory, you
may eventually be tempted to
cut t h em  o u t  from your
working copy. If you call the
above with GOSUB 10000, the
REM can be removed at any
time without fear of risking an
error message f ro m  t h e
interpreter.
Still on the subject of line
numbers, it is a good plan to
number all subroutines in a
program starting at  round
thousands. For example, the
ﬁrst subroutine at line 10000,
the next at line 11000 and so on.
This will obviously leave masses
of unused line numbers in
between but who cares? The
program will be easier to follow
so, according to our deﬁnition,
it i s  a  worthwhile dodge
because it contributes to our
simpliﬁed d eﬁn it io n o f
structure.
Keyboard input
subroutine
Perhaps the most commonly
required subroutine is one
which validates keyboard
input. When string data is
requested from the keyboard
in response t o an INPUT
prompt it is possible that the
operator might hit RETURN
before the data is entered. The
input is therefore a 'null string'
which can be infuriating unless
some trap can be  laid t o
prevent it. There may also be a
limit o n  t h e  number o f
characters which c a n  b e
entered. To save writing these
traps every time an INPUT
statement appears, it can be
solved once and for all by
enclosing the lot, including the
INPUT statement, within a
subroutine. For example:
11111•111010
- M O P S
1E111919111
E O M ' S =
L R
D
BO TO
c
expensive —  a 1K magnetic
core memory would cost
around E1000. Consequently,
the foremost consideration for
the programmer was to ensure
that every precious byte
11999 REM INPUT VALIDATION SR
12000 KS='"': INPUT KS
12010 I F  KS=" THEN 12000
12020 I F  LEN(KS)

 THEN PRINT"TOO LONG":
GOTO 12000
12030 RETURN
Note t h a t  K $  h o ld s  t h e
keyboard response and that
the number o f  characters
allowed must be assigned to I
before calling. A typical calling
sequence would be:
Note that t h e number o f
characters has been limited to
18 (an arbitrary whim of the
programmer) a n d ,  o n
returning from the subroutine,
the general purpose variable,
KS, is re-assigned to NS.
It is conventional, but not
mandatory, t o  sh o ve a l l
subroutines down t o  t he
bottom of the program.
Subroutine material
In t h e  early days o f
computing, m em o ry w a s
earned its keep. As a direct
result, t he attitude towards
subroutine usage was much
different to what it is now. A
subroutine was used primarily
to a v o i d  r e p e t i t i o n
100 PRINT"ENTER NAME OF ORGANISM":L=18
110 GOSUB 12000
120 W K S
programming. Fla particular set
of lines was going to be used
several times i n  t h e same
program then it  was sound
economics to bundle them up
into the form of a subroutine
which c o u l d  b e  called
whenever needed.
Nowadays, the position is
different. Memory is relatively
cheap so saving it is not always
an overriding consideration.
The criterion for inclusion into
a subroutine is whether or not
the function it performs can be
recognised as a 'logical entity'.
Even if it is to be called only
once i n  t h e program t h e
function can still qualify for
subroutine status.
Our 'draw line' subroutine
above, although apparently
trivial, is certainly a candidate
for a subroutine. It is a logical
entity (has a clearly deﬁned
single function) a nd, i n
addition, will probably be
required several times during a
program RUN.
In fa c t, t h e  modern
'program is often a relatively
short, skimpy affair, consisting
of little more than a series of
subroutine calls. Using t h e
analogy w e  made a t  t h e
beginning, t h e  m a i n
contractor does very little,
preferring to sit on his/her
backside and farm out most of
the work to subcontractors.
Passing parameters
Some su b ro u t in es a r e

ME
complete in themselves and
require no information or help
whatsoever from the calling
program. T h e  ' draw  lin e'
subroutine provides such an
example. All we have to do is
call it and it prints out a string
characters to form a dashed
line.
But there may b e times
when we want to draw lines
using other characters. For
example, a  line o f  ' * '  o r
perhaps D o  we then use
another subroutine employing
a different character? W e
could, of course, but it would
be a  shocking waste o f
programming en erg y a n d
memory. The more efﬁcient
way would be to re-organise
the subroutine so that it can
draw a line using any character
we choose. This will entail
substituting t h e  l i t e r a l
character ' - '  with a  string
variable and using a FOR/NEX1
loop to print it out a number of
times.
For example:
9999 REM DRAW LINE
10000 FOR K 1  TO 20
10010 PRINT L$;
10020 NEXT
10030 RETURN
This will print out a row of
twenty characters, the actual
character being that which
happens to be in L$ at the time
the subroutine is called.
This requirement highlights
the problem o f  'parameter
passing' b e c a u s e  t h e
subroutine is n o  longer an
independent animal. We must
ensure that when we call it, the
character we intend to use is
assigned to the variable IS. In
technical jargon, we must pass
the character parameter. For
example, if the line is too be
drawn with ' * ' ,  the calling
procedure will now be:
100 L $ =
110 GOSUB 10000
Thus, in return for a little extra
complication 
i
n
 t h e
subroutine, w e  enjoy t h e
facility o f  using t h e same
subroutine for drawing a row
of any character we choose
and, w h at ' s m o r e ,  t h e
characters can b e  different
each time it is called. It is worth
mentioning here that instead
of assigning IS to the literal
character w e  could have
used the form:
1 100 LS = CHRS(x)
where X is the character code
— the code for '*' is CHRS(42).
It is possible to increase the
generality of  the subroutine
even more by arranging for the
end-of-loop counter in  line
10000 t o  b e  passed a s  a
parameter. For example
10000 FOR K 1  TO L
However, this means that two
parameters must n o w  b e
MAIN
PROGRAM
passed, one for the character
and another for the line length,
illustrating yet another law of
our friend (?) Septimius Sod —
the greater the ﬂexibility, the
greater the complication.
Before leaving the subject
of parameter passing, w e
should explain that the term is
often used in a more restricted
form. More advanced forms of
BASIC now offer a superior
kind of subroutine known as a
Procedure w h i c h  a l l o w s
parameters to be passed over
by the calling statement itself
instead of requiring a separate
line.
Furthermore, it is possible
to deﬁne certain variables used
within the procedure as 'local'
to distinguish them from the
'global' variety. These terms
need some explanation. When
a variable, say X.  within a
subroutine is declared to be
'local', it can be used freely
without fear o f  corrupting
important data it  may have
acquired o u t s i d e  t h e
boundaries of the subroutine.
In other words, the global
value of X is preserved even
though its local value may be
varied by the subroutine. For
example, if X = 4 before calling
and the subroutine alters it to
24, t h e 4  i s  automatically
restored t o  X  again after
RETURN. The facility to declare
1st LEVEL

some variables as local is a great
help to a programmer because
the choice of variable name
can be made without fear of
corrupting data if, by chance,
the same name was used for a
different purpose i n  other
areas of the program.
Unfortunately, C o m m o -
dore BASIC does not support
local variables but the above
discussion still has value, if only
to draw attention to the bugs
that can arise following an
incorrect choice of subroutine
variables.
Subroutine nesting
A subroutine can often call up
another subroutine which, in
turn, can call upon another and
so on. This technique, known
as nesting is illustrated in Figure
6.1
There is a  limit t o  the
number of subroutines which
can b e nested because the
interpreter has to store all the
return addresses in a reserved
and restricted area in RAMA
known as the stack. The stack is
organised as a LIFO memory,
(Last In First Out). Although the
BASIC programmer is blissfully
unaware of LIFO action, the
sudden appearance o f  t he
message 'OUT OF MEMORY'
can appear on the screen even
when there is plent of usable
3rd LEVEL
SR
RAM still left. This can also
happen i f  you commit the
cardinal sin of jumping out of a
subroutine before the normal
RETURN route. Each time we
cause a  subroutine t o  exit
prematurely, the stack is left
holding a return address which
means that t h e stack will
eventually overﬂow i f  the
subroutine is called many times
from within a loop. Providing
these dangers are avoided,
nesting provides a  useful
method of breaking down a
complex subroutine i n t o
various 'levels'. For example, a
subroutine which presents a
Menu page may call upon a
smaller ( l o w e r  l e v e l )
subroutine t o  d r a w  a
demarcation line between the
, =

P r o g r a m m i n g
V
heading a n d  t
the menu options. It may be
called a  s ec ond t i m e  t o
separate the bottom o f  the
menu from the typical prompt,
'Enter option required'.
The O N  G O S U B
statement
The mention of menu options
is a cue for introducing the ON
GOSUB s tatement. T h e
following example will serve to
illustrate the syntax:
ON S GOSUB 5000,6000,7000,
8000,9000
If S = 1, the subroutine at line
5000 is called, if  S = 2, the
subroutine at line 6000 is called
and if S = 5 it will call on the last
subroutine at line 9000. Those
who have dabbled in electrical
circuits will recognise this as
the software equivalent of the
single pole, multiway switch as
shown in Figure 6.2
Assuming a  s epar ate
subroutine is responsible for
handling eac h option, t h e
actual program can be reduced
to a simple affair. It need only
contain a few assignment lines
for setting the initial conditions
and presenting the menu —
the subroutines can be left to
do all the work. We could, of
course, go a stage further and
make the actual menu page the
subject of a subroutine.
User deﬁned functions
A 'function' is a term used
with a  variety of  meanings,
depending on both the context
in whic h and the academic
level of the text. For example,
in higher mathematics, even
the deﬁnition of a function is
usually good for twenty or so
pages of mind boggling text.
Provisionally, we will describe a
function as  something that
does something to something
else! For example, SIN(X) is a
function because it performs
that particular mathematical
operation on X. We input the
value of X to the SIN(X) 'black
box' and it  emerges with a
totally different value after it
has been messed around by the
function. SIN( X) , CO S( X) ,
TAN(X), EXP(X) a n d  a  f e w
others, are some of the oft-
used standard functions which
are available to us in BASIC.
There are hundreds of other

ENTER S
functions which could also
come under the heading of
'standard' b u t  f o r  obvious
reasons, BASIC can not supply
them all.
Apart f r o m  s t a n d a r d
functions, there will also be a
need for functions peculiar to
the needs  o f  a  particular
program. To satisfy such needs,
BASIC gives us the means of
writing our own functions bny
using the keyword DEE FN A
(X), where X (or indeed any
other legitimate character) is
the variable to be acted upon.
The full syntax is as follows:
DEF I N  name (X) =  some
equation containing X
For example, DEE EN G (X) =
X+5: the function name is G,
the variable is X  and t h e
equation is X+5.
A deﬁned function is, in
some respects, a  kind o f
miniature subroutine so  i t
shoucil follow that a  formal

A
method must exist for 'calling'
it. This is done by using FN(C),
where C is the actual value to
be used in the function, Al! this
sounds very confusing so an
example is indicated:
400 PRINT FIN G (3)
1
This would evaluate 2*3+3 3
and print out the result, 33. We
don't always want to print out
the function. For example, we
couild use EN as an ordinary
variable i n  par t o f  another
expression as in the following
example:
1
1
The following rule must be
observed:
The function must be deﬁned
before it is called, i.e. DEF EN
must come before FN.
Once a function has been
deﬁned, you can call on it as
many times as you wish within
the same program and use
different values of the variable
each time. The function can be
complex and contain other
functions such as:
DEF FN S (Z) = SIN(Z) + COS(Z)!
5 is the function name, Z is the
variable
DEF FN 0 4  (PF) =  LOG(PI)
EXP(PF)
D4 is the function name, PF is
the variable.
The equation can  contain
additional variables other than
the f u n ct io n n  v a r i a b l e
providing, of course, they have
been previously assigned. For
example:
DEE IN G (X) = X 2  + K
It is also allowable to use a
variable, instead of a constant,
when calling with EN providing
i
a value. For example:
510 F N  S (G)
We hav e suggested that a
deﬁned func tion c a n  b e
thought o f  as a  miniature
subroutine but it is time we
pointed out the differences
between them.
1. A  subroutine can occupy as
many lines required. A deﬁned
1 
3
1 function can occupy only one
100 DEF IN G (X) = 2*X+X
computer line.
Some time later in the program 2. A  subroutine can contain
we might want to evaluate this strings or numeric variables, A
equation and print out the deﬁned func tion c an o n ly
result when X = 3. This can be handle n u m e r i c s  ,  i n
achieved by the following line: Commodore BASIC.
3. I t  doesn't matter where a
subroutine is situated because
it can be called from an earlier
or later  lin e  number. T he
function, on the other hand,
must be deﬁned by DEF EN
before it can be called with FN.
4, Unlik e subroutines, a
deﬁned function passes a
parameter directly by the FN
call instead o f  requiring a
separate assignment line.
The main use of a deﬁned
function is to avoid writing out
lengthy equations each time
they are required.

Software have just answered this question
by writing three marvellous new 'software
development' packages. I  kn o w ,
those two words strike fear into the heart
of most home computer users. But you
can relax, these packages are friendly,
easy to use and require only a CBM 64 (not
a SAGE IV)  t o  produce professional
quality, "stand alone" computer games.
They differ from games designers in that
not only do they produce programs that
run without the Lightning software in
residence i n  yo u r, o r  anybody's,
computer, but they don't override the
existing functions of the resident BASIC.
(Such as they are...0ops!)
Basic Lightning
The ﬁrst of the three is Basic Lightning, an
extended, multi-tasking BASIC with a
penchant f o r arcade games, Basic
Lightning i s what you might call a
Structured BASIC, this means i t  has
commands in common with other such
BASIC's, like BBC BASIC and Sinclair QL
SuperBASIC; IF-THEN-ELSE, REPEAT-
UNTIL, CASE, PROCedures, and so on. It
also has some natty routines of its own like
DLOAD and DSAVE for LOAD/SAVE
from/to disc — a triﬂe easier to type than
LOAD "whatever", 8, 1, and coming a lot
easier t o recent converts t o the 64's
obvious charms. DIR is another nice
touch t o  Basic Lightning, listing the
directory of the disc in the drive (no more
hunting). It  also has commands like
WHILE-WEND and CIR-CELSE-CEND, the
former being a looping type function like
IF-THEN and the latter being a 'multiple
line' equivalent. DISABLE nukes the
RUN-STOP key so some snooper can't
break into your program and read it; a
handy piece of built-in protection if ever I
typed one! Another Basic Lightning plus,
is 'windowing' where you can throw a
smaller, inset, piece of graphics screen
into a screen of text, or indeed onto
another graphic, like a sprite, for instance.
In case you didn't know, this is quite
useful because the 64 can't usually display
text and hi-res graphics on the same
screen; it's normally rather like the hi-res
screen is pulled down over the text
screen.
SO 
I
 tell you what, the one thing that
always really gets my goat about CBM
BASIC, is having t o remember those
POKEs for background and foreground
colours in the display ﬁle. Basic Lightning
LIGHTNit
STRIKES THRICE
skirts this issue nicely with the commands
TBORDER, HBORDER, HPAPER,
HINK, etc. The 'T' preﬁx specifying a text
colour and the 'H' a hi-res colour. What
about colour numbers, you know, 0-15
and all that? Try BLACK, BROWN or RED.
as they are the replacements in Basic
Lightning. You can also shufﬂe the
attributes around e n  their own i n
rectangular blocks, using the MOVATT or
SWAPATT commands. In any arcade-style
game, collision detection is a must. What's
that then? That is when an alien sits
around long enough to bump into one of
your bullets; the alien is detecting the
collision and signalling the appropriate
action, in this case, erasing the alien and
printing up an explosion. BA-BOOM!
Heh-heh. Basic Lightning collision
detection, w it h  t h e  DTCTON and
DTCTOFF commands. Essentially, ( I
nearly said basically) Basic Lightning is a
kind of testbed program. It starts you off
before you use the other two in the series,
so you can run your program in extended
BASIC using t h e pre-formed sprite
cobbling routines, and then translate it
into one of the other two, and sell it as
super fast machine code.
White Lightning
White Lightning is an implementation of
the language FORTH. I n  t he 1960's
Charles H. Moore, an astronomer at the
Kitt Peak Observatory in the USA, needed
a specialist Input/Output computer
language f o r  cont rolling Rad io
Telescopes. So, being no slouch at the
•
=

computer keyboard he sat down and
hacked out his very own language, which
he called FORTH.
White Lightning is  a n accurate
rendering of FORTH-79, which was until
last month the most recent version. It uses
pre-deﬁned words like IF-ELSE, DO-
UNTIL, DO-LOOP, etc., but its real
strength, and the source of all the fuss is in
its deﬁnable words, an inﬁnite number of
them because they designed by you. This
is done by 'colon deﬁnitions' in the
following format:-
: new word old word old word 2...etc...last
word ;
deﬁning new words in terms of existing
words on the 'word list', the stack of
words supplied with the  FORTH
language. This all means that FORTH
grows with your application, becoming
tailored to the individual needs of the job-
in-hand and becoming an expert On
whatever your task is. The speed of
execution of a FORTH program is close to
that of machine code, but its word
structure is as easy to learn as BASIC.
Apart from anything else though, the
way you have to program in FORTH forces
you into good programming habits...or
your programs don't work. Its style is a bit
like structured BASIC in the way you write
a main routine and use that to control a lot
of smaller routines to do the job. FORTH
programs are unlike BASIC in another,
too. BASIC, including Basic Lightning, is
an 'interpreted' language; this means that
the programs are a 'source' code which is
read by  a  chip called the BASIC
interpreter and directly executed. What
happens to FORTH source code is that it is
'compiled' into a series of chunks of
machine code, and executed when the
user types in one of the new deﬁned
words i n  the source code. White
Lightning source code is entered into the
computer, like a text ﬁle, onto screens or
pages within memory, which the
compiler then reads starting at the ﬁrst
page.
As a supplement to the package, Oasis
have included a copy of Basic Lightning
and a thing called IDEAL,a sprite handling
expert sub-language. IDEAL deals with
sprite juggling, stretching and positioning
on the screen; it also has a lot to do with
important things like collision detection
etc. White Lightning can create 'stand
alone' programs that you can sell without
restriction (I should think so too!). All
Oasis want out of the deal is a small
mention on the packaging of your game.
Not a lot to ask if you're earning as much
as Jeff Minter, Matthew Smith et al.
Machine Lightning
Lastly, there is Machine Lightning. The
most difﬁcult of the three but, by the Phil
South Inverse Difﬁculty Theorum,
proportionally more powerful than the
other two. It is a full function 6502

again, IDEAL a nd a  gaggle o f
sprite/graphics added t o  make i t
interesting. I  won't bother to try to
explain machine code here, (A.P. & D.J.
Stephenson get paid to do that) but
sufﬁce to say it's not for beginners. It's
highly recommended that before you
tackle Machine Lightning you buy Basic
Lightning, then graduate t o  White
Lightning. Use them and then buy a book
with a title something like, 6502 Machine
code for the absolute screaming novice or
similar, read it, and then dive into the
wonders of Machine Lightning. Agreed,
Machine Lightning is one of the most
user-friendly assemblers about, but you
still have to know your IDA from your STA
in order to make a noisy standing-on-it's-
own-two-legs arcade game. For more
experienced programmers, though,
Machine Lightning constitutes the most
complete software development package
on this machine. It is 'a joy to use' (I hate
that phrase, but it's true) and it is a slick,
all-in-one masterpiece.
The things that are common to all the
packages is their handling of sound.
multi-tasking and windows. Multi-
tasking, besides being an impressive piece
of jargon, is like time-sharing used to be
on the DEC System 10's and other
mainframes. Several functions can be
controlled all at once, foreground and
background, each one operation for a
mere 1/20th of a second at a time, inching
along. If you've got 7 things happening at
once, thats only 7/20th sec. to perform
one step, 2
steps every second. Tasks can be assigned
priority and even halted while other
functions take over. Control of sounds
and music is made much easier too, with
parameters governing volume,
frequency, attack, decay, sustain, release,
waveform, ﬁltering, ring modulation and
the 'voices', the three channels.
In summing up, I have really enjoyed
these packages. All three make full use of
the machine's functions, enabling even a
complete beginner to produce aliens,
sound effects and music with style and
speed. The arcade sprite library for
example is choc-a-block with handy
sprites to start you off. All the frogs, bug-
eyed monsters, robots, tanks, ﬂying
saucers you could ever need are ﬁled
away on the cassette or disc for you louse
in your own programs. The goals of the
programmers were 1) that the programs
be powerful, and 2) that they be easy to
use. They are both of these things and
more, and I think the lads at Oasis deserve
a slap on the back and all the fame and
fortune I feel sure they're going to get. I
love the programs and will use them
forever, but above all I must praise the
documentation. They are the most
readable and wel; set out manuals I have
had the pleasure to review. There, I've
said it; bees knees or what? Right, off you
go. and the ﬁrst person to come out with a

I AM VERY TEMPTED To GIVE
this game full marks for quality.
The numerous screens (22) of
play in  this game are easily
accessible thr oughout, b y
pressing F3 any start screen can
be selected from the easiest to
the hardest. The graphics in the
game are verging on being very
good with t he inclusion o f
sprites for the main character
and some of his adversaries.
The main idea of this game
is to guide your robot through
the 22 screens, whilst avoiding
the a l i e n  ﬁr e b a lls  a n d
collecting the power pills. The
catch here is that if you do not
collect all the pills then you
cannot escape the screen to a
higher level, and on some of
the screens your robot has to
complete it in a special routine.
Now if by chance you are a
clever little R202, then the
second part of  this software
package will interest you even
more. Usually, if you ﬁnish a
game, that's it — not so with
Mr. Robot. With this game you
can actually create your own
levels and save them for a game
later.
Using t h e  joystick, y ou
select various items such as
moving walkways and bombs
which, when you walk over
them, they light, thus giving
you a limited amount of time to
get out of their way. Once a

sure that it is feasible. Finally, as

to the educational content of
the program. Choosing t h e
options in the progrrn has been
made easy by the inclusion of
an overlay which ﬁts neatly
over the function keys.
The progrm is beautifully
illustrated and follows the high
standard set in Caesar's Cat;
Caesar really looks as if he is
climbing a wall or jumping over
a fence. Another aspect of this
program is it's use of sound.
You actually hear footsteps
chasing him, you hear his
pitiful mewing as you see him
trying to swim out of a lake and
you hear the screech of brakes
and the thud as he tries to run

IF YO U' RE A  BUDDING
Doctor Who type, who thinks
he might enjoy travelling about
in time and space, then this
latest text/graphic adventure
from Audiogenic may appeal
to you.
You're cast as a lone space
traveller who is woken up (I
don't know by whom) during a
space journey from somewhere
to somewhere else„ and given
the mission to save all time and
space from the evil Graf Von
Schwarzherzen, the baddy of
the adventure.
By using 'latest technology'
you must fully explore the craft
and then teleport to and fro in
time to recover...but then I'd
be telling you the plot; sufﬁce
to say, it's another adventure
where you have t o  collect
certain things in order to save
everybody from certain death.
The graphic part o f  the
game is a  very small win-
speeded up, slowed down, made to jump
and ﬁre bullets upwards and forwards.
Starting off in the year 2525 (a great song
that years ago if I remember rightly) you
have to travel through the battles of time
giving assistance in shooting down the
various types of ﬂying machines and
creatures f ro m  bi-planes through
helicopters and satellites to pterodactyls.
On the ground you have to watch out for
the pits in the terrain as well as blast the
dow i n  t h e centre of  the
screen. T h e  graphics are
adequate while the sound is so
minimal t o  b e almost non-
existent, except for an irritating
little tune which plays every
time you do something clever.
The text panel i s  directly
underneath and is qUite well
done, being a teleprinter type
simulation, complete with
sprocket tracks. T h e only
drawback to this set-up is that
on more than one occasion I
was able to type quicker than
the program could, which
meant several attempts a t
typing a  command due t o
missed letters.
The standard verb-noun
format is taken and all words
can b e  shortened t o  four
letters. This is quite useful.
Somebody really should tell
the people a t  Audiogenic
about fast loaders: the tape
took over sixteen minutes to
load. There was, also, no save

the enemy soldiers. To move from one
period of time to another, you must
complete a ten mile journey to reach the

period although a  continuous game

left off. Get off and do your bit for
mankind in this highly frustrating arcade
game.

ﬁnally got on to the next set of

very infuriating and very soon it
becomes repetitive and boring.

type that the average 'shoot-

out and buy but it does contain
a good humour element which

compo-bashers as well as to the
adult would-be cowboys. A

fun is when Cliff Hanger knock

simply press the ﬁre button. If you are de-

moves in the direction of the ball but the
ﬁre button initiates a dive. Free kicks, cor-

here in a game that gets more realistic and
fun to play the more skillful you become.
Just so that you know all is not fair in love
and war, the player with the ball tends to
be a bit of a slow coach except when he's

you type everything in full, usually ever

I DON'T USUALLY LIKE PLATFORM AND
ladder games much, probably because
I'm not very good at playing them, or vice
versa. Because of this the program was
double tested by an independent panel of
dedicated players aged 9 to 14.
As a variation on most other games of
this type the ladders are dispensed with
and in their absence you are provided
with a jet pack which is activated by
pressing the ﬁre button.
I found this preferable to the usual
method of ﬁre +stick to jump.
You are in a space garage, so the story
goes, and must collect randomly placed
fuel pods from one side, before returning
to re-fuel a randomly placed space ship on
the other. Just to make things interesting
there are strange bouncing objects in the
way (aren't there always?). You lose one of
your three lives if you touch these or the
edges of  the platforms which are, of
course 'live'. You also have a limited
supply of oxygen, indicated by a gauge at
the top of the screen.
With on screen scoring, ﬁve levels of
increasing difﬁculty (you may start on any
level), a high score table and excellent
graphics and sound, the game is better
than many others of it's kind.
The general consensus o f  opinion
from the panel was: difﬁcult but great fun.

FOUND THIS A DIFFICULT PROGRAM
to review. Upon loading, m y ﬁrst
impressions were of a game with only
adequate sound (which, reminded me of
a TV commercial for cigars, very soothing)
and graphics which are, to be fair, less
than adventurous. You may by now be
wondering how come I gave it four stars.
Well things are not always as they seem
and after playing for half an hour or so it
dawned on me that not only was I having
fun but that the game is really quite
complex.
To set the scene: you pilot a robot craft
around the edge of a scientiﬁc research
centre within which roams a string of
subatomic particles. By pressing the ﬁre
button your craft can be driven into the
centre, leaving a green trail as it goes. By
then driving to any side, the area enclosed
by the trai will ﬁll with colour, the object
of the game being to trap the particles
within the coloured area and so destroy
ship an d  indeed keeping
yourself out of galactic prison
when ﬁnes are imposed on you
and the cash has run out! The
idea of this game is to destroy
the alien robot factory which is
stationed somewhere in the
Mhiyken system of planets.
Once the game is loaded,
you are given a certain amount
of money with which you buy
fuel. To gain more funds you
have to leave the safety of the
fuel station or the intergalactic
hyper-market and tackle some
graphic blocks to display the
title page. I must admit that at
that point I was a little sceptical
of the rest of the program, but
when I  entered t he actual
game it soon redeemed itself.
The basic idea with Jump
Challenge is to jump as many
cars a s possible without
crashing yo u r motorbike.
Sounds easy enough, but when
you play it , i t  is a  totally
different story altogether.
When attempting a jump you
have to gain the correct speed
of the nasties waiting for you
outside. When you shoot an
alien a bounty is paid and if you
survive to enter the atmosphere
the counsel of that planet will
pay you. If you have committed
an offence they will ask for
payment themselves. Not only
can you do the above but since
there has been a  little light
colonisation yo u  can  also
transport t h e  occasional
traveller to another planet. This
will, again, enable you to raise
the money for fuel. I think the
and position o n  your bike.
Failing to do that will lead to
the inevitable crash in which
we witness Eddie Kid bouncing
along the ground! I must point
out that the review copy did
not contain t h e  "jumping
barrels on a bicycle" section so
I shall just concentrate on the
motorbike section. To control
your motorbike you use either
the keys or a joystick; changing
gears has been put on the
function keys and the brakes
are on the space bar.
therm Two things hamper your effors. The
ﬁrst is that if the particles touch your trail
before you complete a move then you
lose a life. Secondly, at higher levels there
are small shining things called chasers
travelling along your trail whose touch is
fatal.
The 'robot craft' is in reality a small
diamond shaped object, the 'research
centre' a blank rectangle and the 'atomic
particles' look like a string of small beads.
However, I  found the game to be so
engrossing that the lack of fancy graphics
did not detract from the pleasure of
playing it.
Your score and remaining lives (you
start with three and gain an extra one on
completion o f  levels 3,6 and 9)  are
displayed along the top of the screen.
Down the side is a gauge which indicates
the percentage of screen ﬁlled.
In later screens t h e number o f
particles and chasers increase as does
their speed. At ﬁrst glance similar to STI X
from SUPERSOFT, FRENZY for my money
is the better game, simple in concept yet
addictive and deﬁnitely value for money.
0.).T
best way to describe this game
is a s  a  monetory arcade
adventure. The graphics on this
program are not of exceptional
quality but when you compare
the siz e o f  t h e  program
something had to be cut down.
The quality of the sound on this
package is, again, lacking in
that all important 'zip'. If all
things a r e  t a k e n  i n t o
consideration ab o u t  t h is
program it is quite good, but
for me at least the graphics let
the side down.
One point I found amusing
during playing the game was
that when you crashed, and
after Eddie had hobbled off the
screen, it displayed a message
asking whether you enjoyed
hospital food! I found that after
crashing several times and
being asked the above, I was
dying for the screen to clear so
that I could try again. You can
actually h a v e  so m e f u n

original but childish — somewhat like a
hurdy-gurdy.

guess that t h e  program is
written in BASIC and compiled.
Not that I have anything against
BASIC, but the length of the
main pr ogr am limit s  t h e
amount of RAM available for
source codes to 15K. More of
that later.
The package is essentially
an assembler, disassembler and
simple monitor. Your source
code is created with the aid of a
ﬁle manipulation routine. The
code is entered as numbered
lines similar to those used in
BASIC. The assembler uses two
passes and therefore allows
you to use labels for loops and
memory locations. The usual
pseudo op-codes for tables and
specifying assembly location
are supported. T h e  source
code can be saved and loaded
from storage at any time. The
assembler has  t h e  us ual
facilities allow ing s y mbol

However, each screen is basically the

Jack can move up and down the screen
by way of the lifts. If he stands over a lift
gap, he is killed, but with the aid of his
boots, h e  can overshoot these gaps
without falling into them. Maybe the
game could have been more exciting if he
couldn't transverse the gaps at all. He can
also travel o n  conveyor belts  and

is a trace facility which enables

The only ﬂy in the ointment is
that the trace scrolls the screen

On the whole this is a very
handy package which is easy to
use. The limitation of size and
source could be a problem,
especially since linked ﬁles are
not supported. For this reason
and the relatively slow execu-
tion (compared t o  machine

isn't really suited to the serious
programmer. For the beginner
and enthusiast, it's unbeatable.

duck under these by pressing the joystick

At skill levels 1 to 5 you encounter the
bugs and gremlins previously mentioned,
hanging from the vault's roof. There are
various types of bugs and gremlins but
many can be disposed of by travelling
above their heads and bouncing up and
down on them.
I r ather  lik ed t h e  graphic Jack,
especially the way he shrugs his shoulders
to duck under the rock formations. The
remaining display did not impress me very
much and showed very little imagination.
As this game is supposed to represent
someone's trip around a record pressing
plant, it would have been nice to have had
some music of sorts in the background.
After a short while, the game became
boring and very repetetive.
Possibly this game is geared to the
younger end of the market and it should
do quite well there. But I don't think this
will be a best seller, Others may ﬁnd it
enthralling and addictive.

WHAT A  BIG YEAR IT'S BEEN FOR
young Tony Crowther, author of such
favourites as Wagger, Killer Watt, Loco
and more recently from his new software
house —  Gremlin Graphics, Percy the
Potty Pigeon and Monty Mole. Tony, is
just one of the games authors improving
the standard of British software with each
release and his latest, Suicide Express, is
no exception.
As we have come to expect by now
from Tony, the graphics were excellent
and a rollicking soundtrack by Sky played
throughout the game also. The game itself
is quite reminiscent of the arcade classic
Super Locomotive and more especially
one o f  his afore mentioned releases,
Loco.
As soon as the game was loaded, a
voice greeted me saying, "Welcome to
Suicide Express", which acted not only as
a bit of a surprise but also as a further
THIS IS AN EDUCATIONAL GAME WITH
the main aim of teaching time skills. In it
you take the role of a lorry driver going
round farms collecting produce and
delivering to a central depot. You have
the choice to be one of three levels of
truck driver and to go round one of three
courses. Each choice of driving level gives
a different game and the route maps give
the difﬁculty factor; thus, there are nine
possible games. The three routes are a
map which is printed in the book, a secret
map with random road blocks.
The three games all involve picking up
the fruit and vegetables from various
excitement tonic for things to come. I had
read from the inlay card that it was my job
to drive the Suicide Express as android
SCIH-PARG and t o  "clear the planet
N ilmerg of all alien life and threatening
dangers in order to make it ﬁt for human
habitation." So with that I pressed the ﬁre
button of my joystick and the voice said,
"Get ready....Gol" I was off and straight
away I could tell this game was going to be
great.
The screen splits in two with a side on
view of the train in the top half and a plan
view of the tracks, your train and the
nasties in the other. The super smooth
'wrap-around' scrolling graphics give a
real feeling of speed as the Suicide Express
hurtles down the tracks pursued by jet
bomber aeroplanes and a hovercraft with
other trains heading straight for it too.
You have to be really quick on the ﬁre
button if you want to survive this game!
However don't think  y ou jus t blast
everything in sight with a never ending
stream of bullets; they have to be col-
lected on your journey from ammo dumps
at the side of the track. To add insult to
injury don't think you can collect and
hoard your ammo either because, if you
farms on the maps and watching the
clock. In 'Trainee Trucker' you have to log
your time at the various farms; this is done
by converting the time on the analogue
clock shown and putting it onto the digital
display. Once this is done you can collect
your order and deliver it to the depot. In
'Trucker' you must still collect the farm
produce but instead of logging in you
have to watch the time display as the farms
open only at certain times and you are
working in two hourly sessions. 'Truckers'
is similar but the farms are open for only
ﬁfteen minutes each. Each of the games is
great fun and, with the added difﬁculty
levels, can be fast and furious.
The graphics and sound were of a high
standard and 'Novaload' meant there was
no long waiting for the game to load.
Overall a good program which at it's
higher levels beneﬁtted from playing with
a partner.
collect more than 50 pieces of ammo, you
explode anyway!
The driver o f  the Suicide Express
certainly gets a raw deal but, as the old
saying goes, "You can't have your cake
and eat it . "  O ther  dangers include
scavengers and watchers. It all seems very
one sided but do not despair! Unlike Loco
you can control the speed of the Suicide
Express w hic h, although may be a
seemingly minor point at ﬁrst, can be a
real bonus once you realise its potential in
order to get the really high scores, a task
made not too difﬁcult as there are loads of
points t o  be gained via the generous
scoring system (you get 1000 points when
you ﬁrst start off as well as getting a further
1000 points each time you die).
After giving the game your best shot
and ﬁnally losing your 3 lives, the voice
reads out your score.
With 14 levels of play and 32 screens
this game is certainly not for the faint
hearted. However, the excellent scrolling
graphics and the fabulous soundtrack
make this game horribly addictive and yet
another Crowther commodore classic.
Dare you travel the tracks alone? R.B.O.

AT FIRST GLANCE THIS APPEARED TO SE
a game based on that old TV children's
favourite, Hectors House. The screen
display on the insert card seemed to point
to this until I spotted the note "starring
Little Henry", with a Royal crown above it.
then realised after reading further that
this is a game depicting Little Henry's
Royal Romp through the rooms of his new
home. W h i l s t  t h e  pac k aging i s
unimpressive, I  f ound t h e  software
enthralling.
The title display appears on screen to
the tune of 'Rule Brittannia', after which
you are treated to a brief demonstration
of the 8 screens of the game.
You are Little Henry and have 3 lives to
negotiate the game with, If however you
lose all your lives, you may commence
your next game from the screen you were
last on instead of being returned to screen
one. This is a superb feature and dare I say
"Hooray for Henry".
Henry has come a long way since birth
because for one so young he appears to
be able t o walk quite happily and is
clothed extremely well.
Henry goes to screen 1, which is the
clothes cupboard. Here he must collect
gloves, boots, money bags etc and avoid
the batty buttons and stomping boots.
When all is collected (including the key to
the exit door). Henry must make his way
to the exit. Upon reaching this point, the
screen clears and a display o f  Henry
crossing a corridor from room to room is
given which is quite delightful.
Room 2 is the bathroom, but Henry is
not here just for the Royal Wee. Collect
rubber ducks, soap brushes etc, avoid
touching the sponge and bath taps and
watch out especially for the dripping tap.
If Henry pulls the plug at the top right of
the screen, then the bath empties of water
revealing further goods for our Royal
Magpie to collect.
The kitchen can be a dangerous place
for a youngster and this is so in screen 3.
Don't get hit by the falling eggs, pop-up
toast (with good sound affects) and falling
tin can, but collect all the triﬂes, biscuits,
cakes etc and avoid the hot tea pouring
randomly from the teapot. Get to the
door and exit to screen 4, the Lounge.
Again, objects must be collected, but
watch out for the parrot escaping from his
cage and ﬂying around the room. Don't
let him get you. I'll not give away any clues
at this stage, but a sequence of collections
must be set up. In the lounge is a cuckoo
clock (complete with noisy cuckoo), a
television set on the blink and a raging ﬁre
(where did they get their coal from).
And so to Henry's Playroom — screen
5. E a c h  s c r e e n  h a s  d i f f e r e n t
accompanying noises and this one is
packed by  a  clockwork whirring. The
ﬂoating • 'Teddy' bear s  (s orry ) a
resemblance to Nookie Bear, but must be
avoided at all costs. Collect the toys and
parcels, jump into the aeroplane and then
parachute down amongst the other toys
(maybe Henry wants to be an SAS Soldier
when h e  grows up), b u t  don't get
clobbered by Mr lack-in-a-box.
Next is the nursery. Negotiate the
obstacles for the collection of dummies,
sums etc. Each item collected extends a
ladder up to a shelf for you to collect items
from that shelf.
Dinner is called on screen 7 in the
dining r oom where goodies such as
bananas, hamburgers and other eatables
etc can be found. The 2 mad chefs can be
nasty if you get in their way, so be careful.
Negotiate t he cooked turkey o n  the
dining table.
The hardest screen, of course, is last,
Henry's Creepy Dungeon, complete with
Witch (could it be an Aunty in disguise)
and ghosts. The parrot appears again (in
fact it could be a vampire), but this time it
homes in on you (homing parrot?). Show
him the sign of the cruciﬁx to scare him
off. Complete the round tour of the house
and you end up back in the Clothes
Cupboard at screen 1.
This game is very close to being a
graphic adventure. Each screen is totally
different from the others, which makes it
a joy to play. There are a lot of surprises in
store amongst t h e  excellent graphic
representation. In fact, it is close to being
a cartoon o f  sorts. The link  between
screens is excellent. It will be a long time
before I fall out with this game. I could
play it time after time without becoming
bored.
This game should appeal to all ages
and I think prove to be excellent value for
money. I t  is  w ell thought o u t  and
different.

MANY COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS
are not entirely familiar with what BASIC
will do, let alone machine code. They
might very well have an idea for a new
knockout game but lack the ability put it
into practice. Even if the game could be
coded in BASIC, it would be too slow to
be worth considering.
There hav e been several games
designers for the Sinclair Spectrum and
the trend seems to be continuing for the
Commodore machines.
A games creator should provide the
user with a number of machine code
routines that will ﬁrst allow him to 'build'
his game in simple, easy steps. It also
provides him with an operating system to
combine these various modules into a
working game: the user simply describes
what he wants and the program does the
rest.
I have assessed ﬁve games designers —
four for the CBM 64 and one for the VIC
20. One of these is an "odd-man-out' so I
shall look at this ﬁrst.
Scope 64 ISP
07.95 (cassette)
CBM 64
•
Although Scope 64 calls itself 'The Games
Designer', it is not for those who are
unfamiliar w i t h  w r it ing t h e ir  o w n
programs. It does not actually help you
design games b u t  is  a n  extension
language t h a t  giv es  y o u  4 6  ex tra
commands w hic h gr eatly  assist i n
producing a program that will handle
graphics, sound and animation at a higher
speed than ordinary BASIC.
Using thes e n e w  commands, a
program or  subroutine is written in a
series o f  REM statements. I t  is  then
compiled by the Scope master program
and re-written into another speciﬁed area
of memory. It may then be called via a SYS
command (like a machine code routine —
which it  resembles) from your BASIC
program.
In effect, it  enables y ou t o  write
machine code subroutines, but it does not
help you design a program: you must
already know how to build up a sprite or
deﬁne the path your player will take when
he jumps... If you know how, Scope 64 will
make it easier and faster.
Complete programs could be wAtten
in Scope alone but I suspect most users
would use it for handling subroutines that
need a greater speed than BASIC can
provide. Only single statement lines are
permitted, so programs tend to get a bit
lengthy quite quickly! The documenta-
tion is well sprinkled with examples and,
at 07.95, it is well worth considering if
your programming ability is ready for it.
Once compiled, a  Scope routine is
independent of the master program and
may be used in your programs.

quite happily work with the other.
Adventure Writer comes complete
with a working adventure ready to load or

though you will have to load Magician and
not Sorcerer as stated in the instruction
booklet!
These programs will help you produce

I shall offer one word of warning
though: adventures are, by nature, often
complex in structure. Do make sure you
have yours clearly set out on paper.
Of t h e  t w o  ins truc tion book s ,
Adventure Writer is the best. Both give
you a worked example to key in but
Adventure Writer gives a key by key
account that is slightly more helpful.
On loading the program, you will be
presented with the main menu. From

The programs use the 'business mode
character set' (upper and lower case) plus
the graphics symbols shown on the left of
each k e y  —  accessible v i a  t h e
Commodore Shift key. Although you may
be a bit daunted by the lack of the other
graphics characters at ﬁrst sight, it  is
possible to produce suitable pictures to
accompany your text.
Once you've typed in your locations,
you then move on to the Movement
Table, O bjec t Descriptions, O bjec t
Starting Locations, Messages, Vocabulary,

documented. You can even check how
much memory you have left to play with.
While typing in text (graphics), all

and you get an I/O error, this may inhibit
you when saving your database — to disc
but not to tape (always have a spare
cassette handy).
The only criticism I have of the progrm
is that you cannot overwrite (on disc) a
database with the same name. This means
that, if you are writing a large program
you m a y  h a v e  d is c  management
problems.
Both programs do what they set out to
do and it is surprising what different types
of 'adventure' may be created with the
same basic tool. Neither company limits
the use of any program you write, but they
do ask that you mention their company
name somewhere within the program. If
the adventure is good enough, they will
even sell it for you.
The Games Designer
Artiﬁcial Intelligence Products
VIC 20
The VIC 20 in  it's unexpanded form
(without extra RAM packs) has been sold
in it's hundreds of thousands and sadly
does not always get the attention it's users
might w is h. Ar tiﬁc ial Intelligenc e
Products (AIP) have produced a very
clever games designer package that needs
no extra money.
The cassette includes three games for
you to play and/or edit. The games are
simple but reasonably effective and in
themselves will prove a fair amount of
fun. Using the editing facilities i t  is
possible to either build up a game from
scratch or alter the existing games to your
choice.
AIP claim that in using their methods
of games creations, y ou will gel the
equivalent of 19K within the 3.5K VIC
memory. This is achieved by loading the
editing programs one a t  a  time —
performing o n e  oper ation ( o r  a n
associated series) and then storing the
results by POKE the data to an isolated
block of memory.
Having ﬁnished one aspect of editing,
the next editing program is loaded — this
does not disturb the data in memory but
of c ours e overwrites t h e  previous
program and effectively uses the same
program area again and again...whilst
building up a steadily increasing database
for your game.
Having created y our database you
ﬁnally load the 'Main Game Base' in order
to play the game. This program provides
the operating system that uses your stored
database.
Each game has the same basic pattern
— you have to guide your 'player' from
HOME t o  TARGET, avoiding various
moving objects along the way...and then
return. Each t ime y ou reach either
location you score points and the speed of
the moving objects increases!
Although this  format may appear
restrictive, it is surprising what variations
you can build into such a simple scenario.
The editing sections consist o f :
Graphics Editor, Screen Editor, Tune
Editor, So u n d  G ener ator , G ame
Formulator and Game Saver.
The Graphics Editor allows you to
redesign 30 characters (each 8 x 8 pixels)
from which you design your game. Four
of these are used to create your 'player' —
a different shape for the four possible
directions o f  trav el. T h e  'Aliens ',
opponents, call them what you will (!) are
larger, being made up of a block of four
characters; you may design two versions
— left and right handed.
Two characters ar e speciﬁed f o r
HOME and TARGET and the other 16
make up your scenery. A simple to use,
expanded design panel is displayed as
well as the 30 characters.
The Screen Editor enables y ou t o
design the screen display, including the
position o f  t h e  aliens, HO ME and
TARGET. Meanwhile a scrolling reminder
of what each deﬁned character looks like
appears along the top of the screen. Each
character placed on the screen may be
one of eight colours.
The Tune Editor allows the creation
of a theme tune of up to 50 notes covering
two octaves (with sharps!). You may listen

to your tune at any time as you create it
and it is easy to change any individual
note. The Sound Generator provides
three additional s ound effects f o r
collisions a n d  reaching H O ME and
TARGET.
The Game Formulator deﬁnes the
speed of the game, what keys will be used
(if not using a joystick), points scored and
also the contents of a scrolling message
across the bottom of the playing screen.
Game Saver, does just that — saves
your game database to tape for future
playing or editing.
Overall, considering t h e  memory
limitations of the VIC, this game creator
gives you several interesting possibilities
to ex plor e. Although t h e  mov ing
characters do not alter as they move, the
scrolling is smooth and effective.
The games may only be played using
the 'Main Game Base' so it is not possible
to create a game independent of the
'Games Designer'. There can be no proﬁt
from this package but at least you can get
a lot of fun from only 3500 odd bytes!
Games Creator
Mirrorsoft
£12.95 (cassette)
CBM 64
This program comes on either disc or
cassette, the latter using one of the now
common rapid load systems— loads in 3
mins. It provides the user with the 'master
creator' (redesigner/editor) program that
already has  o n e  example game i n
memory. This you may either play or edit;
the databases for two further games are
on the reverse side of the cassette.
The games supplied are on the 'Manic
Miner', 'Scramble' and 'maze with nasties'
types and provide reasonable games with
good graphics.
The editing/creating facilities are very
good, are menu driven and are generally
easy t o operate. U p to ﬁve animated
'aliens' are allowed, each with four stages
of animation. The 'player' has eight stages
— two in each of four directions. Also
catered for are player/alien bullets and
player/alien explosions.
All sprites are created in a block of four
characters (16 x  1 6 pixels) and are
multicoloured (four colours). The sprite
editor is very easy to use and sprites are
shown in both full size and also enlarged
in the editing display panel.
The background scenery editor is very
versatile. Three basic types of scenery are
available: those that, 1) the 'player' may
pass through 2) the 'player' may walk on
or be stopped by 3) will kill the 'player' on
contact. 49 different graphics blocks may
be created for each of these three types,
allowing a complex background to be
built up relatively easily. The background
can remain stationary or may be scrolled
from right to left either slowly or quickly
(for scramble type games).
The tune to be played throughout
the game repeats itself but the main
theme can be quite long and one of ﬁve
instruments may be selected to play it. In
choosing to write this theme tune you do
nor have the facility to view or correct a
tune already written but have to start from
scratch. O nc e writing the notes ( no
sharps) you may 'play' it at any time and if
necessary delete notes from the visible
'page' —  but n o  further back (seven
'pages' of music may be written). The
music produced can be very good but you
must get it right the ﬁrst time...or start
again from the beginning of the tune!
Sound effects f o r  'player' dying,
shooting 'aliens' etc are catered for and
may be editid. Again this is  easy to
implement but the variations possible are
not all that great.
'Alien' mov ement m a y  b e  v ery
complex — up to 200 deﬁned steps being
allowed. Speed o f  animation, rules
concerning collisions and h o w  many
aliens may exist are all variables you have
at your control, allowing a very ﬂexible
and involved game to be developed.
There are a couple o f  weak links
though... One is that you must load the
master game creator ﬁrst to play any game
— it is not therefore possible to create an
entirely independent program. T he
second a n d  perhaps mo r e  serious
weakness is that you can only create one
'screen', s o  t h a t  w h e n  y o u  hav e
completed/solved level 1, level 2 and up
are exactly the same but with the option
only o f  increasing the speed o f  the
'aliens'.
Conclusions
Scope 64 is rather a special case and
should only be considered by those who
already have a  fair understanding of
programming. I t  works w e ll and a
compiled routine is not dependent upon
the master program. Y o u  may  use
programs written with Scope 64 as you
wish; there is no restriction on sale of a
compiled routine.
The two adventure writers The Quill
and Adventure Writer both produce
good quality products, indeed there are
already a number of programs created
using these programs, on the market.
The t w o  arcade creators, Games
Designer a n d  Games Creator both
require the master program to be used, to
function — selling games, so produced, is
not pos s ible, ex c ept thr ough t h e
publishers of the programs themselves.
Nevertheless, they enable you to put
together interesting programs for your
own u s e  a n d  als o giv e y o u  t h e
opportunity t o  demonstrate y our
potential as a games designer — and
software houses are always on the lookout
for good ideas.

As most of you are probably aware, the CUM 64 'Sprite' is
not perfectly SYMETRICAL ie. it is 24 bits wide by 21 bits
deep and therefore it is not possible to rotate it perfectly
through 90 degrees. Therefore you should avoid using
the areas that I have shaded, when you are using this
function, in order to get the best results. In any case, if
you decide to use the whole sprite area, you may relocate
the sprite deﬁnition using functions 25-28 inclusive and
then ﬁll in any bits that have been lost off the edges.
Special n o t e s  o n
functions 40 41 & 42
The same general rules of use
apply t o  each o f  the three
functions listed above.
As you will have seen in the
notes on function uses, x = the
source (start) sprite page and y
= the destination (ﬁnish) block.
Before selecting any  o f
these functions, y ou mus t
select t he source block b y
using functions 19 & 20; ie.
'Sprite Page+' a n d  'Spr ite
Page-J.
Now p r e s s  t h e  k e y
associated w it h  whic hev er
function you use to use; ie. 'g',
'o' or' I Y o u  will now see the
sprite block number ﬂashing at
the bottom of the screen. Use
functions 19 & 20 once more to
select the destination block
and once you have selected it,
press 'RETURN' to execute the
function. T h e r e  a r e  t w o
important points to note which
are as follows;
1. Pr es s ing 'RUN/ST O P'
while engaged in any of these
three functions will return the
computer to normal code of
operation without any changes
having being made.
2. After  pressing 'RETURN',
the function will be executed
and the sprite page number
will be reset t o  that o f  the
source block; ie. if you transfer
sprite no. 137 to block no. 232,
after accomplishing the task
the page number will return to
137.
Special n o t e s  o n
Function number 45/46
When this function is called,
you shall be presented with the
message 'Save Sprite Data to
Device'.
Below this, y ou w ill b e
prompted b y  'From Block

cursor,
Type in a number between
128 a n d  2 5 5  a n d  pres s
'RETURN'. Now you will be
prompted b y  ' T o  Bloc k

once more.
Again, type in a number
between 128 and 255 and press
'RETURN'.
You now are requested to

Then you will be given the
option of saving to tape or disc
or abandoning the routine.
As a ﬁnal point, I mention
that any number out of  the

be accepted e.g. 127 or 256.

'Input Inv alid, R edo f r o m
Start'. Y o u  m a y  w e ll as k
yourself why this is so and it
took me quite a considerable
time to ﬁgure out why myself.
The reason is  that '2' is
accepted a s  200 a n d  t his
number is within the 'Legal'
limits, likewise, '13' will b e
accepted as 130; '25' as 250 etc.
So the bug is not so bad
after all as it may be used to
your advantage.

Designed for anyone who wants to produce the best sound from the
Commodore 64, this book explores fully the world of ring modulation and
envelope generation, and the powerful ﬁltering capabilities that make the
creation of unique sounds so easy Many sample programs are included,
°merino three-pad harmony, a proper synthesiser, generating sound effects,
adding new musical keywords, musical interrupts and background tunes
There are sections on the chip that makes it all possible, the 6S81 Sound
Interface Device, and details of how to program the 64 to sound like many
different instruments. E.6.95

IMPOSSIBLE ROUTINES FOR THE COMMODORE 64
Kevin Bergin
These routines will enable you to utilise the more hidden areas of your 64.
The book  contains most of the answers to the questions that give you
sleepless nights. and also provides an insight into how to approach future
problems. The topics covered include protecting a program on tape or disk,
moving Basic, scrambling programs, disabling control keys, and how tc
make a program auto-run as soon as res loaded. There is a collection of
routines to speed up program execution using the internal routines on your
64, a n d  m a n y othe r hints a nd tips such a s a dding comma nds to Ba sic,
downloading the Commodore character set to an Epson 1MB and producing
screen dumps, etc. Each routine includes a documented listing, along with a
general outline of the idea and a detailed look at how the program was
constructed, E6,95

1  you've got any useful
advice to give Your fellow
Commodore readers or any
problems with which you
need our experts' help, lipt
pen to paper.
With reference to Concorde II (volume 1,
issue 1), to make the program respond
correctly to the LEFT and RIGHT, PORT
and STARBOARD movement o f  t he
joystick in  Port 2, the following lines
should surely be:
80 IF(AAAND8)ANDTT=2
81 I  F(AAAN D4)ANDTT=2
82 INAAAND8 )ANDIT=3
83 IF(AAAND4)ANDTT=1
Despite this, it really is a super program.
John Wilkes

Two years ago, the Computer Press were
telling us all how good the VIC 20 was with
its ex c ellent graphic s  a n d  s ound
capabilities. Now, with a few exceptions.
there is absolute silence from the press -
so, what has changed? The answer is
nothing: the VIC is still the same excellent
micro, offering even better value now
with a reduced price.
What will really "kill off" the VIC is if
new, and established, owners can no
longer ﬁnd programs, hints and articles
for it. Apart from continuing to print
articles like 'VIC Games Programming'
and games, perhaps Your Commodore
could a p p l y  s u b t le  pr es s ur e t o
manufacturers, For example, if an item or
program is  sent i n  f or  review, Your
Commodore could ask if it is suitable or
available for the VIC.
Perhaps a  VI C  'special' c ould be
planned, asking software houses to send
details of WC programs for inclusion in a
mammoth listing.
By reminding manufacturers a n d
dealers that a  large number o f  Your
Commodore readers have VICs, all eager
to part with their money for  quality
programs, you would be helping to keep
the VC a worthwhile proposition.
So, keep up the good work with Your
Commodore but make it even better by
keeping the VIC alive and thriving.

I want to interface an Epson MO  Printer
to my 64. / should like the Epson to behave
exactly like a Commodore printer and the
Interface to be 'user transparent'. I had
considered the 'Interpod' but note that it
hasn't got a centronics interface. Is there
any disadvantage in the optional RS-232C
interface available on the Epson?
Hugh Hennessy
Co. Antrim
No matter which interface you use for
your M O  Printer, it will never be totally
compatible with a Commodore Printer.
This i s  because a l l  Commodore
equipment (for reasons best known to
themselves) use their own code for
storing characters, and not ASCII which
most other peripherals (including the
MO) use. For example the 64 stores the
letter 'A' as 65 but the ASCII for 'A' is 97.
This means that if you require upper and
lower case letters to work correctly all
characters sent to the printer will have
to be converted to ASCII.
This can be very time consuming but
some interfaces do this conversion for
you and are well worth the extra cost.
However no non-Commodore printer
will be able to print the comprehensive
range of graphics characters included in
the 64's character set.
As for the choice between centronics
or R5232 interfaces, it really is swings and
roundabouts. Centronic interfaces
require m o re wires, w h ile R5232
interfaces require setting up of Baud
Rates, paraty, stop bits etc. However the
64 does already have the ﬁrmware for
handling RS232 output on the user port.
The Commodore recorder speciﬁes that
tapes of less than 30 minutes must be used
(I assume this is 15minutes each side). The
majority of tapes available are either 10
minutes or 15 minutes long.
Which do I choose for general use? It
would also help if programs printed in
your magazine gave some idea of  the
length of tape required.
R, Marks
Gloucestershire
For most programs that are printed in
magazines a  C12 will b e more than
sufﬁcient. You will only need a longer
tape if you are writing a very long program
or one using a large amount of text.
am learning machine code and am
having problems in getting the random
function to work. Please could you help
me as / can't ﬁnd the answer in any books
or magazines.
W. Laing
Lanarkshire
The random number used by basic is
stored in locations 88 — 8F inclusive. To
generate the next random number simply
call the routine at $E097.
When using machine code to perform
arithmetical calculations, having obtained
a numerical answer t o  a  series o f
additions, h o w  d o you print out the
answer to screen or printer? To take the
simplest case, supposing the answer is
SEFF(=2.5.5), whic h i s  h e ld  i n  t h e
accumulator, and the next instruction is
the 'output' instruction, ISRSFED2, the

L e t t e r s
machine will print the ASCII version of
•o p p l
get t he machine t o  print the actual
number - i.e. 255. I understand how to do
it if the arithmetic is in Binary Coded
Decimal or  if  I store the result in an
address, revert to BASIC and use a 'PRINT
PEEK (HIGH BYTE) 256 PEEK (LOW BYTE)
instruction; but how do I do it directly?
M.W. Peters
Dorset
Most numbers that you will want to print
out will be 16 bit. So here is a routine that
will print out a number passed to it in the
accumulator and the X register (A=LO
BYTE,X= HIGH BYTE). For 8 bit numbers
just set X0  before calling it.
e.g. T o  print a number stored in point
LOA Point
[DX Point + 1
;SR STR
or T o  print 255
LDA # SFF
1.13X # $OO
ISR SIR
With the demise of the VIC 20 there may
be a number of your readers who are
considering the 64 as a replacement. Let
me sound a note of caution. My original
conﬁguration was the VIC 20, 1515 Printer,
Datasette and 1540 Disc Drive. On enquiry-
from the supplier I was assured they were
all compatible with the 64. The supplier
gave me a weird 'Open' command to use
with the Disc Drive which was conﬁrmed
by CBM Corby. Needless to say it did not
work. Further enquiry to CBM gave me a
couple of 'Pokes'. This appeared to work
until I  attempted loading a database
program_ Yet another enquiry gave me
the information that the 'Pokes' would
not work if there were any 'Loads"/'Saves'
in the program and the only way to ensure
success was to change a chip in the 1540
loaded the 64 magazine tape from the
Datasette and got a  60% 'Load Error'
response. A friend loaned me his C2N and
everything was perfect. This means I've
spent £22.42 for a chip and £39.95 for a
C2N. So, when a supplier tells you that the
peripherals are 64 compatible -  they're
not.
C.K.R. Harris

I am considering the purchase of a colour
monitor a n d  hav e n o t  b e e n  v er y
impressed with the Commodore 1701
when compared with, say, a BBC'B' with a
Microvitec CUB. Is this a feature of the
Composite V id e o  s tandar d w h e n
compared with RGB, or have I just seen
bad examples?
Is there any harm in opting for one of
the combined TV/Monitors that ar e
coming onto the market?! have only seen
one in the ﬂesh and it was being run as a
TV; it appeared to have a single BNC input
for the video signal with a single PHONO
connector for  the sound (this was a
FISHER 1401). I have also seen advertised
the SAISHO  CM2OR, FERGUSON
TXMC10 and the FIDELITY CTM1 400.
These s e e m  t o  n e e d  a  m o r e
comprehensive set of inputs -  which is
what I would expect.
If the results are comparable with the
1701, then I would gladly pay the extra £50
or so on the discount price to acquire a
second TV.
Please could you advise me.
R.J.K. Murphy
West Lothian
of encoding and decoding the video
information that results in the quality
drop. The picture obtained from any of
the monitors you mention will certainly
give as good an image as the 1701.
However, for only a slight drop in contrast
any good small screen television, i f
correctly tuned, will give a comparable
picture. This does rely on the tuning of the
RF converter i n  t h e  Commodore
machines remaining stable which was not
the case in early machines where the
tuning tended to wander.
If you can afford the difference the
combined TV/Monitors are your best bet.
A bonus point being that they provide a
compatible RF input for any micro.
I have compiled several programs for
musical tunes but only using one voice.
Could you please tell me how two or
three voices are programmed.
Also, although I can move a balloon
sprite back and forth across the screen,
followed by scrolling an aeroplane up and
down. I cannot write a program enabling
both to move on the screen at the same
time a n d  w o u l d  apprec iate y o u r
guidance.
I.S. Thomas
Torquay
To program the other two voices on your
64 all you need to do is repeat the code for
programming the ﬁrst voice and add 7 to
all the poke locations except that for
volume. For example, to set the frequency
of voice 1 the line might be:
POKE 54272, 100: POKE 54273, 10
To set voice 2 use
POKE 54279, 100: POKE 54280, 10
Be careful to trigger all three yokes as
closely together as possible otherwise the
chords will become staggered.
To move more than one sprite at a
time, include the pokes for moving both
sprites within the same loop. For example,
to move sprite 1 across the screen chased
by sprite 2 use
For 110 to 200: Poke 53250. 1+40: Poke
53252, I:next
As you suspect the drop in  quality
between the BBC you saw running and
the 64 with the 1701, is due to the use of
the composite video link. This is because
with composite video, the three primary
colour signals generated in the 64 have to
be combined into one, and subsequently
decoded by the monitor. It's the process

"Destroy him my robots!"
These chilling words may be the last you'll
ever hear. They are spoken by the evil
Elvin Atombender as y ou search his
underground stronghold for the clues
which will enable you to foil his plan to
destroy the world. Lined up against you
are his deadly robot guards. Your only
weapon is your pocket computer with
which y ou can store and analyse the
information you collect.
If you decide to accept this mission
you w ill need a  copy o f  Impossible
Mission f r o m  C BS Software. Yo u r
Commodore, always ready to help in the
ﬁght to save the world, has come to the
rescue. We are offering ten lucky (?)
people the chance to meet the evil Elvin.
Perhaps you'll be the one to defy his
threats, to overcome his robots, to ﬁnd his
hidden password and to rid the world of
his wickedness. Or more likely, you'll just
plunge t o  your death with a  blood-
curdling scream. Either  w ay  y ou'll
experience a game with brilliant graphics,
stunning sound effects, realistic speech
and a ﬁendishly difﬁcult plot.
The rewards
Of course, that's not all. The ﬁrst prize
winner will receive not only a copy 6I
Impossible Mission but the complete CBS
Software launch range. That's eight great
titles in all.
There ar e t w o  second prizes o f
Impossible Mission plus three other titles,
two third prizes of Impossible Mission
plus two other titles and four fourth prizes
of Impossible Mission plus one other title.
That's a lot of software but we haven't
ﬁnished yet. There are ﬁfty (yes, ﬁfty)
runners-up prizes to be won. They will all
receive o n e  o f  t he t o p  titles listed
opposite.
How to enter
To complete the mission we have set you
is not at all impossible. However, you do
have to ﬁnd a password which will be a
combination of  the ﬁve letters by the
robot pictures. To ﬁnd the password, take
a look at the ﬁve pictures and then match
each robot to the ﬁlm in which you think
it appeared. For example, if you think that
Robot C was in Star Wars, then C is the ﬁrst
letter of your password and so on.
If you're not sure, have a go anyway.
With so many prizes you may still win

David Crisp tests out a fasl
alternative to the standard
talir  Entrepo's Waferdrive.
IF YO U  HAVE H A D  YO UR HEAD
under a pillow for the last few months you
may have missed all advertising and
reviews on this type of device. Basically it
is a tape storage device, rather like a
standard cassette. However, this is much
faster than a standard tape. The small
cartridge, which is about the size of a
box of matches, ﬁts into a drive about
one sixth of the size of a standard 1541.
The whole thing then ﬁts into the cassette
port of your 64 (note not an SX-64 add-
on). It is claimed that, due to the speed the
ﬂimsy looking tape runs at, 120K of data
could be accessed in about 43 seconds.
Sounds impressive but what was it like to
use?
Once it is plugged in you initially have
to load its operating system. Why does
everybody use C000 to CHF? This is where
the operating system reposes and so does
my software printer interface and many
other useful bits and pieces. Turn it all off
and start again. Right!
Nothing there
A separate tape was supplied with the
drive. This claimed to contain games but,
when I took a directory of the tape, I
could only ﬁnd something called script,
which would not do anything except hang
the whole thing up. This may have been
due t o  somebody unconnected with
Entrepo wiping whatever was on there to
start.
There is a built in program which
displays a menu on the screen enabling
you to format, wipe, clean, copy wafer to
wafer, wafer to tape, disc to wafer and so
on as well as getting a directory of the
tape. It is very slow. About 40 seconds
seems to be the average time. It is a fair
comment that as this is a tape it is not bad
but I did ﬁnd myself comparing things to a
disc drive and even the dreaded 1541 is
not as laboured as that.
Slow load
Regarding program loading times, it is
very much between tape and disc. It is
deﬁnitely faster than a standard tape and
noticeably slower than a disc. But I did a
few time tests and it turned out that in
some cases standard tape games using
turbo load w ere ﬁnished while the
Entrepo was still whirring away. The
manual is pretty good and explains how to
open, close, read, and write to ﬁles etc.
and explains fairly well its own error
messages. In use it is much the same as
H a r d w a r e  R e v i e w
WAFERDRIVE
cassette as all ﬁling is sequential and is
something you will ﬁnd easy to use quite
fast. The tapes themselves are resistant to
most legal forms of abuse except for
ovens, baths, and steamrollers as the
tape part is covered by a sliding lid which
protects them from all but the most
persistent pokers, and this may be where
they score.
Mix and match
It is possible to use two of the units
together o n  o n e  waferdrive an d
cassette. Because o f  power supply
limitations that is all. Of course you can
still use your disc drives as well.
The tapes are available in 5 lengths.
These different lengths have different
capacities and so with a shorter tape there
is less searching for the drive to do
resulting in faster loading etc. The tapes
are as follows.
There are times as supplied by Entrepo. As
more ﬁles are used so the capacity
becomes less.
More commands
There are two types of ﬁle available —
program and sequential. A maximum of
255 ﬁles of mixed type can go on each
tape.
The following commands are relevant
to Entrepo use:Open, Close, Get, Input #,
Copy all
What it's all about
Print #, (all relate to reading and writing
to ﬁles), Load, Save, and verify. At ﬁrst
glance it  may appear that a  scratch
command is missing but if you think about
it for a while you will realise that due to
the nature of the ﬁle a scratch command
would be difﬁcult to implement.
To initially use a tape it must ﬁrst be
formatted as for a disc. This is done by
using the built in utility program as
mentioned before.
The copy routines provided make
transferring ﬁles fairly easy. However, I
found it to be unreliable. Also you had to
specify whether a ﬁle to be copied was a
program or sequential ﬁle. That is easy if
you are copying from a disc but not so
easy if you are copying an unknown piece
of software from tape.

A Wafer drive sounds like something to
eat but appears to be no more than a tape
loop smaller than a standard cassette.
Personally there are not enough
advantages for me to want one, I feel they 7 7
may ﬁnd their niche in computer circles
but, and I may be wrong, I do not think
they will catch on.

David Crisp assesses four
business applications from OP
Gemini software for the
Commodore 64.
GEMINI HAVE BEEN IN THE SOFTWARE
market for quite a while now. Most of
their software seemed to start life on the
BBC mac hine b u t  i s  s lowly  being
converted for use on others.
The ﬁrst package I looked at in their
serious software r ange was  H o m e
Accounts. This is intended to help you
with y our home budget. Personally I
would have little use for a program of this
type and feel that it is just one of those
programs which you buy to show the
spouse that computers can be used for
serious applications! My wife wouldn't be
fooled for a minute.
A program o f  this  ty pe requires
discipline. Like a business program, if you
do not keep it up to date you can ﬁnd
yourself in an awful mess.
After loading the program, either from
tape or disc, you are asked if you have a
ﬁle to load. Gemini thoughtfully provide
some demonstration data in order to help
you ﬁnd your way around. You then have
to say whether the data is on tape or disc.
This is my ﬁrst gripe. I feel that with this
type o f  software, once is  enough —
whenever you save or load data you are
asked the same question again. It would
be nice if this information was saved after
your ﬁrst input. This does  become
annoying after a lot of use.
Looking through the manual I came
across something I found hard to believe.
Gemini warn y ou that Commodore's
dreaded garbage collect routine may
'temporarily suspend program execution
for up to two minutes' (their words not
mine). What, thought I! Have they not
even bothered to do something about it?
Apparently not. According to Gemini this
is unavoidable. It's not, and for a small fee
I would show them how to avoid it.
Options
The main menu presents you with a
comprehensive list of options. You are
able to input the data which you feel you
would spend on household items such as
mortgage, insurance, rates, and so on.
Another option then allows you to put in
the actual ﬁgures as time goes by. You are
able to put in bank standing orders, loans,
and so on which build up into a set of
ﬁgures which can be displayed on screen
as a bar chart or printed out. The ﬁgures
can be either one set of data only e.g.
mortgage, or your whole budget. I must
say that a bar chart is easier to digest and
compare than simply a list of comparative
ﬁgures.
The budget items that are provided
seem to cover most things but you can
change your headings if the need arises.
All the things which you need to perform
household accounts are there. It is as
good as any of the other home account
packages that I have seen although I feel
there are a couple of areas in which it
could be improved,
Stock control
The nex t Gemini program that was
loaded into the 64 was their Stock Control
program. This is the same in principle to
earlier versions that I  have seen, but
seems t o  have been more effectively
programmed. The whole thing is more
professional and small bits and pieces
such as a non-standard cursor ﬂash give it
a 'nice to use feel'. I enjoyed using this
although I feel there are a couple of small
things missing.
The one thing it does not offer is cap-
Reports
BUSINESS
acity. Apparently, there is a limit of 235
records per ﬁle. Of course it is possible to
have more than one ﬁle but I feel that
would make management fairly difﬁcult.
Some business users may  ﬁnd this
adequate b u t  ev en f o r  m y  humble
business, 235 cards are not sufﬁcient.
Adding records is easy and most things
are so simple it is almost possible to use
without reading the manual although that
is bad practice. To exit options it is usually
necessary to press the 'home' key. That is
alright in itself but it seems to differ from
Gemini t o  Gemini program. A  little
consistency would help here.
If you just want to browse through the
stock records you can and if  you are
looking for a speciﬁc record, there is
either a search by stock number or search
by dataﬁeld. This performed adequately
but tended to be a little on the slow side.
Records can be sorted on any of the
ﬁelds as long as there are at least 3 records.
One of the reports on the stock ﬁle that
can be printed is a ﬁnancial summary. This
will break down a speciﬁed block of stock
and show total costs of stock, retail value
of stock, and the overall proﬁt margin as
well a s  t h e  c os t o f  br inging a ll
understocked items  u p  t o  minimum
levels. Another, the stock summary, will
again show the details from a speciﬁed
block and either display or print parts of
the selected records. It is also possible to
get hardcopy of complete stock cards.
Printing
The whole program is orientated towards
printing out on a Commodore printer
but, if you have another type driven by a
software interface, Gemini do at least
suggest where it is possible to locate it (in
memory fool). When printing out Gemini
also show you how t o customise the
program in order to get your printer to
print pound signs instead of a hash and
how to print in upper as opposed to lower
case. Thoughtful little pieces like this
make the program much friendlier to use.

Omissions
The one thing I would like to have seen
was an easier way to enter sold stock. As it
stands you need t o use the standard
amend routine and this is a little long
winded. Another thing which would have
made it 'more useful in the ﬁeld' would be
a report of daily sales.
On the whole it is a considerable
improvement on some of the Gemini
programs I have seen but it is not one I
would choose to use myself.
The G emini Database i s  again
rehashed from another machine but is,
like the stock control, a considerable
improvement on their earlier programs.
It is a stand alone database, by which I
mean it is not programmable — but then
for its price that is not unreasonable.
Once the program has loaded, the ﬁrst
thing you need to do, if you are not
loading a previous set of records, is to
format your record card. This is chosen
from the main menu and is simple to do.
The documentation i s  clear and
precise and there is good use of keys. For
instance to change screen colours they
have chosen to use the function keys.
When your ﬁle loads next time the 64 will
default to the colours you have chosen.
Each ﬁeld you deﬁne can be up to 78
characters in length and you can have up
to 20 ﬁelds per card. The number and size
of the ﬁelds determines the total capacity
of your ﬁle. Again, as with the other
Gemini programs, sequential ﬁling has
been used and this tends to limit the total
capacity of the ﬁle.
Getting ﬁlled in
Once you have ﬁnished formatting the
card you can start to ﬁll in. This is easy and,
so as not to make your 64 throw a wobbly,
Gemini have disabled certain keys which
can produce the dreaded 'Extra ignored'
error message which most people have
reason to curse at times. Once you have
some data in you can start to use it.
Every Gemini program seems to have
its saviour and this one is no exception.
The calculate feature in this one is the one
that i ﬁnd very useful. You can perform
many calculations on any numeric ﬁeld
which can allow you to ﬁnd such gems of
knowledge as 'the total age of all your
friends'. Seriously though it is a powerful
function and one which I think many
people may ﬁnd useful.
Poking about
The search feature on this database is nice
and works very well. Using things such as
)•<= and so on it is possible to ﬁnd records
which match a pretty wide set of data. The
display at the top of the screen will show
you how many records it  has found
r n i r u
Serious Soltusire
matching
chosen.
Sort it and save it
Printing out
the conditions y o u  hav e
A powerful sort option is provided which
will allow you to sort on any ﬁeld whether
numeric or  string and does offer case
discrimination. It's a shame that the case
discrimination was not present in the
stock control.
As well as the expected load and save
option there is also an append. This will
allow you (memory permitting) to add
another ﬁle onto the one currently in
RAM. It does not matter if the card format
is different but the format currently in
memory takes precedence a n d  t h e
appended ﬁle ﬁts itself into the presiding
format. I found this very useful.
Once again the report facilities are good.
They can either go to the screen or printer
and you can be speciﬁc as to which ﬁelds
are output. You can also customise the
program in order to get the best printout
possible.
As with the stock program, the manual
is full of tips on how to get your printer
functioning properly and, on this one, an
area o f  memory has been s et aside
speciﬁcally for a software interface. This is
S o f t w a r e  r e v i e w s
500 bytes and is a 37579 to 37079.
This is a useful database and for the
price is good value. It is a new version of
an older program which was a total bodge
up. I am glad to see it has been re-written
and re-written effectively. Gemini seem
to be getting better as time goes on.
The Gemini mail list is in effect very
similar to the database program, except
you use preformatted records. Certain
functions such as calc are not required on
this type o f  program and are indeed
absent.
Search by key
Basically it is a name and address book
which is  used for printing out labels.
Names and addresses are entered on a set
form which as an extra, has a ﬁeld called
search key. This searchkey ﬁeld allows you
to input up to 10 character in order to
designate points of note regarding this
particular card.
For instance, if the ﬁle was of business
contacts, key letter one could be a 'c' —
this would indicate a computer dealer, E
would indicate an electrical dealer and so
On. As I have said 10 spaces are available so
space 1= type, space 2= good/bad payer,
space 3 whether local or not and so on.
These characters are entirely left to your
choice and do make for a very useful
way of printing selective lists.
Labels
You can format your label easily and
specify which ﬁelds you want printed.
Also, y o u  c an pr int customer lists,
telephone lists and s o o n purely by
specifying the ﬁeld to be output.
Early one
The programming on this is not up to the
standard of stock control and database
and I  suspect that it may be an early
version. I do hope that, like the database,
it will be re-written as it has a lot of
potential and could be a very useful aid to
anybody who has a small business as well
as to home users. Comments regarding
capacity are the same as with the previous
programs.
Gemini software
When I  ﬁr s t c ame across G emini
software it was a disaster. Ideas were good
but everything was let down by abysmal
programming and poorly thought out
design. It looks as if they are coming on
leaps and bounds as their later offerings
are well worth a look. I f  Gemini can
update some of their earlier programs I
am sure they will ﬁnd more people buying
their reasonably pric ed stand alor e
modules.

which subsequently became
known as Aristotlean Logic. It
was ponderous in form and,
because i t  was  based o n
common language, was of little
practical use apart from the
intellectual prestige which its
devotees attracted.
It was left t o  t h e  19th
century Ir is h schoolmaster,
George Boole, to sort things
out. H e  ex tr ac ted t h e
important ideas o f  Aristotle
from t h e  mass o f  semantic
nonsense which had grown
round them. I n  effect, h e
changed logic from an art into a
respected branc h o f  p u r e
mathematics w h e n  h e
published a  relatively small
book entitled, ' A n  Investi-
gation i n t o  t h e  Laws  o f
Thought'.
Although Boole's  ideas
made little impact at the time,
Claude Shannon (a pioneer of
Information Theory) and later
John Von Neuman (the father
of t h e  m o d e r n  d i g i t a l
computer) realising its value in
the analysis o f  c omplex
switching c ir c uitr y , m a d e
valuable contributions to the
subject, i n c l u d i n g  t h e
introduction o f  a  new, and
easier t o  understand, set o f
symbols.
Logic, as far  as  w e  are
concerned here, is really the
study of the various switching
actions which take place within
silicon chips and how  such
actions can be simulated by
software. We should remember
that even a  microprocessor
itself is  little mor e than a
complex ar r angement o f
switches or, as they are more
rightly called, logic gates.
Logic gates
Those whose interests extend
to both hardware and software
will probably agree with the
following simple deﬁnition:
A logic gate has one output and
one or more inputs. The logic
state of the output depends on
the logic states applied to the
inputs.
By the term 'logic state' we
mean a '1' or a '0'. Although
most readers may not be too
interested i n  t h e  electrical
details, it is worth mentioning
that, as far as the 6510A is
concerned.
A voltage around 3 to 5 volts is
recognised as 'logic 1'
A voltage lower than about one
volt is recognised as 'logic 0'.
There are several types of
logic g a t e  b u t  o n l y  t h e
following t h r e e  a r e  o f
particular interes t t o  t h e
machine code programmer:
The AND gate
Output is at logic 1 only if all
inputs are at logic O.
The INCLUSIVE-OR gate
Output is at logic 1 if at least
one of the inputs is at logic 1.
The EXCLUSIVE-OR gate
Output is at logic 1 only if the
two inputs  hav e different
states.
The accepted symbols for these
gates are shown in Figure 6.1
There are three instruction
in the 6510A which simulate
gate action. The mnemonics
codes and addressing modes
available follow:

What use are they
It is all very comforting to know
that these logical instructions
are available b u t  t he most
obvious question readers will
ask is — what use are they
Well, ther e w ill b e  times,
particularly if interests extend
to the control or peripheral
gadgets, when you may need to
opertate o n  particular bits
within a byte rather than on the
entire byte. For example, we
may wish to ensure that bit 3 in
the byte is set to 1 without
altering the remaining bits. As
another example, we may wish
to clear bits 3, 5 and 7 but set bit
2. These operations fall into
one of three main categories:
(a) Clearing selected bits in a
byte to '0' without disturbing
the ot her  bits . T h e  AN D
instruction is involved.
(b) Setting selected bits in a
byte to '1' without affecting the
other bits. The ORA instruction
is involved.
(c) Changing selected bits in a
byte from their presentto their
s
t
a
t
e
 oposite w i t h o u t
affecting the other bits. The
FOR Instruction is involved.

P r o g r a m m i n g

the mask pattern
Knowing which instruction to
use, o u t  o f  t h e  t h re e
possibilities, is only half the
battle because t h e r e  s t ill
remains t h e  p r o b le m o f
working out the correct bit
pattern f o r  the operand —
called the mask. Think of it in
the following way:
1. Each bit in the mask, and its
corresponding b i t  i n  t h e
accumulator, for m t h e  t w o
INPUTS of a logic gate.
2. After t h e  instruction i s
performed, t h e  accumulator
bit is the OUTPUT of the gate.
As the table above showed,
the logic instructions can be
used with a variety of addres-
sing modes but we shall use
only the immediate mode for
illustration. It is necessary to
remind readers that the bits,
within a  by te, ar e always
numbered bit 0 to bit 7, the
least signiﬁcant bit at the right
being bit
To clear selected bits to
0
Use AND with an operand
mask designed as follows:
'1's in the mask will leave
corresponding b it s i n  t h e
accumulator unchanged but
'O's in the mask will ensure
corresponding bits will remain
at, or be reset, to O.
Example: To ensure bit 5 in
accumulator is set to '0', use:
AND # $DF
To see why, remember that an
AND gate requires both inputs
to be 1 in order for the output
to be 1. Examine the following
accumulator example:
Accumulator before # $DF
Mask pattern $DF
ccumulator afterwards
0111 1001
110
010
Note carefully t h a t  t h e
accumulator is left exactly the
same as before except that bit 5
is now 0 instead of 1.
To set selected bits to 1
Use ORA with a n  operand
mask designed as follows:
'O's in the mask will leave
corresponding bits unchanged
but i n  the mask will ensure
corresponding bits are set to
'1'.
Example: To ensure bits 2 and 6
in the accumulator are set to '1'
use:
[OR # $38
ORA # $44
To see why, remember that
only one of the inputs to an
inclusive - or gate need be 1 in
order for the output to be 1.

Examine t h e  above accumu-
lator example:
Note bit 6 has been changed
from 0 to 1 but bit 2 happened
to be at 1 anyway.
To change selected bits
Use [OR with an operand mask
designed as follows:
'O's i n  the mask will leave
corresponding bits unchanged
but i n  the mask will ensure
corresponding b i t s  a r e
changed.
Example: To ensure bits 3, 4
and 5 in the accumulator are
changed, use:
Remember than an exclusive-
or gate gives an output at 1 only
if the inputs differ.
Examine •  the a b o v e
accumulator example.
The novelty behind t h e
following snippet of useless (?)
knowledge m ig h t  intrigue
some readers:
Exclusive-oring data with itself
always results in zero. -
For example, if A contains $9D
and we write EOR # $9D, the
result in the accumulator is
zero as we can see above.
Non-arithmetic logic
Logic operations have n o
connection whatsoever with
the normal laws ot arithmetic
because, for one thing, there is
no carry action. Each bit is an
individual entity an d  quite
contemptuous of the feelings
of neighbouring bits. To see
the absurdity o f  trying t o
equate lo g ic results w it h
arithmetic results, consider the
result i f  w e  A N D  2  a n d  3
together — instead of ADDING
them:

Logic and input/output
ports.
Some computers already have
a socket at the back marked
'User Port' o r  t h ey have
facilities f or including one.
These are used for connecting
digital operated devices such as
the points of model railways,
cranes, garage doors, intruder
alarms, robots, special lighting
effects, etc. Eight wires and a
couple of control lines can be
connected to the output port.

The state o f  each line, and
therefore the on/off state of
the devices can be controlled
by storing data patterns in an
output port register. This is an
area where the three logic
instructions can be used most
effectively because o f  t h e
necessity to control the state of
individual bits without af -
fecting the others.

It is sometimes appropriate to
change all the bits within a
byte. That is to say, change all
and all 'O's to '1'. This is
sometimes called 'ﬂipping' the
bits and the result is known as
the 'one's complement' (refer
back to Part 1 of the series.)
Assuming the data is already in
the accumulator, it is clear from
the above treatment t h at
ﬂipping all the bits can b e
achieved by using:
EOR # tleFF
Two's complement of
accumulator
The two's complement of a
number is really the one's
complement with an extra 1
added. Unfortunately, we can't
2 0 0 1 0  0010
3 0 0 0 0  0011
0000 0 0 1 0
add t h e  e x t r a  1  b y
incrementing because t h e
result is in the accumulator and
you will remember that n o
direct incrementing instruc-
tion exists for this register. A
possible coding is then:
EOR # 8,FF
CLC
ADC # 1
An alternative method is to rely
on subtracting A  from zero.
The 6502, and nearly all other
microprocessors, u s e  two's
complement arithmetic f o r
addition and subtraction. I t
follows that by subtracting a
number from zero, we obtain
the two's complement because
X = -X. So to obtain the two's
complement of the accumu-
lator, we must ﬁrst store the
contents in a memory location.
Then after clearing the ac-
cumulator, the original data
can b e subtracted from the
accumulator by use of SBC.
Finding state o f  a
particular bit
It is sometimes important to
ﬁnd out t h e state o f  one
particular bit within a byte. This
can be done by ﬁrst loading the
byte into the accumulator. All
the bits, except the one of
interest, are then cleared to
zero by using an AND mask. If
the result is then tested by BNE
or BEQ, a zero result proves
that the bit of  interest was
indeed a '0' and a non-zero
result proves that it was a i•
An alternative, and simpler
method, can be used if the bit
of interest happens to be in bit

6 or bit 7 position because the
BIT instruction caters speciﬁ-
cally f o r  testing these t w o
positions. Suppose, f o r  ex -
ample, w e write BIT &2000.
This causes the state of bits 6
and 7  at this address to be
copied in t o  t h e  V  and N
positions in the Status Register
respectively. The original state
of bit 7 can then be tested by
using a BM I branch (which tests
N) or bit 6 by a BVS branch
(which tests V) .  Ther e is ,
however, another operation
which takes place during the
BIT test, which can be either a
nuisance or a bonus depending
on t h e  circumstances. T he
contents o f  t h e  oper and
address are logically ANDed
into the accumulator. I f  the
accumulator holds  valuable
data at the time of the BIT test,
it is  important t o  store the
original contents ﬁrst.

The assembly and hex code
form o f  the BIT test are as

The Shift and Rotate
instructions
To shift a register or memory
byte means t o push the bit
pattern sideways by  one bit
position either to the left or to
the right. The coding details of
the t w o  instructions whic h
produce s hift ac tion ASL
(Arithmetic Shift Left) and LSR
(Logical Shift Right) are shown
below. Rotating a register or
memory byte is similar to shift
action ex c ept bits , w hic h
would normally overspill at the
end are re-inserted again at the
other end. The two instructions
are ROL (ROtate Left) and ROR
(ROtate Right).
The shift and rotate instructions
are unique in that one of the
available addressing modes is
Accumulator Addressing s o
they can act directly on the
accUmulator or they can act on
memory locations. If the action
is required on the accumulator,
the mnemonic op-code must
be followed by A. Note that an
operand byte is not required.
For example, ASL A will shift
the contents of the accumu-
lator one place left. A common

and forget to follow it with A.
This would be unrecognisable
code. The instructions must
either have an A or an operand
address f o l l o w i n g  t h e

Note t h a t  i n  a l l  f o u r
instructions, t h e  C  b i t  i s
involved and can be thought of
as the 'ninth bit'. LSR and AS[
provide essentially 'open-loop'
actions because bits,can drop
out or  be lost if the C bit is
already occupied. On the other
hand, ROR and ROL provide
'closed-loop' actions because if
any bit is pushed out at one end
it is re-inserted at the other. It is
easier to follow the action of
these f o u r  instructions b y
means of simple diagrams as
shown in Figure 6.2
LSR A
ROR A

Although the C bit appedrs to
be joined to the registers, we
should bear in mind that it is
physically located u p  in  the
status r e g i s t e r  o f  t h e
microprocessor.
Single byte
multiplication
Subject t o  overspill into the
carry, shifting left by using ASL
will multiply by two each time,
so f o u r  consecutive ASL
operations w i l l  m u lt ip ly
existing data by sixteen. It must
be understood that simple shift
or rotate instructions can only
multiply by an integral power
of two. If, for instance, we want
to multiply by 5, we must shift
the accumulator left twice and
then add the accumulator to
itself once.
Single byte division
Division by two is achieved by
[SR a l t h o u g h  w e  m u s t
remember that the overspill
from the right (from the lsb)
goes into the carry. As a matter
of interest, the reason why LSR
is named Logical Shift Right is
due to this very reason, It is
arithmetically absurd for carry
status to be in the lsb position,
hence i t  is  deemed t o  b e
'logical' rather than 'arithme-
tical' i n  nature. This is  i n
contrast t o  ASL (Arithmetic
Shift Left) where t he carry
action is natural because it is
positioned at  the msb end.
Unless the programmer is sure,
perhaps b y  p r i o r  l o c a l
knowledge of the data limits,
multiplication a n d  div is ion
techniques r ely  heavily o n
careful checking of the carry
status. I n  d o u b l e  le n g t h
working, the carry bit provides
a continuity link between the
low and high bytes o f  the
composite number.
Double-byte
multiplication
This provides a useful exercise
in shift and rotate instructions.
Although t w o  s epar ate
locations are used for  each
double byte number, the C bit
provides continuity between
the two. Although ASL and
ROL both multiply by 2, the
carry can be a problem if they
are not chosen wisely. No carry
must be allowed to enter the
lower order byte from the right
so ASL is appropriate. On the
other hand, the higher order
byte must take into considera-
tion the carry from the right so
ROL must be used. Assuming
the data is  in two bytes o f
memory, the coding would be:
ASL l o w  byte
ROL h ig h  byte
Double byte division
Division i s  v ir tually  t h e
opposite t o  multiplication so
the higher order byte must be
attacked ﬁrst and a carry must
not be allowed to enter from
the left. This suggests LSR is
correct for the ﬁrst step. The
lower order byte must receive a
carry (if any) from the left so the
correct instruction is  ROR.
Assuming the data is in two
bytes of memory, the coding
becomes

COMMODORE OWNERS WHO  KEEP
themselves abreast o f  happenings out
there in the big, bad, computer world,
won't have failed t o  notice the new
network which has been set up especially
for CBM64 owners, Compunet. They'll
also be aware that while it's quite a
promising system, it's still in its infancy
and hasn't too many games available on its
pages.
This should change fairly quickly,
because there's an area of the network
known as The Jungle, where users can
upload their own pages, including their
own software, and even make people pay
if they want to play it! Most of these will
be games specially designed for the 64,
which will download into your machine
and use the modem as a don gle to stop
you giving it to other people (or, even
worse, selling it!). There's one program,
however, which doesn't d o that; you
never get a copy of it zapped down the
line at you because it runs on whacking
great big mainframe computers, the same
ones which the Compunet system itself
uses. It uses more disc space than you can
store on a ﬂoppy, never mind a cassette,
and (not surprisingly) it's the only game of
it's kind in the world, This program is
called MUD, an acronym for Multi-User
Dungeon. It's a normal adventure game in
virtually every respect except one: you
don't play alone.
Multi-user dungeon
MUD is  t h e  ﬁrs t adventure game
where more than one person can play at
the same time. To understand the full
impact which this has on the game, you
really have to play it. The difference made
by the fact that other people are in there
with you is so profound that it's very hard
to get over in an article such as this. It's just
such an incredible extra dimension that it
leaves ordinary games standing. With
other players around t o  thwart your
ambitions, o r  help y ou when you're
down, to chat with you (while perhaps
relieving you of your belongings!), MUD
improves on the basic concept of an
adventure game by such an extent that it
just has to be the way computer games
are going to go in the future. MUD on
Compunet may be the only commercial
version available for the moment, but
within a couple of years there will be
multi-user adventures sprouting up all
over the place. The whole computer
games market may never be the same.
If MUD's such a good idea, then, why
hasn't it been thought of before? Good

question! The problem is that in order to
manage such a piece of software you need
very powerful computers. Micros just
aren't up to it. No-one is going to buy a
mainframe computer with half a million
pounds just to see if  they can write a
multi-user adventure game! Also, it's only
recently that the micro boom has started
to give way to the communications boom,
with modem sales rising as micro sales
start to drop. Up until now, there's been
hardly any market for games which you
can just play over the phone lines. Now,
however, the growing number of modem
owners looking for something new to do
with their machines has prompted people
like Compunet to set up networks to tap
the market.
UCK IN
THE MUD
Advent
In order to trace the development of
MUD, we have to go back to 1979 at Essex
University. There, undergraduates used
to s pend t heir  f r e e  t ime  o n  t h e
University's mainframe computer playing
this new game they'd discovered. They
knew it as Advent, but these days it's
called Adventure o r  Collosal Cave.
Judging by the impact it has had on the
world of computer games, perhaps the
name Advent is more appropriate!
One o f  those undergraduates, Roy
Trubshaw, played Advent and liked what
he saw. There were a few things which
really niggled him, though, for example,
the poor command parser (verb-object

pairs only). He was also annoyed by the
fact that Advent was a one-off, and if he
wanted to make the program work for
another fantasy world it would have to be
done from scratch. Why bother rewriting
all those routines to move, drop objects,
kill monsters and the like when most of
them ar e common t o  all adventure
games? What he envisaged was a game
which had its own built-in adventure-
designing language, so you only had to
say a few things and it knew what to do
with them. If all adventures have tables of
rooms, objects, room connections and
the like, what is to prevent your making
them data instead of part of the program?
And take our game-dependant stuff too;
like having i t  check there's a  bear
440, f o l l o w i n g  you every time you go round
the command loop so it can inform you
you're being followed by a bear..?
The other major disadvantage he saw
in Advent was that it was only a single-user
game. No-one else could be in there with
you to help you out in times of trouble, or
give you times of trouble if you had more
treasure than they did! Surely a game
along those lines would be much more
loo
And so he set about writing such a
game — called MUD. It had a language
of its ow n t o  deﬁne the world, and
because Essex University's powerful
(by the standards of those days!) DEC-10
computer did timesharing, it wasn't too
difﬁcult to arrange it so several people
could play at a time. The thought of what
would happen in the future if everyone
had a computer of their own which they
could connect to a network to play games
of this kind, just didn't concern him; he
was doing it solely out of interest and love
of programming.
A helping hand
What Roy came up with was a bare-
bones system, which had a programmable
world, a passable language parser, and
multi-user capabilities_ Now one of Roy's
friends was a chap by the name of Richard
Bartle. I'd say he was an expert games-
player and a programmer of the most elite
class, except since he's me you'd think I
was boasting! In spring 1980, Roy had
gone about as far as he wanted to with
MUD. I'd helped him with ideas from the
start, but the programming was all his own
work. However, Roy's great love is writing
programs, a n d  he's  n o t  particularly
interested in designing adventures, so I
gradually took more of a part in designing
the game, starting with adding new rooms
to the world which it  modelled and
gradually moving over to adding bits to
the code. When Roy left at the end of his
3rd year, I took the game over and have
never looked back!
The ﬁrst thing I did was to rationalise
some of Roy's experiments. The multi-
user aspect hadn't been explored in full,
and there were anomalies (such as if two
51,0
people were in an underground room
and one had a torch, the other couldn't
see). I  ﬁxed those sort of things, and
added i n  a  f e w  m o r e  interactive
commands like stealing, helping, giving. I
increased the number of rooms gradually
to its present number of 418, and put in an
appropriate number of new objects (an
easy thing to do since we had the Multi-
User Dungeon Deﬁnition Language —
MUDDLE!). What the game didn't have
was a purpose, however, so I put in the
concept o f  scoring for  treasure, and
having levels of experience based on the
amount of treasure you'd accumulted in
previous games.
In order to debug MUD when we'd
just stuck in new rooms, we'd always had a
"debug mode", or "wizard mode" as we
used to call it. If a new room complex had
been added, then to test it out we might
normally have to get an axe, chop down a
tree, fetch a light source, and go beneath
the tree t o  explore the new rooms.
Wizards could ﬂy to any room, and they
glowed in the dark.
Snoop
About this time, I had a spare afternoon
and decided to put in a new feature,
the "snoop". Wit h  this , one player
(if they were in  wizard mode) could
sit and watch what was on the screen
of another player, without that other
player knowing. The original intention
was so you could see common mistakes
people made, a n d  t r y  t o  g e t  t h e
game to cope with them. It turned out to
be far more useful than that!
When I put in snoop, I spent the next
3 hours enraptured by watching other
people stumble about the game and make
complete fools o f  themselves! I t  was
tremendous fun! The time just ﬂew by,
and I resolved that I'd better make this
facility more generally available. So, when
people got a certain number of points for
playing, they were given the password to
wizard mode and obtained the same
powers as I had.
Wizard mode works really well. Non-
wizards (mortals) all the time witness the
power of wizards, and strive to make it
themselves. To date, 52 players out of
maybe 3 or 4 thousand who have tried the
game have managed to make it to the top.
We also have female wizards, who are
called witches, so there's a generic term,
wiz, to mean both wizards and witches.
Wiz's still play if they can, too, because the
game is never ending. When you're a wiz,
there are still fresh supplies of new people
coming in  t o  watch as they progress
through the game, and you have plenty of
friends in there anyway if you just want a
chat. Although wiz's are able t o  d o
immensely powerful things (there's a
CRASH command — and it makes MUD
do just what it says!), they rarely do. This is
because they've been mortals themselves
and know how heart-breaking it is for
someone to interfere with the game and
make them lose all their points. They tease
mortals, yes, but always reward them with
a few treasures afterwards to show they're
really nice deep down...
The rest of the world found out about
MUD from ex-Essex players who left with
a yearning to hack and slay in the world of
MUD. The grapevine was the only way
people heard about the game for ages
afterwards, until the present ﬂurry of
articles in the Computer press. Now I get 5
or 6 letters a day from people asking how
to access MUD.
Playing the game
So how can you play the game? Well,
there are currently two 'open' versions in
Britain (and one in  Norway!), one of
which is free and one of which isn't. The
free one is based at Essex Un iversity, and is
the original. Because o f  this, i t  gets
changed whenever I feel like it and is
prone to crashes (OK, so it crashes at least
once a  n i g h t ! ) .  A l s o ,  i t  k e e p s
extraordinary hours, lik e midnight t o
7am, or, if the computer is exceptionally
busy, from lam to 7am. The University
may not charge money to play it, which is
very decent of them and makes you glad
you pay your taxes, but BT do charge
money, and to access MUD via PSS (the BY
national network) costs at least E2.50 an
hour. The second MUD site is Compu net,
which comes to around £3.50 an hour,
but doesn't crash so often and has more
civilised hours.
Compu net will be sole distributors of
the current version of MUD for some
time, but work is already proceeding
apace at the new, improved version!
There has to be a new version, because
now people know how good MUDS are
they'll start designing their own, and we'll
have a whole bunch of them appearing
before you know it. The best these will be
able t o  do is imitate MUD, however,
whereas with the order of 25,000 hours
playing time behind it, the Essex MUD has
lots of experience which can be drawn
upon in creating an even better version (if
such a thing is conceivable!) (oops, did I
just boast?).
For t h e  moment, though, M U D
remains unique. So if Father Christmas
brings you a Commodore modem for
Christmas, and you ﬁnd yourself huddled
over a micro on December 25th, snow
falling outside, a mug of hot soup beside
you, as you tap through gloved ﬁngers at a
keyboard that's beginning to freeze over,
remember it's  only  y our body  that's
feeling the cold. The real you is perhaps
hundreds of miles away in MUD, sword in
hand, wand at the ready, doing battle with
who knows what and who knows whom,
to force your way against the odds up to
wiz. MUD is always warm, of course —it is
in the Jungle, after all!

FIRST
AID
for your 64
Computers, like people, are fallible. They need the right
combination of code and care to perform effectively in the
business or the home. And that requires ﬁrst hand knowledge
from you to create a healthy operating environment for your
commodore 64.
Knowledge about machine language, about the lesser known
qualities of the 64, about the disc drives, graphics, and about the
tricks and tips to keep your 64 on line. That's why First Publishing
has now launched in the UK a series of high quality books and
software packages to provide a complete health care kit for your
64. Commodore 64 users throughout Europe have already found it
a tonic. We think you will, too.

SETTING
OUT ON AN
ADVENTUR
if you want to try your hand
at writing adventures but
don't know where to start, let
Allan Webb show you the
way into this complex subject.
ONE OF THE MOST GRIPPING ASPECTS
of adventures is that writing them is as
challenging and enjoyable as playing
them. The programming aspects tied up
in adventures ar e various, including
artiﬁcial intelligence, data compression
and graphics. In this series of articles. I
intend to discuss some of the aspects of
writing adventures. I  don't intend t o
spoon feed all the code necessary for
you to write a complete adventure; there
are enough books on the market which
do that job. Instead, I want to give a
collection of ideas and routines which, I
hope will trigger your own ideas and
perhaps give your games something extra.
Owing to space limitations, the number of
listings will be limited to a few machine
code utilities.
Plotting
The most crucial phase of any adventure is
the writing of the scenario and plot. It's
the quality of the plot which will make or
break your masterpiece_ Before doing
anything, I suggest that you look at as
many other adventures as you can, note
what they do and ensure you don't copy
them, Nobody  lik es  a  c opy  whils t
everyone will admire an original. If you
must research for ideas try the written
word. You should decide in detail what
happens where and who is involved.Don't
be tempted to start coding until you're
happy with the plot.
Mapping
There are two general ways of mapping
adventures, each with its own particular
feel, The ﬁrst type of map uses discrete
locations, each with a description, with

Figure 1. The grid map
linking paths. Figure 2 gives a simple
example. This method can give the feeling
of discontinuity with sudden jumps from
one scenario to the next if care isn't taken
with the choice o f  locations. I f  your
scenario is large and you want a better
feeling of space and gentle transition,
consider ﬁgure 1. This map is split into a
grid which deﬁnes the various locations.
Your position o n  t h e  map is  simply
deﬁned by a pair of coordinates. Despite
the larger number of locations, you don't
necessarily require a larger number of
descriptions. For example, all areas of
mountains or all areas of open land will
have t h e  same descriptions, s o that
perhaps half a dozen descriptions can
cover a large percentage of the locations.
The feel and atmosphere of your game
will depend o n  t h e  quality o f  t h e
descriptions o f  t h e  scenario. Bo t h
graphics and text can be used to provide
descriptions. There is  a  l o t  o f  silly
snobbishness when it comes to whether

graphics or text should be used. In my 
E
opinion graphics are rather too RAM
hungry and you get too poor a return
from them to justify their use. In fact,
good use of text can give an excellent
atmosphere; try the Level 9 or Infocom

games and see. I would simply add that
you don't ﬁnd pictures in most decent
novels.
In this part. I will deal with text, but
fear not, I will discuss graphics in a later
section. You can split the description of a
location into three sections. First there is
the main description. You know the sort
of thing..."You are in a long room ﬁlled
with stone emporer penguins". This
section never changes during the game.
There then follows a variable section
describing ﬁx ed items  whic h might
change status. For example..."There is an
open door, the light is on." to give real
variation, a third section can be included.
This will describe "one off" occurances
such as "A herd of hippos is walking by"
or " An  old man is wrestling with an
Aardvark in the corner."
Where the large scale map approach is
adopted, the use of the third section is
vital to prevent the scenario becoming
monotonous. You can also include other
variables to add spice. Everyone knows
the boring old situation where you enter a
cave and must have a torch because it's
dark. This can obviously be extended to
cover other areas. For example why not
have day and night periods, or how about
including the weather. The occasional
snow storm or monsoon can be used to
make t h e  game m o r e  difﬁc ult o r
hazardous.
Because of the open nature of the large
map approach, a  better  feeling o f
movement can be obtained by use of
relative positioning. Imagine y ou are
standing to the south of a village. As you
move northeast, y our  pos ition and
distance relative to the village will change.
If the village's position on the map is
known, the exercise is trivial. Listing 1
shows how to calculate your bearing BE
and range in arbitrary units (RA) from a
point XC,YC. Your position is XP,YP. BE
will have a value between 1 and 8 can be
used to print the bearing as a point of the
compass such that north=1, northeast=2
etc.

This concept can also be applied to
major landmarks such as  mountains,
deserts and the sea.
You can then print alter your description
something like:
"4 leagues to north lies a castle."
Text storage
OK, enough theory, now some harsh
reality. Where o n  earth can all this
marvellous text be stowed. Text tends to
be memory hungry. If, for example, you
have ﬁfty locations each with a three line
description, you will loose 6K of RAM.
The simple method of saving the text is by
use of DATA statements and strings. All
very nasty and wasteful. How about
sequential ﬁles on cassette or disk? Again
not ideal. The most elegant approach is to
use the spare RAM behind the ROMs.
Speciﬁcally, the 8K behind the BASIC
ROM. Listing 2 gives a routine for printing
text stored in RAM.
This routine both saves and recalls the
text from the block of RAM starting at SP.
The start of each message is kept in IT and
HT. If you want to use the routine as a data
loader simply change line 140 so that
holds just NEXT. The following simple line
will print message number MN at the

current cursor position in the current
colour:
10 POKE 900,MN: SYS 51712
Lines 10 to 40 must be included in your
program and executed before you try to
print a message. You can use this routine
with any section of RAM below $C000
(49152).
I've ignored t he area behind the
Kernal ROM since it can be used for high
resolution graphics. Listing 3, however,
will enable you to use this area for storage
if you wish:
This routine enables you to POKE and
PEEK any section of RAM. Lines 10000 to
the end show how t o  store text by
POKEing it into RAM. It's slow but works.
Lines 1 to 20 must be included in your
program if you want to use the routine.
A quick look at these routines will
show that a  fair  amount o f  data is
associated with any adventure. I would
recommend any beginners to use a data
loading program to put all the data into
RAM before loading the main adventure.
More advanced souls can save the data
using a  machine code monitor. Data
which hides behind the BASIC RO M
can be saved using a monitor provided
you switch out the ROM before saving
and switch it back in afterwards; both
from within the monitor. Saving data
from behind the Kernal ROM is tougher
since the input/output chips are in that
area. A  loader such as listing 2 is the
simplest way of loading data into the area
above SCHF,
Layouts
Finally, I want to say something about the
layout o f  the complete adventure. I f
you're using BASIC, you must take care
with t he layout t o  ensure maximum

speed. Figure 3 shows the algorithm I use
As you can see, it's essentially linear. The
ﬁrst box involves setting up variables,
loading mac hine c o d e  a n d  o t h e r
sundries. The second section performs
the repetitive steps such as updating the
display, checking for night, checking to
see if  you've won, looking after the
movement o f  characters etc . T his
section is executed after every "turn".
The nex t t w o  boxes tak e y our

warned of nonsense commands at this
stage. If your command is valid the ﬁnal

constructs to "fan out" the ﬂow, so that
parallel rather than serial routines are
used. Again this increases speed.
Each verb routine has a similar form:
Validity check
Perform action
Catchall
The validity check makes sure that the
object is present or is carried and inputs a
suitable command and exits if it isn't. The
catchall ensures that a non-essential or
unrecognised c ommand is  acknow-
ledged. Random catchall responses such
as.."Sounds fun but I've got a headache"
or "I did that yesterday" or "That won't
achieve anything" will give more variety
rather than a ﬁxed response. I consider it
vital that a variety of responses are used to
make the game entertaining. You will
note m y  examples a r e  s omewhat
eccentric; you can equally use serious
replies. Any author using simply "I can't
do that" deserves to be shot.
The real secret to writing an adven-
ture is  structure. It's  inevitable that
the code is going to be lengthy and if you
don't take care, a rats nest of indeciterable
code will result. Keep a track of what each
section and variable does. Keep a careful
eye on GOSUBS. Avoid nested GOSUBs
since if you get an OUT OF MEMORY
ERROR it can take hours to track it down.
Use REMs initially to help you keep track
but don't make a REM the target of a
GOTO or GOSUB.
In the next instalment I will discuss
interpreters and mov ing about t h e
scenario and will give a listing for  a
machine c ode interpreter which w ill
provide a little zip to your adventures.

The all-singing, all-dancing
software has arrived from the
States. Kevin Cox went
backstage.
QUESTION: WHAT HAVE THE RECORD
and t h e software companies got in
common? Hankie Goes To Hollywood is
one answer — Ocean have just released a
game featuring members of the band.
Dave Greenﬁeld of the Stranglers has
written a n  adventure game f o r the
Spectrum which is tacked onto the tail
end of the cassette version of their latest
album, Aural Sculpture. Even the words
'cassette' and 'disc' are inter-changeable
between the two industries.
"Software is part of
entertainment."
Now there are also a couple of new
companies with proven track records
(pardon the pun) in the music business
making the move into software. They are
CBS Software which grew out of CBS
Records, and Ariolasoft, a part of the big
German corporation, Bertelsmann which
also owns Arista/Ariola Records. Both
new companies insist, however, that the
most important thing they have i n
common with the record industry is
entertainment. "Software i s  part o f
entertainment," said Frank Brunger, the
Sales an d  Marketing Manager o f
Ariolasoft. "It is to all intents and purposes
a fun element which is what music is all
about."
This fun element came over very
strongly when I went to interview Frank,
and Ashley Gray, the Managing Director
They not only share the same desk (it is
rather a large one) but they also share the
same sense of humour. At times you
wonder if Brunger and Gray might not
have made a name for themselves as a
comic double act in another branch of the
entertainments business. For example, I
asked Frank if they personally appraised
every game which is to appear under the
Ariolasoft label.
Brunger: We look at every single game on
several different levels.
Gray: If we can get to them, of course.
"We have attempted to ally
quite closely to the record
industry."
Both men have plenty of experience of
what entertains people. Until Ariolasoft
was started in October last year they had
spent more years that I cared to ask them
working for CBS Records. They know the
age group at which pop records and
computer games are traditionally aimed.
"We have attempted to ally quite closely
to the record industry, in the packaging,
advertising etc., because it very much
suits the market," said Frank. He sees
games in much the same way that he used
to see Pop singles at CBS, though he
realises that a good game may have a
much longer life span than the brief chart
entry of a one-hit wonder. And on the
subject of charts he is adamant that the
industry must adopt a single and credible
chart which will become the standard —
the Gallup one which appears in Your
Commodore for the ﬁrst time this month
is the one that gets his vote,
So what about the software. Their ﬁrst
twelve releases are all American games for
the 64 which they have re-packaged and
translated into cassette versions. All of the
games come from two o f  the most
respected U.S. software companies,
Broderbund and Electronic Arts and they
have all been hits in America. You may
already have heard of some of them: Lode
Runner, Choplifter, M.U.L.E., Raid on
Bungeling Bay because they have been
available as imports priced at about 130-
140, roughly equivalent to their cost in the
U.S. So how can Ariolasoft sell them in this
country at 19.95? Ashley Gray told me, "I
think the fundamental point is that if you
are going to exploit the market, you have
to charge the market price. The market
price in the U.K. is not 130 a game. If it
were there would be no room for us,
because as you know Broderbund would
have done it already. The product has
been available on import. However, if you
remove the freight, remove the customs
duties and you end up with different,
cheaper packaging then you are bound to
end up with a cheaper price." As he
explained the development costs have
already been met, in the U.S.
CBS Software h a v e  a  similar
arrangement with the American software
house, Epyx, famous for Summer Games
and now the brilliant Impossible Mission.
Brian Hyams of CBS admits that they
arrived late in the market — the reason
Summer Games w as released b y
Quicksilva was because CBS Software was
not ready at the time, However, it was
only last year that the U.S. and U.K.
markets found a machine in common, the
Commodore 6 4 ,  w h ich  mad e i t
economically feasible to import and adapt
software. It is too early to say what effect
importing U.S. software will have on the
home market but the repercussions could
be considerable. Because American
games are disc based and much more
expensive they are generally more highly
developed than the product we are used
to. I put it to Ashley Gray that we may
eventually i n  this country become
completely dependent o n  American
software because nobody here will be
able t o  afford t h e costs o f  longer
development times needed to compete.
"I disagree with yo u  fundamentally
because I think the reason U.K. software is
not as good as it could be in comparison
with the U.S. stuff is very simple; that is,
that business as we have it in the U.K. is, in
many different aspects, not yet fully
developed. And I think you will ﬁnd that
most U.K. software houses have not yet
decided to develop software which is
marketable worldwide. You only have to
look at the names of some of the games

and they are solely U.K. based products.
They don't mean anything to anybody
outside the U.K."
He believes that it is not necessarily
greater development times which will
allow U.K. software t o  compete but
greater attention to detail which can be
had for minimal extra cost. That being the
case, I wanted to know if he foresaw the
possibility of exporting U.K. software into
the States at considerably reduced prices
and perhaps cleaning up. " I  think  it
unlikely that that will happen. I think it
much more likely that, certainly as far as
Ariolasoft is concerned, we will source
better, more expensive software in the
U.K. and sell it at a higher price in the U.S.
to pay for  it. And gradually the two
countries w i l l  c o m e  towar ds  a n
equilibrium." He added, "I fundamentally
believe that if we are to create our own
presence in terms of sourcing product in
the U.K. we have to consciously source
product which is the best and which
stands the best chance o f  competing
against the existing Ariolasoft products in
their own markets. In other words, I am
not interested in sourcing product which
cannot stand up against Broderbund and
Electronic Arts in the States."
"...it should be a major piece
of product which has totally
international marketing
possibilities."
Fair enough. I suppose that there is
something of the puritan in me which
resists the idea of yet another American
invasion sweeping aside the home-grown
product. Now I know that nobody is going
to buy a second-rate game just because it
was written down the road and that it's a
lot better on the pocket to pay ElCI for a
program rather than BO. However, it's
still good to have the assurance that a
company like Ariolasoft is committed to
U.K. software.
So when can we expect the ﬁrst non-
American Ariolasoft game? Ashley Gray
again, "Well, w e have one piece o f
product which shall remain nameless,
because we are not telling anybody about
it as yet, which we hope to have available
for shipping to the trade in the middle of
the summer. It will be sourced through a
U.K. software house. I do not know as yet
where it will be written. It may very well
be written in the U.K., it may be written in
France, Germany or wherever." Nothing
had been ﬁnalised when I spoke to him
but he added, "If we go ahead with it, it
should be a major piece of product which
has totally  international mark eting
possibilities. It's going to be very big." No
hints, no clues? "No hints whatsoever."
You can bet I'll be chasing him up about
that one.
With all their other connections in the
entertainments industry, I wondered how
soon they would be organising tie-ups
with records as they are released and later
perhaps ﬁlms. First, Brian Hyams from CBS
Software told me that he does not have
simullaneous rights  t o  CBS music.
However, h e  i s  n o t  c ons ider ing
commissioning U.K. software until the
end of this year, so it may be a little early
for him to say.
Ariolasoft were keen but saw the
pitfalls. Tie-ups cost money and they
don't always work, was Ashley Gray's line.
"Ghostbusters is a good example of a
company (Activision) that got it right," he
said. However, he also named another
couple of examples of which he was more
sceptical. Nevertheless, he was aware of
the potential of good music on a game, "If
the sound is good, it is a big plus."
Another inheritance from the music
industry was his and Frank Brunger's
vehement condemnation of all forms of
piracy. All software houses are united in
their attac k  o n  organis ed pirac y .
However, I have spoken to some who
express a certain understanding for home
copying. Perhaps t he companies are
afraid o f  offending s ome o f  their
customers. Ariolasoft is  adamant. For
them the slogan, home taping is killing
music has become home taping is killing
software. Frank said that he can see no
distinction between going into a shop and
stealing a  toy  or  stealing software by
copying it.
For this reason they are against all
forms of software hire scheme- and they
will not allow any of their games to be
down-loaded electronically, though they
have yet to consider Compunet. They are
also looking forward to the time when
software is simultaneously launched in
the U.S. and the U.K. Only then will
bootlegging become unproﬁtable. To do
this they are being, and I quote, 'fairly
aggressive in clearing the back-log' of
games. We should be in for a bonanza of
software on the Ariolasoft label for some
time to come.
"If the sound is good, it is a
big plus"
I have really left the most important
advantage which these two companies
possess u n t il las t: experience. Both
companies have a good, saleable product
but they also have the ability to exploit it.
You can't hype rubbish for long, but many
excellent programs have disappeared for
want of exposure. As Frank Brunger says,
"The days of the cottage industry are
passed," and he is a man who has not
come from the cottage, but the glass
tower world of a successful international
company. Similarly, Ashley Gray says,
"There has to be a new professionalism."
They are both relative newcomers to what
is really a very new industry, but they
bring with them the disciplines of  a
related and more established business.
Already they are looking at new ways of
getting their message across (without the
advantages of the record industry's ready-
made medium, radio) and looking at new
outlets for their product (record stores are
the obvious target). Combined with this
marketing experience, though, i s  a
freshness o f  approach. Frank Brunger
admits that he is no computer buff, but
sees this as no disadvantage. "If a program
works for me, it should work for the mass
market."
Above a ll,  lik e  a ll good record
companies, both Ariolasoft and CBS
Software are not just chasing the hits but
building a broadly based catalogue. The
next new releases from CBS are to be
educational pr ogr ams , a  m a r k e t
Ariolasoft is also intending to enter, as
well as the business ﬁeld under the
provisional title of Prosoft.
Entertainment is  after all a serious
business, but it can also be fun.

Choosing the right computer
is a good start b u t  can you
ﬁnd the right software?
At SUPERSOFT we're very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders.
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
— making ends meet! Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better.
For home, club or small business use
BUSICALC 1 should pay for itself in no time at
all; for larger companies we recommend
BUSICALC 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 64 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it all works. Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
To use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTER is the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wish.
INTERDICTOR PILOT is a space ﬂight
simulator. Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because —
to be frank — its a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the real thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century: space travel is commonplace, and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought. A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!

Other SUPERSOFT products include the
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, the only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pow-
erful enough for the professional (most of
our competitors use it!). The VICTREE cart-
ridge adds dozens of commands to Basic
including toolkit aids and disk commands; or
on disk there's MASTER 64, a really com-
prehensive package for the keen prog-
rammer.
Of course, we do also publish games
programs, and with classics like STIX. QUINX
and KAMIKAZE in our range we are one of
the market leaders But we most enjoy
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be in use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer —
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket. But
most specialist shops stock titles from our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order). However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by calling at our
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
ACCESS card.
