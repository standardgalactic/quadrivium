Preface 
In 1963, the first author introduced a course in set theory at the University 
of Illinois whose main objectives were to cover Godel's work on the con-
sistency of the Axiom of Choice (AC) and the Generalized Continuum 
Hypothesis (GCH), and Cohen's work on the independence of the AC and 
the GCH. Notes taken in 1963 by the second author were taught by him in 
1966, revised extensively, and are presented here as an introduction to 
axiomatic set theory. 
Texts in set theory frequently develop the subject rapidly moving from 
key result to key result and suppressing many details. Advocates of the fast 
development claim at least two advantages. First, key results are high-
lighted, and second, the student who wishes to master the subject is com-
pelled to develop the detail on his own. However, an instructor using a 
"fast development" text must devote much class time to assisting his students 
in their efforts to bridge gaps in the text. 
We have chosen instead a development that is quite detailed and com-
plete. For our slow development we claim the following advantages. The 
text is one from which a student can learn with little supervision and in-
struction. This enables the instructor to use class time for the presentation 
of alternative developments and supplementary material. Indeed, by present-
ing the student with a suitably detailed development, we enable him to move 
more rapidly to the research frontier and concentrate his efforts on original 
problems rather than expending that effort redoing results that are well 
known. 
Our main objective in this text is to acquaint the reader with Zermelo-
Fraenkel set theory and bring him to a study of interesting results in one 
semester. Among the results that we consider interesting are the following: 
Sierpinski's proof that the GCH implies the AC, Rubin's proof that the 
v

Preface 
Aleph Hypothesis CAH) implies the AC, G6del's consistency results and 
Cohen's forcing techniques. We end the text with a section on Cohen's 
proof of the independence of the Axiom of Constructibility. 
In a sequel to this text entitled Axiomatic Set Theory, we will discuss, in a 
very general framework, relative constructibility, general forcing, and their 
relationship. 
We are indebted to so many people for assistance in the preparation of 
this text that we would not attempt to list them all. We do, however, wish 
to express our appreciation to Professors Kenneth Appel, W. W. Boone, 
Carl Jockusch, Thomas McLaughlin, and Nobuo Zama for their valuable 
suggestions and advice. We also wish to thank Professor H. L. Africk, 
Professor Kenneth Bowen, Paul E. Cohen, Eric Frankl, Charles Kahane, 
Donald Pelletier, George Sacerdote, Eric Schindler, and Kenneth Slonneger, 
all students or former students of the authors, for their assistance at various 
stages in the preparation of the manuscript. 
A special note of appreciation goes to Professor Hisao Tanaka, who made 
numerous suggestions for improving the text and to Dr. Klaus Gloede, who, 
through the cooperation of Springer-Verlag, provided us with valuable 
editorial advice and assistance. 
We are also grateful to Mrs. Carolyn Bloemker for her care and patience 
in typing the final manuscript.

Preface to the Second Edition 
Since our first edition appeared in 1971 much progress has been made in 
set theory. The problem that we faced with this revision was that of selecting 
new material to include that would make our text current, while at the same 
time retaining its status as an introductory text. We have chosen to make 
two major changes. We have modified the material on forcing to present a 
more contemporary approach. The approach used in the first edition was 
dated when that edition went to press. We knew that but thought it of 
interest to include a section on forcing that was close to Cohen's original 
approach. Those who wished to learn the Boolean valued approach could 
find that presentation in our second volume GTM 8. But now we feel that 
we can no longer justify devoting time and space to an approach that is only 
of historical interest. 
As a second major modification, and one intended to update our text, we 
have added two chapters on Silver machines. The material presented here is 
based on Silver's lectures given in 1977 at the Logic Colloquium in WracYaw, 
Poland. 
In order to produce a text of convenient size and reasonable cost we have 
had to delete some of the material presented in the first edition. Two chapters 
have been deleted in toto, the chapter on the Arithmetization of Model 
Theory, and the chapter on Languages, Structures, and Models. The material 
in Chapters 10 and 11 has been streamlined by introducing the Axiom of 
Choice earlier and deleting Sierpinski's proof that GCH implies AC, and 
Rubin's proof that All, the aleph hypothesis, implies AC. Without these 
results we no longer need to distinguish between GCH and AH and so we 
adopt the custom in common use of calling the aleph hypothesis the gener-
alized continuum hypothesis.

Preface to the Second Edition 
There are two other changes that deserve mention. We have altered the 
language of our theory by introducing different symbols for bound and free 
variables. This simplifies certain statements by avoiding the need to add 
conditions for instances of universal statements. The second change was 
intended to bring some perspective to our study by helping the reader 
understand the relative importance of the results presented here. We have 
used "Theorem" only for major results. Results of lesser importance have 
been labeled" Proposition." 
We are indebted to so many people for suggestions for this revision that 
we dare not attempt to recognize them all lest some be omitted. But two 
names must be mentioned, Josef Tichy and Juichi Shinoda. Juichi Shinoda 
provided valuable assistance with the final version of the material on Silver 
machines. He also read the page proofs for the chapters on Silver machines 
and forcing, and suggested changes that were incorporated. Josef Tichy did 
an incredibly thorough proof reading of the first edition and compiled a list 
of misprints and errors. We have used this list extensively in the hope of 
producing an error free revision even though we know that that hope cannot 
be realized. 
Finally we wish to convey our appreciation to Ms. Carolyn Bloemker 
for her usual professional job in typing the manuscript for new portions 
of this revision.

CHAPTER 1 
Introduction 
In 1895 and 1897 Georg Cantor (1845-1918) published, in a two-part paper, 
his master works on ordinal and cardinal numbers.! Cantor's theory of 
ordinal and cardinal numbers was the culmination of three decades of re-
search on number" aggregates." Beginning with his paper on the denumer-
ability of infinite sets,2 published in 1874, Cantor had built a new theory of 
the infinite. In this theory a collection of objects, even an infinite collection, 
is conceived of as a single entity. 
The notion of an infinite set as a complete entity was not universally 
accepted. Critics argued that logic is an extrapolation from experience that is 
necessarily finitistic. To extend the logic of the finite to the infinite entailed 
risks too grave to countenance. This prediction of logical disaster seemed 
vindicated when at the turn of the century paradoxes were discovered in the 
very foundations of the new discipline. Dedekind stopped publication of his 
Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen? Frege conceded that the foundation of his 
Grundgesetze der Arithmetik was destroyed. 
Nevertheless set theory gained sufficient support to survive the crisis of 
the paradoxes. In 1908, speaking at the International Congress at Rome, 
the great Henri Poincare (1854-1912) urged that a remedy be sought. 3 As a 
reward he promised "the joy of the physician called to treat a beautiful

pathologic case." By that time Zermelo and Russell were already at work 
seeking fundamental principles on which a consistent theory could be built. 
The first axiomatization of set theory was given by Zermelo in 1908.4 
From this one might assume that the sole purpose for axiomatizing is to 
avoid the paradoxes. There are however reasons to believe that axiomatic set 
theory would have evolved even in the absence of paradoxes. Certainly the 
work of Dedekind and of Frege in the foundations of arithmetic was not 
motivated by fear of paradoxes but rather by a desire to see what foundational 
principles were required. In his Begriffsschrift Frege states: 
" ... , we divide all truths that require justification into two kinds, those for 
which the proof can be carried out purely by means of logic and those for 
which it must be supported by facts of experience .... Now, when I came to 
consider the question to which of these two kinds the judgements of arith-
metic belong, I first had to .ascertain how far one could proceed in arithmetic 
by means of inferences alone, .... "5 
Very early in the history of set theory it was discovered that the Axiom of 
Choice, the Continuum Hypothesis, and the Generalized Continuum 
Hypothesis are of special interest and importance. The Continuum Hy-
pothesis is Cantor's conjectured solution to the problem of how many points 
there are on a line in Euclidean space.6 A formal statement of the Continuum 
Hypothesis and its generalization will be given later. 
The Axiom of Choice, in one formulation, asserts that given any collection 
of pairwise disjoint nonempty sets, there exists a set that has exactly one 
element in common with each set of the given collection. The discovery that 
the Axiom of Choice has important implications for all major areas of 
mathematics provided compelling reasons for its acceptance. Its status as an 
axiom, and also that ofthe Generalized Continuum Hypothesis, was however 
not clarified until Kurt G6del in 1938, proved both to be consistent with the 
axioms of general set theory and Paul Cohen, in 1963, proved that they are 
each independent ofthe axioms of general set theory. Our major objective in 
this text will be a study of the contributions of G6del and Cohen. In order to 
do this we must first develop a satisfactory theory of sets. 
For Cantor a set was "any collection into a whole M of definite and 
separate objects m of our intuition or our thought."7 This naive acceptance 
of any collection as a set leads us into the classical paradoxes, as for example

I Introduction 
3 
Russell's paradox: If the collection of all sets that are not elements of them-
selves is a set then this set has the property that it is an element of itself if 
and only if it is not an element of itself. 
In view of Russell's paradox, and other difficulties to be discussed later, 
we have two alternatives in developing a theory of sets. Either we must 
abandon the idea that our theory is to encompass arbitrary collections in 
the sense of Cantor, or we must distinguish between at least two types of 
collections, arbitrary collections that we call classes and certain special 
collections that we call sets. Classes, or arbitrary collections, are however so 
useful and our intuitive feelings about classes are so strong that we dare not 
abandon them. A satisfactory theory of sets must provide a means of speaking 
safely about classes. There are several ways of developing such a theory. 
Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) and Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947) 
in their Principia Mathematica (1910) resolved the known difficulties with 
a theory pf types. They established a hierarchy of types of collections. A 
collection x can be a member of a collection y only if y is one level higher in 
the hierarchy than x. In this system there are variables for each type level in 
the hierarchy and hence there are infinitely many primitive notions. 
Two other systems, Godel-Bernays (GB) set theory and Zenhelo-
Fraenkel (ZF) set theory, evolved from the work of Bernays (1937-1954), 
Fraenkel (1922), Godel (1940), von Neumann (1925-1929), Skolem (1922), 
and Zermelo (1908). Our listing is alphabetical. We will not attempt to 
identify the specific contribution of each man. Following each name we have 
indicated the year or period of years of major contribution. 
In Godel-Bernays set theory the classical paradoxes are avoided by 
recognizing two types of classes, sets and proper classes. Sets are classes 
that are permitted to be members of other classes. Proper classes have sets 
as elements but are not themselves permitted to be elements of other classes. 
In this system we have three primitive notions; set, class and membership. 
In the formal language we have set variables, class variables, and a binary 
predicate symbol "E". 
In Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory we have only two primitive notions; set 
and membership. Class is introduced as a defined term. In the formal language 
we have only set variables and a binary predicate symbol "E". Thus in ZF 
quantification is permitted only Dn set variables while in GB quantification 
is permitted on both set and class variables. As a result there are theorems in 
GB that are not theorems in ZF. It can however be proved that GB is a 
conservative extension of ZF in the sense that every well-formed formula 
(wff) of ZF is provable in ZF if and only if it is provable in GB. 
Godel's8 work was done in G6del-Bernays set theory. We, however, 
prefer Zermelo-Fraenkel theory in which Cohen9 worked.

CHAPTER 2 
Language and Logic 
The language of our theory consists of: 
Free variables: ao, a1' ... , 
Bound variables: xo, Xl' ... , 
A predicate symbol: E, 
Logical symbols: -', v, 1\, --+, ~, 'rI, 3, 
And auxiliary symbols: ( , ), [ , ]. 
The logical symbols, in the order listed, are for negation, disjunction, 
conjunction, implication, equivalence, universal quantification, and exist-
ential quantification. 
We will not restrict ourselves to a minimal list oflogical symbols, nor will 
we in general distinguish between primitive and defined logical symbols. 
When, in a given context, it is convenient to have a list of primitive symbols, 
we will assume whatever list best suits our immediate need. 
We will use 
a, b, c, 
as meta variables whose domain is the collection of free variables 
and we will use 
x, y, z, 
as metavariables whose domain is the collection of bound variables 
4 

2 Language and Logic 
5 
When we need many metavariables we will use subscripts and rely upon 
the context to make clear whether, for example, Xo is a particular bound 
variable of the formal language or a metavariable ranging over all bound 
variables of the formal language. 
We will use 
ep,t/I,11 
as metavariables that range over all well-formed formulas (wffs). 
Our rules for wffs are the following: 
(1) If a and b are free variables, then [a E b] is a wff. Such formulas are called 
atomic. 
(2) If ep and t/I are wffs, then rep, [ep v t/I], [ep /\ t/I], [ep --+ t/I], and [ep +-+ t/I], 
are wffs. 
(3) If ep is a wff and x is a bound variable, then (V x)ep(x) and (3 x)ep(x) are 
wffs, where ep(x) is the formula obtained from the wff ep by replacing each 
occurrence of some free variable a by the bound variable x. We call 
(V x)ep(x) and (3 x)ep(x) respectively, the formula obtained from ep by 
universally, or existentially, quantifying on the variable a. 
To simplify the appearance of wffs we will occasionally suppress certain 
grouping symbols. Our only requirement is that enough symbols be retained 
to assure the meaning: 
EXAMPLE. We will write ao E at for [aD E at] and instead of [[aD E ao] --+ 
[aD E at]] we will write simply ao E ao --+ ao Eat. 
EXAMPLE. From the wff ao E at we obtain the wff(3 x)[x E at] by existentially 
quantifying on ao. We obtain the wff(V y)[ao E y] by universally quantifying 
on at. And we obtain (V z)[ao E at] by universally quantifying on a2, or any 
other variable that does not occur in ao Eat. 
A formula is well formed if and only if its being so is deducible from rules 
(1)-(3) above. It is easily proved that there is an effective procedure for deter-
mining whether a given expression. i.e., sequence of symbols, is a wff. 
From the language just described we obtain Zermelo-Frankel set theory 
by adjoining logical axioms, rules of inference, and nonlogical axioms. The 
nonlogical axioms for ZF will be introduced in context and collected on 
pages 132-3. The logical axioms and the rules of inference for our theory are 
the following. 
Logical Axioms. 
(1) ep --+ [t/I-+ ep]. 
(2) [ep --+ [t/I --+ 11]] --+ [[ ep --+ t/I] --+ [ep --+ 11]J. 
(3) [rep --+ rt/l] --+ [t/I-+ ep].

Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
(4) ('r/ x)[cp -+ ljI(x)] -+ [cp -+ ('r/ x)ljI(x)] where the free variable a on which 
we are quantifying does not occur in cpo 
(5) (V x)cp(x) -+ cp(a) where cp(a) is the formula obtained by replacing each 
occurrence of the bound variable x in cp(x) by the free variable a. 
Rules of Inference. 
(1) From cp and cp -+ IjI to infer 1jI. 
(2) From cp to infer ('r/ x)cp(x) where cp(x) is obtained from cp by replacing 
each occurrence of some free variable by x. 
We will assume, without proof, those results from logic that we need, 
except one theorem. That theorem is proved on pages 114-6 and its proof 
presupposes the logical axioms and rules of inference set forth here. 
We will use the turnstile, r-, to indicate that a wff is a theorem. That is, 
f-cp is the metastatement that the wff cp is deducible, by the rules of inference, 
ftom the logical axioms above and the nonlogical axioms yet to be stated. 
To indicate that cp is deducible using only the logical axioms, we will write 
f- LA cpo We say that two wffs cp and IjI are logically equivalent if and only if 
r-LA cp +-'> 1jI.

o 
Remark. Our intuitive idea of equality is of course identity. A basic property 
that we expect of equality is that paraphrased as "equals may be substituted 
for equals," that is, if a = b then anything that can be asserted of a can also 
be asserted of b. In particular if a certain wffholds for a it must also hold for b 
and vice versa: 
a = b ---l- [<pea) ~ 
<pCb)]. 
Here ((J(b) is the formula obtained from <p by replacing each occurrence of 
some free variable by b, and <pea) is the formula obtained from <p by replacing 
each occurrence of the same free variable by a.

Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
We need not postulate such a substitution principle for, as we will now 
show, it can be deduced from Definition 3.1 and the following weaker 
principle. 
Axiom 1 (Axiom of Extensionality). 
a = b A a E C -> bE c. 
Proposition 3.3. a = b -> [a E C +-+ b E C]. 
PROOF. Axiom 1 and Proposition 3.2(2). 
Theorem 3.4. a = b -> [q>(a) +-+ q>(b)]. 
o 
PROOF (By induction on n the number of logical symbols in q». If n = 0, then 
q>(a) is of the form C E d, C E a, a E C, or a E a. Clearly 
a = b -> [c E d +-+ C E d]. 
From the definition of equality 
a = b -> [cEa+-+cEb]. 
From Proposition 3.3 
a = b -> [aEc+-+bEc]. 
Again from the definition of equality and Proposition 3.3 respectively 
a = b -> [aEa+-+aEb], 
a = b -> [aEb+-+bEb]. 
Therefore 
a = b -> [aEa+-+bEb]. 
As our induction hypothesis we assume the result true for each wffhaving 
fewer than n logical symbols. If n > ° 
and q>(a) has exactly n logical symbols, 
then q>(a) must be of the form 
(1) 
-,l/!(a), 
(2) 
l/!(a) A lJ(a), 
or (3) 
(V x)l/!(a, x). 
In Cases (1) and (2) l/!(a) and lJ(a) have fewer than n logical symbols and 
hence from the induction hypothesis 
a = b -> [l/!(a)+-+l/!(b)], 
a = b -> [1J(a)+-+IJ(b)]. 
From properties of negation and conjunction it then follows that 
a = b -> [-,l/!(a) +-+ -,l/!(b)] 
a = b -> [l/!(a) A lJ(a) +-+ l/!(b) A lJ(b)]. 

3 Equality 
9 
Thus if cp(a) is -, t{!(a) or t{!(a) 1\ 1J(a), 
a = b ...... [cp(a) +-+ cp(b)]. 
If cp(a) is (V x)t{!(a, x) we first choose a free variable e that is distinct from 
a and b and which does not occur in t{!(a, x). Since t{!(a, e) has fewer than n 
logical symbols it follows from the induction hypothesis that 
a = b ...... [t{!(a, e) +-+ t{!(b, e)]. 
Generalizing on e in this formula, using Logical Axiom 4, and the following 
result from logic 
(V x)[t{!(a, x) +-+ t{!(b, x)] ...... [(V x)t{!(a, x) +-+ (V x)t{!(b, x)] 
we arrive at the conclusion that 
o 
Remark. Extensionality assures us that a set is completely determined by its 
elements. From a casual acquaintance with this axiom one might assume that 
extensionality is a substitution principle having more to do with logic than 
set theory. This suggests that if equality were taken as a primitive notion 
then perhaps this axiom could be dispensed with. Dana Scottl however, has 
proved that this cannot be done without weakening the system. Thus, even 
if we were to take equality as a primitive logical notion it would still be 
necessary to add an extensionality axiom. 2

CHAPTER 4 
Classes 
We pointed out in the Introduction that one objective of axiomatic set 
theory is to avoid the classical paradoxes. One such paradox, the Russell 
paradox, arose from the naive acceptance of the idea that given any property 
there exists a set whose elements are those objects having the given property, 
i.e., given a wff cp containing one free variable, there exists a set that contains 
all objects for which cp holds and contains no object for which cp does not 
hold. More formally there exists a set a such that 
(V x)[x E a +-+ cp(x)]. 
This principle, called the Axiom of Abstraction, was accepted by Frege in 
his Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (1893). In a letter! to Frege (1902) Bertrand 
Russell pointed out that the principle leads to the following paradox. 
Consider the wff b if b. If there exists a set a such that 
(V x)[x E a +-+ x if x] 
then in particular 
a E a +-+ a if a. 
The idea of the collection of all objects having a specified property is so 
basic that we could hardly abandon it. But if it is to be retained how shall the 
paradox be resolved? The Zermelo-Fraenkel approach is the following. 
For each wff cp(a, a!, ... , an) we will introduce a class symbol 
1 van Heijenoort, Jean. From Frege to Godel. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967, 
pp. 124~125. 
10 

4 Classes 
11 
which is read "the class of all x such that cp(x, aI' ... , an)." Our principal 
interpretation is that the class symbol {x I cp(x)} denotes the class of individuals 
that have the property cp. We will show that class is an extension ofthe notion 
of set in that every set is a class but not every class is a set. 
We will extend the E-relation to class symbols in such a way that an object 
is an element ofa class {x I cp(x)} if and only if that object is a set and it has the 
defining property for the class. The Russell paradox is then resolved by show-
ing that {x I x rt x} is a proper class, i.e., a class that is not a set. It is then dis-
qualified for membership in any class, including itself, on the grounds that 
it is not a set. 
Were we to adjoin the symbols 
{xl cp(x)} 
to our object language it would be necessary to extend our rules for wffs and 
add axioms governing the new symbols. We choose instead to introduce 
classes as defined terms. It is, of course, essential that we provide an effective 
procedure for reducing to primitive symbols any formula that contains a 
defined term. We begin by defining the contexts in which class symbols are 
permitted to appear. Our only concern will be their appearance in wffs in the 
wider sense as defined by the following rules. 
Definition 4.1. (1) If a and b are free variables, then a E b is a wff in the wider 
sense. 
(2) If cp and t/I are wffs in the wider sense and a and b are free variables 
then a E {x I t/I(x)}, {x I cp(x)} E b, and {x I cp(x)} E {x I t/I(x)} are wffs in the 
wider sense. 
(3) If cp and t/I are wffs in the wider sense then -, cp, cp " t/I, cp v t/I, cp -+ t/I, 
and cp +-+ t/I are wffs in the wider sense. 
(4) If cp is a wff in the wider sense and x is a bound variable then (3 x )cp(x) 
and (V x)cp(x) are wffs in the wider sense. 
A formula is a wffin the wider sense iff its being so is deducible from (1)-(4). 
It is our intention that every wff in the wider sense be an abbreviation 
for a wff in the original sense. It is also our intention that a set belong to a 
class iff it has the defining property of that class, i.e., 
aE{xlcp(x)} 
iff cp(a). 
Definition 4.2. If cp and t/I are wffs in the wider sense then 
(1) aE{xlcp(x)} Acp(a). 
(2) 
{x I cp(x)} E a A (3 y)[y E a " (V z)[z E Y +-+ cp(z)]]. 
(3) 
{x I cp(x)} E {x I t/I(x)} A (3 y)[y E {x I t/I(x)} " (V z)[z E Y +-+ cp(z)]J.

Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
Remark. From Definition 4.2 it is easily proved that each wff in the wider 
sense cp is reducible to a wff cp* that is determined uniquely by the following 
rules. 
Definition 4.3. If cp and tjJ are wffs in the wider sense then 
(1) [aEb]*AaEb. 
(2) 
[a E {x I cp(x)}] * A cp*(a) A [cp(a)]*. 
(3) 
[{x I cp(x)} E a]* A (3 y)[y E a 1\ ('v' z)[z E y ~ cp*(z)]J. 
(4) 
[{x I cp(x)} E {x I tjJ(x)}]* A (3 y)[ tjJ*(y) 1\ ('v' z)[z E y ~ cp*(z)]]. 
(5) 
[-,cp]*A-,cp*. 
(6) 
[cp 1\ tjJ]*Acp* 1\ tjJ*. 
(7) 
[('v' x)cp(x)]* A ('v' x)cp*(x). 
Proposition 4.4. Each wff in the wider sense cp, is reducible to one and only 
one wff cp* determined from cp by the rules (1)-(7) of Definition 4.3. 
PROOF (By induction on n the number of logical symbols plus class symbols, 
in cp). If n = 0, i.e., if cp has no logical symbols or class symbols, then cp must 
be of the form a E b. By (1) of Definition 4.3, cp* is a E b. 
As our induction hypothesis we assume that each wff in the wider sense 
having fewer than n logical and class symbols is reducible to one and only 
one wffthat is determined by the rules (1)-(7) of Definition 4.3. If cp is a wff 
in the wider sense having exactly n logical and class symbols and if n > 0 then 
cp must be of one of the following forms: 
(1) aE {x I tjJ(x)} , 
(2) 
{x I tjJ(x)} E a, 
(3) 
{x I tjJ(x)} E {x I '1(x)} , 
(4) -, tjJ, 
(5) 
tjJ 1\ '1, 
(6) 
('v' x)tjJ. 
In each case tjJ and '1 have fewer than n logical and class symbols and hence 
there are unique wffs tjJ* and '1* determined by tjJ and '1 respectively and the 
rules (1)-(7) of Definition 4.3. Then by rules (2)-(7) cp determines a unique 
wff cp*. 
0 
Remark. From Proposition 4.4 every wff in the wider sense cp is an ab-
breviation for a wff cp*. The proof tacitly assumes the existence of an effective 
procedure for determining whether or not a given formula is a wff in the wider 
sense. That such a procedure exists we leave as an exercise for the reader. 
From such a procedure it is immediate that there is an effective procedure for 
determining cp* from cp. 

4 Classes 
13 
Proposition 4.4 also assures us that in Definitions 4.1 and 4.2 we have not 
extended the notion of class but have only extended the notation for classes 
for if qJ(x) is a wff in the wider sense then 
{xlqJ(x)}. 
and 
{X I qJ*(x)} 
are the same class. This is immediate from Proposition 4.4 and equality for 
classes which we now define. We wish this definition to encompass not only 
equality between class and class but also between set and class. For this, and 
other purposes, we introduce the notion of a term. 
By a term we mean a free variable or a class symbol. We shall use capital 
Roman letters 
A,B,C, ... 
as meta variables on terms. 
Definition 4.5. If A and B are terms then 
A = B A ('v' x)[x E A +-+x EB]. 
Proposition 4.6. A E B +-+ (3 x)[x = A 1\ X E B]. 
PROOF. Definitions 4.2 and 4.5. 
Proposition 4.7. If A, B, and C are terms then 
(1) 
A = A, 
(2) 
A = B -+ B = A, 
(3) 
A = B 1\ B = C -+ A = C. 
The proof is similar to that of Proposition 3.2 and is left to the reader. 
o 
Proposition 4.8. If A and B are terms and qJ is a wff in the wider sense, then 
A = B -+ [qJ(A) +-+ qJ(B)]. 
The proof is by induction. It is similar to the proof of Theorem 3.4 and is 
left to the reader. 
Proposition 4.9. a = {xIXEa}. 
PROOF. (V X)[X E a +-+ x E a]. 
o 
Remark. Proposition 4.9 establishes that every set is a class. We now wish 
to establish that not all classes are sets. We introduce the predicates .H(A) 
and Ph(A) for" A is a set" and" A is a proper class" respectively.

Remark. Since the Russell class, Ru, is a proper class the Russell paradox 
is resolved. It should be noted that the Russell class is the first nonset we have 
encountered. Others will appear in the sequel. 
We now have examples to show that the class of individuals for which a 
given wff <p holds may be a set or a proper class. Those sets, {x I <p(x)}, for 
which <p(x) contains no free variable, we call definable sets. 
As a notational convenience for the work ahead we add the following 
definitions.

CHAPTER 5 
The Elementary Properties of Classes 
[n this chapter we will introduce certain properties of classes with which 
the reader is probably familiar. The immediate consequences of the definitions 
are for the most part elementary and easily proved; consequently they will 
be left to the reader as exercises. 
We begin with the notion of unordered pair, {a, b}, and ordered pair 
<a, b). 
Definition 5.1. {a, b} ~ {xix = a v x = b}. 
{a} ~ {a, a}. 
Remark. The symbol {a, b} we read as "the pair a, b," and the symbol {a} 
we read as "singleton a." We postulate that pairs are sets. 
Axiom 2 (Axiom of Pairing). A( {a, b n. 
Definition 5.2. <a, b) ~ {xix = {a} v x = {a, b}}. 
Remark. We read <a, b) as "the ordered pair a, b." 
EXERCISES 
Prove the following. 
(1) cE{a,b}<--+c=avc=b. 
(2) 
C E {a} <--+ c = a. 
(3) 
cE(a,b)<--+c = {a} v c = {a,b}. 
(4) 
{a} = {b} <--+ a = b.

{a} = {b, c} <->a = b = c.

(a, b> = (c, d) <-> a = c /\ b = d. 
(7) At(a, b»). 
(8) 
('r/ x)[aEx ..... bEX] ..... a = b. 
(9) 
A E B ..... At(A). 
Remark. The notions of unordered pair and ordered pair have natural 
generalizations to unordered n-tuple, {aI, a2' ... , an} and ordered n-tuple, 
(ab a2' ... , an>· 
Remark. Since ordered pairs are sets it follows by induction that ordered 
n-tuples are also sets. From the fact that unordered pairs are sets we might 
also hope to prove by induction that unordered n-tuples are sets. For such a 
proof however we need certain properties of set union. 
Definition 5.5. u(A) ~ {x I (3 y)[x E Y /\ YEA]}. 
Axiom 3 (Axiom of Unions). vI/( u (a»). 
Definition 5.6. Au B ~ {xl XE A v X E B}. 
A (\ B ~ {XIXEA /\ xEB}. 
Remark. The symbol u(A) denotes the union of the members of A; we 
will read this symbol simply as "union A." We read A u B as "A union B" 
and we read A (\ B as "A intersect B." 
Proposition 5.7. a u b = u{a, b}. 
PROOF. a u b = {X I x E a v x = b} 
= {xl(3Y)[XEY /\ YE{a,b}]} 
= u({a, b}). 
Corollary 5.8. vI/(a u b). 
PROOF. Proposition 5.7, the Axiom of Unions, and the Axiom of Pairing.

Definition 5.9. A ~ B A (V x)[x E A --+ X E B]. 
A c B A A ~ B /\ A =I B. 
Definition 5.10. &(a) ~ {xix ~ a}. 
Remark. We read A ~ B as "A is a subclass of B"; A c B we read as 
"A is a proper subclass of B"; and we read &(a) as "the power set of a."

Remark. The Axiom of Abstraction asserts that the class of all individuals 
that have a given property cp, is a set. Using class variables we can state this 
simply as 
vIt(A). 
But, since the Axiom of Abstraction leads to Russell's paradox, we must 
reject it. 
Zermelo proposed to replace the Axiom of Abstraction by an axiom that 
asserts that the class of all individuals in a given set a that have a specified 
property cp, is a set. 
The Axiom Schema of Separation. 
vIt(a n A). 
It is easily shown that this axiom does not lead to the Russell paradox. 
Zermelo's set theory, as presented in 1908, consisted essentially of our 
Axioms 1-4, the Axiom Schema of Separation, an axiom of infinity, (See 
Axiom 7, page 43), and an axiom of choice. The theory we are developing 
differs from Zermelo's theory of 1908 in two respects. First, for the con-
sistency proofs of Chapter 15, we must exclude the axiom of choice from the 
list of axioms of our basic theory. Second, Zermelo's Axiom of Separation is 
replaced by a much stronger axiom due to Fraenkel. 
In 1922, Fraenkel proposed a modification of Zermelo's theory in which 

5 The Elementary Properties of Classes 
19 
the Axiom Schema of Separation is replaced by an axiom that asserts that 
functions map sets onto sets. 1 
The condition that a wff <pea, b) should define a function, i.e., that 
{<x, y) I <p(x, y)} 
should be a single valued relation is simply that 
('V x, y, z)[<p(x, y) /\ <p(x, z) --+ y = z]. 
If this is the case and if 
A = {xl(3y)<p(x,y)} 
and 
B = {y I (3 x)<p(x, y)} 
then the function in question maps A onto B and by Fraenkel's axiom maps 
a n A onto a subset of B. That is 
Jt({yl(3x E a)<p(x, y)}).

[('V x)('V y)('V z)[<p(x, y) /\ <p(x, z) --+ y = z] --+ Jt({yl(3x E a)<p(x, y)})]. 
Remark. From Fraenkel's axiom we can easily deduce Zermelo's. The two 
are however not equivalent. Indeed Richard Montague has proved that ZF 
is not a finite extension of Zermelo set theory.2 
Proposition 5.11 (Zermelo's Schema of Separation). 
Jt(a n A) 
PROOF. Applying Axiom 5 to the wff bE A /\ b = c where band c do not 
occur in A, we have that 
('V x, y, z)[x E A /\ X = y] /\ [x E A /\ X = z] --+ y = z. 
1 This same idea was formulated, independently, by Thoralf Skolem, also in 1922.

Definition 5.12. A - B ~ {x Ix E A /\ X ¢ B}. 
Remark. The class A - B is called the complement of B relative to A

Remark. To exclude the possibility that a set can be an element of itself 
and also to exclude the possibility of having "E-loops," i.e., al E a2 E· ..

Axiom of Foundation, which asserts that every nonempty set a contains an

element x with the property that no element of x is also an element of a. A 
stronger form of this axiom asserts the same property of nonempty classes. 
Later we will prove that the weak and strong forms are in fact equivalent. 
Axiom 6 (Axiom of Regularity, weak form).

PROOF. 
Let a = {ai, a2' ... , an}. Suppose that al E a2 E··· E an E al. Then 
(\I x)[x E a -+ x n a =F 0]. This contradicts Regularity. 
Corollary 5.19. a ¢ a. 
PROOF. Proposition 5.18 with n = 1. 
D 
Definition 5.20. V ~ {x I x = x}. 
Proposition 5.21. glI-t(V). 
PROOF. Since V = V it follows that if V is a set, then V E V. 
D 
Remark. From the strong form of Regularity we can deduce the following 
induction principle. 
Proposition 5.22. (\I x)[x ~ A -+ X E A] -+ A = V. 
PROOF. Assume that (\I x)[x ~ A -+ X E A]. If B = V -
A and if B =F 0 then 
by (strong) Regularity there exists a set a such that 
aEB/\anB=O 
that is 
(\I y)[y E a -+ y ¢ B]. 
But since B = V - A, 
(\ly)[y¢B -+ YEA]. 
Thus a ~ A and hence, by our hypothesis, a E A. But this contradicts the 
fact that a E B. Therefore B = 0 and A = V. (See Exercise (1) below.) 
D 
Remark. Proposition 5.22 assures us that if every set a has a certain prop-
erty, <pea), whenever each element of a has that property then every set does 
indeed have the property. Consider the following example. If each element of 

22

a set a has no infinite descending E-chain then clearly a has no infinite des-
cending E-chain. Therefore there are no infinite descending E-chains.

Remark. We read E0(A) and if'(A) as "domain of A" and "range of A" 
respectively. 
It should be noted that a class does not have to be a relation in order 
to have a domain and a range. Indeed every class has both. The domain of A 
is simply the class of first entries of those ordered pairs that are in A and the 
range of A is the class of second entries of those ordered pairs that are in A.

Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
Proposition 6.7. OU:n(A) --+ .A(A"a). 
PROOF. From Definition 6.4(2) 
OU:n(A) +-+ (\I x)(\1 y)(\1 z)[ <x, y) E A II. <x, z) E A --+ Y = z]. 
Then from the Axiom Schema of Replacement it follows that 
{yl(3xEa)[<x, y) EA]} 
is a set, that is, A"a is a set. 
o 
Remark. Proposition 6.7 assures us that single valued relations, i.e., func-
tions, map sets onto sets. 
Corollary 6.S. 
(1) 
.A(a- l ). 
(2) 
.A(~(a)). 
(3) .A (1r(a) ). 
PROOF. (1) If A = {«x, y), <y, x» lx, y E V}, then A is single valued and 
hence by Proposition 6.7, A"a is a set. But A"a = a-I; therefore a-l is a set. 
(2) If A = {«x,y),x) Ix,y E V}, then A is single valued and A"a = ~(a). 
(3) 
If A = {«x,y),y)IX,YEV}, then A is single valued and A"a = 1r(a). o 
Corollary 6.9. 
(1) 
.A(A x B) +-+ .A(B x A). 
(2) 
&'-t(A) II. B "# 0 --+ &'-t(A x B) II. &'-t(B x A). 
PROOF. (1) Suppose C = {«x, y), <y, x» I x, y E V}. Then C is single valued, 
C"(A x B) = (B x A) and C"(B x A) = (A x B). 
(2) If B"#O, then (3Y)[YEB]. Let C= {«x, y), X)IXEA}. Then 
C is single valued and ~(C) ~ A x B. Assuming that A x B is a set it follows 
that ~(C) is a set. But A = C"~(C) and hence, by Proposition 6.7, A is a set. 
From this contradiction we conclude that A x B is a proper class and hence 
by (1) so is B x A.

Definition 6.10. (3! x)cp(x) A (3 x)cp(x) II. (\I x, y)[cp(x) II. cp(y) --+ X = y].

Definition6.11.A'b ~ {xl(3Y)[XEY II. <b,Y)EA] II. (3!y)[<b,Y)EA]}. 
Remark. We read A'b as "the value of A at b."

Proposition 6.12. 
(1) 
(b, c) E A /\ (3! y)[ (b, y) E A] --+ A'b = c. 
(2) 
-,(3! y)[(b, y) EA] --+ A'b = O. 
PROOF. (1) From Definition 6.11, (b, c) EA 1\ (3! y)[(b, y) EA] implies 
a E A'b +-+ a E c 
i.e., A'b = c. 
(2) From Definition 6.11, -,(3! y)[(b, y) EA] implies 
('r/ x)[x ¢ A'b] 
i.e., A 'b = O. 
27 
o 
Remark. From Proposition 6.12 we see that Definition 6.11 is an extension 
of the notion of function value. If A is a function and if b is in ~(A) then A'b 
is the value of A at b in the usual sense. If b is not in ~(A) then A'b = O. If A 
is not a function A'b is still defined. Indeed if b is not in ~(A) then A'b = O. If 
b is in ~(A) but there are two different ordered pairs in A with first entry b 
then again A'b = o. If b is in ~(A) and (b, c) is the only ordered pair in A 
with first entry b then A'b = c. 
Coronary 6.13. Jt(A'b). 
PROOF. Proposition 6.12 assures us that (3 y)[A'b = y].

(1) 
{A'xlxEB} ~ {yl(3xEB)[y = A'x]}. 
(2)

Remark. We read {A'xlxEB} as "the class of all A'x such that xEB," 
and we read 
UA'x

as "the union of all A'x for x E B."

A fl' n2 B as " A is a one-to-one function on B," 
F: A --+ B as "F maps A into B," 
F: A onto' Bas" F maps A onto B,"

Theorem 6.16. 
(1) 
A fl'n a --+ V#(A). 
(2) 
A fl' n2 a --+ V#(A). 
PROOF. (1) If A is a function on a, then A ~ a x A"a and A is single valued. 
But if A is single valued, then by Proposition 6.7, A"a is a set, and so by 
Proposition 6.2, a x A"a is a set. Since A ~ a x A"a, it then follows that 
A is a set. 
(2) If A is a one-to-one function on a, then A is a function on a and 
hence A is a set by (1). 
0 
Proposition 6.17. 'Wn(A) --+ V#(A ~ a). 
PROOF. If A is single valued, then certainly A ~ a is single valued. Since, by 
Definition 6.6(1), A ~ a is a relation, it follows that A ~ a is a function on 
~(A ~ a). Furthermore, since ~(A ~ a) ~ a it follows that ~(A ~ a) is a 
set. Then by Proposition 6.16(1), A ~ a is a set.

Remark. In later chapters we will study structures consisting of a class 
A on which is defined a relation R, i.e., R ~ A2. Since for any class B, B n 
A 2 ~ A 2 we see that every class B determines a relation on A in a very 
natural way. We therefore choose to begin our discussion with a very general 
theory of ordered pairs of classes [A, R] that we will call relational systems. 
Definition 6.18. aRb A <a, b) E R. 
Remark. We read aRb simply as "a R b." 
In the material ahead we will be interested in several types of relational 
systems, [A, R]. We will be interested in systems in which R orders A and 
systems in which R partially orders A, in the following sense. 
Definition 6.19. 
(1) ROrAA('v'x,YEA)[xRy+-+-,[x = y v yRx]] /\ 
('v' x, y, Z E A)[x R Y /\ Y R Z ~ x R Z]. 
(2) 
R PoA A ('v' xEA)[xRx] /\ ('v' x,YEA)[x R y /\ Y R x ~ x = y] /\ 
('v' x, y, Z E A)[x R y /\ Y R Z ~ x R Z]. 
Remark. There are several properties of relational systems whose proofs 
depend upon the classes of R-predecessors: 
{xix R a} 
Proposition 6.20. (R-l)"{a} = {xlxRa}. 
PROOF. (R-l)"{a} = {xl<a,x)ER- 1 } 
= {x I <x, a)R} 
= {xix R a}. 
D 
Remark. From Proposition 6.20 we see that An (R-l)"{a} = 0 means 
that no element of A precedes a in the sense of R. If, in addition, a E A then a 
is an R-minimal element of A. We wish to consider relations with respect 
to which each subclass of a given class has an R-minimal element. Such a 
relation we call afounded relation. Since we cannot quantify on class symbols 

30 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
we must formulate our definition in terms of subsets and impose additional 
conditions that will enable us to deduce the property for subclasses. Later 
we will show that these additional conditions are not essential. 
Definition 6.21. 
R Fr A A (\f x)[x ~ A /\ x#-O --+ (3 y EX)[X 1\ (R-I)"{y} = 0]]. 
Remark. We read F Fr A as "F is a founded relation on A." 
Definition 6.22. E ~ {(x, y) Ix E y}. 
Remark. From the Axiom of Regularity we see that the E-relation E is a 
founded relation on V. As in the case of theE-relation, founded relations have 
no relational loops and, as we will prove later, no infinite descending rela-
tional chains. 
Proposition 6.23. 
R Fr A /\ al E A /\ ... /\ an E A --+ ...., [al R a2 /\ a2 R a3 /\ ... /\ an R al ]. 
The proof is left to the reader. 
Remark. There are two types of founded relations that are of special 
interest, the well-founded relations and the well-ordering relations. 
Definition 6.24. 
(1) 
R Wfr A A R Fr A /\ (\f X E A)[vU(A 1\ (R -I)"{X})]. 
(2) 
R We A A R Fr A /\ (\f X E A)(\f Y E A)[x R Y v x = y v y R x]. 
(3) RWfweAARWfrA /\ RWeA. 
Remark. Note that R is a founded relation on A iff each nonempty subset 
of A has an R-minimal element. Furthermore, R is a well-founded relation on 
A iff each nonempty subset of A has an R-minimal element and each R-
initial segment of A is a set. By an R-initial segment of A we mean the class 
of all elements in A that R-precede a given element of A, i.e., A 1\ (R -I)" {a} 
for a EA. For example, each E-initial segment of V is a set, indeed 
(E-I)"{a} = {xlxEa} = a. 
Then (\fx)[a 1\ x = a 1\ (E-l)"{X}J and hence from the Axiom of Regularity 
a#-O --+ (3 x E a)[a 1\ (E-I)"{x} = OJ 
that is, E is well founded on V. 
There do exist founded relations that are not well founded. Let A be the 
class of all finite sets and for a, b E A define aRb to mean that a has fewer 

6 Functions and Relations 
31 
elements than b. Given any nonempty collection of finite sets there is a set 
in the collection that has the least number of elements. Thus R is founded 
on A. However the R-initial segment of A that contains all finite sets that 
R-precede a given doubleton set contains all singleton sets hence is a proper 
class. Thus R is not well founded on A. 
R is a well ordering of A iff R determines an R-minimal element for each 
nonempty subset of A and the elements in A are pairwise R-comparable. If 
there were elements a, bE A that were not R-comparable, i.e., neither aRb 
nor bRa, then both a and b would be R-minimal elements of {a, b}. Con-
versely if a and bare R-comparable then a and b cannot both be R-minimal 
elements of the same set. Thus if R well orders A then R determines a unique 
R-minimal element for each nonempty subset of A. That R is a transitive 
relation satisfying trichotomy we leave to the reader: 
Proposition 6.25. R We A --+ R Or A. 
EXERCISES 
(1) 
R Fr A /\ B ~ A -> R Fr B. 
(2) 
R Fr a -> R Wfr a. 
(3) 
R Wfr A /\ B ~ A -> R Wfr B. 
(4) R We A /\ B ~ A -> R We B. 
(5) 
R We A -> 01 x, Y E A)[ x R y -> -, [x = y v Y R x]]. 
(6) 
R We A -> 01 x, y, Z E A)[x R y /\ Y R Z -> x R z]. 
Remark. If a relation R well orders a class A, does it follow that R deter-
mines an R-minimal element for every nonempty subclass of A? If R is a 
well-founded well ordering of A, i.e., R Wfwe A then the answer is, Yes: 
Proposition 6.26. 
RWfweA 1\ B ~ A 1\ B #- 0--+ (3XEB)[Bn(R-1)"{x} = 0]. 
PROOF. If B is not empty, then B contains an element b. If B n (R -1)" {b} = 0, 
then b is the set we seek. But suppose that B n (R - 1)" {b} #- o. If in addition 
B ~ A and R is a well-founded well ordering of A, then R is also a well-
founded well ordering of B. Since b E B it follows that B n (R - 1)" {b} is a set. 
In fact, it is a subset of B and hence it has an R-minimal element. that is, 
there exists an a such that 
aEB n (R-l)"{b} 1\ B n (R-1)"{b} n (R-1)"{a} = O. 
From this it follows that a E B and aRb. Then, since R is a transitive relation 
B n (R- 1)"{a} ~ B n (R-1)"{b} n (R-1)"{a} 

32 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
and since B n (R-I)"{b} n (R-I)"{a} = 0, it follows that B n (R-I)"{a} 
= O. Consequently 
aEB /\ Bn(R-I)"{a} = 0 
that is 
(3XEB)[Bn(R-I)"{X} = 0]. 
D 
Proposition 6.27. 
R WfweA /\ B ~ A /\ (VxEA)[A n (R-I)"{x} ~ B -> xEBJ -> A = B. 
PROOF. If A - B :f 0 then by Proposition 6.26 
(3XEA -
B)[(A -
B) n (R-I)"{x} = OJ 
then 
An (R-I)"{x} ~ B. 
Since x E A it follows from hypothesis that x E B. But this contradicts the 
fact that x E A - B. 
Therefore A -
B = 0 that is A ~ B. Since by hypothesis B ~ A we con-
clude that A = B. 
D 
Remark. Proposition 6.27 is an induction principle. To prove that 
(V x E A)cp(x), we consider 
B = {xEAlcp(x)}. 
If for any R that is a well-founded well ordering on A we can prove 
(VxEA)[A n (R-I)"{X} ~ B -> xEBJ 
it then follows that A = B, i.e. (V x EA)cp(x). 
Later it will be shown that Propositions 6.26 and 6.27 are over hypoth-
esized. We will prove that the hypothesis R Wfwe A can be replaced by 
R Fr A. See Propositions 9.21 and 9.22 pages 80-1. 
Clearly two relational systems [A, RIJ and [A, R2J are essentially the 
same if RI and R2 have the same relational part in common with A 2, i.e., if 
A2 n RI = A2 n R2. Even if RI and R2 do not have the same relational 
part there is a sense in which the two relational systems are equivalent. They 
may be equivalent in the sense that there exists an isomorphism between the 
two relational systems.

Remark. Proposition 6.30 assures us that isomorphism between relational 
systems is an equivalence relation. From Proposition 6.31 we see that such 
isomorphisms preserve minimal elements and preserve initial segments. 
From this it is easy to prove the following. Details are left to the reader. 
Proposition 6.32. If H IsomR"R2(Al> A 2 ), then 
(1) 
RI Fr At +-+ R2 Fr A2, 
(2) RI Wfr A1 +-+R2 Wfr A2, 
(3) RI We Al +-+ R2 We A2. 
Remark. From Proposition 6.32 we see that if in a given equivalence 
class of isomorphic relational systems, there is a relational system that is 
founded then every relational system in that equivalence class is founded. 
Similarly if there is a relational system that is well founded then all systems 
in that class are well founded; if one system is a well ordering all are well 
orderings. 

34 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
Each equivalence class represents a particular type of ordering. Suppose 
that we are given a particular type of ordering, [Al' R1J with Rl ~ Ai and 
a class A2, can we define an ordering on A2 ofthe same type, that is, can we 
define a relation R2 ~ A~ such that the ordering [Al' R1J is order isomorphic 
to the ordering [A2' R2]? 
From the definition of order isomorphism we see that it is necessary that 
there exist a one-to-one correspondence between Al and A 2 • This is also 
sufficient. 
Proposition 6.33. If 
H:Al !:!,A2 1\ R2 = {(H'x,H'y)lxEA l 1\ yEAl 1\ (x,y)ER1} 
then 
The proof is left to the reader. 
Remark. The relation R2 in Proposition 6.33 is said to be induced on A2 
by the one-to-one function H and the relation R 1, on A l' The proposition 
assures us that if a one-to-one correspondence exists between two classes 
then any type of ordering that can be defined on one class can also be defined 
on the other class. While this is a very useful result it leaves unanswered the 
question of what types of relations are definable on a given class A. Are there 
founded relations definable on A? Are there well-founded relations on A? 
Can A be well ordered? The first two questions are easily answered because 
the E-relation is well founded on A. 
The last question is the most interesting. From the work of Paul Cohen 
we know that the question of whether or not every set can be well ordered, is 
undecidable in ZF. We will have more to say on this subject later.

CHAPTER 7 
Ordinal Numbers 
The theory of ordinal numbers is essentially a theory of well-ordered sets. 
For Cantor an ordinal number was "the general concept which results from 
(a well-ordered aggregate) M if we abstract from the nature of its elements 
while retaining their order of precedence .... " It was Gottlob Frege (1848-
1925) and Bertrand Russell (1872-1970), working independently, who re-
moved Cantor's numbers from the realm of psychology. In 1903 Russell 
defined an ordinal number to be an equivalence class of well-ordered sets 
under order isomorphism. Russell's definition has a certain intuitive appeal. 
By his definition the ordinal number one is the class of all well-ordered 
singleton sets, the ordinal number two is the class of all well-ordered double-
ton sets, etc. But this definition has a serious defect from the point of view of 
ZF set theory because the class of all singleton sets is a proper class, as is the 
class of all doubleton sets, etc. For our purposes we would like ordinal num-
bers to be sets and to acheive this we take a different approach from that of 
Russell. 
Our approach is that of von Neumann. We choose to define ordinal 
numbers to be particular members of equivalence classes rather than the 
equivalence classes themselves. The particular sets that we choose to be our 
ordinal numbers are sets that are well ordered by the E-relation and which are 
transitive in the following sense. 
Definition 7.1. Tr(A) A (V x E A)[x ~ A]. 
Remark. We read Tr(A) as "A is transitive." 
Proposition 7.2. Tr(A) /\ BE A --+ B c A. 
35 

36 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
PROOF. If BE A, then B is a set. If in addition A is transitive, then by Definition 
7.1, B ~ A. But B = A implies that A E A which contradicts Corollary 
5.19. Consequently B c A. 
0 
Remark. In spite of our claim that we are going to define ordinal numbers 
to be sets we begin by defining ordinal classes. 
Definition 7.3. Ord(A) A Tr(A) 1\ (V x, Y E A)[x E Y V X = Y v Y EX]. 
Remark. We read Ord(A) as" A is an ordinal." 
Since, by the Axiom of Regularity, the E-relation E is founded, indeed 
well founded, on every class, it follows that E well orders every ordinal. 
Proposition 7.4. Ord(A) --+ EWe A. 
PROOF. Obvious from Definitions 7.3, 6.24(2), 6.21, and Axiom 6'. 
0 
Remark. Proposition 7.4 assures us that every subset of an ordinal class A 
has an E-minimal element. We can in fact prove a stronger result, namely that 
every subclass of an ordinal A has an E-minimal element: 
Proposition 7.5. Ord(A) 1\ B ~ A 1\ B t= 0 --+ (3 x E B)[B (1 x = 0]. 
PROOF. From Proposition 7.4, E well orders A. Since E is also well founded 
on A, i.e., E is founded and E-initial segments of A are sets, it follows from 
Proposition 6.26 that B has an E-minimal element, i.e., 
(3 x E B)[B (1 (E- 1)"{x} = 0]. 
But (E- 1),,{x} = x. 
o 
Proposition 7.6. Ord(A) 1\ a E A --+ Ord(a). 
PROOF. Since A is transitive a E A implies a ~ A. Consequently if b, C E a, then 
b, C E A and hence, since A is an ordinal, 
bEcvb=cVCEb 
that is, 
(V x, Y E a)[x E Y V X = Y v Y E x]. 
It then remains to prove that a is transitive, i.e., that b E a implies b ~ a. 
Toward this end we note that if C E b, then since A is transitive, c, a E A and 
hence 
C E a v C = a v a E c. 

7 Ordinal Numbers 
37 
But c = a /\ C E b /\ b E a and a E C /\ C E b /\ bE a each contradict Proposi-
tion 5.18, and so we conclude that C E a. Thus, having shown that 
cEb--+CEa 
we have proved that 
bE a --+ b ~ a. 
Consequently we have shown that a is transitive and hence a is an ordinal. 
D 
Remark. We now wish to prove that the E-relation also well orders the 
class of ordinal sets. From this and Proposition 7.6 it will then follow that the 
class of ordinal sets is an ordinal class. 
Proposition 7.7. Ord(A) /\ Tr(B) --+ [B c A +-+ B E A]. 
PROOF. Since A is an ordinal, A is transitive and so by Proposition 7.2 
BEA --+ Be A. 
Conversely if B c A, then A - B #- O. From Proposition 7.5, A - B has 
an E-minimal element b, that is, 
(b E A - B) /\ (A - B) n b = O. 
Clearly b E A. To prove that B E A we will prove that B = b. Toward this end 
we note that since bE A and A is transitive b c A. But (A - B) n b = 0, 
and so b ~ B. 
To prove that B ~ b we observe that if C E B then, since B c A, C EA. But 
A is an ordinal class and b E A. Therefore 
C E b v C = b v b E c. 
From the transitivity of B we see that [b E C v b = cJ /\ C E B implies that 
bE B. But this contradicts the fact that bE A-B. We conclude that C E b, 
that is, B ~ b. 
Then b = B /\ b E A; hence B E A. 
D 
Corollary 7.8. Ord(A) /\ Ord(B) --+ [B c A +-+ B E A]. 
PROOF. Ord(B) --+ Tr(B). 
D 
Remark. Among other things Propositions 7.6 and 7.7 assure us that a 
transitive subclass of an ordinal is an ordinal. 
Proposition 7.9. Ord(A) /\ Ord(B) --+ Ord(A n B). 

38 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
PROOF. We first note that An B ~ A. Furthermore, since A and B are transi-
tive 
aEAnB--+aEA 1\ aEB 
--+acAl\acB 
--+ a cAn B. 
Therefore An Bis a transitive subclass of the ordinal A and hence by Proposi-
tions 7.6 and 7.7, A n B is an ordinal class. 
D 
Proposition 7.10. Ord(A) 1\ Ord(B) --+ [A E B v A = B v BE A]. 
PROOF. We first observe that A n B ~ A 1\ A n B ~ B. If A nBc A 1\ 
An Be B, then A n BE A 1\ An BE B (Propositions 7.9 and 7.7) hence 
A n BE A n B. But this contradicts Proposition 5.18. Therefore A n B = A 
or A n B = B, i.e., A ~ B or B ~ A. Hence, by Corollary 7.8 
A E B v A = B v BE A. 
D 
Definition 7.11. On ~ {xIOrd(x)}. 
Proposition 7.12. Ord(On). 
PROOF. From Proposition 7.6, 
a E On --+ a ~ On 
i.e., On is transitive. From Propositions 7.6 an'd 7.10 
(\fx,YEOn)[xEY v x = Y v YEX]. 
Therefore, by Definition 7.3, On is an ordinal. 
Proposition 7.13. &'-t(On). 
D 
PROOF. Were On a set it would follow that On E On. But this contradicts 
Proposition 5.18. 
D 
Corollary 7.14. Ord(A) --+ A E On v A = On. 
PROOF. From Propositions 7.10 and 7.12, A E On v A = On v On E A. 
But since On is a proper class we cannot have On E A. 
D 
Corollary 7.15. Ord(A) --+ A ~ On. 
PROOF. Corollary 7.14, Proposition 7.12 and Corollary 7.8. 
D 
Remark. The elements of On are the ordinal numbers in our system. 
We have proved that every ordinal class is an ordinal number except one, 
On. The ordinal numbers play such an important role in the theory ahead 
that we find it convenient to use the symbols 
IX, {3, y, ... 

7 Ordinal Numbers 
39 
as variables on ordinal numbers. We will not distinguish between free and 
bound variables except that we will not use the same symbol for both a free 
and a bound variable in the same formula. We will rely upon the reader to 
make a proper interpretation offormulas involving ordinal variables, subject 
to the following definition. 
Definition 7.16. 
(1) 
cp(ex) A [Ord(x) -+ cp(x)J 
(2) 
(V ex)cp(ex) A (V x)[Ord(x)-+ cp(x)J 
(3) (3 ex)cp(ex) A (3 x)[Ord(x) /\ cp(x)]. 
Remark. Definition 7.16 is deliberately ambiguous and intended to shift 
attention away from certain formal details that should no longer require 
attention. We, thereby, hope to be able to focus more intently on the informa-
tion that Our formulas convey. But if called upon to explain in what sense 
Definition 7.16 is a definition, that is, to explain for example, what formula 
(V ex)cp(ex) is an abbreviation for, we would do so by standardizing our list of 
ordinal variables, 
free variables: exo, ex l , ... , 
bound variables: Po, PI, ... , 
and specifying that 
CP(Pn) is [Ord(an) -+ cp(an)J 
(V exn)cp(exn) is (V xn)[Ord(xn) -+ cp(xn)J 
(3 exn)cp(exn) is (3 xn)[Ord(xn) /\ cp(xn)]. 
Having now made it clear that matters can be set straight, we will not 
bother to do so here or in similar definitions to follow. 
Theorem 7.17 (The Principle of Transfinite Induction). If (1) A ~ On and 
(2) ('vex) [ex ~ A -+ ex E A], then A = On. 
PROOF. To prove that A = On, given that A ~ On, it is sufficient to prove 
that On ~ A. Suppose that On is not a subclass of A. Then On - A -# ° and 
hence by Propositions 7.12 and 7.5. (3 ex E On - A)[(On - A) n ex = OJ. 
Since ex c: On it follows that ex ~ A. Then by (2), ex E A. But this contradicts 
the fact that ex E On - A. Therefore Ort - A = 0, i.e., On ~ A. Then from 
(1), A = On.

(14) 
IX = max(lX, f3) v f3 = max(lX, f3). 
Proposition 7.19. A ~ On ~ Ord(u(A)). 
PROOF. If A ~ On, then since by Proposition 7.6, elements of ordinals are 
ordinals, it follows that 
u(A) ~ On. 
Furthermore if a E u(A) then, from the definition of union, there exists a 
set b such that 
aEb A bEA. 
But since b is an ordinal, and hence is transitive, we have 
a ~ b A bEA. 
Consequently 
a ~ u(A). 
Thus u(A) is a transitive subclass of the ordinal On and hence u(A) is an 
ordinal.

Proposition 7.20. A ~ On A a E A ~ a ~ u(A). 

7 Ordinal Numbers 
PROOF. By Proposition 7.19 u(A) is an ordinal. Furthermore 
0: E A -+ 0: ~ u(A) 
-+ 0: ~ u(A). 
Proposition 7.21. A ~ On /\ (V 13 E A)[f3 ~ 0:] -+ u(A) ~ 0:. 
41 
o 
PROOF. If 13 E u(A), then (3 y) [13 < y /\ YEA]. Therefore 13 < y /\ Y ~ 0:. 
Hence 13 < 0:, that is, u(A) ~ 0:. 
0 
Remark. Proposition 7.20 assures us that u(A) is an upper bound for the 
class of ordinals A. Proposition 7.21 assures us that u(A) is also the smallest 
upper bound for A. Furthermore if A has a maximal ordinal, that is if 
(30: E A)(V 13 E A) [13 ~ 0:] then 0: = u(A) and hence u(A) E A. If A has no 
maximal element then u(A) ¢: A. In particular if A is an ordinal number, i.e. 
(30:) [0: = A] and if u(o:)¢: 0: then u(o:) = 0:. Such an ordinal is called a 
limit ordinal. 
Definition 7.22. 0: + 1 ~ 0: U {o:}. 
EXAMPLE. ° + 1 = ° 
u {a} = {O} ~ 1. 
1 + 1 = 1 u {1} = {a} u {l} = {a, 1} ~ 2. 
Proposition 7.23. (V 0:)[0: E 0: + 1 /\ 0: ~ 0: + 1]. 
PROOF. We need only observe that 0: E (0: U {o:}) /\ 0: ~ (0: U {o:}). 
0 
Proposition 7.24. (V 0:)[0: + 1 EOn]. 
PROOF. Since (V 0:)[0: E On /\ 0: ~ On] it follows that 0: + 1 ~ On. Further-
more if a E 0: + 1, then a E 0: or a = 0: and hence a ~ 0:. But 0: ~ 0: + 1, hence 
a ~ 0: + 1. Thus 0: + 1 is a transitive subset of an ordinal class hence 0: + 1 
is an ordinal, that is, 0: + 1 EOn. 
0 
Proposition 7.25. -, [0: < 13 < 0: + 1]. 
PROOF. If 0: < 13 /\ 13 < 0: + 1 then 0: E 13 /\ [13 E 0: v 13 = 0:]. But this con-
tradicts Proposition 5.18. 
0 
Proposition 7.26. a c On -+ (V 0: E a)[o: < u(a) + 1]. 
PROOF. From Propositions 7.19 and 7.20, u(a) is an ordinal and 0: ~ u(a). 
From Proposition 7.23 we then conclude that 0: < u(a) + 1. 
0 
Remark. Proposition 7.26 assures us that given any ordinal number there 
is an ordinal number that is larger, indeed given any set of ordinal numbers 
there is an ordinal number that is larger than each element of the given set. 
The naive acceptance of On as a set would then lead to the paradox of the 

42 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
largest ordinal, that is, the existence of an ordinal number that is larger than 
every ordinal including itself. This paradox was discovered by Cantor in 1895. 
It first appeared in print in 1897 having been rediscovered by Burali-Forti, 
whose names it now bears.

negative integers as we will now show by proving that they satisfy the Peano

PROOF. (1) From Definition 7.27 we have that 0 E K 1. Therefore 0 u {O} ~ KI 
hence 0 E OJ. 
(2) 
Since i + 1 E KI and since i E OJ -+ i + 1 ~ KI it follows that (i + 1)

Clearly i E i + 1. Therefore i + 1 ¥= O.

1\ j = i each contradict Proposition 5.18 we conclude that i = j. 
(5) 
If OJ -
A ¥= 0 then there is a smallest element i in OJ -
A. This 
smallest element is not 0 because, by hypothesis 0 E A and hence 0 ¢ OJ -
A. 
Furthermore i E OJ and OJ ~ K 1, therefore i E K 1• It then follows, from the 
definition of KI and the fact that i ¥= 0, that (3 fJ)[i = fJ + 1]. Furthermore 
i ~ i + 1 and i + 1 ~ K 1• Therefore fJ + 1 ~ K 1, and hence fJ E OJ. Since 
fJ < i and i is the smallest element in OJ -
A we must have fJ ¢ OJ -
A. 
Consequently, fJ E A. But by hypothesis fJ E OJ 1\ fJ E A implies fJ + 1 E A, 
that is, i E A. This is a contradiction that forces us to conclude that OJ ~ A. 
D 
Corollary 7.31 (The Principle of Finite Induction). If A ~ OJ 1\ 0 E A 1\ 
(\I i)[i E A -+ i + 1 E A] then A = OJ. 
PROOF. Obvious from Proposition 7.30. 
D 
Proposition 7.:52. Ord( OJ ). 
PROOF. Since OJ ~ KI and KI ~ On it follows that OJ ~ On. Furthermore if 
a E band b E OJ, then b is an ordinal and b + 1 ~ K 1. Then a ~ b, b ~ b + 1 
and b + 1 ~ K 1• Therefore a E KI and a ~ Kb consequently a u {a} ~ K 1• 
Thus a E OJ and hence OJ is transitive. Since OJ is a transitive subclass of an 
ordinal, OJ is an ordinal. 
D 
Remark. From Proposition 7.32 we see that either OJ E On or OJ = On. 
But which of these alternatives is true? The question is whether or not OJ 
is a set. This cannot be resolved by the axioms stated thus far. We choose to 
resolve the issue by postulating that OJ is a set. 
Axiom 7 (Axiom ofInfinity). A(OJ). 
Proposition 7.33. OJ E K II. 
PROOF. From Axiom 7 and Proposition 7.32 we have that OJ E On. Since

OJ E K II .

Proposition 7.34. F Ji' n W -+ (3 n) [F'(n + 1)ft Pn]. 
PROOF. From the Axiom of Infinity, F is a function whose domain is a set. 
Therefore the range of F, "fI/(F), is a set. Then from the Axiom of Regularity 
there exists a set a in "fI/(F) such that 
"fI/(F) Il a = O. 
But since a E "fI/(F) there exists an integer n, such that a = Pn. Since 
"fI/(F) Il a = 0 and since P(n + 1) E "fI/(F) we have P(n + 1) ¢ F'n.

E-chains. Given a nonempty set ao, 3 al E ao. If al 1= 0, 3 a2 E al' etc. How-
ever, by Theorem 7.34, we see that after a finite number of steps we must 
arrive at a set an E an _ 1 with an = o. 
While every descending E-chain must be of finite length it does not follow 
that for a given set a there is a bound on the length of the E-chains descending

Remark. In the material ahead we will be interested in relational systems 
[a, r] in which r well orders the set a. In such a case we call the relational 
system [a, r] a well-ordered set. When the relation r is understood, or un-
important, we will speak simply of the well-ordered set a. 
Since isomorphism between relational systems is an equivalence relation, 
it follows that every well-ordered set [a, r] determines an equivalence class 
of well-ordered sets. In particular, since every ordinal ex is well ordered by the 
E-relation, each ordinal ex determines an equivalence class of well-ordered 
sets. What we propose to prove is that the ordinal numbers can be taken as 
canonical well-ordered sets because (1) each ordinal ex, as a well-ordered set, 
belongs to exactly one equivalence class of well-ordered sets, and (2) every 
equivalence class of well-ordered sets contains exactly one ordinal. 
To prove that there is exactly one ordinal in every equivalence class we 
must prove that if r well orders a, there is one and only one ordinal ex for which 
(3f)[flsomE, .(ex, a)]. 
We first prove that there is at most one such ordinal. 
Proposition 7.39. Ord(A) /\ Ord(B) /\ F IsomE,E(A, B) --+ A = B. 
PROOF. It is sufficient to prove that F is the identity function I restricted to A. 
This we prove by transfinite induction. If /3 E A /\ (\I ex < /3)[F'ex = ex] then 
F"/3 = /3. Furthermore since /3 is the E-minimal element in A - /3 and order 
isomorphisms map minimal elements onto minimal elements it follows that 
F'/3 is the E-minimal element in B - F"/3 = B - /3, i.e., F'/3 = /3.

Proposition 7.40. 
Ord(A) /\ Ord(B) /\ F 1 IsomE, R(A, C) /\ F 2 IsomE, R(B, C) --+ A = B. 
PROOF. Proposition 7.39 and the fact that F 2 0 Fl1 IsomE, iA, B). 
D 
Remark. Proposition 7.40 assures us that every well-ordered class is 
order isomorphic to at most one ordinal well ordered by the E-relation. 
We will prove that while not all well-ordered classes are order isomorphic to 
an ordinal every well-ordered set is.

Since order isomorphisms must map minimal elements into minimal 
elements and initial segments into intial segments we must show that if R We a 
then there exists an ordinal number ex and a function F mapping ex onto a in 
such a way that "i/ {3 < ex, r{3 is the R-minimal element in a - F"{3. But this 
means that F must be so defined that its value at {3 depends on {3, the values F 
assumes at all ordinals smaller than {3, and the additional requirement that 
r{3 be the R-minimal element in a - F"{3. Does there exist a function ful-
filling all of these requirements? We will prove that such a function does 
exist. Indeed we will prove that there exists exactly one function F defined on 
On in such a way that its value at {3 depends upon {3, and upon the values F 
assumes at all ordinals smaller than {3, hence upon F r {3, and also depends 
upon any previously given condition G. Such a function F is said to be defined 
by transfinite recursion. 
We need the following lemma. 
Lemma 1. f ff'n {3 1\ ("i/ ex < {3)[f'ex = G'(f rex)] 1\ g ff'n y

and if F = u(K) then 
(1) 
F ff'n On, 
(2) 
("i/ ex) [rex = G'(F [' ex)], 
(3) 
F 1 ff'n On 1\ ("i/ ex)[F 1 'ex = G'(F 1 [' ex)] -+ F 1 = F. 
PROOF. (1) Since each element of K is a relation it follows that F is a relation. 
Furthermore 
<a, b) E F 1\ <a, c) E F -+ (3fE K)(3 g E K)[<a, b) Ef 1\ <a, c) E g]. 
From Lemma 1 we have thatf'a = g'a, i.e., b = c. Thus F is single valued, 
hence is a function. 
If b E a 1\ a E ~(F) then from the definition of F and K it follows that 
(3 1)( 3 {3)[f f#'n {3 1\ a E {3]. But ordinals are transitive and since bE a, a E {3, 
and {3 ~ ~(F)it follows that b E ~(F). Thus ~(F)is a transitive subclass of On 
and hence is an ordinal. Therefore ~(ff') = On or (3 y) [y = ~(F)]. If 
y = ~(F) and if 
g = F u {<y, G'(F IY)} 
then g ff'n(y + 1) 1\ ("i/ ex < y + 1)[g'ex = G'(g I ex)]. Thus g E K and y E 
~(F). But y = ~(F). This is a contradiction; hence ~(F) = On and F ff'n On.

(2) From (1) and the definition of F, it follows that (V 1l()(3 f) [f ~ F 
1\ F'1l( = I'll( 1\ I'll( = G'(f ~ Il()]. Then F ~ Il( = / 
~ Il( and hence F'1l( = 
I'll( = G'(f ~ Il() = G'(F ~ Il(). 
(3) Since ~(F t) = ~(F) it is sufficient to prove that (\I 1l()[F~1l( = F'Il(]. 
This we do by transfinite induction. If (V 1l()[1l( < l' -+ F~1l( = F'Il(] then 
F t ~'l' = F ~'l'. Therefore F't'l' = G'(Ft ~'l') = G'(F ~'l') = F''l'.

Corollary 7.42. (3! f)[f .?n Il( 1\ (\I f3 < 1l()[f'f3 = G'(f ~ f3)]]. 
The proof is left to the reader. 
Remark. Theorem 7.41 is a theorem schema and hence a metatheorem. 
With quantification in the metalanguage it could be stated as 
(\I G)(3!F)[F.?n On 1\ (\I 1l()[F'1l( = G'(F 11l()]]. 
While this statement more readily conveys the content of the theorem as it 
will be used it is nevertheless of interest to note that Theorem 7.41 as stated 
is stronger. It not only asserts the existence of the function F but prescribes 
a method for exhibiting F when G is given. 
For certain types of problems it is sufficient to know that functions can be 
defined recursively on the natural numbers in the following sense. Given any 
function h and any set a there is a function/defined on w in such a way that 
1'0 = a 
f'(n + 1) = h'f'n. 
This type of recursion can be extended to functions on On by requiring 
that at a limit ordinal Il(, the value of/is the supremum of its values at the 
ordinals preceding Il(, i.e., 
I'll( = U {f''l'I'l' < Il(}. 
To simplify our notation somewhat, we introduce the following. 
Definition 7.43. 
(1) 
UXEBA'x ~ U {A'xlxEB}. 
(2) 
nxEBA'x ~ n {A'xlxEB}. 
Remark. We read these symbols as "the union of A'x for x E B" and "the 
intersection of A'x for x E B" respectively. 
We now wish to prove that given any class H and any set a, there exists a 
function F defined on On in such a way that 
F'O = a

(2) 
F'(P + 1) = H'F'P, 
(3) 
F'P = Uy<p F'y, P E K n, 
(4) 
F is unique. 
PROOF. (1) F'O = G'(F 10) = G'O = a. 
(2) 
F'(P + 1) = G'(F I (P + 1». Since 
~(F I (P + 1» = P + 1 and 
sup(P + 1) = P # P + 1 we have that 
G'(F I (P + 1» = H'(F I (P + 1»' sup(P + 1) = H'F'P, 
i.e., F'(P + 1) = H'F'p. 
(3) 
F'P = G'(F I P). Since ~(F I P) = P and P E Kn we have that 
sup(P) = p. 
Hence 
G'(F I P) = u("fI/'(F I P» = Uy<p F'y, i.e., F'P = 
Uy<p F'y. 
(4) It is easily prove by induction that F is unique. 
D 
Remark. Again we point out that Proposition 7.44 is a stronger result than 
the one we proposed to prove because it not only assures the existence of the 
function F but shows how to produce F given Hand a. 
In the statement of Proposition 7.44 we have chosen to say simply that 
"F is unique." The reader should have no trouble determining the wff that 
should appear here. 
Coronary 7.45 (Principle of Finite Recursion). 
(3 !f)[j ffn W 1\ 1'0 = a 1\ ('r/ k)[f'(k + 1) = Hl'k]]. 
PROOF. If in Proposition 7.44 we restrict F to w then F I w is a function on w 
and hence is a set. Therefore (3 f)[f = F ~ w]. Then f ffn w,1'O = a, and 
('r/ k)[f'(k + 1) = Hl'k]. 
It is easily proved, by induction, thatfis unique. 
D 
Remark. In the study of order isomorphisms we are especially interested 
in those order-preserving functions that map ordinals onto ordinals. Any 
function whose domain is an ordinal and whose range is a class of ordinal 
numbers we will call an ordinal function. If in addition an ordinal function is 
order preserving we say that it is strictly monotone.

(4) State and prove a generalization of Theorem 7.41 in which On is replaced by a 
well-ordered class A. 
Remark. The principle of transfinite recursion assures us that we can 
define a function F on On in such a way that its value at ex is dependent on its 
values at all ordinals less than ex and on any given condition G. If R well 
orders A and if F is to be an order-preserving isomorphism from some 
ordinal onto A then rex must be the R-minimal element in A -
F"ex. Suppose 
that we could define G in such a way that G'(F I IX) is the R-minimal element 
in A -
F"ex. Then clearly F would be an order-preserving map from ordinals 
into A. It would then only remain to be proved that A is exhausted, i.e., 
"If/(F) = A. In fact we will discover that there are two cases of interest. If R 
is a well-founded relation then "If/(F) = A; if R is not well founded then 
"If/(F) will be an R-initial segment of A. 
Note that "If/(F) is R transitive, that is, aRb 1\ bE "If/(F) -+ a E "If/(F). 
Proposition i .47. If 
R We A 1\ R Wfr A 1\ B ~ A 1\ ('v' xEA)('v' YEB)[x R Y -+ xEB] 
then 
A = B v (3 x E A)[B = An (R-1),,{x)]. 
PROOF. If A #- B then, A - B #- 0 since B ~ A. Thus A -
B has an R-
minimal element, a (Proposition 6.26). Then a E A and a ¢ B. Since by 
hypothesis 
bEA 1\ bRc 1\ cEB-+bEB 
it follows that 
('v' xEB)[x R a] 
for otherwise aEB. Therefore B ~ [A n (R-l)"{a)].

51 
Furthermore suppose that b E [A n (R - 1)" {a}]. Then b E A and bRa. 
But a is the R-minimal element in A -
B. Therefore b ¢ A -
B, i.e. bE B. 
Thus [A n(R-l)"{a}] ~BandhenceB= [An(R-l)"{a}]. 
0 
Remark. In Proposition 7.47 the requirement that R be well founded is 
only used to establish that A -
B has an R-minimal element. Later we will 
show that it is sufficient for R to be founded. Consequently this result follows 
if R is a well-ordering relation that is not well founded. 
Proposition 7.48. If F $'n On /\ ('r/ ex)[F'ex E [A - F"ex]], then 
(1) 
1r(F) ~ A, 
(2) 
OlIn iF), 
(3) 
&,~(A). 
PROOF. (1) Since ('r/ ex)[F'ex E (A - F"ex)] it follows that ('r/ ex)[F'ex E A] and 
hence 1r(F) ~ A. 
(2) If ex < p, then F'ex E F"p. Since by hypothesis F'p E (A - F"P), it 
follows that F'p ¢ F"p. Therefore F'ex "# F'p. We have just proven that if 
ex "# p, then F'ex "# F'p. Consequently, if F'ex = F'P, then ex = p. Therefore 
F is one-to-one. 
(3) 
Since 1r(F) ~ A, it follows that if A is a set, then 1r(F) is also a set. 
But since F is one-to-one 1r(F) is a set iff On is a set. Therefore A is a proper 
class. 
0 
Proposition 7.49. If F $'n On /\ ('r/ a)[A -
F"ex "# 0 -+ F'ex E A - F"ex] /\ 
vU(A) then 
(3 ex) [('r/ p < a) [A - F"p "# 0] /\ F"ex = A /\ OlIniF I a)]. 
PROOF. If('r/ ex) [A -
F"ex "# 0] then ('r/ ex) [F'ex E A -
F"ex] and by Proposition 
7.48 A is a proper class. Since by hypothesis A is a set we conclude that 
(3 ex)[A - F"ex = 0]. There is then a smallest such ex, i.e., 
(3 ex)[A -
F"ex = 0 /\ ('r/ P < ex)[A - F"p "# 0]]. 
If x E F"ex then (3 p < ex)[x = F'P]. But if p < ex, then [A - F"P] "# 0 and 
hence F'p E [A - F"P], i.e., x EA. Thus F"ex ~ A. But since [A - F"ex] = 0, 
A ~ F"ex. Therefore A = F"ex. 
Since F is a function F I ex is single valued. Furthermore if y < ex and 
p < ex and ify < p, then 
F'y E F"p /\ F'P E A - F"P 
i.e., F'y E F"P /\ F'P ¢ F"p. Then F'P "# F'y. We have proved that if y < ex 
andp < aandify"# p,thenF'p"# F'y.Consequently,ify < ex and P < ex and 
if F'y = F'P, then y = p, that is F I ex is one-to-one.

Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
Remark. In the proof of Proposition 7.48 we see that the requirement that 
0/1X) [F'IX E A -
F"IXJ assures us that the function F defined by transfinite 
induction will be one-to-one. Conversely if F is one-to-one then 1fI(F) will 
be a proper class and (rt IX)[F'IX E A -
F"IX]. Furthermore if1fl(F) is a set then 
F cannot be one-to-one. In this case Proposition 7.49 assures us that if F 
fulfills the requirements for one-to-oneness "as long as it can," i.e., until 
1fI(F) is exhausted then the restriction of F to some ordinal IX will map IX one-
to-one onto 1fI(F). From this we can prove that every well-ordered set is 
order isomorphic to an ordinal number. 
Proposition 7.50. If R is well founded on A and well orders A, if 
(1) 
G = {(x, y)ly E [A -
1fI(x)J 1\ [(A -
1fI(x)) n (R-l)"{y} = OJ}, 
(2) 
F $in On, and 
(3) 
(rt IX) [F'IX = G'(F r IX)J, then 
A -
F"IX =f 0 ~ F'IXEA -
F"IX. 
PROOF. As the first step in our proof we will show that G is single valued. For 
this purpose suppose that <x, Yl), (x, Y2) E G. Then 
Yl E [A -
1fI(x)J 1\ Y2 E [A -
1fI(x)J 
and [(A -1fI(x))n(R-l)"{ydJ = 0 1\ [(A -1fI(x))n(R- 1)"{Y2)] = O. 
Therefore Yl¢(R- 1)"{Y2} 1\ Y2¢(R- 1)"{yd. Since R well orders A we 
must have Y1 = Y2. 
Furthermore, if [A -
1fI(x)J =f 0 then since R is well founded on A and 
well orders A, A -
1fI(x) has an R-minimal element, y. But G'x = Y, i.e., 
G'x E [A - 1fI(x)]. 
We have now shown that if A -
1fI(x) =f 0, then G'x E A -
1fI(x). In 
particular, if x is F r IX, it follows, since 1fI(F r IX) = F"IX, that if A -
F"IX 
=f 0, then G'(F r IX) E A -
F"IX. But G'(F r IX) = F'IX.

Proposition 7.51. If A is a proper class that is well ordered by R, and R is well 
founded on A, if 
(1) 
G = {<x, y)IYE [A -
1fI(x)] 1\ [(A -
1fI(x)) n (R-l)"{y)] = O}, 
(2) 
F $in On, and 
(3) 
(rt IX) [F'IX = G'(F r IX)J, 
then 
F IsomE,R(On, A). 
PROOF. If (3 IX)[A -
F"IX = OJ then A ~ F"IX. Since F"IX is a set it would then 
follow that A is a set. Since A is a proper class it follows that (rt IX)[A - F"IX 
=f 0]. From Proposition 7.50 and the defining properties of F and G it follows 
that F'IX is the R-minimal element in A -
F"IX, i.e., 
F'IX E [A -
F"IXJ 
and 
[(A -
F"IX) n (R -l)"{F'IX}J = O.

53 
From Proposition 7.48 it then follows that "/fI(F) ~ A and F is one-to-one. 
To prove that F is onto we note that if y E "/fI(F) then (3 ex)[y = F'ex]. Further-
more since F'ex is the R-minimal element in A -
F"ex 
x R y -+ x ¢ [A - F"ex] 
then 
X E A /\ X R y -+ X E F"ex 
-+ x E "/fI(F). 
Then R, A, and "/fI(F) satisfy the hypotheses of Proposition 7.47: 
R We A /\ R Wfr A /\ "/fI(F) ~ A /\ 
(V X E A)(V y E 'If/(F) )[x R y -+ X E "/fI(F)]. 
Consequently, from Proposition 7.47 we conclude that "/fI(F) = A v 
(3 xEA)["/fI(F) = A n (R-l)"{x}].But"/fl(F)cannotbeanR-initialsegment 
of A because R-initial segments of A are sets, and "/fI(F) being the one-to-one 
image of the proper class On cannot be a set. Therefore "/fI(F) = A and 
F: On !;;;~'A. 
Finally if ex < p then F"ex ~ F"p and hence [A - F"P] ~ [A - F"ex]. 
Since F'p E [A - F"P] it follows that F'p E [A - F"ex]. But F'ex is the R-
minimal element of A -
F"ex. Hence 
F'ex R F'p v F'ex = F'p. 
Since F is one-to-one, F'ex =F F'p and so 
ex < p -+ F'ex R F'p 
i.e., F IsomE,R(On, A).

That F ~ 0( is order preserving is proved as in the proof of Proposition

Remark. Since E is a well-founded relation and well foundedness is 
preserved under order isomorphism it follows that the requirement in 
Proposition 7.51 that R be well founded on A cannot be removed. In its 
absence we can only prove that On is order isomorphic to some R-initial 
segment of A. That this can occur we show' by an example, the so-called 
lexicographical ordering on On x On. 
Definition 7.55. Le ~ {«O(, P), (oy, b» 10( < y V [0( = Y 1\ P < b]}.

D 
Remark. From the lexicographical ordering we in turn define a relation 
Ro that will be of value to us in later chapters. We will show that this relation 
Ro not only well orders On2 it is well founded on On2• 
Definition 7.57. Ro ~ {«O(, P), <y, b» Imax(O(, p) < max(y, b)

(2) If y = max(O(, P) + 1 and <b, r) Ro <0(, P), then max(b, r) ~ 
max(O(, P) < y. Therefore <b, r) E y X Y and hence On2 II (Ro l)"{ <0(, P)} ~ 
y x y. Since y x y is a set, On2 II (R01)"{<0(, P)} is a set. Thus Ro is well 
founded on On2•

Remark. We have shown that Ro well orders On2 and is well founded on 
On2 . Consequently the relational system [Ro, On2] is order isomorphic to 
[E, On]. By Proposition 7.51 there exists an order isomorphism, indeed a 
unique order isomorphism between the two systems. 
Definition 7.59. 10 IsomRQ,E(On2, On). 

CHAPTER 8 
Ordinal Arithmetic 
In Chapter 7 we defined IX + 1 to be IX U {IX}. We proved that IX + 1 is an 
ordinal, that is, IX + 1 is a transitive set that is well ordered by the E-relation. 
As a well-ordered set IX + 1 has an initial segment IX and its "terminal" 
segment beginning with IX consists of just a single element, namely IX. 
If we add 1 to IX + 1 we obtain an ordinal with an initial segment IX and a 
terminal segment, beginning with IX, consisting of two elements IX and IX + 1. 
Since this terminal segment {IX, IX + I} is order isomorphic to 2 ~ 1 + 1 we 
call the sum of IX + 1 and 1, IX + 2. 
In general, by IX + f3 we mean an ordinal obtained from IX by adding 1, 
f3 times. That is, IX + f3 is an ordinal with an initial segment IX and a terminal 
segment, beginning with IX, that is order isomorphic to f3. That such an ordinal 
number exists is clear from the fact that ({O} x IX) U ({ I} x f3) is well ordered 
by the lexicographical ordering Le. With respect to Le, {O} x IX is an initial 
segment order isomorphic to IX and {I} x f3 is a terminal segment order 
isomorphic to f3. 
It would then seem reasonable to define IX + f3 as the ordinal that is order 
isomorphic to ({O} x IX) U ({l} x f3}. However for certain purposes it is 
preferable to define IX + f3 recursively in the following way. 
Definition 8.1. 
IX + 0 ~ IX, 
IX + (f3 + 1) ~ (IX + f3) + 1, 
IX + f3 ~ U (IX + y), f3 E K II • 
y<P 
Remark. Definition 8.1 is an example of a very convenient form of definition 
by transfinite recursion. To define the addition of f3 to IX, i.e., IX + f3 we specify 
56 

8 Ordinal Arithmetic 
57 
the result of adding 0 to IX, we define the sum of IX and (P + 1) as an operation 
on IX + P namely the operation of adding one, and we define IX + P for P E K" 
as the supremum of the set of sums IX + y for y < f3. 
That this is sufficient to define IX + f3 for all IX and f3 is clear from Proposition 
7.44. If in Proposition 7.44, H = {<IX, IX + 1) IIX E On} and a = IX then 
F'O = IX, 
F'(f3 + 1) = H'F'f3 = F'f3 + 1, 
F'{3 = U F'y, f3 E K", 
y<P 
i.e., IX + f3 = F'f3. 
The reader should have little difficulty convincing himself, or herself, that 
Definition 8.1 captures our intuitive notion that IX + f3 is an ordinal with 
initial segment IX and terminal segment that is order isomorphic to f3. In 
addition, Definition 8.1 is designed for proofs by induction. Recall that in 
order to prove (V lX)cp(lX) by induction we need only prove 
(l) (V f3 E IX )cp(f3) --+ cp( IX). 
Since for each IX either IX = 0 or (3 Y)[IX = Y + 1J or IX E K", we can prove (1) 
by proving 
cp(O) , 
cp(lX) --+ cp(1X + 1), 
and 
IX E K" /\ (V f3 E lX)cp(f3) --+ cp(IX). 
Definition 8.1 lends itself well to such proofs as we will now demonstrate. 
Proposition 8.2. IX + f3 EOn. 
PROOF (By transitive induction on f3). For f3 = 0 we have IX + 0 = IX EOn. 
If IX + f3 E On then 
IX + (f3 + 1) = (IX + f3) + 1 E On. If f3 E KII and 
(Vy)[y < f3 --+ IX + Y E OnJ then IX + f3 = Uy<P(1X + y) EOn. 
D 
Proposition 8.3. 0 + IX = IX + 0 = IX. 
PROOF. By definition IX + 0 = IX. If 0 + IX = IX, then 0 + (IX + 1) = (0 + IX) 
+ 1 = IX + 1. If IX E K" and (V f3)[f3 < IX --+ 0 + f3 = f3J then 0 + IX = 
UP<a(O + f3) = UP<af3 = IX. 
D 
Remark. We frequently wish to prove a property of ordinals that holds 
for all ordinals greater than or equal to some ordinal y > 0 and which may 
fail to hold for ordinals smaller than y: 
(1) 
(V IX)[IX ~ Y --+ cp(lX)].

Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
Such an assertion can be proved by induction using the following approach. 
Let I/I(IY.) be the wff 
IY. < y V cp(IY.). 
Then to prove (1) it is sufficient to prove (V IY.)I/I(IY.). To prove this by induction 
it is sufficient to prove three things: 
(a)

(c) 
IY. E Ku !\ (V 13 E ri)tjJ(f3) --+ tjJ(IY.). 
Since y > 0 the proof of (a) is already established so we have nothing to do. 
To prove (b) we have nothing to do if IY. + 1 < y. For IY. + 1 = y we must 
prove cp(y) and for IY. + 1 > y we must prove cp(IY.) --+ cp(IY. + 1). To prove 
(c) we must prove cp(y) if Y E Kn and we must prove that 
IY. E Kn !\ (V f3)[y ;:£ 13 < IY. !\ cp(f3)] --+ cp(IY.). 
In summary we must prove 
cp(y) , 
IY. ~ Y !\ cp(IY.) -+Cp(IY. + 1), 
and 
IY. E Kn !\ (V f3)[y ;:£ 13 < IY. !\ cp(f3)] --+ cp(IY.). 
Let us illustrate: 
Proposition 8.4. IY. < 13 --+ y + IY. < y + 13. 
PROOF (By transfinite induction on 13). For 13 = IY. + 1 we have y + IY. < 
(y + IY.) + 1 = y + (IY. + 1). If IY. < 13 --+ y + IY. < y + 13 and if IY. < 13 + 1 then 
IY. < 13 v IY. = 13. In either case we have that y + IY. ;:£ y + 13 < (y + 13) + 1 
= y + (13 + 1). If 13 E Ku and (V 0)[IY. < 0 < 13 --+ y + IY. < y + oJ then 
y + IY. < Uo<P (y + 0) = y + 13. 
D 
Corollary 8.5. y + IY. =.y + 13 +-+ IY. = 13. 
PROOF. If IY. = 13, then by Theorem 3.4 
x E y + IY. +-+ X E Y + 13. 
Consequently y + IY. = Y + 13. That is 
(1) 
IY. = 13 --+ y + IY. = Y + 13. 
From Proposition 8.4 
(2) 
IY. < 13 --+ y + IY. < y + 13 
and 
(3) 
13 < IY. --+ Y + 13 < y + IY..

From (1), (2), and (3) it follows that 
y + ex = y + /3 +-+ IX = /3.

Remark. For the proofs of several results on ordinal arithmetic we need 
the following property of suprema. 
Proposition 8.6. ('</ ex E A)(3 /3 E B)[ex ~ /3J --+ sup(A) ~ sup(B). 
PROOF. If Y E sup(A) then (3 ex)[y E ex 1\ ex E A]. But ex E A --+ (3 /3)[/3 E B 1\ 
ex ~ /3J i.e., (3 /3)[y E /3 1\ /3 E B]. Therefore y E sup(B) and hence sup(A) 
~ sup(B). 
0 
Remark. That Proposition 8.6 can not be an iff result is established by the 
counter-example 
sup(w) = sup(w + 1). 
Proposition 8.7. ex ~ /3 --+ ex + y ~ /3 + y. 
PROOF (By transfinite induction on y). If ex ~ /3, then ex + 0 ~ /3 + O. If ex + y 
~ /3 + Y then IX + (y + 1) ~ /3 + (y + 1). If y E Kn and ('</ (j < y)[ex + (j 
~ /3 + (jJ then ex + y = U~<y (ex + (j) ~ U~<y (/3 + (j) = /3 + y. 
0 
Proposition 8.8. ex ~ /3 --+ (3! y)[ex + y = /3]. 
PROOF. Since ex ~ 0 it follows from Propositions 8.7 and 8.3 that ex + /3 
~ 0 + /3 = /3. Thus there exists a smallest ordinal y such that ex + y ~ /3. 
If y E K, then y = 0 v (3 (j)[y = (j + 1]. If y = 0 then ex ~ /3 1\ ex ~ /3. 
Therefore ex = /3 and ex + y = /3. If y = (j + 1 then (j < y and ex + (j < /3. 
Then ex + (j + 1 ~ /3, i.e., ex + y ~ /3. But ex + y ~ /3; therefore ex + y = /3. 
If y E Kn then ('</ (j < Y)[IX + (j < /3J. Therefore 
ex + y = U (ex + (j) ~ /3. 
~<p 
Again since ex + y ~ /3, we have that ex + y = /3. 
From Corollary 8.5 we see that if ex + y = /3 and ex + (j = /3 then y = (j. o 
Proposition 8.9. m + nEW. 
PROOF (By finite induction on n). For n = 0 we have m + 0 = mEW. If 
m + nEW, then m + (n + 1) = (m + n) + 1 E w. 
0 
Proposition 8.10. n < W 1\ W ~ ex --+ n + ex = ex. 
PROOF (By transfinite induction on IX). If ex = W we have 
n + W = U (n + y).

By Proposition 8.9, y < w -+ n + y < w. Hence

by Proposition 8.6. Thus n + w = w. By Definition 8.1 and the induction

Remark. From Proposition 8.10 we see that ordinal addition is not com-
mutative: 
l+w=w"#w+l. 
Furthermore 1 + w = 2 + w but 1 "# 2. Thus we do not have a right-hand 
cancellation law. From Corollary 8.5 we see that we do however have a 
left-hand cancellation law. 
Proposition 8.4 assures us of the additivity property for inequalities for 
addition from the left. Proposition 8.6 however suggests that addition from 
the right may not preserve strict inequality. This is the case as we see from the 
following example. 
1 < 2 but 
1 + w = 2 + w. 
Proposition 8.8 shows that subtraction, when permitted, is unique. 
Finally ordinal addition is associative. The proof requires the following 
result. 
Proposition 8.11. 13 E Kn -+ IX + 13 E Kn. 
PROOF. If 13 E Kn, then 13 "# O. Therefore IX + 13 "# O. Thus IX + 13 E Kn or 
(3 I5)[1X + 13 = 15 + 1]. But if 13 E Kn then 
IX + 13 = U (IX + y). 
7<{J 
Since 15 E 15 + 1 it follows that if IX + 13 = 15 + 1 then 
15 E U (IX + y) 
7<{J 
that is (3 y)[y < 13 1\ I5EIX + y]. But ifI5EIX + Y then (15 + l)E(1X + y + 1).

Since fJ E Kn and y < fJ it follows that y + 1 < fJ. Therefore 
(j + 1 E U (IX + y) 
Y<P 
i.e. (j + 1 E (j + 1. 
Since this is a contradiction we conclude that IX + fJ E Kn. 
Proposition 8.12. (IX + fJ) + y = IX + (fJ + y). 
61 
o 
PROOF (By transfinite induction on y). For y = 0 we note that (IX + fJ) + 0 = 
IX + fJ = IX + (fJ + 0). If (IX + fJ) + y = IX + (fJ + y) then (IX + fJ) + (y + 1) 
= ((IX + fJ) + y) + 1 = (IX + (fJ + y») + 1 = IX + ((fJ + y) + 1) = IX + (fJ + 
(y + 1)). If y E Kn and (IX + fJ) + (j = IX + (fJ + (j) for (j < Y then 
(IX + fJ) + y = U ((IX + fJ) + (j) = U (IX + (fJ + (j»).

Furthermore since y E Kn we have by Proposition 8.11 that fJ + Y E Kn·

If (j < y and IJ = fJ + (j, then IJ < fJ + Y and IX + (fJ + (j) ~ IX + IJ. Con-
versely if IJ < fJ + y, then IJ < fJ or (3 (j)[1J = fJ + (j]. Suppose that IJ < fJ· 
Then IX + IJ ~ IX + (fJ + 0) and 0 < y. On the otherhand if IJ = fJ + (j then 
IX + IJ ~ IX + (fJ + (j) and since IJ < fJ + Y we have that (j < y. Thus, by 
Proposition 8.6 
U (IX + (fJ + (j») = U (IX + IJ)

Proposition 8.13. IX ~ w --+ (3! fJ)(3! n)[fJ E Kn /\ IX = fJ + n]. 
PROOF. If A = {yEKnIY ~ IX} and if fJ = u(A), then fJEKn and fJ ~ IX. 
Therefore, by Proposition 8.8, (3 y)[fJ + y = IX]. If y ~ w, then (3 (j)[y = 
w + (j] and IX = fJ + (w + (j) = (fJ + w) + (j. But fJ + WE Kn and fJ + 
W ~ IX. Thus fJ + WE A; but fJ < fJ + w. This contradicts the definition of fJ; 
hence y < w. 
If IX = fJl + nl = fJ2 + n2 with fJl ~ fJ2 then (3 y)[fJl + y = fJ2], i.e., 
fJl + nl = fJl + Y + n2, 
nl = Y + n2· 
Since y ~ y + n2 we must have that y < w. Furthermore since fJl + y = fJ2 
and fJ2 E Kn it follows that y = 0, i.e., fJl = fJ2 and n1 = n2.

Prove Proposition 8.8 by transfinite induction on p. 
Remark. From the foregoing we see that ordinal addition on OJ has all of 
the arithmetic properties that we expect. Addition on On is however not 
commutative and the right-hand cancellation law fails. 
In very much the same way as we define integer multiplication as repeated 
addition we can also define ordinal multiplication as repeated addition. For 
the justification of our definition we again appeal to Proposition 7.44. 
If in Proposition 7.44, Ha = {<f3, f3 + a) I f3 E On} and if a = 0 then 
F;O = 0, 
F~(f3 + 1) = H~F~f3 = F~f3 + a,

If /3 = 0( + 1 and y > 0, then yO( < yO( + y = Y(O( + 1). If 0( < /3 /\ Y > 0

Conversely if yO( < y/3 then y > O. Since 0( = /3 implies yO( = y/3 and

If r:x # 0 and 13 # 0, then r:x ~ 1 and 13 ~ 1 and hence 1 ~ r:x ~ r:xf3, i.e., r:xf3 # O.

Proposition 8.25. r:x(f3 + y) = r:xf3 + r:xy. 
PROOF (By transfinite induction on y). For y = 0 we see that r:x(f3 + 0) = 
r:xf3 = r:xf3 + r:x. O. If r:x(f3 + y) = r:xf3 + r:xy, then r:x{f3 + (y + 1») = r:x{(f3 + y)

y E KII and r:x(f3 + c5) = r:xf3 + r:xc5 for c5 < y then we consider two cases r:x = 0 
and r:x # o. If r:x = 0 then 
r:x(f3 + y) = 0 = r:xf3 + r:xy.

If (ap)y = a(py) then (ap)(y + 1) = (ap)y + ap = a(py) + ap = a(py + P)

Proposition 8.27. P#-O -+ (3! y)(3! b)[a = py + b /\ b < p]. 
PROOF. If a < p, then a = p·O + a /\ a < p. If P ~ a and y = sup{blPb 
~ a} then y ~ 1. Suppose that a < pv. Then pb ~ a implies b < v and hence 
y ~ v. Consequently if b < Y then pb ~ a. If (3 T)[Y = T + 1] then T < Y 
hence TE{bIPb ~ a} therefore (3 v)[vE{bIPb ~ a} /\ T < v]. Thus v = y, 
i.e., py ~ a. If y E Kn then 
py = U pb ~ U a = a.

Thus py ~ a and hence (3 b)[a = py + b]. If b ~ p, then (3 Jl)[b = P + Jl] 
then a = py + p + Jl = P(y + 1) + Jl hence P(y + 1) ~ a and y + 1 ~ y. 
From this we conclude that b < p, i.e., 
a = py + b /\ b < p. 
If a = PY1 + b1 = PY2 + b2 with b1 < p /\ b2 < p /\ Y1 ~ Y2 it then 
follows that (3 v) [Y2 = Y1 + v] and 
PY1 + b1 = P(Y1 + v) + b2 = PY1 + pv + b2 
b1 = pv + b2 • 
But pv + b2 < p. Therefore v = 0 and hence b1 = b2 /\ Y1 = Y2·

PROOF (By transfinite induction on 13). If 13 = a + 1, then 1 < y implies 
ya < ya+1. Suppose that 
a < 13 /\ I < y ~ ya < yp. 
If a < 13 + 1, then a < 13 or a = 13. In either case

PROOF (By transfinite induction on y). For y = 0 we have ct.0 = 1 = 13°.

Remark. That ct. < 13 and y E Kn does not imply ct.Y < j3Y follows from the 
observation that 2 < 3 but 
The proof is left to the reader. 
Proposition 8.37. ct. > 1 -
13 ~ ct.p• 
PROOF (By transfinite induction on 13). For 13 = 0 we have 0 ~ ct.0 = 1. If 
13 ~ ct.P then 13 + 1 ~ ct.P + 1. But since 13 < 13 + 1 we have from Proposition 
8.33 that ct.P < ct.P+ 1 and hence ct.P + 1 ~ ct.P+ 1, i.e., 13 + 1 ~ ct.P+ 1. If 13 E Kn

Proposition 8.38. ct. > 1 1\ 13 > 0 _ (3! (j)[ct.0 ~ 13 < ct.H 1].

smallest ordinal y such that 13 < ct.Y• From Definition 8.30 it follows that 
YEK,.Sincect.° = 1 1\ 13 ~ litfollowsthaty =F 0; therefore (3 (j)[y = (j + 1J.

If rxd ~ [3 < rxH 1 and rx1 ~ [3 < rx1+ 1 and if b < y, then b + 1 ~ y. Hence

But bE b + 1 = rxp. Consequently (3 y < [3)[b < rx1]. Since 1 < rx, and 
b < rx1 it follows that b + 1 ~ rx1 < rx1+ 1. But y + 1 < [3 and so (j + 1 E 
rxfJ = b + 1. From this contradiction we conclude that 
(2) If [3 E Kn then rxP E Kn by (1) above. If [3 E K J then since [3 "# 0,

Then (3 b < [3)[y < rxd]. 
Proposition 8.41. rxP . rx1 = rxP+1.

PROOF (By transfinite induction on y). First we note that rxP • rxO = ('I.P. 1 =

If (j < Y then by the induction hypothesis (IXP)b = aPb. Since (j < y implies

CHAPTER 9 
Relational Closure and the Rank 
Function 
In this chapter we introduce two ideas important for the work to follow. 
The first of these is relational closure. In later chapters we will be especially 
interested in sets that are transitive. While there exist sets that are not 
transitive every set has a transitive extension. Indeed, every set has a smallest 
transitive extension which we call its transitive closure. 
Proposition 9.1. (V x)(3 y)[ x ~ Y 1\ Tr(y) 1\ (V z) [x ~ Z 1\ Tr(z) --+ y ~ zJ). 
PROOF. IfG'x = xu (u(x»), then there exists a functionJdefined by recursion 
on (J) such that 
Furthermore, if 
f'o=x 
f'(n + 1) = G'f'n. 
y = U f'n 
n<w 
then x = f'0 ~ y. From the definition of G 
f'n ~f'(n + 1) 1\ u(f'n) ~f'(n + 1). 
If a E b 1\ bEY then (3 n) [b E f'nJ and hence 
a E u(f'n) ~ f'(n + 1) 
i.e., a E f'(n + 1). Then a E y and hence Y is transitive. 
If x ~ Z 1\ Tr(z) then we prove by induction that 
f'n ~ z. 
73 

74 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
1'0 = X ~ z. If f'n ~ z then since z is transitive u(f'n) ~ z, i.e., 
a E u(f'n) /\ f'n ~ z --+ a E z. 
Thusf'(n + 1) = f'n u(u(f'n») ~ z. 
Consequently y = Un<ro f'n ~ z. 
Definition 9.2. Tr CI(a) ~ n{YI a ~ y /\ Tr(y)}. 
o 
Remark. Proposition 9.1 has a natural and useful generalization to well-
founded relations. 
Proposition 9.3. If R Wfr A and a ~ A then there exists a set b such that 
[a ~ b ~ A] and 
(1) 
('1 xEA)('i y){x R y /\ YEb --+ xEb]. 
(2) 
('1 x E b)[ x E a v (3 n)(3 g)[g: n + 1 --+ b /\ g'O E a /\ g'n = x /\ 
('1 i < n)[g'(i + 1) R g'i]]]. 
(3) 
('1 w)[[a ~ w ~ A /\ ('1 XE A)('i y)[x R y /\ yEw --+ XE w]]--+ 
b ~ w]). 
PROOF. (1) Since R is well founded on A, it follows, for each x in A, that An 
(R - 1)" {X} is a set. Therefore if 
B = {<x, An (R- 1),,{x})lxEA} 
then B is a function. If y ~ A then B"y is a set hence so is u(B"y). But 
u(B"y) = u{B'xlx E y} 
= u{An(R- 1)"{x}lxEY} 
= An (R- 1)"y. 
Thus A n (R - 1)"y is a set. 
If G'x = x u (A n (R -1 )"x) then there exists a functionf defined on w by 
recursion such that 1'0 = a and f'(n + 1) = G'f'n. Furthermore 1'0 = 
a ~ A. Iff'n is a subset of A then since 
f'(n + 1) = f'n u (A n (R-1)"f'n) 
f'(n + 1) is a subset of A. Thus u(f"w) is a subset of A.1f b = u(f"w) then 
a = 1'0 ~ b. From the definition of G 
f'n ~ f'(n + 1) /\ An (R -1 )"f'n ~ f'(n + 1). 
If XEA, xRy and YEb then (3 n)[xRy /\ YEf'n], i.e., xE(R-1)"f'n 
~ f'(n + 1). Thus x E b. 
(2) 
('1 X Eb)(3 n)[xEf'n]. If n = 0 thenf'n = a and XEa. If the result 
holds for each element inf'n and x Ef'(n + 1) then since 
f'(n + 1) = f'n u (A n (R -l)"f'n) 

9 Relational Closure and the Rank Function 
75 
it follows that either x Ef'n, hence the conclusion follows from the induction 
hypothesis, or (3 y Ef'n)[x R y] in which case the conclusion again follows 
from the induction hypothesis. 
(3) The proof is left to the reader.

Proposition 9.4. 
R Wfr A" B ~ A " B =f. 0 --+ (3 x EB)[B n (R- 1)"{x} = 0]. 
PROOF. Let a E B. By Proposition 9.3 there exists a set b such that 
{a} ~ b ~ A ,,(V xEA)(V y)[x R Y" YEb --+ x Eb]. 
Then b n B is a nonempty subset of A. Therefore 
(3 x E b n B)[(b n B) n (R- 1)"{x} = 0]. 
Ify E B n (R- 1)"{x}, then y E Band y R x. But x E b and hence Y E b. Thus 
yE [b n B n (R- 1)"{x)]. 
Therefore B n (R -1)" {x} = O. 
o 
Remark. Note in Proposition 9.4 that the set b has the property that 
(R -1 )"bisa subset ofb. We say that b is closed with respect to (w.r.t) the binary 
relation R - 1. 
Definition 9.5. 
(1) 
CI(R, A) A R"A ~ A. 
(2) CI2(R, A) A R"A2 ~ A.

"R is closed on A2."

a ~ b ~ A " CI(R 1, b) " ... " 
CI(R p , b) " CI2(S1, b) " ... " CI2(Sq, b). 
PROOF. If G'x = x u R'ix u ... u R;x U S'ix2 U ... U S~'X2, X ~ A then there 
exists a function j defined on w by recursion such that 
1'0 = a "f'(n + 1) = G'f'n

then from the definition of G 
f'(n + 1) = f'n u R;'f'n u··· u R;f'n u S~(f'n)2 u··· u S~'(f'n)2. 
Furthermoref'O = a ~ A. And iff'n ~ A, then since each Ri and each Si is 
closed on A it follows that f'(n + 1) ~ A. Therefore b ~ A. Furthermore 
1'0 = a ~ b. 
If y E Rtb then (3 x E b)[ <x, y) E Ri]. But 
x E b ~ (3 n)[x Ef'n]. 
Thus 
Y E Ri'f'n ~ f'(n + 1). 
Therefore Y E b. Consequently Rtb ~ b. 
Ifz E Stb2 then (3 x, Y E b) [<x, y, z) E Si.] Furthermore (3 m, n) [x E I'm /\ 
Y Ef'n]. If r = max(m, n) then x, Y Ef'r. Thus 
z E St(f'r)2 ~ f'(r + 1). 
Therefore Z E b, and hence, Stb2 ~ b. 
o 
Proposition 9.7. If R WfrA, if K = {f1(3y ~ A)[Cl(R-1,y) /\ f $'ny

F is unique. 
The proof is left to the reader. 
Remark. Proposition 9.1 assures us that every set a has a smallest transitive 
extension. This extension of a we call the transitive closure of a. In order to 
define "rank" we are interested in sets that are not only transitive but 
supertransitive in the sense of 
Definition 9.S. St(A) A Tr(A) /\ (V x)[x E A ~ &>(x) ~ A]. 
Remark. We read St(A) as "A is supertransitive."

(1) 
.A(R~ IX) 1\ St(R~ IX). 
(2) 
IX < P --+ R~ IX E R~P 1\ R~ IX c: RiP. 
PROOF. (1) (By transfinite induction on IX). If IX = 0 then R'[IX = 0 and hence 
R~ IX is a supertransitive set. If Ri IX is a supertransitive set then, since R'[ (IX + 1) 
= PJ!(R~IX), R~(IX + 1) is a set and 
a E C 1\ b ~ C 1\ C E R~(IX + 1) --+ a E C 1\ b ~ C 1\ C ~ RilX 
--+ a E RilX 1\ b ~ R~IX 
--+ a ~ R~IX 1\ b ~ RilX 
--+ a E PJ!(R'[IX) 1\ b E PJ!(R~ IX). 
Thus if C E R~(IX + 1), then C ~ Ri(1X + 1) and PJ!(c) ~ R~(IX + 1). 
If IX E K n, then 
cERi'lX --+ (3 P < 1X)[cERiPJ 
--+ (3 P < IX)[C ~ RiP 1\ PJ!(c) ~ R~PJ 
--+ c ~ RilX 1\ PJ!(c) ~ RilX. 
Since R~ IX is the union of a set it is a set. 
(2) 
Since RiP is transitive it is sufficient to prove that R~ IX E R~p. This 
we do by induction on p. Since R~P ~ RiP we have RiP E PJ!(R~P) = 
R~(P + 1). In particular RiIXER~(1X + 1). 
Suppose, as our induction hypothesis, that IX < P implies R~ IX E RiP. If 
IX < P + 1, then IX < P or IX = p. If IX = P we have 
RilX = R~PERi(P + 1). 
If IX < p, then from the induction hypothesis, Definition 9.9, and the fact 
that R'[(P + 1) is transitive, we have 
RiIXER'[p ~ R~(P + 1) 
and hence RilX E Ri(P + 1). 
If P E Kn then 
Since Ri IX E Ri (IX + 1) it follows that 
IX < P --+ Ri IX E Rip. 
Definition 9.11. Wf(a) A (3 1X)[a E RilX]. 
o 
Remark. Wf(a) is read" a is well founded." With the aid of the following 
theorem and the Axiom of Regularity we can prove that every set is well 
founded. 

78 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
Proposition 9.12. (V x E a)[Wf(x)] --+ Wf(a). 
PROOF. If each element of a is well founded and x E a, then (3 IX)[X E R~ IX]. If 
F'x = Ila(x E R~ IX) 
then since F is a function F"a is a set and indeed a subset of On. Therefore 
u(F"a) is an ordinal. If {3 = u(F"a) + 1 then F"a ~ {3, i.e., x E a --+ F'x < {3. 
By Proposition 9.10 
R~F'x ~ R~{3. 
Also x E R~ F'x and so x E R~{3. Thus a ~ R'{3 and hence a E (!J(R~{3) = 
R~({3 + 1). 
0 
Proposition 9.13. Wf(a). 
PROOF. From the Axiom of Regularity E is a well-founded relation on V. 
From Proposition 9.12 if 
A = {xIWf(x)} 
then a ~ A implies a E A. Then by E-induction (Proposition 5.22) A = v. 
0 
Remark. From Proposition 9.13 we see that in the presence of the Axiom 
of Regularity the function R 1 determines a class of sets {R~ IX IIX E On} whose 
union is the entire universe. Furthermore, from Proposition 9.10, these sets 
are nested, i.e., IX < {3 --+ R~ IX c 
R~{3. 
We offer the following pictorial representation of this nesting of sets. The 
universe is represented as the points in a V-shaped wedge. 
R~(cx + 1)

Figure 2 
If IX E Ku then R~IX = U/I<a R~{3. Thus any set in R~IX is also in some R~{3 
with {3 < IX. Then for each a the smallest ordinal {3 for which a E R~{3 is a 
nonlimit ordinal, i.e., 
(3 1X)[a ¢ R~IX 1\ a E R~(IX + 1)]. 

9 Relational Closure and the Rank Function 
This particular ordinal ex we call the rank of a. 
Definition 9.14. rank (a) !?!:. JJ.a.(a E R;(ex + 1»). 
Remark. We read rank(a) as "rank a." 
Proposition 9.15.

ex = rank(a) +-+ a ¢ R~ex /\ a E R;(ex + 1). 
(3) 
13 ~ rank(a) +-+ a ¢ R~p. 
PROOF. (1) Definition 9.14. 
79 
(2) 
From Definition 9.14 if ex = rank(a) then aER~(ex + 1). If ex = 0 
then since R~O = 0 it follows that a ¢ R;ex. If (3 y)[ex = y + 1] and a E R~ex, 
then y ~ ex, by Definition 9.14. Consequently a ¢ R;ex. If ex E Kn and a E 
R~exthen(3 13 < ex)[aER~p].ButR;p ~ R~(p + 1),henceaER~(p + 1). But 
then 13 ~ ex and so again we conclude that a ¢ Ri ex. 
Conversely if a E R;(ex + 1) then ex ~ rank(a). If in addition a ¢ Riex and if 
13 ~ ex then R~P ~ R't ex and hence a ¢ Rip. But a E Ri (rank(a) + 1). Therefore 
ex < rank(a) + 1, i.e., ex ~ rank(a). Thus ex = rank(a).

R'tP ~ Riex, and so a¢R;p. If ex < 13, then Ri(ex + 1) ~ RiP and since 
a E Ri(ex + 1), it follows that a E R'p.

Proposition 9.16. a E b -+ rank(a) < rank(b). 
PROOF. By Proposition 9.15, if ex = rank(a), then a ¢ R'ex. If a E b then since 
a ¢ R~ ex it follows that b ~ Ri ex and hence b ¢ Ri (ex + 1). Thus ex < rank(b). 
Proposition 9.17. rank(a) = JJ.p('V x E a)[rank(x) < 13]). 
PROOF. If x E a, then, by Proposition 9.15, 
rank(x) < rank(a). 
If x E a and in addition, rank(x) < 13, then 
xERi(rank(x) + 1) ~ R;p. 
Consequently a ~ RiP and hence a E R;(p + 1). Therefore 
rank(a) < p.

Remark. Earlier we promised to prove the equivalence of the weak and 
strong forms of the Axiom of Regularity. We redeemed that promise with 
Proposition 9.4. Indeed Proposition 9.4 is a more general result than the one 
promised. We now state and prove the specific form of strong regularity that 
we called Axiom 6'. The purpose of this proof is to illustrate the power and 
utility of the notion of rank. We point out that this proof is not independent 
of the first because we will use properties of rank that require Proposition 9.4. 
Theorem 9.20 (Axiom 6'). A =f. 0 -+ (3 x E A)[x n A = OJ.

the weak form of the Axiom of Regularity, B has an E-minimal element oc. 
Since IX E B it follows that 
(3 x E A)[oc = rank(x)]. 
Furthermore since IX is an E-minimal element of B it follows from Proposition 
9.16 that 
xnA = o. 
D 
Remark. The simplicity of the proof of Theorem 9.20 illustrates the power 
of the rank function. Indeed with the aid of the rank function we can prove the 
following generalization of Proposition 9.4. 
Proposition 9.21. R Fr A /\ B ~ A /\ B =f. 0 -+ (3 x E B)[B n (R -l)"{X} = OJ. 
PROOF (By contradiction). Suppose that 
Bo = {xEBI('tJ YEB)[rank(x) ~ rank(y)]}, 
and 
Bn+ 1 = {x E BI(3 y E Bn)[ x R y /\ ('tJ Z E B)[z R y -+ rank(x) ~ rank(z)]]},

Then all elements of Bo have bounded rank, hence Bo is a set. If Bn is a set then 
since 
Bn+l = U {xEBlx R y /\ (V zEB)[z R y --+ rank(x) ~ rank(z)]} 
yeBn 
Bn+ 1 is a set. Thus (V n ~ O)[A(Bn)]. If

If (V X E B) [B n (R -1)"{X} # OJ then in particular

Furthermore (V x E b)(3 n)[x E Bn]. Since B n (R -1)" {x} is not empty it 
contains an element of minimal rank, i.e., 
(3 y E B)[y R x /\ (V Z E B)[z R x --+ rank(y) ~ rank(z)]]' 
Since x E Bn, y E Bn+ 1 and hence y E b. But y R x, that is 
(V x E b)[b n (R- 1)"{x} # 0]. 
This contradicts the fact that R Fr A.

Proposition 9.22. If R Fr A /\ B ~ A /\ (V X E A)[A n (R-l)"{X} ~ B--+

The proof is left to the reader. 

CHAPTER 10 
The Axiom of Choice and Cardinal 
Numbers 
Cantor defined the cardinal number of a set M to be "the general concept 
which, by means of our active faculty of thought, arises from the set M when 
we make abstraction of the nature of its various elements m and of the order 
in which they are given." He denoted this cardinal number by M. The two 
bars indicate the two levels of abstraction needed to produce the cardinal 
number from M. With only one level of abstraction, that is, by only abstract-
ing of the nature of its various elements, we obtain the ordinal number M. 
Cantor's definition of cardinal number is clearly not an operational one. 
Indeed Cantor's words suggest that cardinal numbers are psychological 
entities rather than mathematical objects. 
Frege, in 1884, and Russell, independently in 1903, removed cardinal 
numbers from the psychic realm by defining the cardinal number of a set a 
to be the class, a, of all sets that can be mapped one-to-one onto a. While this 
definition has a certain intuitive appeal it has the disadvantage that, at least 
relative to ZF theory, the objects produced are not sets but proper classes. 
This is the same problem that we faced with ordinal numbers and, as we did 
there, we will resolve the problem by defining the cardinal number a to be a 
particular set that can be mapped one-to-one onto a and which will then 
serve as a representative of the class of all such sets. Let us review the situation 
for ordinal numbers. 
The study of ordinal numbers is essentially the study of well-ordered sets. 
The appropriate mappings for such a study are the one-to-one-onto-order-
preserving maps. Under such mappings well-ordered sets divide into equiva-
lence classes, each of which contains exactly one ordinal number. More 
precisely, each equivalence class contains exactly one set that is transitive 
and well ordered by the E-relation. From each equivalent class we took this 
special set as a representative, and we called these representatives ordinal 
numbers. 
82 

10 The Axiom of Choice and Cardinal Numbers 
83 
We propose to do a similar thing for cardinal numbers. For the study of 
cardinal numbers the basic mappings are simply the one-to-one-onto maps. 
Sets a and b are said to be equivalent (or equipollent) if there exists a function 
Jthat maps a one-to-one onto b. 
Definition 10.1. a ~ b A (3f)[f: a !~~, b]. 
Remark. We read a ~ b as "a is equivalent to b." 
Set equivalence, as formulated in Definition 10.1, is an equivalence 
relation: 
Proposition 10.2. 
(1) 
a ~ a. 
(2) 
a ~ b -+ b ~ a. 
(3) 
a ~ b /\ b ~ c -+ a ~ c. 
The proof is left to the reader. 
Remark. From Proposition 10.2 we know that set equivalence partitions 
the universe of sets into equivalence classes. Let us call them cardinal equi-
valence classes. The cardinal equivalence classes are larger than ordinal 
equivalence classes in the sense that all of the elements of several difference 
ordinal equivalence classes can belong to the same cardinal equivalence 
class. This is because there exist well-ordered sets that are not order iso-
morphic but which are equivalent. For example w + 1 and ware not order 
isomorphic but w + 1 can be mapped one-to-one onto w by mapping w to 0, 
o to 1, 1 to 2, etc. Thus w + 1 and w belong to the same cardinal equivalence 
class. Then why not pick the smallest ordinal in each cardinal equivalence 
class as a representative of that class? That is exactly what we will do but 
there is one problem. How do we know that every cardinal equivalence class 
contains an ordinal? Any cardinal equivalence class that contains an ordinal 
is a collection of sets that can be well ordered. Indeed any function that maps 
an ordinal one-to-one onto a set induces a well ordering on that set. Perhaps 
there exist sets that cannot be well ordered and hence are not equivalent to 
any ordinal. We are going to assume that this is not the case. More precisely 
we will assume the Axiom of Choice from which we will prove that every set 
is equivalent to an ordinal and hence can be well ordered. 
Axiom of Choice (weak form). 
(3f)(\1 x E a)[x "# 0 -+ f'x EX]. 
Remark. The Axiom of Choice asserts that for each set a, there exists a 
function!, that picks an element of each nonempty set in a. This functionJis 

84 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
called a choice function for the set a. There is a strong form of the Axiom of 
Choice that asserts the existence of a universal choice function, that is, a 
function that picks an element from every nonempty set in the universe of 
sets. In a language that permits quantification on class symbols this axiom 
could be stated thus: 
Axiom of Choice (strong form). 
(3 F)(V x)[x i= 0 -+ F'x E xl 
Since in ZF we cannot quantify on class symbols, the strong form can only 
be expressed in ZF by adding a constantfo to the language together with the 
axiom 
(V x)[x i= 0 -+ f~x E xl 
Why have we chosen not to do this? Because it has been proved that ZF plus 
strong choice is a conservative extension of ZF plus weak choice. 1 
Throughout this text when we refer to the Axiom of Choice (AC) we will 
mean the weak form. We will use the symbol ZFC to denote the theory 
obtained by adjoining the Axiom of Choice (weak form) to ZF. When at a 
later time we prove the relative consistency of ZF and ZFC it will be essential 
that the Axiom of Choice not be used in the proof. Consequently, in this 
chapter we will mark, with an asterisk, each theorem whose proof requires AC. 
The asterisk then warns us of results that cannot be used in the relative 
consistency proof toward which we are working. 
Let us now explore some of the consequences of the Axiom of Choice. 
*Theorem 10.3. (3 ex)[a ~ exl 
PROOF. By AC the power set of a, &>(a), has a choice function f. Using this 
choice function f we define a class G such that 
(1) 
G'x = f'(a - 1r(x»). 
But clearly a - 1r(x) is a subset of a and hence an element of &>(a) and so 
(2) f'(a - 1r(x») E a - 1f/'(x) if a - 1f/'(x) i= O. 
By the Principle of Transfinite Recursion, Theorem 7.41, there exists a 
function F defined on On so that 
(3) 
(V ex)[F'ex = G'(F ~ ex)]. 
From (1), (2), and (3) it follows that 
F'ex E a -
1f/'(F ~ ex) 
if a -
1f/'(F ~ IX) i= O.

Since a is not a proper class it follows from Proposition 7.48 that 
(3 ex)[a - 1f/(F [' ex) = 0]. 
Let exo be the smallest such ordinal and let g = F [' exo. Then Proposition 
7.49 assures us that g: exo 
~;;-;!, a. 
D 
Remark. *Theorem 10.3 assures us that every set can be well ordered and 
that every cardinal equivalence class contains an ordinal. We can now pick 
the smallest ordinal in each cardinal equivalence class as the representative 
of that class.

PROOF. If ex = ii, then ex E N by Definition 10.7. Conversely if ex E N, then 
(3 x)[ex = x]. Suppose that ii < ex, then since ii ~ ex and ex ~ x we would have 
a ~ x. But this contradicts the fact that ex is the smallest ordinal equivalent to 
x. Consequently ex ~ Ii. From Proposition 10.6(8) it then follows that IX = a. 
D 
*Proposition 10.10. a ~ b +-+ a = b. 
PROOF. If a ~ b, then since a ~ a it follows that a ~ b and hence b ~ a. 
Similarly, since b ~ b it follows that if a ~ b, then b ~ a and hence a ~ b. 
Therefore a = b. 
Conversely if a = 7), then since a ~ a it follows that a ~ b. But b ~ b 
and so a ~ b.

function f is then a strictly monotone ordinal function and so it follows that 
('V y E f3) [y ~ f'y ~ IX]. Therefore f3 ~ IX and f3 ~ a.

a = 7J it follows, from *Proposition 10.10 that a ~ b. 
0 
Remark. The Cantor-Schrader-Bernstein theorem was first proved by 
Cantor. Like the proof above, Cantor's proof used results that presuppose AC. 
In 1896 and 1898 respectively, Ernst Schroder and Felix Bernstein, inde-
pendently, gave proofs that do not require AC. Below we give such a proof, 
but note how hard we have to work when denied the use of AC. 
PROOF (Cantor-SchrOder-Bernstein). If a ~ c, then (3f)[f: a ~~~) c]. Simi-
larly if b ~ d, then (3 g)[g: b ~~~) d]. Let H'x = (g 0 f)"x. Then there exists a 
function h defined on w such that 
h'O = a - d 
h'(n + 1) = H'h'n = (g 0 f)"h'n. 
Since h'O ~ a and since g 0 f maps a into a, it follows, by induction, that 
('V n)[h'n ~ a]. Consequently ('V n)[f"h'n ~ b]. 
We next define a function F on a in the following way 
F'x = f'x 
if x E a /\ (3 n)[x E h'nJ 
= (g-l)'X if x E a /\ ('V n)[x if:. h'n]. 
Then F: a -+- b. We wish to prove that F: a !~t!) b. To prove that F is onto we 
note that if Y E b, then (3 n)[y Ef"h'nJ or ('V n)[y if:.f"h'n]. 
Suppose that (3 n)[y Ef"h'n]. Then (3 x E h'n)[y = f'x]. But x E h'n 
implies that x E a. Furthermore, from the definition of F, we see that if x E a 
and x E h'n, then F'x = f'x = y. 

10 The Axiom of Choice and Cardinal Numbers 
87 
On the other hand, suppose that (V n)[y fj:f"h'n]. As we will now show, it 
then follows that (V n) [g'y fj: h'n]. Assume that this is not the case. Then 
(3 n) [g'y E h'n]. Since h'O = a - d and since g'y Edit follows that n i= O. 
Therefore (3 m)[n = m + 1]. But h'(m + 1) = g'T'h'm and g'y E h'(m + 1). 
Since g is one-to-one it then follows that y E f"h'm; but this is a contradiction. 
And from this contradiction we conclude that (V n)[g'y ¢ h'n]. On the other 
hand since y E b, it follows that g'y E a. Therefore F'g'y = (g-l)'g'y = y. 
From this we conclude that F is onto, that is, "If/(F) = b. 
To prove that F is one-to-one assume that x E a, yEa, and F'x = F'y. From 
this we will first prove that (3 m)[x E h'mJ iff (3 m)[y E h'm]. The proof is by 
contradiction: Suppose that x E h'm and (V n)[y fj: h'n]. Then F'x = F'y 
implies thatf'x = (g - 1 )'y and hence y = (g 0 f)'x. Since x E h'm it then follows 
that y E (g 0 f)"h'm = h'(m + 1). This is a contradiction. Similarly we can 
prove that y E h'm and (V n)[x fj: h'nJ implies that x E h'(m + 1). This too is a 
contradiction. From these contradictions we conclude that (3 m)[x E h'mJ iff 
(3 m)[y E h'm]. From this and the fact that F'x = F'y it follows thatf'x = f'y 
or (g-l)'X = (g-l)'y. Since bothfand g are one-to-one it follows that x = y. 
Thus F is one-to-one. Furthermore since F is a function with domain a, it 
follows that F is a set. 
0 
Proposition 10.15. a ::::= b ...... {!P(a) ::::= {!P(b). 
PROOF. If a ::::= b, then (3f)[f: a ~~!) b]. Let F = {<x,f"x) Ix E {!P(a)}. Then 
F: {!P(a) ...... {!P(b). Furthermore, since f"x = {f'zlzEx}, it follows that if 
f"x = f"y and Z EX, thenf'z Ef"x = f"y. That is (3 WE y)[f'z = f'w]. But 
f is one-to-one; therefore z = wand hence z E y. Similarly Z E Y implies 
Z E x. Therefore x = y and hence F is one-to-one. 
Finally, if y E {!P(b) and if x = U-1)"y, then x E {!P(a) and 
F'x = f"U - l)"y = y. 
Thus F is onto, that is, if/(F) = {!P(b). 
o 
*Theorem 10.16 (Cantor). a < {!P(a). 
PROOF. Since a ::::= b implies {!P(a) ::::= &(b), it is sufficient to prove that 'IX < 
{!P(a). Since ordinals are transitive, it follows that a ~ {!P(a) and hence, by 
*Proposition 10.14, a ~ {!P(a). If ;x = {!P(a), then a::::: {!P(a) and hence 
(3h)[h:a !~!) {!P(a)].Letc = {f3Ealf3fj:h'f3}.Thenc ~ aandhencecE{!P(a). 
Consequently (3 y E a)[c = h'a]. But then 
yEC~ yfj: h'y 
~yfj:c. 
This contradiction forces the conclusion that a < {!P(a).

Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
Remark. In the foregoing argument the proof that a is not equivalent to 
&>(a) can be easily modified to prove, of any set a, that a and &>(a) are not 
equivalent. Furthermore this proof does not require AC. 
From Cantor's theorem it is easy to prove that for any set of cardinal 
numbers there exists a cardinal larger than each cardinal in the given set. 
*Proposition 10.17. a ~ N --+ (3 f3 E N)(V a E a)[a < f3]. 
PROOF. If a E a, then a ~ u(a) and hence a = ex ~ u(a). But by Cantor's 
theorem 
u(a) < &>(u(a»). 
o 
Remark. Cantor's theorem led him to the paradox of the largest cardinal. 
We formulate that paradox in the following form: Consider N the "set" of all 
cardinal numbers. By *Proposition 10.17, there exists a cardinal larger than 
any cardinal in N. But this contradicts the fact that N contains all cardinals. 
In ZF we can use this contradiction to conclude that N is not a set. 
Theorem 10.lS. &>.z(N). 
*PROOF. If N were a set, then *Proposition 10.17 leads us to the contradiction 
that there exists an element of N that is not in N. 
0 
Remark. It has been claimed that Cantor discovered the paradox of the 
largest cardinal in 1895 and communicated it to Hilbert in 1896. But the 
oldest documented evidence we have dates back only to 1899. That year 
Cantor wrote to his friend Dedekind of his concern for collections that could 
not be considered as sets because to do so would lead to a contradiction. He 
called such collections "inconsistent multipicities." It is also interesting that 
Cantor did not include the troublesome theorem in his two part memoir 
published in 1895 and 1897.

Remark. Given a set a Cantor's theorem tells us that there exists a set of 
larger cardinality, namely &lea). There is another way to produce a set of 
larger cardinality. Indeed the basic idea was understood by Cantor and used 
by him to generate cardinal numbers. We consider all possible ways to well 
order a and its subsets. As we will now prove, the set of all well orderings of a 
and its subsets, has cardinality larger than a. 
Theorem 10.19. For each set a 
(3 f3 E N)[f3 = {tXl(3f)[f: tX ~a]} /\ -,(3f)[f: f3 ~ 
a]]. 
PROOF. We consider all ordered pairs <r, x) where x c;; a and r C;; a x a. If 
r well orders x, then 
(3! f3)(3 ! J,., x)[J,., x Isom" E(X, f3)]. 
UsingJ,.,x we define a function on &l(a x a) x &lea) in the following way 
r<r, x) = J,.:'xx 
If r We x 
= 0 
otherwise. 
Since F is a function whose domain is a set its range is also a set. Let 
b = 1f/(F). Then 
YEb+-+(3 r ~ a x a)(3x ~ a)[y = F'<r,x)] 
+-+ y = 0 v (3 r ~ a x a)(3 x ~ a)[r We x /\ y = f~:xx] 
+-+ y E On /\ (3f)[f: y ~a]. 
Thus b = {tXl(3f)[f: tX ~a]}. 
If}' < tX and tX E b, then (3 f) [f: tx ~ 
a]. Furthermore f I}': }' ~ 
a, 
and so }' E b. Thus b is a transitive set of ordinals. Therefore b is an ordinal, 
that is 
(3 f3)[f3 = {txl(3f)[f: tx~a]}]. 
Furthermore if}' ~ f3 and}' < f3, then (3 g )[g: f3 ~ 
)' ] and (3 f)[f: )' ~ 
a]. 
Consequently fog: f3 ~ 
a. But this implies that f3 E f3. From this contradic-
tion we conclude that if}' ~ f3, then f3 ~ }' and so 7J = f3, that is, f3 E N. 
Finally we conclude that -, (3 f)[f: f3 ~ 
a] since otherwise we would 
have f3 E f3.

Remark. From Theorem 10.19 we can provide a second proof that N is a 
proper class, but we leave that proof as an exercise for the reader.

PROOF (By induction on n). If m ~ 0, then m = O. As our induction hypothesis 
assume that (V m)[m ~ n -+ m = n] and assume that m ~ (n + 1). It then 
follows that m # 0 and hence, for some integer p, we have m = p + 1. But 
p + 1 ~ n + 1 implies that p ~ n. (Exercise 5 above.) Then, from the induc-

*Proposition 10.33.

j'x = <x,y),

maps a one-to-one into a x b. Consequently a ~ J"a ~ a x b. Then by

Then g: a x bJ=.!..a x c. Consequently a x b ~ g"(a x b) ~ a x c and 
hence a x b ;:£ a x c.

*Proposition 10.34. OUn(A) --+ A"a ;:£ a. 
PROOF. Since a ~ a it follows that (3 h)[h: a 
!~t~) a]. Let F be defined by 
F'IX = A'h'lX, 
Then F: a onto.A"a. Furthermore if 
-
IX E a. 
B = {P E al(V IX < P)[A'h'lX =F A'h'P]}, 
then B ~ a. Therefore B is a set and B ;:£ a. Since B ~ a it follows that 
F r B: B --+ A"a. We wish to prove that this mapping is one-to-one and onto. 
For this purpose we note that if {3 E B, y E B, and F'{3 = F'y, then A'h'{3 = 
A'h'y and hence, from the definition of B, P = y. Thus F r B is one-to-one. 
Furthermore if x E A"a, then (3 P E a)[x = A'h'P]. There is then a smallest 
such P and this smallest {3 is in B. That is, (3 P E B) r x = F'P]. Therefore 
F r B is onto. 
We then have

*Proposition 10.35. a =F 0 /\ (3f)[f: a onto' b] +-+ 0 < b ;:£ a.

Furthermore, if a =1= 0, then b =1= °

Conversely if °

(3 Y 1> Y2 E b) [y 1 =1= Y2]. We then define a function F on a x b: 
F'<X2' Y2) = X2' 
F'<x, Yl) = X, 
X =1= X2 
F'<x, y) = y, otherwise. 
Then F: a x b onto' au b and by *Proposition 10.34 
au b = F"(a x b) ~ a x b. 
Proposition 10.37. a < p +-+ rx < p.

*PROOF. Since a ~ rx it follows that if rx < p, then a < p. Furthermore if 
p ~ rx, then by *Proposition 10.13 and *Proposition 10.11,

Remark. To obtain a proof that does not require AC we need only observe 
that thus far we have only used AC to prove that all sets are well ordered. Not 
since the proof of *Theorem 10.3 have we made a direct application of AC. 
This means that all of our starred theorems can be proved without AC if 
we restrict the statement of the theorem to sets that are well ordered such as 
the ordinal numbers. This observation applies to the theorems that follow.

Then g: (IX + 1) ~

by *Proposition 10.13 
o 
Proposition 10.39. IX ~ W -> ex x IX = a. 
*PROOF (By transfinite induction on IX). As our induction hypothesis we have 
J1.<IX->[J1.<W v J1. x J1.=~]. 
By *Proposition 10.13 if J1. < IX, then ~ ~ ex. If (3 J1. < IX)[~ = ex] then J1. ~ IX 
and 
IX X IX = J1. x J1. = ;;. = a. 
However if (V J1. < 1X)['jl < IX], then since J1. < W v J1. + 1 = ;;. it follows from 
Proposition 10.37 that J1. + 1 < a ~ IX. Therefore by our induction hy-
pothesis 
IX > J1. ~ W -> (J1. + 1) x (J1. + 1) = J1. + 1. 
Recall the relation Ro of Definition 7.57. By Theorem 7.58, Ro well orders 
On2 • Consequently there is an order isomorphism J o such that 
Jo IsomRo,iOn2, On). 
We wish to show that J~(IX x IX) ~ a. First we recall that an order iso-
morphism maps initial segments onto initial segments: 
J~(ROl),,{</3, y)} = (E- 1),,{J'o</3, y)} = J'o</3, y). 
then since J 0 is one-to-one 
J'o</3, y) = J~(ROl),,{</3, y)} = (ROl)"{</3, y)}. 
But if </3, y) E IX X IX and if J1. = max(/3, y), then J1. < IX and 
<'1,0) E(Rol),,{</3, y)} -> <'1, 0) Ro </3, y) 
-> max('1, 0) ~ J1. 
->'1~J1./\O~J1. 
-> <'1,0) E(J1. + 1) x (J1. + 1). 
Thus (ROl)"{</3, y)} ~ (J1. + 1) x (J1. + 1). 
Since J1. < IX it follows from the induction hypothesis that if J1. ~ W then 
(Ro 1)"{</3, y)} ~ (J1. + 1) x (J1. + 1) = J1. + 1 < ex. 
Therefore J'o</3, y) < ~ and hence J'o</3, y) < ex. 
If J1. < w, then (J1. + 1) x (J1. + 1) is finite. Hence (Ro 1)" {</3, y)} is finite 
and J'o</3, y) is finite. Since IX ~ W, J'o</3, y) < ~. 
Therefore 
J~(IX X IX) ~ a. 

10 The Axiom of Choice and Cardinal Numbers 
Since J 0 is one-to-one 
IX X IX = J~(IX X IX) ~ ex. 
But from Proposition 10.38 
Therefore IX x IX = ex. 
*Proposition 10.40. a ~ w -+ a x a = a. 
PROOF. Since a ~ a we have a x a ~ a x a. Then from Proposition 10.39 
--
-
axa=axa=a. 
*Proposition 10.41. a ~ wAF> 0 -+ a x b = au b = max(a, F). 
PROOF. If IX = max(a, F), then since a ~ a and b ~ F 
axb~axF~lXxlX. 
Then 
95 
o 
o 
If F = 1, then since a ~ W we have a x b ~ a u b and so a x b = a u b 
= a = max(a, F). 
ifF > 1, then by *Proposition 10.36, a u b ~ a x b ~ max(a,75). Further-
more since a ~ a u band b ~ a u b we have a ~ a u band 75 < au b and so 
max (a, F) ~ au b = a x b ~ max(a, F). 
o 
Remark. The natural notion of cardinal addition is that the sum a + F 
should be a u b, provided a and b are disjoint. Similarly, the product a . b 
should be a x b. *Proposition 10.41 tells us that for infinite cardinals, 
addition and multiplication are quite uninteresting. In the infinite case the 
problem of finding the sum or the product ofa and 75 is simply the problem of 
finding the larger of a and F. 
Something interesting does come up with cardinal exponentation. For its 
definition we turn to an idea introduced by Cantor. 
Definition 10.42. ab ~ {fl!: b -+ a}. 
Remark. We will read ab as "the set of mapping from b into a." That 
reading however presupposes the following result. 
Proposition 10.43. A(ab). 
PROOF. ab ~ ;JJ(b x a). 
o 

96 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
Remark. Earlier we used an to mean the n-fold cross product of a and in our 
discussion of ordinal arithmetic we used IXP to mean the 11th power of IX. Now 
we propose a third use, namely that ab shall denote the set of mapping from 
b into a. We will rely upon the context to make clear what we intend when we 
use this notation. That will be much simplier than creating new notation. 
It is a temptation to add a fourth usage and define cardinal powers by 
'lIb = abo 
But we will suppress that urge and not add an addition ambiguity to an 
already overworked notation. We will however talk about cardinal powers 
even though we will not introduce a notation for them. Thus when we write 
~~P we will always mean the set of functions from ~P into ~a. For the as-
sociated cardinal number we will write 
Proposition 10.44. 2a ~ &(a). 
PROOF. We define a function h on 2a in the following way 
h'f= {xEalf'x = I}, 
Then h: 2a -+ &(a). We wish to prove that h is one-to-one and onto. 
If bE &(a) and ifJis defined on a by 
J'x = 1,

ThenJE 2a and h'f = b. Thus h is onto. 
xEb 
XEa -
b. 
Suppose that J E 2a, g E 2a, and h'f = h'g, then 
{xEal!'x = I} = {xEalg'x = 1}. 
SinceJand g each take the value 1 at the same points in a they must also take 
the value ° 
at the same points in a and so J = g. Therefore h is one-to-one and 
hence 2a ~ &(a). 
D 
Proposition 10.45. (ab)C ~ abxc. 
PROOF. We define a function F on (aby in the following way. If J E (aby and 
y E c, thenj'y E ab, that if,j'y: b -+ a. Thus if x E b, then (f'y)'x E a. We then 
specify that F'f is a function defined on b x c by 
(F'f),<x, y) = (f'y)'x. 
ThenF'f: b x c -+ aand henceF'f E abxc. ThusF: (aby -+ abxc. We will prove 
that F is one-to-one and onto. 
If g E ab x C and if \f y E C 
J~x = g'<x, y), 
x E b

thenJy E abo Therefore if 
f'y = Jy , 
y E c, 
then f E (ab)' and g'<x, y) = (f'y)'x. Consequently F'f = g and F is onto. 
Iffl E (abY,f2 E (a b)', and F'fl = F'f2, then 
(V YEC)(V xEb)[(f~y)'x = (fiy)'x] 
(V y E c)[f~y = fiy] 
fl = f2· 
Therefore F is one-to-one. 
Since F maps (ab)" one-to-one onto ab x C it follows that (ab)" ~ ab xc.

Remark. Proposition 10.45 tells us that powers of cardinals obey a law of 
finite cardinals that we have known since we first studied powers of integers: 
From our studies of integers we know that, at least in principle, we can 
compute any finite power of any finite cardinal. But alas we cannot compute 
even such a simple infinite power as 
(1) 
2No. 
Indeed Cohen has shown that the question of what (1) is, is undecidable 
inZF. 
In the next section we will introduce the Generalized Continuum Hy-
pothesis from which we will show how to compute powers of cardinals. But 
before we do that we wish to prove two more results on the cardinality of 
unions. For their proof we need the following result. 
*Theorem 10.46. (V x E a)(3 y)cp(x, y) -+ (3f)(V x E a)cp(x,f'x)). 
PROOF. Let G be defined on a by 
G'x = lla((3 y)[o: = rank(y) 1\ cp(x, y)]). 
Then G"a is a set of ordinals. Let 0: = u(G"a) + 1. It follows from this 
that if 
(V X E a)(3 y)cp(x, y) 
then 
(3 y)[cp(x, y) 1\ rank(y) = G'x]. 
Furthermore if rank(y) = G'x then rank(y) < 0: and so y E R'IO:. 
To complete the proof we use AC to well order R~ 0: and we define f'x to be 
the first element in R'IO: for which cp(x, f'x). Here are the details. 

98 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
By *Theorem 10.3 
(3 13)(3 h)[h: 13 ~~!) R;cx]. 
Since (V x E a)(3 Y E R~cx)qJ(x, y) and since h is onto, 
(V x E a)(3 y E f3)qJ(x, h'y). 
There is then a smallest such y. Let/be a function defined on a by 
J'x = h'f1y(qJ(x, h'y», x E a 
then 
('t/ X E a)qJ(x,J'x). 
D 
Remark. Theorem 10.46 is a generalization of AC to classes. It asserts that 
given any collection of nonempty classes 
there exists a choice function/such thatJ'x E Ax for each x in a. 
*Theorem 10.47. (V x E a)[x ~ DJ --+ u(a) ~ a x b. 
PROOF. If (V X E a)[x ~ DJ, then 
(V x E a)(3jx)[ix: x ~b]. 
By *Theorem 10.46 
(1) (3J)(V x E a)[J'x: x ~b]. 
Furthermore, if x E u(a) then 
(3Y)[XEY 1\ YEa]. 
Again by *Theorem 12.46 
(2) 
(3 h)(V x E u(a) )[x E h'x 1\ h'x E a]. 
We then define a function F on u(a) in the following way 
F'x = (h'x, (f'h'x)'x), x E u(a). 
From (1) and (2) it then follows that if x E u(a) then 
X E h'x 1\ h'x E a 
and so 
(f'h'x)'x E b. 
Thus F: u(a) --+ a x b. We wish to prove that F is one-to-one. 
If x E u(a), Y E u(a), and F'x = F'y then 
h'x = h'y 1\ (f'h'x)'x = (J'h'y)'y. 

10 The Axiom of Choice and Cardinal Numbers 
But if h'x = h'y, thenf'h'x = f'h'y. Furthermore, sincef'h'x is one-to-one 
(f'h'x)'x = (f'h'y)'y -+ x = y. 
Thus F: u(a)~a x b and so 
u(a) ~ a x b. 
*Proposition 10.48. "lIn(F) /\ 01 y E b)[F"y ~ a] -+ u(F"b) ~ a x b. 
PROOF. By *Proposition 10.34 
"lIn(F) -+ F"b < b. 
99 
D 
Furthermore if x E F"b then (3 y E b)[x = F'y]. Consequently if F'y ~ a 
for each y in b, then by *Proposition 10.47 
uF"b ~- a x F"b ~ a x b.

CHAPTER 11 
Cofinality, the Generalized Continuum 
Hypothesis, and Cardinal Arithmetic 
As we promised in the last section we now take up the problem of computing 
cardinal powers. For this purpose we introduce the idea of cofinality: An 
ordinal IX is cofinal with an ordinal {3 provided that {3 ~ IX and there exists a 
strictly monotone ordinal function f that maps (3 into IX in such a way that 
every element of IX is less than or equal to some element in the range off: 
Definition 11.1. 
cof(lX, (3) A {3 ~ IX A (3f)[Smo(f) A f: {3 -+ IX A 
(V Y < IX)(3 (j < (3)[f'(j ~ y JJ. 
Remark. We read cof(lJ(, (3) as "IJ( is cofinal with (3." 
EXERCISES 
Prove the following. 
(1) 
cof(a, 0) <-> a = O. 
(2) a E K I APE K I A 0 < P ~ a --+ cof(a, p). 
(3) 
1 ~ a A a E K I --+ cof( a, 1). 
Remark. The fact that every nonzero K I ordinal is cofinal with every 
smaller nonzero K I ordinal and 0 is only cofinal with itself, tells us that the 
cofinality properties of K I ordinals are not very interesting. Indeed some 
authors formulate the definition in such a way as to exclude the K I ordinals 
from consideration.

Proposition 11.3. 0( E Kn 1\ cof(O(, f3) --+ (3 f)[f ff n, [3 1\ 0( = u(f"[3).J 
The proof is left to the reader. 
Remark. If 0( is co final with [3 and [3 < 0(, then oc can be "reached" by a 
mapping from "below" in a sense made clear by the definition. Proposition 
11.3 gives us another perspective on co finality for limit ordinals. It tells us 
that if a limit ordinal oc is co final with [3, then 0( is the union of [3 sets of ordin-
als each of which is bounded by an element of 0(. This tells us, for example, 
that w is not co final with any integer n for ifit were then w would be the union 
of n bounded sets of integers.

(3 11 ~ [3)[cof(O(, 17)JJ. 
PROOF. If a = {b < [31(V y < b)[f'y < f'bJ}, then a ~ [3. Therefore 
(3 11 ~ [3)(3 h)[h IsomE,E(I1, a)]. 
If g = f 0 h, then g: 11 --+ 0(. To prove that g is strictly monotone we note that 
if b < y < 11, then h'b < h'y, h'b E a, and h'y Ea. From the definition of a it 
follows thatf'h'b < f'h'y. That is, g'b < g'y, and hence g is strictly monotone. 

102 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
Since by hypothesis (V y < a)(3 1J < [3)[f'1J ~ y] it follows that there is a 
smallest such 1J. This smallest 1J is an element of a and so (3 v < 11)[h'v = 1J]. 
Consequently 
g'v = f'h'v = f'1J ~ y. 
Thus a is cofinal with 11. 
D 
Corollary 11.S. [3 ~ a /\ [3 ~ a --+ (3 11 ~ [3)[cof(a, 11)]. 
PROOF. If [3 ~.(J(, then (3f)[f: [3 
!;;;~, a] and so (V y < a)(3 1J < [3)[f'1J = y]. 
Therefore, by Proposition 11.7, (311 ~ [3)[cof(a, 11)]. 
D 
Proposition 11.9. cof(a, [3) /\ cof(a, y) /\ Y ~ [3 --+ (3 11 ~ y)[cof([3, 11)]. 
PROOF. If a is confinal with [3 and with y, then 
(3f)[J: [3 --+ a /\ (V r < a)(3 1J < [3)[f'1J ~ r] /\ Smo(f)] 
(3 g)[g: y --+ a /\ (V r < a)(3 1J < y)[g'1J ~ r] /\ Smo(g)]. 
In particular if 1J < y, then g'1J < a and so (3 r < [3)[f'r ~ g'1J]. There is then 
a smallest such r. 
If 
F'1J = )lif'r ~ g'1J), 
1J < y. 
Then F: y --+ [3. We wish to prove that (V v < [3)(31J < y)[F'1J ~ v]. For this 
purpose we note that if v < [3, then v ~ f'v < a. Therefore (3 1J < y)[g'1J 
~ f'v]. Since f is strictly monotone, ifr < v, then f'r < f'v ~ g'1J. Thus the 
smallest ordinal r for whichf'r ~ g'1J is greater than or equal to v. That is 
F'1J = )lif'r ~ g'1J) ~ v. 
It then follows from Proposition 11.7 that (3 11 ~ y)[cof([3, 11)].

Remark. From the results we have now proven, it is easy to show that the 
character of cofinality of any ordinal a., is a cardinal. That is, the smallest 
ordinal with which a. is cofinal is a cardinal. 
Proposition 11.11. cf(a.) E N. 
PROOF. Suppose that /3 = cf(a.). To prove that /3 is a cardinal we need only 
prove that if y ~ /3 then y ~ /3. We argue by contradiction. Suppose that 
y < /3. Then by Corollary 11.8 (3 '1 ::£ y)[cof(f3, '1)]. But from this it follows 
that /3 = cf(a.) ::£ '1 ::£ y. This is a contradiction.

Proposition 11.12. a. E N' --+ cf(a.) EN'.

Proposition 11.13. a. E KII --+ cf(a.) = cf(~a). 
PROOF. If a. E KII , then ~a is cofinal with a. by Proposition 11.6. Since a. is

cf(~a)::£ cf(a.). 
But ~a is also cofinal with cf(~a) and so by Proposition 11.9

But since a. is cofinal with cf(a.) it then follows that a. is cofinal with '1 and so

Remark. We read Reg(a.) as "a. is a regular cardinal" and we read Sing(a.) 
as "a. is a singular cardinal." 
From Proposition 11.6 we see that ~(Q is cofinal with wand so cf(~(Q) = 
w < ~(Q. Thus ~(Q is a singular cardinal. So also are ~(Q2' ~(Q3' etc. Further-
more, since cf(~o) = ~o it follows that ~o is a regular cardinal. Are there 
other regular cardinals? Yes, in fact it is easy to prove that ~" is regular if 
a.EK 1 : 
*Theorem 11.15. ~a+ 1 is regular.

Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
PROOF (By contradiction). Suppose that ~>+ 1 is singular. That is, suppose that 
~p = cf(~a+1) < ~a+1' Then (3 h)[h: ~p -+ ~a+1 = u(h"~p)]. Furthermore 
(V J < ~p)[h'J < ~>+ 1J and so ~ 
~ ~a' Then from Proposition 10.48 
~>+ 1 = u(h"~p) ~ ~a X ~p = ~a' 
From this contradiction we conclude that cf(~a+1) = ~a+1' 
D 
Remark. Let us now summarize what we know about regular and singular 
cardinals. We know that ~a is regular if IX E K,. If IX E K" we know that ~a is 
cofinal with IX and so cf(~a) ~ IX. We also know that IX ~ ~a' If IX < ~a, 
then ~a is singular. But if IY. = ~a we do not know whether ~a is regular or 
singular. Do there exist ordinals IX for which IX = ~a? Yes. To prove this we 
first prove the following result. 
Proposition 11.16. [f: a -+ NJ -+ u(f"a) E N. 
PROOF. Since {!)(f) is a set,f"a is a set, indeed it is a set of ordinals. If p = 
u(f"a), then"p ~ p. We wish to prove that 7J = p. Suppose not. Suppose that 
7J < p. Then (3 x E a)["p < j'x EraJ. Therefore j'x ~ p and since j'x E N 
j'x =j'x ~"p. 
This is a contradiction. Therefore "p = p and u(f"a) E N. 
D 
Corollary 11.17. 
[f: a -+ NJ 1\ (3 x E a)[f'x E N'J -+ u(f"a) EN'. 
PROOF. By Proposition 11.16, u(f"a) E N. If (3 x E a)[j'x E N'J, then since 
j'x ~ u(f"a) it follows that u(f"a) EN'. 
D 
Proposition 11.18. (3 IX)[IX = 
~a]. 
PROOF. If we define h recursively by 
h'O = ~o 
h'(n + 1) = ~h'n' 
then h: OJ < N'. By Corollary 11.17, u(h"OJ) EN'. Thus (3 1X)[~a = u(h"OJ) 1\ 
IX ~ ~a]. If IX < ~a, then (3 n)[1X < h'nJ. Therefore ~a < ~h'n = h'(n + 1) 
~ ~a' From this contradiction we conclude that IX = ~a'

Inacc(~<x) as "~<x is inaccessible."

Does there exist a weakly inaccessible cardinal? We do not know. We do 
know that we cannot prove the existence of a weakly inaccessible cardinal 
in ZF. How this is proved we will discuss later. For the moment let us be 
content to discuss what it means. For one thing it means that if we chose to 
do so we could add to ZF an axiom asserting that there does not exist a 
weakly inaccessible cardinal and be assured that the resulting system is 
consistent if ZF is consistent. But we do not like axioms that say that things 
do not exist. We prefer axioms that enrich rather than impoverish. Perhaps 
we would like to add an axiom that says that weakly inaccessible cardinals do 
exist. May we do so without fear that we will produce an inconsistent theory? 
Probably so but we do not know. 
Let us now turn to the problem of computing cardinal powers. It may come 
as a surprise that in ZF we cannot compute such a simple power as 
(1) 
Let us review the problem. By definition, (1) is the cardinality ofthe set of all 
functions that map w into 2. We can think of any such function as a sequence 
of zeros and ones. But any such sequence can also be thought of as the binary 
representation of a real number that lies between 0 and 1. Thus (1) is the 
cardinality of the set of real numbers that lie between 0 and 1. But that is also 
the cardinality of the set of all real numbers. 
About the set 2~o we know that 2~o ~ 9(w) and from Cantor's Theorem 
we know that 9(w) > ~o. Thus 
2~O > ~o. 
The question then is whether there exist cardinalities intermediate between 
2Rii 
and ~o. Is every infinite set of reals either equivalent to w or to the set of all 
reals? If the answer to that questions is yes, then 
2Rii = ~1' 
If the answer is no, then 
For the purposes at hand we assume the answer is yes. Thus we assume the 
Continuum Hypothesis. 
CH. 
2~o = ~1' 
But this assumption alone is not enough to settle all questions about 
cardinal powers. So we also assume the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis.

PROOF. By definition ~" inaccessible implies ~" weakly inaccessible. Con-
versely 
Inf(x) 1\ X < ~" -+ (3 fJ)[x = ~p 1\ {3 < (x]. 
Since (X E K n, {3 + 1 < (X hence ~p+ 1 < ~IX. But by GCH

*Theorem 11.21. Inf(b) 1\ 2 ~ a ~ &'(b) -+ ;;, = &'(b).

PROOF. By Proposition 10.44 &'(b) = 2b. Therefore if a ~ &'(b), then a ~ 2b

Since ~y c ~2 it follows that! E ~~fI and so

Furthermore since a E Kn 
(3 y < a)[ b ~ ~y < ~a]. 
Therefore f E ~~/l, i.e.,! E u (a). 
Thus ~~/l = u(a) and hence 
~~/l = u(a). 
Further if x E a, then (3 y < a) [x = ~~/l]. If in addition y < f3 
~~/l ~ ~~P = 2l-tp < ~a' 
On the other hand if f3 ~ y then by *Corollary 11.22

Definition 11.24. Oxeac'x ~ {glg!Fn a 1\ (V x E a) [g'x E COx]}.

that this is a reasonable generalization of the cross product of two sets note 
that if a = 2 and if g E Oxe2c'xthen g!Fn 2 1\ gOO E coO 1\ g'l E cOl, i.e., 
(g'O, g'l) E coO x c'l. Conversely if (x, y) E COO x c'l and if we define g on 
2 by gOO = X 1\ g'l = y then g E Oxe2C'X. Clearly there is a natural one-to-
one correspondence between Oxe2C'X and coO x c'l.

If we define d on a by 
d'x = {(f'z)'x Iz E bOx}, x E a

d'x < cox and hence cox - d'x =F O. Therefore by AC

CHAPTER 12 
Models 
We turn now to the very interesting subject of models of set theory. 
Intuitively by a model of set theory we mean a system in which the axioms 
and theorems of ZF are true. Such a system must consist of a domain of 
objects that we interpret as the universe V of our theory and a binary relation 
that we interpret as the E-relation of our theory. 
Assuming consistency there is a model of ZF consisting of a universe 
of "sets" V on which there is defined an "E-relation." Given such a universe 
V it is possible that some subclass A of V together with some relation R on 
A is also a model of ZF. With A ~ V and R ~ A x A the language of ZF 
is adequate for the development of a theory of such internal models. Our 
next objective is to make the foregoing ideas precise and thereby compel ZF 
to tell us about some of its models. 
In order to define "model" we first introduce the idea of a structure or 
relational system. For each nonempty class A and each relation R ~ A x A 
we introduce the term 
[A,R] 
which we call a structure (or relational system); A is the universe of this 
structure and the elements of A we call individuals. 
We next define "the structure [A, R] satisfies the wff cp." Our definition 
is by induction on the number of logical symbols in cpo For this purpose we 
assume..." 
A, and V as primitive. 
Definition 12.1. 
(1) 
[A, R] F a E b A a E A AbE A A aRb. 
(2) 
[A, R] F ..., 1/1 A..., [[A, R] F 1/1].

(4) 
[A, R] F (V x)l/J(x) A (V X E A)[[A, R] F I/J(x)]' 
Remark. We read [A, R] F cp as "the structure [A, R] satisfies cp." With 
the understanding that each term [A, R] and the satisfaction symbol F 
occur only in contexts covered by Definition 12.1 it is clear that these symbols 
can be eliminated from our language, that is, 
[A, R] F cp 
is an abbreviation for a wff of our language. 
If [A, R] F cp we say that [A, R] is a model of cp. Moreover [A, R] is a 
model of a collection of wffs provided [A, R] F cp for each cp in the collection. 
In order to prove that a certain structure [A, R] is a model of a given wff we 
must prove a certainwffin ZF namely the well-formed formula [A, R] F cp. 
We will be particularly interested in structures for which R is the usual 
E-relation. Such a structure we call a standard structure. 
Definition 12.2. [A, R] is a standard structure iff R = E n A 2. 
Definition 12.3. A F cp A [A, E n A 2] F cp. 
Definition 12.4.

(2)

(3) 
[I/J 1\ I]]A A I/JA 1\ I]A. 
(4) 
[(V x)I/J(X)]A A (V X E A)[I/JA(X)]' 
Remark. From Definition 12.4 we see that cpA is simply the wff obtained 
from cp by replacing each occurrence of a quantified variable (V x) by (V X E A). 
Proposition 12.5. (1) If cp is closed then 
[A F cp] ~ cpA. 
(2) If all free variables occurring in cp are among aI' ... , an then 
al E A 1\ ... 1\ an E A --;. [[A F cp] ~ cpA]. 
PROOF. We consider (1) to be the special case of (2) with n = 0, and so we 
need only prove (2). This we do by induction on the number of logical 
symbols in cp. We assume that aI' ... , an E A. 
If cp is of the form a E b and if a and b are among al> ... , an then 
aEb 1\ aEA 1\ bEA~aEb 
and so 

12 Models 
113 
If cp is of the form ,1jJ, then all of the free variables of IjJ are among 
ai' ... , an. From the induction hypothesis 
Therefore 
and hence 
If cp is of the form IjJ /\ 11, then all of the free variables of IjJ and of 11 are 
among al , ••• , an. As our induction hypothesis we have 
and 
Therefore 
Hence 
If cp is of the form ('if x)ljJ(x), then there is an x that is not among al , ... , an 
and all of the free variables of ljJ(x) are among ai' ... , an, x. From the induc-
tion hypothesis 
X E A -+ [[A 1= ljJ(x)] +-+ IjJA(X)] 
and hence 
[x E A -+ A 1= ljJ(x)] +-+ [x E A -+ IjJA(X)]. 
Since x is not among ai' ... , an we may generalize on x and from properties 
of logic we conclude that 
('if x E A)[A 1= ljJ(x)] +-+ ('if x E A)IjJA(X). 
Hence 
o 
Remark. Proposition 12.5 is a basic result. It assures us that if cp is closed 
A is a model of cp if and only if cpA is a theorem in ZF. 
Suppose that A 1= cp and cp is equivalent to 1jJ, i.e., cp +-+ 1jJ. Does it follow 
that A 1= 1jJ? To answer this question we need a result from logic for which 
we review the axioms for our logic and the rules of inference.

it has a proof and indeed by hypothesis a proof in which each nonlogical 
axiom is satisfied by A. Suppose that the sequence of wff 
tll,···,tlm 
is such a proof. Then tim is cp and each tlk is either an axiom or is inferred from 
previous formulas in the sequence by one of the rules of inference. Our 
procedure is to show that the sequence 
til"'" tim 
can be modified to produce a proof of (2). More precisely we will prove by 
induction that for each tlb k = 1, ... , m, if all of the free variables in tlk are 
among bl , ... , bp then

Remark. From Theorem 12.6 we see that if a proof of a wff cp requires 
only the logical axioms then every nonempty class A will be a model of cp. 
In particular every nonempty class A is a model of the logical axioms and 
if two wffs are logically equivalent, i.e., 
i-LACP -1/1 
then a nonempty class A is a model of cp iff it is a model of 1/1. 
We are interested in classes A that are models of ZF. Since there are 
infinitely many axioms for ZF the assertion that A is a model of ZF is the 
assertion that each wff in a certain infinite collection of wffs is a theorem 
in ZF. This assertion we abbreviate as the metastatement, A ~ ZF. 
From Theorem 12.6 we see that if A ~ ZF then every theorem of ZF 
holds in A, that is, A satisfies each theorem of ZF. In the next section we will 
give conditions on A that assure that A ~ ZF. One requirement for most 
results of that section is that A be transitive. 
Definition 12.7. STM(A, cp) A Tr(A) /\ A ~ cp. 
Remark. By a standard transitive model of ZF we mean a nonempty 
transitive class A that satisfies each axiom of ZF, i.e., for each axiom cp 
STM(A, cp). 
Although we restrict our discussion to standard transitive models of ZF this 
theory nevertheless encompasses a large class of models of ZF as we see from 
the following theorem. 
Theorem 12.8 (Mostowski). If R S A 2 /\ R Wfr A /\ (V X E A)('1 YEA)

[A, R] ~ q>(a 1, ••• , an) +-+ B ~ q>(F'a 1, ••• , F'an). 
PROOF. (1) If R Wfr A A X E A it then follows that (R - 1)" {x} is a set. Therefore 
if f !F n(R - 1)" {x} then 1f1(f) is a set. Let 
K = {f1(3 z ~ A)[f !Fnz A (\7'xEZ)[1'X = {f'YlyRx} A 
(R-l)"{X} ~ z]}. 
Then any two functions in K have the same values at any point common to 
their domains: Otherwise there would exist an f and 9 in K and an X in 
!!iJ(f) n !!iJ(g) such that f(x) =1= g(x). If c = {x E !!iJ(f) n !!iJ(g)I1'x =1= g'x} 
then c =1= 0 A C ~ A. Therefore (3 x E c)[c n (R-1),,{x} = 0]. Since x E c 
(R-1)"{x} ~ !!iJ(f) A (R-1),,{x} ~ !!iJ(g). 
Then Y R x implies1'Y = g'y and hence 
1'x = {f'Yly R x} = {g'YIY R x} = g'x. 
This is a contradiction. 
Furthermore eachfin K is one-to-one, for otherwise 
(3 f E K)(3 x E !!iJ(f)) (3 Y E !!iJ(f)) [x =1= y A 1'x = 1'y]. 
If c = {x E !!iJ(f)1(3 Y E £tJ(f))[x =1= Y A 1'x = 1'Y]} then c =1= 0 A C ~ A. 
Therefore c has an R -minimal element, i.e., (3 x E c )[c n (R - 1)" {x} = 0]. 
Since x E C, 
(3 Y E !!iJ(f)) [x =1= y A 1'x = 1'y]. 
But 
1'x = {f'zlz R x} 
and 1'Y = {f'wlw R y}. 
Therefore if z R x, then 
1'z E 1'x = 1'Y 
and hence 
(3w)[w R Y A 1'w = 1'z]. 
Since x is an R-minimal element of c and z R x,J'w = 1'z implies that w = z, 
that is, 
z R x -+ z R y. 
By a similar argument we obtain z Ry -+ z R x and hence from the hy-
potheses of our theorem we conclude that x = y. This is a contradiction.

Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
If 
F = v(K) 
and if (a, x) E F /\ (a, y) E F then (:3 ! E K)(:3 g E K)[x = j'a /\ y = g'a]. 
But since a E ~(f) n ~(g),f'a = g'a, i.e., x = y. Therefore F is a function. 
Furthermore (V! E K)(V x E ~(f)) [F'x = j'xJ; consequently 
F'x = j'x = {f'yly R x} = {F'yly R x}. 
From this it follows that F is one-to-one, for if not there is an x and a y in 
~(F) for which F'x = F'y but x i= y. From Proposition 9.4 it then follows 
that there is an R-minimal x in ~(F) for which (:3 y E ~(F)) [x i= y /\ F'x = 
F'y]. Then 
F'x = {F'zlz R x} = {F'wlw R y} = F'y. 
From this and the defining property of x it then follows that z R y if and only 
if z R x and hence x = y. This is a contradiction. 
Since 
~(F) = U ~ (J) 
JEK 
and! E K implies ~(f) ~ A it follows that ~(F) ~ A. If A -
~(F) i= 0 then 
by Proposition 9.4, A -
~(F) has an R-minimal element, that is 
(:3 x E A -
~(F)) [A -
~(F) n (R-1),,{x} = 0]. 
By Proposition 9.3 there is a subset a of A that is the R -1 closure of {x}, i.e., 
[{x} ~ a ~ A /\ (Vy)(Vz)[y R z /\ Z E a -4- y E aJ]. 
Furthermore each element of a is "connected" to x by a finite R -chain, i.e., 
(V YEa)(:3 n)(:3 f) [f: n + 1 -4- a /\ j'0 = X /\ j'n = y /\ 
(Vi < n)[j'(i + l)Rj'iJ]. 
Since x is an R-minimal element of A -
~(F) 
An (R- 1),,{x} ~ ~(F). 
By definition of K if z E ~(F) then (R - 1)" {z} ~ ~(F). Since each element of 
a is connected to x by a finite R-chain it follows by induction on the length 
of such chains that a -
{x} ~ ~(F). We then define g by 
g = (F I (a -
{x})) v {(x, F"(R-1)"{X})}. 
Thus ~(g) ~ A /\ (V z E ~(g)) [z = x v z i= x]. 
If z = x then 
g'x = F"(R-l)"{X} = {F'ylyRx}. 

12 Models 
Furthermore y R x implies YEa -
{x} and hence g'y = F'y. Therefore 
g'x = {g'yjy R x}. 
If z # x then since z E f0(g), g'z = F'z. But 
F'z = {F'yjy R z}. 
119 
If y R z and z E a, then yEa. Furthermore since z is connected to x by a 
finite R-chain and since R is well founded, y # x. Then g'y = F'yand 
g'z = {g'yjy R z}. 
Since a is the domain of g and a is closed under R - I it follows that g E K. 
Hence x E a ~ f0(F). This is a contradiction from which we conclude that 
f0(F) = A. 
Thus if B = F"A then 
F: A ~~I~IB. 
Furthermore a E b /\ b E B implies that (3 x E A)[a E b /\ b = F'x]. But 
F'x = {F'yjyRx}. 
Thus (3 y)[y R x /\ a = F'y], i.e., a E B and hence B is transitive. 
AlsoaEA /\ bEA /\ aRb-+F'aE {F'yjyRb} = F'b. Therefore 
F IsomR, E(A, B). 
We have now proved (1) and (2). Since (3) is the special case of (4) with 
n = 0 it is sufficient to prove (4). This we do by induction on the number, n, of 
logical symbols in cp. If n = 0, then cp is of the form a E band 
[A, R] F a E b +-+ a E A /\ bE A /\ aRb. 
Since F IsomR, E(A, B) 
a, b E A -+ [a R b +-+ F'a E F'b]. 
But since F'a E Band F'b E B we have 
a, b E A -+ [F'a E F'b +-+ B F F'a E F'b]. 
Therefore 
a, b E A -+ [[A, R] 1= a E b +-+ B 1= F'a E F'b]. 
If cp is of the form ,ljI and all of the free variables of cp are among aI' ... , an 
then so are the free variables of ljI. From the induction hypothesis if 
a I E A /\ ... /\ an E A then 
[A, R] F ljI(a b ... , an) +-+ B F ljI(F'a l , ... , F'an), 
,[A, R] F ljI(a l , ... , an) +-+ ,B F ljI(F'a l , ... , F'an), 
[A, R] F ,ljI(a l , ... , an) +-+ B 1= ,ljI(F'ab ···, F'an)·

If cp is of the form t/J /\ 1] and all of the free variables of cp are among

hypothesis if al E A /\ ... /\ an E A then

[A, R] ~ 1](al , ... , an) ~ B ~ 1](F'al , ... , F'an). 
Therefore 
[A, R] ~ t/J(a l , ... , an) /\ [A, R] ~ lJ(a l, ... , an) ~ B ~ t/J(F'a l , ... , F'an) 
/\ B ~ 1](F'al, ... , F'an). 
Hence 
[A, R] ~ [t/J(al' ... , an) /\ 1](al' ... , an)] ~ B F [t/J(F'a l , ... , F'an)

If cp is oLthe form ('</ x)t/J(x) and if all of the free variables of cp are among

of t/J(x) are among at, ... , an, x. From the induction hypothesis if 
a I E A /\ ... /\ an E A then 
X E A ~ [[A, R] ~ t/J(x, at, ... , an) ~ B ~ t/J(F'x, F'a l, ... , F'an)]. 
From the self-distributive law for implication 
[x E A ~ [A, R] ~ t/J(x, at, . .. ,an)] ~ [x E A ~ B ~ t/J(F'x, F'at, ... , F'an)] 
Since x is not among at, ... , an we have on generalizing and distributing 
[('</ x) [x E A ~ [A, R] ~ t/J(x, at, ... , an)] 
~ 
('</ x) [x E A ~ B ~ t/J(F'x, F'a l, ... , F'an)]. 
Since F maps A one-to-one onto B 
('</ x) [x E A ~ B ~ t/J(F'x, F'a l, ... , F'an)] 
~ 
('</ x)[x E B ~ B ~ t/J(x, F'a l , ... , F'an)]. 
Therefore 

CHAPTER 13 
Absoluteness 
A basic part of the interpretation of our theory is that each wff cp(x) expresses 
a property that a given individual a has or does not have according as cp(a) 
holds or does not hold. Then cpA (x) expresses the "same" or "corresponding" 
property for the universe A. 
Consider, for example, the existence of an empty set. Earlier we proved 
that there exists an individual a, called the empty set, having the property 
(V x)[x ¢ a]. 
From the Axiom of Regularity it follows that every nonempty class A, as a 
universe, has this property. In particular, the class of infinite cardinal numbers 
N' contains an individual a with the property 
(V X E N')[x ¢ a]. 
The set in N' that plays the role of the empty set is ~o, a set that is far from 
empty. Thus when viewed from within the universe N', ~o is empty but when 
viewed from "without," i.e., in V, ~o is not empty. 
There are however properties cp(x) and universes A such that an individual 
of A has the property when viewed from within A iff it has the property when 
viewed from without. Such a property is said to be absolute with respect to A. 
Definition 13.1. 
(1) 
cp Abs A A [cpA +-+ cp] 
if cp is closed. 
(2) 
cp Abs A A a1 E A /\ ... /\ an E A -+ [cpA +-+ cp] 
where a1, ••• , an is a complete list of all of the free variables in cp. 
121 

122 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
Remark. We read cp Abs A as" cp is absolute with respect to A." 
Proposition 13.2. If cp Abs A /\ ljJ Abs A then 
(1) 
cp /\ ljJ Abs A, 
(2) 
ICP Abs A. 
The proofs are left to the reader. 
Remark. From Proposition 13.2 we see that if cp and ljJ are each absolute 
with respect to A then cp v ljJ, cp --+ ljJ, and cp ~ 
ljJ are also absolute with 
respect to A. The interesting questions about absoluteness center around 
q uan tifiers. 
Proposition 13.3. If q> Abs A, ifljJ Abs A, if a l , ... , am, b l , ... , bn is a list of 
distinct variables containing all of the free variables of cp and of ljJ, and if 
then generalizing on ai' ... , am, 
PROOF. Clearly if b l , .•. , bn E A then 
[(\1' Xl' ••. ,xm)[cp --+ ljJ] --+ (\1' Xl' ••• ,Xm E A)[cp --+ ljJ]]. 
The formal details consist of observing that on the hypothesis 
we can deduce cp --+ ljJ and hence 
Then by generalization 
By iteration 
On the other hand we can deduce from the hypotheses 
bl , ..• , bn E A, (\1' Xl"" ,Xm E A)[cp --+ ljJ], cp 
the following wffs 
(\1'x l , ... ,Xm E A)[cp --+ ljJ], 
at E A --+ (\1' X2"'" Xm E A)[cp --+ ljJ]. 

13 Absoluteness 
123 
But a basic hypothesis of our theorem is that under the hypotheses listed 
above 
a l EA. 
Hence by modus ponens we can deduce 
(V X2 , ••• , Xm E A)[cp ~ r/I]. 
Repeating this we arrive finally at 
from which one application of the deduction theorem gives that on the 
hypotheses 
we can deduce 
cp ~ r/I. 
Then by generalization we deduce 
(V XI) ... (V xm)[CP ~ r/I] 
and finally, by the deduction theorem, 
We then have 
bl,···, bn E A ~ [(V XI' ... ' Xm E A)[cp ~ r/I] ~ 
(V XI'··· ,xm)[cp ~ r/I]]. 
bl, ... ,bnEA~ [(VXI,···,Xm)[cp~r/I]­
(Vx l,··· ,Xm E A)[cp ~ r/I]]. 
Since cp and r/I are each absolute w.r.t. A 
bl, ... , bn E A /\ al, ... , am E A ~ [cp _cpA], 
bl, ... ,bnEA /\ al, ... ,amEA ~ [r/I_r/lA]. 
Hence by generalization, properties of equivalence, and the self-distributive 
law, if b l , ••• , bn E A then 
[(V Xl> ... ,Xm E A)[cp ~ r/I] -
(V XI' ... ,Xm E A)[cpA ~ r/lA]]. 
We then conclude that if b l , •.. , bn E A, 
[(V Xl, ... ,xm)[cp ~ r/I] -
(V XI' .•. ,Xm E A)[cpA ~ r/lA]].

Corollary 13.4. If cp Abs A, if r/I Abs A, if ai' ... , am, bl, ... , bn is a list of 
distinct variables containing all of the free variables in cp and in r/I, and if 
bl, ... , bn E A /\ r/I(al, ... , am, bl, ... , bn) ~ ai' ... , am E A 
then generalizing on al, ... , am, (V XI'···' xm)[CP -

Proposition 13.5. If cp Abs A, if ai' ... , am, bl, ... , bn is a list of distinct 
variables containing all of the free variables in cp and if

PROOF. Since

Since cp is absolute w.r.t. A

PROOF. If all of the free variables of cp and of IjJ are among bl, ... , bn then by 
Theorem 12.6 
bl, ... , bn E A -jo [cpA _ IjJA]. 
Therefore if b l , ... , bn E A

PROOF. If all of the free variables of (3 x)cp{x) are among ai' ... , an then by 
Theorem 12.6 
Then 
ai' ... , an E A -jo [(3 x)cp{x) -jo (3 X E A)cpA{X)].

Furthermore there exists an x distinct from ai' ... , an. Then since cp(x) is 
absolute with respect to A. 
ai' ... , an E A /\ X E A --+ [cp(x) +-+ cpA(X)]. 
Therefore 
ai' ... , an E A --+ [(3 X E A)cp(x) +-+ (3 X E A)cpA(X)]

empty class that satisfies each nonlogical axiom in some proof of cp +-+ (V x)t/I(x) 
and some proof of cp +-+ (3 x)l'/(x), if t/I(x) Abs A and if I'/(x) Abs A then 
cp Abs A. 
PROOF. If all of the free variables of cp, (V x)t/I(x), and (3 x)l'/(x) are among 
a l , ... , an then by Theorem 12.6 
ai' ... , an E A --+ [cpA +-+ (V X E A)t/lA(x)]. 
ai' ... , an E A --+ [cpA +-+ (3 X E A)I'/A(X)]. 
Also since t/I(x) and I'/(x) are absolute 
ai' ... , an E A /\ X E A --+ [t/I(x) +-+ t/lA(x)], 
ai' ... , an E A /\ X E A --+ [I'/(x) +-+ I'/A(X)]. 
From this, choosing X distinct from ai' ... , an 
ai' ... , an E A --+ [(V X E A)t/I(x) +-+ (V X E A)t/lA(x)], 
ai' ... , an E A --+ [(3 X E A)I'/(x) +-+ (3 X E A)I'/A(X)]. 
Then since cp +-+ (V x)t/I(x) is a theorem 
Also

Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
Remark. Satisfaction and absoluteness have been defined for wffs. Most 
of our theorems in ZF are however wffs in the wider sense (Definition 4.1). 
It is therefore convenient to extend our definitions to wffs in the wider sense. 
Definition 13.9. If cp is a wff in the wider sense then 
(1) 
[A, R] F cp A [A, R] F cp*, 
(2) 
cpA ~ (cp*)A, 
(3) 
cp Abs A A cp* Abs A. 
It would however be helpful to be able to determine the absoluteness of 
wffs in the wider sense without first reducing them to primitive terms. For 
this purpose the following substitution theorem is useful. 
Proposition 13.10. If A f= 0, if cp(b l , ••• , bn) Abs A and if A(B1) /\ ••• 
/\ .;(((Bn) /\ bl = BI Abs A /\ ... /\ bn = Bn Abs A then CP(BI' ... , Bn) Abs 
A. 
PROOF (By induction on n). If n = 1 then 
cp(B 1) +-+ ('t/ X1)[X1 = BI -+ cp(b l )] 
+-+ (3 X1)[X1 = BI /\ cp(b 1)]. 
If cp(b 1) Abs A and bl = BI Abs A then [b i = Bl -+ cp(b l )] Abs A and 
[b l = Bl /\ cp(b l )] Abs A. Then by Theorem 13.8, cp(B1) Abs A. 
The induction step is obvious and hence omitted.

Definition 13.11. 
(1) x A ~ x n A.

{x I cp(X)}A ~ {x E A I cpA(X)}. 
Proposition 13.12. If A is transitive and x E A then

(5) 
[{x I cp(x)} E {y I ljt(y)}]A +-+ [{x I cp(X)}A E {y I ljt(y)}A]. 
PROOF. (l) If A is transitive and x E A, then x ~ A. Therefore x A = x n A = x. 
(2) Obvious from (1). 
(3) [x E {Ylcp(y)}]* +-+ cp(x). 
Hence

Then x E A implies

(4) 
[{y I cp(y)} E x]* +-> (3 z)[z E x /\ (\f y)[y E Z +-> cp(y)]]. 
Hence 
[{y I cp(y)} E X]A +-> (3 Z E A) [z E X /\ (\f y E A)[y E Z +-> cpA(y)]J. 
Then A transitive and x E A implies 
[{YI cp(y)} E X]A +-> (3 zEit) [z E X /\ (\f y E A)[y E Z +-> cpA(y)]]

xE{xlcp(x)}A+-+XEA /\ cpA (x)

Remark. The class {Xlcp(X)}A is the class {xlcp(x)} relativized to A. By 
definition {x I cp(X)}A is the class of individuals in A for which cpA(X) holds. 
From Proposition 13.14 we see that if cp(x) is absolute with respect to A then 
{Xlcp(X)}A is simply the class of individuals in A for which cp(x) holds. 
Proposition 13.15. If A is non empty and transitive and if {y I cp(y)} is a set, then 
[a = {yl cp(y)}] Abs A

Remark. We turn now to the problem of establishing the absoluteness 
properties of certain wffs and terms. Our ultimate goal is to find conditions 
on A that wiII assure us that A is a standard transitive model of ZF.

a = b Abs A.

I3 Absoluteness 
129 
PROOF. 
(1) 
a ~ b~('v'X)[XEa~XEb]. 
Since A is transitive a E A implies a ~ A, i.e., x E a 1\ a E A implies x E A. 
From Propositions 13.17, 13.3, and 13.6 it then follows that 
a ~ b Abs A. 
(2) a = b ~ a ~ b 1\ b ~ a. 
D 
Remark. The requirement in Proposition 13.18 that A be transitive cannot 
be dropped. For example if A = {O, 1, {O, 1, 2}, {O, 1, 3}} then from an 
internal vantage point the sets {O, 1, 2} and {O, 1, 3} are indistinguishable, i.e., 
(V x E A)[x E {O, 1, 2} ~x E {O, 1, 3}]. 
Since the membership property is absolute with respect to any class 
(Proposition 13.17) if b E A then those individuals in A that play the role of 
elements of b are individuals in V that are elements in b. But not conversely. 
In the foregoing example we have, relative to A 
o E {O, 1, 2}, 
1 E {O, 1, 2}, 
2 ¢ {O, 1, 2}.

Similarly with subsets, if A is a nonempty transitive class then contain-
ment is absolute with respect to A. This means that if b E A then every 
element of A that is a subset of b relative to A is a subset of b in the "real" 
universe V. But not conversely. There may be a subset of b that is not an 
element of A. Indeed if A is transitive but not supertransitive there must be at 
least one element of A having a subset that is not in A. 
Proposition 13.19. If A is nonempty and transitive then 
(1) 0 Abs A, 
(2) 
[a u b] Abs A, 
(3) 
{a,b} AbsA, 
(4) 
u(a) Abs A, 
(5) 
[a - b] Abs A. 
PROOF. (1) Since a =I a Abs A we have 
OA = {x E A I [x =I X]A} = {x E A Ix =I x} = O. 
(2) If a, b E A then 
[aub]A = {xEAI[xEa v xEb]A} 
= {xEAlxEa v xEb} 
= {xlxEa v xEb} 
= a u b.

(3) If a, b E A then 
{a,b}A = {xEAI[x = a v x = b]A} 
= {xix = a v x = b} 
= {a, b}. 
(4) If a E A then 
[u(a)]A = {xEAI(3YEA)[XEY 1\ YEa]A}

Remark. The proofs of several of the theorems to follow are similar to the 
proof of Proposition 13.18 involving repeated applications of foregoing 
theorems on absoluteness. To avoid rather dull repetitions we omit most of 
the details. 
Proposition 13.20. If A is nonempty and transitive then 
(1) 
Tr(a) Abs A, 
(2) 
Ord (a) Abs A. 
PROOF. 
(1) 
Tr(a) ~ (\I x)[x E a --> x c a]. 
(2) 
Ord(a) ~ 
Tr(a) 1\ 
(\I x, y)[x E a 1\ YEa --> x E y V X = Y v Y E x]. 
o 
Remark. Proposition 13.20 assures us that restricting the definition of 
ordinal number to a nonempty transitive class does not enable any new 
objects to qualify as ordinals. Consequently if A is a standard transitive 
model of ZF then the class of ordinals "in" A is a subclass of On, i.e., 
OnA = {x E A I [Ord(x)]A} = {x E A IOrd(x)} = On n A. 
Proposition 13.21. If A is nonempty and transitive then

Remark. We turn now to an investigation of conditions on a class A that 
are necessary for A to be a model of ZF, that is, for A to be a model of the 
following wffs. 
Axiom 1 (Extensionality). (V x, y, z)[x = Y 1\ X E Z ~ Y E Z]. 
Axiom 2 (Pairing). (V x, y)Jt({x, y}). 
Axiom 3 (Unions). (V x)Jt(u(x»). 
Axiom 4 (Powers). (V x)Jt(9(x») . 

13 Absoluteness 
133 
Axiom 5 (Schema of Replacement). 
(V x)[(V y, z, w)[cp(y, z) 1\ cp(y, w) --+ z = w] --+ A ({zl(3 Y E x)cp(y, z)})] . 
Axiom 6 (Regularity). (V x) [x =I- 0 --+ (3 y)[y E x 1\ Y n x = 0]]. 
Axiom 7 (Infinity). A(w). 
Proposition 13.24. A =I- 0 1\ Tr(A) --+ STM(A, Ax. 1). 
PROOF. Since Axiom 1 assures us that 
(1) 
x = Y 1\ X E Z --+ Y E z 
holds for all x, y, and z, it also assures us that (1) holds for all x, y, Z E A, that 
is 
(V x, y, Z E A)[x = Y 1\ X E Z --+ Y E Z]. 
But since (1) is absolute with respect to A, it follows that 
(V x, y, Z E A)[x = Y 1\ X E Z --+ Y E Z]A. 
But this is Axiom 1 relativized to A, i.e., [Ax. I]A. 
Since Axiom 1 is closed we have from Proposition 12.5 
A FAx. 1 +-+ [Ax. I]A. 
Hence A satisfies Axiom 1, i.e., 
A FAx. 1. 
Since A is non empty and transitive we conclude that A is a standard 
transitive model of Axiom 1. 
D 
Propositibn 13.25. If A is nonempty and transitive then A is a standard transitive 
model of the Axiom of Pairing iff 
(V x, Y E A)[{x, y} E A]. 
PROOF. Ax. 2 +-+ (V x, y)(3 z)[z = {x, y}]. Since A is nonempty and transitive 
A is a standard transitive model of Axiom 2 if and only if 
(1) 
(V x, y E A)(3 Z E A)[z = {x, y}]A. 
However since c = {a, b} is absolute w.r.t. A, (1) holds if and only if 
(V x, y E A)(3 Z E A)[z = {x, y}] 
that is, (1) holds if and only if 
(V x, y E A)[{x, y} E A]. 
D 
Remark. Earlier we proved that the empty set, the union of two sets, un-
ordered pairs, and the union of a set are absolute terms with respect to a 

134 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
nonempty transitive class A. Curiously ordered pairs are not absolute with 
respect to such classes. 
Suppose that A is the nonempty transitive class {O, I} then 
[<0, l)]A = {xEAI[x = {O} v x = {O, I}]A} 
= {xEAlx = {O} v x = {O, I}} = {{O}} = <0,0). 
This pathology disappears if A is a nonempty transitive model of the 
Axiom of Pairing. 
Proposition 13.26. STM(A, Ax. 2) -
<a, b) Abs A. 
PROOF. If A is a standard transitive model of Axiom 2 and if a, b E A, then 
{a} E A and {a, b} EA. Then 
[<a,b)]A = {xEAI[x = {a} v x = {a,b}]A} 
{x E A I x = {a} v x = {a, b}} 
{xix = {a} v x = {a, b}} 
= <a, b). 
o 
Remark. From Proposition 13.26 and the substitution property, Proposi-
tion 13.10 it follows that ordered triples, ordered quadruples, etc. are absolute 
with respect to standard transitive models of the Axiom of Pairing.

Theorem 13.31. If A is nonempty and transitive then A is a standard transitive 
model of the Axiom of Unions iff 
('V XE A)[u(x) E A]. 
PROOF. Ax. 3 ~ 
('V x)(3 y)[y = u(x)]. 
Since A is nonempty and transitive we have 
STM(A, Ax. 3) 
if and only if 
('V x E A)(3 y E A)[y = U(X)]A. 
Since b = u(a) is absolute w.r.t. A, this holds if and only if 
('V x E A)(3 y E A)[y = u(x)]. 
But this is true if and only if 
('V x E A)[u(x) E A]. 
D 
Remark. Axiom 1 is absolute w.r.t. any transitive class. As a consequence 
every transitive class is a model of this axiom. Furthermore we note that if 
b E A then the extent of b as an individual in the universe A is b n A, that is, 
the collection of objects in A that play the role of elements of b is precisely 
the collection of objects in A that are elements of b. If A is transitive then 
b E A implies b ~ A and so b n A = b, that is, b as an individual in the 
universe A has the same extent it has as an individual in V. Consequently if 
A is transitive and a and b are in A then {a, b} n A = {a, b} and u(a) n A = 
u(a). Therefore in order for A to be a model of the Axiom of Pairing and the 

13 Absoluteness 
Axiom of Unions we must have 
{a, b} E A 
for a, b E A, 
u(a) E A 
for a E A. 
137 
The Power Set Axiom however presents a different situation. If A is 
transitive but not super transitive then a E A does not imply that all subsets 
of a are in A thus 
&>(a) n A ~ &>(a) 
and equality need not hold. That is, even if A is to be a transitive model of 
the Power Set Axiom, the object in A that plays the role of the power set of a 
need not be &>(a). 
Proposition 13.32. If A is nonempty and transitive then A is a standard transitive 
model of the Axiom of Powers iff 
(V x E A)[&>(x) n A E A]. 
PROOF. Ax. 4 ~ (V x)(3 y)(V z)[z E Y ~ 
Z ~ x]. Since A is nonempty and 
transitive we have 
STM(A, Ax. 4) 
if and only if 
(V X E A)(3 Y E A)(V Z E A)[z E Y ~ 
Z ~ xJ A • 
But since bEe ~ b ~ a is absolute w.r.t. A, this holds if and only if 
(V x E A)(3 Y E A)(V Z E A)[z E Y ~ 
Z ~ x]. 
Since A is transitive it follows that if YEA then 
(V Z E A)[z E Y ~ 
Z ~ xJ 
holds if and only if 
(V z)[z E Y ~ 
Z ~ X 1\ Z E AJ 
i.e., if and only if 
(V z)[z E Y ~ 
Z E &>(x) n AJ. 
Thus A is a transitive model of Axiom 4 if and only if 
(V x E A)(3 Y E A)(V z)[z E y ~ 
Z E &>(x) n AJ 
that is, if and only if 
(V X E A)[&>(x) n A E AJ.

Remark. Axiom 5 is of course not an axiom but an axiom schema. For 
each wff <p(u, v) we have an instance of Axiom 5 that we will denote by 
Axiom 5'1'.

(V x, y, z E A) [<pA(X, y) /\ <pA(X, z) -+ Y = zJ

PROOF. If A is a transitive model of Axiom 5", then A is a nonempty transitive 
class that satisfies all ofthe nonlogical axioms required to prove the instance 
of Zermelo's Schema of Separation: 
(V x)(3 y)[y = {z E xl <p(z)}].

from Axiom 6. 
(V X E A)[ x =I- 0 -+ (3 y) [y E X /\ Y n x = OJ]. 
But since A is transitive y E X /\ X E A -+ YEA. Therefore 
(V x E A)[x =I- 0 -+ (3 y E A)[y E X /\ Y n x = OJ]. 
Furthermore y E X /\ Y n x = 0 is absolute with respect to A. Therefore if 
a E A then

Proposition 13.36. A#-O A Tr(A) --+ 0 E A. 
PROOF. By the Axiom of Regularity

PROOF (By induction). From Proposition 13.36, 0 E A. If k E A, then since A 
is a model of Ax. 2, {k} E A and hence {k, {k}} E A. Since A is also a model of 
Ax. 3 u {k, {k}} E A, that is k + 1 E A.

Proposition 13.38. If A is a standard transitive model of the Axiom of Pairing

I nfinity iff W E A. 
PROOF. Since A is nonempty and transitive A is a standard transitive model 
of the Axiom of Infinity iff 
(3 x E A)[x = W]A. 
But Propositions 13.37 and 13.21 establish that x = W is absolute w.r.t. A. 
Therefore A is a standard transitive model of the Axiom of Infinity iff 
(3 x E A)[x = w] 
i.e., iff 
WEA.

Remark. We next prove the relative consistency of the Axiom of Regularity 
and the other axioms of ZF. In addition to being of interest in itself the 
proof gives an excellent illustration of Godel's method of proving the relative 
consistency of ZF with AC and OCH. Our procedure is to prove without 
using the Axiom of Regularity that the class of well-founded sets is a model 
of ZF (see Definition 9.11). The proofrequires a modification of our theory 
of ordinals in which we reverse the role of Definition 7.3 and Proposition 7.4. 
We redefine ordinal classes thus: 
Ord(A) A Tr(A) A EWe A. 
From this definition it is obvious that 
Ord(A) --+ Tr(A) A (\I x, YEA) [x E y V X = Y v Y E xl 

140 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
The properties of the ordinals as redefined, can now be deduced without 
the Axiom of Regularity. We leave it to the reader to verify that the back-
ground results, used in the proof to follow, do not depend upon the Axiom of 
Regularity. 
Proposition 13.39. If M = {x I Wf(x)} then M is a standard transitive model 
ofZF. 
PROOF. Since 0 E R'll we have 0 E M, i.e., M =1= o. If x E M then (3 IX) [x E R~ IX]. 
Since R~ IX is transitive x E R'l IX ~ X ~ R'l IX and hence x ~ M. Thus M is 
transitive. Since M is nonempty and transitive M is a model of Axiom l. 
Recall that a set is well founded if each of its elements is well founded. 
Consequently if a E M AbE M then {a, b} EM. Thus M is a model of 
Axiom 2. 
If a E M then bE u(a) ~ (3 x)[b EX 1\ X E a]. Since M is transitive it 
follows that u(a) ~ M, hence u(a) E M. Thus M is a model of Axiom 3. 
If a E M A b ~ a then since M is transitive b ~ M and hence b E M. 
Thus .9I(a) ~ M and hence .9I(a) E M. Thus M is a model of Axiom 4. 
If(\f x E M)(\f Y E M)(\f Z E M)[<pM(X, y) 1\ <pM(X, z) ---+ Y = zJ and if a E M 
then 
{y E MI(3 x E a)<pM(x, y)} ~ M 
and hence {y E M I (3 x E a)<pM(x, y)} EM. Thus M is a model of Axiom 5. 
If a E M, then since M is transitive a ~ M. Thus each element of a has 
a rank. If a =1= 0 then a contains an element of smallest rank, i.e., 
a =1= 0 ~ (3 x E a)(\f y E a)[rank x ;£ rank yJ 
~ (3 x E a)(x n a = 0). 
Again since M is transitive b E a ~ b E M, i.e., 
(\f x E M) [x =1= 0 ~ (3 y E M) [y E X A Y n x = OJ]. 
Thus, since [b E a A b n a = OJ Abs M, M is a standard transitive model of 
Axiom 6. 
Since M is a standard transitive model of Axioms 2 and 3 it follows that 
w ~ M (Proposition 13.37). From Proposition 9.12 it then follows that 
W E M. Thus M is a model of Axiom 7. 
* Theorem 13.40. If ~" is inaccessible then R'l~" is a standard transitive 
modelofZF. 
PROOF. Since R'l~" is nonempty and transitive it is a model of Axioms 1 and 
6. If a E R~~" 1\ b E R'l~" then 
rank({a, b}) = max (rank(a), rank(b)) + 1 < ~". 
Hence {a, b} E R~~" and Ri~" is a model of Axiom 2.

If a E R;~a then 
rank (u(a)) = J1 y ((V X E u(a)) [rank(x) < y]) ~ rank(a). 
Therefore u(a) E R;~a and R;~a is a model of Axiom 3. 
If a E R;~a then &(a) ~ R;~a and hence &(a) n R;~a = &(a). Further-
more since b ~ a implies rank(b) ~ rank(a) and since a E &(a) 
rank (&(a)) = rank(a} + 1 < ~a. 
Thus &(a) E R;~a and hence R;~a is a model of Axiom 4. 
From the AC it follows by induction that 
(V 13 < ~a) [R;f3 < ~aJ. 
Indeed R;O = 0 < oc. If R;f3 < ~a for 13 < ~a then since ~a is inaccessible 
R; (13 + 1) = &(R;f3) < ~a· 
If 13 E Kn and if y < 13 -+ R~y < ~a, then by Theorem 10.47 
R;f3 = U R;y ~ ~a X 13 = ~a· 
y<P 
If R;f3 = ~a and if f'y £ R; y then f: 13 -+ ~a, f is monotone increasing 
and u(f"f3) = ~a· Hence ~a is cofinal with 13. This is a contradiction from 
which we conclude that 
R'lf3 < ~a· 
If for some a E R'l ~a and some wff (fJ we have 
(V x E R;~a)(V y E R;~a)(V z E R;~a)[(fJRiN,,(x, y) /\ (fJRiN,,(x, z) -+ y = z] 
and 
{y E R;~al(3 x E a)(fJRjN,,(x, y)} ~ R;~a 
then since (3 13 < ~a)[a ~ R;f3]. a ~ R;f3 < ~a' i.e., (3 y < ~a) [y ~ aJ. Since 
rank ({y E R;~al(3 x E a)(fJRjN,,(x, y)}) = ~a 
it then follows that ~a is cofinal with some ordinal smaller than or equal 
to y. This is a contradiction and hence R; ~a is a model of Axiom 5. 
Since OJ E R;~a' R;~a is a model of Axiom 7.

Remark. There are several interesting conclusions to be drawn from the 
foregoing exercises and Proposition 13.40. First we have that if ~a is in-
accessible then R'l~a is a standard transitive model ofZF. The proof requires 
AC. From this and Exercise 15 it follows that it is consistent with ZF to 
assume that there are no inaccessible cardinals. We argue in the following 
way. Suppose the statement "there exists an inaccessible cardinal" were 
provable in ZF. Let ~a be the smallest such cardinal. Then R'l ~a is a standard 
transitive model of ZF. But from Exercise 15 above, if there were an in-
accessible cardinal in Ri ~a that cardinal would be inaccessible in V and 
smaller than the smallest inaccessible cardinal. This is a contradiction. 
Therefore it is not possible to prove in ZF that inaccessible cardinals exist. 
It may, however, be possible to prove in ZF that there does not exist an 
inaccessible cardinal. No proof was known at the time of this writing. 
From Exercises 1-7, Riw is a standard transitive model of Axioms 1-6 
but not of Axiom 7. Thus Axiom 7 is independent of Axioms 1-6. Also 
Ri(w2) is a standard transitive model of all axioms except Axiom 5. 

CHAPTER 14 
The Fundamental Operations 
Godel proved the relative consistency of AC and GCH by showing that a 
certain class L is a model of ZF + AC + GCH. This class L he defined 
initially as the union of a sequence of sets Aa , (X E On which were so defined 
that a E Aa + 1 iff there exists a wff cp( ao, a 1, ... , an) having no free variables 
other than ao, a1, ••• , an and there exist a1, ••• , an E Aa such that a = 
{YIAa F cp(Y, a1, .. ·, an)}· 
The foregoing condition describes a sense in which Aa+ 1 is the collection 
of sets that are definable from Aa. However, to properly define "definable" 
we must avoid quantification on wffs.1 
Later Godel discovered that his class, L, of constructible sets, could be 
defined as the range of a certain function F defined on On by transfinite 
recursion from eight basic operations. In Chapter 15, we will follow GOdel's 
second development. In anticipation of that development, we now establish 
certain conditions involving Godel's eight fundamental operations to be 
defined below that are sufficient for a class M to be a standard transitive 
modelofZF. 
Definition 14.1. 
(1) Cnv2(A) &: {(x, y, z)l(z, x, y) E A}. 
(2) Cnv3(A) &: {(x, y, z)l(x, z, y) E A}. 
Remark. Cnv2(A) and Cnv3(A) are read "the second converse of A" and 
"the third converse of A" respectively.

Proposition 14.3. If M is a standard transitive model ofZF then M is closed 
under the eight fundamental operations. 
PROOF. From Proposition 13.25 
a E M 1\ bE M 1\ STM(M, Ax. 2) -+ ff1(a, b) E M. 
Since M is a model of Axiom 2, c = (a, b) and d = (a, b, c) are each 
absolute with respect to M. Since M is also a model of Axiom 5 it follows 
from Proposition 13.34 and properties of absoluteness that for a, b E M 
ff2(a,b) = {xEal(3y,z)[x = (y,z) 1\ YEZ]} 
= {xEal(3y,zEM)[x = (y,z) 1\ YEZ]M} EM. 
ff3(a,b) = {xEalx~b} = {xEal[x~b]M}EM. 
ffia,b) = {xEal(3y,z)[x = (y,z) 1\ YEb]} 
= {xEal(3y,zEM)[x = (y,z) 1\ YEb]M} EM. 
ffs(a,b) = {xEal(3Y)[(X,Y)Eb]} = {xEal(3YEM)[(x,Y)Eb]M}EM. 
ff6(a,b) = {xEal(3y,z)[x = (y,z) 1\ (Z,y) Eb]} 
= {xEal(3y,zEM)[x = (y,z) 1\ (z,Y)Eb]}EM. 
ff7(a, b) = {x E al(3 y, z, w)[x = (y, z, w) 1\ (w, y, z) E b]} 
= {x E al(3 y, z, W E M)[x = (y, z, w) 1\ (w, y, z) E b]M} EM. 
ffs(a, b) = {x E al(3 y, z, w)[x = (y, z, w) 1\ (y, w, z) E b]} 
= {xEal(3y,z,WEM)[x = (y,z,w) 1\ (y,w,z)Eb]M}EM. D 
Remark. An examination of the foregoing proof reveals that the full 
strength of the hypothesis that M is a standard transitive model of ZF was 
not used. All that is required is that M be a standard transitive model of 
Axiom 2 and of seven instances of Axiom 5. In view of this it is not reasonable 

14 The Fundamental Operations 
145 
to expect the condition that M be closed under the eight fundamental 
operations to be also sufficient for a non empty transitive class M to be a 
standard transitive model of ZF. Surprisingly in addition to closure under 
the eight fundamental operations we need only the added condition that every 
subset of M have an extension in M. 
Definition 14.4. M is almost universal iff 
(V x)[x ~ M --+ (3 Y E M)[x ~ y]]. 
Remark. Note that if M is almost universal then M is not empty. 
To prove that if M is transitive, almost universal, and closed under the 
eight fundamental operations then M is a standard transitive model of ZF 
we need a few preliminary results. 
Proposition 14.5. If M is transitive, almost universal, and closed under the 
eight fundamental operations and a, b E M, then 
(1) 
{a, b} EM, 
(3) 
a x bE M, 
(5) an bE M, 
(2) 
<a, b) EM, 
(4) 
a - bE M, 
(6) au bE M. 
PROOF. 
(1) 
{a, b} = ffl(a, b) E M. 
(2) 
<a, b) = {{a}, {a,b}} EM. 
(3) 
Since M is transitive a ~ M and b ~ M. Therefore a x b ~ M and 
b x a ~ M. But M is also almost universal. Therefore 
(3 x, y E M)[a x b ~ X A b x a ~ y]. 
Then 
a x b = [x n (a x V)] n [y n (b x V)] - I 
= ff 6(ff ix, a), ff iy, b» E M. 
(4) 
a -
b = ff 3(a, b) E M. 
(5) 
a n b = a - (a -
b) E M. 
(6) 
Since M is transitive a u b ~ M. Also M is almost universal. 
Therefore 
(3 X E M)[a u b ~ x]. 
Then au b = x -

Since M is transitive (b, c) E a and a EM imply b, c E M. This in 
turn implies that (c, b) E M. Therefore, a- l ~ M. But since M is almost 
universal (3 x E M) [a- l ~ x] and hence 
a- l = xn a- l = :#'6(X, a) E M. 
(3) If bE .@(a) then (3 y)[ (b, y) E al Again from transitivity it follows 
that .@(a) ~ M and hence (3 x E M)[.@(a) ~ xl Therefore 
.@(a) = x n .@(a) = :#' s(x, a) E M. 
(4) 
1f/(a) = .@(a- l ) E M. 
(5) 
Since M is transitive Cnvz(a) ~ M. Therefore 
(3 x E M)[Cnv2(a) ~ xl 
Then 
Cnvz(a) = x n Cnv2(a) = :#' 7(X, a) E M. 
(6) The proof is left to the reader.

{(Xl' X2, x3)I(Xl, X2, X3) E a} = Cnv3(Cnvia)) EM. 
{(Xl' X2, x3)I(X2, Xl' X3) E a} = Cnv3(Cnvz(a)) EM.

Theorem 14.11. If M is transitive, almost universal, and closed under the 
eight fundamental operations then M is a standard transitive model of ZF and 
On~M. 
PROOF. Since M is almost universal M "# O. Therefore, M is a standard 
transitive model of the Axiom of Extentionality (Axiom 1) and the Axiom 

14 The Fundamental Operations 
149 
of Regularity (Axiom 6). By Proposition 14.5 (V x, Y E M)[ {x, y} E MJ. 
Therefore M is a model of the Axiom of Pairing (Axiom 2). 
Since M is transitive a E M implies that u(a) ~ M. Hence 
(3YEM)[u(a) ~y]. 
Since by Proposition 14.5, b x a E M and since M is closed under the eight 
fundamental operations 
(b x a) n E = ff 2(b x a, a) E M. 
Then from Proposition 14.7 
u(a) = ~ «b x a) n E) EM. 
Thus M is a model of the Axiom of Unions (Axiom 3). 
Since a E M implies &'(a) n M -c MJ, (3 Y E M) [&'(a) n M ~ y]. Then by 
Proposition 14.10 
&'(a) n M = {xix E y " [x ~ a]M} EM. 
Therefore M is a model of the Axiom of Powers (Axiom 4). 
If (V x, y, Z E M) [cpM(X, y) " cpM(X, z) --+ Y = z] 
and if a E M, then 
F ~ {(x, y) E M21x E a" cpM(X, y)} 
is a function. Since ~(F) ~ a both ~(F) " 1II(F) are sets. Therefore since 
F"a ~ M, (3 z E M) [F"a ~ z). Then 
{YEMI(3xEa)cpM(x,y)} = 1II({(x,Y)EM2IxEa" cpM(X,y)}) 
= 111 ({ (x, y) Ix E a " y E Z " cpM(X, y)}) EM. 
Thus M is a model of the Axiom Schema of Replacement (Axiom 5). 
Since M is a standard transitive model of the Axiom of Pairing and the 
Axiom of Unions it follows from Proposition 13.37 that w ~ M. Since M is 
almost universal there exists an a E M such that 
w ~ a. 
Since [x E w] Abs M and M is a model of the Axiom Schema of Replacement 
it follows from Proposition 13.34 that 
W= {xEalxEw} = {xEal[xEw]M}EM. 
Therefore M is a model of the Axiom of Infinity (Axiom 7). 
Thus M is a standard transitive model of ZF. That On ~ M we prove by 
induction. 
If CI. ~ M then since M is almost universal there is an a E M such that 
CI. ~ a. 
Then 
{xEaIOrd(x)} = {X Eal[Ord(x)]M} EM. 

150 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
Therefore 
u{x E aIOrd(x)} EM. 
But the union of a collection of ordinals is an ordinal, i.e., 
(3 fJ E M)(\I l' E a)[1' ~ fJ]. 
Then (\I l' E a)[1' E fJ + 1]. Since oc ~ a it follows that oc ~ fJ + 1. Since 
fJ EMit follows that fJ + 1 = fJ u {fJ} E M. Hence oc E M.

Remark. With the proof of Proposition 14.11 we have achieved our major 
objective for this section. There is however an interesting theory of classes 
in which certain results of this section are generalized. We state the main 
results of this theory leaving the proofs as exercises.

Proposition 14.13. If M is almost universal, and if a is M-constructible then 
aEM. 
Remark. Proposition 14.13 tells us that if M is almost universal then 
every M-constructible set is an element in M. As an application of this 
proposition it can be proved that if in addition M is closed under the eight 
fundamental operations then a E M implies that u(a) is M-constructible. It 
then follows that u(a) E M and hence M satisfies the Axiom of Unions. 
Proposition 14.14. If M is transitive then M is M-constructible.

CHAPTER 15 
The G6del Model 
In Chapter 7 we defined a relation Ro on On2. We proved that Ro well 
orders On2 and, with respect to Ro, initial segments of On2 are sets. Conse-
quently there is an order isomorphism J 0 such that 
Jo IsomRo.iOn2, On). 
This isomorphism we illustrate with the following diagram:

Here the element in the ath row and 13th column is J'o(a, 13). From the 
diagram it is apparent that the entry in the ath row and 13th column, i.e., 
J'o(a, 13) is at least as large as the maximum of a and 13. It is also easily prove~ 
that the cardinality of J'o<a, 13) does not exceed the maximum of a and P 
for a or 13 infinite.

Proposition 15.1. 
(1) 
maX(IX, /3) ~ J'o<IX, /3). 
(2) 
IX < ~y /\ /3 < ~y --* J'o<IX, /3) < ~Y· 
PROOF. (1) If (V IX)[F'IX £ J0<0, IX)] then F is a strictly monotonic ordinal 
function and hence IX ~ FIX. In particular if y = max(lX, /3) then 
max(lX, /3) = y ~ Fy = J'o<O, y). 
But 
<0, y)Ro<lX, /3) v <0, y) = <IX, /3). 
Therefore 
J'o<O,y) ~ J'o<IX,/3) 
i.e., 
max (IX, /3) ~ J'o<IX, /3). 
(2) If J'o<IX, /3) < ~o then J'o<IX, /3) < ~Y. If J'o<IX, /3) ~ ~o then since 
order isomorphisms map initial segments onto initial segments 
But 
<y, b) E (R01)"{<IX, /3)} --* <y, b)Ro<lX, /3) 
--* max(y, (j) ~ max(lX, /3) 
--* [y < max(lX, /3) + 1] /\ [b < max(lX, /3) + 1] 
--* <y, b) E [max(lX, /3) + 1] x [max(lX, /3) + 1]. 
Thus 
(R01)"{<IX,/3)} ~ [max(IX,/3) + 1] x [max(IX,/3) + 1]. 
Consequently J'o<IX, /3) is equivalent to a subset of 
[max(lX, /3) + 1] x [max(lX, /3) + 1]. 
From this we see that if max(lX, /3) were finite then J'o<IX, /3) would also be 
finite. Since J'o<IX, /3) ~ ~o it then follows that max(lX, /3) ~ w. Therefore by 
Proposition 10.41 
J'o<IX, /3) ~ [max(lX, /3) + 1] x [max(lX, /3) + 1] = max(lX, /3) + 1 < ~Y· 
Hence 
J'o<IX, /3) < ~Y"

Remark. From the relation Ro we can define a relation S on On2 x 9 that 
will be used to define the Godel model. This relation S well orders On2 x 9 

15 The G6del Model 
155 
and is well founded on On 2 x 9. Consequently the ordering is order iso-
morphic to On. Indeed for our purposes this order isomorphism is of greater 
interest than S. We therefore choose to define it directly from Jo. 
Definition 15.2. J'(a, 13, m) ~ 9· J~<a, 13) + m, m < 9. 
Proposition 15.3. J: On 2 x 9 ~~t~) On. 
PROOF. Clearly a, 13 and m uniquely determine 9· J~<a, 13) + m. Therefore J 
is a function on On2 x 9. If 
J'<a, 13, m) = J'(y, 6, 11) 
then 
9 ·J~<a, 13) + m = 9 .J~<y, 6) + 11. 
From the uniqueness property in the division theorem for ordinals 
(Proposition 8.27) it then follows that 
J~<a, 13) = J~<y, 6) 1\ m = 11. 
But J 0 is one-to-one. Hence a = y 1\ 13 = 6. Therefore 
<a, 13, m) = <y, 6,11) 
and hence J is one-to-one. 
Again from Proposition 8.27 
(\I y)(3 6)(3 m < 9)[y = 9· 6 + m]. 
Since 6 E On and J 0 is onto 
(3 a)(3 13)[6 = J~<a, 13)], 
Hence J'(a, 13, m) = 9 . J~<a, 13) + m = y, i.e., J is onto. 
Definition 15.4.

K3 g {(y, n)ln < 9 t\ (30:)(3 f3)[y = J'(o:, p, n)J}. 
Remark. J maps Onz x 9 one-to-one onto On. Therefore for each y in 
On there is one and only one ordered triple (0:, p, m) in Onz x 9 such that 
y = J'(o:, p, m) that is y determines an 0:, p, and m such that y = J'(o:, p, m). 
The functions K l' K z' and K 3 are so defined that K'l y, K~ y, and K~ yare 
respectively the first, second, and third components of the ordered triple in 
Onz x 9 corresponding to y under J. 
Proposition 15.8. y = J'(K'lY' K~y, K~y). 
Corollary 15.9. If m < 9 then 
(1) 
K;J'(o:, p, m) = 0:,

(l)

(2) 
K~y -# 0 ---+ K'lY < Y t\ K~y < y. 
PROOF. Since y = J'(K;y, K~ y, K~ y) = 9· J~(K;y, K~ y) + K~ y, it follows 
from properties of ordinal arithmetic (Corollary 8.5 and Proposition 8.21) 
But by Proposition 15.1 
max(K'lY, K~y) ~ J~(K'lY' K~y). 
Thus 
K; y ~ y and 
K~ y ~ y. 
If in addition K~ y -# 0 then 
J~(K'lY' K~y) < Y 
and hence 
K'lY < y and 
K~y < y. 
D 
Proposition 15.11. m < 9 /\ 0: < ~y t\ P < ~y ---+ J'(o:, p, m) < ~Y' 

15 The Giidel Model 
PROOF. By Proposition 15.1 we have 
J~<a, 13) < ~Y· 
If J~<a, 13) < ~o then 
J'<a, 13, m) = 9 . J~<a, 13) + m < ~o ~ ~Y· 
If J~<a, 13) ~ ~o then since 
9 . J~<a, 13) ~ 9 x J~<a, 13) 
we have that 
9 . J~<a, 13) = J~<a, 13) < ~y 
and hence 
J'<a, 13, m) = 9· J~<a, 13) + m < ~Y· 
Proposition 15.12. J'<O, ~Y' 0) = ~Y· 
157 
o 
PROOF. If it were the case that K'l ~y < ~y and K~ ~y < ~y then by Proposi-
tion 15.8 it would follow that 
~y = J'<K;~y, K~~y, K~~) < ~y. 
From this contradiction and Proposition 15.1 we conclude that 
Furthermore it follows that 
and hence 
Therefore 
I.e., 
Thus 
J'(O, ~y, 0) = ~Y"

Remark. We are now ready to define the G6del model L. This is a standard 
transitive model that we define as the range of a special function F that is in 
turn defined by transfinite recursion in the following way.

F'a = F"a 
if K~a = 0, 
F'a = ff~(F'K~a, F'K~a) if K~a = n =I- 0.

if K3a = 0, 
F'a = G'(F ia) = ffn«F la),K'la, (F la)'K~a) if K~a = n =I- 0. 
But by Proposition 15.l0 
K~ a =I-°

Thus 
(F ~ a)'K~a = F'K'la and (F r a)'K~a = F'K~a.

Definition 15.15. L ~ F"On. 
A set a is constructible iff a E L. 
o 

15 The G6del Model 
159 
Remark. We will prove that L is a model of ZF by proving that L is 
transitive; almost universal and closed under the eight fundamental opera-
tions. Those classes that are L-constructible in the sense of Definition 14.12 
we will refer to simply as constructible classes. The elements of L we will call 
constructible sets. Indeed if a = F'a we refer to a as the set constructed at 
the ath stage. From the foregoing example we see that 0 is the set constructed 
at the Oth, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th stages. Also 1 is constructed 
at the first stage and 2 is constructed at the 9th stage. Thus the constructible 
sets are those sets that can be "built" up from the empty set by a finite or 
transfinite number of applications of the eight fundamental operations. 
Closely related to the notion of constructibility is the notion of relative 
constructibility. There are many ways to generalize the notion of con-
structibility. One approach is to introduce an arbitrary set a of natural 
numbers at the (w + 1)th stage. Since we wish to construct models of ZF 
and every such model must contain wand all of its elements we modify the 
first (w + 1) stages to introduce wand its elements in a most direct and 
obvious way. A set is then constructible relative to a iff it can be built up 
from wand its elements and from a by a finite or transfinite number of 
applications of the eight fundamental operations. 
Although relative constructibility will not be needed until later we 
introduce it here because the definition and theorems of interest so closely 
parallel those for constructibility.

then 
IX = J'<fJ, y, n). 
If n = 0 then F'IX = F"IX and hence F'IX ~ F"IX. If n -# 0 then by Proposition

F'fJ E F"IX 1\ F'y E F"IX. 
If n = 1 then

Remark. We have now shown that L is a model of ZF and for each a ~ w, 
La is a model of ZF; but are these models different? It is not difficult to show 
that if a is constructible then La = L. Do there exist nonconstructible sets? 
From Cohen's work we know that this question is undecidable in ZF. 
The assumption that every set is constructible is called the Axiom of 
Constructibility. 
Axiom of Constructibility 
V=L. 
Godel's program for proving the consistency of GCH and AC consists 
of proving that the Axiom ofConstructibility implies GCH and AC. It is then 
sufficient to establish the consistency of the Axiom of Constructibility with 

15 The G6del Model 
163 
ZF. This is done by proving that L is a model of V = L. To prove this we 
must prove in ZF that 
[V = LY 
that is, since L = {xl(3 a)[x = F'a]} we must prove that 
L = {x ELI (3 a E L)[x = F'a]L}. 
Since On ~ L it is sufficient to prove that x = F'a is absolute with respect 
to L. This we will do by proving that x = F'a is absolute with respect to 
every standard transitive model of ZF. We need the following lemmas in 
which M is a standard transitive model of ZF and G is as given in Definition 
15.13. 
Lemma 1. (a, p, m)S(y, (i, n) Abs M.

PROOF. Proposition 13.30. 
Lemma 3. 
(1) P = J'(y, 6, m) Abs M. 
(2) P = J~(y, (i) Abs M. 
PROOF. (1) From properties of order isomorphisms (Proposition 7.53) 
(3! f)(3 ! a)[f Isoms. E(/1 x /1 x 9, a)]. 
Therefore, from the definition of J 
p = J'(y, 6, m) +-+ (3 f)(3 a)[m < 9 1\ / Isoms.dmax(y, <5)

x maxey, b) x 9, a) ---> f'(y, 15, m) = Pl 
From Theorem 13.8 it then follows that 
P = J'(y, 6, m) Abs M.

PROOF. (1) From the definition of F and Corollary 7.42 
(3! f)[J ff'rt(a + 1) 1\ (V 13 ~ a)[f'f3 = G'(f 113)]]. 
Therefore

But since On ~ M and x = F'a Abs M 
(V a)(3 x E M)[x = FaJ.

Remark. From Proposition 15.29 we see that L is the smallest of all the 
standard transitive models that contain On. In particular if a ~ ill then 
L ~ La. Furthermore if a is constructible, i.e., if a E L then La ~ L, i.e., 
L = La.

Remark. In Proposition 15.32 we have a result that is in fact stronger 
than the strong form of AC. The strong form of AC asserts the existence 
of a universal choice function. In the proof of Proposition 15.32 we have 
exhibited such a function. 
We turn now to a proof that the Axiom ofConstructibility implies GCH: 1 
(V a)[2t{~ = ~d 1]. 
The key to the proof lies in proving two results. First, we prove that the 
cardinality of F"~a is ~a' From this we deduce GCH by proving that if 
V = L then every subset of F"~a is constructed before the ~d 
1 th stage. 
1 A simpler proof is presented in Chapter 17. The remainder of this chapter can be omitted 
without loss of continuity.

PROOF. (1) If F'a = ° then As'F'a = ° and Od'As'F'a = 0, i.e., Ca = ° ~ a. 
If F'rx =1= ° 
then As'F'a E F'a. Therefore 
Ca = Od'As'F'a < Od'F'a ~ a. 
(2) The proof is left to the reader. 
Proposition 15.37. 
(1) 
F"~a = ~a' 
(2) 
F~~a = ~a' 
PROOF. (1) Since F is a function it follows that 
Furthermore 
F'J,(o, {3, 0) = F"J'<O, {3, 0). 
D 
Therefore since y < /3 implies J'<O, y, 0) < J'<O, /3, 0) it follows that if 
y < /3 then 
F'J,(o, y, 0) E F'J,(O, /3, 0) 
that is 
y =1= /3 ~ F'J'<O, y, 0) =1= F'J'(O, {3, 0). 
Thus if 
H'/3 £. F'J'<O, /3, 0), 
/3 EOn 
then H: On l.=...!,.L. Since 
/3 < ~a ~ J,(O, /3, 0) < ~a 
it follows that 
Since H is one-to-one 
Therefore F"~a = ~a'

Remark. It now remains to be proved that if V = L then each subset of 
F"~a is constructed before the ~a+ 1 th stage. This we do in the following 
sequence of propositions. 
Proposition 15.39. (1) If V = L and (V x)(V y)(V f)[9 ~ x ~ On /\ C"x ~ 
X /\ K~'x ~ X /\ K~x ~ X /\ J"x3 ~ X /\ f IsomE,E(x, y) -> (V oc E x)(V fJ EX) 
[F'oc E F'fJ ~ F'f'oc E F'f'fiJ] then (V oc)[g>(F"~a) ~ F"~a+ 1]. 
(2) If V = La and (V x)(V y)(V f)[w + 2 ~ x ~ On /\ C~'x ~ X /\ K~'x ~ 
X /\ K~x ~ X /\ J"x3 ~ X /\ f IsomE,E(x, y) -> (V oc EX)(V fJ E x)[F~oc E F~fJ 
~ 
F~f'oc E F~f'fJJ] then (V oc)[g>(F~'~a) ~ F~'~a+ 1]. 
PROOF. (1) If x ~ F"~a then from the Axiom of Constructibility 
(3(»[x = F'J]. 
Since C, K I, K2 and J are each single valued and ~(% u {J} is infinite it follows 
from Proposition 11.32 that there exists a set b such that 
[C"b ~ b /\ K';b ~ b /\ K~b ~ b /\ J"b 3 ~ b /\ 
~a U {(5} ~ b ~ On /\ b = ~a]. 
Since V = L implies AC, (3 y)(3 f) IsomE.E(b, y). By hypothesis 
f IsomE,ib, y) -> (V oc E b)(V fJ E b)[F'oc E F'fJ ~ F'f'oc E F'f'fJ]. 
In particular, since ~a ~ band f is order preserving 
fJ < ~(% -> f'fJ = fJ· 
Thus, since (5 E b, if fJ < ~(% 
[F'fJ E F'(5 ~ F'fJ E F'f'b]. 
Conseq uen tl y 
F'b n F"~a = F'f'b n F"~(%. 
But since ~a = J'<O, ~a, 0), 

15 The G6del Model 
169 
Furthermore, since F'i5 = x ~ F"~a, 
F'6 n F"~a = F'6 = x. 
Then 
x = F'f'6 n F'~a 
= F'1'() - [F'1'i5 -
F'~a] 
= F'J'(f'<5, J'<f'6, ~a' 3), 3). 
But since () E b /\ b = ~a and since f is an order isomorphism, f'i5 < ~a + l' 
Therefore by Proposition 15.1 
J'<f'6, ~a' 3) < ~a+ 1 
and hence by a second application of Proposition 15.1 
J'(f'6, J'<f'6, ~a, 3), 3) < ~a+ l' 
Consequently 
X E F"~a+ l' 
(2) The proof is left to the reader.

Remark. In somewhat over simplified terms Proposition 15.39 states that 
if every set is constructible and if certain ordinal isomorphisms preserve the 
order of constructibility then each subset of F"~a is constructed before the 
~a+ 1 th stage. 
Since for any set of ordinals b 
(3! y)(3! f)[f IsomE,E(b, y)] 
it remains to be proved that for appropriately chosen sets b, namely those 
closed under C, K 1, K 2' K 3' and J,J does preserve the order of constructibiIity. 
Proposition 15.40. If 9 ~ b ~ On /\ K\'b ~ b /\ K~ b ~ b /\ J"b 3 ~ b /\ 
f IsomE,E(b, 1]) then 
(1) m < 9 /\ a E b /\ /3 E b -+ J'<f'a, f'/3, m) = 1'J'<a, /3, m) 
and 
(2) 
J"1]3 ~ 1]. 
PROOF. (1) Since J is order preserving 
J,(1'a,f'/3, m) < J,(1'y,1'i5, n) <----> <1'a,f'/3, m)S<1'y,f'(), n). 
Butfis also order preserving. Therefore 
<f'a,f'/3, m)S<1'y,f'(), n) <----> <a, /3, m)S<y, 15, n). 
If there exists an ordered triple <a, /3, m) such that 
J'<f'a,f'/3, m) # 1'J'<a, /3, m) 

170 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
then there is an S-minimal such element. We will show that the assumption 
that (ex. /3. m) is such an ordered triple leads to a contradiction. 
If J'(!,ex,f'/3. m) < !,J'(ex. /3. m) then since b is closed w.r.t. J and since 
ex. /3. and m are in b it follows that 
J'(ex. /3. m) E b 
and hence 
!,J'(ex. /3. m) E Y/. 
Since 
J'(!,ex,f'/3. m) < !,J'(ex. /3. m) 
it follows that 
(3 v E b)[!'v = J'(!,ex.!'/3. m)J. 
If 
y = K'! V 1\ 6 = K~ v 1\ n = K~ v 
then since v E band b is closed w.r.t. K!. K 2 • K3 
Y E b 1\ (j E b 1\ nEb. 
Therefore 
v = J'(y. b. n) E b 
and 
!,J'(y. (). n) = !,v = J'(!,ex,f'/3. m). 
Since by hypothesis 
J'(!,ex,f'/3. m) < !,J'(ex. /3. m) 
we have that 
!,J'(y. 6. n) < !,J'(ex. /3. m). 
From this it follows that 
(y. b. n)S(ex. /3. m). 
But from the defining property of (ex. /3. m) 
J'(!'y.!'(). n) = !,J'(y. 6. n) = J'(!,ex,f'/3. m). 
Since both J andfare one-to-one this implies that 
(y. 6. n) = (ex. /3. m) 
which is a contradiction. 

15 The Godel Model 
Iff'J'(rx, /3, m) < J'<f'rx,f'/3, m) and if 
y = K;f'J'<rx, /3, m) /\ 6 = K~f'J'<rx, /3, m) /\ n = K~f'J'<rx, /3, m) 
then 
f'J'<rx, /3, m) = J'(y, (), n) < J'<f'rx,f'/3, m) 
hence 
<y, 6, n)S<f'rx,f'/3, m). 
Therefore 
y ~ max(f'rx,f'/3) /\ 6 ~ max(f'rx,f'/3). 
Since rx, /3 E b, 
f'rx E Yf /\ f'fJ E Yf 
that is 
max(f'rx,f'fJ) < Yf. 
Then y, 6 E Yf, and consequently 
Since 
and hence 
(3 Yo, 150 E b)[y = f'Yo /\ 15 = f'60l 
<y, 6, n)S<f'rx,f'/3, m), 
<f'Yo,f'bo, n)S<f'rx,f'/3, m) 
<Yo, 60 , n)S<rx, /3, m). 
Again from the defining property of < 
rx, /3, m) 
f'J'<yo, 60 , n) = J'<f'yo, 1'60 , n) = J'<y, 6, n) = f'J'<rx, /3, m). 
Since f and J are one-to-one we conclude that 
<Yo, ()o, n) = <rx, /3, m) 
which is a contradiction. 
(2) If y, 6 E Yf then 
(3 Yo E b)(3 60 E b)[y = f'yo /\ 6 = f'60l 
Therefore from (1) 
J'<y, 6, m) = J'<f'yo, 1'60 , m) = f'J'<yo, 150 , m). 
Since b is closed w.r.t. J andfmaps b into Yf, 
J'<y, 6, m) E Yf 
i.e., Yf is closed w.r.t. J.

Since b is closed W.r.t. J

and hence 
f'J'<a, {3, m) E c. 
If 
y = K'J'J'<a, {3, m) 1\ <> = K~ f'J'(a, {3, m) 1\ n = K~ f'J'<a, {3, m) 
then since c is closed W.r.t. K I, and K2

and 
f'J'<a, {3, m) = J'<y, b, n).

f;J'<a, {3, m) = (f2° f)'J'<a, {3, m) = f~J'<y, b, n) = J'<f~ y,f~ (), n). 
On the other hand we also have from Proposition 15.40 that 
f;J'<a, {3, m) = J'<f;a, f;{3, m). 
Therefore since J is one-to-one 
1'1 a = f~ y 1\ f; {3 = f~ b 1\ m = n 
that is 
y = f'a 1\ <> = f'{3 1\ m = n. 
Therefore 
f'J'(a, {3, m) = J'<y, b, n) = J'<f'a, f'{3, m).

Since b is closed w.r.t. Kl and K2 we have that

fundamental operations. 
PROOF. If X, Y E F"b then 
(3 a, (3 E b)[x = F'a /\ y = F'{3] 
and hence 
:Fix, y) = :Fn(F'a, F'(3) = F'J'<a, (3, n). 
Since b is closed w.r.t. J it follows that

But 
Od'x = Od'As'{x} = Od'As'F'a = C'a.

If x E F"b and x :1= y then from Lemma 1, {x} E F"b and 
{y} = {x, y} -

Y E F"b --+ x E F"b. 
If <x, y) E Q6, then (3 z, w)[x = <z, w) 1\ y = <w, z)J.

{x, y} E F"(b n ,,) -+ x, y E F"(b n ,,). 
Therefore since H IsomE,E(F"(b n ,,), F"f"(b n ,,») and since x, y E {x, y} 
H'x, H'y E H'{x, y} 
i.e., 
{H'x, H'y} ~ H'{x, y}. 
Either H'{x, y} = {H'x, H'y} or 3 z E [H'{x, y} -
{H'x, H'y}]. In the 
latter caSe we note that" E b and hence 
f"(b n ,,) = c n 1'". 
Since H'{x, y}, H'x, H'y E F"c it follows from Lemma 1 that 
H'{x, y} -
{lI'x, H'y} E F"c. 
From Lemma 3 
3 z E (H'{x, y} -

Therefore 
H'{x, y} E F"(c n 1',,) /\ Z E H'{x, y} n F"c

Z E F"(c n f',,) = F"f"(b n ,,). 
Consequently (3 w E F"(b n ,,»)[z = H'w]. But since Z E H'{x, y} and 
H IsomE,E(F"(b n ,,), F"f"(b n ,,»), 
WE {x, y}. 
Thus z = H'x v z = H'y. This is a contradiction. Hence 
H'{x, y} = {H'x, H'y}. 
(2) From Lemma 8 
<x, y) E F"(b n,,) -+ x,y, {x}, {x, y} E F"(b n ,,). 

15 The Giidel Model 
Therefore from (1) above 
H'<x, y) = H' {{x}, {x, y}} = {H'{x}, H'{x, y}} 
= {{H'x}, {H'x, H'y}} = <H'x, H'y). 
(3) The proof is left to the reader. 
(4) If <x, y) E Q4, then (3 z)[y = <x, z)]. 
But from Lemma 8 
Y E F"(b n 17) -+ x, Z E F"(b n 1]), 
Then from (2) above 
y = (x, z) -+ H'y = <H'x, H'z) 
-+ <H'x, H'y) E Q4' 
Conversely 
<H'x, H'y) E Q4 -+ (3 w)[H'y = <H'x, w)]. 
177 
Since y E F"(b n 1]), H'y E F"(c n f'1]). Hence by Lemma 8, WE F"(c n f'1]) 
= F"f"(b n 1]). Consequently (3 z E F"(b n 1]») [w = H'z]. 
Since f- l IsomE,E(c, b) /\ H- l IsomE,E(F"(c n f'1]), F"f- l (c n f'1]») 
the foregoing argument gives 
H'y = <H'x, H'z) -+ Y = <x, z) 
-+ <x, y) E Q4' 
The arguments for Qs, Q6' Q7, and Qs are similar and are left to the

Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
If H = {(F'y, F'f'y) lYE b n I'/} then by the induction hypothesis 
(V 1',6 E b n I'/)[[F'y E F'6 +-+ F'f'y E F'f'6J 
!\ [F'y = F' 6 +-+ F'f'y = F'f'6J] 
consequently H IsomE,E(F"(b n 1'/), F"f"(b n 1'/)). With the aid of Lemma 9 
we will prove (i), i.e., 
(V l' E b n I'/)[F'y E F'I'/ +-+ F'f'y E F'f'I'/l 
We argue by cases. 
If K~ 1'/ = 0 then K~ 1'1'/ = 0 (Proposition 15.41). Therefore F'I'/ = F"I'/ and 
F'f'I'/ = F"f"1'/· Consequently 
(V l' E b n I'/)[F'y E F'I'/l 
But since f is E-order preserving 
l' E b n 1'/ -+ 1'1' E 1'1'/. 
Hence 
(V l' E b n I'/)[F'f'y E F'f'I'/J. 
If K~ 1'/ =f. 0 then K'll'/ < 1'/ !\ K~ 1'/ < 1'/. Since 1'/ E band b is closed with 
respect to K 1 and K 2, 
K; 1'/ E b n 1'/ !\ K~ 1'/ E b n 1'/. 
From Proposition 15.41 
K~ 1'1'/ = K~ 1'/. 
If K~I'/ = 1 
F'I'/ = {F'K;I'/, F'K~I'/} !\ F'f'I'/ = {F'f'K;I'/, F'f'K~I'/}. 
Then from the induction hypothesis if l' E b n 1'/ 
F'y E F'I'/ +-+ F'y = F' K'l 1'/ v F'y = F' K~ 1'/ 
+-+F'f'y = F'f'K;I'/ v F'f'y = F'f'K~I'/ 
+-+ F'f'y E F'f'I'/. 
If Kjl'/ = 2 
F'I'/ = E n F'K'll'/ !\ F'f'I'/ = E n F'f'K;I'/. 
Again from the induction hypothesis if l' E b n 1'/ 
F'y E F'I'/ +-+ F'y E E !\ F'y E F' K'l 1'/ 
+-+(3x,y)[F'y = (x,y)!\ xEyJ!\ F'f'YEF'f'K;I'/. 
From Lemma 8 
(x, y) = F'y E F"(b n 1'/) -+ x E F"(b n 1'/) !\ Y E F"(b n 1'/). 

15 The G6del Model 
Then from Lemma 9 
F'I'Y = H'F'y = H'<x, y) = <H'x, H'y). 
Furthermore 
X E Y -+ H'x E H'y. 
Thus 
F'I'Y E E (1 F'I' K~ Yf 
I.e., 
(\:I y E b (1 Yf)[F'y E F'Yf -+ F'I'Y E F'I'YfJ. 
If K3Yf = 3 
F'Yf = F'K~Yf -
F'K~Yf A F'I'Yf = F'I'K~Yf -
F'I'K~Yf. 
From the induction hypothesis if y E b (1 Yf 
F'y E F'Yf +-+ F'y E F' K't Yf A F'y ¢ F' K~ Yf 
+-+ F'I'Y E F'I' K~ Yf A F'I'Y ¢ F'I' K~ Yf 
+-+ F'I'Y E F'I'Yf. 
IfK3Yf = n,n = 4,6,7,8 
Then ify E b (1 Yf

But from Lemma 5 
F'y E F"b A <x, F'y) E Qn -+ X E F"b. 
Then 
F'K~Yf E F"(b (1 Yf) A X E F'K~Yf (1 F"b. 
Therefore by Lemma 6, x E F"(b (1 Yf). Thus 
x E F"(b (1 Yf) A F'y E F"(b (1 Yf) A <x, F'y) E Qn. 
From Lemma 9 
<H'x, H'F'y) E Qn. 
But 
H'F'y = F'I'Y.

Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
Therefore since x E F'Ki Yf 
H'x E H'F'KiYf = F'j'KiYf 
i.e. 
F'f'y E Q~F'f'Ki Yf. 
Thus 
(V y E b n Yf)[F'y E F'Yf -+ F'f'y E F'f'Yf]' 
If K~Yf = 5 
F'Yf = F'K;Yf n Q~F'KiYf /\ F'f'Yf = F'f'K'lYf n Q~F'f'KiYf· 
Thus if y E b n Yf then since Qs = Qi 1 
F'y E F'Yf +-+ F'y E F' K; Yf /\ F'y E Q~ F' Ki Yf 
+-+ F'f'y E F'f' K; Yf /\ (3 x E F' Ki Yf)[ (F'y, x) E Q4]. 
Then 
F'KiYf n Q4{F'y} =F o. 
Furthermore since F'y E F"b /\ F'Ki Yf E F"b we have from Lemma 1 
F'KiYf n Q4{F'y} E F"b. 
Therefore by Lemma 3 
(3 y E F"b)[y E F'KiYf n Q4{F'y)]. 
Thus 
Y E F"b /\ (F'y, y) E Q4. 
Then 
F'Ki Yf E F"(b n Yf) /\ Y E F'Ki Yf n F"b 
and hence by Lemma 6 
Y E F"(b n Yf). 
Then since (F'y, y) E Q4 we have from Lemma 9 
(H'F'y, H'y) E Q4, 
(H'y, H'F'y) E Qs. 
But H'F'y = F'f'y. Therefore since y E F'Ki Yf 
H'y E H'F'KiYf = F'f'KiYf 
i.e., 

15 The G6del Model 
Thus 
('rJ y E b n ,,)[F'y E F'" -+ F'f'y E F'f',,]' 
Having exhausted all cases we have proved 
('rJ y E b n ,,)[F'y E F'" -+ F'f'y E F'f',,]' 
The implication in the reverse direction follows from symmetry, i.e., 
I-I IsomE,E(c, b) 1\ H- I IsomE,E(F"(c n 1',,), F"f-I(C n 1',,»). 
Therefore, since 
Y E b n " -+ f'y E C n 1'", 
F'f'y E F'f'" -+ F'y E F'". 
This completes the proof of (i). 
181 
From (i) we next prove (iii). If F'" "# F'y then F'" -
F'y "# 0 or F'y - F'" 
"# O. Since F'y E F"b 1\ F''1 E F"b we have from Lemma 1 
F'" - F'y E F"b 1\ F'y - F'" E F"b. 
If F'" - F'y "# 0 then by Lemma 3 
(3 x E F"b)[x E F'" - F'y]. 
Thus 
X E F'" n F"b 
and hence by Lemma 7 
X E F"(b n '1) 
i.e., 
(3 v E b n ,,)[x = F'v]. 
But x E F'" - F'y. Therefore 
F'v E F'" 1\ F'v ¢ F'y. 
From (i) 
F'f'v E F'f'" 1\ F'f'v ¢ F'f'y. 
Thus F'f'v E F'f'" - F'f'y and hence F'f'y "# F'f'". 
If F'y -
F''1 "# 0 the argument is similar to the foregoing one and is left 
to the reader. We have then proved 
('rJ y E b n ")[F'f',, = F'f'y -+ F'" = F'y]. 
Again the implication in the reverse direction follows from symmetry. 
We next prove (ii) from (i) and (iii). If F'" E F'y and if v = Od'F'" then 
v = Od'F'" < Od'F'y ~ y < " 

182 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
i.e., v < '1. Since F''1 E F"b we have from Lemma 2 
v = Od'F''1 E b. 
Then v E b n '1 and hence by the induction hypothesis 
F'v E F'y -+ F'f'v E F'f'y. 
But since F'v = F''1 we have from (iii) 
F'f'v = F'f''1. 
Hence 
F''1 E F'y -+ F'f''1 E F'f'y. 
Again the reverse implication follows from symmetry.

F'tx = F"tx = {xl(3fjEtx)[X = F'fj]} = {xEMI(3fjEtx)[X = F'fj]M} EM. 
If K~ tx = i =I ° then K'l tx < tx, K~ tx < tx and from the induction hypothesis

F'tx = g;;(F'K'ltx, F'K~tx) E M.

Theorem 15.49. If M is a standard transitive model ofZF then 
(1) 
L M is a standard transitive model ofZF + AC + GCH + V = Land 
OnLM = OnM • 
(2) 
L"f is a standard transitive model ofZF + AC + GCH + V = La and 
OnL~ = OnM, if a E M. 
PROOF. (1) Since 0 E M and F'O = 0 it follows that 0 E LM and hence LM is 
not empty. Furthermore if y E x E LM then 
(3 a E M)[y E X = F'a ~ F"a]. 
Therefore (3 {3 < a)[y = F'{3]. But a E M and M is transitive. Thus {3 E M 
and y ELM, and hence L M is transitive. 
Since L is a model of ZF + AC + GCH + V = L it follows that if cp is 
any axiom of ZF + AC + GCH + V = L then cpL is a theorem of ZF. 
Since M is a model of ZF every theorem of ZF relativized to M is a theorem 
of ZF. Therefore (cpL)M is a theorem of ZF. Then by Theorem 15.48 cpLM is a 
theorem of ZF. Hence L M is a model of cp. 
Consequently L M is a standard transitive model of ZF + AC + GCH + 
V=L. 
By Theorem 15.27, OnL = On. Relativizing to M we have OnLM = OnM .

CHAPTER 16 
Silver Machines 
Godel's use ofthe Axiom ofConstructibility to prove the relative consistency 
of ZFC, and ZFC + GCH, might suggest that he introduced constructi-
bility simply as a means to an end. That, however, is not at all the case. Godel 
held his discovery of constructible sets, and his proof that the class of con-
structible sets, L, is a model of ZFC, to be by itself, one of his major achieve-
ments. His confidence in the importance of the notion of constructibility was 
further vindicated when in 1967 Ronald Bjorn Jensen used V = L to solve a 
problem in real analysis, the Souslin problem. In addition Jensen derived, 
from V = L, three principles that can be understood and used by people who 
are not specialists in set theory. Following Jensen, Saharon Shelah in 1974, 
used V = L to settle a problem in group theory, the Whitehead problem. 1 
In view of these results it is natural to ask about the status of the Axiom 
of Constructibility, V = L. If one is of the opinion that the purpose of set 
theory is to axiomatize the largest possible part of Cantor's world of sets, then 
V = L must be rejected because it is severely restrictive. But rejecting V = L 
as an axiom does not diminish the importance of constructibility and the 
achievements of Jensen. Rather it directs our attention to L, which is the 
smallest natural universe of sets. To understand L is an important part of 
understanding set theory. With Jensen the first step was taken toward a better 
understanding of L. 
In the late 1970s, at a date unknown to the authors because he did not 
publish his results, Jack Silver introduced a special technique for deriving 
consequences of V = L and hence for deriving information about L. This 
technique involves the use of structures that Silver called machines and

Whitehead problem see Devlin, Keith J. The Axiom of Constructibility: A Guide for the Mathe-

Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
which are now known as Silver machines. In this chapter we will study an 
elementary part of the theory of Silver machines. 
A Silver machine is a special kind of structure that we call an algebra. But 
to define an algebra we need some preliminary notions and notation: 
Definition 16.1. A!:!~ {f 1(3 n E w)[f: n -+ A]}. 
Remark. IfJis an element of A!:! with domain n, and ifJ'i = ai we will denote 
Jby (a 1, a2' ... , an>. We will also use a as a variable on A!:!. 
Definition 16.2. A function J is a partial map from A to B iff (3 C ~ A) 
[f: C -+ B]. 
Definition 16.3. A structure (A, Fx>xEI is an algebra iff A and I are classes 
and for each x in I, Fx is a partial map from A!!! to A. The class A is the universe 
of the algebra. 
Definition 16.4. An algebra (A, F x>xEI is a subalgebra of the algebra 
(B, Gx>xEl iff 
A ~ B 1\ (\fxEl)['@(Fx) = A!!! n'@(Gx) 1\ (\f YE'@(Fx)[F~y = G~y]J. 
Proposition 16.5. Let {(Ab' F bx> xElI b E B} be a collection oj subalgebras oj 
an algebra m. Then 
(1) 
/ nAb, n FbX) 
\ bEB 
hEB 
XEI 
is a subalgebra oJm. 
The proof is obvious. 
Definition 16.6. The algebra (1) of Proposition 16.5 is the intersection algebra 
of the given collection of algebras. 
Definition 16.7. (1) A class X is contained in an algebra (A, F x>xEI iff X ~ A. 
(2) 
If X is contained in an algebra m, then the subalgebra ofm generated 
by X, is the intersection of all of the subalgebras of m that contain X. The 
universe of this algebra we denote by m(X). 
Remark. Following a custom established in group theory, and other places, 
we will speak of m(X) as the subalgebra generated by X. 
A mapping n from A to B induces a natural mapping from A!:! to B'E: 
Definition 16.8. If n: A -+ B, then n is the mapping from A'!! to B'!! induced by 
n and defined by 

16 Silver Machines 
187 
Remark. In dealing with partial functions on a class A it is convenient to 
introduce an extended equality relation that enables us to use quantification 
over all of A and without reference to the domains of the function involved. 
Definition 16.9. If F and G are partial functions on A, then V x E A 
F'x ~ G'x iff x E ~(F) n ~(G) 1\ F'x = G'x or x ¢ ~(F) 1\ x ¢ ~(G). 
Definition 16.10. By a monomorphism from an algebra <A, Fx>xEI to an 
algebra <B, Gx>xEI we mean a mapping n such that 
(1) 
n: A~B, 
and 
(2) (VxEI)[noFx = Gxon], 
that is, (\fa E AIY)(V x E I)[n'F~a ~ G~n'a]. 
Definition 16.11. An algebra <A, F;)iEW is a Silver machine, or simply a 
machine, iff 
(1) 
A = On or 
A EOn, 
and 
(2) 
F~<OCt, oc2> = 0 iff OCt, OC2 E A 1\ OCt < OC2, 
otherwise F 0 is undefined. 
Remark. As a notational convenience we will, throughout the remainder 
of this section, think ofa fixed machine ~ that we denote by <A, F;)iEW. We 
will also use the notation F(x) and F'x interchangeably. 
Definition 16.12. For each ordinal ( in A 
~~ g, «, Fl>iEw 
is the machine defined by 
Fl(rl) g, F;(rl) 
if rl E (IY 1\ F;(rl) < (, 
otherwise Fl is undefined. 
Definition 16.13. A function n: ( ~ 11 is a strong ~-map iff n is a mono-
morphism from ~~ to ~". Such a function is a medium ~-map iff there exists 
a b ~ 11 such that n is a strong ~-map from ( into b. 
Remark. (1) Obviously, a strong ~-map is medium, but the converse is not 
true. Find a counter-example. 
(2) If n: ~ ~ 11 is a medium ~-map, then n is order preserving, that is, 
(V OC, {3 < ~)[oc < (3 ~ n(oc) < n({3)].

Let n: ~ ~ 11 be a medium m:-map and let () = sup{n(o:) + 110: < o. 
Then n: ~ --> 6 is a strong m-map. 
Proposition 16.14. If n: ~ ~ 11 is a strong m:-map and 6 ~ 11 is an ordinal such

Theorem 16.19. If n: ~ -> IJ is a strong 'll-map and X ~~, then n"'ll~(X) = 
'll'/(n"X). 
PROOF. It is easy to see that n"'ll~(X) is a subalgebra of'llq that contains n"X, 
and thus 'llq(n"X) ~ n"'ll~(X). We shall show that Y = (n-1),,'llq(n"X) is a 
subalgebra of'll~ that contains X. From this we see that n"'ll~(X) ~ 'llq(n"X). 
Since n"X ~ 'llq(n"X), it is clear that X ~ Y. Let (X E y!Y and assume that 
Fr«(X) is defined. Then n«(X) E 'llq(n"X) and F7(n«(X») is defined. 'llq(n"X) is a 
subalgebra of'll\ and hence F7(n«(X»)E'llq(n"X). Since (n- 1),F7(n«(X») = 
Fl«(X), we have Fr«(X) E Y. Thus Y is a subalgebra of 'll~. 
D 
Remark. Note that if X is a set of ordinals then by Corollary 7.52 there is a 
unique ordinal ~ and a unique order isomorphism from ~ onto X. We call this 
order isomorphism the collapsing map of X, and we call ~ the order type of X. 
Definition 16.20. A machine'll = <A, F)iew has the collapsing property iff 
for every IJ E A and every sub algebra X of 'llq of order type ~, the collapsing 
map of X is a strong 'll-map from ~ into IJ. 
Remark. If'll has the collapsing property and X is a subalgebra of'llq with 
order type ~, then the collapsing map of X gives the isomorphism with 'll~ 
and X as algebras. 
Definition 16.21. 'll has the finiteness property iff for every IJ E A, there exists 
a finite set H q ~ IJ such that 
'llq+l(X U {IJ}) ~ 'llq(X U Hq) U {IJ} 
for all X ~ IJ. 
Lemma 16.22. Let K be an arbitrary limit ordinal and let IJ be the least ordinal 
greater than or equal to K such that for some IX < K and some finite P ~ IJ, the 
order type of'llq(1X U P) is not less than K.If'll has the finiteness property, then 
IJ is a limit ordinal. 
PROOF. Take IX < K and let P ~ IJ be a finite set so chosen that the order type 
of 'llq(IX U P) is greater than or equal to K. Assume IJ = v + 1 for some v. 
Since 'll has the finiteness property, there exists a finite set H v ~ v which 
satisfies 
'llq(IX U P) ~ 'llV(IX U (P n v) U Hv) U {v}. 
Since K is a limit ordinal, we see that the order type of'llV(1X U (P n v) U Hv) 
is greater than or equal to K. This contradicts the minimality of IJ. Thus IJ is a 
limit ordinal.

Definition 16.24. Let (I, ~) be a directed set. Then IT = <l1b 1T.ij)i~)S a direct

(I)

1T.jk 0 1T.ij = 1T.ik if i ~ j ~ k. 
If each 1T.ij: l1i --+ I1j is a strong ~- map (medium ~-map), then IT is a 
direct system of strong ~-maps (medium ~-maps). 
Remark. Let n = <11i> 1T.ij)i5j be a direct system of order preserving maps

Definition 16.25. Let n = <l1i, 1T.ij)i~j be a direct system of order preserving

On M we define an equivalence relation =:: 
<i, a) ~ (j, [3)

We define equivalence classes for each <i, a) E M 
[i, a] ~ {(j, [3) E M I <i, a) =: (j, [3)}. 
Then we define the class of equivalence classes 
MI=: g rei, a] I <i, a) EM}. 
On M I =: we define a linear ordering: 
[1, a] < U, [3] A (3 k E I)[i ~ k /\ j ~ k /\ 1T.ik(a) < 1T.jk([3)]. 
Finally we define 1T.ioo, the canonical order preserving map from l1i to M I=::

<an\n < w) such that io ~ il ~ ... ~ in ~ ... and 1tinin+,(an) > an+ 1• 
PROOF. If such sequences exist, then <1tin oo(an) \ n < w) is an infinite descend-
ing sequence in M / ==. Thus n is not well founded. Suppose n is not well

Proposition 16.33. 
(1) 
max(tX) ~ J(tX). 
(2) 
Cl<rx» ~ rx if Ci«rx» is defined. 
PROOF. (1) Since the function f(rx) = 1"rx'!! is increasing, it follows that 
rx ~ 1"rx'E for all rx. Thus if rxi = max(tX), then rxi ~ 1"rx'f ~ J(tX). 
(2) 
Let rx = J«rxo, ... , rxn - 1». Then by (1), max(rxo, ... , rxn - 1) ~ rx and 
so C;( <rx» = rxi ~ rx for each i < n.

Theorem 16.34. The pairing machine f!J> < has the collapsing property. 
PROOF. Let 1] be an ordinal, let X ~ 1] be a subalgebra of f!J>,!: and let n: ~ ~ X 
be the collapsing map of X. We want to show that n: ~ ~ 1] is a strong 
f!J> <-map. 
Let Z = {tX E On'E IJ(tX) E X}. Then, for any tX = <rxo, ... , rxn - 1), 
tX E Z ~ J(tX) E X ~ 1] 
~ rxi = q«J(tX») E X 
for all i < n 
Hence Z ~ X'E. 
Z is an initial segment of X'E: 
tX E Z /\ JJ E X'!! /\ JJ < tX ~ J(JJ) < J(tX) E X ~ 1] 
~ J(JJ) = Jq(JJ) E X 
~ JJ E Z. 
It is obvious, from the definition of Z, that Jq maps Z onto X. Since n induces 
an order isomorphism between ~'E and X'E, (n- 1)"Z is an initial segment of ~'E 
of order type ~. Therefore, 
n(J~(tX» ~ r(ii(tX» 
for all tX E ~'E. 
From this, we also see that 
n( Ci(tX» ~ q( ii(tX» 
for all tX E ~'E.

Theorem 16.35. f!J> < has the finiteness property.

f!J>'!:+ I(X U {1]}) ~ f!J>'!:(X u H q) U {1]}. 
Let Y = f!J>,!:(X U Hq) U {1]}. We want to show that Y is a subalgebra of

Theorem 16.36. f!!> < has the direct limit property. 
PROOF. Let n = <1]i' nij)i~j be a well-founded direct system of strong gl' < 
maps with an index set <I, ;£). First we shall show by induction on J(iiioo(a» 
that ifJ~i(a) ~ p, then J (iiioo(a» = nioo(f1). LeU) E 1]~ be such that 0 < iii 00 (a). 
Then there exist; ~ i and 0' E 1]7 such that ii;oo(O') = o. H we put oc' = iii/a), 
then we have iijoo(()') < iii 00 (a) = njoo(a'), and so J(iijoo(o'» < J(nioo(a». By 
the induction hypothesis, we see that J(o) = njoo(J(()'». Since njoo is order 
preserving and iijoo(o') < iij 00 (a'), we have 0' < a'. Noting that J(a') = 
rJ(iiij(a» = nij(J~i(a» = nij(p), we have: 
J(o) = njoo(J(()'» < njoo(J(a'» = njoo(n;;(f1» = nioo(p)· 
Then J (iiioo(a» ;£ nioo(p). Assume J( iii 00 (a» < nioo(p). Let j ~ i and a < 1]j 
be such that njoo(a) = J(iiioo(a». Ha' = iiij(a) and P' = ni/p), then njoo(a) < 
njoo(p') = njoo(J(a'» because J(a') = J~J(iiij(a» = 
nij(J~i(a» = ni/f1) = p'. 
Hence there exists ayE 1]7 such that y < a' and J(y) = a. Since y < a', we 
see that J(iijoo(Y» < J(iijoo(a'» = J(iiioo(a». By the induction hypothesis, 
J(iijoo(Y» = njoo(J(y» = njoo(a). Therefore J(iijoo(y) = J(iiioo(a». This is a 
contradiction, and we conclude that J(nioo(a» = nioo(f1). 
Next we shall show that if roo (iiiOO(a» is defined, then J~i(a) is also defined. 
From this we have 
nioo(J~i(a» ~ r'"'(nioo(a» 
for all a E rtf. 
Let f3 = J~oo(iiioo(a», then there existj ~ i and P' < 1]j such that njoo(p') = p. 
If a' = iiij(a), then 
If we show that J(a') ;£ /1', then J~J(a') = J~J(iiij(a» is defined, and hence 
J~i(a) is also defined because nij : 1]i --+ 1]j is a strong gl' < -map. Suppose 
J(a') > P', then there exists ayE 1]7 such that J(y) = P', and hence 
J(iijoo(y» = njoo(p') = J(iijoo(a'». 
This is a contradiction since y < a'.

Relation symbols: E, =.

g(s) is the maximum of g(3") and g("o) for all 3" and Ao which occur in s. 
Definition 16.38. Formulas and constant terms of 2' are defined as follows. 
(1) If each of t 1 and t 2 is a constant term or a variable, then (t 1 E t 2) and 
(t I = t 2 ) are formulas of 2'. 
(2) If cP and IjI are formulas, then (Icp) and (cp v 1jI) are formulas. 
(3) If cP is a formula, then (3"xi CP) is a formula. 
(4) If cp(xi) is a formula without free variables other than Xi such that 
g(cp(xi») < g(Ao), then (xicp(xi») is a constant term.

Formulas and terms are only those obtained by a finite number of

For any finite sequence Sl' ..• , Sn of symbols of fe,

Remark. From now on, we identify formulas and terms of fe with their 
codes. We need the following properties of codes. 
(1) The codes of different formulas (terms) are different. 
(2) If n: ~ -+ IJ is a medium f!J> < -map, then for each formula (term) lfJ, n( lfJ) 
is the formula (term) obtained from lfJ by replacing each occurrence of 32 and 
A. by 3,,(a) and A,,(.) respectively.

t < (xilfJ(x;)). 
(5) If lfJ is an atomic sentence, then E(lfJ) < tp. 
(6) 
lfJ < ('lfJ), lfJ < (lfJ v ljJ) and ljJ < (lfJ v ljJ). 
(1), and (3)-(6) are easily verified. We shall only prove (2). Let n: ~ -+ IJ

more each ordinal less than w 2 can be expressed in the form J ( < io, ... , in - 1 > ) 
with each of io,"" in - 1 less than or equal to 1. Therefore, if a < min(~, w2), 
then n(a) = a. Thus we have nCr s 1) = r s 1 for all symbols of fe except 3a and

Theorem 16.44. The L-machine M has the collapsing property. 
PROOF. Let 1] be an ordinal, let X be a sub algebra of M~; and let n: ij --+ X 
be the collapsing map of X. We shall prove that n: ij --+ 1] is a strong M-map. 
Since (lj> < has the collapsing property, n: ij --+ 1] is a strong (lj> <-map. 
First we show, by induction on (j), that for any sentence cP < ij of 2, 
L F (j; iff L F n(cp). We consider only the case where (j) is 3<ixie(x;). Other 
cases can be treated similarly. Let ex = n(a) and f} = nee). Then n( (p) = 
3IXxi f}(Xi) and 
L F qJ --+ (31 E T..)[L Feu)] 
--+ (3 tEI:)[L F (J(t)] 
(by the induction hypothesis) 
--+ L F 3IXxi 8(x;) 
--+ L F q>. 
Conversely, suppose L F q> and let t = K« q») E I:. Since t < q>, t = 
K~( < 
q») and hence t EX. Let 1 < ij be such that n(1) = t. Then 1 ETa, and 
by the induction hypothesis, L F e(t). Therefore L F (j). 
It is easily seen that n(T~(r.t.» ~ P(ft(r.t.» for all r.t. E ~'B. 
Next we shall prove that 
n(K~(r.t.» ~ K~(ft(r.t.» for all r.t. E ij'B. Let 
3IXXie(Xi) < ij be a sentence of 2 such that L F 3iixie(Xi). Let ex = n(a) and 
f} = n(B), then we have seen that L F 3IXx i f}(X;)' Let 11, 12 E Ta and t 1, t2 E 4. 
be 
such 
that 
n(t't) = t 1, n(l2) = t2, i\ = K«3<iXi e(Xi») and 
t2 = 
K(OIXXi8(Xi»)· Then we have L F eUl), L F e(2), L F 8(td and L F 8(t2)· 
Therefore 11 ~ t;, t 2 ~ t 1, and hence 11 = 12 • Thus we have proved that if 
K~«3iixie(X;)) ~ 11, then K~«3IXXi8(x;) ~ t 1• If K~«3IXXi8(Xi») is defined, 
then L F 3IXxi 8(x;), and so L F 3<iXi B(x;). Hence K;;( OiiXi B(Xi») is defined. o 
Theorem 16.45. M has the finiteness property. 
PROOF. Let 1] be an arbitrary ordinal, and let H~ be the finite subset of 1]

the proof of Theorem 16.35, M~(X u H~) U {1]} is a subalgebra of M~+l.

If cP is 3"x8(x), then 'TCioo(cp) = 31t,oo(Il)X'TCioo(8)(x). Suppose L F cp. Then there 
exists atE Ya such that L F 8(t), and hence, by the induction hypothesis, 
L F 'TCioo(8)('TCioo(t») with 'TCioo(t) E T,.,oo(Il)· Thus we have L F 'TCi 00 (cp). Now 
suppose L F 'TCioo(CP). Then there exists a t' E T1t,oo(Il) such that L F 'TCioo(8)(t'). 
Let j ~ i and t E T,.;;(Il) be such that 'TCjoo(t) = t'. By the induction hypothesis, 
L F 'TCi/8)(t), and hence L F 'TCi/cp). Since 'TCij: Yfi -4 Yfj is a strong M-map, we 
see that L F cp.

Let cP = 3"x8(x) be a sel;1tence that is less than Yfi. Then by (1), Kq,«cp» is 
defined iff Kqoo«'TCioo(CP») is defined. Suppose L F cP and t = Kq,«cp». We 
want to show that 'TCioo(t) = Kqoo«'TCioo(CP»). Let s' = Kqoo«'TCiOO(CP»), then by 
(1), it is obvious that s' ~ 'TCioo(t). Letj ~ i and s E T",j(Il) be such that 'TCjoo(s) = s' 
and L F 'TCi/8)(S). Since 'TCi/ Yfi -4 Yfj is a strong M-map, we see that 'TCij(t) =

it follows that if n: 1]' -+ X is the collapsing map of X, then n: 1]' -+ 1] is a

Definition 17.3. Let K be a limit ordinal.

C is closed in K A C ~ K 1\ ('<7 X ~ C)[uX < K --+ uX E C]. 
(2) 
C is unbounded in K +-+ C ~ K 1\ uC = K. 
(3) S is stationary in K iff S ~ K and S 1\ C "# °

Definition 17.4. The sequence <Sa: C( < K) is a <>(K)-sequence iff 
(1) 
('<7c(EK)[Sa ~ C(], and 
(2) 
('<7 X ~ K)[ {C( < K I X 1\ rx = Sa} is stationary in K]. 
Remark. We read <>(K) simply as "diamond kappa." 
Definition 17.5. <>(K) A there exists a <>(K)-sequence. 
Lemma 17.6. Let K be a regular uncountable cardinal and let A. be an ordinal 
such that K < A.. For each set X with X ~ A. and X < K, there exists a subalgebra 
Yof MA such that X is a subset of Y, Y < K and Y 1\ K E K. 
PROOF. By inquction on n, we define rxn and Yn as follows: 
Yo = X 
C(n = sup{C( + 11C( E ¥" 1\ K} 
¥,,+ 1 = MA(¥" u C(n). 
Finally if Y = UnEOl ¥", then it is easy to verify that Y has the desired pro-
perties.

Theorem 17.7. 
Assume that V = L. Then 
('<7 K)[K is a regular cardinal 1\ K > W --+ <>(K)]. 
PROOF. Let K be an arbitrary regular uncountable cardinal. We define a 
sequence «Sa' Ca): C( < K) as follows: 
(a) So = Co = 0, 
(b) 
Sa+l =Ca+l =0, 
(c) if C( is a limit ordinal and there exists a pair <S, C) of subsets of C( 
such that C is closed and unbounded in C( and 
('<7 Y E C)[S 1\ Y "# Sy], 
then <Sa, Ca) is the <cleast such pair <S, C), where <L is the canonical 
well ordering on L, 
(d) otherwise, Sa = Ca = 0.

We claim <Sa: CX < I() is a <>(I()-sequence. Hnot, there exists a pair <S, C) 
of subsets of I( such that C is closed and unbounded in I( and ('r/ r E C)[S n r 
#- S)']. We take the < cleast such pair <S, C). 
Let X = {I(, I(+} and let Y be a subalgebra of MK+ + such that X ~ Y, 
Y < I( and Y n I( E 1(. H CXo = Y n 1(, then CXo is closed under J, and so CXo is a 
limit ordinal. 
Let n: 1]' ...... Y be the collapsing map of Y, then 1]' < I( and n: 1]' ...... I( + + is 
a strong M-map. 
By a similar proof to that of Theorem 17.2, it can be seen that «Sa, Ca): 
0:: < I() E L K +. There exists a formula cp(xo) of 2 with only the quantifier 3K +, 
such that cp(xo) defines «Sa, Ca): cx < I() and the only constant term occur-
ring in cp(xo) is K. Let t = K«3 K + xocp(xo»), then D(t) = «Sa' Ca): CX < I(). 
Since Y is a subalgebra of MK+ + that contains I( and 1(+, it follows that t E Y. 
Let t' be a term such that t' < 1]' and net') = t. 
We let 
Sx = xr[3 K + Xl 3K + X3«X, <Xl, X 3» E t /\ Xl E Xl)], 
Cx = xf[3 K + x l 3K + X 3«X, <Xl, X 3» E t /\ Xl E X3)]. 
Then for each 13 < cxo, we have that sp, cp E Y, D(sp) = SfJ and D(cp) = CfJ. 
Similarly, we define s~ and c~ by replacing each occurrence of 1(+ and t by 
n-l(I(+) and t', respectively. We then see that 
('r/ 13 < cxo)[n(s~) = sp /\ n(cfi) = cp]. 
We shall show by induction on 13 that 
(i) 
D(sfi) = SfJ and D(cfi) = CfJ· 
The only case we have to consider is that <SfJ' CfJ) is defined by (c). Let 
I/I(xl, Xl) be the following sentence of 2: <Xl' Xl) is the <cleast pair of 
subsets of (J such that Xl is closed and unbounded in (J and 'r/fJx(x E (J ...... 
Xl n X #-
s~). Since LF n(I/I)(sp, Cjj), it follows that L F I/I(sfi, cfi). By the 
induction hypothesis, D(s~) = Sy and D(c~) = Cy for all y < 13. Hence 
<D(sfi), D(cfi» satisfies (c), and thus <D(sfi), D(cfi» = <SfJ' CfJ)· 
Let sand c be terms of if such that s, c E Y, D(s) = Sand D(c) = C. 
Their existence can be proved in the same way as above. Let s' and c' be 
such that s', c' < 1]', n(s') = sand n(c') = c. Since n 
~ CXo is the identity map 
and n(cxo) = 1(, we can easily show that 
(ii) 
D(s') = S n CXo and 
D(c') = C n cxo. 
By the same proof as (i), we can show that 
(iii) 
D(s') = Sao' D(c') = Cao 
and 
<Sao' Cao ) satisfies (c). 
From (ii) and (iii), S n 0::0 = Sao and C n CXo = Cao' But since Cao is un-
bounded in cxo, we have CXo = sup(C n CXo)E C. This contradicts the assump-
tion that ('r/y E C) [S n r #- Sy].

LemmaI7.11. Let M be a transitive set which is elementarily equivalent to 
LK for some uncountable cardinal in L. If n: <b, 0(, P) -+ <b', 0(', P') is an 
acceptable map such that <b, 0(, P), <15',0(', P') E M, then n E M. 
PROOF. Note that each of F 0, J, C;, T and K is absolute with respect to M. 
Let Fl = J, Fz = T, F3 = K and F;+4 = C; (i < w). We define a sequence 
<Xn: n < w) E M as follows: 
Xo = O(uP, 
X n + 1 = U {Ff(v): v E Xi;!}. 
i <ro 
Then 15 = MO(O( u P) = Un<co X n . Let P = {0"1' ... ' O"d and 0"; = n(O";}-
Then n is inductively defined in M as follows: 
n(v) = v if v < 0( 
(i = 1, ... , k) 
n(Ff(v» = F;(n(v» 
ifv E Xi;!, Ff(v) is defined, and Ff(v) tt U X m· 
Thus we have n E M.

that sup{1rij(v) + Ilv < bi} < bj , 
(4) 
bi < K, and 
(5) 
{exi liE I} is co final in K. 
Remark. If 0 is well founded, then it is easily seen that boo ~ K and 
SUp{1rioo(V) + 11 v < bi } < boo for all i E I. 
For every set X of ordinals, we use o(X) to denote the order type of X. 
Lemma 17.13. Let 11 and K be limit ordinals such that 11 ~ K. If (V 1] < 11) 
(V IX < K)(V Q ~ 1]) [Q is finite -+o(M~(1X u Q)) < K], then there exists a well-
founded K~direct limit system whose limit is 11. 
PROOF. Let 1= {<1], IX, Q) 11] < 11 /\ IX < K /\ IX ~ 1] /\ Q is a finite subset of 1]}. 
For each i = <1], ex, Q) E I, we set 1]i = 1], lXi = IX and Ql = Q. For any i, j E I, 
we define i < j by 
i < j A 1]i ~ 1]j /\ exi ~ IXj /\ Qi ~ Qj /\ 1]i E Qj' 
Furthermore i ~ j A i < j v i = j. It is easy to see that (V i,j E 1)(3 k E I) 
[i < k /\ j < k]. Let Xi = M~i(exi u Qi), then o(Xi) < K by our assumption. 
For each i E I, let Pi: bi --+ Xi be the collapsing map of Xi' Then bi < K 
and Pi: bi -+ 1]i is a strong M-map. If i, j E I and i <j, then by Proposition 
16.18, pjl 0 Pi is a medium M-map since "#'(Pi) = Xi ~ Xj = "#'(p), 
and also we have that sup{pj 1 0 p;(v) + 11 v < bJ < bj since 1]i E Q] ~ Xj' 
Let 1rij = pjl 0 Pi and Pi = (Pi-I)"Qi' We want to show that 0 = «b;, 
lXi' P;), 1ri)i,jEI is a well-founded K-direct limit system with 11 as its limit. By 
Theorem 16.19, p/,MOi(exi u Pi) = Xi and hence bi = MOi(exi U P;). Conse-
quently, each <bi, ex;, Pi) is an acceptable triple and 1rij: <b;, IX;, Pi) -+ 
< 
b j' ex j' P) is an acceptable map if i < j. It is clear that {exi liE I} is cofinal 
with K. 
We need to prove that 11 is the limit of O. By the definition of 1rij, we have 
(i ~ j). 
In view of Theorem 16.26, it suffices to show that 11 = UiEJ "#'(p;). Let 1] < 11 
and i = <1] + 1,0, {1]}), then 1] E Xi = "#'(p;). This complete the proof.

It is easily seen that

Hence 8j~1 0 Pioo is a medium M-map, by Proposition 16.18, and so we set 
1T.ij = 8jool 0 Pioo' It is necessary to show that <I, ~) is a directed set. To see

Let iE/ I . Since Pi is finite and SUP{Pioo(V) + 11v < eJ < III ~ 112, there

Definition 17.15. Let A and B be sets. A mapping h: A -> B is an elementary 
embedding, iff for every formula cp(x I , . .. , xn) where Xl" .. ,Xn are the only 
free variables 
Lemma 17.16. Let K be an infinite cardinal in Land h: Li{ ~ LK be an elemen-
tary embedding. Let n = «bi, iii' P;), ni)i,jE/ be a welljounded K-direct 
limit system with limit 11.. Also suppose that n = h(il) = < 
<h(bi), h(iiJ, 
h(Pi», h(nij»i,jEl is a welljounded K-direct limit system with limit 11. Then 
there exists a medium M-map h*: ii ~ 11 such that h* I' K = h I' K. (By Lemma 
17.11, nij E Li{ and hence h(ni) is defined.) 
PROOF. Let (ji = h(bJ, lXi = h(iii), Pi = h(PJ and 1T.ij = h(ni). For each 
if < b;, we let h*(niOO(if») = 1T.ioo(h(if»). First, we must show that h* is well 
defined. Let if and i be such that if < b, i < band nioo(b) = njoo(i), then 
there is a k E I with k ~ i,j such that nik(if) = njk(i), and hence 1T.ik(h(if» 
= 1T.jk(h(i»). Thus we have 1T.ioo(h(if») = 1T.joo(h(i») if ftioo(B) = njoo(f). 
Since each nioo(1T.ioo) is the identity on ii;( lXi) and {iid i E I} is co final with 
K, we have that h*(if) = h(if) for all if < K. Consequently, h* is an extension 
of hI' K.

Let ti = sup{h*(O') + 110' < jl}. We want to show that h*: jJ. ~ /1' is a 
strong M -map. Let F be one of F 0, J, Ci, T and K, and 0', i < jJ. be such that 
F( 0') = i. Then 
(3 i E 1)(3 ii', i' < DJ [rri 00 (0") = ii 1\ rrioo(i') = T]. 
Since rrioo : Di ~ ji is a medium M-map, 
F(O") = i'. 
But since h is elementary, 
F(h(ii')) = h(i'). 
Hence 
Since nioo : Ji ~ /1 is a medium M-map, 
And hence, 
F(h*(O')) = h*(i). 
Thus we have 
Fii(O') ::::: f ~ P"(h*(ii)) ::::: h*(i). 
Let 0' and r be such that 0' < jJ., r < /1' and F(h*(O')) = r. Then 
(3 i E 1)(30", i' < DJ[rrioo(ii') = 0' 1\ r ~ h*(rrioo(i'))]. 
Then r < sup{nioo(v) + 11 v < Jd = 15;, and hence FO;(nioo(h(O"))) is defined. 
Since nioo :Ji ~ 15; is a strong M-map, F"i(h(O")) is defined. It is easy to see that 
h I Di: ()i ~ Ji is a strong M-map because h is elementary, Hence, Fbi(O") is 
defined, and therefore Fii(O') is defined. Thus 
h*(Fii(ii)) ::::: P"(h*(O'))

For each singular cardinal A,

PROOF. (1) Let x ~ A be such that x = cf(A) and ux = A. Then by S there 
exists ayE L such that x ~ y ~ A and y = max(x, ~ 1). Since u y = A and A is 
regular in L, we see that yL = A. Hence we have y = J: ~ ~2. Thus, Cf(A)

Note that A ~ ~ro > ~2. By (l), A is singular in L. 
~Obviously (A+)L~A+. Suppose (A+)L<A+. From (1) cf(A+)L)

Therefore,

Let r be an arbitrary cardinal such that cf(A) ~ r < A. Since 
A" = U {a"la ~ A /\ a = r},

Case 1. r > w: By S, 
a ~ A /\ a = r --+ (3 x E L) [a ~ x ~ A /\ X = r]. 
Let X = {x ELI x ~ A /\ X = r}. Then

Therefore,

If our claim were false, then there would be an il < ji such that 
(3 fi < K)(3 Q ~ il) [Q is finite /\ o(Mii(fi u Q) ~ K]. 
Take the least such il and let fi < K, Q ~ il be such that 
Q is finite /\ o(Mii(fi u Q» ~ K. 
Then by Lemma 16.22, r; is a limit ordinal that is greater than or equal to K. 
Let n: if ~ Mii(fi u Q) be the collapsing map of Mii(fi u Q). Then K ~ 
if ~ il and n: if ~ il is a strong M-map. If P = (n-1)"Q, then by Theorem 
16.19, n"Mti(fi uP) = Mii(fi u Q). Hence if = Mii(fi uP). But by the mini-
mality of il, we have if = il. Thus we have shown that 
(3 P ~ il) [P is finite /\ il = Mii(fi u P)]. 
Since il satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma 17.13, there exists a medium M-
map, h*: il ~ On such that h* I K = h I K. Let 1] = sup{h*(O') + 11fi < il}· 
Then h*: il ~ 1] is a strong M-map. If Y = Mii(h(fi) u h*"P), then YEL and 
from Lemma 17.22.2 
yL = h(fil < K, 
because h(fi) < K. We shall show that X ~ Y. Since h*: il ~ 1] is a strong 
M-map, we have by Theorem 16.19 that 
1/f(h*) = h*"Mii(fi uP) = M~«h*"fi) u (h*"P») ~ Y. 
But X ~ "fII"(h*), since X ~ "fII"(h). Thus X ~ Y. This contradicts Lemma 
17.22.1, and the proof is completed.

(1) 
X ~ Z,Z = X; and 
(2) If n ~ Z is a Z-well-founded K-direct limit system, then n is well

First we shall prove that (2) can be replaced by the following (2'): 
(2') If n ~ Z is a countable Z-well-founded K-direct limit system, then 
n is well founded, where n is countable iff its index set is countable. 
Let Z be an elementary sub model of L" that satisfies (1) and (2'). Let 
n = «bi, ct.i, Pi)' 7ri)i,jeI ~ Z be a Z-well-founded K-direct limit system. 
Suppose that n is not well founded. Then there are sequences <in: nEw) and

(\I n E w)[in ~ in+ 1 1\ 7rinin+ ,(an) > an+ 1]. 
Since {a;li E I} is co final with K and cf(K) = w, there is a sequence <in: nEw) 
such that {ajJn E w} is cofinal with K. Let J be a subset of I such that

Then n ~ J = <

that is a subset of Z and which is not well founded. Clearly n I J is Z-well-
founded. This contradicts (2'). Thus n is well founded. 
Using Lemma 17.26, we can construct a sequence <Z .. :

that 
(a) Z .. -< L", X ~ Z .. and Z .. = X;

Let Z = Ux< N, Za. Then Z --< L,,, X ~ Z and Z = X. We want to show 
that (2') holds for this Z. Let n ~ Z be a countable Z-well-founded K-
direct limit system. Then n ~ Za for some CI. < ~ 1. If n were not well founded, 
then n would not be Za+ i-well-founded, and hence not Z-well-founded. This 
is a contradiction. Thus the lemma has been proved in the case where cf(K)

From now on, we assume that cf(K) > w. From (3) of Lemma 17.22, 
we see that X is unbounded in K. We may assume that X is closed in K, (if

For any A E S, by the same proof as that of Lemma 17.26, we can find a

We shall now prove the claim. By recursion on n, we define 'Yn E X and 
jn E I. We choose 'Yo E X arbitrarily. Since {aJ:j E 1} is cofinal with K, there 
exists a jo E I such that io ;£ jo and 'Yo < ajo' Suppose that 'Yn and jn are

Lemma 17.31. If n: On ~ On is a strong M-map, then there exists a ~t 
elementary embedding h: L ~ L such that n = h ~ On. 
PROOF. For any term t of !E, we let h(D(t)) = D{n(t)). Then h is well defined 
............ 
and for all IX EOn, h(lX) = h(D(a)) = D(n(a)) = D(n(IX)) = n(IX). 
Let ljJ(xo, ... , xn) be a bounded formula and let to, ... , tn E 'Fa.. Let 
ljJa(xo, ... , xn) be the formula of !e obtained from IjJ by replacing each

Let<p(x 1, ... , xn) be (3 xo)ljJ(xo, XI' ••• , xn) and let t1, ••• , tn be terms of !e. 
Then,

~ L F <p(D(n(t 1)), ... , D(n(tn))). 
We have to show the converse. Suppose that 
L F <p(D(n(t 1 )), ... , D(n(tn))). 
Then 
(3 P)(3 a E Lp)[n(t 1), ... , n(tn) E Tp /\ L F ljJ(a, D(n(t 1))' ... , D(n(tn)))]. 
Take IX E On such that n(lX) ~ {3. Then

Since n: On ~ 011 is a strong M-map, we have

Theorem 17.32. Assume ,S. Then there exists a ~1 elementary embedding 
from L into itself which is not the identity. 
PROOF. Let h: Lrc ~ LK be as in Lemma 17.23. We shall show that there exists 
a strong M -map h*: On ~ On such that h* ~ K = h ~ K. Then, by Lemma 
17.31, there is a 1:1 elementary embedding from L into L which extends h* 
and hence is not the identity. 
Let I = {<ii, iX, Q) Iii EOn /\ iX < K /\ iX ~ ii /\ Q is a finite subset of ii}. 
In the proof of Theorem 17.21, we showed that if <ii, iX, Q) E I, then

o(Mii(a u Q)) < K. If i = <ii, a, Q), then we set iii = ii, ai = a and Qi = Q. 
For any, i,j E I, we define i < j and i ~ j by 
i < j A iii ~ iij /\ ai ~ aj /\ Qi ~ Qj /\ 1Ji E Qj' 
i ~ j A i < j v i = j. 
Then 0, ~ > is directed, but note that I is a proper class in the present 
situation. For each i E I, let Xi = Miii(ai u Qi) and Pi: ;)i --+ Xi be the collaps-
ing map of Xi' Also let P; = Cp;-I)"Qi' When i ~j, we set 'ifu = pj-l 0 Pi' 
Then n = <

If we put n = hCfi), then n is a K-direct limit system such that lim, n is 
linearly ordered and has no infinite descending sequence. We define h*: On --+ 
!i!!!.n by 
h*(niOO(O')) = ni",,(h(O'))

extension of h I K. Obviously, h* is order preserving. We claim that 
(1) 
if x E lim) n, then {y E .lli!!.01 y < x} is a set. 
By (1) ~ 
n is well ordered and hence is order isomorphic to On. Thus 
we may assume that lim n = On. As is known from Lemma 17.16, h* is a

strong M-map from On into itself. 
Now we shall prove (1). Let A be an arbitrary regular cardinal such that 
A: ~ K and A = {x E!i!!!.n Ix < h*(A:)}. We must show that A is a set. To 
see this, it suffices to show that for any i E I there is a j E I such that iij < 1 
and "IfI(nioo) n A ~ "IfI(njoo), because this implies that 
A = U "IfI(nioo) n A ~ u{"IfI(njoo)1j E I /\ iij < ~} 
iel 
Let i E I. We may assume that iii ~ 1. Since A is regular and K ~ 1, there 
exists an ii < A such that "IfI(nioo) n 1 ~ ii. Let X = Miii(ii u ai u Q;) and 
let p: ~ --+ X be the collapsing map of X. If; = <~, ai' (p-l)"Q;), then ob-

Since 1f!"(nioo) n X = "IfI('ifioo) n ii =1f~ (njoo) n ii, it follows that 1f!"(n;oo) n X 
~ "IfI(njoo)' We choose k E I and fl < bk so that nkoo(fl) = 1 For any 1 E I with

(\I x) [x E "IfI(ni/) /\ x < nkzCfI) --+ x E "IfI(nj/)]. 
And so in L", 
Thus 
This means that 1fI(nioo) n A ~ "IfI(njoo), and we have completed the

CHAPTER 18 
Introduction to Forcing 
In proving that AC and GCH are consistent with ZF, GOdel used the so 
called method of internal models. From the assumption that the universe 
V is a model of ZF Godel prescribed a method for producing a submodel L 
that is also a model of V = L, AC and GCH. This submodel is defined as the 
class of all sets having a certain property, i.e., 
L = {xl(3 IX) [x = F'IX]}. 
Indeed since x = F'IX is absolute w.r.t. every standard transitive model M 
it follows that if 
LM = {xl(3IXEM)[x= F'IX]} 
then L M is a submodel of M that is also a model of V = L. 
If V = L is valid in every model then V = L must be provable in ZF 
and conversely if V = L is not provable in ZF then V = L is not valid in some 
model. Can we hope to find such a model by the method of internal models? 
That is, can we hope to produce a property q>(q) such that 
{xlq>(x)} 
is a model of ZF + V::f. L? There are compelling reasons for believing 
that this method cannot succeed. The arguments turn upon the assumption 
that there is a set that is a standard model of ZF. 
Theorem 18.1. If there exists a set that is a standard model of ZF then there 
exists one and only one set Mo such that 
(1) 
Mo is a countable standard transitive model ofZF + V = Land 
(2) 
M 0 is a submodel of every standard transitive model of ZF. 
215 

216 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
PROOF. From Mostowski's theorem (Theorem 12.8) every standard model is 
E-isomorphic to a standard transitive model. Therefore the existence of a 
set that is a standard model of ZF implies the existence of a set that is a 
standard transitive model. For transitive models the property of being an 
ordinal is absolute. That is, those sets in a transitive model that play the role 
of ordinals are ordinals. Furthermore, from transitivity, if r:x is in the model, 
then all smaller ordinals are in the model. But a standard transitive model 
that is a set cannot contain all ordinals. 
If r:x is the smallest ordinal not contained in such a model then r:x is the 
class of ordinals for that model. But the existence of such an ordinal implies 
the existence of a smallest such ordinal, r:xo, that is the set of all ordinals in 
some standard transitive model No. 
Since No is a model of ZF it follows that if 
Mog LNo = {xl(3r:xENo)[x= rr:xJ} = {F'r:xlr:x < r:xo} 
then Mo is a model of ZF + V = L. 
If N is any standard transitive model of ZF then N is closed w.r.t. the 
fundamental operations. Therefore since r:xo ~ N it follows that M 0 ~ N. 
From this we see that M 0 is unique, for if M 0 and M' are each standard 
transitive models with the prescribed properties then 
M 0 ~ M' and M' ~ Mo· 
Finally, from the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem, Mo contains a countable 
standard submodel. But this submodel must be E-isomorphic to a countable 
stahdard transitive model that must contain M 0 as a submodel. Hence M 0 
is countable. 
D 
Remark. The unique model Mo described in Theorem 18.1 is called the 
minimal model. Its existence follows from the existence of a set that is a 
standard model. It should be observed that the minimal model contains no 
proper transitive submodel. Thus the existence of a model of ZF does not 
imply the existence of a standard model. (See Appendix.) We clearly cannot 
prove the existence of a standard model, for that would prove the consistency 
of ZF. We therefore postulate the existence of such a model 
Standard Model Hypothesis: (3 m) SM (m, ZF). 
From this assumption and Theorem 18.1 we are assured of the existence 
of the minimal model Mo that is (1) countable, hence contains a countable 
collection of ordinals r:xo, (2) a model of ZF + V = L, and (3) a submodel of 
every standard transitive model. Indeed from Mostowski's theorem every 
standard model contains a submodel E-isomorphic to Mo. 
From the existence of the minimal model it follows that an attempt to 
prove V = Land ZF independent by the method of internal models is 
doomed to failure. Suppose that we could produce a wff q>(a) for which it is 
provable in ZF that 
{xlq>(x)} 

18 Introduction to Forcing 
217 
is a model of ZF + V -# L. It then follows that this theorem relativized to 
M 0 is also a theorem. That is 
{XE Mol cpMO(x)} 
is a submodel of M 0 that is also a model of ZF + V -# L. Since M 0 is a model 
of V = L this submodel is a proper submodel of Mo. But such a submodel of 
M 0 must be isomorphic to a standard transitive proper submodel of M 0 that 
must in turn contain M 0 as a submodel. This is impossible. 
The independence of V = L must then be established by some method 
other than that of internal models. Cohen's approach is to extend the 
minimal model Mo in the following way. Since Mo is countable and &(0)) 
is not countable, there exists a set a such that a ~ 0) and a f/: Mo. We adjoin 
such a set a to Mo to obtain Mo u {a} and we define Mo[a] to be the result 
of closing M 0 u {a} under the eight fundamental operations. Can we select 
a set a so that M o[a] is a model of ZF? We will show that we can. Moreover 
we will show that a can be selected so that the ordinals in M o[a] are 
precisely the ordinals in Mo. It then follows that 
LMo[al = {xl(3 rx E Mo)[x = F'rx]} = Mo. 
This tells us that in the universe M o[a] the class of constructible sets is Mo. 
Since a E M o [a] but a f/: M 0 it follows that a is not constructible relative to the 
universe M o [a]. That is, M o[a] is a model of V -# L. 
To prove the existence of a set a that is not in M 0 and for which M o[a] 
is a model of ZF we will develop a general theory for adjoining a set G to 
any countable standard transitive model of ZF. If M is such a model of ZF 
then the result of adjoining G to M we denote by M[G]. However in order 
for M[G] to be a model of ZF with new properties, the set G must be especi-
ally selected. Let us first describe the special properties of G that we require. 
Definition 18.2. A structure & = <P, ~) is said to be a partially-ordered 
structure if for every a, b, C E P, the following conditions are satisfied. 
(1) 
a ~ b /\ b ~ a ~ a = b. 
(2) 
a ~ b /\ b ~ C -4 a ~ c. 
Remark. For the remainder of the section let M be a countable transitive 
model of ZF, and let & = <P, ~) be a partially ordered structure in M, i.e., 
r!J E M. 
Definition 18.3. A subset D of P (in M) is dense in P iff 
(V pEP)(3qED)(q ~ p). 
Remark. Let [P] = {qEPlq ~ p}. Let {[P]lpEP} be a base of open sets 
for a topology on P. Then D is dense in P iff D is dense in the sense of the 
topology, that is, 15 = P, where 15 is the closure of D.

Definition 18.4. A subset G of P (outside M) is said to be Pl'-generic if 
(1) 
(V p, q E G)(3 r E G)(r ~ P /\ r ~ q), 
(2) 
(V P E G)(V q E P) [p ~ q -> q E G], 
(3) 
V D E M with D dense in P, D n G # O. 
Lemma 1. For every Po E P, there exists a Pl'-generic set G such that Po E G. 
PROOF. Since M is countable, we can enumerate all dense subsets of P in M, 
say D I , D2 , •••• We then define Pn+ I by introduction on n such that

Let G = {q E PI(3 n)[Pn ~ q]}. It is then obvious that G is Pl'-generic.

Remark. We now introduce a ramified language, !£,(M, G), to give a 
notation for each member of the universe M[G] which we are going to 
construct, that is, we first give the names of sets and later we will construct 
them. The symbols of !£,(M, G) are the following. 
Variables: xo, Xl"'" X n , ••• (n E w). 
Symbols for special objects: k for every k E M. 
A symbol for a special set P: P. 
A symbol for a set G which will be defined: G. 
A relation symbol: E. 
Propositional connectives: 1, /\, v. 
Quantifiers: 3" (IX EM). 
Abstraction operators: Aa (IX EM). 
Parentheses: ( , ). 
Definition 18.5. 
(1) g(3a) ~ 21X + 1, 
(2) 
g(lIa) ~ 21X + 2, 
(3) 
g(k) ~ 2 rank(k) + 3 
(4) g(G) ~ g(P) ~ 2 rank(P) + 3, 
and for any finite sequence s of symbols of !£,(M, G) 
(5) 
g(s) is the maximum of g(3a), gC a), g(k), g(G), and g(P), for all 
3a, lIa, k, G, and P which occur in s. 
Definition 18.6. Limited formulas and constant terms of !£,(M, G) are 
defined as follows. 
(1) 
k, G and P are constant terms. 
(2) If each of t I and t 2 is a constant term or a variable, then (t lEt 2) is a 
limited formula of !£,(M, G).

(3) If cp and ljJ are limited formulas, then (-,cp), (cp y ljJ), and (cp /\ ljJ) 
are limited formulas. 
(4) If cp is a limited formula, then (3 ax i CP) is a limited formula. 
(5) If cp(x;) is a limited formula without free variables other than Xi 
such that g(cp(x;)) < g(Aa), then (xi'CP(x;)) is a constant term. This constant 
term is called an abstraction term. 
(6) 
Limited formulas and terms are only those obtained by a finite 
number of applications of (1)-(5). 
Definition 18.7. p(xicp(xi)) ~ oc, p(k) ~ rank(k) and p(G) ~ rank(P) ~ p(p). 
Definition 18.8. 7;. ~ {t I t is a constant term, and p(t) < oc} and T ~

rk' = <1, k). 
For any finite sequence Sj, ... , Sn of symbols of 5t'(M, G), 
(13) 
rs j, ... , sn' ~ (2, rSj', ... , rSn')· 
Remark. The codes of limited formulas or constant terms are members of 
M and the codes of different formulas and terms are different. From now on, 
we identify formulas and terms of 5t'(M, G) with their codes. Then 7;. E M for 
every oc E M and T is a definable class of M, that is, there exists a formula 
cp(x) such that T = {x E M I M 1= cp(x)}. 
By transfinite induction on the ranks of their code, we assign the ordinals 
in M to limited formulas of 5t'(M, G).

Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
Definition 18.10. Let <p be a limited formula. 
(1) 
Ordl(<p) is the number of occurrences of the form tl Et2 in <p, 
where tl and t2 are constant terms and g(<p) = g(tl). 
(2) 
Ord2(<p) is the number of logical symbols in <p which are not con-
tained in any constant term in <po 
(3) 
Ord(<p) ~ w2g(<p) + w· Ordl(<p) + Ord2(<p) + 1. 
Remark. Ord( <p) is called the ordinal of <po It should be remarked that the 
ordinals of different formulas may be the same. Since Ord(<p) is defined by 
transfinite induction, Ord(<p) is definable in M, that is, there exists a formula 
tjJ(x, y) such that IX = Ord(ip) iff M F tjJ(r<pl, IX). 
For a constant term t, 
Ord(t) = w2 . get). 
Proposition 18.11. 
(1) 
t E J;, -> Ord(<p(t)) < Ord(:3"x;<p(xJ). 
(2) 
Ord(<p) < Ord(i<p). 
(3) 
Ord(<p) < Ord(<p /\ tjJ) and Ord(tjJ) < Ord(<p /\ tjJ). 
(4) 
t E J;, -> Ord(<p(t)) < Ord(x~<p(xJ). 
The proof is left to the reader. 
Definition 18.12. Let G be a subset of P which is possibly outside of M. 
We define DG as follows. 
(1) 
DG(x~<p(x;)) ~ {DG(t)ltE J;, /\ DG(<p(t))}. 
(2) 
DG(i<p)AiDG(<p). 
(3) 
DG(<p /\ tjJ)ADG(<p) /\ DG(tjJ).

DG(k) ~ k. 
(8) 
DG(G) ~ G. 
(9) 
DG(P) ~ P. 
(10) 
M[G] ~ {DG(t)ltET}. 
Remark. It should be noted that DG is well defined for all limited sen-
tences and constant terms in fi'(M, G). The proof is by transfinite induction 
on their ordinals. 

18 Introduction to Forcing 
221 
Proposition 18.13. M[G] is transitive and the ordinals in M[G] are the 
ordinals in M. 
The proof is left to the reader. 
Definition 18.14. For every limited sentence qJ in !f'(M, G), 
M[G] F qJ A DG(qJ). 
Definition 18.15. For a certain type of atomic limited sentence qJ of !f'(M, G), 
a limited sentence E(qJ) of !f'(M, G) is defined as follows. 
(1) If qJ is of the form t E xfqJ(xJ and get) < g(xfqJ(xJ), then 
E(qJ) A qJ(t). 
(2) If qJ is of the form tiE t2 and g(t2) ~ get I)' then 
E(qJ)A3aXi(XiEt2 /\ vaXixiEtl ~XjEXi))' 
where IX = pet 1) and Xi and Xj are the first and the second variables not 
occurring in t1 or t2 respectively. 
EXERCISES 
(1) 
If E( qJ) is defined, then 
Proposition 18.16. Let qJ be an atomic sentence for which E(qJ) is defined. 
Then 
Ord(E(qJ)) < Ord(qJ). 
Definition 18.17. Now we extend the language !f'(M, G) by introducing 
a relation symbol: M, and 
quantifiers: 3, V. 
Definition 18.18. A formula in !f'(M, G) is defined as follows. 
(1) 
Any limited formula of !f'(M, G) is a formula of !f'(M, G). 
(2) If t is a constant term or a variable, then M(t) is a formula. 
(3) If qJ and t/! are formulas, then -, qJ, [qJ v t/!], and [qJ /\ t/!] are 
formulas. 
(4) If qJ(Xi) is a formula, then (3 Xi)qJ(X;) and (V Xi)t/!(Xi) are formulas. 
A formula which is not a limited formula is called an unlimited formula. 
We defined a = b to be an abbreviation of V x(x E a ~ 
X E b). Therefore 
a = b is an unlimited formula. 

222 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
We code unlimited formulas in the following way: rMl = <0,8), r31 
= <3,0), and rlfl = <3, 1). The quantifiers 3 and V are called unlimited 
q uan tifiers. 
Remark. The intended interpretation of M(t) is "DG(t) is a member of 
M." 
Lemma 18.19. Let cp(x I , •.• , xn) be ajirst-order formula without any occur-
rence of31%, or xl% and let t l , •.• , tn E T. Then 
The proof is left to the reader. 

CHAPTER 19

Remark. We define p ft cP, read p forces cP, by transfinite induction on 
Ord (cp). 
Definition 19.1. Let PEP and let cP be a limited sentence in ff(M, G). Then 
(1) 
p ft -, cP A (V q ~ p) -, (q ft cp). 
(2) 
p ft [cpt /\ CP2] A [p It CPt] /\ [p It CP2]. 
p It [cpt v CP2] A [P It CPt] v [p It CP2]. 
(3) 
p It 3<XXi CP(Xi) A (3 t E 7;.) [p It cp(t)]. 
(4) If cP is not of the form k t E k2 and E( cp) is defined for cP, then 
p It cP A p It E(cp). 
(5) If E(t E G) is not defined, then 
p It [t E G] A (3 q ~ p) [p It V<XXi(Xi E t +4 Xi E q)] 
where I:J. = peG). 
(6) 
p It [kt E k2] A kt E k2 . 
(7) If t is not of the form k' and E(t E k) is not defined, then 
p It [t E k] A (3 k t E k) [p It V<XXi(Xi E t +4 Xi E k l )], 
where I:J. = p(k) and Xi is the first variable not occurring in t. 
Remark. Since p It cP is defined by transfinite induction on Ord(cp), 
p It cP is definable in M, that is, there exists a formula cp(x, y) such that 
P It cP iff M F cp(p, r cP 1). 
Now we extend forcing to unlimited formulas by adding the following. 
223 

224 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
Definition 19.2. 
(1) For t E 1',., p ft M(t) A p ft [t E RM(ex + 1)] where RM(ex + 1) = 
M n R(ex + 1). 
(2) 
p ft 3 Xi cp(xJ A (3 t E T) [p ft cp(t)]. 
(3) 
p ft V Xi cp(xi) A (V t E T) [p ft cp(t)]. 
Remark. Let Fn be the set of sentences in which the number of unlimited 
quantifiers is less than or equal to n. Then from the M-definability of p ft cp 
for the limited sentence cp, it follows by induction on n that for the sentences 
cp in Fn, p ft cp is definable in M, that is, there exists a formula t/ln(x, y) 
such that (p ft cp) 1\ r cp 1 E Fn iff M F t/ln(P, r cp 1). However, if cp ranges 
over all the (limited and unlimited) sentences, then p ft cp is not definable 
in M. The reason is that the number of quantifiers in t/ln increases if n in-
creases. From now on, let G be a &>-generic set. 
Lemma 19.3. q ::£ p 1\ P ft- cp ---.. q ft- cp. 
PROOF. By transfinite induction on Ord(cp). 
The details are left to the reader. 
EXERCISES 
(1) We define cp -'> 1/1 to be icp v 1/1. Then p ft cp v p ft [cp -'> 1/1] -'> p ft 1/1. 
(2) 
P ft [kdEk2] ...... kJ ¢ k2 • 
(3) 
p ft [kJ = k2] -'> kJ = k2 · 
Lemma 19.4. (3 p E G)(P ft- cp v p ft- -, cp). 
o 
PROOF. Since p ft cp is M -definable, D = {p E Pip ft cp v p ft -, cp} is a 
member of M. We claim that D is dense in P. Let pEP. If p ft- -, cp, then 
p E D. If -, (p ft -, cp), then (3 q::£ p)[q ft cp]. Therefore (3 qED)(q::£ p). 
This shows that D is dense. Therefore there exists apE G such that p E D. 0 
Lemma 19.5. -, (p ft- cp 1\ p ft -, cp ). 
PROOF. Immediate from the definition of p ft- -, cp. 
o 
Lemma 19.6 
(V P E G)(3 q ::£ p)(q ft- cp) 
+--->-
(3 p E G)(P ft- cp). 
PROQF. The "if" part is immediate from Lemma 19.3. For the "only if" part 
suppose that (V pE G)(3 q ::£ p)(q ft cp). If (3 pE G)(p ft cp) does not hold, 
then we have (3 p E G)[p ft -, cp] by Lemma 19.4. This contradicts (V pEG) 
(3 q ::£ p)(q H- cp).

Theorem 19.7. For a sentence cp, (3 p E G)(P ft cp) iff M[G] F cp. 
PROOF. First we prove this for a limited sentence cp by transfinite induction on 
Ord(cp) then we prove it for an unlimited sentence cp by induction on the 
number of logical symbols in cp. Though there are many cases, almost all of 
the cases can be proved by a straightforward check of the definition and the 
induction hypothesis. Therefore we treat only the case where cp is ,ljI or 
tEG.

Corollary 19.8. For a finite order sentence cp(t 1, ... , tn) without any occurrence 
of xa or 3a, we have 
(3 p E G)(p H- CP(tl' ... , tn)) +-+ M[G] F cp(DG(t 1), ••• , DG(tn)). 
PROOF. This is immediate from Theorem 19.7 and Lemma 18.19. 
D 
Theorem 19.9. M[G] satisfies the axioms ofZF. If M satisfies AC, then M[G] 
satisfies AC too. 
PROOF. (1) Axiom of Pairing. This is obvious since {DG(t 1), DG(t 2 )} = 
DG(Xi(Xi = tl V Xi = t2») where rJ. = max(p(t 1), p(t2)) + 1. 
(2) 
Axioms of Unions. This is immediate since (DG(t)) = DG(xf+l 3aXk 
(Xi E X k 1\ X k E t)) for some appropriate rJ., Xi and Xk. 
(3) Axiom Schema of Separation. Let t E ~ and t 1, ... , tn E T. We would 
like to show that {x E DG(t)IM[G] F cp(x, DG(t 1), ••• , DG(tn»} is a member

(4) 
Axiom of Infinity. This is obvious since (JJ is in T. 
(5) 
Axiom ofF oundation. This is obvious since M[G] is a transitive model. 
(6) 
Axiom of Extensionality. This is obvious since M[G] is a transitive 
model. 
(7) 
Axiom Schema of Replacement. Let a E M[G]. We would like to show 
from the assumption M[G] F ('if x)(3 y)<p(x, y), that 
(3 bE M[G])(M[G] F ('if x E a)(3 y E b)I/I(x, y»). 
Let a = DG(t) and t E T:z. Since the Axiom Schema of Replacement holds for 
M, there exists a f3 E M such that 
('if t' E T:z)('if p E P)(3 s')[P ft <p(t', s')] --. (3 s' E Tp)[P ft <p(t', s')]). 
Let S = xP(xo E Xo V ,xo E xo) and b = DG(s). It is easily seen that b 
satisfies the condition. 
(8) 
Axiom of Powers. We would like to show that M[G] F ('if y)(3 z) 
('if x ~ y)(x E z). Let t E T:z. We will show that there exists an s E Tsuch that 
M[G] F ('if x ~ t)(x E s). For each tl E T let 
B(t 1) = {<p,So)lpEP 1\ soET:z 1\ p·l+ [t1 ~ t] 1\ Pit [SoEtl]}' 
Obviously B(t1) E M for every tl E T. For every t 1, t2 E T, we claim that 
(i) 
[M[G] F tl ~ t 1\ t2 ~ t 1\ tl # t2] -+ [B(t1) # B(t2)]. 
For this purpose, suppose M[ G] F t 1 ~ t 1\ t 2 ~ t 1\ t 1 # t 2' Then there 
exists an So E T:z such that M[G] F So E tl 1\ So ¢ t2 or M[G] F So ¢ tl 
1\ So E t2. Therefore there exist pEG and So E T:z such that 
Pit tl ~ t 1\ pit t2 ~ t 1\ P It So E tl 1\ ,p It So E t2 
or 
Pitt 1 ~ t 1\ pitt 2 ~ t 1\ 'p It So E t 1 1\ P It So E t 2 . 
Therefore (i) is proved. From this, we have 
[M[G] F tl ~ t 1\ t2 ~ t 1\ B(tl) = B(t2)] --. [M[G] F t1 = t2]. 

19 Forcing 
Since {B(t 1) I tIE T} ~ &( P x Ya), there exists a f3 E M such that 
(V tl E T)(3 tz E Tp)[B(tl) = B(tz)J. 
It is now obvious that we can take s to be xg(xo E Xo V Xo rf; xo). 
227 
(9) 
Axiom oj Choice. Here we assume that M satisfies the Axiom of 
Choice. 
Since M[G] satisfies the axioms of ZF with the language containing the 
predicate M, we can carry out every construction of T, DG(t), P ft t for M 
and Gin M[G]. 
Since M satisfies the Axiom of Choice, we can well order Ya for every 
IY. E M. Therefore we can well order {DG(t)I t E Ya} in M[G]. It is then obvious 
that the Axiom of Choice holds in M[G].

Remark. There are numerous applications of forcing to independence 
problems in set theory. Here we treat only the first application of Cohen's 
original paper, the independence of V = L from ZFC + GCH. 
Let M be a countable transitive model of ZF + V = L. In M, we define 
& = (P, ~) as follows (Every notion should be relativized to M): 
P £ {<P, q)lp ~ W /\ q ~ W /\ P < W /\ q < W /\ P n q = OJ. 
<-PI' ql) ~ < pz, qz) A Pz ~ PI /\ qz ~ ql· 
Let G be &-generic over M. Let <PI' ql) and <pz, qz) be members of G. 
Then there exists <P3, q3) E G such that <P3, q3) ~ (PI' ql) and (P3' q3) 
~ <pz, qz)· Therefore PI n qz = 0 and pz n ql = O. Let a = u{pl(3 q) 
[<P, q) E G]} and b = u{ql(3 p)[(p, q) E G]}. Then a ~ w, b ~ wand 
an b = o. We claim that b = W -
a. Suppose otherwise, that is, suppose 
there exists an nEW such that n rf; a u b. Then D = {(p, q) E Pin E P V n E q} 
is obviously dense. Since G is &-generic, G n D =1= 0 and n E a u b. 
G is obviously obtained from a by the following formula: 
G = {(p, q)lp ~ a /\ q ~ W - a /\ p < W /\ q < w}. 
Lemma. Grf;M. 
PROOF. Let c E M be &-generic over M. Let a' = u {p I (3 q) [ (p, q) E c]} and 
b' = u{ql(3 p)[(p, q) EC]}. Then a' ~ wand b' = w - a'. Let D = P - c. 
It suffices to show that D is dense. Let (p, q) E P. Since P and q are finite, 
there exists an nEW such that nrf;puq. Let p'=p and q'=qu{n} if 
n E a' and p' = p u {n} and q' = q otherwise. Obviously <p', q') ~ <p, q) and 
(p', q') ED.

Theorem 19.10. M[G] is a model ojZFC + GCH + V =1= L. 
PROOF. We have already proved that M[G] is a model of ZFC. Since in 
M[G J the class of constructible sets is M, it follows that G rf; M implies that 
M[G] does not satisfy V = L. So it suffices to show that M[G] satisfies 

228 
Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory 
GCH. If we use Theorem 15.44(2), a ~ w 1\ V = La ---> GCH, then we get 
the result immediately as follows: Obviously M[G] F a ~ W 1\ V = La. 
Therefore M[G] F GCH. But we would like to prove this without using the 
Theorem 15.44(2). 
First we will show that the notion of cardinality is the same in M and 
M[G]: Since M ~ M[G], an ordinallY. is a cardinal in M if IY. is a cardinal in 
M[G]. To show that IY. is a cardinal in M[G] if IY. is so in M, let fJ < IY. and 
M[G] F f: PQi1i6(X, where f E T. Then there exists a Po E G such that 
Po ft (V xo)(V xl)(V XZ)(xl = f(xo) 1\ Xz = f(xo) ---> Xl = xz), 
where Xl = f(xo) is an abbreviation of some formula. From this we have, 
Po ft 11 = f(10) 1\ Po ft 1z = f(10) ---> Yl = Y2' 
Suppose 1Y.1 < IY.. Then there exists a fJl < fJ such that M[G] F (Xl = f(Pl)' 
Therefore we have 
Therefore 
(3 P E G)(p ~ Po 1\ P ft (Xl = f(Pl»' 
ex ~ {<p, fJl)lp ~ Po 1\ (31Y. 1)(P ft (Xl = f(Pl)]} 
~ P x fJ = max(w, p), 
where the calculation of the cardinalities can be carried out in M because 
ft can be defined in M. 
Next we show that gt'(t'{~) = t'{d 1 holds in M[G]. First we note that 
t'{~ E T~« + 1 and Y < t'{~ ---> Y E T~«. Let B(t 1) be as in the proof of the Axiom 
of Powers in Theorem 19.9 but with IY. replaced by t'{~. Then the argument 
there shows that 
=:::::::::::==M[G] 
M 
M 
gt'M[G](t'{~) 
~ gt'M(P X T NJ 
= gt'M(t'{~) 
= t'{~+ 1 
holds in M[G]. This completes our proof. 
o 
Now we can show the independence of V = L from ZFC + GCH. 
Suppose V = L is provable from ZFC + GCH. Then V = L is provable 
from a finite subsystem T of ZFC + GCH. Let the maximum number of 
quantifiers in the axioms in T be m. Let (ZFC + GCH)m denote the axioms 
of ZFC + GCH in which the number of quantifiers is less than or equal to m. 
For any integer m we can define the truth definition Tm such that for every 
sentence cp, in which the number of quantifiers is less than m, 
Tm(r cp 1) <---> cp. 
By the usual proof of the Skolem-L6wenheim theorem, we can construct 
a countable transitive model of (ZFC + GCH)m. Let M' be such a model. 
If m is sufficiently large relative to k, then we can develop forcing theory for 
those formulas whose number of logical symbol is less than or equal to k. 
Therefore we can show that M'[G] is a model of (ZFC + GCHr + V -=1= L.

Appendix 
Let M, SM, and Consis(ZF) be statements that assert respectively: 
(1) There exists a set that is a model of ZF. 
(2) There exists a set that is a standard model of ZF. 
(3) ZF is consistent. 
Furthermore, let Consis(ZF) be so chosen that it is absolute w.r.t. every 
standard transitive model of ZF. 
Theorem. -, I-zF M ---+ SM. 
PROOF. Suppose 
(1) 
hF M ---+ SM. 
It is known that 
(2) 
I-ZF M +4 Consis(ZF). 
Consequently, from (1) and (2) 
(3) 
Consis(ZF) I-ZF SM. 
There exists a minimal standard transitive model of ZF, Mo. Clearly 
(4) 
Mo F Consis(ZF) 
Then relativizing. (3) to M 0, using the fact that Consis(ZF) is absolute 
w.r.t. M o, we have 
Mo F SM. 
This is a contradiction.
