Preface
T
his text is a history of the American criminal justice system, written for
students of criminal justice and those interested in the history of crime and
punishment as a corrective to those who think history must be boring. As a PhD
in history and a criminal justician who has taught history of criminal justice–
related courses to thousands of criminal justice students over the past 17 years,
ranging from History of Prisons and History of Murder to History of Organized
Crime, I have been in a position to understand what historical lessons resonate
for modern students seeking careers in criminal justice–related careers, especially
corrections, law enforcement, law school, policing, counterterrorism, and orga-
nized crime suppression, to name just a few. This book offers lessons beyond the
field of criminal justice and should find an audience in history classrooms as well.
Since this text is a historical overview of the history of the American criminal
justice system, we follow the evolution of criminal justice chronologically and, when
necessary, show parallels between related criminal justice issues in different historical
eras—perhaps none so crucial today as the issues surrounding American civil liberties
and the current “war on terrorism.” As America adapts to criminal justice in the age
of terrorism and the USA Patriot Act, it is important to recognize historical antece-
dents that parallel today’s emphasis on the terrorist threat to understand the adapt-
ability of the criminal justice system to national crisis. To understand the history of
the criminal justice system one can draw lessons from previous eras in American his-
tory, when citizens had to confront the controversial trade-off between reduced civil
liberties and national security (e.g., the Red Scare of 1919, Japanese American in-
ternment during World War II, and the communist scare of the cold war era). Each
time the criminal justice system weathered these challenges with civil liberties intact.
The criminal justice system is, however, changing more quickly than ever
before. What was once a slow evolution based on experimentation and innova-
tion has turned into a dynamic and proactive attempt to contain and suppress
criminal behavior that was almost unthinkable in years past. No one can forecast
what the next chapter in this saga will hold.

ORGANIZATION
Writing a history of the criminal justice system is a challenging task. With such a
wealth of sources to draw from, it requires a certain historical judgment as to
what to include and what to leave out. Since a history of all criminal justice
systems is beyond the scope of this book, the author draws from historical and
other sources that best explain the evolution of the current American criminal
justice system, which is rooted in Old Testament ethics and morality, English
antecedents, and the peculiar conditions of American history.
Each chapter is broken down into five crucial components related to the his-
torical perspective of the American criminal justice system, components that largely
explain the evolution of a peculiarly American reaction to crime and crime con-
trol. Each chapter begins with a section on Lawmakers and the judiciary before
delving into Law Enforcement, Corrections, Crime and Punishment, and Ameri-
can Violence. An understanding of American criminal justice history should be
rooted in the political, economic, and social patterns of American life. These are
often explained in terms of race relations, immigration, economic dislocation, and
certain regional predilections for violence and capital punishment (the South) or
for order and capital punishment abolition (New England). When possible, these
issues and others are brought into play to help explain the continuum in criminal
justice patterns that exists in all regions of the country.
The following presents a summary of each chapter.
Chapter 1, “From Customs to Codes: Criminal Justice in the Ancient
World,” examines the ancient roots of criminal justice. It focuses on the
development of written law codes from customs that evolved before the
advent of writing. Although other societies developed legal codes and
criminal justice–related practices, this book focuses on those that most in-
spired the development of the English and American criminal justice sys-
tems. Among the civilizations covered in this chapter are the Near Eastern
Hammurabic and Mosaic codes, Greek and Roman criminal justice, and the
development of church law.
Chapter 2, “English Criminal Justice Traditions” details the development of
English criminal justice and common law. It covers the history of English
criminal justice from the Anglo-Saxon period and the Viking invasions through
the creation of the English Constitution and Bill of Rights. After reading the
chapter, the reader will have a better understanding of how the development of
criminal justice institutions in Britain gave rise to the American criminal justice
system following British colonization of America’s Eastern Seaboard.
Chapter 3, “Criminal Justice in Early America,” follows the British coloni-
zation process as English criminal justice practices are modified in the New
World. What’s more, it breaks down the development of colonial criminal
justice into various regions, including the Southern Colonies exemplified
by Virginia; New England, characterized by Massachusetts; and the Mid-
Atlantic Colonies featuring Pennsylvania. This is important for understand-
ing why certain patterns still continue to exist in different regions to this day.

Chapter 4, “Criminal Justice in Revolutionary Times,” examines the evo-
lution of American criminal justice procedures during the years surrounding
the American Revolution. The ratification of the American Constitution
and the Bill of Rights completes the cycles of legal development spurred by
the English Constitution a century earlier.
Chapter 5, “Criminal Justice in the New Nation,” focuses on the develop-
ment of the American penitentiary and various experiments in policing
ranging from city guards, Texas Rangers, and the French Surete to city
marshals and high constables.
In Chapter 6, “Criminal Justice in Antebellum America,” the sectional crisis
takes center stage as the developing American criminal justice system is chal-
lenged on several fronts, including states’ rights versus federal law, mob violence,
and new sentencing procedures (good behavior and indeterminate sentencing).
Chapter 7, “Criminal Justice in the Civil War Era,” follows the impact of the
Civil War on the nation’s criminal justice institutions. The Civil War had great
consequences for the southern states when half the southern population made
the transition from slavery to freedom. However, a number of obstacles were
created by southern criminal justice institutions that would contradict the pro-
mises of freedom contained in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments.
This chapter also focuses on urban politics and corruption in New York City,
attempts at prison reform, and the creation of the U.S. Secret Service.
Chapter 8, “Criminal Justice in Victorian America,” examines an era marked
by political and labor dissension, new identification systems such as Bertillo-
nage and fingerprinting, and the introduction of new methods of execution
(e.g., the electric chair). It is also a period when big-city police reformers
finally took on the rampant corruption and political patronage, negating the
effectiveness of urban police forces.
Chapter 9, “Criminal Justice in the Progressive Era,” focuses attention on
the reform attempts by Progressive reformers. Despite the intentions of the
reformers, the Prohibition era in the Crisis Decades just on the horizon
would nullify many of their reforms. World War I, together with the rise of
Bolshevism in Russia, intensified the old fears of native Americans who then
lashed out at immigrants, labor agitators, and anarchists, challenging civil
liberties in the process. However, this was also an era of police and prison
reform that introduced college cops, motorcycle patrols, and female police
and national police organizations to the front lines of crime fighting.
In Chapter 10, “Criminal Justice in the Crisis Decades,” no years had more
ramifications for the evolution of the criminal justice system than the second
and third decades of the twentieth century. This chapter highlights the ex-
pansion of federal criminal justice with the creation of the Bureau of Inves-
tigation and the impact of Prohibition and the Great Depression on the
nation’s crime problem. Other important topics include the criminalization
of certain narcotics, the trend toward police professionalization, and the
sensationalism of the era’s crime reporting.

Chapter 11, “Criminal Justice at Midcentury,” considers the impact of the
world war and anticommunism on civil liberties (e.g., Japanese internment and
McCarthyism); increasing racial tensions leading to riots in Los Angeles, Detroit,
Harlem, and other cities; and a new focus on organized crime in America.
Chapter 12, “Nationalization of Criminal Justice,” delves into the new
challenges to the criminal justice system presented by the era’s social unrest.
This period was most notable for a number of Supreme Court decisions
that increased the rights of the accused while limiting the powers of police.
Rising crime rates, urban riots, and antiwar violence would lead police ex-
ecutives and political leaders to examine the role of police as crime fighters.
These years would also be marked by an about-face in public opinion on the
death penalty.
Chapter 13, “Contemporary Criminal Justice at the End of the Twentieth
Century,” covers criminal justice in the last two decades of the twentieth
century, an era characterized by rising and falling crime rates and the im-
plementation of a number of “get-tough” crime policies that have led to
America’s overcrowded prison system. The rise in crime in the 1980s sig-
naled a more punitive era in American criminal justice, one in which
lawmakers responded by rewriting laws, shifting money from schools to
prisons, and locking up record numbers of people under new sentencing
guidelines. Serial killers, mass murderers, FBI confrontations, police brutality,
and acts of domestic terrorism dominated news coverage. But what was most
unexpected was the drop in crime in cities such as New York, where old
strategies of community policing borrowed from past historical experience
were combined with new technologies of the approaching twenty-first
century, such as Compstat, to make cities safer.
Chapter 14, “Criminal Justice in the Age of Terrorism,” begins with the
unexpected attacks of September 11 and their concomitant affect on every
level of the criminal justice system. This chapter is shadowed by the impact
of the USA Patriot Act and the reorganization of federal criminal justice, as
well as emerging issues such as extraordinary rendition, military tribunals,
roving wiretaps, and black site prisons in foreign countries. Except for acts of
international terrorism, no form of criminality garnered more headlines or
had bigger national repercussions in this era than the multi-billion-dollar
white collar scandals and their accompanying affect on the nation’s financial
stability. These and other emerging issues are covered as well. This chapter
has been expanded to include various new alternatives to imprisonment, the
crisis of an aging prison population, and the emergence of prison gangs.
LEARNING TOOLS
To help the reader navigate the immense body of knowledge related to criminal
justice history, each chapter is supplemented and organized with a number of
learning tools. Each chapter begins with a set of Learning Objectives to offer

the appropriate themes that should be gleaned from each chapter. This is
followed by an extensive Time Line that allows the student to check on which
events occur at which point in the historical process and perhaps play a role as a
catalyst in events to come. Each chapter concludes with a trial that documents
the legal process and offers insight into the American criminal justice system at
various points in history. This is followed by a Point-Counterpoint that uses pri-
mary documents and the actual words of participants in the criminal justice pro-
cess to give the reader both sides of various controversies. Additional features
included in the book include the following:
“History Vignette” Boxes. Throughout this book, various vignettes/time cap-
sules are included to illustrate significant moments in criminal justice history,
parallels between past and present criminal justice, and contributions to the
criminal justice system made by individuals reflecting the diversity of the
American people.
Critical Thinking Questions. These were conceived as a baseboard for exam-
ining the lessons of each chapter in greater detail.
Key Terms. An understanding of the key terms in each chapter plays an im-
portant role in the overall learning process and helps differentiate the more
important names, incidents, and ideas crucial to that chapter.
Famous Trials. Each chapter ends with a notable trial from the period. Many
are not the traditional trials captured on truTV. Some are political in nature
(e.g., Sacco v. Vanzetti and the Rosenbergs), while others were selected because
they had a major effect on history (e.g., Zenger trial) or were of legal sig-
nificance (e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright). As one criminal justice historian has
noted, “Not much is known about the day-to-day work of the courtroom”1
prior to 1800. If one wants to reveal the ordinary criminal process it would
require a painstaking examination of contemporary newspaper coverage,
since only the most sensational cases bothered with trail transcripts. Several
sensational cases are covered as well (e.g., O.J. Simpson, Lizzie Borden).
Point-Counterpoint. These sections discuss issues important in criminal justice
using primary documents and the actual words of participants in the criminal
justice process to give the reader both sides of various issues and
controversies.
Glossary. For anyone confused by the difference between heresy and blas-
phemy or treason and sedition, a handy expanded and updated glossary is
included at the end of the book. Here students will find definitions of un-
familiar and familiar words that make up the lexicon for the history of
American criminal justice.
Who’s Who in Criminal Justice History. In addition, throughout the text a
number of famous people make brief cameos. To guide students through
this crowd of individuals, some well known but many unfamiliar, a “Who’s
Who in Criminal Justice History” section highlights the accomplishments
and dates associated with each individual. It is hoped that these biographical
capsules will lead students to pursue the lives of these people in more detail.

NEW FOR THE SEC OND EDITION
What sets this book apart from the first edition are several new tools that make the
material significantly easier to digest. As noted, this edition has added Learning Ob-
jectives to the beginning of each chapter and Key Terms to the conclusion of each.
What’s more, it offers up-to-date coverage of white-collar crime issues ranging from
the mortgage scandal to the Enron scandal and the return of the Ponzi scheme ex-
emplified by the case of Bernard Madoff. Also featured are the following:
New Boxed Inserts. This new edition features more than 30 new sidebars,
many reflecting important issues, events, or personages left out of the first
edition, or new historical legislation directed at unjust decisions in prior
criminal justice cases dating back to the Salem witch trials.
New and Revised Sidebars in Chapter 1. This included expanding and updating
current cases on the punishment of stoning (lapidation), updating results
from the San Francisco dog mauling case, and a new sidebar on Supreme
Court decisions and the Ten Commandments.
New and Revised Information in Chapter 3. Updates include dealing with the
colonial origins of Blue Laws and the continuum of piracy from the colonial
era to the present.
Revised Section on Prisons in Chapters 4 and 5. In the former edition there was much
repetition in these two chapters relating the birth of the American penitentiary. To
rectify this, material on the early New York prisons and prison reform was moved
from Chapter 4 to the next chapter, where the material on the Auburn System
has been substantially revised. (This passage was retitled “The Auburn System.”) In
Chapter 5, material on French police and law enforcement was revised.
Revised Chapter 7. The heading “Judicial System” and its accompanying text
were deleted and some of the material on Anthony Comstock was moved to
Chapter 8 under “Comstock Laws.” “Post–Civil War West” was deleted and
most of the passage moved under the “Crime and Punishment” heading.
“Corruption” was changed to “Corruption and City Boss,” which was
amended. To cover the birth of domestic terrorism during the Civil War era,
the heading “Sectional Violence” was retitled “Birth of Domestic Terrorism.”
Revised Chapter 8. There were several factual errors and historical contro-
versies that needed correction and updating from the first edition, including
a quote by Edwin Sutherland that had been previously misidentified in
both verbiage and date. Another passage on criminal identification and the
often-chronicled story of the two Will Wests is revisited with new research
suggesting that its importance was exaggerated. Also added is a sidebar on
violent anarchism in America. Other new sidebars examine Western Town
Marshals and the arrival of the Mafia in America.
Revised Chapter 9. Revised passages include President Roosevelt and the
creation of the Bureau of Intelligence, corrections on the number of
American drug addicts under Drug Laws, and the revision of a passage under
“Corrections” concerning the industrial era of prison reform. New sidebars

cover recent attempts to gain a full pardon for boxer Jack Johnson, who was
convicted 60 years ago of violating the Mann Act, and one reviewing
modern gun-control laws and the continuing lack of consensus on this issue.
Revised and Added Sidebars to Chapter 12. Passages on the Attica Riot were updated,
organized crime and capital punishment were revised, and new sidebars were
added on the Kansas City Preventive Experiment, COINTELPRO, Cooper v.
Pate and prison gangs, the RICO Act, and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.
Reorganized and Expanded Chapter 13. In this edition 19 new passages have
been added or expanded and revised from the first edition, covering a range
of issues including the affect of the death of basketball star Len Bias and the
anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, the Brady Handgun Bill and guns in America,
the insanity defense, the Anti-Terror and Effective Death Penalty Act of
1996, community policing at the end of the twentieth century, restorative
justice, execution versus life without parole, faith-based initiatives, truth-
in-sentencing and the prison building boom, and other issues.
New Chapter 14. Chapter 14 is substantively a new chapter since it covers
issues since the last edition and in particular has been updated to include the
impact of the age of terrorism on the reorganization of the American criminal
justice system; coverage of constitutional issues arising from the age of terror-
ism including torture, rendition, military tribunals; as well as examinations of
recent criminal justice issues such as debates over the death penalty and lethal
injection and the decline of the death penalty in America. The chapter also
examines the prominence of white-collar crime and the surprising continuity
between the Bush and Obama presidencies in regard to the USA Patriot Act.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
As I have noted on more than a few occasions, no one writes a book alone.
Academic referees, editors, colleagues, and students have all made contributions to
the second edition, making it an improvement over the previous edition. This sec-
ond edition would not have been possible without the support and timely sage ad-
vice from my editor, Carolyn Henderson Meier and from the attention devoted to it
by Project Manager Lindsay Bethoney. This book could not have been completed
without the forbearance of my wife Ines and daughter Erica, to whom this book is
dedicated. I thank them with all of my heart for their patience and fortitude in allow-
ing me to spend extended hours writing and reading upstairs in my inner sanctum.

One of the most intriguing questions facing anthro-
pologists, criminologists, sociologists, and other
scholars is how the earliest preliterate societies man-
aged to not only survive but also maintain peace and
order without written law codes. There is little argu-
ment that the earliest laws were derived from folk
customs, evolving from loose but unquestionable
rules to fixed but more specific practices. Until rela-
tively recently, many anthropologists scoffed at the
notion of legal life in primitive cultures but instead
saw “custom as king.” Law has always existed in one
form or another. Without rules to maintain order,
anarchy threatens the very existence of a community.
Before the jury, the court system, and the pen-
itentiary, early societies relied on unwritten customs
that often were more rigid than written law. French
Enlightenment philosophers such as Rousseau often
idealized these natural societies. But free from law
does not necessarily mean freedom. In reality, prim-
itive societies are ruled by customs often as definite
as any law code. Individuals in preliterate society
are bound together in a web of regulations enforced
by thousands of taboos. In his study of primitive
law, E. Adamson Hoebel described a taboo as a
“social injunction that is sanctioned by supernatural
action.”1 These unwritten rules are rigid and un-
compromising and in some cultures can determine
when one should stand or walk, sit or rise, and sleep
or eat.
The earliest societies relied on customs, magic,
and religion to maintain order prior to the advent
of complex systems of law. In primitive cultures,
any breach of the customary code could expose
an offending individual—as well as his or her cor-
responding social group—to the wrath of the gods.
Responsibility was collective in nature, as was pun-
ishment. By violating taboos, an individual was
committing a serious transgression (beginning with
Mosaic code, these were equivalent to sins).2
Hence, it was necessary for the community to pun-
ish the individual to prevent supernatural forces
from taking revenge on the tribal group. When
members of a society believe that consequences of
a sinful act will spread to the entire group, rather
than affecting just the sinner, sins become crimes.
Taboos in primitive cultures ranged from incest
and witchcraft to treason and sacrilege. In eighteenth-
century England, the most serious secular crime was
treason, and the worst religious offense was sacrilege,
both demanding gruesome modes of punishment.
Englishmen, one and all, saw these crimes as a threat
to the state much in the way primitive societies saw
them as threats to the existence of their meager com-
munities. Accordingly, it should not be unexpected
that these offenses remain serious charges into the
twenty-first century.
In preliterate cultures, it was understood that if
members were to live together in communities
comprised of a family or tribe, they must respect
the rights of other members of that unit. Over
time, these rights became recognized customs ap-
proved by the community. Obviously, the origins
of these customs are obscure, but there is little
doubt that the acceptance of certain rules of con-
duct enabled families and tribes to evolve into larger
communities and finally into nation-states.
Courts, police, corrections, and laws are basic
components of the modern criminal justice system.
With the shift to the belief in personal property,
which gave individuals economic authority, and the
state, which defined citizenship and rights, the indi-
vidual became a distinct entity. Paralleling these ad-
vances was the development of courts to levy fines
and render judgments that allowed societies to make
the transition from custom to law. Here, then, the
broad outlines of criminal justice begin to take shape.
Although formal law enforcement is nonexistent
in primitive society, the development of legal

procedures led to the introduction of a central au-
thority, law codes, courts, and constables or a police
presence to enforce the developing system.
Primitive cultures did not need to develop
complex legal concepts until they began to congre-
gate in communities of hundreds or thousands. It
was only then that conditions necessitated the es-
tablishment of an authority to enforce sanctions,
rules, and regulations. While custom emanated
from the people, law was forced on the community
by the decree of a master, ruler, monarch, or group
of elders, such as an oligarchy.
The first stage in the evolution of law was per-
sonal revenge. Without a formal apparatus to adju-
dicate
criminal
behavior,
preliterate
societies
allowed private disputes to be settled in a personal
manner. Among the Indian tribes of lower California,
every man was regarded as his own policeman and
was allowed to administer justice in the form of
vengeance. As individuals banded together in com-
munities, conflict was viewed as a personal affair to
be arbitrated privately between the victim and the
perpetrator. It became acceptable for the victim’s
kin—not the community, clan, or tribe—to extract
revenge. Because this system was accepted by both
parties, it was assumed that the killing of the perpe-
trator would resolve the conflict. Hence, the injured
party was imbued with many of the components
of today’s criminal justice system, acting as judge,
jury, and executioner.
Revenge or vengeance is a natural component
of most criminal justice systems. Nowhere is this
more obvious than in capital punishment. Today,
the United States remains one of the few in the
industrialized world to maintain the death penalty,
but in the spirit of lex talionis (“an eye for an eye, a
tooth for a tooth”), Hammurabi, and the Bible,
although there are other capital crimes, over the
past half century the penalty has been used only
to punish those who take a life: the most literal
interpretation of accountability.
A community’s reaction to antisocial behavior
was governed by a simple basic drive: revenge. By
killing a perpetrator, there would be no recurrence
of that behavior. Victims initially determined the
extent of retribution, which was usually not
proportional to the original offense. In such in-
stances, then, it was not unusual for the perpetrator
to become the victim, leading to an indefinite cycle
of violent revenge or a feud. Living on the bare
margins of existence, primitive communities could
ill afford the continuous destruction of life and
property. The negative ramifications of an unbro-
ken cycle of revenge led preliterate communities to
place limits on vengeance, which over time became
the first laws and codes of the historical era.
The first constraints on blood feuds took the
form of what is better known as “blood revenge.”
The first step toward controlling the magnitude of
vengeance was to place the responsibility for punish-
ing the perpetrator in the hands of the group rather
than allowing a specific family member to gauge the
measure of revenge. In this case, an injury suffered by
the member of a family, clan, or tribe was regarded as
an injury to the entire community, and revenge was
arbitrated in like fashion by the victim’s immediate
community. This was a major step in the develop-
ment of law because it took the mode of revenge out
of the hands of a private offender and placed it into
the collective hands of the community.
Over time, the consequences of this behavior
could prove devastating to a community, and a sys-
tem of compensation was introduced—the next
major contribution to the foundations of early crim-
inal justice. One measure of a civilization’s complex-
ity is the distance between the feuding individuals
and the administration of revenge. After measures
were taken to replace vengeance with compensa-
tion, this new protocol became more complex as
community leaders began to maintain order and set-
tle conflicts through a range of activities, including
adjudication, mediation, and arbitration.
The transition to the legal stage of government
occurs when a society recognizes certain rules and
procedures, a level of development that usually re-
quires the knowledge of writing. Writing allows
substantive laws to pass from the oral tradition, of-
ten the preserve of certain recognized individuals,
to the society at large. For example, prior to the
development of writing in Iceland in the twelfth
century, the “lawspeaker” was the only authority
on the country’s laws, and every year he was

required to recite one-third of the laws to the com-
mon people. His term in office lasted three years,
just long enough to recite the complete collection.
To understand the development of the Western
legal tradition as well as the roots of the American
criminal justice system, we must understand histori-
cal developments pertaining to crime and punish-
ment in classical antiquity. Readers will find many
similarities between crime in the ancient world and
the present, with all forms of criminality surviving the
transition from antiquity to the modern era. Treason,
murder, adultery, robbery, and rape were all defined
as criminal behavior in earlier eras, although the defi-
nition of some of these offenses has evolved.
If anything has changed, it is the individuality
of punishment that existed in classical antiquity.
Burning, scourging, impalement, and mutilation
have fortunately been scuttled in favor of the ware-
housing of criminals in sterile, modern prisons and
the introduction of more painless methods of capi-
tal punishment. The following is a brief survey of
the earliest lawmaking advances, beginning with
Hammurabi’s code in the ancient Near East and
ending with the relocation of the Roman capital
to Constantinople following the fall of the western
Roman Empire in the fifth century.
CODE OF HAMMU RABI
Almost 4,000 years ago, the plains between the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in what is today Syria
and Iraq, became the setting for one of the world’s
first great civilizations. By 5000 B.C., this region was
home to large communities of people. Population
pressure gave stimulus to better ways of doing
things. The concentration and energies of many
people living together, along with the pooling of
ideas and a larger labor force, led to advances
in agriculture and animal domestication. A wider
variety of food sources (lentils, grapes, and olives)
and a broader range of domesticated animals soon
led to a transition from more nomadic hunter-
gatherer cultures to more sedentary settlement
patterns.
Over the ensuing centuries, life became more
complex as people congregated in urban enclaves.
A more stratified town life emerged in which pot-
ters, artisans, brick makers, weavers, and leather
workers encouraged a transformation in methods
of lawmaking. The convergence of several factors
in this region of Mesopotamia gave rise to one of
the greatest inventions in world history: writing. As
life became more complicated and complex, some
manner of record keeping was necessary to keep
track of temple stores and the contributions of the
citizens to the community (everyone was expected
to give their share to the gods; without writing,
people could lie and say that they had already con-
tributed). Without writing, the past and the future
were indistinguishable, and opportunities for shirk-
ing responsibilities and for theft were rampant.
Scribes invented writing in the fourth millen-
nium B.C. using reeds to inscribe pictographs or cu-
neiform on flattened clumps of clay. These earliest
forms of writing allowed not only record keeping
but also the promulgation of laws. The oldest ex-
tant literature of most ancient cultures is in the form
of laws written by scribes. In the earliest period,
laws were written codes issued at the request of a
royal authority. The legislation of ancient kings be-
came written history for future scholars who have
studied how the law was amended, expanded, and
handed down through the generations.
The Lawgivers
It has generally been accepted that the earliest writ-
ten law codes were produced in Babylonia (part of
Mesopotamia) in the ancient Near East. Hammurabi’s
code (ca. 1700
B.C.) is accepted as the only
substantially complete pre-Mosaic code of law.
Legislators frequently borrowed from the works of
other cultures, such as the Romans copying from
the Greeks. Although Hammurabi (ca. 1728–1686 B.C.)
is often credited with conceiving the first law
code, we now know that he borrowed extensively
from earlier rulers. In the 1940s, archaeologists un-
covered clay tabletsinIraq thatpredated Hammurabi’s
by perhaps several hundred years. Both law codes
share a high proportion of technical phrases,

leading some legal historians to the conclusion that
Hammurabi was influenced by earlier administra-
tors. Regardless, these laws have a familiar ring to
them, dealing as they do with divorce, matrimony,
savage dogs, and personal injury.
Hammurabi’s code, uncovered by French ar-
chaeologists in 1901–1902, consists of 4,000 lines of
laws inscribed on an 8-foot-high slab of black stone.
At the top of the stone, the king is depicted looking on
the sun god with adulation as authority isconferred on
Hammurabi.Thisancientcode containsboth civil and
criminal law, regulating virtually every aspect of his
subjects’ lives. More complex and comprehensive
than any law code previously attempted, Hammurabi’s
code is considered the apogee of legal codification
prior to Roman law. Much better organized and
comprehensive than biblical law, the code took a lit-
eral view of accountability and introduced the law of
retaliation, as in lex talionis. There were no ambigui-
ties, anditdid not take into account that circumstances
change with the times. The world was viewed as part
of a fixed, divine order; hence, the code was rigid and
reflected absolute justice. For instance, if an architect
built a structure that collapsed because of poor design
and killed a client, the architect could be executed. In
a similar manner, surgeons were responsible for the
health of their patients. If it was determined that sur-
gery led to the death of a patient, the surgeon could
have his hand amputated.
Although Hammurabi’s code is credited with
attempting to protect the disenfranchised from the
power of the elite, no thought was given to ending
slavery or granting women equal rights. Men could
divorce at will, but women had to prove they lived
a blameless life before being allowed to do the
same. If after petitioning for divorce her neighbors
denounced her, she could be drowned in a river, a
common method of execution in a land of rivers.
Crime and Punishment
What is most striking about this law code is the
distinction of punishments by class; punishment
varied according to the social status of the victim
and the perpetrator. If the daughter of a gentleman
was struck and suffered a miscarriage, the fine was
10 shekels. However, if the daughter of an ordinary
citizen was injured, the fine would only be five
shekels. In like fashion, if the ordinary citizen’s
daughter died, the perpetrator was liable for a fine;
if it was the gentleman’s daughter, the wrongdoer
could face execution.
Several ingredients of Hammurabi’s code bear
little resemblance to contemporary law. Besides the
variation of punishment according to class, this an-
cient code relied on trial by ordeal in cases involv-
ing irreconcilable conflict in sworn evidence. In
such cases, a judge could order the accused to
jump in a river. If the individual swore falsely to
the gods, it was assumed that the deities would en-
sure that the accused drowned. In the event that the
accused survived, the accuser was liable to be put to
death. This caveat was meant to discourage false
testimony.
The laws of Hammurabi introduced the world
to the philosophy of lex talionis, a concept that
would reappear later in the Old Testament. This
code is extremely inflexible and took a literal
view of accountability. Law was absolute and in
most respects a rich man’s law, but to read these
laws is to gain intriguing insight into the life of
the ordinary people of the ancient Near East.
While we know little about the courts and
procedures preceding punishments, the codes pre-
scribe execution by drowning for crimes including
adultery, incest with a daughter-in-law, and cheating
customers by watering down alcoholic beverages.
Impalement was sanctioned for any woman who
procured the death of her husband for the sake of
her lover or for one who procured an abortion. In-
dividuals caught looting during fires could be cast
into the flames. When it came to capital punishment,
Hammurabi’s code was at its most merciless. The
punishment of burning could also be used against a
priestess who ceased to live in a cloister and began
frequenting inns or a man who committed incest
with his mother after the death of his father. Why
burning for such obvious moral taboos? Perhaps this
concept adheres to the notion of fire as a form of
purification or is an attempt to avoid shedding tribal
blood.

Mutilation
was
not
uncommon
under
Hammurabi’s code, with the amputation of hands
prescribed for four offenses, ears for two different
infractions, and even the removal of ears, breasts,
and eyes for certain penalties. Babylonian punish-
ments were severe and cruel, with death often in-
flicted and mutilations usual. For the student of
history, it would be erroneous to assume that pun-
ishment could be no more cruel, as it has been only
a few centuries since European executioners super-
vised the boiling of prisoners alive and the hanging,
quartering,
and
disemboweling
of
political
offenders.
Since Hammurabi codified the law some 4,000
years ago, most societies have relied on legal prin-
ciples to arbitrate between conflicting parties.
Without a system of equitable laws, humanity
could not transcend its primitive roots and maintain
social order. By codifying both criminal and civil
laws and creating specific penalties for breaking
these tenets, for the first time in recorded history
a connection was established between crime and its
retribution.
M OSAIC LAW
There are many striking parallels between the laws
of Hammurabi and the Old Testament, which have
been traditionally ascribed to the Jewish prophet
Moses.3 Whatever the Old Testament might have
borrowed from Babylonian code, it is uncontestable
that the biblical law code was something uniquely
different from anything that occurred before. While
this legal system does not stand in the pantheon of
the great legal systems of the ancient world, its im-
portance lies in its intrinsic connection with the
national religion and its later relationship with
the Christian religion. Committed to the elimina-
tion of class distinctions, it contrasted sharply with
Hammurabi’s code by repudiating the notion of a
rich man’s law and applying a uniform moral stan-
dard applicable to all people. On the other hand,
Hammurabi’s legislation was much more orderly
and comprehensive than biblical laws.
Mosaic law, or the “Law of Moses,” can be
found in the first five books of the Bible and Old
Testament (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
and Deuteronomy). Known as the Torah to the
Jewish people, the ancient Greeks referred to this
part of the Bible as the Pentateuch, which means
“five books” in Greek. The first five books of the
Bible contain the Ten Commandments,4 which are
considered the foundation of law systems through-
out much of the Western world.
The Ten Commandments
1. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
2. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in
vain.
3. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or
anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the
earth beneath, or that is in the water under the
earth. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor
serve them.
4. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.
5. Honor thy father and thy mother.
6. Thou shalt not kill.
7. Thou shalt not commit adultery.
8. Thou shalt not steal.
9. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbor.
10.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou
shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his manser-
vant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor
anything that is thy neighbor’s.
Hebrew law evolved through discourse be-
tween the learned elders. Unlike Hammurabi’s
code, the Hebrew law code is not accredited to
one particular individual since, according to the
biblical concept, law is no more than a statement
of God’s will. Therefore, crime became equated
with sin since every criminal offense can be consid-
ered a crime against God.
Although the Mosaic code is rich in detail con-
cerning the customs and moral obligations of the
Jewish people—describing religious conventions
such as feasting and fasting and health and sanita-
tion—for the criminal justice scholar the Bible
offers extraordinary insight into the punishment of
criminal behavior in the ancient world. The book
of Exodus proclaims, “Eye for eye, tooth for tooth,
6

hand for hand, foot for foot.” While this is some-
times misconstrued to be taken literally, a more
appropriate interpretation suggests that there is a
set limit for punishment—that a perpetrator can
be punished up to losing an eye, a tooth, a hand,
or a foot for a particular offense. This is one of the
oldest legal concepts and can be found in various
incarnations in criminal codes throughout the
world. There is a remarkable similarity between
the Mosaic code and that of Hammurabi in the
literal interpretation of punishment. Similar to the
Mosaic code, Babylonian law asserted that a “son
was forfeited for son, daughter for daughter, eye for
eye, limb for limb, tooth for tooth, life for life and
slave for slave.”
According to the Old Testament, legal proce-
dures seemed relatively simple. Plaintiff and defen-
dant appeared before a judge, elder, or other
authority figures sitting in the open near the main
“gate of the city,” and a complaint was made. The
courts relied on witnesses to swing decisions either
way. Unlike most legal traditions, including present
ones, two witnesses were required to prove any
capital crime; therefore, a defendant could not be
put to death because of the testimony of only one
witness.
Crime and Punishment
The Bible offers a fascinating array of criminal be-
havior, including the world’s “first recorded mur-
der,” when Cain slew his brother Abel. God
sentenced Cain not to death but to life as a “fugitive
and vagabond on earth.” The story of Cain and
Abel would be used by generations of modern legal
experts to defend alleged murderers against the
death penalty during court trials. Under ancient
Israeli law, murder was differentiated from man-
slaughter, a distinction that exists in the criminal
law of the present day.
Murder conducted with malice aforethought,
like contemporary first-degree murder, was met
with capital punishment. Unlike instances of mur-
der,
which
mandated
death,
those
guilty
of
manslaughter were permitted to take sanctuary in
cities of refuge. Prohibitions against taking a life
were typically lifted in incidents involving self-
defense, warfare, and capital punishment. Decapita-
tion was regarded as the quickest and cleanest form of
execution and was applied in cases of murder afore-
thought and apostasy. Banishment was meted out
only in crimes of unintentional homicide or man-
slaughter. In these cases, the defendant was expelled
from his hometown to six specific cities of refuge.

In sharp contrast to Hammurabi’s code, under
Mosaic law, property offenses did not constitute a
capital crime; rather, such crimes were adjudicated
through the payment of fines. Since human life was
considered sacred and precious because humans were
made in God’s image, the Mosaic code was far more
humane than previous law codes. While parts of the
ancient Near East prescribed fierce physical punish-
ments, such as facial mutilation, castration, and
impalement, Mosaic law treated the body with re-
spect, and physical cruelty was reduced to a mini-
mum, with even flogging limited to 40 lashes.
The Bible enumerates 36 capital crimes,5 with
stoning the most frequent method of execution.
Men and women received the same punishment,
as did the rich and the poor. Stoning was imposed
for crimes that threatened the whole nation, includ-
ing sexual crimes.

Stoning in the 21st Century
Stoning, or lapidation, is still used as a method of execu-
tion in some corners of the world where religious law
predominates. Stoning requires a prisoner to be buried
up to the waist if male or the shoulders if female. They
are then pelted with stones by a small crowd of volun-
teers until dead. Religious courts usually expect the
stones to be small enough so that death will not occur
from only several blows, but must be big enough to
inflict physical harm. This extremely painful form of
execution can last between 10 and 20 minutes. In the
twenty-first century women have been sentenced to
death by stoning for adultery by Islamic courts in a
handful of majority Muslim countries, including Somalia,
Iran, and Nigeria. Women are most likely to face this
punishment and are more likely than men to face unfair
trials. They are more vulnerable, in part, because they are
most likely to be illiterate and thus be more likely to sign
confessions for crimes they were innocent of committing.
As recently as July 2007 a man and woman were stoned
to death for adultery, despite an existing moratorium
against it. In 2008 the Iranian judiciary said it planned to
stop using stoning as a form of punishment, but it would
keep it on the books as a legal form of punishment.
Adultery is considered the second most serious crime
under Islamic law (the first being insulting Allah). Adultery
is considered more serious than murder because “society is
injured,” and this act “will teach other people to do the
same thing.”6 According to tradition, a stoning is carried
out by digging a pit and burying the woman up to her
neck (or up to his waist, if a man) before being stoned to
death. According to a 2009 Pew survey, 83% of Pakistanis
believed adulterers should be stoned to death. In October
2008 a young Somalian girl was buried up to her neck and
stoned to death for adultery in a stadium in front of 1,000
witnesses. Amnesty International later claimed the girl was
only 13 years old and had been raped by three men.
The Mosaic code was more strict in sexual mat-
ters, as were most other divinely inspired codes. Prior
to Mosaiclaw,bestiality,adultery, and incest were not
considered criminal offenses; however, under Mosaic
law, all forms of irregular sex were prohibited. In cases
of incest and adultery,a malefactor would be strangled
and, while in his death throes, a burning torch would
be thrust into his mouth to “burn his intestines.” This
was seen asa more humane and dignified death since it
preserved the appearance of the body for burial.
Mosaic law has been credited with introducing
the foundations for the modern rule of liability.
According to the “law of the goring ox,” if an
owner was aware that he possessed a dangerous an-
imal before it caused damage or injury, the owner
was culpable and must pay compensatory damages.
If the ox killed a man, the ox and its owner could
be stoned to death. Obviously, this departs some-
what from contemporary liable law, which would
not demand the death penalty for negligence.
Lessons from Mosaic Law for the 21st Century
The high-profile dog-mauling death of Diane Whipple in
the hallway of her San Francisco apartment building in
2001 led a grand jury to charge two defendants with
second-degree murder. This was only the third time in
U.S. history that anyone was convicted of murder due to
the actions of their dog. Evidence suggests that massive
dogs owned by the victim’s neighbors fatally attacked her
as she was entering her own apartment. During the trial
evidence showed that owner Marjorie Knoller had been
warned previously by an experienced veterinarian that
her dogs were dangerous while others testified that the
dogs had threatened people numerous times before. In
2002 Knoller was convicted of second-degree murder be-
cause she knew the dogs were aggressive to other peo-
ple. However, this was later overturned on appeal for a
lesser, involuntary manslaughter conviction. She served
3 years of a 4-year sentence in prison before being released
on good behavior (Knoller’s co-defendant, who was not
present at the attack, was convicted of involuntary man-
slaughter and served 3 years in prison). In 2007 California’s
state Supreme Court ruled that the judge who over-
turned the original conviction had erred by applying the
wrong standard to the case, and a new hearing was or-
dered to decide whether the original second-degree
murder conviction was the appropriate one. On Septem-
ber 22, 2008, the defendant’s original conviction for
second-degree murder was reinstated and the court sen-
tenced Knoller to 15 years in prison for the death. Legal
scholars assert that the conviction of the defendants
will encourage prosecutors to file similar charges when
defendants demonstrate a disregard for public safety.
Harking back to Mosaic Law, prosecutors in this case have
upheld the right to punish individuals who disregard
public safety when it came to owning dangerous animals.
One law professor warns that this sensational case will
“remind prosecutors and jurors that it might be appro-
priate in other cases,” such as “deadly industrial accidents,
product liability, and drunk-driving cases.” While one
prosecutor argues that “in most dog maulings you’re
not going to be able to prove murder or manslaughter,”
there is little doubt that dog owners could now face
prison and civil penalties if their pets kill.7

While other cultures from the ancient Near
East gave the world the wheel, cuneiform writing,
and irrigation, the Jews gave the world monotheis-
tic religion—the belief in one God—and in the
process gave to the world a more compassionate
vision of the world. Although the Mosaic code is
considered less advanced than that of Hammurabi,
it was much more humanitarian in spirit. Unlike
Hammurabi’s code, which was inspired by a king,
the Mosaic code was inspired by a belief in God and
is more people oriented.
The ancient Jewish law code later influenced
the development of several future legal systems.
For
example,
the
Puritan
communities
of
seventeenth-century New England based their law
codes almost entirely on biblical law. Over the cen-
turies, the precepts of the Old Testament have also
influenced the development of law codes in conti-
nental Europe and England. The impact of the Ten
Commandments continues to resonate into the
twenty-first
century,
bringing
into
question
whether its display promotes one religion above
others.
According
to
Chief
Justice
William
Rehnquist, it is not a matter of religion but “simply
reflects the Ten Commandments’ role in the devel-
opment of our legal system.” However, one oppo-
nent contends that “public buildings should display
patriotic symbols that bring us together, not reli-
gious symbols that divide us.”8
In February 2002, the Supreme Court, for the
second time that year, refused to review a lower
court’s ban on displaying the Ten Commandments
on government property. In this case, the justices
declined to hear an appeal by Indiana’s governor,
who had been prevented from placing a 7-foot
stone monument of the Ten Commandments on
the statehouse lawn in Indianapolis (it would have
replaced one that had been previously vandalized).
It was hoped that the court would resolve this
murky issue since there is little consensus. While
judges in Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin have pro-
hibited the display of the Ten Commandments on
public property, judges in Oklahoma, New Mexico,
Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming, and Utah have
allowed it.
TheU.S.Supreme Court and theTen Commandments
In 2005 the U.S. Supreme Court handed down two dif-
ferent 5–4 decisions related to the displaying of the Ten
Commandments. In the Kentucky ruling the majority ru-
led that public displays of two framed documents of the
Ten Commandments in two courthouses violated the Es-
tablishment Clause of the First Amendment that is the
foundation of the principle of separation of church and
state. In the Texas case, the Court ruled in favor of al-
lowing a 6-foot-high granite copy of the Ten Command-
ments that had been donated in 1961 to remain in place
among several dozen other monuments spread across the
front of the state capitol in Texas.
ANCIENT GREECE
Greek civilization did not invent or originate the
notion of law, but the Greek law that would
emerge in the seventh century B.C. differed from
the earlier Mosaic and Near Eastern law codes in
several respects. It was not intended to carry out the
will of an omnipotent king, such as Hammurabi, or
the will of God, as in the Mosaic code. Rather, the
goal was to improve the lives of ordinary human
beings. Earlier law codes could be modified at the
will of a king or priest, but Greek law, particularly
in Athens, was based on some kind of referendum
of popular consent and could be changed only with
the approval of the people.
Out of the dozens of Greek city-states that made
up the ancient Greek civilization, most historical ru-
minations focus on the city-states of Athens and
Sparta. But Athens looms large and has, for the
most part, become synonymous with Greece in the
ancient world. While Athens was dedicated to poli-
tics, entrepreneurship, and the arts, Sparta could best
be compared to a military enclave, with the con-
comitant suppression of nonconformity and individ-
ual rights. Life in Sparta was tightly regulated, and
criminal procedure tended to be inquisitorial in
nature. With a subjugated populace, ruled by cus-
tomary law and institutions, the Spartans contributed
little to the evolution of the criminal justice system.

Unlike the martial law of the Spartans, Athenians
reveled in their political freedom in the absence of
dictatorship. Unlike the divinely influenced Mosaic
law or the royally dictated Babylonian code, Greek
law developed into the consensus of the people.
The Lawgivers
Prior to the introduction of writing, Athenian law
and the administration of justice remained in the
hands of an oligarchy, and each generation orally
handed down the unwritten law codes. Over
time, the underclasses demanded that the laws be
recorded so that they would be known by all rather
than being confined as the province of the well-
born elite members of society.
The first written law code of Greek civilization is
credited to the statesman Draco, who is considered
the first legislator of Athens. Commissioned to write a
new law code in 621 B.C. to control the masses and to
eliminate blood feuds fueled by revenge, Draco at-
tempted to suppress crime by imposing capital pun-
ishment for virtually every offense. Hence, Draco’s
name hasbecome linked inperpetuity to ruthlessness,
or draconian punishment. Citizens could be sen-
tenced to death for stealing certain vegetables and
fruit and for sacrilege, idleness, and homicide. Draco
also supported the enslaving of debtors and even their
families when they could not pay creditors. Draco’s
accomplishments are mixed from a modern vantage
point. While citizens became better informed about
legal procedures and protocol and forms of compen-
sation were introduced to end the age-old cycle of
private revenge, capital punishment was used for a
wider range of crimes. In actuality, the Draconian
code was no worse than customary law, but it was
criticized by Athenians who were disappointed that
there was no radical change in the legal system. Be-
fore passing judgment on this ancient Athenian legis-
lator, one should remember that he did not invent
these laws but simply collected and recorded the cus-
tomary laws that had been unwritten until this time.
But once they were recorded, Athenians could
no longer ignore the need to reform such a harsh
law code.
With the introduction of Draco’s code, Greece
made the transition from the preliterate era of cus-
tomary law to written code. Greek legal develop-
ments made important strides during this era. The
laws recorded by Draco (and later Solon) were pub-
lished on pillars of wood for religious matters and
on bronze for other types of laws.
Although no fragments of Draco’s code have
survived, information pertaining to the laws has
been passed down to us from the early Greek histori-
ans. Criminal and civil law were apparently not dis-
tinct. However, Draco’s code is notable for its views
on homicide. Draco’s most important innovation
was the establishment of the Court of Areopagus
for murder cases, arson, and other serious crimes.
Many scholars consider this the first time a distinction
was made between civil and criminal law.
Since time immemorial, any killing was fol-
lowed by revenge killings. To avoid revenge kill-
ings and blood feuds under Draconian law, a
murderer had three choices: acknowledge complic-
ity by immediately going into exile; submit to trial
and walk free until then, as long as he obeyed rules
excluding him from most sacred and public places;
or, if he decided to ignore the trial process, he
could be killed or immediately arrested on entering
a public or sacred place by any Athenian, which was
an early form of citizen’s arrest.
Draco introduced radically different rules in
dealing with homicide. There were voluntary, “im-
passioned” killings committed in the heat of the
moment, and there were involuntary or accidental
ones. Justifiable homicides included accidental kill-
ings during athletic contests, the slaying of adulterers
caught flagrante delicto, and killings committed in
war. Offenders were eligible for the death penalty
only in cases of voluntary or premeditated homicide.
All others were punished by exile. These distinctions
are significant because they mandated that only the
state now had the authority to kill, eliminating the
traditional blood vengeance. The state also allowed
the victim’s family to trade the perpetrator’s punish-
ment sentence for a fine or material compensation.9
Following in the footsteps of Draco, Solon
built on his predecessor’s achievements. Like Draco,
little is known about Solon. Born into a prosperous

Athenian family in 638 B.C., Solon developed a
reputation for honesty and equitable judgment.
After several decades of Draco’s code, demands in-
creased for a new law code. Solon was appointed to
a 1-year term as chief magistrate in 594 B.C. and was
granted the power to rewrite the law for Athenian
society.
Although it is unsubstantiated, many historians
accord Solon the distinction of having created the
first permanent protocol for punishing crimes
against the state. A zealous proponent of the rule
of law, Solon saw lawlessness as the scourge of state
building and insisted that only by punishing crimes
such as theft or embezzlement of public funds, se-
dition, civil disorder, enslavement of the disenfran-
chised, and political conspiracies could the rule of
law progress. As a legal reformer, Solon is credited
with taking steps to protect the marginalized popu-
lation from the upper classes. Among his most
noteworthy reforms was the prohibition of selling
debtors and their families into slavery for failure to
pay creditors. In addition, he proclaimed that all
Athenians who had been sold into slavery or had
fled Athens to avoid this fate could return to their
former status as Athenian citizens.
Perhaps his greatest accomplishment, Solon’s
abolition of Draco’s penal code set the stage for a
much more humane criminal law as he endeavored
to make the punishment fit the crime. Contrasted
with Draco’s code, Solon’s law allowed for capital
punishment only for treason and murder. However,
his law protected a husband who killed his wife and
her lover when caught in the act of adultery. In
addition, he opened up jury service to average ci-
tizens. Solon’s law reforms would last for 500 years.
Although we have only a partial list of his laws, his
reforms were much discussed by chroniclers of the
ancient world. Solon’s democratic conception of
justice influenced not only Athens but the develop-
ment of Western society as well.
The importance of Solonic law rested on the
presumption that law was the will of the people or
the state and therefore could be amended. Addi-
tionally, Solon stipulated that anyone could prose-
cute an injustice. These principles became the
foundation for the future greatness of Athens. By
establishing popular assemblies and a comprehen-
sive code of laws, Solon created the environment
that would allow democracy to later flourish.
Claiming no divine origin, Solon’s law stood as a
testament to the power of human reason. But there
was still much to be accomplished. Without distinc-
tion between felonies and misdemeanors and little
classification of crime according to severity of pen-
alties involved, this system of criminal justice must
still be regarded as fairly primitive.
Crime and Punishment
The Greeks were at their most pragmatic when it
came to capital punishment. While they recognized
that human nature was not deterred by fear of
death, at the same time philosophers such as Plato
viewed capital punishment as a form of civic
purging—removing the most dangerous criminals
from society to protect the state. Many Athenians
would attest that banishment for life, not unlike life
in prison, was a fate worse than death.
Death sentences were carried out in a variety of
ways. At its earliest stages, stoning, or lapidation,
was used as a form of community punishment,
much in the manner of the ancient Israelites. This
custom developed over the centuries into a more
formal mode of punishment. The main principle
behind stoning was that rather than one or a few
individuals being responsible, the whole commu-
nity should take part to remove guilt. Athenians
did not consider stoning a legal means of execution
during its historical era, but it was used in other
regions of Greece. Typically, only crimes that af-
fected the general welfare of the community were
treated in this manner. These crimes included the
murder of a king, sacrilege, and treason. Stoning
was usually conducted outside the city so as to
not injure passersby.
The ancient Greeks also developed the practice
of precipitation, or throwing individuals from a
high cliff to their deaths. This method seems to
have religious origins; spiritual services were often
conducted at high places where individuals were
closer to the gods. According to some sources,

this penalty is a form of the ordeal since there is a
chance a person could survive the fall. In addition,
the executioner is not directly shedding tribal blood
in the tradition of a headsman or hangman. As law
became more formalized in Greece, an excavation
site known as the Barathron became the place of
execution. This practice apparently ended by the
fifth century B.C. since it is not mentioned after this
date.
In addition to stoning and the Barathron, stran-
gulation and hemlock were also used to punish cap-
ital crimes. The introduction of hemlock marked
the transition to the most humane phase of capital
punishment in Athens. In the ancient world, “hem-
lock” was known as “cicuta.” The Anglo-Saxons
introduced hemlock into the Old English vocabulary
in the tenth century.
Although hemlock was most famous for its use
as a poison, it was also used externally as an aphro-
disiac. Hemlock is a juice made from the pounding
of the plant’s seeds and leaves in a mortar. The
poison worked only when a patient or perpetrator
had a normal body temperature. Before Socrates
took his fatal dose in 399 B.C., he was told to avoid
becoming too agitated as he was prone to do be-
cause it would negate the effects of the poison. In
the end, Socrates requested multiple doses of the
potion. Death usually was accompanied by spasms
and convulsions, but like lethal injection today, it
was considered a civilized alternative to shedding
blood.
Most death sentences in ancient Athens were
carried out with haste. Some Greek philosophers
complained that typically only one day transpired
between sentence and execution. There were only
two circumstances that could postpone an execu-
tion: pregnant women could be granted a reprieve
until a baby was delivered, and no one could be put
to death until the return of the ship that the
Athenians sent annually on a religious mission to
Delos. And unlike Sparta, which conducted its
executions at night, most were typically carried
out during the day in Athens.
Patriotism was considered of supreme impor-
tance, and any crime directed against the state called
for the maximum penalty. Traitors were executed,
and their property was confiscated by the state.
Treason came in a variety of incarnations: Betrayal
of a fortress, selling supplies, or passing information
to the enemy all demanded the death penalty.
Next to treason, impiety was considered the
next-greatest crime. Destruction of statues of the
gods, robbing temples, and practicing magic were
treated with utmost severity. The Athenian con-
ception of filial duty brooked no mistreatment of
parents, and the death penalty could be inflicted on
children who assaulted their parents.
The ancient Greeks were notably less stern in
their punishment of what we would regard as moral
infractions. Adulterers caught in the act by an ag-
grieved husband could be killed with impunity.
This tradition can be traced as far back as Draco’s
code, which proclaimed that “if one man kills an-
other after catching him with his wife … he shall
not go into exile for homicide on such account.”
However, the plaintiff also had the liberty to choose
between
personal
vengeance
or
monetary
compensation.
Athens recognized a variety of punishments,
ranging from fines and the confiscation of property
to public shaming and the destruction of the homes
of condemned offenders. There is some evidence
that suggests that Athenians utilized imprisonment
to punish debtors and to hold those waiting for
torture or execution, as in the case of Socrates
(see “Notable Trials” later in this chapter). In
Athens, there was even a prison called the desmoter-
ion, or “place of chains.”
Accountability in the Land of the Bible
One common but controversial tactic used by Israeli De-
fense Forces during the intifadas in contemporary Israel
was to destroy the homes of Palestinian suicide bombers
and others in retaliation for terrorist actions. These
actions were often taken almost immediately after a
terrorist action without any judicial proceedings.
Solon introduced the first jury courts to
Athens. Not everyone could plead his or her case
before a jury court. Only free male citizens of full
Athenian parentage on both sides of the family
were allowed to address the courts. Foreigners

were tried before special courts, slaves could not
testify at all, and women were represented by a
male relative. Judicial procedure for most crimes
except for homicide relied on juries ranging in
size from 201 to 2,501 jurors, depending on the
importance of the case. Jurors were required to be
over 30 years old. This system did not use lawyers,
allowing the plaintiff and the defendant to handle
their own cases and to cross-examine each other
but not witnesses. Following the speeches of the
contestants, jurors cast their votes in the courtroom.
Each juror was given two discs: perforated for con-
viction and solid for acquittal. Jurors reportedly
would hold the discs so as to obscure them from
fellow jurors. The discs were then collected and
tallied by a presiding officer.
There is fragmentary evidence that indicates
that Athens had a form of institutional police
known
as the
Scythian
archers.
Scythian—or
“northern barbarian”—these trouser-wearing po-
licemen were essentially captured warriors who
were kept at the status of slave until earning free-
dom. Billeted in tents, the Scythians served as town
guards and ushers in the Assembly and carried out
routine police duties on the main roads leading into
Athens. Although there are sporadic mentions of
this unit in Greek historical records, little is known
about their powers and protocol.
ROMAN LAW
No ancient culture could match the achievements
of the Romans when it came to the development
of law. Today’s civil law tradition is based on
Roman law and is considered the oldest legal tradi-
tion in the world. Countries as diverse as Spain,
France, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, and Yugoslavia
trace their legal codes to ancient Roman law code.
The history of Rome, from its founding in 753
B.C. until the sixth century B.C., is obscured by
myth and fable. Early Roman law was based on
unwritten customs and the will of the gods.
Romans, like the Greeks before them, were super-
stitious, and their gods and goddesses were based on
Greek deities. The Romans borrowed liberally
from Greek culture in virtually every feature of
their art, culture, and national life, and like the
Athenians, the aristocracy abused its power over
the lower classes in Rome. Aggravating class ten-
sions between the patricians and plebeians was the
absence of a written law code. Civil unrest and
dissension led the Romans to follow in the steps
of Solon when they realized that adopting a written
law would be the only safeguard against oppression.
As long as judges were the only individuals familiar
with the law and penalties for crime, they could
inflict injustices without detection.
The Lawgivers
While Solon was restructuring the laws of Athens
(594
B.C.), Roman kings were expanding their
mandate in both the commercial and military
realms. During the next century, Romans freed
themselves from the clutches of absolute power and
began experimenting with a republican form of gov-
ernment, necessitating a new law code. In 509 B.C.,
the age of the Roman kings had ended. During the
subsequent years of the Republic, Rome was led by
two magistrates, better known as consuls. It was dur-
ing the period of the Republic (509 B.C.– A.D. 4) that
the Roman Empire expanded throughout much of
the known world.
The Twelve Tables, written in 451 B.C., are
considered the first written laws of Rome. It was
only when the underclasses, or plebeians, com-
plained about
the high-handed
oppression of
Roman officials that the law was codified. A
commission of patricians was reportedly dispatched
to Athens to absorb the laws of Solon and become
familiar with the institutions, customs, and laws of
the Greek city state. On their return to Rome, 10
men, or decemviri, were appointed to fashion a
new body of law. These laws would be certain
and definite and accessible to everyone. Subse-
quently, the Twelve Tables were drafted and in-
scribed on twelve wood or brass tablets that were
then set on display in the Roman Forum, where
anyone could become familiar with the law.10
The Twelve Tables was primitive and inadequate
by modern standards, but its impact on the Roman

peoples cannot be overestimated. Not only did ev-
ery young Roman schoolchild reportedly learn the
laws by heart, but the laws are recognized for bring-
ing together the plebeian and patrician classes and
eliminating social distinctions that formerly cleaved
Rome into two hostile camps. The Twelve Tables
was credited with eventually breaking down one of
the last social barriers, namely, the intermarriage
between the two classes.
Unfortunately, we only have fragmentary evi-
dence concerning the actual language of the origi-
nal laws passed down to us by the classical
historians. However, it is clear that they were in-
tended to be not a comprehensive law code but
rather a compilation of laws that could be abused
by unethical judges if the citizens were not properly
informed of the law. These laws dealt mainly with
private disputes among individuals. Even such
transgressions against the state as abetting an enemy
of Rome or accepting bribes were considered mat-
ters to be prosecuted privately before an assembly of
citizens.
The drafting of the Twelve Tables was a semi-
nal event in the history of criminal justice proce-
dure. During the subsequent centuries, these laws
were carried into almost every nation of the ancient
world by the victorious Roman legions. Roman
reverence for the Twelve Tables can only be com-
pared to the English respect for the Magna Carta.
Unlike the Ten Commandments, this primitive law
code was not a moral code but rather was com-
posed of legal customs borrowed from other cul-
tures to arbitrate disputes between Rome’s various
classes.
Roman law was developed through the pro-
mulgation of edicts, interpretations of the law by
jurists, and the issuance of statutes. The era of the
Roman Republic (500 B.C.–A.D. 4) witnessed the
expansion of the Roman Empire as well as the evo-
lution of a distinct legal profession. However, the
greatest strides in the development of Roman legal
culture would take place in the eastern Roman
Empire under the Christian emperors. Emperor
Constantine’s conversion to Christianity in
A.D.
312 was a turning point not only in the history of
the Roman Empire but in Western civilization as
well. Christians had been persecuted since the reign
of Nero, but despite numerous obstacles, the reli-
gion continued to gain converts among all segments
of society. With the economic decline of the em-
pire in Western Europe, Constantine built a new
capital in the eastern part of the empire at Constan-
tinople11
(formerly
Byzantium,
now
Istanbul,
Turkey). While Rome declined in the West and
was overrun by barbarian hordes in the fifth cen-
tury, its greatness persisted for more than another
millennium in the East. Roman civilization influ-
enced the language, architecture, and literature of
the modern world but was even more influential in
its contributions to law.
Initially, church law had little impact on
Roman law outside of protecting the faith. But fol-
lowing Constantine’s conversion, virtually every
emperor would be Christian as well. In A.D. 325,
church leaders from throughout the Roman Empire
met for the first time to resolve disputes concerning
church protocol and to settle points of church disci-
pline. By settling such disputes as whether clergy
could migrate without the permission of a bishop,
the Council of Nicaea created peace in the church,
at least for the time being.
The development of Roman law reached its
zenith under the direction of Emperor Justinian
(483–565). The product of over 1,000 years of ju-
ristic experimentation, the codification of earlier
Roman law and its compilation during the reign
of Justinian stands as one of the benchmarks of
Roman civilization. Not only did he bring simplic-
ity and equity to Roman law, but Justinian saw the
need to reduce the amount of laws and to arrange
them in some manageable form.
Justinian’s reign from 518 to 565 marks the
transition from the ancient world to a medieval12
one, ushering in an era that would witness the de-
velopment of modern Europe. Subsequent devel-
opments of social and religious institutions as well as
in literature and law were shaped by Roman ante-
cedents. Shortly after becoming emperor, Justinian
entrusted the distinguished lawyer Tribonian with
supervising the compilation and revision of the
Roman law codes. These included not only all the
edicts of previous emperors but also previous Senate

statutes. Justinian added so many statutes himself in
the intervening years that the final product issued in
534 became known as the Code of Justinian. Under
the supervision of Tribonian, Roman law was sim-
plified, particularly in situations concerning property
and inheritance. This was necessary to eliminate the
impact of ancient customs and the power of the ex-
tended family in property matters.
Tribonian also was charged with condensing
and revising more than three million lines of judi-
cial decisions into a more usable form. After elimi-
nating obsolete and contradictory laws, in 533 the
Digest was completed, having distilled all previous
judicial decisions into a mere 150,000 lines (about
one and a half times the size of the Bible). Justi-
nian’s final contribution to the updating of Roman
law was twofold: Besides bringing the law closer to
the teachings of the Christian church, in 533 the
Institutes was published. With its publication, all
other law books, including the Twelve Tables,
were officially obsolete. As a law textbook, the In-
stitutes was designed to help law students digest the
changes in the legal code. Combined, the Code,
Digest, and Institutes have become known as the
Corpus
Juris
Civilis,13
a
singular
achievement.
Rather than a set of completely new laws, this re-
vision of existing law would endure, and as
Europeans moved out of the Dark Ages, they
would turn to this work for guidance in creating
a new legal system.
Crime and Punishment
At its zenith, ancient Rome was considered a lawless
city of between 750,000 and one million people.
Without a police force, public prosecutors, or sher-
iffs, crime went unchecked during the last century of
the Roman Republic. One Roman satirist warned
that “only a fool would go out to dinner without
having made his will.” Robberies and house break-
ins were common, and gangs of street toughs roamed
the streets, giving the city the character of a town
from America’s Wild West era. Besides street crime,
political assassinations were a common mode of re-
placing prominent leaders, including such legendary
figures as Julius Caesar and the Gracci brothers.
The ascendance of Augustus Caesar to emperor
in 27 B.C. signaled the beginning of organized law
enforcement in the ancient world. In prior years,
the Roman army functioned as police in the far-
flung provinces. When crime was reported to a
governor, soldiers from local legions were sent out
to suppress the activity, but provincial policing ef-
forts were inadequate because of insufficient man-
power. With other nonpolicing duties, such as
building roads and forts, protecting the outlying
provinces was challenging for Rome’s peace-
keepers. In the Roman capital, there was little po-
lice presence other than a small number of
government-owned slaves who served in a constab-
ulary capacity. When Augustus took the throne in
27 B.C., he made police reform his first order of
business. He is credited with organizing a police
system comprised of three independent agencies.
The most respected agency was the elite Praetorian
Guard, composed of 4,500 soldiers replete with to-
gas and swords. Charged with keeping order and
the political peace, the Guard was commanded by
two police chiefs, or prefects.
To complement the peacekeepers, Augustus
established a civilian Urban Cohort to patrol
Rome during the daytime hours. Numbering
3,000 men and under the supervision of one pre-
fect, this constabulary group was recruited from the
military. The 7,000-man Vigiles patrolled the city
at night. Composed chiefly of freed slaves, they
were expected to fight fires as well as deal with
street crime. In a world made of wood, firefighting
became an inextricable link to policing and public
order. The Augustan system of policing proved so
efficient that it was adapted later in the fourth cen-
tury by the Christian emperor Constantine when
he built his capital of Constantinople in the eastern
Roman Empire.
It is apparent from archeological excavations and
historical accounts that the Romans belonged to a
materialistic culture that liked to acquire property
and show it off in public. Since togas had no pockets,
civilians carried their valuables in a pouch or purse.
Others stored precious possessions at home in strong-
boxes or in pagan temples where the gods could
watch
over
them.
Temples

construction and protected by outside guards, so ci-
tizens were confident that if temples did not dissuade
thieves, then the gods would ultimately punish them.
Having invented the padlock and other locking de-
vices, the Romans are credited with raising the sci-
ence of locksmithing to a level surpassed only in
modern times.
Although Roman law prohibited the display-
ing of most weapons, for self-protection Romans
wore finger rings that are considered the prototypes
for brass knuckles and eye gougers. Many became
proficient in self-defense skills, including boxing,
wrestling, kicking, and strangling. Others gravitated
toward protective associations (precursors of today’s
neighborhood watch groups) or hired bodyguards.
The more superstitious wore amulets of the gods
for protection that could range from minerals to
parts of the human or animal body. A common
charm worn by boys to ward off evil intentions
until puberty was the phallic symbol known as
the bulla. At home, individuals used dogs and geese
as watch animals or mounted animal emblems over
their doors to repel evil spirits. The progenitors of
many self-defense strategies, the Romans came up
with the idea of placing mannequins in their gar-
dens to ward off criminals. Modern law enforce-
ment has adopted similar schemes in crime-prone
locations when staffing is shorthanded.
During the early Republic, the Twelve Tables
prescribed definite penalties for certain crimes.
Hanging would be visited on those who pastured
animals at night in a neighbor’s crop, while male-
factors who deliberately set fire to a barn or a store
of grain could be burned alive. For crimes that
called for capital punishment, the method of exe-
cution was rarely left in doubt. Although some
penalties could be adjudicated through compensa-
tion, a host of criminal acts were met with the
death penalty. Perjury was punished by precipita-
tion, as perpetrators were tossed from the Tarpein
Cliff. Arsonists could expect to be burned to death,
crop thieves were hanged, and others met their
ends by being clubbed to death or hanged. Parri-
cides, or children who killed a parent—having
committed a crime considered to be one of the
most heinous by the Romans—were punished by
being bound into a sack with a dog, a cock, a viper,
and an ape and then being tossed into the water. As
primitive as this sounds, this special punishment
lived on into the Middle Ages. Regardless of the
method, executions were a public occasion, but
only when the convicted was male. Since victims
were stripped for the occasion, women were exe-
cuted in private to preserve their modesty.
By the end of the Roman Republic, capital
punishment for most crimes had gone out of vogue.
In most instances, convicts could instead accept an
informal agreement to go into exile, particularly if
they belonged to the elite class, but only with the
caveat that if they returned to Rome, they would
be executed. In ancient Rome (64 B.C.E.) a series of
dungeons, known as Mamertine Prison, housed of-
fenders in large caged rooms under Rome’s main
sewer. One of its lower chambers dates back almost
150 years earlier. There is a lack of consensus
whether Romans regularly recognized imprison-
ment as a penal sanction. Except for cases of debt,
imprisonment was rarely used in early Rome. Ac-
cording to the Twelve Tables, debtors who could
not or refused to pay their debts were held in pri-
vate confinement by creditors for 60 days. Subse-
quently, the debtor’s balance was announced in
public on three consecutive market days. On the
third and final day, the debtor might be sold into
slavery or executed. One other form of imprison-
ment is chronicled in which Roman male heads of
household were allowed to maintain a domestic
prison in which they could discipline household
members. Called the Ergastulum (or “garbage pit”),
the cell held immediate family members or slaves
for any breach of family discipline. The works of
later Roman historians describe other modes of im-
prisonment that ranged from chaining and quarry
prisons to underground chambers similar to the
prototypical dungeons of the Middle Ages.14
After Constantine’s conversion, there was a
trend toward increasingly severe punishments as
the government became more autocratic. Under
the Christian emperors, infractions that were for-
mally regarded as private wrongs became public of-
fenses and were often treated with inhuman rigor.
In the time of Augustus, adulterers would be

deported to separate islands. By the reign of Con-
stantine and his successors, sexual immorality was se-
verely punished, and the death penalty was prescribed
for adultery, incest, and homosexuality.
NOTABLE TRIALS
Socrates (399 B.C.)
The trial of the vagabond teacher and philosopher
Socrates in Athens in 399 B.C. remains one of the
most famous free-speech trials of all time. Charged
with corrupting the youth of Athens and refusing to
recognize the accepted divinities of the city by a
distinguished body of Athenian democrats, Socrates
went on trial for his life before the Court of the
Heliasts, the court that had jurisdiction over all
public cases that did not involve homicide.
Socrates rose to prominence as a brave warrior
during Athens’ war with Sparta (431–404 B.C.) and
then as an intellectual renowned for his insatiable
curiosity. The charges brought against Socrates can
be understood only in the context of ancient Athens.
The charge of “corrupting” youth referred to
Socrates’ inclination of teaching young people to
question the wisdom of their parents and the leaders
of Athens, a charge tantamount to treason. Several of
his former students were affiliated with the tyrannical
oligarchy that ruled Athens for a short period before
Athens returned to democratic rule in 403 B.C. To his
opponents, it appeared that Socrates had been edu-
cating traitors. A well-known philosopher whose
main mission in life seemed to question the wisdom
of the popularly elected leaders of Athens, Socrates’
political affiliations and his Sophist (identification as a
professional philosopher) leanings earned him ene-
mies who sought to remove him from society.
The administration of justice in the courts of
Socrates’ era bore little resemblance to contempo-
rary courts. Missing from the ancient courtroom
were the familiar actors of the modern courtroom.
In place of judges, prosecutors, and defense attor-
neys was a jury composed of anywhere from 101 to
more than 1,001 people. But there was always an
odd number to eliminate a tie vote.
Any full Athenian citizen who was sane, over
the age of 30, and not impaired by any disabilities
was qualified to become a member of the court.
At the beginning of each judicial year, citizens vo-
lunteered for jury participation, and about 6,000
were selected for that year. Each juror was
paid today’s equivalent of 9 cents per day. This
leads to speculation that only members of the lower
classes could be expected to participate for such
low pay.
Athenian courts heard cases on about 300 days
each year. To guard against bribery, each day juries
were selected by lot and assigned to various courts.
Traditionally, the more important the case, the
larger the jury. Not all defendants were given the
benefit of a jury trial. However, any Athenian citi-
zen with full rights could make charges against an
individual and have the case tried in the Court of
the Heliasts.
While there are no independent contemporary
accounts of the trial, we know many of the specifics
through the writings of his disciples such as Plato.
According to Plato and others, the jury hearing the
case of Socrates had 501 jurors. Over the centuries,
scholars have pieced together an account of the trial
of Socrates. In an open-air court, a low barrier par-
titioned the public from the defendant and the jury.
The prosecution presented its case first, followed by
the defense. Each side spoke and was allowed to
present its case for an hour, using a water clock as
a timing device. Unlike the modern courtroom,
there was no formal cross-examination.
The 70-year-old philosopher conducted his
own defense. Having never been to court before,
Socrates was at a disadvantage. He had to face not
only three prosecutors but also a clandestine group
of accusers who had vilified his reputation in Athens
for almost two decades. By the time the trial began,
public opinion had already turned against Socrates.
He became his own worst enemy as he delivered a
long speech, punctuated with wit and defiance; ulti-
mately all it did was antagonize his prosecutors.
Unlike contemporary juries, Athenian juries
voted twice. The first vote was whether to acquit
or convict. Socrates barely lost this vote, 280 to
220. The second vote was to decide a penalty if
F ROM C USTOMS TO CODES

the penalty was not prescribed by law. Under Athe-
nian law, the jury was allowed to decide a penalty
of its own and could choose between penalties pro-
posed by the prosecution and the defense. Socrates
could have avoided the death penalty if he had
proposed banishment. The jury most probably
would have accepted. Despite the urgings of his
friends to take this way out, Socrates insisted that
if he took exile, he would betray his beliefs and
would be admitting that the prosecution had spo-
ken the truth. He was willing to die for his convic-
tions and thus ended up facing a death sentence and
took a fatal dose of hemlock.
Socrates left no writings of his own, and had he
been acquitted, he might have vanished into obscu-
rity as a harmless Athenian eccentric. Having reached
the ripe old age of 70, Socrates went to his death in
Athens, a city famous for free speech, prosecuted for a
philosopher’s ideas and his use of free speech.
CONCLUSIONS
An examination of early law codes suggests that in
complex societies, everyone is immersed in a vast
network of legal rules. In more primitive societies,
individuals go about their daily lives unconscious of
most of these legal rules. A variety of legal docu-
ments have survived to offer students insight into
the legal institutions of ancient Mesopotamia, Israel,
and Greece. However, evidence abounds related to
Roman law. Unlike earlier societies, we have not
only legislation but also juristic commentaries of the
law, lay literature referring to the law, and docu-
ments of daily legal relationships.
Suffering from political, economic, and military
exhaustion, by the end of the fifth century the
western Roman Empire had capitulated to the inva-
sion of Germanic tribes. Still flourishing in the eastern
half of the empire, the Byzantine Empire would
not succumb until 1453. During the subsequent
Middle Ages, Roman law would be resurrected and
exert a lasting influence on the development of legal
institutions throughout continental Europe. Events
in England, including the early organization of a
national common law, later gave rise to a different
legal tradition.
Point–Counterpoint
Ancient Law Codes: God v. King
Inspired Law
Hammurabi’s Code stands out in sharp contrast to Mosaic
Code, in that it was written by a king as opposed to being
inspired by God. Hammurabi was the king of Babylonia in
the late eighteenth and early seventeenth century B.C. The
prologue to the code indicates that the king drafted the code by
the command of the gods. It was the king’s duty to proclaim
and enforce the law and to make sure law enforcement was
distributed equally. He was also imbued with the power to
make amendments to make the code current with the needs of
the day. Some of its provisions, including the disappearance
of blood feuds and revenge, indicate a semi-advanced condi-
tion. On the other hand, it still preserved vestiges of a more
primitive past, such as retaliatory punishments (an eye for an
eye), reliance on the ordeal (#2), and liability for accidental
harm. The following are excerpts taken from the 282 sec-
tions. Although Mosaic Law is often remembered for its
elucidation of the fundamental rules of social conduct con-
tained in the Ten Commandments, it also contained strict
punishments for ordinary as well as serious offenses. The
excerpts provided after the Code of Hammurabi examples
are from the Book of Exodus.

Execution of Jonathan Wild
When the Romans invaded the British Isles in 55 B.C.,
they found a primitive island inhabited by Celtic
tribes who had immigrated there from what today
is southern Germany. There was no unity among
these cultures, and the term England had not yet
been coined. The Romans unsuccessfully attempted
to put the stamp of their legal traditions on the
people they came into contact with, but by the time
Roman troops were withdrawn 400 years later,
except for Roman roads, walls, and town sites, little
had changed on the island. When the legions were
removed in the early fifth century, the Romanized
Britons proved ill-equipped to defend their borders
against marauding invaders from northern Europe.
Among the Germanic and Scandinavian invaders
were Saxons, Angles, and Jutes.1 Their prolonged
conquest of the island swept away any vestige of
Celtic or Roman legal traditions and gave the island
its Teutonic name England, or “Land of the Angles.”
Out of this welter of cultures emerged the tribal
foundation that would give birth to English common
law. The three tribes that were to become known as
the English would go on to conquer and prosper in
most parts of England.
ANGLO-SAXON ENGLAND
The Saxon tribal units that migrated to England
in the wake of the Roman retreat had originally lived
in what is now northern Germany. These tribes
fashioned Iron Age weapons and tools, herded
cattle, and had an extensive agricultural system.
At the same time, they were warlike with a
loose military organization. The most important
component of their social relationship was the blood
ties of the kinship group, a form of extended family.
In many respects, the tribe functioned as a group of
kinsmen.
Between the fifth and seventh centuries A.D., a
succession of Saxon invasions brought these tribal
kinship groups to England. Subsequently, the tribal
chief would give way to a king who would func-
tion as military leader and landlord. The king was
elected by the major landlords of the community,
an assembly that became known as the witan,
which is considered an early precursor to Parliament.
In time, the witan was empowered to declare law, elect
kings,and dole out landsto lordsand clergy.Each king-
dom was subdivided into shires, composed of smaller
territorial subdivisions known as hundreds.2 British
policing can be traced to the tribal customs of these
invading Germanic peoples. Each hundred was com-
posed of 100 families and was ruled by a hundredman,
or king’s reeve, who held court every 30 days. The shire
reeve was the forerunner of what became known as the
sheriff. Responsible for maintaining the peace, enfor-
cing and proclaiming laws, and collecting taxes, the
shire reeve was analogous to American sheriffs who
policed frontier counties in the nineteenth century.
Hundreds were divided into tithings, each
composed of 10 men, all responsible for the
behavior of one another. In the event one of the
tithing members committed a crime, the other
members were responsible for sounding the hue
and cry and apprehending the offender. This early
peacekeeping system was based on an objective of
mutual and collective responsibility in which the
community was liable for keeping the peace and
delivering lawbreakers to the hundred and shire
courts.

The Lawgivers
The earliest written laws, or dooms, of the Anglo-
Saxons can be traced back to the Laws of Aethel-
bert of Kent (570).3 These laws were based on local
customs and are considered one of the earliest legal
documents in English history. Far from compre-
hensive, they enumerate the punishment of various
crimes, ranging from homicide to fornication. Each
crime specified punishment and compensation. In
this complex society of noblemen, commoners,
freedmen, and slaves, individuals had values placed
on their lives by class. Hence, in the event that a
commoner was killed, his life was valued at 200
shillings, while a nobleman was worth perhaps 6
times that. Penalties and fines varied by class, not
unlike the stark punishments of Hammurabi’s code.
During the Anglo-Saxon era, there was no dis-
tinction between felonies and misdemeanors. Al-
though it is uncertain when the concept of felony4
originated, it has been suggested that it developed at
the time of the Norman Conquest as a category for
more serious crimes. One of the earliest mentions of
felony can be found in the Assize5 of Northampton
(1176), which mentions “murder and other felony.”
In the sixth century, the notion of the state had
not yet evolved, and the kinship groups or family
remained the chief social institution in Britain.
Therefore, a crime against an individual was a crime
against the family, typically resulting in a blood feud.
Kinship members were expected to seek revenge
from the perpetrators. Naturally, if the murder oc-
curred between kinship group members, there was
no bloodletting, and the perpetrator was banished.
Over time, systems of compensation were es-
tablished in lieu of blood feuds. Some sources sug-
gest that this softening of retaliation was in response
to the growth of Christianity and the feudal system.
Inspired by the need for collective responsibility,
the
wergild
replaced
the
blood
feud
among
Germanic tribes. Since the tribe was responsible
for transgressions by clan members, a collective
effort was made by the group to collect the blood
money and compensate the victim’s family.
During the ninth century, the British Isles
endured its first recorded attacks by the Danish
Vikings. Finally, in 878, King Alfred of Wessex
defeated the Danish forces in battle and made peace
after granting land concessions in an area that be-
came known as the Danelaw. One only has to look
at today’s map of England to discover the wide-
spread impact of the Scandinavian peoples on the
British Isles. There are more than 700 towns that
end in the suffix -by, which was the Scandinavian
term for village or town, hence bylaw, meaning
“town law.”
The word law was introduced by the Danes in
a region known as Danelaw, an area controlled by
the Danes that stretched approximately from the
Thames River to Liverpool. For almost half a cen-
tury beginning in 886, the Danelaw was regarded as
a separate political entity comprising almost half of
England. Here Scandinavian settlers blended in
with Anglo-Saxon neighbors, borrowing agricul-
tural methods while contributing their own varia-
tion of legal codes and institutions.
The Danes convened local assemblies called
Things, where farmers met under the supervision of
a lawman to make decisions concerning the com-
munity. According to Danish legal code, the com-
pensation to be paid for taking the life of a man, or
wergild, was determined by the status of the victim.
This contrasts with the Anglo-Saxon tradition,
which was determined by the status of the victim’s
master. The Danes are also credited with devising a
precursor to the English jury system. At local courts
held at the Things, 12 freeholders were required to
swear that they would not accuse an innocent man or
shield a guilty one.
Anglo-Saxon Legal Tradition
More important to the development of criminal jus-
tice customs in England were the influences brought
in by waves of Germanic invaders. Saxon tribal cus-
toms were preserved in oral traditions and were ac-
cepted and enforced by the entire society. Early
Anglo-Saxon society was based on bonds of kinship
and the extended family. A primitive form of social
organization to be sure, the collective nature of this
society diminished the importance of the individual,
although each individual was responsible for the ac-
tions of his kinsmen. Whenever an individual killed
or injured an individual, he brought the enmity of

the victim’s kin on his own family, ensuring a feud.
By law, families were allowed to exact vengeance on
the perpetrator’s kin. Over time, attempts were made
to downplay the vengeance in return for “blood
money” in the form of a wergild. When a defendant
was charged with a crime, the only methods for de-
termining guilt or innocence were the ordeal or
compurgation. Considered another major precursor
to the jury trial system, compurgation required both
the defendant and the accuser to provide oath helpers
to swear to the truthfulness of each party. Oath help-
ers were initially kinsmen and later on members of
the tithing group. The number of required oath
helpers depended on rank and the seriousness of the
offense. Typically, an accused defendant would sup-
ply 12 relatives or close neighbors who swore to the
veracity of his case.
Trial by ordeal can be found in cultures
throughout the world and in many time periods.
As practiced in England, it was typically conducted
by fire or water and was administered with the help
of a priest. Considered God’s judgment, the ordeal
was compulsory for individuals who were caught in
the act, who were formerly guilty of perjury, or
who were unable to provide the appropriate num-
ber of compurgators. Built on ancient methods of
determining guilt or innocence, trial by ordeal was
based on the notion that the gods would protect
the innocent. In Christian Britain, no less faith
was placed in this method. Trial by ordeal was ac-
tually the court of last resort since it was hoped
individuals would repent or confess before under-
going the ritual. There were also opportunities to
stack the odds in favor of the accused for a price by
corrupting officials or bribing clerics to cool off the
instruments prior to the ordeal.
Trial by fire often involved the accused walk-
ing blindfolded over hot coals or plowshares or
placing an arm into scalding water. If the wounds
did not heal within 3 days, the defendant was
judged guilty and faced the consequences. There
were other forms of ordeal that could be adjudi-
cated without waiting 3 days. Without a neutral
waiting period, crowds and bystanders could have
their curiosity sated by immersing heretics in cold
water to see if they would float or sink. Naturally, if
they sank, they were innocent. It would seem that
the immediate ordeal was preferable from the com-
munity point of view. The 400 years before the
Fourth Lateran Council (1215) are considered the
heyday of trial by ordeal. Virtually every law code
in the world in this era makes some type of refer-
ence to this procedure. Crimes ranging from mur-
der, forgery, and witchcraft to heresy prescribed
ordeals of hot iron and cold water. However, the
method of ordeal was not the first resort. Since it
coexisted with other methods of giving proof, it
was not used until other ways for determining the
truth had been exhausted.
Anglo-Saxon Crime and Punishment
Introduced in the ninth century, outlawry, or the
placing of an offender outside the protection of the
law, was used to punish individuals who refused to
appear at court, failed to pay the wergild, or attempted
to evade the machinery of justice by fleeing.
Individuals who were outlawed also forfeited their
property and lost all civil rights. According to the
procedure of the day, if an individual accused of a
crime failed to appear at county court four consecu-
tive times, he was pronounced an outlaw, in essence
branding him an animal to be hunted down. If he was
not killed while resisting capture, he could then face
the hangman on proof of his sentence of outlawry.
By the time of Edward III, only the sheriff had the
power to kill fugitives, unless it occurred in the pro-
cess of capture.
Beginning with the Laws of Aethelbert, fugi-
tives could be accorded sanctuary at a church or
other consecrated place under certain circum-
stances. However, a specific protocol had to be fol-
lowed in which a fugitive confessed his crime to a
priest, gave up any weapons, paid a fee to the
church, and recounted the particulars of the offense.
The perpetrator could be given sanctuary for only
40 days, after which he had to appear before the
coroner and promise on oath to leave the realm.
Sanctuary continued through the Norman era until
its abolition in 1623 under James I.
After confessing to the coroner and taking an
oath to leave the country, fugitives were promised

safe conduct and directed to the nearest seaport to
leave the country. As an alternative to outlawry,
abjuration (the process whereby a fugitive left the
country) allowed the abjurer, dressed in a simple
white robe and carrying a wooden cross, to safely
avoid the consequences of many crimes. Prohibited
from staying for more than two nights at any stop
along the way, fugitives were expected to leave
quickly to avoid confrontation with the victim’s
families. By the sixteenth century, Henry VIII in-
sisted on the branding of abjurers so that they could
be easily recognized if they returned to England
without being pardoned.
NORMAN ENGLAND
The Norman Conquest of England by forces under
William, Duke of Normandy, in 1066 is considered
one of the most pivotal events in English history.
Following the wishes of Edward the Confessor,
who died childless in 1066, his brother-in-law
Harold was appointed as his successor. However,
William claimed that he had been promised the
Crown earlier by Edward and, with the support
of the papacy, invaded England. After his victory
at the Battle of Hastings and the death of Harold
in battle on Christmas Day 1066, William was
crowned king of England at the newly completed
Westminster Cathedral.
The Normans of northern France were des-
cended from northern tribes (Vikings or Northmen),
not unlike the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes. But
during their 150 years in France, they had developed
a unique identity and a continental style of feudalism.
This system was a military structure, strictly enforced
through mutual obligation. The social classes of
Norman England were divided into three general
groups, with feudal lords, knights, and barons at the
top. In the middle were the ordinary citizens, usually
skilled workers. At the bottom were the serfs and
peasants of the estates, perhaps two-thirds of the
population. Barons, who were the highest level of
Norman lords, maintained huge landholdings, or
manors, on which lived vassals or serfs who toiled
on the land. In return for an oath of faithfulness and
certain well-understood obligations, the lords of
these estates would protect the vassals. Likewise,
the peasants would heed the call to arms when the
lord’s interests were threatened.
A serf was tied to the land and had no right to
leave his lord’s estate. They could be punished for
idleness, disorderly behavior, and poor workman-
ship. In return for working so many days a week for
the lord, delivering a certain amount of lumber, or
loaning his lord’s horses, serfs could expect the lords
to build them a new house if theirs burned down or
to care for their children if they were orphaned.
In the years following the Norman Conquest,
as Normans and Saxons lived more peacefully to-
gether, the authority of the sheriff was taken over
by the local lord of the manor. Subsequently, the
work of the hundred court was replaced by a manor
court. This court chose manor officers each year,
including an ale taster, bread weigher, swine ringer,
and, most important, a constable. Responsible for
helping keep the king’s peace on the estate, the
unpaid constable had a multitude of duties, includ-
ing reporting behavior problems to the court, ar-
resting malefactors and guarding them until trial,
and calling out the hue and cry and raising posse
comitatus (meaning “power of the county”), a
posse of locals, to capture a criminal.
Under English common law, all male persons over the age
of 15 were required to assist in law enforcement when
summoned by the sheriff through the hue and cry. The
term posse has a lasting resonance that most Americans
identify with the nineteenth-century West, when county
sheriffs enlisted the aid of all able-bodied men when en-
countering forces beyond their control. In late twentieth-
century Kingston, Jamaica, gangs were so enamored with
Hollywood Western movies that they adopted “posse” as
the name for their organized crime gangs.
We know little about the Norman law codes,
but we do know that William did not speak
English, nor did he initially understand the laws of
his new subjects. To win the allegiance of his new
subjects, he compiled the laws of Edward the Con-
fessor while at the same time introducing familiar
Norman customs. Adhering to the Middle Ages

custom of allowing conquered peoples to keep
their legal systems, William adopted most of the
Anglo-Saxon criminal justice ideas while introduc-
ing a number of customs from the European
continent. Another explanation for William’s rev-
erence for the Anglo-Saxon laws was that they
were evidence of a more highly developed body
of jurisprudence than the unwritten customs of
Normandy. William adopted the existing law-
keeping systems, including the tithing system, the
use of hue and cry, the hundred courts, and the
shire courts. The Normans introduced a feudal
system, a system of baronial courts, as well as
separate ecclesiastical or church courts. Building
on existing English customs, the Norman era would
give rise to the common-law legal tradition. The
Normans introduced the framework of a strong
centralized government that would eventually lead
to the development of national unity and a national
system of law. Following the Norman Conquest,
for the first time all land was owned either directly
or indirectly by the Crown.
The late eleventh century witnessed a recrudes-
cence of Roman law on the European continent.
The fall of the Roman Empire saw Justinian’s Cor-
pus Juris Civilis fall into disuse as less sophisticated
versions of the Roman civil law were applied by
Germanic invaders to the peoples of the Italian
peninsula. The invaders introduced Germanic legal
customs as well. During the Renaissance, which
followed the so-called Dark Ages, an intellectual
and scholarly interest in law emerged, beginning
in Bologna, Italy. This city was home to Europe’s
first modern university, where law was a featured
object of study. The jurists of the day recognized
the high intellectual quality of Roman law in stark
contrast to the “barbarized compilations” of the
Germanic invaders. Subsequently, the universities
of northern Italy became the center for the study
of the civil legal tradition, drawing scholars and
students from all over Europe. Those who studied

nations
imbued with the superiority of Justinian’s civil law
(including England during the reign of Henry II).
Roman civil law would soon influence the devel-
opment of common law, featuring a common body
of law, a common legal vernacular, and a common
method of instruction and scholarship.6
The Lawgivers
With the transition to the feudal system, each lord
held a special court for his tenants. The Normans
adopted Saxon procedures for determining guilt
and innocence: the compurgatory oath and trial
by ordeal. The Normans introduced another pro-
cedure, closely related to the ordeal: trial by battle.
A precursor to the adversarial legal system, trial by
battle involved a physical contest between a defen-
dant and a complainant. These would be fought
either by the individuals directly involved in the
complaint or through proxy champions. Women,
children, priests, and the elderly or infirm were
allowed to appoint champions to fight on their be-
half. Initially, champions could be used only in dis-
putes over land. In the case of murders, the
defendant had to appear in person. These judicial
duels were conducted with much formality. Knights
met in battle with the accoutrements of warfare,
while commoners often fought using lethal agricul-
tural implements. The two parties then fought to a
stalemate. If the loser was not killed in the battle, he
was hanged. Similar to and as ancient as trial by or-
deal, credence was given the notion that God gave
the judgment and would not have permitted an in-
nocent man to be defeated. Most individuals at-
tempted to avoid this form of arbitration, fearful of
the outcome. Despite its unpopularity, trial by battle
remained common into the thirteenth and four-
teenth centuries.
England had been Christianized for 400 years
by the time William introduced separate church
courts in 1066. The creation of these courts led to
the separation of ecclesiastical and secular law as the
church withdrew from the adjudication of secular
disputes. In return, church courts controlled spiri-
tual matters without secular interference. Initially,
church, or canon, law superseded the national law
of England, with the pope regarded as the supreme
legislator. Ecclesiastical courts decided spiritual af-
fairs, including clerical matters and decisions of
marriage, legitimation, and status. The church also

dealt with such offenses of morality, ranging from
incest and adultery to perjury, blasphemy, usury,
and heresy. Under this new system, all clergymen
were tried by church courts, as were commoners
who breached ecclesiastical law.
The church was particularly intrusive when it
came to marriage. Ecclesiastical courts could annul a
marriage if either party could not procreate children
or was related by blood or matrimony. Possessing
the exclusive right of annulment gave the church a
heightened influence in medieval society. There
were also legal consequences resulting from marriage.
When a man and woman married, the woman was
considered to have merged her identity with her hus-
band. This apparently gave rise to the longstanding
common-law rule that one party in a marriage could
not testify against the other.
Occasionally, the two systems of secular and
church law overlapped. Until the twelfth century,
for instance, the king insisted that sins were secular
offenses. Under church rules, the harshest penalty an
ecclesiastical court could pass was excommunication.
Other punishments included serving penance and
degradation of clerical status. To take advantage of
the less severe penalties arbitrated by the church
courts, crafty laymen claimed to be members of
the cloth in order to win benefit of clergy. This
should not be surprising in an era when secular de-
fendants routinely faced beheading, hanging, stran-
gulation, impalement, boiling to death, or being
broken on the wheel.
Benefit of clergy surfaced at a time when clerics
were subject to both secular and ecclesiastical law.
The clergy were eventually given an exemption
from secular rulings and would be punished only
by the church. During the Middle Ages, clerics
were the only members of society likely to be
able to read and write. To separate the thief from
the cleric, a sight-reading test was devised. This
would be proven by the ability to read Psalm 51,
or “neck verse,” which, if the defendant did suc-
cessfully, saved him from the gallows. But as more
people learned to read, the test became obsolete.
The more astute criminals often learned the psalm
by heart and could recite it word for word with a
book in front of them, even though they could not
actually read a word.
An individual could take advantage of benefit
of clergy only one time. To prevent a person from
pleading a second time, the fatty part of the thumb
was branded for future identification. By the four-
teenth century, benefit of clergy was given to liter-
ate individuals outside the clergy.7 This literacy test
was not abolished until 1706.
During the fourteenth century it was legal to hang
women convicted of murder in England. However, it was
illegal to kill an unborn child. In such a case the woman’s
life was spared until she gave birth. By most accounts the
first case of a condemned woman “pleading the belly”
was in 1387. In most cases once women gave birth they
were given reduced sentences or pardoned.
Norman Crime and Punishment
One of the more notable changes implemented
by William was a movement away from capital
punishment in favor of mutilation. No criminal
was hanged for the next 40 years. This did not
mean that no one died from criminal sanctions.
Indeed, scores of the convicted succumbed to
mutilations after having eyes put out and testicles
cut off.
With the support of the witan, or king’s assem-
bly, William became not only the Duke of Nor-
mandy but also the King of England, beginning a
new line of succession. Building on the Anglo-
Saxon criminal justice apparatus, the Normans
introduced a variety of new law enforcement posi-
tions to remove some of the power from the rapa-
cious sheriffs. In 1194, the coroner was introduced.
Selected at the county level, the coroner was ex-
pected to conduct inquiries in cases of suspicious
deaths and house break-ins.
Originating in twelfth-century England, the coroner is a
familiar feature of the criminal justice system in most of
the United States. Today the coroner performs specific
duties in investigating cases of death where there
are questionable circumstances or where there was no

attending physician at the time of death. While some
states have replaced the coroner with the medical
examiner, most counties have one elected coroner.
By the time of the Norman invasion, the posi-
tion of constable had become a position of high
prestige under the French kings. Derived from the
Latin comes stabuli, which means “head of the
stables,” ancient Roman constables, or glorified ser-
vants, were given this moniker because they had
demonstrated honesty while protecting the royal
stables. The constable became more identifiable in
a peacekeeping capacity following the conquest of
England. Over time, their tasks included collecting
taxes, arresting malefactors, transporting prisoners,
and serving legal papers. Most first-time offenders
usually became familiar with the local constable. It
was the constable that was expected to make the
arrest once the hue and cry was raised and then
hand over the quarry to the sheriff on apprehen-
sion. However, by the fifteenth century, life was
becoming increasingly complex, and inhabitants
were less willing to participate in the traditional
hue-and-cry process.
William I introduced the curfew procedure to
England to “protect against the risks of fire.” In a
world of wood, this was a natural concern. With
homes heated by open fires, usually in the middle
of the floor and directly under the roof, the hazards
were real. However, the curfew can be interpreted
as a clever bit of subterfuge since in reality it was
probably designed to keep subversive Anglo-Saxons
from meeting during the hours of darkness. When
the curfew bell tolled at eight o’clock each evening,
inhabitants were expected to extinguish their fires
and retire for the night or face harsh consequences.
Within a few decades of the Norman Conquest,
the curfew was relaxed to allow fires to burn after
the curfew bell.
Curfews have been around for hundreds of years. The
word’s origins can be traced back to its Latin and French
roots. Curfews were traditionally created by the upper-
class members of society who wanted to limit the move-
ments of the lower class. Originally, curfews operated
under the presumption that an entire class of people was
guilty. In the United States, curfews were originally
implemented to control African Americans in the South.
During the early 1900s, curfews became popular for con-
trolling juveniles. The ringing of the curfew bell alerted
teenagers and children it was time to go home. In recent
years, cities and towns across the country have expanded
the use of youth curfews to address the growing concern
about juvenile crime and violence, treating in like fashion
an entire demographic group as if it is guilty. Curfews
remain a controversial crime control strategy. There is
little empirical evidence that they actually work, and ac-
cording to civil libertarians curfews violate constitutional
protections.
The Domesday Book
In a time when land equaled wealth, the Domesday8
survey was a comprehensive inquest of the English
land tenure system that redistributed the land
from the Saxon upper class to the Norman nobles.
Although the survey was incomplete, it is still
considered the high-water mark of administrative
achievement for the Middle Ages for the speed
and precision with which it was conducted. Twenty
years after the Norman Conquest, to determine
the extent of his landholdings and fiscal rights,
William initiated a complete survey of the number
of individuals who belonged to each class, including
serfs, knights, barons, and so forth. In effect, this
inquest reduced all social relationships to a land
tenure system. The survey also enumerated the
amount of arable land, water mills, meadows and
pastures, and forests and fisheries and the value of
the estates. The survey was conducted under mount-
ing popular resentment, as the Saxons saw it as an
attempt to strengthen the power of the invaders.
Prior
to
the

Conquest,
sheriffs
were drawn from the ranks of landowners and func-
tioned as royal agents in the shires. Within 5 years
of the conquest, Saxon sheriffs were replaced by
Normans. As their duties were expanded over time,
they became more oppressive as well. The stereotype
of the oppressive sheriff figures prominently in the
Robin Hood ballads. The Domesday survey records
a number of high-handed actions in which sheriffs
enriched their own coffers.

Compiledbetween1085and1086,theDomesday
Book offers an interesting picture of eleventh-century
England. With a population estimated at more than
1.5 million, only 290,000 names are recorded. Of
these, 9,000 settled there following the Norman
Conquest. This group controlled 80% of the land.
What becomes clear is that following the Norman
invasion, a social revolution had occurred that essen-
tially placed a feudal Norman aristocracy between the
king and the Saxon farmers, creating a national feudal
system that would last for centuries. Over the next
century, the Normans and Saxons coalesced into one
people: the English people.
The Reforms of Henry II
The reign of Henry II, which lasted from 1154 to
1189, signaled a turning point in the history of the
English legal system. Henry and his ministers would
shape many legal and administrative procedures that
would determine the direction that the developing
English criminal justice system would take. At the
time Henry took the throne, England was well sup-
plied with numerous courts reflecting the feudal
system of twelfth-century England. Hundred courts
handled petty crimes committed by the lower clas-
ses, while the shire courts were concerned with the
judicial aspects of more serious offenses. Comple-
menting the judicial arrangements of the day were
courts of the manor (landlord’s private estate), bor-
ough courts, honorial courts (concerned with pleas
of land), and ecclesiastical courts. Despite the sug-
gested distinctions of the various courts, the system
was confusing. What actually determined to which
court an individual took his plea was his status in
the complicated nature of his tenure under the feu-
dal system. The competing and overlapping juris-
dictions of the old customary law (Anglo-Norman)
became a source of serious trouble during the
1100s.
Under Henry II’s administration, the power of
the Crown increased at the expense of the clergy
and the feudal barons. A chain of events led to a
transition from the old tribal–feudal system of law
to royal courts and to the practice of common law
throughout England. During this era, the oppres-
sive power of the sheriff diminished as it became
more subordinate to the Crown. Subsequently,
the sheriff would become a minor official.
In 1166, England was beset by a growing crime
problem. In response, during this centennial year of
the Norman Conquest, Henry II issued the Assize
of Clarendon, which established trial by grand jury.
Juries consisted of 12 men in each hundred with
four from each township. Together they submitted
the names of all reputed criminals in the district for
trial by ordeal (similar to today’s grand juries, which
review the facts of a case and issue either a true bill
or a no bill). When traveling judges paid a visit to a
district, communities were given an efficient means
for stemming the crime wave. Ten years later, the
Assize of Northampton divided the country into six
circuits, and justices in Eyre were made responsible
for traveling to shires and hundreds throughout the
realm. These judges superseded the local courts and
were considered a means of controlling the conduct
of sheriffs, bailiffs, and coroners in the Middle Ages.
Henry encouraged all freemen to furnish them-
selves with arms and armor according to their
means through the 1181 Assize of Arms, trusting
his subjects to heed the call to arms in event of an
emergency. According to Henry’s proclamation,
“Whoever possesses one knight’s fee shall have a
shirt of mail, a helmet, a shield, and a lance.”
Some homicide scholars have suggested that with
each man armed day and night, murder rates soon
rose as well.
The introduction of itinerant judges was con-
sidered one of Henry’s greatest legal innovations;
their regular visits would eventually lead to a com-
mon law throughout the realm. What stifled the
progress of the itinerant judges was the basic prob-
lem of how to delegate royal authority without at
the same time putting too much discretionary
power into the hands of the judges. This problem
was resolved with the publication of The Treatise on
the Laws and Customs of England toward the end of
Henry’s reign. Commonly known by its shortened
title Glanvill, its author is unknown. According to
this lawbook, there was officially a court that trav-
eled with the king, a “chief court” that resided at
Westminster, and a royal court that was periodically

carried throughout the country by a group of royal
justices who traversed a certain circuit of the shires.
Historian James Buchanan Given has made an
extensive examination of the reports by the king’s
justices. The Eyre rolls offer insight into the proce-
dure for investigating homicide in the thirteenth
century. Apparently, when someone died under
suspicious circumstances, the coroner was sum-
moned to conduct an inquest. Once he arrived,
he summoned an inquest jury made up of men
from the vicinity where the body was found. He
then examined the body and ascertained whether
the homicide occurred at the scene or elsewhere. If
someone was suspected of the crime, he or she was
arrested by the coroner, who then, with the help of
the jury, estimated the value of the perpetrator’s
property. All this was recorded on loose leaves of
parchment paper. The work of Givens suggests that
compared to the low homicide rates of present-day
Europe, medieval England was the scene of unre-
mitting violence.
According to one of Henry II’s biographers,
H.L. Warren, during his tenure as king, “criminal
law did not show the same progress toward the
development of rational processes” in the adminis-
tration of punishment as in other areas of criminal
justice reform.9 Beginning in 1166, in the midst of a
growing crime problem, criminal punishment was
designed as a deterrent. After the Assize of Clarendon,
anyone who failed the ordeal was sentenced to be
hanged or to have a foot amputated and then be
banished from the realm for 40 days. The Assize of
Northampton, 10 years later, introduced even more
serious punishments. Mutilation, following convic-
tion by ordeal, was extended to include the right
hand and foot.
The early years of Henry II’s reign witnessed
great conflict between the church and the state over
the jurisdiction of church law. Separate ecclesiastical
courts were responsible for arbitrating cases involv-
ing church clergy. Since the shedding of blood was
not allowed in church courts, the worst penalty a
murderer in church court could expect was excom-
munication. By demanding “benefit of clergy,”
monks, priests, students, sextons, and others could
win the right to be tried in church courts to escape
severe sentences. The royal courts had no jurisdic-
tion in these cases. Henry was troubled by the fact
that almost any person with a scintilla of education
or any connection with the church could take ad-
vantage of this legal loophole and wanted to end
the immunity of the church from secular jurisdic-
tion and bring it under the control of the royal
courts.
Matters came to a head in 1161, when Henry
II appointed Thomas Becket as the Archbishop of
Canterbury. The assumption that Becket would
continue to cooperate with the Crown would
lead to one of the most famous murder cases of
the Middle Ages and once again bring into question
the relationship between church and state. The son
of a London merchant, Becket lived a life of luxury
after Henry appointed him chancellor in 1154.
After the death of the current archbishop in 1161,
Henry appointed Becket as the successor, confident
he would remain a friend and loyal servant of
the king and the state. However, things did not
quite work out that way, with Becket adopting a
more ascetic lifestyle. Realizing that he could not
serve two masters, Becket resigned his chancellor’s
post under the king and was now resolute in be-
coming the champion of the church.
In 1164, Henry stated that he wanted to return
to the customs of Henry I, which included a clause
stating that if clergymen were
accused in a
royal court and then tried in an ecclesiastical court,
found guilty, and unfrocked, they should then be
sent back to the royal court for sentencing and
punishment. Henry’s new rules extended the juris-
diction of the royal courts in several directions.
Becket retaliated by refusing to put the archbishop’s
seal on any documents containing the king’s pro-
posals. The conflict between the two men intensi-
fied,
leading
Becket
to
flee
to
Rome
and
subsequently excommunicate the king and his min-
isters. In response, Henry confiscated Canterbury’s
revenues.
After Becket returned to England, relations
soon worsened, leading Henry to brand Becket a
“turbulent priest” as he launched into a tirade of
invective that convinced several of Henry’s retainers
to kill Becket. Becket’s martyrdom at Canterbury

Cathedral at the hands of four knights forced Henry
to accept an agreement with the pope by which
benefit of clergy would persist. This resulted in an
increase in papal authority and a check on Henry’s
power by the church. Over the next century, scores
of monasteries would be erected in England, signi-
fying the expanding power of the church. To
Henry’s credit, he was able to make peace with
the church and, through a spectacular act of public
contrition, retain the loyalty of the middle classes.
One of the greatest English lawmakers, Henry
combined Norman–French legal concepts with the
ancient common law, completing the work begun
by William the Conqueror. No less a source than
F. W. Maitland noted that Henry II’s reign was “a
critical moment in English legal history,”10 coincid-
ing with an era in which customary law was no
longer adequate for the needs of a rapidly changing
society. With the revival of the study of Roman
civil law, Henry perhaps saw the possibilities of
adapting rational jurisprudence to meet the needs
of an evolving criminal justice system. At his death,
he could look back on numerous achievements,
having made the Crown the source of all justice
at the expense of the baronial courts.
The Jury
The origins of jury trial are still a subject of much
debate. While some authorities credit its introduc-
tion in England to Danish settlements, most evi-
dence suggests that it was inaugurated by the
Normans. A variety of prototypes for the English
jury system had been suggested. As an alternative to
compurgation and trial by battle or ordeal, a new
form of trial, called inquisition, was inaugurated.
According to this method, a judge who was se-
lected to hear a case between two parties would
order a number of men familiar with the particulars
of the case, usually 12, to investigate the case and
give a sworn verdict as to who should win the dis-
pute. These selected men became known as jurors
because they had to swear to tell the truth and were
required to decide in favor of one of the parties in
the case. Thus we see the beginning of trial by jury,
in which jurors are peers of the defendant.
One explanation as to why the Normans ex-
tended the alternative of the jury trial was that trial
by battle too often favored the omnipotent warlike
leaders over the poor and often defenseless lower
classes. Unlike present-day juries, which are sup-
posed to be unfamiliar with the case, the early Nor-
man juries were composed of those most likely to
be familiar with the proceedings.
The Fourth Lateran Council
The year 1215 was pivotal for the history of com-
mon law. Not only was the Magna Carta signed,
but the Fourth Lateran Council convened and
withdrew church support for trial by ordeal. The
Fourth Lateran Council, held in Rome, was
the largest assembly of its kind in the history of
the Christian church. The church apparently with-
drew its support for this ancient method of gather-
ing proof because it felt that the clergy should not
be involved in taking the lives of fellow Christians.
Since these trials could not be conducted without
the presence of priests, trial by ordeal diminished.
The abolition of the ordeal left few alternatives for
determining guilt or innocence besides compurga-
tion, jury trials, and trial by battle. Family men
typically did not prefer trial by jury since, on con-
viction, their property would be confiscated and
forfeited to the king’s treasury. In certain cases, to
force an accused to enter a plea at arraignment,
defendants underwent peine forte et dure,11 in which
weighty rocks were stacked on their chests until
they either agreed to a jury trial or died. Under
English common law, no accused could be tried
unless the accused formally entered a plea. There-
fore, under the practice of peine forte et dure, the
accused either entered a plea or died under the
weights. In modern practice, if an accused stands
mute at arraignment, the presiding judge will auto-
matically enter a plea of not guilty on behalf of the
accused.
Since news traveled slowly in the Middle Ages,
the ruling from the Fourth Lateran Council took
time to reach England and other Catholic countries
from Rome. But in 1219, trial by ordeal was abol-
ished in England. Without trial by ordeal, other

methods had to become more developed for reach-
ing resolutions in more difficult criminal cases. The
demise of the ordeal led to several major develop-
ments in the quest for proof, including an increas-
ing reliance on torture as a replacement for the
ordeal procedure. But, like the ordeal, it was also
meant to be the procedure of last resort. England,
however, diverged from the European continental
tradition at this juncture, as it made swift progress
toward the trial jury, resulting in a legal tradition
that became increasingly different from Roman
civil legal conventions.
As England moved more toward an adversarial
system characterized by a jury, continental countries
went through a different evolution in criminal justice
procedure. Not to be confused with the Spanish In-
quisition of the fifteenth century, the European in-
quisitorial process placed the judges at center in the
fact-gathering process (not torture). By the sixteenth
century, the inquisitorial method was standardized.
While the adversarial process that we are so familiar
with assumes that the truth will come out after a free
and open competition by two lawyers over who had
the correct facts, the inquisitorial trial is more like a
continuing investigation, as the judges and not the
attorneys call and examine the witnesses.
Prior to the Norman Conquest, there was no
legal profession in England. William introduced law-
yers to Britain in the form of his “servants of the king
at law.” Many of the first judges were selected from
their ranks. By the fourteenth century, guilds of
lawyers known as Inns of Court could be found in
London. Four of the original 14 Inns still exist. At
London’s Inns of Court, the legal profession trained
apprentices in the common law. Here, legal educa-
tion included lectures, oral disputation, and atten-
dance at court. Over time, the Inns made the
transition from apprentice training to law school
and for several centuries were more popular law
schools than those at Oxford and Cambridge.
The Magna Carta
The Magna Carta is probably the best-known doc-
ument in English history. Translated from Latin, it
means “Great Charter.”
Signed by King John at Runnymede on June 15,
1215, the Magna Carta established the fundamental
principles of human rights. John ruled England
from 1199 to 1216 and is considered among the least
capable of the nation’s kings. Violent, capricious, and
vengeful, he succeeded in alienating virtually every
faction of his realm; commoners, clergy, and lords
were united in their hatred for the monarch. His
unpopularity was not confined to the British Isles,
for in 1208 he was excommunicated by Pope Inno-
cent III. The barons met several times prior to 1215
and decided that beforetakingup arms,they wouldtry
and compel the king to sign a charter of rights. With
the support of the citizens of London, John capitulated
to the demands and on June 15, 1215, signed the
Magna Carta at Runnymede.
Almost 300 years before the invention of the
printing press, 20 to 25 copies of the Magna Carta
were painstakingly written out by clerks for distri-
bution around the country. Of these, only four sur-
vive. Copies were sent to various towns and read
aloud so that everyone was privy to the king’s con-
cessions. In an era of almost universal illiteracy, the
documents were sent to cathedrals, where the liter-
ate clergy could read the Magna Carta publicly.
Containing the basic principles that would be
incorporated in the American Constitution 500
years later, the Magna Carta had a great impact
on subsequent developments in constitutional law
and political freedom. One of the most important
developments was the notion of due process found
in Chapter 39 of the Magna Carta: “No free man
shall be taken, imprisoned, outlawed, banished, or
in any way destroyed, nor will We proceed against
or prosecute him, except by the lawful judgment of
his equals and by the law of the land.” By the sev-
enteenth century, due process of law and habeas
corpus would be united and contribute to signifi-
cant constitutional developments.
Regarded as one of the foundations of modern
democracy, the Magna Carta guaranteed legal tax
collection (with permission of Parliament), justice
to all men without fear or favor, and no imprison-
ment without trial. A turning point in legal history,
the document set up a permanent judicial center at
Westminster as well as annual assizes held by circuit

judges throughout the country. Westminster be-
came the repository for legal records and the site of
the Court of Common Pleas, where suits between
private individuals were held. It is during this era that
one can discern the evolution of an expanded legis-
lature comprising upper and lower houses of dele-
gates. What would become the House of Lords was
based on the hereditary right passed from father to
son, while the House of Commons was filled with
representatives from the commoners. This parlia-
ment sat at Westminster.
The faint origins of Parliament can be found
not in law but in custom. The development of this
body was spurred by the king’s increasing need for
revenue, which forced him to negotiate with the
assorted classes of thirteenth-century England. By
the early 1250s, the word parliamentum came into
use to designate a meeting of the shire knights to
consider new taxes. Although the first official
Parliament convened in 1265, it would be another
30 years before Parliament was reorganized under
the reign of Edward I12 on the basis that it occu-
pies today. By 1295, the representative nature of
Parliament had been established. Often referred to
as the “English Justinian,” Edward became one of
England’s greatest lawgivers.
With the growth of towns and expanding
urban areas, nighttime crime was increasing at an
alarming rate. To counter the rising crime wave,
King Edward I issued the Statute of Winchester in
1285. One of the most important pieces of criminal
justice legislation to come out of the Middle Ages,
this proclamation ordered all freemen between the
ages of 15 and 60 to own armor and weapons ac-
cording to their social status in order to defend the
peace. These accoutrements would be inspected
twice a year by constables elected from each hun-
dred. But more important, this statute ordained that
every walled town should establish a system of
watch and ward, a form of day and night watch,
to maintain security. According to this statute, all
large walled towns were ordered to shut their gates
from sunset to sunrise. The watch was ordered to
arrest any suspicious strangers and lock them up
until morning. Other proactive measures included
widening highways leading to market towns and
eliminating potential hiding spots along the roads
for thieves and highwaymen. The night watch
and day ward would be the main police presence
in English town life for almost 600 years.
The Black Death
In 1348, a trading ship reached England with an un-
wanted cargo of flea-ridden rats carrying the devas-
tating bubonic plague pestilence from its origins in
central Asia. The plague was usually fatal, and with
no cure, perhaps 25% to 50% of the population per-
ished. The impact was felt everywhere. The demo-
graphic crisis saw the clergy pared by 40%. According
to estate records, perhaps two-thirds of the work-
force perished, leading to a huge reduction in the
labor force. In turn, serfs no longer felt their tradi-
tional obligations to their lords and barons and began
to leave the manorial estates to take wage-paying jobs
in towns. The labor shortage resulting from the Black
Death made it inevitable that workers would demand
rights and advantages that had been previously con-
fined to the upper classes. However, as feudal restric-
tions seemed less persuasive, the state stepped in to
preserve order. With the Statute of Laborers (1351),
state control of the labor force supplanted the power
of the feudal lords, leaving peasants and artisans in a
stronger bargaining position with their lords and
masters, with Parliament serving as an intermediary.
By stepping in when it did, the English government
was able to ensure a continuing adequate supply of
agricultural workers at rates that existed prior to the
pandemic while leading to a dramatic increase in
wages. Ultimately, Parliament became a more for-
midable presence in English society by prohibiting
idleness and preventing the free movement of the
menial classes under the threat of imprisonment and
branding.
Medieval Crime and Punishment
Late medieval England was known throughout
Europe for its high crime rate. In the fourteenth
century, most people lived on the bare margins
of existence, as 9 out of 10 people still lived in the
countryside. As violence escalated, English common

law reacted by zealously punishing the crime of
homicide. Individuals caught in a deadly encounter
were cautioned that they had “a duty to retreat” to
avoid possible bloodshed. With an increasingly cen-
tralized government, the Crown sought to maintain
a monopoly on conflict resolution. It was expected
that individuals would settle acrimonious disputes
either amicably or in court. In the event that your
adversary threatened you, you were expected to leave
the scene immediately and retreat until your back was
literally against the wall. At this point, it was permissi-
ble to stand and fight in self-defense. In this way, the
state attempted to reduce the homicide rate by shifting
the battle scene from the streets to the courts.
In response to the rise in felonies and with the
escalation of organized criminal activities, trail-
baston commissions were inaugurated in 1304.
Because of a combination of rural unemployment,
demobilized soldiers, and social unrest, several judi-
cial innovations were introduced. The trailbaston
was a special judicial commission of judges empow-
ered to travel to crime-ridden villages and set up
grand juries to help wipe out local gangs. Historians
have compared the activities of this commission to
twentieth-century
crime
commissions
led
by
Thomas Dewey (1930s) and Rudolph Giuliani
(1980s) that successfully went after organized crime
in New York City. These medieval justices, like
their modern-day counterparts, made headway
through the use of informants who were convinced
to turn state’s evidence and testify against their for-
mer colleagues in return for a lighter sentence.
Known as approvers in the Middle Ages, once a
gang member was convicted, he could accuse the
former gang members. But to prove his accusation,
he was forced to vanquish each one through the
ancient trial by battle. On defeating each defendant,
he was pardoned. Conversely, if he was not victo-
rious or was not killed in battle, he was executed.
Beginning in 1361, the justice of the peace (JP)
became the cornerstone of British law and order.
This peacekeeping position can be traced back to
the 1260s, when it was known as the “keeper of the
peace.” Considered another self-help approach to
maintaining rural law and order, each shire had
three or four JPs who were charged with restraining
the ever-present rioting. Imbued with the power to
pursue and punish malefactors, they were allowed
to try less serious offenders without the presence of
the king’s judges. To alleviate the caseloads of the
various courts, JPs were authorized to confront
most types of misdemeanors, including poaching,
petty thievery, and drunken fighting. Occasionally,
they were also allowed to try felony cases. In effect,
London was authorizing the landed gentry to main-
tain law and order in their districts to reduce the
pressure on the criminal justice apparatus in London.
Although this was an unpaid position, wealthy land-
owning families saw it as a position that could lead to
a better marriage or a seat in Parliament. As the
powers of the JPs increased, the authority of the
once-mighty sheriffs eroded. The JP system would
persist into the late nineteenth century.
One of the oldest criminal justice positions in the United
States, contemporary justices of the peace (JPs) are state
magistrates whose duties include administering justice
for minor offenses and committing cases to trial at higher
courts. They are usually elected within a minor civil divi-
sion, but their jurisdiction usually extends throughout a
county. In most states, they are compensated from fees.
Most JPs have had little formal legal training, and in
some states they are allowed to conduct hearings and fix
bail for future court appearance. But clearly, the position
of JP has lost much of its former luster.
By the fourteenth century, the constable was
still an unpaid position, recognizable only by his
official staff. Over time, his duties had multiplied.
While he still had to capture wrongdoers, he now
had to apply unpleasant punishments as well. The
constables became increasingly unpopular as they
whipped vagrants and ducked scolds in the village
pond. They also had to make regular reports of pub-
lic complaints to the courts. While all adult males
were responsible for serving stints as constables,
those who could afford to would pay replacements.
Such an odious job, then, was usually performed by
the indigent, the elderly, and whoever else was in
dire enough straits to accept the payoff. In William
Shakespeare’s time, the constable usually offered
comic respite in his plays, not unlike the Keystone
Kops of the silent-film era.
ENGLISH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ANTECEDENTS (570–1725)
37

Introduced in the fifteenth century, the Court of
Star Chamber13 was created to punish wealthy sup-
porters of organized crime activity. As organized
crime declined, it was used to quell riots and other
social disturbances and to punish the instigators. Pro-
cedure was rather simple. With no jury present, a
defendant was ordered to stop some sort of antisocial
behavior or to refrain from committing a particular
offense, or else face punishment. Although the court
was prohibited from imposing capital punishment,
mutilation, shaming, and short imprisonment could
be levied on defendants. The court remained popular
through the sixteenth century. Its decline and disap-
pearance in the seventeenth century resulted from its
harsh and arbitrary sentencing and its association
with the king’s unpopular policies of the 1630s.
Particularly glaring was its suppression of the
large Puritan minority for indiscretions, real or imag-
ined. Among the more questionable judgments of
the court was the punishment in 1637 of barrister
William Prynne, who had his ears cut off and was
then pilloried and imprisoned for writing a book
that allegedly insulted the queen. In 1642, a statute
was passed in Parliament that not only abolished the
court but also prohibited the procedure of making
a defendant testify against himself (similar to the
Fifth Amendment protection in the American
Constitution).
The Court of Star Chamber retained its sinister menace
for the 1983 film The Star Chamber. Similar to the
original court, formed in the fourteenth century to try
criminals without the benefit of a jury, in this film nine
angry judges convene privately to decide the fate of
criminals who have escaped retribution because of legal
technicalities. Judge Hardin, played by Michael Douglas,
is sick of criminals getting off because of the Fourth
Amendment, which requires him to prohibit evidence
obtained by unlawful search and seizures. In the tradition
of the vigilante genre, this film suggests that the rule of
law allows dangerous criminals back on the streets and
that sometimes it is tempting for individuals to take the
law into their own hands. In the case of this 1983 Star
Chamber, if it votes guilty, hired killers kill the criminals.
The film is ultimately a fantasy, produced at a time
when America was experiencing rising crime rates (like
England in 1347).
Under William the Conqueror’s watch, the
Normans introduced the murder fine, or mur-
drum.14 Since there was significant resentment
against the Normans, often resulting in the killing
of local leaders and their servants, William instituted
the murdrum. According to the law, if a Norman
was found dead under suspicious circumstances, the
district was required to arrest the perpetrator or re-
quire him or her to pay a murder fine. However, in
the event that the evidence proved the victim was
not Norman, the fine was excused. By the Assize of
Clarendon in 1166, there was little differentiation
between Normans and Englishmen, and deliberate
killings became known as murders. It is clear that
by the end of the fourteenth century, the Crown
had taken a harder line toward murders, especially
those committed from ambush or with “malice
aforethought.” In the early sixteenth century, the
crime of manslaughter became distinct from mur-
der, the difference being the presence or absence of
premeditation, and in 1531 Henry VIII removed
murder from benefit of clergy. From that time on,
murder became synonymous with killings involving
malice aforethought.
Between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,
punishment had become somewhat less cruel, with
many mutilations being abolished. But to stall re-
cidivism, barbaric penalties were still meted out to
rapists who were castrated or blinded and thieves
who could be scalded to death or have an eye
gouged out. Although individuals were still buried
and burned alive, disemboweled, hanged, and be-
headed, a movement was afoot to introduce more
lenient exhibitory punishments, such as stocks and
pillories, to shame individuals into reforming their
criminal ways.
The popular image of the pillory shows the
defendant spending an inexorable amount of time
attached to this device, when in reality an individ-
ual might spend 3 hours in it every 3 months, often
with a whetstone around his neck. However, this
punishment was not altogether benign, particularly
when prolonged exposure could lead to death. In
the early Middle Ages, individuals were mutilated
while ensconced in the pillory. Conveniently inca-
pacitated, the law enforcer might be called on to slit

a nose or cut off an upper lip or even both ears.
Recidivist felons were often pinned by their ears to
the pillory, and the only way to secure freedom was
to pull away from the nail until the ear came off.
Stocks and pillories were used to punish offenders
who engaged in deceitful business practices, forgery,
begging under false pretenses, and even masquerad-
ing as a king’s officer. One baker appeared at court so
often that he was nicknamed “Pillory” for his pen-
chant for the shaming device.
Perhaps the most glaring form of exhibitory
punishment was branding, a punishment that could
be traced back to the ancient Babylonians. During
the Middle Ages, individuals were branded on the
face or body with a mark that would be instantly
identifiable with the crime committed. B stood for
blasphemer, R for robber, SL for seditious libel, and
so forth. In the mid-sixteenth century, Edward VI
signed a law allowing for vagrants and vagabonds to
be defaced with the letter V. This law would not be
repealed for almost a century. In an era before fin-
gerprinting and the Bertillon system, branding was
one of the few identification systems recognizable
to all. One of the drawbacks for society was that,
like prison tattoos today, society tended to stigma-
tize these individuals who were left virtually unem-
ployable for life and therefore had no choice but a
life of crime. While branding fell out of popularity
by the fourteenth century, it was not outlawed in
Britain until 1779.
Until the nineteenth century, virtually all felo-
nies were punishable by death. Beginning in 1768,
judges were given the prerogative of sending cer-
tain felons to the American or Australian colonies.
There were plenty of felons to go around. In the
case of theft, distinctions were based on the value of
the stolen object. Early in the Norman era, if a
felon stole an object worth 12 pence, it was con-
sidered grand larceny, a capital offense. If it was
under 12 pence, it was petty larceny, which carried
much less severe punishment. By the nineteenth
century, juries often assigned fictitious values to sto-
len goods to downgrade a capital offense to petty
larceny and spare the defendant from the gallows.
By the late 1820s, England’s bloody code was on
the wane.
Henry VIII and the Protestant
Reformation
Succeeding to the throne in 1509, the 18-year-old
monarch who would author the song “Green-
sleeves,” the lover of sports and music, gave no hint
of the controversy and cruelty that would character-
ize his reign. The story of Henry’s quest for a male
heir that led him through six wives and into conflict
with the Catholic Church is well known. For our
purposes, we will concentrate on the constitutional
crisis that followed Henry’s establishment of the
Church of England, placing himself as the supreme
head of the church. Henry’s determination to have a
male heir led to his breach with Rome and the Act of
Treason and Supremacy in 1534, which officially
made him the supreme head of the Church of
England. Anyone who questioned his authority,
whether in public or in private, could expect a date
with the headsman.
Henry was always cognizant of the fact that he
ruled with the consent of Parliament. Summoning
Parliament in 1529, he initiated a great social and
ideological revolution that would go far toward es-
tablishing Crown and Parliament together as the
foundation for the new England. He kept Parlia-
ment in session for 7 years, allowing him to pass
successive measures that changed the structure of
the Church of England, including having the clergy
accept him as head of that church. After passing a
law that prohibited the clergy from convocation
without his consent, Sir Thomas More, chancellor
and author of Utopia, resigned. More would sign his
death warrant by differing with the king over the
legitimacy of his matrimonial life. He would not be
alone. According to one estimate, 72,000 people
were executed during Henry’s reign.
When Henry VIII broke with the Church of
Rome and declared himself supreme head of the
Church of England, the resulting Reformation
brought harsh punishments to anyone who stood
in its way. One of the most prominent monarchs
of the Renaissance era, Henry VIII was well-
known for his propensity for cruelty, which in-
cluded the passage of an act authorizing boiling to
death anyone convicted of poisoning. It would be

left to his only son, Edward VI, to finally abolish
this sadistic penalty.
The invention of the printing press in the fif-
teenth century heralded a new era in the history of
humankind. Prior to this time, manuscripts were
expensive and slow to produce, and few copies of
any work existed. It should not be surprising that
few people were literate and that education was
restricted to the clergy. In 1477, the first book
was printed in England. With the ability to print
the Bible in English, Henry set the stage for the
growth of Protestantism. At the time Henry was
distancing England from the papacy, a recrudes-
cence of Roman law was occurring across the
European continent. Without Henry’s break with
the Vatican, Roman law might have crossed the
English Channel and altered the course of criminal
justice history.
Bridewells and Early Corrections
Poverty and lawlessness were rampant in sixteenth-
century England. With the influx of destitute beggars
from the rural environs to the city, upscale inhabi-
tants feared the threat to public order, concerned that
social unrest could result. In the 1550s, Edward VI,
son of Henry VIII, established the first house of cor-
rection, or Bridewell, donating the use of Bridewell
Palace, a former royal mansion, as a “hospital for
moral, not physical deformities.” Over the next cen-
tury Roman Catholics, nonconformists, and petty
offenders would be confined here as it made the
transformation from a palace for foreign dignitaries
into a house of correction. By the 1630s it was cus-
tomary to issue whippings to vagrants and prostitutes
on their first arrival. Adults were given 12 lashes, and
children half that. With few alternatives for enter-
tainment, the public often flocked to witness the
floggings.
In 1576, Parliament mandated that Bridewells
should be opened in every county. Eventually, 300
would be in operation. (These institutions would
survive into the nineteenth century.) The Bridewell
became an institution in which individuals had to
work for their room and board. Among the more
mind-numbing tasks were making nails, beating
hemp, cleaning sewers, and working the treadmills.
Like the modern prison, these houses of correction
were designed to be self-financing while at the
same time forging better citizens. Here petty crim-
inals, transients, and the indigent were required to
work while incarcerated. Some manufactured items
for sale; others were involved in baking and milling.
Over time the range of occupational instructional
increased to more than 25 trades, and as early as
1563 a system of apprenticeship was inaugurated
for the children of the poor as well as young street
children. By the 1770s the house of correction,
which some have compared to something between
a poorhouse and a jail, had been adopted through-
out much of Western Europe.
The English Bill of Rights
The Levellers were among the most outspoken re-
formers of the seventeenth century. While there is
still debate over their long-term influence, some
historians have accorded them the distinction of
having anticipated some of the tenets found in the
American Constitution as well as the birth of mod-
ern democracy. The Levellers originated among
London’s artisans and claimed that all Englishmen
had the right to suffrage.
Although the Levellers’ demands went un-
heeded in their era, much of their platform would
come to fruition in America in the next century.
The Levellers’ prescience included the prohibition
of debt imprisonment, a written constitution and
bill of rights, the abolition of aristocratic titles, and
a parliament elected by and for the people. Further-
more, they argued that the legal system should be
simplified by purging it of Latin and French phra-
seology, allowing the common people to conduct
legal affairs without the impediment of expensive
legal representation. However, dissension within
the Leveller ranks, together with lack of political
clout, sealed their ultimate demise.
One of the most valuable legacies of the develop-
ment of law in England was the writ of habeas cor-
pus.15 Originally found in Article 39 of the Magna
Carta, over time it had been often overlooked by
40

those in power. But the Habeas Corpus Amendment
Act of 1679 made it impossible to secretly confine
anyone. As a result of this legislation, a writ could be
issued requiring that an individual accused of a crime
be present in court at the time of trial and could not
be convicted in absentia.
On the death of King Charles II in 1685, with
no legitimate heir in sight, the Crown was passed to
his Roman Catholic brother James II. Over the
next 3 years, he retracted the denial of political
and civil rights to the Roman Catholic minority.
The Glorious Revolution that followed signaled
the beginning of a new era in English criminal
justice history. As the landed classes rose as one
against the monarchy, James fled the country, leav-
ing his Protestant daughter Mary and her husband
William the throne.
In 1689, before the Parliament offered the
Crown to William III and Mary II, it required their
support for a bill of rights. For the first time in
English history, Parliament decided who should
succeed to the throne. Its impact would reach to
the American colonies in the next century. Follow-
ing this bloodless revolution, the power of absolute
monarchy diminished in favor of a constitutional
monarchy in which Parliament played an important
role. In this new constitutional system, the judiciary
was independent of the executive and legislative
branches. The rights of all subjects would be pro-
tected regardless of one’s status. Henceforth, it was
illegal for the Crown to levy taxes or to raise or
keep a standing army in peacetime without the
consent of Parliament. According to the English
Bill of Rights, individuals had the right to a speedy
trial, the right of freedom from arbitrary arrest, the
right to a jury trial, and the right of petition. And
almost exactly 100 years later, the American Bill of
Rights repeated word for word from its British
forerunner that “excessive bail ought not to be re-
quired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and
unusual punishments inflicted.”
Thief Taking
In 1692, the profession of thief taking (bounty hunt-
ing) was inaugurated by the Act for Encouraging the
Apprehending of Highwaymen.16 Without a public
police force and suffering a tremendous outlaw
problem, the English government began offering a
40-pound reward for the arrest and successful prose-
cution of any highwayman. In addition, thief takers
were entitled to the highwayman’s horse, harness,
arms, and other possessions, unless they proved to
be stolen. Initially, thief takers were bandits who
turned in accomplices for the promised blood money
(reward). However, despite the best intentions of the
Highwayman Act, highway robbery continued un-
abated. Closer to medieval-style policing, thief tak-
ing was completely ineffective in tracking down
criminals beyond parish boundaries. It was more ef-
fective on the local level.
In 1715, underworld boss Jonathan Wild ele-
vated thief taking to a science and over the next 10
years was credited with sending over 100 criminals
to the London gallows. His exploits earned him the
title “thief-taker general,” even though he eventu-
ally followed his colleagues to the gallows himself
in 1725. Most police historians consider thief taking
a precursor to the 1740s Bow Street Runners of Sir
Henry Fielding (see Chapter 3). According to one
historian, “Nature intended Jonathan Wild for a
sleuth, and had he been born two centuries later
it is probable that he would have won a responsible
position at Scotland Yard.”17
As the leading criminal of London in the first half of the
eighteenth century, Jonathan Wild (1682–1725) domi-
nated the London underworld from 1715 until his death
in 1725. During the 1720s, London suffered one of its
worst crime waves. Since most powerful criminals were
protected from prosecution through bribes and graft, the
only response the government could muster was to begin
paying rewards for the capture of robbers and prescribe
the death penalty for most offenses. After a criminal ap-
prenticeship to the London city marshal, who taught him
the trade of receiving stolen goods, Wild set up an office
near the Old Bailey, where he acted as agent between
thief and victim.
A master at self-promotion, Wild called himself
thief-taker general by 1718. Wild exploited the law to the
fullest, and his posse of thief catchers is considered by
many a precursor to police departments. For 10 years, he
was considered the most efficient gang breaker in
England. Wild improved an ingenious system for
receiving stolen goods developed by Moll Cutpurse18 in
ENGLISH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ANTECEDENTS (570–1725)
41

the previous century that involved getting higher prices
for stolen goods by selling them back to the original
owners who were willing to pay more. Wild improved on
the system by posing first as a private thief taker who
went after offenders to subsequently collect a reward
once the objects were returned. He then organized bands
of thieves whom he directed in his various schemes. Any
thieves who attempted to compete with him he would
set up for arrest and execution. Therefore, by aiding the
law in his capacity as thief taker, Wild used the law to
fatten his own coffers. Highwaymen gave London a wide
berth between 1723 and 1725, as evidenced by the fact
none were hanged at Tyburn during this time span.
In 1718, anti–thief taker legislation was passed, ele-
vating thief taking to a felony—a capital offense. Over
the next 7 years, Wild enjoyed the protection of influen-
tial patrons, survived an assassination attempt, and had
acquired extensive real estate holdings. Despite suppor-
ters who argued that he helped control the gang prob-
lem, Wild was hanged in 1725.
NOTABLE TRIALS
Guy Fawkes (1606)
During the early seventeenth century, Protestant-
ism was firmly entrenched as the state church in
England. Under James I, both Catholics and Puri-
tans felt the sting of oppression. When the Anglican
clergy noted that their congregations were dwin-
dling, James ordered Catholic priests to leave the
country. Naturally incensed, Catholics hatched
the desperate Gunpowder Plot, hoping to reclaim
the Crown and country. The Gunpowder Plot,
which was probably hatched in 1604, was the
brainchild of Robert Catesby, who suggested to
several others that Catholics could seize power in
one fell swoop by blowing up Parliament when it
met on November 5, 1605. On that day, King
James I and members of the House of Commons
and the House of Lords would be assembled, and in
the resulting chaos the plotters hoped to establish a
Catholic government.
One of the plotters traveled to the Continent
to recruit aid from British Catholics in exile.
Among those who jumped at the chance to restore
Catholicism was a dashing young man named Guy
Fawkes (ca. 1570–1606). Having assembled their
cast of conspirators, the plotters next rented a house
next to Parliament and continued with their plan to
detonate the building with gunpowder. In October
1605, a letter was delivered to the king warning
him not to attend the forthcoming session of Par-
liament. The conspirators soon fled, leaving only
Fawkes behind to complete the plan. He either
had been assigned or had volunteered to ignite
the explosion minutes before making his own es-
cape. On November 4, Fawkes was arrested before
the plan could take effect. Three days later, four
conspirators were killed and several arrested, tried,
and executed.
The trial of Guy Fawkes and seven others be-
gan on January 27, 1606. The conspirators stood in
Star Chamber waiting for the arrival of the judges.
After the indictment was read out, the eight
pleaded not guilty. The first lawyer to speak for
the Crown noted that the matter before the court
was one of treason, “but of such horror, and mon-
strous nature.” In the subsequent proceedings, ev-
ery attempt was made to tarnish the Catholic
Church by implicating it in the plot. All the con-
spirators
eventually
confessed
to
treason
after
lengthy torture and questioning in the Tower of
London. According to protocol in treason trials in
this era, it was customary for the defense not to
offer any testimony. The defendants were then
asked if they had anything to say as to why the
sentence of death should not be pronounced against
them. Several asked for mercy. In a day of quick
justice and little time for appeals, on January 29,
1606, just two days after the trial, four of the men
were dragged lying on their backs to the scaffold at
St. Paul’s churchyard for the traditional punishment
for treason: being hanged, drawn, and quartered. If
an individual committed murder, he was usually
hanged, unless it was an aristocrat, in which case
he was beheaded. The only offense considered
worse than murder was high treason, which
was considered the equivalent of murdering one’s
country
by
killing
or
plotting
to
kill
the
nation’s sovereign lord, the king. The following
day,
Guy
Fawkes
was
among
the
last
four
executed.

Until the eighteenth century, convicted traitors in many
parts of western Europe were hanged, drawn, and quar-
tered. The prisoner was typically drawn to the place of
execution on a hurdle. Then he was hanged until almost
dead. He was then cut down, and the real terror began.
The victim, still alive and conscious in most cases, was
next disemboweled. Occasionally, this was preceded by
castration to symbolize that the traitor would be unable
to sire future traitors. The bowels and entrails were then
burned, and the victim was beheaded and quartered into
four parts. At the conclusion of the public spectacle, the
body parts were mounted on the city gates as a warning
to future traitors. The head would be parboiled before
being exhibited on London Bridge for deterrence value.
There is a certain mystery as to why Fawkes
became a legendary figure. Perhaps it was because
he did not flee with the others or had volunteered
for the most dangerous task. Although never carried
out, the Gunpowder Plot revived the old fear of
Catholics and of papist conspiracy. Fawkes’s display
of courage under painful torture and his position as
an almost legendary malefactor is celebrated each
November 5 in Great Britain with fireworks dis-
plays and bonfires.
CONCLUSIONS
Placed in historical perspective, the signing of the
Magna Carta in 1215 was preceded by Germanic
invasions and followed by the Renaissance. It sig-
naled an era that would witness the erection of the
great European cathedrals and an age of faith
marked by the Crusades. The growth of an urban
economy gave rise to towns, commerce, markets,
and fairs as European civilization expanded in all
directions. The thirteenth century witnessed the
birth of Parliament and rising crime rates in Eng-
land. Universities flourished in Oxford, Paris, and
Salerno. In a society dominated by the church and
theology, craft and merchant guilds prospered;
windmills, mechanical clocks, and eyeglasses soon
became commonplace; and hard liquor was distilled
in Salerno.
Although the Tudor era saw great strides in the
development of criminal justice institutions, torture
and confinement still characterized the treatment of
defendants. British subjects had acquired certain ba-
sic rights, but much was ill defined and arbitrary.
The Norman era introduced many of the proto-
types that would become familiar components of
the American criminal justice system, ranging
from constables, coroners, bailiffs, and justices of
the peace to the sheriff and the marshal. Mean-
while, Parliament saw a steady development from
the innovations of Edward I to the Stuart Restora-
tion in 1660, when the House of Lords and Com-
mons began to organize as separate branches of
Parliament. At this point, the power of the Com-
moners increased quickly as the social distinction
between lords and commoners diminished. Helping
bring the classes closer together was the evolution
of the English language, which integrated the
French of the Normans with the German of the
Anglo-Saxons.
The position of bailiff as an officer of the court devel-
oped out of the Statute of Winchester of 1285, in which
King Edward endeavored to create a uniform law en-
forcement system. Initially responsible for tracking tran-
sient strangers in medieval towns after dark, today’s
bailiff is responsible mainly for keeping order in the court
and protecting the security of jury members during
deliberations.
Point–Counterpoint
Trial by Ordeal and the Fourth Lateran Council:
Determining Guilt or Innocence (1215)
Prior to the thirteenth century there were few methods for
determining the guilt or innocence of suspected criminals. In
the years leading up to the Fourth Lateran Council, most
communities relied on the time-tested methods of trial by
ordeal or battle or the compurgation oath. Such “judgements
of God” were accepted by most members of the community,

since there was little if any protocol that could be confused
with trial by jury.
In 1215 church leaders convening for the Fourth La-
teran Council forbade clergy members from taking part in the
ordeal. Although the curtailment of such practices in most of
Europe was gradual, the ordeals were almost immediately
ended in England. The decline of the ordeal was a turning
point in the history of adjudication procedure. Subsequently,
the English common law system would adopt the adversarial
jury trial, while continental Europe leaned toward an in-
quisitorial system. The first passage describes the variety of
ordeals popular since before the Norman Conquest of 1066.
The second passage illustrates the persistence of trial by battle
and oath helpers as a method of determining guilt or inno-
cence. Notice that the “normal” number of oath helpers was
12, a harbinger of the future jury system.
The ordeal was more extensively employed in
the procedure of the pre-Norman period than
in the later. It was the typical mode of trial among
the English, contrasting English procedure with the
procedure of their Norman conquerors. With them
it was, until the Conquest, the only Judicium Dei so
far as existing monuments bear witness.
Thismodeoftrialfinallyreceivedafatalblowfrom
the well-known decree of the Lateran Council of the
year 1215, at which it was ordered that the ordeal
should be discontinued throughout Christendom.
There were four forms of ordeal, to wit, by cold
water, by hot water, by hot iron, and by morsel
or “corsnaed.” The first two were in the time of
Glanvill for the poor and partly unfree classes, the
“rustics”; the third was for the lay freemen; whilst the
last, as we have seen, was for the clergy. The accused,
however, appears to have had an election at one time
between the modes by fire and by water. Whether this
was true in the twelfth century is doubtful.
Each was undergone after the most solemn reli-
gious ceremonial. In the case of the cold water ordeal,
a fast of three days duration was first submitted to in
the presence of a priest; then the accused was brought
into the church, where a mass was chanted, followed
by the communion. Before communion, however,
the accused was adjured by the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost, by the Christian Religion which he professed,
by the only begotten Son, by the Holy Trinity, by the
Holy Gospels, and by the Holy Relics, not to partake
of the communion if he was guilty. Communion
having been partaken, adjuratio aquae is made by the
priest in which the water is asked to cast forth the
accused if guilty, and to receive him into its depths
if innocent. After these ceremonies, the accused is
stripped, kisses the book and the cross, is sprinkled
with holy water, and then cast into the depths. If he
sank he was adjudged not guilty; if he swam he was
pronounced guilty.
Similar religious ceremonies were performed in
the other forms of ordeal. If the accuser elected for
the accused the trial by hot water, the water was
placed in a vessel and heated to the highest degree.
Then if the party were accused of an inferior crime,
he plunged his arm into the water as far as the wrist
and brought forth a stone suspended by a cord; if he
were accused of a great crime, the stone was sus-
pended deeper, so as to require him to plunge his
arm as far as his elbow. The hand of the accused was
then bandaged and at the end of three days the
bandage was removed. If it now appeared that the
wound was healed, the accused was deemed inno-
cent, but if it had festered he was held guilty.
If trial by hot iron was elected, a piece of iron
weighing either one or three pounds, according to
the nature of the crime charged, was heated under
the direction of men standing by, whose duty it
was to see that a proper heat was obtained, and
kept until the time for the test had arrived. During
the final ceremonies the fire was left and the iron
allowed to remain in the embers. It was raised and
with an invocation to the Deity, given into the naked
hand of the accused, who carried it the distance of
nine feet when it was dropped, and the hand ban-
daged as in the case of the hot water ordeal to abide
by the same test.
The ordeal of the morsel, accompanied by sim-
ilar ceremonials, was undergone by the accused un-
dertaking to swallow a piece of barley bread or a
piece of cheese of the weight of an ounce; if he
succeeded
without
serious
difficulty,
he
was
deemed innocent, but if he choked and grew black
in the face he was deemed guilty.
Then came a sudden change. The Lateran
Council of 1215 forbad the clergy to take part in

the ceremony. Some wise churchmen had long
protested against it; but perhaps the conflict with
flagrant heresy and the consequent exacerbation of
ecclesiastical law had something to do with the sup-
pression of this old test. In England this decree
found a prompt obedience such as it hardly found
elsewhere; the ordeal was abolished at once and for
ever. Flourishing in the last records of John’s reign,
we can not find it in any later rolls. Our criminal
procedure was deprived of its handiest weapon; but
to this catastrophe we must return hereafter.
The judicial combat is an ordeal, a bilateral or-
deal. The church had shown less favour to it than to
the unilateral ordeals, perhaps because it had in-
volved pagan ceremonies. Therefore we hear noth-
ing of it until the Normans bring it hither. In later
days English ecclesiastics had no deep dislike for it.
It was a sacral process. What triumphed was not
brute force but truth. The combatant who was
worsted was a convicted perjurer.
The ordeal involves or is preceded by an oath;
but even when the proof is to consist merely of
oaths, a supernatural element is present. The
swearer satisfies human justice by taking the oath.
If he has sworn falsely, he is exposed to the wrath of
God and in some subsequent proceeding may per-
haps be convicted of perjury; but in the meantime
he has performed the task that the law set him; he
has given the requisite proof. In some rare cases a
defendant was allowed to swear away a charge by
his own oath; usually what was required of him was
an oath supported by the oaths of oath-helpers.
There are good reasons for believing that in the
earliest period he had to find kinsmen as oath-
helpers. When he was denying an accusation
which, if not disproved, would have been cause
for a blood-feud, his kinsmen had a lively interest
in the suit, and naturally they were called upon to
assist him in freeing himself and them from the
consequences of the imputed crime. The plaintiff,
if he thought that there had been perjury, would
have the satisfaction of knowing that some twelve
of his enemies were devoted to divine vengeance.
In course of time the law no longer required kins-
men, and we see a rationalistic tendency which
would convert the oath-helpers into impartial ‘wit-
nesses to character.’ Sometimes the chief swearer
must choose them from among a number of men
designated by the court or by his opponent; some-
times they must be his neighbours. Then again, in-
stead of swearing positively that his oath is true,
they may swear that it is true to the best of their
knowledge. In some cases few, in others many
helpers are demanded. A normal number is 12;
but this may be reduced to 6 or 3, or raised to
24, 36, 72.

CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
1.
Discuss the development of law enforcement in
England during the Anglo-Saxon and Norman
periods. How did the Norman invasion impact
the evolution of English peacekeeping?
2.
Which culture had the most impact on the
development of English criminal justice insti-
tutions? Discuss in terms of German, French,
and Danish influence.
3.
What was the role of the church in the English
criminal justice system? What were some of the
differences between canon and secular law?
4.
Trace the evolution of the legal system in
England between the Norman Conquest
(1066) and the English Bill of Rights (1689).
5.
Why is the reign of King Henry II considered a
turning point in the history of the English legal
system?
6.
Discuss patterns of criminal activity and vio-
lence in England between the Norman period
and the emergence of the thief takers in the
seventeenth century.
7.
Choose several English legal documents and
discuss their impact on English criminal justice
(Statute of Winchester, Magna Carta, English
Bill of Rights, and so on).
8.
Why are the thief takers considered progenitors
of modern policing?
NOTES
1. The Angles came from southern Denmark, the
Saxons from continental Germany, and the Jutes
from Jutland.
2. The most convincing explanation for the origin of
the term hundred was that this unit comprised 100
households or perhaps was responsible for furnishing
100 men for the national defense.
3. Only the laws of Kent and Wessex from this era
have survived.
4. The word felony is probably derived either from the
Latin fel, meaning “one filled with venom,” or from
fee (property held under feudal tenure) and lon
(price), suggesting that there is a price or loss of
property if one commits a crime.
5. The assize, which literally means “a sitting” in
Norman French, was a twice-yearly royal court
held in each county, normally at the county
town. This procedure is credited with establishing
the practice of local citizens forming grand juries
to present the accused for trial by the traveling
justices.
6. Merryman (1969, pp. 10–11).
7. In the time of Edward III, benefit of clergy was not
available for highway robbers, and in 1531 it was
prohibited in cases of robbery and murder. Benefit
of clergy was finally abolished for all crimes in
1841.
8. There are several explanations for the title of this
survey. One contemporary writer implied that the
inquiry was so all-encompassing and inquisitive that
it reminded people of the day of judgment, hence
“Domesday.” Others speculate that the hundreds
convened for inquests on the Domesdays, or
lawdays.

11. This phrase was misconstrued from the phrase prison
forte et dure. According to tradition, the accused was
tortured until entering a plea at arraignment. Al-
though the last fatal use of this torture occurred in
1658, the practice was not discontinued until 1772,
when it was replaced by a simple plea of guilty.
12. A warrior as well as a lawmaker, Edward’s legacy in
popular culture seems to be his brutal execution of
William Wallace of Hollywood’s Braveheart fame.
13. It got its name because of its interior design, which
included a painted wooden ceiling replete with
painted stars.
14. Murdrum is derived from morth, which means “secret
killing.”
15. Meaning “you have the body,” the writ of habeas
corpus was designed to aid those wrongfully impri-
soned. The writ ordered any official who is holding
another in confinement to bring “the body” into
court to establish whether the confinement is legal.
16. English highwaymen operated on horseback
and usually wore masks during their robberies
committed on the roads leading into London. Most
sources suggest that highwaymen killed fewer vic-
tims than their horseless counterparts because of
their ability to escape quickly. Although they occa-
sionally engaged in gun battles with their victims or
soldiers, treacherous accomplices and informers
represented a far greater danger.
17. Bleackley (1929, p. 47).
18. Born Mary Frith in 1584, from a young age she
dressed like a man, carried a sword, and smoked a
pipe as she made the rounds of local taverns. She
became so adept at a ruse by which she cut the strings
on leather purses that were used in the sixteenth
century to carry valuables that she was accorded the
sobriquet “Moll Cutpurse.” Despite a life of crime in
which she was branded four times on the hands as a
thief, she lived until 1659, well into her 70s.

The history of American criminal justice begins with
the transplanting of European institutions to the
New World. While several Spanish communities
existed in parts of what is now the United States
decades prior to the first permanent English settle-
ments in Jamestown and Plymouth, they did not
contribute much to the development of American
criminal justice institutions. Initially, the history
of colonial criminal justice is the story of 13 separate
colonies prior to the American Revolution and
independence in 1776. The criminal codes, law
enforcement systems, courts, and punishments re-
sembled those of England, Holland, Spain, and
France, depending on the colony. The development
of American criminal justice is the story of the mod-
ification of this heritage. To understand the history
of the American criminal justice system, it is neces-
sary to appreciate the remarkable diversity of colo-
nial America.
The first steps toward English colonization of
North America were taken not by the Crown but
by private enterprise. Because of the high costs as-
sociated with establishing a colony, the English
monarchy could not afford to colonize on its
own. Instead, the Crown was content to sit back
as a passive partner in the endeavor, a role that
would later come back to haunt the English in
the subsequent American Revolution. Except
for granting charters, contracts, trade rights, and
permitting migration, English officialdom let mer-
chant entrepreneurs, Anglicans, Puritans, Catholics,
and
Quakers
lay
the
foundations
of
early
America.
An examination of the development of crimi-
nal justice in each of the 13 colonies is beyond the
scope and aim of this chapter. Instead, the focus will
be on an important colony representing each of
three colonial regions—regions that were cultur-
ally, politically, and socioeconomically
similar.
Virginia represents the southern colonies. Pennsyl-
vania exemplifies many of the characteristics of the
middle colonies, and Massachusetts personifies the
complexities of life in colonial New England.
Those drawn to Virginia had economic ambitions,
while mainly religious idealism motivated those
who came to early New England and Pennsylvania.
Each immigrant group required discipline and
order to realize its goals. Since the colonists were

recruited in different ways and lived in divergent
conditions of climate and soil, it should not be
surprising then that the laws and customs of the
colonies were quite diverse.
During the 1600s, England was awash in polit-
ical and religious upheaval, both of which would
influence the structure of the English colonies as
well as their developing criminal justice systems.
Religious persecution in England proved a particu-
larly powerful motivating force for colonization in
the early years of the American colonies. Roman
Catholics found a haven in Maryland, while Quak-
ers sought refuge in Pennsylvania, southern New
Jersey, and Rhode Island. Nearly 30,000 English
Puritans, technically part of the official Church of
England, immigrated to New England. Other reli-
gious minorities migrated from continental Europe
seeking sanctuary from oppression as well.
Not all newcomersto America came of their own
accord. In 1615, King James I introduced transporta-
tion, or banishment, as one way to rid England of its
hordes of convicts and “sturdy beggars.” Offenders
were not shipped to places unknown or to freedom
but weresentto English colonies to perform profitable
service. Between 1718 and 1776, close to 30,000
British convicts were transported to the American col-
onies. Mostly male and in their 20s, not unlike their
twenty-first-century incarcerated counterparts, the
majority were destined for the Chesapeake plantations
of Maryland and Virginia. At only a third of the price
of an African slave, white indentured servants were
affordable to the smaller planters, much to the dismay
of the large plantation owners who protested the sys-
tem. An alternative to branding, hanging, mutilation,
and execution at home, transportation marked an
important transition in penal practice and provided
a much-needed labor source to the developing
colonies.
Indentured servants arrived in America after
signing a contract in which they agreed to work any-
where from 4 to 7 years without wages in exchange
for transportation to America. A servant’s contract
could be bought and sold without his consent, and
he could be beaten fordisobedience orrunning away.
In the early years, on completion of their terms of
indenture, servants received 50 acres of land and,
later, cash, clothing, and food. Beginning with the
first African slaves in the early 1600s, the institution
of racial slavery evolved slowly in the seventeenth-
century colonies. By the 1680s, there was a shortage
of white indentured servants, leading to dependence
on African slavery. By the 1680s, it would be the
preferred form of labor on the plantations.
The English colonists who ventured to America
in the early seventeenth century were used to a
rigid social system and determined to maintain order
among themselves at any cost. The structure of each
colony would later influence not only what crimes
would be punished but also how punishment would
be meted out. Early colonial communities were tiny
villages, worlds to themselves where everyone knew
each other’s business. Many authorities suggest that
you could fit the entire European population of
1650s America inside a modern sports complex. No
scandal was too small to incur the wrath of the
community.
Despite a number of experiments with religious
laws and political compacts, the only source of gov-
ernment that was regarded as legitimate was one that
recognized the Crown as the source of all legitimate
authority. Thus, colonial institutions mirrored the
government in England. Each colony had a gover-
nor, usually appointed (several were elected) by the
king and in a sense corresponding to the monarch, as
well as a governor’s council, or upper house of the
legislature, that was appointed by the monarch and
corresponded to the hereditary House of Lords. And
each had an elected lower house of the legislature,
selected by voters who had to meet various property,
race, gender, and age qualifications. The variety and
complexion of the colonial courts wasso complicated
that they almost defy description.

pany a charter to establish a colony in the New

World. According to the document, the inhabitants
of the colony would enjoy “all liberties, franchises,
and immunities … as if they had been abiding and
borne within this realme of Englande.” On May 13,
1607, English common law dropped anchor on
the banks of the James River in Virginia in the
form of 104 English colonists. No one could have
then imagined the degree to which the common
law would be altered in the new land. The transmu-
tation of legal codes and procedures was in part due
to the new environment and harsh living conditions.
Indians, disease, lack of discipline, and distance from
the motherland, in time, gave birth to criminal justice
procedures significantly different from those that
landed on American shores with the first English
colonists.
The founding of Jamestown was a venture fi-
nanced as a short-term joint stock company, each
investor sharing the costs, risks, and profits that
Virginia might yield. Members of the early Virginia
Company were an assortment of gentlemen, ser-
vants, and vagrants. They settled in the New World
hoping to make a profit for the company and for
the Crown and to improve their own prospects at
the same time. After agreeing to work for the com-
pany for 7 years to pay for their passage over, the
servants were free to seek their own fortunes.
The Virginia colonists found neither gold nor
silver as the Spanish had previously. Unprepared, ill
supplied, and sickly from the confines of ship travel,
survivors of the passage continued to perish in the
hostile climate. Tropical disease, poor nutrition, and
outright starvation ensured that since debarking,
about four in five, regardless of rank or race, died
within the first year. Rations were in such short
supply that one of the first recorded executions in
the colonies resulted from one man’s murdering of
his wife and unborn child for the purposes of
cannibalism.
Instead of precious metals, Virginians’ wealth
would come from the cultivation of tobacco.
With the introduction of this moneymaking crop,
settlers refused to grow anything else. A “boom-
town” mentality took root in which the single
men of the colony, at least the few who were
healthy enough, lay about the streets in a raucous
display of drinking and gambling. Before resorting
to slavery in the late seventeenth century, a large
labor force of white indentured male servants was
required to harvest the tobacco crops, resulting in a
ratio of from four to six men for every one woman.
These conditions contrasted sharply with New
England’s settlement by families. The contrasts
would also be reflected in criminal justice develop-
ments in the first colonies of each region: Virginia
in the South and Massachusetts in New England.
The Lawgivers
Initially, Virginia was supposed to be governed by a
royal council appointed by the king. Few could
have predicted that the small band of settlers would
fashion their own government. By the eighteenth
century, all colonies, except for one, had bicameral
legislatures like the English Parliament. The upper
house, or council as it was known, consisted of
between 12 and 18 members appointed by the
Crown or other high-ranking officials, such as the
colony’s governor. Usually members of the landed
gentry and the elite, they were the dominant group
of the colony. The lower house was an elected body,
selected from the smaller, propertied class. Voting
privileges were initially restricted to free white Eng-
lishmen who were heads of households. This left a
large portion of inhabitants and dependents, includ-
ing tenant farmers, indentured servants, laborers,
blacks, artisans, and women disenfranchised with lit-
tle voice in political life.
The first representative assembly held in America
was convened at Jamestown’s House of Burgesses
in 1619. Each of Virginia’s 11 settlements sent
two representatives who sat with the governor and
his Council. A miniature Parliament, the initial con-
vocation introduced “Blue Laws” prohibiting drunk-
enness, gambling, idleness, “excess in apparel,”
absence from church, and sundry misdemeanors.
During the six-day meeting of the first assembly,
the Church of England was proclaimed the estab-
lishedchurch,and theVirginia Company wassolicited
for financial assistance to establish a college. In short
order, Virginia made the transition from martial
law (1611–1616) to a self-governing community,

laying the foundation for genuine democracy.
However, it would prove a false start by 1624,
when the Crown revoked the Virginia Company
Charter and took over Virginia as a royal colony.
The blue laws, introduced in seventeenth-century colonial
America to regulate activities on Sundays, were so-named
after the blue paper the laws were printed on. These laws
usually targeted unacceptable public behavior such as
drunkenness and excesses in clothing. Modern-day blue
laws are just as likely to restrict alcohol sales, auto sales,
hunting, or other activities on Sunday (although you can
still rent pornographic videos that same day). During the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a prohibition move-
ment introduced more restrictive laws including bans on
cigarette sales and entertainment, including books,
movies, and plays. In 1961, the U.S. Supreme Court up-
held the rights of states to enact blue laws as long as the
purpose was not religious. Today there is increased sup-
port to repeal blue laws in Texas, Colorado, and else-
where. Supporters cite the desire to boost revenues and
increase consumer convenience, whereas opponents cite
religious and family concerns and believe six days a week
gives plenty of time to buy liquor. The move to change
blue laws related to alcohol was given a boost when New
Year’s Eve and Christmas both fell on Sundays in 2006.
Although 34 states permit Sunday alcohol sales, in 2007
proposals to lift the restriction were defeated in Georgia,
Missouri, Tennessee, and Minnesota.
Within two decades of their arrival, Virginia
colonists had adapted English criminal justice prac-
tices to the New World. Although most procedures
dealing with indictment, arrest, bail, trial, judg-
ment, and execution of sentence were familiar to
any Englishman, alterations were made to these tra-
ditional processes. For example, during the early
years of Virginia, the court system changed. While
the county courts tried minor criminal cases, felony
cases were heard at the General Court, which con-
vened in Jamestown. But traveling to Jamestown
could be a hardship for slave owners from the more
far-flung reaches of the colony. A specialized type
of court, called Oyer and Terminer, was created to
handle serious criminal complaints involving slaves.
These special courts were held specifically to try
slaves accused of capital offenses in county courts.
Here we see an example of how the institution of
slavery and the widely dispersed population con-
tributed to the modification of criminal justice pro-
cedures in America.
The status of blacks in colonial Virginia was
incredibly complicated. Initially, some were inden-
tured servants who were allowed to own property
and marry and testify against whites in court once
free of their indentures. In rare instances, free blacks
even purchased white indentured servants. A few
arrived free, one even owning a slave himself. But
most were permanently unfree. Virginia passed the
first statute revealing the central position of slavery
in the colonies in 1660. In a rather simple state-
ment, the law identified a class of blacks as servants
for life. Any white servant who attempted to escape
with one of these servants for life was expected to
serve the same amount of time as his accomplice
after being captured, in essence creating a few
white slaves. The subsequent passage of the Virginia
Slave Code of 1705 was one of the first slave codes
in the South and established slavery as essentially
race based and an integral part of the plantation
economy. This Slave Code also contained provi-
sions concerning the murder and torture of slaves,
the legal status of children born to enslaved women,
restrictions for interactions with nonslaves, and
penalties for failing to obey commands. In perhaps
the most draconian section of the code, escaped
slaves could be dismembered if returned home
alive.
According to Michael Stephen Hindus, al-
though blacks were “accorded few procedural
rights in the courts,” a “formal system of trying
slaves shows that despite plantation justice, formal
law and authority reached the plantation to a con-
siderable extent.”1 As evidence, Hindus cites the
basic slave law of South Carolina. Established in
1740, it continued as the basic penal code for blacks
until the end of the Civil War in the 1860s. The
South Carolina code typified southern law for this
era. Prohibited from offering sworn testimony,
blacks were also not permitted to initiate prosecu-
tions, unless it was done by a free third party. While
all white laws applied to blacks, there were many
others that only applied to blacks. Crimes such as
assault with intent to rape, wounding a white man,

burning crops, attempted poisoning, and insurrec-
tion were all capital crimes for black slaves. Punish-
ment for white offenders who committed similar
crimes was usually less punitive.
Blacks received some protections under the
1740 law code. Brutal treatment was prohibited,
and any person who killed a slave was fined 700
pounds. By the 1820s, when the killing of slaves
became more common, it became a capital offense,
leading a court justice to submit that this action
“elevated slaves from chattels personal to human
beings.”2
By the 1660s and 1670s, servants and slaves
became more clearly defined within the legal
code. Black slaves were barred from interracial mar-
riage and sexual relations and prohibited from trav-
eling or owning weapons without written permits.
Slaves were even forbidden to learn to read or
write. If a slave was caught learning to write, the
slave would have a finger amputated. In 1669,
Virginia won the distinction as the first colony to
allow the killing of “rambunctious” slaves without
fear of criminal sanctions. At that same time, slave
masters were forbidden to free slaves unless they left
the colony when freed. Any white person who
married a nonwhite individual was banished from
the colony. As the components of racial slavery be-
came more rigid, white servants were enjoying
more privileges. In contrast to their former black
counterparts in bondage, white servants could no
longer be stripped and publicly whipped.
Crime and Punishment
The early years of the Virginia colony were lean
ones, rife with poor health, starvation, discord,
Indian conflict, and mutinous conditions. Circum-
stances dictated law codes more severe than com-
mon law, and from its earliest days colonial
authorities relied on brutal corporal punishments
and hangings. When Sir Thomas Dale succeeded
Captain John Smith (ca. 1580–1631) as leader of
the colony in 1611, he instituted martial discipline
and the law code titled Lawes, Divine, Morall and
Martiall, known as “Dale’s Laws.” The harshness
of the law code has led some commentators to
draw parallels with Draco’s code of ancient Athens.
Not only were the colonists expected to attend
daily church services under penalty of 6 months’
service in the galleys of Virginia company ships,
but repeated absence from Sunday services could
elicit the death penalty. On one occasion, a Virginia
colonist was severely punished for making false
charges against another colonist. As punishment,
the offender was sentenced to be “disarmed and
have his arms broken and his tongue bored through
with an awl” and was then forced to walk through
a gauntlet of 40 men and battered by each one.
Finally, the unfortunate individual was kicked out
of the fort and banished from the vicinity.3
Under Dale’s Laws, capital punishment was
mandated for almost two dozen offenses, including
repeated blasphemy, unlicensed trading with the
Indian tribes, stealing boats, embezzlement, the un-
licensed killing of cattle, and the destruction of
crops. Punishments for even minor violations
were barbaric under the military courts, with ac-
counts of individuals being burned at the stake,
broken on the wheel, and bound to a tree with a
bodkin thrust through the tongue and left to starve
to death.
In 1618, a more moderate law code was intro-
duced, but before the Enlightenment of the eigh-
teenth century and the creation of the penitentiary
system, there were few alternatives to the tradition
of harsh corporal punishment and hanging. Public
shaming, or exhibitory punishment, was often ef-
fective in curbing petty crime. Criminals that placed
a burden on society, such as drunkards, vagrants,
and other ne’er-do-wells, were treated as a serious
threat to the community. Malefactors were forced
to sit in the stocks or stand in pillories or offer pub-
lic penance in church for violating conventional
moral standards. As in the medieval past, women
were often punished using local water sources.
The ducking stool astride a prominent riverbank
saw frequent use when women acted outside their
traditional gender roles. The most frequent offenses
committed by women included “bad speeches” or
verbal abuse. The aegis of guilt fell more readily on
women in cases of fornication and adultery since
pregnancy outside the confines of marriage was

sure witness to the act. Women who committed
bastardy, or childbirth outside marriage, were also
harshly punished in the Chesapeake colonies. If the
recent mother could not afford to pay a fine, she
was liable to be publicly whipped while naked to
the waist. Adultery was a serious crime but only for
women because it was defined in terms of the wo-
man’s status. If she was married, illicit sex was con-
sidered adultery; if she was unmarried, it was
fornication even if her partner was married. Infan-
ticide and witchcraft were also mainly the domain
of females. However, no woman was ever executed
for witchcraft in Virginia and the southern colonies.
One way to contrast the punishment of sexual
offenses in New England and Virginia is to examine
the punishment for adultery. In Massachusetts, both
parties received equal punishment, while in the
Chesapeake, women were punished more se-
verely. In some cases, women were either flogged
or dragged in the water behind a boat until almost
drowned. In this case, adultery was less a threat to
marriage than to bloodlines, which were impor-
tant in colonial Virginia.
When it came to capital punishment, the
harshest sanctions were also found in the southern
colonies. In order to control a large labor force of
indentured servants and slaves, the entrepreneurial
planters of Virginia and other southern colonies fos-
tered codes designed to frighten rebellious slaves
and forestall any uprisings. The first 20 Africans
reached Virginia in 1619, signaling more than three
centuries of hardship for the black South. Slave
owners were initially given free rein to punish their
slaves just as they were with indentured servants.
Since slaves were always a valuable commodity,
punishments were designed not to incapacitate but
to teach a lesson. Mutilation, whippings, and other
corporal punishments were administered quickly
and visibly to set an example and not interfere
with agricultural work.
By the 1700s, the African slave population was
soaring, and white colonists feared insurrection, real
or imagined. Slave laws proscribed execution for
slaves who attacked their masters. Punishments
revolving around rumors of slave rebellions were
always harsh and public and like their English coun-
terparts were designed to demonstrate the power of
the state.
Unlike the more religiously oriented colonies
founded just a few years later, the sting of punish-
ment fell disproportionately on the lower classes in
the southern colonies. The wealthier felons were
often branded with a cold iron so as not to dishonor
their reputations. While the poor and the illiterate
went to the gallows, their landed and more literate
neighbors could plead “benefit of clergy” by recit-
ing the age-old neck verse from the Bible and get
off with a stiff reprimand and a brand on the
thumb.
In the Chesapeake South, the county court
played an integral part in the developing criminal
justice system. Here the landed gentry presided at
court much like their forefathers at their manor
courts. Here accusations were leveled at defendants
in front of juries composed of a cross-section of the
inhabitants. Run-of-the-mill offenses monopolized
the court docket—fighting, swearing, failing to at-
tend church, and slander kept the grand juries most
busy. In most cases, the defendant would eventually
plead guilty, and the court would arrange for two
people to put up a bond of surety to guarantee
against recidivism.
On July 10, 2006, Virginia Governor Timothy M. Kaine
gave an informal pardon to Grace Sherwood, who had
been executed for witchcraft 300 years earlier. She was
the only Virginian to be executed as a witch using evi-
dence from trial by water. The so-called witch of Pungo
wore men’s clothes and was thought by neighbors to be
responsible for their dead livestock and failing crops.
Sherwood appeared in court numerous times to fight
charges against her and to pursue slander charges against
her neighbors.

tans’ main goal was to purify or purge the Church

of England of its Roman Catholic tendencies. In
1609, another group, later known as the Pilgrims,
who refused to conform to the Church of England,
which they felt was corrupt, actually separated from
the official church. Fearing persecution, they fled to
Holland, a country known for its religious tolera-
tion. After more than a decade, some of the sepa-
ratist families, fearing that their children were
becoming too assimilated to Dutch ways, decided
to migrate to America. They were able to secure
permission to settle in Virginia. Following a series
of storms and misadventures, the Pilgrims aboard
the Mayflower were blown off course and ended
up founding the Plymouth colony in November
1620, the first permanent European settlement in
Massachusetts. They had not disembarked blindly,
having been provided with a map by the explorer
and Virginia pioneer John Smith, who not only
named the region “New England” but had already
christened the protected harbor “Plimouth.”
To unify the factionalized community and
since they were in lands that did not have any rec-
ognized political authority (being outside the do-
main of the Virginia Company as well as the
government of England), the Pilgrims drew up
the Mayflower Compact, which is considered the
first charter of liberties ever framed by English com-
mon people. Unlike the earlier laws of Jamestown,
which were enacted under the direction of a royally
appointed governor and his councilors, the Pilgrims
were acting only under the authority of the
102 members of their party (many of whom were
non-Pilgrims, or Strangers).
The Mayflower Compact was not actually a
law code but rather a covenant signed by 41 male
company members that bound them together in a
political union with the full powers of a sovereign
state. Their contract established the concept that
“for our better ordering and preservation … and
by virtue hereof to enact, constitute, and frame
such just and equal laws … as shall be thought
most meet and convenient for the general good
of the Colony.”4 Without the aid of Crown law-
yers, the signatories of this document set forth their
ideal of government by the consent of the governed
in a written document that anticipated the funda-
mental concepts of American constitutionalism. For
the next 71 years, the Mayflower Compact was the
formal mechanism for the political order of the col-
ony.
In
the
meantime,
the
governments
of
Connecticut, Providence, and New Haven would
establish similar compacts. However, none of these
would be permanent, and none was recognized un-
der English law. Once Plymouth was absorbed by
the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1686, it came un-
der the domain of traditional English law.
Following the establishment of Plymouth,
King Charles granted another charter to the
Massachusetts Bay Company in 1629. The charter
authorized the company to establish laws for its set-
tlement “not contrary to the laws of our realm of
England” and to inflict “lawful correction” on the
spot to violators. The following year saw the estab-
lishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony under
the watchful eye of Governor John Winthrop and
his Puritan colleagues. Both the Plymouth and the
Massachusetts
colonies
would
independently
establish their own criminal justice statutes and
procedures,
reflected
in
the
current
state
of
Massachusetts.
During the Great Migration between 1629 and
1640, almost 80,000 English inhabitants left their
Old World homes in search of religious freedom.
This coincided with the era when the ill-fated
Charles I ruled England without calling Parliament
into session. Even more significant was the oppres-
sion faced by Puritan members of the Anglican
Church. Other factors for the momentous migra-
tion included widespread pestilence and economic
depression. Of these immigrants, more than a quar-
ter of them would settle in Massachusetts.
The Puritans differed from other immigrant
groups in that they migrated with the highest num-
ber of family units, they had a relatively equal ratio
of men to women, and their members were older
than most other immigrants. The majority of them
were from the middling classes, counting among
their numbers artisans and craftsmen, merchants,
traders, and farmers. While perhaps three-quarters
of the Virginia colonists were indentured servants,
less than 25% of the Massachusetts settlers were in
this subservient position. Highly skilled and literate

(for they believed that each person must know the
scriptures as opposed to a priest interpreting for
them) and often traveling in village or family units
to the New World, this emigrant group would
clearly distinguish itself from the more secular soci-
eties to the south.
Village life in Massachusetts was dominated by
the family, from which much governance ema-
nated. Consequently, in some provinces it was ille-
gal for single persons to live alone. In 1668, one
Massachusetts court scrutinized its communities
for any single people and then placed them into
existing families. Failure to comply could result in
a term in the local house of correction.
The Lawgivers
Initially, judicial operations in early New England
settlements were connected to other business of the
government. Therefore, justice was administered by
various executive and legislative bodies rather than
by a separate judicial arm of government. Judicial
power was often relegated by charter provisions.
According to the Massachusetts Charter, all govern-
ment power was vested in an executive council
known as the assistant’s court and the General
Court, which was the highest regulating body in
the colony. By the 1640s, most judicial functions
of the General Court were turned over to other
courts established by the General Court.
Typical justice procedure involved an assistant,
also known as a magistrate, who filled a role similar
to the English justice of the peace. Malefactors were
brought before the assistant, who had the power to
try minor cases without a jury. After the arraign-
ment of the individual and hearing the evidence,
the assistant could decide whether to press further
with the case. However, before any corporal pun-
ishment could be meted out, another assistant was
required to determine whether the judgment was
appropriate.
The assistant’s court, similar to a state supreme
court, included the governor, deputy governor, and
12 assistants (magistrates) and tried cases that were
punishable by banishment, dismemberment, or
capital punishment. If there was disagreement
between the assistants or between the assistants
and the jury, the case could be appealed to the
General Court. In the 1640s, Massachusetts estab-
lished county governments and seven county
courts. Each court was assigned five judges, and
three needed to be present for there to be quorum.
In the following decade, a four-tiered pyramid
structure of judicial administration developed in
Massachusetts. At the bottom were town courts,
which conducted trials. Any appeals would go to
the next level, the county courts, which held trials
but also heard appeals. County court appeals would
be filed at the assistant’s court, which heard trials
and appeals, and at the top was the General Court,
the highest court of appeal. In 1671, the General
Court transferred its power to the Court of Assis-
tants, which made it the highest trial and appellate
court in the colony. While there was some variance
in the judicial systems of other early New England
colonies, such as Connecticut, Rhode Island, and
New Haven, they were similar in the hierarchical
nature of the appeals process.
In 1685, the trial functions of the assistant’s
court were given over to the newly created
county courts. Over time, the county courts be-
came the most prominent ingredient in the crimi-
nal justice process. Convening as a court of
common pleas, county courts heard civil suits
and misdemeanors but were restricted from hear-
ing felony cases, which were punishable by death
or dismemberment.
The administration of the early Massachusetts
Bay Colony criminal justice system was influenced
by the teachings of the Bible. Indeed, biblical law
codes superseded the English common law. Tech-
nically, there was no separation of church and state;
as such, church elders tended to hold the reins of
civic authority.5 Motivated by the Old Testament,
one of the early religious leaders proposed a law
code based on the Mosaic code. Known as Moses
His Judicials, it was subsequently rejected in favor
of the more formal Body of Liberties. The most sub-
stantial criminal code of the early Massachusetts
colony, the Body of Liberties of 1641 subscribed to
many of the notions contained in the rejected doc-
ument. More important, it verified that everyone is
CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN EARLY AMERICA (1597–1740)

entitled to specific rights or “liberties,” including
the right to plead or petition in the local courts.
The Body of Liberties was composed of 98 civil and
criminal laws. Although inspired by the Mosaic code,
these laws were still considerably less severe than the
ruthless laws of England. While The Body of Liberties
recognized some property and personal rights, it per-
petuated a tradition in which the colony was gov-
erned by a select few: an oligarchy of elite church
members. Revised and renamed the Laws and Liber-
ties in 1648, the new document is considered a turn-
ing point in colonial criminal justice. A fusion of
biblical injunctions against immorality, the Laws and
Liberties of 1648 also included more secular concepts,
such as due process and the right to a jury trial, and
enumerated specific crimes and sanctions.
Colonial historian Peter C. Hoffer suggests that
Laws and Liberties is written “in language reminis-
cent of the ‘Great Charter (Magna Carta)’ of
English liberties.”6 According to the document,
“No mans life shall be taken away, no mans honour
or good name shall be stained, no mans person shall
be arrested, restrayned … no mans goods or estate
shall be taken away from him … unless it be of
vertue or equitie of some xpresse law of the Coun-
try warranting the same, established by a general
court and sufficiently published.… Every person
within this jurisdiction, whether inhabitant or
forreiner shall enjoy the same justice and law.”7
Although the Puritans are associated with free-
dom of religion, it did not mean that every religion
would be tolerated in the colony; they were seek-
ing to practice their version of Christianity. While
Puritan law was equitably dispensed in the Puritan
community, non-Puritans were not protected un-
der the same laws. Deviation from the values and
culture of the dominant group had a price. Particu-
lar animosity was reserved for the Quakers, in
part because they loudly and publicly criticized
the established churches and did not believe that
ministers, or the symbol of church authority,
were necessary. In 1658, the Massachusetts General
Court passed several measures that included banish-
ing practicing Quakers from the colony under the
threat of capital punishment. The following year,
to test the new law, several Quakers returned to
Boston with 20 followers in tow. They were
promptly thrown in jail, and three were selected
to be executed. Prior to sentencing, one official
lamented that “neither whipping nor imprison-
ment, nor cutting off ears, nor banishment upon
pain of death, will keep you from among us …
I desire not your deaths.”8 Two of the men were
executed, with drummers drowning out their last
words, while the third, a woman, was reprieved
at the last moment, although she would hang in
Boston for testing the authorities once again in
1660. These events did little to quiet the Quaker
voice in Massachusetts, even when followed by
months of suppression.
A familiar fixture in urban England, lawyers
were not always available let alone wanted, so min-
isters often were consulted. In Puritan New
England, the Bible supplied the law codes; hence,
magistrates and lawyers were unnecessary for most
litigation. Judges need not be schooled in the secu-
lar law, and few ordinances outside the scriptures
were necessary. It was not until 1712 that an actual
lawyer served as chief justice of Massachusetts. By
the end of the seventeenth century, lawyers were in
such disrepute in Connecticut that they were cate-
gorized along with those guilty of public drunken-
ness and keepers of disorderly houses.
In 1691, Great Britain granted a new charter to
Massachusetts that united the colonies of Maine,
Massachusetts Bay, and Plymouth into the province
of Massachusetts Bay. In this new structure, the
governor, with the consent and advice of his coun-
cil, appointed sheriffs, marshals, justices of the
peace, and the judiciary. The Puritan theocracy
had governed the colony for six decades, and
now, with the new charter, religious freedom was
granted to all Protestant denominations. This sig-
naled a new era that allowed a transition to the
common law as the colony was weaned from
Mosaic law.
Crime and Punishment
Within the first few years of the colony, church
attendance was made compulsory under threat of
fine and prison. The literal acceptance of the Bible

led to oppressive legal measures that some saw as no
better than the laws they left behind in England.
No case illustrated this more than the Salem witch
trials in 1692 (see “Notable Trials”). In another in-
stance, an apparently mentally deficient denizen of
the colony was whipped, had his ears cropped, and
was banished from the colony for speaking critically
of the local theocracy. No critic would be tolerated
by the colonial elders.
Conforming to the biblical law codes, the Pur-
itans were least tolerant when it came to nonpro-
creative forms of sex. Multiple convictions for
masturbation were a capital offense in the New
Haven colony. Considered the most sinister per-
version, however, bestiality was punishable by a
death sentence with little room for compromise.
Although a capital sentence could not be passed
without the testimony of two witnesses, magistrates
often created loopholes to ensure that justice was
done. In one case, a servant with one eye and a tarn-
ished past was believed to have committed numerous
depravities. When a one-eyed pig was born in the
vicinity, he was accused of siring it. The magistrates
exerted considerable pressure on the suspect until he
confessed and recanted twice. The magistrates ruled
then that the deformed pig could be considered one
witness and the withdrawn confession of the suspect
would serve as another. Subsequently, the one-eyed
servant was hanged.
Adultery and fornication were particularly
targeted by the law. Extramarital sex was not only
a sin; if it involved a married woman it also
was considered a capital offense. Records for the
seventeenth-century Puritan colonies indicate that
at least three people were executed for this crime.
However, for a capital punishment to be levied, it
was required that there be two eyewitnesses to the
actual offense. On occasions when there was only
one witness, other sanctions were employed. His-
torian David Hackett Fischer cites a case where a
man was whipped, fined, and sentenced to the
house of correction while the straying wife also
spent a stint in the same institution and then was
instructed to wear a sign indicating her unwhole-
some behavior at a town meeting. According to
Puritan law, fornication between an unmarried
woman and a man, unmarried or married, sanc-
tioned the man to be imprisoned, whipped, disen-
franchised, and then forced to marry his partner if
single.9 The degree to which sexual immorality was
suppressed in Massachusetts was probably responsi-
ble for its having the lowest rate of premarital preg-
nancy in the seventeenth-century Western world.
It is just as likely that many individuals charged with
fornication were forced into marriage.
Obedience within the family was considered
sacrosanct. The laws of 1648 mandated the death
penalty for rebellious sons over 16 years of age.
Failure to obey one’s parents or any verbal or phys-
ical assault against them could lead to capital sanc-
tions, although there is little evidence that this law
was ever literally enforced. In lieu of the death pen-
alty, several examples suggest that fines and whip-
pings were the normal modes of punishment for
such transgressions.
Infanticide has been an underreported crime
throughout history since birth usually occurs in pri-
vate with little fanfare. Midwives were typically
present at birth to ensure a safe birth and to testify
if the baby was stillborn. One of the earliest cases of
infanticide was reported in Boston in 1646. Reach-
ing back to the dark days of the Middle Ages, offi-
cials ordered the accused to undergo an “ordeal of
touch.” This was similar to the Germanic bier-
right, in which a suspect is made to touch an alleged
victim, and if the corpse bled or frothed at the
mouth, the suspect was adjudged guilty. According
to this relic of medieval judicial procedure, the birth
mother was made to touch the face of her pur-
ported dead infant in front of a jury. When blood
flushed the child’s cheeks, the mother confessed.
She was then hanged. Other cases of this judgment
are recorded, the last apparently in 1769.
One of the main goals of Puritan punishment
was to have a church member repent and return to
the congregation. Although law was draconian, in
reality it was rarely as punitive as the law allowed.
Recent scholarship notes that Massachusetts colo-
nists were rarely punished for Old Testament in-
fractions and that “even those prosecuted very
rarely suffered the prescribed penalty.”10 According
to colonial historian Peter C. Hoffer, laws based on
CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN EARLY AMERICA (1597–1740)

the Old Testament “were not meant to function in
a literal way”; rather, it was hoped that they would
function as a “solemn public warning to those at
the edges of the Puritan community against viola-
tion of the deeper social mores that held the Puritan
towns in the wilderness together.”11
Besides punishment, another response to crime
was the admonition, in which magistrates or clergy-
men lectured offenders privately to elicit a promise
of reform. According to the procedures of the day,
penitent reformers appeared in open court for a
formal admonition by the magistrate. After a public
confession of wrongdoing, there was a pronounce-
ment of sentence, which was typically a suspended
one. The admonition as it developed in Massachusetts
had no precise analogue in English criminal justice
practice. Its adoption followed the Puritan theology,
which emphasized a “gentle correction” to impede
sin, at least with the first offense.
The colonists of Massachusetts brought from
England sumptuary laws that restricted certain fash-
ions in favor of the more dour and drab. This ten-
dency reflected the elite’s efforts to exercise restraint
in personal matters and to maintain social order in a
society that witnessed significantly more social mo-
bility. Nowhere were these laws more strict than in
Massachusetts, where men and women were pro-
hibited by law in the 1630s from displaying “new
fashions, or long hair, or anything like the nature.”
Fashionable beaver hats were regarded as “superflu-
ous and unnecessary” under threat of a fine.12
Not only were numerous other fashion state-
ments strictly prohibited, but the mere manufacture
or sale of such products was banned by statute.
Over the following decades, the sumptuary laws
would reflect the growing hierarchical nature of
the colony. By 1651, individuals were allowed to
flaunt their rank through various statements of sar-
torial elegance. Despite the loosening of the sump-
tuary prohibitions, early Puritan women continued
to refrain from cosmetics, bright colors, and even
false teeth.
Setting aside the periodic devastation of the
Indian population, there was little in the way of
violent crime in New England. Low crime rates
have persisted in this region for more than 300
years. Fewer people are executed or murdered in
this region than anywhere else in modern America.
According
to Massachusetts court records,
property crimes were more common than personal
crimes. Crimes against the hierarchical social order
were the most common offenses, including Sabbath
violations, sexual offenses, idleness, drunkenness,
and domestic disorder, all of which were apparently
common.13 Regardless of the punishment in New
England, the interval between sentencing and pun-
ishment was set by law at 4 days.
The most prevalent form of sanctions involved
fines, which was the punishment of choice for a
variety of petty offenses and misdemeanors. Other
public sanctions exposed offenders to an array of
corporal punishments, including whippings, the
stocks, and pillories. These exhibitory chastisements
were administered publicly before the assembled
community, usually on a market, lecture, or mili-
tary training day. While public punishment and
shaming was a standard response to many property
and moral offenses, most of these minor offenses
would have probably been tolerated back in Eng-
land with perhaps a warning.
The Puritans were especially pragmatic when it
came to methods of public punishment. In some in-
stances, individuals accused of premarital sex were
required to stand silently, attired in white sheets, in
front of their congregation and recount their sins.
Habitual drinkers wore the shame letter D, for
“drunkard,” for an entire year. An unscrupulous
baker sometimes stood in the stocks supporting a
lump of dough on his head. Chronic property offen-
ders were branded on the cheek or forehead or mu-
tilated, leaving a “mark of infamy” to warn the
community of their criminal disposition.
One penalty reserved for the most serious
crimes included “warning out,” or banishment,
which was used in New England until the eigh-
teenth century to get rid of undesirables. Banish-
ment
was
often
the
last
resort
available
to
longtime residents faced with patterns of criminal-
ity. In colonial Massachusetts, where labor was rel-
atively scarce, it was impractical to run out the
disorderly, though it was used in cases of heresy
and political misconduct.

Particular disdain was reserved for betting, games
of chance, and gambling. The General Court banned
games, ranging from shuffleboard to cards and dice.
What most provoked the Puritan was the waste of
time associated with these types of activities. In this
society, a work ethic, or the notion that constant
work was beneficial materially as well as spiritually
because it kept one out of trouble, was revered.
Time wasting, or idleness, therefore became a crimi-
nal offense in Massachusetts, punishable by fines.
Massachusetts colonists were surely familiar
with England’s predilection for capital punishment.
In the home country, people were executed for
crimes great and small, for routine theft and bur-
glary as well as murder. However, only a fraction of
the condemned were actually executed thanks to
safety valves such as royal pardons, benefit of clergy,
and the intercession of a jury. Among the most
heinous forms of execution were burning at the
stake and hanging. While hanging was the most
common form of capital punishment, there are re-
cords of servants being burned at the stake for com-
mitting petty treason, defined as the killing of a
master by a servant. Of the two known cases,
both involved women of African descent.
Like the wearing of shame letters, which sent a
message to the community, specific forms of maim-
ing also sent a warning to potential miscreants.
Among the more grotesque punishments adminis-
tered by the Puritans were the amputation of ears,
slitting of nostrils, and branding of faces and hands.
Unlike shame letters sewn into a garment, these
were permanent reminders to both offender and
community. Particular ferocity was reserved for
the Quakers, who were often the target of facial
brandings of the letter H, for “heresy.”
Piracy and the Navigation Acts
Between 1651 and 1696 England issued a series of
Navigation Acts in an attempt to control colonial
trade to England’s benefit by prohibiting goods
from being imported to England and her colonies
unless on British ships manned by British crews.
Other rules stipulated that certain items could
only be shipped to the English market. Therefore
all goods headed to the colonies in America had to
be first unloaded in England, in the process paying
customs duties that pushed up prices on major sta-
ple crops of the colonies such as tobacco, sugar, and
dyestuffs. These Acts created a near monopoly on
British shipping and trade. It also made it difficult
for colonists to receive certain luxury items such as
Portuguese salt, Irish and Scottish linens, and wines
from Madeira and the Azores. However, in re-
sponse smugglers, black marketeers, and pirates
were only too happy to challenge the English em-
bargo and supply the goods.
The North American colonies proved to be the
greatest markets for pirate plunder in the seven-
teenth century. Pirates engaged in a lucrative com-
merce with New York City and other colonial
ports, and by the 1680s pirates were familiar visitors
along the Eastern coast, with their visits eagerly
awaited by merchants. New England merchants
felt especially exploited by English trade rules.
Forced to trade with the English at exorbitant fixed
rates by its merchants prohibited American busi-
nessmen from making much profit on what had
been traditionally lucrative trade goods (before the
Navigation Acts). Some of America’s leading fami-
lies consorted with pirates as fences for pirate booty.
The unwillingness of American colonists and offi-
cials to obey the Navigation Acts was not unlike the
sporadic and ineffective enforcement of Prohibition
laws in the 1920s. Colonists were willing to follow
the letter of the law for traditional crimes such as
treason, murder, and robbery; but when it came to
free trade, they essentially nullified the law by cre-
ating organized smuggling ventures. New England
merchants, in particular, routinely participated in
trade with non-English pirates. By the Revolution-
ary era of the mid-1700s, the colonies were home
to a number of clandestine economies, thanks to
smuggling rings and black markets, which had be-
come a way of life in America. By most accounts
New England merchants became prosperous, some
making considerable fortunes smuggling Dutch
linens and French brandies. According to Neville
Williams, to avoid import taxes, British colonial
businessmen probably smuggled two million gallons
of illegal molasses into port cities between 1738 and

1750. Others have suggested that perhaps five-
sixths of the tea consumed in the colonies had
been smuggled. Among the parallels with the Pro-
hibition era of the 1920s was the fact that there
were not enough agents to enforce the Navigation
Acts and customs officials were easily corrupted.
No form of international organized crime in the modern
world illustrates the continuum of organized crime past
and present like the ancient crime of sea piracy. By the
Middle Ages piracy was already an ancient occupation
practiced by such groups as the Phoenicians and the
Vikings. Recent scholars such as Marcus Rediker suggest
that the so-called Golden Age of piracy that lasted
between 1650 and 1730 can be divided up into three
distinct generations. It was the last phase between 1716
and 1726 (the most heavily documented era) that was
considered the most successful era and was dominated by
larger-than-life characters such as Bartholomew Roberts
and Edward Teach. It was this era that has inspired most
of the familiar images of popular culture, such as Long
John Silver and Treasure Island, the sinister Blackbeard,
and the Jolly Roger flag featuring a skull and crossbones.
Today’s pirates are likely to possess a combination of
ancient sailing skills along with the latest in high-tech
equipment, including speedboats, machine guns, and
radio intercept technology capable of identifying and
locating large, poorly defended vessels bearing vital raw
materials such as oil and weapons. However, most
evidence asserts that today’s pirates are rather low-tech
and are more likely to be armed with guns or knives. In
any case maritime piracy has increased at an alarming
rate in the twenty-first century. In the first months of
2005 more than 200 acts of piracy were reported around
the world, triple the number of incidents from the previ-
ous decade. During 2007 pirate activity continued to in-
crease, particularly along the African coasts of Nigeria and
Somalia. According to one 2008 article in the Economist,
piracy is the most lucrative business in Somalia, a failed
state where there is no lack of recruits for the pirate life.
PENNSYLVANIA AND THE
MI D-ATLANTIC COLONIES
Dutch and Swedish colonists had established settle-
ments along the Delaware River decades before
William Penn was granted his proprietary charter
by King Charles II in 1681. The founder of
Pennsylvania and a lifelong crusader for religious
and civil liberty, Penn was expelled from Oxford
University in his youth for his controversial and
nonconforming religious views. Hoping to rid his
son of his Puritan convictions, his father, an admiral
in the British navy, sent him on a tour of Europe.
However, this ploy backfired when, in 1667, Penn
converted to Quakerism, an equally nonconformist
sect, leading to a short prison sentence in England’s
infamous Tower of London.
What set the Quakers apart from the Puritans
was their rejection of the Calvinist belief in predes-
tination and their emphasis on the inner spirit. As a
consequence of these beliefs, ministers were no lon-
ger necessary, leading Puritans to view these meet-
ings of “Friends” as anarchy. The Quakers were a
radical sect that emerged in England in the 1640s
and 1650s as the Society of Friends. In their earlier
days, they developed a reputation for defiance—
refusing to swear oaths or remove their hats in front
of magistrates and even going as far as denouncing
Anglican ministers in church. Presaging their partic-
ipation in nineteenth-century women’s rights and
antislavery reform movements, from the start the
Quakers were vehemently opposed to war and
contended that women had the right to speak at
public meetings.
On his father’s death, Penn not only inherited
the family fortune but also became the proprietor of
Pennsylvania. This land had been given to Penn’s
father by the king as repayment for an outstanding
loan to Charles II. Persecuted at home, the young
Penn set about creating his vision of an ideal Christian
commonwealth on the banks of the Delaware
River.
The Lawgivers
In December 1682, the colony’s first assembly, dom-
inated by Quakers, adopted Penn’s Frame of Govern-
ment, also known as “The Great Law or Body of
Laws,” the first criminal code of Pennsylvania, pro-
viding the blueprint for the colony. It laid out
a political structure that was composed of a
governor, council, and assembly elected by free-
holders. It also laid the groundwork for trial by

jury, free elections, and religious liberty. Penn came
as close as anyone to allowing religious freedom in
the colonies, although he excluded atheists and
nonbelievers from his colony and barred non-
Christians from holding office. From the start,
Penn was imbued with a strong sense of English
liberties. Within the first 5 years of his arrival, he
ordered the entire text of the Magna Carta to be
reprinted in Philadelphia.
The Quakers embraced an austere and ascetic
mode of life once they settled in the New World.
Prior to the eighteenth century, the Quakers were
considerably more humane in the punishment of
crime than either England or New England. No-
where was this more true than in the use of the
death penalty. At a time when Massachusetts in-
flicted capital punishment for offenses including
adultery, man stealing, bestiality, blasphemy, bur-
glary, cursing or smiting a parent, bearing false wit-
ness, arson, poisoning, and rape, Pennsylvania
demanded death only for traitors and murderers.
When Pennsylvania became a royal colony in
1718, and with Anglicans now dominating the leg-
islature, a more severe penal code was introduced to
bring the laws into conformity with England’s
bloody code.
Quaker punishments for deviant behavior did
not range widely and were inclined to favor forfei-
ture of property, fines, imprisonment, and shaming
over other methods. Their use of a variety of prison
sentences no doubt demonstrates the influence of
Enlightenment philosophy and foreshadows the
birth of the penitentiary in the Quaker colony.
For indiscretions such as incest and sodomy, indivi-
duals forfeited a large percentage of their estate and
spent six months to one year of imprisonment at
hard labor. A second offense could earn the culprit
life in prison. Gambling, swearing, cursing, and
drunkenness could earn malefactors a five-shilling
fine or five days of imprisonment at hard labor on a
bread-and-water diet. Prostitution, bigamy, and
adultery were treated more seriously, but much
less severely than in Massachusetts. Sanctions in-
cluded public whippings and up to a year of impris-
onment at hard labor and, for repeated offenses, life
imprisonment.
Crime and Punishment
Crime trends in Pennsylvania offer numerous con-
trasts with other British colonies. In New England,
property crimes outnumbered personal crimes, and
in Virginia the reverse wastrue. But in Pennsylvania,
these crimes tended to be distributed rather evenly
among the classes. Prior to the mid-1750s, most
crimes in the Quaker colony were crimes against
authority, such as confronting peace officers on
duty. Individuals arrested for civic disorder or
physical violence were punished severely, particu-
larly in rape cases. One individual, facing the shame
and pain of a public whipping for rape, slit his own
throat before the sentence could be carried out.
Paralleling the waning power of the Quakers in
the Pennsylvania legislature in the eighteenth cen-
tury was the increase in the number of capital
crimes under more secular rule. But Pennsylvania’s
number of capital crimes always remained small in
comparison to the other colonies. The Quaker
codes were changed and became more harsh by
the English influence beginning in 1718. Whipping
remained in fashion in Pennsylvania throughout the
eighteenth century. Neighboring Delaware, heavily
influenced by early Quaker code, even had a name
for its permutation of this device: “Red Hannah.”
An anachronism, Delaware authorities continued to
whip prisoners into the 1940s.14
The development of prison reform in America
can be traced back to William Penn’s code. Penn and
his Quaker contemporaries were adamantly opposed
to the severe physical penalties exacted in England
and considered imprisonment the best alternative.
As previously mentioned, except for murder and
treason, imprisonment at hard labor was often pre-
scribed for crimes that typically demanded bloody
retribution in the other colonies. Penn’s system was
the first in the colonies to put inmates to hard labor to
compensate for a crime as well as to rehabilitate. Penn
added other measures in an attempt to reform law-
breakers, including making all prisoners eligible for
bail and allowing the wrongfully imprisoned to sue
for damages. Instead of jails funded by jailers charging
prisoners room and board, inmates in Pennsylvania
were given free food and boarding.

Penn, a proponent of the Enlightenment phi-
losophy that the punishment should fit the crime,
enacted measures for penal reform that were consid-
ered the most humane in colonial America. In
contrast to British jails, which consisted of dungeons
or were often run by venal private contractors,
Penn’s prisons were adequately built and provided
for by the government. However, like the other
reforms introduced in the Quaker colony, they
would endure only as long as the Quakers were in
the majority. It was not long before the more toler-
ant
Quakers
were
outnumbered
by
Anglican
settlers who introduced more harsh measures based
on English procedures. Penn’s efforts established a
tradition of institutional reform that would be rein-
troduced following the American Revolution.
COLONIAL LAW
ENFORCEM ENT
Like its precursors in Europe, early American law
enforcement was the bailiwick of unskilled ama-
teurs. There was little innovation in the early colo-
nies, with most preferring what they were familiar
with: some incarnation of the English parish con-
stable and the county sheriff. Between 1608 and the
end of the revolution, most American sheriffs and
constables were appointed by colonial governors
and performed the same tasks as their English coun-
terparts. In Maryland’s Chesapeake settlements, the
sheriff was expected not only to maintain order but
also to collect taxes and fees, of which he was enti-
tled to 10%.
In small-town New England, local church elders
and settlement laws filled the void in law enforce-
ment by regulating the behavior of new arrivals,
townspeople, and land dealings of the citizenry.
There was no clear demarcation between amateur
and professional law enforcement in the colonial
world. The system hinged on laypeople and on
traditional institutions, including the hue and cry,
sheriff, constable, night watch, magistrate, and
coroner.
In New England, as need arose for peace-
keepers outside the church setting, village constables
were selected locally to serve processes and war-
rants, make arrests, collect taxes, and be on the
lookout for unsavory new arrivals lurking in the
community. Never wavering from the Puritan
ethos, the constable was also required to visit
each household in the township at least four times
a year to remind the inhabitants of the Sabbath
laws. When more serious situations arose, the con-
stable could depend on his neighbors to come to
his aid, harking back to the centuries-old hue
and cry. According to the evidence, the system
worked well in seventeenth-century Massachusetts,
where the murder rate was less than half that of
Maryland and Virginia, known as the Chesapeake
colonies.
While the town constables were the most
popular peace officers in New England, in Virginia,
which was more sparsely populated, the sheriff
played a more significant role. According to early
custom, sheriffs were expected to reside in the
county they served in and were to be members
of the landowning gentry. Sheriffs were expected
to fulfill a wide assortment of services, ranging
from organizing courts and calling elections to
running the jail and keeping county records. But
they could not possibly meet their obligations
without the assistance of a coterie of undersheriffs,
deputies, jailers, county clerks, and whippers. Ever
the most odious duties, hangmen and mutilators
were often selected from the ranks of the criminal
element.
In contrast to the gentry-controlled sheriff of
the South and the theocratically appointed con-
stables of New England, Pennsylvanians used a
more complex method for selecting county sheriffs.
Counties were required to conduct an election
with multiple candidates. The names of the two
men receiving the most votes would be forwarded
to the governor, who would then pick one as sher-
iff. Sheriffs in Pennsylvania served one-year stints
and were limited to three consecutive terms.
In the more urban reaches of Boston, New
York, and Philadelphia, the British night-watch sys-
tem was adopted to complement the duties of the
constable. During the 1630s, the dim outlines of
American policing were beginning to take shape
64

in Massachusetts. The towns were policed by the
familiar English amateurs: the constable and the
night watchman. In 1631, a night watch was estab-
lished in Boston, the first in America. The Boston
night watch was composed of six men and an offi-
cer and would form at sunset in preparation for the
tasks ahead. Their duties included walking rounds
crying the time of night and the state of the weather
“in a moderate tone.” In 1634, Joshua Pratt was
appointed constable of Plymouth. His duties in-
cluded serving as jailer, executor of punishments,
sealer of weights and measures, and surveyor of
lands. One problem that would remain consistent
into the nineteenth century was watchmen “coop-
ing” (or sleeping on duty) and drinking on the job.
The Dutch colonists of New Amsterdam be-
came familiar with the schout and rattle watch in the
1650s.15 The schout fiscal was one of the earliest
peace officers in America, executing his duties in
the Dutch colony of New Netherland as early as
the 1620s. Officers were appointed by the colonial
council in New Amsterdam, the progenitor of New
York City. Their duties were typically equivalent to
those of the sheriff. They were expected to enforce
the law and serve court orders. Although they were
not considered salaried officials they were compen-
sated from court fees. The early schout had little
autonomy and was unable to pursue any action
without the direction of colonial directors. By the
1650s members of the schout were considered the
most important police functionaries in the colony
and in most criminal cases were responsible for
county prosecution. In 1651 the Dutch colony in-
troduced the law enforcement position of ratel
wacht, or rattle watch, so named for the rattles
used as signal mechanisms. This early alarm system
was used to summon help when threatened by mal-
efactors in the era before professional police train-
ing. By 1658 the colony boasted a paid rattle-watch
of eight men who functioned as night watchmen
from nine o’clock at night until sunrise. All male
residents were expected to serve stints in this posi-
tion and were paid the equivalent of 50 cents per
night from a tax paid by property owners. When
the English took over the colony and renamed
New Amsterdam the more familiar New York,
they introduced a new system composed of watch-
men supervised by constables elected from wards
and headed by a high constable.
New Amsterdam passed the first traffic law in the New
World on June 27, 1652. It was designed to prevent
accidents and expected all drivers and conductors to walk
with their wagons, carts, and sleighs within city limits,
under threat of fines and damages. After the Dutch
colony passed to the English one of its earliest traffic
regulations, passed in 1791, requested “Ladies and
Gentlemen” to order their coachmen to conduct their
carriages in the direction of the East River following per-
formances at the John Street Theater. The New York City
Police Department did not introduce its first unit specifi-
cally designed to enforce traffic regulations until 1860.
In 1700, the Philadelphia provincial council
appointed a watchman, and a system was estab-
lished by which all citizens, typically the heads of
households, were obligated to take turns in the duty
of watch and ward. By the early eighteenth cen-
tury, this institution was established in most existing
towns and cities.
For the next 200 years, little would change in
American policing, in part because American citizens
saw a standing police force as a reminder of the op-
pression and exploitation that they had left behind in
Europe. The Dutch in New York City (1648) and
the English in Boston (1663) experimented with a
paid watch system but found it too expensive and
abandoned it in favor of the amateur approach.
The evolution of the southern slave patrols in
the early 1700s marked the first real advances in
American policing. Slave patrolling originated not
in the American colonies but in the Caribbean,
where French, Spanish, Portuguese, and English
slaveholders faced the same challenges as slave-
owning American colonists as early as the sixteenth
century. According to historian Sally E. Hadden,
“The Barbadian slave code of 1661 provided the
model for several other English slave-holding
colonies.”16 Many Barbadian planters would bring
this code with them to South Carolina in the 1670s,
where they exerted a major influence in designing
the first laws governing slave law enforcement in
America.

The ancient system of hue and cry was poorly
suited for sparsely populated parts of Virginia. With
black slavery coming to dominate southern society,
the southern colonies introduced slave codes begin-
ning with South Carolina’s in 1712. The slave codes
provided for the creation of brutal slave patrols,
charged with protecting the plantations and punish-
ing those responsible for serious crimes. Virginia in-
troduced a slave patrol in 1727 in the wake of a 1721
slave revolt. Slave patrols were implemented as a pro-
active response to the insurrectionists. Rather than
allowing bands of slaves to plot when they gathered
during holidays, patrollers were ordered to break up
the meetings and disperse the slaves.
While they varied in structure, many slave
patrols consisted of three to five armed men on
horseback who covered a prescribed beat of almost
15 square miles. However, in South Carolina, reg-
ulations prohibited a beat from being larger than a
few square miles. While making their rounds, the
slave patrols were responsible for maintaining disci-
pline, apprehending runaway slaves, and preventing
slave uprisings. Routinely invading slave quarters at
night andwhippingandterrorizingthose caught with-
out passes after curfew, over time slave patrols became
a feared presence among the black population.
Slave patrols were authorized to enforce laws
against black literacy, trade, and gambling. Until re-
cently, most historians have accepted the notion that
while all white males were expected to participate in
patrol service, most planters paid for substitutes, who
were typically landless poor whites. However, recent
research by Hadden suggests that in the first decades
of the eighteenth century, slave patrols “frequently
included men of superior social status, not just poor
slaveless whites.” One explanation for this was that
wealthy whites lobbied for slave patrols in order to
avoid serving in the militia.17 In 1721, this practice
was abolished. Despite friction between the white
underclass and the owners of large plantations who
controlled the best lands, the slaves became the target
of the slave patrols. In response, slave communities
resisted by setting up warning systems and sometimes
ambushing the riders.
One of the most important American crimi-
nal justice modifications in the colonies was the
“district attorney.” There was no such analogue in
England, where people were expected to prosecute
criminals at their own expense, making it cost pro-
hibitive for most farmers and small merchants. The
district attorney, or county attorney, evolved as a
public prosecutor in charge of prosecution in the
colonies, an official paid by the government to
prosecute crimes on behalf of the citizenry.
COLONIAL CORRECTIONS
The Massachusetts Bay Colony built its first prison
in Boston in 1636, the only one the colony would
have for 18 years. More jails were constructed as the
population expanded into the wilderness. By the
mid-1770s, the era of the American Revolution,
Massachusetts was divided into 12 counties, with
each required to maintain its own jail. Early jails
functioned as holding facilities for debtors and
others delinquent in paying taxes and fines. Initially,
jails were considered a method of coercion to make
someone pay rather than as a criminal sanction. Jails
served as holding facilities for a variety of prisoners,
including Indians and soldiers (both British and
French) and Quaker, Jesuit, and Loyalist political
prisoners. Serving mostly in a custodial capacity,
jails were also used for presentence detention for
those awaiting trial or punishment. Although jails
were considered a last resort, in some cases they
performed penal functions in the late colonial pe-
riod. Incarceration was an expensive investment
and a loss of industrious labor, so it rarely exceeded
24 hours. Forgers convicted after 1692 faced the
loss of an ear and imprisonment without bail for
one year. Prior to 1750, incarceration by statute
was rare, with mutilation and other punishments
more common.
Other
New
England
colonies
developed
various versions of the pre-Enlightenment prison.
Connecticut confined prisoners in a copper mine
named Newgate Prison, while Maine relied on
small earth pits that barely measured 9.5 by 4.5 by
10 feet deep. Incarceration did not become an im-
portant criminal sanction until the Enlightenment
of the eighteenth century.

CAPITAL PUNI SHMENT
It has been several generations since the last person
was executed in New England, and at this writing
only Connecticut has prisoners actually sitting on
death row. Recent attempts by Massachusetts to
return the death penalty were narrowly defeated.
However, for close to 400 years, capital punishment
has been a transcendent feature of American crimi-
nal justice.
According to the Body of Liberties, capital pun-
ishment was the sanction for idolatry, witchcraft,
blasphemy, murder, manslaughter, poisoning, besti-
ality, sodomy, adultery, kidnapping, and treason but
not for property crimes. Contrary to English crimi-
nal practice, blasphemy, adultery, and other moral
offenses became capital crimes to conform with
Mosaic law. By the eighteenth century, fewer
moral offenses were capital crimes, as the tendency
was to less vigorously enforce the death penalty. In
reality, a shortage of population and other exigen-
cies created a system in which the statutes were
rarely enforced to the letter of the law. By English
standards, the colonies were far from bloody. How-
ever, there were cases in which colonial law was
more severe. Adultery did not demand death in
England but was considered a capital crime in
Massachusetts, though it was rarely carried out.
After the mid-seventeenth century, no one was
executed for adultery.
In contrast to Puritan New England, execu-
tions were a common occurrence in Virginia,
where hundreds of crimes demanded the death
penalty by the mid-1700s. According to one survey
of the 164 people convicted of capital crimes be-
tween 1737 and 1772, 125 were executed without
benefit of clergy. Like most English colonies, hang-
ing was the standard method of execution. The
gallows were often constructed at the scene of the
crime, and the condemned individual was brought
to the site in a cart. Usually surrounded by a huge
crowd, the only formality was to allow the con-
victed to say his last words and then go to his death.
Standing in the back of a cart, a noose was placed
around his neck. To complete the ghastly scene, the
cart was driven forward, leaving the individual to
grotesquely twist in the wind as he strangled to
death. It was not uncommon for bystanders to grab
the legs of the culprit to facilitate an end to the
macabre ceremony. As a denouement to this chain
of events, the body was often given to physicians for
dissection and research or was left in a public place as
a warning to others. Finally, at least in the colony of
Virginia, the felon’s property was forfeited to the
Crown.
Today the death penalty is most often used in
the South; the same was true in the colonial era,
when the burden was carried mostly by African
slaves and indentured servants. Between 1706 and
1784, some 555 slaves, more than any northern
colony, were sentenced to death in Virginia. Since
the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, Virginia is
second only to Texas in the number of executions
carried out in America.
C OLONIAL VIOLENC E
In the 1960s, the black militant activist H. Rap
Brown proclaimed that “violence is as American
as apple pie.” He had learned his history lessons
well, for since America’s earliest days the land was
locked in intermittent conflicts between white co-
lonists and indigenous cultures, between blacks and
whites, and between the various religious denomi-
nations. No colony had a monopoly on violence in
the colonial era. Slave insurrections and accompa-
nying mass executions occurred in both north and
south. In fact, the first mass execution of blacks
occurred in New York in 1712 after a group of
African slaves set buildings on fire and ambushed
and killed nine white colonists who responded to
the conflagration. As a result, 14 slaves went to the
gallows, and five others were executed using more
grisly methods. Twenty-nine years later, almost
three dozen men, black and white, were charged
with conspiring to torch the city. Subsequent trials
led to the immolation of 13 African Americans at
the stake and the hanging of two white men and
two white women. Dozens more were banished
from the city for their unruly behavior.

Beginning in the eighteenth century, rioting
plagued the burgeoning cities of the Eastern Sea-
board. Political unrest shaped American institutions
and eventually stimulated the creation of modern
policing. No day occasioned unrest more than elec-
tion days in Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, and
wherever antagonistic constituents were in great
numbers. Before the silent ballot and the private
voting box, opposing factions in a political contest
used violence to prevent the other side from voting.
Another cause for rioting was impressment, the
traditional method for keeping the British navy well
stocked with young men. “Press gangs” were used
to force citizens into service. Boston rioting broke
out over impressment as sympathetic townsfolk vi-
olently resisted in 1747. Although the citizens re-
sisted successfully this time, impressment continued
to be an issue until after the War of 1812. In the
decade leading up to the American Revolution,
riots became more common. According to historian
Richard Maxwell Brown, between 1641 and 1759
there were at least 41 riots, including riots over land
disputes, anti-customs riots, jailbreak riots, food
riots, and even fish-dam riots. Between 1645 and
1769, there were 18 insurgent movements by white
colonists aimed at overthrowing colonial govern-
ments, the best known being Bacon’s Rebellion
(1676).
During the first decades of colonial America,
there was little violent crime between the white
colonists. What violence that did take place usually
occurred in local taverns or along desolate trails.
Most homicides took place between whites and
the indigenous cultures. Any Indian accused of kill-
ing a white was expected to face a white court.
However, if the circumstances were reversed, the
whites occasionally paid compensation but were
never turned over to the Indian justice system.
Though subject to British law, Indians were rarely
accorded the rights of white British citizens.
While hanging enjoyed popularity in America
from the colonial era to the nineteenth century,
colonial punishments were less severe than penal
punishment in England. As previously noted,
when Pennsylvania was ruled by the Quakers,
most capital punishment was prohibited. Although
the colonial era is best remembered by criminal
justicians for the Salem witchcraft trials, this was
an anomaly. Compared to England, which exe-
cuted perhaps 30,000 for witchcraft and France
75,000, fewer than 40 were hanged for the offense
in colonial America.
NOTABLE TRIALS
Salem Witchcraft Trials (1692)
The Salem (derived from the Hebrew word Shalom,
meaning “peace”) witchcraft trials in Massachusetts
were probably the most famous trials of colonial
America. They have inspired books and plays such
as Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, and many parallels
have been drawn with the McCarthy hearings
of the 1950s (see Chapter 11). But accusations of
witchcraft were hardly unique. They were much
more common in Europe, where thousands were
condemned to death. In New England, in the 50
years leading up to the Salem trials, dozens of people
were executed for witchcraft. And after the Salem
incident, trials continued to crop up. According to
one source, a mob killed a suspected witch outside
Philadelphia’s Independence Hall as late as 1787 as
the U.S. Constitution was being haggled over inside.
The victims of witchcraft prosecutions were almost
exclusively women, many of them old, destitute, and
perceived as a drain on the community.
Over 90% of witchcraft accusations and more
than 90% of executions occurred in New England
colonies where the Puritans dominated.18 The
events surrounding the outbreak of witchcraft in
Salem are probably the best-documented witch
trials in American history. Most accounts of the
Salem hysteria begin with the Reverend Samuel
Parris’s West Indian slave Tituba. Well versed in
the superstitions of the Caribbean by the time she
arrived in Salem, Tituba regaled young girls during
the cloistered winter months with her knowledge
of the occult. Tutoring the girls in the finer arts of
palmistry, fortune-telling, necromancy, magic, and
spiritualism, everything seemed rather innocent at
first. Partly out of boredom, the students began to

show off to neighbors. In macabre displays, they
lurched into spasmodic convulsions, gestured inco-
herently, and unleashed unintelligible sounds. It
was not long before their sideshows came to the
attention of the local arbiters of morality, of which
there was a ready supply.
The diagnosis of a village doctor was that they
were bewitched, and it was not long before the entire
community was alarmed. The young girls continued
to draw attention by interrupting church services
with incongruous statements that lent credence to
the charge of witchcraft; however, they were not
punished but rather became objects of pity and com-
passion. With the assistance of local citizens, authori-
ties embarked on a witch hunt to find the source of
the bewitchment. It was not long before the young
girls succumbed to pressure to name names, and war-
rants were served on Tituba, Sarah Good, and Sarah
Osborne.19 What ensued was a spiraling series of ac-
cusations against hundreds of persons that culminated
in the hanging of 19 individuals and the imprison-
ment of hundreds more.
None of the accused women was provided le-
gal representation, and the line of questioning in-
dicates that they were presumed guilty. Even before
trial, the three accused women had attracted the
community’s scrutiny. Tituba, an Indian slave raised
in the West Indies and schooled in the healing arts,
quickly admitted her guilt and implicated the two
Sarahs. The pipe-smoking Good had been deserted
by her husband, which caused overwhelming and
burdensome poverty. Osborne was earlier censured
by her neighbors for buying out the balance of an
indentured servant’s contract, hiring him, and then
marrying him. A subject of envy as a propertied
widow,
then
marrying
beneath
her
station,
Osborne was soon bedridden and missed church
services regularly—a scandalous situation but one
that envious neighbors were happy to point out.
What made the Salem witch trials so unique
was the sheer number of people accused and con-
victed. The court in this case allowed disputed
“spectral evidence” (in which witnesses claimed vi-
sions of their tormentors) and torture and encour-
aged the accused to confess, repent, and name
names to gain freedom. Traditionally, a higher de-
gree of proof was required, and the majority were
eventually exonerated.
There is another, more sinister explanation for
what happened at Salem that hinges on complicated
social relations in a community in flux. As the com-
munity made the transition to a prosperous port
town, earlier rivalries between the wealthier mer-
chant class at the center of town and the struggling
farmers on the periphery created an atmosphere of
tension. The rural faction won a petition to form a
new church. However, the faction was not sanc-
tioned by a town charter. This unique but uncer-
tain status, combined with old socioeconomic
rivalries, ensured that all the ingredients were in
place for a massive outbreak of witchcraft accusa-
tions. In the end, what was most unusual about this
episode was that most accusers were from the dis-
advantaged rural faction, which felt left behind in
the movement toward a more commercial econ-
omy, and that the majority of victims were the
more prosperous members of the community.20
In 2001, descendants of five of the accused and executed
Salem witches petitioned the Massachusetts legislature to
declare them innocent. This is just the most recent at-
tempt to clear the names of victims of the “largest witch
hunt in American history.” The first exonerations
occurred as early as 1711, when colonial authorities
absolved 21 of the 27 (not all had been hanged) who had
been convicted after family members presented petitions
on their behalf. The other six, who had been hanged,
had no survivors in the colony to plead for them, so their
convictions stood until 1957, when all were cleared, but
only one of them was cleared by name. In the pending
measure, the other five women would be mentioned by
name and added to the 1957 resolution.
John Peter Zenger (1735)
Zenger, a German immigrant, arrived in the New
York colony in the early 1700s as an indentured ser-
vant. Apprenticed to a printer, there was little to sug-
gest that in a matter of years he would be embroiled in
one of the most important free-speech cases of his era.
In1731,Zengerwasworkingforthe NewYorkWeekly
Gazette. He came to public attention while covering

the scandals that followed the election of William
Cosby as governor of the New York colony. Zenger
sought to capture readership with reports that dozens
of Quakers had been illegally disqualified from voting
because of their religious beliefs and that Cosby’s
supporters intimidated voters and had tried to stuff
ballot boxes. Apprenticed to a Cosby supporter
who refused to print his stories about the governor,
Zenger was soon fired. Subsequently, a rival of the
governor saw the chance to inflict revenge and set
about financing a newspaper, hiring Zenger as
publisher. The new paper grew in popularity as it
chronicled the scandalous behavior of Governor
Cosby. Cosby, in turn, ordered four issues of the
paper to be condemned and publicly burned by
the hangman. It was not long before Zenger himself
was arrested and charged with seditious libel. Un-
able to raise the excessive bail, Zenger languished
in jail before obtaining the services of one of the
colony’s leading lawyers.
The Zenger case filled the New York City
courtroom to capacity as the trial got started on
August 4, 1735. His attorney argued that for his
client to be adjudged guilty, his words must be
“false, scandalous, and seditious.” The prosecutor
responded that it made no difference if the libel
was true because “the government is a sacred
body and it was a crime to libel it.” After several
more skirmishes between the attorneys, the jury left
the court. Ignoring instructions by Governor Cosby’s
handpicked judges, the jury came back with a
verdict of not guilty on the charge of “publishing
seditious libel.” An important moment in colonial
justice, the Zenger ruling did not immediately es-
tablish freedom of the press in the American colo-
nies. No new law was promulgated in respect to
seditious libel, but in the aftermath of the case,
“prosecutions for seditious libel began to falter
with increasing consistency.”21 According to legal
scholars, legal precedents change the law, and since
these come from judicial opinions that interpret the
law, the outcome of the Zenger trial was not the
result of a judicial opinion. However, the acquittal
indicated that the public was opposed to such prose-
cutions. Subsequently, the threat of jury nullification
would discourage similar prosecutions.
The Zenger acquittal resulted from the inde-
pendent decision of the jury to ignore the instruc-
tions of the judge. Modern legal scholars view the
verdict as an example of jury nullification; in other
words, the jury refused to enforce the law because
they thought the prosecution was unfair. Thus,
while the Zenger case did not immediately change
the law, it did set an important political precedent
for a free press, the right of the people to criticize
the government, and the right of a jury to ignore
the technical requirements of the law in order to
protect a defendant from an overbearing govern-
ment. Legal scholar Paul Finkelman argues that
the “case inspired patriots during the Revolution,
supporters of a Bill of Rights during the struggle for
ratification of the Constitution, and opponents of
the Sedition Act of 1798” and “laid the ground-
work for the evolution of the ideology of freedom
of the press.”22
During the proceedings, Zenger was never
called as a witness or said a single word, but the
judgment spoke volumes. Having spent 10 months
in jail, the case also illustrated the threat and nature
of excessive bail. The Zenger case was not the first
in colonial America involving jury independence,
but the acquittal went a long way toward establish-
ing a basic right that would be reaffirmed a half
century later by the Constitution. One of the
main contributors to the drafting of the Constitu-
tion, Governor Morris, wrote, “The trial of Zenger
in 1735 was the germ of American freedom, the
morning star of that liberty which subsequently
revolutionized America.”23
CONCLUSI ONS
The modification of English criminal justice proce-
dures in the New World was the result of numer-
ous abortive attempts to introduce Old World
practices to America. By the mid-eighteenth cen-
tury, the early religious laws of Pennsylvania and
New England had been replaced by English legal
precedents. Paving the road to revolutionary America,
according to the historian David Rothman, “the

mother country had stifled the colonists’ benevolent
instincts, compelling them to emulate the crude
customs of the old world. The result was the pre-
dominance of archaic and punitive laws that only
served to perpetuate crime.”24
Although colonial criminal law was influenced
by English criminal law, it was rarely as severe.
Prior to the outbreak of the American Revolution,
a distinctly American approach to criminal justice
had emerged. American criminal justice was be-
coming more democratic than the English system
and moving toward more humane and rational
punishments as the number of capital crimes was
reduced
and
defendants
were
provided
legal
rights.
Southern criminal codes more closely followed
English antecedents than the northern colonies. In
the South, “concern for status of offender and victim
more closely paralleled the mother country’s.”25
The Puritans played a critical role in the shap-
ing of American values. Although they have fre-
quently been lambasted for their religious zeal and
caricatured as dour prudes, recent research suggests
that almost the opposite was true. Although they
harshly punished fornicators and adulterers, it was
because so much value was placed on the institution
of marriage and the family. Perhaps this explains
their low rates of premarital pregnancy compared
to those of the more secularized southern colonies.
Because the Puritans frowned on public drunken-
ness does not mean that they abstained from alcohol
themselves. The Puritans left a legacy of their work
ethic and moral sensibility that became the founda-
tion of America’s sense of mission. Rejecting the
idea of church courts, the Puritans were committed
to the separation of church and state.
At the beginning of the eighteenth century,
colonial criminal law began to more closely resem-
ble English criminal law. Concerns about labor
scarcity compelled earlier lawmakers to refrain
from more punitive punishments since the contri-
butions of each settler were needed in the New
World. With plenty of labor by the 1700s, there
was more need for order than leniency. Legal
scholars view this period as “an end of an era of
leniency in punishment of crimes against property.”26
By the 1750s, colonial cities were already teem-
ing with gangs of thieves, robbers, and cutpurses.
Ordinary crimes against property flourished. With-
out a professional police force, concern for crime
was on the rise. For almost 150 years, the night
watchman and constables were the sole protection
in urban areas. While crime was much higher in
London than in Philadelphia, it was only because
of higher population density. Jails existed, but the
concept of the penitentiary was still on the horizon.
While punishment was less punitive in the New
World, people still hanged for crimes ranging from
murder, piracy, and arson to repeated acts of rob-
bery. Execution day became a spectacle as crowds
gathered around the gallows to listen to a felon’s
final words and a minister’s sermon.
Point–Counterpoint
Salem Witchcraft Trials (1692)
With few methods to ascertain guilt or innocence, the Pur-
itans of the Massachusetts Colony relied on time-tested
procedures not far removed from the ordeals of the Middle
Ages. In the following passages Increase Mather (1639–
1723), a prominent Puritan minister and leader, supports
certain grounds for convicting individuals of witchcraft.
Arguing against the tests for witchcraft is Thomas Brattle
(1658–1713). An opponent of the Puritan theocracy,
Brattle was born into a wealthy Boston family, graduated
from Harvard, and won distinction as a mathematician
and astronomer.
As to the method which the Salem justices do
take in their examinations, it is truly this. A warrant
being issued out to apprehend the persons that are
charged and complained of by the afflicted children,
… said persons are brought before the justices (the
afflicted being present). The justices ask the appre-
hended why they afflict those poor children; to
which the apprehended answer, they do not afflict

them. The justices order the apprehended to look
upon the said children, which accordingly they do;
and at the time of that look … the afflicted are cast
into a fit. The apprehended are then blinded, and
ordered to touch the afflicted; and at that touch, …
the afflicted ordinarily do come out of their fits.
The afflicted persons then declare and affirm,
that the apprehended have afflicted them. Upon
which the apprehended persons, though of never
so good repute, are forthwith committed to prison,
on suspicion for witchcraft.…
I cannot but condemn this method of the jus-
tices, of making this touch of the hand a rule to
discover witchcraft; because I am fully persuaded
that it is sorcery, and a superstitious method, and
that which we have no role for, either from reason
or religion.… I would fain know of these Salem
gentlemen, but as yet could never know, how it
comes about, that if these apprehended persons
are witches, and, by a look of the eye, do cast the
afflicted into their fits by poisoning them, how it
comes about I say, that, by a look of their eye, they
do not cast others into fits, and poison others by
their looks; and
in
particular, tender,
fearful
women, who often are beheld by them, and as
likely as any in the whole world to receive an ill
impression from them. This Salem philosophy,
some men may call the new philosophy; but I think
it rather deserves the name of Salem superstition
and sorcery, and it is not fit to be named in the
land of such light as New England is.…
But furthermore, I would fain know … what
can the jury or judges desire more, to convict any
man of witchcraft, than a plain demonstration, that
the said man is a witch? Now if this look and touch,
circumstanced as before, be a plain demonstration,
(as their philosophy teaches), what need they seek
for further evidences, when, after all, it can be but a
demonstration? … Yet certain is it, that the reason-
able part of the world, when acquainted herewith,
will laugh at the demonstration, and conclude that
the said Salem gentlemen are actually possessed, at
least, with ignorance and folly.…
Secondly, with respect to … such as confess
themselves to be witches, … there are now about
fifty of them in prison; many of which I have again
and again seen and heard; and I cannot but tell you,
that my faith is strong concerning them, that they
are deluded, imposed upon, and under the influ-
ence of some evil spirit; and therefore unfit to
be evidences either against themselves, or anyone
else.…
These confessors … do very often contradict
themselves, as inconsistently as is usual for any
crazed, distempered person to do.… Even the
judges themselves have, at some times, taken these
confessors in flat lies, or contradictions, even in
the courts; by reason of which, one would have
thought, that the judges would have frowned
upon the said confessors, discarded them, and not
minded one tittle of any thing that they said. But
instead … the judges vindicate these confessors, and
salve their contradictions, by proclaiming, that the
Devil takes away their memory, and imposes on
their brain.…
In the next place, I proceed to the form of their
indictments, and the trials thereupon.
The indictment runs for sorcery and witchcraft,
acted upon the body of such an one … at such a
particular time.… Now for the proof of the said
sorcery and witchcraft, the prisoner at the bar
pleading not guilty.
1.
The afflicted persons are brought into court;
and after much patience and pains taken with
them, do take their oaths, that the prisoner at
the bar did afflict them.… Often, when the
afflicted do mean and intend only the appear-
ance and shape of such an one, (say Goodwife
Proctor) yet they positively swear that Good-
wife Proctor did afflict them; and they have
been allowed so to do, as though there was no
real difference between Goodwife Proctor and
the shape of Goodwife Proctor. This … may
readily prove a stumbling block to the jury,
lead them into a very fundamental error.…
2.
The confessors do declare what they know of
the said prisoner; and some of the confessors
are allowed to give their oaths; a thing which I
believe was never heard of in this world; that
such as confess themselves to be witches, to
have renounced God and Christ, and all that is

sacred, should yet be allowed and ordered to
swear by the name of the great God! …
3.
Whoever can be an evidence against the pris-
oner at the bar is ordered to come into court.
And here it scarce ever fails but that evidences,
of one nature and another, are brought in,
though, I think, all of them altogether alien
to the matter of indictment; for they none of
them do respect witchcraft upon the bodies
of the afflicted, which is the lone matter of
charge in the indictment.
4.
They [the accused] are searched by a jury; and as
to some of them, the jury brought in, that [on]
such or such a place there was a preternatural
excrescence. And I wonder what person there is,
whether man or woman, of whom it cannot be
said but that, in some part of their body or other,
there is a preternatural excrescence. The term is a
very general and inclusive term.…
In short, the prisoner at the bar is indicted for
sorcery and witchcraft acted upon the bodies of the
afflicted. Now, for the proof of this, I reckon that
the only pertinent evidences brought in are the
evidences of the said afflicted.
It is true, that over and above the evidences of
the afflicted persons, there are many evidences
brought in, against the prisoner at the bar: either
that he was at a witch meeting, or that he per-
formed things which could not be done by an or-
dinary natural power; or that she sold butter to a
sailor, which proving bad at sea, and the seamen
exclaiming against her, she appeared, and soon after
there was a storm, or the like. But what if there
were ten thousand evidences of this nature; how
do they prove the matter of indictment! And if
they do not reach the matter of indictment, then
I think it is clear, that the prisoner at the bar is
brought in guilty, and condemned, merely from
the evidences of the afflicted persons.…
As to the late executions, I shall only tell you,
that in the opinion of many unprejudiced, consid-
erate and considerable spectators, some of the con-
demned went out of the world not only with as
great protestations, but also with as good shows of
innocency, as men could do.
They protested their innocency as in the pre-
sence of the great God, whom forthwith they were
to appear before. They wished, and declared their
wish, that their blood might be the last innocent
blood shed upon that account. With great affection
they entreated Mr. C[otton] M[ather] to pray with
them. They prayed that God would discover what
witchcrafts were among us; they forgave their accu-
sers; they spoke without reflection on jury and judges,
for bringing them in guilty, and condemning them.
They prayed earnestly for pardon for all other sins, and
for an interest in the precious blood of our dear Re-
deemer; and seemed to be very sincere, upright, and
sensible of their circumstances on all accounts.…
I cannot but admire that the justices, whom I
think to be well-meaning men, should so far give
ear to the Devil, as merely upon his authority to
issue out their warrants, and apprehend people.
Liberty was evermore accounted the great privilege
of an Englishman; but certainly, if the Devil will be
heard against us, and his testimony taken, to the
seizing and apprehending of us, our liberty vanishes,
and we are fools if we boast of our liberty. Now,
that the justices have thus far given ear to the Devil
I think may be mathematically demonstrated to any
man of common sense: And for the demonstration
and proof hereof, I desire, only, that these two
things may be duly considered, viz.
1.
That several persons have been apprehended
purely upon the complaints of these afflicted,
to whom the afflicted were perfect strangers,
and had not the least knowledge of imaginable,
before they were apprehended.
2.
That the afflicted do own and assert, and the
justices do grant, that the Devil does inform and
tell the afflicted the names of those persons that
are thus unknown unto them. Now these two
thingsbeing dulyconsidered,Ithink it will appear
evident to anyone, that the Devil’s information is
the fundamental testimony that is gone upon in
the apprehending of the aforesaid people.
If I believe such or such an assertion as comes
immediately from the minister of God in the pulpit,
because it is the word of the everliving God, I build
my faith on God’s testimony: and if I practice upon

it, this my practice is properly built on the word of
God. Even so in the case before us, if I believe the
afflicted persons as informed by the Devil, and act
thereupon, this my act may properly be said to be
grounded upon the testimony or information of the
Devil. And now, if things are thus, I think it ought
to be for a lamentation to you and me, and all such
as would be accounted good Christians.…
The chief judge is very zealous in these pro-
ceedings, and says, he is very clear as to all that hath
as yet been acted by this court, and, as far as ever I
could perceive, is very impatient in hearing any-
thing that looks another way. I very highly honor
and reverence the wisdom and integrity of the said
judge, and hope that this matter shall not diminish
my veneration for his honor; however, I cannot but
say, my great fear is, that wisdom and counsel are
withheld from his honor as to this matter, which
yet I look upon not so much as a judgment to his
honor as to this poor land.
But although the chief judge, and some of the
other judges, be very zealous in these proceedings,
yet this you may take for a truth, that there are several
about the Bay, men for understanding, judgment,
and piety, inferior to few, (if any), in New England
that do utterly condemn the said proceedings, and do
freely deliver their judgment in the case to be … that
these methods will utterly rain and undo poor New
England.… Several of the late justices, viz. Thomas
Graves, Esq., N. Byfield, Esq., Francis Foxcroft, Esq.,
are much dissatisfied; also several of the present jus-
tices; and in particular, some of the Boston justices,
were resolved rather to throw up their commissions
than be active in disturbing the liberty of Their Maj-
esties’ subjects, merely on the accusations of these
afflicted, possessed children.
Finally; the principal gentlemen in Boston, and
thereabout, are generally agreed that irregular and
dangerous methods have been taken as to these
matters.… Nineteen persons have now been exe-
cuted, and one pressed to death for a mute: seven
more are condemned; two of which are reprieved,
because they pretend their being with child; one,
viz. Mrs. Bradbury of Salisbury, from the interces-
sion of some friends; and two or three more,
because they are confessors.
The court is adjourned to the first Tuesday in
November, then to be kept at Salem; between this
and then will be [the] great assembly [the General
Court], and this matter will be a peculiar matter of
their agitation. I think it is matter of earnest suppli-
cation and prayer to Almighty God, that He would
afford His Gracious Presence to the said assembly,
and direct them aright in this weighty matter.…
I am very sensible, that it is irksome and disagree-
able to go back, when a man’s doing so is an impli-
cation that he has been walking in a wrong path.
However, nothing is more honorable than, upon
due conviction, to retract and undo, so far as may
be, what has been amiss and irregular.…
Many of these afflicted persons … do say …
that they can see specters when their eyes are
shut, as well as when they are open. This one thing
I evermore accounted as very observable, and that
which might serve as a good key to unlock the
nature of these mysterious troubles, if duly im-
proved by us. Can they see specters when their
eyes are shut? I am sure they lie, at least speak
falsely, if they say so; for the thing, in nature, is
an utter impossibility. It is true, they may strongly
fancy, or have things represented to their imagina-
tion, when their eyes are shut; and I think this is all
which ought to be allowed to these blind, nonsen-
sical girls. And if our officers and courts have appre-
hended, imprisoned, condemned, and executed our
guiltless neighbors, certainly our error is great, and
we shall rue it in the conclusion.
There are two or three other things that I have
observed in and by these afflicted persons, which
make me strongly suspect that the Devil imposes
upon their brains, and deludes their fancy and
imagination; and that the Devil’s book (which
they say has been offered them) is a mere fancy of
theirs, and no reality; that the witches’ meeting, the
Devil’s baptism, and mock sacraments, which they
off speak of, are nothing else but the effect of their
fancy, depraved and deluded by the Devil, and not
a reality to be regarded or minded by any wise man.
And whereas the confessors have owned and
asserted the said meetings, the said baptism, and
mock sacrament, … I am very apt to think, that, did
you know the circumstances of the said confessors,

you would not be swayed thereby, any otherwise
than to be confirmed, that all is perfect devilism, and
an hellish design to ruin and destroy thispoorland. For
whereas there are of the said confessors fifty-five in
number, some of them are known to be distracted,
crazed women; .… Others of them denied their guilt,
and maintained their innocency for above eighteen
hours, after most violent, distracting and dragooning
methods had been used with them, to make them
confess. Such methods they were, that more than
one of the said confessors did since tell many, with
tears in their eyes, that they thought their very lives
would have gone out of their bodies; and wished that
they might have been cast into the lowest dungeon,
rather than be tortured with such repeated buzzings
and chuckings and unreasonable urgings as they were
treated withal. They soon recanted their confessions,
acknowledging, with sorrow and grief, that it was an
hour of great temptation with them.…
But, finally, as to about thirty of these fifty-five
confessors, they are possessed (I reckon) with the
Devil, and afflicted as the children are, and there-
fore not fit to be regarded as to anything they say of
themselves or others.…
What will be the issue of these troubles, God
only knows; I am afraid that his own children, to
afflict and humble them, for some sin they have
been guilty of before Him.…
This then I declare and testify, that to take
away the life of anyone, merely because a specter
or devil, in a bewitched or possessed person does
accuse them, will bring the guilt of innocent blood
on the land.… What does such an evidence amount
unto more than this: Either such an one did afflict
such an one, or the Devil in his likeness, or his eyes
were bewitched.…
. … But then the inquiry is, what is sufficient
proof? …
A free and voluntary confession of the crime
made by the person suspected and accused after
examination, is a sufficient ground of conviction.
Indeed, if persons are distracted, or under the
power of phrenetic melancholy, that alters the
case; but the jurors that examine them, and their
neighbors that know them, may easily determine
that case; or if confession be extorted, the evidence
is not so clear and convictive; but if any persons out
of remorse of conscience, or from a touch of God
in their spirits, confess and show their deeds …
nothing can be more clear.…
If two credible persons shall affirm upon oath
that they have seen the party accused speaking such
words, or doing things which none but such as have
familiarity with the Devil ever did or can do, that’s
a sufficient ground for conviction.… The Devil
never assists men to do supernatural things unde-
sired. When therefore such like things shall be tes-
tified against the accused party not by specters
which are devils in the shape of persons … but by
real men or women … , it is proof enough that
such an one has that conversation and correspon-
dence with the Devil, as that he or she, whoever
they be, ought to be exterminated from amongst
men. This notwithstanding I will add. It were bet-
ter that ten suspected witches should escape, than
that one innocent person should be condemned.…
I had rather judge a witch to be an honest woman,
than judge an honest woman as a witch.

Following the French and Indian War, Britain left
troops in its American colonies to maintain peace
between the Americans and the Indians. From the
start, American citizens were hostile toward at-
tempted peacekeeping measures by the British mili-
tary because troops were not stationed along the
frontiers but instead were left in important coastal
cities, particularly in Boston. As the American
colonies approached the revolutionary era, criminal
justice procedures were still rooted in seventeenth-
century British common law. Trained peace officers
and the penitentiary system as we now know it did
not yet exist. If there was a serious emergency in ma-
jor cities such as Boston or Philadelphia, civilian au-
thorities relied on militia who met annually and
elected their own officers. But drawn from the com-
munity, they could not be counted on to repress po-
litical unrest and mob actions by such “treasonous”
groups as the Sons of Liberty. Therefore, the only real
alternative for peacekeeping was the soldiers of the
British army stationed in important coastal cities.
Sentries who perhaps challenged passersby too exu-
berantly sometimes faced criminal charges for assault
against the peace. As the army became more visible, it
tended to provoke civilians more than maintain
order. Boston resistance to the presence of British
soldiers would culminate in the Boston Massacre
and other seminal events leading to the American
Revolution.
Various historians have speculated on what
might have occurred had an effective police appa-
ratus existed at the time of the American Revolu-
tion. The breakdown of the parish constable police
system was most apparent in Boston in the 1760s, as
mobs of Patriots who undoubtedly included local
constables ran roughshod through the cobblestone
streets. According to police historian Charles Reith,
if there had been an alternative to the parish con-
stable system, “Samuel Adams would be unknown
to history. There would have been no Boston
mobs
worthy
of
historical
mention.
Without
him and his mobs there would have been no war
in the American colonies.”1 There is some doubt
whether the Revolution could have proceeded as
smoothly had there been an effective police system
in place.
The American Revolution took on many of the
characteristics of a civil war, with British troops firing
on British Americans and neighbor sometimes fight-
ing neighbor. After the meeting of the first Conti-
nental Congress in September 1774, steps were
taken for a planned boycott of British goods. Every
county, city, and town appointed local committees
called Committees of Safety to scrutinize the conduct
of citizens and to publish the names of those who
violated terms of the boycott. Individuals reluctant
to participate in the boycott were often physically
intimidated. With many citizens still loyal to the
Crown, active and organized groups rapidly sepa-
rated the colonies into two camps, Tories, or Loyal-
ists, whose sympathies lay with England, and Patriots,
who favored armed resistance.
TH E LAWGI VERS
Since the 1660s, English Parliament attempted to
regulate overseas trade with its colonial empire
through a series of Navigation Acts. New England
merchants resisted these restraints through an inge-
nious campaign of coastal smuggling or bribing cus-
toms agents. If smugglers were caught, they were

tried in nonjuried admiralty courts, but for the most
part these illicit activities were ignored by British
officials, rendering it a period of “salutary (healthy)
neglect.” This period of neglect ended abruptly at
the conclusion of the French and Indian War (also
known as the Seven Years’ War) in 1763. Parlia-
ment introduced new legislation to refill British
coffers and give officials better control over trade.
However,
colonists
continued
smuggling,
and
English officials responded with oppressive mea-
sures known as writs of assistance. These writs
allowed royal officials to use search warrants issued
by courts as devices to hunt down violators of the
customs laws. The writs were viewed as unwar-
ranted infringements on individual privacy and
freedom by the colonists who took seriously the
adage “An Englishman’s house is his castle.” The
violation of this fundamental principle of the com-
mon law by customs officials, who were authorized
to enter any house on suspicion, contributed to the
alienation of the colonists from England.
In 1765, protests and social unrest broke out
throughout the American colonies in response to
the passage of the Stamp Act, the first direct, or inter-
nal, tax that Parliament had ever imposed on the
Americans. Previous to this, only colonial legislatures
had directly taxed their citizens. Colonial leaders
such as Benjamin Franklin and Patrick Henry recog-
nized that if this act were permitted, it would usurp
the taxation functions of individual colonial legisla-
tures, rights that Parliament had tacitly relinquished
in the past. According to the new law, Americans had
to purchase specially stamped paper for newspapers,
pamphlets, college degrees, playing cards, liquor li-
censes, dice, and most legal forms, including marriage
licenses, death certificates, and court documents.
While the purpose of the Stamp Act was to help
pay the cost for British military forces left in America
for the protection of the colonists from Indian at-
tacks, practically all colonists opposed it and resented
the presence of troops in their cities, far from the
Indian frontier. Attempts to circumvent the Stamp
Act led to trials in vice-admiralty courts. These courts
were set up in 1696 in each colony and did not use
juries, so it was only natural that colonists feared that
these special courts threatened the right to trial by
jury.
A special Stamp Act Congress was convened
and led to a systematic plan of opposition to the
tax, while at the same time it still professed its sub-
ordination to the Crown. The Congress maintained
that to remain a free people, no taxes could be
imposed on them without their consent. This Con-
gress was created outside the British constitutional
system and functioned as an extralegal governing
body, working toward a peaceful resolution of the
colonists’ complaints. Patrick Henry expressed this
same thought in a speech delivered to Virginia’s
House of Burgesses in which he proclaimed, “No
taxation without representation.” On the local
level, common people in Boston and other towns
formed an organization known as the “Sons of
Liberty.” That summer, a Boston crowd targeted
the house of city stamp collector Andrew Oliver,
which they destroyed in one fell swoop. This epi-
sode led to the resignation of stamp collectors
throughout the colonies and exposed the inability
of current criminal justice practices to enforce the
peace. Although Parliament repealed the act in
1766, most historians cite the Stamp Act riots as
the beginning of the colonial struggle for indepen-
dence from England.
In the years leading up to the American Revo-
lution, the court and legal systems were rooted in
British common law. Those arrested in political ac-
tions such as the Stamp Act riots faced a court system
based on English common law, and little changed
until the 1770s. At the time of the Declaration of
Independence, the colonies were still using a variety
of court systems established a half century earlier;
Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York had created
their courts as early as the 1690s.
The American legal profession was in its in-
fancy, with few lawyers plying their trade in the
early colonies. Some colonial legislatures even pro-
hibited the practicing of law for fees without a spe-
cial license from the local courts. Most colonies
were
hostile

profession,

governor. If one wished to study law in this era, it
would have to be in England, where more than 100
sons of wealthy American families studied between
1760 and 1776. By the time of the Revolution,
South Carolina and Pennsylvania could claim the
greatest number of lawyers trained at the Inns of
Court in England.
Prior to the American Revolution, the colonial
world was moving away from its homogeneous
roots. The mainly middle- and working-class
English colonies would undergo a demographic
transformation between 1700 and 1775, with the in-
flux of Scots-Irish, German refugees, debtors and
convicts from England, and African slaves. This fea-
ture became the new nation’s greatest strength as well
as a major source for social and political discord.
The U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights
Barely 100 years elapsed between the English Bill of
Rights (1689) and the American Bill of Rights.
Both evolved from the insistence of the citizens
on a recognition by the government of what they
termed their “natural” rights. This idea of a contract
between those governing and those governed can
be traced back to the writings of John Locke and
Montesquieu, political theorists who asserted that
individuals possessed certain natural rights above
and beyond the law of the state. Some of these
rights were considered “inalienable” and could
not be surrendered. A bill of rights was included
in the new nation’s Constitution, and it specifically
enumerated the inalienable rights of the people on
which the state was forbidden to infringe.
Prior to the War of Independence, in some of
the colonies Americans enjoyed more liberties than
their English counterparts. In one important study
of colonial criminal justice, historian Bradley Chapin
listed 16 procedural guarantees found in colonial
codes:
1. No search and seizure without warrant
2. Right to reasonable bail
3. Confessions out of court invalid
4. Right to have cause determined with
reasonable speed
5. Grand jury indictment in capital cases
6. Right to know the charges
7. Straightforward pleading with double jeopardy
barred
8. Right to challenge jurors
9. Process to compel witnesses for the defense
10. Right to confront accusers
11. Trial by jury
12. Limitation of punishment to the convict: no
corruption of blood or forfeiture
13. No cruel or unusual punishment
14. Equal protection of the law: dependent
classes—women, children, and servants—
have access to the courts
15. Equal execution of the law: no capricious
mitigation or application of penalties
16. [Limited] right of appeal2
The U.S. Constitution that was ratified in 1788
included several checks and balances to guarantee
that the central government could not become om-
nipotent. Except for guaranteeing such rights as trial
by jury and the privilege of habeas corpus, the
Constitution did not specifically address individual
rights. Many of the framers of the document were
unhappy with the finished product, which did not
offer enough protection of individual liberties, in-
cluding most of those in the previous list. To rem-
edy this deficiency, 10 amendments, known as the
Bill of Rights, were adopted in 1791.
It may seem surprising that these amendments
identifying personal liberties were left out of the
original document. However, some of the men
who composed the Constitution were hoping to
restrict the rights of common citizens, thus reducing
the power of the ordinary American. But Americans,
many of them veterans of the conflict, had antici-
pated these rights since the Declaration of Indepen-
dence. Others at the Constitutional Convention
represented this perspective and agreed to ratification

of the new government only on the condition that a
bill of rights be added later.
Several of the amendments of the Bill of Rights
have important ramifications for the study of federal
criminal justice. Although the Bill of Rights applied
only to the citizens’ federal rights and federal law
until the mid-twentieth century (see Chapter 11),
the states adopted bills of rights modeled on the
federal bill. As legal historians have made clear,
since the Bill of Rights applied to the federal gov-
ernment and not the states, the amendments did
not “create a national standard.”3 Criminal justice
remained the bailiwick of the states until the 1950s.
It would be more than 150 years before a system
was devised “for coordinating the work of the
states.”4 But, according to one authority, the mere
existence of these standards at this time period
“marked a subtle but important shift in priorities,
away from the emphasis on community order and
toward a preference for individual liberty.”5
The First Amendment affirmed the basic rights
of freedom of religion, speech, and press and the right
to assemble peacefully and to petition the govern-
ment for a redress of grievances. This amendment
provides perhaps the most important protections of
the American democratic system. As previous chap-
ters have demonstrated, there are few, if any, prece-
dents for religious freedom without the interference
of the state.
The Second Amendment, commonly known
as “the right to bear arms,” which protects the right
of states to form militias, is today at the center of
the debate over gun control. Stating that “a well-
regulated militia being necessary to the security of a
free state,” the amendment allows for the existence
of a citizen’s militia. However, critics of gun control
argue that it extends to every citizen the right to
have arms for one’s personal defense. Unlike the
English right to bear arms, which limited ownership
with various specifications, in America gun owner-
ship became ingrained as both a collective duty (mi-
litia) and a personal right (protection).
The Fourth Amendment, prohibiting arbitrary
search and seizure, is derived almost directly from
an English court decision in 1765. The Fifth Amend-
ment’s prohibition against self-incrimination can be
traced back to the 1642 abolition of the Star
Chamber.
Several amendments would figure in future
constitutional challenges to the death penalty. The
Fifth Amendment has been cited for its guarantee
that no person shall be compelled to testify against
himself or herself and for its assurance of due pro-
cess of law in a capital case. The Sixth Amendment
has been summoned for its promise of an impartial
jury in all criminal prosecutions. And the Eighth
Amendment has been used to argue against cruel
and unusual punishments (particularly in cases in-
volving the electric chair).
Following the revolutionary era’s hostilities
with Great Britain and the Constitutional Conven-
tions, the foundation for the federal criminal justice
system was now in place. Along with the Bill of
Rights and the U.S. Constitution, the federal
Crimes Act of 1790 formed its nucleus. The act
changed several punishments that had been popular
in British common law but were prohibited by the
new U.S. Constitution. It defined 17 crimes, rang-
ing from obstruction of process to treason. Death
by hanging was prescribed for six crimes, including
treason,
murder,
piracy,
forgery,
and
helping
individuals convicted of capital crimes escape from
prison. Some aspects of the Crimes Act were rather
unusual. It allowed the body of a person hanged for
murder, at the discretion of the court, to be trans-
ferred to a surgeon for dissection. It was left to the
marshal to carry out the postmortem part of the sen-
tence. If an individual was apprehended while trying
to rescue the body beforehand, he could be fined and
imprisoned. It also permitted benefit of clergy only
after a convicted defendant was branded on his right
thumb. This brand denoted that the individual had
made use of benefit of clergy already and guarded
against repeated attempts.
The Judiciary Act of 1789
The Judiciary Act of 1789 created the federal courts
that exist almost unchanged to this day, including the
Supreme Court. During its first 100 years, justices of
the Supreme Court complained about their heavy
workloads, particularly the requirement that they

“ride circuit.” Without the assistance of separate fed-
eral judges for the federal circuit courts, the early Su-
preme Court justices listened to all federal cases,
whether before the U.S. Supreme Court or circuit
courts. This tradition played an important role in es-
tablishing the concept of a national government and a
federal judiciary.Justiceswere expected to travel long
distances on rough roads and put up with poor ac-
commodations, often under hazardous conditions, to
sit with district court judges at circuit courts. In 1792
alone, the six justices were required to sit at a total
of 27 circuit courts as well as at two sessions of the
Supreme Court.
The Judiciary Act of 1789 also created what be-
came known as the “U.S. attorneys.” The president
was authorized to appoint “a person learned in the
law” in each judicial district to act as attorney for the
United States in all criminal and civil cases in which
the United States had an interest. These attorneys
were appointed with the consent of Congress to
four-year terms (just like the marshal). The act did
not give a title to this position but merely appointed
an attorney in each district. Henceforth, whenever
this position was mentioned in statutes or court de-
cisions, it was referred to as either “district attorney,”
“attorney,” or “United States attorney.” Sometimes
an individual would be referred to by all three terms
in a single statute or legal decision. In 1870, this posi-
tion became more commonly known as “United
States attorney.”
The position of attorney general was also intro-
duced by the Judiciary Act. The attorney general
was created to handle all lawsuits in which the
United States was embroiled as well as to advise
the president on questions of law. For the next
80 years (until the creation of the Department of
Justice in 1870), the attorney general was assisted
by only a small staff that worked together with
U.S. attorneys in the states.
LAW ENFOR C EM ENT
Law enforcement, for the most part, followed the
same patterns from the earliest English colony in
1607 until the end of the American Revolution
in 1781. However, the Enlightenment and more
democratic principles underlying the American Rev-
olution gave rise to many of the basic ideas that influ-
enced modern policing. It was in the eighteenth
century that the dim outlines of American policing
began to take shape. In the more rural areas, sheriffs
and constables were selected from the ranks of the
great landholders and performed the same functions
as their counterparts across the ocean. As in medieval
England, the colonial sheriff was expected to perform
both police and financial duties. As chief financial
officer of the county, he was entitled to 10% of the
tax revenue he collected. From the beginning, the
colonies committed themselves to this style of local
peacekeeping rather than a centralized system of law
enforcement. Today’s decentralized police system in
America, with more than 20,000 police forces and
lacking a national force, is a testament to this earlier
tradition.
In the eighteenth century, the theory of crime
prevention was discussed by several prescient police
officials in Great Britain, but little would come of it
until the nineteenth century. By the late 1700s, it had
become rather obvious that the traditional peace-
keepers of London, such as the constable and night
watch, were no match for the social and economic
transformation of England. England’s population
doubled between 1700 and 1800, aggravating social
tensions. Most English cities increased the number of
constables and watchmen while at the same time
making the transition from voluntary policing to a
paid watch. With an ever-rising crime rate, little
thought was given to innovation until the Fielding
brothers came on the scene.
The Fieldings
Perhaps the most accomplished police reformers of
the eighteenth century, the Fielding brothers of
London laid the groundwork for the subsequent
development of modern policing in nineteenth-
century England and America. An impressive phys-
ical presence at over 6 feet tall, Henry Fielding
(1707–1754) is best remembered as a novelist and
playwright and as author of the novel Tom Jones.

Because of censorship restrictions in the literary
world, he left his writing career behind to become
magistrate in the criminal justice system in 1748.
During his 6-year tenure at this post, he implemen-
ted several policies that led to increased safety on
the streets of London. Fielding introduced the Bow
Street Runners, initially called “Mr. Fielding’s peo-
ple,” a specially formed group of constables who
were expected to run to the aid of crime victims
and in the pursuit of criminals. Henry Fielding
demonstrated his foresight in police matters in
1749 with the publication of his essay An Enquiry
into the Causes of the Latest Increase of Robberies, which
called for the establishment of a professional full-
time police force. Despite the reluctance of the
public to accept a professional police force, Fielding
persisted in his attempts to win the support of the
government for this endeavor.
Following his death, he was succeeded by his
brother John (1721–1780). Blind since birth, John
served as magistrate for several years and in tribute
to his brother kept the Bow Street Runners alive.
His 1755 pamphlet Plan for Preventing Robberies
within Twenty Miles of London explained his strategy
for breaking up organized gangs of robbers that
plagued the periphery of England’s capital city.
An astonishing detective in his own right, blind or
sighted, Fielding was sometimes referred to as the
“Blind Beak” and reportedly could identify thou-
sands of criminals by voice alone. During his tenure
as head of the Bow Street Runners, he made Bow
Street the official police headquarters, where two
horses were always posted at the ready to appre-
hend highwaymen. A police reformer like his
brother Henry, he was perspicacious in his attempts
to implement preventive police strategies. But it
would be almost half a century before the ideas of
the Fieldings became fully integrated into the London
model of policing.
Patrick Colquhoun
Beginning with his appointment as London magis-
trate in 1792, Patrick Colquhoun (1745–1820)
would focus on law enforcement reform for
the next 25 years. He was recognized for his
police acumen after the publication of several
lengthy treatises on police reform. He endorsed
the notion that the government should be respon-
sible for regulating the conduct of the citizenry in-
stead of neighborhood watch groups. This was a
heretical idea at a time when local communities
relied
on
neighborhood
watchmen
and
local
constables.
Colquhoun became interested in police reform
through the work of the Fieldings, leading to the
publication of his book Treatise on the Police of the
Metropolis in 1797. Among the most important po-
lice concepts introduced in this work was the no-
tion of crime prevention, a radical departure for the
traditionally reactive police establishment. Follow-
ing in the footsteps of the Fieldings, Colquhoun
suggested that the police should gather information
on the criminal element, keep a register of known
offenders, and publish a police gazette to assist com-
munication and apprehension of wrongdoers. To
justify these reforms, he reportedly conducted re-
search that estimated that more than 10,000 crim-
inals resided in London.
Colquhoun was credited with the creation of
the Thames River Police in 1789. His writings led
to improved police professionalism and the first sys-
tematic examination of crime costs and origins. An
advocate of paid professional policing and recruit-
ment and management under a central authority
free of political interference, he spurred police re-
form and introduced new solutions for maintaining
public
order
in
an
era
of
urbanization
and
industrialization.
Police Efforts in the Colonies
Various explanations have been given for the rise in
crime in the years preceding the American Revo-
lution. Rising poverty, declining religious zeal, and
urban growth all contributed to a climate of fear
where robberies and burglaries became common
and law-abiding citizens yearned for better law
and order. Some of the earliest strides in countering
the urban crime problem in the American colonies
were taken in Philadelphia. Prior to 1750, the only
street lighting consisted of oil lamps carried by
84

safety-conscious citizens. In 1749, a Quaker-led
citizen group initiated a street-lighting campaign
that included raising funds to pay someone to install
and light the lamps. The following year, these ef-
forts spurred the assembly to chip in to pay for the
initiative. Over the next decade, most major colo-
nial cities adopted this strategy.6 Street lighting was
an important first step toward crime control.
During the revolutionary era, British troops oc-
cupied America’s leading cities, which were usually
important seaports. Throughout most of the war,
the British occupied New York City, where they
were also responsible for police protection. Dissat-
isfied by the British attempts at law enforcement,
New York City residents harkened to the past
and banded together and formed a civilian watch.
In 1773, “Centinel Boxes” were placed around the
city for the use of the watchmen. By the following
year, 16 regular watchmen were on duty every
night. In extraordinary situations, the watch was
augmented using different strategies. On a notori-
ously raucous evening, New Year’s Eve, the city mi-
litia or a military garrison could be called on. The
introduction of a paid night watch in the 1770s re-
presented a great improvement over the citizen’s
watch but did little to stem New York City’sgrowing
crime problem. The growth of the population
brought increased stratification, leading to the con-
comitant development of a dangerous criminal ele-
ment. The night watch could not keep up with the
increasing complexity of urban life. Required to be
on constant vigil in the event of fire or social disorder
while the city slept, the night watch was no match for
the changing conditions. Without the resources or
authority to maintain order, the night watch was out-
matched by their criminal counterparts not only in
New York City but also in most other eighteenth-
century cities around the world.
Following the Revolutionary War and the
evacuation of the British army from New York,
the city’s police problem was amplified by the di-
minished presence of many upper-class Loyalists
who had previously provided an element of stability
to the city’s social structure. War historians have
long noted how the ends of wars were often fol-
lowed by a breakdown in morality, particularly after
armies of occupation vacated sections of town that,
in the case of New York, became districts notorious
for vice and crime. The American army served a
brief interlude as peacekeeper until the city could
resume its civil authority and traditional judicial
processes. Surprisingly, with few innovations in law
enforcement and a burgeoning population, New
York City was recognized as a peaceful law-
abiding community on the cusp of the next century.
But new waves of immigration would auger impor-
tant changes for the criminal justice apparatus of
America’s cities in the next century.
Following the defeat of Britain and its German
mercenaries, America’s colonists were no more
eager for a national police force than they had
been before the outbreak of hostilities. City fathers
were unable to overcome the reluctance of their
citizens to support regular police through taxes.
Ever-vigilant against a standing army and despo-
tism, citizens resisted any efforts in the direction
of uniformed police officers. Some state constitu-
tions even limited the number of night watchmen.
The resilient night watch had clearly outlasted its
initial mandate and was usually under fire for sleep-
ing and drinking on duty while doing nothing con-
cerning crime prevention.
The Birth of Federal Law Enforcement
After ratifying the new Constitution, in 1789 the
U.S. Congress created the nation’s first federal law
enforcement officer late in that year. The Judiciary
Act established the federal judiciary as well as the
office of United States marshal.7 The marshal was
transplanted to America and was readily identifiable
in most colonies. Following the Judiciary Act, U.S.
marshals and their deputies were required to make
arrests while enforcing rulings by the federal courts.
Early marshals were unsalaried but were paid on the
basis of the work they completed. According to
most accounts, the first law enforcement officer
killed in America following the birth of the Repub-
lic was U.S. Marshal Robert Forsyth, who was shot
down in 1794 while trying to serve court papers in
Georgia.

The decades following the American Revolu-
tion were a time of social upheaval and transforma-
tion as the political system made the transition from
one based on British colonialism to an American
republic. The laws set forth by the U.S. Constitu-
tion received their first test in the fall of 1794, when
farmers, distillers, and artisans in southwestern
Pennsylvania protested a federal excise tax on whis-
key through armed demonstrations. Marshals took
early action, quelling the whiskey rebels in 1794. At
issue was the federal government’s early attempts to
raise money by imposing an excise tax on all dis-
tilled liquors. With a depleted treasury, the govern-
ment embarked on an aggressive effort to pay
off the nation’s staggering debt. But the tax brought
the new government into conflict with western
Pennsylvania farmers. Unable to afford to get their
grain to market, these Scotch-Irish farmers distilled
the grain into whiskey, a much easier commodity
to transport. Living on the bleak margins of exis-
tence, the farmers, many of whom were Revolu-
tionary War veterans, were reluctant to cooperate
with the emerging but powerful new government.
Tax collectors and supporters of the tax found
themselves the target of angry farmers who would
rather tar and feather the government representa-
tives than pay their taxes. Several U.S. marshals
were selected to issue summons to 75 distillers to
appear in a Philadelphia district court, but they
were no match for the 500 whiskey rebels who
showed up. As a result, President Washington
took steps to send in the militia. Ultimately, nego-
tiations headed off conflict, and the militia arrested
18 rebel leaders.
Law enforcement and criminal justice figured
little in the discussion of the founding fathers over
which direction the new nation would take. The
only mention of law enforcement in the U.S. Con-
stitution is the power of the president during times of
national emergencies. Historian David R. Johnson
suggested that “there was no debate … as to whether
the new nation should have a national police force,
because such an idea did not occur to them.”8 This
would have important ramifications for future devel-
opments in American policing as it became increas-
ingly decentralized over the next 200 years.
C OR R EC TI ONS
By the time of the American Revolution, three
major categories of confinement existed in Great
Britain, including debtors’ prisons, jails, and houses
of correction (in England better known as bride-
wells). According to the customs of the day, debtors
and their families were often confined together un-
til debts were absolved by creditors or Parliament.
However, prisoner categories often overlapped to
such an extent that jails housed together debtors,
felons, children, and the insane. Complicated and
confusing, penology still resembled that of the Dark
Ages. While similar establishments evolved in
America during the eighteenth century, new theo-
ries of incapacitation would herald the develop-
ment of improved methods of confinement.
Prior to the American Revolution, prison re-
form
experiments
were
already
underway
in
Pennsylvania. Following William Penn’s death in
1718, his penal reform measures were quickly re-
placed by England’s “Sanguinary Laws,” which
remained in effect until the Revolution. Under
Penn’s more lenient Quaker leadership, few crimes
were considered capital offenses. However, once
the colony came under secular leadership, new cap-
ital crimes were added, including burglary, rape,
sodomy, buggery, malicious maiming, certain cases
of manslaughter, arson, and witchcraft.
By the late eighteenth century, men, women,
and children were still mixed together in many
American jails. Before the birth of the modern pen-
itentiary at Walnut Street (Philadelphia) in 1790,
prisoners endured unimaginable squalor. In smaller
facilities, inmates were tethered by chains to the
floors and walls. Prisoners had to rely on charity
for their most basic provisions, and seldom were
beds or bedding provided.
In nascent American communities, the position
of jailer was a lucrative endeavor since they derived
their income from charging the inmates for most
services, including removal of chains, release from
jail, and the furnishing of food and bedding or even
a private cell. Jailers supplemented their income by
selling liquor to their charges. Eighteenth-century
prison life was a raucous affair. The wealthier

prisoners could afford to live in relative comfort and
even leave the prison sporadically. Others might
have their families with them or an occasional pros-
titute. In the years following the American Revo-
lution, England’s jails were bulging with criminals
who could no longer be transported to America. In
response, prisoners were confined in prison hulks
(ships), which were frequently ravaged by typhus
“gaol fever.”
In prerevolutionary America, there was no real
criminal class in the colonies because their labor was
too valuable and colonists were reluctant to spend
precious time and money building jails. But
throughout the eighteenth century, debtors were
often jailed until they could pay their creditors, a
tradition dating back to ancient times. In some col-
onies, the creditor was made responsible for paying
for a debtor’s keep, and if he did not pay the
debtor, he was freed. In some cases, debtors were
allowed to leave their cells during the day to work
or beg on the streets and then return to jail to spend
the evening hours. It was in this way that the indi-
gent sought relief and release from debt in the days
prior to the modern welfare state. By the 1760s,
special “debtors’ prisons” were common. In 1767,
Mt. Holly, New Jersey, was the site of what was
reportedly the first fireproof stone structure in the
country. This edifice was comprised of small cells
for debtors as well as a common room where they
could commiserate together during the day. In
1786, an enterprising Virginian was selected by
county officials to build a log cabin especially for
debtors.
The fact remained that until the nineteenth
century the jail functioned as a holding facility
where convicted persons waited for corporal or
capital punishment or were held until trial. Consid-
ered one of America’s earliest jails for felons, the
Simsbury underground prison was opened by Con-
necticut officials in an abandoned copper mine in
1773, and in 1790 it was designated as the state
prison. Little more than a mine shaft, this vestige
of a more primitive era was the scene of riots and
mayhem from its earliest years. The prison was
hampered by severe overcrowding, so authorities
secured prisoners with iron fetters around their an-
kles so that they could be easily guarded as they
worked inside the prison.
At the local level, early county jails were more
often the residence of the pauper, the ill and insane,
the aged and infirm, the habitual drunkard, or de-
serted wives and orphans rather than of the felons
we expect today. Larger cities might have poor-
houses or almshouses for the relief of the poor or
maybe even workhouses where vagrants could be
imbued with a work ethic. However, when neither
of these edifices was available, the local jail would
suffice.
John Howard
It was not until the late eighteenth century that
prison
reformer
John
Howard
(1726–1790)
brought home to the English public the sad state
of affairs in the country’s prisons. Prior to the mod-
ern penitentiary, prisoners were housed in fetid
convict hulks and jails. Initiated as a temporary
measure in the late 1700s because of prison over-
crowding, the British utilized broken-down war
vessels and abandoned transport ships to hold in-
mates. These “floating hells” or “hell holds” were
anchored in the rivers and bays of Britain as the
prisoners died by the score from disease, malnutri-
tion, floggings, and unsanitary conditions that were
worse than the era’s prisons and workhouses. After
visiting some of these facilities, Howard devoted
himself to prison reform to improve sanitation and
to diminish abuses.
Howard would embark on an examination of
continental prisons and later publicize what he saw
in a series of lectures. His findings led to the re-
moval of the insane from British prisons and sepa-
rating women and children from the men. During
his travels in Europe, Howard was probably most
impressed by the Hospice (Asylum) of San Michele
in Rome. Constructed in 1704, it contained indi-
vidual cells and a system of silence. San Michele was
used exclusively for delinquent boys under the age
of 20 and is considered one of the first institutions
in the world to exclusively house juvenile offen-
ders. As a result of his studies, in 1777 Howard’s
State of the Prisons was published, revealing the

abuses of Europe’s prisons and suggestions for re-
forms. His campaign paid off two years later when
Parliament passed the Penitentiary Act, which initi-
ated four major reforms: provisions for a reforma-
tory regime, secure and sanitary structures, abolition
of fees for basic services, and regular inspections. In
1785, England constructed Wymondham Prison,
England’s first penitentiary. The prison incorpo-
rated many of Howard’s reforms. Cells were furn-
ished for separate types of offenders, and inmates
worked and slept in separate cells. Solitary confine-
ment was deemed more effective than whipping,
and initially the prison was considered an over-
whelming success, so much so that the Quakers
would adopt many of its reforms in the construc-
tion of the Walnut Street Jail in 1790. The philos-
ophy of separate confinement at hard labor as a
mode of discipline became the model for the Penn-
sylvania system of prison discipline in the nine-
teenth century. Howard, a towering figure in
prison reform, the reformer who introduced the
word penitentiary and the philosophy of penitence
for one’s crimes, perished from “gaol fever” in 1790
while visiting Russia. Today his legacy lives on in
so-called John Howard societies, which commem-
orate his name and reform agenda as they continue
to press for prison reform throughout the world.
Benjamin Rush
The Revolutionary War had just ended four years
earlier when a small group of citizens met in 1787
at Benjamin Franklin’s Philadelphia home to discuss
the current state of public punishment in Pennsylvania.
Among those present was 31-year-old Dr. Benjamin
Rush. The youngest Pennsylvania signer of the
Declaration of Independence, Rush was born near
Philadelphia and became the most famous physician
of his era. At this gathering, Rush presented a paper
outlining a new program for treating criminals. His
1787 work “Enquiry into the Effects of Public
Punishments upon Criminals and upon Society”
criticized Pennsylvania’s practice of inflicting humi-
liating public punishment on malefactors. Rush was
a firm believer that “crimes should be punished in
private or not punished at all.” Among Rush’s other
propositions were provisions for classifying prisoners
for housing, a rational system of prison labor that
would lead to each prison becoming self-supporting,
plans for gardens for producing food, and outdoor ex-
ercise for prisoners. In addition, he proposed indeter-
minate periods of punishment and individualized
treatment for convicts according to the nature of their
crimes. Not long after this meeting, Philadelphia
Quakers founded the Philadelphia Society for Allevi-
ating the Miseries of Public Prisons, America’s first
prison reform organization. In 1790, the Pennsylvania
assembly passed legislation that laid the groundwork
for the beginning of modern prison administration
in America.
Walnut Street Jail
The city of Philadelphia proved a source of disap-
pointment for European visitors in the late eigh-
teenth century. Philadelphia was the home of
Benjamin Franklin and the American capital city
(between 1790 and 1800), and visitors such as the
Englishman Isaac Weld found the city tedious and
blandly constructed with “heavy tasteless piles of
red brick.”9 Of all the red-hued buildings, none
surpassed the Walnut Street Jail as an exemplar of
criminal
justice
experimentation
in
the
post-
revolutionary era. Intended to reform rather than
to punish, few could have imagined how this facil-
ity would stimulate the development of the peni-
tentiary in America over the next three decades.
A product of Quaker benevolence and the human-
itarian concerns of Cesare Beccaria, Montesquieu,
Bentham, Howard, and other Enlightenment thin-
kers, the nineteenth-century penitentiary shunned
torture
and
public
humiliation
in
favor
of
imprisonment.
Considered the birthplace of the American
penitentiary,
Philadelphia’s
Walnut
Street
Jail
opened in 1790. Originally used as a workhouse
and debtor’s prison, the Walnut Street facility con-
trasted sharply with the workhouses, prisons, and
jails that already existed. Thanks to Quaker refor-
mers, one wing of the jail was designated to handle
all convicted felons except those sentenced to

death. Unlike its predecessors, the Walnut Street
Jail was used almost exclusively for the “correction”
and rehabilitation of convicted felons. In time,
this system of discipline became known as the
“Pennsylvania system” and was heavily influenced
by the efforts of reformers such as Benjamin Rush.
Contrary to existing penal protocol, Rush en-
visioned a prison system in which convicts were
housed in a large building equipped with single cells
to segregate the more dangerous and disruptive
prisoners. All others were lodged in apartments. Ac-
cording to Rush, gardens could be provided for
prisoner exercise and to grow food. One of his
most prescient notions was that prison industries
should provide marketable products to outsiders
to financially support the prison system. Building
on the writings of Enlightenment thinkers, Rush
saw the purpose of prison punishment as a path to
reformation, the prevention of future crimes, and
the removal of the antisocial from society.
His influence on the design of the Walnut Street
Jail is readily discernible. A precursor to the
Pennsylvania system, the facility called for solitary
confinement without work. It was thought that if
prisoners had nothing to do but reflect on their
crimes, they would reform more quickly. However,
this approach proved to be ineffective and was even-
tually amended. After prisoners began to suffer the
debilitating physical and psychological effects of
solitary confinement, work was introduced along
with moral and religious instruction. In this solitary
complex, each of the 24 cells contained “one small
window, placed high up and out of reach; the win-
dow well secured by a double iron grating, so that,
provided an effort to get to it was successful, the per-
son could perceive neither heaven nor earth, on ac-
count of the thickness of the wall. The criminal,
while confined here, is permitted no convenience
of bench, table, or even bed, or anything else but
what is barely necessary to support life.”10
The offenders housed at Walnut Street were
divided into several classifications that were not
necessarily related to the seriousness of the offense.
More
dangerous
inmates
were
confined
to
6-by-8-foot solitary cells, and separate compart-
ments were provided for women and debtors,
perhaps the greatest advance instituted by the new
facility. In earlier years, all the prison inhabitants
were kept in crowded common rooms. Promiscu-
ous behavior was rampant, and the rooms became
schools for crime as career criminals taught the neo-
phytes the secrets of their criminal trades.
Initially, the Walnut Street Jail met with almost
universal praise. Having introduced prison indus-
tries, health care, educational opportunities, and re-
ligious services to the prison environment, Walnut
Street was widely lauded. But as more and more
prisoners were accepted into the prison, it became
overcrowded, leading to the now familiar riots and
uprisings that continue to plague overtaxed and
poorly run modern prisons. The early success of
Walnut Street Jail led other states to implement
the penitentiary idea (New York, 1796; Virginia,
1800; Massachusetts, 1804; Vermont, 1808; Maryland,
1811; and New Hampshire, 1812).
CRIM E AND PUNISHM ENT
The eighteenth century is often referred to as the Age
of Reason, or the Enlightenment. During this era,
great thinkers, such as Beccaria, Bentham, Howard,
and Penn, had a great impact on the treatment of
criminals. Their efforts resulted in a transition from
corporal
punishment
to
correction
and
laid
the groundwork for the modern penitentiary. While
this rationalistic movement began in England,
the most effective work in the field of criminal justice
reform came from the European continent.
Some of the most convincing ideas aimed at
the reform of criminal jurisprudence flowed from
the pen of the Italian nobleman Cesare de Beccaria.
Unburdened by the limited perspective of a lawyer
or jurist, Beccaria was free to draw his own con-
clusions as an informed outsider. According to
Beccaria, punishment should be certain but equal
for all men regardless of their station in life. He
asserted that punishment “must be essentially pub-
lic, prompt, necessary, the least possible in the given
circumstances, proportionate to the crimes, dictated
by the laws.”11

Beccaria is considered one of the first modern
writers to publicly oppose capital punishment. His
celebrated treatise On Crimes and Punishments, pub-
lished in 1764, was not only an incisive indictment
of the excesses of the Italian criminal justice system;
it recommended reform measures as well. His work
was couched in language that indicted criminal jus-
tice in the world at large. He harshly condemned
the use of torture in punishment and interrogation,
the corruption of state officials, and disproportion-
ately severe penalties for minor offenses. He re-
served some of his harshest comments for the
penal system, which, he argued, should exist solely
to maintain law and order rather than to degrade
prisoners. During the Enlightenment, his theories
laid the groundwork for the subsequent reform
movement
of
the
European
criminal
justice
system.
Beccaria argued forcefully for a humane legal
system and proposed that trials be prompt and that
punishments be fair and impartial and commensu-
rate to the crime. His ideas caught the attention of
numerous jurists and would have a direct influence
on the penal reforms of Pennsylvania in the late
eighteenth century. More than 200 hundred years
ago, Beccaria wrote,
Capital punishment cannot be useful be-
cause of the example of barbarity it pre-
sents. If human passions or the necessities
of war have taught men to shed one an-
other’s blood, the laws, which are intended
to moderate human conduct, ought not to
extend the savage example, which in the
case of a legal execution is all the more
baneful in that it is carried out with studied
formalities. To me it seems an absurdity
that the laws, which are the expression of
the public will, which abhor and which
punish murder, should themselves commit
one; and that, to deter citizens from private
assassination, they should themselves order
a public murder.12
These words carry weight to this day, as capital
punishment in America is once again a hotly de-
bated issue. Beccaria’s ideas proved popular with
some of the most prominent voices of colonial
America. Thomas Jefferson cited Beccaria’s influ-
ence in his composition of a “Bill for Proportioning
Crimes and Punishments in Cases heretofore Capi-
tal” (1778), and Pennsylvania’s Dr. Benjamin Rush
claimed that Beccaria inspired his essay Consideration
of the Injustice and Impolicy of Punishing Murder by
Death (1792). Although Jefferson’s bill was initially
rejected, it was approved later in 1796. However, it
did not eliminate the death penalty in Virginia but
rather limited it to the crimes of murder and
treason.
By the 1790s, hanging was considered the only
legal method of execution for federal crimes. Fol-
lowing the lead of Enlightenment thinkers such as
Beccaria, some of the leading voices of the day,
including Benjamin Rush, argued for the elimina-
tion of the death penalty altogether. The federal
government, in sharp contrast to Great Britain, re-
tained only four capital offenses: murder, treason,
rape, and arson. According to historian Roger
Lane, executions decreased from almost 35 per
100,000 annually to less than five.13 Although no
state
abolished
the
death
penalty
altogether,
Pennsylvania came the closest in 1794 by elimi-
nating the death penalty for all crimes except first-
degree murder.
AM ER ICAN VI OLENC E
Historian Richard Maxwell Brown has suggested
that “violence has accompanied virtually every stage
and aspect of our national existence.”14 America
was created by violence, and violence has remained
part of the nation’s legacy to this day. In the years
leading up to the American Revolution, violence
was a frequent visitor to colonial America. Rela-
tions between the colonists were often more antag-
onistic than their relations with Great Britain.
Conflicts broke out over colonial boundaries, and
tensions sometimes escalated between westerners
and easterners over concerns such as representation,
taxation, Indian policy, and the delayed establish-
ment of government institutions in frontier areas. In

1764, a group of Scotch-Irish frontier settlers from
western Pennsylvania known as the Paxton Boys
descended on Philadelphia, threatening to over-
throw the government. The Quaker-dominated
provincial assembly capitulated to their demands
for better protection against Indian raids for their
homes in Paxton and greater representation in the
provincial assembly.
A tradition developed in the South that tended
to punish property crimes more severely than
crimes of personal violence. The treatment of back-
country violence varied according to region. For
example, during the eighteenth century, Virginia
courts sentenced individuals to death for hog steal-
ing and collected a one-shilling fine for the rape of
an 11-year-old girl. According to historian Edward
Ayers, these values persisted into the nineteenth
century, when the county courts “treated property
offenders much more harshly than those accused of
violence” (see Chapter 6 for more discussion on
southern violence).15
Rioting and mob violence were common
throughout the revolutionary era. Between 1750
and 1800, every one of the original 13 states except
for Virginia experienced large-scale social violence.
Although most of these activities took place in a
rural environment, the cities also experienced lethal
violence during the revolutionary era. Without a
modern police department, citizens formed bands
of regulators and vigilante organizations in futile
attempts to suppress disorder. On other occasions,
sheriff’s posses or the militia could be called in to
enforce the law.
No city saw more mob violence in this era than
Boston, the scene of seminal mob actions that cul-
minated in the Stamp Act riots of 1765, the Boston
Massacre, and the Boston Tea Party of the 1770s.
Revolutionary violence came in many forms. Be-
ginning with mob violence in seaport towns,
American Patriots then resorted to violence to
intimidate Tory sympathizers, often utilizing the
brutal method of tar and feathering, in which in-
dividuals were stripped naked and smeared with a
coat of hot tar and then rolled in feathers.
Finally, large-scale bloodshed broke out with
skirmishes between militia members and British
regulars at Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts.
Next to the American Civil War (1861–1865), the
American Revolution had the second-highest ratio
of casualties to population of any American military
conflict. During the ensuing hostilities, bands of
loosely organized Tories (Loyalists) and Whigs
(Revolutionaries) fought savage guerrilla campaigns
in the backcountry. The Carolinas proved a singu-
larly bloody theater of conflict with atrocities com-
mitted by both sides. Some historians have argued
that the backcountry warfare between Tories and
Patriots in South Carolina introduced a subculture
of violence into the region that persists to this
day.16 Several British officers earned sordid reputa-
tions for violence during the conflict. For example,
Sir James Beard ordered that rum privileges be
revoked for every soldier who took a live prisoner,
leading to the murder of captured rebels. Similarly,
in 1780, Colonel Banaster Tarleton captured a
Virginia regiment and showed them no quarter.
“Tarleton’s Quarter,” as this killing of prisoners
became known, served only to ignite patriotic pas-
sions in backcountry South Carolina and led to
similar outrages by the Americans.
There is little debate that the violence of the
American Revolution furnished ample justification
for the use of violence against enemies for the pub-
lic good. Vigilantism, lynching, and other methods
of violence would sporadically appear in American
history whenever formal mechanisms of law en-
forcement were absent. According to Revolution
historian Gordon S. Wood, the “long tradition of
extra-legislative action by the people, action that
more often than not had taken the form of mob
violence and crowd disturbance,”17 ingrained in
Americans a propensity to utilize extralegal devices
to ensure the sovereignty of the people.
One of the earliest examples of an extralegal
device, though rare in America before the Revolu-
tion, was formal dueling. The first recorded duel
took place in Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1621.
In this incident, two gentlemen had their servants
serve as their stand-ins and duel with swords and
daggers to a standstill. The first fatal duel was re-
ported in Boston a little more than a century later.
While cases of dueling can be found in every

colony, it did not become widely accepted until the
revolutionary era, when officers of the Continental
armies borrowed the practice from their French
allies.
American Vigilantism
With a virtual absence of law enforcement and local
government on the colonial frontier, settlers some-
times organized themselves into vigilante groups to
maintain order. In the rural South, sheriffs and slave
patrols were the main exemplars of law enforcement.
However, citizens occasionally resorted to taking the
law into their own hands, beginning with the “Reg-
ulators,”18 America’s first vigilante organization,
which appeared in South Carolina in 1767.
During the 1760s, organized bands of outlaws
plagued the scattered settlements of the South
Carolina backcountry. After a campaign of terror
by the bandit gangs, which included acts of rape,
theft, torture, kidnapping, and murder, the local
gentry responded by organizing the Regulators to
destroy the outlaw villages that shielded them on
the frontier. The Regulators were organized after
the governor of South Carolina pardoned five of
six criminals convicted for robbery and horse steal-
ing. This group of vigilantes tried, convicted,
and punished the offenders, totally disregarding
the established criminal justice system of South
Carolina.
During a two-year campaign, bandit activity
was eliminated, and the gangs were broken up.
The Regulators, however, did not disband imme-
diately but became the moral arbiters of the colony,
waging a law-and-order crusade against the margin-
alized members of the colony. In the end, they
disbanded when the colony agreed to establish dis-
trict courts and sheriffs to maintain peace in the
county backwaters. A phenomenon peculiar to
America, 326 vigilante operations were documen-
ted by historian Richard Maxwell Brown in the
United States between 1767 and 1904.19
The vigilante movements of the revolutionary
era were confined to the southern backcountry. In
Virginia, vigilantism was legitimated by what be-
came known as “Lynch’s law.” There is some
debate as to the origins of the term since its source
has been attributed to two individuals bearing the
name. William L. Lynch (1724–1820) led a 1780
vigilante movement to purge Pittsylvania County,
Virginia, of lawbreakers. The members of this
group signed a written charter, but the document
did not specifically mention hanging as the punish-
ment, although hanging was typically the punish-
ment for a capital offense. Virginian Charles Lynch
(1736–1796) served as justice of the peace in the
1760s but is best remembered in law enforcement
circles for his participation with other leading citi-
zens in local vigilante activities. Along with other
justices of the peace and militia officers, Charles
Lynch arrested suspects and, following informal
trials, punished anyone who threatened to upset
the traditional social order. A society often on the
edge of anarchy, Loyalists, slaves, Indians, and
English officials were all viewed with distrust and
at one time or another might find themselves teth-
ered to the whipping post, where Lynch law was
administered. Although both Lynches have been
cited as the possible inspiration for the term lynching,
the term’s origins are still inconclusive.20
There was a darker side to American vigilante
movements that essentially operated outside the
boundaries of the legal system. In the case of the
South Carolina Regulators, heady from their suc-
cess at stifling the outlaw bands, they were not con-
tent to cease and desist once the menace was erased.
Subsequently, the vigilantes aimed their “police
functions” at the lower classes, whom they chastised
for not living up to the Regulators’ moral standards
and work ethic. According to their new “Plan for
Regulation,” Regulators embarked on a crusade
against the vagrants, idlers, and dissolute women
of the backcountry, employing such violent me-
chanisms of social control as flogging, ducking,
and various corporal punishments. In opposition,
the settlers formed the “Moderators” to counter
the Regulators. By 1769, peace was restored to
South Carolina after Charleston’s governor and as-
sembly acquiesced to the Regulators’ requests to
establish circuit courts.
By the 1760s and 1770s, a distinctive American
identity emerged, one that reflected an increasingly

“republican” society that emphasized personal inde-
pendence and public virtue and that scorned the
notion of concentrated power in the hands of the
few. At the same time, many (though not all)
Americans rejected the governing attributes of
Great Britain, which hinged on its landed aristoc-
racy, political corruption, patronage, and bureau-
cracy. The beginning of the imperial struggle
between the colonies and Great Britain and the
subsequent Declaration of Independence were the
byproduct of a series of British abuses of power.
Initially, American leaders were not outspoken in
their opposition to the new Navigation Acts. They
defended the British constitution and assumed that
their grievance would be resolved. By 1776, how-
ever, it was too late. When Parliament began to
directly tax Americans, regulate their intercolonial
trade, station troops in their cities, and prohibit set-
tlers from moving westward, Americans saw these
as efforts to deprive them of their property and
freedom.
NOTABLE TRIALS
Boston Massacre Trial (1770)
Resentment against oppressive English tax measures
had declined in most colonies but was reinvigorated
after the so-called Boston Massacre. In the late 1760s,
British warships disembarked infantry and cannon for
police duty in Boston to “rescue the Government
from the hands of a trained mob.” The British “lob-
sterbacks” (so named for their bright red uniforms)
were intended as part police force and part army of
occupation. Off duty, the soldiers often supplemen-
ted their pay with daily dock work, causing deep
resentment from patriotic day laborers. Deep antag-
onism developed between the soldiers and the local
inhabitants, leading to the pivotal events of that cold
March night in 1770.
Local Patriot leaders were determined to rid
the city of the British army of occupation. Crowds
often convened in front of the Customs House, the
symbol of British oppression. It is unknown
whether the crowd that showed up to taunt the
solitary sentry on that March night assembled by
deliberate design, but the day before there had
been trouble at the docks between off-duty soldiers
and local longshoremen. Alarmed, the lone sentry
called for help, and Captain Preston and seven sol-
diers responded. In the subsequent confusion, the
soldiers, apparently without any orders, fired into
the crowd, killing five and wounding more than a
dozen others. The Massachusetts governor called
for calm, promising the outraged citizens that jus-
tice would be done. Soon the captain and eight
men stood trial for murder. The ensuing trial offers
a conspicuous example of Anglo-American justice
in action.
No experienced lawyer would agree to defend
the eight British soldiers until Patriots Josiah
Quincy and John Adams, the cousin of Patriot
leader Samuel Adams, offered to do so. Many
Boston Patriots charged that they lacked patriotism.
There was little for the lawyers to gain. Compensa-
tion for the emotionally charged case amounted to
about one week’s wages for a working man.
It was decided that Captain Preston would be
tried separately from his men. Despite requests by
the soldiers for a joint trial, they were denied with-
out explanation. Apparently, the soldiers felt that if
Preston were tried first and denied giving orders to
fire, then the subsequent defense of the eight sol-
diers would be compromised.
The trial was apparently transcribed in short-
hand, but no copy survives. Preston’s testimony
has been determined by the existing deposition
that he gave before the trial. As part of the defense,
34-year-old Boston attorney John Adams quoted
from Beccaria’s recently translated On Crimes and
Punishments, proclaiming, “If I can but be the in-
strument of preserving one life, his blessing and
tears of transport shall be sufficient consolation to
me for the contempt of all mankind.” Adams is
credited with creating some doubts of Preston’s
culpability among the jurors. The 12 jurors, who
had been sequestered on a meager diet of “biscett
and cheese and syder,” deliberated quickly and two
hours later returned with an acquittal on all charges.
The transcripts for the trial of the soldiers, or
the Rex v. Weems case, has survived and offers a

thorough account of the proceedings. Forty wit-
nesses would eventually testify. After deliberating
three hours, the jury came back with an acquittal
for six of the eight soldiers. The other two were
convicted of manslaughter. Pleading “benefit of
clergy,” the soldiers escaped imprisonment and
were instead branded on their right thumbs.
Contemporary records indicate that the behav-
ior of certain segments of the crowd was as respon-
sible for the tragedy as the soldiers. No matter, for
the incident was grossly exaggerated for propaganda
purposes. Hundreds of colonial Americans pinned
on their walls copies of master silversmith Paul Re-
vere’s rendering of the “massacre” as a constant re-
minder of British transgressions. Imbued with the
traditional rights of Englishmen who cherished the
privileges and immunities of the freeborn, the citi-
zens of Massachusetts and elsewhere could not be
assumed to relinquish their expectations. Im-
mensely proud of his actions in the courtroom,
John Adams would look back on his stellar career
that would eventually take him to president and
note that his involvement in the defense was “one
of the most gallant, generous, manly, and disinter-
ested Actions of my whole Life, and one of the best
Pieces of service I have ever rendered my country.
Judgement of Death against those soldiers would
have been as foul a Stain upon this Country as
the Executions of the Quakers or Witches.”
According to Boston Massacre historian Hiller
B. Zobel, this incident can be remembered as
“The Birth of American Justice” or perhaps “Even
the Guilty Deserve a Fair Trial.”21
CONCLUSIONS
Criminal justice historian Samuel Walker noted
that “the American Revolution had a major impact
on criminal justice, speeding up the process of re-
form and accentuating the differences between
American and English law.”22 According to one
scholar, the era of the American Revolution saw
the development of three different criminal justice
systems—for whites, blacks, and Indians.23 By the
end of the eighteenth century, the influx of
Europeans with non-English backgrounds found a
confusing and unfamiliar criminal justice system.
While the emergence of the American criminal
justice system was still years away, by the end of the
revolutionary era aonce-beleaguered legalprofession
was flourishing: 25 of the 56 signers of the Declara-
tion of Independence and 31 of the 56 members of
the Constitutional Convention were practicing
lawyers.
By the late eighteenth century, Pennsylvania
had abolished the barbaric “bloody code” of Great
Britain, which imposed capital and corporal punish-
ment for a broad array of offenses. Other states
followed suit so that by 1800 most states authorized
capital punishment only for murder and treason.
During the same period, fines and imprisonment
were substituted for the punitive measures of
mutilation and exhibitory forms of punishment.
Between 1794 and 1814, most states had been
inspired by the Walnut Street experiment to build
their own model penitentiaries, launching a new
era in the treatment of criminals.
The Declaration of Independence, the Articles
of Confederation, and the U.S. Constitution signify
three successive stages in the development of America
and a government of laws where “law was king”
and not of hereditary monarchy. The decade of
the 1790s was a formative era in the nation’s his-
tory. It saw the inauguration of the first periodic
national census in history, the country’s first federal
criminal statute (which defined which crimes were
subject to federal prosecution), and the construc-
tion of the first modern penitentiary. Also estab-
lished in the 1790s by the First Congress was the
position of attorney general. Prior to the creation
of the Department of Justice, the first attorney
general maintained his own legal practice while
acting as a legal adviser to the president. Until
the Department of Justice was created in 1870,
to the detriment of federal criminal justice the at-
torney general was assisted by a relatively small
coterie of clerks and messengers.
At the turn of the nineteenth century, America
was still overwhelmingly rural, with only Philadelphia
and New York possessing populations of more

than 25,000. With most Americans still living along
the Atlantic seaboard, the country’s population was
only a quarter of England’s and one-sixth of
France’s. But from 1750 to 1800, the population
would explode from 1.17 million to 5 million, cre-
ating new problems for the developing criminal
justice system. The era of the American Revolution
furnished the foundation for the subsequent devel-
opment of more modern criminal justice institutions
during the first half of the nineteenth century. But
first, more effective police agencies, courts, and
prisons would have to be established.
Point–Counterpoint
Interpreting the Second Amendment
Few constitutional issues have been more hotly debated than the
“right to bear arms” clause in the Second Amendment: “A well
regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed.” The debate over the wording of this amendment has
resulted in several popular interpretations. On one hand, gun
control advocates have stressed the clause related to militias,
asserting that the purpose of the amendment was to protect the
formation of militias in the face of government intrusions.
Opponents of gun control have focused on a “militia of the
whole” made up of all healthy white males. They were expected
to perform their duties with privately owned weapons. Rather
than viewing the clause as a qualifying clause, many advocates
cite it as more an amplification or mandate of the need for a
“well-regulated militia.” There is little doubt this controversy
will never be put to rest.
In the following passage a Tennessee resident named
William Aymette appealed his conviction for carrying a
concealed Bowie knife in violation of state law. In 1840 the
Supreme Court of Tennessee rejected Aymette’s contention
that the right to bear arms was not specific, and that he had
understood it to mean the right to carry any weapon. The
Court made an important distinction here: There is a dif-
ference between weapons useful for the common defense and
those that are not (the civilized-warfare test).
AYM ETTE VS. THE STATE
1. The act of 1837-8, ch. 137, sec. 2, which
prohibits any person from wearing any bowie knife,
or Arkansas tooth-pick, or other knife or weapon in
form, shape or size resembling a bowie knife or
Arkansas tooth-pick under his clothes, or concealed
about his person, does not conflict with the 26th
section of the first article of the bill of rights, secur-
ing to the free white citizens the right to keep and
bear arms for their common defence.
2. The arms, the right to keep and bear which
is secured by the constitution, are such as are usually
employed in civilized warfare, and constitute the
ordinary military equipment; the legislature have
the power to prohibit the keeping or wearing
weapons dangerous to the peace and safety of the
citizens, and which are not usual in civilized
warfare.
3. The right to keep and bear arms for the
common defence, is a great political right. It re-
spects the citizens on the one hand, and the rulers
on the other; and although this right must be invi-
olably preserved, it does not follow that the legisla-
ture is prohibited from passing laws regulating the
manner in which these arms may be employed.
At the January term, 1840, of the circuit court of
Giles county, Judge Dillahunty presiding, an indict-
ment was filed against William Aymette. This indict-
ment charged: 1st. That Aymette on the 26th day of
June, 1839, in the county of Giles, “did wear a certain
bowie knife under his clothes, and keep the same
concealed about his person, contrary to the form of
the statute,” &c. 2d. “That on the same day, &c., the
said Aymette did wear a certain other knife and
weapon, in form, shape and size resembling a bowie
knife, and under the clothes of him the said Aymette,
and concealed about the person of him,” &c.
The defendant pleaded not guilty, and the case
was submitted to a jury at the October term, 1840,
Judge Dillahunty presiding.
It appeared that Aymette, during the sitting of
the circuit court in June, 1839, at Pulaski, Giles
county, had fallen out with one Hamilton, and
that about 10 o’clock, P.M. he went in search of
him to a hotel, swearing he would have his heart’s

blood. He had a bowie knife concealed under his
vest and suspended to the waistband of his breeches,
which he took out occasionally and brandished in
his hand. He was put out of the hotel and pro-
ceeded from place to place in search of Hamilton,
and occasionally exhibited his knife.
The jury, under the charge of the court, re-
turned a verdict of guilty.
The defendant moved the court in arrest of
judgment, but the motion was overruled and the
defendant sentenced to three months imprisonment
in the common jail of Giles county, and to pay a
fine of two hundred dollars to the State. From this
judgment defendant appealed in error.
To bear arms in defence of the State, is to em-
ploy them in war, as arms are usually employed by
civilized nations. The arms, consisting of swords,
muskets, rifles, &c., must necessarily be borne
openly; so that a prohibition to bear them openly,
would be a denial of the right altogether. And as in
their constitution, the right to bear arms in defence
of themselves, is coupled with the right to bear
them in defence of the State, we must understand
the expressions as meaning the same thing, and as
relating to public, and not private; to the common,
and not the individual defence.
But a prohibition to wear a spear concealed in a
cane, would in no degree circumscribe the right to
bear arms in defence of the State; for this weapon
could in no degree contribute to its defence, and
would be worse than useless in an army. And, if, as
is above suggested, the wearing arms in defence of
the citizens, is taken to mean, the common defence,
the same observations apply.
We think, therefore, that upon either of the
grounds assumed in this opinion, the legislature had
the right to pass the law under which the plaintiff in
error was convicted. Let the judgment be affirmed.

In the four decades following the American Revo-
lution, experimental steps were taken toward orga-
nizing American criminal justice procedures and
institutions. Post-revolutionary American criminal
justice made the transition to the nineteenth century
with groundwork for an organized correctional sys-
tem. Meanwhile, the state of law enforcement lagged
far behind, still firmly rooted in the community-
oriented volunteer policing of the previous centuries.
But developments in Great Britain and France would
soon find voice in the emergence of organized
24-hour police forces in several major American cities
in the first half of the new century.
One of the most important criminal justice mea-
sures enacted by the First Congress in 1789 was the
approval of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which estab-
lished the Supreme Court, divided the country into
districts, and established the parallel structure of federal
and state courts. Each district had a court that was given
jurisdiction over crimes that were “cognizable under
the authority of the United States.” Most penalties ran
the gamut from small fines and short terms of impris-
onment to whipping and longer prison terms.
The Judiciary Act also established the positions
of U.S. marshal and U.S. district attorney for each
district. The ratification of the Bill of Rights two
years later completed the construction of the early
federal criminal justice system. Although a depart-
ment of justice was not initially created, the posi-
tion of attorney general was initiated as legal adviser
to the president.1
Despite the American Revolution’s promise of
natural rights and equality, there still existed wide-
spread opposition to the emancipation of slaves in the
aftermath of the war. Warfare had also interrupted
the cooperative antislavery efforts of American and
British Quakers. In 1777, Vermont’s constitution
became the first to specifically abolish slavery. Judicial
decisions in Massachusetts (1783), Connecticut
(1784), and Rhode Island (1784) would follow
Vermont’s example. However, other states were
more reluctant, with gradual emancipation accepted
in New York (1799) and New Jersey (1804). New
York would finally abolish slavery in 1827.
According to the first census in 1790, the nation
was still rural in character, with the majority of Amer-
icans living near the Atlantic coast. Although the
center of population was clustered around the
Chesapeake Bay, the West was the most rapidly
growing part of the nation. Between 1790 and 1800,
American society made incredible economic advances,
measured in the growth of banks, corporations, and

transportation companies. With the construction of
the country’s first mechanized factories, American
industry was soon producing a cornucopia of items,
ranging from nails and hats to firearms.
Between 1790 and 1820, at least 250,000 immi-
grants arrived in America, contributing to increasing
social tensions in urban areas as well as mob violence.
Beginning in the colonial era and continuing to this
day, immigrant minorities have been victimized by
those that preceded them, with established groups
showing little tolerance for diversity. Recent immi-
grants were expected to shed their foreign traditions
and quickly assimilate if they wished to prosper. In
the years surrounding the American Revolution,
the largest non-English immigrant groups were Irish-
Catholics and Germans, immigrants who would often
be targeted asscapegoats for social problems. The Prot-
estant majority in the New World restricted their eco-
nomic and political opportunities. Some colonial
laws prohibited Catholics from voting or holding gov-
ernment offices. An economic, social, and political
transformation of America occurred from 1790 to
1830. As the nation’s population became more diverse
and cities more populated, the developing criminal
justice structures were faced with the task of coming
to termswith new tensionsexacerbated by the turmoil.
When the War of 1812 halted the commercial
trade between America and Great Britain, a factory
system began to flourish in New England, joining
the American economy to the Industrial Revolu-
tion. After the War of 1812, crime increased as
soldiers returned home to unemployment. A grow-
ing population and rising industrialization led to a
new class struggle that would take its place next to
the growing sectional conflict.
THE LAWGIVER S
Following the Revolution, there was an increasing
willingness among Americans to disregard British
precedents of criminal law. This in part was stimu-
lated by the fact that in many new cases there were
no legal precedents to rely on. After the defeat of
Great Britain, America became the first modern na-
tion to design a system of government based on
certain basic philosophical principles. Most of the
states designed new constitutions based on republi-
can goals and ideals to specifically curb the abuses
that provoked the Revolution. Each state constitu-
tion included provisions to limit executive power
and included a bill of rights guaranteeing freedom
of the press, freedom of religion, and the right to a
jury trial. With the fear that the new federal system
might give too much power to one government
body, each state constitution reflected the sover-
eignty of the people.
Criminal Courts
After the War of Independence, the former colo-
nies agreed to relinquish a measure of their newly
won independence to a central government. But
these powers were limited and clearly defined.
The acceptance of the Constitution ensured that
powers not specifically conferred to the federal gov-
ernment would remain with the states. In due
course, each state created a criminal justice system
to be enforced by their own courts. For example, a
New York citizen accused of keeping a disorderly
house would be tried in county or local courts un-
der the domain of New York State. However, if
the charge was federal postal robbery, a federal of-
fense, the case would come before a federal judge.
As criminal justice procedures became increasingly
complex during the nineteenth and twentieth cen-
turies, criminals often found themselves wanted by
both federal and state authorities, creating compli-
cated jurisdictional issues.
Although they are now abolished in England,
grand juries adopted by the new states offered an ad-
ditional safeguard to accused persons. A federal grand
jury was composed of between 16 and 23 members, at
least 12 of whom must agree that there is a prima facie
case against an accused person before an indictment
can be issued and a trial held before a petit jury.
The Supreme Court
In 1790, the Supreme Court held its first two sessions
in New York City’s Royal Exchange Building.2

justices were little appreciated by constituents who
had recently won independence from England. Dur-
ing its first 10 years, the Court handled few matters of
significance and was little considered during the con-
struction of the new Capitol building in Washington.
The low standing of the nascent Court was symboli-
cally demonstrated by the construction of the new
Capitol without any chamber reserved for the
Supreme Court. When the seat of government
made the transition to the banks of the Potomac
River, the Supreme Court was assigned to an undig-
nified room in the basement under the Senate
Chamber. According to one visitor, “A stranger
might traverse the dark avenues of the Capitol for a
week, without finding the remote corner in which
Justice is administered to the American Republic.”
With the ascendance of John Marshall to chief justice
in 1801, all this would change.
John Marshall
Born into the Virginia plantocracy in 1755, despite
little formal education (tutored at home by parents),
Marshall was appointed chief justice of the Supreme
Court by President John Adams in 1801. Over the
next 35 years, his decisions would lay the ground-
work for American constitutional law. During his
term as chief justice, Marshall was credited with
writing 519 of the 1,106 decisions issued by the
highest court of the land. Among his most impor-
tant cases was Marbury v. Madison (1803), which
established the principle that the Supreme Court
has the final word over whether an act of Congress
or a state legislature violated the U.S. Constitution.
This opinion laid down the doctrine of judicial re-
view, which to this day remains the cornerstone of
constitutional law.
Marshall’s imprint on constitutional law cannot
be underrated. If not for his powerful intellect and
direction, a lesser chief justice may have employed a
more uncompromising construction of the lan-
guage of the Constitution. Well-versed in the legal
implications of the Constitution for the solidifica-
tion of the new republic, Marshall interpreted the
document in the broadest national sense. Ever the
proponent of a strong central government, his
decisions left a legacy demonstrating his support of
the Constitution.
The Alien and Sedition Acts
In 1797–1798, America witnessed one of its first in-
ternational scandals when it was revealed in the
American press that agents of the French govern-
ment had attempted to extort money from Ameri-
can ambassadors instead of publicly negotiating a
treaty with them. The XYZ affair—which alluded
to three French agents known only as X, Y, and Z—
resulted in a backlash of anti-French sentiment
against America’s former ally.
More important, this cause célèbre led to the
passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts, measures
that provided an early test for the Bill of Rights.
A series of legislative acts passed in 1798, the Alien
and Sedition Acts included the Naturalization Act,
the Alien Act, the Alien Enemies Act, and the
Sedition Act—legislation that targeted immigrant
populations and prescribed new procedures for
attaining citizenship. It also established an element
that would run throughout American history: the
creation of a category of aliens, outsiders who were
measured or impugned for their otherness.
The Alien and Sedition Acts were promulgated
in an era during which the boundaries of the new
country were still being determined; thus, national
security was an issue of paramount importance. Of
the four laws, the most controversial was the Sedi-
tion Act, which clearly impinged on accepted civil
liberties. The Alien and Sedition Acts proved an
early test of the First Amendment’s protection of
free speech and free press. The Sedition Act barred
individuals from speaking or printing “any false,
scandalous and malicious writing” about the presi-
dent or Congress. Despite intense criticism by
Thomas Jefferson and his supporters, the Sedition
Act was not immediately abolished. However, the
debate over the act brought a wide-ranging exami-
nation of the “issues of free speech and free press in
a republican society.” According to legal historian
John E. Semonche, “Lessons were learned, and
more than a century would pass before Congress
would again inhibit free political discussion.”3

During the administration of President John
Adams, this legislation targeted unpatriotic speech
and brought into question the boundaries of freedom
of the press and freedom of speech. According to the
act, “any person [who] shall write, print, utter, or
publish, or shall cause or procure to be written,
printed, uttered or published … any false, scandalous
and, malicious writing or writing against” the gov-
ernment could be accused of sedition. To regulate
criticism of the presidential regime, the office was
given broad powers to squelch criticism of presiden-
tial policy or the office itself. From 1798 to 1800,
close to 25 individuals were charged with seditious
offenses, and 10 were convicted.
Besides official sanctions, many individuals
were targeted through an informal campaign of vi-
olence and harassment as mobs of young Federalists
(Anglophile supporters of the president and a strong
central government) roamed the streets attacking
supposed enemies of the state who often included
emigrant political writers, Francophiles, and Radi-
cal Republicans (who supported the republican
politics of Thomas Jefferson and were thus per-
ceived as anti-British, hence “un-American”). Fol-
lowing the election of Thomas Jefferson over John
Adams in 1800, the acts were allowed to languish
unused as Jefferson pardoned convicted defendants
in an attempt to end political partisanship. His proc-
lamation that “we are all federalists; we are all re-
publicans” laid to rest for the time being this threat
to individual liberties. However, some of the Alien
and Sedition Acts would be revived sporadically
under future wartime conditions.
LAW ENFOR C EM ENT
The birth of modern policing in the nineteenth
century came after centuries of static and unsuccess-
ful attempts at law enforcement. The end of the
American Revolution coincided with the gradual
curtailment of patronage in favor of the popular
election of constables and sheriffs. By the late eigh-
teenth century, American communities were still
largely reliant on self-policing. In the first decades
of the nineteenth century, several cities began to
incorporate a day watch to supplement the tradi-
tional night watch.
In a time before large cities, property and personal
crime rates were not considered much of a problem.
But by the turn of the nineteenth century, social
change augured by increasing urbanization necessi-
tated a reevaluation of the existing law enforcement
systems. Prior to the American Revolution, most
sheriffs and high constables were appointed by the
Crown. Following the war, these positions were filled
by supporters of local political leaders. Rooted in the
concept of popular sovereignty, early officials of the
Republic were elected by theirneighbors. The history
of early American policing was the history of distinctly
different forces in different cities. By the early nine-
teenth century, American policing was still firmly
rooted in the English system of part-time magistrates,
sheriffs, constables, and the occasional paid watchman.
The federal government provided no direction
for the construction of police forces. In rural Amer-
ica, it was left to elected sheriffs and their deputies
to maintain peace and to arrest malefactors. As the
country moved farther west, the task of policing
increasingly fell under the domain of the army, fed-
eral marshals, or anyone carrying a gun.
As the nation struggled with urbanization and
industrialization during the first decades of the nine-
teenth century, communities created civil police
forces, making the transition from amateur, unpaid
watchmen to more formal arrangements. Port cities
such as Boston, New York, and Philadelphia endured
growing pains in the late eighteenth century, and the
old reliance on the community consensus broke
down. In the new century, Boston became the first
city to require by statute the maintenance of a perma-
nent night watch with pay fixed at 50 cents per night.
In 1807, Boston established its first police districts, and
by 1823, the city had selected a Harvard graduate as its
first marshal.
While the United States continued to make
headway in communications and transportation,
American law enforcement continued to rely on
outdated
seventeenth-century
police
methods.
The nineteenth century saw the dawning of a
more complicated urban environment, but city

fathers persisted in responding to growing crime
problems by adding more watchmen.
The French Police System
The early development of police forces in Europe
was stimulated by their affiliation with the state.
France introduced the office of lieutenant of police
as early as 1667. Charged with suppressing crime,
this office became a political office of considerable
importance in the Napoleonic era (1799–1815) un-
der Joseph Fouche. Considered the father of police
intelligence operations, he served as minister of po-
lice during most of Napoleon Bonaparte’s tenure as
emperor. An early proponent of preventive polic-
ing, Fouche is credited with establishing a central-
ized police force that was responsible to the national
government. The French police system was consid-
ered superior to anything the British had to offer in
peacekeeping during the early nineteenth century.
According to police historian Philip Stead, “Paris
was safer for the individual than was London in
the eighteenth century,”4 noting the contrasts be-
tween London’s watchmen and parish constables
and Paris’ centralized police system manned by
armed and professional officers.
The development of the French police was
given early stimulus in 1817 when the French con-
vict Eugene Vidocq (1775–1857) was given the job
of setting up a brigade of detectives known as the
Surete. Former criminals like Vidocq, these early
detectives saw spectacular results, credited with
more than 750 arrests in their first year of operation.
Surete would go on to earn international renown
over the next century and is considered an inspira-
tion for the creation of International Criminal
Police Organization (Interpol) and the Scotland
Yard Criminal Investigation Department (CID).
Following a stint in the military, Vidocq fell in with some
unsavory characters before winning acclaim as an escape
artist after escaping from prison three times. Released
from prison, he was placed in command of a group of
ex-convicts who became the nucleus of the Surete (now
the Police Judiciare). Considered the world’s first private
detective, Vidocq employed numerous police detection
techniques considered standard procedures today,
including disguises, decoys, informants, autopsies,
blood tests, ballistics, criminal files, and handwriting
analysis. He directed the Surete until his retirement
in 1827.
The London Metropolitan Police
During the early nineteenth century, London polic-
ing gradually came to grips with the growing crime
problem. With the defeat of Napoleonic France in
1815, thousands of soldiers returned home to
England looking for jobs and places to live. Like
most wars, the Napoleonic Wars were followed
by a period of unemployment. With the added tran-
sition to a factory-based economy that favored
machine over man, the unemployment situation es-
calated. As London grappled with the growing pains
of the Industrial Revolution, pressure mounted for
more professional law enforcement. To combat the
rising social unrest and riots, the army was often
called on to handle the situation, leading to bloody
incidents such as the Peterloo Massacre (1819), in
which government troops fired into a crowd, killing
11 and wounding 400, including 100 women.
Although there was a growing constituency in
favor of a police force, most British opposed the idea.
With a tradition that ran counter to the centralized
police system in vogue in continental Europe, British
reformers envisioned a preventive police system
rather than one in the oppressive punitive tradition
of the Napoleonic police. One of the toughest bar-
riers in creating a London police force was convinc-
ing the inhabitants that a police force would not be
used as spies and persecutors as it was in France. It
would prove a daunting mission to convince Lon-
doners that the police could help protect the public
and keep order without spilling innocent blood.
By 1828, steps had been taken toward creating a
professional police force. In that year, Home Secre-
tary and future prime minister Robert Peel con-
trolled almost 450 policemen, including officers of
the Thames River Police, the Bow Street foot and
horse patrols, and nine police offices. A rather insig-
nificant force for a city of 1.5 million people (one
officer per 3,000 citizens), this number paled in

comparison to Augustan standards of ancient Rome.
The London police were supplemented by 4,500
ineffective Charlies, a remnant of the seventeenth
century.
Building on the innovations of the Fielding
brothers, Patrick Colquhoun, and others, in 1829
Home Secretary Robert Peel led through Parliament
a bill that created the Metropolitan Police to replace
the outdated watch system. A firm proponent of the
adage that it was better to prevent crime than to pun-
ish and investigate in the aftermath of the crime, Peel
was cautious in implementing his reforms lest he
arouse the fears of his electorate.
Peel had originally hoped to create a nation-
wide police force, but this suggested oppression and
totalitarianism to his constituency. Peel realized that
he would have to focus his ambitions on a more
concentrated area, so he selected London, which at
that time was awash in crime. After seven years of
opposition from the public and Parliament, Peel
finally got his wish with the creation of the London
Metropolitan Police. A preventive rather than reac-
tive force, it replaced the ages-old night watch with
professional, paid, full-time officers. The London
“bobbies,” or peelers (in deference to Robert
Peel), patrolled regular beats, wore uniforms, and
were paramilitary in structure and discipline.
According to the military requirements of the
new force, prospective officers had to be under
35 years of age and at least 5 feet 7 inches tall. Many
former army officers would make the transition from
the battlefield to the streets of London, including
Waterloo veteran Colonel Charles Rowan, who
would serve as the first police commissioner along
with barrister Richard Mayne. Under the direction
of Commissioners Rowan and Mayne, the force was
able to overcome the trepidation of the public about
a strong police force by improving community rela-
tions and reinforcing its image asa civilian police force.
Attired in uniforms designed to look as civilian
as possible, every policeman was expected to begin
service as a constable and work his way through the
ranks for promotion. Headquartered at 4 Whitehall
Place in Westminster, the back door of the new po-
lice quarters faced Scotland Yard. Since this door was
used mostly by constables, the headquarters became
known by the moniker Scotland Yard. The police
were initially regarded with disdain; however, their
suppression of a riot at Cold-Bath Fields in 1833 won
the public over when they were able to do it without
seriously injuring anyone in the crowd despite losing
one of their own to mortal injury. Within the de-
cade, the London Metropolitan Police became the
model for modern policing. Although London had
made the transition, the rest of Great Britain still
lagged far behind in police reform.
New York City
Modern policing in America would begin in the
largest cities. By the end of the American Revolu-
tion, New York City was well on its way to be-
coming the country’s most populated city. Between
1790 and 1820, the city’s population almost qua-
drupled, from 33,000 to 123,000, surprisingly with
little increase in crime. Historian James Richardson
suggested that perhaps this was due to the homoge-
neous nature of its population. In the decades
before tumultuous immigration, life and property
remained well protected. In the early 1820s, one
English
visitor reported
that
regarding
crime,
“New York compared favorably with that of any
English city.”5 However, this was not necessarily a
compliment considering the changing environs of
industrial-age London. New York City was under-
going rapid changes by the 1820s but was still reli-
ant on late-eighteenth-century police strategies.
In 1801, the position of high constable was
created in New York City. Subservient to the
mayor, this position was charged with enforcing
state laws and maintaining public order. Jacob
Hays would carve out an enviable reputation dur-
ing his half-century stint as New York City’s first
high constable. By 1800, New York City was po-
liced by 16 constables serving one-year terms. As
the chief police officer of the city, the mayor also
appointed marshals (40 served in 1800 alone) who
served terms at his discretion. In 1811, the legisla-
ture passed an ordinance limiting the number of
city marshals to 60. Constables and marshals alike
were expected to protect courts, serve process, and
fulfill the accepted duties of police officers, such as

making arrests, maintaining order, and apprehend-
ing criminal suspects.
Born in Bedford Village, New York, in 1771, Jacob Hays
entered law enforcement as a member of New York City’s
“Mayor’s Marshals” in 1798. Three years later he was se-
lected to lead the city’s constables, a position he would
hold for the next 49 years. He earned the monikers “Old
Hays” and “terror of evil-doers” for his reputation for
toughness and exacting discipline. He assumed an almost
mythical reputation in Europe over the years and was sel-
dom seen without his trusty gold-headed baton. Hays was
credited with introducing the police tactic of having offi-
cers patrol in pairs for protection and to guard against
corruption. His other innovations included the “loss book,”
which led to better record keeping by requiring the
recording of all thefts, criminal descriptions, and stolen
goods. He also developed a network of informants. During
the 1840s Hays escorted British novelist Charles Dickens
through the seamy underside of the city. As tribute to his
legendary career, when the NYPD was reorganized in
1844, while Hays’ position as high constable was elimi-
nated, he was permitted to keep his title and was awarded
benefits for life. He was accorded so much respect during
his long life that parents warned their misbehaving chil-
dren, “be good, or Old Hays will get you!” He died in 1850.
One of his descendents, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, went on
to become the publisher of the New York Times.
Early New York City marshals and constables
did not wear uniforms or carry identification of
their position. Instead of a salary, they depended
on fees for services rendered. In 1827, night watch-
men, known as “leatherheads” for their leather hats,
were carrying 33-inch clubs to dispatch the more
violent elements of New York society. A figure of
derision, watchmen were notorious for sleeping on
duty, or “cooping.” Widely regarded as incompe-
tent if not corrupt, most night watchmen held day
jobs, ranging from masons to cartmen. Until the
1840s, New York City policing remained funda-
mentally an amateur business of volunteer or poorly
paid watchmen and constables. Marshals and other
functionaries complemented the law enforcement
apparatus, but the only true professionals in criminal
justice remained the criminals themselves.
With the phenomenal growth of the city in the
1840s, the old system of constables and night
watchmen was soon overwhelmed by the problems
accompanying the new economic and social order.
Mass immigration in the 1830s and 1840s contrib-
uted to the growing juxtaposition between the
well-to-do and the poor. As the nation’s population
exploded and settlers moved west thanks to im-
provements in transportation, new markets for
manufactured goods were opened.
Business entrepreneurs soon enlarged labor
forces and introduced a division of labor to mass-
produce goods. But while the manufacturers reaped
a profit, many laborers found their status and job
security on the decline. Recent immigrants were of-
ten targeted as the scapegoat for the changing envi-
ronment. Much of the urban violence was directed
at recent Irish-Catholic immigrants. Mobs attacked
Irish communities in many northeastern cities from
Philadelphia to Charlestown, Massachusetts. In fact,
this mayhem was so prevalent that the nascent insur-
ance companies would refuse to issue the Irish poli-
cies. Rioting and an increasing crime and vice
problem led, by 1844, to growing sentiment for a
police force in New York City based on the London
model.
Southern Policing
In the antebellum years, white southerners struggled
with the problem of runaway slaves and potential
slave insurrections. Most southern states established
surveillance systems to curb slave mobility. Accord-
ing to one scholar, whites “exploited slave folk be-
liefs, planting rumors so that blacks would assume
the ‘paterollers’ (patrols) possessed more power than
they actually did.”6 Night riding and terror became a
legitimate means for southerners to maintain their
domination of slave society.
Recent research suggests that some of the earliest
law enforcement reforms occurred in the South.7
Charleston, South Carolina, could boast a paramili-
tary municipal police force by the beginning of the
1780s that grew to a guard of 100 men by 1822. To
one visitor in 1842, Charleston had “the best orga-
nized system of police that has ever been devised.”8
Some scholars reject the notion that the early south-
ern city guards constituted actual police forces,
comparing them more to their slave patrol prede-
cessors. While it is true that they walked a beat,

wore uniforms, and carried weapons, the forces op-
erated more as military slave patrols with little regard
for republican society or values. Initially established
to control the large slave population, similar forces
soon followed in Savannah, New Orleans, and Mo-
bile. Unlike the nonuniformed constables and night
watchmen of the northern cities, the city guards of
the southern cities, similar to the militia, wore uni-
forms and carried muskets or swords. Regarded as
city employees decades before the northern cities
had uniformed forces, the city guards were usually
on duty at night, while a reserve force was available
for daytime emergencies. In addition, they were sal-
aried rather than dependent on fees.
One of the most notable police experiments of
the early Republic took place in New Orleans when
a city guard emerged in 1809. The ethnic diversity of
New Orleans that gave birth to the guard also had
sown the seeds of its demise by the 1830s. Wearing
uniforms and carrying pikes and sabers, most of the
members were French speakers, and by the end of the
War of 1812, few could speak English. The influx of
German and Irish immigrants in the 1820s and 1830s,
ever wary of armed military-style policing, would
lead to friction with the native French-speaking pop-
ulation, and the guard dissolved in 1836.
The Texas Rangers and the Mounted
Police Tradition
While it is unknown when horses were first used in a
police action, most historians can trace the utilization
of mounted forces in peacekeeping operations to
King Charles’s Articles of War (1629). By 1758, the
London Bow Street Runners were established as
the mounted branch of the London Metropolitan
Police. In the early 1800s, the Bow Street Horse
Patrol was charged with patrolling the main roads
leading into London. Like later personifications of
the mounted police, officers came from the military,
typically the cavalry. Mounted police forces in the
British tradition appeared throughout the British
Empire over the next 150 years.
In the United States, the Texas Rangers exem-
plified the ranging tradition and are credited as
America’s first statewide law enforcement agency.
Created by Stephen Austin in 1823, they did not
appear in official legislation as the “Texas Rangers”
until 1874. The first incarnation of state policing in
American history, during the nineteenth century the
Rangers would have an off-and-on existence. A for-
mally organized force of Texas Rangers did not
appear until the outbreak of the Texas Revolution
in 1835, when they were formed as an auxiliary mili-
tary body. With the main goal of eliminating the
bandit and Indian threat, the Rangers originally con-
sisted of 10 volunteers whose duties were to “range”
over the seemingly endless Texas landscape. It was
from this “ranging” activity that the Rangers derived
their name. With wages of 15 dollars a month, pay-
able in land, these men were in a constant state of
preparedness. During the 50 years between the crea-
tion of Stephen Austin’s colony in Texas and the
establishment of a permanent force, the functions
of the Texas Rangers continued to evolve.
CORRECTIONS
In the aftermath of the American Revolution, the
former colonies attempted to come to terms with
rising crime rates. Philadelphia had initially imple-
mented hard labor as a substitute for more draconian
punishments. However, it was less than a rousing
success. The sight of prisoners with shaved heads
and in primitive garments working on public roads
proved more exhibitory spectacle than reformative
in nature. After Thomas Jefferson inaugurated a
plan for hard labor in lieu of punishment in Virginia,
he learned of the Walnut Street Jail experiment
in Philadelphia and backtracked. Capitalizing on
Jefferson’s notions combining work and punishment
in 1796, Virginia authorized the construction of a
penitentiary in Richmond. Opening in 1800, archi-
tect Benjamin Henry Latrobe’s vision so impressed
Jefferson that he selected him to design the U.S.
Capitol building and to oversee its construction.
During its short history, Walnut Street Jail was
the setting for numerous correctional innovations.
In 1791, better conditions for debtors were imple-
mented, and by the following year, prison keepers
were subsisting on a salary rather than collecting

fees from prisoners. By the end of the decade,
Pennsylvania witnessed the abolition of the death
penalty for all crimes except premeditated murder
as well as the complete revision of its penal code.
Officials soon became cognizant of one of the
inherent contradictions of a prison that housed
inmates in any congregate setting: This created an
environment akin to a “school for crime.” In mak-
ing the transition from a county jail to a state penal
establishment, Walnut Street Jail was soon faced
with problems of overcrowding and inadequate
financing, which in turn led to riots, mass escapes,
and assaults on guards.
Despite an untimely retreat from the initial at-
tempt providing separate confinement, Quaker-
inspired organizations such as the Pennsylvania
Prison Society and the Philadelphia Society for Al-
leviating the Miseries of Public Prisons embarked
on a new attempt at a separate system. Two new
prisons were built in Pennsylvania following this
concept. Pittsburgh’s Western Penitentiary, built
according to Jeremy Bentham’s panopticon, was
completed in 1818 but was slightly regarded. How-
ever, the Cherry Hill Prison, completed in 1829
and better known as Eastern State Penitentiary,
would become the showplace for prison reform in
America.
According to the noted French traveler Alexis
de Tocqueville, by the 1830s Philadelphia was still
“infatuated with the prison system.” This would be
an oversimplification. The Quaker reform impulse
was indeed still strong in Philadelphia by the 1830s
as civic idealism merged with new architectural
professionalism. New penal, medical, and philan-
thropic institutions dotted the city’s landscape.
Large in scale and progressive for their time, the
Orphan Asylum, the House of Refuge, the Alms
House, and Moyamensing Prison would all pale in
comparison to Eastern State Penitentiary, America’s
largest building in 1829.
While Great Britain could point to the Peni-
tentiary Houses Act in 1799 as a universal attempt
to reform the English prison system, no such um-
brella of legislation came to fruition in America.
The republican system of government remained a
formidable obstacle to any comprehensive prison
legislation and would leave it to the various states
to confront the problems of the American prison
system.
One goal shared by the state prison building
movement in the 1820s and 1830s was to make
the new institutions self-sufficient. State legislators
demanded that penitentiaries pay their own way,
although they would be consistently at loggerheads
with private businesses that worried that prison in-
dustries would flourish because of unfair business
competition. The most outstanding feature of the
separate system worked against the profitability it
sought since the rigid segregation of prisoners
worked against the viability of prison industries.
Legislators looked for a compromise in Virginia by
refraining from keeping prisoners continuously in
stir as in the Pennsylvania model, allowing them to
work for a time in congregate conditions while
spending a good part of the day in unemployed soli-
tude. However, when they did have the chance to
work, borrowing a page from the Auburn model,
they worked in silence in prison shops.
In 1826, the First Report of the Prison Discipline
Society of Boston, organized under the zealous lead-
ership of the Reverend Louis Dwight, was published.
According to this work, there were approximately
3,500 prisoners in state penitentiaries, with 60%
of them housed in New York, Pennsylvania, and
Massachusetts. Although prison stripes were intro-
duced in New York in 1815, prison uniforms would
vary from state to state. Since different colors were
used for first-time offenders and recidivists, the pur-
pose of the different-colored stripes was to reveal at
a glance the prisoner’s classification in the case of
an escape. The states were never consistent in the
training and equipping of jail keepers. For example,
prison guards in New York were initially unarmed,
while early Massachusetts keepers were provided
a gun and bayonet.
Having originally trained for the ministry, Louis Dwight
was kept from fulfilling his ambition after a chemical
laboratory accident injured his lungs so that he could
not preach. By 1824, he was traversing Massachusetts
dispensing Bibles to prisoners. After discovering the
abuses of the new penal institutions, he devoted his life
to improving prison conditions. In 1825, he organized

the Prison Discipline Society of Boston, an organization
he would lead until his death in 1854. A champion of
the Auburn system, Dwight led the opposition against
the Pennsylvania model.
The Auburn System
At the dawn of the nineteenth century, New York
State was grappling with its own penal obstacles.
New York advocates led by Thomas Eddy (1758–
1827), a Quaker and former Loyalist during the
American Revolution, visited the Walnut Street
Jail in Philadelphia in 1796 and returned to New
York with plans to build what became Newgate
Prison in 1797. Implementing many of the ideals
of what would become known as the Pennsylvania
system, Eddy earned a philanthropic reputation that
led to his sobriquet “the John Howard of America.”
An advocate for humanitarian disciplinary methods,
Eddy has been credited as the first American to call
for separate cells for all prisoners as he helped design
Newgate and lay the foundations for what became
known as the Auburn model. Eddy went on to
become the leading advocate of humane disciplin-
ary methods. Among his (temporary) accomplish-
ments was the prohibition of corporal punishment
and providing food and clothing to prisoners at no
cost. The jail also eschewed solitary confinement in
favor of congregate housing.
During its first five years, Newgate earned an
enviable record for subsistence, with prison industries
paying nearly all the prison’s expenses. Eddy was
credited with establishing a prison hospital and phar-
macy and hiring the first full-time prison physician. A
firm believer in rehabilitation, Newgate emphasized
schooling and strict religious instruction for inmates
while prohibiting corporal punishment. A propo-
nent of individualized punishment, prisoners were
classified into four categories that included juveniles
under the age of 18, men and women, those capable
of improvement, and hardened offenders.9 But de-
spite showing a small profit and eliminating corporal
punishment in 1803, the following year Eddy re-
signed as conditions in the prison deteriorated.
Eddy left Newgate to dedicate himself to building a
better prison that would soon take shape at Auburn.
With the support of the New York state legisla-
ture, Auburn was selected as the site for a new prison
facility, and in 1816 construction began under the
direction of architect-builder John Cray. Patterned
after other early American prisons with a sprinkling
of solitary cells and larger night rooms, in 1823 a new
plan was adopted in which all prisoners would be
locked in separate cells at night but ate and worked
in a congregate environment in absolute silence un-
der threat of corporal punishment.
Unlike its Pennsylvania progenitor, which re-
lied on solitary confinement, Auburn Prison would
take off in another direction. Construction would
hinge on providing double cells and apartments to
house inmates and congregate rooms for inmates to
work together during the day. In 1819, the solitary
arrangements of Philadelphia influenced New York
officials to construct an additional wing of the prison
that provided single cells for the more uncontrollable
prisoners. In 1821, a new cell block was erected,
composed of two rows of cells built on five floors.
Placed back to back, the cells were much smaller than
those in Pennsylvania, measuring 3.5 feet wide, 7 feet
long, and 7 feet high. However, the inauguration of
solitary confinement at Auburn proved disastrous. In
solitary confinement and faced with the restriction of
absolute silence, five of the original 83 inmates died
the first year.
Later in 1821, Captain Elam Lynds took over
control of the prison and was credited with estab-
lishing the Auburn silent system. Under the new
scheme, men were allowed to work in strictly su-
pervised congregate shops during the day but were
locked in individual cells at night. The Auburn de-
sign of prison, with five-tiered cell blocks contain-
ing narrow single cells for nighttime separation,
would become the most influential American
prison design in the early nineteenth century. The
strict code of silence was maintained under threat of
flogging in an attempt to thwart the contamination
of criminal behavior and put an end to the “schools
for crime.”
Lynds has been given credit as “inventor of the
Auburn system.” However, this distinction was
tarnished by his darker side, which led many critics
to brand him a borderline sadist. Following service

in the local militia and the federal infantry, Lynds
was selected principal keeper of Auburn Prison,
where he rapidly gained a reputation for military
discipline. He enforced lockstep marching and rigid
silence with the zeal of a martinet. Any motion at
the dining table that violated the prescribed proto-
col would elicit harsh punishment that could
include solitary confinement in the “hole” or a whip-
ping. An advocate of whipping, when Lynds was
questioned by the Frenchmen Gustave de Beaumont
and Alexis de Tocqueville in the 1830s as to whether
he believed “that bodily chastisement might be dis-
pensed with,” Lynds responded, “I am convinced of
the contrary. I consider the chastisement by the
whip, the most efficient, and, at the same time, the
humane which exists; it never injures health, and ob-
liges the prisoners to lead a life essentially healthy.…
I consider it impossible to govern a large prison with-
out a whip.”10 With his penchant for corporal pun-
ishment, Lynds maintained order in Auburn until
1825, when he was authorized to take 100 inmates
to the Hudson River town of Ossining to build what
would become known as Sing Sing Prison. On his
return to Auburn, his methods were finally brought
into question, and in 1838 he was fired for his cruelty.
Ever the disciplinarian, his acumen would soon be
required at Sing Sing. The Auburn system would
flourish in the first half of the nineteenth century
with 30 state prisons following this pattern, including
the infamous Sing Sing Prison.
Eastern State Penitentiary
In 1829, Pennsylvania responded to the Auburn
model with the opening of Eastern State Peniten-
tiary, admitting its first prisoner on October 25.
Often referred to simply as “Cherry Hill” because
it was built on the site of a cherry orchard, it was
the largest building project in America up to that
time. Prisoners were housed in extra-large cells,
each with a walled garden-exercise yard, and were
expected to live and work in the cell without contact
with any other prisoners. Having replaced the
Walnut Jail, which was not permanently closed until
1835, the new facility was considered the nation’s
greatest testament to the penitentiary concept.
Architecturally, Eastern State Penitentiary re-
sembled a medieval castle with towering 30-foot
walls surrounding seven cell blocks that branched
out from a central rotunda like the spokes of a
wheel. Long corridors extended through each cell
block and contained at least 30 solitary cells. Here
prisoners often spent years ensconced in solitary
confinement. The most expensive prison of its
kind, each cell had a private exercise yard, running
water, and heat. With little provided for reading
besides the Bible, it was hoped that prisoners would
seek solace in the holy book and spend their lonely
hours reflecting on their misspent lives. Despite the
noble goals of the system’s creators, many convicts
became insane from the monotony of solitary con-
finement. After a visit to the prison in 1842, the
novelist Charles Dickens lamented that “the system
here is rigid, strict, and hopeless solitary confine-
ment. I believe it, in its effects, to be cruel and
wrong” and that the “slow and daily tampering
with the mysteries of the brain” was “immeasurably
worse than any torture to the body.”11
CRIM E AND PUNI SHM ENT
The formation of the federal criminal justice system
in the 1790s not only created courts but also autho-
rized punishments such as imprisonment, corporal
penalties, and, in capital cases, execution. However,
while English law still recognized 240 capital of-
fenses in 1780 (although 94% were commuted to
transportation),12 the penal codes of the American
states were far less punitive. Capital punishment was
rarely meted out to whites for crimes other than mur-
der. During the late eighteenth century, traditional
punishments were clearly ineffective. With popula-
tion growth, increasing mobility, and migration, the
emergence of a distinct poor population made sanc-
tions such as fines, whippings, and the pillory less
effective than in the past.
While capital punishment had diminished, cor-
poral punishment was another matter, with many
criminal offenses still being punished with the pub-
lic infliction of pain and suffering. Most towns
in New England boasted whipping posts and stocks

near the commons or meetinghouse. As late as 1805,
the penalty in Massachusetts for counterfeiting was
the amputation of an ear after sitting in a pillory for an
hour. The penalty for manslaughter consisted of hav-
ing one’s forehead branded in public, and many
communities flogged perpetrators of petty theft.
But by the 1830s, public corporal punishment began
to disappear from statute books as prison became a
more accepted sanction for most crimes. In 1790,
Pennsylvania prohibited flogging, and in 1805,
Massachusetts followed suit. The movement to
abolish corporal punishment was haphazard at best,
with Connecticut constables continuing to whip
petty criminals until 1828 and Delaware officials
flogging black and white prisoners well into the
twentieth century.
Capital Punishment
Following the American Revolution and the En-
lightenment, the movement to abolish the death
penalty was inextricably linked with the developing
penitentiary movement. But despite an emphasis on
milder punishments, executions still occurred in the
first part of the nineteenth century. With a rise in
public disorder in the 1820s and 1830s, some states
began to steer away from the inflammatory specta-
cle of public executions. Pennsylvania once again
led the way in criminal justice reform as the first
state to hold private executions behind prison walls
beginning in 1834. During the 1830s, New York
and Massachusetts would join Pennsylvania in end-
ing public executions as sheriffs made the transition
to carrying out death sentences behind prison walls.
Following the American Revolution, a new,
more humanitarian age was ushered in by the pro-
tections granted by the Bill of Rights, which elimi-
nated “cruel and unusual punishments.” Hanging
would predominate as the only sanctioned form
of capital punishment in America for the next
100 years. Although Benjamin Rush and others
were in favor of the abolition of the death penalty,
they were clearly in the minority, but in sharp con-
trast with England’s “bloody code,” the few capital
offenses in America consisted of murder, treason,
arson, and rape. The rate of executions clearly fell
after the colonial era, from a high of almost 35 per
100,000 to only three or four per 100,000 in the
post-revolutionary years.13 As the 1820s got under-
way, northern states abolished outdated traditions
such as “benefit of clergy” as penitentiaries and re-
formatories became accepted alternatives to more
punitive methods of punishment.
Until executions were hidden from the public
behind prison walls, spectators would drive many
miles to witness public hangings. Entertainers, ven-
dors, and peddlers lent an air of festivity—a carnival
atmosphere to what should have been a somber
event. Although the gallows was the typical mode
of hanging east of the Mississippi River, there are
accounts during the years before the Civil War of
prisoners walking up a ladder to a noose on a tree
limb and then having the ladder withdrawn. The
new industrial age would lead to the development
of hanging machines that were considered more
humanitarian.
Juvenile Delinquency
As America grew more urban during the early
nineteenth century, a new class of servants, orphans,
and indigents for whom no one felt responsibility
began to dot the municipal landscape. As early as
1766, one of New York City’s leading citizens was
lamenting that “children nightly trampouze the
streets with lanthorns upon poles and halloing …
the magistry either approve of it, or do not dare
suppress it.”14 More an irritant than a public crime
hazard, youth gangs would gradually evolve into an
urban menace by the early 1800s.
By the 1790s, the rise in wage labor and the
increasing prosperity of slavery led master artisans
to move away from the old system requiring ap-
prentices. With few outlets for subsistence, once
young boys left their homes, they often found
themselves on the streets, stealing food and sleep-
ing in alleys. In earlier days, the moral arbiters of
the village would council the youths, but with soci-
ety becoming increasingly complex, city fathers
were powerless to police every street corner, with
more pressing matters of public health and order
taking precedence.

Groups of young homeless boys were soon
congregating on the fringes of crowded cities where
they could survive by robbing travelers or doing
odd jobs. By the early 1820s, the Five Points district
(derived from the intersection of five streets) of
New York was a breeding ground for every kind
of criminal element. It is generally conceded that
some of America’s earliest organized criminal gangs
were born out of this locale, where thieves, cut-
throats, and pickpockets found refuge from a soci-
ety intent on bringing order to the chaos that was
urban America. Chief among the first Five Points
gangs were the Forty Thieves, whose organization
can be traced back to 1826.
Alcoholic Republic
Virtually every American community had a village
church and local tavern in the late eighteenth cen-
tury. Diametrically opposed to one another in
spirit, the tavern was the most accessible local insti-
tution for the male world of the early nineteenth
century. Even the former Puritan communities of
New England could boast more licensed taverns
than meetinghouses. Like their British counterparts
in the medieval world, the taverns were scenes of
gambling, heavy smoking, hard drinking, and even
harder fighting. The winter months proved a boon
to local tavern keepers with little competition for
the entertainment dollars of men in the fallow
months of an agriculture-based society.
Further supporting the widespread acceptance of
public drinking in early America, during one of George
Washington’s campaigns for a seat in the Virginia House
of Burgesses, he doled out 28 gallons of rum, 50 gallons
of rum punch, 36 gallons of wine, 46 gallons of beer,
and other libations. It should be no surprise then that
he won the election.
When not preoccupied by drinking, the men of
the early Republic could find solace in gambling and
games of chance such as dice and cards. Gambling
united the classes as few other endeavors did. When
weather permitted, they wagered on horse racing,
cockfights, and wrestling matches. Mostly indifferent
to the suffering of animals, the blood sports of
dogfighting, bull and bear baiting, and cock matches
were especially popular in both the North and the
South.
Regardless of the social activity, alcoholic bev-
erages were never far away, being as common as tra-
ditional victuals. The problem was not the act of
drinking but the enormous quantity consumed.
One estimate suggests that during the revolutionary
era, each person consumed the equivalent of 3.5 gal-
lons of pure, 200-proof alcohol. By the end of the
1790s, perhaps because of anxieties generated by
rapid social and economic change, men were drink-
ing even more, with consumption rising to an all-
time high of 4 gallons per capita by the late 1820s.
Over the next 20 years, liquor consumption be-
gan to decline in some regions of the country. A
product of temperance crusades by mostly New
England clergymen, the campaign against drinking
found a voice in the creation of the American Tem-
perance Society in 1826. A highly charged crusade
against “demon rum” and its accompanying social
disorder was supplemented by pamphlets from med-
ical doctors such as Benjamin Rush advising Amer-
icans of the potentially poisonous effects of alcohol.
By 1840, alcohol consumption had declined from
4 gallons per person each year to less than 1.5 gallons.
And in less than a century, temperance societies
would become victorious with the passage of the
Volstead Act in 1920.
AM ER ICAN VI OLENC E
As America became more diverse as it moved from its
colonial roots, so too did the relationships of its myriad
citizens become more complex, often degenerating
into violence. The early Republic years saw casual
violence become part of the daily fabric of American
life. Recreational bare-knuckle boxing and wrestling
offered more acceptable outlets for male violence. For
slaves, violence was part and parcel of the peculiar
institution. Violence was rarely absent from any aspect
of the social arena. Harsh corporal punishment was
common within the family and at school. Servants,
slaves, students, and children were often the target of
brutal corporal and public punishments.

During the American Revolution, the southern
colonies witnessed not only traditional warfare but
also what has been called an “uncivil war” where
vigilantes, Tories, and bands of bandits waged war
against each other and the civilian populace. Follow-
ing the war, the southern region’s association with
violence became more pronounced. During the early
Republic, while northern states outlawed dueling and
abandoned the institution of slavery, white souther-
ners continued to glorify the virtues of honor, vio-
lence, and masculinity. The persistence of southern
slavery guaranteed that violence would continue to
be identified with southern culture. Flogging and
branding and the threat of violence were emphasized
for maintaining social control at a time when northern
cities experimented with policing and prisons.
The Slave Revolts
During the 1790s, the legal status of slavery became
increasingly complicated. In 1791, the former Haitian
slave Pierre-Dominique Toussaint Louverture led the
first large-scale slave uprising in the Americas. His
forces defeated troopsfrom Spain and Britain as well as
mulatto-French forces. American slaveholders rest-
lessly followed the subsequent events in Haiti with
great interest, fearing similar uprisings in the South.
Increasingly paranoid, the southern slavocracy closed
ranks and suppressed even the slightest hint of insur-
rection. According to historian Scott Christianson,
“Reported American slave revolts during the 1790s
grew by 150 percent over the previous decade.”15
In 1800, Virginia planters had reason to fear insur-
rection when Gabriel Prosser (owned by Thomas
Prosser) was accused of conspiring with insurgent
slaves to attack Richmond, seize the arsenal, and kill
white residents. Despite the 28-year-old Gabriel’scon-
tention that he was motivated by the ideals contained
in the Declaration of Independence, 30 of the accused
conspirators were executed before they could put any
plot into action. According to most sources, the plan
came close to succeeding if not for an informer.
In 2007 Virginia Governor Timothy M. Kaine gave Gabriel
Prosser an informal pardon after he was hanged for
leading a failed slave revolt in 1800. A formal pardon was
not issued since these are typically reserved for the living.
In the gubernatorial pardon Kaine noted that Prosser was
driven by “his devotion to the ideals of the American
Revolution—it was worth risking death to secure liberty.”
With the slave states still dependent on slave
patrols, militia, and informal methods of law enforce-
ment, Prosser’s rebellion led to the organization of a
public guard in Virginia. Wary of future uprisings,
General Assembly of Virginia authorized the creation
of a “paid militia with its barracks in Richmond.” For
the next six decades, the Public Guard would patrol
Richmond’s penitentiary, armory, Capitol Square,
and other important public places. Keepers for the
new Richmond penitentiary would be selected
from the ranks of the Guard as well.
Eleven years later, the largest slave insurrection in
American history flared up in two isolated Louisiana
parishes, but federal troops were able to suppress it
before it could spread any farther. Among the more
notorious near conspiracies was the Denmark Vesey
plot in Charleston, South Carolina, led by a free black
who reportedly was intent on ridding the state of
its draconian slave system. Despite South Carolina’s
black majority, Vesey and his coconspirators were
executed. In retaliation for the near calamity, South
Carolina’s planters introduced even harsher laws pro-
hibiting contact between freed blacks and slaves.
It was not until the 1831 Nat Turner revolt that
a slave insurrection was allowed to come to fruition.
By the end of the Virginia rebellion, Turner and his
followers killed more than 60 whites. Virginia au-
thorities took six weeks to suppress the rebellion
and bring Turner and his followers to “justice.”
This event marked a turning point in the history of
slavery in the South. Prior slave rebellions had
existed in plot only. The outbreak of the Turner
rebellion led southern authorities to become more
aggressive in their defense of slavery and in their
control of the slave population. Following the rebel-
lions, southerners turned increasingly to slave patrols
and local militia to control the slave population.

between the indigenous peoples and Europeans
because of various alliances with the French and
English. Prior to the war, the British attempted
to block the settlement of the west by American
colonists while granting Indians protection of their
hunting lands. But having made the irrevocable de-
cision to side with the British late in the war, the
Indians lost their protectors as the colonists rapidly
invaded the Indian sanctuaries. Within several gen-
erations, military campaigns and Indian removal
would reduce the Indian population east of the Mis-
sissippi River to a fraction of its prewar population.
Former Patriots saw nothing wrong with retali-
ating against the Indian cultures. While not all sided
with the British, for the most part the Americans
branded all cultures as traitorous. Among the more
lamentable examples of using broad brushstrokes to
paint the diverse Indian cultures was the scandalous
treatment accorded the Stockbridge Indians of
Massachusetts who had so valiantly aided the Patriots
but were forced from their homelands to New York.
Dueling
Prior to the American Revolution, dueling had not
yet made its mark on the American consciousness.
While southern gentlemen might resort to wrestling
or their fists to settle matters of honor, dueling was
rare before the conflict, when French and British
officers introduced the tradition to American officers
who helped assimilate the practice into civilian cul-
ture. Never popular in the northern states, it soon
became a fixture in the southern subculture of vio-
lence. After Aaron Burr killed his political adversary
Alexander Hamilton in a duel in 1804, dueling was
prohibited in the North but would flourish in the
South among those who valued competitive self-
assertion and skill with weapons as a means of main-
taining personal honor. Southern towns such as
New Orleans and St. Louis maintained secluded
dueling grounds on the outskirts of the city as
legislatures and courts turned a blind eye toward
the practice. Duels were conducted under a strict
protocol that found expression in books such
as John L. Wilson’s The Code of Honor (1838). While
movements
against
dueling
were
sporadically
organized in the South, once and future politicians,
such as Andrew Jackson, Judah P. Benjamin,
Thomas Hart Benton, and Sam Houston, would
endear themselves to their constituents because of
their participation in violent encounters at some
time in their adult lives. Historian Bertram Wyatt-
Brown suggested that besides confirming the wor-
thiness of the upperclasses, dueling also “enabled lesser
men” to advance into the higher echelons of society.16
NOTABLE TRIALS
Aaron Burr Treason Trial (1807)
On March 30, 1807, former vice president of the
United StatesAaron Burrwasdelivered to Richmond,
Virginia, to stand trial for treason. In almost every civ-
ilization, treason has been viewed as the most serious
secular crime, and a capital crime at that. The charges
leveled at Burr included plotting to divide the Union
and attempting to make himself emperor of a new
nation that would encompass Mexico and most of
the American territories west of the Allegheny Moun-
tains. The Burr case is one of the most famous treason
trials in American history, and the adjudication of the
case would play a part in the larger drama of a young
nation attempting to define itself.
No stranger to controversy, Burr today is proba-
bly bestrememberedforhisdeadlyduelwithAlexander
Hamilton in 1804 that would not only deprive
America of a great statesman and sully the reputa-
tion of another but also make dueling illegal in the
northern states. Treason was the one crime defined
by the U.S. Constitution. According to article III, sec-
tion 3, “Treason against the United States shall consist
only in levying War against them, or in adhering to
their enemies, Giving them Aid and Comfort. No
Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the
Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act,
or on Confession in open Court.” The charge of trea-
son has long been used as a tool of destruction against
political opposition, and the Constitution defined the
limits of legal opposition to the federal government.
During the trial, Burr did not deny committing
many of the acts he was accused of committing, but
114

he denied that they were treasonable offenses. Fol-
lowing his indictment on murder charges for killing
Hamilton in the duel in 1804, Burr’s political career
had effectively ended. But his controversial life had
one more chapter yet to come. In the spring of 1805,
Burr reportedly concocted a scheme with James
Wilkinson, the military governor of Louisiana, the
actual nature of which is still unclear. According to
some accounts, Burr told the British minister that he
would separate the states and territories west of the
Appalachians from the Union and create an empire
with himself as leader if the British would offer
$500,000 and naval support.
As Burr and his 60 coconspirators traversed the
Ohio River destined for New Orleans, his accom-
plice Wilkinson betrayed Burr to President Thomas
Jefferson. Burr was captured and tried for treason
with Chief Justice John Marshall presiding. Using
the Constitution’s definition of treason, it would
take two witnesses to convict an individual on that
charge. Unable to meet this standard, Burr was ex-
onerated. There are still lingering questions concern-
ing Burr’s guilt or innocence, but to his dying day,
Burr denied the charges. Despite having the charges
against him dismissed by two grand juries, he never
regained the respect of his fellow Americans and was
unable to escape the label of traitor.
The trial of Aaron Burr is the most often cited
source for understanding basic federal criminal pro-
cedure prior to the 1840s. For most of America’s
history, circuit courts created by the Judiciary Act
of 1789 were the primary trial courts in the federal
judicial system. These courts had jurisdiction over
federal criminal offenses and disputes between citi-
zens from different states that involved $500 or more.
For most of the nineteenth century, except for affi-
davits certifying the opinion between the two judges
holding the circuit court, there was no judicial re-
view. As a result, court opinions, decisions, and espe-
cially transcripts are rare for this period.
CONCLUSIONS
There was little discussion of a crime problem before
the American Revolution. However, independence
from Great Britain would lead to a dramatic trans-
formation of the country and the dawning of a
crime problem that would haunt American culture
for more than two centuries. By the early 1800s,
various communities and cities could identify par-
ticular areas considered unsafe to the public at large.
New York City, Boston, Baltimore, and Philadel-
phia became hotbeds for sectarian strife. The more
rural parts of America were not left untouched by
the growing crime problem. During the late eigh-
teenth and early nineteenth centuries, the Natchez
Trace between Nashville and Natchez was one of
the most dangerous regions in the country. Among
the most prolific killers of this era were brothers
Micajah and Wiley Harpe, who were estimated to
have killed dozens of innocent victims, making
them probably the earliest recorded serial killers in
American history.
During the first four decades of the American
Republic, the country had grown to a manufactur-
ing power as cities teemed with new immigrants.
Peace officers in the 1820s were concerned more
with issues of public health and municipal regula-
tions than enforcing criminal laws or preventing
crimes. American cities began a transformation
that would not be completed until the 1840s and
1850s. Although larger cities, such as New York
and Boston, contended with increasing crime and
riots, only limited steps were taken toward adopting
the 1829 London Metropolitan model of policing.
Recent historians have concluded that “in neither
Boston, New York nor any other American city
was the establishment of uniformed preventive
police as rapid and as dramatic as in London in
1829.”17
Meanwhile, states struggled with the adoption
of various prison designs, mainly having to decide
whether to keep prisoners confined in a “solitary”
environment or a “silent” one. It was hoped the
solitary system, inaugurated in Philadelphia, would
give prisoners time to reflect on their crimes and
become better citizens. Advocates of the silent sys-
tem saw the Pennsylvania solitary system as inhu-
mane and allowed prisoners to work with others in
a congregate setting, albeit in a rigidly enforced si-
lence. The silent system ultimately triumphed. But

the main reason for the success of the Auburn
model over the Pennsylvania one was the economic
difference, since most states would adopt the plan
that saw the greatest profit. Slave states, meanwhile,
had little need for large penitentiaries, reliant as they
were on the punishments that accompanied slavery.
Between 1790 and 1817, Georgia, Kentucky,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New
Jersey,
New
York,
Ohio,
Pennsylvania,
and
Vermont all constructed their first penitentiaries.
The reform impulse remained strong in America
between 1790 and 1830.
Point–Counterpoint
Creating the Penitentiary (1835)
During their tours of America in the 1830s, European
visitors rarely failed to be impressed by the nation’s new
penitentiary buildings at Eastern State Penitentiary and
Auburn Prison. The differences between these two systems
were glaring. The Pennsylvania system, exemplified at
Eastern State, was a solitary system that often led prisoners to
go insane and sometimes attempt suicide. No less foreboding,
the silent Auburn system, with its reliance on military dis-
cipline, became the more popular of the two systems, keeping
discipline with the threat of a flogging for the slightest
infraction.
The following passages are taken from William
Crawford’s 1835 report on American prisons. In 1831
Crawford (1788–1847), a London wine seller and philan-
thropist, was selected by the British Home Office to embark
on an investigation of American prisons and to determine
which system was most superior (he selected the Pennsylvania
regimen). He would eventually visit 14 state penitentiaries
and a number of local jails. The twin evils of solitary con-
finement and its accompanying mental health problems are
chronicled in the passage on Eastern, while the issue of
flogging is addressed in the Auburn selection.
The tendency of the system to produce mental
disease is a subject of such vast importance that I felt it
my duty to make every enquiry into the cases of the
individuals who had been thus afflicted, in order to
ascertain if their lamentable condition could in any
degree be ascribed to the peculiar nature of their
imprisonment. The information on this point con-
tained in the following letter, addressed to me by the
warden of the penitentiary, is so very satisfactory,
and was so fully corroborated by other enquiries
which I instituted, that no doubt whatever remains
on my mind that the parties in question had suffered
mental derangement before their committal to this
penitentiary. It is proper to observe, that there is no
state lunatic asylum in Pennsylvania, and that offen-
ders who are afflicted with disorders of the mind,
and who are considered too dangerous to be at
large, are consequently sent to the penitentiary for
security.
“Philadelphia, first month 20th, 1834.” In ref-
erence to the subject mentioned yesterday, of the
cause of the insanity of four and the idiotcy of one
of our prisoners, I must refer to the several reports
made annually to the Legislature. In addition to
what is contained in them I may add that No. 10
appeared very strange on his admission, and told the
inspectors, physician, and myself, remarkable tales
of his being concerned in killing men, women,
and children, in Charleston (South Carolina), who
were salted up and sold for pork, and of being con-
cerned with gangs of counterfeiters; that General
Jackson was the prime mover of all this, and such
a mass of nonsense that we all came to one conclu-
sion that he was either insane, or wished us to think
he was so. A two years’ residence here induced us
to believe that the former was the case. He was
sometimes more excited than at others, but went
away apparently in very much the same state of
mind to that in which he came in. As he talked
in the same manner on the day of his admission as
on that of his discharge, no one for a moment be-
lieved that separate confinement had been the cause
of his insanity, if he was insane. We knew nothing of
him before his reception, and have never heard of
him since he left the doors of the penitentiary.”
“There was something odd and singular in
No. 48 when he arrived here, but this was attributed

more to a want of education and an unbroken irrita-
ble temper than to insanity. We were told that he
had ascended a chimney in the county prison at
Lancaster (where he was convicted), and that he
remained there three days without food, until it
was supposed that he had made his escape. This feat
was considered as an attempt to escape, and not
attributed
to
insanity. He
was received here
Nov. 29th, 1830. On the 7th of Dec. he was set to
work as a cabinet maker, at which trade he said he
had served two years. We found, however, that
he knew but little. On the 11th he refused to do
any work, and said that he had been ordered other-
wise by a higher authority than any one here.
During this night the watchman found him at
prayers. About eight o’clock on the morning of the
12th my attention was called to him. He was sitting
with his lamp burning and a bible before him.
I directed him to put out the light: this he would
not do. Thomas Bradford and S. W. Crawford
saw him this day, and believed him to be under the
influence of religious excitement. On the contrary
I thought that he was feigning insanity. He became
better, but again worse, and continued so until dis-
charged by pardon.
In the workshops the convicts are arranged in
such a way as not to face each other, and to labour
separately as much as possible. In each shop prisoners
are selected as attendants, whose business it is to dis-
tribute the materials, hand out and grind the tools, and
clean the shops, under the direction of the assistant-
keeper. All this, however, is done principally by signs,
so that the attention of the other convicts is not dis-
tracted. Privies are placed in the corners of the shops.
Each workshop has a supply of water to which a pris-
oner can help himself at pleasure. In every mechanical
or trade department there is at least one assistant-
keeper who attends to the instruction of learners. The
assistant-keeper directs the appropriation of all raw
materials,keepsa daily account ofthework performed
by each convict, and regulates his daily task. He also
superintends the removal of his men to and from their
cells. A prisoner who wilfully or negligently injures his
work, tools, wearing apparel, or bedding, is immedi-
ately flogged by the assistant-keeper. The prisoners are
not allowed to speak to each other on any pretence,
except by special direction ofthe officers. They are not
at any time to leave their places without permission.
They are never to speak to any person who does not
belong to the prison, and must not look off from their
work at spectators. They are not to speak even to an
officer, except when absolutely necessary relative to
their business. For a violation of any of these rules
they are immediately flogged. A convict’s word is
never taken even against another convict, and much
less against an officer.
The prisoners are not allowed to write nor re-
ceive any letters, or intelligence from or concerning
their friends, or on any subject out of the prison.
No relative, or friend, is allowed to visit or speak to
a convict, except in some extraordinary case which
may require a personal interview, and which can
only take place in the presence of the keeper or his
deputy.
The assistant-keepers are twenty in number.
They are required to enforce strictly the general
observance of the regulations. They are not to
hold any conversation with the convicts, nor even
allow them to speak on any subject except on nec-
essary business. Each assistant-keeper must keep a
list of the names of the prisoners under his charge,
with the respective numbers of the cells occupied
by them, and the description of work at which they
are employed. If an assistant-keeper punishes a con-
vict for misconduct, he is required within a reason-
able time to make a report in writing to the keeper,
or his deputy, stating the prisoner’s name and of-
fence, and the nature and extent of the punishment
inflicted. The assistant-keepers are to correct con-
victs for every breach of discipline by stripes which
are to be inflicted with a raw-hide whip, and ap-
plied to the back in such a manner as not to expose
the head, face, eyes, or in any way to put the
convict’s health or limbs in danger. In aggravated
cases, a “cat,” made of six lashes of small twine,
may be applied to the bare back, under the direc-
tion of the keeper or deputy. The prisoner is com-
pelled to strip immediately on the commission of
an offence, and is flogged before the other prison-
ers. No superior officer is required to be present
on these occasions.

CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
1.
What impact did the development of modern
police forces in Europe have on American law
enforcement?
2.
How did the ideas of the Enlightenment
change Americans’ thinking about the causes of
crime? How do these ideas compare with
mainstream thought about crime and punish-
ment today?
3.
What did Auburn Prison hope to achieve with
its silent system of prison discipline? How does
the silent system compare to today’s use of
boot camp prisons?
4.
Did Eastern State’s use of solitary confinement
with labor solve the crime problem or improve
prison administration? Can you make any
comparisons with today’s supermax or control
unit prisons?
5.
Discuss the trial of Aaron Burr, the Judiciary Act
of 1789, and the Alien and Sedition Acts in terms
of the development of federal criminal justice.

LEARNI NG OBJECTIVES
After reading this chapter students should understand and be able to discuss:
How the conflict between states’ rights and federal law impacted the criminal justice system in the
years leading to the Civil War
The development of 24-hour policing in New York City
Why an absence in federal law enforcement led to the formation of private police and detective
organizations such as the Pinkertons
The development of indeterminate sentencing and juvenile institutions

Dred Scott decision
The ascendance of Andrew Jackson to the presidency
in 1828 inaugurated the “Age of the Common
Man.” Jackson’s two terms in office would coincide
with the dramatic transformation of American society
and social institutions as he presided over a country
entering the maelstrom of sectional politics, unprece-
dented immigration, and a criminal justice system still
undergoing transition from its colonial roots.
A self-made man, Jackson was the first president
born west of the Appalachian Mountains and the first
born in a log cabin. Espousing a platform that favored
the common people, he harbored a lasting animosity
against the well-born and the gentry as he worked to
remove the obstacles that kept ordinary white citizens
from climbing the social ladder to economic prosper-
ity. Jackson introduced an important component to
urban politics by embracing a spoils system that
opened public offices to partisan supporters. Although
Jackson claimed that his goal was to prevent the de-
velopment of a class of corrupt civil servants, the re-
sults of his efforts would prove otherwise.
The Jacksonian period in America coincided
with the years 1820–1850, a period when Ameri-
cans first perceived crime as a threat to the order
and security of the Republic. In response, various
constituencies turned to the developing police
forces of urban America, others to the developing
prison systems. Since colonial Americans felt little
threatened by problems of crime, many Americans
suggested that the new environment was the result
of the declining authority of the church and family.
With Americans on the move to the western fron-
tier or to the new urban centers, it seemed to many
that a lack of community pressure had left a void in
the moral center.
By the late 1820s, Irish immigration had begun
to make an impact on eastern seaport cities. These
towns witnessed a concomitant growth of slums as
the Irish exodus to America continued over the
next 30 years. The flood of immigrants into cities
such as New York affected every segment of soci-
ety, particularly the development of the criminal
justice system. In a time without building codes,
sanitation and health services, and even professional
policing, lower Manhattan reached a population
density unmatched in the world. By 1855, New
York was crammed with 290,000 people per square
mile compared to London’s 175,816.1 Among the

most vociferous opponents to the Irish immigrants
were Protestant workers who surmised that the
Irish Catholic workers represented a threat to their
wages since the immigrants would work for less
money. According to Protestants, the Catholic
Church represented despotism and subservience to
Rome; thus, nativist writers would infer that the
Catholics represented a papist threat to American
democratic institutions, presaging the xenophobia
of the Know-Nothing Party in the 1850s.
The Irish immigration of the antebellum years
was the first large-scale immigration to America of
non–Anglo-Saxon Protestants. Most were unskilled
laborers, and by 1850 they represented more than
one-third of New York City’s population. Re-
stricted from upward mobility by the Protestant up-
per classes, they congregated in close-knit enclaves
where they found that joining the Democratic Party
could lead to social and economic advancement. The
prevailing nativism of the period led to an early affin-
ity between urban immigrants and the developing
political machines of New York and Chicago.
By the 1830s, the nation was becoming increas-
ingly factionalized over slavery. During the previous
decade, slavery had spread west into Alabama,
Mississippi, Texas (still
part of Mexico), and
Louisiana. Racial unrest was viewed as a continuous
threat in both the North and the South. Although
racial warfare was an omnipresent threat in the South
with the large population of slaves, northern cities
saw white mobs repeatedly attack African American
neighborhoods from the 1830s into the 1850s.
One alternative to slavery and revolt that gained
increasing currency in the 1830s was the abolition
movement. By the late 1830s, there were 1,300 an-
tislavery societies in the North comprised of tens of
thousands of members. Foremost among the aboli-
tionists was William Lloyd Garrison (1805–1879) of
Massachusetts. Unlike British abolitionists who
supported the gradual emancipation of the slaves,
Garrison was of a more radical mind, insisting on im-
mediate and unconditional emancipation. Garrison
became the most reviled man in the South, and
in 1831, Georgia offered a reward of $5,000 to any-
one who would transport him to Georgia for trial.
Abolitionist groups drew an increasingly diverse
constituency as they distributed their literature to a
more receptive audience in the 1840s.
Abolitionists were often targeted by mobs in
both sections of the country. Anti-abolitionist
mobs were usually led by prominent members of
the community, including bankers, judges, mer-
chants, and physicians. Mobs singled out the homes
and businesses of abolitionists and particularly their
printing presses.
TH E LAWGI VERS
The Democratic era ushered in by the Jacksonian
presidency swept away many of the barriers that
had reserved the legal profession as the preserve of
the more respected members of society. Massachusetts
was among the states leading the way in 1836 when
it proclaimed that “any citizen of this Common-
wealth of the age of twenty-one years, and of good
moral character, who shall have devoted three years
to the study of law, in the office of some attorney
within this State, shall on application to the
Supreme Court or Court of Common Pleas, be
admitted to practice as an attorney in any court of
this Commonwealth.”2 Within a few years, not
even a high school education would be required for
admission to the state bar. The same “democratic”
movement swept the country, and requirements to
practice the law would become so lax that Abraham
Lincoln was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1837 with
less than a grammar school training in school credits.
Voting Qualifications
One of the most profound political developments
of the early nineteenth century was the gradual
elimination of property qualifications for voting
and holding political office. Having initially fol-
lowed the English precedent during the colonial
era of expecting voters to have a stake in the com-
munity by owning a certain minimum amount of
land as a voting qualification, prospective office-
holders were required to meet even higher property
qualifications. By the 1830s, many states had dis-
carded voting qualifications for white men. This

transition from voting qualifications to universal
white male suffrage was made with little dissension.
One of the more notorious episodes of violence
occurred in Rhode Island, where suffrage was still
limited to landowners and oldest sons in the 1830s.
Without a charter granting a bill of rights, in 1841
less than half the adult white males were qualified
to vote. That same year, Harvard-educated attorney
Thomas W. Dorr organized a campaign to draft a
new state constitution that would abolish voting
restrictions. Subsequently, the state militia was
called out to arrest Dorr and his followers for insur-
rection. After an unsuccessful attempt to seize the
state arsenal, Dorr was arrested and sentenced to life
in prison for high treason. This turn of events un-
leashed a wave of popular resentment, leading the
governor to pardon Dorr and Rhode Island to
adopt a new constitution.
States’ Rights and Federal Law
During the Jacksonian era, states’ rights came into
conflict with federal law, setting the stage for nu-
merous precedent-setting events. During the dec-
ades leading up to the Civil War, most Americans
felt that they had the right to govern themselves
without interference by the federal government.
No real demarcation between state and federal
rights had been established. No small part of the
responsibility for resolving this controversy lay
with the Supreme Court, which had not suffi-
ciently settled these issues at the termination of
John Marshall’s career. Leaders in both the North
and the South, particularly those who took firm
stands in favor of the rights of individual states,
were left with the impression that they could leave
the Union over certain grievances. While other
states did not recognize the right of secession,
they maintained that they had the right to nullify
federal laws that they found unacceptable.
In one of the best-known test cases, South
Carolina’s John Calhoun proclaimed the right of
his state to nullify any federal legislation that it dis-
approved of. In 1833, he was given an opportunity
to test the murky waters of states’ rights during the
presidency of Andrew Jackson. Almost 30 years
before the outbreak of the Civil War, South
Carolina attempted to nullify the “tariff of abomi-
nations,” which southern states felt ruined their
interests for the benefit of the North. Calhoun
claimed that the tariff made southerners “the serfs
of the system—out of whose labor is raised, not
only the money paid into the Treasury, but the
funds out of which are drawn the rich rewards of
the manufacturer and his associates in interest.”
With South Carolina threatening to secede,
Jackson, determined to uphold national authority
over his leanings for the slave system, prepared for
military action. President Jackson asserted that
American nationhood existed before state sover-
eignty and that nullification was “incompatible
with the existence of the Union.” Jackson de-
nounced nullification as treason and eventually
convinced Congress to pass a compromise tariff,
but not before South Carolina backed down from
its threat to leave the Union. In the process, this
southern state learned an important lesson, namely
that successful resistance to northern “tyranny”
would require the cooperation of other southern
slave states.
The Taney Court
Succeeding John Marshall as chief justice of the Su-
preme Court in 1836, Roger Taney (1777–1864)
and other justices appointed by Andrew Jackson re-
flected the transition to a new era in which the focus
of the court shifted from federal to state power. A
product of a different era, Taney was the first chief
justice to wear trousers rather than traditional knee
breeches. Under Taney’s direction, the Supreme
Court would reflect Jackson’s emphasis on public
power in contrast to the Marshall Court’s constitu-
tional protection of property rights. During his three
decades at the helm, Taney increased the power of
the states and limited the reach of the national
government.
The Fugitive Slave Act
Since the introduction of slavery in the seventeenth
century, slaves had fled from the repressive restraints
124

of bondage. During the colonial era, most legislatures
enacted laws prohibiting slaves from running away
and sanctioning specific punishments for recaptured
slaves. Various strategies were employed to capture
runaway bondsmen, ranging from using native In-
dians as slave catchers to utilizing reward systems.
In the early nineteenth century, several north-
ern states initiated programs to emancipate slaves,
and abolitionists became more vocal and numerous.
By the 1820s, New York, Massachusetts, and
Pennsylvania had passed laws that required jury
trials to convene before a master could take an
alleged fugitive slave out of the state. Southerners
were outraged by these “personal liberty laws” and
argued that the laws violated the Constitution,
which protected individual property. In 1842, the
Supreme Court ruled in Prigg v. Pennsylvania that
Pennsylvania’s personal liberty laws violated the
Constitution’s fugitive slave clause.
In response, many northern states adopted more
stringent policies for preventing the return of fugi-
tive slaves to the South. Southerners demanded a
tougher fugitive slave law, arguing that it had be-
come virtually impossible to retrieve runaway slaves
in the North. The passage of the pivotal Compro-
mise of 1850 was accompanied by the passage of a
much more uncompromising fugitive slave law.
According to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850,
alleged runaways were prohibited from testifying in
court, and decision making was taken out of the
hands of local officials and placed within the pur-
view of federal officials. Most inflammatory was the
use of the army and federal marshals as security
forces to protect slave masters and federal officials
from the violent attempts at slave rescue by aboli-
tionists. Opposition to the law took a variety of
forms, including riots, rescue attempts, and attacks
on courthouses and jails.
The arrest of the slave Thomas M. Sims in
1851 demonstrates the subterfuge that was used
by law enforcement to enforce the law. Reputedly
a runaway from Virginia, he was arrested on a false
charge of theft in Boston. Following an arraign-
ment at the courthouse, the police commissioner
overruled constitutional objections to the Fugitive
Slave Act, and, in the quiet of early morning, Sims
was clandestinely spirited from his cell to a ship that
would carry him south to slavery. This case, as did
many others, served only to rouse the antislavery
factions into more ardent opposition, and in 1854 a
U.S. marshal was killed during a failed rescue at-
tempt. Many Civil War historians credit the Fugi-
tive Slave Act with escalating sectional tensions,
leading to the Civil War.
The Temperance Movement
The transformation of American society in the first
half of the nineteenth century was accompanied
by growing clamor for a temperance movement
and the growth of nativism. Nativism found politi-
cal expression in 1843 with the formation of the
American Republic Party in New York. Subse-
quently, the party attracted a national following as
the Know-Nothing Party in 1850. Anti-Catholic
and antislavery, the moral prejudices of the party
found a voice in the antebellum temperance cam-
paign of the 1840s and 1850s. Among the more
vociferous temperance groups was the Sons of
Temperance, which would claim 250,000 dues-
paying members by 1850. Whether religious or
secular in nature, reform groups soon resorted to
political action to accomplish their objectives. In
1833, a resolution was introduced by an abolition-
ist, declaring “the traffic in ardent spirits” morally
wrong.3 The author of the resolution followed up
by asking that communities be allowed to pass laws
prohibiting the traffic in liquor within their jurisdic-
tions. In 1838, temperance advocates won their first
major victory when Massachusetts banned the sale
of liquor in amounts under 15 gallons. This attempt
to keep distilled liquor from taverns and the poor
was repealed in 1840, but not before fomenting
episodes of civil disobedience.
In the mid-1840s, abolitionists joined the cru-
sade for temperance in Maine, and in 1846, a law
was passed prohibiting the sale of intoxicating bev-
erages in less than 28-gallon increments. Enforce-
ment of the law was added to the duties of town
selectmen, who typically looked the other way
when infractions occurred. Prohibitionists received
their greatest victory with the passage of the Maine

Law of 1851, which prohibited the sale and manu-
facture of all intoxicating beverages within the state.
By 1855, 13 states had passed similar laws, and
New England, New York, and parts of the Mid-
west were considered dry. As a consequence, the
per capita consumption of alcohol between 1830
and 1850 plummeted. Although most of the prohi-
bition laws were repealed by the late 1850s, from
the antebellum era on, the temperance crusade
played an instrumental role in American politics
and would offer many challenges to law enforce-
ment on both the local and the state levels.
Reforms
Pennsylvania introduced a statute differentiating the
two degrees of murder in 1794, with only murder
in the first degree a capital offense. Other states
soon changed their laws to reflect the degrees of
culpability in deciding on the death penalty for
murder. According to Pennsylvania law, first degree
included the use of poison, any premeditated mur-
der, or murder perpetrated during the commission
of arson, robbery, or burglary. Other murders were
classified as second degree. Virginia was the first to
borrow this definition and was soon followed by
Ohio (1824), New York (1827), and Missouri
(1835).4 This innovation reflected a growing move-
ment against the death penalty during the antebel-
lum years that saw the amount of capital crimes
reduced significantly. South Carolina saw capital
offenses plunge from 165 in 1813 to 22 by 1850.
LAW ENFORCEMENT
As American cities grappled with the problems of
industrialization, urbanization, and immigration in
the 1830s and 1840s, numerous experiments in polic-
ing were attempted. Southern cities such as New
Orleans and Charleston tried uniformed city guards
with sporadic successes. With the financial support of
a wealthy local philanthropist, Philadelphia established
day and night police forces in the 1830s, one of the
first American cities to do so. The experiment proved
only temporary, disbanding in a short time.
Boston made hesitant first steps toward police re-
form following incessant ethnic rioting in the 1830s.
After calling on the militia to suppress a riot between
Irish mourners and local firemen, Marshal Francis
Tukey was hired to build a proficient police force.
But with a rising index of efficiency measured by the
capture of several hundred criminals, the public’s
antagonism turned instead against the force. In 1851,
Boston created the country’s first police department
detective division and four years later would establish
a force along Robert Peel’s London model.
The New York City Police
In 1844, New York City’s traditional night watch
was legislated out of existence and replaced with a
new system comprised of separate day and night
police forces, becoming the first city to merge the
day and night forces into a uniformed police depart-
ment model after Peel’s English bobbies. Initially, the
state authorized the hiring of 800 men for the new
force, but the city council demurred, hiring only a
quarter of that number. The force quickly demon-
strated its inadequacy, but the following year the state
legislature adopted the original plan for 800 uni-
formed municipal police officers with the passage of
New York City Municipal Police Act. According
to police historian Wilbur R. Miller, this act “created
the first police force modeled on London’s precedent
outside of the British Empire.”5
With a long-established antipathy for uniforms
of any kind, many of the original officers objected to
wearing specially designed uniforms, preferring to
choose their own outfits. Like many Londoners in
the years before the acceptance of the uniformed
bobbies, there was a strong resistance to the British
innovation of uniformed policing. Worried that
uniforms were an infringement on American free-
doms and represented the dangers of a standing
army to democratic institutions, opponents com-
pared uniformed officers to “liveried lackeys.”
Thus, a compromise was reached in which police
officers wore eight-point, star-shaped copper badges
over their left breasts instead of a complete uniform,
hence their identification as the “star police,” “cop-
pers,” or just plain “cops.”6
126

The year 1845 saw the introduction of New
York City’s first patrol guide, which emphasized
Peel’s objectives of the prevention of crime, noting
that “the prevention of crime being the most im-
portant object … the absence of crime will be con-
sidered the best proof of the efficiency of the
police.” Responding to a fire at the Bowery The-
ater in 1845, wearing uniforms dignified by gleam-
ing brass buttons, crowds of street toughs laughed at
the new police, accusing them of mimicking the
London bobbies. And so the experiment with uni-
forms ended, and it was not revived until eight
years later in 1853, when the New York City po-
lice finally adopted full uniforms.
The development of modern policing after
1845 was hampered by a lack of consensus about
wearing uniforms, whether police should be
armed, and the use of force. The lack of a uniform
hindered the goal of policing, which was to be
visible. Those against uniforms argued that it
would offer criminals an advantage by immedi-
ately identifying the police. New York City was
the first city to surmount the controversy by man-
dating that when the current officers’ four-year
terms of duty ended in 1853, the police commis-
sioners would fire whoever refused to don a uni-
form. Boston and Chicago followed suit in a few
years, and as the Civil War years approached,
American men felt less insecure about wearing
uniforms. In a major departure from the London
model, there was little argument that American
police should be armed, although it did not occur
immediately.
One of the early turning points for the new
force took place in 1849, when a riot developed
out of a rivalry between supporters of two leading
actors at the Astor Place Theater. When a mob
attempted to prevent one of the performers from
taking the stage, a wild melee ensued, with the mob
throwing rocks at a small, outmatched police de-
tachment. The local militia was called to the scene
and opened fire on the crowd, killing 22 and
wounding 40. A public uproar led the police force
to implement riot control training and military drills
for police officers, probably the first riot training in
American police history.
From 1845 to 1853, New York City police-
men were appointed by aldermen. Beginning in
1853, a board of police commissioners, made up
of the mayor, the city recorder, and the city judge,
took over the appointment of policemen. The new
protocol ensured that a system of graft would de-
termine the selection of police rather than any spe-
cific requirements. In the early years of the force, it
cost a $40 bribe to the precinct captain to become a
patrolman and at least another $150 to a political
champion. The most sought-after position was the
$1,000 per year captain’s position, which cost a
minimum of $200 for appointment.
Federal Law Enforcement
For at least the first half of the nineteenth century,
federal policing was mainly within the domain of
the U.S. Marshals Service. Created by the Judiciary
Act of 1789, marshals were originally restricted to
four-year appointments by the president. During
the first year of their existence, the marshals were
hamstrung by a lack of direction and power. With
an absence of an immediate supervisor and the po-
litical nature of their appointment, their capacity as
criminal justice professionals was severely limited.
Particularly vexing was their poor remuneration
due to their dependence on a fee list that had
been used by county sheriffs until the 1850s. But
as late as 1842, legislators capped a marshal’s salary
at $6,000, with any additional income required to
be turned over to the Treasury Department. In
1853, the outmoded fee system was discarded in
favor of a more equitable pay scale.
In the years leading up to the Civil War, U.S.
marshals would face the widespread counterfeiting
of the skilled “coneymen,” so named because of
the wide diversity of currency issued in the years
before a modern banking system. According to
most estimates, one-third of the currency in circula-
tion between 1815 and 1860 was counterfeit. With
individual banks issuing various bank notes in a be-
wildering array of denominations, together with
U.S. Treasury notes and postal currency, opportu-
nities were many for those skilled in duplicating cur-
rencies. Although the marshals were the first line of

defense, the Treasury Department occasionally hired
detectives to crack the counterfeiting rings. In 1865,
Congress finally recognized the need for special
measures to suppress counterfeiting by creating the
Secret Service under the secretary of the treasury.
During the 1840s and following the conflict
with Mexico (1846–1848), the United States in-
creased its boundaries, adding sparsely populated
territories to its domain. In these unorganized terri-
tories, the U.S. marshals provided the only formal
law enforcement. According to federal law, when a
population of a federal territory reached 5,000 free
white males, a bicameral legislature could be elected
and territorial laws promulgated. After reaching
60,000 free white males, the territory could be nom-
inated for statehood, and the nomination would then
be forwarded to Congress for final approval.
On several occasions, marshals required the army
to assist them in their law enforcement functions in
the vast West, and in 1854 a presidential proclama-
tion authorized marshals to call on the army as posse
comitatus. During the period before a territory
became a state, any crime was considered a federal
violation; hence, marshals saw continuous action as
the only lawmen. As territories made the transition to
statehood, marshals gave up much of their authority
to territorial lawmen, such as sheriffs. As the only
federal law enforcement officers prior to the Civil
War, federal marshals were continually tested as
America teetered on the brink of sectional conflict.
One form of federal law enforcement that has
not received its proper due is the Postal Service
inspectors. In 1836, Congress reorganized the Post
Office and authorized it to hire full-time special
agents with broad authority to investigate any aspect
of the Postal Service. Police historian David Johnson
credits the postal inspectors, imbued with arrest
powers, as “the first formal police force within the
executive branch of the federal government.”7
Private Police and San Francisco
Vigilantes
During the 1850s, law enforcement was often absent
from the developing communities west of the
Mississippi River. In 1855, Allan J. Pinkerton
(1819–1884)
founded
what
would
become
Pinkerton’sNationalDetectiveAgency,whichinitially
handledcasesincommunitieswithlimitedlawenforce-
ment expertise. The private detective has a rich tradi-
tion dating back to the eighteenth-century thief takers
of England and the exploits of Eugene François Vidocq
in France. The arrival of the Pinkertons on the national
stage in the 1850s heralded new developments in po-
licing strategies and investigative techniques in America
as the nation moved toward sectional conflict.
Born in Glasgow, Scotland, Pinkerton found his life’s calling
after playing an instrumental role in the capture of a gang
of counterfeiters soon after migrating to America in 1842.
Pinkerton entered law enforcement in 1846 as a deputy
sheriff in Illinois. In 1850, he became the first detective hired
by the Chicago Police Department and on several occasions
was called on by the U.S. Treasury Department to battle
counterfeiters. After opening his own detective agency in
1855, he adopted numerous investigative techniques and,
according to some sources, introduced the first rogues gal-
lery, which displayed the characteristics and idiosyncrasies of
known criminals. During America’s railroad expansion of the
1850s, Pinkerton was hired to create a spying system to
keep railroad conductors from stealing fares. Soon after, he
created an all-seeing eye as the symbol for the company,
hence its motto “The Eye That Never Sleeps.”
San Francisco, in the wake of the 1849 California
gold rush, became the center of vigilante activity8 in
America. According to historian Frank Richard
Prassel, “The term regulator fell into disuse after
much publicity accorded the San Francisco vigilance
committees of 1851 and 1856.”9 Miner’s courts dis-
pensed justice in the gold camps of California, where
formal law enforcement was almost nonexistent.
According to one miner, “The marvel of marvels is,
the mob-law and failure of justice were so infrequent,
that society was so well and swiftly organized.”10
Forced to contend with a rapidly growing criminal
element, the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance
was organized in June 1851. Led by a former
Mormon elder, this vigilance organization differed
from other incarnations of this activity by offering
those charged with crimes formal and reasonably fair
trials before they were hanged. Within several
months, this committee was disbanded as lawbreaking
diminished.

With crime once more on the rise in 1855, a new
vigilance committee was created. Under the direc-
tion of some of the town’s leading citizens, hangings
were soon drawing crowds by the thousands. Apolo-
gists for the vigilantes suggest that the second coming
was given impetus by the collusion between corrupt
city politicians and local outlaw bands. Boasting over
5,000 members, the 1856 San Francisco Vigilance
Committee was perhaps the largest manifestation of
the vigilante phenomenon in American history.
With the return of the city to acceptable, honest
officials, the group disbanded.
CORR ECTI ONS
By the antebellum era, prisons had become an
established part of the American criminal justice
system as each year new institutions were con-
structed in various states. By the 1840s, many prison
methods had become fixed with little room for ex-
perimentation as champions heralded the benefits of
either the Pennsylvania system or the Auburn sys-
tem. The years 1787–1820 witnessed the initial
stage of prison reform in America, which was fol-
lowed by the construction of Eastern State Peniten-
tiary and Auburn Prison between 1820 and 1830.
The third wave of prison reform between 1830 and
1840 built on the foundations laid by the introduc-
tion of new prison designs. It was during this time
that Auburn continued to reduce its state mainte-
nance expenses as other New York prisons began to
turn profits. Supporters of the Auburn system saw
this as confirmation that the silent rigid system of
discipline and security was the solution to the age-
old problem of housing prisoners, while at the same
time backers of the Pennsylvania system found
solace in the fact that the solitary system had pre-
vented the criminogenic contamination of prisoners
through physical association.
In its 1850 report, the Boston Prison Discipline
Society recorded 4,060 prisoners housed in 19 dif-
ferent prisons (figures for six other prisons were not
reported in the survey). Of these, only five state
prisons had more than 200 prisoners (New York,
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Maryland),
a figure that would not rise until after the Civil
War. During the industrial phase of prison admin-
istration, the Auburn system prevailed over the
Pennsylvania system because it produced better in-
dustrial returns and was easier to maintain.
Prison Reform
During the 1840s, numerous states established prison
reform societies. In 1844, the Prison Association of
New York was inaugurated and the following year
saw the founding of the Massachusetts Society in Aid
of Discharged Convicts and the Pennsylvania Society
for the Alleviation of the Miseries of Public Prisons.
Clearly, strides were being taken to counter the per-
vasive corruption and brutality of the contemporary
prison. At the same time, a European prison congress
was convened in Germany to discuss the debatable
merits of the Auburn and the Pennsylvania systems.
The first critics of the Auburn system came from
the ranks of the “mechanics” who saw prison indus-
tries as unfair business competition. Others pointed to
the physical discipline that accompanied the silent sys-
tem. Reformers argued that the only way to maintain
a system of absolute silence was by the threat of severe
corporal punishments, such as flogging.
Pennsylvania prisons also came under attack since
those built under the solitary guidelines were the
most costly to construct and maintain. In addition,
the profits of a single individual working alone in a
cell paled in comparison to New York’s congregate
system. In marked contrast, Eastern State Penitentiary
suffered from a higher incidence of mortality, disease,
and insanity. By the 1840s, many of the early efforts
to create a functioning penitentiary had fallen on hard
times, and the belief had become widespread in
America that the prisons had failed to live up to earlier
expectations. Reformers such as Dorothea Dix visited
prisons in the early 1840s and found them in deplor-
able condition. She saved much of her energy for
leading a reform movement to champion the rights
of mentally ill prisoners.
Born in 1802, Dix worked as a schoolteacher until 1841.
She found her calling while conducting a Sunday school
lesson at a local jail in Massachusetts. On discovering the

primitive and inhumane treatment of prisoners suffering
from mental illness in the prison, Dix launched a one-
woman humanitarian crusade that would reach across
America and Europe during the antebellum years.
Between 1841 and 1852, she was credited with modern-
izing and expanding facilities for the insane as well as
helping pass reform legislation in many states and in
Canada. Although she persuaded the U.S. Congress to
pass a bill raising $12 million for the care of the insane,
President Franklin Pierce vetoed the legislation in 1854.
Over the next four years, Dix took her crusade to Europe,
procuring reform legislation for the insane in several
European countries. She continued to lobby on behalf
of the insane and prison inmates until 1881. She died
six years later in Trenton Hospital, an institution she
had helped establish.
Some of the most glaring examples of the
divergent conditions between state prisons and local
facilities were in the arena of punishment. State
prisons in Massachusetts and Connecticut rarely re-
sorted to corporal punishment, while in 1843 alone
Sing Sing Prison in New York distributed 36,000
lashes of the whip. Although records indicate that
the larger the prison, the more rigorous the punish-
ment, a clear trend toward diminished corporal
punishment typified the 1840s.
European visitors to American prisons, ranging
from Charles Dickens to Alexis de Tocqueville,
commented on the solemnity and silence that char-
acterized most prisons. However, if the same ob-
servers were to have visited in subsequent decades,
they would have found a cacophony of sounds em-
anating from overcrowded prison cells. From the
1820s through the 1850s, corporal punishment
and zealous discipline ensured obedience in prisons.
Added to this was the legislative willingness to sup-
ply funds to build more prisons when cells were
needed, and the overcrowding problem would be
put off for several decades.
One other integral hallmark of antebellum
prisons was the enforced regular labor of inmates.
Prison routine required prisoners to work from 8 to
10 hours each day under the threat of physical pun-
ishment. Intended to impart discipline as well as a
satisfactory financial windfall, those prisons that
showed a profit earned the most praise from the
public. Hence, the Auburn system flourished over
the Pennsylvania one because it paid better returns.
By the 1840s, American prison reformers initi-
ated paramilitary discipline to augment the already
elaborate regimentation. New York prisons intro-
duced daily routines including lockstep marching,
which required inmates to move in close order and
single file, in unison, each head inclined to the right,
with each man looking over the shoulder of the man
in front. In this way, guards could ensure that con-
versations were eliminated and prisoners could not
dally from place to place. Also augmenting the in-
creased emphasis on regimentation was the introduc-
tion of striped uniforms. Another ramification of this
innovation was the adoption of prison uniforms by
guards as well. It was not a huge step to designing
prisons that looked like medieval fortresses, promot-
ing security and isolation while making prisoners feel
more diminutive and regulated.
Juvenile Institutions
In 1817, the Society for the Prevention of Pauperism
of New York became the first group in America to
call attention to neglected children between the ages
of 10 and 18. Eight years later, the House of Refuge
opened its doors in New York City and became the
earliest child-saving institution in the country. Its
charges included both the destitute and the neglected
and children sentenced to incarceration for criminal
activity. This would be one of the first institutions to
jail children and adults separately. However, discipline
was anything but benign, with punishment ranging
from whipping and solitary confinement to reduction
in food supply. Predicting the industrial prisons of the
future, the House of Refuge kept the boys busy mak-
ing goods to be sold. This could occasionally lead to
apprenticeships with master artisans outside the walls
as long as they followed the rules. Houses of refuge
were subsequently constructed in Philadelphia and
Boston, where corporal punishment was banned.
Although black children were initially prohibited, in
1834 New York’s house of refuge made plans for a
“colored section.”
Despite attempts to separate the children from
adult prisons, many children remained behind bars

in adult jails. In the late 1820s, the Boston Prison
Discipline Society reported that many of these chil-
dren were under the age of 12. As late as 1845,
almost 100 children ages 6 to 18 resided in the
Massachusetts House of Corrections. During the
1850s, a rise in female juvenile offenders became a
new concern, and reform schools were established
under different guidelines from the boys. It was
hoped that by offering a strong mothering environ-
ment and teaching morals, these young girls could
grow up to become good mothers. In 1856, the
first girl’s reformatory was opened as the Massachu-
setts State Industrial School for Girls. Departing
from the traditional dormitory-style construction,
it separated children into smaller housing groups
according to their offenses and backgrounds.
During the late 1850s, similar institutions were
opened in Illinois and Ohio. Most avoided an ur-
ban setting in favor of a rural one. According to the
theory of the day, it was presumed that city living
was the root of evil and social problems and offered
too many temptations to unsupervised children.
Alexander Maconochie and
Indeterminate Sentencing
While the threat of physical punishment was omni-
present in the antebellum prison, alternative experi-
ments to punishment were tried in several states.
The main contribution of the reformatory era to
American prisons was the introduction of the inde-
terminate sentence and parole laws. Considered the
“father of parole” in the late 1830s and 1840s,
Captain Alexander Maconochie of Great Britain
began to conceive a new scheme for the punish-
ment of convicts while assigned to England’s prison
colony at Van Diemen’s Land (now Tasmania).
Shortly after arriving on the island, he hatched an
idea by which the convicts would be sentenced not
to a specific period of time but rather to a certain
amount of labor that was measured by a system of
marks. According to his plan, convicts could earn
marks for good conduct and work or lose them for
bad behavior. Maconochie’s reforms were in part
spurred by the persistence of traditional methods of
corporal punishment and physical intimidation. He
had hoped that by allowing prisoners to work and
associate with other convicts and with the lingering
threat of punishment for all, if only one convict of-
fended, his system would encourage mutual trust and
a sense of responsibility among the prisoners.
Over the next several years, Maconochie created
a more elaborate system of indeterminate sentencing
that would also be applicable to prisons and not just
the prison colonies in Australia. Maconochie was
given the opportunity to test his experimental pro-
gram on Norfolk Island. Putting his mark system to
work, he attempted to inject a certain degree of ci-
vility into what he considered a den of iniquity. He
removed the bars from windows and opened prison
doors, offering prisoners books and musical instru-
ments. He tried to educate the prisoners about civili-
zation by encouraging the planting of gardens and
constructing religious sanctuaries. While he rated
his experiment a success, it was not long before the
colonists came into conflict with Maconochie and his
charges, and after a four-year experiment the island
was returned to its formerstate. Although Maconochie
was unsuccessful in his attempt to reform England’s
penal system, Walter Crofton would build on his ideas
in Ireland and eventually see many of Maconochie’s
ideas come to fruition.
In 1817, New York’s legislature passed but
never applied a good-time law by which prison sen-
tences were reduced for good work and behavior.
Beginning in 1836, Tennessee became the first state
to actually implement a good-time reduction of
prison sentences. However, this innovation would
not gain wider popularity until the late 1850s and
1860s, when 23 states would follow suit.
CRIM E AND PUNISHM ENT
By the 1830s, America’s largest cities began to ex-
perience a rising fear of crime. New York City
became home to burgeoning legions of gangs, in-
cluding the Irish-Catholic Dead Rabbits and the
nativist American Bowery Boys. The developing
slums of American cities paralleled the growing
disparity between the living conditions of the
native-born and the marginalized denizens of urban

America. On his tour of America in the early 1840s,
English novelist Charles Dickens noted the “leprous
houses” in the Five Points section of New York
City and surmised that “in respect of filth and
wretchedness,” it would give the most debauched
environs of London a run for the money.
New York has been a breeding ground for gangs since
the era of the American Revolution. Although their dates
of origin are speculative, gangs such as the Bowery Boys,
the Broadway Boys, and Smith’s Vly gang existed by the
end of the century as did African American gangs such as
the Fly Boys and Long Bridge Boys. But these gangs were
more social organization than crime syndicate. The ori-
gins of some of New York City’s nineteenth-century crime
syndicates can be found in the fetid Five Points neigh-
borhood in the early decades of the century. By the early
1820s overcrowding and rising immigration created new
opportunities and brought in new recruits for the gangs.
In the antebellum era ethnic tension pitted Irish Catholic
gangs (who were affiliated with the Democratic political
machine of Tammany Hall) against nativist gangs (whose
allegiance was to the anti-immigrant Know-Nothing
Party). Like many modern gangs, these early gangs wore
distinctive colors and clothing to announce their pres-
ence. Gang battles typically involved low-tech weapons
such as ice picks, brickbats, brass knuckles, and anything
that could be used to stab or bludgeon. A minimal police
force allowed these gangs to flourish. The early gangs of
New York were rather unsophisticated compared with
what was to come later, with most of their crimes being
accomplished with some level of violence, that is, when
they were not fighting each other. After the Civil War
several German gangs emerged in the Hell’s Kitchen
neighborhood, robbing residents, extorting protection
payments from businessmen, and burglarizing businesses.
The rising popularity of the penny presses during
the 1830s and 1840s was spurred in part by coverage
of lurid, sensational crimes, such as the Mary Rogers
murder case. The precursor to today’s tabloids and
mass media, the penny press hinged on selling papers,
and nothing sold them like crimes of passion.
Crime stories marketed for popular consump-
tion were not a new phenomenon. Beginning in
the colonial era, crime literature was marketed in
pamphlet form, usually accompanied by some reli-
gious lesson or moral warning. By the 1820s, a
more secular society became increasingly acceptable
of sensationalist literature without the heady dose of
moralism so reminiscent of a Puritan-dominated
society. By the 1820s, crime news began to steadily
seep into journalism.
The Mary Rogers Murder Case
The inept investigation of the murder of Mary Cecilia
Rogers in 1841 is considered by many scholars of po-
licing to be a clarion call for police reform in New
York City. A beautiful woman who clerked in a
New York City tobacco shop, she reportedly had no
shortage of admirers. She could count as customers lead-
ing literary figures, such as James Fenimore Cooper,
Washington Irving, and Edgar Allan Poe. By most
accounts, her murder inspired Poe to write America’s
first detective story, The Mystery of Marie Roget (1842).
The real Mary was found murdered in July
1841. Numerous theories emerged concerning her
last evening. The subsequent coroner’s autopsy and
the inadequate police investigation that followed
demonstrated to the public the limits of contempo-
rary policing. Since the body was found just over
the New Jersey border, New York City police
were reluctant to investigate. Police officers tradi-
tionally did not work a homicide unless a substan-
tial reward was offered. Since their incomes were
derived from rewards and fees, police officers spent
more time recovering stolen property.
In the years prior to a 24-hour force, untrained
and poorly paid night watchmen came under press
scrutiny as newspaper editors pressed for an investiga-
tion into the murder of the famous beauty. Even
New York Governor William Seward used the case
to call for stronger policing. Newspapers vilified law
enforcement for its zeal in pursuing robbers and
thieves to claim reward money or worthwhile stolen
property and for avoiding murders, which offered
fewer financial prospects. Although the case was never
solved, the murder gave impetus to a reform cam-
paign that led to more effective policing, and within
five years the New York City police had been reor-
ganized and made great strides toward professionalism.
Crime
The antebellum era introduced new forms of criminal
enterprise to America, forcing the criminal justice

system to play catch-up. The first bank robbery in
American history was recorded in 1831. Although it
was technically a burglary since no threat of violence
was used, in this case an English thief used duplicate
keys to enter a Wall Street bank in New York City
and abscond with $245,000. However, his penchant
for free spending and generous tipping, together with
the help of informers, led the police to his door and
the remaining $185,000. The thief was sentenced to
five years at hard labor in Sing Sing Prison. According
to one authority, he was treated more leniently
than future bank thieves because “his crime was un-
ique and the authorities were not prepared to deal
with it.” In the years following the Civil War, bank
robberies would become much more common.
In some arenas, fresh investigative techniques
heralded a new era in policing. One of the most
famous murder cases of the antebellum period was
the trial of Harvard professor John W. Webster for
the murder of Doctor George Parkman in 1849. A
cause célèbre, this crime attracted national attention.
Webster apparently struck Parkman a fatal blow while
arguing in Webster’s laboratory over financial matters.
A professor of chemistry, Webster decided to dispose
of the body by dismembering it and burning it in the
furnace. However, his misdeed was suspected by a
college janitor who pursued his own amateur investi-
gation and found parts of a human body. A subse-
quent investigation turned up a set of false teeth in the
ashes. Webster’s fate was sealed after Parkman’s dentist
identified them as belonging to the deceased, an early
example of dental evidence. Webster ultimately con-
fessed and went to the gallows.
Capital Punishment
The 1850s marked the climax of the antebellum
crusade to abolish execution as a criminal sanction.
Michigan
(1847),
Rhode
Island
(1850s),
and
Wisconsin (1850s) abolished the death penalty, but
opposition was barely existent in other states, al-
though some states replaced public hangings with
private executions. Once a fixture of American soci-
ety, public executions on the public square were
designed for maximum deterrence value. Thousands,
sometimes tens of thousands, would flock to these
events. In an era with little entertainment, it was not
uncommon for individuals to travel great distances to
attend the spectacle. While the last publicexecution in
America took place as late as 1936, there was clearly a
movement to end this medieval practice in the ante-
bellum period. The English ended public executions
in 1868 after generations of the bloody code.
Pennsylvania passed a law in 1834 requiring pri-
vate executions behind prison walls. During the
1830s, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
New York, and Connecticut also enacted laws pro-
hibiting public executions. The 30 years before the
Civil War are considered the height of America’s
abolitionist movement in the nineteenth century.
However, the carnage of the Civil War stopped
the abolitionist movement cold.
Sectional Variations
During the antebellum years, patterns of crime and
punishment became more recognizable along sec-
tional lines. In a study of South Carolina and
Massachusetts, historian Michael Stephen Hindus
contrasted the patterns of authority and criminal law
in rural slaveholding South Carolina with an indus-
trial urbanizing Massachusetts. Hindus discerned nu-
merous conflicting patterns of crime, prosecution,
and punishment in the two states of his study, pat-
terns that reflected the difference in the two societies
representing the North and the South.
The most common crimes in Massachusetts
tended to be “against property and propriety.”
On the other hand, violent crimes among whites
were the most frequent offenses in South Carolina,
while crimes against property were associated
with slaves. Reflecting two diametrically opposed
societies, Massachusetts, particularly as it joined
the industrial era, placed a high priority on order
and insisted on punishment to ensure the social or-
der. Here conviction rates were twice as high as in
South Carolina, where white crime was explained
away as the result of heated passions and elicited
little in the way of communitarian concern. How-
ever, when it came to property crimes committed
by slaves, conviction rates were much higher, and
punishment was much more severe.

AMERIC AN VIOLENCE
According to violence historian Richard Maxwell
Brown, the 1830s introduced America to “what
may have been the era of the greatest urban vio-
lence that [the nation] has ever experienced.”11 The
years following the war with Mexico would see
violence become even more prevalent. Perhaps
the preponderance of reports glamorizing the car-
nage in Mexico inured the younger generation to
violence, a generation that would make up much of
the fodder in the coming sectional conflict. Others
might suggest the proliferation of handguns con-
tributed to the growing mayhem.
Most of the interracial violence between blacks
and whites in the years leading up to the Civil War
was disproportionately directed toward slaves and
free blacks. Rarely was it the other way around.
However, in 1851 the African American commu-
nity of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, took up
arms against forces attempting to enforce the Fugi-
tive Slave Law of 1850 in the town of Christiana. In
the subsequent violence, black rioters killed a
Maryland farmer who was attempting to reclaim
several slaves. In response to this action, federal pro-
secutors charged 38 men with taking up arms
against the government, making this, according to
historian Thomas P. Slaughter, “the largest mass in-
dictment for treason in the history of our nation.”12
Handguns and American Culture
Challenging the traditional presumption that gun
ownership was widespread in America between
1765 and 1850, historian Michael Bellesiles suggests
that guns played a “marginal role in American life
prior to the Civil War.”13 Citing a study of 685
nineteenth-century murders prior to 1846, Bellesiles
found that knives were the preferred weapon, with
guns used in only less than 20% of the incidents.
Others suggest that Bellesiles has overinterpreted
his evidence, which is based on various data includ-
ing a 10-year study of probate records and wills.
While the debate continues, there is little argument
that guns would be used increasingly in murders as
America reached midcentury, with gun homicides
almost doubling between 1846 and 1860. The years
following the Civil War would demonstrate the
centrality of the gun to American murder rates as
soldiers returned home with their weapons in tow.
Although Samuel Colt’s introduction of his
1832 revolver did not initially capture the imagina-
tion of the gun-buying public, by the 1840s other
gun companies were inspired to offer similar revol-
vers. Improvements in revolver construction would
be reflected by a growing number of gun deaths in
urban settings.
While gun ownership is common in most of
rural America, the South has been most tradition-
ally represented as a gun-owning culture. Although
rifles have predominated, since the antebellum era
handguns have become an increasing presence in
the South. By the late 1970s, research indicated
that 40% of all southerners owned handguns com-
pared to 24% in non-southern and mountain re-
gions. In the nineteenth-century South, anecdotal
evidence indicates that an emphasis on honor and
gun ownership exacerbated the homicide rate.
According to 1850 mortality reports, the South
had a murder rate of 2.28 per 100,000, more than
7 times the murder rates of the North.14
Gunplay was not the exclusive preserve of
adults, as witnessed by an 1857 newspaper account
of a young boy accidentally shooting himself in the
abdomen. In a perspicacious editorial, the editor
warned that “young America” should “take warn-
ing by accidents of this kind, and mentions having
noticed several boys in the streets lately popping
about with pistols.” The editor closed his screed
with a rhetorical flourish asking, “Is there no
town ordinance forbidding the dangerous practice
of shooting in the streets?”15
Mob Rioting
America had experienced few outbreaks of mob
violence prior to the 1830s. In the ensuing decade,
the nation witnessed an increase in this increasingly
destructive behavior. According to one estimate,
there were 147 riots in 1835 alone, most related
to the growing sectional rancor between abolition-
ists and proslavers. Another study found that almost
134

three-quarters of America’s cities with populations
exceeding 20,000 experienced some type of “major
disorder” between 1830 and 1865.16
However, the slavery issue was not the lone
precipitator of this violence. Among the many expla-
nations for the rising tide of violence was unprece-
dented urbanization and industrialization in a society
rooted in institutions still based on rural community
ideals of an earlier America. Add to this the catalyzing
issues of race, abolitionism, the rise of party politics,
and ethnic divisions, and American cities would be
the setting for urban rioting for the three decades
preceding the Civil War. Compounding the tensions
and divisions of the era was the commercial depres-
sion of 1837 that put a squeeze on the job market at a
time of increasing immigration. Between 1840 and
1860, almost three million Irish and half that many
Germans immigrated to America, outnumbering all
other immigrant groups.
Election riots were not uncommon in the days
before private voting booths. Known as one of the
most violent cities of the antebellum era, Baltimore,
Maryland, had earned the moniker “Mob Town”
during an 1812 anti-Federalist riot. Between 1834
and 1862, the city experienced 15 major riots.17
While violence often radiated from political, eco-
nomic, ethnic, labor, and sectional issues, Election
Day often led to similar strife. Baltimore was the
scene of Election Day rioting throughout much
of the 1850s, as Irish-Catholics supporting urban
Democrats clashed with the nativist Protestant
supporters of the Know-Nothing Party.
Ethnic and racial violence often pitted poor Irish
and German immigrants against even poorer blacks
and native-born Americans in a bid for unskilled
jobs. In other cases, divisions were often along reli-
gious lines, pitting Protestant native Americans
against recent Catholic immigrants. Unlike other
immigrant groups, the Irish preferred to live in the
urban centers of the industrial Northeast. During the
1840s, poor Irish enclaves appeared in Boston, New
York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, leading to a
wave of antagonism against Irish-Catholics that often
ended in violence and discrimination. The first major
anti-Catholic riot erupted in 1834 in Charlestown,
Massachusetts, when lower-class Protestants objected
to the convent school operated by the Ursuline sisters
in their neighborhood. The subsequent burning
of the convent provoked anti-Catholic violence
throughout the country.
The 1844 nativist riots in Philadelphia were
among the most violent incidents of the antebel-
lum era. In his book The Turbulent Era, historian
Michael Feldberg chronicled the cultural and reli-
gious conflict between Philadelphia’s nativist Pro-
testants and Irish-Catholic immigrants. The riots
were the outcome of not simply religious intoler-
ance but reflected the weakness of contemporary
law enforcement and the social and political disor-
ganization of the era.
Mob violence was not exclusive to the eastern
states. Meanwhile, a similar epidemic of discrimina-
tion faced the Chinese immigrants who were lured to
California and the West following the discovery of
gold in 1848. Thousands made the journey across the
Pacific seeking their fortunes. But unlike their Euro-
pean counterparts, the ethnic distinctiveness and
competition for wages of the Chinese singled them
out for racial discrimination in the 1850s.
Most of the rioting against abolitionists occurred
in the antebellum North. In some cases, early
New York City gangs precipitated the violence to
use the disorder as a cover for looting. While most
assaults on abolitionists were not intended to kill, the
murder of abolitionist Elijah P. Lovejoy in 1837
demonstrated the heated passions of the slavery de-
bate. After calling for the formation of a local branch
of the American Anti-Slavery Society in southern
Illinois, an angry mob stormed his shop and killed
him as he defended it with 60 armed abolitionists.
NOTABLE TRIALS
Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857)18
There was little to suggest in Dred Scott’s early life
the mark his name would make on the brewing
sectional crisis. He was born to slave parents in
Virginia in the 1790s and taken to St. Louis,
Missouri, by his master in 1827. After his owner’s
death, he was left to a series of owners, one of

whom was an army surgeon who took him to the
free territories of Illinois and Wisconsin before re-
turning to St. Louis five years later. On his master’s
death, the surgeon’s wife inherited all her husband’s
property, including Scott. However, the wife
moved to New York and left Scott behind, and
he eventually came under the care of a Missouri
businessman and zealous abolitionist. With the sup-
port of the owner’s widow in 1846, he initiated a suit
in the Missouri courts to declare Scott free. While the
wife of his former owner could have signed papers
giving Scott his freedom, it was decided to fashion a
deliberate test case in the fight against slavery de-
signed to prove that a slave’s bondage terminated
when he was taken into free territory.
The end of the war with Mexico brought new
lands into the American system and heightened the
sectional conflict between pro- and antislavery sup-
porters over whether the new lands would be free
or slave states, and the issues raised by the Dred Scott
case steadily gained importance. The case reached the
Supreme Court finally in 1856 and was soon the fo-
cus of national attention as it became linked to more
complicated questions, such as whether Congress
had the power to prohibit slavery in a territory and
whether a slave could sue in federal court.
In 1857, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney issued
his stunning judgment ruling that Scott had no right
to sue in federal court because neither slaves nor free
blacks were citizens according to the U.S. Constitu-
tion. Taney rejected Scott’s argument that he had
become a free man by virtue of his residence in
the free territory of Wisconsin because “the act of
Congress which prohibited a citizen from holding
and owning property of this kind in the territory
of the United States north of the line therein men-
tioned, is not warranted by the Constitution, and is
therefore void.” In one fell swoop, the Supreme
Court denied citizenship to blacks and barred Con-
gress from interfering with slaveholding in the terri-
tories. As a national institution, slavery could not be
abolished without a constitutional amendment.
Taney’s decision also delivered a substantive
reading to the due process clause for the first
time, maintaining that the due process clause lim-
ited the power of Congress to confiscate property
rights no matter what procedure was set forth.
Taney ruled, “Thus the rights of property are
united with the rights of person, and placed on
the same ground as the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution, which provides that no person shall
be deprived of life, liberty, and property, without
due process of law.”
The Dred Scott decision by the Supreme Court
undermined any chances for future compromise on
the issue of the expansion of slavery, as it strength-
ened southern resolve and heightened the sense of
southern superiority over its plantation economy.
Rather than quelling sectional strife, the Dred Scott
decision turned into a catalyst that helped propel
the nation into the Civil War. At the same time,
the Supreme Court lost considerable standing and
would subsequently play a weak role during the
Civil War. Somehow, Dred Scott the man was
lost in the controversial decision. He was freed by
his owners several weeks after the decision and
worked as a hotel porter in St. Louis until he suc-
cumbed to tuberculosis in 1858.
CONCLUSI ONS
While America had established a penal system by
the mid-1830s, it did little to mitigate the growing
crime rates in the antebellum years. Beginning in
the 1830s, urban America endured outbreaks of
mob violence over a variety of issues. Although
ineffectual law enforcement has been used as the
scapegoat for some of the violence, the develop-
ment of professional police forces in the 1840s
and 1850s does not fully explain the diminution
of mob rioting in America’s cities. According to
Feldberg, by the 1850s “municipal politics had ab-
sorbed much of the energies that nativist and im-
migrants had been investing in street violence,” and
local politics became an alternate but less deadly
battleground.19 Other explanations for the down-
turn in violence after the mid-1840s were the eco-
nomic improvement following the panic of 1837
and the war with Mexico (1846–1848), which ab-
sorbed the energy of young combatants from the
cities in a united war against Mexico.

During the antebellum years, the groundwork for
modern policing, prisons, parole and probation, and
indeterminate sentencing were established. By the
1850s, small and large cities were legislating the night
watch out of existence in favor of organized police
forces. While their establishment did not solve all the
social problems of antebellum America, urban policing
began to play an integral role in maintaining order,
preventing crime, and regulating public morality.
Measured by its financial successes, the Auburn
system of silent confinement clearly triumphed over
the solitary Pennsylvania system. One of the more
important developments of the antebellum era was
that an increasing number of prison inmates came
from the new immigrant classes, especially the Irish.
This pattern would continue from the 1830s through
the 1870s.
As urban rioting continued to wreak havoc on
northeastern cities, sectional violence proceeded to
spread farther west following the war with Mexico
and the crisis over the Kansas–Nebraska territory. It
was not long before guerrilla warfare broke out in
this region and the nation was preparing for war.
With the Civil War on the horizon, the great strides
in criminal justice experimentation and reform
would suddenly become a lower priority until the
reconstruction of the Union after 1865.
Point–Counterpoint
Keeping the Peace: Vigilantes and Police Officers
(1844, 1851)
The creation of the London Metropolitan Police Department
in 1829 was a major step in the transition from medieval to
modern law enforcement. It would be decades before this
experiment would bear much fruit in America. The best labo-
ratories for this experiment were the crowded eastern cities beset
by urbanization and immigration. It is no wonder then that
New York City passed a police bill in 1844 that would lead to
the creation of the New York City Police Department the
following year. That same year there was barely a handful of
Anglo settlers in San Francisco (then called Yerba Buena).
The discovery of gold in 1848 and the subsequent avalanche
of gold seekers led to rampant lawlessness in San Francisco
and its environs. San Francisco would not have the time to
make the transition from town to city since it became an urban
center virtually overnight. The problem that was experienced
in San Francisco was typical for regions where people settled
in advance of police, courts, and other formal institutions of
social control. In 1851 the San Francisco Vigilance was con-
vened to restore order. It was composed of city merchants and
other prosperous types that had the most to lose. The following
passages include a document detailing the composition of the
prospective 24-hour police force and then the Constitution of
the San Francisco Vigilance Committee.
§ 1. The Mayor of the City of New York is, and shall
continue to be, the Chief Magistrate and head of
all the Police of the said City, with all the powers
conferred on him and now exercised by law.
§ 2. In each of the Wards of the City of New-
York there shall be appointed, by the Mayor of the
said City, the following number of persons to be
Policemen, that is to say: 988.
§ 3. To entitle any person to be appointed such
Policeman, he shall, previous to his appointed, have
been a house-keeper and resident of the ward for
which he shall be appointed, at least one year; shall
be a person of approved discretion, integrity,
courage and moral character.
§ 9. The said Captains, Sub-Captains and Po-
licemen shall dress in respectable citizen’s dress in the
day-time, and in the night with the usual watchman’s
cap, and the only weapon which they shall use when
required shall be the usual watchman’s club; they
shall be known in the day-time by some proper
badge, to be designated for that purpose.
§ 10. The said Captains and Assistant Captains
shall, within their districts, do all the duties, as well
by day as by night, that are now done by the
Captains and Assistant Captains of the Watch in the
night time, and the duties done by Foremen of
engines and Engineers; shall vigilantly see that the
duties of the subordinate Policemen are well per-
formed, and in addition shall do all the duties
hereinafter mentioned.

§ 13. The duties of the said Sectionmen shall be
both night and day, similar to the duties which are
now performed by the Roundsmen and Patrolmen
of the Watch at night; they shall, while on duty, be
constantly patroling their section, and see that good
order is observed, and the laws enforced; and shall
perform such other duties as shall be prescribed by
the rules and regulations to be established by the
Board of Police.
§ 17. The two-thirds of the force not on duty
shall be the reserve, from which, from time to time,
and in due and proportionate succession, shall be
detailed, by the Captain of the Ward, a sufficient
number to act as Firemen, to proceed with the
Engines and Hook and Ladders to the fires, on
which occasion they shall wear a fire cap and suit of
fire clothes; and another sufficient number shall be
detailed to attend at all public landings, theatres,
and such other duties as the said Captains, Super-
intendent or the Mayor may direct; and when any
of such reserve force shall not be required to be on
any duty, they may abide and remain at their places
of residence till their presence shall be required.
§ 18. In case of sickness or accident to any
Policeman, by which he shall be rendered unable to
attend to his duties, the Captain of the Ward to
which he may be attached, may, if he deem it
necessary, employ a substitute in his place, during
his inability to do duty; such inability to be certified
daily by a licensed Physician; and in case of any
falsehood or fraud, in making or procuring such
certificate, all parties concerned therein shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.
§ 19. In all cases when a portion of the force shall
be required to proceed to a fire, or to repress a riot, at
least one Captain or one Sub-captain, a proper
number of Sectionmen, and the required number of
Policemen shall proceed to the scene of action; and, if
occasion requires, additional force shall be added, and
if needful, all the reserved force, and a part, or all of
the force on duty, may be employed.
§ 20.There shall be a regular and systematic
arrangement of signals for fires and riots, by which
the whole Police force may be promptly apprised of
the place of fire or riot, and what portion of the
force is required; it shall be the duty of the
Policemen detailed for that purpose, from time to
time, to ring the bells and give such other signals as
may be agreed on.
§ 21. It shall also be the duty of such of the
Policemen as shall be detailed for the purpose, from
time to time, to keep the Engines, Hose Cart and
Hooks and Ladders, and apparatus attached thereto,
in good order.
§ 22. The horses, or any of them, provided for
the Engines or Hook and Ladder Trucks may,
when not on actual duty, in proceeding to the fire,
be employed on general patrol, or other duty to
which they can usefully be employed for the ben-
efit of the Police.
THE SAN FRANCISCO VIGILANCE
COMMITTEE, 1851
Constitution of the San Francisco Vigilance Committee
Instituted the Eighth of June 1851
Whereas it has become apparent to the citizens of San
Francisco that there is no security for life and prop-
erty, either under the regulations of society as it at
present exists or under the laws as now administered,
therefore the citizens whose names are hereunto at-
tached do unite themselves into an association for
the maintenance of the peace and good order of so-
ciety and the preservation of the lives and property of
the citizens of San Francisco and do bind themselves
each unto the other to do and perform every lawful
act for the maintenance of law and order and to sus-
tain the laws when faithfully and properly adminis-
tered but we are determined that no thief, burglar,
incendiary assassin, professed gambler, and other dis-
turbers of the peace shall escape punishment either by
the quibbles of the law, the insecurity of prisons, the
carelessness or corruption of the police, or a laxity of
those who pretend to administer justice.
And to secure the objects of this association we
do hereby agree:
First, that the name and style of the association
shall be the “Committee of Vigilance” for the pro-
tection of the lives and property of the citizens and
residents of the City of San Francisco.

Secondly, that there shall be a room selected for
the meeting and deliberations of the Committee at
which there shall be some one or more members of
the Committee appointed for that purpose in constant
attendance at all hours of the day and night to receive
the report of any member of the association or of any
other person or persons whatsoever of any act of vio-
lence done to the person or property of any citizen of
San Francisco and if in the judgement of the member
or members of the Committee present it be such an
act as justifies the interference of this Committee ei-
ther in aiding in the execution of the laws or the
prompt and summary punishment of the offender
the Committee shall be at once assembled for the
purpose of taking such action as a majority of the
Committee when assembled shall determine upon.
Thirdly, that it shall be the duty of any member
or members of the Committee on duty at the
Committee room whenever a general assemblage
of the Committee is deemed necessary to cause a
call to be made by two strokes upon a bell.
Fourthly, that when the Committee have as-
sembled for action the decision of a majority pres-
ent shall be binding upon the whole Committee
and that those members of the Committee pledge
their honor and hereby bind themselves to defend
and sustain each other in carrying out the deter-
mined action of this Committee at the hazard of
their lives and their fortunes.
Fifthly, that there shall be chosen monthly a
President, Secretary, and Treasurer and it shall be
the duty of the Secretary to detail the members
required to be in daily attendance at the Commit-
tee room. A Sergeant-at-Arms shall be appointed
whose duty it shall be to notify such members of
their detail for duty. The Sergeant-at-Arms shall
reside at and be in constant attendance at the
Committee room.

6. There is some disagreement here as to the actual
origins of the term copper. Its earliest application as a
synonym for police officer appeared in George
Matsell’s 1859 work “A Hundred Stretches Hence.”
Some sources trace the shortened version cop to
1846 and to the books of Horatio Alger in the
1860s. Outside of Augustine Costello’s Our Police
Protectors (1885), there is little or no substantiation
that the word cop was used earlier than the 1850s.

The years leading up to the Civil War brought numer-
ous critical issues dividing the nation into sharp focus,
includingslaveryversusfreelabor,popularsovereignty,
and the legal and political status of African Americans.
The decade of the 1850switnessed unparalleled urban-
ization, heralding an era from 1860 to 1900 when city
dwellers would increase from 6 million to 30 million.
Whether the interior cities of St. Louis, Cleveland,
Chicago, and Milwaukee or eastern urban centers
such as New York City and Philadelphia, all shared
the rapid growth and wealth of the Industrial Revolu-
tion. But they would also share an equally dark side,
onethatwascharacterizedbyracialandethnictensions,
poverty, and an outmanned and outdated criminal jus-
tice system still playing catch-up. As sectional matters
came to the fore in the 1850s, temperance reform lea-
ders turned their attention to the impending sectional
conflict.Popularinterest inthe crusade against“demon
rum” waned as the Dred Scott case, “Bleeding Kansas,”
and John Brown’s raid on Harper’s Ferry dominated
the day’s concerns.
The Civil War years witnessed the greatest car-
nage in American history and ended with probably
the most famous murder of the nineteenth century:
the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln at
Ford’s Theater less than two weeks after the con-
clusion of the war. At the time of his murder,
Lincoln was far from the respected figure that recent
historians have proclaimed as the country’s greatest
president. Lincoln’s unpopularity in the South was
well known, but the loathing reserved for the presi-
dent in the North has been given less coverage in
history texts. Indeed, throughout the war years, his
policies came under attack from all directions.
Growing opposition to the war led Lincoln to sus-
pend the constitutionally guaranteed writ of habeas
corpus and authorize the arrest of hundreds of indi-
viduals for antiwar activities. His implementation by
executive order of a conscription bill over the objec-
tions of Congress in 1862 helped precipitate riots in
many cities, including the New York City draft riot
of 1863, the bloodiest in American history.
As Lincoln’s first term came to a close, he had
infuriated Congress and was thought to have violated
the Constitution by issuing executive orders creating
provisional courts in conquered southern states and by
installing military governors in Arkansas, Louisiana,
and Tennessee without apparent constitutional au-
thority or the approval of Congress. By the end of
1864, Lincoln’s support had dwindled as antagonists
opposing emancipation, resistance to the draft, and
strong criticism against the manner in which the war
was being waged began to take its toll on his adminis-
tration. This would become the historical context

that would lead John Wilkes Booth to take the life of
perhaps America’s greatest leader in 1865.
Historian James G. Randall described the Civil
War as an “eccentric period” in American history,
“a period when specious arguments and legal fic-
tions were put forth to excuse extraordinary mea-
sures. It was a period during which the line was
blurred between executive, legislative, and judicial
functions; between state and federal powers; and
between military and civil procedures.”1 Until this
era, the American judicial system had never faced a
precedent for such a crisis as the Civil War.
While the developing cities earned a reputation
for criminality and tested the developing criminal
justice system, the defeated South also presented
considerable obstacles in a region that had lagged
far behind the rest of the nation in modernizing
its criminal justice mechanisms. As Congress at-
tempted to reconstruct the 11 former Confederate
states, white supremacists swept through the night,
terrorizing black communities and anyone who fa-
vored the transition to the post-slaveholding era.
TH E LAWGI VERS
One of the most important criminal justice issues to
come up during the Civil War years was whether a
state of war suspended the liberties guaranteed by
the U.S. Constitution. Following the opening shots
of the Civil War at Fort Sumter, Lincoln and his
cabinet made the preservation of what was left of
the Union its highest priority. Cognizant that sup-
port for the Union cause was far from unanimous in
the North, the Lincoln administration set up a strat-
egy for dealing with opposition to the war. With
members of Congress, the courts, and even the
army and the government suspected of sympathizing
with the South, it became paramount to maintain
loyalties to the Union cause.
The Civil War era would see a sustained attack
on constitutional liberties of freedom of speech and
freedom of the press. In perhaps the greatest attack
on individual liberties in American history, Presi-
dent Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus
from areas where secession seemed imminent in
1861 to the entire country.
To justify his actions Lincoln cited article 1,
section 9 of the Constitution, which said, “The
privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not
be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion
or Invasion the public safety may require it.” Mary-
land, a border state with a large secessionist popula-
tion, was the first state to feel the wrath of the new
policy in May 1861, when several prominent state
officials were “arbitrarily” arrested and imprisoned
by military authorities. It was not long before a
leading southern agitator who had been arrested
provided the first test case for Lincoln’s strategy.
The last important case heard by the 84-year-old
Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney involved a
wealthy Baltimore citizen named John Merryman.
In Ex parte Merryman, Taney ruled that only the
legislative branch had the power to suspend the
writ of habeas corpus and that “if the President of
the United States may suspend the writ then the
Constitution has conferred upon him more regal
and absolute power over the liberty of the citizen
than the people of England have thought its safe to
entrust to the Crown,” alluding to the fact that only
Parliament had similar power.
While Taney had his defenders and may have
been correct in his interpretation of the law, many
saw him as taking sides with traitors. As the situa-
tion in Maryland abated, Merryman was eventually
released. Many subsequent cases would follow a
similar pattern. Individuals would be arrested on
little pretext for threatening national security. After
a period of time when the threat seemed to pass,
the prisoners were released.
Several days after the promulgation of the Eman-
cipation Proclamation in September 1862, Lincoln
proclaimed, “During the existing insurrection … all
rebels and insurgents, their aiders and abettors, within
the United States, and all persons discouraging vol-
untary enlistments, resisting military drafts, or guilty
of disloyal practices … shall be subject to martial law
and liable to trials and punishments by courts martial
or military commission.” In addition, “the writ of
habeas corpus” was suspended “in respect to all persons
arrested” by military authority. On September 15,

1863, Lincoln suspended the writ for the duration of
the war.
Throughout the Civil War, thousands of indi-
viduals were arrested by the military authorities at
the direction of Secretary of State Seward and Sec-
retary of War Stanton. But Lincoln historian David
Herbert Donald suggests that “only a few were
truly political prisoners,” until more teeth were
put into the proclamations in 1863.2 Until then,
the majority of those arrested were spies, smugglers,
foreign nationals, and blockade runners. While re-
searching arrests for this period in National Archive
records, historian Mark E. Neely Jr. found many
more arrests than earlier researchers but also discov-
ered that most had “less significance in the history
of civil liberties than anyone ever imagined.”3
Although Taney would not live to see it, his
position on the habeas corpus issue was upheld in
1866 in the Ex Parte Milligan decision, which vin-
dicated his interpretation of the Constitution. Ac-
cording to the Milligan decision, Congress had no
authority to establish military commissions and ru-
led that the Constitution could not “be suspended
during any of the great exigencies of government.
Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy and
despotism.” Commenting on the case in the next
century, Chief Justice Earl Warren noted that the
case “established firmly the principle that when civil
courts are open and operating resort to military tribu-
nals for the prosecution of civilians is impermissible.”
As the only president to suspend the writ of habeas
corpus, Lincoln has drawn fire from Civil War scho-
lars. However, recent research suggests that his
actions were well-intentioned attempts to deal with
an unprecedented crisis and to conduct the war more
efficiently. Although the system of military justice was
deeply flawed and abuses of power did take place,
Lincoln’s actions must be viewed in the context of
the time.
Black Codes
Following the Civil War, white legislators in the
southern states instituted “black codes” to replace
the old slave codes, and slave patrols returned to
police the rural countryside. To the informed, the
new freedom looked suspiciously like the old slav-
ery. Unable to hold office, vote, or speak to whites,
former slaves were required to be employed by
whites and could not change jobs without permis-
sion, were prohibited from intermarrying with
whites, and were barred from carrying weapons
even for self-protection. Unemployed blacks and
orphaned children could be arrested for vagrancy
and then assigned to work without pay. Black
codes, which attempted to uphold the old racial
order in the South, radicalized Congress and led
congressional Republicans to try to seize control
of Reconstruction policies from President Andrew
Johnson.
There had been a long tradition of “hiring
out” free blacks who did not pay taxes or failed
to pay fines. The practice of temporary enslave-
ment of free blacks existed years before the Civil
War. During the 1830s, any black unable or un-
willing to pay a fine in Florida could be offered for
public sale by the sheriff. North Carolina extended
the maximum time for hiring out to more than
one year simply for siring a son outside wedlock.
Several slave states had prewar laws that provided
that if a free black was hired but left before the
expiration of the contract with the employer
“without reasonable cause,” he could be charged
with a misdemeanor.
One historian has suggested that post–Civil
War black codes were not imposed as an attempt
to reinstate slavery but rather were the result of
southern officials “trying to erect a legal structure
that would permit the economic exploitation” of
blacks by granting “them technical freedom.”4
However, any reading of individual state black
codes suggests an attempt to return to the
pre–Civil War status quo.

lawful for any freedman, free Negro, or mulatto to in-
termarry with any white person; nor for any white person

any person who shall intermarry shall be deemed guilty
of felony and, on conviction thereof, shall be confined
in the state penitentiary for life.…

Section 7. Be it further enacted, That every civil
officer shall, and every person may, arrest and carry

the place of arrest to the place of delivery, and the
same shall be paid by the employer, and held as a

employee.

made by the employer of any freedman, free Negro, or
mulatto, or other credible person, before any justice of

freedman, free Negro, or mulatto, legally employed by
said employer, has illegally deserted said employment,
such justice of the peace or member of the board of
police shall issue his warrant or warrants, returnable
before himself, or other such officer, directed to any
sheriff, constable, or special deputy, commanding him
to arrest said deserter and return him or her to said
employer, and the like proceedings shall be had as
provided in the preceding section.5
Civil Rights Legislation
and Due Process
The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment abolish-
ing slavery in 1865 and then the Fourteenth
Amendment in 1868 providing blacks with citizen-
ship and equal protection under the law represented
great strides in the nationalization of civil rights.
According to the Fourteenth Amendment, no per-
son may be deprived of life, liberty, or property
without “due process of law,” and all persons are
to have equal protection of the laws.
In an attempt to disenfranchise the new citizens,
white supremacist organizations such as the Ku Klux
Klan waged a campaign of terror against blacks trying
to exercise their rights, and southern states enacted
black codes in an attempt to impose second-class citi-
zenship on former slaves. Congress responded with
various measures intended to protect the black popu-
lation. Foremost among these was the Fifteenth
Amendment, which specifically proclaimed that the
right to vote should not be denied by reason of race,
color, or previous condition of servitude. However,
constitutional amendments did not apply to women;
therefore,female formerslaveswerenotcoveredby the
Fifteenth Amendment.
Other civil rights acts followed, including the
Act to Enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, bet-
ter known as the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871. This
legislation outlawed conspiracies to deprive citi-
zens of their voting rights. That same year, Presi-
dent Ulysses Grant declared martial law in parts of
South Carolina, where the Klan was waging a
terror campaign. The Supreme Court would
strike down various sections of the civil rights
legislation, but following the suppression of the
Klan, federal protection of civil rights gradually
diminished. The passage of the 1875 Civil Rights
Act would prohibit discrimination by hotels, rail-
roads, and other public facilities. But this law
proved a last hurrah for civil rights protection. It
too would be repudiated when in 1883 the
Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional, signal-
ing a new era of disenfranchisement for African
Americans.
Birth of Drug Legislation
While social reformers concentrated on alcohol abuse
in the nineteenth century, the United States had been
plagued by a “drug problem” for decades. Drug his-
torian H. Wayne Morgan suggests that the “public
remained uninformed about it” until the communi-
cation advances of the late 1860s.6 Indeed, the public
paid little attention to drug addiction as long as it took
place among the more marginalized segment of the
population. When changing patterns of addiction in
the 1870s introduced narcotics to the mainstream
population, social and health reformers weighed in
with dire predictions and warnings.
The nineteenth century saw the onset of a drug
addiction problem in America beginning in the late
1840s with Chinese immigrants who popularized the
smoking of opium in the mining towns of gold rush
California and then with the wide availability of
morphine products in the 1850s. The introduction

of the hypodermic needle in 1856 offered a way of
injecting morphine directly into the bloodstream.7
The use of morphine rose dramatically during the
Civil War period, when it was used intravenously
to treat battlefield casualties. Following the war,
many ex-soldiers brought the “army disease” of
morphine addiction home with them. Other factors
for the growing morphine addiction problem re-
sulted from the mass marketing of patent medicines
that contained narcotics as well as the psychological
trauma of the Civil War.
During the Reconstruction years, morphine
was cheaper than alcohol and was widely available.
Prior to the acknowledgment of the disease of ad-
diction, doctors prescribed cheap morphine for many
common complaints, leading to a substantial popu-
lation of addicts. While there is no way to ascertain
the number of drug addicts in Reconstruction-era
America, a researcher in 1868 estimated that 80,000
to 100,000 Americans were addicted to opium.8
After the California gold mines were played
out and the transcontinental railroad was com-
pleted, many Chinese immigrants clustered in
the cities and Chinatowns along the Pacific
coast. The commencement of an economic de-
pression in California in 1875 indirectly led to
one of America’s earliest drug prohibition laws.
The high unemployment and deterioration of
living standards among
the
working classes
brought the weight of bad times disproportion-
ately onto the Chinese. As Chinese immigrants
continued to come to California, they became
the target of white frustration and despair over
declining economic prospects. Into the 1870s,
Anglo-Californians saw the close-knit, insular
Chinese as hopelessly different and unassimila-
tive. Sensational reports of Chinese prostitution
and opium use fed the anti-Chinese sentiments
of the era.
In 1875, San Francisco passed the first antidrug
law in the United States when it prohibited the
continued operation of opium dens, which were
linked to vice and the mingling of white and
Chinese users, a combination linked to moral
degradation. Similar conditions in other parts of
the West would lead to comparable anti-Chinese
legislation and outright violence over the next two
decades.
LAW ENFORCEMENT
Between 1845 and 1865, major American cities estab-
lished more proficient police forces that emphasized
prevention over detection. As early as the 1850s, cities
such as New York could boast uniformed police on
the London model, while in other regions fears of a
standing army led to informal vigilante groups, partic-
ularly in the trans-Mississippi West after 1850. While
there is little disagreement that a breakdown in social
order caused by immigration and urbanization con-
tributed to the development of policing in urban
America, historians such as Eric Monkkonnen main-
tained that the creation of urban police forces was
an attempt by municipal authorities to first control
the “dangerous classes” and then to more efficiently
manage their cities. He cites similar reform goals
in the improvement of fire and sanitation departments
in the same era.9 Refuting the notion that modern
police forces developed in response to rioting and
rising crime rates, Monkkonnen argued that if
this were the case, then those cities that experienced
neither problem would not have established such
forces.
The development of modern urban police was
a slow process, one that occurred gradually in most
American cities. Initially, the new police force used
a syncretic approach that assimilated part of the old
watch system before making the transition to totally
new strategies. By 1855, Chicago had adopted a
police system similar to New York City, followed
by New Orleans and Cincinnati (1852), Philadelphia
(1855), St. Louis (1856), Newark and Baltimore
(1857), Detroit (1865), and Buffalo (1866).10
With few cities having established uniformed
police forces by 1860, the traditional militia was still
relied on by urban areas without professional po-
lice. While many police carried firearms informally,
it would be decades before it was sanctioned by law
in most cities.

To prevent the police from becoming separate
and remote from the citizens they served, efforts
were made in some cities to ensure that the early
police were members of the community by imple-
menting residency requirements. As immigration
politics became inextricably linked with policing
in cities such as New York and Boston, Irish and
Irish Americans became the most common ethno-
cultural group in mid-nineteenth-century police
forces. Cities as diverse as New York and New
Orleans could claim to have a disproportionate
number of Irish police on their forces. This can
be best explained by the Irish predilection for par-
tisan politics and the spoils system that went along
with it. Although large numbers of German immi-
grants lived in the same cities, being better capital-
ized and educated than the Irish, they did not
develop the same political organization at the
ward level and remained underrepresented on the
police forces.
While the London model of policing inspired
many American police forces, it was seldom imitated
because of the inherent differences in the two socie-
ties. In England, police officers were recruited from
the military and laborers on the fringe of London.
After joining the force, officers accepted the restric-
tion of many personal liberties. Married officers were
not allowed in certain parts of town, while bachelors
were assigned to barracks. Barred from voting,
London bobbies were ultimately responsible to
Parliament rather than their local constituents. On
the other hand, the exigencies of the American
system would never permit such restrictions of indi-
vidual liberties, for, as the police historian Roger
Lane concluded, “it was impossible in the United
States to adopt the London personnel polices.”11
Police reform was slowed in many regions by
the Civil War and Reconstruction. No region of
the country was more affected by the war in terms
of police reform than the South. In 1861, when
New Orleans was captured by Union forces, the
civil government was disbanded and replaced by
martial law. With the military taking on police
duties, police experimentation, which had become
a hallmark of southern police reform, had ended.
Although steps had been taken toward creating a
professional police force in New Orleans prior to
the Civil War, it would take until 1898 for the
establishment of such a force.
In the West, law enforcement was inadequate
for much of the nineteenth century. To contend
with
rising
crime
rates,
some
western
states
and territories authorized anti–horse thief associa-
tions, detecting societies, and vigilante groups.
However, the locus of policing was typically near
the county seat, town, or township. Underfinanced
communities could ill afford to support constables,
policemen, and sheriffs in the distant pursuit of out-
laws. The additional expenditures required for cap-
turing, trying, jailing, and sentencing could bankrupt
the prototypical frontier community. Although the
advent of the railroad helped transport desperadoes
back to justice, law enforcement was hampered by
the fixed routes of the train lines and was forced
once more on horseback to navigate the patchwork
of barely recognizable trails back to “civilization.”
One of the more unexpected consequences of
the Civil War was the decline of the U.S. militia.
First used for federal peacekeeping in 1794, this an-
cient English tradition was transplanted to America in
an era when citizen soldiers were needed to maintain
order in the days before a standing army. At the
outbreak of the American Revolution, the volunteer
militia was initially the only military force at the dis-
posal of the colonists. However, “a dozen years after
the Civil War the United States militia had reached
its nadir.”12 Explanations for the decline of the militia
vary. According to historian Robert Reinders, the
decline in urban riots after the Civil War and an
increasingly more professional police apparatus best
explain the phenomenon. Others have suggested
that the war had bred an “antimilitaristic attitude”
that discouraged volunteer military service.13 While
the changing nature of urban criminal violence may
have indeed led to the decline of the militia, indus-
trial disorder and strikes beginning in the late 1870s
would stimulate the return of the militia.
While few records indicate the presence of
black police officers in America between 1850 and
the 1870s, historians have uncovered black police

officers in northern cities beginning in the 1870s and
more notably in Midwestern cities such as Chicago
and Cincinnati. During the Reconstruction era,
three out of five police commissioners were black,
and one-third of the police in New Orleans were
African American. But this would turn out to be an
ephemeral development in the postwar South.
Urban Policing
While the New York City police had copied many
of London’s police model characteristics, including
the adoption of uniforms, there were still important
differences between the two forces. Not only were
London police officers more inclined to military
discipline, but they also policed a more orderly so-
ciety. The New York City police faced many more
obstacles, in part because of the dearth of police
officers. In 1856, the New York City police had
one officer for every 812.5 citizens compared to
London’s one for every 351.5.14
One of the recurring problems of nineteenth-
century American policing was the influence of par-
tisanship, which allowed the police to control the
election machinery. Nowhere was this better exem-
plified than in the debate over city versus state con-
trol of the New York City police between 1857 and
1870. According to Roger Lane, one of the spheres
in which American policing sought to imitate its
British counterpart was by “transferring the direction
of the police from city to state, especially in a period
of rising tensions.”15 In 1857, the New York Met-
ropolitan Police Law transferred control of the New
York City police to state officials, citing the reluc-
tance of Mayor Fernando Wood to suppress the vice
problem and his unwillingness to enforce the 1855
Prohibition law. However, Wood defied state offi-
cials by having the city council adopt an ordinance
creating a municipal police force based on the London
model. Thus, for a short time New York residents
were confounded by the presence of two police
forces. Tension escalated between the rival forces,cul-
minating in a riot between the two in 1857 in which
the metropolitans (supported by the state) were
routed by the municipals. When the state court of
appeals ruled in favor of the new police law, Wood
disbanded the municipal force. New York police
control was finally returned to the city in 1870.
Following New York’s example, other urban
police forces came under state control for various
time periods in the nineteenth century, including
those in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati,
Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis, Kansas City, New
Orleans, Omaha, St. Louis and San Francisco. Ac-
cording to police historian James Richardson, this
phenomenon typically occurred where there were
“significant social and political differences between
the cities and their states.” These cities were more
likely “to be more cosmopolitan and pluralistic” and
more predisposed to prostitution, gambling, and
liquor. Moreover, these cities were typically domi-
nated by a different political party than the state
legislature.16
Federal Law Enforcement
During the Civil War, U.S. marshals were con-
cerned mainly with arresting suspected traitors and
Confederate sympathizers. Their role in supporting
Lincoln’s suspension of the writ of habeas corpus
made the marshals a subject of scorn in many quar-
ters. The passage of confiscation acts in 1861 and
1862 enlarged the marshals’ powers to include con-
fiscating the personal property of those accused of
supporting the South. The government power to
confiscate would not be taken away until 1868.
Following the war, marshals were confronted
with protecting recently freed slaves and helping
re-impose authority in the South. Ku Klux Klan
groupsand other white supremacists spread their cam-
paign of terror across much of the South in defiance of
the Civil Rights Act of 1866. During the early 1870s,
southerners directed their efforts at regaining political
control of their states. Marshals found themselves in
the center of the struggle, as they were charged with
supervising polling places and protecting politically
active blacks from white violence. Supported by fed-
eral troops, marshals arrested almost 7,000 southerners
for violating civil rights laws by 1877.

Perhaps the greatest development in federal law
enforcement, the formation of the U.S. Secret Ser-
vice in 1865, was a last-gasp attempt to deal with
the longstanding counterfeiting problem. On April
14, 1865, the day of his assassination, Abraham
Lincoln gave his approval for the formation of
what would become the U.S. Secret Service. In
1863, the federal government began issuing its
own currency. Prior to this time, more than 1,600
American banks printed and designed currency as
part of a money system in which each state released
its own bank notes through private banks. Indeed,
this system created a counterfeiter’s paradise since
merchants and businessmen were oblivious to differ-
ences between legitimate and counterfeit currency.
At the behest of the secretary of the treasury, Lincoln
approved the Secret Service as a division of his
department.
It has been estimated that anywhere between
one-third to one-half of the country’s paper money
was illegal during the Civil War years. Chosen to
lead the new federal law enforcement organization
was William P. Wood, a veteran of the war with
Mexico.
Born in 1819, William P. Wood served as superintendent
of Washington’s Old Capitol Prison in 1862 and was
suspected of participating in all manner of intrigue
and espionage during the war years. In 1864, he
focused on the counterfeiting problem, taking advan-
tage of his prison contacts in the federal prison popu-
lation. However, the Secret Service was not authorized
by Congress like the Customs Service, postal inspectors,
and Internal Revenue Service. In a more clandestine
departure from protocol, Wood was sworn in by
executive decision on July 5, 1865, in a private
ceremony.
During its first year of operation, the Secret
Service established field offices in 11 different cities
and arrested more than 200 counterfeiters. The new
branch of federal law enforcement has been cred-
ited with establishing a measure of monetary stabil-
ity in the decade following the war. However, it
would take two more presidential assassinations
(Garfield in 1881 and McKinley in 1901) before
the Secret Service was officially responsible for pres-
idential protection in 1901.
Other federal law enforcement efforts for this
era included the congressional creation of the Of-
fice of Internal Revenue, which was authorized on
July 1, 1862. Its main function was the enforcement
of the federal taxation of distilled spirits. The origins
of the Internal Revenue Service and the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms can be traced back
to this office.
State Policing
Throughout most of the nineteenth century, there was
little support for state policing. Americans favored de-
centralization of policing in an era that placed consid-
erable value on a republican ideology that favored local
control of policing. Massachusetts was the only state
besides Texas to experiment with state policing in the
nineteenth century. Beginning in 1865, Massachusetts
embarked on a series of state police experiments that
did not lead to a permanent force until the following
century. In 1865, the state legislature passed a statute
that created a state police organization comprised of
close to 20 officers. According to the law, the governor
was given the power to select a chief constable who
would direct a force composed of all state constables
and their deputies. The nascent “state police” was man-
dated to maintain peace and order and prevent crime
by controlling vice establishments, such as brothels,
taverns, and gambling establishments. The force was
given police powers throughout the state.
The “state police” was reorganized several
times over the next 15 years. In 1875, it was trans-
formed into a “state detective force” of 30 men
under the direction of a chief detective chosen by
the governor. Within five years, the “state detec-
tives” were transformed into the “district police,”
again under the supervision of a chief appointed by
the governor. Throughout the various incarnations
of the force, its powers and duties remained fairly
consistent and focused most of its attention on en-
forcing liquor laws. Following World War I, the
Massachusetts State Police would be reorganized
as a modern state police force.17

Private Detectives
In 1846, the Boston Police Department created the
first municipal detective division. New York fol-
lowed with a similar division in 1857 and Philadelphia
two years later. Subsequent scandals would reveal
that like Britain’s early thief takers, these detectives
did little more than collect payoffs from amicable
criminals and arrest those who failed to pay tribute.
By the 1860s, municipal crime detection had been
placed in the hands of private detectives, many of
whom had former investigative experience.
The foremost detective agency of the nine-
teenth century was the Pinkertons, brainchild of
Scottish immigrant Allan Pinkerton. Initially in-
volved in railroad security, Pinkerton came to the
attention of railroad lawyer Abraham Lincoln in the
1850s. Their chance meeting perhaps allowed
Lincoln to survive to repeat the presidential oath
in 1861. Pinkerton apparently stumbled on a plot
to kill Lincoln as he passed through Maryland on
his way to take office in the nation’s capital. Inter-
ceding on the president-elect’s behalf, Pinkerton
convinced Lincoln not to leave the train in Balti-
more. In 1861, Pinkerton was selected by the com-
manding Union general McClellan to lead the
intelligence branch at the start of the Civil War.
Despite the reservations of former government
detective Lafayette C. Baker, who noted that a de-
tective bureau was “contrary to the spirit of …
Republican institutions in time of peace,” Pinkerton
saw the lawlessness that punctuated the postwar
years as an opportunity for earning new accolades.
During the two decades following hostilities, the
Pinkertons pursued (not always successfully) a virtual
who’s who of outlaw gangs, ranging from the Reno
brothers in 1865–1866 to the James–Younger gang
in the 1870s.
In the unorganized western territories, which
had not yet made the transition to statehood, only
federal law applied, leaving U.S. marshals as virtually
the only law enforcement presence. In territories
ranging from Wyoming to Arizona and New
Mexico, all the governors, judges, and other officials
were appointed by the president. When a territory
reached 5,000 free white males, a bicameral legisla-
ture could be elected and laws promulgated. When
the territory reached 60,000, it could be nominated
for statehood (and then had to be approved by Con-
gress). The position of U.S. marshal reflected the role
of the federal courts. Since all criminal activities were
viewed as a breech in federal law, marshals pursued a
wide array of malefactors. But as the territory made
the transition to statehood, the marshals saw other
territorial lawmen take over their duties. As the ter-
ritory came closer to statehood, federal marshals con-
centrated specifically on federal laws, while territorial
laws were enforced by territorial county sheriffs.
CORRECTIONS
According to the federal census of 1860, the na-
tional prison population stood at 19,086. However,
this figure increased by 72% to 32,901 in 1870,
reflecting the social discord and disorganization that
typically followed a war. By the late 1860s, prison
overcrowding was an increasing concern. The sud-
den increase of the prison population after the war
and a growing opposition to prison industries
brought prison conditions to the attention of the
public. In response, new institutions were built, and
stimulus was given to the “reformatory” movement,
an experiment in prison reform that emphasized ed-
ucation, trade training, a mark system, indeterminate
sentencing, and parole. Building on the achieve-
ments of Captain Alexander Maconochie in Australia
and Walter Crofton in Ireland, American reforma-
tories attempted to make the transition from punitive
programs to programs more reformative in nature.
According to prison historian Mark T. Carleton,
the end of the Civil War was the “most decisive event
in the history of southern penology.”18 With the end
of hostilities, half the southern population made
the transition from slavery to freedom in a region of
the country where many jails and penitentiaries had
been destroyed in the war.
Prior to the war, slaves who broke the law
were punished on the plantation, but after 1865

new arrangements had to be made. The southern
infrastructure had been destroyed during the war,
and outside of prison units in several states, what
little was available in the way of prison space was
primitive in nature since the war had wiped out the
beginnings of the penitentiary system in most states.
Unprepared to handle the formidable expenses of
social control by utilization of the penitentiary,
southern legislatures were attracted by a cheaper
alternative: convict leasing.
Convict Leasing
Unable to pay and care for the burgeoning number
of prisoners following the Civil War, southern states
experimented with a system of convict leasing that
allowed prison contractors to utilize cheap prisoner
labor for an assortment of projects, including levee
and railroad construction as well as agricultural
work. During the 1870s and 1880s, the convict
leasing system would dominate southern penology.
Two different types of leasing evolved. Under the
terms of the contract system, prisoners worked be-
hind prison walls and were fed, clothed, and
guarded by prison authorities. Therefore, the lessor
was only hiring the labor of the convicts behind
prison walls. This system flourished in South
Carolina, Texas, and Virginia by the 1880s. Other
southern states and several outside the region used
the lease system, in which prisoner labor was hired
to work outside the confines of the prison structure.
American Prison Congress
Few Americans voiced concerns for prison condi-
tions in 1865. The end of the Civil War and the onset
of Reconstruction consumed the interest of most
citizens, who had witnessed the bloodiest decade in
American history. Public indifference to prison con-
ditions ended in 1865 after prison reformers Enoch
Wines (1806–1879) and Theodore Dwight publi-
cized the deplorable state of several penitentiaries
and reformatories they visited in the Northeast.
Their tour of prisons was chronicled and then pub-
lished in 70 volumes as the Report on the Prisons and
Reformatories of the United States and Canada in 1867.
Their conclusions offered several revealing sta-
tistics about the impact of the Civil War on the
prison population. They noted that the number of
male prisoners declined in state prisons anywhere
from 10% to 50%. One explanation for this was
that criminals often found refuge in the army dur-
ing the war and that prison sentences were shorter
in wartime. According to Wines and Dwight, the
war also saw an increase in the imprisonment of
women and minors. However, the years following
the war saw a rapid increase in male prisoners and a
general decline in female commitments.
Among their most fervent recommendations
was the adoption of Sir Walter Crofton’s “Irish
system.” This system was comprised of a series of
graded prison stages. In the first phase, the convict
spent two years in solitary confinement, followed
by a period of congregate labor that would deter-
mine the prisoner’s date of release and that would
eventually earn a “ticket of release” during which
the individual’s progress on the outside would be
monitored.
Wines soon envisioned the creation of a world
organization in which all nations would come to-
gether to establish an ideal prison system. As a first
step in this mission, Wines played a crucial role in
convening the meeting of the National Prison Con-
gressinAmerica.In1870,130 delegatesfrom 24states,
Canada, and South America met in Cincinnati.
Among the most prestigious attendees were none
other than Sir Walter Crofton and Enoch Wines.
Both were among the 40 delegates who delivered
papers at the Congress. Following the delivery of vari-
ous presentations, which ranged from jails and prison
hygiene to executive pardon and indeterminate sen-
tencing, the Congress joined ranks and adopted the
Declaration of Principles, which is regarded as one
of the most progressive documents of prison reform.
The National Prison Association would eventually
provide the nucleus for what would become the
American Correctional Association.
Elmira Reformatory
The Elmira Reformatory in New York laid the
groundwork for the development of the reformatory

movement that would characterize the last three
decades of the 1800s. Elmira was set up for youths
ages 16 to 30 years of age who were serving their
first prison terms. Reflecting the heritage of the
Auburn design, Elmira’s architecture consisted of
interior cell blocks for nighttime solitary confinement
with congregate workshops for daily routine. The
main difference between the prison and the reforma-
tory was Elmira’s greater emphasis on trade training
and academic education.
Two noteworthy features of the reformatory
that differentiated it from state prisons were an em-
phasis on indeterminate sentencing and the mark
system. According to the Elmira system, all sen-
tences had a maximum, but prisoners could earn
parole through hard work and good behavior. Pris-
oners were graded into three classes according to
accomplishments and deportment. New prisoners
were entered in the second grade for six months
and could then be either demoted to the third
grade for bad conduct or promoted to the first
grade when they earned the required “marks.”
Once promoted to the first grade, prisoners could
then be considered for parole. During the heyday of
the reformatory movement, which lasted between
1877 and 1901, 12 states created similar institutions.
CRIM E AND PUNISHM ENT
Americans of the Civil War era were beset by all
manner of criminal activities, some new, others
harkening back to the past. Whether living in
crowded cities or on a remote frontier landscape,
Americans had become accustomed to violence
following the massive bloodletting of the Civil
War. During the late 1870s, the cities became a
crucible for criminal activity. New York City re-
ported 80,000 crimes in 1868 and, according to
historian Alexander Callow, by the early 1870s
boasted 30,000 professional thieves and 2,000
gambling dens.19
According to David R. Johnson in his study of
the development of the American police, the “in-
genuity and boldness” of professional criminals
made them “technically superior” to the police.20
This was especially true in the emerging wave of
bank burglaries in the 1860s.
One would be hard pressed to find a region of
the country with more crime than America’s large
urban areas. However, the cessation of Civil War
hostilities led to more complex patterns of crime
and punishment in the West. While shoot-outs,
cattle rustling, and robberies dominate popular my-
thology, criminal activity was more often confined
to less violent crimes, such as embezzlement, petty
theft and larceny, gambling, prostitution, drunken-
ness, and disorderly conduct.
Birth of Organized Criminal Activity
The Civil War era created a variety of opportunities
for organized crime activity. Abraham Lincoln’s
conscription law with its loophole for paying repla-
cements presented enterprising individuals such as
Chicago’s Michael McDonald with an opportunity
to reap a financial whirlwind from the sectional
conflict cleaving America’s heartland. McDonald
recruited numerous sordid denizens of the under-
world to work in his organized scheme by which
individuals would collect bounties ranging from
$100 to $1,000 to enlist in the Union army and
then would promptly desert. McDonald was given
a commission for each case of “bounty jumping” as
he transported them to different regions to repeat
the scheme. According to one estimate, perhaps
half of the 268,000 cases of desertion during the
war were the result of bounty jumping. While this
cannot be substantiated, it is clear that McDonald
profited enough from this business to set up several
gambling dens after the cessation of hostilities.
Even New York City policemen got caught up
in the bounty racket. In 1865, Lafayette Baker, the
chief of the National Detective Police, under the
War Department, uncovered a system in which po-
lice as well as other city officials colluded in a thriving
business to earn fraudulent bounties. According to
local newspapers, after the war an increase in robber-
ies and burglaries was linked to many criminals who
no longer had access to the bounty racket.21
Chicago would prove an inviting environment
for underworld figures beginning in the 1830s as

burglars, gamblers, prostitutes, counterfeiters, and
gunmen were drawn to the city that would become
synonymous with organized crime in the next cen-
tury. There was little here in the way of law en-
forcement until the mid-1850s. By the Civil War,
crime lords, such as Englishman Roger Plant, were
operating enterprises offering gambling and prosti-
tution. Gearing activities toward soldiers at nearby
military outposts, Plant’s operation provided a
warning-and-escape system that protected custo-
mers from military patrols. Other gambling estab-
lishments operated without serious interference
from the authorities, setting a pattern in Chicago
that would become all too familiar in the 1920s
and 1930s. By the 1860s, gambling syndicates had
become a familiar presence on the urban landscape
in Chicago and elsewhere.
Capital Punishment
Abolitionist agitation against the death penalty
peaked in the 1840s. According to one authority,
once executions in New York State were moved
indoors and other states made the transition to pri-
vate hangings, reformers began to direct their ener-
gies elsewhere. Others suggest that the bloodshed
of
the Civil War ended the movement. While
anti-gallows societies persisted into the 1850s, the
outbreak of the war made it difficult for Union sup-
porters who advocated war to end slavery to support
the end of individual cases of capital punishment.
Indeed, according to historian David Brion Davis,
in the aftermath of the Civil War, which claimed
600,000 soldiers, “men’s finer sensibilities, which
had once been revolted by the execution of a fellow
human being, seemed hardened and blunted.”22
During the Civil War, soldiers were routinely
executed for desertion and other crimes. According
to one historian, 267 Union soldiers were executed
between 1861 and 1867, more than the total of all
other military executions in America’s other wars.23
This same researcher suggests that there was a cer-
tain bias toward ethnicity (Irish), race (African
American), and religion (Catholic) in selecting
cases of military criminals for executions. Despite
Lincoln’s commutation of death sentences for
desertion in February 1864, the hangings and
shootings persisted to the end of hostilities.
Corruption and the City Boss
The 1850s and 1860s witnessed the rise of what one
urban historian has described as “an American orig-
inal,”24 the city boss. Before the rise of the City
Boss, urban concerns were the purview of the
respectable gentry, whose “political credentials,”
according to historian Alex Callow, were often es-
tablished by “family fame, grandeur or fortune.”
But these early exemplars viewed public office as
a duty rather than a calling, in an era when city
services were not guaranteed, but were mostly in
the hands of volunteer organizations of policemen
and firemen. Until the mid-nineteenth century cit-
ies were smaller and less diverse, both racially and
ethnically. The 1850s saw the nation grow more
urbanized, and the new urban centers required
new types of leaders and municipal services.
No one exemplified the corruption and excesses
of urban America more than William M. Tweed. At
the zenith of his power in the late 1860s, he con-
trolled New York City’s government, courts, and
police as well as the state legislature. Best known as
Boss Tweed, he rose to power in 1850s New York.
Elected to the New York Board of Alderman in 1851
and then to an undistinguished term in the U.S.
Congress, he returned home and in 1857 was elected
to the Board of Supervisors, a position that audited
city expenditures, appointed election inspectors, and
supervised public improvements that more often
than not turned into “pork barrel” spending. Over
the next 13 years, Tweed was elected president of the
board four times, each time gaining more power and
more access to fraud and graft. As deputy street com-
missioner in 1863, he had control over thousands of
jobs that could be dispensed to his supporters.
While Tweed was cementing his ties to a hardy
core of constituents, he also made sure to consoli-
date his power with the local Democratic Party or-
ganization at Tammany Hall. Following the Civil
War, Tweed emerged as the leader of the Demo-
cratic Party. Considered the nation’s first political
boss, Tweed wielded tremendous power by using
154

patronage powers to keep his supporters employed.
The Tweed Ring began its reign in 1866, and over
the next five years Tweed colluded with city leaders
to create a dynasty of graft unprecedented in Amer-
ican history up to that time. Accepting kickbacks
from contractors and embellishing building costs
for profit, Tweed was soon targeted by reformers
such as Harper’s Weekly cartoonist and social com-
mentator Thomas Nast.
One of the most powerful urban political machines in
American history, Tammany Hall was founded in 1789.
Created by a Revolutionary War veteran, it was origi-
nally an organization named the Society of Saint
Tammany after a legendary Indian chief. In its early
years, it was a fraternal society rather than a political
party. In the early 1800s, Tammany Hall’s nationwide
membership declined and centered only in New York
City, where it would evolve into an organizational en-
gine, or “machine,” driving the Democratic Party. From
1855 to the early 1930s, Tammany Hall’s political
machine would dominate New York City. Often scorned
for its corruption and graft, following the arrest and
conviction of Boss Tweed in 1871, Tammany made a
comeback just three years later and regained control
of the city government.
A campaign against Tweed came to a head in
1871 when the New York Times obtained reports of
fraud and extravagance from a disgruntled former
confidant of Tweed’s. Following the publication of
these charges, Tweed was arrested for defrauding
the city treasury of at least $6 million. After two
trials, Tweed was sentenced to 12 years, a sentence
that was subsequently reduced to one year. Rear-
rested after his release, he escaped from prison and
fled first to Cuba and then to Spain. He was soon
recognized and extradited back to the United States
and died in jail in 1878.
A sign of changing times, the year 1872 saw
America’s first great “robber baron” plot during the
Credit Mobilier scandal. One of the greatest congres-
sional scandals of the nineteenth century, a financial
unit known as Credit Mobilier was created to finance
the construction oftheUnion Pacific Railroad.Toget
the best possible terms on land grants and rights-
of-way, representatives of the unit sold company
stocks at a huge discount to congressmen that would
“do the most good.” In 1872, just one year after
the Tweed Ring scandal hit the newspapers, the New
York Sun broke the story, resulting in a congressional
investigation that implicated the current vice
president, Schuyler Colfax, and former Speaker of the
House as well as representative and future president
James A. Garfield. Economic historians have esti-
mated Credit Mobilier profits to have ranged from
$13 million to $23 million.
VI OLENCE
The 1850s saw a resurgence in sectional violence
over the slavery issue. Nowhere was the strife
more intense than in Kansas, where rival land
claims, town sites, railroad routes, and the question
of slavery led to violent confrontations. Also con-
tributing to the rising tide of violence in the 1850s
was the growth in American gun production. With
the increased availability of firearms, American cities
for the first time thrived with gun shops offering
guns and their accoutrements to a “large minority
of Americans [who] found confidence in their guns
and longed to demonstrate their proficiency.”25
Birth of Domestic Terrorism
Heralding the bloodshed that was yet to come, dur-
ing the 1850s many parts of the country witnessed
the intimidation of civilians whose sectional leanings
conflicted with their own. The region of Kansas,
Nebraska, and Missouri was blighted by a guerrilla
warfare pitting “Jayhawkers” and “Red Legs” against
those viewed as Confederate sympathizers. In reality,
these gangs of bushwhackers used wartime hatreds as
a cover for a campaign of horse stealing, looting, and
terror. In southern Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana, south-
ern supporters called “Copperheads” or “Butternuts”
wreaked havoc against Unionists in like fashion. The
weight of secession fell even harder on Unionists
living in southern strongholds that dotted Kentucky,
Tennessee, and Virginia.
In May 1856, proslavery forces sacked the free-
soil town of Lawrence, Kansas. For John Brown, a
failed merchant and businessman, this event marked
C RIMINAL JU S TICE IN THE CIVIL W A R ERA (1856– 1876)

a turning point in his life. Furious at the attack, he
summoned volunteers for a “secret mission.” Re-
viled as a terrorist fanatic and revered as a fervent
abolitionist, John Brown was one of the most con-
troversial individuals of the Civil War era. Recent
scholarship traces the birth of American domestic
terrorism to his attack on the proslavery hamlet
along Pottawatomie Creek, Kansas. Recent schol-
arship portrays John Brown in terms similar to the
way Osama bin Laden is viewed today, citing his
fanaticism and use of violence to achieve political
ends in his holy war against slavery. A puritanical
Congregationalist, Brown believed that God had
chosen him for a special purpose. He was con-
vinced that only brutal action directed against slave
owners would win the undeclared war over slavery.
This was made particularly clear on the night of
May 24, 1856, just three days after the proslavery
attack on Lawrence, Kansas, when he led seven
men (including four of his sons) in an attack against
proslavery
settlers
along
Pottawatomie
Creek,
where they butchered five proslavery settlers with
broadswords, cutting off their fingers and arms and
further igniting sectional tensions.
Brown’s actions on behalf of abolitionism culmi-
nated in his ill-fated attack on the federal arsenal at
Harper’s Ferry in 1859. Hoping to provoke a slave
uprising in the South, Brown and 18 of his acolytes
captured the armory and rifle factory and waited for
escaped slaves to flock to his banner. But none came,
and after two days of battle, Brown was captured.
During his subsequent trial, his lawyers tried to
persuade him to plead insanity, but he would have
none of it, and on December 2, 1859, Brown was
elevated to martyrdom by abolitionists as he
mounted the gallows to his death. Prior to his
death, he handed a note to his jailer that read, “I
John Brown am now quite certain that the crimes
of this guilty land: will never be purged away; but
with Blood.” Never in American history, it seemed,
were so many people willing to die for their beliefs.
To this day, Brown remains a complex man, and
opinions are split over his legacy. But at least one
writer ascribes his behavior as an example of “con-
scious political terrorism.” If this is true, then his
deeds continue to resonate in the misdirected
terrorist campaigns of modern-day zealots, such as
the John Brown Brigade (which was embroiled in
violent conflict with the North Carolina Ku Klux
Klan),
Ted
Kaczynski
(the
Unabomber),
and
Timothy McVeigh (the Oklahoma City bomber).
The New York City Draft Riots
The July 13 to July 16, 1863, New York City anti-
draft riot was probably America’s greatest urban
riot. Until recently historians have accepted the
number of fatalities as close to 1,000. However,
research by historians Iver Bernstein and Adrian
Cook suggests that the figure was perhaps one-
tenth of previous estimates, which would still
make it the bloodiest in American history.
The draft riots stemmed in part from President
Lincoln’s conscription laws, which antagonized
Irish immigrants and fueled racial hatreds. Finding
themselves on the lowest rungs of the social ladder,
Irish immigrants resented the fact that they should
fight a war to free the blacks and worried that free-
dom would bring black migration north to com-
pete for jobs. Irish gangs, on the other hand, saw an
opportunity to take advantage of the situation to
loot and pillage unimpeded. Exacerbating class ten-
sions was the fact that better-capitalized draftees
could pay substitutes to take their place in the ranks,
while the impoverished had no legal alternative.
According to Iver Bernstein, the riot was precipi-
tated by a variety of factors, including Confederate
sympathy, resentment toward the conscription act,
and ethnic hatred. However, contrary to the tradi-
tional explanations for the bloodletting, the riot
should be viewed within “the context of an ongo-
ing process of urban change beginning in the early
1850s” as well as “a new complex of social, cultural,
and political relations.”26
The New York draft riots were driven by a
variety of circumstances. Poor citizens saw it as an
opportunity to protest squalid living conditions and
the substitute system. Northern Democrats in-
flamed the racist sentiments of the Irish by telling
draftees that they were being sent to free southern
blacks who would thank them by coming north
and taking away jobs.

Much of the racial violence was directed at
New York City’s sizable free black population as
well as the fledgling police force. In the 1860s,
the police were still poorly equipped to handle riots
of this magnitude. Another problem was that while
the 1850s police force was regarded as community
based, the 1863 force was viewed as instruments of
the state government. With little besides batons and
handguns and occasional military drills, their only
response against the riots consisted of violent retri-
bution. During the New York draft riots, as police-
men found themselves targeted along with any
blacks, one police commissioner ordered his men
to “take no prisoners,” and another wrote in his
memoirs that he told his men to “kill every man
who has a club.”27
The Ku Klux Klan
The birth of the Ku Klux Klan introduced a new
source of American violence in the aftermath of the
Civil War. Regarded as a response to the social,
cultural, and economic changes that many white
southerners found so disturbing during the onset
of Reconstruction, the Klan has undergone a vari-
ety of personifications over the past 140 years.
Created as a club in Pulaski, Tennessee, in
1866 by six former Confederate soldiers, few could
have imagined the direction the Klan would take in
its various incarnations over the next century. Well-
educated members from upstanding families, the six
men were inspired by Greek-letter fraternities in
college to borrow the Greek word kuklos, meaning
“circle of friends,” to name their small fraternity the
Ku-Klux, adding “Klan” only to give it an allitera-
tive intensity. It was not long before the name
would inspire its more sinister connotations.
As the six initial members sought new mem-
bers, they masked themselves in anonymity through
the use of white masks with eyes cut out for the
nose and eyes. This was soon complemented by a
long robe. In the years of Reconstruction, it was
not difficult to attract new members, especially after
adopting a goal of maintaining white supremacy.
Over the next decade, white terrorist groups waged
an often bloody campaign to undermine the social,
economic, and political reforms of the radical
Republic agenda.
The main targets of Klan night riders and simi-
larly motivated standard bearers for racial supremacy
were the recently freed African Americans. Lacking a
formal organizational structure, individual vigilante
groups attempted to violently enforce the racial
codes that were threatened by the end of slavery.
Striking usually at night to achieve the maximum
threat, specifically targeted were blacks who defied
white authority. In an attempt to restrict the free
movement of blacks on local roads, open season
was declared on those who attempted to move about
freely. Historian James W. Clarke compared the Klan
to “a uniformed, paramilitary extension of the earlier
practice of slave patrols that had roamed the country-
side looking for runaways.”28
Reconstruction Violence
Simmering animosities between supporters of both
sides of the war often escalated into bloodshed dur-
ing the Reconstruction years from 1866 to 1877. In
perhaps a warning of what could be expected in the
post-slavery years, on July 30, 1866, Union sym-
pathizers and freedmen met at Mechanics’ Hall in
New Orleans to demand a more humiliating re-
sponse to the former Confederates. It was not
long before a large crowd of armed whites des-
cended on the revelers and fired into their midst.
What started as a celebration of the passage of re-
cent civil rights legislation quickly turned into a
massacre. By the time federal troops arrived,
34 black and three white Unionists had been mur-
dered and dozens wounded. This incident would
be repeated in other southern cities with the onset
of the Reconstruction and the military occupation
of the South.
Recent research indicates that continuing rival-
ries between Union and Confederate boosters led to
the notorious Hatfield–McCoy feud, which lasted
from 1873 to 1883 in the mountains of West
Virginia, a region that also included the mountain
communities of western Virginia and Kentucky.
Mountain feuds persisted because of an absence of
regular law enforcement and a tradition of people’s

taking law into their own hands. East Texas was
perhaps the most violent region of the country dur-
ing the post–Civil War era, with feuds such as the
Sutton–Taylor feud of 1869–1877 rivaling the
Hatfield–McCoy feud in its vitriol. The southwest-
ern states also witnessed a host of violent conflicts in
this period stemming from wartime dislocation,
Reconstruction animosities, the rapid growth of the
cattle industry, and the instability produced by wars
with the Comanche and the Kiowa Indian tribes.
Interracial Violence
Despite the end of slavery in the South, some plan-
ters refused to recognize emancipation, and on occa-
sion freedmen were beaten, killed, or mutilated to
prevent them from leaving the plantation. Local law
enforcement often supported planters by authorizing
more punitive punishment for blacks than for whites.
This could include public whippings, pillories, and
chain gangs, clearly an attempt to send a message to
the new freemen. According to Reconstruction his-
torian George C. Rable, with little chance of a fair
hearing in local courts, the Freedmen’s Bureau and
the army were their last resort but were rarely able to
help.29 Justice continued to be color conscious for
blacks. Officials rarely heard complaints by black
litigants against white defendants, nor were great at-
tempts made to apprehend whites who killed freed-
men. According to Union General Philip Sheridan,
“My own opinion is that the trial of a white man for
the murder of a freedman in Texas would be a
farce.”30 Indeed, Texas would not execute a white
man for the murder of an African American until late
in the twentieth century. With little protection from
local courts and law enforcement, the army was seen
as the only source of protection.
The years following the Civil War witnessed
the majority of the Indian–white confrontations in
the West as settlers flocked beyond the Mississippi
River to take advantage of the Homestead Act
passed by congressional Republicans in 1862. That
same year saw one of the worst Indian uprisings in
American history when the Sioux of Minnesota re-
volted against inhumane treatment by government
Indian agents. Following the killing of between 500
and 800 white settlers, federal troops and state militia
defeated the Indians and restored order. In the end,
38 Indians were hanged at one time from the same
gallows, the largest mass hanging in American his-
tory. According to one nineteenth-century source,
“they were placed upon a platform facing inwards,
and dropped by the cutting of rope all at one time.”31
NOTABLE TRIALS
Trial of the Lincoln Conspirators (1865)
The trial of seven coconspirators charged with assas-
sinating President Lincoln opened on May 9, 1865,
less than a month after the assassination. The pro-
ceedings would be marked by controversy and ran-
cor from the start. Among the most celebrated of the
conspirators were Mrs. Mary Surratt and Dr. Samuel
Mudd, the latter charged with helping attend the
injured John Wilkes Booth on his flight from
Washington, D.C., to sanctuary in the South.
The seven prisoners were given one to three
days to prepare their cases and obtain counsel.
The first day of the trial was held in a secret court
session, reminiscent of the Star Chamber of Tudor
England. Public demand soon opened up the pro-
ceedings to the press and the public. The court was
almost immediately challenged on the grounds that
it was a military tribunal. The main justification for
this sort of trial was that the United States was at
war and that the deceased president had been the
commander in chief of the armed forces.
The defendants argued that a military court did
not have jurisdiction since the accused were not
members of the armed forces, but their pleas were
overruled. The defendants then asked to be tried
separately, and this too was denied. By most stan-
dards, the trial was extraordinary. The defendants at
this time did not have the right to testify on their
own behalf. To prevent the defendants from taking
their own lives, great steps were taken to guard
against suicide. The prisoners were kept in solitary
confinement before their court appearances, and
their faces were covered by canvas hoods with
openings at the mouth for eating and breathing.

During the seven-week trial, the prosecution
paraded in a slew of witnesses, and after several
more days of rebuttal and final presentations, the
case went to military judges who then deliberated
for two days. Conducted amid the clamor of post-
war hysteria, the defendants were connected to
every misdeed associated with the Confederacy, in-
cluding the Andersonville military prison and the
plot to burn New York City. Numerous witnesses
who could have helped the defense were not called
to testify, and little evidence connected Mary
Surratt to the conspiracy outside of owning the
rooming house where the plot was hatched.
At the end of June 1865, the commission
reached a separate verdict for each defendant. Of
the eventual eight defendants, four were sentenced
to be hanged, including the only woman, Mary
Surratt. An execution date was set for July 7, only
12 weeks after Lincoln’s death. The public was not
informed of the date until two days prior to the
execution. Despite a plea for clemency on behalf
of Surratt, the four mounted the gallows on a hot
July day while a crowd of spectators watched. To the
end, most believed that Surratt would be spared. But
when all hope was lost, conspirator Lewis Paine told
the executioner, “If I had two lives to give, I’d give
one gladly to save Mrs. Surratt.” All four were then
executed at the same moment.
CONCLUSIONS
The Civil War generated extraordinary problems
for the American criminal justice system. By its
conclusion in 1865, many of the system’s compo-
nents had been altered and modified. The abolition
of slavery and the return of traumatized war veter-
ans to every region of the country would lead to a
rise in crime and a strain on the courts, policing,
and prisons.
The end of the Civil War tested America’s de-
veloping criminal justice system and introduced
new forms of criminality while stimulating the de-
velopment of new crime-fighting strategies and in-
stitutions. Ku Klux Klan night riders, organized
gambling, counterfeiters, train robbers, and bank
robbery would test the ingenuity of law enforce-
ment on both the federal and the local levels.
Although there was a perceptible shift in public
opinion over the death penalty between the eigh-
teenth century and the Civil War, only Michigan,
Rhode Island, and Wisconsin abolished capital
punishment. The Civil War years sapped the aboli-
tionist movement of much of its vigor as opponents
to capital punishment found an array of issues and
crusades that had more impact on everyday life to
pour their energies into. As executions were re-
moved from public spectacle to behind prison walls,
there was less opportunity to incite activists and
other opponents. Gauging the public reaction to
these developments was the response to the public
hanging of the Lincoln conspirators, which few dis-
approved of.
Slavery officially ended by constitutional action
with the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in
December 1865. The end of the Civil War was
followed by a period of Reconstruction lasting
from 1865 to 1877, during which mob violence
abated in northern cities as vigilantism seemed to
grow in intensity west of the Mississippi River.
By the 1860s, urban policing had finally left
its colonial roots behind, as uniformed officers pa-
trolled beats in many major cities. Auguring a
century of tremendous advances in investigation
techniques, as early as the 1850s precincts were
linked to central headquarters by telegraph wires.
New York City was credited with introducing a
“Rogues Portrait Gallery” in the 1850s, displaying
photos of hundreds of known criminals. The next
decade would see the introduction of the first tele-
graph police boxes, by which a police officer could
turn a key in a box and have his location and num-
ber be automatically recorded at headquarters. By
the late 1860s, retirement pensions were available
for New York police veterans, and an insurance
fund was established for the families of policemen
killed or disabled on duty. In 1871, 112 police of-
ficials gathered to discuss the late increase in crime,
setting into motion a series of meetings that would
lead to the creation of the National Chiefs of Police
Union (1893), the forerunner of the International
Chiefs of Police (1902).

By the 1850s, the era of correctional reform
had almost ground to a halt, as focus was diverted
to the prison industry. During the war years, prisons
were major manufacturers of clothing, shoes, furni-
ture, and uniforms. Following the Civil War,
southern prisons were increasingly populated by
black convicts. But elsewhere, prison reform would
be reinvigorated in the years prior to the meeting of
the National Prison Congress in 1870, and during
the next decade, opposition by trade unions led to
restrictions on the interstate commerce of prison
goods. As the 1870s saw the arrival of the “Gilded
Age,” northern prisons, modeled on factories and
replete with shops and contractors, stood in sharp
contrast to southern prisons, which for the most
part remained an anachronism. Michael Stephen
Hindus’s portrait of the South Carolina peniten-
tiary, which was “almost entirely black, with its
chain gangs, field hands, work songs, and white
overseers, [and] resembled the plantation,”32 re-
mains an indelible reminder of the divergent socie-
ties in the North and the South.
The end of the Civil War was followed by one
of the most dramatic events in American constitu-
tional history when President Andrew Johnson sur-
vived impeachment by one vote in 1868. Unlike
Great Britain, where impeachment is part of the
political process, impeachment American-style was
a legal instrument since the law stated that a presi-
dent may be removed from office only for “treason,
bribery, or other high Crimes and misdemeanors”
and only after a trial in the Senate presided over by
the chief justice. Johnson’s impeachment was the
result of a bitter feud between the president and
Congress over Reconstruction policy and over
Johnson’s supposedly “unconstitutional” attempt
to remove Secretary of War Edwin Stanton from
office against the wishes of the Senate. Following
his trial, which lasted from March to April, Johnson
narrowly kept his office and preserved the right to
presidential independence.
Lincoln’s assassination, the impeachment of
Johnson, and the turmoil accompanying Recon-
struction were larger-than-life episodes that capti-
vated the nation and taxed every segment of the
criminal justice system at all levels—federal, state,
and local. The end of the Civil War would set
the stage for the nation’s greatest outbreak of out-
lawry in the West as the eastern cities came to grips
with the complexities of the Gilded Age and the
rise of the robber barons.
Point–Counterpoint
Ex Parte Milligan: The Suspension of Habeas
Corpus (1861/66)
On March 3, 1863, Congress authorized President Abraham
Lincoln to suspend the writ of habeas corpus (although Lincoln
evolved his own constitutional interpretation by which he
suspended the writ in 1861 without Congressional approval).
On September 15, 1863, the writ was suspended in cases
where officers held individuals for offenses against the military.
This was considered one of Lincoln’s most controversial deci-
sions as president. Resistance to this decision resonates today
in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. In the first selection
Lincoln defends his suspension of habeas corpus in 1861. The
second passage is from the landmark Court decision Ex Parte
Milligan. In this the Supreme Court denounced military
tribunals in areas where the civil courts were open.
Soon after the first call for militia it was con-
sidered a duty to authorize the Commanding Gen-
eral in proper cases, according to his discretion, to
suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus,
or, in other words, to arrest and detain without
resort to the ordinary processes and forms of law
such individuals as he might deem dangerous to
the public safety. This authority has purposely
been exercised but very sparingly. Nevertheless,
the legality and propriety of what has been done
under it are questioned, and the attention of the
country has been called to the proposition that
one who is sworn to “take care that the laws be
faithfully executed” should not himself violate
them. Of course some consideration was given to
the questions of power and propriety before this
matter was acted upon. The whole of the laws
which were required to be faithfully executed

were being resisted and failing of execution in
nearly one-third of the States. Must they be al-
lowed to finally fail of execution, even had it
been perfectly clear that by the use of the means
necessary to their execution some single law, made
in such extreme tenderness of the citizen’s liberty
that practically it relieves more of the guilty than of
the innocent, should to a very limited extent be
violated? To state the question more directly, Are
all the laws but one to go unexecuted, and the
Government itself go to pieces lest that one be vio-
lated? Even in such a case, would not the official
oath be broken if the Government should be over-
thrown when it was believed that disregarding the
single law would tend to preserve it? But it was not
believed that this question was presented. It was not
believed that any law was violated. The provision
of the Constitution that “the privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when,
in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety
may require it” is equivalent to a provision—is a
provision—that such privilege may be suspended
when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public
safety does require it. It was decided that we have a
case of rebellion and that the public safety does
require the qualified suspension of the privilege of
the writ which was authorized to be made. Now it
is insisted that Congress, and not the Executive, is
vested with this power; but the Constitution itself is
silent as to which or who is to exercise the power;
and as the provision was plainly made for a danger-
ous emergency, it can not be believed the framers
of the instrument intended that in every case the
danger should run its course until Congress could
be called together, the very assembling of which
might be prevented, as was intended in this case,
by the rebellion.
No more extended argument is now offered, as
an opinion at some length will probably be pre-
sented by the Attorney-General. Whether there
shall be any legislation upon the subject, and, if
any, what, is submitted entirely to the better judg-
ment of Congress.
DAVIS J.:…The controlling question in the case
is this: Upon the facts stated in Milligan’s petition, and
the exhibits filed, had the military commission
mentioned in its jurisdiction, legally, to try and sen-
tence him? Milligan, not a resident of one of the
rebellious states, or a prisoner of war, but a citizen
of Indiana for twenty years past, and never in the
military or naval service, is, while at his home, ar-
rested by the military power of the United States,
imprisoned, and, on certain criminal charges pre-
ferred against him, tried, convicted, and sentenced
to be hanged by a military commission, organized
under the direction of the military commander of
the military district of Indiana. Had this tribunal
the legal power and authority to try and punish this
man?…
The Constitution of the United States is a law for
rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and
covers with the shield of its protection all classes of
men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No
doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences,
was ever invented by the wit of man than that any
of its provisions can be suspended during any of the
great exigenciesof government.Such adoctrine leads
directly to anarchy or despotism, but the theory of
necessity on which it is based is false; for the govern-
ment, within the Constitution, has all the powers
granted to it which are necessary to preserve its exis-
tence; as has been happily proved by the result of the
great effort to throw off its just authority.
Have any of the rights guaranteed by the Con-
stitution been violated in the case of Milligan? and
if so, what are they?
Every trial involves the exercise of judicial
power; and from what source did the military com-
mission that tried him derive their authority? Cer-
tainly no part of the judicial power of the country
was conferred on them; because the Constitution
expressly vests it “in one Supreme Court and such
inferior courts as the Congress may from time to
time ordain and establish,” and it is not pretended
that the commission was a court ordained and es-
tablished by Congress. They cannot justify on the
mandate of the President, because he is controlled
by law, and has his appropriate sphere of duty,
which is to execute, not to make, the laws; and
there is “no unwritten criminal code to which re-
sort can be had as a source of jurisdiction.”

But it is said that the jurisdiction is complete
under the “laws and usages of war.”
It can serve no useful purpose to inquire what
those laws and usages are, whence they originated,
where found, and on whom they operate; they
can never be applied to citizens in states which
have upheld the authority of the government,
and where the courts are open and their process
unobstructed. This Court has judicial knowledge
that in Indiana the federal authority was always
unopposed, and its courts always open to hear
criminal accusations and redress grievances; and
no usage of war would sanction a military trial
there for any offense whatever of a citizen in civil
life, in nowise connected with the military service.
Congress could grant no such power; and to the
honor of our national legislature be it said, it has
never been provoked by the state of the country
even to attempt its exercise. One of the plainest
constitutional provisions was, therefore, infringed
when Milligan was tried by a court not ordained
and established by Congress, and not composed of
judges appointed during good behavior.
Why was he not delivered to the circuit court
of Indiana to be proceeded against according to
law? … If it was dangerous, in the distracted con-
dition of affairs, to leave Milligan unrestrained of his
liberty, because he “conspired against the govern-
ment, afforded aid and comfort to rebels, and in-
cited the people to insurrection,” the law said, arrest
him, confine him closely, render him powerless to
do further mischief; and then present his case to the
grand jury of the district, with proofs of his guilt,
and, if indicted, try him according to the course of
the common law. If this had been done, the Con-
stitution would have been vindicated, the law of
1863 enforced, and the securities for personal lib-
erty preserved and defended.
Another guarantee of freedom was broken
when Milligan was denied a trial by jury.…
It is claimed that martial law covers with its
broad mantle the proceedings of this military com-
mission. The proposition is this: that in a time of
war the commander of an armed force (if, in his
opinion, the exigencies of the country demand it,
and of which he is to judge) has the power, within
the lines of his military district, to suspend all civil
rights and their remedies, and subject citizens as
well as soldiers to the rule of his will; and in the
exercise of his lawful authority cannot be restrained,
except by his superior officer or the President of the
United States.…
The statement of this proposition shows its im-
portance; for, if true, republican government is a
failure, and there is an end of liberty regulated by
law. Martial law, established on such a basis, de-
stroys every guarantee of the Constitution, and ef-
fectually renders the “military independent of, and
superior to, the civil power,”—the attempt to do
which by the king of Great Britain was deemed by
our fathers such an offense, that they assigned it to
the world as one of the causes which impelled them
to declare their independence. Civil liberty and this
kind of martial law cannot endure together; the
antagonism is irreconcilable; and, in the conflict,
one or the other must perish.…
The necessities of the service, during the late
rebellion, required that the loyal states should be
placed within the limits of certain military districts
and commanders appointed in them; and, it is
urged, that this, in a military sense, constituted
them the theatre of military operations; and, as in
this case, Indiana had been and was again threat-
ened with invasion by the enemy, the occasion
was furnished to establish martial law. The conclu-
sion does not follow from the premises. If armies
were collected in Indiana, they were to be em-
ployed in another locality, where the laws were
obstructed and the national authority disputed.
On her soil there was no hostile foot; if once in-
vaded, that invasion was at an end, and with it all
pretext for martial law. Martial law cannot arise
from a threatened invasion. The necessity must
be actual and present; the invasion real, such as ef-
fectually closes the courts and deposes the civil
administration.…
Martial rule can never exist where the courts are
open, and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of
their jurisdiction. It is also confined to the locality of
actual war. Because, during the late rebellion it could
have been enforced in Virginia, where the national
authority was overturned and the courts driven out,
162

it does not follow that it should obtain in Indiana,
where that authority was never disputed, and justice
was always administered. And so in the case of a
foreign invasion, martial rule may become a necessity
in one state, when, in another, it would be “mere
lawless violence.”…

Prior to the Civil War, there was little support for
centralization in a society that so revered the virtues
of republicanism. However, the nation that emerged
from the war was a much different society, and de-
centralization began to give way to organization in
the arenas of politics and industry. Soon reformers
in the area of criminal justice engaged the public con-
science over poverty, insanity, crime, corruption, and
vice, leading several states to create central authorities
responsible for the inspection and control of prisons.
The publication of the Wines and Dwight’s Report
on the Prisons and Reformatories of the United States and
Canada in 1867 jump-started the movement for the
central control of state prisons.
The end of the Civil War would provide the
impetus for a gradual transformation of southern
criminal justice. By 1865, the South was simply too
impoverished to make any advances in the realm of
prisons, insane asylums, and public schools. Formerly
predicated on the rules and regulations of the planta-
tion system of slavery, states and the federal govern-
ment assumed control of the freed population from
their former owners. According to historian Edward L.
Ayers, the end of the Civil War saw the Ku Klux
Klan and the Freedman’s Bureau1 attempt to “impose
their vision of order upon the South.”2 Both sides
faltered in their attempts but would leave the theore-
tical foundation for another century of conflict and
tension between the races in the South.
As the nineteenth century moved to conclusion,
a crusade was underway to create separate prison
facilities for women. This movement, led by women
on behalf of women, began in earnest in midcen-
tury, when a handful of states hired matrons to over-
see female inmates. By the late 1860s, Dwight and
Wines, two of the leading authorities on prison re-
form, conceded that “carefully selected matrons …
could provide role models” and that “matrons who

exhibited characteristics of middle-class homemakers
might inspire female criminals to become respectable
women.”3 The campaign for separate prisons for
women came to fruition in the 1870s.
Meanwhile, in the rest of the nation, the late-
nineteenth-century economy underwent a cycle of
boom and bust, leading to a heavily contested de-
bate over the role and rights of the industrial
worker in the new economy. As liberal and pro-
gressive ideals found a national stage and a voice in
organized labor, so too did big business and the so-
called robber barons turn to private police agencies,
such as the Pinkertons, to support their interests,
often ending in violent confrontations.
Mirroring the growth taking place elsewhere,
the federal government also began to play a more
prominent role in daily life as federal courts and
political parties became more influential. As citizens
gained more rights thanks to the Civil Rights Act of
1866 and the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth
Amendments, the government took on more re-
sponsibility for protecting these rights.
In the aftermath of the Civil War, citizens were
more frequently impaneled as jurors and witnesses
during criminal trials. Prior to the war, the only fed-
eral criminal statutes dealt with counterfeiting, mail
robbery, smuggling, embezzling federal funds, and
resisting or impersonating a federal officer. With
the end of hostilities in 1865, more federal crimes
were added to the list. Among the new groups tar-
geted by various criminal justice agencies were the
Ku Klux Klan, Mormon settlers who practiced poly-
gamy, and Appalachian moonshiners.
While the police became increasingly sophisti-
cated in the late nineteenth century, professionali-
zation and training lagged behind. Beginning in the
1850s, many forces adopted the sidearm as part of
the standard equipment, but despite the improve-
ment in revolver design, “police marksmanship
proved abysmal.”4 A lack of training in safety or
marksmanship characterized the use of deadly force,
leading, according to one study of southern polic-
ing, to numerous accidental shootings of civilians
and fellow officers.
The last half of the nineteenth century saw nu-
merous advances in police investigation as the social
sciences of anthropology, ethnology, and sociology all
gained serious acceptance and photography was often
used to augment studies in these disciplines. Begin-
ning in the 1850s with the introduction of daguerreo-
type and the telegraph and continuing with the use of
telephones in the 1880s and the Bertillon system by
the 1890s, major cities in the North and the South
were adopting new police technology to take the
forces into the next century.
During the so-called Victorian era of the nine-
teenth century (which paralleled the reign of
England’s Queen Victoria in roughly the last half
of the nineteenth century), a double standard existed
in which certain moral offenses were tolerated as
long as they did “not threaten the general fabric of
society.”5 According to this “Victorian compro-
mise,” gambling, prostitution, and other related
forms of vice and crime were tolerated under the
assumption that there was little that could be officially
done to eradicate them. Historian Lawrence Fried-
man describes this compromise as “a muddled but
powerful theory of social control”6 in which private
sins could be tolerated in the “dark corners and back
alleys” as long as public order was not compromised.
In earlier years, only married people could legally
have sexual relations. Sexual violations were criminal
acts and were equated with sin. Infractions ranged
from fornication, incest, adultery, and bestiality to
prostitution and homosexuality. However, in the
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the crimi-
nal justice system devoted less time to pursuing these
behaviors. Recognizing the impossibility of purging
immorality from the urban landscape, law enforce-
ment focused on more deviant behavior while coex-
isting with certain “acceptable” forms of vice, such as
prostitution and gambling, but with specific limits.
THE LAW GIVERS
Following the Civil War, the Supreme Court was
faced with numerous due process challenges to state
policies predicated on the Fourteenth Amendment.
Ratified in 1868, this amendment had a tremen-
dous impact on the long-term development of the
168

law of personal status as well as the nature of the
federal system. Among its most far-reaching sec-
tions was its establishment of national citizenship,
declaring that all persons were guaranteed equal
protection of the laws, privileges and immunities,
and due process of law.
Moreover, the post–Civil War era saw a substan-
tial number of cases dealing with criminal due process
and constitutional protections of the Bill of Rights
coinciding with the expansion of federal criminal
law. Among the most famous of these cases were
two 1873 court decisions. In Bradwell v. Illinois, con-
sidered the “first decision under the Fourteenth
Amendment,”7 law student Myra Bradwell brought
suit when she was denied admission to the Illinois bar
even though the court admitted she was amply qual-
ified. The case came before the Supreme Court,
which affirmed the initial court decision that the
Fourteenth Amendment did not restrict state power
to limit the practice of law to males. But according to
the legal concept of equality of 1870s America, as
expressed by Justice Joseph P. Bradley, “the civil
law, as well as nature herself, has always recognized
a wide difference in the respective spheres and desti-
nies of man and woman.… The natural and proper
timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex
evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of civil
life.”8 In Bradwell, it became clear, at least for the
moment, that the equal protection clause of the Four-
teenth Amendment protected only men. Because of
the efforts of Bradwell, Illinois passed a law in 1882
allowing women to practice any profession. How-
ever, it would be decades before women would be
well represented in the legal profession. As late as
1920, only 3% of the nation’s lawyers were women.9
The 1873 Slaughterhouse cases grew out of an
1869 decision by the Louisiana legislature to give a
25-year monopoly to a specific New Orleans
slaughterhouse to conduct its business in this city.
In response, a consortium of different butchers
sought an injunction against the monopoly on the
grounds that it deprived them of the “privileges and
immunities” guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amend-
ment to all citizens.
After losing the case in the state supreme court,
they appealed the judgment to the U.S. Supreme
Court, where they were again denied by a narrow
vote of five to four. According to the Supreme
Court’s interpretation, the amendment had been
designed exclusively to grant African Americans
federal protection against discriminatory state laws
(such as state laws forbidding blacks to serve on
juries) but was not applicable in regard to the “pri-
vileges and immunities” of other citizens. By this
ruling, states had the power then to regulate all
other civil rights (including property rights and
rights of contract). Although the intent of the law
was actually to protect due process, the decision of
the Court ignored this fact, setting a precedent that
would last until the twentieth century. According
to legal historian David J. Bodenhamer, in the
1870s “the justices demonstrated a reluctance to
apply any of the Bill of Rights to the states, espe-
cially in criminal matters.”10
The South
In an attempt to return to familiar antebellum social
control measures, southern lawmakers framed new
legal codes to regulate the former slave population.
These new laws did not blatantly mention race but
instead resorted to enhancing the discretionary
powers of local judges and juries. For example,
the range of punishments meted out for crimes
considered “peculiarly ‘black,’” such as vagrancy,
rape, arson, and burglary,11 were widened in the
decade following the war. In 1866 in Savannah,
Georgia, one of the most important cities in the
South, “freedmens’ courts” were sometimes influ-
enced by local officials to sentence blacks to chain
gangs or resorted to exhibitory punishments by
which convicted offenders would be forced to
wear a barrel with armholes and a banner announc-
ing “I am a thief.”12 Similar punishments were
rarely accorded to white convicts.
Plessy v. Ferguson
White supremacy stood triumphant in the South by
the 1890s, with segregation and disenfranchisement
accepted features of society south of the Mason–
Dixon line. Between 1877 and the 1890s, blacks

continued to vote and hold public office. But the
1890s saw the implementation of grandfather
clauses, literacy tests, poll taxes, and even terror to
discourage black participation in the political sys-
tem. Further polarization occurred with the accep-
tance of current “scientific” notions of racism and
criminality.
In 1892, Louisiana resident Homer Plessy was
riding a train out of New Orleans but was ejected
from a car for whites and directed toward a car
reserved for nonwhites. Light skinned and one-
eighth black, Plessy claimed that a Louisiana statute
that provided for separate railway carriages for
whites and blacks was contrary to the Fourteenth
Amendment’s requirement of equal protection of
the laws. Plessy took his case to court, reaching as
high as the Supreme Court in 1896. The Court put
the seal of approval on segregation by rejecting
Plessy’s contention and holding that segregation
alone was not a constitutional violation. By a ma-
jority ruling, the Court approved a “separate but
equal” doctrine that for more than 50 years all
but nullified the Constitution’s equal protection
clause as an instrument of racial equality. Until
1954, Plessy v. Ferguson, which ruled that state-
mandated segregated facilities did not violate the
equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment as long as facilities provided for blacks and
whites were approximately equal, would serve as
the constitutional cornerstone of racial discrimina-
tion in the United States.
The Comstock Laws
Cheap newspapers, known collectively as the
“penny press,” were filled with every manner of
advertisement. Urban newspapers found abortion-
related advertisements “a lucrative source of in-
come” beginning in the 1840s and 1850s. This
phenomenon accompanied the commercialization of
the drug industry and reflected the desire of well-to-
do women to limit their birthrate.13 The growing
abortion trade soon inspired sensationalist stories
in the mass-circulation newspapers, leading to neg-
ative rhetoric and imagery that brought the entire
practice of abortion into question.
During the 1870s, the Victorian compromise
“began to crumble.”14 In 1873, Congress passed
the Comstock Law, which prohibited the mailing
of art, literature, and other materials considered ob-
scene by the U.S. postal agent Anthony Comstock,
who crusaded to make birth control and abortion
illegal in the United States. The law also banned
from the mail any drug, medicine, or article for
abortion or contraceptive purposes (including con-
doms). The new legislation enjoyed widespread
support. Many native-born Americans saw contra-
ception and abortion as a form of “race suicide,”
particularly in the face of mounting foreign immi-
gration. To others, these practices “violated nature’s
laws, bred immorality,” and “damaged health.”15
In 1873, Comstock was instrumental in estab-
lishing the New York Society for the Suppression
of Vice, the first organization of its kind in America.
Comstock would devote the last 42 years of his life
to this society as its secretary. Later that year, a
group of New England ministers organized the
New England Society for the Suppression of Vice,
which would become better known as the New
England Watch and Ward Society. Other anti-
vice societies were launched in major cities, includ-
ing St. Louis, Chicago, Louisville, Cincinnati, and
San Francisco. All the founders of the anti-vice so-
cieties were stalwart members of the native-born
community. Comstock’s campaign against birth
control and abortion led to a deadly underground
abortion business that was estimated to have taken
the lives of thousands of women between the 1870s
and the 1970s.16
Anthony Comstock (1844–1915) moved to New York in
the late 1860s after serving in the Union army in the Civil
War. It was not long before he was campaigning against
obscenity on behalf of the YMCA. His growing influence
inspired Congress in 1871 to pass what became known as
the Comstock Law, which prohibited the transmission of
obscene materials through the mail. To enforce the leg-
islation, Comstock accepted a nonpaying position as a
postal inspector. The zealous defender of morality rose to
prominence by personally taking part in raids against
pornography shops and abortionist offices in New York
City. In one of his most controversial forays into censor-
ship, in 1913 his crusade against artist Paul Chabas’s nude

painting September Morn led to rancorous debate over
the definition of obscenity (and to its future success after
it was rejected as too racy for a barbershop calendar). For
his defenders, his name became a byword for morality,
while his detractors regarded him as a threat to freedom
of expression and the First Amendment.
Under the sway of Comstock’s extremist con-
victions, obscenity was vaguely defined, leading
to thousands of arrests. According to the American
College Dictionary, Comstockery became a byword
for “overzealous censorship of the fine arts and
literature.”17 Margaret Sanger’s books on birth con-
trol were banned, while poet Walt Whitman was
fired from his job with the Department of the
Interior for penning Leaves of Grass. Publishers
removed any explicit language from their publica-
tions; for example, pregnant became enceinte.
LAW ENFOR C EM ENT
Between 1870 and 1900, most large American cities
had established professional police forces. However,
for the less populated areas, a vacuum in authority
led to the creation of vigilante groups, lynchings,
and deadly feuds. While the Ku Klux Klan at-
tempted to preserve the antebellum status quo,
others took the law into their own hands to protect
their newfound freedoms.
As mentioned earlier, the post–Civil War era
witnessed the diminished role of the militia at a
time when urban criminal violence was on the
rise. Militia historian Robert Reinders suggested
that the violent industrial strikes of 1877 “provided
a new stimulus and role for the militia,” one that
demonstrated their impracticality for the industrial
era.18 In many cases, militia members sympathized
with strikers, contributing to the growing disorder.
In 1877, national armed forces demonstrated their
superiority to the militia in quelling civil distur-
bances. Better trained and disciplined, the army
proved better qualified at ending riots than their
militia counterparts.
Police forces saw reform efforts from local poli-
ticians, state legislatures, and chiefs of police. The
New York City police chief George W. Walling,
after having served 40 years on the force, argued
that police officers should work to improve their re-
lations with the public, going beyond their mandate
as keepers of the peace. In the same era, Cincinnati’s
George M. Roe boasted that his department had
created a “gymnasium” and a “School of Instruction”
for his officers in the late 1880s. According to Roe’s
memoir published in 1890, Cincinnati policemen
were expected to “be a perfect specimen of physical
manhood” and “must have a knowledge of the
English language sufficient to make written reports
intelligible,” as well as be “versed in criminal and
municipal laws to avoid making any mistakes” that
could haunt them later during criminal proceedings.19
While police work remained a male domain
well into the twentieth century, steps were taken
to include women in a secondary role beginning in
1878, when some forces placed matrons in charge
of female prisoners. By 1890, as a result of a cam-
paign by several women’s groups, 36 city police
departments hired police matrons.
As the turn of the century approached, Irish
Americans dominated the ranks of many urban
police forces, with cities as diverse as Chicago,
Cleveland, and San Francisco counting a dispro-
portionate number of Irish among their ranks.
Not all observers were favorable to this develop-
ment, including one who wrote a diatribe in 1894
titled “The Irish Conquest of Our Cities,” in
which he lamented the number of Irish police
chiefs in America.20
Police work remained a rather solitary profes-
sion in the closing decades of the nineteenth cen-
tury, with most officers working either alone or in
small groups. Attempts at police discipline and su-
pervision fell short because of the limited power of
police officials to enforce the rules. Outside of on-
the-street supervision, there were few ways to
closely supervise police on patrol. Some police
commissioners sent out plainclothes patrolmen to
check on colleagues. New York City police com-
missioner Theodore Roosevelt (the future presi-
dent) made the rounds at night, stopping in
saloons and the like. If an officer was spotted in a
saloon while on duty, he could expect to appear at

headquarters the next morning. Some forces com-
piled massive rules books that included protocols
for patrolling and making reports. Most violations
were punished with fines. According to one police
historian, “Some departments administrators pun-
ished policemen more often for violation of the
rules than they did for crimes like assault or
blackmail.”21
Federal Law Enforcement
The South and the West continued to lag behind
the North when it came to economic develop-
ment. Both regions had little political clout in
Washington—with smaller populations, they had
less representation. Following the war, the belief
that criminal law was a state matter and not a federal
one still persisted in the South. Congress in turn
passed certain federal laws that disproportionately
targeted the South and the West; hence, federal
law enforcement was more inextricably tied to
these regions.
According to historian Stephen Cresswell’s
study of federal law enforcement, for the years
1871–1890, the North had only 14 federal criminal
cases per 10,000 for this time period compared to
54 per 10,000 in the South and 72 per 10,000 in
the West.22 Cresswell suggested that “certain ele-
ments in southern and western society made the
violation of federal laws more common than in the
North.” Among the elements he cites are the get-
rich mentality of the West and the prevalent dislike
of the federal government in the defeated South.23
During Reconstruction, large areas of the for-
mer Confederacy were indeed relatively peaceful
and could boast efficient law enforcement. With a
large portion of white citizens loath to publicly de-
nounce acts of violence against the former slaves in
the 1870s, southern blacks and former Unionists
often turned to the U.S. army as their only source
of protection. However, the army was usually un-
willing or unable to respond to such requests.
Federal law enforcement in the American West
during the last half of the 1800s was the preserve of
U.S. marshals. Between 1840 and 1900, marshals
were elected to cover states and territories. Their
main job was to uphold federal laws, which
included arresting individuals for robbing the mails,
deserting from the armed forces, stealing govern-
ment stock, or killing Indians. Each marshal had an
office deputy who was responsible for maintaining
paperwork and could pass on orders to field depu-
ties. Until 1896, only the office deputies were paid a
salary, while the other federal deputies were paid
through a fee system (about $2 per day) and mileage
(6 to 10 cents per mile). Although the marshal re-
ceived no salary, the position itself was considered a
stepping-stone to better things.
In 1896 U. S. Marshal Creighton M. Foraker assumed law
enforcement responsibilities for Grants County, New
Mexico, becoming the first U.S. marshal to serve under
the newly implemented salary system. Prior to 1896 mar-
shals subsisted on an outdated fee system that had been
in place since the eighteenth century. Foraker was in-
strumental in professionalizing his deputies, requiring
them to be conversant in Spanish as well as act in a
professional manner. In return he gave them fixed
salaries and put an end to the old patronage system,
which saw politically motivated local sheriffs hindering
investigations. He served this office until 1912.
The New York City Police Department
After the return of the New York City Police
Department to city control in 1870, within a few
years the force would be reorganized and a new set
of standards implemented, including the requirements
that police candidates be U.S. citizens and residents of
the state for at least one year and not have a criminal
record. In 1874, the force was rewarded as “The
Finest.” Other innovations followed: telephone links
replaced the outdated telegraph system in 1880, a
central office was created for the Bureau of Detec-
tives, and four women joined the force as precinct
matrons in 1888.
However, a darker, more sinister side of the
police force was revealed in 1894, when a state
senate committee was appointed to investigate al-
leged abuses of authority by police. In 1894, the
Lexow Committee discovered a menu of bribes
for rising through the ranks of the New York
Police Department (e.g., $300 to be appointed to

the force) and an established system for shaking
down illegitimate businesses. Although numerous
officers were dismissed and the Tammany machine
was replaced by reform-minded politicians, there
were no enduring achievements, and just four years
later Tammany was back in the hands of the bosses,
and the police department had reverted back to its
former corrupt excesses.
In an era of corrupt cops, none was more unscrupulous
than Alexander “Clubber” Williams (1839–1910). Joining
the New York Police Department in 1866, the physically
imposing Williams earned the nickname “Clubber” for his
dexterity with a nightstick. On one occasion, he bragged,
“There is more law at the end of a policeman’s nightstick
than in any ruling of the Supreme Court.” In 1871, he was
promoted to captain and was later rewarded with a
transfer to the Tenderloin district, leading the colorful
cop to exclaim, “I’ve had nothing but chuck steak for a
longtime and now I’m going to get a little tenderloin.”
During his 11 years as captain in the area, he was accused
and exonerated of 18 brutality complaints. When the
Lexow Committee investigated him in 1894, it found that
on an annual salary of $3,500, he had amassed more than
$1 million in assets. His explanation for such wealth was
that he made savvy real estate investments in Japan.
Williams was forced to resign from the force.
In 1895, future president Theodore Roosevelt
(1858–1919) was appointed as one of four newly
installed police commissioners. Over the next two
years, he played an instrumental role in exposing
departmental corruption and rooting out unscrupu-
lous police officials such as Alexander “Clubber”
Williams. Roosevelt is credited with introducing
numerous reforms, including a promotion system
based on merit rather than patronage, more stringent
physical and mental qualifications, and more pro-
gressive recruitment. He hired the first female civil-
ian secretary and lobbied for Jewish officers to join
the mostly Irish-Catholic rank and file. Roosevelt’s
term as commissioner led to better police training, a
bicycle squad charged with traffic control, and more
efficient call boxes, and the .32-caliber revolver be-
came the standard on-duty sidearm.
In the late nineteenth century, police officers in
major urban centers were responsible for a number
of chores unrelated to law enforcement. Officers
were tasked with supervising the cleaning of streets
and providing shelter at the precinct houses. An old
tradition and the bane of urban reformers in New
York City was the continued use of precinct house
basements to accommodate the homeless and the
indigent. While the police referred to the basement
shelters as “lodging houses,” the homeless referred
to them as “green-light hotels,” alluding to the
green lights at the entrances to the precinct
houses.24 Without bathroom facilities or beds,
they were characterized by overcrowding and
poor hygiene, leading Peter Conlin, New York
City police chief, to characterize them as refuges
for the “lazy, dissipated, filthy, vermin-covered, dis-
ease breeding and disease-scattering scum of the
city’s population.”25
Social reformer Jacob Riis (1849–1914) publi-
cized these conditions as he accompanied Roosevelt
on midnight excursions to the seedier police pre-
cincts with the hope of exposing police corruption
and dereliction of duty. A Danish immigrant who

chronicled the plight of the underclasses in The
Children of the Poor (1892) and How the Other Half
Lives (1890). However, with few alternatives be-
sides the city streets to seek refuge and no other
social service institutions available, there were few
alternatives for the homeless besides the precinct
basements, where they would at least be sheltered
from the elements and street crime.
Department morale improved during Roosevelt’s
short tenure as president of the Board of Police
Commissioners from 1895 through 1897. During
this period, precinct house accommodations for
transients were replaced with separate lodging
houses, and a system for recognizing meritorious
police service was inaugurated. By 1897, New
York State Republicans had apparently wearied
of Roosevelt’s reform campaign and, to get him
out of office, reportedly arranged to have him
appointed assistant secretary of the navy.
The civil service reform taking place in New
York City in the 1880s was part of a national
movement led by middle- and upper-middle-class
men during the era. Targeting the spoils system and

political patronage, these reformers did their best
to break the ties between politicians and police
appointments. Some departments introduced pro-
cedures for appointments and promotions. How-
ever, politicians just as quickly found ways to
sidestep medical, physical, and writing tests. Since
writing tests were of the essay variety, examiners
had wide latitude in grading. In New York City,
there were cases of candidates astonishingly adding
inches to reach minimum height. On one occasion,
a prospective candidate was rejected twice for syph-
ilis, only to be accepted on his third try.26
The Pinkertons and Private Policing
During the nineteenth century, the history of pri-
vate policing is closely tied to the development of
the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. The
Pinkertons came to national prominence during
the Civil War, when they protected Lincoln from
an assassination plot, and then were employed as
counterespionage agents by the Union army. Fol-
lowing the war, Alan Pinkerton returned home to
Chicago and to new challenges, ranging from pur-
suing train robbers to violent labor strikes.
By the 1870s, the Pinkertons claimed to have
assembled the largest collection of criminal mug
shots in the world and created a criminal database
for their agents. As the American economy strug-
gled with the industrial upheaval of the late nine-
teenth century, the Pinkertons found themselves
increasingly employed by corporations as strike-
breakers, often leading to bloody conflict with or-
ganized labor. The most famous incident occurred
in 1892 at the Carnegie Steelworks in Homestead,
Pennsylvania. The veteran of more than 50 con-
frontations with labor by 1892, the Pinkertons’
most severe test would be the Homestead strike,
in which workers protested poor wages and other
concerns.
When negotiations with labor leaders broke
down at the Carnegie plant in June 1892, the com-
pany hired the Pinkertons to protect its factory.
The Pinkertons sent 300 men by barges up the
Monongahela River to the plant in July after pro-
labor elements took control of the land routes from
Pittsburgh. Waiting at the Homestead docks were
between 3,000 and 10,000 workers. Testimony
suggests that the strikers were unsure who was ap-
proaching, mistaking the approaching detective
force for an army of strikebreaking scabs. It is un-
known who fired first, but as the barges approached
land, gunfire was exchanged by both groups, leav-
ing three Pinkertons and 10 workers dead. The
Pinkertons were soon captured, and the strikers
took over the factory until the Pennsylvania Na-
tional Guard arrived several days later.
This incident was a major turning point in
Pinkerton’s policy for dealing with strikebreakers.
Henceforth, the agency avoided taking the offen-
sive in labor face-offs, instead opting to defend only
factories.
A
subsequent
investigation
into
the
Homestead affair awakened Americans to the
growth of the private police industry and tarnished
the image of the Pinkertons. The antidetective
mood that resulted from the carnage led to the pas-
sage of several anti-Pinkerton laws in the 1890s.27
Criminal Identification
While fingerprinting, DNA, and serology are stan-
dard methods of police identification in the twenty-
first century, before the 1880s there was no effective
system of classification or reference of criminals.
Large photo collections were amassed of convicted
criminals at various police headquarters, but the size
of these collections defeated their purposes. The
first police forces to make use of photographic ro-
gues’ galleries included New York (1858), Danzig
(1864), Moscow (1867), London (1870), and Paris
(1874). According to crime historian Luc Sante,
crime scene photography was first reported in
Switzerland in 1860.28
Chief of the New York Detective Bureau in the
1880s, Inspector Thomas Byrnes was the architect of
the New York rogues’ gallery, popularized with the
publication of Professional Criminals of America in
1886. By disseminating his collection of 204 tintypes
of celebrated criminals to the public, Byrnes hoped
he could not only advertise the exploits and cunning
of the New York Police Department but also help
the general public in the prevention and detection of

crime. Each photograph was complemented by bio-
graphical information and criminal records detailing
the methods used by specific bank robbers, forgers,
confidence men, shoplifters, and other crime specia-
lists of the era.
First used by the police of Paris in 1882, by the
following year the Bertillon system had been used
to identify 49 criminals. Named after its creator,
Alphonse Bertillon (1835–1914), the system required
the measurement of the width and length of the
head; the length of the left, middle, and little fingers;
the length of the left foot, forearm, and right ear; the
height of the individual; and the measurement of
the person while seated from the bench to the top
of the head. Other identifying characteristics included
scars, birthmarks, eye and hair color, and a description
of the nose. Bertillonage would be well regarded until
the 1890s, when fingerprinting replaced it, to the re-
lief of peace officers burdened by the laborious iden-
tification procedures it required. Bertillon’s system did
much to raise the standard of the inefficient and cor-
rupt police methods of the nineteenth century.
Born into a middle-class family, the son of a physician
with a keen interest in anthropology and statistics,
Alphonse Bertillon was drawn to the science at an early
age. In 1878, he found employment as a records clerk for
the Paris police, leading to a lifelong interest in identifi-
cations systems that would earn him the sobriquet the
“Father of Modern Detection.” Over the next seven
years, Bertillon developed a methodology to identify re-
cidivist offenders. Through the use of anthropometry, he
created a system that became known as “bertillonage,”
based on human body measurements, prior to the intro-
duction of a fingerprinting system. Subsequently, he
would add photographic methods to other identification
techniques and become an expert in using photography
to identify forged documents.
Prior to the twentieth century, there was no
reliable way to distinguish between the guilty and
the innocent.29 Perhaps the best-known system of
identification, fingerprinting took decades for law
enforcement to realize its value for crime investiga-
tion. With the recognition that no two fingerprints
are alike in the late nineteenth century, fingerprint-
ing became the identification method of choice
in tracking an increasingly mobile population of
criminals.30
As early as the 1820s, anatomy professor
Johann Purkinje noted that every person’s finger-
prints were unique. However, without any type of
classification system, this method of identification
was useless. By the 1850s, fingerprints were being
used by British magistrate William Herschel to pre-
vent the wrong people from fraudulently collecting
money on the dole. In 1880, Henry Faulds, a Scot-
tish physician working in Tokyo, exonerated a sus-
pected thief by comparing fingerprints left at the
crime scene with those of the suspect.
In the late 1880s, Sir Francis Galton attempted
to create a classification system and wrote the book
Fingerprints (1892). However, it would be left to Sir
Edward Richard Henry, inspector general of the
Nepal police, to grapple with the problem, and in
1896 he created an identification system on finger-
printing. That same year, Argentina became the first
country to base its identification system on finger-
printing. The adoption of fingerprinting finally
gave crime investigators the first reliable proof of
an individual’s presence at a crime scene.
The early 1900s saw fingerprinting receive in-
creased attention as the Bertillon system proved too
cumbersome and unreliable. Although the Bertillon
system had been widely accepted in the United
States in the 1890s, most chroniclers of the history
of criminal identification claim it faced its greatest
challenge in 1903, when a man named Will West
was arrested and sentenced to the federal peniten-
tiary in Leavenworth, Kansas. Despite his claims that
he had never been arrested before, his photograph
seemed to match that of a convicted criminal with a
similar name, and apparently so did his Bertillon
measurements. It turned out that there was another
man named William West incarcerated in the same
prison, with the same measurements, and bearing an
uncanny resemblance to the other Will West. The
only evidence that distinguished the two men was
their fingerprints. Many historians have exaggerated
the impact of this case on the transition from Bertillon
to fingerprint evidence. By the time of this case, the
reliability of the Bertillon system was already in
question. What’s more, according to one forensic

expert who investigated this case, “there is ample
reason to doubt the significance of the case with
respect to the establishment of fingerprint identifi-
cation in the United States” since Leavenworth
Penitentiary officials did not install the identification
system until the following year. Subsequently, fin-
gerprinting, together with photographs, would su-
persede the discredited Bertillon system.
Professionalism
In 1893, 20 years after the first meeting of police
chiefs in St. Louis (in 1871), Chicago hosted the
next national meeting of police chiefs. Of the
more than 50 who attended, most were from smal-
ler communities near Chicago, although represen-
tatives from Boston, Pittsburgh, and Atlanta also
attended. Among the topics discussed were civil
service rules for police, the adoption of police tele-
graphic code, and a uniform identification system.
The Chicago police chief could boast of having set
up the first Bertillon bureau in America. The Na-
tional Chiefs of Police laid the groundwork for
what would become the International Association
of Chiefs of Police in 1915. One of the more im-
portant resolutions approved at the meeting was an
agreement for jurisdictional cooperation between
different cities and states.
Southern Policing
With few historical studies of southern police forces
during the post–Civil War era, Dennis Rousey’s
examination of the New Orleans police is particu-
larly valuable for making any judgments about post-
Reconstruction southern policing. The end of
Reconstruction in 1877 saw the Democratic gov-
ernments of the South take back control of their
government, political, and social institutions. But
between 1868 and 1877, the percentage of African
Americans on the New Orleans police force ranged
from 65% to 28% by 1870, almost equal to its per-
centage of the black population. During the heyday
of Reconstruction, New Orleans had the “largest
integrated force in the urban South,” with its 182
black policemen “the largest contingent of black
policemen.”31 Although other southern cities also
were well represented with blacks during this
period, this was clearly not the rule throughout
the former Confederacy. For example, Charleston,
South Carolina, and Petersburg, Virginia, had well-
integrated forces, while Savannah and Richmond
had all-white forces.
The end of Reconstruction also put an end to
well-integrated policing in the South for the rest of
the nineteenth century. New Orleans would see few
appointments during the new era, and in 1880 the
number of black officers had fallen to 6.6%. Policing
in general would suffer in the South, as it reverted to
antebellum conditions that favored decentralization
and smaller police budgets. In New Orleans, munici-
pal allocations fell from $325,000 in 1877 to $171,000
in 1888. A reduction in police pay was accompanied
by manpower shortages contributing to a recurring
crime problem in many southern cities. According
to the 1870 and 1880 censuses, out of 18 major south-
ern cities, 15 saw reductions in police manpower.
With the weakest police force of America’s major cit-
ies, New Orleans was well on its way to becoming
one of the most inefficient forces in the land, a repu-
tation that has marked the force into the 1990s.
Compared to New York City and other north-
ern cities in the 1880s making major strides in
the direction of professionalism, “New Orleans in
most ways set an example for other cities not to
follow.”32 Here a patronage system continued to
determine the selection of police officers, resulting
in the ascendance of politically connected individuals
to the higher ranks of the police organization. But
New Orleans was not alone in its aversion to civil
service reform. It would not be until 1895 in Chicago
and 1905 in St. Louis that major steps toward non-
partisan government service reform were taken.
The West
During the 1870s, cattle towns popped up near the
intersections of Texas cattle drives and railroad
lines in Kansas. More primitive in most respects to
urban counterparts in the Northeast, these towns
soon developed similar criminal justice problems.
Towns such as Dodge City, Abilene, Wichita, and
176

Ellsworth offered liquor, prostitution, and gambling
in an attempt to lure cowboy dollars at the end of
the drives. Concomitant with the financial rewards
were the ever-present violence and disorder that
resulted. As the towns became increasingly complex
and diversified, they developed police forces, usu-
ally consisting of a marshal, assistant marshal, and a
varying number of police officers. The town mar-
shal’s jurisdiction ended at the town limits. Harking
back to Anglo-Saxon England, the county peace
officer was the sheriff. Both the county sheriff and
the town marshal were responsible for civil crimes,
leaving federal crimes to the U.S. marshal.
During the nineteenth century, four types of law
enforcement would predominate in the West, includ-
ing vigilance committees (particularly in mining
areas); legal citizens police, who were citizens serving
brief stints as deputies with county sheriffs or town
marshals; formal police; and parapolice, such as the
Pinkertons, who pursued the James–Younger gang.
West of the Mississippi River the main local law enforce-
ment officer was the town marshal, who functioned as
the chief of police, even if he was only a one-man police
force. Most nineteenth-century Western towns did not
appoint a marshal until the population was close to a
thousand residents. Unlike the Western peace officer of
popular culture, town marshals were more often ex-
pected to maintain town jails, collect taxes, serve civil
papers, protect property, and arrest the drunk and disor-
derly rather than engage in climactic gunfights on Main
Street. Over time, towns created police departments to
handle local law enforcement, although the Western
town marshal persists into the twenty-first century.
CORR ECTI ONS
According to prison historian Blake McKelvey,
prison populations in the North decreased during
the Civil War because of a combination of factors,
explaining that “the army had absorbed the potential
criminals, afforded a refuge for fugitives, or supplied
a convenient commutation of sentence.”33 During
this period, there were few complaints of prison
overcrowding or poor accommodations.
Meanwhile, in the South, the convict lease
system continued to predominate because of a
dearth in prison construction. The railroad, timber,
and mining industries benefited from an agreement
that often let them rent out gangs of prisoners to
toil where no free man would even contemplate
doing so, resulting in death rates that ran as high
as 40% per year.
The end of the Civil War and Reconstruction
witnessed a sudden increase in America’s state prison
populations, leading to a plethora of penal problems.
Massachusetts State Prison, for example, reported that
171 of the 247 convicts entering prison in 1866 were
veterans of the Civil War.34 Between 1870 and 1904,
the population of state prisons increased almost 62%.
Shortly before the outbreak of the war, the prison
population stood at almost 19,000, rising to 33,000
in 1870, 45,000 in 1890, and 57,000 in 1900. With
many model prisons deteriorating badly, including
Auburn and Eastern State, states resorted to modify-
ing existing structures and building new ones to
house the legions of new inmates.
The Reformatory Era
An increased emphasis on reform was a product of
the times, which saw the introduction of a more
therapeutic understanding of criminal behavior.
Lasting roughly from 1870 to 1910, the reforma-
tory movement in America saw numerous institu-
tions adopt indeterminate sentencing, parole, and
attempts at positive reform through education.
Building on the efforts of reformers Maconochie,
Crofton, and Wines, by 1869 23 states had adopted
“good-time” laws, which reduced prison sentences
for good work and deportment.
One of the most important prison reformers of
his era, Zebulon Brockway (1827–1920) captured
the attention of his fellow reformers in 1870 at the
National Prison Congress. The scion of a venerable
New England family, Brockway began his career in
corrections as head of a New York almshouse and
then of a penitentiary in Rochester. He came to
prominence following the presentation of his paper
“The Ideal of a True Prison System for a State” at
the 1870 National Prison Congress. His suggestions

for reform would resonate for decades. Although a
zealous proponent of indeterminate sentencing and
the classification of prisoners according to age, sex,
and offense, Brockway would not shy away from
life sentences for career criminals. The subsequent
adoption of a “Declaration of Principles” is testi-
mony to the impact of Brockway’s predilection
for religion, education, industrious work habits,
and the supervision of convicts following release.
The “Declaration of Principles” adopted at the
National Prison Congress represented an extraordi-
nary step in the direction of progressive prison re-
form. Among the improvements advocated by the
meeting were better sanitary conditions, the aboli-
tion of political appointment of prison administra-
tors, the progressive classification of prisoners based
on the mark system, rewards for good conduct and
work, and more stress on education.

19.
Recognizing that society is in part responsible for
creating crime conditions
Brockway was given a chance to put his propo-
sals into action in 1877, when he was appointed
superintendent of the newly created Elmira Refor-
matory. His tenure would allow him to incorporate
his many ideas, chief among them the indeterminate
sentence. With overcrowding the most prominent
problem plaguing prison officials in the late 1860s,
new institutions were built following the reforma-
tory model. Opening in 1876, the Elmira Reforma-
tory initially set the standard. Formerly a Union
prison camp, the state legislature consigned its noto-
rious wartime reputation to the past and recon-
structed the site as a model reformatory. Here,
first-time offenders between the ages of 16 and 30
were sentenced to a facility that placed more empha-
sis on education and trades training and offered early
release through the mark system, which offered
merits and demerits for progress and behavior.
Influenced by the current pseudosciences of
anthropometry and heredity, by the 1880s Brock-
way was ascribing the criminal tendencies of many
prisoners to heredity. He also took note of the in-
creasing population of European immigrants behind
the walls, noting that they “are to a considerable
extent the product of our civilization and also of
emigration to our shore from the degenerated
populations of crowded European marts.”35
Prison architecture between 1870 and 1900
continued to follow the Auburn pattern with few
modifications. Improvements included the intro-
duction of ventilating systems and steel cells that
offered plumbing and running water. However,
the bucket system of human waste disposal would
persist in dozens of prisons into the 1930s.
Increasing resistance to prison industries by orga-
nized labor began to affect convict labor systems,
causing many penal administrators to take note. Re-
sponding to claims that prison labor represented unfair
competition to free labor, many states passed laws in
the late 1880s prohibiting productive prison labor.

An integral part of the foundation of Elmira
was its emphasis on industrial labor. Brockway
found a loophole in the recent prohibitions by en-
tering a state-supply relationship with New York
that would allow his inmates to continue to pro-
duce goods, but only products that could be sold to
their state facilities or departments.
Despite overcoming numerous obstacles and
his noble intentions, by 1893 the Elmira Reforma-
tory was overcrowded, and Brockway’s propensity
for blaming criminality on low intelligence and
“physical degeneracy” lost him much of his former
support. An investigation the following year ex-
posed Elmira’s dirty little secret: the worst whip-
pings and physical punishment were administered
to boys suffering from mental and physical disabil-
ities. Brockway’s experiment never regained its
luster, and in 1900 he resigned his post.
Wayward Sisters
If there was one area that the National Prison Con-
gress failed to address, it was the incarceration of
female offenders, who until the 1870s were often
housed in the same prisons as men. While it en-
dorsed the creation of treatment-oriented prisons
for women, it would take until 1874 for Indiana
to open the first female-run prison in America.
During the early nineteenth century, women
were incarcerated in the same prisons as men. There
were few women convicts in this era, and to pre-
vent sexual dalliance, women were isolated. Most
women were arrested for minor crimes and were
usually held in county jails or houses of correction
rather than state prisons, where more serious offen-
ders were housed. During the first half of the nine-
teenth
century,
most
female
arrests
involved
prostitution, public inebriation, and petty larceny.
For example, Massachusetts did not record any
women in its state prison, although local jails re-
ported that women made up almost 20% of their
populations.36 In 1875, Massachusetts built the
Reformatory Prison for women, the second institu-
tion of its kind in America.
According to one reformer in the 1830s, there
were fewer than 100 women in prisons of the seven
most populous states. Ten years later, Dorothea Dix
counted 167.37 With typically fewer than a dozen
women in any prison, there were too few to devote
an entire wing to them, so they were usually
housed in large congregate rooms above either
the guardhouse or mess hall.38 With so much atten-
tion lavished on the more numerous men, the fe-
male prisoners were often neglected.
In 1839, New York’s Sing Sing Prison became
the first to establish a separate prison wing for
women, but it would be the only one until the
1870s. Women penal reformers were influential in
the founding of the American Prison Association
(1870). Many supported the notion of “social fem-
inism,” arguing that women had unique needs and
required prisons that could respond to their special
needs. As a result, more than 20 women’s reforma-
tories were built between 1870 and 1935.
New York established the Mount Pleasant Female Prison
in 1835. “Administratively dependent” on Sing Sing
Prison, it welcomed its first women prisoners in 1839.
According to historian Lawrence M. Friedman, its signifi-
cance lies in the fact that it was run exclusively by female
prison matrons for women.39 During its first decade,
prisoners labored under a tedious routine of “sewing,
button making, and hat-trimming.” Except for a brief
flurry of reform in the mid-1840s, when prison matron
Eliza Farnham abolished the rule of silence and initiated
a less punitive regime, conditions deteriorated because of
overcrowding. However, by 1846, a list of punishments
suggests that Farnham still relied on corporal punish-
ment, which included solitary confinement, the cropping
of hair, and utilization of gags and straightjackets. By
1865, Mount Pleasant was burdened with twice its ca-
pacity.40 In 1874, the Female Prison and Reformatory
Institution for Girls and Women, the first separate
prison completely devoted to women, was inaugurated
in Indianapolis, Indiana.
The opening of the Indiana Reformatory Insti-
tution in 1874 was the result of a crusade by social
feminists who campaigned for institutions suited to
the specific needs of female prisoners. One of the
main pressures for incarcerating women in reforma-
tories rather than prisons was the result of the
changing perceptions of female criminality in the
1870s. In the past, women prisoners were often

portrayed as depraved if not uncontrollable. But this
image began to undergo a transition as they became
increasingly viewed as “wayward girls” “who had
been led astray and could, therefore, be led back to
the paths of ‘proper’ behavior: ‘childlike, domestic,
and asexual.’”41 To adhere to this changing inter-
pretation, most reformatories selected first-time of-
fenders over hardened career female criminals.
One of the most prominent female prison re-
formers of the era was Katherine Bement Davis
(1860–1935). The Vassar-educated penologist and
social worker earned a PhD in 1900 and the fol-
lowing year was selected as superintendent of the
Reformatory for Women at Bedford Hills, New
York, where she earned a reputation as an innova-
tor in female penology. Over the next dozen years,
Davis experimented with a medical model of incar-
ceration and was instrumental in establishing a di-
agnostic laboratory of social hygiene that allowed
sociologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists to study
prisoners. An early example of the Progressive re-
former (see Chapter 9), Davis emphasized the role
of professionals in treating social problems, so after
the classification of offenders, those who were con-
sidered incurable were given life sentences, while
others entered treatment programs.
Probation
The origins of probation, or the use of a suspended
sentence, can be traced back to the English “benefit
of clergy,” by which a member of the ordained
clergy could escape the harsh penalties of the
day.42 Over time, this suspension of sentence was
extended to anyone who could read Psalm 21,
which acknowledged sin and promised reform.
Modern American probation has more in com-
mon with the informal practices that developed in
Boston in the 1840s. Considered the oldest form of
noninstitutional corrections in the United States, the
development of probation has generally been cred-
ited to John Augustus (1785–1859), a Boston cob-
bler. Augustus had an epiphany in 1841, when he
observed a man being sentenced in a Boston court-
room for public drunkenness. Surmising that the man
was of good character, Augustus posted bail and
promised the judge he would look after the man
until his hearing. Having abstained from drinking
for the following three weeks, when he appeared
before the judge for sentencing, the now sober citi-
zen was given a fine in lieu of more punitive treat-
ment. Augustus went on to spend many days in the
local courts and personally arrange bail and custody
for similar misdemeanants. During a 14-year period,
he bailed out close to 2,000 individuals, putting up
almost $250,000 of his own money as bail. His efforts
would lead the Massachusetts legislature to enact the
first Probation Act in 1878. By the twentieth century,
every state had passed similar probation acts. Con-
temporary probation officers continue to follow in
the footsteps of their nineteenth-century counter-
parts, using similar methods of investigation, screen-
ing, interviewing, and supervision.
Probation has remained popular for more than
a century, mainly because it is a cheap alternative to
incarceration. Some observers maintain that proba-
tion tends to “subvert the concept of fair justice.”43
There has tended to be an inherent class bias to this
punishment alternative, mainly because the criminal
justice system believes offenders who do not have a
criminal record or who appear better socialized are
better risks for probation than hardened offenders.
What often tips the scales in favor of one class or
another is whether someone can afford to make
bail, his or her criminal record, and physical appear-
ance at time of decision.
The Child Savers and the Birth of the
Juvenile Court System
Building on the Elmira Reformatory experiment,
Massachusetts (1874) and Rhode Island (1892)
passed laws authorizing separate trials for children.
Except for several other hesitant steps taken else-
where, until 1899 children in most states could be
arrested, detained, tried, and sentenced to adult
prisons. The establishment of the first true juvenile
court in 1899 gave the criminal justice system juris-
diction over neglected and dependent children and
those determined to be delinquent, the so-called
dangerous classes.

Until 1899, the treatment of juveniles corre-
sponded with that of adults. Outside of several “re-
form schools” and children’s aid societies, juveniles
were arrested, detained, tried, and imprisoned like
their adult counterparts. While some states pro-
vided institutions for juveniles, it would take the
“child-saving” movement at the turn of the century
to use the power of the state to save children from a
life of crime.
The child-saving movement was mainly the
purview of a group of well-educated, politically ac-
tive women from the middle and upper classes.
They were instrumental in providing the impetus
for the creation of a separate juvenile court system.
In 1899, Illinois approved the passage of the Juve-
nile Court Act, establishing the first comprehensive
system of juvenile justice (for children under age
16) and giving momentum to the development of
the modern juvenile justice system.
The predominance of middle-class women in the
child-saving movement coincided with an era when
middle-class women were becoming better educated
and enjoyed more leisure time, but because of the
social circumstances of the late nineteenth century,
there were few career avenues to follow. By the
turn of the century, middle-class women “experi-
enced a complex and far-reaching status revolution”44
as they championed the interests of children, the poor,
and immigrants—social outsiders whom many re-
garded as a threat to the new industrial order.
The child-saving movement was not without
its critics. Recent scholarship suggests that these re-
formers were tools of the “ruling class,” applying
the concept of parens patriae45 for their own inter-
ests, which included the control of the political sys-
tem, the continuance of the child labor system, and
the advancement of upper-class values.
CRIM E AND PUNISHM ENT
The urbanization of America during the last 40 years
of the nineteenth century created new problems for
urban police forces. As the ethnic makeup of cities
became more diverse, police work became more
complicated as well. Following the Civil War, most
of the Italian, Jewish, Chinese, and African American
newcomers moved into slums formerly dominated by
the Irish and now policed by Irish American officers.
But despite a cornucopia of endemic obstacles to
keeping the peace in the 1890s, including immigra-
tion, poverty, corruption, and overcrowding, murder
rates in cities such as New York were declining.
The most prominent criminals of the nine-
teenth century were the mythologized badmen of
the West. According to recent research, these indi-
viduals were indeed men but were probably not
much worse than others less well known. While
poems, plays, movies, and novels have made Wyatt
Earp, Billy the Kid, John Wesley Hardin, and the
James Gang popular culture mainstays, the most
wanted fugitives of the postwar era included Molly
Maguire’s assassin Thomas Hurley (according to the
Pinkertons) and Mormon leader John Taylor.
As train robbery, cattle rustling, and bank rob-
bery captured the attention of the public, the late
nineteenth century introduced the nation to Amer-
ica’s version of Jack the Ripper, except this time he
had a face and a name: Herman Webster Mudgett
(aka H. H. Holmes). As historian Roger Lane has
noted in his magisterial study Murder in America,
there were few known cases of multiple-sex mur-
ders (today better known as serial killings) in the
nineteenth
century.
The
34-year-old
Holmes
seemed a pillar of respectability during his years in
Chicago. However, following a trail of missing
bodies and fraudulent insurance claims, Holmes
was arrested for kidnapping and murdering three
children. He ultimately confessed to 27 murders
before being hanged in 1896.
Despite the sensational qualities of many post–
Civil War crimes and murders, homicide rates de-
clined as the country approached the 1900s.46 This
was in part a reflection of the role played by better
policing, temperance groups, and public schools that
led the vanguard in the battle for reform and order.
Criminalistics
The physician Cesare Lombroso (1835–1909) took
his first steps toward the development of a highly
controversial theory that would have profound

influence throughout the world of criminal justice
while he was still in the Italian army and noticed a
characteristic that distinguished the honest soldier
from his more vicious counterpart: “the extent to
which the latter was tattooed and the indecency of
the designs that covered his body.” Considered the
founder of the positivist school of criminology and
the “father of modern criminology,” Lombroso’s
theories owe much to Charles Darwin’s The Origin
of Species (1859) and The Descent of Man (1871),
which suggested that some men are closer to their
primitive ancestors than others. Earlier speculations
on degeneracy can be traced back to research con-
ducted in France as early as the 1820s.
Lombroso was consumed with resolving “the
problem of the nature of the criminal.” While per-
forming a postmortem on a noted Italian brigand,
Lombroso reached an epiphany that led him to build
on the work of earlier writers who suggested that
there was a relationship between the physical char-
acteristics of a criminal and his behavior. Lombroso
went on to collect a mass of evidence based on the
close examination of a number of criminals to sup-
port his theory that the criminal can be distinguished
from the noncriminal by a variety of physical anom-
alies that were of an atavistic or a degenerative ori-
gin. Arguing that some individuals were born
criminals, his conclusions would fly in the face of
penal reformers who argued that prisoners could
be reformed in the appropriate environment. In
1876, Lombroso’s L’Uomo delinquente (Criminal
Man) was published. Going beyond the theoretical,
Lombroso searched for practical applications for his
research. A proponent of postmortem examination
of criminal brains, he is credited with providing the
impetus for clinical criminology and the basis for the
methodology of cadaver identification later em-
ployed in the field of legal medicine.
Much of the work by the early criminologists
served as grist for the rise of racism in the nine-
teenth century as pseudoscience was used to explain
the
inequality
between
the
races.
Although
Lombroso’s work was not published in the United
States until 1911, criminologists throughout the
world had become familiar with his theories soon
after their initial publication in Italy.
There exists much debate regarding what ex-
actly Lombroso contributed to the field of crimi-
nology. Edwin Sutherland suggested in 1947 that
“by shifting attention from crime as a social phe-
nomenon to crime as an individual phenomenon, it
delayed for forty years the work which was in prog-
ress at the time and made no lasting contribution of
its own.” The contention that there is a criminal type,
demonstrable by certain physical dimensions—that
the criminal was identifiable on the basis of certain
cranial, facial, and bodily measurements—may have
seemed like a great advance in the late nineteenth
century. However, a growing number of dissenters
began to view crime as the product of certain so-
cial factors.
Lombroso was a visionary who shifted the fo-
cus of criminology toward the scientific study of the
criminal and the conditions under which a crime is
committed. His greatest contribution to the emerg-
ing discipline was his recognition “that it is the
criminal and not the crime we should study and
consider; that it is the criminal and not the crime
we ought to penalize.”47
Capital Punishment
Efforts to abolish the death penalty came to an
abrupt halt in the 1850s as reformers diverted their
attention toward slavery, the Civil War, and Re-
construction issues. Between 1865 and 1900, only
Iowa, Maine, and Colorado abolished the death
penalty, but all three would reinstate it within sev-
eral years, and only Maine would once more don
the abolitionist cloak for good beginning in 1887.
During the Progressive era in the first two decades
of the new century, abolition would once more
gain momentum.
The electrocution of William Kemmler in 1890
via the electric chair signaled a new phase in the
continuing search for a more effective and humane
means of execution. Convicted of an ax murder in
Buffalo, New York—which ironically prided itself as
the “electric city of the future”—Kemmler’s execu-
tion followed a decade-long debate over America’s
electric future involving Thomas A. Edison and
George Westinghouse. During the 1880s, both

men championed two forms of electricity that
they hoped would dominate homes and businesses.
Edison favored direct current (DC), which was
cheaper to install, and Westinghouse preferred alter-
nating current (AC), citing the danger of DC cur-
rent. With Edison on the verge of winning the
marketing war, the New York legislature made
New York the first state to approve electrocution
as its method of capital punishment; the chair re-
placed the gallows. Unfortunately for Edison, it
also demonstrated the killing power of DC, and
his rival’s AC current was adopted.
Similar to the adoption of lethal injection in the 1970s
and 1980s, a trend began following Kemmler’s execution
that saw other states adopt electrocution over the next
25 years, including Ohio (1897), Massachusetts (1901),
Kentucky and New Jersey (1907), Virginia (1908),
Tennessee (1909), North Carolina (1910), South Carolina
(1912), Arkansas (1913), and Pennsylvania (1915). By the
end of the 1920s, over half the states using the death
penalty were utilizing the electric chair.
One development that helped in the imple-
mentation of the electric chair was a movement to-
ward the “delocalization” of executions.48 This,
along with greater discretion in death sentencing,
occurred after the Civil War, when states began to
require that executions be performed under state
authority at one specific location. Between 1865
and 1900, 20 states made the transition from man-
datory to discretionary capital punishment, permit-
ting the jury to decide between death and alternative
punishments. The movement toward state-mandated
centralized execution began in 1864 in Vermont and
Maine. By the 1950s, however, there were still states
that continued to conduct executions under local
authority (Delaware and Montana).
Few constitutional challenges were directed at
the death penalty during the late nineteenth cen-
tury. In Wilkerson v. Utah (1879), a defendant
claimed that execution by firing squad violated his
protection against cruel and unusual punishment.
The Supreme Court upheld the death sentence,
citing the fact that this method had been used for
premeditated murder for years and was therefore
not unconstitutional. Ax murderer William Kemmler
also had his day in court (1890), citing the same
grounds under the Eighth Amendment. But again
the Supreme Court ruled against the defendant.
In this instance, the Court noted that “we think that
the evidence is clearly in favor of the conclusion that
it is within easy reach of electrical science at this day
to so generate and apply to the person of the convict
a current of electricity … to produce instantaneous,
and therefore painless, death.”49 As a postscript, the
current had to be applied two different times before
Kemmler was pronounced dead.
VI OLENCE
According to historian Michael A. Bellesiles, “The
cost of firearms continued to fall after the Civil
War,” reaching the point where most people could
“afford the so-called ‘suicide special’ of the 1890s.”50
Inexpensive guns were commonly used in the
commission of most murders and suicides during
this era and had become so ubiquitous that one
religious magazine was even offering a pistol with
the purchase of a subscription.51 In marked contrast
to the stereotype of the handgun-carrying South of
the twentieth century, it was illegal to carry a pistol
in one’s pocket in Louisiana between 1856 and
1885.52 While many citizens carried hidden weap-
ons for personal defense, New Orleans policemen
were prohibited by law from carrying concealed
guns into the 1890s. However, there were no
laws barring policemen and civilians from bearing
arms openly. In 1932, in the first scholarly study to
examine homicide from a national perspective,
H. C. Brearley asserted that the South was “that
part of the United States lying below the Smith
and Wesson line,” an assessment that holds true
for the region’s past and present.
Prior to the Civil War, few states had statutes regulating
the carrying of concealed handguns. By the 1920s and
1930s, some states had adopted the Uniform Act to
Regulate the Sale and Possession of Firearms, a model
law that prohibited unlicensed carrying of concealed

weapons. Most states affirmed provisions that allowed
sheriffs, judges, and police chiefs to issue concealed-
handgun permits to individuals who demonstrated a
legitimate need for this protection. Today, nearly one-
third of the states have adopted laws permitting citizens
to carry concealed firearms for protection.
Continuing a legacy of violence, the South and
the West continued to have the highest homicide
rates in the nation in the years between 1865 and
1915. A study of homicide in the Cumberland
Mountains for this period found a rate of 130 per
100,000, more than 10 times the homicide rate of
the 1990s.53 As early as 1880, journalist Horace
Redfield (1845–1881)54 noted the disproportionate
number of homicides in the South compared to
other regions of the country. While most studies
of southern violence attribute it to the enduring
notions of honor and a subculture of violence,
more recent studies link this preference for violence
to the fact that “much of the South was a lawless,
frontier region settled by people whose economy
was originally based on herding.” The authors con-
clude that most herding societies are “characterized
by having ‘cultures of honor’ in which a threat to
property or reputation is dealt with by violence.”55
According to homicide historian Roger Lane, per-
haps a more convincing explanation for the high
murder rates was poverty combined with “a tradi-
tion of weak government and law enforcement.”56
Historians continue to quarrel over the levels of
violence in the post–Civil War West. Scholars have
long argued that violence was not common in
the late nineteenth-century West. Beginning with
Robert Dykstra’s Cattle Towns (1968), which was
one of the first scholarly studies to proclaim that
the American West was not violent, most examina-
tions on this theme have been based on anecdotal
evidence and newspaper accounts, with little statisti-
cal sophistication.57 A recent study by historian Clare
V. McKanna Jr. challenges earlier studies that suggest
that homicide was not common in the American
West. By using quantitative methods and seldom-
used sources such as coroner’s inquests, criminal reg-
isters, and census data, McKanna argues that lethal
violence was indeed common in the American
West. Not just the bailiwick of the mythical gun-
fighter, he found that contrary to the prevailing be-
lief that western violence was usually episodic, it
occurred on a daily basis among “ranchers, farmers,
cowboys, coal and copper miners, bartenders, cooks,
butchers, gamblers, pimps, police officers, sheriff’s
deputies, town marshals, Baldwin-Felts detectives,
coal mine guards, roisterous drunks, teenagers, old
men—and occasional housewives and mothers.”58
Southern Reconstruction was accompanied by
violence on both a grand and a small scale. In some
southern states, racially mixed militias banded to-
gether to protect freedmen, while whites retaliated
with quasi-military organizations such as the Ku
Klux Klan. White supremacist–oriented organiza-
tions fomented race riots in many parts of the South
between 1868 and 1876. The end of radical Re-
construction in 1877 saw the withdrawal of Union
troops from the occupied South and the dissolution
of the mixed militias.
Lynching
The term lynching evolved from its colonial-era
meaning, which was associated with punishment
(typically not fatal) not sanctioned by law, to its
more sinister connotations reflecting unlawful sen-
tences of death by the 1890s. During the antebel-
lum era, lynching was most often used against local
whites who deviated from acceptable behaviors,
such as those who beat their wives and children
or subscribed to unorthodox beliefs or lifestyles.
After the Civil War, a shift occurred in which the
majority of lynching victims were people of color—
Asians, Native Americans, Chicanos—and only
occasionally whites.
According to the research conducted in the
1890s by black newspaper owner Ida B. Wells,
the overwhelming majority of cases involved the
hanging of blacks in the South. A leading voice in
the campaign against lynchings in the last decade of
the nineteenth century, Wells was drawn to the
cause when three of her friends in Memphis,
Tennessee, were murdered by a lynch mob. As
Wells became an investigative journalist and re-
former, she began to make the connection between
184

this utilization of ritualized violence and intimidation
and its goal of impeding the progress of African
Americans in their efforts to participate more fully
in the social, political, and economic life of the na-
tion. Violence authority Roger Lane explains that
the onus of Reconstruction fell so heavily on the
black population following the withdrawal of federal
troops in 1877 because “the place of African-
American men and women had not been fully
settled.”59 Wells began writing editorials condemn-
ing the terror of lynching and according to her bi-
ographer was responsible for a “significant migration
of thousands of African Americans to the West.”60
Wells studied white newspaper reports of
lynchings and found that during the 1890s, there
was an average of 188 lynchings per year, a number
exceeding legal executions by two to one. In a time
period when a charge of rape supplied the pretext
for a lynching, she found this charge was present in
only about 20% of the cases. A gradual decline in
southern lynchings would not begin until the
1920s, when a group of white southern moderates
organized the Commission on Interracial Coopera-
tion and used their influence to improve race rela-
tions in the South.
In stark contrast to the prototypical lynching,
the worst mass lynching of the century targeted
Italian immigrants in New Orleans following the
assassination of the city’s police chief, David
Hennessey, in 1890. In an era that found a wide
audience for the theories of Lombroso, the “Italian”
was assumed to display a tendency to criminal be-
havior. It was widely believed at the time that
Hennessey had been murdered by a Mafia faction
of a group of immigrant Italian dockworkers whom
he had provoked for some unknown reason.
In 1890, the country was witnessing one of its
periodic bouts with xenophobia that seemed to co-
incide with heavy immigration. Between 1870 and
1890, the Italian community grew from 3.2% to
10.5% of New Orleans’ foreign population. Follow-
ing the shooting, scores of Italian suspects were
rounded up. Nineteen were indicted. In the trials
that followed, suspects were acquitted, only further
antagonizing local leaders. Before all the men could
be freed, some more respectable members of the
community organized a mob of perhaps 10,000.
Reaching the jail, they unleashed their fury on the
11 Italians in custody (including three who had been
acquitted). Foreign opinion cited the incident as the
latest proof of American barbarism. The Italian gov-
ernment formerly protested the slaying of three of
the men who were Italian citizens and demanded
compensation for their families. The offer to pay
indemnities to the families by President Benjamin
Harrison in 1891 ultimately cooled the antagonism
between the two governments.
Despite its historical association with Chicago and New
York City, the Italian Mafia first made its appearance in
the New World on the docks of New Orleans. Sicilian and
Old World immigrants had been debarking at New
Orleans since before the Civil War. As the largest city in
the post–Civil War South, with its warmer climate and
Latin-Catholic culture it was a natural destination for
southern Italians. The heyday of the city’s Irish gangs
gave way to new immigrant gangs as the Irish were as-
similated into society, becoming contractors and entre-
preneurs. By the 1880s waves of new immigrants from
Italy and Sicily changed the demographics of the city.
New Orleans also became embroiled in anti-Italian bias as
newspapers and city rumor mills touted the presence of
sinister Italian gangs such as the Mafia and the Neapolitan
Camorra. Historian John S. Kendall suggested in 1939
that the first Mafia-related crime in New Orleans dated
back to 1878. Nonetheless, the fall-out from the murder
of police chief David Hennessey and the subsequent
lynchings of 11 Italians saw many of these immigrants
establish Italian communities in safer locales elsewhere.
Labor Violence
Prior to the Civil War, most labor violence oc-
curred along ethnic and racial lines. For example,
Irish canal workers rioted in response to mistreat-
ment at the hand of contractors. In other cases, Irish
workers came into conflict with free blacks com-
peting for unskilled jobs. After the war, the pattern
of labor violence changed. More urban and indus-
trialized by the 1870s, industrial conflict pitted or-
ganized labor against employers. The 1870s saw
workingmen attempting to organize for collective
action, igniting more than a half-century of violent
conflict with industrialists, their private armies, and
unemployed laborers used as strikebreakers.

In the coal fields of northeastern Pennsylvania,
the
secret
organization
known
as the
Molly
Maguires61 rose to prominence in the 1860s and
1870s as it waged a campaign of terror against em-
ployers. Predominantly Irish-Catholic, the so-called
Mollies found themselves at odds with their Protes-
tant bosses and neighbors over their perceived mis-
treatment. Unable to sustain a union organization
after a labor strike was broken in 1875, the Mollies
resorted to guns and dynamite and were eventually
charged with killing 16 men. Subsequently, a
Pinkerton
operative
named
James
McParland
(1844–1919) infiltrated the group. Thanks to his
testimony, 40 Mollies were arrested and charged
with various criminal acts. All were found guilty,
and 20 were hanged, half of whom were executed
on June 21, 1877, a date that became known in
the region as Black Thursday. The prosecution
of the Irish miners is shrouded in controversy
because the defendants were arrested by private
policemen and convicted on the questionable testi-
mony of informers and McParland, who was
labeled an “agent provocateur” by the defense.62
In a trial conducted in the most hostile of atmo-
spheres, the prosecuting attorneys were affiliated
with railroad and mining companies.
The year 1877 was a particularly violent one in
American history. Following on the heels of four
years of depression, the mood of the nation was
volatile as labor sought to unite against the mono-
polistic
corporations,
violence
and
lawlessness
erupted in the nation’s cities, and race riots, lynch-
ings, and government corruption made headline
news. During the ongoing economic depression,
unorganized railroad workers, protesting wage
cuts, the use of scab labor, and the probable loss
of their jobs, engaged in a series of destructive riots
that hit Baltimore and Pittsburgh with particular
ferocity. On the other side of the country, San
Francisco workingmen rioted in sympathy with
railroad strikers and engaged in hand-to-hand bat-
tles with the police and Chinese immigrants. Vio-
lence would continue to punctuate the 1880s and
1890s,
culminating
in
the
Haymarket
Square
bombing (1886) and the Homestead strike at the
Carnegie steel plant (1892). In 1894, a Pullman
strike led President Grover Cleveland to call in
federal troops over the protest of the Illinois gover-
nor. Perhaps overstating the explosive confluence
of troubles, historian Robert V. Bruce suggested
that “the upheaval was perhaps our closest brush
with class revolution in America.”
Anarchism spread to the United States in the late nine-
teenth century. The proponents of anarchism, or anar-
chists, supported the creation of cooperative societies
without any centralized government. Some anarchists
turned to violence and terrorism. Their most successful
operations were carried out in Russia in the years leading
up to the Russian Revolution (1905–1917). They were
responsible for the assassination of several European
leaders including Czar Alexander in 1881. American
anarchism was linked to labor violence and the legions of
impoverished European immigrants who felt oppressed
by the nativist American elites. By the 1880s Chicago was
a hotbed of anarchism and labor violence. Home to a
large population of German immigrants, many with a
radical bent, the Chicago Police focused much of their
counterterrorist activities on them before and after the
Haymarket Bombing of 1886. The anarchists regarded
them as their main adversaries. Newspapers also inflamed
public opinion demonizing anarchists as “Red Ruffians,”
“Dynamarchists,” and “bomb throwers.” One newspaper
even compared them to “plundering bands of Apaches.”
After the Haymarket Square bombing a “reign of terror
swept over Chicago,” according to one historian, as
police staged raids in working-class districts without
even producing a warrant. Suspects were arrested and
subjected to the “third degree” in police stations. From
then on the word anarchist became synonymous with
communism, terrorism, and dynamite.
In the social unrest that accompanied the labor
turmoil of the late nineteenth century, the police
often found themselves targeted for defending the
interests of big business and the “robber barons.”
Events in 1885 would precipitate one of the most
notorious acts of antipolice violence in American
history. That year, the Knights of Labor began a
series of strikes aimed at achieving an eight-hour
workday at the McCormick Harvester Works. Al-
most one-third of the Chicago Police Department
was stationed at the picket lines trying to protect
strikebreakers. At a large gathering of strikers at
Chicago’s Haymarket Square, an unknown anarchist
tossed a bomb into the crowd, killing seven police

officers and injuring 70 others. In an era of growing
radical politics, the incident struck a chord with the
public, who rallied to the police department. In the
weeks following the tragedy, tens of thousands of
dollars poured into a contribution fund for the vic-
tims. One authority has suggested that the hysteria
over Haymarket “gave the signal for the law and
order forces throughout the country to act.”63
NOTABLE TRIALS
Lizzie Borden Trial (1893)
In one of the most famous murder cases in Ameri-
can history, 32-year-old Lizzie Borden was indicted
for murdering her father and stepmother with an ax
in Fall River, Massachusetts. Her father was one of
the wealthiest and most influential members of the
community, president of the bank, and a stalwart
member of the business sector. At the time of the
murder, Lizzie still lived at home with her parents,
her older sister, and a servant girl. Although there
were no witnesses to the brutal ax slaying, attention
focused almost immediately on Lizzie because of
her cold and unemotional response to the incident.
At the time of the killing, only Lizzie and the ser-
vant were at home, with Lizzie contending that she
was in the barn at the time. Despite the conflicting
evidence, the presiding judge decided that there
was sufficient cause to hold Lizzie.
Lizzie was fortunate that she was rich enough
to hire a substantial defense that would eventually
include the Pinkerton Agency and a three-member
defense team led by the state’s former governor.
The defense team interviewed almost 110 panelists
before settling on 12 jurors: all farmers, all male,
and none from the town of Fall River.
According to the prosecution, there were a num-
ber of factors that would prove their case against
Lizzie, including that she did not get along with her
stepmother; that she had tried to purchase a deadly
poison from a drugstore the day before the murders
but was rebuffed because she lacked a prescription;
that there was no sign of a struggle or any property
taken, so the assailant must not have seemed like a
threat; that Lizzie apparently burned an ax handle and
concealed the ax blade from the probable murder
weapon; and that the servant was in her third-floor
room and Lizzie was downstairs alone with her father
and not in the barn. Without other inconsistencies, it
seemed that the prosecution had an airtight case.
The defense demonstrated how a man might
have hidden in the house. The jury was taken on a
walk-through of the house to become familiar with
the layout of the property. In the subsequent trial, the
defense was able to refute most of the evidence pre-
sented by the prosecution. During the seventh day of
the trial, medical witnesses explained how Mrs. Borden
was murdered at least an hour before her husband.
Noting Lizzie’s aloof disposition, her lawyers decided
against having her testify. In their conclusions, they
noted the lack of direct and circumstantial evidence—
no blood, no murder weapon, no motive, and no
exclusive opportunity since the prosecution could
not prove that Lizzie was not in the barn as she claimed.
The defense also explained that Lizzie was active in
many religious and charitable groups, loved her
father very much, and was not one to openly express
her feelings in public.
In the end, after the 13-day trial, the jury de-
liberated for one hour and ten minutes and re-
turned with a verdict of not guilty. Lizzie and her
sister inherited the father’s considerable estate and
attempted to live as normal a life as possible despite
an almost constant hounding by the press. Lizzie
died in 1927 at the age of 66.
This “crime of the century” continues to pique
the interest of true crime and mystery writers. Some
have offered alternative solutions, including the log-
ical question, Why not the servant girl? And why
the enduring interest in the murder? It had all the
familiar hallmarks of a classic murder: there was no
solution; the participants were wealthy, educated,
and of a high standing in the community; the sadistic
manner of the attack in an upper-class home in
small-town New England contrasted sharply with
the lower-class urban murder patterns of the day;
and it was a woman accused of such a deed.
In one examination of how gender, history,
and law entered into the arguments of the trial,
Janice Schuetz noted that the era of the Borden trial

was a “critical period in the definition of the role of
women.”64 With even the prosecutor telling the
jury that it was hard to conceive that a woman
could be guilty of such a crime, Lizzie Borden
owed her life to contemporary perceptions about
“true womanhood.”65 Not unlike today, patricide
by an ax-wielding woman sold newspapers. From a
criminal justice perspective, the Lizzie Borden case
has several implications. The case demonstrated that
an individual has the right not to testify and that this
cannot be used against the defendant. It also con-
stitutes a case of “trial by newspaper.” However,
unlike other murder cases that castigated the defen-
dant, such as in the Bruno Hauptmann, Sam
Shepard, and CharlesManson cases,most of the papers
presented a favorable impression of Lizzie Borden.
CONCLUSIONS
Late-nineteenth-century America was characterized
by unprecedented social strife. Between 1861 and
1900, America was racked by the Civil War, severe
economic depressions, massive immigration, and un-
foreseen advances in communication and transporta-
tion. Extraordinary urbanization and industrialization
transformed the country, leading to profound chal-
lenges to the ever-evolving criminal justice system.
As testimony to the progress of police reformers of
the late nineteenth century, American cities had be-
come much more orderly places than the antebellum
period as “daily life became more predictable and
controlled.”66 Others attributed the growing order
of urban life to the socialization skills provided by
public schools and industrialization.
Penal reformers during this era saw the imple-
mentation of indeterminate sentencing and education
at a time when the old methods of prison discipline at
Auburn and Eastern State were breaking down.
While both developments met with varying degrees
of success, they helped pave the way for new reforms
by modifying the thinking and the recognized objec-
tives of the Auburn system enough to make its puni-
tive methods of discipline more tolerable.
While penal and police reformers grappled
with the new realities of late-nineteenth-century
criminal
justice,
criminologists
and
scientists
attempted to adapt scientific methods to the study
of criminality. Rejecting many of the legal defini-
tions of crime, adherents of Lombroso and others
focused their attentions on the criminal act as a
psychological entity, emphasized determinism, and
believed that punishment should be replaced by a
scientific treatment of criminals to protect society.
Point–Counterpoint
Police Corruption in the New York City Police
Department (1894)
In late 1894, a committee was created to investigate corrup-
tion in the New York City Police Department. What would
become known as the Lexow Commission, after chair
Clarence Lexow (1852–1910), would discover a pattern of
bribery and corruption that extended throughout the depart-
ment. The most prominent target of the investigation was
Captain Alexander “Clubber” Williams (1839–1910).
The following testimony is taken from the hearings as
investigators try to figure out how he amassed more than
$1 million in assets on an annual salary of $3,500.
The second excerpt is taken from a 1913 investigation into
the family budgets of 100 patrolmen published in 1913. The
report makes clear in its summary of findings why graft and
bribery might be so enticing to the underpaid police officers. What
is unclear is why some officers were more susceptible to graft than
others. This summary of findings suggests that the environment
conducive for corruption had not measurably changed.
Alexander S. Williams, recalled and further exam-
ined, testified as follows:

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
1.
The policemen during the first two years of
service are underpaid.
The investigators’ visit to the homes of the
policemen who were in their first two years of
service, revealed conditions, of the most con-
vincing character in support of the contention
that they are underpaid. The attached exhibits
show that the average family budget for first
and second year patrolmen is, for family pur-
poses,—$871.46, and for police purposes,—
$218.12, a total budget of $1,089.58; that the
average patrolman’s apartment consists of four
rooms; that thirty-three families are without
baths; that the average number of children to a
family is two, and that the first year patrolman
contributes $16.85 to benefit societies and
$28.83 for insurance, the second year man
contributing $20.07 and $27.24 respectively for
benefit societies and insurance.
Attached to this report are also statements
made by policemen upon certain phases of
police work, such as fines, extra duties, etc.
2.
Of the $800 given the patrolman for his first
year’s service, the minimum amount he is
compelled to expend for uniform, equipment,
station house charges, and contribution to the
pension fund is $169.64, leaving him a balance
of $630.36. From this amount again, must be
subtracted approximately $73.72 which he is
required to spend for meals away from home. In
this connection it must be remembered that the
policeman is unable to carry his luncheon with
him as does the ordinary civil employee, and
therefore must, buy at least one meal a day
away from home. Assuming that the policeman
during his first year does not become a
member of any benefit or life insurance society,
loses no time through sickness, and suffers no
fines, he has at his disposal out of his $800 salary,
$556.64 with which to support himself and
family.
3.
The increases in salary which accrue during the
third, fourth and fifth year of the policeman’s
first five years of service, do not result in a

corresponding increase in income for his sup-
port and that of his family, because much of
this increase usually goes toward paying the
debts contracted during his first and second
years of service.
4.
The danger of increased indebtedness by reason
of possible fines is common.
The system of taking money out of the
salaries of delinquent policemen is uniformly
condemned by the members of the force. In
almost every instance it was the opinion of the
policemen that the system of fining was one
which resulted in disciplining the family rather
than the policeman, in that every dollar taken
from him, especially during his first year, meant
an added dollar of debt to the family, and
consequently an extra trip to the loan shark and
more frequently a visit to the pawnshop. In
fact, it was the experience of the investigators
that the pawnshop furnished in sixteen cases
the speedy assistance so necessary in emergen-
cies to the policeman’s little family.
In many instances patrolmen were ready to
cite examples of what they regarded as gross
injustices—the general complaint seemed to be
inconsistency in the matter of punishment for
the same type of offense. Believing the fine to
be an injustice, the policemen do not give their
best services to the city during the days on
which in reality they are serving the City
without compensation. In cases where the fine
is heavy, as for example 15 days, the hardship is
all the more severe, because the full amount is
deducted from the next check.
About half the families run monthly ac-
counts and pay almost entirely on the install-
ment plan. The first of each month finds many
collectors at the door of the policeman’s home,
and at the home where a 15-day fine has been
imposed the wife is unprepared to meet the
monthly bills. Next month, most of the bills
have doubled. From this financial difficulty
arises a natural condition of home worry and
discouragement which does not add to the
usefulness of the policeman to the city.
To emphasize the danger of the fining
system, one has only to add the possibility of
a doctor’s bill, due to a sick baby or a sick
wife.
The investigators also found in this con-
nection that the families of policemen were
denied treatment at the various dispensaries
and hospitals when they made known that
the father was a policeman.
5.
“Little encouragement but plenty of discour-
agement,” seemed to be the general feeling of
the policeman during his first few years of
service.
There is a widespread lack of enthusiasm
among the men, due to the absence of a merit
system which would reward for efficiency. At
present the delinquent policeman is punished
through his pocketbook, and there is no ap-
parent reward for efficiency except in the case
of demonstrations of physical courage. In other
words, there is no possible chance, even by the
most meritorious kind of police work, for the
policeman ever to get the money which the
department has taken away from him during a
possible period of delinquency.
6.
“No reward for overtime,” was another com-
plaint. In only one instance did the policemen
urge financial reward. The fact is that in the
course of a policeman’s work a great many
hours of extra service are required, due to
strikes, riots, parades, and time spent in court.
At present no amount of extra duty brings with
it any reward, either in salary, time off, or
merits. A great many policemen ventured the
opinion that if there were some system of
merits or reward for extra duty, especially with
regard to presenting cases in court, a greater
efficiency in the enforcement of law could
be had.
In many instances the policemen did not
hesitate to say that the human element entered
so strongly into the performance of their
duty that they hesitated to make an arrest when
this involved spending their day off in the
court.

NOTES
1. The Freedmen’s Bureau was created by Congress on
March 3, 1865. Originally called the Bureau of
Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, it was
charged with the task of guiding the transition of
African Americans into a life of freedom. The bu-
reau operated in all the southern states. Among its
most important responsibilities was taking over the
administration of justice for freed men and women
by establishing court systems responsible for the
protection of civil rights. By the early 1870s, the
bureau had lost most of its authority as former
Confederates returned to leadership.

author found high homicide rates. However,
McKanna (1997) finds fault with this examination
because it dealt with only a relatively short time
period, and at the end of McGrath’s study, the
author states that “in most ways the towns were not

The Progressive era (1890–1920) was a time of
tumultuous change as urban America tried to ac-
commodate waves of immigrants from eastern
and southern Europe and African Americans
fleeing the Jim Crow1 South. Despite tremendous
urban and industrial growth, unprecedented social
problems created deep anxieties among many
native-born Americans who lent their support to

immigration restriction and other exclusionary
policies.
Between the 1890s and 1920, a variety of Pro-
gressive reform efforts were directed at a nation in
political, social, and economic transformation. By
the 1920s, women had won the right to vote, and
electoral reforms were introduced that included the
secret ballot, direct election of senators, and a system
for recalling elected officials. Workers saw their lots
improve with the passage of the first labor protection
laws for women and children as well as the shorten-
ing of the workday from almost 14 hours to only 8.
Progressive reformers worked on many fronts
in an era when 1% of the country’s families owned
seven-eighths of the nation’s wealth. Meanwhile,
four-fifths of the nation’s population lived a mar-
ginal existence, presenting a remarkable juxtaposi-
tion to the opulent lifestyles of the captains of
industry, such as Andrew Carnegie, who earned
$23 million per year when the average workingman
brought home perhaps $500 per year.
For the middle classes, the increase in the cost
of living surmounted any advantages that may have
come their way as the country’s monopolies and
trusts flourished despite the passage of the Sherman
Act in 1890. It is estimated that almost three-
quarters of all trusts in 1904 were created since
1898, leading to decreased competition and a de-
clining faith in America as a land of opportunity.
Most of the problems that came to the public’s
attention were rooted in the so-called Gilded Age of
the late nineteenth century. Although reformers
had addressed many of the nation’s problems in
the previous decades, by the first decades of the
new century, reform became a national obsession
as diverse interests lent their voices in a call for
social change. Among the most vocal reformers
were investigative journalists known as “muckra-
kers,”2 who capitalized on the American fascination
with evil in a series of exposés published serially in
popular magazines. Among the most famous and far
reaching were Upton Sinclair’s description of the
appalling conditions in the meatpacking industry
published as The Jungle and Lincoln Steffens’s The
Shame of the Cities, which examined the crass urban
political scene.
Many of the reformers saw themselves as “pro-
gressives,” as they endeavored to reform the na-
tion’s social problems. They believed that injustice
and sin could be dispensed with merely through
new legislation. At the same time, they rejected
social Darwinist individualism and competition in
favor of social cooperation. In the process, a cornu-
copia of organizations were founded that reflected
the diversity of reform activity, including efforts for
safer working conditions, abolition of child labor,
shorter workweeks and higher wages, old-age pen-
sions, and workmen’s compensation.
Chief among the advocates for reform were
middle-class women and church-related organiza-
tions. They found expression in the creation of
the
Women’s
Christian
Temperance
Union
(1898) and the Anti-Saloon League (1893), which
waged a war against alcohol abuse. In little more
than 20 years, their crusade led to nationwide pro-
hibition with the passage of the Volstead Act in
1920. Urban reformers had long recognized the
consequences of alcohol consumption, including
social problems, such as accidents, pauperism, and
domestic violence.
The legislation of morality grew to include the
sexual sphere, as opponents of prostitution found
expression in the red-light-abatement movement
and the passage of the 1910 White Slavery Act, or
Mann Act. While prostitution was seen as a social
evil because of its association with the sexual ex-
ploitation of women and its links to venereal dis-
ease, others linked prostitution and alcohol abuse to
rising immigration from eastern and southern
Europe.
Progressivism
was
concerned
largely
with
mounting urbanization and the modernization of
America as small-town governments attempted to
confront rapid population increases. Formerly reli-
ant on political machines to provide the most-
needed services, by the turn of the century most
of these were on their last legs—corrupt and ineffi-
cient. Progressive social reform aimed at control
and justice, and the criminal justice system in par-
ticular would benefit from Progressive concerns
over problems of political patronage. In the process
of breaking up the political machines, the informal

welfare systems that helped the poor were disman-
tled. It soon became apparent that the states would
have to become more involved in solving the pro-
blems of the cities.
One of the major goals of the Progressives was
workmen’s compensation and better working
conditions. No event symbolized this concern to
America at large more than New York City’s 1911
Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire, in which 147
mostly female employees lost their lives. A subse-
quent investigation of the Manhattan fire discov-
ered that the women were locked inside to
prevent them from leaving early and that many
of the fire escape ladders were missing. This trag-
edy only emphasized the escalating number of
industrial accidents. Over the next five years,
more than half the states would enact worker’s
compensation laws.3
Further complicating the development of the
criminal justice system in the early twentieth cen-
tury was the immigration of more than 12 million
people to America between 1890 and 1910. In
1910, fully one-seventh of the population was
foreign-born. Of the Irish, Germans, Russians,
Polish, Slavic, and Italians who thronged urban
America, the Irish were the most politically signifi-
cant, in part because of their literacy and English-
speaking skills. Abandoned by the formal political
system, immigrants rapidly fell into poverty and un-
der the influence of corrupt political bosses and their
city machines. Immigrants were quickly branded
with stereotypes. Jews were scorned as anarchists,
while Italians fell under the specter of the Mafia
and the Black Hand. Mobs targeted European immi-
grants as well as African Americans, although the
brunt of the violence fell on America’s impoverished
classes. According to sociologist Mark Colvin, “The
Progressive movement, and much of what occurred
in the arena of criminal justice between 1900 and
1920, must be understood within [the] context of
rival orientations and divergent interests of a native,
white, Protestant, urban middle class and an ethnic,
non-Protestant, urban working class.”4
Resentment of the new immigrants translated
into immigration-restriction legislation, beginning
with America’s first federal law to check the
immigration of a specific ethnic group in 1882,
when the Chinese were excluded for 10 years.
Nativist and racist violence broke out over immi-
gration, while the Ku Klux Klan reorganized and
the Immigrant Restriction League emerged as a
powerful voice of nativism. Not everyone who
came to America would stay, with anywhere from
a fourth to a third returning to their native lands.
THE LAW GIVERS
Progressive reform moved to the national level
during the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt
(1901–1908). From his experience as New York
City police commissioner in the 1890s Roosevelt
became a supporter of centralized law enforcement.
He chose the Treasury Department’s Secret Service
as the preferred agency for launching federal crime
investigations. However, Congress balked at this
and enacted legislation prohibiting Treasury detec-
tives from being employed by other government
departments, including the Department of Justice.
In response the president ordered the attorney gen-
eral to “create an investigative service within the
Department of Justice subject to no other depart-
ment or bureau” and was only answerable to the
attorney general. The creation of the Bureau of
Investigation as an agency of the Treasury Depart-
ment in 1908 led the federal government to expand
its role in law enforcement, a trend that continued
into the 1930s and 1940s. Joining in the spirit of
Progressive reform, Congress passed the White
Slave Traffic Act in 1910 and the Harrison Narcotic
Act in 1914 to attack the “moral evils” of prostitu-
tion and narcotics addiction. Influenced by the
publication of The Jungle, Congress passed the
Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection
Act, both on the same day in 1906.
The passage of congressional legislation in
October 1917 signaled the beginning of a new era
of persecution in America, leading to the criminali-
zation of certain unpopular political views. In June
1917, Congress passed the Espionage Act, which
authorized postal officials to ban newspapers and
magazines from the mails and threatened individuals

convicted of obstructing the draft with $10,000 in
fines and 20 years in jail. The Sedition Act of 1918
made it a federal offense to use “disloyal, profane,
scurrilous, or abusive language” about the Consti-
tution, the government, the American uniform, or
the flag. More than 2,100 individuals were prose-
cuted under these acts as civil rights fell victim to
the power of the state.
By 1915, the American divorce rate had be-
come the highest in the world, with one out of
seven marriages ending in divorce. In California,
the rates were even higher, with one out of five in
Los Angeles and one out of four in San Francisco.
In an attempt to stop this growing trend, a number
of state legislatures stepped in, passing laws raising
the marital age of consent, prohibiting common-law
and interracial marriages and polygamy, and impos-
ing new physical and mental health requirements.
Various states established separate family courts to
handle cases dealing with desertion, child abuse,
juvenile delinquency, and divorce. Some states
strengthened divorce legislation by requiring longer
residence requirements before a divorce could be
granted. There is little consensus as to why the
American divorce rate increased during the Victo-
rian era. Explanations ranged from a decline in fam-
ily values and the liberation of women to the
chauvinism
of
men
and
the
pressures
of
urbanization.
The White Slave Traffic Act
The passage of the White Slave Traffic Act, or the
Mann Act, in 1910 was the culmination of Progres-
sive reform efforts to legislate morality at a time
when middle- and upper-class Americans felt threat-
ened by waves of new immigrants who were rapidly
changing the demographics of urban America.
Under the direction of the Department of Justice,
between 1910 and 1920, 2,801 individuals were
convicted of violating the Mann Act. No case epit-
omized the Mann era more than the prosecution of
the African American world heavyweight boxing
champion Jack Johnson (1878–1946). Born into a
large, poor family in Galveston, Texas, Johnson ran
away from home at a young age and by his teens had
gravitated to boxing. Blessed with natural athletic
ability, Johnson honed his fighting skills, leading to
his entrée into the world of professional boxing. His
lavish tastes and flaunting of the color barrier in an
age of segregation did not deter his winning the
world heavyweight title in 1908. Soon the boxing
world was searching for a “great white hope” to
dethrone the black champion.
Refusing to accept his place in segregated
America, Johnson’s unconventional behavior and his
well-chronicled involvement with white women
generated racial prejudice, and soon federal authori-
ties targeted Johnson for violating the 1910 Mann
Act, which prohibited the interstate transportation
of women for immoral purposes. In 1912, Johnson
was charged with sending money to a white girl-
friend to meet him in another state. Apparently irked
at Johnson’s having married another woman, she
claimed that he had taken her across state lines for
prostitution and other immoral purposes. However,
in this case, historian Lawrence M. Friedman sug-
gested he was arrested for “crossing color lines, not
state lines.”5 Nevertheless, in 1913 he was convicted
of trafficking in white slavery and was sentenced to
one year in prison. While out on bail, Johnson and
his wife fled the country for Europe and did not
return until 1920. On his return, he surrendered to
the authorities and served eight months of a one-
year sentence in federal prison.
In September 2008 the U.S. House of Representatives re-
commended granting Jack Johnson a presidential pardon
for the “racially motivated conviction” that ended his
boxing career and tarnished his reputation. The House
Resolution, which passed by voice, noted that Johnson’s
prosecution was “prompted by his success in the boxing
ring and his relationships with white women.” It re-
quested that then-President George W. Bush award the
boxing champ who died in 1946 a posthumous pardon.
This pardon was left undone at the end of the Bush ad-
ministration. In December 2009 the U.S. Justice Depart-
ment declined another attempt at a pardon, noting that
it was not general policy to process posthumous pardon
requests, but was more inclined to use them for those
who are living and “can truly benefit from them.” How-
ever, President Obama still has the authority to grant a
pardon to anyone he wishes.

The Sullivan Law and
Handgun Legislation
While firearms came to America with the first
European settlers, it was not until the twentieth
century that a concern over firearms entered the
national consciousness. A new approach to gun
ownership came into conflict with the traditional
right to bear arms at the moment that law enforce-
ment adopted new methods of enforcement and
gained new insights into police science and crimi-
nology. Legal journals soon were awash in articles
examining the Second Amendment and its implica-
tions for criminal justice. The avalanche of articles
such as “Is the Pistol Responsible for Crime?” co-
incided with a rising concern over new societal de-
mographics as the complexion of urban America
was altered by the influx of immigrants from south-
ern and eastern Europe and African Americans from
the Jim Crow South.
In 1910, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Bronx re-
ported a combined 177 murders by firearms, with
less than half the perpetrators arrested.6 That same
year, 912 arrests were made for carrying concealed
weapons in the same cities. The following year,
handgun legislation was discussed by New York
politicians, including Senator Timothy Sullivan.
Opposition soon came from familiar opponents of
gun control—arms manufacturers, hardware deal-
ers, and pawnbrokers. Despite the opposition, crim-
inal court judges and the city’s leading newspapers
publicly supported gun control measures. After
Sullivan delivered a rousing speech to the state leg-
islature, the senate passed a bill that was signed into
law by the governor. Similar attempts were made to
pass legislation in adjacent states, but all were
unsuccessful.
Hand gun control in America continues to be a hotly de-
bated issue into the first decade of the twenty-first cen-
tury. There is still no national consensus and most support
for weaker gun controls still comes from the western
and southern states. As 2009 moved toward conclusion,
Tennessee was at the forefront of states seeking to
slacken gun laws by giving handgun owners the right to
carry them onto sports fields and recreation areas.
According to a national review by the Associated Press,
over the past two years 24 states (mostly South and West)
passed 47 laws that loosened gun restrictions. Various
state legislatures have ruled that legal firearms owners
can carry guns in cars, prohibit asking job candidates if
they own guns, and have expanded protocol allowing
permits to carry handguns to be valid in other states be-
sides the one it was purchased in. In stark contrast to this
trend, a 1959 Gallup survey found that 60% of Americans
favored banning handguns except for “police and other
authorized personnel.” Today most states allow handgun
permits for individuals without criminal records or mental
health problems.
Drug Laws
In 1900, American officials estimated that there
were between 250,000 and one million addicts of
opium and its derivatives in the country, leading
one authority to describe America as “a nation of
drug takers.”7 With a total population of 76 mil-
lion, this would be the equivalent of one person out
of 400. Opiates in this era were unadulterated and
would probably kill today’s average heroin addict.
Although public concern about drug addiction
peaked in the first two decades of the twentieth
century, these years were crucial in shaping future
American drug policy. More recent studies by
David Courtwright and Mike Gray suggest that
the number of American “dope fiends” has been
exaggerated and that the typical addict was “a
middle aged southern white woman strung out on
laudanum,” a potion of opium and alcohol. By
most accounts addiction had actually peaked in
the United States by 1900.
In 1906, the Pure Food and Drug Act imposed
federal standards on the patent-medicine industry.
Three years later, Congress restricted the importa-
tion of opium except for certified medical purposes.
Progressive reformers remained unsatisfied, de-
manding a codified, nationally applied antidrug
law. Their idealized society would not tolerate
drug addiction, just like it would not tolerate alco-
hol abuse and political patronage. Reflecting the
concerns of Progressive reformers, on December 17,
1914, President Woodrow Wilson signed into law
the Harrison Narcotic Act. In contrast to alcohol
prohibition, there was little political debate over

the act. Primarily a tax law, the act made it unlawful
for any “nonregistered” person to possess heroin,
cocaine, opium, morphine, or any of their pro-
ducts. Drug enforcement began the following
year, resulting in 106 convictions.
Between 1916 and 1928, the vaguely written
Harrison Act was the subject of a number of impor-
tant Supreme Court decisions. One of the most
prominent was the 1919 Webb et al. v. United States
case. This decision developed out of a case in which
a Memphis doctor and a druggist were indicted for
conspiring to violate the Harrison Act by prescrib-
ing morphine only to addicts so that they could
maintain their addiction. The high court examined
the question as to whether this was allowable under
the act and decided against the complainants. This
decision had the long-range effect of ruling that
providing drugs to an addict “not as a ‘cure’ but
to keep the user ‘comfortable by maintaining his
customary use’ was a ‘perversion’ of the meaning
of the [Harrison] act.”8
The climax of a generation of concern about
drug addiction, the Harrison Act did not stop drug
addiction but did make it a more difficult habit to
maintain. Once the new antidrug laws went into
effect, drug addicts were forced into treatment.
The focus would shift to alcohol in the 1920s.
The Eugenics Movement
Best known to criminalists for developing the mod-
ern science of fingerprinting, Sir Francis Galton is
also responsible for founding the eugenics9 move-
ment in the early twentieth century. Galton’s bio-
grapher claims that his support for eugenics was
rooted in a sense of the superiority of his own family
and social class.10 Building on Cesare Lombroso’s
biological theories of criminality (see Chapter 8),
by playing on the fears evoked by the “new danger-
ous classes,” eugenicists were responsible for the
forced sterilization of hundreds of thousands of
people in America and elsewhere.
In her social history of biological theories of
crime, Nicole H. Rafter argued that between
1875 and the 1920s, “born-criminal theories incor-
porated popular hereditarian explanations of social
problems and significantly affected public policy.”11
Coming at a time of intense immigration from east-
ern and southern Europe, the goal of eugenics was
to “improve” the human genetic stock. Many of
the assumptions about the quality of the new im-
migrants were based on test scores that suggested
that immigrants scored poorly on IQ tests (usually
because their English was limited and they had a
poor knowledge of American customs).
In 1907, Indiana became the first state to make
sterilization official policy, noting that “heredity
plays a most important part in the transmission of
crime, idiocy and imbecility.”12 Each Indiana insti-
tution that housed “unfit” inmates hired two sur-
geons to its staff. California implemented a law that
would “asexualize” prisoners convicted twice for
sexual offenses beginning in 1909.
Proponents of eugenics became less prominent
in the 1920s as the Progressive movement ebbed
away. In 1921, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled
that forced sterilization denied “due process.”13
Rafter suggested that with “middle class authority
once again secure,” there was less reason to pursue
the goals of eugenics. She further argued that the
most important legacy of eugenic criminology “lies
in the structuring of social values and assumptions
about what is good or bad (for example, our society
values intelligence).”14
Following Galton’s death in 1911, his views
about the desirability of eugenics flourished in the
United States. By the 1930s, more than half the
states had passed forced-sterilization laws aimed at
those regarded mentally, physically, or even morally
and socially unfit.15 In 1942, the Supreme Court
finally ruled against sterilizing criminals in the
case of Skinner v. Oklahoma. According to the
Oklahoma Habitual Criminal Sterilization Act, if
an individual was convicted three or more times
for “felonies involving moral turpitude,” the defen-
dant could be sterilized. After Skinner was arrested
for the third felony, he was sentenced by the state
to undergo a vasectomy. However, the Supreme
Court ruled against the statute, stating that it vio-
lated “the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.”16 According to this line of reason-
ing, only certain crimes, such as robbery, were

punishable by sterilization, while others, such as
embezzlement, were not. Despite this ruling, spo-
radic sterilizations continued into the 1970s.
The Red Scare
America’s entrance into World War I in 1917 saw a
backlash against the German American community.
Teaching the German language was banned in
schools. Beethoven and Bach disappeared from
symphony programs, and temperance leaders used
the fact that most brewers were of German nativity
to help push through the Eighteenth Amendment.
The passage in quick succession of the Espionage
Act (1917), the Sedition Act (1918), and the Alien
Deportation Act (1918) elevated pacifism and gov-
ernment criticism to acts of sedition. Beginning in
1917, Bureau of Intelligence agents raided the head-
quarters of the radical International Workers of the
World (IWW) in 24 cities, suspecting the union of
supporting the enemy war effort. In Chicago alone,
100 IWW members were put on trial for violating
wartime statutes. The IWW would never recover
from its attacks during World War I. According to
one Justice Department official, its main goal was “to
put the IWW out of business.”
Although many observers hoped the judicial
system would protect dissenters, the court system
came down hard on IWW members, better known
as “Wobblies.” Even Oliver Wendell Holmes, the
Supreme Court’s leading champion of civil rights,
approved attacks on civil liberties as he upheld the
Espionage Act in Schenck v. United States in 1919 by
comparing the denial of free speech during the war
to the prohibition against “a man falsely shouting
fire in a theater and causing panic.” However,
Holmes reversed himself by arguing against the
Sedition Act later that year in Abrams v. United
States, but he was outvoted seven to two.
In the summer of 1919, federal, state, and local
government agencies targeted a wide range of radi-
cal activists fearful of a Bolshevik-style revolution in
the United States. The subsequent “Red Scare” was
ignited by the successful Bolshevik revolution in
Russia and postwar labor unrest, which included
the 1919 Boston police strike and several bombing
campaigns. On the night of June 2, 1919, a bomb
was exploded in front of the residence of the new
attorney general. Attorney General A. Mitchell
Palmer and his assistant, future FBI director John
Edgar Hoover, would lead the federal attack on
radical activists. Wartime legislation allowed the
federal government to repress criticism of the war
effort. Consequently, hundreds of foreign-born
anarchists, socialists, and communists were deported
in the summer of 1919.
In August 1919, Attorney General Palmer ap-
pointed Hoover to lead the recently organized
General Intelligence Division. It was here that
Hoover demonstrated his proficiency for collecting
data and names of enemies. Setting up a card index
system listing every radical leader, organization, and
publication in the United States, by 1921 Hoover
amassed a file of 450,000 names.17 It was during this
period that Hoover discovered what he thought
was a worldwide communist conspiracy as well as
justification for the raids.
The following year witnessed nationwide raids
on IWW halls and offices sympathetic to the com-
munist cause. Palmer’s raids led to thousands of
arrests, but his star began to dim because of criticism
of his unconstitutional methods, and with it went
his presidential ambitions. According to Hoover
historian Curt Gentry, “The antiradical crusade
had been, from its inception, an antilabor crusade”
that played on nativist fears. In the end, Palmer lost
the support of big business because the new restric-
tive immigration quotas threatened to end the sup-
ply of cheap foreign labor and the Red Scare “was
no longer good for business.”18
Weeks v. United States (1914)
In 1914, Fremont Weeks was convicted for illegally
using the mails. His conviction for promoting an
illegal lottery through the mails was based to a great
extent on information found in his home by police
officers who lacked a search warrant. These papers
were turned over to the U.S. marshal, who made
another search of his home and found more evi-
dence, again without a warrant. Despite Weeks’s
petition to have the documents returned to him
204

and his attorney’s objections, he was convicted.
The Supreme Court subsequently overturned the
conviction on the grounds that their seizure vio-
lated the Fourth Amendment protection against
illegal search and seizure. This ruling established
what has become known as the “exclusionary
rule,” which disallows the use of illegally obtained
evidence in a criminal trial.
The Weeks v. United States ruling had a pro-
found impact on the admissibility of evidence
seized by police in federal trials. Before 1914, viola-
tions of the Fourth Amendment’s protection against
unreasonable search and seizures were perceived as
common-law trespassing. To keep the seized evi-
dence from being admitted at trial, the defendant
only had to petition for the property to be returned
and then sue the responsible police officer for da-
mages. In 1914, the Supreme Court held for the
first time that a violation of the Fourth Amendment
in itself could justify excluding evidence from trial.
One of the most vexing judicial obstacles for police
officers today, after Weeks v. United States only
property that was legally owned by the defendant
and that the defendant specifically requested to be
returned could be excluded from the case.
Although this was a landmark case, its greatest
limitation was that it did not apply to the states.
However, in a practice known as the “silver plat-
ter,” if state or local police conducted the search
and turned over otherwise illegally obtained evi-
dence to federal officials, the evidence was declared
admissible. This exception to the exclusionary rule
meant that local prosecutors could use illegally
seized evidence in trials under state law (if state
laws allowed it).19
LAW ENFOR C EM ENT
During the first decades of the twentieth century,
the world of work began to change, thanks to the
influence of radical politics and unionization. While
police work had more responsibilities than most
jobs, it shared many of the concerns of other
wage-earning occupations. In the early 1900s, the
typical patrolman worked 12-hour days and was
remunerated with low wages. Between 1910 and
1920, policemen began to take an active role in
creating labor unions and police organizations. In
1915, two veteran Pittsburgh police officers were
inspired to create an organization for the social
welfare of police known as the Fraternal Order of
Police (FOP). To assure the mayor of their nonra-
dical intentions, they promised that the word strike
would be omitted from any references to the na-
scent organization since, as police officers, they
were “obligated to protect life and property.”
With the support of the mayor, within months
the FOP had 600 members in Pittsburgh. FOP
grew into a national organization over the next
several decades. While other police organizations
were subsequently created, efforts at unionization
lagged behind.
The police crusade for better working condi-
tions reached a crescendo of sorts in 1919, when
the Boston police force went on strike. As part of
one of the most underpaid and overworked urban
police
forces,
the
average
Boston
policeman
worked between 73 and 98 hours per week for a
yearly salary of less than $1,300. With salaries aver-
aging roughly 25 cents per hour, this amounted to
half the wage earned by workers in war-related fac-
tories. Morale had plummeted to an all-time low
by 1919. Precinct houses were in dismal condition,
and political patronage ran supreme as politicians
continued to promote political cronies over more
qualified officers who had demonstrated their pro-
ficiency on promotional exams. In addition, police
officers were still required to perform tasks unre-
lated to law enforcement.
In 1919, a Boston police fraternal organization
known as the Boston Social Club petitioned the
American Federation of Labor for a charter. This
led Edwin Curtis, the commissioner of police, to
issue a proclamation prohibiting union membership
among his rank and file. When the union refused to
disband, Curtis fired 19 officers. In response, 1,117
of Boston’s 1,544-member force went on strike.
The resulting crime wave and civil disorder led to
the creation of a volunteer civilian force that re-
sorted to physical violence to suppress the outbreak
of crime. The strike and subsequent disorder lost

any public support that the police may have gar-
nered. All the striking police were eventually fired,
and a new force was recruited. It set back the police
union movement until the 1960s.
Civilian Police Reformers
Police professionalism developed along two fronts
in the early 1900s. While reform-minded police
chiefs such as August Vollmer and Richard Sylvester
received much of the credit for police reform,
civilian police reformers such as Leonhard Fuld,
Raymond Fosdick, and Bruce Smith placed their
stamps on law
enforcement agencies as well.
Although Fuld (1883–1965) lacked a police back-
ground, this Columbia University–trained lawyer
wrote one of the first comprehensive and readable
studies of police administration. His prescient vision
for policing forecast many of the Progressive reforms
that would characterize policing in the coming years,
including a better use of police discretion while
performing daily duties, more stringent hiring
requirements, and a recognition of the dangers of
political patronage. Fuld also recommended better
police training in the proper use of deadly force
and
better
systems
for
scrutinizing
police
misconduct.
At the urging of John D. Rockefeller Jr.,
Raymond Fosdick (1883–1972) embarked on a
study of European police systems that resulted in
the 1915 publication of European Police Systems.
His study of virtually every major European police
force fostered an image of a professional brand of
policing that outshone the decentralized and more
amateurish American counterparts. Fosdick would
publish a complementary volume titled American
Police Systems in 1920. Following a study of 72
urban police forces, the author concluded that
American policing was victimized by a lack of pro-
fessionalism and rife with political corruption. The
publication of his work created a backlash from
the American police establishment but also led to
reform efforts in many cities.
In 1916, Bruce Smith (1892–1955) began his
career as a police consultant and criminologist
when he was hired by the New York Bureau of
Municipal Research and studied the Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania, police department. After stints with
the National Crime Commission and several other
criminal justice associations, Smith devoted the re-
mainder of his life to surveying police departments.
Following an extensive study of European police
procedures, he was instrumental in creating the
Uniform Crime Reports in 1930. Over the next
25 years, he would become the country’s foremost
expert on police operations as he helped improve
many forces, including those in Chicago, Baltimore,
San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia.
Police Professionalism
As the twentieth century approached, urban gov-
ernment increasingly came to grips with the parti-
san manipulation of police agencies. Following
several police scandals and the sensational revela-
tions gleaned from the Lexow hearings, New
York City finally abolished the police board in
1901 in favor of a single commissioner, appointed
by the mayor for a five-year term. According to the
new system, the police commissioner could be re-
moved from office at any time by the mayor or
state governor. During the first two decades of the
twentieth century, of the 52 cities with populations
exceeding 100,000, only 14 still used police
boards.20 Boston followed the lead of New York
in 1906, Cleveland and Cincinnati in 1908, and
Buffalo in 1916.
Efforts to replace partisan police boards with
professional chiefs of police were an important first
step toward police professionalism. During the Pro-
gressive era, police reform advocates such as Fosdick
and Fuld made a point of comparing the early
twentieth-century unprofessional American police
administrators with their European counterparts.
Among the new crop of professional police commis-
sioners influenced by Progressive police reform efforts
was Arthur Woods (1870–1942). The Harvard-educated
Woods joined the New York City detective bureau in
1907. After studying European detective bureaus while
pursuing postgraduate work, Woods returned to the
United States and became a protégé of Theodore Roosevelt.
Woods was appointed deputy police commissioner and

then police commissioner of the 10,000-man New York
City Police Department in 1914. During his tenure, he
vigorously attacked the vice problem but made his
greatest contributions in the realm of police training
and professionalism. Influenced by Scotland Yard and
other European police organizations, Woods intro-
duced a homicide clinic and psychopathic laboratory to
train homicide and sex crime investigators and estab-
lished the first school for patrolmen, a precursor of
the city’s police academy.
August Vollmer, the police chief of Berkeley,
California, became one of the preeminent propo-
nents of police professionalism during the Progres-
sive era. Among his earliest achievements was
establishing a department code of ethics that barred
the acceptance of gratuities and favors under pen-
alty of dismissal.
Vollmer rose to prominence for his require-
ment that prospective police officers pursue a col-
lege education in an era when a high school
education was not even required by most depart-
ments. Vollmer set up the first formal training
school for policemen in 1908, and over the follow-
ing decade, departments in New York City,
Detroit, and Philadelphia established similar training
academies. In 1916, Vollmer was instrumental in
creating the first university-level police training
school at the University of California, Berkeley.
Vollmer’s other innovations included rigorous
in-service training and probation for first-time of-
fenders. He was the first police executive to cham-
pion the lie detector as an investigative tool and in
1922 implemented a single fingerprint classification
system. Vollmer was instrumental in inaugurating a
series of innovations during his tenure as police
chief, including the first modus operandi system
(1906) and the first motorcycle patrol (1911) as
well as many others. By 1914, Berkeley’s police
force was the first in the country to be completely
mobile, with all officers patrolling in automobiles.
Officers were expected to provide their own cars,
but the city paid them for their use, thus saving the
city budget a huge outlay at one time. Vollmer’s
emphasis on scientific policing, education, higher
standards, and the centralization of police services
still influences the role of police in society.
Considered the father of the modern police organization,
August Vollmer was born in New Orleans in 1876. After a
stint in the military, in which he distinguished himself in
combat during the Philippines campaign of the Spanish–
American War, he settled in Berkeley, California. In 1905,
he was elected city marshal and four years later began a
24-year career as the city’s police chief. In 1907, he was
elected president of the California Chiefs of Police and in
1922 accepted the presidency of the International Associa-
tion of Chiefs of Police (IACP). In between teaching at the
University of California and running his police department,
Vollmer was called on to reorganize a number of police
departments, including those in San Diego (1915); Los
Angeles (1923–1925); Havana, Cuba (1926); Kansas City
(1929); and Minneapolis, Minnesota (1930). The author and
coauthor of numerous books and articles, his best-known
work includes The Police and Modern Society (1936).
Following in the footsteps of other reform-
minded police managers in the Progressive era,
Fred Kohler (1869–1933) took over the Cleveland
Police Department, a force with a reputation for
corruption, in 1903 and placed his stamp of reform
on the force. Among the reforms implemented by
Kohler was a “sunrise court,” which allowed minor
offenders to get to work on time through quick
processing following a minor violation and there-
fore keep their jobs.
In 1908, Kohler introduced his “Golden Rule
Policy,”21 which dealt more informally with juve-
nile offenders. Although he claimed it was his own
innovation, this policy was probably the 1907
brainchild
of
Toledo,
Ohio,
Mayor
Samuel
“Golden Rule” Jones and his police chief.22 By
diverting minor offenders out of the formal criminal
justice system, courts could concentrate on more
serious matters, and the offender would avoid stig-
matization. Kohler’s strategies were viewed with
skepticism from some quarters, but Theodore
Roosevelt thought he was the best police chief in
America. Kohler’s career came to an abrupt end in
1913 when he was forced to step down after an
extramarital affair became public knowledge. His
legacy was further tainted when it was revealed
that he delivered a plagiarized speech to the IACP
in 1912 and when after his death his safe deposit
box was found to contain half a million dollars in
probably illegal payoffs.

Federal Law Enforcement
Created in 1870, the Justice Department by the
Progressive era would also be responsible for inves-
tigating antitrust violations, fraudulent land sales,
crimes on Indian reservations, the shipment of sto-
len goods from one state to another, and violations
of national banking laws. Without a federal police
organization, the Justice Department had to borrow
investigators and special agents from other depart-
ments, including Customs, the Department of the
Interior, and the Treasury Department. With the
ascendance of former New York City police com-
missioner Theodore Roosevelt to the presidency in
1901 after the assassination of President McKinley,
America now had a chief executive familiar with
criminal justice issues. In 1905, Roosevelt appointed
fellow Progressive Charles Bonaparte (grandnephew
of the French emperor Napoleon I) as his attorney
general.
Among Roosevelt’s earliest actions in this arena
was requesting funds from Congress to hire a detec-
tive force for the Justice Department. Despite the
opposition of those who feared that a bureau of
investigation would be used for political reasons,
the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) was officially in-
augurated by the attorney general in 1908 when he
appointed a small force of special agents (in the
1930s, Congress would change its name to Federal
Bureau of Investigation).
The early activities of the BOI were rather lim-
ited since the number of federal crimes was much
smaller than in succeeding years. Most investigations
focused on banking, naturalization, antitrust, and
land fraud. The passage of the Mann Act in 1910
expanded the activities of the BOI when it was
made a crime to transport women over state lines
for immoral purposes. In 1919, the passage of the
National Motor Vehicle Act, better known as the
Dyer Act, added the transportation of stolen auto-
mobiles over state lines to the BOI’s responsibilities.
America’s entrance into World War I in 1917
led to an expansion of the BOI, which grew to 600
agents and support staff with field offices in major
cities and along the Mexican border. During the
war, the BOI assumed additional duties with the
passage of the Espionage, Selective Service, and
Sabotage Acts. Just three months after America en-
tered the war, an ambitious young attorney named
John Edgar Hoover (1895–1972) began working
for the Justice Department. Hoover’s meteoric rise
through the department would lead to a 50-year
career as head of the FBI, beginning in 1924. In
the 1920s, the bureau was plagued by problems
shared by most civil service agencies. Promotions
were based on seniority instead of merit, and inves-
tigations were inefficient. When Hoover took over
in 1924, he established rigorous rules of conduct
and procedure for all agents and investigations and
instituted a promotion system based on merit.
U.S. marshals became increasingly involved in
law enforcement in the years surrounding World
War I. The passage of the Espionage and Sedition
Acts in 1917, which set limits on the right of free
speech, required marshals to enforce measures
aimed at public opposition to the war. Marshals
were also expected to arrest violators of the Selec-
tive Service laws.
The passage of the Volstead Act in 1919 inau-
gurated the Prohibition era. Despite the availability
of Prohibition agents to enforce the laws, the mar-
shals of the Justice Department would be saddled
with conducting arrests and investigations and seiz-
ing breweries and other bootlegging equipment.
State Police
The first decades of the twentieth century saw the
creation of numerous state police forces. Some,
such as the short-lived New Mexico Mounted
Police and the Arizona Rangers, were inspired by
the Texas Rangers. The Arizona Rangers were in-
augurated in 1901 after a consortium of Republican
cattlemen, mine owners, and railroad officials con-
vinced the territorial governor that a force modeled
on the Texas Rangers was required to dispatch the
growing lawlessness in Arizona. Shortly after its cre-
ation, Democrats complained to the governor that
the Rangers were all Republicans. The patronage
issue would creep into any discussion of the Ran-
gers. The demise of the Rangers was the result of
several developments. While opposition to the
208

force revolved around its payroll and expenditures,
it seemed that the force worked itself out of a job
when only two dozen arrests were reported in just
more than eight years of existence. In 1909, the
Arizona Rangers were disbanded following an
anti-Ranger campaign led by county sheriffs and
district attorneys.
The Arizona Ranger legacy suggests that they
had much better relations with the Mexican gov-
ernment than with their Texan counterparts. Un-
like the relationship between the Texas Rangers
and the Mexican Rurales, the Arizona Rangers co-
operated with the Mexican government, which
permitted them to launch manhunts and extradite
criminals to the United States. Ultimately, in 1912
Arizona achieved statehood, and a highway patrol
was created in 1931. As with past mounted police
forces, the introduction of the automobile, rapid
population growth, and political infighting signaled
the end of the Arizona Rangers. The New Mexico
Mounted Police was established in 1905 “for the
protection of the frontier.” However, this organi-
zation would be dissolved after persistent friction
with local law enforcement.
A new era of state policing was launched in
1905 with the creation of the Pennsylvania State
Police. Following a half century of rural crime, in-
dustrial disorder, and ethnic conflict, widespread la-
bor strikes continued to paralyze the Pennsylvania
economy. In the late nineteenth century, immi-
grants from eastern Europe and Italy were drawn
to the mining country once dominated by Irish,
English, and Welsh miners. In 1902, Pennsylvania
took steps toward creating a state police force based
on the Royal Irish Constabulary and Philippines
Constabulary military models.
Under the command of Spanish–American
War veteran John C. Groome, the 220-man force
was selected from the ranks of the armed forces and
required to be unmarried and live in barracks.
While they were charged with policing the entire
state, for the most part the force patrolled the
immigrant-dominated mining districts. Mounted
on horses and equipped with carbines, pistols, and
riot batons, they were compared by opposition
groups to the nefarious Cossacks of Russia.
Supporters saw the force as protecting the coun-
try against foreigners, labor agitators, and people of
color, as the state police often were embroiled in
jurisdictional disputes with local police. As the labor
strikes of the 1910s diminished, the state police be-
came more involved in rural crime and traffic pro-
blems as well as enforcing Prohibition laws.
After reading about the “heroic” exploits of the
Pennsylvania State Police, former New York City
police commissioner Theodore Roosevelt lobbied
the state legislature to contemplate a state police
force on the Pennsylvania model, and in 1917 the
New York State Police was established. The New
York legislature had considered a state police force
for years prior to 1917, in part because of the suc-
cess of the neighboring state police force as well as
the inadequacy of New York’s rural police. Amer-
ica’s entrance into World War I in 1916 apparently
provided the impetus for the force. A large force of
232 men and officers, like its neighbor, was com-
manded by a superintendent appointed by the gov-
ernor. Unlike its neighbor, however, it developed a
rapport with organized labor because it was not
imbued with the powers to suppress riots in cities
without the approval of the governor and was not
used for strikebreaking. In addition, it had the
power to arrest, without warrant, anyone violating
state or federal laws throughout the state.
The emergence of the New Jersey State Police
force in 1921 is considered a turning point in the
history of American state policing. The impetus for
its creation was the ineffectiveness of county law
enforcement and a rash of violent industrial disor-
ders between 1910 and 1915. Between 1915 and
1923, 27 states would create some type of state
police force. While some states created highway
patrols in response to increasing popularity of the
automobile, others adhered to the Pennsylvania
paramilitary model of policing.
Women and Minorities
The first female police officers were hired in the
early twentieth century. While most female partici-
pation in law enforcement was limited to serving as
matrons in jails in earlier years (since 1845), in 1910

Alice Stebbins Wells became the first full-time paid
policewoman in America (according to a recent
biography of Lola Baldwin, this claim has been
brought into question, but although Baldwin was
sworn in as the “nation’s first municipally paid
policewoman”23 in 1908, Wells is still widely
considered the nation’s first policewoman).24
A strong advocate for women in modern police
work, Wells lobbied Los Angeles social and political
leaders before obtaining her appointment. Accord-
ing to her job requirements, she was expected to
“enforce laws concerning dance halls, skating rinks,
penny arcades, picture shows, and other similar
places of recreation; the suppression of unwhole-
some billboard displays; and maintenance of a gen-
eral bureau for women seeking advice on matters
within the scope of the Police Department.”25
Over the next five years, 25 cities appointed police-
women to the forces. Initially, policewomen were
expected to repress dance hall vice,26 help children,
and return runaway girls.
One of the early pioneers in female law enforcement,
Lola Baldwin was working for the Portland, Oregon, Na-
tional Traveler’s Aid Association in 1905, when she was
asked to perform protective work on behalf of women
attending the city’s Lewis and Clark Exposition that year.
She performed her duties with such distinction that when
the fair ended, she continued to provide the same ser-
vices for women visitors to Portland and was eventually
given police powers by the Portland police. She focused
much of her energies on closing down saloons and
brothels. By 1913, she held the rank of captain, and she
directed her officers to prohibit young women from
working in sordid environments such as pool halls and
bowling alleys. During her long career with the organi-
zation, she outlasted six police chiefs and five mayors but
was never officially referred to as a policewoman. How-
ever, her biographer considers her the “first female po-
lice agent hired under civil service in the United States.”
Author Gloria E. Myers claims that many firsts attributed
to Alice Stebbins Wells are “easily discredited by
Baldwin’s ample records.”27
In
1915, the
International
Association
of
Policewomen (IAP) was established, leading the
effort to include more women in policing. According
to recent research, while this meeting in Baltimore
“was
the
point
at
which
the
policewoman
movement became self aware,” its success was the
result of Lola Baldwin’s work with women’s orga-
nizations and social service agencies.
By the end of World War I, 220 cities across
the nation employed 300 policewomen, including
Georgia Robinson of the Los Angeles Police
Department in 1919, the first African American
policewoman. In 1920, the IAP was encouraging
women police candidates to pursue college educa-
tions to join police departments, but as late as 1950,
according to the U.S. census, women made up only
1% of the nation’s police force.
African Americans found many obstacles to en-
tering law enforcement. In 1900, police forces were
overwhelmingly white, with blacks making up only
3% of urban police forces. Those African Americans
that were fortunate enough to find employment of-
ten faced hostility and were usually placed in black
communities. The career of Samuel J. Battle
(1883–1966) offers a glimpse at early twentieth-
century policing. Battle became the first African
American on the New York City police force in
1910 but was given the silent treatment by officers
for his first year. It was not until he saved the life
of a white officer during a race riot that he won
acceptance from his peers. Battle eventually became
the first black sergeant on the force and continued
to march through the ranks, rising to parole com-
missioner in 1941. Despite Battle’s inspiring story,
few African Americans found success on American
police forces until after World War II, with most
relegated, like women, to secondary status.
The son of former slaves, Samuel Battle moved north to
escape segregation. Early on, he set his sights on becoming
a police officer, a rare accomplishment for an African
American in turn-of-the-century America. While working
grueling 12-hour days as a porter in New York City, Battle
prepared for the civil service exams that were required to
join the police force. He passed the exam in 1910; none-
theless, administrators vacillated on whether to hire him.
Battle endured a year of silent treatment and ac-
cepted his rejection while flourishing as a police officer
consigned to the African American community. Despite
passing the sergeant’s exam, he was forced to wait seven
years before becoming the first black sergeant on the
force. Battle would make headlines in 1943 when Mayor
Fiorello La Guardia authorized now parole commissioner

Battle to quell race riots in Harlem following a police
shooting of a black youth. His influence in the black com-
munity helped end the disturbance in short order. Retiring
in 1951, Battle was honored in a special ceremony in 1964
as “the father of all Negroes in the Police Department.”
Private Police
In the years before an effective federal police appa-
ratus and the birth of the FBI, banks, railroads, and
other enterprises often avoided local law enforce-
ment by hiring private agents to cross jurisdictions
to apprehend wide-ranging criminal gangs, such as
the James Gang and the Younger brothers.
A variety of private police services were estab-
lished during the early twentieth century to com-
pete with the Pinkertons and traditional law
enforcement. Among the most prominent was the
Burns National Detective Agency, the brainchild of
William John Burns (1861–1932), who had served
a stint with the U.S. Secret Service in 1889. He left
government employ to cofound the Burns and
Sheridan Detective Agency, which was operated
like the Pinkertons as a quasi-private police force.
After buying out his partner and shortening the
agency’s name, regional offices were opened across
the nation. However, the Burns agency came under
heavy criticism for its unpopular support of big-
business interests against labor unions. Despite
such controversy and Burns’s heavy-handed inves-
tigation of the 1910 bombing of the Los Angeles
Times building, the agency prospered, and Burns
returned to government service in 1921 to head
the fledgling Bureau of Investigation, the precursor
to the FBI. Although he would win acclaim for
successfully prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan in the
1920s, his mishandling of the Teapot Dome scan-
dal, involving the sale of federal oil leases to private
interests for profit, would force Burns to resign in
1924 and return to private life.
Technological Innovations
Although the call box, telephone, and telegraph
had made the transition to police stations prior to
the 1900s, technological advances in the new
century would transform American policing. In
the years following the war, the teletypewriter
evolved into a “police workhorse” as it was used
for printing telegrams. By 1911, police could trans-
mit a facsimile photo of a criminal from one city to
another (telephotography). Transportation technol-
ogy would see police officers make the transition
from bicycle “scorcher squads” to the motorcycle
and automobile. By the 1920s, many cars would be
equipped with radios, although the two-way radio
would not be installed until the 1930s. The authen-
tication of fake documents, fingerprint classifica-
tion, and the modern polygraph would round out
the new police technology.
CORRECTIONS
Chief among the criminal justice–oriented reform
movements of the Progressive era were attempts to
transform the prison system. According to historian
Larry E. Sullivan, during this period “criminal justice
was largely taken out of the hands of judges and
prosecutors and given over to bureaucrats, psychia-
trists, social workers, and professional penologists.”28
In this new climate, the important correctional in-
novations of probation, parole, and indeterminate
sentencing flourished. Beginning in the 1840s, pro-
bation took years to gain widespread acceptance.
Only six states had statutes offering this alternative
in 1900, but within a decade all the northern states
outside New Hampshire had adopted it. Over the
next five years, the majority of western states
adopted probation as well.
Explanations for the popularity of probation in
these years revolved around the Progressive predi-
lection for community improvement, hence the use
of supervised freedom over incarceration. Other
explanations suggest that it was cheaper to use pro-
bation instead of incarceration.
The beginnings of parole can be traced back to
Alexander Maconochie’s mark system in the 1840s,
in which prisoners had to work through various
stages to win release. By 1900, more than half the
states offered some form of parole or indeterminate
sentencing alternative. Unfortunately, parole boards

created to decide each case became increasingly po-
liticized and inefficient. According to one estimate,
in 1920s New York, the state board gave only five
minutes to each case.29
Throughout the first decade of the twentieth
century, yearly prison congresses gave rise to a number
of new recommendations for prison reform. In 1908,
the American Prison Association was created. Here
was a forum for experts to debate the evils of the
southern lease system and to discuss European devel-
opments that revolved around the causes of crime and
the fate of discharged inmates. Occasionally, debate
would degenerate into acrimony as European crimin-
ologists belittled the American efforts at reform that
elucidated new theories of crime causation and crimi-
nal types. At the same time, England was developing
the Borstal system for the care of offenders under 21
and applying Elmira-like control.
America’s state prisons saw their inmate popu-
lations swell by 62% between 1870 and 1904.
However, this would be only a precursor to the
tremendous increase in population over the next
three decades. According to the Bureau of the Cen-
sus, state prisons experienced an unprecedented
162% population growth between 1904 and 1935.
During this era, 10 new prisons based on the Auburn
design were built, and one following Jeremy
Bentham’s panopticon model was constructed at
Stateville, Illinois, in 1925.
The reformatory prison movement peaked in
1910. Although several prisons were inspired by the
Elmira pattern over the next 20 years, the reform
movement had reached an impasse. During the first
25 years of the new century, American prison pol-
icy relied on total control, punishment, and hard
labor. With less emphasis on classification, moral
instruction, and education, prison practice seemed
to have drifted back to a nineteenth-century policy
that was custodial, punitive, and financially produc-
tive. This period has been referred to as the indus-
trial period for its concentration on producing a
wide range of products for government consump-
tion in prison factories. The military, public, and
state government sectors in regions outside the
South provided a ready market for prison-made
materials. Paralleling the growth of prison industry
was a steady breakdown in the former silent system
as some American correctional practices made a sig-
nificant departure from the formerly punitive re-
gime. Emphasis was shifted from strict discipline
and negative sanctions, such as corporal punishment
as well as religious instruction, education, and trade
training, and refocused on promoting parole in re-
turn for good behavior.
Thomas Mott Osborne and the
Mutual Welfare League
One of the most controversial prison reformers of
the early twentieth century, Thomas Mott Osborne
(1859–1926) was the Harvard-educated scion of a
wealthy manufacturer. Following graduation from
college, Osborne entered local politics in Auburn,
New York, where he was elected mayor in 1903. It
was natural that he would take an interest in prison
reform in one of America’s leading prison towns.
By 1906, he had developed a keen interest in re-
form and addressed a meeting of the National
Prison Association, where he expounded his notion
that “prison must be an institution where every
inmate must have the largest practical amount of
individual freedom, because it is liberty alone that
fits men for liberty.”
Osborne was given a chance to put his philos-
ophy to the test in 1913, when he was appointed
chairman of the New York State Commission for
Prison Reform. To prepare himself for the task, he
served as a convict under an alias for a week behind
the walls of Auburn Prison. The following year, he
published an account of his experience in his book
Within Prison Walls, which he used to illustrate the
weaknesses of a current prison regime that stamped
out individuality and destroyed manhood. The erst-
while reformer claimed that while he was behind
bars, an inmate offered him a plan for limited self-
government. Osborne based his Mutual Welfare
League experiment on this advice, and on his ap-
pointment as warden of Sing Sing Prison in 1914,
he instituted a system of self-government that was
fashioned to give inmates a sense of corporate re-
sponsibility that, it was hoped, would aid in their
subsequent rehabilitation.

Osborne’s penchant for criticizing political
overseers of the prison system earned him a number
of enemies who mounted a campaign against his
administration. Although charges of perjury and ne-
glect of duty were never proven, he resigned as
warden in 1916. Over the next four years, he con-
tinued his efforts at prison reform, leading to the
founding of the Welfare League Association, which
helped recently discharged prisoners, and the crea-
tion of the National Society of Penal Information, a
clearinghouse for data on prison conditions.
The Federal Prison System
Prior to the late nineteenth century, prisoners con-
victed of federal crimes were housed in state prisons.
Initially, state prisons were given boarding fees and
were allowed to use federal prisoners in the prison
labor system, including the leasing system. Between
1885 and 1895, the number of federal prisoners
more than doubled. But by 1887, Congress was be-
coming disenchanted with convict leasing and sub-
sequently
outlawed
the
contracting
of
federal
prisoners. In response, a number of state prisons re-
fused to accept federal prisoners. In 1891, the federal
government decided to construct a federal prison at
Leavenworth, Kansas. (Construction began 1898.)
The federal prison system diverged from its
state counterparts in the early 1900s. The construc-
tion of the Atlanta Penitentiary in 1902 introduced
several new innovations. It would be among the
first prisons to feed prisoners in a dining hall at
eight-person tables as opposed to the one-way
bench tables of state facilities. Atlanta also imple-
mented an eight-hour workday for guards. In
1910, federal prisoners were afforded the opportu-
nity to earn parole with the passage of the first Fed-
eral Parole Law. In less than two decades, problems
caused by prison overcrowding and poor record
keeping would lead to the creation of the Federal
Bureau of Prisons in 1929.
CRIM E AND PUNISHM ENT
The years before World War I saw Americans
becoming increasingly concerned with the rising
crime problem. By 1914, New York and Chicago
were experiencing more murders than England,
Scotland,
and
Wales
combined,
and
smaller
cities, such as Detroit and Cleveland, were witnes-
sing more burglaries than London. Public confi-
dence in American policing had fallen to an
all-time low.
More like organized gangs than criminal syndi-
cates, the early twentieth century witnessed a phe-
nomenon known as Black Hand gangs. Although
these gangs are often confused with the Mafia or
viewed as precursors to modern organized crime,
there was nothing monolithic about the Black
Hand. Composed of Italian and Sicilian immigrants,
their major activity revolved around extorting
money from their fellow immigrants. Gangs ranged
in size from 6 to 10 members under one leader.
The gangs typically extorted money by sending sin-
ister letters threatening injury or death if the victim
did not comply with their demands. Letters often
featured crude drawings of daggers, skulls, coffins,
and black hands in the margins. By Prohibition,
most of the Black Handers had either been killed
off or gravitated to the more lucrative selling of
bootleg liquor.
In the years leading up to World War I, New
York City experienced a growing youth gang
problem. Nurtured by poverty and discrimination,
gangs became part of urban America as Jews and
Italians replaced the Irish and German immigrants
who preceded them. Future Jewish and Italian
gangsters, such as Meyer Lansky, Lucky Luciano,
and Bugsy Siegel, entered the criminal world after
graduating from juvenile gang activity.
One of the worst calamities for police reform
was the implementation of national alcohol pro-
hibition with the passage of the Volstead Act in
1920. Although it was intended to end the social
problems associated with alcohol abuse, it would
have the opposite effect as wealthy crime syndi-
cates emerged, energized by the enormous finan-
cial opportunity associated with illicit alcohol
activities. Extensive corruption of politicians,
police, and other officials in this era seriously
undermined public respect for the law and
government.

Capital Punishment
The introduction of the electric chair in 1890 ap-
pealed to the efficiency-motivated reformers of the
Progressive era. During the first decades of the new
century, the technologically efficient electric chair
replaced the noose in most states. Meanwhile, stud-
ies by social scientists demonstrating the lack of de-
terrence value of the death penalty convinced nine
more states to abolish capital punishment. But this
second crusade against the death penalty would end
in the aftermath of the Progressive era as concerns
shifted to race riots, the Red Scare, and rising crime
rates. Four states would reinstate the death penalty
in the early 1920s, while others would add new
capital offenses. Despite the machinations of death
penalty foes during the Progressive era, there was
no real diminution of executions, which continued
at the rate of two per 100,000 as in the late nine-
teenth century.30 Two of the most famous death
penalty trials of the century would take place in
the 1920s (Sacco and Vanzetti and Leopold and
Loeb).
The twentieth century began with a recrudes-
cence of abolitionist activity against the death pen-
alty. Throughout the Progressive era, abolitionists,
such as lawyer Clarence Darrow (1857–1938), elo-
quently attacked capital punishment.
Clarence Darrow was one of America’s greatest criminal
defense lawyers. With little in the way of a formal legal
education, Darrow rose to national prominence while
representing radical leaders Eugene V. Debs (1895) and
William “Big Bill” Haywood (1907). Over time, Darrow
became disenchanted with his labor clients but contin-
ued to represent publicly unpopular clients. His partici-
pation in the Leopold–Loeb murder case in 1924 marked
perhaps his greatest victory. In this case, two wealthy
and intellectually gifted young men kidnapped and
murdered a small boy, hoping to get away with the
perfect murder and demonstrate their intellectual supe-
riority. Both men were caught, and the public clamored
for the death penalty.
Hired by Leopold and Loeb’s wealthy parents,
Darrow decided to forgo a jury trial and plead his case
directly to the judge, asking for life in prison. According
to most sources, this case was the first one in legal
history to introduce the concept of psychopathology as
a mitigating circumstance. Arguing that the defendants
were unable to comprehend moral right from wrong
(not the insanity defense), the attorney was successful in
persuading the judge to sentence them to life in prison.
Darrow would capture the nation’s attention again the
following year when he defended biology teacher John T.
Scopes, who was arrested for violating state law by
teaching Darwin’s theory of evolution.
AM ER ICAN VI OLENC E
The years surrounding World War I were marked
by increased racial tensions and violent crime. Fol-
lowing the war, the media began to sensationalize
crimes such as bank robbery, while law enforce-
ment began to concentrate on better firearms train-
ing to combat the era’s well-armed desperadoes.
During the late 1890s, New York City police com-
missioner Theodore Roosevelt had introduced fire-
arms training after a spate of “firearms-related
accidents.” But it was not until the 1920s that po-
lice firearms training, with the help of the National
Rifle Association, began in earnest.
While many Americans assume that the World
Trade Center bombing of 1993 was the first attack
on the nation’s financial district, in reality the Wall
Street bombing on September 16, 1920, was the first
and, until the Oklahoma City bombing, the “most
deadly
terrorist
attack
in
American
history.”31
Today, scars can still be seen if you look closely en-
ough at the old J. P. Morgan offices on the corner of
Wall and Broad streets. More than 70 people died
either immediately or later from injuries sustained in
the explosion. Although no one was ever brought to
justice for the crime, investigators figured that the
explosion was the result of a horse-drawn cart carry-
ing dynamite and sash weights that acted as shrapnel.
The blast was so strong that an automobile was thrust
20 feet into the air.
William J. Flynn, chief of the Secret Service,
concluded that the bomb was not directed at
J. P. Morgan, although one of his firm’s clerks
was beheaded by the blast; rather, it was directed
at the financial heart of American society. Others
thought that it was either an accident or the result
of a botched robbery or attack on the U.S.

Treasury (on that particular day, $900 million in
gold bars was being moved next door, which was
the epicenter of the blast). A. Mitchell Palmer, the
attorney general, suspected that the attack was the
work of anarchists or communist workers and as “a
precaution” arrested IWW leader William “Big
Bill” Haywood. Still others were convinced that
it was payback for the execution of Sacco and
Vanzetti (see “Notable Trials” later in this chap-
ter). Considering the tensions of the day, there was
no lack of potential suspects.
Race Violence
By the twentieth century, African Americans faced
disenfranchisement and discrimination throughout
the country, as they found themselves excluded
by employers and labor unions from white-collar
jobs and many of the skilled trades. In the South,
Jim Crow laws and tenancy characterized daily life,
leading to a significant migration of blacks to the
North. Unfortunately, they would be met by the
hostility they sought to flee from. Often, hostility
led to violence and riots in cities ranging from
New York (1900) and Springfield, Ohio (1904),
to Springfield, Illinois (1908), and Greensburg,
Indiana (1906).
The birth of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) sought
to eliminate class distinctions and end Jim Crow
laws. But during the first quarter of the twentieth
century, the federal government failed to pass new
legislation to protect black civil rights, and by the
1910s the nation’s capital was as segregated as any of
the southern states.
Violence continued to be directed at black
communities in both the North and the South. In
1917, a riot in East St. Louis claimed the lives of
39 blacks and nine whites. Although its cause is
clouded in rumor and innuendo, the consensus
was that it resulted from white fears that black mi-
grants would take their jobs. During World War I,
African Americans were drafted but were reserved
for mostly menial duties. Race relations would
continue to deteriorate as black veterans returned
home. In 1919 alone, 10 black veterans were
lynched in the South and 14 burned at the stake.
The Chicago riots of 1919 were the worst of this
era. Sociologist Morris Janowitz draws a distinction
between the riots prior to the 1960s and more re-
cent unrest, describing the earlier riots as communal
in nature, involving “a direct struggle between the
residents of white and Negro areas.”32 The riots
were rooted in several years of tension between
the races in which 27 black dwellings had been
targeted by bombers. Other complex issues played
a part in the riots. Chicago’s black population had
more than doubled by 1919, but no new housing
or tenements were erected to absorb the new resi-
dents. Meanwhile, thousands of black soldiers had
returned from World War I determined to find a
voice in the “new” America. In Chicago, housing,
the psychological effects of war, and the organiza-
tion of jobs and labor would collide with the racial
politics of the early twentieth century. This con-
tributed to a new development in race rioting:
African Americans were now fighting back with
fists and weapons.
Chicago was one of the northern cities most
affected by black migration in the aftermath of the
war. A riot began on a summer afternoon when a
young black man swam past an invisible line of
segregation at a Chicago public beach and was hit
with rocks and drowned. This set off three days of
rioting that led to the deaths of 20 African Amer-
icans and 14 whites. More than 100 people were
injured, and numerous black properties went up in
smoke.
Following the Chicago riots, the Chicago
Commission on Race Relations was created in
1922 to investigate the causes of the riots and to
seek solutions for preventing future conflagrations.
The formation of this commission signaled a new
element in criminal justice: commissions to study
the reasons for race riots. Such commissions would
become familiar to Americans following riots in Los
Angeles (1964 and 1992), Newark, Detroit, and
Chicago and in the aftermath of Martin Luther
King Jr.’s assassination in 1968. The Chicago Com-
mission was comprised of 81 leading citizens, both
black and white. Members examined the role of the
police in the riots, riot control problems, examples

of racial discrimination, and the generally poor
relations between the races in Chicago.
The Ku Klux Klan
The Ku Klux Klan reorganized in 1915 and within
four years was flourishing once again. The second
and largest incarnation of the Klan began in Atlanta,
Georgia, in 1915. Initially concentrating its animos-
ity against blacks, in 1920 it launched a nationwide
membership drive under the slogan “native, white
and Protestant.” Taking advantage of the temper
and fears of the time, the Klan used the nation’s
anticommunism and rampant xenophobia as a device
for rallying members to their repugnant banner. In
1925, Klan membership crested at between four and
five million. Not just a southern phenomenon,
crosses would burn from coast to coast as the Klan
used the whip and the noose to terrorize Jews,
Catholics,blacks,evolutionists,bootleggers,Bolshevists,
and any others who crossed the moral divide. Be-
tween 1921 and 1926, the Klan controlled the elec-
tion of governors and senators in Alabama, Georgia,
Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, California, Oregon,
Indiana, and Ohio. Although a number of politi-
cians launched their administrations under the Klan
aegis, by the late 1920s the second resurgence of the
organization was in decline after several well-
publicized scandals discredited Klan leaders.
Labor Violence
According to professors Philip Taft and Philip Ross,
“The United States has had the bloodiest and most
violent labor history of any industrial nation in the
world.”33 Industrial violence reached its zenith be-
tween 1911 and 1916 with major confrontations
occurring in Michigan, West Virginia, and Colorado.
Two
of
the
bloodiest
episodes
occurred
in
Washington State in 1916, when members of the
IWW tried to organize lumber workers. Both in-
cidents led to killings on both side of the picket
lines
and
subsequent
prison
terms for IWW
members.
Between 1916 and 1920, labor union member-
ship almost doubled to close to five million
members, heightening tensions between workers
and management. In one of the worst episodes of
labor violence, a 15-hour battle between strikers
and militiamen at Ludlow, Colorado, in 1914 led
to the suffocation deaths of two mothers and 11
children during a fire in the strikers’ tent city. Over
the next 10 days, miners took part in a violent epi-
sode of “class warfare” in southern Colorado. The
culmination of 30 years of sporadic conflict in the
region, the events at Ludlow shocked the nation.
NOTABLE TRIALS
Sacco–Vanzetti Trial (1921)
Nicola
Sacco
and
Bartolomeo
Vanzetti
were
Italian-born anarchists who immigrated to America
and became involved in the radical politics of the
World War I era. They settled into an Italian com-
munity in eastern Massachusetts but in 1917 moved
to Mexico for a brief time to avoid military con-
scription, an act that would further stigmatize
them as “draft dodgers” during their subsequent
murder trial.
On April 15, 1920, a paymaster and a guard
were gunned down during a payroll robbery in
South Braintree, Massachusetts. The two gunmen
made away with more than $15,000 and were seen
getting into a car with several others while making
their getaway. Witnesses identified the suspects as
Italian in appearance. Police were already investi-
gating a similar holdup by Italians in a nearby town
and were soon focusing on a suspect’s car waiting
for repairs at a garage.
On May 5, Sacco and Vanzetti, along with two
friends, went to pick up the car at the garage and
were arrested as they returned home on a streetcar.
At the time of their arrest, both were carrying
handguns. During questioning at the police station,
both gave evasive answers and reportedly acted
“suspiciously.” While the prosecution would use
this to suggest guilt, defense attorneys emphasized
that they did not even know what the charges were
at this point (they were not told the charges until
four months later, when they were arraigned by the

grand jury) and thought they were being held be-
cause of their radical views. Nonetheless, both were
charged in the earlier holdup attempt and the dou-
ble murder during the payroll robbery.
Despite other possible suspects, police concen-
trated solely on gathering evidence on the two
anarchists. This should not be surprising when
gauging the political climate. It is impossible to sep-
arate the Sacco–Vanzetti case from the events of
1918 and 1919, when the U.S. government in ef-
fect waged war against subversive political groups.
During the trial for the earlier robbery, Sacco
had a solid alibi since he could prove he was at
work at a shoe-making factory at the time. How-
ever, Vanzetti, who worked as a fish peddler,
claimed he was selling fish that evening. But wit-
nesses identified him as one of the robbers, and he
was sentenced to 12 to 15 years in prison. Both
men would be forced to face trial for the Braintree
murders when it was found that Sacco had taken
the day off from work.
Anarchist supporters organized a fund drive and
hired radical labor lawyer Fred H. Moore to defend
the two men. In the opening proceedings of the
trial, it was found that both anarchists lied about
their guns and that Vanzetti’s weapon was identical
to that of the murdered guard’s, which happened to
be missing at the scene of the crime. Next, the
prosecution made Sacco try on a cap found at the
scene that was similar to one he regularly wore.
Foreshadowing the famous O. J. Simpson trial
faux pas when the prosecution had him try on
gloves that did not fit, the prosecution had Sacco
try on the cap, which was much too big, and as the
defendant drew it down over his ears for effect, the
courtroom burst into laughter, a rare instance of
levity in the proceedings. Lawyers for the state
then introduced a cap that was the same size as
that found in Sacco’s home. When it proved to
be oversized as well, it seemed that the joke was
on the defense.
During then ensuing proceedings, both Sacco
and Vanzetti admitted lying about their reasons for
visiting the garage because they feared deportation
for radical charges if they told authorities they went
to get the car to deliver radical literature. On July 14,
1920, the jury returned a guilty verdict on both
murder charges, unleashing a wave of violent protest
around the world. Embassies from Europe to South
America were bombarded by letters of protest. Ten
thousand police protected the American embassy in
Paris against thousands of protesters.
During the next six years, numerous motions for
a new trial were denied. In 1927, the Massachusetts
governor reviewed the entire case while consider-
ing an appeal for clemency. Despite a whirlwind of
protest, the governor concluded that the initial
findings were fair and that Sacco and Vanzetti
were guilty. On August 23, 1927, both men were
executed in the electric chair. Concluding that
much of the evidence was questionable and that
the judge and jury were prejudiced against the
defendants because they were aliens and anarchists,
50 years later Massachusetts Governor Michael
Dukakis signed a special proclamation admitting
the unfairness of the trial.
To many critics, this case symbolized the failure
of the criminal justice system as well as the inequity
of capitalism. Over the past 70 years, debate over
the case has continued as revisionists examined
court transcripts and interviewed surviving partici-
pants. In the 1960s and 1980s, ballistics tests on
Sacco’s rusting 40-year-old gun seemed to deter-
mine that it did indeed fire a fatal round during
the payroll robbery, calling into question the inno-
cence of at least one of the “martyrs.”
Summing up the impact of the case on Ameri-
can criminal justice, historian Vincenza Scarpaci
stated, “Perhaps the greatest legacy of the Sacco-
Vanzetti case concerns state-authorized violence:
the methods used to bring criminals and terrorists
to justice and efforts to ensure fair trial continue to
place the political and judicial system in a delicate
balancing act, attempting to protect the rights of the
accused while also ensuring the public right to
safety.”34
To this day, there are still more questions than
answers about the case: Who were the other three
bandits in the car? What happened to the $15,000?
How and when did Sacco and Vanzetti plan the
perfectly executed robbery? Even noted Harvard
law professor Felix Frankfurter penned a critique

of the American justice system in the 1920s in
which he noted the prejudices, errors, and absurd-
ities of the prosecution’s case. Perhaps the most en-
during legacy of this “crime of the century” are the
23 gouaches by artist Ben Shahn and a number of
poems, plays, short stories, and novels that com-
memorate the case for posterity. Although opinion
is still split as to whether Sacco and Vanzetti were
guilty, we can never know with certainty whether
they took part in the murders. However, a survey
of the physical evidence suggests that Sacco was
probably guilty (he shouted “Long live anarchy”
as he was put to death) and that Vanzetti was inno-
cent (declaring his innocence to his death).
CONCLUSIONS
According to criminal justice historian Samuel
Walker, during the Progressive era, “virtually every
state completed the modern criminal justice system,
establishing probation, parole, and the juvenile
court.”35 But the Progressive reformers left behind
a mixed legacy. An era in which it was believed that
progress could be legislated saw a plethora of reform
legislation, most of which was disappointing and
rarely worked. Some urban reforms led to more
efficient and noncorrupt civic government; how-
ever, the criminal opportunities of the Prohibition
era that followed would nullify many of the Pro-
gressive reforms. In the end, most attempts to legis-
late morality led to profitability at the hands of
organized crime groups. Most important, the crim-
inalizing of once-noncriminal offenses, such as
alcohol consumption and prostitution, fostered a
widespread disrespect for law and its enforcement
that would last for decades.
In the years following World War I, the aboli-
tion of the death penalty became a low priority as
tremendous changes in demographics focused the
attention of reformers on poverty, civil rights, and
political reform. In contrast to the idealistic prog-
nostications of the reformers, the era actually deep-
ened ethnic tensions and threatened civil liberties,
dashing the hopes of the Progressive reformers. The
war years intensified the old fears of native Amer-
icans who saw their vision of a strong, isolated
country inhabited by white middle-class Protestants
changing before their eyes. In response, they lashed
out at those who had contributed to the transfor-
mation: immigrants, socialists, anarchists, commu-
nists, and radical labor organizers.
However, prison reformers are credited with
breaking down the former punitive penal regime
and by the 1930s could cite such victories as the
end of striped uniforms, lockstep marching, silence,
and draconian punishments outside the southern
states. The onset of Prohibition in 1920 began the
most disastrous period in twentieth-century law en-
forcement. Prohibition not only required the police
to enforce laws that were almost impossible to en-
force but also triggered widespread corruption in
police departments throughout the nation.
As criminal justice historian Roger Lane has
noted in his history of murder in America, “Pro-
gressive reforms had begun, and were always stron-
gest at the local level, with attacks on municipal
waste and corruption.”36 Local attempts at crime
control and regulating morality stimulated the fed-
eral response to Progressive-era social problems that
found expression in broadly worded federal laws
against drugs and prostitution as well as the creation
of the Bureau of Investigation.
Point–Counterpoint
Cossacks or Constabulary: The Pennsylvania State
Police (1911)
The state of Pennsylvania had been beset by widespread rural
crime, industrial disorder, and ethnic conflict since the 1850s.
In 1905 the Pennsylvania State Police was created and
charged with policing the entire state. However, for the most
part they patrolled the immigrant-dominated mining districts;
to their opposition they were the Cossacks and to their sup-
porters the Black Hussars. In the following passages state
police advocate Katherine Mayo (1867–1940) describes a

100% American state police protecting the nation from for-
eigners, labor agitators, and people of color. In grim contrast
the Pennsylvania State Federation of Labor collected a
number of letters and abstracts testifying to the brutality and
xenophobia of the new force.
The period immediately following the enlistment
of the command, laconically as it was summarized
by Captain Groome, was a period long to be re-
membered by the men of the four Troops. Assem-
bled in their four quarters of the State they now
faced each other practically for the first time. A
few of them had served in the regular army to-
gether, here and there about the world, but for
the most part they were as strange one to another
as to the questions that they had to solve.
“Now, you are the State Police Force,” they
heard. And the Superintendent, interviewing them
severally and apart, had said, in a way that none of
them will ever forget:
“Your duty is to make the Pennsylvania State
Police Force the finest thing in the world.”
The Superintendent, in those memorable pri-
vate interviews, had probed their minds as to their
own conception of the work, giving them therewith
certain illuminating flashes of his own purpose. He
had indicated, also, a cardinal point or two, as:
“It is possible for a man to be a gentleman as
well as a policeman.”
“I expect you to treat elderly persons, women,
and
children
at
all
times
with
the
greatest
consideration.”
“When once you start after a man you must get
him.”
“In making an arrest you may use no force
beyond the minimum necessary.”
“One State Policeman should be able to handle
one hundred foreigners.”
The general locations of the four Troop sta-
tions had been determined by two considerations:
First, that the entire command should be so distrib-
uted as to reach as far as might be over the State;
and, second but not less, that the regions of greatest
criminality should be under the closest observation.
A glance at the map shows that the posts are placed
in the northern and southern halves of the eastern
and western sections. These sections, by year-round
criminal record, produced more murder, more
manslaughter, more robbery, more rape, more bur-
glary and thieving, more lawlessness and disorder of
every sort, by far, than were shown by the records
of the other parts of the Commonwealth. The cen-
tral section of the State was and is mainly a farming
region, with an old, homogeneous population, by
no means free from trouble but not yet as cease-
lessly troubled as the regions to the east and west.
The reason of this condition was obvious. In the
eastern and western sections lie the great coal fields,
with other allied industries. The coal fields, ever
since their opening, have attracted an unending
stream of foreign immigration. This immigration, at
first largely tainted with lawlessness and turbulence,
constantly undergoes a process of assimilation and
improvement and is as constantly reflooded below
by crude material of the roughest type.
In the beginning the major part of the mine la-
borers came from Ireland and from the Scandinavian
peninsula. Out of the former of these two elements
sprang that unspeakable society of murderers, the
“Molly McGuires.” After successfully maintaining a
reign of nightmare for some years, these monstrosities
were wiped out of existence by heroic methods,
while the Irish in general, like the Scandinavians,
are now but little found in their earlier walks, having
graduated to more desirable employ. The Welsh
passed quickly through the transition stage and be-
yond it. Then came the Slavs and the Italians, who
practically filled the field at the period in hand.
Peoples totally unused in their countries of
origin to any form of self-government, but accus-
tomed on the contrary to see the sword of the king
always bared before their eyes, Slavs and Italians
alike here looked in vain for outward evidence of
authority and law. Peoples used to the narrowest
means, they here found themselves suddenly pos-
sessed of greater earnings than they had ever
dreamed of before. Peoples used to free drinking,
in climates where the effect of alcohol is less marked
than here, they still continued that free drinking,
and in strange raw mixtures of peculiar virulence.
Liberty that they knew not how to use, money that
they knew neither how to spend nor how to save,

meant license, greed, drunkenness—and through
drunkenness all brutalities let loose.
The State Police has no purpose save to execute the
laws of the State.
The State Police, therefore, was properly
placed in the centres of greatest offense to the peo-
ple. Its sole concern was to protect the people in
their peace. At no time could it check in the slight-
est degree the movements of any person not break-
ing the law. A “strike” is a perfectly lawful
proceeding, and the State’s Police could have no
cognizance of a “strike” other than of a picnic or
a county fair. Called in by the proper authorities
with convincing proof of need, the State Police
would see to it, at picnic, strike, or country fair,
alike, that general order was maintained by all pres-
ent without fear, favor, or respect to persons. And
therein lies the whole story.
The first activities of the four Troops now en-
tering the field were of a general and various nature.
Here they picked up a country store robber; there a
stabber of a night watchman; again, a molester of
women; a carrier of concealed weapons; a farm
thief; a setter of forest fires; and always a little har-
vest of killers of song-birds, greatly to the derision
of the imperfectly endowed. Meantime they were
dealing constantly with the unassimilated foreign
element, teaching it by small but repeated object-
lessons that a new gospel was abroad in the land.
At feasts, christenings, balls, and the like, these
alien people were given to heavy and prolonged
drinking bouts, which ended often in wild and
murderous disorder.
New Alexandria, Pa., Feb. 21, 1911.
Gentlemen:
State Police came to New Alexandria July 31,
1910, Sunday.
The State Constabulary are of no use in this
country to farmers and workingmen. They make
all efforts to oppress labor.
Six of them were stationed at this town for a
period of two months for the benefit of the coal
company. Their duty was in and around the works.
At the time they were here there was trouble
between them and the miners. There was a camp
located within two hundred feet of my house. There
were three State Constabulary and two deputy sheriffs
went into camp. They rode their horses over men,
women and children. They used their riot clubs freely
on the miners without cause or provocation.
One of the men had to be sent to the hospital,
one received a broken arm, one woman was
clubbed until she was laid up for two weeks. At
that time she gave birth to a child and remained
in bed for four weeks after the birth of her child.
They used their clubs on everyone that protested
against their conduct and I was an eye-witness to
the affair.
There were no lives lost and no one hurt be-
fore their arrival.
The majority of citizens are not in favor of the
Constabulary.
I cannot see that anyone but the coal company
is benefitted by the Constabulary.
Yours truly,
S. P. Bridge,
New Alexandria, Westmoreland County, Pa.
Latrobe, Pa., Feb. 13, 1911.
Report of Investigating Committee, Local No.
405, U. M. W. of A., as follows:
Question No. 1. The first arrival of the State
Constabulary was at Bradenville, morning of April
22, 1910. On their arrival at Bradenville on said
morning, they acted more like heathens than
human-beings. They drove their horses up on the
sidewalks and knocked people in all directions, or-
dering people away from their own homes. They
arrested one man for hollering “bah,” drove others
from the public highway and away from the street
car station, regardless of who they were.
Question No. 2. The conditions before their
arrival were good, no trouble having occurred
whatever.
Question No. 3. No lives were lost prior to
their arrival, and no property had been destroyed.
Question No. 4. There were four lives
taken, namely: Mike Cheken, Mike Mizrak,
one colored man and one deputy sheriff. After
the arrival of the Constabulary the property loss
was—three double houses at Superior No. 2, pri-
vate property damaged by explosion, one small

child lost its life, which occurred at 12
P.M.
There was also damage done to the property of
Mike Godula at Peanut Works, blowing down
his bake-oven and fence, on the morning of
July 4, 1910. There was dynamite found in the
yard next morning.
Mary Riech lost her life at Superior No. 2, in
an explosion which occurred on Jan, 27, 1911.
Two were blown up in Superior No. 2, be-
tween the 27th and 28th. The explosion damaged
the houses and all the things in them. About ten
minutes after there was about eighteen to thirty rifle
shots fired at the house. Some went into the bed
but no one was hit. After the explosion, the man
came out on his porch and all of the company
employees told him to go into the house.
There were people who saw them placing
some dynamite against the house.

Irwin, Pa., Feb. 21, 1911.
To the Legislature of Pennsylvania:
This is to certify that the following evidence is
true, as given by different members of our Local
Union, No. 2088:
1.
The State Police came to Irwin about the 15th
of June.
2.
The condition of the town of Irwin was
peaceable before the arrival of the police, no
lives being lost or property damaged before
they arrived, and the town being quiet until
the arrival of the State Police.
3.
I, Frank Nameska, was going home peaceably
from the election board at the hour of 5.30 and
was stopped by two State Police and compelled
to be searched.
The second time I was going to Irwin,
with three other men and was stopped and
asked where we were going. We said, “None
of your business.” One man jumped from his
horse and said, you better go back. Then they
pushed us about, trying to start a fight because
we were out on strike, but we managed to get
to Irwin after them pushing us about, during
which I received a crack on the jaw.
4.
I, Frank Fletcher, was going to Irwin and was
arrested by two State Police, taken to burgess’
office after being taken from jail for being
drunk and disorderly, and forced to pay the
sum of $6.75.
5.
I, William Colliner, was at Rilton; when I
came back to Irwin, I was arrested by the State
Police and taken to Greensburg. After I was
put in jail, I was released the next day.
6.
I, David Thomas, was arrested and abused by
the State Police on the 16th day of December.
The State Police were taking a few men to the
mines. I just asked the men if they knew that
there was a strike going on. One of the State
Police turned and hit me with a black-jack,
bursting my head and I was taken to jail, then to
’Squire Davis. He put the case to Greensburg,
where I was fined $14.14 for witness fees and
$41.32 costs, for assault and battery and resisting
an officer. The State Police were dressed in
citizens’ clothes, not having any badge.
7.
I, David Thomas, Jr., was coming down street
and saw my father all over blood. I asked him
what was the matter. He then told me of be-
ing hit by a man. I asked where the man was
then. I was shown. I asked the man why he hit
my father. I, not knowing that he was a State
Police, asked him again what was the matter.
The State Police said, “He is under arrest.”
Then I said, “Well, if he is under arrest, don’t
knock his brains out.” Then the other State
Police yelled out, “You are under arrest.” I
was then taken with my father to jail, but was
let free.
The State Police acknowledged, at court,
that they arrested the men without showing
any badge or having on their uniforms.
8. The conduct of the State Police toward citizens
not interested in the strike was favorable.
9. The names of the men abused are Mike
Klemans, Frank Fletcher, Tony Fletcher, Frank

NOTES
1. “Jim Crow” referred to the de facto segregation that
characterized the South. The name of Jim Crow
was tied to a white actor in blackface who worked
as a song-and-dance man in the 1830s. According to
historian Lerone Bennet Jr., by 1838 the term was
being used as a “synonym for Negro,” enforcing the
image of the African American as a “comic, jump-
ing, stupid rag doll of a man.”
2. Some of the critics of the journalists compared them
to a character in John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s
Progress, who was too engrossed in raking muck to
look up and accept a celestial crown, hence the
moniker “muckraker.”

24. Although Wells is generally regarded as the first
woman given the title of police officer as well as the
powers of arrest, in 1893 the Chicago Police De-
partment gave police widow Marie Owens the title
of police officer, albeit without any arrest powers.
25. Quoted in Sjoquist (1984, p. 148).
26. The dance halls were one of the most popular enter-
tainment spots for young men and women at the turn
of the century. Here, for as little as a nickel, men and
women could come and escape the tedium of the
12-hourworkday. According tohistorian Albert Fried,
by 1900 New York City had one or two on every
block. Reformers would naturally target the immo-
rality of the dance halls during the Progressive era.

The passage of the Eighteenth Amendment and the
onset of Prohibition in 1920 led to what many ob-
servers have referred to as the “lawless decade.”
Others have described the 1920s and 1930s as
“the crime control decades.”1 Prohibition would
cast a pall over the presidencies of Woodrow
Wilson, Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and
Herbert Hoover before being brought to an end in
1933 under the Roosevelt administration.
Following the Wall Street crash in 1929,
America and the Western world seemed to be on
the brink of an abyss. As America’s farmers saw their
dreams turn to dust, by 1932 between one-quarter
and one-third of America’s workers stood in

During the 1920s and 1930s, crime emerged as
one of the nation’s greatest political and social issues
as popular attention was focused on the exploits of
bootleggers, gangsters, public enemies, and crime
waves, both real and imaginary. One historian of the
social bandit tradition noted that although the 1930s
saw a sustained drop in serious crimes, the “concentra-
tion of famous fugitives and their infamous crimes
[between 1933 and 1935] has no equal in the nation’s
history.”2 By the 1930s, law enforcement became a
national obsession thanks to the publicity-minded ge-
niusof FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, who consciously
projected the onset of acrimewave.Inresponse,Con-
gress would broaden the mandate of federal law en-
forcement to include policing prostitution, drugs, and
the sale of alcohol.
Until recently, many chroniclers of the 1920s
and 1930s have persuasively perpetuated an image
of a lawless land of tommy-gun-toting killers, when
in actuality the 1930s was a safer era than the 1980s.
The numbers spewed out by the publicity machine
have long overshadowed a reality that would sug-
gest that the numbers of violent and serious property
offenses actually fell in the 1930s. America’s homicide
rate had doubled between 1900 and 1919, but in the
1920s there was little or no increase. What had in-
creased by the 1920s and 1930s was an awareness and
fear of crime thanks in part to the omnipresent news
media.Highlypublicized “crimesofthe century,”such
as the Lindbergh kidnapping, the St. Valentine’s Day
Massacre, and the Leopold and Loeb case, transfixed
the country. Forecasting the modern era, newspaper
and radio station owners had figured out that crime
newssells.AsProhibitioncriminalizedonce-acceptable
behavior, it added to America’s fixation on rising crime
rates.
The years between World War I and World
War II saw the federal government become increas-
ingly involved in crime fighting. In 1929, President
Herbert Hoover authorized the Wickersham Com-
mission to direct the first “comprehensive survey of
American criminal justice at the national level.”3
That same year, Hoover appointed Sanford Bates
to lead the new U.S. Bureau of Prisons. During
the next five decades, the federal correctional sys-
tem would set the standards for state prisons.
On the national level, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt exploited political and economic crises
to maneuver through Congress a series of laws to
promote economic recovery and reduce social and
economic misery. The creation of the New Deal ran
counter to the prevailing policy of laissez-faire, which
placed limits on the federal government’s power to set
standards governing prices, pensions, wages, and labor
relations. The New Deal empowered the federal gov-
ernment to assume more social welfare responsibili-
ties at the expense of states’ rights. Coinciding with
the sharp rise in crime, New Deal principles would
be applied to criminal justice as well, leading to a rev-
olution in law enforcement. Paralleling the growth of
most federal agenciesduringthiserawasthe expansion
of the FBI in the 1930s and a burgeoning federal war
against crime. During the early New Deal years, fed-
eral control over crime was expanded to include
kidnapping (1932), crossing state lines to avoid prose-
cution (1933), interstate transportation of stolen
goods (1934), and marijuana prohibition (1937).
THE LAW GIVERS
In the first half of the twentieth century, the court
system saw a major shift from property to personal
rights. The Bill of Rights had little practical impact
on government powers until the 1920s and 1930s,
when the first amendments were given meaning
by the law. It should not be surprising that this
was the case since the Bill of Rights was aimed
at the federal government and its policies. The
federal government had little concern for individ-
ual rights until the Progressive era. Even the inter-
pretation of the post–Civil War amendments was
usually confined to economic issues (e.g., the
Fourteenth Amendment and the Slaughterhouse
cases). Historian David Bodenhamer, one of the
foremost authorities on the rights of the accused,
suggested that “the nationalization of the Bill of
Rights travelled an uncertain course because the
justices lacked a sure theoretical foundation for
their decisions.” He concluded that “there was
228

no consensus on principles to guide interpretation
of the amendments, in part because of the novelty
of the idea that defendants’ rights needed protec-
tion against state misconduct.”4
Beginning in the 1920s, the Supreme Court held
that states were bound by certain guaranties of the Bill
ofRights.In1923,theCourt forthefirst timereversed
a state criminal conviction on the groundsthat the trial
had departed from due process. Two years later, the
Court issued two decisions that held that certain guar-
antees of the Bill of Rights were so fundamental as to
be included in due process. Both decisions involved
rights protected by the First Amendment.
Among the most significant challenges to search-
and-seizure lawsduring the 1920s was the 1925 Carroll
etal.v.UnitedStatesSupremeCourtruling.Inthiscase,
a bootlegger by the name of George Carroll and some
of his associates were arrested and convicted of violat-
ing prohibition statutes after law enforcement officers
seized 68 bottles of whiskey and gin from his car dur-
ing a search of his car without a warrant. The defen-
dants charged that this search violated their Fourth
Amendment rights and that the liquor found in the
carshould havebeen inadmissible asevidence in court.
However, the Supreme Court upheld the convictions
despite the absence of a warrant, citing the fact that the
search of a moving vehicle is not the same as searching
a home because crucial evidence can be moved
quickly in moving vehicles and thus lost forever.
Therefore, if there is probable cause of illegal activity,
under what has become known as the “Carroll Doc-
trine,” police can conduct a search of a vehicle, such as
a car or a boat, without a warrant.
The campaigns against narcotics and alcohol
shared many similarities in part because “both
were first directed against the evils of large-scale
use and only later against all use.”5 However, where
the two efforts differed was in the realm of public
opinion. Few Americans argued with the antinar-
cotics crusade, while temperance was a matter of
vitriolic public debate for decades.
Drug Enforcement
Harry Anslinger (1892–1975) rose to national
prominence as the first commissioner of the Bureau
of Narcotics of the U.S. Treasury Department in
the 1930s. During the 1920s, the association of
the Narcotics Division with the Prohibition Bureau
led to public disenchantment with the bureau in
part because of the unpopularity of Prohibition as
well as its inept enforcement. In 1930, Congress
removed drug enforcement from the Prohibi-
tion Bureau and created a separate agency in the
Treasury Department. Initially, the powers of the
Bureau of Narcotics were limited to the enforce-
ment of registration and record-keeping laws.
Born in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after graduating from law
school, Harry Anslinger entered public service with the
War Department before moving to the Treasury Depart-
ment in 1926. During the early Prohibition years, he
attended seminars on international drug and alcohol
smuggling, which would lead to his appointment as
commissioner of Prohibition in 1929. Following his ap-
pointment as commissioner of the Bureau of Narcotics, he
embarked on a get-tough policy against drug abusers.
During the 1930s, he led the crusade against marijuana,
which culminated in the passage of the Marijuana Tax
Act of 1937. During World War II, Anslinger made the
unsubstantiated claim that the Japanese were using an
“opium offensive” as part of a strategy to enslave con-
quered countries through drug trafficking. The U.S. gov-
ernment was sufficiently alarmed to grant him access to
the Coast Guard, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Inter-
nal Revenue Service in his battle against the narcotics
trade.
Few states had any drug control statutes by
1930, but with the establishment of the new federal
bureau, the states were encouraged to enact their
own antidrug legislation. The following year, every
state had introduced laws to restrict the sale of co-
caine, and most also restricted the sales of opiates.
However, drug enforcement was hampered by the
lack of uniformity in state statutes and the weakness
of enforcement strategies. By the late 1930s,
35 states had embraced the Uniform Narcotic Act,
which regulated or prohibited cocaine and opium
and their derivatives. Despite opposition to includ-
ing marijuana on the list, most of the states had
already enacted marijuana statutes.
There was little fear over marijuana use
throughout
the
1920s,
although

government was expressing increased concern. By
the 1930s, 16 states, most with relatively large
Mexican populations, enacted anti-marijuana legis-
lation. Thanks in part to hysterical films such as
Reefer Madness (1936) and recommendations by
drug commissioner Harry Anslinger, a growing
concern among the public and legislators led Con-
gress to pass the Marijuana Tax Act in 1937.
Although it made the recreational use of marijuana
illegal, it did not become much of an issue until the
1960s. In fact, the Bureau of Narcotics opposed
publicity campaigns by private organizations that
portrayed the marijuana problem as out of hand
and discouraged the creators of the “killer drug
marijuana” posters from selling their materials.6
Prohibition
Deeply rooted in European social custom, alcohol
prohibition was a subject of much contention, in
stark contrast with anti-opiate legislation, which
had only a brief history in Western culture. But
the crusade for national prohibition was decades
in the making. The movement saw its first national
victory in 1913 with the passage of the Webb-
Kenyon Act, which allowed dry states to interfere
with the transportation of alcohol across their state
lines. The following year, those concerned with the
large amounts of narcotics in patent medicines cel-
ebrated the passage of the Harrison Narcotic Act,
which required a doctor’s prescription for the sale
of controlled dangerous substances. In addition,
Congress demanded drug manufacturers to register
with the government and maintain sales records.
In December 1919, Congress approved the
Eighteenth Amendment, which was ratified by
the states the following year. Under the new law,
it became illegal to manufacture, import, distribute,
or sell alcoholic beverages in the United States.
However, it created a major paradox in that the
amendment did not prohibit the purchase and con-
sumption of alcoholic beverages. What is often lost
on Americans as the 1920s fades into distant history
is that private drinking was not against the law dur-
ing the Prohibition years 1920–1933. According to
the Eighteenth Amendment, what was prohibited
was the manufacture, sale, or transportation of “in-
toxicating liquors,” defined as any beverage with
more than 0.5% alcohol. Beer had anywhere from
3% to 8%, wine 10% to 20%, and spirits 40%.
Courts typically threw out attempts to make social
drinkers guilty of conspiracy, concentrating instead
on the suppliers. By 1916, saloons were banned in
21 states, but the enforcement of prohibition was
never fully financed and supported by the govern-
ment, and the large breweries continued to make
beer unimpeded. According to one prohibition
agent, it was easy to find alcoholic beverages in
most cites in only half an hour.
Although Prohibition has been branded an un-
mitigated disaster for providing the opportunity for
organized crime to thrive, it was not a total failure
as popularly depicted. During Prohibition, public
drunkenness all but vanished, and deaths and dis-
eases from alcohol, such as cirrhosis of the liver,
declined. Looming large in the face of historians
who would suggest that Prohibition had more ben-
eficial effects than negative ones, the increased
fatalities from the deadly concoction of rubbing
alcohol–based consumption of “bathtub gin” and
the hundreds of killings associated with the rise of
organized crime must be taken into consideration.
The consumption of alcohol would not return
to pre-Prohibition levels until the 1970s. In the
early 1920s, public sentiment favored enforcement,
but with the growing corruption and crime, public
opinion changed, and in 1930 a poll of five million
people found only 10.5% in favor of enforcement.
The Wickersham Commission
(1929–1931)
In 1929, former U.S. Attorney General George
Wickersham (1858–1936) was selected to chair
the National Commission on Law Observance
and Enforcement. His dominant presence ensured
that his name would become synonymous with
police reform after the commission became better
known as the Wickersham Commission. Although
derided by some as “a monument to equivoca-
tion”7 for its failure to reach any conclusions about
crime and Prohibition, it is considered the first
230

national commission to consider issues of crime and
law enforcement in a serious manner as well as to
make recommendations. Under President Herbert
Hoover, the commission was given the task of
proposing methods for the enforcement of the
Eighteenth Amendment. In addition, the commis-
sion was charged with surveying the entire federal
criminal justice system and examining the adminis-
tration of justice in relation to the amendment. The
Wickersham
Commission
recommended
not
repealing the Eighteenth Amendment but urged
better methods of enforcing it.
Between 1929 and 1931, the commission pro-
duced a 14-volume report. Its most important find-
ings related to policing were published in two
volumes, Report on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement
(No. 11) and Report on Police (No. 14). According
to No. 11, the use of the third degree8 was a viola-
tion of constitutional privileges. The commission
recommended 11 solutions for eradicating proce-
dures that often denied fundamental rights to sus-
pects and defendants.
Report No. 14 was a critique of police admin-
istration and bore the stamp of August Vollmer,
who was credited with directing the report and
writing several of the chapters himself. The conclu-
sions of this survey inveighed against the corrupting
influence of politics on police organizations. De-
spite the noble intentions of the Wickersham Com-
mission, most of its suggestions went unheeded. Its
main legacy was informing the public that the crim-
inal justice system needed to be reevaluated and
improved. Among its harshest critics were police
executives who found that many of the conclusions
were hastily drawn.
The Seabury Investigation (1930)
The 1930 Seabury Investigation began as a probe of
the New York Magistrate’s Court after several
judges were linked to mobster Arnold Rothstein
and other organized crime figures. Judge Samuel
Seabury concluded that not much had changed
since the Lexow Committee investigation of the
1890s and that the New York City Police Depart-
ment was riddled with corruption. Seabury had
started his legal career as a champion of the poor
and the labor unions before serving terms on the
state supreme court and the court of pleas. His find-
ings led to the dismissal of 20 members of the vice
squad and the exposure of rampant political bribery
and corruption among city leaders, including police
commissioners and the mayor.9
Other scandals involving corrupt judges led to
the adoption of a plan for selecting judges that had
been proposed almost 20 years earlier. According to
the plan endorsed by the American Bar Association
and the American Judicature Society, judges would
be selected by a merit plan that allowed voters some
choice in the selection of judges through nonparti-
san elections. Judges would in this way run on their
records. In 1940, several cities in Missouri adopted a
plan that allowed an impartial committee of lawyers
and laypeople to compile a list of qualified candi-
dates when there was a vacancy and submit the list
to the governor for selection.
LAW ENFORCEMENT
Perhaps the greatest development in policing in the
1920s and 1930s was the growing involvement of
the federal government in law enforcement. While
the expansion of the FBI is well documented, other
federal agencies saw their duties change because of
the exigencies of Prohibition- and Depression-
related crime. Between 1920 and 1933, the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which traces its
origins back to 1862 (Alcohol, Tobacco, Tax Unit),
saw considerable action disposing of illegal whiskey
and arresting bootleggers. Meanwhile, the Customs
Service was kept busy trying to stem the flow of
illegal liquor into America by boat. The Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) enjoyed one of its brightest
moments in the 1930s with the conviction of
Al Capone on income tax evasion. And in 1940,
the Immigration and Naturalization Service became
part of the Department of Justice.
Also reflecting the influence of the police pro-
fessionalism movement was the emphasis placed on
professional police training programs at various
levels of government. State police forces led the

way in implementing professional training programs
in the 1930s. As early as 1931, San Jose State Col-
lege boasted the first complete police major pro-
gram,
and
in
1935
the

introduced
an
academy for training local police officers.
Federal Law Enforcement
The Bureau of Investigation grew gradually during
its first decades. The Mann Act (1910), World War I,
and the Russian Revolution saw the expansion of
the bureau’s role in federal law enforcement. In
these years, the bureau investigated white slavery,
espionage, sabotage, and draft violations. In 1919,
the force was empowered to investigate interstate
motor vehicle theft with the passage of the Na-
tional Motor Vehicle Theft Act. The bureau un-
derwent growing pains in the 1920s, and to lead
the organization into the new era, J. Edgar Hoover
was selected as director in 1924. Hoover brought
professionalism to the agency, establishing rigid
codes of conduct and replacing the seniority-
based system of promotion with one based on
merit. Under his direction, special agents were
required to be college educated, with degrees in
law or accounting.
Born in Washington, D.C., John Edgar Hoover (1895–
1972) graduated from law school in 1917 and joined the
U.S. Department of Justice, where he would devote the
next 55 years of his life, 48 of them as head of the FBI.
Hoover rose to prominence as head of the Justice De-
partment’s Intelligence Division under Attorney General
Mitchell Palmer. During his first years under Palmer, Ho-
over oversaw a campaign of persecution of foreigners
who had been identified as communist sympathizers.
Mass arrests and the trampling of constitutional protec-
tions resulted in hundreds of deportations and illegal
searches and seizures. It was in this period that Hoover
developed a predilection for maintaining secret files on
individuals under investigation, a practice that would
haunt civil libertarians for the next half century. In 1921,
he was transferred to the Bureau of Investigation, where
he served as assistant director. Following a series of
scandals, bureau director William Burns retired in 1924,
and Hoover took the reins, inaugurating a new era in
professionalism that introduced the latest scientific
methods of detection, expanded the fingerprinting bu-
reau, and began the hiring of better-educated agents.
Throughout the 1930s, Hoover concentrated his war
on crime on bank robbers and high-profile crimes, tar-
geting such “public enemies” as Pretty Boy Floyd, John
Dillinger, and Baby Face Nelson. A genius at public rela-
tions, Hoover convinced Hollywood to produce a series
of films promoting the traditional image of the FBI agent
as incorruptible and professional. In 1935 alone, more
that 60 films fostered this portrait, including the James
Cagney vehicle G-Men.
In 1924, Congress approved the transfer of fin-
gerprint records at Leavenworth Federal Prison and
the criminal records maintained by the Interna-
tional Association of Chiefs of Police to the FBI.
The collection of over 810,000 records became
the nucleus of the FBI Identification Division, cre-
ated in 1924. In 1932, an FBI laboratory was estab-
lished to aid federal and local investigations through
the scientific analysis of blood, hair, firearms, hand-
writing, and other types of evidence.
In 1930, the power of the FBI was enhanced
by a congressional act that required police agencies
to compile crime statistics that would be dissemi-
nated through the FBI Uniform Crime Reports. This
proved a major coup for Hoover’s FBI. Although
these reports have come under fire as being flawed
because of their reliance on only crimes known to
police, these yearly reports represent America’s first
national crime records system.
Hoover proved a master at promoting the FBI
by enhancing the federal role in law enforcement.
Rising crime and repercussions from the 1933
Kansas City Massacre (covered later in this chapter)
led Congress to enact a wave of legislation in 1934
that increased the power and prestige of the FBI.
Agents were henceforth given full arrest powers and
the authority to carry firearms, and new laws signif-
icantly expanded the number of federal crimes as
well as the FBI’s jurisdiction. Subsequently, it be-
came a federal crime to cross state lines to avoid
prosecution, to extort money with telephones or
other federally regulated methods, to rob a federal
bank, or to transport stolen property valued at over
$5,000 across state lines.
During the Prohibition and Depression years,
the FBI focused much of its attention and energies
on the pursuit of “public enemies,” such as John
232

Dillinger, the Barker gang, Pretty Boy Floyd,
Machine Gun Kelly, and other media sensations.10
Although Kelly was credited with introducing the
G-men (government-men) moniker in reference to
the FBI, its origins can be traced to earlier sources.
All the bureau’s functions were consolidated and
transferred to the Division of Investigation in
1933, and on March 22, 1935, it was renamed the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.11
Despite the best efforts of the FBI and the
Chicago Police Department, Al Capone (1899–
1947), America’s public enemy number one and the
architect of perhaps 300 unsolved murders, was finally
brought to justice by agents of the IRS in 1931. Long
pursued by Prohibition agent Eliot Ness and his “Un-
touchables,” it was not until IRS agent Frank Wilson
convinced a Capone employee to testify to Capone’s
illicit income that the crime boss was brought to jus-
tice. Thanks to a 1927 Supreme Court case that ruled
that income from illegal transactions was taxable, the
IRS used its agents to demonstrate that Capone had
cheated the IRS, and on October 24, 1931, he was
sentenced to 11 years in prison, effectively ending his
reign as Chicago crime boss.
Best remembered as the IRS agent that nabbed Al Capone,
Frank J. Wilson (1887–1970) joined the U.S. Treasury De-
partment’s Intelligence Unit in 1920. Ten years later, he
was given the task of prosecuting Capone using a 1927
Supreme Court decision that made illegal income subject
to income tax. Since Capone had not filed income tax re-
turns for several years, and did not have any property or
bank accounts in his own name, and had no endorsed
checks, Wilson had quite a challenge ahead of him. With-
out a paper trail he based his investigation on his estimate
of net worth and net expenditures. Capone got wind of
the investigation and hired a hit team to kill Wilson.
However, he was pressured by associates to withdraw the
contract. Wilson soon got his man and Capone was off to
prison in 1931. Wilson also played a prominent but un-
heralded role in the Lindbergh kidnapping investigation
by insisting that the serial numbers of the ransom money
be recorded. In 1936 he was selected to head the U.S.
Secret Service and during his 11 years on the job reduced
counterfeiting to an all-time low. He retired in 1947.
One of the unanticipated results of the growth
of the FBI was the diminution in importance of the
U.S. marshals, America’s first federal crime fighters.
As Prohibition ended in 1933, the bureau had
reached national prominence. Under Hoover’s
direction, the FBI became increasingly specialized
and professionalized. Unable to keep pace with
these developments, the U.S. marshals were forced
to make the transition to little more than process
servers and court policemen.
Prior to America’s entry into World War II,
the FBI was authorized to gather information re-
garding potential espionage activity. With more
than one million aliens from Axis countries residing
in America, the FBI soon focused its attentions
once more on spying on American residents.
Between 1933 and 1937, the FBI investigated an
average of 35 espionage cases per year. But as the
war heated up, so did FBI investigations, reporting
almost 20,000 cases of suspected espionage during
the war years.
Hoover took one of his most controversial
steps when President Roosevelt removed the
information-gathering limitation on the FBI, allow-
ing the bureau to investigate individuals for their
beliefs rather than actual deeds. However, their
pursuit of Nazi agents during the war would lead
to some spectacular successes, including the 1941
destruction of one of the largest spy rings to operate
in the United States.
State Policing
The proliferation of the automobile in the 1920s
led many states to establish police agencies to han-
dle traffic problems. Maryland created the first of
these in 1916 and was followed by six more states
in 1921. These highway patrol units were typically
small, unarmed, and restricted to enforcing state
highway laws.12 The state police movement lost
momentum between 1923 and 1928, with only
seven states establishing such units, most of which
were of the highway patrol variety.
The onset of the Depression stimulated the
state police movement, leading to the creation of
15 state forces between 1929 and 1941. Of these,
12 were along the highway patrol model. A new
pattern also developed in which earlier state forces

were reorganized into larger forces. Some states
formed highway patrols or state police forces to
replace more specialized units, while others opted
to increase existing manpower or to ease limits on
police powers.
The evolution of the Texas Rangers offers an
excellent example of the need for police depart-
ments to reorganize to meet a changing social cli-
mate. Between 1919 and 1935, the Rangers were
faced with new social problems, including labor
strikes, Mexican border raids, Prohibition viola-
tions, and surging Ku Klux Klan activities, as Texas
made the transition from the frontier era. By the
1930s, the Texas Ranger tradition was in dire
need of updating. Traditionally undermanned, their
numbers were cut back and they were in danger of
obsolescence because of urbanization and modern
science. With the introduction of the automobile
and the train, the Rangers’ days as an effective
mounted police unit became a nostalgic memory,
and in 1935 they were consolidated into the Texas
Department of Public Safety.
As 1941 came to an end, each state had devel-
oped some type of police force based on either the
state police or the highway patrol model. Managing
to stay above the political fray and maintain good
relations with the public, according to historian
David R. Johnson, “until the 1940s, at least, the
state police were America’s elite lawmen.”13
Drug Enforcement
The forerunner of today’s Drug Enforcement Admi-
nistration (1973), the Bureau of Narcotics was estab-
lished in 1930 under the direct control of the
Treasury Department. Most studies trace the incep-
tion of federal drug enforcement to the 1914
Harrison Narcotic Act. Drug enforcement began
the following year, and by the 1920s federal agents
were homing in on Chinese opium smugglers. At
the time of the Volstead Act and the inauguration
of Prohibition in 1920, the Narcotics Division of the
Prohibition Unit of the Revenue Bureau consisted
of 170 agents and 17 offices. In 1922, the drug agents
saw their power expanded with the passage of
the
Narcotic
Drugs
Import
and
Export
Act.
Following a scandal in which drug agents were ar-
rested for accepting payoffs from drug dealers, Con-
gress established the Bureau of Narcotics in 1930 and
removed drug enforcement from the Bureau of
Prohibition.
Prohibition Enforcement
Once Prohibition was legislated into reality, it
dawned on most observers that it was virtually un-
enforceable. Unpopular with both the public and
organized crime, Prohibition agents were drawn
from a relatively weak pool of applicants. The qua-
lifications and pay were so lackluster that many
agents accepted bribes and kickbacks. One agent
was reportedly offered $300,000 per week. In an
era characterized by corruption, it should not be
surprising that many agents were attracted by the
lucrative prospects for graft. The Treasury Depart-
ment fired more than 700 agents for corruption
between 1920 and 1928. The following year, the
Department of Justice took over the enforcement
of Prohibition. In Chicago, Eliot Ness reportedly
had to go outside the Windy City to find enough
agents to fill the ranks of the Untouchables.
The two most famous Prohibition agents were
New Yorkers Izzy Einstein and Moe Smith, better
known as Izzy and Moe, although others referred to
them as “Tweedledum” and “Tweedledee.” The
pair was credited with making a total of 5,000
arrests.
Isadore “Izzy” Einstein and Moe Smith were two of the
most successful and honest Prohibition agents at a time
when 706 agents were dismissed for corruption and in-
competence. Both weighed well over 200 pounds, lead-
ing to their monikers “Tweedledum” and “Tweedledee.”
Izzy and Moe made great newspaper copy during a time
when there was little good news to report. Disguised as
rabbis, bootleggers, or football players, they were cred-
ited with confiscating five million bottles of contraband
liquor and making thousands of arrests. To successfully
prosecute liquor scofflaws, it was necessary to produce
samples of evidence in court. The pair’s modus operandi
began with gaining entry to a speakeasy. After ordering
a drink, they would pour the illegal beverage into a fun-
nel connected by a tube to a flask hidden in one of the

cities soon coveted the duo. They set the record for the
quickest bust in New Orleans, where they made their first
arrest 35 seconds after arriving. In the end, their careers
were short-circuited because of their penchant for pub-
licity, and they resigned in 1925.
Criminology and Police
Professionalism
Shortly after the turn of the twentieth century, the
more theoretical field of criminology emerged with
its emphasis on the behavioral and social aspects of
criminal activity and the accompanying explana-
tions for its causes. In the 1920s, the earliest crimi-
nology textbooks were written by sociologists such
as Edwin H. Sutherland (1924), John Lewis Gillin
(1926), and Talcott Parsons (1926). Between 1930
and 1950, criminology continued to develop as an
academic discipline but was confined to university
sociology programs.
During the early 1900s, the first hesitant steps
were taken toward developing schools for training
law enforcement officers. As previously mentioned,
August Vollmer initiated the first college-level
training programs for police in 1908, when he es-
tablished America’s first formal training for police
officers with his Berkeley Police School, a fore-
runner of in-service and academic programs in
California. The Great Depression, however, halted
the further development of police and criminologi-
cal studies program at the University of California at
Berkeley.
As Vollmer became increasingly identified with
academe in the 1930s, he began to lose some of his
credibility among leading police figures. His efforts
to establish a professional school of criminology at
Berkeley were obstructed both by economic hard
times and by the intransigence of police leaders
who felt that he was concerned more with publicity
than with police training. His goal of creating a
professional police school where police personnel
could be trained at the higher administrative levels
eluded him at Berkeley throughout the 1930s.
However, his former students carried his work
into the 1940s. In 1939, Vollmer’s position at
Berkeley was filled by his protégé Orlando Wilson.
Formerly a police officer in Berkeley, Wilson stud-
ied engineering before returning to policing in
1928. Following Vollmer’s example, he advocated
the use of higher-education facilities for police
training whenever possible. Between 1928 and
1939, Wilson professionalized the Wichita, Kansas,
Police Department and then returned to academic
work. In 1936, during his tenure at Wichita, he
persuaded the political science department at the
Municipal
University
of
Wichita
to
integrate
courses such as criminal law, patrol practices, traffic
control, police administration, and identification
procedures into the existing curriculum.
In 1939, a Bureau of Criminology was orga-
nized within the Department of Political Science at
the University of California at Berkeley, although
11 years would pass before a separate School of
Criminology offered degrees. Wilson was ap-
pointed a professor of police administration in
1939 and in 1950 was promoted to dean of the
School of Criminology. The Berkeley Police Pro-
gram spurred other schools into action. By the end
of the 1930s, the University of Chicago, Indiana
University, Michigan State University, San Jose
State University, and the University of Washington
had established criminal justice programs. Although
they adhered in part to Vollmer’s program, they
emphasized the practitioner and training compo-
nents of the curriculum.
CORRECTIONS
Throughout American history, African Americans
have been disproportionately represented in the
prison system. As more blacks left the South, north-
ern prison statistics reported that blacks were impri-
soned at a higher rate than whites for the same
crimes. One historian suggests that because World
War I drastically reduced immigration, northern in-
dustrialists turned to the South for unskilled labor,
leading to a new migration of blacks to the
North.14 Trading one region’s racism for another,
many of the migrants were victimized by the

discrimination practiced by social and legal agencies
in the North. This in turn would be reflected by
the increase of blacks in northern prisons in the
postwar years. According to the U.S. Bureau of
the Census, in 1926 African Americans made up
9.3% of the adult population but 31.3% of the
prison population.15 Meanwhile, the South per-
sisted with the highest rates of execution and overall
imprisonment, and it also had the highest regional
rate of crime and violence.
As the nation’s economy plunged into depres-
sion, the country’s rate of imprisonment rose from
79 to 137 per 100,000 in the years between 1925
and 1939. According to national surveys, the
United States contained almost 4,300 penal institu-
tions by 1933. Out of a total prison population of
233,632, there were 137,721 housed in state penal
institutions.16
While prison camps and leasing continued to
dominate southern penology in the 1920s, the
1920s and 1930s saw the introduction of the
“new penology” in many northern states with
the implementation of the concepts of diagnosis
and classification. Specialized personnel, such as
psychologists and psychiatrists, were introduced to
the prison environment as well. By 1926, 112 pris-
ons employed either a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
Unfortunately, the professional-to-inmate ratio was
too small to make much of an impact. The same
was true with classification. Although the intention
of classifying prisoners by psychological types was
commendable, again, because of the dearth of qual-
ified therapists on prison staffs, there was little hope
of effective treatment.
Reform efforts directed at classification, educa-
tion, vocational training, and discipline made little
headway in the interwar years, leading noted prison
educator Austin McCormick to report in 1929 “that
prison education was a failure.”17 While most of the
vestiges of the Auburn system, including lockstep
marching, striped uniforms, and silence, were elimi-
nated, many prisons continued to use solitary con-
finement in the “pit” or “hole” during the 1920s and
1930s. Although new prison routine allowed for
more freedom, including communication between
inmates, athletics, and exercise, as late as 1926,
prisoners in Ohio and Illinois were punished in
solitary confinement in small cages, nourished on a
starvation diet of bread and water.
The late 1920s saw the development of the
“big house” prisons, which could hold more than
2,500 inmates. The huge capacity of prisons such as
Stateville, Illinois, and San Quentin, California, saw
the development of more diverse populations, often
leading to complicated social divisions among the
inmates. Managed by a new generation of penal
professionals instead of political appointees, prisons
such as San Quentin and Sing Sing went to great
lengths to root out abusive punishment and prison
labor. At the same time, these institutions attempted
to integrate mass production into the practice of
incarceration.
The Federal Prison System
As Congress became increasingly uncomfortable
with the prisoner leasing systems and state prisons
began refusing federal prisoners, the federal govern-
ment decided to join the prison business in the
1890s. One of the most important developments
in prison reform was the organization of the U.S.
Bureau of Prisons in the late 1920s. With an in-
crease in the number of federal offenses, including
violations of prohibition laws, the three existing
federal prisons were overcrowded, prompting the
federal government to step in and assume some of
the responsibilities.
To deal with the burgeoning number of federal
prisoners during Prohibition, the Bureau of Prisons
converted Alcatraz Island to “a prison of last resort.”
Prisoners who ended up here were considered the
worst of the worst with little hope for rehabilita-
tion. With no privileges and little opportunity for
contact with the outside world, prisoners were not
even allowed to receive original copies of their
mail. To prevent secret messages, prison employees
transcribed the letters before passing them on to the
prisoner. To counter the punitive nature of con-
finement at Alcatraz, inmates were afforded better
food and library facilities than most prisoners.
Alcatraz’s 30 years of serving federal prison castoffs
came to a tumultuous end in 1963, when the
236

federal penitentiary at Marion took its place. Despite
its reputation, few inmates actually served time at
Alcatraz, with its highest population at 302 in 1937.18
Taking the lead in prison reform in the 1930s,
the Federal Bureau of Prisons under Sanford Bates
not only improved training for corrections officers
but also enhanced a number of educational and vo-
cational programs within the prisons. Other innova-
tions followed, including a new type of prison design
known as the “telephone pattern,” which is credited
with placing cell blocks and buildings in order to
maximize the segregation of offenders by type. Bates
also supported a classification program to place
inmates in maximum-, medium-, and minimum-
security prisons. The federal government has also
been acknowledged for reorganizing the parole
system by centralizing its administration in 1930.
Home to America’s first fortification on the Pacific Coast
in the 1850s, Alcatraz Island received its name from
Spanish explorers in the 1770s when the island’s only
inhabitants were pelicans, hence the name Isla de
Alcatraces, or Island of Pelicans. Never sufficiently utilized
by the U.S. Army, the site was turned over to the Depart-
ment of Justice in the 1930s. Envisioning it as maximum-
security facility for housing escape-prone inmates, the
Justice Department also hoped to use “the Rock” to
punish the worst denizens of America’s prison system. It
opened as a maximum-security prison in June 1934. Al-
though it would close in 1963, during its short history it
earned a reputation as “America’s Devil’s Island.” Despite
its physical isolation and prison security there were a
number of unsuccessful and controversial prison escapes.
Prisoners had 20 minutes to eat each meal and were
counted as many as 12 times a day. The prison consisted
of four three-tiered cellblocks that were never fully uti-
lized, with the average inmate population at never more
than 275 prisoners. Under the reign of James A. Johnston,
its first warden, there was a ratio of one guard for every
three prisoners. Contrary to popular belief, no one was
sentenced to Alcatraz; all earned their way through dis-
ruptive behavior at other federal pens. Al Capone,
George “Machine Gun” Kelly, atomic spy Martin Sobell,
and Robert “the Birdman” Stroud (who only raised birds
at his previous prison at Leavenworth) were among its
most famous inmates. Six years after its closure American
Indian activists took over the island hoping to make it
into a Native American cultural and educational center.
In June 1971 U.S. Marshals removed the protestors from
the island, but not before they had destroyed a number
of the island’s prison buildings. In 1972 Alcatraz became
part of the National Park Service and is one of San
Francisco’s most popular tourist destinations.
Prison Industries
Since the early nineteenth century, prison industries
flourished in America, with many prisons showing a
healthy profit. Perhaps the biggest change in prisons
during the interwar era was the rapid decline in the
number of inmates employed in prison industries.
According to prison historian Blake McKelvey, be-
tween 1895 and 1923, anti-labor legislation saw a
drop in employment from 72% to 62%. Leading the
opposition against prison labor was organized labor,
which recognized the unfair business competition
that prisoners posed to free paid workers.19 Be-
tween 1932 and 1940, the proportion of produc-
tively employed prisoners in state and federal
institutions fell from 52% to 44%. Paralleling this
development was the value of goods produced,
which dropped by 25%.
In 1929, Congress passed the Hawes-Cooper
Act, which allowed any state to ban the sale of
any goods made in another state’s prison within
its borders. Although it did not become effective
until 1934, most states had already passed legislation
placing limits on the sale and shipping of prison
products. The passage of the Ashurst-Summers
Act in 1935 would strengthen Hawes-Cooper by
prohibiting transportation companies from accept-
ing prison products for transportation into any state
in violation of the laws of the state and provided for
the labeling of all prison products shipped in inter-
state commerce. Despite the intentions of these sta-
tutes, the death knell of prison industries would
sound with the 1929–1933 Depression, when state
legislatures responded to the needs of unemployed
free workers. Twenty-nine states passed laws re-
stricting the sale of prison goods to government
use only. The passage of these laws in effect elimi-
nated the “industrial prison” as it made the transi-
tion back to its original functions as a custodial and
punishment facility.
One of the unforeseen results in the decline
of prison contracting and leasing and the victory

of free labor was that prisons saw their budgets pre-
cipitously decline. Without any feasible alternatives
to profitable labor, by the 1930s convicts languished
in interminable idleness.
The only form of labor supported by labor was
the state-use system, which saw labor involvement
rise from 33% to 65% between 1915 and 1930.
Support for the state-use system led to the dimin-
ished influence of independent industrial managers
and contractors on prison administrators. According
to the state-use system, prison-manufactured goods
could be produced if they did not compete with
free manufacturers. By 1940, state purchase of fur-
niture, stationary, and other state-used goods had
become mandatory in 22 states. Despite the best
intentions to constructively occupy the prisoners
with work, one estimate in the mid-1930s suggests
that 60% of the prisoners nationwide remained
idle.20 Steps were slowly taken to introduce a mo-
dicum
of
vocational
and
educational
training
programs.
Prisoner Classification
Prisons had dabbled in inmate classification since
the Progressive era. However, without effective re-
habilitation programs, there was little to do with
prisoners once they were classified other than to
let them mix with other convicts. The movement
for prisoner classification began in earnest in the
years leading up to World War I. At that moment,
prison administrators began to apply some of the
findings of the rapidly developing field of the social
sciences. In the process of putting theory into prac-
tice, prison administrators set up clinics to screen
and separate certain types of prisoners, including
the mentally ill and those with low I.Q.s.
In the aftermath of the 1930 Ohio State Prison
fire, in which 322 prisoners died, efforts were di-
rected toward finding better ways to house and
employ inmates as well as better systems of classify-
ing inmates. In the 1930s, classification “advocated
greater institutionalization diversification for reform
goals, along with segregation of types of prisoners.”21
Using various methods, institutions classified pris-
oners on the basis of their medical, psychiatric,
psychological, educational, religious, and disciplin-
ary backgrounds. In addition, attention was paid
toward classifying inmates for treatment according
to their crimes, personalities, and special needs. It
was hoped that classification would lead to attempts
to separate hard-core offenders from those who
could be rehabilitated, that narcotics addicts would
be placed on penal farms, and that minor offenders
could be directed to minimum-security settings.
I Am a Fugitive from a
Georgia Chain Gang
Dramatizing the deplorable conditions of southern
prisons was the 1930s release of the book and mo-
tion picture I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain
Gang. (Georgia was deleted from the movie title
due to legal pressure from that state.) The true story
of Robert Elliott Burns, a World War I veteran
who was sentenced to 6 to 10 years on a Georgia
chain gang for a $5.80 grocery store robbery,
touched a chord with many Americans and was in
part responsible for the exposure (and eventually
the end) of the punitive Georgia chain gangs. Burns
escaped from the prison gang in 1922 and remained
free until 1930. By that time, he had worked his
way up the management ladder at a Chicago news-
paper. On his own volition, he returned to Georgia
on the condition that he would be given a pardon.
However, he was sent back to the chain gang. He
then became the first person to escape a chain gang
for the second time. Assuming a new identity in
New Jersey, he began publicizing the barbaric con-
ditions in Georgia in a series of magazine articles.
These became the basis for a book and then a
movie starring Paul Muni.
Georgia officials were offended and demanded
his extradition. Hearings over this matter turned
into an examination of the Georgia penal system.
Through his attorney, Clarence Darrow, Burns de-
scribed the “sweat box” and other punishments en-
dured by chain gang prisoners, and ultimately the
New Jersey governor refused the request for extra-
dition. In 1945, Georgia repealed the chain gang
system and soon after commuted Burns’s sentence
to time served.

CRIM E AND PUNISHM ENT
The 1920s and 1930s were marked by rampant
lawlessness. Exacerbating rising crime fears were a
combination of factors, including the onset of
Prohibition and the Depression. This era proved
one of the deadliest for peace officers, with an av-
erage of 169 killed in the 1920s and 165 per year in
the 1930s. Police deaths on duty would not surpass
these figures until the 1970s.
The lawlessness and sporadic violence that
gripped the nation during the crisis years led Balti-
more journalist Henry L. Mencken to conclude that
it was safer to kill a man in America “than in any
other civilized society.” According to one 1932 crime
survey of 130 cities in the United States, the total
homicide rate had reached one per 10,000. During
the same period, the combined murder rate for
Wales, England, and Scotland was one per 200,000.
Although studies of individual cities exist dem-
onstrating the characteristic waxing and waning of
crime rates, prior to the 1930s there are no com-
prehensive crime figures for the nation. Most evi-
dence suggests that the crime rate rose after World
War I and the 1920s and that crime rates dropped as
the nation sank into the Depression and continued
to decline into the 1940s.
Despite the run on the banks that inaugurated
the Depression, between 1929 and 1934, two banks
were robbed every day (25 per day are robbed to-
day). Faced with growing demands from the gov-
ernment to crack down on bank robbers and public
enemies, J. Edgar Hoover began a crusade to
change public attitudes about criminals—attitudes
that had formerly elevated desperadoes such as
John Dillinger to hero status.
The Roaring Twenties began with a peculiar
tolerance of crime due in part to Prohibition, which
is credited with criminalizing the behavior of oth-
erwise law-abiding citizens. Stigmatized for break-
ing
Prohibition
laws, many
of
these
citizens
developed sympathy for other lawbreakers. How-
ever, the Kansas City Massacre in 1933 (see sidebar)
and the murderous crime sprees of Bonnie and
Clyde and other Depression-era bandit gangs led
to a public backlash against lawbreakers. Concern
with the random brutality led to support for ex-
panding the role of the federal government in law
enforcement. The deaths of Bonnie and Clyde,
John Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, and others during
the 1930s ended the American tradition of the so-
cial bandit that began with the James brothers and
Billy the Kid in the years following the Civil War.
On June 17, 1933, four law enforcement officers, includ-
ing an FBI agent, were reportedly ambushed and killed
by machine-gun fire in what has become known as the
Kansas City Massacre. Three other FBI agents were
wounded. This being 1933, they were not yet authorized
to carry weapons, but this would change following the
carnage. Although recent research conflicts with the ac-
cepted account of events,28 FBI director J. Edgar Hoover
used its tragic consequences to launch a high-profile
campaign to hunt down public enemies in the nation’s
heartland. In 1934, President Franklin Roosevelt signed
into law nine anticrime bills that enlarged the crime-
fighting powers and jurisdiction of the FBI. Following the
passage of these measures, FBI agents would be respon-
sible for suppressing federal bank robberies, the trans-
portation of stolen property across state lines, and other
crimes and would be allowed to carry and use firearms.
The Teapot Dome Scandal (1924)
No scandal overshadowed the 1920s as much as the
Teapot Dome scandal, which, according to one
source, “proved to be a major watershed in U.S.
political history.”22 Named after an oddly shaped
geological feature near its location in Wyoming,
Teapot Dome was a naval oil reserve that had
been set aside by the government for emergency
use in 1915. But in 1920, Congress passed legisla-
tion to establish private leasing of public mineral
lands. Soon contracts for Teapot Dome and other
oil reserves were given to various bidders with the
support of Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall
(1861–1944). Ironically, in the months before his
death (1923) and the Teapot Dome scandal, Presi-
dent Warren G. Harding had remarked that “if
Albert Fall isn’t an honest man, I’m not fit to be
president of the United States.”
By 1922, the Interior Department was leasing
the emergency oil reserves. As it turned out, Fall

had begun leasing the oil reserves to close friends
without allowing competitive bidding on the prop-
erty. In return, they secretly compensated Fall with
almost $400,000. A subsequent senatorial inquiry
uncovered the scandal, and the government can-
celed the leases with the support of a Supreme
Court decision. In 1929, Fall was found guilty of
bribery and sentenced to one year in prison. It was
the first time a cabinet officer had been jailed for
crimes committed in office. Teapot Dome entered
the American lexicon as a synonym for government
graft and a lingering reminder of the corruption-
plagued Harding administration.
Prohibition and Organized Crime
One of the greatest ironies of the Prohibition era is
that while it was intended to impose virtue on
ethnic Americans through repression, it actually
made them the beneficiaries of the laws intended
to limit their cultural influence. In a short time,
second-generation Italians, Jews, and Poles would
control a $2 billion-per-year illegal industry. No
criminal enterprise is more shrouded in myth than
the development of organized crime and the
growth of “Mafia”-inspired crime syndicates in
the United States. As historian David Johnson suc-
cinctly noted, while some Italian gangsters “bor-
rowed some terms and concepts from the Sicilian
Mafia,” their “basic rationale and structure were
purely American.”23
Modern organized crime was given its greatest
opportunity to flourish thanks to the convergence
of two events: Prohibition and the rise of Benito
Mussolini to the dictatorship in Italy. On his ascen-
dance to power in the early 1920s, Mussolini was
determined to wipe out the Mafia and any other
groups not under his control. While some Mafia
chiefs converted to fascism, others were either im-
prisoned or fled to America, following the exodus
of Italian immigrants that had begun in the 1880s.
But the repressive measures of the fascist regime
were only partially responsible for the temporary
collapse of the Mafia in Italy. When the fascists
abolished elections, they hit the real source of Mafia
power, namely, its partnership with and control of
political candidates and leaders, so when it lost con-
trol of the political apparatus, its demise was as-
sured. Not until the death of Mussolini and the
end of World War II did the Mafia regain its politi-
cal influence.
Envisioned by its supporters as a cure for
America’s social ills, Prohibition instead created
new ills and in the process gave birth to modern
organized crime. Seduced by the lure of beer
money, peace officers were bribed like never be-
fore. While organized gangs had operated in urban
America since the 1830s, they functioned with the
support of political machines. With the onset of
various Progressive reform efforts and the changing
face of urban America, by 1914 most of the gangs
were in disarray. With red-light abatement in full
sway, vice centers from New Orleans’ Storyville to
San Diego’s Stingaree were closed down. It seemed
that the era of the gangs had ended by the end of
World War I.
However, the birth of Prohibition resuscitated
organized gangs. With tens of thousands of speak-
easies flourishing throughout the country, bootleg-
gers had to replenish the illegal liquor supply either
by smuggling across borders or by making their
own illegal potions. It was not long before alcohol
became an underground cottage industry with en-
tire neighborhoods besieged by the foul odors of
bootleg brew.
In New York, Bugsy Siegel, Frank Costello,
Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, and other future
mob luminaries collaborated to make $12 million
a year from booze alone. In Chicago, Al Capone
and his mentor John Torrio made tens of millions
of dollars. Capone was the best-known American
of his era, and although his career as Chicago crime
boss was rather ephemeral, in 1930 alone he made
$100 million.
One of the more perplexing questions left un-
answered from this era is why J. Edgar Hoover re-
fused to recognize the rise of criminal syndicates in
big cities from coast to coast. While the Bureau of
Narcotics, big-city police forces, and crusading
journalists recognized the growth of organized
crime, the FBI seemed to ignore this phenomenon
until the 1950s. As late as 1959, Hoover employed
240

400 agents in the New York City office investigat-
ing communists and only four concentrating on or-
ganized crime. Although several unsubstantiated
reasons for Hoover’s inaction have been cited, in-
cluding the blackmail of his personal life and horse-
betting debts to the mob, others have offered more
convincing explanations. Obsessed with maintain-
ing the bureau’s reputation for high conviction
rates, Hoover set his sights on kidnappers and
bank robbers, who were much easier to catch
than complicated cases of organized criminal activ-
ity. With access to the best lawyers that money
could buy, mob figures were often acquitted.
Hoover also feared that his agents could be cor-
rupted in the process of taking on the mob.
Racket Busters
Prohibition introduced modern organized crime to
urban America. In response, cities such as New
York responded with special prosecutors such as
Thomas Dewey to round up the denizens of orga-
nized crime ranging from bookmakers and loan
sharks to mob leaders, including Charles “Lucky”
Luciano.
Born in Michigan, Thomas Dewey (1902–1971) practiced
law after earning his law degree from Columbia Law
School in just two years. In 1935, he was appointed by the
New York governor to investigate statewide organized
crime. Over the next two years, he successfully attacked
police corruption and organized crime figures. Not only
was he credited with restoring integrity to the New York
Police Department, he engineered the demise of crim-
inals Lucky Luciano and Dutch Schultz. Dewey became a
national hero and revered racket buster in his time, sur-
vived death threats from Dutch Schultz, and served as
New York governor three times. As New York’s crusading
district attorney, Dewey is considered the quintessential
law-and-order prosecutor.
No crime fighter captured the public’s imagi-
nation during the Prohibition years more than Eliot
Ness (1902–1957), who rose to prominence as head
of Chicago’s “Untouchables” during the heyday of
nemesis Al Capone. After being chosen to lead a
special Prohibition unit, Ness personally selected
members of his unit. But despite the credit
accorded the Ness legend, the Untouchables, as
with most Prohibition-oriented law enforcement
units, was rather ineffective in its war against
Capone’s bootleg empire. Following Capone’s
conviction by the IRS, Ness turned to Capone sub-
ordinates such as Frank Nitti and later to moon-
shine operations in America’s heartland.
Ness and his Untouchables made great news-
paper copy but were rather underwhelming in the
war against alcohol. Ness would survive three assas-
sination attempts by Capone’s henchmen, including
a drive-by, a car bomb, and a runover. He would
have more success as public safety director in
Cleveland, Ohio. Following the repeal of Prohibi-
tion, he moved to Cleveland in 1935 and made
short work of a police department riddled with cor-
ruption, forcing several hundred policemen to
resign and sending at least a dozen officers to state
prison. By the 1940s his squeaky-clean image had
been tarnished by divorce and a drunk-driving case
and he left law enforcement in 1942.
Kidnapping
Most historians trace the first kidnapping for ransom
in America back to the 1874 abduction of “little
Charles Ross.” This case was never solved and his
body never found. No era saw more kidnappings
than the 1920s and 1930s. In 1931 alone, there
were 282 reported kidnappings. According to ran-
som expert Ernest Kahlar Alix, two types of ransom
cases predominated: the ransom of wealthy (un-
harmed) businessmen and the ransom slayings of
children. The most prominent ransom cases of this
era involved the deaths of Bobby Franks by
Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold (1924) and
Charles A. Lindbergh Jr. by Bruno Hauptmann
(1932).
While organized criminals were often kid-
napped by other members of the underworld and
Black Hand members targeted Italian immigrants,
in the 1930s organized kidnap rings began to vic-
timize private citizens. The 1933 kidnappings of
William A. Hamm Jr. by Alvin “Kreepy” Karpis
and Charles F. Urschel by the George “Machine
Gun” Kelly gang ended with the payments of

ransoms of $100,000 and $200,000, respectively,
and the safe release of both victims. By this time,
the public was clamoring for the suppression of this
crime.
No criminal case of this era garnered more
publicity
than
the
kidnapping
of
the
20-
month-old son of America’s aviation hero Charles
Lindbergh, the first person to fly solo across the
Atlantic Ocean. At this time, kidnapping was not
a federal offense, and the FBI had no jurisdiction in
the case. However, once the baby’s body was dis-
covered, President Herbert Hoover ordered all federal
agencies to participate in the subsequent investiga-
tion. The arrest and trial of Bruno Hauptmann
became one of the most sensational murder trials
of the century. Although the evidence seemed
overwhelming—Hauptmann had theransommoney,
and experts testified that he made the ladder from
wood in his attic and that he had written the ransom
note—questions linger to this day as to Hauptmann’s
culpability. Nonetheless, he was electrocuted in
1936.
The Lindbergh case foreshadowed the sensa-
tionalism that would plague news reporting over
the next century. What made this possible was the
“emergence of modern media technology,” which
made this trial an even “more compelling national
drama than the Lizzie Borden case” four decades
earlier.24 As Walter L. Hixson makes clear in his
examination of sensational crime trials, with the
emergence of the radio and movie newsreels in
the 1920s, America became linked in a “single
media culture.”25
By most accounts, the Lindbergh kidnapping
case had major ramifications for law enforcement
when Congress passed the “Lindbergh Law” in
June 1932, giving the FBI jurisdiction in kidnap-
ping cases where the victim had been taken across
state lines. Kidnapping was also elevated to a capital
offense. However, at least one authority argued that
it is historically false to attribute the passage of this
legislation to the Lindbergh kidnapping. Sociologist
Ernest Kahlar Alix suggests that “the Lindbergh case
initiated neither the noncapital nor the capital fed-
eral legislation, despite the fact that the legislation
came to be known as the Lindbergh Law.”
To support his case, Alix notes that the 1932 federal
ransom legislation was introduced four months ear-
lier than the Lindbergh kidnapping and had noth-
ing to do with the “ransoming or ransom slaying of
any child.”26
Capital Punishment
Between 1918 and 1959, more than 5,000 Amer-
icans were executed, with few generating much
publicity. Except for high-profile capital cases,
such as those of Sacco and Vanzetti and Bruno
Hauptmann, most executions were followed with
little fanfare. In 1937, the first Gallup Poll on the
death penalty found that a vast majority of Amer-
icans supported the death penalty. For the next
20 years, support would remain strong for capital
punishment.
During the 1930s, America used the death pen-
alty more than any previous decade in American
history. According to one study, 1,676 executions
took place in this decade, compared to an average
of 1,148 per decade between 1880 and 1920. How-
ever, this spate of executions coincided with a rising
population and murder rate.27 In the never-ending
quest for more humane methods of execution,
death by lethal gas was introduced by Nevada in
1924. During the 1930s, seven states adopted this
method.
AM ER ICAN VI OLENC E
America witnessed every variety of violence in the
crisis decades. Labor violence, race riots, mob war-
fare over the liquor trade, and police brutality con-
tributed to a climate of fear and social disorder as
the country entered the 1920s. In the 1930s, indus-
trial violence resulted in dozens of killings as police
and army troops battled strikers during a national
cotton textile strike and several steel strikes. One
of the last memorable labor confrontations resulted
in the Memorial Day massacre of 10 strikers during
the 1937 Republic Steel strike. Killings also resulted
from assaults by strikers against strikebreakers, as was
242

the case in 1922, when union workers savagely
murdered 19 scabs at the Herrin massacre in
Illinois.
Perhaps the worst race riot of the interwar
years, the 1921 Tulsa, Oklahoma, riot was ignited
after a black resident was accused of rape and ar-
rested. When rumors of a lynching reached the
black community, a group of armed blacks hurried
to the jail to protect the potential victim. After
gunfire broke out, the overwhelming force of
whites chased the blacks back into their neighbor-
hood. In the ensuing violence, at least 60 blacks
were killed, although the director of gravediggers
later reported burying 150 victims. By the time
martial law was declared, virtually the entire one-
mile-square black district had been burned to the
ground.
In February 2001, nearly 80 years after whites laid waste
to Tulsa’s black community in the Tulsa race riot, a state
panel investigating the violence agreed that reparations
should be paid to survivors. The result of a four-year ef-
fort to uncover the truth of one of the nation’s deadliest
race riots, the Tulsa Race Riot Commission recommended
that the 118 survivors and descendants be compensated
for their losses, adding that the death toll was probably
as high as 300.
One of the turning points in racial violence
came in 1935 during the Harlem riot. Here the racial
pattern of rioting diverged from tradition. Formerly,
whites initiated race riots, leading to violence be-
tween the races. But the Harlem riot featured not
fighting between the races but rather mostly black
rioters attacking white property and the police.
While few deaths resulted, property damage reached
more than $2 million. The subsequent commission
impaneled to look into the causes, following an
example set by the 1919 Chicago riot, blamed the
outbreak of violence on police brutality, discrimina-
tion, and unemployment.
If there was one positive development in race
relations during the crisis years, it was the decline in
lynchings. According to the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, between
1882 and 1927, almost 5,000 mostly African Amer-
ican victims perished at the hands of lynch mobs.
Lynchings substantially declined in the early 1900s,
with an average of 62 a year between 1910 and
1919. By the late 1930s and 1940s, lynchings
became a much rarer event.
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre
(1929)
No event signified the brutality of the bootlegging
wars and the brazenness of the 1920s more than the
St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, the biggest gangland
murder of the era. This event was the culmination
of a long-term war in Chicago between the
Capone gang and the North Side gang led by
Dion O’Banion. By 1929, O’Banion and numerous
allies had been killed, leaving George “Bugs”
Moran as Capone’s last obstacle to taking over the
bootlegging empire.
In an attempt to lure Moran to his demise,
Capone arranged for a gangster to offer Moran a
load of hijacked liquor that would be delivered to
the gang’s garage headquarters. Several Capone
henchmen, dressed in police uniforms, drove up
to the garage and lined up the seven occupants
against the wall, a group that included a gang
groupie and local optometrist. Figuring that it was
just a routine police roust, the gangsters offered no
resistance and meekly stood face first against a wall.
All seven were cut to ribbons with submachine fire.
However, Bugs Moran was not among them, hav-
ing overslept that day. Moran arrived shortly after
the massacre, and when he was queried as to the
perpetrators, he responded, “Only Capone kills like
that.” Initially, there was a split opinion as to the
killers. The police were held in such low esteem to
many that it seemed altogether possible that they
were the perpetrators. But public opinion soon
turned against Capone.
Any question was put to rest when ballistics
expert Calvin H. Goddard (1891–1955) tested the
bullets and reported that they did not come from
any machine gun owned by the Chicago Police
Department. In 1930, machine guns and bullets
found in the home of Fred Burke, a known killer
for hire, matched the St. Valentine’s Day bullets.
Chicago authorities were so impressed with his

acumen that they decided to establish a special in-
stitute under the leadership of Goddard. The foren-
sic expert would spend three months in Europe
visiting police laboratories before returning to set
up the Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory in
Evanston, Illinois. The facility would eventually
become part of Northwestern University Law
School, and as a professor, Goddard would teach
the world’s first courses in police science.
Murder Incorporated
For most of its existence, Murder Incorporated, a
group of hired killers composed of a combination
of second-generation Jews and Italians, worked be-
hind the scenes in anonymity. During Prohibition,
ethnic mobs had discovered the advantages of
working together, and by 1930 rules of cooperative
behavior had been laid down and territories
mapped out by a national board of directors, which
reportedly included Lucky Luciano, Frank Costello,
Meyer Lansky, and other notables. As the days of
Prohibition came to a close, organized crime di-
verted its attention to other lucrative businesses,
ranging from loan-sharking, gambling, and narco-
tics to prostitution and labor racketeering.
Organized crime turned to Brooklyn-based
Murder Incorporated for “muscle” and for the hir-
ing of hit men. The group was led by Albert “Lord
High Executioner” Anastasia and Louis “Lepke”
Buchalter as the enforcement arm of the mob.
Each contract murder had to be approved by the
national board. The killing of peace officers and
journalists was prohibited, and the killers were not
available to civilians. During the 1930s, the killers
are suspected of at least 300 murders in New York
alone. They also introduced the terms contracts and
hits into the popular underworld lexicon.
One enduring slogan and principle credited to
the gang was the notion that “we only kill each
other.” In 1935, this ethic was tested when crime
lord Dutch Schultz demanded that Murder Incor-
porated kill Thomas Dewey in violation of organi-
zation protocol. When his request was voted down,
Schultz vowed to do the job himself. In response,
Schultz was given the death penalty by his mob
associates, and a contract on his life was approved.
Arthur Flegenheimer (aka Dutch Schultz) was
killed shortly thereafter as he ate dinner at a
Newark chophouse.
In 1940, Murder Incorporated came to the at-
tention of law enforcement when killer Abe Reles
turned state’s evidence following his implication in
several murders. His testimony stunned the New
York district attorney as Reles laid out the existence
of a national crime syndicate that had probably
committed more than 1,000 murders across the
country. As to the moniker Murder Incorporated,
most sources credit it to a New York police re-
porter named Harry Feeney. Reles’s testimony
would lead to the end of the gang and would
send several killers to the electric chair, including
Louis “Lepke” Buchalter (1897–1944), one of the
highest-ranking mob bosses to ever be executed.
Reles met his ignominious end when he either
committed suicide or was pushed out a window.
NOTABLE TRIALS
The Scottsboro Trials (1931–1937)
On March 25, 1931, nine black youths aged 13 to
20 were arrested at Paint Rock, Alabama, accused
of raping two white girls as they traveled as hoboes
on a freight train headed south from Chattanooga
through Alabama. The subsequent trial and sen-
tencing of the so-called Scottsboro Boys focused
international
attention
on
the
segregated
Jim
Crow South and “exercised a profound influence
on the way that criminal justice came to be admin-
istered in the United States forever after.”29
Rape was still a capital crime in Alabama, and
the rape of two white women at the hands of Afri-
can Americans in this era was considered acceptable
grounds for lynching. Despite the suspects’ claims
that they did not rape the girls or ever see them
prior to their arrests, armed farmers waited for the
delivery of the prisoners at the Jackson County seat.
It was not long before the nine men were confined
in a cage in a small Jim Crow jail fearing for their
lives. The National Guard was called out for

protection, and the prisoners were moved to an-
other jail for safekeeping.
The nine men were indicted by an all-white
jury in Scottsboro, and the following week the cap-
ital case began. The accused were not offered law-
yers or any contact with each other, typical of such
trials in the Deep South in this era. Although phy-
sicians testified that after examining the two women
they could find no evidence of a rape, this had little
influence on the racially charged atmosphere. In the
words of Haywood Patterson, who later published
his own account of the trial, “Color [was] more
important than evidence down there.”30
The subsequent evidence presented against the
accused consisted primarily of the allegations pre-
sented by the two women. Since the defendants
could not afford counsel, the local judge appointed
the entire bar of Scottsboro, which included six men,
to defend the Scottsboro boys. Of these, only one
agreed to comply, and then only on the morning of
the trial. With little preparation or time to investi-
gate, the final reckoning was a forgone conclusion,
and all eight defendants were sentenced to death by
the all-white jury. Less than four months after the
trial began, eight of the nine men were sentenced
to the electric chair. The ninth was a 14-year-old
who was given life imprisonment because of his small
stature and youthful appearance. Haywood Patterson
proved one of the most visible of the nine and soon
began to learn to read and write while he awaited his
death. The widespread publicity accorded the case
won the young men support from around the world,
including contributions from Albert Einstein and
writers Thomas Mann and Maxim Gorky.
On November 8, 1932, the Supreme Court
reversed its convictions in Powell v. Alabama, citing
the fact that the defendants had been denied their
right to adequate counsel. This was a landmark de-
cision in that for the first time the Supreme Court
took steps to guarantee that almost all criminal de-
fendants would actually have counsel. It did this by
requiring the government to appoint and pay for a
lawyer if a defendant could not do so. The Court
based its decision to reverse the original convictions
on the protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth
Amendment, which prohibits states from depriving
any person of life, liberty, or property without due
process of law. However, many issues were still un-
settled, and the case left unresolved “whether ap-
pointed counsel would be required in noncapital
cases.”31 Although the Court’s decision was based
on the specifics of the Scottsboro case, the ruling
came to be viewed as requiring appointment of
counsel for young, inexperienced, illiterate, and in-
digent defendants in capital cases.
In 1935, the Supreme Court ruled unani-
mously in Norris v. Alabama, after the retrial of de-
fendant
Clarence
Norris,
that
his
conviction
violated his right to equal protection of the laws
under the Fourteenth Amendment. Chief Justice
Charles Evans Hughes noted in the ruling that no
black had served on a county jury within the mem-
ory of any living person and found the evidence
sufficient to reverse Norris’s conviction. Powell v.
Alabama (1932) and Norris v. Alabama (1935) be-
came collectively known as the Scottsboro cases.
In their second trial, four of the nine were con-
victed. One was sentenced to death and the other
three to 75 to 99 years in prison. The rape indict-
ments were dismissed against the other five defen-
dants. Despite the severity of the sentences, in some
quarters the result was seen as a victory during this
era of rising racial violence and lynchings.
Lawyers continued the appeals process until
1937 as Patterson and his fellow defendants lan-
guished in jail. Tired of waiting in jail for a crime
he did not commit, Patterson made an escape at-
tempt in 1948 and was arrested two years later in
Detroit, but the Michigan governor refused to sign
extradition papers. The three other defendants were
released on parole between 1943 and 1950.
In 1938, the Supreme Court ruled in Johnson v.
Zerbst that according to the Sixth Amendment, the
government is required to pay for a lawyer if a
defendant could not afford one. But this applied
only to federal criminal trials. Since almost 90% of
criminal prosecutions were tried in state courts, this
ruling had little impact. In 1942, the Court refused
to extend the Johnson decision to state trials. Until
Gideon v. Wainwright in 1963 (see Chapter 12),
“states remained free” to “prosecute and convict
indigent defendants in one-sided proceedings in

which the state was represented by a lawyer and the
defendant was left to fend for himself.”
The Scottsboro case captured international at-
tention at a time when African American defen-
dants rarely made it so far through the court and
appeals
process.
For
police
historian
Samuel
Walker, the legacy of this case and the subsequent
Powell decision was that it was the “first organized
attack on race discrimination in the southern crim-
inal justice system.”32
CONCLUSIONS
By the 1920s, prison reformers were once again
grappling with the horrendous state of prison affairs.
In the wake of a series of prison riots in Illinois,
Colorado, Kansas, and New York, the National
Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement
issued a report detailing the deplorable state of the
nation’s prisons. Following in the footsteps of Pro-
gressive reformers, the authors of what became
known as the Wickersham Report linked the current
climate of lawlessness in America with the failure of
the prisons to rehabilitate inmates. Noting the im-
pact of immigration and unemployment on crime
rates as well as the concomitant costs of crime, the
report placed the blame for failure of the prison sys-
tem squarely on the backs of prison administrators
who promulgated arbitrary rules and punishments.
Prison populations dramatically increased, as
did some crime rates, in the 1920s. With the
growth in interstate regulatory laws and Prohibi-
tion, the number of state and federal prisoners in-
creased as well. In response, the federal government
created the Federal Bureau of Prisons. With the
jobless rate spiraling out of control, 33 states passed
laws in the 1930s that prohibited the sale of prison-
made commodities on the free market.
After 100 years of success, with the impetus of
the Depression and rising unemployment, the
1930s saw federal and state legislation eliminate
the sale of prison products on the open market as
prisons returned to the more punitive and custodial
roots of an earlier era. Despite advances in classifi-
cation and efforts at reform, America’s prisons
became overcrowded, leading to tension and prison
riots.
The 1920s and 1930s had fanned the flames
of a burgeoning civil rights struggle that would cul-
minate with the civil rights crusade of the 1960s.
Changes in national attitudes and public opinion
toward race indicated that Jim Crow and Plessy v.
Ferguson were losing support. No juxtaposition of
images makes this clearer than the 1925 Ku Klux
Klan march through the streets of Washington,
D.C., and the 1939 concert honoring black singer
Marian Anderson in front of the Lincoln Memorial.
The concert drew more than 75,000 people after
Anderson was barred from singing in Constitutional
Hall by the Daughters of the American Revolution.
Prohibition and the Depression, like other piv-
otal events of this era, ultimately contributed to
making the federal government even stronger. No
episode in the early twentieth century conspired to
increase the mandate of the criminal justice system
more than did Prohibition. According to criminal
justice historian Lawrence M. Friedman, “Prohibi-
tion filled the federal jails; it jammed the federal
courts,” and “under prohibition, the idea of a national
police force became no longer unthinkable.”33 Not
the final word but a warning of what was to come,
historian Claire Bond Potter noted that “the legacy of
the transformation of federal policing during the
New Deal has been a continuing war on crime, one
that is fully integrated into daily political and civic life
in the United States.”34
In 1933, following the repeal of Prohibition, a
news publication revealed that the final cost of Pro-
hibition was more than one-third greater than the
national debt of $22 billion and $10 billion more
than the cost of America’s participation in World
War I, which was $26.361 trillion. A tabulation of
Prohibition killings totaled 1,170 citizen and 512
agent deaths between 1920 and 1932.35
On the other hand, with criminal syndicates
deeply embedded in American society by the end
of Prohibition, they were organized enough to suc-
cessfully turn their attention to traditional vices,
such as gambling, drugs, and prostitution. By the
1930s, American policing was dismal if not ineffec-
tive. While the hiring of more police officers has

proved a panacea for contemporary policing, a
1926 report noted that the New York City police
hired 3,522 officers in 1926 and 1927 but saw only
a 4% drop in crime. Even the 1931 Wickersham
Commission concluded that many police depart-
ments were corrupt, untrained, and poorly admin-
istered.
Police

such
as
J.
Edgar
Hoover, August Vollmer, O. W. Wilson, and
others would help guide the transformation and
professionalization movement that would lead to
tremendous improvements in American policing
by the 1950s. The end of Prohibition and the
Depression would usher in an era of police profes-
sionalism. With the diminished influence of politi-
cal machines on police departments, efforts at
reform could be directed at raising salaries and im-
proving hiring practices, training, technology, and
investigative procedures.
Point–Counterpoint
National Prohibition: Legislating Morals (1930)
Between 1920 and 1933 the government of the United
States prohibited the manufacture and sale of alcoholic bev-
erages. Following his election to the presidency in 1928,
Herbert Hoover felt that more knowledge of prohibition en-
forcement was needed. In 1929 he created the National
Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement, chaired
by former Attorney General George Wickersham. There was
little consensus among commission members about prohibition
enforcement practices. When the Commission’s final report
was released in 1931, its pessimistic approach to Prohibition
added more ammunition to the wets who supported repeal. In
the following passage from the report the authors assess the
difficulties of enforcing Prohibition. The second excerpt is
from an address given at Harvard University in support of
Prohibition. The author, Charles W. Eliot, president of
Harvard University from 1869 to 1909, notes an association
between alcoholism, venereal disease, and threats to “white
civilization.”
A number of causes of resentment or irritation at the
law or at features of its enforcement raise difficulties
for national prohibition. A considerable part of the
public were irritated at a constitutional “don’t” in a
matter where they saw no moral question. The stat-
utory definition of “intoxicating” at a point clearly
much below what is intoxicating in truth and fact,
even if maintainable as a matter of legal power, was
widely felt to be arbitrary and unnecessary. While
there was general agreement that saloons were wisely
eliminated, there was no general agreement on the
universal regime of enforced total abstinence. In
consequence many of the best citizens in every com-
munity, on whom we rely habitually for the uphold-
ing of law and order, are at most lukewarm as to the
National Prohibition Act. Many who are normally
law-abiding are led to an attitude hostile to the stat-
ute by a feeling that repression and interference with
private conduct are carried too far. This is aggravated
in many of the larger cities by a feeling that other
parts of the land are seeking to impose ideas of con-
duct upon them and to mold city life to what are
considered to be their provincial conceptions.
Other sources of resentment and irritation
grow out of incidents of enforcement. In the nature
of things it is easier to shut up the open drinking
places and stop the sale of beer, which was drunk
chiefly by working men, than to prevent the
wealthy from having and using liquor in their
homes and in their clubs. Naturally when the in-
dustrial benefits of prohibition are pointed out, la-
boring men resent the insistence of employers who
drink that their employees be kept from tempta-
tion. It is easier to detect and apprehend small of-
fenders than to reach the well organized larger
operators. It is much easier to padlock a speakeasy
than to close up a large hotel where important and
influential and financial interests are involved. Thus
the law may be made to appear as aimed at and
enforced against the insignificant while the wealthy
enjoy immunity. This feeling is reinforced when it
is seen that the wealthy are generally able to pro-
cure pure liquors, where those with less means may
run the risk of poisoning through the working over
of denatured alcohol, or, at best, must put up
with cheap, crude, and even deleterious products.

Moreover, searches of homes, especially under state
laws, have necessarily seemed to bear more upon
people of moderate means than upon those of
wealth or influence. Resentment at crude methods
of enforcement, unavoidable with the class of
persons employed in the past and still often em-
ployed in state enforcement, disgust with informers,
snoopers, and under-cover men unavoidably made
use of if a universal total abstinence’ is to be
brought about by law, and irritation at the inequal-
ities of penalties, even in adjoining districts in the
same locality and as between state and federal
tribunals—something to be expected with respect
to a law as to which opinions differ so widely—
add to the burden under which enforcement must
be conducted.
Resentment is aroused also by the govern-
ment’s collecting income tax from bootleggers
and illicit manufacturers and distributors upon the
proceeds of their unlawful business. This has been a
convenient and effective way of striking at large
operators who have not returned their true in-
comes. But it impresses many citizens as a legal rec-
ognition and even licensing of the business, and
many who pay income taxes upon the proceeds
of their legitimate activities feel strongly that illegit-
imate activities should be treated by the govern-
ment as upon a different basis.
Lawyers everywhere deplore, as one of the
most serious effects of prohibition, the change in
the general attitude toward the federal courts. For-
merly these tribunals were of exceptional dignity,
and the efficiency and dispatch of their criminal
business commanded wholesome fear and respect.
The professional criminal, who sometimes had
scanty respect for the state tribunals, was careful so
to conduct himself as not to come within the juris-
diction of the federal courts. The effect of the huge
volume of liquor prosecutions, which has come to
these courts under prohibition, has injured their
dignity, impaired their efficiency, and endangered
the wholesome respect for them which once ob-
tained. Instead of being impressive tribunals of
superior jurisdiction, they have had to do the
work of police courts and that work has been
chiefly in the public eye. These deplorable condi-
tions have been aggravated by the constant presence
in and about these courts of professional criminal
lawyers and bail-bond agents, whose unethical
and mercenary practices have detracted from these
valued institutions.
… I remember well that, twenty years ago or
thereabouts, I was entertained by the Harvard Club
of Louisiana at a large dinner in the city of New
Orleans, where I sat next to a gentleman who was
generally recognized in New Orleans as the leader
of their Bar. I noticed the moment we sat down
that there was an extraordinary variety of things
to drink on the table; and I also noticed that my
neighbor took everything that was passed and in
large quantity, so much so that I began to be a little
anxious about his condition later. But suddenly he
turned to me and said, “Mr. President, do you
know that the New Orleans Bar, and I as its leader,
are going in for complete prohibition in the State of
Louisiana?” I could not help expressing surprise that
he was going in for that. Whereupon he said,
“Well, you don’t suppose that we, the members
of the Bar, expect to have the law applied to us,
do you?” (Laughter) He was positively a vigorous
advocate of complete prohibition for Louisiana,
but all the time had not the slightest notion that a
prohibitory law could be applied to him or any of
his friends, or would be.
That opened my eyes somewhat in regard to
the expectation with which the sudden, unanimous
support of prohibition came to pass in the Southern
States. It was nearly unanimous, you remember,
and remains so to this day. The Southern States
are the strongest supporters in this country of pro-
hibitory legislation.
Then, some time later, I found myself attend-
ing a Harvard Club dinner in the State of Missouri.
There were many things to drink at that dinner
also. I was informed that some of the leading citi-
zens of Missouri, engaged in manufacturing opera-
tions, were going to move their plants over into the
State of Kansas. I observed later that a large number
of Missouri manufacturers did move their plants

over into the State of Kansas, and learned, on inquiry,
that those manufacturers had made up their minds
that they could conduct their businesses much better
in a State where a prohibitory law existed than they
could in a State where the law did not exist.
I have had the delight of passing my summers
for more than forty years—yes, it is fifty-two years
since I first began to go to Mount Desert in
summer—in the State of Maine. There I observed
that the prohibitory law in Maine was not observed
at all excepting in communities where, as one guest
has said to-night, the great majority of the popula-
tion was in favor of prohibition. There alone was
the distribution of alcoholic drinks restrained. I
lived there fifty summers, observing the fact that
the prohibitory law in Maine was not generally
enforced; observing that the summer residents of
the State of Maine, who, as you know, live all
along the shore and in several of the beautiful lake
regions, paid no attention to the prohibitory law.
What inference did I draw from that experi-
ence? Simply that unless the strong majority of
any government unit in the States where prohibi-
tory laws exist was in favor of prohibition, the law
would, as a matter of fact, not be enforced.
But further: It was obvious that no single State
could possibly enforce prohibition, because it had
no power to prevent the manufacture of alcoholic
drinks outside the State or their importation into it.
You must have national prohibition to make pro-
hibition effective. It must be nation-wide, or it sim-
ply cannot be enforced.
So I supported for many years in Massachusetts,
not prohibition, but local option; but then I learned
that the sale of distilled liquors in saloons licensed
to sell light wines and beer cannot be prevented.
Nobody should advocate the repeal of the Volstead
Act except those who believe in the unrestricted
sale of alcoholic beverages. I ought perhaps to say
that I took wine or beer when l was in the society
of people who were using them. I never had any
habit of drinking them at home; but I always took
them when I was in the company of men or
women who were using them. I had no feeling
that alcohol was bad for everybody, or bad for
me. I never knew alcohol to do me any harm;
but then I never drank distilled liquors at all.
When the United States in the spring of 1917
went to war, you remember that with the support
of all the best civilian authorities and of the officers
in the Army and Navy, our Government enacted a
prohibitory law for the regions surrounding the
camps and barracks where the National Army was
being assembled. The Act proved to be effective
and highly beneficent.
Then I said to myself, “If that is the action of
my Government to protect our soldiers and sailors
preparing to go to war, I think it is time for me to
abstain from alcoholic drinks altogether.” It is only
since 1917 that I have been a total abstainer; but
that is now six years ago, and I want to testify here,
now, that by adopting total abstinence, after having
had the opposite habit for over seventy years, one
loses no joys that are worth having, and there is no
joy-killing about it. On the contrary, I enjoy social
life and working life more since I ceased to take any
alcohol than I did before.
That talk, gentlemen, about joy-killing and
pleasure-losing, and so forth, is absolute nonsense
for a man who has any sense himself….
We all know that our Puritan ancestors and
our Pilgrim ancestors were not persons who culti-
vated the finer joys of life. They left behind them
the great architecture of England, and its parks
and its music. The Pilgrims came over from
Holland, having lived there for ten or fifteen years
in sight of all the glorious Dutch paintings, sculp-
ture, and architecture. They abandoned all those
things, and settled in the wilderness, where there
was little possibility of cultivating the love of
beauty and little power, too, of resisting the theo-
logical dogmas they had imbibed, which taught
that human nature was utterly depraved, and
that most of the human race were bound for a
fiery hell.
Those are the people from whom the leading
thinkers and doers of America sprang; and it is
naturally inevitable that we, their descendants,
should lack the love of beauty in nature and in
art, and even in music. We do lack it. The Pilgrims

and the Puritans lacked it to an extraordinary
degree.
Where did they find their pleasures? Largely in
drink. They drank hard at weddings, funerals, and
all public festivals. We have that inheritance, but
can we not resist and overcome it? Can we not
grow up into a love of beauty in nature and in
art? Can we not cultivate in ourselves the delight
in music—in singing and in playing instruments?
We are not hopeless in those respects; and those
are the things we have got to learn to love, in order
to escape from this wretched evil of alcoholism.
But how shall we do it? We must cultivate in
ourselves the finer inspirations, the purer delights,
and the greater joys in art and in work. But,
more than that, we have got to practice resistance
to acknowledged manifest evils in our common
life.
That has always been my way of living, from
day to day, in the practice of my profession. From
the beginning, that was the way I lived. I attacked
what seemed to me a plain, acknowledged, mani-
fest evil, and advocated the best remedy I knew for
that evil. That is just what we have got to do to-
day, gentlemen, about this abominable evil of alco-
holism associated with venereal disease; because that
evil will kill us unless we kill it. By “us” I mean the
white race, and particularly the American stock.
Must we not accept the proposition that we must
either destroy alcoholism and venereal disease, or
those evils will destroy us? I believe that to be the
plain truth; and I want to call on every lover of his
kindred and of his country, hourly, daily, year after
year, to contend against these evils, alcoholism and
venereal disease, until they are obliterated from the
world. Finally, may we not reasonably distrust the
legal view that has been repeatedly presented here
this evening, namely, that the rights and privileges
of decent and vigorous people should not be
abridged for the sake of indecent or weak people
who abuse their privileges?

CRITI CAL THINKING QUESTIONS
1. How did the passage of the Eighteenth
Amendment affect patterns of criminality and
the American criminal justice system?
2. What is meant by the phrase “police

4. What role did the media play in creating an
image of lawlessness during this era? How did
law enforcement exploit the rise of sensation-
alism in the press?
5. How did the crisis decades affect American
opinion on the death penalty?
6. Discuss the growth of organized criminal ac-
tivity in this era.
7. What impact did the civil rights movement
have on the criminal justice system?
8. Compare and contrast regional differences in
crime and criminal justice in the crisis era.
9. What was J. Edgar Hoover’s impact on federal

8. The phrase “third degree” refers to police-
sanctioned brutality, which was more prevalent
during the pre-Miranda rights era. In the 1930s,
parlance ranging from “shallacking” and “massag-
ing” to “breaking the news” and “giving him the
works” was synonymous with giving a criminal
suspect the third degree. Many police departments
condoned the beating of suspects to extract confes-
sions. Methods of third-degree interrogation in-
cluded the water cure (which involved forcing
water down the nostrils of supine victims), beatings
with a rubber hose, and drilling into the nerves of
the teeth.
9. For a detailed account of Seabury and his crusade
against corruption, see Mitgang (2000).
10. The concept of “public enemies” has been usually
credited to the FBI when in reality it was the
brainchild of the Chicago Crime Commission, a
watchdog group formed in 1919 to investigate
crime in Chicago. The commission issued its first
public enemies list in 1930; it was headed by none
other than “Public Enemy Number One” Al Ca-
pone. The FBI later capitalized on the “public en-
emies” idea and released a “Ten Most Wanted List.”
11. The bureau had actually been renamed the United
States Bureau of Investigation in 1932. However,
confusion ran supreme when the Department of
Justice began a two-year experiment with a Division
of Investigation that also included a Bureau of
Prohibition. The public soon could not differentiate
between Bureau of Investigation special agents and
Bureau of Prohibition agents, leading to the per-
manent name change to Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation in 1935.

of prisons paid any wages. In 1940, Auburn was
paying its agricultural workers five cents per day and
shop employees 20 cents per day.

World War II transformed American society more
than any other war in its history. During the
1940s, the federal government became much
more centralized and united the population as
never before. Wartime industry not only ended
the Great Depression but also began several dec-
ades of unrivaled prosperity. But old fears still lin-
gered. Fear of communist subversion at home and
rising juvenile crime and the battle for civil rights
presented the criminal justice system with new
challenges in the 1940s and 1950s.
Fortunately, the end of World War II did not
end on a somber note like World War I, which saw
America reeling from race riots, labor strife, police
strikes, and attacks on civil liberties. In sharp con-
trast, the postwar years were marked by great ad-
vances in civility, with race relations improving in
different regions and murder rates declining. Rather
than slipping into the post–World War I violent
morass surrounding Prohibition, the 1940s and
1950s seemed tame in comparison.
However, there was a darker side, a harbinger
of sorts that would find resonance in the 1990s. Sen-
sational rampage killings periodically dominated the
headlines in the 1940s and 1950s. When Howard
Unruh stepped out on a busy Camden, New Jersey,
street in 1949, mowing down 12 of his neighbors
in 13 minutes, few could have imagined the school-
yard and workplace shootings that would punctuate
the 1990s.
Returning home from the war, servicemen
were confronted with a changing home front.
Many returned with different cultural values than
the ones they went off to war with. In the years
following the war, outlaw motorcycle gangs were
organized by “groups of young men, many newly-
returned soldiers, who formed motorcycle clubs
and rejected normal civilian lifestyles. In the next

several years their behavior became not so boister-
ous as surly, less rebellious than openly criminal.”1
In the aftermath of a motorcycle riot in Hollister,
California, in 1946 the phrase “outlaw motorcycle”
was reportedly used for the first time, referring to
the actions of a gang that evolved into the notori-
ous Hell’s Angels.
Others challenged the status quo on a less bel-
licose level but would still disrupt the social fabric
and arouse fear among conservatives. On May 21,
1957, a San Francisco police officer arrested book-
store owner Lawrence Ferlinghetti for selling “ob-
scene literature” shortly after purchasing a copy of
poet Allen Ginsberg’s Howl and Other Poems from
his establishment. In the 1950s, “beats” or “beat-
niks,” such as Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac,
captured media attention with their writings as
they tapped into a reservoir of discontent among
the younger generation.
While informal networks of gambling halls
operated in various parts of the country prior to
the war, no one could have imagined the devel-
opment of the American gambling scene begin-
ning in the 1940s or how widespread gambling
would become by the end of the twentieth cen-
tury. In the months before Pearl Harbor, several
gambling clubs and fledgling casinos were operat-
ing in Las Vegas, where gambling was legalized in
1931. However, most visitors still came to marvel
at Hoover Dam or perhaps to take advantage of
the easy divorce laws.
TH E LAWGI VERS
While cultural tensions seemed to have diminished in
America since the 1920s, they were still a source of
social conflict. In December 1941, just weeks after
the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt issued an executive order suspending natu-
ralization proceedings for immigrants from enemy
nations (Italy, Germany, and Japan). The new legis-
lation required these immigrants to register, restricted
their movements, and prohibited them from owning
items that could be utilized for sabotage, such as
cameras and shortwave radios. In reality, not all en-
emy aliens were treated the same. German and Italian
aliens would receive more compassionate treatment
compared to the Japanese.
The Japanese had been barred from immigrat-
ing to the United States by the Immigration Act of
1924, and by 1924 only 110,000 Japanese lived on
the mainland, mostly in California; another 150,000
lived in Hawaii. The outbreak of World War II
ignited simmering racial tensions on the West
Coast, where many Japanese Americans had lived
for generations. An amalgamation of factors, in-
cluding racism, nativism, and wartime security con-
cerns, led President Roosevelt to issue Executive
Order 9066 on February 19, 1942. Less than six
months after America’s entry into the war, the presi-
dent signed into law the order that relocated more
than 100,000 Japanese Americans, most of whom
were American citizens, from the West Coast to
10 relocation camps in remote locations, including
Jerome, Arkansas, and Heart Mountain, Wyoming.
There, American citizens who had committed no
crimes were locked behind barbed wire and crowded
into accommodations resembling minimum-security
prisons.
Most constitutional historians consider this one
of the greatest violations of individual rights in the
history of the country. Almost overnight, thousands
of Japanese Americans, without trial or hearings,
were forced to dispose of their homes, personal
property, and businesses, leading to tragic conse-
quences
for
many
families.
However,
almost
18,000 Japanese American men left the camps and
served gallantly in combat.
Throughout the war years, Japanese Americans
protested their treatment, claiming that their civil
rights had been violated. However, in 1944 the
Supreme Court supported the federal government
by a vote of six to three in Korematsu v. United
States, citing current national security concerns. It
was not until the waning months of the war that
the federal government ended a shameful chapter in
American legal history by taking steps to close
down the camps. However, many were still held
prisoner until mid-1946, almost one year after the
end of hostilities.

Joseph McCarthy and
Communist Hysteria
Fear of communism in America had existed since the
Bolshevik revolution in 1917. However, with the
birth of the atomic age and Russian nuclear power,
tensions over the Soviet threat were heightened.
Soon, politicians such as Richard M. Nixon and
Joseph McCarthy would use communist-bashing as
a strategy for political advancement.
As early as 1947, President Harry S. Truman
was pressured to inaugurate the communist “witch
hunts” by creating loyalty boards to check on re-
ports of communist sympathizers in the federal gov-
ernment. Thousands were investigated as innuendo
superseded evidence in the hunt for communist
spies. Out of this venomous cloud of hysteria
emerged Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy.
During the 1950s, paranoia over communist sub-
version swept America. No politician is more asso-
ciated with the excesses of this era than McCarthy,
who took advantage of the political climate of the
time to further his career by destroying the working
lives of hundreds of individuals.
Beginning with the 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts, there
have been several attempts to limit civil liberties at the
expense of the Constitution. One of the more notable
twentieth-century examples involved the 1947 House
Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), which at-
tempted to outlaw the Communist Party. The HUAC
had been created in the 1930s and had become in-
creasingly oppressive in its dedication to stifling dissent
and liberty of thought. In 1947, the HUAC targeted
Hollywood and in the process destroyed the livelihoods
of the “Hollywood Ten” (writers, directors, and produ-
cers). Their hearings proved a travesty of justice. The
committee refused to allow nine of the witnesses to
make prefatory statements on their civil rights privi-
leges. When the 10 refused to give yes-or-no answers
to the questions “Are you now or have you ever been a
member of the Communist Party of the United States?”
and “Are you a member of the Screenwriters’ Guild?”
they were found guilty of contempt, jailed for a year,
and illegally blacklisted by Hollywood. The so-called
American Inquisition contributed to the climate of fear
that would allow Senator McCarthy to ride roughshod
over the Constitution and the Fifth Amendment in
the 1950s.
As chair of the Senate Committee on Govern-
ment Operations, McCarthy accused the military of
harboring communist infiltrators. In response, the
army demanded that he support his allegations, and
on April 22, 1954, an estimated 20 million viewers
watched the televised Army-McCarthy hearings.
Deviating little from his aggressive no-holds-
barred style of examining witnesses, McCarthy
seemed at the outset of the hearings to overmatch his
63-year-old opponent and attorney for the army,
Joseph Welch. But he had taken up a battle that
would turn against him when he challenged the
U.S. Army to purge supposed communists from
the Pentagon. Welch proved more than a match
for his antagonist. After McCarthy launched into
his usual relentless attacks, Welch asked the senator
to support his accusations. After a withering barrage
of cross-examination, McCarthy accused Welch’s
Boston firm of harboring a communist. Welch re-
sponded in a calm, dignified manner. His response is
considered a high point of civility in an era domi-
nated by baseless attacks on persons and civil liberties.
Welch ended his rebuke of McCarthy with the
familiar, “Have you no decency left at all?”—a ques-
tion that must have resonated with many of the mil-
lions of viewers. Although the hearings continued
for five more days, McCarthy’s inquisition had
been brought to a stunning climax, and two months
later he was censured by the Senate. “Tail-gunner
Joe” would die in 1957 from the effects of alcohol-
ism. (Welch would enjoy a scintilla of celebrity as a
lecturer and as an actor, playing a judge in the 1959
James Stewart vehicle Anatomy of a Murder.)
Brown v. Board of Education
of Topeka
Since the Supreme Court’s Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)
ruling, everything from maternity wards to morgues,
even prisons and polling places, was either segregated
or for whites only. While white schools were
well staffed and maintained, black schools, particu-
larly in the South, were typically single-room shacks
without toilets or heat. It should be little wonder,
then, that illiteracy among America’s largest racial

minority was commonplace. Among the most im-
portant spokespersons in the battle to end the injus-
tice of “separate but equal” educational systems was
Thurgood Marshall. As the head of the Legal Defense
and Educational Fund of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),
Marshall represented the plaintiffs in what would be-
come known as Brown v. Board of Education.2
When 11-year-old Linda Brown decided that
she did not want to make the long ride to school
from her home in Topeka, Kansas, when there was
a school just blocks away, she sued the Board of
Education. The board ruled that since she was
African American, she must attend an African
American school despite its distance from her
home. The Topeka court responded that the
“buildings, transportation, curricula, and educa-
tional qualifications of the teachers” at her black
school were equal to those provided to white stu-
dents as mandated in the Plessy v. Ferguson decision.
When several other African American children
in other parts of the country sued to switch from
segregated schools as well, the Supreme Court
agreed to hear the case. Represented by a legal
team headed by Thurgood Marshall, between 1952
and 1954 the nation’s highest court listened to testi-
mony before taking six months to conclude by a
unanimous vote that separate educational facilities
were not equal in the arena of public education.
In 1954, the Supreme Court struck down the
principle of “separate but equal,” which had but-
tressed legally sanctioned segregation as unconstitu-
tional. The Court’s decision called on states to
move “with all deliberate speed” to desegregate,
but most ignored the order. During a painfully
slow process, the NAACP would lead the civil
rights struggle by challenging specific segregationist
systems through a series of individual lawsuits.
In 1957, the NAACP won a court order that
allowed nine black students to enroll in an all-white
Little Rock, Arkansas, high school. In response,
the segregationist governor ordered the Arkansas
National Guard to surround the school to prevent
the students from entering. Following a riot by
white citizens, President Dwight D. Eisenhower
federalized the National Guard and sent in 1,000
members of the 101st Airborne to protect the
nine teenagers, the first time since Reconstruction
that U.S. troops were ordered to the South to pro-
tect the rights of black citizens. While some ques-
tion Eisenhower’s intentions, to many it was clear
that he was concerned more with enforcing federal
law than with protecting the students.
The U.S. Supreme Court
President Roosevelt placed his stamp on the
Supreme Court with his nomination of former
law professor William O. Douglas (1898–1980) in
1936. During a 36-year tenure, longer than any
other justice in history, Douglas often shocked
America with his opinions. His best-known work
was associated with civil liberties, opposing censor-
ship and the death penalty, and even granting the
Rosenbergs a stay of execution in 1953 (leading to
a call for his impeachment). A staunch supporter of
the Bill of Rights, his steadfast support of the First
Amendment angered many, particularly in the
1960s, because he refused to impose any restrictions
on the publication of “obscene” material.
One of the most influential chief justices in
American history, Earl Warren (1891–1974) was
nominated to the Supreme Court by President
Eisenhower in 1953 after Warren become the first
three-time elected governor of California. Over the
next two decades, Warren placed his indelible liberal
stamp on the Court, leading Eisenhower to declare
that his nomination was one of the worst mistakes of
his presidential administration. It is often deceptive
to identify the Supreme Court by the name of its
chief justice, but in rare instances (in the nineteenth
century, John Marshall and Roger B. Taney had
similar influence), the chief justice can influence
the direction of the court in such a way that the
court is overshadowed by the chief justice. A testa-
ment to Earl Warren, his court is one of the few
in American history to be so identified (i.e., “Warren
Court”). According to one study of the legal profes-
sion, “Chief Justice Earl Warren changed the legal
landscape of America more than any other judge
except Chief Justice John Marshall.”3 His tenure
was marked by a judicial activism that made the

Court an active participant in the campaign for social
change and civil rights.
Among the Warren Court’s most significant rul-
ings was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas
(1954), which overturned the earlier decision of
Plessy v. Ferguson, which established the doctrine of
“separate but equal” public facilities for whites and
African Americans. Warren’s court held that separate
but equal facilities were intrinsically unequal, taking
the first major strides toward ending segregation not
only in education but also in all other facets of
American life as well. In 1966, the Court profoundly
altered law enforcement with the Miranda v. Arizona
decision, which ruled that defendants must be made
aware of their rights to counsel and that anything
they say can be used against them in a trial (see
Chapter 12 for more on this decision).
The grandson of slaves, Thurgood Marshall (1908–1993)
was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and educated at several
universities before graduating first in his class at the
Howard University Law School in 1933. Shortly after
graduation, Marshall was hired by the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Colored People. Between
1940 and 1960, he served as the director of the organi-
zation’s Legal Defense and Education Fund.
Marshall rose to national prominence in the civil
rights struggle of the 1950s. In 1954, he helped convince
the Supreme Court to declare segregation unconstitu-
tional in the Brown v. Board of Education decision. Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal
district judge in 1961, and four years later President
Lyndon Johnson made him the nation’s first black solici-
tor general. In 1967, Marshall became the first African
American Supreme Court justice. Over the next 24 years,
Marshall would stamp his enduring imprint on civil rights
law in the United States.
LAW ENFOR C EM ENT
The 1940s and 1950s witnessed police departments
across the nation continue the trend toward pro-
fessionalization. Following trails blazed by Bruce
Smith and Raymond Fosdick, police administrators
began to upgrade standards for new officers while
casting off the yoke of political interference and
manipulation of police forces by political bosses
and ward leaders. By the 1930s, it had become clear
that the only way to gain the public’s trust and
respect was to reduce the influence of politicians,
train and educate police officers, and promote an
image of professionalism in the eyes of the public.
Police reformers such as William H. Parker and
Orlando W. Wilson personified the model of profes-
sional, impartial law enforcement. Both eschewed
political involvement in professional decision mak-
ing, and both would write new chapters in their ca-
reers as they took office in Los Angeles and Chicago,
respectively, in the wake of police scandals.
It had been more than 20 years since the Boston
Police Department’s unsuccessful attempt to union-
ize. Similar to the union movement of the post–
World War I era, police union activities in the 1940s
were stimulated by wartime inflation. Despite the
support of AFL-CIO affiliates, the International
Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) vehemently
opposed unionization, arguing in 1944 that police
unions were “contrary to the basic nature of police
duties.” Ultimately, the police union movement was
stopped by a combination of IACP opposition and the
banning of police unions by police authorities in Los
Angeles, St. Louis, Detroit, Chicago, and other cities.
Those officers who refused to cooperate were fired.4
Orlando W. Wilson
Orlando “O. W.” Wilson (1900–1972) succeeded his
mentor August Vollmer on the faculty at the Univer-
sity of California after winning a national reputation
for cleaning up the Wichita, Kansas, police depart-
ment. When the IACP adopted a “Law Enforcement
Code of Ethics” in 1957 as a standard for ethical
police conduct, it borrowed in part from Wilson’s
“Square Deal Code,” which he developed in 1928
as chief of police in Wichita. Wilson taught police
administration at Berkeley for several years before
leaving to fight in World War II. He returned to
the university in 1950 as dean of the School of Crim-
inology, and despite attempts to diminish the aca-
demic standing of the criminology program, over
the next decade he elevated the program to one of
the best in the country. Sensitive to criticism that he
lacked a PhD and was a poor lecturer, Wilson was

most comfortable when visiting police departments,
where his real acumen was appreciated.
Wilson resigned his position at Berkeley to be-
come commissioner of the Chicago Police Depart-
ment in 1960 after Mayor Daley promised him
there would not be any political meddling. Wilson
reorganized the number of police districts to eradi-
cate remnants of the patronage system and estab-
lished the Internal Investigative Division to root
out police corruption. By hiring hundreds of new
employees, 1,000 police officers were released from
clerical duties to pursue criminals on the streets.
Wilson watchers had learned to expect the unexpected.
In 1966, he invited police critic and civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr. to police headquarters to discuss
how to improve interactions between the police and
African Americans. King was quick to draw comparisons
between his treatment by southern police officers and
Wilson’s respectful approach. Wilson retired from the
force in 1967. Of his books and articles, his most influen-
tial was Police Administration (1963).
William H. Parker and the Los Angeles
Police Department
The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is one
of the most storied and controversial police agencies
in American history. During the Prohibition era,
corruption reached into the highest levels of the
department, and despite attempts by its chief,
August Vollmer (1923–1924), to reform the force,
Depression- and Prohibition-related corruption per-
vaded city politics unabated. To Vollmer’s credit, he
reorganized the department and implemented drastic
changes that led to more efficient administration and
scientific investigation.
Although the 1930s saw the introduction of
police radios, improved communications, a border
patrol, and a new police academy, the tumultuous
years following Vollmer’s stint as police chief con-
tinued to be characterized by political patronage
and corruption. In the late 1920s, police chief James
Edgar Davis resigned after a major bootlegger testi-
fied that he had paid the chief $100,000 per year for
police protection.
In 1939, many corrupt high-ranking officers
were purged from the ranks, ushering in an era of
reform and professionalism. In 1950, William Henry
Parker (1902–1966) was appointed police chief, a
position he would hold for the next 16 years.
Born in Lead, South Dakota, William H. Parker moved to
California in the 1920s and joined the Los Angeles Police
Department (LAPD) in 1927. At night he studied law,
earning his degree in three years. His rise through the
ranks was meteoric before leaving the force to fight in
World War II. Following the war, he helped organize new
police systems in Munich and Frankfurt, Germany. Re-
turning to the LAPD, he was named police chief in 1950.
As police chief, Parker implemented higher stan-
dards for police officers and encouraged his recruits to
pursue additional academic training. An advocate of
professionalism, Parker introduced the Internal Affairs
Division; coauthored the board of rights procedure,
which guaranteed the separation of police discipline
from municipal politics; and founded the Bureau of
Administration.
Almost as skilled as FBI director J. Edgar Hoover in
the arena of public relations, Parker used the radio and
then television show Dragnet to promote himself and the
LAPD, which became a nationally recognized police de-
partment in the 1950s. The 1952 Kefauver crime investi-
gation commended Parker’s department for its crime-
fighting prowess. The 1957 publication of Parker on
Police, edited by O. W. Wilson, did much to enhance
Parker’s impact on the professionalization of American
policing. Parker’s tenure as police chief was tarnished by
racial conflict in Los Angeles, culminating in the 1965
Watts riots. Parker regarded the growing liberal shift of
the 1960s with some suspicion, and in 1962 he was
accused of racial bigotry and discrimination by a group of
Los Angeles religious leaders. Despite a public outcry for
his resignation, he refused to step down. Parker died of
heart failure in 1966.
Federal Law Enforcement
The outbreak of World War II saw the mandate
of the FBI swing from chasing gangsters to more
sophisticated cases involving spies, espionage, and
intelligence gathering. During the war, Hoover
shifted the focus of the FBI toward fighting the
activities of the communists and fascists, and in
1939 President Roosevelt placed Hoover in charge
of domestic counterintelligence, a role that suited

him well. The years surrounding World War II saw
the rapid expansion of the FBI, with the number of
agents increasing from 896 in 1940 to 4,370 in
1945 and appropriations rising from $8.8 million
to $44.2 million.5
Hoover solidified public support by collaborat-
ing on books and films such as The FBI in Peace and
War (1943) and The House on 92nd Street (1945). He
took credit for the capture of nine German saboteurs
(six would be executed) off Long Island in 1942,
although recent research indicates that one of the
Germans gave up his comrades to save his own life.
In the 1950s, FBI Director Hoover continued
his hunt for subversives in a transition from hunting
“Hot War” Nazi saboteurs to Cold War commu-
nists and spies. Although Hoover’s FBI performed
admirably in the war years, during the post-1945
Cold War years, Hoover once again reverted to
Red-baiting tactics as the FBI’s war against the
Communist Party led to his veneration among con-
servatives and loathing and fear among liberals.
During the 1950s, the FBI gathered evidence that
uncovered the Klaus Fuchs atomic spy ring and led
to the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for
espionage activities. Hoover allied his organization
with his close friend Senator Joseph McCarthy dur-
ing the communist “witch hunt” of the 1950s and
wrote the book Masters of Deceit: The Story of Com-
munism in American and How to Fight It (1958),
which detailed his strategies for defeating commu-
nism and contributed to the growing hysteria over
Soviet expansion. Hoover continued his masterful
manipulation of popular entertainment with the re-
lease of the hagiographic The FBI Story (1959). Also
published was Don Whitehead’s best-selling book
by the same name.
In 1950, the FBI introduced its list of “Ten Most
Wanted” fugitives. The first Number One on the list
was a convicted train robber and murderer named
Thomas J. Holden. Director Hoover loved publicity,
and with this new strategy he found a perfect tool
for trumpeting the FBI’s war against the underworld.
What is less known is that Hoover probably bor-
rowed the idea from a newspaper reporter who
wrote a popular story based on names and descrip-
tions of the 10 fugitives the FBI would most like to
apprehend. According to the bureau, the list was cre-
ated to publicize certain fugitives. As testimony to its
success rate, more than one-quarter of those captured
since its inception were located through the assistance
of citizens familiar with the list.
The fugitives placed on the list are submitted by
the 56 FBI field offices and then reviewed by the
agency’s Criminal Investigative Division and the
Office of Public and Congressional Affairs. Criminals
who are selected for the list must either have lengthy
records or pose a serious threat to the public. If a
criminal is already notorious, it is doubtful he or
she will make the list. The changing nature of Amer-
ica’s crime problem can be documented by each
decade’s most wanted lists. In the 1950s, it was dom-
inated by bank robbers, car thieves, and burglars,
whereas in the 1960s it was dominated by radicals
wanted for the destruction of government property
and kidnapping. Most recently, terrorists and orga-
nized crime figures have predominated, along with
serial killers and drug kingpins.
CORRECTIONS
The American declaration of war on Japan, following
on the heels of the attack on Pearl Harbor, brought
out strong expressions of patriotism from the most
unlikely of places: America’s prisons. Prisoners not
only volunteered blood to the Red Cross but also
purchased war bonds. According to a new Selective
Service Act, all convicts were required to register for
the draft. Many who were allowed to enlist did so. As
prisons and prisoners lent their hand to the war effort,
the number of inmates declined for the first time in
more than a decade, dipping from 190,000 in 1940 to
less than 120,000 in 1943.6
America’s entry into World War II led to a tem-
porary correctional philosophy that found expression
in vocational training in support of the war effort.
Soon prison assembly lines were turning out twine,
model planes for pilot training schools, army mat-
tresses, shoes, assault boats, and even aircraft engines.
Institutions made the transformation to factories,
churning out a wide range of products, with perhaps
98% of all convicts engaged in the work.7

Paralleling the war effort was the willingness
of qualified teachers, counselors, and psychologists
to help staff prison administrations. By the time
the war ended in 1945, the American prison system
had made the transition from a warden-dominated
authoritarian system to one that embraced the
developing social sciences and that increasingly
relied on professional treatment in dealing with
criminals.
One of the foremost American penologists of his era,
Joseph Edward Ragen (1896–1971) rose to prominence
as the reform-minded warden of the Illinois State
Penitentiary at Joliet in the 1940s and 1950s. During his
tenure at Joliet, Ragen eliminated the barn-boss system,
which created a hierarchy of power among the inmates,
worked on beautifying the prison grounds, and intro-
duced a policy for allowing prisoners to volunteer for
medical research experiments. He would receive a spe-
cial award for his prison’s contribution to research on
hepatitis and malaria. As a penologist reformer, he was
credited with introducing progressive programs of
rehabilitation, vocational training, and educational pro-
grams, including college-accredited courses, while at the
same time maintaining strict discipline among his
charges. During his 25 years at Joliet-Stateville, his strict
control transformed the institution into a “paramilitary
institution.” However, in an era when many facilities
were plagued by escape and riots, Joliet-Stateville did
not report any riots or escapes.8
While the prison population increased slightly
between 1930 and 1940 from 121 to 132 per
100,000, by 1950 America’s inmate population
had declined to 110 per 100,000. As the soldiers
returned from the war, prison populations began
to increase once more. By 1950, African Americans
represented 7% of the population of Michigan but
made up 40% of the prison population. As foreign-
born white immigrants became a rare presence in
correctional facilities (in 1946 only 3.2% of Ameri-
can prisoners), their places were filled by Hispanics,
blacks, and Native Americans. One explanation for
the rising number of inmates was the increasingly
punitive nature of drug penalties in the postwar
years.9 By the mid-1950s, Louisiana enacted man-
datory prison sentences from between 5 and 99
years for minor narcotics violations.
Introduced in 1932, by the 1950s the “tele-
phone pole” plan of penitentiary flourished from
California (Soledad, Tracy, and Vacaville) and
Texas (Eastham and Ferguson units) to Massachusetts
and Connecticut. In this plan, cell blocks, dining
halls, chapels, shops, and administrative offices di-
verged from a central corridor. This design better
accommodated new treatment programs, main-
tained security, and offered inmates a new openness
with the introduction of floor-to-ceiling security
windows.
Despite advances in treatment and the decreas-
ing emphasis on punitive methods, the 1950s were
plagued by numerous prison riots, with one of
the largest occurring in 1952 at the State Prison
of Southern Michigan, resulting in the death of
one inmate. A subsequent investigation by the
American Correctional Association concluded that
the riot was caused by poor sentencing and parole
practices, overcrowding, lack of professionalism at
all levels, enforced idleness, inadequate funding,
and the political domination of management.
Between 1950 and 1955, more than 47 riots broke
out in American prisons.
Although several outbreaks of prison violence
took place in the South, the major prison riots oc-
curred in northern and western prisons. One of the
explanations for the dearth of southern prison riots
was the fact that large penal farms were the domi-
nant form of incarceration in the South. Therefore,
it was more difficult to foment a riot in these con-
ditions than in the fortress-like settings of the
northern penitentiaries.
While most southern states had at least a cen-
trally located penitentiary, the majority of prisoners
languished in the plantation-like settings of the im-
mense prison farms. With little opportunity for
rioting or other mass expressions of resistance, to
express their contempt for the punitive system, pris-
oners resorted to self-mutilation or escape. One of
the more shocking examples of protest took place
on the Louisiana prison farm at Angola, when 37
prisoners slashed their heel tendons with razor
blades in 1951 to remonstrate against the intolerable
conditions at what was characterized as “America’s
worst prison.”10

Modeled after Auburn prison, Louisiana’s first peniten-
tiary was opened in Angola in 1834. Located 60 miles
north of Baton Rouge, it is now one of the nation’s
largest medium-maximum security prisons. Closer to a
prison farm than a traditional prison today, it lies on
28 square miles on a floodplain along the eastern bank
of the Mississippi River. Known as both Angola and
Louisiana State Penitentiary, it is now home to some
2,000 inmates, with the majority serving life sentences.
Prior to the American Civil War prisoners were often
leased out to private contractors. It has been estimated
that almost 3,000 inmates died under the brutal condi-
tions on the plantations and farms where they had been
leased. The land for the present incarnation of the
prison was purchased from an inmate-leasing family in
1901. Currently farming is considered its main industry,
while prison factories churn out license plates, mat-
tresses, brooms, and mops. Today the prison consists of a
primary prison and six “outcamps.” Prisoners have access
to a number of law libraries and increased recreational
and work choices. The prison is best known today for its
prison rodeo, which was profiled in the 1998 book God
of the Rodeo by Daniel Bergner, and attracts thousands
of visitors each year.
Several commissions were convened to study
prison conditions in the 1950s. In 1953, the Ameri-
can Prison Association identified the causes of riots
as relating to official indifference, substandard per-
sonnel, lack of professional leadership and profes-
sional programs, excessive size and overcrowding
of institutions, and unwise sentencing and parole
practices. Much of the criticism was leveled at the
“big house” design of the 1940s, but few if any
remedies to the situation were offered.
The prosperity and declining crime rates of the
1950s gave rise to a rehabilitative optimism and led
to more input by behavioral scientists. Working on
the assumption that most inmates were psychologi-
cally disturbed, a therapeutic orientation gained in-
creased support among correctional administrators.
Borrowing a page from the inmate classification
systems of the earlier twentieth century, in the years
following the war, teams of professional psycholo-
gists,
sociologists,
vocational
counselors,
case-
workers, and other specialists worked together to
create a case history for each inmate. Prisoners
could then be assigned to the appropriate prison
for treatment and rehabilitation.
CRIM E AND PUNISHM ENT
The 1940s and 1950s were punctuated by a number
of sensational crimes. The 1950s were inaugurated on
January 17, 1950, with the Brinks robbery, the big-
gest heist in American history up to that time. While
the FBI would unravel the case, none of the
more than $1.2 million was ever recovered. In an
event that eerily resembles the rampage killings of
the 1990s, war veteran Howard Unruh stepped out
on a Camden, New Jersey, street in 1949 and for no
apparent reason killed 12 of his neighbors in less than
15 minutes. In 1957, James Dean–wannabe Charles
Starkweather, with girlfriend in tow, embarked on a
murderous spree in rural Nebraska. On the surface,
they seemed like typical teenagers except for one
important difference: their youthful rebellion in-
cluded murdering 11 persons during an eight-day
rampage through two states. Further demonstrating
that crime was no longer the bailiwick of the big city,
novelist Truman Capote would chronicle the 1959
murder of a close-knit farm family in rural Kansas in
his groundbreaking book In Cold Blood (1965).
Providing the inspiration for the television series
The Fugitive, on July 4, 1954, Dr. Sam Sheppard de-
scribed a “bushy-haired intruder” who bludgeoned
to death his pregnant wife and knocked him out. The
public was fascinated by the case, which became one
of the most notorious murder trials of the 1950s. In
the moralistic atmosphere of the mid-1950s, the case
featured a well-to-do handsome doctor, a pregnant
wife, a secret lover, and a mysterious killer, all feeding
the public’s curiosity and creating a media sensation.
Sheppard was found guilty of second-degree murder
in 1954, and his conviction would be overturned
12 years into a life sentence because the judge in
the original case “did not fulfill his duty to protect
Sheppard from inherently prejudicial publicity which
saturated the country.”11
During the 1990s, an ongoing investigation by Sam
Sheppard’s son, Sam Reese Sheppard, and private investi-
gators uncovered evidence that has led some authorities to
link the murder of Marilyn Sheppard to the family window
washer, who was currently serving time for another homi-
cide. Sam Sheppard Jr. believed that there was sufficient

evidence to warrant a civil suit, charging the State of Ohio
with wrongful imprisonment. The subsequent three civil
trials proved to be three more media sensations. Facing a
judgment that could have cost the state millions of dollars,
the state mounted a spirited defense. After a brief delib-
eration, a jury on April 12, 2000, ruled unanimously in fa-
vor of the state. This case, like other controversial cases
that seem to linger in the American consciousness, de-
monstrates the continuing advances in DNA and other in-
vestigative technologies. It also demonstrates how history
is an ongoing process, particularly in the arena of modern
crime and punishment.12
The Specter of Organized Crime
During the 1930s and 1940s, Hoover’s FBI had carte
blanche to chase Nazi saboteurs, Russian spies, and
black marketeers, ignoring the more threatening
criminal threat of organized crime syndicates. By
the 1950s, it was impossible to deny the existence
of organized crime on the national level. In 1950,
Senator Estes Kefauver convened a committee to
investigate racketeering. The Senate Special Com-
mittee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce,
better known as the Kefauver Committee, would
subsequently hold hearings in 14 cities and listen to
testimony from over 600 witnesses, many of whom
testified to the existence of a sinister nationwide
criminal conspiracy known as the “Mafia.”
Thanks to the introduction of the television,
Americans were treated to the Kefauver Commit-
tee hearings, the longest-running television series
of 1950–1951 and the first significant investigation
of organized crime in America. Numerous crime
figures and politicians were introduced to a national
audience as the hearings were convened in city after
city. The hearings reintroduced the public to the
Bill of Rights as the phrase “taking the Fifth”
became part of the American lexicon. Following
the denouement of the hearings, the committee
recommended tightening up the law against the
Mafia, corrupt politicians, and other racketeers.
The Kefauver Committee hearings were a landmark tele-
vision event. These were the first Congressional hearings
to be broadcast to a national audience. They were not
even supposed to have been televised until a last-minute
decision. Television was still a new medium in 1951 and
there were few choices for television viewers, which in-
sured a large audience. Television ownership in New York
City alone (where the hearings were being taped) had
increased from 29% to 51% over the previous year. In his
1993 book on the 1950s, David Halberstam noted this
“meant that for the first time in any metropolitan area in
any city of the world there were more homes with tele-
visions than without.” The hearings were filmed in black
and white and featured a cast of characters that included
mob boss Frank Costello, “the Prime Minster” of orga-
nized crime. He objected to having his face filmed so one
of the technicians suggested just focusing on his hands.
Viewers were captivated by his hands as he drummed the
table, gripped a water cup, tore paper to small bits, as his
hands glistened with sweat. In the end the findings of the
committee chronicling the existence of an Italian Ameri-
can Mafia was accepted by most viewers—although
modern scholarship debunks most of its findings.
Kefauver won an Emmy Award from the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences for special achievement for
offering the American people the chance to observe the
workings of the national government on television.
Apalachin Conference
The 1957 Apalachin Conference of organized crime
kingpins in rural upstate New York is generally con-
sidered a turning point in the war on organized crime.
Prior to this episode, J. Edgar Hoover had denied the
existence of organized crime syndicates for almost
30 years. However, when a New York State police
officer stumbled on the clandestine meeting of some
60 mobsters at the home of Joseph Barbara Sr.,
Hoover could demur no longer. Soon the FBI was
forced into the fray, beginning a campaign of wire-
tapping and electronic eavesdropping that would see
few triumphs before the 1980s. Part of the problem
was that having denied the existence of the Mafia or
any monolithic crime organizations for decades, the
FBI was forced into a game of catch-up. This was
most noticeable in the agency’s early attempts to in-
terpret surveillance, when they could not recognize
much of the wise-guy vernacular. Hearing the Mafia
phrase “cosa nostra,” meaning “our thing,” agents
concluded that this “new” criminal organization
they had uncovered was called “La Cosa Nostra,”
hence another chapter in the Mafia legend.

When authorities rounded up the underworld
leaders, they discovered that 19 were from upstate
New York, 23 from New York City, three from
the mountain West, two from the South, eight
from the Midwest, two from Cuba, and one from
Italy. These demographics were used by the media
to bring pressure on Hoover to admit the existence
of a national organized crime syndicate. In the pro-
cess, not only was Hoover embarrassed, but the
revelations also had a damaging effect on the
FBI’s image and reputation for professionalism.
While Hoover would only privately concede
the existence of an organized crime syndicate, pub-
licly he established the Top Hoodlum program, an
initiative against organized crime by which each
FBI field office was required to identify 10 major
mob members in its geographic area and then
closely watch their activities.
Explanations for Hoover’s reluctance to go after organ-
ized crime have run the gamut from mob blackmail over
his rumored sexual preferences to his fondness for horse
racing and an unwritten agreement that protected him
from paying his losses. However, these rumors have never
been substantiated and are highly unlikely. One more
convincing explanation was proposed by one of his bio-
graphers, who suggested that if Hoover had admitted
that organized crime was a national problem, he might
have to concede some of his powers to others since it
would require a multi–task force strategy using other law
enforcement agencies to counter such a widespread
crime problem. Still others would argue that Hoover sus-
pected his agency would never defeat well-entrenched
crime syndicates and that agents might possibly be com-
promised by bribes.
Capital Punishment
American executions substantially decreased be-
tween the late 1940s and early 1950s. In fact, the
number of capital crimes had been steadily reduced
since the eighteenth century. By the beginning of
the 1950s, there were capital crimes for which no
one had been executed in years, including kidnap-
ping, treason, and bombing. Since the 1930s, the
only capital crime that had regularly received the
death penalty was murder. Although public opinion
continued to support the death penalty, fewer ex-
ecutions were taking place. Between 1950 and
1954, an average of 83 executions were conducted,
compared to 155 per year between 1930 and
1934.13
A watershed of sorts for the study of American
executions was the commencement of collecting
and publishing national statistics. Before the 1930s,
most figures concerning execution were unofficial,
but beginning in 1930, the Bureau of the Census
began including execution as one of the causes of
death in the Vital Statistics of the United States.
National execution statistics were disseminated
to a wider audience beginning in 1950, thanks to
the inclusion of these figures in the Federal Bureau
of Prisons’ National Prisoner Statistics Series. A survey
of the execution data “unequivocally documented
the fact that for the preceding twenty years, the
black man had been the principal victim of the
death penalty in America, and almost the exclusive
victim of executions for rape.”14 Further research
demonstrated that blacks on death row were less
likely to receive commutations than their white
counterparts.
In the postwar years, several Supreme Court
decisions addressed the unequal application of the
death penalty. In 1947, an African American man
named Eddie Patton was sentenced to death by an
all-white jury for killing a white man. Citing the
exclusion of blacks from the juries that indicted him
and then convicted him, Patton argued that he had
been denied equal protection under the law as
guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Patton
claimed that it had been a long-established tradition
in his county to exclude blacks from jury lists, jury
boxes, and jury service. In the 1947 decision Patton v.
Mississippi, the Supreme Court reversed the decision
of the state court. By ordering a new trial, the Court
established a new precedent for the prohibition of
racial discrimination in jury selection.
Among the capital cases that led many to begin ques-
tioning the wisdom of the death penalty was the case of
Caryl Chessman (1921–1960), California’s infamous “Red
Light Bandit.” By the time he was 16, Chessman,
a veteran of California’s juvenile criminal system, had

learned how to expertly manipulate the legal system.
Beginning in early 1948, however, he made the transition
from committing petty crimes to capital ones. He was
suspected of using a flashing red light to stop cars by
creating the impression that he was somehow connected
to law enforcement. He robbed several victims at gun-
point in two cases and in a third incident ordered a
woman to undress and perform oral sex on him. Two
more robberies followed, including one in which he
forced a woman into his car and attempted to rape her.
It was not long before Chessman was arrested on
suspicion of armed robbery. When police found tools that
seemed to connect him with the Red Light Bandit case,
he was arraigned on 18 charges. In the subsequent trial,
Chessman was convicted of kidnapping (for moving a
woman from her car into his) and committing “unnatural
sexual acts.” Sentenced to death for violating the so-
called Little Lindbergh Law by kidnapping with intent to
commit robbery, the Chessman case was the harshest
sentence handed down in California to a criminal who
had not actually killed anyone. Between 1948 and 1960,
his execution was repeatedly postponed as it went
through the appellate process. During those 12 years, he
became a well-known, articulate opponent of the death
penalty. He wrote three books, including Cell 2455, Death
Row, selling hundreds of thousands of copies. But after
eight stays of execution, he was finally sent to the gas
chamber on May 2, 1960.
Like many controversial American executions, this
one resonated throughout the world, leading to demon-
strations and attacks on U.S. embassies in Europe and
South America. Governor Edmund “Pat” Brown of
California, who had been widely criticized for his vacilla-
tion over the fate of Chessman, would later write that he
believed he “should have found a way to spare Chess-
man’s life.”15 Over the next few years, unfavorable public
opinion would lead to an informal moratorium on the
death penalty beginning in 1965.
The 1950s and 1960s saw the NAACP and the
American Civil Liberties Union come to the aid of a
number of individuals sentenced to death, leading to the
reversal of several convictions. During the 1960s, five
states abolished the death penalty, and still more dem-
onstrated reluctance to schedule and perform executions.
Judges and juries also became increasingly disinclined to
impose death sentences.
Sensational Crimes
There were a number of high-profile crimes that
accented the war years. None was stranger than
that of the teenage killer and burglar William
Heirens. An alarming case that presaged the sex
criminals and serial killers of the modern era,
Heirens was arrested for burglary in 1946. A subse-
quent fingerprint check connected him to a num-
ber of unsolved crimes, including the murders of
two women and of a 6-year-old child who had
been dismembered. Heirens was then questioned
under the influence of the highly promoted truth
serum sodium pentothal. Originally used to treat
shell-shock victims during the war, its use in the
Heirens case was its first in a criminal case. Despite
warnings from a director of a psychiatric institute
that the drug was not reliable and that any revela-
tions uncovered could not be used in court, the
state’s attorney went ahead with the procedure.
Under the influence of the drug, Heirens re-
vealed the existence of what proved an imaginary
companion whom he blamed for the murders. The
American Civil Liberties Union soon protested the
use of sodium pentothal, citing it as a violation of
the defendant’s civil rights. In later years, Heirens
claimed to have been taking the drug for months
prior to the questioning so that he could manipu-
late his inquisitors. The 17-year-old Heirens even-
tually reached a plea agreement and confessed to
three murders. In one of the murders, Heirens
wrote with lipstick on a living room wall, “For
Heaven’s sake catch me before I kill more. I cannot
control myself,” probably one of the most memo-
rable quotes in the annals of American homicide.
Despite the potential of sodium pentothal as a truth
serum, the business of lie detecting would remain
the bailiwick of the polygraph machine, pioneered
by the Berkeley Police Department years earlier.
Juvenile Delinquency
In the 1950s, America was confronted with a new
wave of hysteria: rising juvenile delinquency. Dur-
ing hearings on the problem chaired by Estes
Kefauver, a now-familiar refrain was heard: “blame
it on the mass media.” However, one needs to go
back only to the 1920s and 1930s to discover similar
concerns about the impact of mass culture on
America’s youth. Historian James Gilbert suggests
that “the 1950s’ dispute over mass culture was pro-
tracted and perhaps more universal and intense than
266

at earlier periods.”16 Gilbert explained that while
the 1950s was a decade of “declining civil liberties,”
it was also an era of “remarkable liberalization,”
citing the civil rights movement and class mobility
stimulated by the GI Bill, which offered educational
opportunities to more people.
As America reaped the economic benefits of
the postwar boom, the mass-media industry en-
joyed greater independence from censorship and
control. As juvenile delinquency rose, so did the
furor over violent comic books, rock-and-roll
music, clothing styles, and hot-rodders. However,
what escaped many of the era’s critics was that de-
linquency had been on the rise since 1940. Crimi-
nal justice authorities cited a variety of explanations,
including broken families, mothers away from
home working for the war effort in factories, and
family mobility, all of which were slowly creating a
nation of strangers.
In 1949, following in the discredited steps of
Lombroso, who had concluded that one could
recognize “born criminals” by studying body mea-
surements and physical traits, William Sheldon
collected the physical measurements of 200 boys
at a Boston reform school. Whereas Lombroso argued
for atavism—that born criminals were biologi-
cal throwbacks to an earlier stage of evolution—
Sheldon determined that basic body structures
were linked to delinquency. He found that the
more athletic and aggressive mesomorphs were
more inclined to delinquency over the more le-
thargic endomorphs and taller and intellectually
inclined ectomorphs. However, unlike Lombroso,
Sheldon argued that mesomorphy did not result in
delinquency but rather predisposed delinquents to
delinquency.
In subsequent years, Sheldon’s findings came
under increasing scrutiny and have been roundly
criticized for lacking empirical rigor. In 1956,
Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck tested Sheldon’s hy-
pothesis by comparing 500 identified delinquents
with 500 nondelinquents in a controlled experi-
ment. What they found was that body type in
itself did not incline individuals to delinquent be-
havior but was one of many factors that led to
delinquency.
Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck were two Harvard-based
criminologists who collaborated on a number of works
investigating issues ranging from juvenile delinquency
and recidivism to criminality and rehabilitation. In one of
their best-known publications, Predicting Delinquency
and Crime, published in 1959, the Gluecks developed a
“social prediction table” that was designed to gauge
criminal potential in young children. Although this was
considered innovative in its time, many criminologists
have questioned the validity of the Gluecks’s findings,
citing their failure to examine the role of ethnicity since
their study included many Italian immigrants.
AMERIC AN VIOLENCE
The nation’s prospects for peace and order following
World War II stood out in sharp contrast to the
denouement of World War I, which was followed
by racial and economic turmoil. Thanks in part to a
long duration of full industrial employment in the
war years, the late 1940s and 1950s saw homicide
rates plummet to an all-time low of less than five
per 100,000. According to historian Roger Lane, a
new pattern of homicide emerged in which murders
were “domesticated,” explaining that “compared to
earlier eras, proportionately more of them [murders]
involved fights with family, friends, and acquain-
tances, rather than strangers or robbers.”17
As Lane and others have demonstrated, Amer-
ica’s urban homicide rate declined in the 1940s and
1950s. A pioneering study by criminologist Marvin
Wolfgang, Patterns of Criminal Homicide (1957), an-
alyzed homicides in Philadelphia between 1948 and
1952. His findings are considered the era’s most
accurate academic study of homicide and demon-
strate the long-term impact of the “ongoing urban
industrial revolution.”18
However, while homicide rates had declined,
racial tensions and violence persisted throughout
the country. The war years saw an African Ameri-
can migration to cities in the Northeast (New York
and Philadelphia), the Midwest (Chicago and
Detroit), and the West (Los Angeles and Portland),
particularly as bars to black employment were lifted
in industrial centers. While most tensions were held
in check by the ongoing war and patriotic fervor on

the home front, the end of the war brought linger-
ing animosities to the surface.
An unforeseen result of the war years was the
labor shortage that imperiled America’s war indus-
tries as the country slowly rebounded from the
Great Depression. Both Puerto Rican and Mexican
immigration flourished. Most Puerto Ricans ended
up in the New York City area, while Mexicans
recruited for agricultural labor settled in the South-
west. Although racial tensions were exacerbated by
these migrations, with the most serious riots break-
ing out in Detroit in 1942 and 1943, it was not
until the end of the war that a wave of violence
engulfed cities in every region of the country.
An examination of the 1943 Detroit riot offers
an excellent microcosm from which to view similar
race riots in the 1940s. While the armed forces were
still segregated as America went to war, steps were
taken against segregation and discrimination on other
fronts. In one campaign, black organizations pro-
moted the “double V” as a symbol for victory at
home and overseas. Blacks had traditionally been
barred from the automobile unions, and the UAW-
CIO sought to remedy the situation at Ford plants in
1941. Subsequently, the strike succeeded, and they
were accepted into the union by the thousands.
Whites, however, felt threatened by such ad-
vances. Egged on by right-wing demagogues such
as Father Charles Coughlin and the almost-fascist
Black Legion, a violent campaign of terror was initi-
ated against Detroit’s black population, culminating
in a June riot. According to one study by Dominic
Capeci, white rioters in Detroit were often young,
single, and employed men who went to great
lengths to reach the riot, where they could confront
black rioters, who were typically “older, married,
and employed” but had a stake in a community
that seemed to unfairly deny them advancement in
the building trades.19 Fueled by racism and rumor,
Detroit’s blacks fought back against white agitators,
looting and burning stores. Whites responded with
iron pipes, knives, and clubs. Police gunfire raked
the rioters as well. When the riot finally ended, 34
people were dead, including 25 blacks.
In Birmingham, Alabama, a city that was 43%
black, several homes were dynamited in 1949 as the
resurgent southern Klan returned to threatening
black citizens. Far from an isolated incident, be-
tween 1950 and 1951 racially motivated bombings
were reported in Nashville, Miami, Dallas, and
other cities. As segregation came under attack
throughout the 1950s, individual instances of
bombings, arson, and violence were directed at
black communities from California to Florida.
The Brown v. Board of Education decision led to
racial violence in most southern states. With little
opposition from state law enforcement, more than
500 reprisals against African Americans were re-
ported between 1955 and 1958. As the leader of
the school integration movement, the NAACP
was often targeted by segregationists. In an attempt
to block the integrationists, Virginia passed sedi-
tion laws, South Carolina barred public employ-
ment
of
NAACP
members,
and
Texas and
Alabama initiated injunctions against association
branches.
The notorious murder of 15-year-old Emmett Till further
reinforced black fears of racially motivated violence in
the South. In August 1955, Till, who was raised in
Chicago, was spending a summer vacation with relatives
in rural Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, when he
mistakenly broke the conventions of southern etiquette.
Unfamiliar with a culture that expected black men to
answer whites with “yes, sir” or “no, sir,” Till responded
in several confrontations with the less conventional
“yeah” and “naw.” Compounding his “flaunting” of
southern racial etiquette, Till kept a photograph of his
white girlfriend back home in his wallet. Till sealed his
fate when, on a dare by local friends, he whistled at a
young, married white woman and even went so far as ask
her for a date. It was not long before he disappeared,
and Till’s badly decomposed body was soon found in the
Tallahatchie River. Suspicion focused on the white wo-
man’s husband and another man, who were identified as
having visited the cabin where Till had been staying to
inquire about his whereabouts. Both men were arrested
and indicted for the murder. After a trial in front of an
all-white jury (despite blacks making up 63% of county
residents) who deliberated for little more than one hour,
both defendants were acquitted. According to one of the
jurors, “If we hadn’t stopped to drink pop, it wouldn’t
have taken that long.”20 Despite an international uproar,
the case had little impact on race relations and the
criminal justice system in the South.21

The Zoot-Suit Riot
The racial tensions that exploded in Los Angeles in
the 1940s “were a precursor of the searing racial
turbulence that would mark America’s cities in the
decades to follow.”22 During the war years, Los
Angeles was teeming with young men—black,
Mexican American, and white. In the racially
charged atmosphere of the period, there was little
interference from the Los Angeles Police Depart-
ment (LAPD) if whites sometimes lashed out at
defiant African Americans seeking jobs in wartime
industries or stylish Mexican “zoot-suiters” (the
term referred to the gaudy clothing preferred by
some Mexican youths) flaunting their individuality.
By 1943, the racial demographics of Los Angeles
were clearly changing. In 1940, its African American
population stood at 62,000. However, more than
200,000 blacks would arrive in the city in the mid-
1940s to fill the demand for workers in the aviation,
shipbuilding, and other wartime industries.
Although the LAPD employed black officers as
early as the nineteenth century, segregation became
the hallmark of the early LAPD. Black and white
officers were forbidden to work together. If blacks
were promoted, it was only to the plainclothes di-
vision. There was an unspoken rule against blacks
wearing stripes, which would allow them to super-
vise white officers. With the introduction of the
police car in the 1920s and 1930s, black officers
were consigned to the midnight shift (apparently
so that whites would not see them in a patrol car)
and were still segregated and restricted to black
neighborhoods. Reflecting the rampant discrimina-
tion of the era, similar conditions existed for Mexi-
can Americans on the force, with little opportunity
for advancement, except as detectives, in which
case bilingualism was necessary.
In the same summer that witnessed the Detroit
race riot, tension resulting from the assault of several
sailors by a group of Mexican youths resulted in
violence between Mexicans and whites on the
streets of Los Angeles. Between June 3 and June 13,
1943, mobs attacked Mexican and black youths in
Los Angeles. Those attired in zoot-suit garb were
most often singled out. On June 7 alone, over
1,000 soldiers, sailors, and civilians dragged mostly
Mexican youths from movie theaters, streetcars,
and homes and into the streets, where they were
summarily stripped and beaten. Police stood by,
either helpless or reluctant to intervene. What
was probably most remarkable about this riot was
that no one was killed or seriously injured, and
there was little property damage.
Following the Zoot-Suit Riot, Governor and
future Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren ordered
an investigation into its causes. The resulting
Citizen’s Committee Report was a classic in under-
statement, concluding that racial prejudice was a
factor in the outbreak. Demonstrating the long-
standing animosity between Mexicans and Anglos
in southern California, the Hearst papers head-
lined every episode that reflected negatively on
Mexicans. Despite attempts by the Office of War
Information to end this practice, following the riot
one Los Angeles County supervisor proclaimed to
the media that “all that is needed to end lawlessness
is more of the same action as is being exercised by
the servicemen.”23
After the June riots, the Los Angeles City
Council made wearing zoot-suit attire a misde-
meanor, foreshadowing the uproar over gang para-
phernalia in schools today. According to James
Gilbert, the Zoot-Suit Riot also “pushed delin-
quency to the forefront of national concern.”24
NOTABLE TRIALS
The Trial of Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg (1951)
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested in 1950 for
what J. Edgar Hoover labeled the “crime of the cen-
tury”: allegedly passing the secret of the atomic
bomb to the Soviets five years earlier, only three
months before America dropped the atomic bomb
on Hiroshima. The Rosenbergs were taken into
custody after a Russian espionage ring in the United
States began to unravel. Along with associate
Morton Sobell, the three were charged and tried in
CRIMINA L JUSTICE A T MID CEN TU RY (1941– 1959)
269

1951 for “conspiracy to commit espionage.” What
makes this case stand out is that while it was probably
the most publicized capital case of its era, it con-
cerned espionage rather than homicide.
The Rosenbergs pleaded innocence at their
trial and took the Fifth Amendment when queried
as to whether they were communists. Their trial
was conducted in a climate of fear and conspiracy
while American forces were in the midst of
the Korean conflict. Following the trial, the
Rosenbergs were found guilty and sentenced to
death, and Sobell was sentenced to 30 years in
prison. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg spent the next
two years at New York’s Sing Sing Prison as their
lawyer filed numerous appeals on their behalf.
Despite international pressure to spare the parents
of two children and the persistent claims of inno-
cence by the Rosenbergs, both went to the electric
chair in June 1953.
Harking back to when treason was always
treated as the worst secular offense, the Rosenbergs
were the first and last Americans executed for treason
against the United States. (John Brown had been
executed for treason against the State of Virginia.)
What is most noteworthy about the case, which
was the endgame of a complicated series of Cold
War spy cases, was that the Rosenbergs had not
given information to an enemy during wartime but
rather to America’s wartime ally, an act that techni-
cally would not be considered an act of treason.
Gripped in the postwar anticommunist hysteria of
the McCarthy era, America no longer held a mo-
nopoly on the atomic bomb. Prosecutors and the
public alike were eager to find a scapegoat. The tes-
timony of fellow spies Harry Gold and Ethel Rosen-
berg’s brother David Greenglass, both of whom
cooperated with the authorities, made a compelling
case for their guilt. In 1995, decoded wartime cables
from the Soviet consulate in New York to the KGB
in Moscow were made public, revealing the com-
plicity of Julius Rosenberg beyond a reasonable
doubt (but there was little evidence against Ethel).
None of these intercepts were made public in the
1951 trial because the United States did not want the
Soviets to know that their “unbreakable code” had
been broken.
CONCLUSI ONS
The Cold War and “Hot War” tensions of the
1940s and 1950s transformed criminal justice insti-
tutions, but many American tensions remained un-
changed. The 1955 murders of Emmett Till and
Reverend George Lee25 demonstrated that white
murderers who killed blacks in southern white
communities had little to fear from the criminal
justice system.
In the climate of the postwar era, security at
home and abroad dominated American concerns.
Many civil libertarians were alarmed by the govern-
ment’s attempt to protect national security at the
expense of certain constitutional liberties. For the
first time since the Alien and Sedition Acts of
1798, people were imprisoned for peacetime sedi-
tion, beginning with the Smith Act of 1940. By
the late 1940s, leaders of the American Communist
Party were prosecuted because of the postwar stand-
off with the Soviet Union. The Cold War concern
for national security would give rise to another series
of witch hunts against dissenters, this time finding
expression in the House Un-American Activities
Committee hearings and the McCarthy hearings.
While the trial of the Rosenbergs and Caryl
Chessman garnered domestic headlines, trials in
Nuremberg and Tokyo unveiled an underworld of
criminal excess unsurpassed in criminal justice his-
tory. More than 12 million Jews, Gypsies, Russians,
and homosexuals were murdered in the Nazi holo-
caust. Millions more perished in Russia during
Stalin’s reign. Forty percent of Americans held by
the Japanese perished in death marches and from
disease. Sixty percent of Soviet prisoners held by
the Germans died in captivity.
As America’s crime rates declined into the
1950s, so too did the nation begin to abandon cap-
ital punishment. According to death penalty au-
thority William J. Bowers, the decline initially
coincided with the decline in the homicide rate,
but by 1950 “there were definite indications that
the
nation
was
becoming
more
reluctant
to
execute.”26 As the 1960s approached, research by
the social scientist Thorsten Sellin (1896–1982) sug-
gested that capital punishment was not an effective
270

deterrent and that it had little impact on homicide
rates.
The impact of the 1940s and 1950s on Ameri-
cans varied from group to group. The war had a
great impact on population demographics, as peo-
ple flocked from the countryside to the cities. New
opportunities opened for women and minorities,
yet sexual and racial barriers persisted. With the
birth of the civil rights movement in the late
1950s, remnants of the Ku Klux Klan that had re-
mained active in the South through the war years
returned with a fury in the early 1960s.
Point–Counterpoint
Separate but Equal? (Mississippi 1948–1954)
By the 1890s, Jim Crow laws had spread through the
South, leading some African Americans to turn to the courts
to defend the rights they felt had been granted them under the
Fourteenth Amendment. In Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) the
Court ruled that “separate but equal” accommodations did
not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Midway through the
next century not much had changed, with most southern
states enforcing the separation of blacks and whites at schools,
train stations, and even having separate schools for blind
children of both races. In 1948 Southern whites launched a
third-party presidential campaign with a platform based on
segregation. The first reading is an excerpt from Brown v.
Board of Education of Topeka (1954). The struggle
against segregation still had a long way to go. The second is a
set of passages from Mississippi’s legal code in the late 1940s.
In 1954 Plessy was overturned when the Supreme Court
concluded that “separate educational facilities are inherently
unequal.”
In the first cases in this Court construing the Four-
teenth Amendment, decided shortly after its adop-
tion, the Court interpreted it as proscribing all
state-imposed discriminations against the Negro race.
The doctrine of “separate but equal” did not make its
appearance in this Court until 1896 in the case of
Plessy v. Ferguson … involving not education but
transportation. American courts have since labored
with the doctrine for over half a century. In this
Court, there have been six cases involving the
“separate but equal” doctrine in the field of pub-
lic education.… In more recent cases, all on the
graduate school level, inequality was found in that
specific benefits enjoyed by white students were
denied to Negro students of the same educational
qualifications.… In none of these cases was it nec-
essary to re-examine the doctrine to grant relief to
the Negro plaintiff.…
In the instant cases, the question is directly pre-
sented. Here … there are findings below that the
Negro and white schools involved have been
equalized, or are being equalized, with respect to
buildings, curricula, qualifications and salaries of
teachers.… Our decision, therefore, cannot turn
on merely the comparison of these tangible factors
in the Negro and white schools involved in each of
the cases. We must look instead to the effect of
segregation itself on public education.
In approaching this problem, we cannot turn
the clock back to 1868 when the Amendment was
adopted, or even to 1896 when Plessy v. Ferguson
was written. We must consider public education in
the light of its full development and its present place
in American life throughout the Nation. Only in
this way can it be determined if segregation in pub-
lic schools deprives these plaintiffs of the equal pro-
tection of the laws.
Today, education is perhaps the most important
function of state and local governments. Compulsory
school attendance laws and the great expenditures
for education both demonstrate our recognition of
the importance of education to our democratic soci-
ety. It is required in the performance of our most
basic public responsibilities, even service in the
armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citi-
zenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awak-
ening the child to cultural values, in preparing him
for later professional training, and in helping him to
adjust normally to his environment.…
We come then to the question presented: Does
segregation of children in public schools solely on
the basis of race, even though the physical facilities
and other “tangible” factors may be equal, deprive

the children of the minority group of equal educa-
tional opportunities? We believe that it does.…
To separate them from others of similar age
and qualifications solely because of their race gen-
erates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the
community that may affect their hearts and minds
in a way unlikely ever to be undone. The effect of
this separation on their educational opportunities
was well stated by a finding in the Kansas case by
a court which nevertheless felt compelled to rule
against the Negro plaintiffs:
“Segregation of white and colored children in
public schools has a detrimental effect upon the
colored children. The impact is greater when it
has the sanction of the law; for the policy of sepa-
rating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the
inferiority of the Negro group. A sense of inferior-
ity affects the motivation of a child to learn. Segre-
gation with the sanction of law, therefore, has a
tendency to retard the education and mental devel-
opment of Negro children and to deprive them of
some of the benefits they would receive in a racially
integrated school system.” Whatever may have been
the extent of psychological knowledge at the time of
Plessy v. Ferguson, this finding is amply supported by
modern authority. Any language in Plessy v. Ferguson
contrary to this finding is rejected.
We conclude that in the field of public edu-
cation the doctrine of “separate but equal” has no
place. Separate educational facilities are inherently
unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs
and others similarly situated for whom the actions
have been brought are, by reason of the segrega-
tion complained of, deprived of the equal protec-
tion of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth
Amendment.…

mon carriers by motor vehicle.—All persons or
corporations operating street railways and street or
municipal buses, carrying passengers in this state,
and every common carrier by motor vehicle of pas-
sengers in this state as defined by section 3 (e) of
Chapter 142 of the laws of 1938 [§7634, Code of
1942] shall provide equal, but separate, accommo-
dations for the white and colored races.
Every common carrier by motor vehicle of
passengers in this state, as defined by section 3 (e)
of Chapter 142 of the laws of 1938 [§7634, Code of
1942], by buses or street cars operated entirely
within the corporate limits of a municipality, or
within a radius of 5 miles thereof, shall divide its

suitably provide for, a separation of the races, and all
other buses and motor vehicles carrying passengers
for hire in the state of Mississippi shall use a latticed
movable partition extending from the top of the
seat to the ceiling of the vehicle, said partition not
to obstruct the view of the driver of the vehicle to
secure such separate accommodations; provided,
however, that this act shall not apply to buses oper-
ated exclusively for the carrying of military person-
nel, and the operators of such passenger buses shall
have power, and are required, to assign each pas-
senger to the compartment of the bus used for the
race to which such passenger belongs; and in no
case shall any passenger be permitted to stand in
the aisle of the compartment in which he does
not belong and is not so assigned; and should any
passenger refuse to occupy the compartment to
which he or she belongs and is assigned, the opera-
tor shall have power to refuse to carry such passen-
ger on the bus; or should either compartment
become so loaded in transit as not to permit the
taking on of any further passengers for that com-
partment, then the bus operator shall not be re-
quired and shall refuse to take on any further
passengers in violation of this act. Even though
such additional passengers may have purchased
and may hold tickets for transportation on the said
bus, the only remedy said passengers shall have for
failure or refusal to carry them under such circum-
stances is the right to a refund of the cost of his
ticket, and for said refusal in either case neither
the operator nor the common carrier shall be liable
for damages in any court. Such partition may be
made movable so as to allow adjustment of the
space in the bus to suit the requirements of traffic.

CRITI CAL THINKING QUESTIONS
1. Discuss the postwar impact of World War II on
the American criminal justice system.
2. What impact did the McCarthy “witch hunts”
have on civil liberties?
3. How did the growth of the civil rights move-
ment impact criminal justice institutions and
the legal system?
4. How did police reformers William H. Parker
and Orlando W. Wilson personify police pro-
fessionalism? What innovations can be attrib-
uted to them? What did their critics think?
5. How did the war years affect the mandate and
role of law enforcement? The corrections
system?
6. What were some of the explanations for prison
violence in this era?
7. What was the impact of the Apalachin Con-
ference on American perceptions of organized
crime?
8. Discuss race relations, riots, and the criminal
justice system in the war years.
9. What lessons does the Zoot-Suit Riot offer the
student of justice in America?
10. Why were the Rosenbergs executed? Should
they have been? Why are similar crimes not
punished the same way today?

In 1960, the national murder rate stood at 4.7 per
100,000, the lowest for any census year. As America
made the transition from the 1950s to the decade of
President John F. Kennedy’s “New Frontier,” the
crime rate was so low that sociologist Daniel Bell
commented that “there is probably less crime today
in the United States than existed a hundred, or fifty,
or even twenty-five years ago.”1 He had reasons for
such optimism, as America enjoyed a decrease in
murder from 6.9 per 100,000 in 1946 to 4.5 per
100,000 by 1962.2 Other crimes fell as well.
But the assassination of John F. Kennedy in
1963 and America’s participation in the Vietnam
War would touch off a decade of national turmoil
that did not diminish until well into the 1970s. One
of the most tumultuous eras in American history, the
1960s and 1970s were marked by civil rights and war
protests, boycotts and sit-ins, race rioting, and do-
mestic terrorism. Criminal justice historian Samuel
Walker has described this period as “the most turbu-
lent in all of American criminal justice history.”3
The criminal justice system was challenged on
many fronts in this era. In an attempt to understand
rising crime rates and to create strategies for sup-
pressing crime in the 1960s, the federal govern-
ment launched a variety of official inquiries.
Among the most significant was the 1965 Presi-
dent’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Ad-
ministration of Justice (LEAA), which concluded
that police officers had become increasingly iso-
lated from the communities they served. Its report,
The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society, published
in 1967, found that city officials had given police
chiefs too much latitude in running their depart-
ments. In an era of rising concerns over the role of
police in contemporary society, the extensive re-
port made more than 200 recommendations con-
cerning criminal justice reform, including raising
educational requirements and improving training
programs for police officers.4 A number of other
crime commissions were created to study a crimi-
nal justice system in crisis during the 1970s, most
focusing on the changing nature of policing. Many
of these investigations were not limited to polic-
ing, focusing attention on organized crime, cor-
rections, drug abuse, and juvenile delinquency.

Politicians saw the potential of using the civil
disorder to their advantage. Senator Barry Gold-
water in 1964 and presidential candidate Richard
Nixon in 1968 began to link street crime to the civil
disobedience that accompanied the civil rights
movement. In the process, law and order emerged
as an important campaign issue that found an audi-
ence with conservative and mostly white Americans.
THE LAWGIVER S
The social unrest of the 1960s prodded the federal
government to establish a number of inquiries into
the causes and prevention of crime. In 1968, Con-
gress passed the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe
Streets Act, creating the Law Enforcement Assistance
Administration (LEAA) as its centerpiece in a “na-
tional war on crime.” By design, the LEAA was sup-
posed to support state and local crime-control efforts
by carrying out a broad program of aid to state and
local authorities for crime control, targeting street
crime, riots, and organized crime. Starting with $60
million in seed money in 1968, by 1982 the agency
had spent more than $7 billion on updating law en-
forcement departments around the country.5
The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act impacted the criminal justice system in a num-
ber of ways. Building on Katz v. United States, the
1967 Supreme Court decision that limited the use
of electronic eavesdropping because of concerns
about invasions of privacy, the Omnibus Crime
Control Act in 1968 prohibited lawful interceptions
except by warrant or with consent. Other features
of the crime control legislation focused on the reg-
ulation of firearms sales, the establishment of the
Bureau of Justice Statistics, and the awarding of
grants for the construction and renovation of court-
rooms, correctional facilities, treatment centers, and
other criminal justice–related structures.
In 1967, the Supreme Court applied the Fourth Amend-
ment to police wiretapping, maintaining that evidence
collected by listening to private conversations by a de-
fendant using a public telephone booth violated the
constitutional protection of personal privacy. The
following year under the Omnibus Crime Control and
Safe Streets Act, Congress authorized certain forms of
electronic surveillance as long as officers had obtained a
lawful court order first. Over the ensuing years, a number
of states implemented electronic eavesdropping laws
inspired by the federal act.
No region in the nation’s criminal justice sys-
tem was transformed more than the southern states.
The onset of the civil rights movement of the 1950s
and 1960s has sometimes been referred to as a “Sec-
ond Reconstruction,” particularly in the South.6
Beginning with the civil rights laws of 1957 and
subsequent legislation, such as the Voting Rights
Act of 1964, millions of black voters regained the
franchise after several generations of racial confron-
tation over the ballot box.
The South proved one of the most challenging
fronts for law enforcement during this period as white
segregationists brutally attacked nonviolent civil rights
protesters, while police officers targeted peaceful black
marchers with high-pressure hoses and attack dogs.
The early 1960s witnessed a number of well-
publicized murder cases in the South, including the
murder of Medgar Evers, organizer of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP) and the bombing deaths of four young
black girls in a Birmingham, Alabama, church.
To win southern congressional support, Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy did little to placate civil
rights activists in his first two years in office. Influ-
enced by daily television coverage demonstrating
the repugnant brutality in the South and partly at
the behest of his brother, Attorney General Robert
F. Kennedy, in 1963 Kennedy changed his position
on civil rights. During the Kennedy administration
of the early 1960s, Attorney General Kennedy pur-
sued an aggressive agenda of crime control, shifting
the federal government’s attention to civil rights
and suppressing organized crime. Publicly pro-
claiming that the time for “the nation to fulfill its
promise” had arrived, President Kennedy did not
live to fulfill his pledge, gunned down by an assas-
sin’s bullet in November 1963.
Lyndon Johnson’s ascendance to the presidency
in 1963 coincided with some of the most significant

civil rights legislation since the post–Civil War pe-
riod. Events in Birmingham, Alabama, roused the
national conscience and stimulated a formerly re-
luctant administration into becoming a stalwart sup-
porter of potent civil rights legislation. Intended to
protect the right to equality in public accommoda-
tions, the right to have federal funds spent in a
nondiscriminatory manner, and the right to racial
and sexual equality in employment, the passage of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act enacted the strongest
civil rights measures since the Reconstruction era.
Considered the most far-reaching statute enacted
by Congress, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 pro-
vided for the replacement of state election machin-
ery by federal law and ad hoc federal officials when
it was found necessary to eliminate a pattern of
Fifteenth Amendment violations of voting rights.
For many other Americans, the 1964 civil
rights legislation had little if any impact. Genera-
tions of government neglect had left the country’s
Native American population demoralized with at-
tendant high rates of disease and infant mortality
rates, unemployment, illiteracy, malnutrition, and
alcoholism. In response to these conditions and
the continued plight of the first Americans, Native
American activists Dennis Banks and Clyde Belle-
court organized the American Indian Movement
(AIM) in 1968. Although they championed earlier
reform efforts, their goals and tactics were guided
by a more militant approach than past efforts. Bor-
rowing a page from the black militants of the era,
they used guns in their takeovers and effected a
sinister image to threaten those who opposed
them. AIM members used these new tactics to oc-
cupy the abandoned prison island of Alcatraz in
1969 and take over the main offices of the Indian
Bureau in Washington, DC, in 1972. Their most
significant protest took place at Wounded Knee,
South Dakota, in 1973, where several hundred
Sioux had been massacred by the army in 1890.
During the subsequent 71-day protest, AIM
leaders held firm to their demands for the restora-
tion of treaty lands. Several gunfights ensued be-
tween
Indians
and
FBI
agents
and
National
Guardsmen, leaving two dead. While 300 protesters
were eventually arrested, most were acquitted on
legal technicalities. Throughout the 1970s, Native
Americans across the nation launched lawsuits to
recover their treaty lands and rights.
The Supreme Court
In the 1960s, the Supreme Court played a crucial role
in promoting a climate of political liberalism during
the Kennedy and Johnson presidencies. Beginning
with the Brown v. Board of Education decision in
1954, the Court demonstrated remarkable courage
in erasing the distinctions that had supported a racially
segregated society and, through a series of decisions,
diminished Jim Crowism. While discrimination and
poverty persisted in black communities, so too did the
goals for equality set forth by the chief justices. In
their crusade for equal rights, African Americans be-
came increasingly politicized during the 1960s.
Sweeping decisions on the electoral process,
political representation, school desegregation, pub-
lic support of religion, obscenity, and free speech
were accompanied by widespread debate and vit-
riol.
But
according
to
legal
historian
David
Bodenhamer, “No judicial reforms were as bold
or ignited more protest as the landmark cases in-
volving criminal process.”7 Diverging from preced-
ing courts, the Warren Court applied the federal
procedural guarantees of the Bill of Rights to the
application of state criminal justice. In the process of
“nationalizing” the Bill of Rights, the Supreme
Court reshaped the nature of federalism by applying
the same standards to both state and federal criminal
proceedings. The high court rejected the applica-
tion of the entire Bill of Rights, rather emphasizing
those amendments that apply to “due process” as
defined by the Fourteenth Amendment.
The 1960s and 1970s provided a stage for some
of the Supreme Court’s most important decisions,
leading some commentators to suggest that the
Court “made more changes in criminal procedure”
during this period “than had been made by the
Court in the previous 175 years of its existence.”8
In 1961, the Supreme Court greatly increased
the ability of criminal defendants to defend them-
selves in the landmark case of Mapp v. Ohio by ruling
that

unreasonable searches must be excluded from trial.
This decision was shortly followed by the Escobedo v.
Illinois (1964) and the Miranda v. Arizona (1966) de-
cisions by the Warren Court, both of which are
credited with significantly changing the way law en-
forcement officers carried out interrogations and at
the same time guaranteed the rights of the accused.
In the Mapp case, Cleveland police officers ar-
rived at the home of Ms. Dollree Mapp to search
for a suspect in a recent bombing case. After forcing
their way into the residence, the officers searched
the house without a warrant and found obscene
material unrelated to their initial search. Mapp
was subsequently convicted for possessing the ob-
scene materials. Building an appeal based on the
1914 Weeks decision, which held that the Four-
teenth Amendment barred the use of evidence se-
cured through an illegal search and seizure, Mapp’s
conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court
in 1961. In the process, the exclusionary rule was
extended to the states.
Two years before Miranda, Daniel Escobedo
was
arrested
for
killing
his
brother-in-law
in
Chicago. After two rounds of intense police interro-
gation, Escobedo confessed and was then convicted
in court. According to the narrow five-to-four
Supreme Court decision, without an attorney present
during his police interrogation, it was ruled that his
confession had been illegally obtained under the
Sixth Amendment, which guarantees the right to
legal counsel during police questioning.
The landmark Miranda decision stemmed from
the arrest of Ernest Miranda (1940–1976) for rape
and kidnapping on March 12, 1963. Miranda
would claim that police officers coerced him into
confessing to the crime during a grueling two-hour
interrogation, and he was not allowed to consult an
attorney. Despite objections from his attorney, who
protested that Miranda had not been informed of
his rights or given legal counsel to apprise him of his
protection against self-incrimination under the Fifth
Amendment, Miranda was convicted.
In 1966, Miranda v. Arizona reached the
Supreme Court, where Miranda’s conviction was
overturned. The landmark case substantially altered
American police practices in the interviewing of
suspects. According to the Warren Court’s majority
decision, all individuals must be notified of their
constitutional rights, including the right to have
an attorney present during questioning. Lauded by
civil libertarians, the “Miranda decision” has been
roundly criticized by law enforcement and was later
modified under the more police-friendly Warren
Burger Court in the 1980s. Miranda was retried
and reconvicted. Released from prison in 1972,
Miranda was stabbed to death in a barroom fight
four years later. Not lost on most historians was the
irony of Miranda’s killer being read his Miranda
rights in Spanish while Ernest Miranda was suc-
cumbing to his stab wounds.
These Supreme Court rulings have come under
fire in recent years, with peace officers arguing that
the decisions have placed unreasonable burdens on
them. What is often forgotten is that the decisions
regarding Miranda, Escobedo, and Mapp had little
effect on their ultimate fates since all were eventually
sentenced to prison on various other charges. Al-
though the fundamental rights guaranteed by these
decisions will never be taken away from defendants,
many legal experts believe that the decisions will be
modified. One major Supreme Court decision from
the late 1960s did just that. In the 1968 Terry v. Ohio
ruling, the Court validated an officer’s right to stop,
question, and even search a person who acted suspi-
ciously as long as the officer had reasonable grounds
for doing so. During a decade that was notable for
placing restrictions on police powers, Terry v. Ohio
clearly augured a new climate that was more favor-
able for enhancing them.
Following on the heels of the 1963 Supreme
Court decision Gideon v. Wainwright (see the
“Notable Trials” section later in this chapter), in
1967 the Court extended the Gideon ruling to juve-
nile delinquency proceedings in In re Gault, giving
children many of the procedural rights guaranteed to
adults. Five years later, the decision was extended to
adult misdemeanor cases if imprisonment was sanc-
tioned in the Argersinger v. Hamlin decision.
The due process clause contained in the Fourteenth
Amendment guaranteed certain protections to “persons.”
But until 1967, the word person did not apply to the

nation’s children, which made up one-third of the popu-
lation. In that year, the Supreme Court ruled for the first
time that many of the procedural protections extended to
adults charged with crimes should also apply to juveniles.
The events leading up to this landmark decision be-
gan in June 1964, when 15-year-old Gerald F. Gault and a
friend were picked up by the Gila County, Arizona, sheriff.
According to a neighbor, the boys had made an obscene
phone call to her. The boys were then picked up and held
for several days at a detention center. Gault was already
on probation for petty theft when he was picked up, and
the juvenile officer had enough reason to hold him.
Gault appeared before the juvenile court judge and,
when questioned, admitted to placing the obscene call.
The judge then gave Gault’s family the impression that
there would be little repercussions despite his proba-
tionary status. However, they were soon asked to appear
before the judge for a second hearing. Following the
usual juvenile court practices of the time, no records of
the previous hearing had been kept. Disagreement over
what Gerald admitted in the first hearing suddenly be-
came important after finding out that a report had been
made charging him for having made lewd and obscene
remarks in the presence of a woman. Following the usual
protocol, no copy of this report had been made available
to the youth’s family, nor were they allowed to confront
their accusers. After another period of questioning and
some discussion over what took place during the first
hearing, the judge sentenced the teenager to the state
reform school until he reached the age of 21.
If Gault had been an adult and was convicted of
similar charges, he would have been fined between $5
and $50 or faced a prison term of not more than two
months. As a youth, he faced six years in prison. At the
time, the Gaults had little recourse since the state did not
provide for appealing juvenile cases to a higher court.
While Gerald was in the state reformatory, his parents
filed a writ of habeas corpus (a petition for a hearing on the
legality of confinement). The writ asserted that Gerald was
being confined illegally. This was the only way they could
appeal the case. The family argued for the writ on the
grounds that he had been denied due process of law,
claiming the son had been denied his basic constitutional
rights during the juvenile court proceedings. After being
denied by the Arizona Supreme Court, the ruling was ap-
pealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, making it only the second
time in American history that the court reviewed a juvenile
proceeding. After listening to arguments from both sides,
almost three years after the initial obscene phone call, the
Court ruled that due process of law as guaranteed by the
Fourteenth Amendment applies to juvenile proceedings
when a child is charged with being delinquent. As a result,
the juvenile court hearings became more equitable by
granting standards of due process to juveniles.
When Richard M. Nixon was elected president
in 1968, he promised to alter the balance between the
rights of criminal defendants and society’s rights,
choosing Warren Burger (1907–1995), a moderate
conservative, to replace the retiring Earl Warren as
chief justice. Considered a “law and order” judge
with little approval for the recent due process revolu-
tion, the Burger Court disappointed many conserva-
tives by continuing to support laws governing the
rights of defendants while attempting to limit the
role of the Court.
Roe v. Wade (1973), which gave women a qual-
ified constitutional right to abortion, was one of the
most controversial Supreme Court decisions of the
twentieth century, setting off a legal debate that re-
sonates today. This highly charged case reached the
high court in two cases brought by women under
pseudonyms. In Roe v. Wade, a Texas woman chal-
lenged the state law that forbade abortion except to
save a pregnant woman’s life. Georgia’s Doe v. Bolton
case confronted provisions in the state’s law that dic-
tated that abortions could be performed only in an
accredited hospital and required several other points
of procedure, including an examination of the
woman by two other doctors besides her own phy-
sician. By a vote of seven to two, the Supreme
Court upheld the challenges, citing an individual’s
constitutional right to privacy. However, the right
to abortion was limited to include government reg-
ulation “at some point in the pregnancy” to ensure
the state’s “important interests in safeguarding
health, maintaining medical standards, and protect-
ing potential life.” This landmark court case was the
first to confirm that a woman, rather than her phy-
sician, might be the party harmed by a state’s crimi-
nalization of abortion.
LAW ENFORCEM ENT
The turbulence and social conflict that shook
America in the 1960s also had important conse-
quences for law enforcement. Police organizations
were tested on a number of fronts. The 1960s saw a
convergence of a variety of large-scale protests

involving civil rights and antiwar demonstrators.
Meanwhile, a revolution in U.S. civil rights law
championed by the Supreme Court placed limita-
tions on police work. Supreme Court decisions
challenged long-standing police customs and prac-
tices, including search and seizure, brutality, and in-
custody investigations.
In 1964, the Philadelphia Police Department
established its 100-member Special Weapons and
Tactics Squad, considered by many to be the pre-
cursor to modern SWAT teams. Designed to re-
spond quickly and decisively to bank robberies in
progress, it was soon also used to resolve other types
of incidents involving heavily armed criminals. Its
media popularity and successful field implementation
led other police forces to develop similar units, most
notably the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD).
During the late 1960s, the LAPD created Special
Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams in response
to new trends in criminal violence that included sky-
jackings, shoot-outs, and hostage taking. The 1974
gun battle with the Symbionese Liberation Army
catapulted SWAT teams to national prominence.
In 1967, the LEAA reported that “the quality of
police service will not significantly improve until
higher educational requirements are established for
its personnel.”9 August Vollmer had created a police
school at Berkeley as early as 1916, and by the 1960s
criminal justice programs flourished. In 1968, a sur-
vey by the International Association of Chiefs of
Police found that 64 colleges and universities offered
classes in criminal justice education. Many of the
programs had been established in response to the
large numbers of Korean War veterans taking advan-
tage of the GI Bill and returning to school to follow
programs related to criminal justice in the 1950s and
1960s. Within 30 years, more than 1,000 programs
were offered throughout the country.
Beginning in the early 1970s, research in sev-
eral cities, including Kansas City, demonstrated that
increasing neither the number of police officers on
random motor patrol nor the speed of their re-
sponse had little effect on crime reduction. The
1973 Kansas City study was one of the best-
known and most controversial studies of police pa-
trol efficiency in this era.
Since the inception of the London “bobbies” and New
York City “cops” in the first half of the nineteenth cen-
tury, routine police patrol has been considered a hall-
mark of modern preventive policing. The notion that
crime could be prevented or at least suppressed by a
highly regular and visible police presence has been a
long-held belief. Beginning in 1972, a one-year study was
conducted in Kansas City to test this conviction. The re-
lease of The Kansas City Preventive Patrol Experiment
report in 1974 found that police patrols, whether stepped
up or diminished, had no significant impact on crime,
police response time, public fears of crime, or their atti-
tudes toward police in the area. Led by George L. Kelling
and supported by the Police Foundation, Kelling de-
scribed this experiment as “unique in that never before
had there been such an attempt to determine through
such extensive scientific evaluation the value of visible
police patrol.”10 With traditional methods of policing
under scrutiny, new concerns about the role of police in
American society sent police experts back to the drawing
board for answers.
Policewomen
The 2,610 total policewomen in the United States
in 1950 represented just 1% of the national total. As
the women’s movement gathered steam in the
1960s, these numbers multiplied, but it took until
1968 for women to be assigned to official police
cars, when two women on the Indianapolis Police
Department achieved this level of success. The fol-
lowing year, the Washington, DC, police chief tore
down another barrier when he eliminated separate
police force applications for men and women.
Although the first documented employment of
women with police powers can be traced back to
1910, women made few inroads as crime fighters in
the male-dominated profession until the 1960s and
1970s. According to one of the foremost authorities
on policewomen, women made significant progress
in this direction in the 1950s but did not make the
transition “from social workers to crimefighters”
until 1968.11
The federal government led the way in remov-
ing impediments blocking women from the police
ranks. The creation of the Equal Opportunity
Commission in 1968 provided the impetus for
bringing women into policing in more meaningful

roles. Another barrier fell when the federal govern-
ment amended the 1964 Civil Rights Act in 1972.
The passage of the Equal Employment Opportu-
nity Act prohibited discrimination by public and
private employers.
A number of court decisions removed many ad-
ministrative and social barriers, further opening law
enforcement to women. But the reality was that
while women were joining the “thin blue line” of
policing, they were being utilized in a secondary ca-
pacity, consigned to gender-based roles from another
era. In Catherine Milton’s 1972 report on police-
women, she found that women were being used
mainly in clerical and juvenile functions, much like
their counterparts a half-century earlier. Milton also
found that women were required to conform to
higher educational standards, regulated by hiring quo-
tas based on gender, and were allowed to compete for
positions only in the women’s bureau.12 By 1974,
women made up only 2% of the country’s 166,000
police officers, with few assigned to street duty.13
The social ferment of the 1960s led many
women to question the limitations imposed on
them based on gender. However, in 1968, when
Indianapolis policewomen Betty Blankenship and
Elizabeth Coffal “donned uniforms, strapped gun-
belts to their waists, and got into their marked po-
lice car,” they left “behind their history as police
social workers to assume the role of crimefighters
along with their male colleagues.”14
While women had indeed made the transition
to crime fighters, by the 1970s they still represented
only a small percentage of the total number of po-
lice officers nationwide. According to one author-
ity, female police officers only represented 2.1% of
sworn officers in 1975. This number grew to 9,000,
or 3% of all law enforcement personnel, three years
later, and by 1980 the number of women in polic-
ing had doubled since 1960.15 However, a trend
developed in which larger cities lagged behind
smaller cities in the hiring of policewomen.
Federal Law Enforcement
Few critics had dared to publicly challenge J. Edgar
Hoover and the FBI prior to the 1960s. But the
new era witnessed an increasing chorus of Hoover
critics, including journalists, college professors, con-
gressmen, and even ex–FBI agents. In 1969, the
New York Times Magazine published what became a
much-quoted article by the respected journalist
Tom Wicker titled “What Have They Done since
They Shot Dillinger?”
Disapproval of Hoover and the FBI had been
building since the 1950s, when the FBI supplied Sen-
ator Joseph McCarthy and the House Committee on
Un-American Activities with information on “sus-
pected” communists. With the election of John F.
Kennedy as president and the ascendance of his
brother Robert to attorney general, it seemed that
Hoover’s days were numbered as FBI director. It has
been speculated that despite rancor between Hoover
and the Kennedys, he kept his job because he had
secret files on the two brothers. Waiving the manda-
tory retirement age of 70, Hoover was reappointed by
Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon.
In the Johnson years, Hoover expanded his
COINTELPRO program from investigating the
Communist Party to the Ku Klux Klan, antiwar
radical groups, and black activists. Hoover reserved
his harshest words for Martin Luther King Jr.,
whom he once referred to as a “tom cat with ob-
sessive degenerate urges.”16
COINTELPRO (counterintelligence program) was a secret FBI
program established along the lines of what FBI historian
Athan Theoharis referred to as a “department of misinfor-
mation.” In 1956 FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover authorized a
project that was called COINTELPRO-Communist Party with
the goal of countering communist influence in America. Its
anti-communist campaign become even more aggressive
than the one it had begun after World War II. By the 1960s
its goal was to create a climate of confusion and distrust
among America’s numerous radical left-wing organizations
in the 1960s. The Black Panthers organization was one of
its main targets. (It also targeted hate groups such as the
KKK in the South and black nationalists elsewhere.) Under
the administration of FBI director William H. Webster in the
1980s these type of secret police tactics were diminished, if
not discarded, as leftist groups faded into obscurity and
civil right activism declined.
Although the popular media has tended to pro-
mote FBI agents as heroes in the civil rights

movement, it was not until Attorney General
Robert Kennedy pressured FBI director Hoover to
send a large contingent of agents to investigate the
killing of three civil rights workers in 1964 that the
FBI became actively involved in the murder case.
As testament to the concern that Hoover had
for the civil rights movement and the return of the
Ku Klux Klan, the FBI did not even have a field
office in Mississippi. The 13 FBI agents who were
responsible for federal law enforcement in the state
either worked out of their homes or were housed
in federal buildings. Most of their attention was
focused on tracking down stolen cars and fugitives.
Despite a mounting terror campaign that included
the bombing of 20 black churches in Mississippi, at
the time of the disappearance of the three civil
rights workers, FBI agents claimed they had no au-
thority to act. It was not until Attorney General
Kennedy ordered the case to be treated under the
Lindbergh kidnapping law that the FBI was called
into the case, which became known as MIBURN,
or “Mississippi Burning.”
An informant’s tip would lead agents to the
missing workers’ burned-out car and eventually their
bodies, buried in an earthen dam. However, murder
was not a federal crime, so charges against the sus-
pected 19 Klan perpetrators would have to come
from the state. To arrest and convict the Klansmen,
the FBI turned to federal legislation from the late
1860s. By falling back on Reconstruction-era sta-
tutes, the Justice Department brought charges that
the Klan members had participated in a conspiracy
to deprive the three civil rights workers of their con-
stitutional right to register voters in the state of
Mississippi. After several false starts, seven of the 19
defendants were convicted by an all-white jury, the
first time in the state’s history that an all-white jury
convicted white officials or Klan members for crimes
against civil rights workers and African Americans.
However, the maximum sentence received by the
seven was 10 years. None would serve a full term in
prison, and by the mid-1970s most had returned to
their homes.
While Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil
rights leaders held to a path of peaceful nonvio-
lence, others, such as the Black Panthers and black
Muslims, stressed black separatism and militancy.
Both Presidents Johnson and Nixon were outraged
by the activities and success of the Black Panthers.
Johnson was convinced that they had a subversive
agenda and directed the FBI to begin collecting
information on them. Under Nixon, the FBI used
surveillance to infiltrate and suppress the organiza-
tion. In a short span of time, 28 Panthers were
killed and many imprisoned on debatable charges.
Having receded into the background as federal
peace officers, U.S. marshals had a resurgence with
the social unrest and protests of the 1960s. Begin-
ning in the early days of the civil rights movement
in the mid-1950s, the Justice Department recom-
mended the creation of the Executive Office for
U.S. Marshals to supervise the marshals in their
new duties. In 1962, U.S. marshals protected black
student James Meredith from violent protesters as
he broke the color barrier at the all-white Univer-
sity of Mississippi. U.S. marshals were called on
during the 1960s to protect government buildings
from antiwar demonstrators and to assist peace offi-
cers whenever federal laws were violated. In 1969,
the Executive Office for U.S. Marshals made the
transition into the U.S. Marshals Service. For the
first time, the marshals, America’s oldest federal
law enforcement organization, had a headquarters
and a bureaucracy directly under the executive
branch of government.
Under President Nixon, U.S. marshals’ duties
were expanded to include suppressing air piracy and
civil
disturbances,
prisoner
transportation,
and
court, personal, and witness security. Early in
1971, following the passage of the Organized
Crime Control Act (1970), marshals became re-
sponsible for protecting witnesses in the Witness
Protection Program.
In 1967, President Johnson took drug enforce-
ment and regulation out of the hands of the Treasury
and the Food and Drug Administration, respectively,
and created a new agency under the Justice Depart-
ment called the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs. Coinciding with this reorganization, Johnson
asked Congress to “create a ‘super agency’ to
strengthen ties between the federal government
and local police.”17 In response, Congress authorized

the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration,
which over the next decade would dispense billions
of dollars to improve policing through specialized
education and training programs and to recast the
shape of traditional policing with the adoption of
new weaponry and communications technology.
According to Christian Parenti, “Johnson laid the
groundwork for the tremendous combination of po-
lice power, surveillance, and incarceration that today
so dominates domestic politics.”18
A growing drug problem led to the creation of
the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in
1973, resulting in the merger of several agencies.
A branch of the Department of Justice, the DEA
was given the single mission of enforcing federal
drug statutes and investigating major drug traffick-
ers. While illegal drugs were nothing new to Amer-
ican culture, the explosion of the counterculture in
the 1960s led to a vociferous antidrug lobby. The
growing drug culture had several dimensions that
made it increasingly incomprehensible to the non-
drug-taking public in the 1960s and 1970s. The war
on drugs continues to be one of the most disap-
pointing criminal justice efforts as America enters
the second millennium.
CORRECTIONS
During the early 1960s, correctional facilities began
to experiment with less formal arrangements. New
prison architectural designs were created to accom-
modate treatment programs while maintaining se-
curity. In March 1963, Alcatraz closed after nearly
30 years as America’s foremost maximum “prison of
last resort.” After several highly publicized but un-
successful escape attempts, the Bureau of Prisons
was convinced that the structure had outlived its
usefulness. Increasingly seen as unsafe and too ex-
pensive to run, its proximity to San Francisco led to
its demise. Officials soon sought a replacement
somewhere in America’s heartland, settling on the
Illinois town of Marion.
Although America’s prison population enjoyed a
short decline in the early 1960s, by 1968 it was on the
increase once more, and by 1971 new commitments
had risen 35% over 1968. The following year saw a
trend develop toward longer sentences that would
contribute to swelling prison populations. By the
end of 1976, the prison population was 42% higher
than the 1968 low. With 196,000 prisoners by 1970,
rising crime rates and longer sentences led to wide-
spread overcrowding. Despite new prison construc-
tion, the number of inmates continued to outstrip
the number of cells into the 1980s.
The burgeoning civil rights movement also
affected the history of the prison system as inmates
familiarized themselves with their constitutional
rights. Among the most popular mainstays of the
so-called prison lawyer were the writ of habeas cor-
pus and the Civil Rights Act.19 By means of the writ
of habeas corpus, inmates can challenge the legality
of their confinement. Other prisoners fastened their
hopes to the Reconstruction-era Civil Rights Act,
which protected freed slaves from having their new
civil rights violated. In any case, some prisoners be-
gan to accept litigation as an alternative to violence.
In 1961, the Supreme Court (inspired by the
Civil Rights Act of 1871) ruled in Monroe v. Pape
that blacks could avoid biased local courts and sue
directly in federal court on constitutional matters.
This decision laid the foundation for the Court to
allow prison inmates to sue state officials in federal
court for the first time in Cooper v. Pate (1964).20
These edicts laid the groundwork for the avalanche
of litigation that transformed prison conditions in
the 1970s.
Prior to the 1960s, American courts allowed prisons and
their wardens to operate with little outside interference
or oversight. In 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court decision
Cooper v. Pate established the precedent that allowed
inmates to sue state officials in federal court. This and
other rulings laid the foundation for the avalanche of
litigation that transformed prison conditions in the
following decades. It began in 1962 with 22-year-old
Thomas Cooper serving a life sentence for murder. A
recent convert to Islam, he had changed his name to
Thomas X. Cooper. He had been housed in solitary con-
finement for almost 10 years at Illinois’s Stateville Prison
for attacking a corrections officer. He sued Stateville
prison warden Frank Pate. In 1964 the suit appeared
before the U.S. Supreme Court, and against the odds the

next year the Court issued its landmark decision Cooper v.
Pate setting into motion a series of prisoner lawsuits
protesting the often brutal conditions of the nation’s
prisons. This led to an unprecedented “liberalization”
of American prisons. A number of authorities have sug-
gested that it is no coincidence that a number of power-
ful prison gangs were able to form due to their enhanced
liberties and ability to meet as groups (as long as they
demonstrated some type of religious affiliation) follow-
ing this decision. Gangs quickly spread in the new liberal
prison environment that prevailed. Prior to the ruling
only Washington and California reported the presence of
gangs. By 1984 more than 60% of the country’s state and
federal prisons reported gang activity. One must also
take into account that tougher sentencing laws in the
1970s and 1980s ensured that an unprecedented number
of street gang members ended up behind bars due to the
draconian laws targeting street gang crack cocaine sales
activities on the outside. In effect, street gang members
transferred their solidarity and cohesion from the outside
to the inside.
Until the 1960s, U.S. courts allowed prisons to
operate unimpeded by the courts. This “hands-off”
policy was dramatically altered, with virtually every
aspect of correctional operation coming under court
scrutiny by the 1970s as inmates played a vital role in
prompting the courts to define the scope of their
constitutional rights. Housing, health care, recrea-
tion, mail privileges, classification, and diet were tar-
geted by the increasingly litigious prisoners, leading
the federal courts to declare nine state correctional
systems to be unconstitutional in the 1970s.
During the 1960s, prisoners in several states filed
complaints with the federal court, complaining that
they were being brutally disciplined. In many pris-
ons, particularly in the South, a “trusty” system had
been institutionalized to make up for the shortage of
prison guards and to save money. So-called trusties
were empowered to help control the other inmates
with an iron fist, leading to a number of lawsuits. In
one of its more high-profile decisions, the federal
district court ruled in Holt v. Sarver (1970) that the
practices at the Arkansas prison farms at Cummins
and Tucker were so atrocious that the entire correc-
tional system was censured. In its condemnation
of the Arkansas prison system, the federal court noted
that its management was “so bad as to be shocking
to the conscience of reasonably civilized people.”21
This case led to the hiring of a more professional
corrections staff and the dismantlement of the trusty
system.
Thomas O. Murton was teaching penology at Southern
Illinois University in 1968 when Arkansas governor
Winthrop Rockefeller recruited him to be the state’s first
professional penologist. He was named the superinten-
dent of the Cummins Prison Farm and the administrator
of the Tucker Prison Farm. Before his arrival Tucker Prison
Farm harkened back to the dark ages of confinement.
Punishments for certain infractions included inserting
needles under fingernails, crushing knuckles and testicles
with pliers, beating inmates with a 5-foot leather strap
up to 10 times a day, and the “Tucker Telephone,” which
involved stripping the inmate and strapping him to a ta-
ble and then attaching electrodes to the big toe and pe-
nis until he passed out. Initially state officials supported
Murton’s reform efforts, including the abolition of flog-
ging and physical torture. But he ran into a brick wall
when he attempted to eliminate the Cummins trustee
system, which allowed certain inmates to run roughshod
over the rest of the inmates. The Arkansas Prison System
had little public funding. While most prisons operate
with a ratio of one officer for seven inmates, in Arkansas
it was closer to one to 65. The prison system filled the
void by using trustees and mounted inmates to guard
convicts in the fields of the 4,500-acre Tucker and 16,227-
acre Cummins prison farms. Typically, prisoners worked
14-hour days, six days a week, with no remuneration.
What set the Cummins Prison scandal into motion was
Murton’s discovery that more than 200 prisoners had
been listed as escapees. The story received international
prominence and inspired the fictional film Brubaker star-
ring Robert Redford in 1980. However, Murton’s pen-
chant for publicity and his reforming zeal led to his
dismissal soon after excavations began on the farm to
look for bodies. Although only three unmarked graves
were found, Murton felt vindicated two years later when
a federal court cited conditions at Cummins as a violation
of the Eighth Amendment against cruel and unusual
punishment. Following his stint in Arkansas Murton
found it impossible to find a job in corrections and in-
stead pursued a PhD in criminology at UC-Berkeley. He
would go on to teach criminal justice at the University
of Minnesota before retiring in 1980.
One of the earliest forays by the Supreme
Court into correctional reform in the 1960s took
place in 1962, when it used the Eighth Amendment
for the first time to invalidate a state law. By a vote
of six to two, the Court held in Robinson v.

California that it was cruel and unusual punishment
to sentence individuals whose only crime was ha-
bitual drug use to prison terms.
The prisoner rights movement applied stan-
dards of due process to a number of correctional
issues that were ultimately arbitrated by the Su-
preme Court, including prisoner disciplinary hear-
ings. In Wolff v. McDonnell, the Court ruled in 1974
that due process rights did apply to inmates since
“the state did give some valued things to prisoners
that could later be taken away.”22 Due process in
front of a prison disciplinary board gave prisoners a
chance to hear the charges against them 24 hours
before the hearing and permitted inmates to call
witnesses and present evidence that favored their
defense. In addition, substitute counsel would be
provided for illiterate prisoners.
Although a series of court decisions ruled the
racial segregation of prisoners unconstitutional in
the 1960s, as late as the 1970s the practice continued
in many prisons, especially in the South, leading one
convict to observe, “I thought segregation was dead,
but there it was, as vivid as an Alabama lunch
counter in the 1950s.”23 Although this policy has
been outlawed, research indicates that inmates often
self-segregate along racial and ethnic lines by choice.
The rise and expansion of prison gangs has perpetu-
ated the de jure (or officially sanctioned) segregation
that characterized prisons until the 1960s.24
One of the consequences of the war on crime
was the growing racial disparity among prison popu-
lations beginning in the 1960s. In 1960, close to 40%
of prison inmates were classified as “nonwhite.” Less
than 14 years later, this figure grew to 49%. Nation-
wide black incarceration rose from 46.3 to 65.1 per
100,000 between 1973 and 1979, a figure more than
9 times higher than for whites.25
Mandatory Sentencing
Further exacerbating the prison-overcrowding di-
lemma was the introduction of mandatory sentencing
laws beginning in 1973, when New York State ex-
perimented with the Second Felony Offender Law,
which required those convicted of selling illegal drugs
to serve a minimum prison sentence. Subsequent
studies indicated that the law had no impact on
recidivism, but this did little to stop the clamor for
sentencing reform as conservatives continued to push
for stricter punishments.
In 1974, Florida followed New York’s exam-
ple, stipulating three-year minimum prison sen-
tences without parole for any felony involving a
firearm. By the mid-1970s, other states implemen-
ted mandatory sentencing guidelines, all resulting in
prison overcrowding. The trend toward mandatory
sentencing filled American prisons beyond capacity
by the end of the 1990s, facilitating a prison-
building boom and a growing opposition to this
type of fixed sentence.
Prison Construction
In 1972, the LEAA required a survey of American
prisons to decide how to utilize funds granted by the
federal government for the construction of state and
local prisons. After visiting more than 100 facilities in
26 states, a team that included an architect and a
psychologist reported that they were shocked by the
oppressive regimes they found at various prisons, re-
formatories, jails, and correctional institutions.26 In-
stead of recommending any precise reforms, they
advocated halting any new prison construction until
theexistinginstitutionswerebettermanaged.Themor-
atorium on prison construction eventually contributed
to more prison overcrowding as the decade wore on.
At the beginning of the 1970s, of the 113
maximum-security state prisons in operation, only
six had been built in the previous century. One of
the solutions to the traditional overcrowding of pris-
ons in the 1970s was to start building more prisons, a
trend that continues into the twenty-first century.
Between 1971 and 1978, America’s prison popula-
tion swelled by 64%, in part because of the return to
a punishment model of corrections that saw prison-
ers serving longer periods of time behind bars.
Prison Riots
Reflecting the increasingly tense social relations in
the free world, America’s prisons seethed with racial
tension beginning in the 1960s. Racial segregation

and the continuing inequities of the prison system
may “explain why more than 90 percent of all re-
corded prison riots, strikes, protests, rebellions, and
other disturbances in the United States have oc-
curred since 1960.”27
The 1960s gave birth to a number of prison
gangs as blacks, Chicanos, and white supremacists
fought for dominance behind prison walls. New
York’s Attica uprising in 1971 saw the worst fears
of prison administrators come to reality when, on
September 9, more than half the prison inmate
population of 2,200 went on the rampage, taking
guards hostage, destroying property, and preparing
for a showdown with the rapidly assembling force
of correctional and police officers and National
Guardsmen gathering outside the prison walls.
Following on the heels of the assassinations,
urban riots, and war coverage that rocked the
1960s, televised images of the Attica uprising were
seared into the national consciousness. Several days
of negotiations followed the outbreak, involving a
stellar cast of characters, including radical attorney
William Kunstler, Black Panther Bobby Seale, and
New York Times writer Tom Wicker. Fearing for
the safety of the numerous hostages, New York
Governor Nelson Rockefeller, who had refused
to come to the prison in person to negotiate, or-
dered prison officials to retake the prison.
On September 13, eight blindfolded hostages
were brought to Attica’s catwalks, each with an
inmate holding a knife to his throat. Rejecting an
ultimatum to surrender, the assault team fired tear
gas and bullets into the hundreds of inmates hud-
dled in the makeshift village in the yard. In the
ensuing confusion, 39 individuals were killed (one
of them died after the incident), including 10 hos-
tages. Initially, officials claimed that the hostages
had their throats slashed by the inmates. However,
a medical examiner’s report the next day an-
nounced that all had been killed by gunfire. Ac-
cording to the New York State Commission
Report on Attica, “With the exception of the In-
dians massacred in the late nineteenth century, the
State Police assault which ended the four-day
prison uprising was the bloodiest one-day encoun-
ter between Americans since the Civil War.”28
After many years of litigation New York State reached
a settlement with the survivors of Attica that would
award them $8 million. But by the time the case went
through the appeals process and was finally settled in
2000, more than 400 of the prisoners had died; those
who did survive shared the settlement.
Almost 100 riots convulsed prisons between
1969 and 1970, convincing even the most die-
hard progressive reformers that the correctional sys-
tem was a failure. Confidence in most rehabilitation
programs was waning and support for the treatment
model of corrections rapidly eroding. Yet the 1970s
and 1980s would be marked by even worse prison
revolts and violence.
CRIM E AND PUNISHM ENT
In a poll taken in February 1968, Americans rated
crime as the nation’s leading domestic problem for
the first time since scientific public opinion polls
were introduced in the 1930s.29 The 1968 killings
of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.
exacerbated these crime concerns. By 1970, murder
rates were double those of the previous decade, and
violent crime rose from 190 to 298 per 100,000
between 1963 and 1968. A reflection of public
opinion and the social ferment of the 1960s, state
authorities became more reluctant to utilize capital
punishment in these years, although the number of
death row prisoners grew from 219 in the 1960s to
608 a decade later.30
Juvenile crime continued to be a serious na-
tional problem. Between 1960 and 1973, juvenile
arrests for violent crimes rose by 144%. Richard
Nixon exploited the crime issue to win the presi-
dency in 1968, but in 1974, during his second term
in office, he was forced to resign from office after
he was implicated in a “third-rate” burglary at the
Democratic headquarters in the Watergate Hotel.
There is no consensus as to why crime became
such a problem in the early 1960s. Law-and-order
advocates argued that the upsurge in lawlessness was
a result of growing social tolerance. However,
criminologists have persuasively argued that it was

due more to the changing demographics as postwar
baby boomers reached their crime-prone years at
the same time.
The Federal Campaign against
Organized Crime
Finally forced to publicly acknowledge the existence
of organized crime after the 1957 Apalachin meeting
in upstate New York, the FBI intensified efforts in
its war against organized crime through its so-called
Top Hoodlum program. But few if any convictions
followed. In response, the government, under
Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy in 1961, pro-
posed new legislation to intensify the war against the
mob, including the use of wiretapping.
During the 1960s and 1970s, a number of gov-
ernment commissions and hearings were convened
to investigate organized crime, including investiga-
tions by the Task Force on Organized Crime in
1967 and 1976. The 1967 task force was most
influenced by the hearings of the 1950s Kefauver
Committee and the 1963 McClellan hearings led
by Senator John McClellan. During the 1963 hear-
ing, small-time mobster Joseph Valachi testified to
the existence of a nationwide, organized conspiracy
that he called “La Cosa Nostra.” Although his tes-
timony did not directly lead to any arrests, the
barely literate mobster became one of the first Mafia
members to break the vow of silence. His conspir-
atorial description of a monolithic organized crime
presence in America became the accepted portrait
of organized crime during the 1960s. While Con-
gress did not immediately pass the new legislation
promulgated by Attorney General Kennedy, federal
efforts against organized crime did intensify. Legis-
lation legalizing wiretapping was enacted in 1968,
and two years later new legislation to facilitate the
prosecution of racketeering was signed into law.
Following on the heels of the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act, the 1970 Organized
Crime Control Act (OCCA) was created “to seek
the eradication of organized crime in the United
States by strengthening the legal tools in the
evidence-gathering process, by establishing new
penal prohibitions, and by providing enhanced
sanctions and new remedies to deal with the un-
lawful activities of those engaged in organized
crime.”31
Chief among the crime control provisions of the
OCCA was the creation of the Racketeer Influenced
Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute. RICO is
considered by many to be the most significant piece
of legislation ever enacted against organized crime.
Originally designed to keep organized crime from
infiltrating legitimate business, it has been used to
combat all manner of criminal enterprises.
Despite its success, the RICO Act is not with-
out its critics, who claim that it is too vague and
broadly worded and violates many due process stan-
dards. Although RICO was enacted in 1970, it was
not used until almost 10 years later. Since then, it
has been used in more than 100 cases each year,
mostly against white-collar crime, violent groups,
organized crime, and political corruption.
In 1970 Congress passed the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, as Title 9 of the Orga-
nized Crime Control Act of 1970. It would revolutionize
the war against organized crime syndicates. RICO was the
brainchild of Special Attorney with the Justice Depart-
ment G. Robert Blakey. It has been speculated by many
that the acronym RICO was actually homage to the movie
Little Caesar, where Edward G. Robinson played a char-
acter modeled after Al Capone named “Rico.” Blakey has
never confirmed or denied this claim. The RICO statute is
distinct for taking a number of state and federal crimes
and mandating that if an individual or individuals commit
two of these offenses, the person is guilty of a pattern of
racketeering and subject to harsh penalties. The crimes
range from bribery, counterfeiting, drug violations, and
loansharking to selling contraband cigarettes, mail and
wire fraud, and acts of terrorism.
Capital Punishment
Beginning in the 1950s, the NAACP and the
American Civil Liberties Union became increas-
ingly involved in the defense of death row inmates,
leading to the reversal of numerous sentences. As
the court system paid more attention to death row
appeals, states became more reluctant to schedule
290

executions. Together with growing death row po-
pulations and the declining number of executions,
the Supreme Court focused its attention on the
constitutionality of the death penalty.
American public opinion had turned against
the death penalty by the mid-1960s, leading states
to informally stop executions in 1967, with the last
ones occurring in Colorado and California. For the
next five years, an informal moratorium on the
death penalty existed while the Supreme Court
evaluated its constitutionality. But executions had
been declining since the height of capital punish-
ment in the 1930s, when 218 were executed. In the
first half of the 1950s, 42 inmates were executed.
However, only 16 were put to death between 1955
and 1959 and again between 1960 and 1964.32
On September 20, 1968, 26-year-old William
Henry Furman was charged in the superior court of
Chatham County, Georgia, with murdering a
white man while fleeing a burglary. Furman, who
was African American, was caught shortly after the
crime still holding the murder weapon.
As a poor man, he was given the typical poor-
man’s trial, defended by a court-appointed lawyer.
During a one-day trial, a jury was selected in the
morning, the trial heard by 3:30 p.m., and the
judge’s guilty verdict delivered at 5:00 p.m. Despite
a psychological examination prior to the trial in
which Furman was diagnosed as mentally deficient
and prone to psychotic episodes, the court denied
his insanity plea.
Furman had testified that he accidentally fired
the weapon as he was fleeing the crime scene and
had not intended to hurt anyone. But according to
Georgia’s death penalty statute, capital punishment
stood for accidental killings as well as intentional
ones. In April 1969, Furman’s death sentence was
affirmed, but his execution was stayed the following
month so that he could file a petition with the
Supreme Court. Three years later, in 1972, his
case reached the high court, where it was argued
in the context as to whether the death penalty vio-
lated the Eight Amendment. Despite deep divisions
among the justices, Furman’s conviction was over-
turned by a five-to-four margin, with the judges
voting that the death penalty did indeed constitute
cruel and unusual punishment. In one fell swoop,
the Supreme Court gave some 600 death row pris-
oners new life, including Robert F. Kennedy’s as-
sassin Sirhan Sirhan and murder cult leader Charles
Manson.
Speaking for the majority, after reviewing the
history of capital punishment under common law,
Justice William O. Douglas (1898–1980) concluded
that the death penalty was disproportionately applied
to blacks, the poor, and other disadvantaged groups.
Furman v. Georgia is regarded as a landmark decision
protecting marginalized Americans from the death
penalty. The decision did not abolish the death pen-
alty but merely placed stricter requirements on death
penalty statutes at both the state and the federal level.
According to the Court, the death penalty had be-
come “cruel and unusual” punishment because it
was being invoked in a capricious and arbitrary man-
ner, violating the constitutional protections guaran-
teed by the Eighth Amendment.
In 1976, the Supreme Court upheld the death
penalty in the case of Gregg v. Georgia, and in 1977,
the states, under public and political pressure, began
revising their capital punishment statutes to fall un-
der the new Supreme Court guidelines. In the Gregg
decision, the Court ruled that convicted killers in
Georgia were protected by a revised statute that re-
quired sentencing hearings and other protective pro-
cedures. The majority of other death penalty states
have revamped their statutes in a similar manner. In
addition to making strides to protect the poor, the
mentally ill, and minorities, most states have repealed
the death penalty for accidental killings and other
homicides less serious than premeditated murder.
Ten years after America’s last execution, the
death penalty returned to American criminal justice.
Despite a crescendo of protest from opposition
groups, Gary Gilmore was determined to die for
his crimes. There was little that could be done
when a convicted prisoner was determined not to
miss his own execution. Sentenced to die for two
robbery/murders in 1976, Gilmore was steadfast in
his resolution to see the state execute him. This
rather ordinary murder case eventually led to an ex-
traordinary conclusion, as Gilmore would become
the first person to be executed in 10 years. The

case received worldwide attention and inspired
famed author Norman Mailer to chronicle Gilmore’s
plight in the Pulitzer Prize–winning account of his
life and death in The Executioner’s Song. On January
17, 1977, Gilmore’s lawyers managed to overturn a
restraining order halting the execution, and Gilmore
had his final wish granted when he was shot to death
by a firing squad at the Utah State Prison.
AMERIC AN VIOLENCE
The civil rights movement of the late 1950s and
early 1960s led the dormant Ku Klux Klan to
once more raise its pestilent head. Not as large or
powerful as the Reconstruction-era Klan, the 1960s
incarnation was no less violent. Of the numerous
Klan factions, the most violent was in Alabama,
where it was responsible for a number of murders,
including the 1963 Birmingham church bombing
in which four black schoolgirls were killed.
No era in American history was marked by the
murder of as many leading public figures as the
1960s. Leaders as diverse as Martin Luther King Jr.,
John
F.
Kennedy,
Medgar
Evers,
Robert
F.
Kennedy, and Malcolm X were silenced by assassins’
bullets. In the 1970s, President Gerald Ford narrowly
escaped death on two separate occasions at the hands
of female assassins. And in 1972, presidential candi-
date George Wallace was permanently crippled by
gunfire while campaigning.

(1917–1963) on November 22, 1963, is one of the
most chronicled murders in American history.
Sworn in as the 35th president on January 20,
1961, his term was cut short when he was shot
and killed by a sniper’s bullet while traveling in a
motorcade in Dallas, Texas. Lee Harvey Oswald
was arrested for the murder, but only two days after
his arrest, Oswald was shot and killed by Dallas
nightclub owner Jack Ruby.
Assuming
the
presidency,
Vice
President
Lyndon B. Johnson appointed a commission to
investigate the killing. Led by Chief Justice Earl
Warren, the Warren Commission ruled in 1964
that Oswald acted alone, firing the fatal shots
from a window of the sixth floor of the Texas
Book
Depository.
The
assassination
has
been
shrouded ever since in mystery and rumors of
conspiracy plots. A number of commissions have
investigated various conspiracy theories, but despite
many unanswered questions, no evidence of con-
spiracy has been substantiated.
In 1965, American black nationalist leader
Malcolm X (1925-1965) was shot to death while ad-
dressing a crowd in New York City. Born Malcolm
Little, he joined the Nation of Islam while serving a
stint in prison for burglary. He rose through the ranks
of the movement to become its second most impor-
tant member. But when he broke away and formed
his own group in 1964 his days were numbered. In
2010 the last of the three men convicted of murdering
him was released from prison after serving almost
40 years. In April 1968, the Reverend Martin Luther
King Jr. (1929–1968), America’s leading civil rights
figure, was murdered in Memphis, Tennessee. The
recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, King
had become nationally identified with the civil rights
movement in the 1950s while leading boycotts and
protests in the segregated South. Murdered by a
sniper while standing on the balcony of his hotel,
King was in Memphis in support of striking sanitation
workers. Black urban neighborhoods erupted in vio-
lence following the assassination. James Earl Ray was
eventually arrested for murder. Although Ray pled
guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment, ques-
tions still persist as to how the uneducated, provincial,
and indigent Ray was able to escape to London
(unassisted), where he was apprehended.
On the election of his brother as president in
1960, Robert F. Kennedy became the youngest
attorney general in U.S. history. Although his ear-
lier career was tarnished by his association with
communist hunter Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s,
by the 1960s Kennedy had become a leading sup-
porter of the civil rights movement and an impla-
cable foe of organized crime. Three months after
announcing his own candidacy for president, on
June 5, 1968, Robert Kennedy was slain by Sirhan
Sirhan the night he celebrated his victory in the
California primary.

Best remembered as a presidential candidate and assassi-
nation victim in 1968, Robert F. Kennedy (1925–1968)
emerged on the American criminal justice scene in the
1950s, first as an attorney in the criminal division of the
Justice Department and then while serving on the legal
staff of Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Un-
American Activities Committee. He had his first run-in
with future nemesis Jimmy Hoffa in 1957, when he was
the chief counsel to the Select Committee on Improper
Activities in the Labor or Management Field. However,
the committee failed to indict Hoffa and only furthered
Kennedy’s resolve to get the mobbed-up labor boss later
on. He got his chance in 1961 when he was appointed
U.S. Attorney General by his brother President John F.
Kennedy in 1961. He made one of his first points of
business to launch a campaign against organized crime.
Under his watch federal prosecution of organized crime
cases increased from 19 in 1960 to 687 in 1964. However,
due to weak federal anti-racketeering laws in the pre-
RICO era, his office had only limited authority in this
arena. His crusade to convict prominent crime bosses and
mobbed-up labor leaders such as Jimmy Hoffa was an
uphill battle. Hoffa was ultimately sentenced to prison
for jury tampering rather than racketeering. His zealous-
ness in the pursuit of organized crime and Hoffa led
some to describe the labor and racketeering subdivision
of the Organized Crime Section as the “Get Hoffa
Squad,” while others evoked comparisons to the inquisi-
tors of the “Spanish Inquisition.” Perhaps his greatest
achievement was bringing together for the first time in
American history so many (more than two dozen) federal
agencies in the campaign against organized crime. Critics
aside, those who worked under him testified that they never
worked under a more dedicated highly ranked official.
Rioting and Civil Disobedience
During the 1960s, the law enforcement establish-
ment was increasingly tested by a wide variety of
mass confrontations. Violent riots have sporadically
punctuated urban American life since the colonial
era. Despite the deaths of 38 individuals in the 1943
Detroit riot, race riots began to follow a new pat-
tern in which rioters targeted buildings and com-
mercial goods more than people.
The best-known race riot of the 1960s occurred in the
Watts area of Los Angeles in 1965. On the evening of
August 11, two young African American men were
stopped by the California Highway Patrol for reckless
driving in the inner-city neighborhood of Watts. Soon
after the arrival of members of the Los Angeles Police
Department, the scene deteriorated into chaos. The de-
partment had a reputation for brutality and bad relations
with the city’s black community. A rumor spread through
the area that police had roughed up a pregnant black
woman. Although it proved false, it was enough to ignite
one of the nation’s worst episodes of civil unrest. Over the
following week, more than 30 mostly black residents were
killed. Looting and arson damage estimates reached $200
million. President Johnson appointed a commission led by
former CIA director John McCone to investigate the riots.
According to the findings of the McCone Commis-
sion, black Los Angeles was like a powder keg ready to
explode. Black migrants had been drawn to the city dur-
ing the 1940s to take advantage of wartime employment.
However, they were confronted with limited housing
opportunities and racial discrimination. Since mass trans-
portation was limited in the city, blacks had to shop lo-
cally, where stores were notorious for selling poor goods
at high prices. The retail community bore the brunt of
most of the property damage during the riot.33
The race riots of the 1960s were marked by the
destruction of property and communities, shocking
citizens of all races. The urban riots of 1966 and
1967 proved particularly destructive. Of the 38 riots
that took place in 1967, some of the most serious
took place in Chicago, Cleveland, and San Fran-
cisco, resulting in seven deaths, more than 400
injuries, 3,000 arrests, and property damage exceed-
ing $5 million. The following year would be worse.
By the end of October, there had been more than
150 outbreaks of civil unrest. Of these, 33 necessi-
tated the intervention of the state police and eight
the National Guard. Observing the aftermath of the
Detroit riot that left thousands of buildings in ruins,
Mayor Jerome Cavanaugh remarked that the city
“looks like Berlin in 1945.”34 The 43 deaths during
the Detroit riot surpassed those during the Watts
uprising.
In the wake of the assassination of Martin
Luther King Jr. in 1968, looting and burning
erupted in more than 150 cities, with some of the
worst damage occurring in the nation’s capital. Of
the 46 deaths during the riots, all but five were
black. While this ratio of black to white deaths
was a familiar refrain from past rioting, what was

new was the amount of power summoned to end
the disturbances. In what was probably the largest
single deployment of military and paramilitary
forces for a civilian purpose since the Civil War,
34,000 National Guardsmen, 21,000 federal troops,
and thousands of local police were brought in to
quell the “disturbances.”
Many black and white residents of the nation’s
capital had considered the city “riot-proof” in
1968. Unlike other urban centers with large black
populations, many blacks were well entrenched in
good-paying government jobs. According to one
study35 of the Washington riot, one out of every
four federal employees in the area was African
American. A black sat on the Supreme Court
(Thurgood Marshall) and in the president’s cabinet
(Housing Secretary Robert C. Weaver). Federal
troops had been called to Washington, DC, on
three previous occasions during the past 50 years
but only once for racial strife.
However, like most other cities, there was a
darker side that tourists and visitors rarely saw. By
the 1960s, Washington, DC, had foundering hospi-
tal and school systems and was surpassed only by
Mississippi in infant mortality. More than one out
of every four families lived below the poverty line.
In addition, the city had some of the highest rates of
tuberculosis and syphilis in the nation. Large sec-
tions of the city were bereft of public transporta-
tion, limiting job prospects in the suburbs. Civic
leaders began warning of unrest, which was nar-
rowly averted on several occasions. Particular dis-
dain in the black community was reserved for the
Washington police force, which they regarded as
racist. With blacks representing 67% of the popula-
tion, the highest percentage in any major city, four
out of every five police officers were white. Despite
urgings from the White House to modernize and
become more responsive to the community, the
department dragged its feet.36
In 1967, President Johnson appointed the Na-
tional Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders,
chaired by Otto Kerner, former Illinois governor.
Kerner’s committee queried social scientists, police
officers, politicians, and civic leaders for solutions to
the civil unrest plaguing the nation. According to
the commission’s findings, better known as the
Kerner Commission Report, the torpid initial police
response to many riots allowed civil unrest to often
flare out of control. The Kerner Commission was
reminiscent of the commission created in the wake
of the 1919 Chicago riot. Whereas earlier commis-
sions convened to study civil disorder, the Kerner
Commission was the “first federally funded, na-
tional and Presidential-level examination of race re-
lations in the United States.”37 The Kerner Report
was published in 1969, selling two million copies.
A survey of the black residents in Detroit fol-
lowing the 1967 riot revealed that three-quarters of
them believed that the police acted too slowly to
control the disorder.38 Henceforth, departments
would need to adhere to new requirements if
they were to be effective in controlling disorder,
which meant being able to deploy manpower
quickly and efficiently. This would take some doing
since the Kerner Commission noted that the aver-
age police department had only 13% of its patrol
force available between the hours of 4:00 p.m.
and midnight, the hours when most riots began.
There were other concerns that needed to be ad-
dressed as well. Few if any departments had any
contingency plans for controlling disorder once it
began, and most were likely to be short of essential
equipment. During one major eruption of civil dis-
order, the commission found that out of a police
force of 5,000, only 192 were on duty for a city of
one million.39 However, the commission reserved
its greatest criticism for the lack of police training
for riot control, finding that the only riot training
was provided in recruit school.40
Running on a law-and-order platform in the
1968 presidential campaign, Richard Nixon casti-
gated the Kerner Commission for blaming “every-
body for the riots except the perpetrators.”41 After
taking office in early 1969, Nixon recommended
more funding for the LEAA to supply police de-
partments with tanks, armored cars, helicopters, riot
control equipment, and a national computerized
identification system for fighting crime. A reflection
of the new administration’s support for law en-
forcement was its increased funding for LEAA,
from $63 million in 1969 to $268 million in 1970

and $700 million just two years later. To seem
tough on crime, Congress was coerced by the
White House to pass questionable bills, such as the
“no-knock” provision, which allowed police to
break into a house without a search warrant, and
preventative detention, which would allow judges
to jail suspects for 60 days before trial. In response,
Senator Sam Ervin Jr., who would later receive
prominence for his performance at the Watergate
trial, referred to these provisions as “A Bill to
Repeal
the
Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and
Eighth
Amendments to the Constitution.”42
In the early 1960s, leftist groups, such as Stu-
dents for a Democratic Society (SDS), participated
in freedom rides and voter registration drives in the
still-segregated South. By the mid-1960s, their at-
tention was diverted to the antiwar crusade, and in
1968 the organization counted more than 100,000
members. Thousands more belonged to the Yippies
and other radical groups.
One of the most memorable images of 1968
was of thousands of antiwar protesters being beaten
by Chicago police during the Chicago Democratic
Convention. A subsequent investigative commission
later described police tactics as a “police riot.”43 In
reality, much of the blame rested with the adminis-
tration of Chicago Mayor Richard Daley.44 In the
riots following the assassination of Martin Luther
King Jr. earlier in the year, the Chicago police had
reacted with remarkable leniency. Afterward, the
mayor had admonished the force for its timidity in
putting down the riot, having ordered them “to
shoot to kill arsonists and maim looters.”
One of the most egregious episodes of the
Vietnam War era, the Kent State shootings on
May 4, 1970, demonstrated the growing antipathy
between pro-war and antiwar factions. President
Nixon’s order for an American incursion into
Cambodia on May 1 ignited strident student protests
on many campuses across the country. Protests at
Kent State University in Ohio led the mayor to de-
clare a state of civil emergency and to request the
National Guard to keep order. With the arrival of
the Guard, tensions mounted. As students launched
projectiles and profanities at the National Guard, the
armed Guardsmen directed tear gas canisters at their
adversaries. Shortly after noon, the Guardsmen opened
fire on the protesters, wounding nine students and
killing four in just 13 seconds. Following an investiga-
tion by the FBI, the Justice Department declared the
shootings unwarranted. Following several other inves-
tigations, the National Guardsmen were exonerated,
leading to many years of civil and criminal suits.
Equally controversial but less well known were
the shooting deaths of two black students and the
wounding of 12 others by state troopers and city
police at Jackson State University (formerly Jackson
State College) in Jackson, Mississippi, 10 days after
the shootings at Kent State. The shootings followed
anti–Vietnam War draft protests targeting Mississip-
pi’s all-white draft boards. This, combined with the
ongoing legacy of racial discrimination, led to the
fatal encounter on May 14, 1970. Tensions escalated
after a series of confrontations between African
American students and white police officers. After
one student threw a bottle in their direction, the
police unleashed a barrage of gunfire in front of
one of the dormitories. As at Kent State, no one
was ever indicted for the homicides, adding to the
political divide that cleaved the nation. Many attrib-
uted the Jackson State shootings to tensions lingering
from the “Freedom Summer” of the late 1960s,
when civil rights activists targeting the state to regis-
ter black voters antagonized white police officers.45
Although the incident provoked nationwide indig-
nation for several days, it soon faded from memory.
Many observers suggested that national outrage at
the shooting of the African American students
would have been greater if they had been white.
Murder
Seemingly new types of homicides captured the
nation’s and the law enforcement community’s at-
tention beginning in the 1960s. The omnipresence
of television, together with the newsprint media,
would bring the horrors of Vietnam and mass mur-
der to the evening dinner table. There were ample
crimes to capture their attention. During the early
1960s, Albert DeSalvo captured the media’s atten-
tion, claiming that he was the serial killer and rapist
“the Boston Strangler,” responsible for hundreds of

rapes and the murders of at least 13 women (al-
though there was no evidence to link him to the
murders and recent research suggests that he was
probably not responsible for most, if not all, of
the murders). As the decade moved to a conclusion,
the “Zodiac” killer targeted couples in the hills out-
side San Francisco, and serial killer Edmund Kem-
per began a killing spree that would conclude with
the murder of his mother in 1973. According to
one expert, “serial murder” became much “more
frequent since the late 1960s and offenders tend to
kill larger number of victims.”46
James Alan Fox, one of the country’s leading
authorities on homicide, suggested that “the onset
of the age of mass murder” began in 1966.47 The
summer of 1966 would introduce Americans to the
horrors of mass murder as Charles Whitman
gunned down 16 people with devastating accuracy
from the top of a tower at the University of Texas
(like Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, Whitman
was also a former Marine) and Richard Speck stabbed
to death eight student nurses in Chicago.
The rising incidence of mass murder in the
1970s led several states to recognize this crime as
a distinct type of homicide. California, for in-
stance, had previously made first-degree murder
punishable by seven years’ imprisonment followed
by parole eligibility. In the aftermath of highly
publicized mass shootings in the 1970s, the law
was amended to allow the jury to add the addi-
tional charge of multiple murder. In these cases,
the only applicable sentence was the death penalty
or life in prison.48
Meanwhile, older, more traditional regional pat-
terns of murder continued to prevail. In the summer
of 1964, three civil rights activists, two of them
white, were arrested for speeding in Philadelphia,
Mississippi. After their arrests, they were conve-
niently released into the waiting hands of local white
supremacists who brutally murdered them and then
hid their bodies in an earthen dam. At the time of
the crime, Mississippi was considered the nation’s
most segregated state. It had the highest percentage
of blacks and the lowest percentage of registered
black voters, with only 6% of its black population
of almost one million eligible to vote.
In the summer of 1964, national civil rights
leaders called on student volunteers to use their va-
cation to help register Mississippi’s black citizens to
vote
in
what
became
known
as
“Freedom
Summer.” While students were given a “survival
course” before leaving for Mississippi, it would do
little to prevent the murder of three civil rights
workers and the beating of dozens more. More
than 150 FBI agents ultimately investigated the
murder of the civil rights workers, and an investi-
gation led to the arrest and conviction of seven
members of the newly revived Ku Klux Klan.
Klan membership had peaked in the 1920s.
However, membership surged upward in response
to the growing civil rights movement and after the
election of a Catholic president (Kennedy) in 1960.
The Klan was far from monolithic. There was no
central headquarters, but regional offices flourished
throughout the South. By 1965, the Mississippi
Klan boasted 5,000 members.
No murders or crimes symbolized the 1960s
more than those committed by the Manson family
in California in the late 1960s. After Charles Manson
left prison in 1967, he moved to San Francisco,
which was in the last stages of the so-called Summer
of Love. Manson used his magnetic personality to
great advantage, drawing a number of runaways
and homeless young girls to his paranoid banner,
forming the nucleus of what became known as the
“Manson Family.” Their many crimes have been
well chronicled and reached a crescendo of sorts
with the massacre of movie starlet Sharon Tate and
four others on the evening of August 9, 1969. The
subsequent nine-and-a-half-month trial led to the
conviction of four defendants for murder, but their
lives would be spared in 1972 when the Supreme
Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional,
converting all death sentences to life in prison.
NOTABLE TRIALS
Gideon v. Wainwright
Early on a June morning in 1961, a Panama City,
Florida, police officer on patrol noticed an open

door at a local pool hall well after closing time. On
further examination, the officer noted that someone
had burglarized a jukebox and a cigarette machine.
This was hardly the crime of the century, but nev-
ertheless suspicion quickly settled on an indigent
drifter named Clarence Gideon. Few could have
imagined the consequences of such a seemingly in-
consequential crime.
While federal law had guaranteed the right to
counsel at the federal level since the inception of
the Republic, as the law stood on the state level,
courts did not have to offer court-appointed attor-
neys to defendants in noncapital trials. Most penni-
less defendants had no recourse but to defend
themselves
without
the
benefit
of
a
court-
appointed attorney.49 Although several states pro-
vided felony defendants with counsel, Florida was
not among them. Chronicling Gideon’s case in
Gideon’s Trumpet, author Anthony Lewis wrote,
“Judging from the externals it would be hard to
imagine a figure less likely to be the subject of a
great case in the Supreme Court” than Clarence
Gideon. With little education, Gideon was no
match for the prosecuting attorney, particularly
after the jury heard the testimony of an individual
who claimed to have observed Gideon pilfering the
poolroom vending machines. In a trial that lasted
less than one day, Gideon was found guilty of
breaking into a poolroom to commit a felony and
was sentenced to five years in prison.
But the Supreme Court had not counted on the
resourcefulness of the intrepid Gideon. After having
a writ of habeas corpus denied by the Florida Su-
preme Court, in which he claimed to have been
illegally imprisoned, Gideon wrote a five-page pen-
ciled document to the U.S. Supreme Court asking
the court to hear his case. With thousands of similar
petitions filed each year, the odds were stacked
against the Court’s considering his case. However,
the Court agreed to hear his case in January 1963.
Shortly before the case was heard, the director
of Florida’s Division of Corrections was replaced by
Louie L. Wainwright, ensuring the new director of
his place in legal history. In the initial hearing of
Gideon v. Wainwright, there was harsh debate among
the justices over the need to change the law. But the
1960s had inaugurated a new vantage point from
which to discuss the rights of defendants, and on
March 18, 1963, the Supreme Court unanimously
ruled that all felony defendants were entitled to legal
representation no matter what crime had been com-
mitted. Overturning Gideon’s conviction, Justice
Hugo L. Black wrote, “Reason and reflection re-
quires us to recognize that in our adversary system
of criminal justice, any person hauled into court,
who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured
a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him.”50
In August 1963, Gideon returned to court, this
time accompanied by an experienced trial lawyer. But
angered by adverse publicity, the prosecution made
sure a “dream team” of lawyers were on hand to see
that the charges stuck this time. However, with the
aid of his defense attorney, the witness from the first
trial was shown under questioning to have withheld
his criminal record from the earlier jury. Subse-
quently, Gideon
was acquitted
of
all
charges.
Clarence Gideon died at the age of 61 in 1972 but
not until he had ensured that the right to counsel
under the Sixth Amendment had become absolute
and applicable everywhere in all courts of the land.
Born Francisco Vincent Serpico in New York City in 1936,
Frank joined the NYPD in 1959. He came to national at-
tention in the 1970s after he broke the “blue wall of
silence” and reported his corrupt colleagues, first to his
superiors (who ignored him) and then to the New York
Times. Soon after testifying against one of his fellow
cops, Serpico was shot in the face by a drug suspect while
making an arrest after the other officers failed to back
him up. Most beat officers considered him a “rat” and
ignored timeworn police tradition of visiting their fellow
wounded officers. One even sent him a card with the
message, “With sincere sympathy … that you didn’t get
your brains blown out rat bastard.” After the New York
Times published an investigative series on police corrup-
tion an investigation known as the Knapp Commission
was convened and led to mass resignations in the NYPD.
Led by Wall Street lawyer Whitman Knapp, the commis-
sion investigated the force for two years before releasing
its final report in 1973. According to its conclusions more
than half of the city’s 29,600 police officers had partici-
pated in some type of corrupt activity. The Knapp Com-
mission uncovered two types of corrupt officers. “Meat-
eaters” were the relatively small contingent of officers
who spent most of their working hours looking for

opportunities that they could exploit for financial gain,
including gambling and illegal drugs. “Grass-eaters,” on
the other hand, were the vast majority of patrolmen who
did not necessarily accept payoffs but occasionally re-
ceived gratuities from various entrepreneurs, such as free
meals and coffee and donuts. Frank Serpico retired in
1974 and left the United States to live in Europe.
CONCLUSIONS
As the 1960s spiraled to an end, Americans had
become increasingly concerned about the high
levels of disorder and violence in the culture.
Between 1963 and 1970, the national homicide
rate had doubled from 4.6 to 9.2 per 100,000.51
No place was more deadly than America’s urban
centers. Americans increasingly feared crime during
the 1960s and 1970s. By 1978, 85% of Americans
believed that the criminal justice system should be
more punitive.52 Public opinion that once favored a
moratorium on the death penalty was shifting as
well. The 1960s began with a decline in executions
and then an informal moratorium that existed from
1967 to 1972. By the 1980s, two out of every three
Americans favored the death penalty.53
The National Commission on the Causes of and
Prevention of Violence recorded 239 urban riots in
America between 1963 and 1968. Historian Paul
Gilje suggested that there was “a contagion of disor-
der, just as in the 1760s and 1770s and the 1830s and
1840s spreading across the land.”54 Subsequent com-
missions blamed the riots on insufficient police re-
sponse, while others saw the conflagrations as an
outgrowth of police and civilian confrontations.
Whatever the cause, extensive television coverage
reminded Americans that while there was progress
in breaking down southern segregation, de facto
segregation persisted in much of urban America.
Among the commissions to investigate the rioting
was the Kerner Commission, which concluded
that urban disorder resulted from the unequal treat-
ment of blacks that created two separate societies.
Building on a tradition begun by the 1930
Wickersham Commission Report, communities con-
vened committees to investigate various facets of the
criminal justice system during the 1960s and 1970s.
According to John Conley, “The establishment of
blue ribbon commissions to study complex social pro-
blems has been a common element of American po-
litical history … to study problems related to crime
and the administration of justice.”55
Although the Wickersham Commission was
the first national commission on crime, some of the
best-known commissions of the 1960s and 1970s
were more local in scope. While the Kerner Com-
mission investigated civil disorders nationwide, the
Knapp Commission examined corruption in New
York City only. There were a number of lesser-
known investigations conducted at almost every
level of government. Cities including Philadelphia,
Chicago, and Washington, DC, were examined in
great detail. In 1965, President Johnson oversaw the
creation of the President’s Commission on Crime
in the District of Columbia. Assisted by a staff of
criminologists, psychologists, social workers, and
correctional experts, the commission investigated
the causes of crime and delinquency, the adequacy
of existing criminal laws, the relationships between
the police and the community, and many related
issues. Its mammoth 1,041-page report was pub-
lished in 1966. Despite many well-thought-out
conclusions and recommendations, most went un-
heeded, and these cities continued to be character-
ized by criminal activity and economic despair as
the 1980s loomed on the horizon.
Police work changed dramatically in the 1960s
and 1970s. The publication of The Challenge of Crime
in a Free Society in 1968 devoted considerable atten-
tion to the changing nature of police work. Among
its most controversial conclusions was that it had
been unable to discover “the relationship between
police patrol and deterrence.”56 Rising crime rates,
urban riots, and antiwar violence led police execu-
tives and political leaders to examine the role of
police as crime fighters. Although a number of po-
lice authorities blamed the rising crime problem on
the limitations imposed on them by Miranda, Mapp,
and Escobedo, a more convincing explanation per-
haps could be found in the number of young males
15 to 24 coming of age in the 1960s and 1970s, an
age group that has traditionally been responsible for
most violations of the law.

In its final report on the riots following the
killing of Martin Luther King Jr., the Kerner Com-
mission noted, “Our nation is moving toward two
societies, one black and one white—separate and
unequal.” However, the commission’s report was
not all doom and gloom, suggesting that the “deep-
ening racial division is not inevitable” and could
“be reversed.”57
The death of J. Edgar Hoover in 1972 ended an
era in American criminal justice history. His last
years as FBI director became increasingly bizarre,
and although he is credited with creating the profes-
sional FBI, suppressing kidnapping and bank robbery
in the 1930s and containing the espionage menace
during World War II, Hoover will probably be re-
membered for violating constitutional protections
and keeping secret files. Unfortunately, future his-
torians will be able to only presume what was in his
personal files since his secretary apparently had them
destroyed following Hoover’s death.
Congressional investigations during the 1970s
uncovered numerous flagrant violations of civil lib-
erties by the FBI. Defying federal laws, FBI agents
broke into the homes, tapped the phones, and
opened up the mail of American citizens; illegally
infiltrated antiwar groups and black radical organi-
zations; and compiled dossiers on thousands of dis-
sidents. Following these investigations, Congress
laid down strict guidelines for FBI activities.
The correctional system was rent by political
activism and large-scale violence in the 1970s, lead-
ing by the end of the decade to the “demise of the
treatment model … a breakdown in prisoners’
unity,
and
a
return
to
classical
notions
of
punishment.”58 The extensive media coverage of
the Attica riot in 1971, still the bloodiest prison
riot in American history, “crystallized doubts about
the purposes of imprisonment in America” at a time
when the criminal justice system was becoming in-
creasingly punitive.59 Rising prison populations in
the next two decades would only intensify doubts
about these institutions.
While law enforcement and the machinery of
crime fighting were bolstered by hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars through the LEAA, little attention
was paid to the underlying social and economic
problems that led to crime and incarceration.
Despite the concerted get-tough war on crime, se-
rious crimes continued to skyrocket into the 1980s.
Point–Counterpoint
On the Pad: The Criminal Justice System
and Police Corruption
Corruption is nothing new to metropolitan America. Cities
big and small have been plagued by this problem since the
inception of modern policing. In 1967 the President’s
Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of
Justice released its Task Force Report on the Police. The
main charge of the task force was to examine the role of the
police in modern America. Among its many conclusions was
that there was a need to emphasize police integrity and ethical
conduct. According to the authors of the report, police leaders
were currently making inroads on stemming police corruption.
However, within five years the nation’s best-known city force
was rocked by scandal. The Knapp Commission investigated
police corruption in New York City for more than two years
before releasing its report in late 1972. According to the
report, more than half of the city’s 29,600 police officers had
participated in some type of corrupt activity. The Knapp
Commission uncovered two types of corrupt officers—grass-
eaters and meat-eaters. The first passage is from the Knapp
report describing these types. The passage from the task force
report chapter on police integrity follows.
GRASS-EATERS AND
MEAT-EATERS
Corrupt policemen have been informally described
as being either “grass-eaters” or “meat-eaters.” The
overwhelming majority of those who do take pay-
offs are grass-eaters, who accept gratuities and solicit
five- and ten- and twenty-dollar payments from
contractors, tow-truck operators, gamblers, and the

like, but do not aggressively pursue corruption
payments. “Meat-eaters,” probably only a small per-
centage of the force, spend a good deal of their
working hours aggressively seeking out situations
they can exploit for financial gain, including gam-
bling, narcotics, and other serious offenses which can
yield payments of thousands of dollars. Patrolman
William Phillips was certainly an example of this
latter category.
One strong impetus encouraging grass-eaters to
continue to accept relatively petty graft is, ironi-
cally, their feeling of loyalty to their fellow officers.
Accepting payoff money is one way for an officer to
prove that he is one of the boys and that he can be
trusted. In the climate which existed in the Depart-
ment during the Commission’s investigation, at
least at the precinct level, these numerous but rela-
tively small payoffs were a fact of life, and those
officers who made a point of refusing them were
not accepted closely into the fellowship of police-
men. Corruption among grass-eaters obviously can-
not be met by attempting to arrest them all and will
probably diminish only if Commissioner Murphy is
successful in his efforts to change the rank and file
attitude toward corruption.
No change in attitude, however, is likely to
affect a meat-eater, whose yearly income in graft
amounts to many thousands of dollars and who
may take payoffs of $5,000 or even $50,000 in
one fell swoop (former Assistant Chief Inspector
Sydney Cooper, who had been active in anti-
corruption work for years, recently stated that the
largest score of which he had heard—although he
was unable to verify it—was a narcotics payoff in-
volving $250,000). Such men are willing to take
considerable risks as long as the potential profit re-
mains so large. Probably the only way to deal with
them will be to ferret them out individually and get
them off the force, and, hopefully, into prisons.
It is the police themselves, in the vast majority
of cases, who are ridding their profession of the
unethical and the corrupt. An ever-increasing num-
ber of law enforcement leaders are realizing that
vigilance against such practices is a continuing part
of their responsibilities. For over 40 years Director
J. Edgar Hoover and his associates throughout the
FBI organization have set an outstanding example
of integrity within a law enforcement agency.
Through the influence of its special agents through-
out the country, working in close contact with lo-
cal police officers, and through its training programs
at the FBI National Academy and local training
schools, the FBI has encouraged thousands of police
officers to emulate its standards.
National, State, and local police associations have
also done a great deal to encourage police integrity.
The Law Enforcement Code of Ethics has been
adopted by all major police associations and agencies
throughout the Nation. In California, for example,
State law requires that police ethics be taught and
that the code be administered as an oath to all police
recruits training in the 45 police academies certified
by the State Commission on Peace Officers Standards.
In 1955, the International Conference of Police As-
sociations developed a lesson plan for the teaching of
ethics within police organizations. The California
Peace Officers Association and the Peace Officers
Research Association maintain highly active commit-
tees on police standards and ethics and are responsible
for most of the high ethical standards established
throughout the State. And the International Associa-
tion of Chiefs of Police constantly strives to establish
and maintain honest police leadership. Other police
consulting firms have made similar recommendations.
Through numerous surveys of police departments, it
has pointed up the need for maintaining police integ-
rity through the establishment of internal investiga-
tion units. The Fraternal Order of Police has
stressed the need for attracting high caliber police re-
cruits through adequate salaries, sound retirement sys-
tems and other benefits.
Such groups should increase their activity in this
field. Local police associations especially must be alert
to the problem, recognizing the relationship between
maintaining integrity and good conduct and improv-
ing the public image of the police. This can lead to
more adequate pay and equipment, along with im-
proved working conditions. Associations that come to
the aid of dishonest officers render an obvious disser-
vice, not only to themselves, but to the entire police
profession.

By the time the federal Law Enforcement Assistance
Administration was abolished in 1982 (it became the
National Institute of Justice, which still sponsors
criminal research projects), hundreds of millions of
dollars had been directed at improving the criminal
justice system. So much focus on crime and criminal
justice (and so much federal money available) led
many colleges and universities to establish criminal
justice programs. Additional funding for more police
officers, prosecutors, courts, and prisons led to more
reported crimes and arrests and convictions, leading to
more prisoners for an overcrowded prison system.
Not surprisingly, between 1970 and 1983, the num-
ber of criminal justice employees rose from 701,767 to
1,270,342.1 But despite better-trained and better-
equipped law enforcement personnel, crime rates
and prison populations continued to escalate.
The ascendance of Ronald Reagan to the pres-
idency in 1980 signaled a new era in criminal justice
policy. With the support of the New Right, funda-
mentalist Christians, and a loose coalition of con-
servative idealists, the 1980s would witness the
reversal of many liberal social, political, and eco-
nomic forces as a conservative backlash targeted
the increasing availability of abortion, the spread
of pornography, and illegal drug use.
The economy was deep in recession in the late
1970s and early 1980s. Since the 1960s, wages had
been consistently on the rise, and union wages re-
mained high. But beginning in 1980, union workers
faced pay freezes and cuts for the first time in the mod-
ern era, and unemployment reached 10%. “Reaga-
nomics” was blamed by many critics for exacerbating
class and race tensions, the deterioration of the inner
cities, declining public education, and increased home-
lessness. By 1987, several million desperate and poor
Americans were homeless.
The Reagan and Bush administrations of the
1980s and early 1990s responded to the drug crisis by
boosting spending for law enforcement. Preparing for
a new blitzkrieg in the so-called drug war, the Reagan
administration doubled the FBI’s funding, and the
U.S. Bureau of Prisons was the benefactor of a 30%
increase in spending. Legal restraints were loosened on
police investigators as well, with federal wiretaps in-
creasing by more than 20% between 1981 and 1982.
Wiretapping dates back to the nineteenth century, when
individuals obtained information by intercepting tele-
graph messages, such as the California stockbroker who
was prosecuted in 1864 for violating a state statute
against obtaining stock market information in this man-
ner. The NYPD began tapping telephones as early as the
1890s. During Prohibition authorities commonly used this
tactic to collect evidence on bootleggers. In 1934 Con-
gress formally banned wiretapping with the Federal
Communications Act. However, the ban did not specifi-
cally prohibit federal agents from the “interception and
divulgence” of communications “transmitted by wire.”
Thus, federal agents continued to use wiretaps during
criminal investigations for several more years. During
World War II J. Edgar Hoover persuaded President
Franklin D. Roosevelt to allow his agency to use wiretap-
ping to go after national threats such as spies, subver-
sives, and saboteurs. Since the 1950s police have relied on
wiretaps to investigate clandestine criminal syndicates
and electronic surveillance figured prominently in almost
every organized crime prosecution since the late 1970s.

The get-tough policies of the 1980s led to
the hiring of more than 1,000 new DEA agents,
200 more district attorneys, and an unprecedented
reallocation of funds from drug treatment, research,
and prevention to law enforcement. By the late
1980s, the Reagan administration had announced
a “zero-tolerance” policy, leading to a record num-
ber of drug seizures, indictments, arrests, convic-
tions, and asset forfeitures.
Spurred on by fears of a crack cocaine epidemic
in the 1980s, the criminal justice system became
increasingly more punitive. During the late 1990s,
construction of a new jail or prison was completed
almost every week. Crack cocaine poisoned many
communities as dealers waged war against each
other over markets, leading to an upsurge in homi-
cides. However, by the end of the 1980s the worst
fears of urban America had failed to materialize as
the crack trade began to diminish. But the “crack
wars” made a lasting imprint on American criminal
justice, prompting the country to rewrite its drug
laws, shift money from schools to prisons, and lock
up a record number of people. The new harsh laws
did not reduce overall drug use in America.
According to a National Household Survey on
Drug Abuse conducted by the Department of
Health and Human Services, despite the limited
appeal of crack cocaine, a high percentage of pris-
oners serving time for drug offenses were incarcer-
ated for crack cocaine. Yet it is estimated that in
1997, 11 million Americans smoked marijuana,
1.5 million used powder cocaine, and 0.6 million
used crack. Incarceration rates tell another story.
More than 40% of drug offenders were in state
prisons for crack cocaine (26.6 in federal prisons),
33.4 for powder cocaine (42.1 in federal prisons),
and 12.9 for marijuana violations (18.9 in federal
prisons).2
The rising crime concerns of the 1980s led to a
change in sentencing laws throughout the country.
In 1984, Congress passed the Comprehensive Crime
Control Act, which created the United States Sen-
tencing Commission. Two years later, the commis-
sion announced that “the rehabilitation of a criminal
was of secondary importance to protecting the pub-
lic and that sentences should reflect the seriousness of
the crime committed.”3 This echoed a major transi-
tion from a rehabilitative model to a punitive one,
where there was little to confuse the purpose of
prison: punishment, not rehabilitation.
Public concern over crime and criminal justice
issues continues to dominate the national agendas of
politicians and pundits. Some observers suggest that
“media coverage of crime stories explains much of
the public’s interest in criminal justice, as well as the
limited extent of their knowledge of the criminal
justice system.”4 For most Americans, the percep-
tion of crime often conflicts with the reality of
crime statistics.
During the past 30 years, crime has surfaced as a
concern of the public, but not until the mid-1990s
did it register as the major concern of the public.
With the concomitant merging of news and enter-
tainment in the 1990s, an excellent opportunity was
created to manipulate and sensationalize crime con-
cerns as witnessed by a number of sensational trials
of the rich and famous.
TH E LAWGI VERS
During the 1980s, President Reagan took advan-
tage of his opportunity as chief executive to appoint
conservative-minded
justices
to
the
Supreme
Court. While the new court leadership did not
abandon the advances of the due process revolu-
tion, the Court became “more tolerant of police
behavior and less receptive to further expansion of
rights for criminal defendants.”5 Compared to the
1960s, subsequent rulings would lean toward the
prosecution.
In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled in Gates v.
Illinois that police could obtain a search warrant on
the basis of an anonymous tip rather than going
through an extensive investigation to corroborate
by independent sources the reliability of the tip
(as in Aguilar v. Texas, 1964). Another important
decision reflecting the new conservative bias of
the Court was United States v. Leon, which held
that the exclusionary rule did not apply to evidence
obtained by law enforcement who seized the evi-
dence using a warrant that was unsupported by

probable cause. In effect this allowed the police to
use warrants that contained factual errors and inad-
equate probable cause. According to one critic, this
decision “gave police a ‘good faith’ exception to the
‘exclusionary rule’ which requires that courts sup-
press or disregard illegally obtained evidence.”6
In 1981, Sandra Day O’Connor became the first
woman to be appointed to the Supreme Court.
Born in El Paso, Texas, in 1930, Sandra Day graduated
from the Stanford University Law School in 1950 (along
with William H. Rehnquist). Rebuffed in her attempts to
join major law firms in San Francisco, Day married and
raised three sons before opening her own law office in
Arizona. She would serve in the Arizona state senate be-
tween 1969 and 1974, when she was elected Superior
Court judge. Appointed by President Ronald Reagan to
the Supreme Court in 1981, during the 1980s and 1990s
O’Connor is credited with writing some of the most
significant decisions in the area of constitutional law.
Among her most important decisions was the case of
Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which she upheld Roe v.
Wade, which made a woman’s right to have an abortion
a constitutionally protected right in 1973. Resisting pres-
sure from her more conservative colleagues, she con-
vinced two of her more moderate colleagues to join her
in upholding the right to choose abortion. In July 2005
she announced she would retire as soon as her replace-
ment could be confirmed. O’Connor stepped down ef-
fective January 31, 2006, giving way to incoming justice
Samuel Alito. On August 12, 2009, she was awarded the
Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor
of the United States, by President Barack Obama.
Crime control measures had entered the politi-
cal debate in presidential elections during the 1960s
when
Republican
presidential
candidate
Barry
Goldwater ran on a platform that claimed that rising
crime rates were the product of misguided Demo-
cratic policies and that by electing Republican can-
didates, voters could reduce the rising tide of
violence and lawlessness. Republican candidates
for president continued to exploit the crime prob-
lem through the candidacies of Richard Nixon,
Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George
W. Bush. During George H. W. Bush’s successful
run for president in 1988, many observers credited
this campaign issue with helping then-Vice Presi-
dent Bush defeat Massachusetts Governor Michael
Dukakis after convicted felon Willie Horton, out
on a weekend furlough from a Massachusetts
prison, raped a woman and stabbed her fiancé.
The Death of Len Bias and
the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986
What often gets overlooked in the war on drugs of
the 1980s was the impact of the death of star Uni-
versity of Maryland basketball player Len Bias in
1986. Selected second (after some guy named
Michael Jordan) in the annual basketball draft by
the Boston Celtics on June 17, two days later he
was dead. The subsequent autopsy revealed he had
cocaine in his system and that it triggered fatal
cardiac arrhythmia. His death launched a nationwide
debate as to whether top college athletes were cod-
dled with special treatment. It also brought the dis-
cussion of drug abuse once more to the top of the
agenda for lawmakers. Speaker of the House Tip
O’Neill seized the incident to successfully lobby for
and win backing to introduce mandatory-minimum
sentences for drug offenders with the Anti-Drug
Abuse Act of 1986 (it also created the first laws
against money laundering). Federal mandatory drug
sentences were first passed in 1951. But these were
mostly repealed by federal law in 1970 after “exten-
sive and careful consideration.” The 1986 law man-
dated five years in prison with no parole for the sale
of 100 grams of heroin, 100 kilos of pot, or 10 grams
of methamphetamine. Its most controversial clause
was the five-year minimum for selling 5 grams of
crack cocaine or 500 grams of powder cocaine.
Two years later Congress designated crack cocaine
as the only drug requiring a mandatory-maximum
sentence on the first offense.7
According to one Justice Department study,
one out of every 20 Americans born in 1999 will
serve time in prison; an African American male had
a one in four chance compared with 0.8 for white
males. (Statistics indicate that these odds had been
more even at one time.) However, the get-tough
sentencing of the 1980s and the criminal justice
system’s special treatment of crack cocaine dramati-
cally altered the balance in the prison population.

America, unlike any other country at the time,
made no distinction between the properties of
crack and powder cocaine. Under federal law,
5 grams of crack (which is cocaine processed to be
smoked) was recognized as the equal to 500 grams
of cocaine, a 1-to-100 ratio. The possession of
5 grams of crack by statute was a felony, while
5 grams of the drug in powder form was a misde-
meanor, with rarely any jail time required. The dis-
parity was glaring as the century ended.
Mandatory Sentencing
Congress implemented more than 20 new manda-
tory sentencing laws between 1985 and 1991. By
1994, virtually every state had adopted at least some
form of mandatory sentencing legislation. These laws
typically applied to serious offenses, such as murder,
rape, and handgun crimes, but also applied to drunk
driving and drug offenses.8 Mandatory minimum
drug sentences came under increasing scrutiny by
critics because they take sentencing discretion from
the hands of the judges who in times past could con-
sider an offender’s life history, potential for rehabili-
tation, job status, and family responsibilities before
delivering sentence. As a result of this facet of the
war on drugs, the proportion of incarcerated drug
offenders increased, while that of violent offenders
decreased. Most alarming was the overrepresentation
of minorities due to disparities in drug sentencing.
In 1993, the refrain “Three strikes and you’re
out” became the rallying cry for get-tough politi-
cians. This phrase was coined in Washington State
after voters approved a ballot measure requiring life
sentences without the possibility of parole for third-
time serious felony offenders. Over the next few
years, more than a dozen states introduced similar
provisions. California introduced three-strikes legis-
lation that sentenced any adult convicted of a third
serious felony to prison from 25 years to life. Al-
though the intent of this legislation was to remove
vicious predators from the streets, these laws proved
somewhat misleading to a public enamored by get-
tough legislation. Initially federal three-strikes law
did not even distinguish between violent and non-
violent felons.
The three-strikes sentencing policy originated in California
after the abduction and murder of Polly Klaas in the early
1980s by a career criminal who had been in and out of
prison for most of his life. This high-profile case led to
harsher sentences for violent offenders for their second
offense and life without parole for their third offense.
The murder of Polly Klaas resonated throughout the
country. A young girl was snatched from her own bed-
room and brutally killed. This crime, according to legal
historian Lawrence M. Friedman, “was a powerful stimu-
lus to some draconian pieces of legislation.”9 Unfortu-
nately, as Friedman and others have noted, never have
television and the news media influenced criminal justice
policy as they do today.
Although California’s statute remained the most
austere, other states followed its example in subsequent
years. In 1994, New Jersey passed “Megan’s law” after
young Megan Kanka was raped and murdered by a
neighbor. Area residents had no idea that the perpetra-
tor who lived among them had two prior convictions for
sex offenses. Under the new law, on release from prison,
sex offenders were required to register with the police.
By 2000, 22 states even listed sex offender registries on
the Internet. Four years later 26 states and the federal
government had laws that mandated that a third felony
brought a life sentence, typically with no parole for
almost 25 years.
Despite the good intentions of three-strikes
legislation, defendants are less likely to plea bargain
(plead guilty) if they already have two felonies. One
of the unforeseen results has been an increase in the
number of defendants going to trial. As a result, an
already overburdened criminal justice system is
faced with a growing number of nonviolent crim-
inals facing their third strike in court. In previous
years, close to 90% of similar cases were handled
with plea bargains, saving the expense and time of
a trial. Unwilling to plead guilty, these defendants
wait in jail pending trials, further contributing to
overcrowded correctional facilities.
The Brady Handgun Bill
and Guns in America
As America approached the twenty-first century, it
continued to exhibit certain tendencies that distin-
guished it from other industrialized nations, such as
Germany, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom.
None was more glaring than the numbers of
CONTEMPORARY CRIMIN AL JUS TICE AT THE END OF TH E TWEN TIETH CEN TU RY (1980– 1999)

weapons in America. Despite a decline in murder
over the past decade, America continued to lead the
industrialized world in this category. An examina-
tion of American violence suggests that national vi-
olence patterns are rooted in the past. Nowhere is
this truer than in America’s love affair with guns. In
the 1980s and 1990s more than half the country’s
murders were committed with handguns.
The reported decline of the American handgun
industry in the 1990s offered perhaps a glimmer of
hope to gun control advocates for the reduction of
future handgun violence. The decline followed a
30-year period of growth fueled in part by the
threat of crime, civil unrest, and the violence asso-
ciated with the various dimensions of the illegal
drug trade, particularly the crack cocaine epidemic
of the 1980s. In 1998, handgun production plum-
meted to its lowest level in more than three dec-
ades. According to a 2001 report (that would prove
illusory), “The American handgun market has
dropped off so steeply that some industry experts
worry it may never recover.”10 Among the reasons
cited for the decline were tougher rules for pur-
chasing them, an already saturated market, and a
backlash from recent highly publicized schoolyard
and workplace murders.
Gun control was a hot topic between 1987 and
1993, as gun control advocates campaigned for an
enactment of a waiting period for handgun pur-
chases and the passage of what would become the
Brady Bill. The Brady Bill was named after James
Brady, Reagan’s former press secretary, who was
seriously injured in the assassination attempt on
the president in 1981. The bill was first introduced
in Congress in 1987 but was quickly challenged
by the National Rifle Association (NRA), which
argued that any handgun legislation would lead
only to stricter gun control. NRA spokespersons
claimed that the proposed law would not pre-
vent criminals from getting guns but merely in-
convenience legitimate purchasers. After several
unsuccessful attempts, the Brady Bill, imposing a
seven-day waiting period, was finally approved
by Congress in 1991. Although then President
George H. Bush opposed the bill, he agreed to
sign the measure if it included a five-business-day
waiting period in 1993. The Brady Handgun
Violence Prevention Act of 1993 emerged after a
lengthy debate in Congress.
The notion of having a waiting period for gun
buyers can be traced back to at least the 1930s,
when the District of Columbia enacted a 48-hour
waiting period for gun buyers. Gun control propo-
nents argued that a waiting period for gun pur-
chases was necessary to provide authorities time to
conduct a background check on the purchaser and
to void gun purchases by felons and the mentally
incompetent. Although the idea of a waiting period
seems moderate, it touched off a rancorous debate
between supporters and opponents.
According to the Brady Bill, handgun purchases
were to be rejected if the applicant had been
convicted of a crime that carried a sentence of at
least one year (not including misdemeanors). Others
prohibited included anyone with a violence-based
restraining order pending, persons convicted of do-
mestic abuse, those arrested for using or selling drugs,
fugitives from justice, anyone certified as mentally
unstable, and illegal aliens. In 1998, the five-day
waiting period was replaced by instant background
checks conducted by the FBI’s National Instant
Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The
jury is still out as to whether this measure has had
much impact on gun crime, but between 1994 and
2008 almost 1.8 million handgun sales were blocked
by Brady background checks by the FBI. In 2008
alone felons accounted for 56% of denied applica-
tions and fugitives from justice were 13% of denials.
Some advocates claim the legislation dissuaded some
potential gun buyers from purchasing weapons be-
cause of its requirement of background checks.
Others point out that many people buy guns for
security reasons and that, with the recent drop in
crime to a 33-year low, they are less inclined to go
gun shopping.
Another explanation for the drop in handgun
sales is the changing strategy of the gun control
lobby. Formerly, advocates of gun control focused
on lobbying politicians to pass stricter legislation. A
hot potato in any election, most politicians were
reluctant to join the fray. Thus, in the late 1990s,
champions of gun control set their sights on a new
310

target by suing various gun manufacturers. During
one three-year period more than 30 suits were filed
against gun makers and sellers by cities and govern-
ment committees nationwide. The lawsuits charged
gun makers with negligence for producing danger-
ous weapons that resulted in serious consequences
in the hands of children and criminals. As part of
their strategy, gun control proponents sought to hit
the gun manufacturers where it hurt most, in the
pocket, by seeking reimbursement for the high cost
of preventing gun violence and the enormous costs
of treating gunshot casualties in local trauma wards.
While some lawsuits were dismissed, the potential
for financial ruin still threatens the future of most
manufacturers. Focusing its historic trade on a mili-
tary
and
police
market,
the
venerable
Colt
Manufacturing chose to end its retail handgun sales
in 1999, largely because of potential lawsuits. In
2000, Smith & Wesson agreed to include safety
locks on all guns and to make significant changes
in its marketing campaign.11 Nonetheless, in April
2009 the FBI announced that it had completed its
100 millionth NICS approval since the advent of
the system almost a decade ago (coinciding with a
27.1 increase in firearms sales in the first quarter of
2009 over the previous year).12
The Insanity Defense and the Myth
of the “Twinkie Defense”
The insanity defense was prominent in several
high-profile murder cases in the late 1970s and early
1980s. None earned more publicity than that of
former policeman Dan White’s killings of San
Francisco Mayor George Moscone and city super-
visor and gay rights activist Harvey Milk in 1978.
This case became part of popular culture by intro-
ducing the “Twinkie defense” to the modern legal
lexicon. In this case it implied that White’s mental
capacity was diminished by his fondness for “junk
food.” White’s trial attracted wide media attention
not only for the novelty of the defense but also for
its volatile mix of politics, revenge, and homosexual
intolerance. White’s insanity defense led to two
verdicts of voluntary manslaughter, and after only
five years in prison, White was released in 1984.
The following year, he committed suicide. For
homosexuals, the trial became a battle cry in that
it seemed to them that the jury sanctioned gay mur-
der. Most felt that if White had killed only the
mayor, he would still be in jail.
Despite its association with the “Twinkie de-
fense” few people are aware that its centrality to the
trial is actually a myth. As journalist Carol Pogash
and others have demonstrated, Twinkies were only
mentioned in passing during the trial and “Junk
food was an insignificant part of the defense.”13 In
fact, the chief defense attorney for White admitted
it was “a throwaway witness … with a throwaway
line”14 and the case of the defense at the 1979 trial
mainly rested on claims of “diminished capacity”
and bouts of “mental illness” in which White’s con-
sumption of junk food was a symptom of his de-
pression and not a cause. Most of those familiar
with the trial either as observers or participants
blamed the news media for inventing the “Twinkie
defense.” Perhaps UC Berkeley professor of an-
thropology and folklore Dr. Alan Dundes said it
best when he noted that “America loves labels.”15
In 1982, another celebrated crime challenged the
foundations of the insanity defense. On March 30,
1981, John Hinckley Jr. fired six shots at President
Ronald Reagan and members of his staff as they en-
tered the Washington Hilton Hotel. Several people
were hit, including the president, Press Secretary
James Brady, a police officer, and a Secret Service
agent. Hinckley was quickly arrested and charged
with attempted murder.
Testimony during the 1982 trial escalated into
a battle between medical opinions. Almost imme-
diately, the defense team entered a plea of not
guilty by reason of insanity. What would soon shift
the outcome of the trial toward the defendant was
the judge’s decision to hear the case under federal
procedural rules, which meant that the prosecution
would bear the burden of proving Hinckley’s sanity
beyond a reasonable doubt. If the case had been
tried under local rule, the defense attorneys would
have borne the pressure of having to prove their
client insane. In June 1982, after listening to hours
of confusing and contradictory testimony, the jurors
brought back a verdict of not guilty by reason of

insanity. Although Hinckley was committed to a
mental institution, the verdict stimulated a vocifer-
ous debate over the insanity defense.
The Anti-Terrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act
In the aftermath of the Centennial Park bombing
during the Atlanta Olympics and the suspicious ex-
plosion of TWA Flight 800 (which later proved to
be an accident) off the coast of Long Island, New
York, the U.S. Congress passed the 1996 Anti-
Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which
one leading expert noted was the country’s “first
comprehensive
counterterrorism
legislation.”16
The goal of the legislation was “to regulate activity
that could be used to mount a terrorist attack, pro-
vide resources for counterterrorist programs and
punish terrorism.” Its provisions included a federal
death penalty for deaths that resulted from acts of
terrorism, added funding for terrorism prevention
and counterterrorism, prohibitions against the gov-
ernment or business transactions with terrorist
states, as well as granting the secretary of state the
power to designate private groups as terrorist orga-
nizations, which would forbid them from raising
funds in America.
LAW ENFORCEMENT
Women and minorities continued to make inroads
on police forces in ever-increasing numbers. By the
early 1980s, women would make up more than
5.5% of sworn officers nationwide.17 Over the
next decade, the portrait of the typical police officer
had changed substantially. Most studies credit “the
women’s movement and laws barring employment
discrimination based on sex” for a quadrupling of
the number of female sworn officers between 1972
and 1986.18 The number of racial minority peace
officers increased as well. By the end of the 1980s,
major American cities boasted African American
police chiefs, including New York City, Atlanta,
Chicago, and Houston.
During the 1980s, police forces made con-
certed efforts to improve their tarnished image
and relations with the communities they served.
Among the public relations strategies toward this
end were crime prevention programs that in-
structed communities how to protect themselves
and initiating identification programs so that resi-
dents could mark their possessions for future iden-
tification.
Many
communities
also
established
“neighborhood watch” programs that encouraged
citizen cooperation with the police.
Attempts at improving the often rancorous re-
lationships between police departments and the
communities they served were widely heralded in
the 1980s. Better police–community relations were
given a high priority by most departments, particu-
larly after the publication of George Kelling and
James Q. Wilson’s widely read Atlantic Monthly ar-
ticle in 1982, “Broken Windows: The Police and
Neighborhood Safety,” in which the authors artic-
ulated a vision for improving police relations in the
community, using what the two justice policy ex-
perts called the “broken-windows model.”
According to the broken-windows model of
policing, neighborhood disorder creates fear, and
neighborhoods give out crime-promoting signals,
such as broken windows and deteriorated housing.
An increase in the physical deterioration of a neigh-
borhood then leads to increased concern for per-
sonal safety among local residents. Offenders often
target these neighborhoods because they see certain
signs that translate to vulnerability. Police, then,
need the cooperation of citizens if they intend to
reduce fear and successfully fight crime in these
environments.
The endorsement of “broken windows” by
many police administrators represented a major
step toward enlisting communities in the war
against crime by theoretically reverting back to an
earlier historical model of policing. Since the Pro-
gressive era, August Vollmer, and the introduction
of the police car, proponents of “broken windows”
claim that the patrol officer has been increasingly
removed from the mainstream of the community.
Rather than encouraging citizen confidence and
cooperation, generally the reverse was occurring.
312

While police cars maintained a presence, ensured
rapid response to a crime scene, and covered a
wider area, they also alienated many community
members who might otherwise help the police.
In the 1980s, some urban police departments
returned to an earlier style when police walked a
beat or foot patrol and maintained intimate contact
with the area they served. The implementation of
community policing took officers out of patrol cars
and put them on a walking beat to strengthen ties
to the community. Although early studies indicated
that foot patrols did not decrease the crime rate,
residents who lived in these areas reported they
were less afraid of crime and felt safer.
However, some observers believed that commu-
nity policing was anything but new. Police and crimi-
nal justice historian Samuel Walker has suggested that
the authors of the “broken-windows” thesis “have
misinterpreted police history in several important re-
spects,” while former San Jose Police Chief Joseph
McNamara added that “the good old days [of polic-
ing] weren’t all that good.”19 Walker, McNamara,
and others argued that although modern police de-
partments and officials claimed to be returning to an
earlier “watchman style of policing,” this style was
“inefficient and corrupt” and did “not involve any
conscious purpose to serve neighborhood needs.” Ac-
cording to Walker, “There is no older tradition wor-
thy of restoration.”20 Reaching back in time using a
historical analysis, historians such as Walker have been
able to demonstrate that “depersonalization” of polic-
ing has been “greatly exaggerated.” The introduction
of the squad car may have isolated police to a certain
extent, but other technological advances, such as the
telephone, allowed more private contact between re-
sidents and police who were called in to mediate per-
sonal disputes more than ever.
A reflection of the conservative mood of the
country, the New York City Police Department un-
der Mayor Rudolph Giuliani embarked on a cam-
paign to take illegal handguns off the streets in the
mid-1990s. Although civil liberties groups claimed
that the police targeted minority group members
with “street justice tactics,” new police strategies
were credited with helping to reduce violent crime
in New York City in the 1990s.
Targeting certain precincts where gun violence
was high, the police department saturated the area
with plainclothes officers and detectives using what
was referred to as “flood and frisk tactics” and fol-
lowed by uniformed officers flooded into the an-
ointed “hot zone.” Looking for any legal excuse to
stop and question suspected drug dealers or suspi-
cious drivers, officers frisked individuals, hoping to
find illegal guns or contraband. While only a few
guns were taken off the streets, the aggressive police
presence convinced many to keep their guns at
home and off the streets.
Many police departments retooled for the
1990s, including New York City, which added
thousands of police officers to the force. At the
end of 1996, 37,871 police officers served New
York City’s 7.3 million residents, a ratio of one
for every 193 citizens.21
Although there is little evidence that having
officers live where they work makes any difference
in the quality of policing, in the late 1990s police
residency requirements became an issue. According
to figures released in early 1999, only 54% of New
York City’s police force lived in the city (down
from 60% the previous decade). Following the
botched shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
West African street vendor, community advocates
intensified calls for a residency requirement after it
was revealed that two of the four officers did not
live in the city. Mr. Diallo was the target of 41
bullets as he stood unarmed in the vestibule of his
Bronx apartment. In another case, Haitian immi-
grant Abner Louima was sodomized with a broken
broomstick in the bathroom of a police precinct
house, suffering internal injuries. Two police offi-
cers were convicted for the assault, and four others
were found guilty of obstructing justice during an
attempted cover-up. Almost four years after being
tortured by police at a Brooklyn police station,
Louima agreed to settle his lawsuit with the city
and its main police union for $8.75 million and
promises of several reforms in police practices. It
was reportedly the most money the city has ever
had to pay in a police brutality case. It was also
the first time that the Policemen’s Benevolent As-
sociation has ever paid money to settle a claim

against it. Among the departmental policy reforms
were changes in the “48-hour rule,” which allowed
officers suspected of infractions to wait two days
before answering questions from supervisors.
While community leaders and civil libertarians
are quick to suggest that residency requirements
would familiarize officers with the environment
they serve and might prevent replays of the Louima
and Diallo tragedies, others argue there is no empiri-
cal evidence to back up this contention. Nevertheless,
police and city officials quickly embarked on a hiring
campaign to lure more New Yorkers to the force in
hopes that it would lead to more racial diversity.
Residency requirements for city workers origi-
nated in the nineteenth century when local ward
bosses hired public employees, including policemen
and firefighters. Their residency ensured ward bosses
that they would be continually elected. Policemen
were also used to collect bribes and protection dollars
for the ward bosses. By the twentieth century Pro-
gressive reformers recognized that residency require-
ment often coincided with corruption and machine
politics and targeted the requirement for extinction.
In the 1960s only a handful of large cities required
residency, but the subsequent advent of the commu-
nity policing movement in the 1980s encouraged po-
lice to reside near or in the communities they served.
In recent years the number of police depart-
ments requiring residency had dramatically de-
creased. Police officers who oppose the residency
requirement point to quality-of-life issues such as
affordability and safe neighborhoods. Police unions
oppose residency requirements because they can im-
pede an officer’s promotion opportunities. In a po-
lice hierarchy there is little room for advancement
unless one is willing to move to another department,
and residency requirements make this impractical.
Community Policing at the End
of the Twentieth Century
By 2001, most major police departments had
adopted the “community-based” policing philo-
sophy, demonstrating “a fundamental shift from tra-
ditional reactive policing” to a more proactive
approach. Between 1997 and 1999, the percentage
of police departments using routine foot patrols
increased from 28 to 34, according to a 2000 De-
partment of Justice report. In 1999, more than two-
thirds of departments across the country had some
type of community-based police program compared
to just 34% in 1997. The number of officers desig-
nated as community police climbed from more than
20,000 in 1997 to 113,000 in 1999. This crime-
fighting philosophy, which came to prominence in
the 1980s, typically utilizes foot and bicycle patrols as
it attempts to involve local communities in making
their neighborhoods more secure.
Except for anecdotal evidence, experts caution
that
it
is
difficult
to
measure
how
effective
community-based policing has been. By the begin-
ning of 2001, almost 12,000 law enforcement agencies
across the nation had applied for federal grants to im-
plement some form of community-oriented policing.
According to Katherine Beckett and Theodore
Sasson, several new developments in policing, includ-
ing proactive problem-oriented policing and zero-
tolerance strategies, may “further reduce the potential
democratizing impact of community policing.”22 De-
spite a movement from reactive to proactive policing,
there is little evidence that the new policy is respon-
sible for suppressing criminal activity.
Civil libertarians and police critics cite the
emergence of paramilitary SWAT teams in police
departments across the nation as an alarming depar-
ture from the community policing model. Sup-
ported by federal grants and asset forfeiture laws,
these units were initially aimed at the drug trade.
The NYPD, Bratton, Maple,
and Compstat: Challenging
“Broken Windows”
No police strategy was more influential in the 1980s
and 1990s than the “broken-windows” thesis es-
poused by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling.
Following a significant drop in serious crimes in many
American cities during the 1990s, a number of scholars
began to reexamine and challenge the crime reduction
phenomenon in cities such as New York as a result of
the broken-windows thesis.

New York City has been used as the “poster
child” by broken-windows advocates. Few could
argue that the crime decline in the city was almost
unprecedented over the past 20 years; however,
there is little consensus as to why it occurred. Un-
der the leadership of New York City Police Chief
William Bratton, police activities were directed at
“order maintenance,” an often-aggressive crusade
against a legion of minor offenders such as pan-
handlers, squeegee men, and jaywalkers. But skep-
tics argue that the crime drop was the result of a
more complicated set of circumstances.
In the early 1990s, criminologist George Kelling
convinced Bratton to apply the broken-windows con-
cept to New York’s massive transit system. Following
the high-profile murder of a Utah tourist in the New
York subway, the Transit Police was given $40 million
to improve its performance. In his autobiography,
Bratton credited this killing with providing the catalyst
for causing a turnaround in the crime rate in New
York City. While chief of the transit police, Bratton
applied the thesis to fighting crime in the subways.
Bratton redesigned transit uniforms, renovated and up-
graded the Transit Police Academy, introduced better
weapons and communications equipment, and im-
proved morale on the force. After identifying fare eva-
sion as the most widespread problem, Bratton stationed
police at strategic points to capture turnstile jumpers.
Many of those arrested carried concealed illegal weap-
ons, so in the process of arresting minor offenders, they
might have been preventing more serious offenses by
confiscating weapons. Many erstwhile criminals prob-
ably began leaving their weapons at home. In any case,
subway crime plummeted.
Selected as police commissioner in 1993, Bratton
took credit for reducing felonies by almost 30% by
combining the computerized tracking of crime hot
spots with a “quality-of-life initiative” that targeted
disorderly behavior, street prostitution, panhan-
dling, and other unsolicited behaviors. Another
crime control initiative involved determining the
origin of every gun used in a crime, whereby ev-
ery handgun suspect was interviewed by a detec-
tive. Teaming with his executive assistant, Jack
Maple, Bratton took the handcuffs off police offi-
cers and used civil law and the broken-windows
strategy to enforce regulations against harassment,
assault, disorderly conduct, and vandalism.
Bratton, Maple, and his dream team created the
Compstat system, a combination of computer statistics
analysis and an unrelenting demand for accountability.
As Bratton’s chief strategist, Jack Maple introduced a
groundbreaking computerized map system that was
given the moniker Compstat, short for “computer
statistics.” Maple demanded that every precinct map
out shootings, gun arrests, and narcotics violations to
more accurately deploy police officers. As New York
City enjoyed its historic crime drop, other large cities
adopted Maple’s strategies, which hinged on accurate
and timely intelligence, rapid deployment, effective
tactics, and relentless follow-up and assessment.
As academics reconsider “broken windows,” a
growing number of authorities are questioning its
most crucial assumptions. One political scientist even
argues that the “zero-tolerance” panacea in New
York City that led to arrests for even the most mini-
mal violations “clogged up municipal courts and
sapped judicial resources.” Still others would suggest
that it is too simple to blame all crime on urban decay
when there is “rather a constellation of only loosely
connected, somewhat separate problems that may re-
quire somewhat unique policy responses.”23
At the same time that New York was enjoying
its success, other cities enjoyed similar crime drops
using alternative strategies. According to Eli B.
Silverman, in cities such as San Diego, the real turn-
around is credited to “more intelligent policing.”24
Although there are still critics of “broken-windows
policing,” most polls indicate that New Yorkers
strongly supported the enforcement of quality-
of-life laws. According to a July 2001 poll by the
Citizens Crime Commission, a nonprofit research
organization, support varied little between African
Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, and whites.
Federal Law Enforcement
During the 1980s and 1990s, the FBI turned its
focus to a number of new militant antigovernment
groups. Domestic in origin, militia groups popped
up throughout America’s heartland. It was not until
1985 that the FBI targeted specific groups, when

the white supremacist group known as The Order
committed a string of violent bank robberies to fi-
nance future activities. During the 1990s, the FBI
came under heavy criticism for its mishandling of
several high-profile standoffs.
The confrontation between federal agents and
the Randy Weaver family in Ruby Ridge, Idaho,
in 1992 led to public condemnation and debate
over the abuse of federal power. What is lost in
much of the controversy was the connection be-
tween this incident and the ongoing federal cam-
paign against The Order in its stronghold in the
Northwest. Randy Weaver came to the attention
of federal agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms (ATF) when he sold illegal sawed-off
shotguns to an ATF informant. In January 1991,
Weaver was arrested on gun charges in Idaho. Post-
ing bond, Weaver retreated to his mountain cabin,
where he held out with his wife and three children,
ignoring a failure to appear warrant.
Fearing impending arrest and the possibility of
losing their home, the Weavers became increasingly
militant during the 18-month standoff. In August
1992, a U.S. marshal was killed during an exchange
of gunfire, signaling an escalation of the tension. The
following day, an FBI sniper killed Weaver’s wife and
wounded a houseguest. Soon after, Randy Weaver
was persuaded to surrender. The siege at Ruby Ridge
had major ramifications for federal law enforcement
fighting domestic terrorism in the twentieth century.
According to one writer, “The distinguishable fea-
tures of the American right were becoming blurred,”
and “in time it would allow anti-government senti-
ment to become nationalized, thus gaining a larger
and more moderate constituency.”25
A young cult leader named David Koresh
tested federal agents in Waco, Texas, the following
year. The handling of the initial raid on the Branch
Davidian compound by the FBI led once more to
questions about the judgment of the FBI. The FBI
took over after the efforts by the ATF failed, lead-
ing to one of the longest standoffs in law enforce-
ment history. After trying for 51 days to convince
Branch Davidian members to peacefully withdraw
from their sanctuary, the FBI stormed the com-
pound with the aid of tanks and tear gas. The entire
facility was almost immediately consumed by fire,
leading to the deaths of 85 men, women, and
children.
Subsequent congressional hearings in 1995 wit-
nessed FBI director Louis J. Freeh admitting to “se-
rious deficiencies in the FBI’s performance during
the crisis.” Further investigation found the opera-
tion to be flawed and a violation of FBI policy and
the Constitution. Following this episode, the FBI
director promised to revise the agency’s deadly-
force policy and to limit the use of the rules of
engagement. With the lessons gleaned from Ruby
Ridge and Waco, the FBI peacefully negotiated a
lengthy standoff with a “patriot group” called the
Freemen in 1996.
Fifty years ago, the FBI introduced its Ten
Most Wanted List. Long considered a publicity
gimmick rather than a measure of criminal menace,
the list does chronicle the changing nature of
American crime over the past half-century. In the
past, bank robbers, serial killers, and campus radicals
dominated the list in various time periods. The cur-
rent list reflects contemporary concerns over the
globalization of crime, the drug wars, and domestic
terrorism. In 1999, Osama bin Laden, suspected of
masterminding two deadly embassy bombings the
previous year, was added to the list, where he
joined Eric Rudolph (since captured), implicated
in several bombings that included an Alabama abor-
tion clinic and the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Of the
458 men and women who have graced FBI Most
Wanted Lists over the past 50 years, 429 have been
apprehended, 134 of them with the help of private
citizens. Where formerly the radio and newspapers
primed the FBI’s publicity machine, citizens can
now find 24-hour descriptions of wanted fugitives
on the Internet, which sometimes includes home
movies of the fugitives showing undisguisable man-
nerisms, accents, and idiosyncrasies.
The Brave New World
of Forensic Science
Forensic science technology became increasingly re-
liable during the past two decades. While the best-
known identification techniques include DNA and
316

fingerprint analysis, new methods were developed
that allowed investigators to use retinal scanning,
voiceprinting, and chromatography (the analysis of
certain chemicals contained in an individual’s saliva).
The use of computers has greatly enhanced the abil-
ity of investigators to sort and process mountains of
evidence that would be inaccessible without com-
puter databases.
Other suggestions for improving criminal iden-
tification systems include recommendations to re-
quire individuals accused of telephone offenses
involving threats, ransom demands, and nuisance
calls to have their voiceprints recorded at the same
time they are fingerprinted. As part of standard
post-trial processing, some states already require
criminals to give blood or saliva samples for possible
DNA profiling. No matter what identification in-
novations crime investigators introduce to crime
fighting, there is a strong public fear that these tech-
niques could threaten civil liberties or implicate in-
nocent individuals because of errors in taking
samples or record keeping.
In April 2000, Texas, with perhaps 3,500
unsolved cases of serial murder, began experiment-
ing with new computer software that targeted
serial killers. Similar to psychological profiling in
which details of crime scenes are used by experts
to make predictions about the emotional and intel-
lectual characteristics of offenders, the new geo-
graphic profiling uses computer software programs
to disseminate the particulars of crimes and pin-
point the most likely residence or workplace of
perpetrators.26
Brain “fingerprinting” is one of the latest tools
being tested by law enforcement. One of the latest
advances in computer-based technology, it allows
investigators to identify or acquit subjects on the
basis of measuring brain-wave responses to crime-
related pictures or words presented on a computer
screen. Invented by Dr. Larry Farwell, this inno-
vation is grounded in the pretext that the brain
permanently records information, including infor-
mation related to criminal activity. Through accu-
rate training and technology, brain fingerprinting
can retrieve memories stored in the brain. Unlike
a polygraph, brain fingerprinting does not look for
the distinction between truth and lies but only in-
dicates whether an individual has information re-
lated to a specific crime. In one of the first tests of
this technology, the FBI and then the U.S. Navy
found a 100% accuracy rate in its employment.27
Fingerprinting Evidence Under Fire
In the summer of 2001, more than 400 delegates
from 26 countries gathered in London to celebrate
the
centennial
of
Scotland
Yard’s
fingerprint
bureau. Officials claimed that they solved 10,000
cases the previous year using fingerprint evidence.
Although Argentina opened the first such branch in
1892, Scotland Yard was more influential in spark-
ing the adoption of fingerprinting in English-
speaking countries.
Beginning in 1911, when American courts first
allowed fingerprint evidence, for most of the twen-
tieth century fingerprinting remained one of the
standard methods of criminal identification. At the
turn of the century, some authorities were specu-
lating that in the next few decades its use will be
superseded by DNA identification.
Fingerprint evidence has been facing more and
more court challenges in recent years. Beginning
with the 1993 Supreme Court decision of Daubert v.
Merrell Dow, judges were required to take a more active
role in determining what scientific evidence is admissi-
ble in court. According to the “Daubert” guidelines,
new questions would be answered before fingerprints
could be entered into evidence. By this decision, the
Court introduced five criteria that had to be met before
evidence could be considered scientific: (1) peer review
and sound methodology, (2) a known error rate,
(3) testable hypotheses, (4) application outside of legal
proceedings, and (5) general acceptance.28
As one forensic scientist noted at the recent
London conference, “Twins have the same DNA,
but different fingerprints.” But one of the main
challenges to fingerprinting lies in the fact that there
is a lack of universal standards for comparing prints.
This has led to several mismatches of partial finger-
prints. Regardless of the continuing controversy,
the science of fingerprinting has held up to scrutiny.
But as one expert has suggested, “The relevant

question isn’t whether fingerprints could ever be
exactly alike—it’s whether they are ever similar en-
ough to fool a fingerprint examiner. And the an-
swer is yes.”29 What worries police and prosecutors
is that recent challenges to fingerprinting could also
undermine ballistics and handwriting tests and other
evidence. Law professor Michael Saks of Arizona
State University probably summed up the dilemma
of forensic scientists best, commenting that “courts
are forcing forensic science to become science—to
actually test its claims, determine its error rates, and
not overstate conclusions.”30
CORRECTIONS
Between 1970 and 1980, the population of Amer-
ica’s prisons doubled. By the time they doubled
once more between 1981 and 1995, American pris-
ons and jails held 1.75 million inmates. With a rate
of imprisonment of 426 per 100,000 in 1991,
America had one of the highest rates of incarcera-
tion in the world and the highest in its brief his-
tory.31 Unlike the 1970s, which saw a marked
increase in crime rates, the 1980s and 1990s saw
only periodic increases in crime (1985–1990), never
reaching the heights of the previous decade. But
prison populations continued to soar at record le-
vels. Rates of incarceration continued to vary by
region, with the South imprisoning more people
per capita than any other region.
While blacks made up only 12% of the na-
tion’s population, they represented more than
44% of the total local, state, and federal prison
population. According to one authority, America’s
black incarceration rate was “more than 4.2 [times]
higher than South Africa’s before the fall of
Apartheid.”32 By the middle of 1994, the number
of black inmates exceeded whites for the first time,
with almost 7% of all black men in prison or jail
compared to less than 1% of the white male
population.33
When considering the racial disparity of Amer-
ica’s prisons, there are other implications to consider.
A substantial number of African Americans are dis-
enfranchised since many states prohibit convicted
felons from voting. Together with the fact that the
imprisoned are universally prevented from voting,
this is a large voting bloc that has effectively lost its
political voice.
By the 1990s, the federal prison system had
kept pace with rising crime rates and the expanding
state prison systems. In previous eras, federal crimi-
nal law targeted violators of the Mann Act, boot-
leggers, and the interstate transportation of stolen
motor vehicles. In the 1990s, more than 60% of
federal prisoners were convicted for drug offenses.
Except for the “dot-com” explosion at the end
of the twentieth century, no business flourished to
the extent of the prison business. In former days,
prison construction was a tough sell to communi-
ties. With a downward turn in the economy in the
1980s, communities were less reluctant to host such
enterprises. By the middle of the 1990s, more than
5,000 correctional facilities dotted the landscape,
including more than 3,000 local jails. In rural
America, towns even competed for prison con-
struction. There was no greater job security than
working for a prison. Unlike General Motors or a
military base, there was no threat of closure or
moving south of the border.
Since the 1970s, correction officers have fol-
lowed their police counterparts who in the 1960s
formed labor unions. The unionization of correc-
tions has coincided with the unprecedented expan-
sion of the prison system. Other segments of the
working force have benefited from prison expan-
sion, including legions of building contractors, ar-
chitects, hardware and electronics companies, and
security firms.
By the end of the 1990s, California was operat-
ing the nation’s largest prison system with a budget of
almost $4 billion a year. The state added 21 prisons
between 1984 and 1999. But many politicians worry
that this building boom was at the expense of other
budget items, such as higher education. While salaries
remained stagnant in the state’s university system
(average pay for a first-year professor was $41,000),
prison guards were making $51,000 per year.
By the 1980s, it became clear to most correc-
tional authorities that the rehabilitative model of
corrections was a failure, citing high rates of

recidivism. Thus, a new policy of warehousing
serious offenders to protect society gained increas-
ing popularity as deinstitutionalization initiatives
soon fell by the wayside. As a consequence of the
new “lock-’em-up” strategy, American prisons be-
came seriously overcrowded. Between 1980 and
1999, the state and federal prison populations tri-
pled in size from 329,000 to more than 1.2 million
inmates. Beginning in 1990, a major program of
prison expansion was implemented that helped
reduce some of the overcrowding by the end of
the 1990s. Among the biggest administrative diffi-
culties caused by warehousing of prisoners are the
extreme expense and the unmanageability of prison
populations.
At the close of the twentieth century, the
number of adults either incarcerated, on parole, or
on probation reached a record high of 6.49 million,
or 1 in 32 American adults. While this was the bad
news, the good news was that the percentage in-
crease from 1999 to 2000 was only half the annual
average rate since 1990.
Following on the heels of three decades of
prison building and tougher sentencing laws, at
the beginning of 2002 a number of states were
forced by budget deficits to close some prisons,
lay off guards, or even shorten prison sentences.
In January alone, the states of Ohio, Michigan,
and Illinois closed prisons. Washington was among
the states experimenting with shortening sentences
for nonviolent crimes to relieve the overburdened
correctional system.
One of the leaders of the prison-building boom
was California. However, the state was a victim of
its own policies and was forced to shut down five
small privately operated minimum-security prisons
and to consider amending the state’s three-strikes
sentencing law to relieve congestion.
Close to 2.5 million people were released on
probation or parole in 2000. In 1990, half of all
parolees successfully completed the terms of their
release. Ten years later, only 43% completed parole
and stayed out through the end of the year. As of
late 2001, Georgia (6.8%) and Texas (5%) were the
states with the largest percentage of their adult pop-
ulation in the corrections system.34
Truth-in-Sentencing and the
Prison Building Boom
The passage of the 1994 Crime Bill was heralded by
the Clinton administration for funding 100,000 new
police officers. However, to get the bill passed, the
White House and Congressional Democrats had to
accept the Republican bid for $10 billion to finance
state prison construction between 1995 and 2000. The
catch was that the funding would only be made avail-
able to states that passed truth-in-sentencing laws that
eliminated most “good time” provisions and required
convicted offenders to serve 85% of their prison sen-
tence. According to one criminologist, the effects
were felt almost immediately as the number of states
with truth-in-sentencing laws increased from 4 in
1992 to 17 in 1995 and 27 in 1998. The crime bill
thus increased prison populations, making it cheaper
for states to build prisons. Between 1994 and 2005
state prison populations increased by 372,000 (if not
for the truth-in-sentencing proviso it would only have
increased by 305,000).35
Prison Privatization
The 1980s witnessed an increase in both prison
populations and prison labor. To reduce some of
the costs of warehousing inmates, prisons increas-
ingly turned to the private sector. Between 1985
and 1995, private prisons increased at a 500% clip.
By the mid-1990s, at least 30 states were contracting
out prison labor to private companies. Returning to
developments of a previous century, there was a
movement to deregulate prison industry so that
prison-made items could be sold on the free market.
In 1979, Congress authorized the hiring of
prisoners by private employers after years of prohi-
biting this arrangement. With “the growth of pri-
vatization and anti-government and anti-union
sentiments” in the 1990s, “the appeal of prison as
a source of cheap labor”36 led to a variety of privat-
ization models. In some cases, private companies
built and operated prisons and jails on behalf of
various branches of the government, while others
leased prisons to the government to be run by the
department of corrections. Often paid less than the

minimum wage, inmates performed a multitude of
tasks, including packing golf balls for Spalding, sort-
ing inventory for Toys R Us, and manufacturing
uniforms for McDonald’s. While unions and civil
rights organizations have lobbied against the privat-
ization of prisons, few critics of human rights viola-
tions overseas have made the connection with the
use of American prison labor at home.37
With unemployment at a record low during the
1990s and with more Americans than ever behind
bars, the number of prisoners working in the private
sector has doubled since 1995. In sharp contrast with
traditional prison labor, such as making license plates
and painting school buses, the 1990s saw prisoners
working in telemarketing and the computer indus-
try. By the end of the first quarter of 2000, more
than 80,000 inmates were employed at traditional
jobs, working for companies and governments at
anywhere from 25 cents to seven dollars per hour.38
While criminal justice officials see these pro-
grams as a path to reform and employers appreciate
the cheap labor, there are others who would insist
that prison labor is a human rights abuse and a
potential economic threat to free-world workers.
According to one California lawsuit, since prisoners
have no bargaining power, they can be easily
exploited. The verdict is still out on prison labor
programs, but most law enforcement authorities
and small businesspeople see it as a panacea for
the current labor shortage and the swelling prison
populations, which reached two million in 2000.
Supermax Prisons
One trend that continued to draw support was the
construction of super-maximum security, or “super-
max,” prisons in the 1990s. Although the federal gov-
ernment opened its first maximum-security prison at
Alcatraz in 1934, it was not until 1994 that the Federal
Bureau of Prisons opened its first supermax prison at
Florence, Colorado. It has housed criminal luminaries
ranging from Oklahoma City bomber Timothy
McVeigh and “Unabomber” Theodore Kaczynski to
World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef (all in the
same wing). It is estimated that one-fourth of the 387
inmates have killed or attempted to kill a prisoner.
Prison rights advocates have criticized these
solitary confinement prisons as inhumane, much
in the way Charles Dickens attacked Eastern State
Penitentiary in the 1840s. At supermax prisons,
inmates spend almost 23 hours per day confined in
7-by-12-foot cells. One critic suggests that there
was barely room to hold a sports-utility vehicle in
one of these cells. Every cell contained a stool, a
writing desk, and a mattress pedestal made of con-
crete (to prevent weapon making). At least 36 states
operate such institutions, where prisoners can squint
through a 4-foot-by-4-inch vertical window at the
exercise yard below or at a sky crisscrossed by steel
beams and helicopter-resistant wires. Some prisons
prohibit cigarettes and television.
Much in the vein of the “mark system,” bad
behavior “gets you in,” and good behavior “will get
you out.” Good behavior can win a “program out”
to a traditional penitentiary in three years as prison-
ers advance through various stages where they are
rewarded with more time out of the cell and other
perks.
The evolution of supermax prisons began with prison
authorities first developing procedures to minimize con-
tact between staff and prisoners. Other measures fol-
lowed, including “locking down” entire prisons for
indeterminate periods, thereby leaving prisoners in their
cells 24/7, making communal dining halls and exercise
yards redundant. California opened two of its best
known supermax prisons at Corcoran State Prison in 1988
and Pelican Bay in 1989 (giving the state four). Both of
these institutions have been cited for inhumane condi-
tions. Corcoran staff members were charged with staging
“gladiator” matches between rival gang members; at
Pelican Bay they were charged with subjecting inmates to
sensory deprivation. In 1994 the federal prison system
added a supermax facility in Florence, Colorado. By 2002
more than 42,000 prisoners were housed in these units,
with 8,000 in California alone. These facilities continue to
be at the center of debate over what is “cruel and un-
usual” punishment. Typically meals are served through a
slot in a steel wall and prisoners are shackled when
leaving the cell. The cells themselves measured 7.5 feet
by 11 feet. Despite claims that these facilities serve
as a deterrent and reduce violence in the general
population by removing troublesome inmates, other
studies suggest they lead to a high rate of mental illness
among inmates.

Juvenile Corrections
By the end of the 1990s, the treatment of juvenile
offenders by the correctional system signaled a back-
lash against the century-old notion of viewing chil-
dren and adolescents as less censurable and more
redeemable through rehabilitation than adults. A
harsher view of child criminals has emerged in which
they are barely distinguishable from their more adult
counterparts. Over the past nine years, 45 states have
passed legislation making it easier to prosecute juve-
niles as adults. Motivated by high-profile crimes com-
mitted by juvenile offenders, such as recent schoolyard
massacres, 15 states now allow prosecutors to transfer
juveniles from the juvenile system into adult courts for
certain categories of crime, most often violent offenses.
There is no consensus as to what constitutes adulthood
today. Children as young as 10 can be prosecuted as
adults in Vermont and Kansas, while most other states
have set the bar at 14 and older. Between 1985 and
1997, the number of youths under the age of 18 in
adult prisons more than doubled.
According to a 2001 American Bar Association
(ABA) study, young girls were being arrested and jailed
in record numbers, and the current juvenile justice sys-
tem is unable to handle the special needs of young girls.
While juvenile crime has fallen overall, the fastest-
growing segment of the juvenile justice population
are girls under the age of 18. Between 1988 and
1997, delinquency cases involving white girls rose
74% compared to a 106% increase for African Ameri-
can girls. In the wake of its findings, the ABA has re-
commended that communities develop alternatives to
detention and incarceration for minor offenses. The
ABA report suggests that girls are detained for less seri-
ous offenses than boys and are more likely to be de-
tained for minor offenses, such as public disorder, traffic
offenses, and probation violations. Other explanations
for this trend target get-tough mandatory sentencing,
changes in police practice for domestic violence, and
relabeling family conflicts as violent offenses.
Faith-Based Initiatives
Almost two years before the 2000 presidential elec-
tion, several prominent conservatives that included
“Reagan-era” criminologist James Q. Wilson, former
drug czar William Bennett, and future director of
faith-based (FB) initiatives John DiIulio (he resigned
due to political use of the program and related inter-
ference) met privately with the prospective candidate
George W. Bush to develop a “faith-based agenda.”
Several weeks after taking office in January 2001,
President Bush led the creation of a special White
House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initia-
tives (OFBCI), directing five Cabinet departments to
inaugurate Centers for Faith-Based and Community
Initiatives. (President Barack Obama would change
the name to White House Office of Faith-Based
and Neighborhood Partnerships in 2009.)
There is no consensus as to what exactly
constitutes a faith-based program initiative. In fact,
the White House was not even able to offer a “pre-
cise definition or what criteria must be met to be
one.”39 The main claim of its supporters is that
poverty and crime are the result of a person’s
“lack of morality.” Therefore, while neighborhood
and family cohesion in poor communities can go a
long way toward addressing the problem, suppor-
ters of faith-based initiatives take an approach fo-
cused primarily on religious programming. Initially
faith-based legislation augured toward scaling back
spending on rehabilitation and treatment with the
intention of channeling resources instead to private
faith-based groups.
From a criminal justice perspective the Bush-
era initiatives can be viewed as a number of crime
prevention efforts linking various religious commu-
nities with the goal of preventing and reducing
crime, ensuring public safety, and improving edu-
cation and employment opportunities for ex-
prisoners in an attempt to reduce recidivism rates
as they reenter society. A number of faith-based
programs are located in neighborhoods where a
high proportion of the residents are from minority
groups. The jury is still out as to whether these
organizations are any more effective than public
or nonsectarian organizations.
Faith-based organizations have provided fund-
ing and services to individuals and communities in
the United States for many years. Prominent faith-
based charities have included such organizations as
the Salvation Army, the Catholic Charities, and the

Jewish Federations. But, the concept of “faith-based
initiatives” dates back to the prison reform efforts of
Pennsylvania Quakers at the end of the eighteenth
century, when prisoners were expected to read the
Bible in hopes of penitence for past sinful behavior
(see Chapter 4). For more than 200 years these re-
ligious programs have been a staple of the American
prison system. What distinguishes the current crop
of programs is their affiliation with federally based
legislation. Some critics have even suggested that
faith-based programming was conceived by suppor-
ters in an attempt to gain religious service providers
access to federal funding previously reserved for
mostly non-faith-based groups. Nonetheless, faith-
based programs have been increasingly promoted as
an effective strategy for problems of prisoner reen-
try into society.
Embarking on a platform of what Bush called
“compassionate conservatism,” he went even fur-
ther to give his evangelical followers “faith-based
war, faith-based law enforcement, faith-based edu-
cation, faith-based-medicine, and faith based sci-
ence.”40 In his pursuit of “faith-based justice” one
of his first hires was the Pentecostal Christian John
Ashcroft as his new attorney general. Ashcroft
staunchly believed that the separation of church
and state resulted in a “wall of religious oppres-
sion.” As if seeking to bolster his bonafides, shortly
before his confirmation Ashcroft promised to put an
end to the task force set up by his predecessor Janet
Reno to combat violence against abortion clinics.
A number of domestic terrorism experts have sug-
gested that the 2001 spike in violence against these
clinics (from 215 to 795) might have been the result
of Ashcroft’s announcement and his refusal to send
U.S. marshals to stem the violence.
Crime dropped precipitously throughout the country in
the 1990s. There is no one explanation for this develop-
ment that applies to all cities. However, Boston was un-
ique for the influence of a coterie of ministers called the
Ten-Point Coalition in reducing its murder rate. By some
accounts the involvement of ministers in playing such a
crucial reduction of the city’s violent crime was almost
unprecedented among major cities. Others have
suggested that their contributions were less substantial
but seemed to make for “good politics and public
relations.” It was probably more likely that a cooperative
relationship between the Boston police and the Ten-Point
Coalition made the difference. Representing the African
American community, the Ten-Point Coalition legitimized
the increasing presence of the police in the inner city.
This together with the coalition’s efforts to improve
community surveillance in the end probably resulted in
increased police effectiveness. The lesson of this faith-
based initiative is that unless the police have the support
of local residents in a targeted area they will rarely be
successful.41
CRIM E AND PUNI SHM ENT
The 1980s and early 1990s were characterized by an
overwhelming fear of crime. While serial killers,
mass murderers, and drug crime continued to dom-
inate the nightly television news blitz, new crime
fears beckoned on the horizon featuring schoolyard
shootings and domestic terrorism.
In 1999, the “deadly tower” on Austin’s
University of Texas campus was reopened. It had
been closed following the murderous sniper shoot-
ings by Charles Whitman in 1966. Demonstrating
the continuing threat of mass murder in American
society, Whitman’s body count of 16 dead and 31
wounded would be exceeded several times in the
1980s and 1990s, most notably by George Hennard,
who killed 23 and wounded 23 at a Killeen, Texas,
restaurant in 1991. In 1984, James O. Huberty
murdered 21 and wounded 19 at a California
McDonald’s restaurant. Two years later, a disgrun-
tled postal worker killed 14 and wounded six, giving
credence to the expression of “going postal.”
The increased concerns over crime victimiza-
tion in the 1980s led many Americans to carry con-
cealed weapons. No case illustrated the potential
ramifications of carrying concealed weapons better
than the Bernard Goetz trial. In December 1984, a
36-year-old electrical engineer named Bernard
Goetz was approached by four black youths while
riding a New York City subway. Having been in-
jured in an assault just three years earlier, Goetz
took to carrying a concealed handgun whenever
he went out. When one of the youths asked him

for five dollars, Goetz went for his revolver and shot
at the men. Two were critically wounded, includ-
ing one that Goetz shot in the spinal cord after he
fell down while trying to escape. Goetz turned
himself in to the police nine days later and was
charged with a number of offenses, including at-
tempted murder and criminal possession of a gun.
During the trial two years later, Goetz was
turned into the victim of the case by his defense
team, noting the criminal backgrounds of the actual
victims. The trial would challenge the criminal jus-
tice system on several fronts, addressing the question
of a citizen’s right to defend oneself. In June 1987,
the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on 12 counts
and guilty on one charge of criminal possession of a
weapon in the third degree. Three months later,
Goetz was sentenced to six months in prison (two
years later, on review, his sentence was doubled to
one year).
The Crime Decline of the 1990s
There is no consensus as to why violent crime
dropped in the 1990s. Surely there were many fac-
tors at work. In urban America, the decline of the
crack market and police efforts to seize handguns
from criminals and juveniles get much of the
credit.42 Between 1991 and 1998, homicide and
robbery rates declined more sharply than any other
serious crimes. According to criminologists, these
two offenses were most often linked to the crack
epidemic and were most associated with handguns.
In 1995, the 30% drop in murders and shootings in
New York City was considered the result of police
frisking efforts that drove illegal guns off the street.
Gang members and drug dealers reportedly began
to leave their guns at home rather than risk losing
them to a police search. Despite criticism from civil
libertarians, few would argue that police assertive-
ness in this arena did not at least contribute to the
crime decline.43 Others suggest that the decline in
violent crime was attributable to the aging of the
population and the growing number of police offi-
cers on the street. Still others pointed to a growing
prison population and longer sentences. However,
this correlation has been brought into question
because incarceration also increased during the
crime rise of the 1980s.44
Other explanations focused on the demo-
graphics of age. During the late 1980s and early
1990s, the explosion of homicides coincided with
the rise in killings perpetrated by persons under
24 years of age. The drop in such crimes in the
1990s, then, can be associated with a downturn in
youthful involvement in the crack trade.
Not every region experienced a dramatic de-
crease in violent crime in the 1990s. There were
few places more violent in America than the Indian
reservations of the American West. For example, in
1995, New Orleans had one of the highest murder
rates in the country, at one per 1,259 residents. The
Fort Peck Reservation in sparsely populated Mon-
tana had a murder rate of one per 675 residents,
twice as high as New Orleans. The results were
similar on other Indian reservations. While residents
remained frustrated over the ongoing crime wave,
it has proven almost impossible to stem the violence
because of the lack of police officers and lack of
equipment.45
Between 1980 and 1997, property crimes in
the United States declined by almost 50%. The
drop in property crimes, such as burglary, larceny,
and auto thefts, did not receive the same attention
as more dramatic crimes of violence. However, ex-
planations for the decline of both types of crimes
were similar. Many law enforcement administrators
and criminologists suggested that the drop in prop-
erty crime was the result of improved police tactics,
a decline in the teenage population, and greater
community involvement, and that longer prison
sentences were responsible for the drop in violence
in crime. Others explained that the drop in property
crime was the result of the enhanced use of alarm
systems. However, criminologist Scott Decker dis-
sents, noting that most burglaries take place in poor
neighborhoods that lack alarm systems, not the
more affluent suburbs. Decker argues that the de-
cline has more to do with crack addicts giving up
“burglary because it required too much planning
and involved the uncertainty of whether a resident
might be home, perhaps with a gun.” In need of a
quick high, crack addicts made the transition to

robbery, which was considered a faster and safer
strategy for providing quick cash.46
Although the drop in property crime has been
felt in most major cities, none saw the numbers drop
as greatly as San Diego, California. As of 1997, San
Diego witnessed a 68% drop in burglary between
1980 and 1996. Police also claimed that larceny
crimes, such as petty theft, shoplifting, pickpocket-
ing, and motor vehicle break-ins, declined by 37%.
In addition, auto thefts plummeted 61%.47 Unlike
New York City’s former police commissioner
William Bratton, who credited his city’s crime de-
cline to an increased police presence, San Diego’s
police chief Jerry Sanders gave credit to new types of
community-oriented policing.
In the late 1990s San Diego had a 2,036-
member police force that was augmented by
8,000 volunteers. Many of these volunteers pa-
trolled their neighborhoods during the weekends
or helped fill out excess paperwork at the police
stations. With only 1.7 police officers per 1,000
residents (compared to New York’s 5.2 and 6.84
in Washington, DC), community-oriented policing
proved crucial to San Diego, which had the lowest
ratio of officers per capita in the country.48
Although American crime rates continued to drop
in the early 1990s, homicides by juveniles were on the
rise. According to criminologist James Alan Fox, the
rate of homicide by juveniles 14 to 17 years old rose
from 8.5 per 100,000 in 1984 to 30.2 per 100,000 in
1993 before declining to 16.5 per 100,000 in 1997, still
almost double that of 1984 levels.49
Several high-profile juvenile slayings led prose-
cutors and legislators to try more juveniles as adults.
Traditionally, 18 had been the age most commonly
used to define adulthood in the United States.
However, state, federal, and local laws responded
by setting a variety of thresholds for young people’s
responsibilities. While in times past lawbreakers un-
der 18 were consigned to the juvenile courts where
their names were kept private and sentence struc-
tured to maximize the chance for rehabilitation,
during the 1990s more and more juveniles were
ending up in adult courts.
In 1998, a series of school shootings in
Pennsylvania, Arkansas, and Oregon raised more
concerns about juvenile access to firearms. In 1999,
the worst of these shootings took place at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colorado, where two teen-
age students killed 13 before committing suicide.
Sunset for Traditional
Organized Crime?
The 1980s finally saw law enforcement make in-
roads on organized crime. Mob expert James B.
Jacobs credits the Racketeer Influenced and Cor-
rupt Organizations (RICO) statutes and the gov-
ernment’s campaign with winning convictions
against 23 major mob bosses and their associates
since 1981. While Jacobs suggests that it is too early
to write the obituary for America’s mob families,
new crime-fighting strategies demonstrate the sud-
den vulnerability of mobsters confronted by effec-
tive law enforcement.50
Since the 1920s and 1930s, the federal govern-
ment has attempted a variety of methods to destroy
if not cripple America’s entrenched Mafia groups.
However, until 1970 these groups were virtually
immune from prosecution. The FBI was indifferent
to organized crime for much of this period, and
local policing was often inept or corrupt.
The turning point in the war against Italian-
American organized crime was in 1970, when Con-
gress passed the Organized Crime Control Act, the
first legislation designed specifically to strike at orga-
nized crime activity. This act created a witness pro-
tection program and established a formal system to
encourage informers to testify by giving them new
identities and financial aid and relocating them and
their families far from the danger of reprisals. The
most significant part of the new legislation was the
RICO sections, under which mob bosses and their
subordinates could be implicated if prosecutors prove
they were linked to a criminal group or enterprise.
Except for New York and Chicago, the American
Mafia’s major families have been largely destroyed or
diminished in power.
Besides the utilization of RICO, generational
changes have also conspired against the Mafia and
have undermined mob discipline and weakened the
code of silence. By the end of the 1980s, organized

crime leaders were agreeing to cooperate with the
government in return for leniency and admission
into the Witness Security Program. In the 1992 trial
of Gambino family crime boss John Gotti, the gov-
ernment used the testimony of his underboss
Sammy “the Bull” Gravano (Gotti’s second in
command) to strengthen its case. It would be un-
thinkable in years past that someone of Gravano’s
stature would break the code of silence. But times
had changed. Gotti had been acquitted in three
previous trials, but this time he was found guilty
on all counts and was sentenced to life in prison
without parole.
The Changing Face of Organized
Crime in America
The changing immigration patterns of the late
twentieth century have transformed the face of or-
ganized crime in the United States. Not since the
turn of the century have so many immigrants
flooded into the country. Between 1982 and
1989, some 685,000 legal immigrants settled in
New York City alone. While there has been a
backlash in some parts of the country, immigration
has revitalized many older cities, such as Boston,
Chicago, and New York, all of which had been
losing residents for years.
The incredible diversity of America has always
been reflected in the tapestry of organized crime.
Jewish, Irish, and Italian immigrants predominated
during the peak years of their respective migrations.
However, the diversity and violence of this earlier
era pales in comparison to the current-day version.
Gangland violence has sporadically marked the as-
similation of some Dominicans, Russians, Colom-
bians, Jamaicans, Vietnamese, Laotians, and Chinese
immigrants who have been drawn to certain crimi-
nal enterprises as they pursue their version of the
American dream.
According to journalist William Kleinknecht,
“As long as there is an underclass” and “as long as
there are American cities,” there will be opportu-
nities for organized criminal activities.51 Whatever
the future of organized crime, drugs will surely
continue to be a staple commodity as crime groups
form stronger international links. International
criminal conspiracies, such as the Sicilian and Rus-
sian Mafias, Colombian cartels, and Chinese triads,
increasingly cooperate in a variety of illegal drug
enterprises. In response, international law enforce-
ment agencies have been forced to overcome their
traditional reluctance to cooperate and have joined
forces to fight organized crime on a number of
fronts. However, in recent years the crusade against
organized crime has been superseded by the “war
on terrorism.”
Capital Punishment (1976–2001)
In 1999, 3,555 men and women sat on death rows
across the nation. Although most Americans con-
tinue to support the death penalty, only about 2%
of death row inmates are actually executed. Never
of one mind about the death penalty in America,
12 states and the District of Columbia did not use
the death penalty, while several others imposed
moratoriums on its use (Illinois and Maryland).
Having legally shelved the death penalty in 1972,
in 1977, following a nine-year moratorium (there
were none between 1968 and 1972), it returned
with a vengeance, beginning with the firing-squad
execution of Gary Gilmore in Utah in 1978.
Between the return of the death penalty in 1976
and May 2001, 705 men and six women were exe-
cuted. An analysis of this group would find that most
of them were poor, usually white (56%), and typi-
cally high school dropouts. Most were from the
South, and most had never killed before. Of the
711 executions, 579 were carried out in the South,
with Texas leading the way with 246.52
Between 1977 and 1989, the number of
death row prisoners increased from 423 to 2,250.
Death row stays of execution continued to keep
pace as well, thanks in part to the frequency of ha-
beas challenges and abolitionist strategies ranging
from petitions for grants of clemency and public de-
monstrations to legislative lobbying. Between 1977
and 1989, average time between sentencing and ex-
ecution increased from 51 months to 95 months.53
Rising public support for capital punishment
in the 1970s and 1980s accompanied America’s

growing crime rates. A 1985 Gallup Poll study
found that 7 out of 10 Americans favored the death
penalty, the highest level of support since the poll
began querying support for the death penalty in
1936. Often lost in any discussion of the death pen-
alty is the drop in support for it when the alterna-
tive of life without parole is offered as well.
In 1987, the death penalty was once more called
into question in the case of McCleskey v. Kemp.
Charged with armed robbery and the murder of a
white police officer during a robbery in Georgia,
Warren McCleskey, who was black, was quickly ar-
rested, convicted, and sentenced to death. McCleskey
appealed his sentence on the grounds that it had
been imposed in a racially discriminatory manner.
His attorneys presented evidence from the results
of a statistical study profiling 2,000 Georgia murder
cases from the 1970s that demonstrated that black
defendants were more likely than other defendants
to be sentenced to death. Investigators concluded
that black defendants who killed white victims
were much more likely to receive the death sentence
than any other racial combination. Ultimately, the
Supreme Court denied McCleskey’s appeal on the
grounds that the statistical study presented as evi-
dence was insufficient to prove racial discrimination
in his case. The Court also held that his treatment
did not violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition
of cruel and unusual punishment.
Although most nations in the world that use the
death penalty bar the execution of juvenile offenders,
17 of those executed since 1976 committed their
crimes before they turned 18. By 2001, of the 38 states
that authorized the death penalty, 18 had established
16 as the minimum age at the time of the crime, five
had set it at 17, and 15 had set it at age 18.
In the 1980s, several Supreme Court cases took
up the constitutionality of executing juveniles. In
Thompson v. Oklahoma, the Court overturned the
death sentence of Monty Lee Edwards, who was
15 when he participated in a murder in 1982.
The defense argued that the sentencing judge failed
to consider the defendant’s age and abusive child-
hood. In 1988, the Court ruled that executing an
individual who committed a crime before the age
of 16 violated the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition
against cruel and unusual punishment, thereby
establishing 16 as the minimum age for the death
penalty at the time of offense (18 states had already
set this age as minimum for death penalty).
In January 1993, Washington State conducted
the nation’s first hanging in 28 years when Westley
Allan Dodd was hanged for raping and murdering
several children. Although by law Dodd was allowed
to choose between hanging and lethal injection, he
selected hanging since, as he explained, that was the
method he used to dispatch his young victims.
Since the eighteenth-century Enlightenment,
criminal justice reformers have continued to seek
more humane methods of execution. For many,
1982 would represent a watershed of sorts when
Texas inmate Charles Brooks became the first per-
son to be executed by lethal injection. With no
sparks, blood, or the wafting odor of burning flesh,
reformers were convinced that they had hit on a
scientific method of execution that would be ame-
nable to the modern era. However, law-and-order
advocates opposed it on the basis that the criminal
should suffer like the victim.
In May 2000, the Supreme Court reviewed
electrocution for the first time since its inception in
1890. By 2001, most states had abandoned electro-
cution in favor of lethal injection. Since 1890, more
than 4,300 people in 26 states were executed in the
electric chair. In 2000, only Nebraska and Alabama
used this method as their primary mode of execu-
tion. According to this case, the court was to consider
whether Nebraska’s particular method constituted
cruel and unusual punishment since it entailed four
separate jolts of electricity. In November of the same
year, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected a chal-
lenge to the electric chair, claiming that the con-
demned prisoner raised his electrocution challenge
too late in his appeal, barring it on procedural
grounds. No inmate had been electrocuted since
Virginia executed Michael Clagett in July 2000.
Execution versus Life without Parole
By 1990, 30 states had adopted life without parole as
an alternative to the death penalty while 2,400 pris-
oners awaited execution on death rows from coast to

coast. In 1994, the Gallup Poll continued to demon-
strate overwhelming support for the death penalty,
registering an all-time high of 80%. However, by
2001, support for the death penalty was eroding,
although the majority of Americans still favored it.
In an October 2001 Gallup Poll, 68% of the Ameri-
can public favored the death penalty. Reasons cited
for opposition included that it was administered un-
fairly and that it disproportionately targeted minori-
ties. Others changed their minds after 13 prisoners
on death row in Illinois were discovered to be inno-
cent, an admission that led Governor George Ryan
of Illinois to declare a statewide moratorium on the
death penalty in 2000. According to Austin Sarat,
author of the book When the State Kills, the morato-
rium should be considered the turning point in the
national dialogue about the death penalty.
Having set a one-year record of 40 executions
in 2000, Texas joined other states by considering
the alternative of life without parole as a sentenc-
ing option to the death penalty in 2001.54 As the
nation’s leading executioner, Texas offered juries
the choice of sentencing a capital murderer to ei-
ther death or life in prison, which carried the po-
tential for parole after 40 years. Most opinion polls
suggest that if life without parole was an option,
few juries would recommend the death penalty
while opponents argued that if this come to fru-
ition it would be one more step toward abolition
of the death penalty and would necessitate the
construction of more prisons. In 2005 Texas joined
45 other states that provided this alternative and
by 2010 there was a marked reduction in death
sentences as predicted.
In March 2001, the Supreme Court ruled that
jurors must be told the full truth when they are
deciding whether to sentence a killer to death or
life in prison. In the case of Shafer v. South Carolina,
the Court reversed the death penalty for a South
Carolina man who was condemned by jurors who
were confused about the meaning of the phrase “life
imprisonment.” In this particular case, 18-year-old
Wesley Aaron Shafer went to trial for the killing of
a convenience store clerk during a robbery. Recent
state law offered the possibility of either death or
life in prison without the possibility of parole. The
judge advised the jurors that they could decide on
either “life imprisonment or death.” When asked
for clarification, the judge refused to respond to
the jurors, leading to the death sentence. During
the 1990s, all but five states approved laws that im-
prison convicted murderers for the rest of their
natural lives with no parole option. Of the 38 states
with capital punishment, only four did not adopt
no-parole laws.
During this era, America was the only country in
the world that still used the electric chair and the gas
chamber for executions, while Utah, Oklahoma, and
Idaho continued to offer firing squads (and every few
years Delaware, Washington, or New Hampshire re-
sorted to hanging). An ABC News Poll in early 2000
found that support for the death penalty decreased
from 64% to 48% when there was an option of life
without parole. Other surveys captured similar senti-
ments. With recent accounts of wrongfully convicted
death row inmates having their sentences overturned
because of DNA evidence, a growing number of
citizens favor alternatives to capital punishment. A
2000 Gallup Poll examined why Americans support
state-sanctioned killings, or executions. According to
the survey, the most frequently cited reason was “a
life for a life,” retribution so reminiscent of earlier
and less sophisticated civilizations.55
In 1992 two professors at the Benjamin N. Cardoza
School of Law at Yeshiva University founded the
Innocence Project. Barry C. Scheck and Peter J. Neufeld
have earned international acclaim for creating the
Innocence Project and helping in the exoneration of
the wrongly accused with the help of modern forensic
technology. The Innocence Project only accepts cases
“where postconviction DNA testing can yield conclusive
proof of innocence.” Since DNA was introduced to the
courtroom more than a decade ago, 249 individuals have
been exonerated in the United States through DNA
testing (as of 2010). The majority had been previously
convicted of sex crimes, and about one quarter of
them involved murder. Meanwhile a number of states
have passed laws addressing the causes of wrongful
convictions. The most frequent contributing causes of
wrongful convictions include eyewitness misidentification
(almost 70%), faulty forensic science, false confessions
and admissions, government misconduct, informants,
and bad lawyering.

Restorative Justice
The search for alternatives to incarceration has a long
history in the United States. Almost 170 years ago
John Augustus played an important role in the estab-
lishment of the probation sentence in 1841, which
today is the most common sentence in the United
States.56 Until the 1980s judges relied mostly on the
standard options of probation or incarceration. Al-
though community-based alternatives such as resti-
tution and halfway houses had been around since the
1960s, “they lost credibility and support because they
were shown to be ineffective.”57 In the early 1980s
and the era of the “get-tough war on crime,” prison
overcrowding became such a serious problem that
other
alternatives
(intermediate
sanctions)
were
adopted such as boot camps, home confinement, in-
tensive supervision probation and parole, and others.
However, these options did little to reduce the over-
crowding or rising recidivism rates or provide ade-
quate sentencing choices.58
Criminal justice researchers and officials have
explored a number of alternatives to modern crimi-
nal sanctions. In most cases they have revisited earlier
eras in the history of criminal justice for inspiration.
Although restorative justice is considered a recent
trend, it has a timeworn legacy dating back in the
United States to Native American cultures and colo-
nial Americans; others assert its roots date back to the
customs and religions of the ancient world, where
the community played a pivotal role in the healing
and retributive processes after a crime had been com-
mitted. In traditional cultures new ways of managing
conflict were met by offering “a ritualized process”
involving members of the community and families
from both sides of the conflict. According to one
expert the process that now dominates criminal pro-
ceedings dates back to the trials by battle of the Mid-
dle Ages, when “hired combatants” fought duels on
behalf of the accused. Over time this was replaced by
the common law trial setting in which clients hired
the modern incarnation of the “hired guns”—
lawyers, who took part in determining guilt or in-
nocence. Today this usually results in a plea bargain
in which the victim has virtually no input. What’s
more, the malefactor’s accountability to the victim or
the community is rarely addressed.59 One researcher
has suggested that the implementation of restorative
justice programs “offers a new paradigm for structur-
ing relationships among crime, offenders and com-
munities” and hopefully some type of “victim-
offender reconciliation.”60
By most accounts the theory and expression
“restorative justice” came into use in the 1970s as
a reaction to the seeming excesses of a callous retri-
bution process as well as inattention to the concerns
of crime victims.61 Canada has been given credit for
introducing the first modern restorative justice proj-
ect in Ontario in 1975. Albert Eglash has received
the credit for coming up with the term, making a
distinction between three types of criminal justice,
which he argued were retributive, distributive, and
restorative.62 For Eglash the retributive and distrib-
utive processes focused on the crime, barring “vic-
tim participation in the justice process” with only
submissive participation by the offender. Contrast-
ing with these two was the restorative process,
which was intended to restore the harmful effects
of the criminal act and actively involved the partic-
ipation of both victim and offender in the criminal
process.63 What started out as just a handful of
“victim-offender mediation (VOM)” programs in
the late 1970s had expanded by the 1980s and
1990s to more than a thousand restorative justice
programs across North America.64 These new pro-
grams were an outgrowth and a response to the
backlash against the medical model of criminal jus-
tice that persisted between the 1930s and 1970s,
which insisted that the commission of crimes was
often influenced by psychological, social, and eco-
nomic forces beyond the control of the offenders.
Its goal was rehabilitation. However, as crime rates
skyrocketed in the mid-1970s, the public de-
manded harsher responses to the crime problem—
anything that
would
reduce
crime
and
high
recidivism rates. By the end of the 1970s the medi-
cal model had been sublimated by a justice model
predicated on the notion that crime was a rational
choice. Sentencing became more determinate and
fixed and it was left to offenders whether they
wanted to take part in the rehabilitation process.65
The goal of the justice model was to punish

offenders, protect the community from the of-
fender, and give society solace by punishing the
criminal actor. As a result the prison systems were
soon overcrowded and prison budgets strained for
resources.
There is little consensus as to the specific defi-
nition of restorative justice today. More than a de-
cade ago one survey found that it “emerged in
varied guises with different names” including an
alternative process for resolving disputes, alternative
sanctioning options, or a “distinctly different, new
model of criminal justice organized around princi-
ples of restoration to victims, offenders and the
communities in which they live”; other incarna-
tions might include diversion from formal court
processes, actions taken parallel with court deci-
sions, and the meeting between offenders and vic-
tims at any stage of criminal process.66 Supporters of
restorative justice initiatives objected to the fact that
prisoners were no longer required to take part in
the rehabilitative process. By the end of the twen-
tieth century the concept of restorative justice be-
came more prominent in Europe, stressing a
maximum involvement in the justice process on
the part of the offender, the victims, and the com-
munity. Several principles were at the heart of the
process and operationalized under the direction of a
specific court system and staff. The core principles
assert that justice required society and its institutions
to work and restore those who have been injured
and those victims and their family members (those
most directly affected by the crime) should have a
chance to participate in the response to the crime.
Restorative justice at its root features an active
role for victims of crime. However, critics insist that
the casual setting in which mediation between of-
fender and victim takes place is likely to enforce
existing relations of inequality between both par-
ties. It is doubtful that the principles of restorative
justice will ever replace the current criminal justice
process in the United States. Critics argue that if an
offender does not want to cooperate or be part of
the process or if the community is not supportive of
the programs, it stands little chance of success.
Others suggest that there are inherent dangers in
giving priority to this type of process over the
time-tested ones of deterrence and incapacitation.
By the twenty-first century victim-offender media-
tion programs, restitution and community service
were the most common types of restorative justice
programs in use in the United States.
Chain Gangs and Shaming: Cruel and
Unusual or Legitimate Alternatives?
Originally used as a form of punishment in the
South, the rattle of the chain gang returned to
America in 1995, when Alabama reintroduced this
measure as a cheaper and more effective way to
manage exploding prison populations. Chained in
five-man groups 8 feet apart, prisoners worked
12-hour days cutting and trimming roadsides and
cleaning up litter. (The following year Alabama
ceased using chain gangs, arguing that chaining the
prisoners individually was more effective than all
together.) In the 1960s, Georgia became the last state
to abolish the chain gang. According to one prison
commissioner, the return of chain gangs should be
considered a deterrence measure “that would leave a
lasting impression on young people.”67
Not confined to the South, the chain gang was
revived in Arizona and Wisconsin as well. Revert-
ing to criminal justice strategies of a previous era,
the Wisconsin chain gang also borrowed a page
from the future when it became the first state to
equip its prisoners with stun belts. Capable of de-
livering an 8-second burst of 50,000 volts of elec-
tricity, the belt would be triggered by a guard at a
control panel in the event of an escape attempt.
Despite the concerns of Amnesty International, ac-
cording to Wisconsin prison officials, prisoners were
eager for any outside activity.68
For a country searching for alternative criminal
justice strategies, it is surprising how rare it is for
policymakers to draw lessons from the past. How-
ever, several judges have experimented with forms of
exhibitory punishment that are reminiscent of the
Puritan New England colonies. Several cases in
Texas have made national news. In Houston, Judge
Ted Poe wrote legislation in 1999 that allowed state
judges in probation cases to order public notice of
the crime where it was committed. Poe himself has

issued close to 300 “public notice” sentences. In one
case, a man who was convicted of domestic violence
was required to publicly apologize to his wife on the
steps of city hall. In another, a drunken driver was
ordered to pace in front of a bar with the sign read-
ing “I killed two people while driving drunk.” In-
spired by Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter,
the judge explained that “if we are held up to public
ridicule, we don’t like it and things will happen. We
will change our conduct and our attitudes.”69
The recrudescence of shaming led to opposi-
tion from critics who viewed it as an attempt to
preach morality through the courts. Many of the
concerns were based on the separation between
church and state. Citing cases where judges ordered
offenders to attend church in Texas and Louisiana
in lieu of serving jail time or paying fines, the
American Civil Liberties Union and other groups
were worried that the move to shame-based pun-
ishment reflected a broader attempt by religious
conservatives to impose their values on the political
and legal systems.
Although there is no empirical evidence that
shaming affects criminal behavior, it has become a
popular alternative of justice. In one New Mexico
town, bad-check writers are advertised on a large
marquee; in Arizona, prisoners are taped at bookings
at the Maricopa County Jail and posted for viewing
on the Internet; and one of the more popular pro-
grams in Kansas City, Missouri, is shame-based
“John TV,” which offers photographs of individuals
arrested for crimes involving prostitution.
Despite occasional criticisms, there have been
few challenges to shame-based sentences. In many
instances, shaming is directed at sexual offenders,
with some judges requiring offenders to identify
themselves. Because shame-based sentences are usu-
ally alternatives to prison sentences, there is little
objection from the public since these sentences
save the taxpayer money while publicizing the local
threat of certain sex offenders. According to Marc
Klaas, whose daughter Polly’s murder in 1993 in-
spired the so-called Megan’s laws (after a 7-year-old
New Jersey girl was killed in her own neighbor-
hood), “We all came to realize it is anonymity
that breeds crime.”
AM ER ICAN VI OLENC E
Historian Roger Lane chronicled the history of
American murder patterns in Murder in America.
Published in 1997, his work came at a curious mo-
ment in American history, at a time when the na-
tion was transfixed by the O.J. Simpson murder
trial, several high-profile acts of domestic terrorism,
and a series of schoolyard shootings and rampage
killings, leaving most Americans under the impres-
sion that the nation was under siege by violent
crime. Lane, however, concluded that if one were
to compare 1990s homicide rates with times past,
except for intermittent ups and downs, “not much
had changed.”70
No type of shooting received more news cov-
erage than school shootings, particularly when the
victims were white. But schoolyard killings repre-
sented only a fraction of American homicides. Of
the almost 150,000 Americans murdered during the
1990s, no more than 150 were killed in or around a
school. Critics of selective media reporting of such
events cite the discriminatory coverage that all but
ignores shootings involving African American and
other minority victims, the most likely target of
schoolyard violence. According to Mike Males of
the Justice Policy Institute in Washington, DC,
“White and black youths [are] less menaced by
school violence now than a quarter-century ago.”71
Federal figures show that suicide is the eighth-
leading cause of death, killing 30,000 people each
year. One-third as many die in homicides. In May
2001, the federal government announced a national
strategy for suicide prevention. Among the recom-
mendations were adding more suicide prevention
programs in schools, jails, and the workplace and
encouraging members of the medical community
to ask at-risk patients about the presence of firearms,
drugs, and other lethal weapons in their homes.
In the 1990s, antiabortion violence escalated
from picketing, verbal harassment, arson, and
bombings to the outright assassination of physicians
and clinic employees. By the late 1990s, antiabor-
tion snipers began targeting doctors in their homes,
using high-powered rifles. One of the most promi-
nent of these killings was the murder of Dr. Barnett
330

Slepian near Buffalo, New York, killed by a gun-
shot through the window as he stood in his kitchen.
His assailant was identified as James Kopp. In March
2001, Kopp was apprehended in France following
an international manhunt. Aided by e-mail traffic
and wiretapped conversations with friends, French
police aided the FBI in the arrest. Kopp had been
on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List since
June 1999, and throughout his escape he was
helped along the way by antiabortion supporters.
Less publicized than the schoolyard shootings
and mass murders that sporadically inundate the
nightly news was the news in April 2002 that the
rate of violent crime against Hispanics fell 56% over a
seven-year period in the 1990s and was now similar
to violent crime against whites. This decrease coin-
cided with drops in violence against other minority
groups as well. Except for robbery, rates of victimiza-
tion for Native Americans were the highest in every
category. A spokeswoman for the National Council
of La Raza credited the efforts of the nation’s police
departments to improve relations with Hispanics.
What gave Americans their bleak impression of
current murder rates in this era was the saturation
coverage given to certain high-profile crimes. Some
of these crimes were unprecedented in scope.
Among the most notorious crimes of the era was
the 18-year murderous bombing spree of “Una-
bomber” Theodore Kaczynski between 1978 and
1996. The math professor turned Luddite targeted
university professors and a cornucopia of other re-
presentatives of what Kaczynski saw as the “Indus-
trial Society.” After killing three and wounding
more than a dozen with carefully constructed mail
bombs, Kaczynski blackmailed several newspapers
to publish his manifesto “Industrial Society and Its
Future.” Despite the intense manhunt, it was his
brother who identified him after recognizing the
jargon of the Unabomber as phrases and philosophy
often espoused by his brother.
Race Riots at the End of the
Twentieth Century
It would seem that as the twenty-first century
approached, America’s increasing racial and ethnic
diversity would have paved a more peaceful path to
the future. But many of the country’s old problems
that had lain dormant for the past decades were re-
kindled for familiar reasons. Historian Paul Gilje sug-
gested that one of the legacies of the 1960s “was the
ghetto riot.”72 However, unlike the 1960s, which
saw each hot summer explode into urban orgies of
looting and arson after seemingly ordinary confronta-
tions with police officers, race riots occurred only
sporadically in the 1980s and 1990s but could be
just as combustible and violent as in previous years.
In May 1980, the Miami area was hit hard by rioting
after an all-white Tampa jury acquitted four police-
men charged with shooting a young black man. This
disturbance, even by earlier standards of ferocity, was
particularly violent. Three whites were beaten to
death by blacks, but police officers would kill 11
blacks, and the riot would not conclude until the
National Guard was called in.
Rioting was not to be confined to traditional
patterns of black–white conflict as the century
moved to a conclusion. Rioting would occur in
Overtown, Florida, after a Hispanic police officer
was acquitted after shooting a black youth in 1984
and again in 1989. Dominican Americans rioted in
New York City after a similar incident, and in 1991
Hasidic Jews were targeted by blacks in New York
City after a Jewish man ran over and killed a young
black girl. Reaching back to the patterns of race
riots past, in 1986 whites in Howard Beach,
Queens, chased a black youth onto a highway
where he was struck and killed by an automobile.
As America’s racial and ethnic makeup became
more diverse during the 1990s, so too did the char-
acteristics of its rioters. Whether involving Viet-
namese or Korean American, black or white,
virtually all riots took place in urban America,
where opportunities were scarce for America’s
newest underclasses.
In April 2001, the Cincinnati police faced three
nights of rioting over the killing of an unarmed
black man by police, the 15th such episode in the
past six years. Pulling a page from criminal justice
past, the city mayor implemented a dusk-to-dawn
curfew. Police finally brought the riot under con-
trol with help from local residents and religious

leaders. Several factors as old as policing help ex-
plain this outbreak of race rioting in Cincinnati,
including the economic decline of inner-city com-
munities, police harassment and brutality, racial
profiling, and a disproportionate number of white
police on the force, a force that did not reflect the
demographics of the community it serves. Consid-
ering complaints by citizen board members who
lament that police do not communicate with
them and that they are not given the authority to
properly investigate complaints against the police,
from a historical vantage point the imperious styles
of the Los Angeles Police Department under
William Parker and the pre-Roosevelt New York
Police Department instantly come to mind.
Many scholars point to urban rioting as one of
the stimuli that led to the creation of modern po-
licing. With the first police riot training occurring
in the aftermath of the 1849 Astor police riot in
New York City, riot training has been given short
shrift on departments except for the civil rights and
antiwar years of the 1960s and 1970s.
The Los Angeles riots of 1993 proved once again
how unprepared city police are for dealing with
widespread civil unrest. Following a three-mile
high-speed car chase in the early hours of March 3,
1991, Rodney King was ordered to get out of his car
by several Los Angeles police officers. According to
officers, King was noncompliant and scuffled with
the officers, who were forced to resort to batons
and stun guns to subdue the hulking King.73 Un-
known to the police was the fact that someone had
tape-recorded much of the incident. The 81-second
tape of police officers beating and kicking a supine
King while other officers stood and watched reso-
nated in African American and other minority neigh-
borhoods of Los Angeles, where tension with police
continued to fester since the 1960s Watts riot. Ac-
cording to a Los Angeles Times poll taken two weeks
after the beating, 87% of the African American and
80% of the Hispanic respondents reported incidents
of brutality at the hands of the Los Angeles Police
Department (LAPD) as either “very common” or
“fairly common.”74
Following the beating of King, a commission
was convened by Mayor Tom Bradley to investigate
the LAPD. The so-called Christopher Commission,
chaired by future U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, published its findings and recommen-
dations in July 1991. The 10-member commission
was comprised of six lawyers, two professors, a col-
lege president, and a corporation chair. The findings
of the Christopher Commission report called for re-
form in the department, demanding the end of ex-
cessive force and racism by the police force. Its report
would ultimately lead to the resignation of LAPD
chief Daryl Gates.
Widespread anger over the taped beating led to
grand jury indictments against four of the officers
for assault (23 were actually present at the assault)
and the use of excessive force. The defense would
successfully have the trial moved to the mostly
white community of Simi Valley on the grounds
that it would be impossible to get a fair verdict in
the city of Los Angeles. With the eyewitness testi-
mony of the videotape, conviction of the officers
seemed a forgone conclusion. But on April 29,
1992, the jurors acquitted the four officers, sparking
some of the worst race riots in American history.
Within minutes of the verdict, black and His-
panic Los Angeles exploded in violence. Whites
were dragged from their cars and beaten as Korean
merchants engaged in gunfights with gangs of loo-
ters. Fifty-eight deaths were reported during the
riots. After several days of violence, the National
Guard, together with federal troops, helped quell
the riots. Their trial, acquittal, and the subsequent
riots in 1992 made the second trial of the officers in
1993 one of the highest-profile cases in American
legal history.
Rampage Killings
Although rampage killing is not a new phenome-
non, the 1990s witnessed a dramatic rise in such
killings, in which one or two individuals went on
killing sprees that would not end until they ran out
of bullets or were killed or taken prisoner. One
New York Times study identified 100 rampage
killings between 1950 and 2000. Of these, only
10 occurred before 1980, with 73 taking place in
the 1990s. This phenomenon took 425 lives and

injured 510 in half a century. Rampage killings
occur in all cultures; in fact, the phrase “running
amok,” meaning “frenzied or indiscriminate kill-
ing,” was first introduced in Malaysia.
Among the most overlooked issues concerning
the perpetrators is that at least half had shown seri-
ous mental health problems prior to their crime
sprees. While politicians have targeted a violent
popular culture that includes video games, movies,
and television, there is little evidence that these
forms of entertainment predispose individuals to
mass murder. The 1990s saw a drop in most types
of murder but an increase in rampage killings. Al-
though rampage killings represented less than 1% of
all homicides, the sheer number of deaths often
leads to rash judgments on behalf of the mass media
and its poorly informed constituency.
In the wake of heavily publicized schoolyard
shootings that culminated but did not end with
the 1999 Columbine shootings, there has been an
increased call for better law enforcement and
greater security at American schools and work-
places. But according to the New York Times, closer
scrutiny of each offender suggests that “these cases
have more to do with society’s lack of knowledge
of mental health issues, rather than lack of security.”
In virtually every case teachers, family members,
and mental health professionals overlooked signs
of mental instability.
An examination of rampage killers indicates
that these were “anything but random or sudden,”
with perpetrators often giving either verbal or be-
havioral warning signs. The most common precipi-
tator for rampage killings was the loss of a job or
romantic problems. What sets these crimes apart
from typical murders is that the average murderer
tries to get away with the crime. Of the more than
100 rampage killers in the New York Times survey,
not one escaped apprehension. Eighty-nine never
even left the scene of the crime.
Rampage killers differed from the typical pro-
file of a murderer in that they were usually older,
better educated, mostly white, and more likely to
kill a stranger. Moreover, few of the demographic
patterns of race and poverty usually associated with
crime applied to rampage killers. As the New York
Times report made clear, mental illness played a
huge role in these killings, and since mental illness
does not vary from race to race, a racial profile of
the perpetrators reflects the actual diversity of
America—the killers were mostly white, almost
18% black, and 7% Asian.
Explanations for the surge in these types of kill-
ings in the 1990s included the increasing availability
of more lethal weapons with larger ammunition
magazines and faster reloading. Although rampage
killings increased in the 1990s, other types of mul-
tiple killings declined or remained static. Multiple
killings of relatives and killings of three or more
persons to cover up a felony declined in the
1990s. As the domestication of murder continued
to decline, the workplace and schoolyard become
more dangerous than the home when it came to
these types of killings. Some experts blame the
news media for the saturation of crime coverage
leading perhaps to “copycat” killings. At least 14
of the rampage killers in the survey expressed
knowledge of earlier killing sprees.
NOTABLE TRIALS
People v. O.J. Simpson (1995)
Few “trials of the century” could top the public
spectacle and intrigue of the 1995 trial of former
football
hero
and movie-star-turned-car-rental-
pitchman O.J. Simpson for the murder of his ex-
wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, a
male friend. The Simpsons had divorced in 1992
but had continued to keep in contact and had
even considered reuniting at one point even
though Nicole reported to police dispatchers that
O.J. had threatened to kill her during an assault as
early as 1985.
According to the most irrefutable facts of the
case, during the early morning hours of June 13,
1994, a lone intruder knifed to death Simpson
and Goldman in the narrow entrance to Nicole’s
apartment. Forensic evidence indicates that the
woman was attacked first. Twenty-five-year-old
Ron Goldman apparently had the misfortune of

stopping by to drop off a pair of sunglasses that
Nicole had left at the restaurant where he worked
earlier that evening. More than three hours after the
murders, their savagely mutilated bodies were
found.
Almost immediately, attention was focused on
Nicole’s former husband, Orenthal James (O.J.)
Simpson. Reports filtered out of the Los Angeles
Police Department that blood had been found
matching that of O.J. outside his wife’s residence.
The news media would quickly report that a bloody
glove was found behind Simpson’s house that sup-
posedly matched one at the crime scene. O.J.’s hast-
ily assembled attorneys proclaimed his innocence.
After reneging on his promise to turn himself
in on June 17, Simpson was spotted on Interstate 5
in the back of a Ford Bronco driven by his friend
A.C. Cowlings. What ensued was perhaps one of
the most bizarre live television events of all time.
Before 95 million viewers, a legion of law enforce-
ment officers slowly followed the white Bronco on
the interstate past hundreds of cheering spectators
who lined the roads leading to Simpson’s upscale
Brentwood home. Arriving home, Simpson was ar-
rested, and the following month he pled “100% not
guilty.” In the process, he became one of the most
famous murder defendants in the annals of Ameri-
can criminal justice. Simpson was denied bail and
would languish in the Los Angeles County Jail dur-
ing his almost two-year trial.
Without such unprecedented media coverage,
the Simpson trial would have been rather mundane.
The trial itself is well chronicled by now. Dozens of
books were published after and during the trial.
Friends and family of the victims, a houseguest of
O.J.’s, O.J.’s friends, prosecutors, and defense mem-
bers all published quickly forgotten books. While
there were several that stood out, most were emi-
nently forgettable and quickly were consigned to
remainder tables.
The particulars of the case are familiar by now.
The night of the murder, O.J. flew to Chicago for a
business appointment. Returning to Los Angeles
the next day, he was interrogated by the police,
who focused attention on a deep cut on his right
hand. Stating that he did not remember the cut,
Simpson offered a number of explanations for the
cut—then the 60-mile car chase on the Los Angeles
freeway, which, according to the media, was “the
most famous ride on American shores since Paul
Revere.”75
The escape attempt and other crucial evidence
should have made the case a slam dunk for the
prosecution. But from the start, the prosecution
was characterized by ineptitude and miscalculation.
First, the district attorney’s office allowed the trial
to be held in downtown Los Angeles instead of
Santa Monica, where the crime occurred. Having
the trial in Santa Monica would have conformed to
protocol since its court would have jurisdiction
over crimes committed in the vicinity. Various ex-
planations were given for the change of venue.
Most convincing was the explanation that it was
an attempt to avoid the sort of rioting and unrest
that accompanied the initial acquittal of the police
officers in the Rodney King case. What was clear
was that the district attorney’s office wished to
avoid the implication that the jury would be
stacked against Simpson.
The prosecution also gave up another strategic
advantage by not seeking the death penalty. It is
common knowledge in the legal field that “death-
case-qualified” jurors tend to convict a defendant
more readily than panels that are more reticent to
inflict the death penalty.
Public opinion concerning Simpson’s guilt be-
came a national litmus test regarding race relations in
America. According to attorney David Cole, the di-
vision in public opinion in this case reflected “an
even deeper divide on the fairness and legitimacy
of American criminal justice.”76 One finding that
the news media focused on during the trial was the
existence of a racial divide concerning the ex-
football star’s guilt or innocence. In poll after poll,
it was reported that most white Americans believed
the prosecution, while almost “three-quarters of
black citizens” were inclined to side with the de-
fense.77 Some observers saw these polls as a statement
on the racial inequities of the criminal justice system.
Joining civil rights activists and others in the
growing media circus were women activists who
used the case to campaign against domestic violence.

Pointing out that the death of Nicole Brown
Simpson was the result of systematic domestic abuse
that led to murder, activists noted that almost one-
third of all female homicide victims were killed by a
husband or boyfriend. While O.J. would be acquit-
ted, the activists were successful in drawing attention
to the problem of domestic violence. Following
their campaign during the trial, battered-women’s
shelters reported more calls, and judges began to
hand down stiffer sentences in domestic violence
cases. In Los Angeles alone, reports of domestic
abuse to police increased by 60%.
As Gilbert Geis and Leigh Bienen make clear in
their book Crimes of the Century, for the student of
criminal justice the Simpson case was remarkable
for the number of challenges it posed to the crimi-
nal justice system. Should television be permitted in
the courtroom? Should juries be sequestered?
Should unanimous verdicts be required to convict
in a criminal trial?78 While the trial contributed lit-
tle to the development of constitutional principle, it
did demonstrate a number of interesting applica-
tions of existing legal principles. Among these
were the right to confront accusers, which in
California meant extending the right to the pretrial
stages of a case. According to one legal authority,
“The constitutional right most visibly on display
was Simpson’s Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination.”79
For almost two years, the world was transfixed by
the O.J. Simpson trial played live on television. One
could only wonder what Chief Justice Earl Warren
would have thought about such a high-profile trial
televised in the courtroom, having stated in 1965
that if television was allowed in the courtroom, “we
can turn back the clock and make everyone in the
courtroom an actor before untold millions of
people.” In the process, it would “make the determi-
nation of guilt or innocence a public spectacle and a
source of entertainment for the idle and curious.”80
The O.J. Simpson trial was one of the most
expensive in American history. It is estimated that
the defense team cost their client some $6 million,
while the state spent $9 million on the prosecution,
one-third of it going toward housing, feeding, and
sequestering the jury.
Simpson was an atypical black defendant—
famous, wealthy, and well represented. While in
times past he would have faced an all-white jury,
Simpson was judged by nine blacks, two whites,
and one Hispanic. Attempting to place the case in
a historical perspective, author David Cole, an
African American attorney, suggested that for a
brief moment, “for many black citizens, the acquit-
tal was a sign of hope,” noting that “for much of
our history, the mere allegation that a black man
had murdered two white people would have been
sufficient grounds for lynching…. To many blacks,
the jury’s not guilty verdict demonstrated that the
system is not always rigged against the black defen-
dant, and that was worth cheering.”81 Ultimately,
Simpson’s acquittal, similarly to Lizzie Borden’s a
century earlier, hinged on one of the most promi-
nent aspects of common law, namely, that a con-
viction requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
CONCLUSIONS
No matter what technological advances appear in
the twenty-first century, the criminal justice system
remains adamantly reliant on the time-tested tradi-
tions of the past. Witness the return of horse-
mounted patrols in shopping mall parking lots and
in urban centers and the return of shaming in the
courtroom. Since the advent of law enforcement, it
has been obvious that an officer on horseback has
advantages
over
a
purely
bipedal
counterpart,
particularly when it comes to controlling crowds.
First introduced by King Charles in 1629, horse-
mounted police branches are clearly on the increase.
Almost forced out of existence by the automobile,
over the past 20 years mounted patrols have once
again become a familiar presence in most large cities
and are considered advantageous for riot control,
community relations, and their high visibility. Also
demonstrating the cyclical nature of innovation in
criminal justice is the reinvigorated emphasis on
community-oriented
policing,
which
has
taken
the police officer from behind the wheel of an auto-
mobile and back to foot patrol in American
communities.
CONTEMPORARY CRIMIN AL JUS TICE AT THE END OF TH E TWEN TIETH CEN TU RY (1980– 1999)

Contemporary polls indicated shrinking sup-
port for capital punishment after a decade of almost
unshakable support. The debate over the death
penalty came into sharp focus after a confluence
of several events in 2001, including the execution
of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh,
protests during President Bush’s European visit
that focused on America’s death penalty policy as
a violation of human rights, the decision by a New
York jury not to sentence one of the African em-
bassy bombers to death, and the execution of a
murderer in Ohio who claimed he was schizo-
phrenic. Although a majority of Americans still
were in favor of the death penalty, the size of that
majority had diminished.
At the conclusion of 2001, a dramatic decline
in the use of the death penalty in America saw 66
people put to death that year compared to 85 the
year before. Texas, which executed 40 in 2000,
witnessed
17
in
2001
and
lost
the
lead
to
Oklahoma, which executed 18 convicts in 2001.
In addition to a combination of declining crime
rates, a wave of DNA exonerations have made the
courts and the public more skeptical about death
sentences. While the decline in executions has en-
couraged the opponents of capital punishment,
many are disturbed as the federal government began
executing people again for the first time in decades.
America’s state prison population increased by
500% between 1970 and 2000. Even while crime
rates dropped in the 1990s, prisons remained the
fastest-growing item in state budgets. By 2002,
more than two million inmates were incarcerated
in state, federal, and local correctional facilities at a
cost of more than $30 billion a year. Nationwide,
guards accounted for 80% of prison costs. To slash
budgets, some states began laying off guards and su-
pervisory positions. Others are cutting back on edu-
cational programs and food services to save money.
In April 2002, the Justice Department an-
nounced that the number of people in prison
grew by only 1% over the previous year, the slowest
rate in 30 years (as of June 30, 2001, one of every
145 residents was behind bars). Most U.S. prisoners
were held in state prisons, where the population
rose 0.4%. The federal prison population showed
the most growth at 7.2%. However, this was due in
part to the U.S. government’s continuing to assume
responsibility for District of Columbia prisoners (this
transfer ended in 2001). Racial disparities in prison
populations continued to haunt critics of the criminal
justice system. The Justice Department released figures
that showed that 13.4% of black males of ages 25 to 29
were incarcerated, compared with 4.1% of Hispanic
men and 1.8% of white males.
A harbinger of the intelligence failure leading up
to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in
December 1997 criminologists began focusing on
one of the least discussed problems of the criminal
justice system: the archaic state of record keeping in
the criminal justice system. As late as May 2002, col-
umnist Robert D. Novak claimed that when the
new FBI director Robert Mueller took over on
September 4, 2001, “the Bureau’s computer system
was so obsolete that he asked the CIA for help.”82
According to one 1994 Justice Department report,
only 18% of the nation’s felony records were complete
and computerized. Without adequate records, police
and prosecutors face obstacles in recognizing the dan-
gerous offender from the nondangerous, judges face
obstacles hampering the recognition of multiple and
repeat offenders, and prison officials cannot determine
whether an inmate merits maximum security.
Although the FBI collects names of people
who have been arrested, it does not reveal whether
individuals have been convicted or acquitted (as of
1997). In its own defense, FBI officials explain that
it is difficult to gather this information from the
thousands of local agencies that vary in record-
keeping practices.
Throughout much of the Western world, coun-
tries have adopted a “harm-reduction” approach to
illegal drug use. Proponents of the continuing
drug war have learned little since the 14-year
experiment with alcohol prohibition. According to
Ethan Nadleman, director of a New York drug pol-
icy research institute, “Drugs are here to stay … we
have no choice but to learn how to live with them
so that they cause the least possible harm.”
The United States spent $4 billion on drug con-
trol in 1980. Twenty years later this figure stood at
more than $32 billion per year. The number of people

incarcerated on drug charges also increased by 8 times,
from 50,000 to more than 400,000. Because of
mandatory sentencing, many thousands of otherwise
law-abiding citizens were serving long sentences for
first-time nonviolent offenses. Some critics of the drug
war would argue that it has damaged our constitutional
protections against abusive law enforcement without
an appreciable impact in ending the drug trade.
The law enforcement community has been
quick to take credit for the reduction of violent
crime in the 1990s. New police strategies and the
increase of police officers on the streets certainly
share some of the credit for the decline in crime
in this time period, but other factors have also con-
tributed to this phenomenon, including declining
unemployment rates, demographic changes, and
the decline in the crack cocaine market.
Between 1977 and 1994, Americans were exe-
cuted by firing squad, hanging, electrocution, the gas
chamber, and lethal injection.83 Twenty-six states
used the electric chair at its peak, but over the past
half a century, most of the 38 death penalty states
have switched to lethal injection. In 2000, only
Nebraska and Alabama continued to use electrocu-
tion as the primary form of execution after Georgia
and Florida agreed to switch to lethal injection.
Florida switched only after a series of grisly executions
led state legislators to brand electrocutions as uncon-
stitutional as “cruel and unusual” punishment.
With close to two million prison inmates by
the end of the 1990s, America incarcerates a greater
percentage of its people than any industrialized
country except Russia (which it would surpass in
the next decade). Nationally, one of every 113
adult males was behind bars. Since 1990, the na-
tion’s state prison population increased 65% com-
pared to 106% in the federal prisons. While there
had indeed been a decline in serious crime, more
people are going to prison under harsher sentencing
laws. Critics of drug enforcement policies blamed
the growing racial disparities of American prisons
on sentencing disparities that saw crack cocaine
(minorities were more likely to be convicted for
crack-related offenses) offenses carry penalties that
were 100 times greater than powdered cocaine
(favored by middle-class white consumers).
The backlash against violent youth crime that saw
zero-tolerance strategies applied to public schools be-
gan to soften in 2001. These strategies came to promi-
nence when the federal government mandated that
any school that received federal funds was required to
expel any student who brought a firearm onto campus.
California widened the net to require expulsion for any
student caught selling drugs. The spate of highly publi-
cized schoolyard shootings in the late 1990s led school
boards to take these policies further, calling for expul-
sion of students who possessed any item that could be
construedasaweapon,includingtoygunsandnailfiles.
Others added home remedies, such as aspirin and
Tylenol, to the list of banned substances.
Leading the resistance against the draconian
policies were educators and other teachers who
felt that suspensions for relatively minor alcohol
and weapons infractions were too punitive a re-
sponse. The rush to judgment that had been zero
tolerance led to expulsions of Boy Scouts for mis-
takenly bringing scout knives to school as well as a
10-year-old girl who turned over her mother’s
kitchen knife to authorities when she realized she
had brought it with her to school by mistake. But
despite well-publicized exceptions, many school
administrators credit these policies with reducing
campus violence and deterring substance abuse. In
the spirit of compromise, some campuses are imple-
menting lighter sentences, attempting to make the
punishment fit the offense.84
Point–Counterpoint
The Aftermath of Waco: Changes in Federal Law
Enforcement
In July 1995, hearings were held to examine the activities of
federal law enforcement agencies during the siege of the
Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993. The
sequence of events began with the killing of four law en-
forcement officers on February 28, 1993, and concluded with
the deaths of more than 80 at the Branch Davidian com-
pound, including 22 children. Subsequent Congressional
hearings investigated the facts surrounding the entire opera-
tion and 51-day stand-off between the two incidents. In the
first passage Larry Potts, former assistant director for the

FBI’s Criminal Investigation Division, explains the FBI’s
strategy for resolving the Waco standoff. The second excerpt
contains some conclusions by the committee chairman on how
these types of episodes can be better handled.
The FBI’s strategy for resolving the situation in
Waco was twofold: (1) to verbally negotiate a
peaceful surrender of Koresh and his followers;
and, (2) to gradually increase the pressure on those
inside the compound by tightening the perimeter
around the compound and denying the Davidians
certain comforts. In formulating this strategy and
throughout the events in Waco, the FBI utilized
its Behavioral Science Unit, the National Center
for the Analysis of Violent Crime, and a host of
outside experts in such specialties as religion and
theology, psycholinguistics, cults, medicine, threat
assessment,
negotiation
techniques,
psychology
and psychiatry. The experts provided a wide range
of information on Koresh’s state of mind and be-
havior, as well as information on an array of issues
the FBI faced. The FBI also received hundreds of
unsolicited telephone calls from individuals offering
advice on how best to resolve the standoff with the
Branch Davidians. As part of its exhaustive efforts to
gather as much information as possible, the FBI
followed up on most of these telephone calls which
appeared legitimate. Not all of the expert opinions
were consistent on all issues but the FBI considered
the information it received and made the best judg-
ment it could toward achieving a peaceful resolu-
tion to the standoff.
Despite these efforts and all of the outside ex-
pert advice, the FBI was unable to convince the
compound’s occupants either as a group or individ-
ually to surrender peacefully. The response of
Koresh was always to consistently promise to
come out at certain times and to consistently break
his promise and fail to do so. Eventually, he advised
that the Davidians would emerge only when God
gave such an instruction to him.
Based on the developments on-site and the ad-
vice of experts, the FBI concluded that permitting
the standoff to continue would never lead to the
peaceful surrender of Koresh, but instead would
continue to elevate the risk to the innocent chil-
dren inside the compound, as well as to the law
enforcement officers at the scene. As a result, a stra-
tegic plan was then developed to deliver non-lethal
tear gas into the compound in hopes of causing the
evacuation of the occupants. For nearly two weeks,
the FBI wrestled internally with the details of the
plan, before presenting it to the Attorney General
for approval, to best ensure a safe and satisfactory
end to the standoff. In developing its plan to release
tear gas into the compound, the FBI thoroughly
considered and examined numerous strategic and
tactical issues, including the possibility of a hostile
reaction from the Davidians; the night vision
capability of the Davidians; the strategic firing point
that the compound’s tower provided the Davidians;
the risk of harm to the children inside the com-
pound; the possible harmful effects, if any, of tear
gas; and, of course, the massive amount of weapons
and ammunition in the compound and the danger-
ous people who had already killed four federal
agents.
As a result of its extensive analyses of these is-
sues, the FBI developed a non-combative plan to
release tear gas incrementally into the compound
over a two-day period, gradually causing certain
portions of the compound to become uninhabit-
able. The plan provided for increasing the release
of gas only to the degree needed to accomplish
evacuation of the compound. The plan also in-
cluded notifying the Davidians that the gas was go-
ing to be inserted into specific portions of the
compound and providing them the time and means
to exit the building safely. Extensive medical sup-
port, to include 12 physicians and 13 paramedics,
would be standing by and loudspeakers and signs
would be used to guide the people out of the com-
pound. In the event that the Davidians opened fire
on the FBI agents, the plan provided for the agents
to return fire and to escalate the delivery of the tear
gas into the entire compound to suppress the
gunfire.

Since 1986, the FBI has been involved in the
DOJ’s quest for alternatives to the use of deadly
force. This technology search has evolved into the
current “Less Than Lethal Weapons” (LTLW) Pro-
gram. The SWAT Training Unit, now a component
of CIRG, has participated in a number of research
efforts during the past two years and has created a
working LTLW Committee to review various ave-
nues of research and development of LTLW tech-
nology. The LTLW Committee is keeping abreast of
both classified and unclassified research and develop-
ment in this area through liaison with the military,
national laboratories, federal law enforcement, pri-
vate industry, and other involved entities. Research
encompasses the full spectrum of relevant technolo-
gies including mechanical/impact, electrical, chemi-
cal, and biomedical, all designed to safely subdue
dangerous subjects without resorting to the applica-
tion of traditional weapons.
In addition to the above changes in jurisdic-
tion, operations, and research, the Attorney Gen-
eral, the FBI Director, a large number of SACs, all
FBI profilers, and an FBI Agent from every field
office are all receiving or have received crisis man-
agement training, including behavioral science ex-
pert training, to become familiar with CIRG, its
components, capabilities and procedures.
These and other changes have improved our
crisis response capabilities and have maximized the
likelihood that the FBI will be better prepared to
resolve future crisis situations successfully.
The CHAIRMAN. Let me just thank all of our
witnesses and the public at large for their close at-
tention during these hearings. In conclusion, I want
to reiterate the message that I began with yesterday.
Throughout my years of service in Washington, I
have been a very strong supporter of Federal law
enforcement. I have the utmost respect for both
agencies and the individual agents who put their
lives on the line every day for us. It is the quality
and heroism of these people that guarantees that, as
a whole, Federal law enforcement is a success across
the Nation.
As a result, none of us should overlook the fact
that for every Waco or Ruby Ridge, there are
thousands of safe, successful, and uneventful law
enforcement actions carried out each year. It is be-
cause of my interest in and respect for law enforce-
ment, though, that these hearings have become
necessary.
During the past 3 years, I have become partic-
ularly aware of a number of growing problems
in law enforcement. These problems include the
increased militarization of law enforcement agen-
cies, the inability of agencies to gather and assimi-
late gathered intelligence and act on it, the public’s
loss of confidence in law enforcement, the lack
of organization between negotiations and tactical
wings of law enforcement, and the reckless and
overly aggressive attacks of field commanders.
Both in Ruby Ridge and Waco, law enforcement
actions failed as a direct result of these problems,
and I therefore decided to convene these hearings
with the intention of correcting these problems.
I am encouraged by the progress we have made
during the past few days. We have learned that
ATF and FBI have recognized the problems that
exist in law enforcement. We have also learned of
the various steps that both ATF and FBI are taking
to correct the errors that occurred at both Ruby
Ridge and Waco. Some of these steps include the
placement of a greater emphasis on negotiations,
the creation of the Critical Incident Response
Group, the CIRG, and the development of better
lines of communication between the various law
enforcement teams.
Unfortunately, not all of the problems dis-
cussed have been addressed. More needs to be
done to bolster the role of behavioralists and nego-
tiations generally in barricade and hostage situa-
tions. We need to have greater data processing
and computerization in our behavioral group of
people down there at Quantico. That costs money,
and it is Congress’ fault that we are not putting
enough money into these matters so that we are
more skilled and better than we currently are.
But more needs to be done to rid law enforce-
ment of its current militaristic mentality. We have
got to bolster the role of behavioralists and negotia-
tions generally, especially in these barricade and
hostage situations.

Finally, more needs to be done to restore the
confidence of the American people in law enforce-
ment. This last issue becomes especially poignant in
light of the tragedy at Oklahoma City. If law en-
forcement can work to accomplish these goals, my
aims in convening these hearings and those of the
other members of this committee, of course, are
realized. If law enforcement fails, our Nation is go-
ing to suffer.
One thing is certain: In the future, this com-
mittee is going to redouble its efforts in diligently
overseeing the use of force by law enforcement
agencies. Misuses of power by law enforcement
will be carefully investigated. As long as I am chair-
man of this committee, I will see to it that law
enforcement in this country is held to the highest
standards. I don’t think you gentlemen mind that. I
think you want to be held to the highest standards
because that is what has always characterized the
FBI and ATF through the years.
So, in summary, I believe that the best way
to restore the public’s confidence in law enforce-
ment is for us to put Waco and Ruby Ridge behind
us. Law enforcement has to move away from
paramilitary operations and recommit itself to
high-quality
crime
prevention.
Additionally,
I
look forward to hearing from the administration
as to how they further intend to ensure that trage-
dies like those at Ruby Ridge and Waco are never
repeated.

CRITI CAL THINKING QUESTIONS
1.
What events led to the decreased prestige of
the FBI in the 1980s and 1990s?

Contrast the tenor of criminal justice in
America during the 1980s to that of the 1960s.
What changes in law enforcement, court rul-
ings, and corrections come to mind?

On September 11, 2001, the United States and the
world changed. No part of America’s social, eco-
nomic, and legal fabric faced more challenges than
its criminal justice system. On September 11, 2001,
a concerted attack on America by 19 Arab airplane
hijackers on four planes left almost 3,000 dead.1
It was the second-bloodiest day in American history
next to the Civil War battle of Antietam in 1862.
In the aftermath of the attacks, the criminal justice
system faced reorganization and challenges unparal-
leled in its 200-plus-year history. Then Attorney
General John Ashcroft said that he expected the
Justice Department and federal law enforcement
to undergo a “wartime reorganization” to prevent
future terrorist attacks. Ashcroft recommended shif-
ting many law enforcement responsibilities from
the FBI to state and local authorities. In effect, local
law enforcement was expected to be ready to act as
first responders to future terrorist attacks, while the
FBI was expected to make the dramatic and historic
conversion from apprehending bank robbers and
drug dealers to placing more emphasis on antiter-
rorism efforts.
September 11 demonstrated some of the short-
comings of the nation’s crime-prevention and secu-
rity systems, leading many Americans to question
the abilities of the government to protect them at
any level. But research has suggested that much of
the public’s fear over the past decade is a response
to the saturation of hysterical media reporting and
the manipulation of public fear. A virtual panic has
ensued over domestic terrorist threats much in the
way the fears of child molesters, juvenile predators,
and serial killers were blown out of proportion in
the 1980s and 1990s.2
The most drastic antiterrorism measures have
been implemented at the federal level. Among the
most controversial was the most aggressive national
campaign of ethnic profiling since the 1940s, result-
ing in the detention of hundreds of mostly Middle
Eastern men. Few were convicted of any crime at all.
Other contentious measures adopted or being con-
sidered to fight terrorism include convening military
tribunals to try foreign suspects, expanded wiretap-
ping, and the monitoring of conversations between
lawyers and detainees. Despite the controversy over
the new tactics, initially the majority of Americans in
a survey conducted by the National Law Journal in
October 2001 favored the increased wiretap and sur-
veillance powers and pointed to a general pro–law
enforcement shift among potential jurors in criminal
matters. This was a dramatic shift in opinion from
earlier polls that reflected an antipolice bias after
highly charged police brutality cases in New York
City and corruption cases in Los Angeles. More than
half the respondents also indicated that racial profil-
ing is acceptable under certain circumstances. None-
theless, the polls indicated that the public is rather
inconsistent on its opinions in criminal justice mat-
ters, as September 11 caused many to reverse course
in their thinking about racial profiling, the death
penalty, and civil liberties protections.
Although polls suggested that Americans ini-
tially supported these measures, civil liberties groups
and some lawmakers have complained that the new
tactics undermine a number of civil rights princi-
ples, comparing the roundup of terrorist suspects
under the aegis of Attorney General John Ashcroft
to the Justice Department’s Palmer raids against
communist subversives in 1919. What’s more, these
tactics have contributed to a growing prejudice
against foreign-born Americans, immigrants, and
visitors, especially those with Muslim, Arabic, or
Middle Eastern heritage. It should not be surprising
that hate crimes against these groups have risen over
the past decade as well.

Some researchers have suggested that current
counterterrorism efforts are “similar ideologically”
to the crime-oriented model of justice, which is
heavily focused on deterrence and relies on speedy
and efficient court proceedings. What’s more, those
arrested are presumed guilty, compared to the tradi-
tional due process model that presumes innocence.
In the crime-control model, interrogation rather
than courtroom procedures produce efficient crime
control. In other words, “In the war on terror
the relationship between due process and crime
control is sharply tilted in the direction of crime
control.”3
In many aspects of crime control, the legisla-
tion produced during President Bush’s first term did
not differ noticeably from that of his predecessor
President Bill Clinton. Although the USA Patriot
Act has come under attack for its violations of
due process, it was “not as far reaching in the
invasion of citizen privacy as was the 1996 Antiter-
rorism Act signed into law by Clinton.” Both pre-
sidents have been accused at one time or another of
expanding the role of government in counterter-
rorism in ways consistent with the conservative
crime model.4
During the Bush Administration, “enhanced
interrogation techniques,” better known as torture,
were approved by the Justice Department, a clear
sign that times had changed because of 9/11. Law-
yers for the president reportedly provided legal jus-
tifications for the torture of suspected terrorists. The
Bush approach to national security led to a number
of controversial policies that were adopted in secret,
including the disappearances of detainees into secret
CIA prisons, use of torture to gather evidence, ren-
dition of suspects to countries known to torture,
and warrantless wiretapping of Americans.
The following are some major provisions from the 1996
Antiterrorism Act inaugurated during the Clinton
administration:
A federal death penalty for deaths resulting from
acts of terrorism
Secretary of State authorized to designate private
groups as terrorist organizations and prohibit them
from fund-raising in the United States and have
assets frozen
Penalties up to 10 years in prison provided for
anyone supplying “material support or resources”
to a foreign terrorist group
The ability to prosecute crimes against federal
employees while on duty as federal rather than
state offenses
Stronger procedural controls on asylum, deporta-
tion, and entry into the United States
Private citizens who were victims of terrorism could
sue for damages against state sponsors
Once terrorists are arrested, the next important
decision is where to keep them. But, when it comes
to putting them on trial there are few acceptable
choices. The Obama administration had made plans
in 2009 to try September 11 mastermind Khalid
Sheik Mohammed and four other suspects in New
York City, not far from where the attacks took place.
New Yorkers initially looked forward to hosting the
trial as a symbolic show of the city’s resilience and to
showcase “the strength of the nation’s criminal justice
system.”5 Many survivors wanted to hold trial in a
civilian court rather than a military tribunal. Families
looked forward to attending. However, once the
specter of Manhattan in virtual lockdown dawned
on most New Yorkers, support dwindled, especially
when Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and
Mayor Bloomberg described plans to set up road
blocks and checkpoints throughout the financial dis-
trict at a cost of more than $200 million annually to
address security concerns. Just 77 days later the
Obama administration reversed its decision citing
the dangers and challenges implicit in holding the
trial in New York City.
The early and quick passage of the USA Patriot
Act had a tremendous impact on American life,
increasing government secrecy on a number of
levels. Many critics saw the Department of Home-
land Security tactic of using color codes to indicate
the level of probability of terrorist attack as a gov-
ernment strategy to ramp up fear among the popu-
lous to grant increased power to the FBI or as a way
of ameliorating protests against civil liberty trans-
gressions. However, the Bush strategy against ter-
rorism developed over a period of years.
Under pressure from Supreme Court rulings,
Congressional legislation, and disclosures in the

news media, Bush in his second term trimmed back
some of his most expansive programs and claims to
executive power, and by the time Obama took office
in 2010, “waterboarding had been halted for years,”
secret black site prisons purportedly emptied of pris-
oners, “and the warrantless surveillance program and
military commission system had been restructured
and approved by Congress.” What was most unfore-
seen after all the campaign rhetoric directed against
the current administration was that President Obama
would allow the surveillance program to continue
unaltered, support the Patriot Act, retain the author-
ity to use rendition, and embrace some of Bush’s
claims to state secrets. He even continued the use of
the military commissions and national security letters
he criticized during the presidential campaign, “albeit
with more due-process safeguards.”6
TH E LAWGI VERS
The U.S. Supreme Court saw 2009 finish with
76,655 criminal case filings, the largest number
since 1932 (92,174 cases), the year before the end
of Prohibition, and a time when most of the cases
were federal alcohol-related offenses. Several pat-
terns have emerged. For example, the number of
drug cases fell for all drugs except marijuana, as did
gun-related cases. However, the largest increase was
in immigrant crimes (+19%), mostly related to ille-
gal reentry by immigrants or the abuse of visas and
entry permits. The Supreme Court also reported a
drop in appeals from 8,241 to 7,738. By most ac-
counts this is related to the huge odds against hav-
ing a case heard, which typically amounts to about a
1-in-100 chance of making it.7
The terrorist attacks of September 11 had a tre-
mendous impact on America’s criminal justice system.
Taking a page from the historical record (such as mar-
tial law and the suspension of habeas corpusduring the
Civil War and the internment of Japanese-Americans
during World War II), following September 11 many
civil liberties long taken for granted have taken
“a back seat to safety.” Some scholars suggest that
American civil liberties had already “grown to an
extent that the Founding Fathers probably never
imagined.”8 Historian Eric Foner argued that the
acceptance of civil liberties as being “very ingrained
in our culture” is a fairly recent phenomenon. Foner
asserted that “formost of our history, the Bill of Rights
was pretty irrelevant,” citing examples of violations
during the Red Scare of the 1920s and the detention
of Japanese Americans during World War II.9
An examination of the development of civil lib-
erties in America suggests that rather than being
“fixed and immutable,” civil liberties have often
“expanded and contracted” throughout American
history, particularly during periods of social upheaval
and war. In the months following September 11,
the federal government gave law enforcement per-
mission to tap telephones and read electronic mail
and created an environment that endorsed self-
censorship of free speech. On October 26, 2001,
President George W. Bush signed the USA Patriot
Act into law, which expanded the government’s
power to monitor private conversations and e-mail
and allowed police to obtain search warrants and
enter a citizen’s home without his or her knowledge.
The new law also made it easier to deport nonciti-
zens suspected of being security threats. Foreigners,
in most cases of Middle Eastern background, have
been targeted by investigators and suspicious citizens,
following an era in which noncitizens had been en-
joying their greatest freedom in American history
because of a number of Supreme Court decisions.
President Barack Obama has led the way in building a
more diverse federal bench. Besides appointing Sonia
Sotomayor as the first Latina woman on the U.S. Supreme
Court, he also nominated 16 judges to lifetime seats (only 6
were white men). Although Obama is behind his prede-
cessor in the pace of selection, only 16 to Bush’s 48 at the
same time in his presidency, Bush’s appointments were
78% men and 82% white. Today the United States employs
1,700 full-time federal judges, “a caste of elite jurists hand-
picked for the difficult and sometimes dangerous job of
enforcing our nation’s laws and protecting our rights.”10
USA PATRIOT Act (2001)
On October 26, 2001, President George W. Bush
signed into law the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required
to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, better

known by its acronym USA PATRIOT Act. Many
of its critics charge it was rushed into law too
quickly by a nervous Congress in the aftermath of
9/11. The USA PATRIOT Act revised the stan-
dards for government surveillance, including federal
access to private records. It enhanced electronic sur-
veillance authority, such as tapping into e-mail,
electronic address books, and computers and per-
mitted the use of roving wiretaps that allowed the
surveillance of individual telephone conversations
on any telephone anywhere in America. It also re-
quired banks to become more transparent, identify-
ing sources of money deposited in some private
accounts while requiring foreign banks to report
suspicious transactions. Any immigrants who were
associated with raising money for terrorist organi-
zations faced deportation. One of its most contro-
versial passages permitted detaining immigrants
without charges for up to one week on suspicion
of supplying terrorists.
The Patriot Act established several new laws
that were equally applicable to the campaign against
organized crime, such as anti–money laundering
laws and granting extensive powers to the U.S. at-
torney general. These rules have been highly con-
troversial, especially when it came to detaining
foreign citizens and other nonresidents, as well as
for simplifying wiretaps and other surveillance
measures. Other criticisms targeted the detention
of terrorist suspects indefinitely without filing for-
mal charges, roving warrants (Section 206) that
allow law enforcement to potentially gain access
to electronic surveillance of innocent citizens, and
“sneak and peak” warrants (Section 2130) that
allow law enforcement to secretly search a private
residence; if showing good cause, they could delib-
erately delay notifying the property owner of the
warrant.
Supporters of the legislation claim critics have
overreacted to its “Orwellian name (as in George
Orwell’s 1984).” Others would argue it had not
created any great revolution in government powers
and merely “amounted to evolutionary improve-
ments in pre-existing law enforcement powers.”11
Still there were those from the Justice Department
who
asserted
that
delayed
notification
search
warrants are a “long-existing crime-fighting tool
upheld by courts nationwide for decades in orga-
nized crime, drug cases, and child pornography.”12
At its inception the Patriot Act enjoyed widespread
support. But over the years it has lost much of its
luster as various constituencies targeted controver-
sial provisions. In fact, as soon as it went into effect
critics began comparing it to the controversial
RICO statute. One critic castigated it as a “knee-
jerk reaction to a seemingly insurmountable prob-
lem” while another suggested it modified existing
laws to expand the powers of the federal govern-
ment in areas such as surveillance and information
gathering, making the United States “a nation of
potential suspects.”13
From a purely criminal justice perspective, its
passage eliminated some of the barriers that for-
merly prevented law enforcement agencies from
collaborating and created new money-laundering
crimes
while
increasing
penalties
for
existing
money-laundering violations. Although the act
was intended to confront the challenges of terror-
ism, law enforcement found it also was applicable
to other crimes, such as money laundering, political
corruption, and cybercrime.
The debate over the provisions of the Patriot
Act crossed the ideological divide. To address some
of the concerns of lawmakers when it was con-
structed, the Patriot Act included a “sunset provi-
sion,” mandating that its major provisions will
automatically expire unless periodically extended.
When it was renewed in 2006 it incorporated com-
promise provisions that included restrictions on fed-
eral agents’ access to library records. In March 2007
FBI Director Robert Mueller admitted that “his
agency had improperly, and sometimes illegally,
used the USA Patriot Act to obtain information
about people and businesses.”14
Patriot Act Reauthorization (2005)
Nearly four years after the 9/11 attacks and the
subsequent passage of the USA Patriot Act, then
president George W. Bush signed the USA Patriot
Act Improvement and Reauthorization Act of
2005. This legislation allowed law enforcement

and intelligence officials to continue sharing infor-
mation and using the same tools used against drug
dealers and other criminals against terrorists, while
giving them the necessary tools required for the
task. The Bush administration claimed the reautho-
rization was intended “to safeguard civil liberties
while strengthening the US Department of Justice
so it can better detect and disrupt terrorist threats.”
The Patriot Act Reauthorization created the new
Assistant Attorney General for National Security,
allowing the Department of Justice to bring
national security, counterterrorism, counterintelli-
gence, and foreign intelligence surveillance opera-
tions under the mantle of a single authority. What’s
more, the bill enhanced penalties for terrorism fi-
nancing and closed a loophole concerning terrorist
financing
through
“hawalas”
(informal
money
transfer systems) rather than traditional financial
institutions.”15 The bill also included the Combat
Methamphetamine Act of 2005, which introduced
safeguards that will make it more difficult to obtain
precursor chemicals for methamphetamine manu-
facturing by placing limits on large-scale purchases
of over-the-counter drugs used in the manufacture
of meth. It also increases penalties for trafficking
in methamphetamine and requires stores to keep
these ingredients behind the counter or in locked
display cases.
USA Patriot Act Sunset Extension Act
of 2009
In October 2009, despite expectations to the con-
trary, President Obama and Attorney General Eric
Holder expressed support for the congressional re-
authorization
of
three
controversial
provisions
scheduled to “sunset” at the end of 2009. Both
the House and the Senate Judiciary Committees
have agreed on separate bills that would address
the expiring provisions and make other amend-
ments to national security laws. On December 19,
2009, all three provisions were “temporarily” ex-
tended until February 28, 2010, citing concerns
about the “legislation’s potential detrimental effects
to national security.” The controversial provisions
include the “National Security Letter” (NSL)
provision, which lowers the evidentiary require-
ments for NSLs, allowing the FBI to require Inter-
net
service
providers, banks, and
credit
card
reporting companies to turn over sensitive informa-
tion about their customers and patrons. Most egre-
gious to its critics is the “blanket gag order” that
prohibits recipients of NSLs from discussing FBI
record demands. Most challenges to this provision
have been based on violations of the First and Four-
teenth Amendments. Another provision set to ex-
pire permits the government to use roving wiretaps to
monitor phone lines or Internet accounts that a
terrorist suspect might be using, “whether or not
others who are not suspects also regularly use
them.” Once authorities get “roving wiretaps”
court orders (basically wiretaps on people, not
phones) they are authorized to follow a target
who switches phone numbers or phone companies,
rather than having to apply for a new warrant each
time. By 2009 the FBI had used it 140 times. An-
other provision, referred to as the lone wolf provi-
sion, allows the FBI to get a court order to wiretap
a terrorism suspect who is not connected to any
terrorist group or government. However, it only
applies to non-U.S. persons and as of the end of
2009 had not been used. Finally, the “Material
Support Statute” has been targeted for criminalizing
the “providing of support” to terrorists. This is de-
fined as “any tangible or intangible good,” service,
or advice to a terrorist or designated group. Tangi-
ble things can include business and customer re-
cords, diaries, and computers. It criminalizes a
wide variety of activities, whether or not they actu-
ally or intentionally further terrorist goals or orga-
nizations. FBI used this authority more than 250
times between 2004 and 2009.16
Extraordinary Rendition
In recent years “extraordinary rendition,” better
known as just rendition, has been one of the most
controversial tactics used by the federal government
against terrorists. Rendition is a rather simple pro-
cess that entails apprehending suspects in any part of
the world and then transporting them back to the
United States where they will be forced to appear

before state or federal court.17 Although its incep-
tion is typically credited back to the late 1980s
of the Reagan administration (others suggest the
Clinton White House began it in 1995) when it
was authorized as a method for capturing drug traf-
fickers, terrorists, and others, its roots date back
more than a century. Sometimes referred to as the
Ker-Frisbie Doctrine, modern rendition is based on
two U.S. Supreme Court decisions in 1886 and
1952. In 1886 a federal agent forcibly kidnapped
Frederick Ker from Lima, Peru, and transported
him back to Cook County, Illinois, to stand trial
for larceny and embezzlement. His subsequent
challenge based on the due process clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment led the U.S. Supreme
Court decision to rule in Ker v. Illinois (119 U.S.
436) that American courts were not interested in
the manner in which a defendant comes to stand
before them, and he was duly convicted and sen-
tenced under proper procedures. This was followed
in 1952 by the Frisbie v. Collins Supreme Court
ruling (342 U.S. 519), in which the defendant
Shirley Collins was abducted in Chicago and
brought to Michigan to stand trial for murder. Fol-
lowing his conviction he appealed his sentence cit-
ing the federal Kidnapping Act and argued he
should be freed due to the manner he was “forcibly
seized, handcuffed, blackjacked” and taken to
Michigan.18 The doctrine once more was a target
of a U.S. Supreme Court case in 1992, after a Mex-
ican doctor and citizen named Alvarez Machain,
indicted for participating in the kidnapping and
murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena (U.S. v.
Machain, 504 U.S. 655), was abducted from Mexico
and brought to the United States in a covert DEA
operation. During the high court proceedings it re-
jected the argument that this type of abduction un-
dermined the purpose of extradition treaties and
upheld the notion that U.S. courts have jurisdiction
over a criminal defendant regardless how the defen-
dant is brought to court.
However, there are a number of observers who
would suggest that what was once a tool that served
its purpose “in a more carefully monitored form”
was transformed under the Bush administration into
“an abomination.”19 Rendition has received its
harshest criticism for its affiliation with black sites
(secret detention centers), operated by the CIA out-
side U.S. territory and jurisdiction, and where many
allegations of abuse and mistaken identities and ab-
ductions of “alleged unlawful enemy combatants”
have taken place. President Bush first acknowl-
edged the existence of black sites in the autumn
of 2006. They were closed by Obama in January
2009. However, as late as June 2009, President
Obama still supported rendition. Around that time
there were several legal challenges to the CIA in-
terrogation program working their way through the
court system. One of the chief barriers to any liti-
gation surrounding this process has been the official
stance that the existence of rendition is a state se-
cret; therefore, a victim cannot sue the government
or ask for an apology. More recently a judge in
California rejected claims of “blanket state secrecy”
by the Justice Department in the cases of five ren-
dition victims.20
Military Tribunals
In November 2001, President George W. Bush is-
sued an executive order authorizing the creation of
military tribunals to try noncitizens on charges of
terrorism. While many supporters of the new secu-
rity proposals claim that “extraordinary times call
for extraordinary measures,” civil libertarians have
expressed outrage at some of the post-9/11 mea-
sures, particularly plans to permit suspected foreign
terrorists to be tried by military tribunals. Military
tribunals have rarely been used outside military cir-
cles and are regarded as rather sinister by liberals and
civil libertarians. Recalling the sessions of the Star
Chamber in Tudor England (fifteenth century),
military tribunals are held in secret and afford de-
fendants fewer rights than regular courts do. In
these trials, a panel of military judges has the lati-
tude to decide guilt or innocence without a unani-
mous vote and can even impose the death penalty.
Once defendants are sentenced, they have little re-
course, being barred from appealing to a higher
court. A verdict of a military tribunal can be over-
turned only by the president or the secretary of
defense.

353

The United States has used military tribunals
as far back as the Mexican-American War (1846–
1848) and the Civil War (1861–1865), when by
some accounts almost 4,000 military tribunals
might have been carried out.21 Most prominently
one was used to try the Lincoln assassins in 1865
(see Chapter 7). The United States has not tried
foreigners accused of violating the rules of law in a
military tribunal since Nazi saboteurs were tried,
convicted, and executed during World War II.
However, this process was allowed to go forward
only because Congress had declared war against
Germany. Only Congress can declare war. After
9/11 President Bush did not ask Congress to de-
clare war. However, Congress enacted an Autho-
rization for the Use of Military Force. The
administration treated this as if it gave it same carte
blanche that a declaration of war would have given
them—to treat the hunt for terrorists as the “war
on terror.” Among the powers that come with an
actual declaration of war is the ability to use mili-
tary tribunals to try those who violated the rules of
war. In 2003 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals
rejected the president’s claim that he had constitu-
tional authority as commander in chief to decide
who is an enemy of the United States. Following
the appeals process, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled
in June 2004 that the president did not have the
power to order individuals considered enemy
combatants locked up for an indefinite period. In
Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, the Court “reaffirmed the
principle of habeas corpus” noting “the practice
of arbitrary imprisonment … in all ages is one of
the favorite and most formidable instruments
of tyranny.”22 Non-U.S. citizens detained at
Guantanamo Bay could now contest their captiv-
ity in U.S. courts (but did not apply to foreign
detainees held elsewhere). Furthermore, anyone in
U.S. custody, whether they were citizens or for-
eigners, has the right to challenge the basis for
their incarceration. In the end, the U.S. Constitu-
tion protects all prisoners from military courts
when there is no declaration of war. It has thus
been established that all of those detained on ter-
rorism charges since 9/11 have the right to be tried
in federal courts.
Torture and the Law
Brutal forms of interrogation are nothing new to
the criminal justice system. Criminal justice officials
have used torture for interrogations for centuries.
One needs look no further than the medieval in-
quisition in Spain and America’s Salem witch trials.
In the modern era the Wickersham Commission
reported in 1931 that it found a pattern of brutality
across the United States and that police all over
country used torture (29 major cities). In 1944’s
Ashcraft v. Tennessee the Supreme Court struck
down confessions secured by relay interrogations
under bright lights. Ashcraft had been interrogated
continuously for 36 hours until he admitted killing
his wife.23
After 9/11 “the White House made torture its
secret weapon in the war on terror.”24 Authorized in
the wake of 9/11, evidence suggest that torture and
degrading punishments were first documented at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, then Afghanistan, and fi-
nally in Iraq with the most notorious and best
documented cases of abuse.25 The public supported
“enhanced
interrogation”
until
confronted
by
photos of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib Prison first
shown on CBS’s 60 Minutes in April 2004. The
scandal involved Iraqi detainees held at the Abu
Ghraib prison near Baghdad between October and
December 2003. Ultimately several guards were
convicted and went to prison after the release of
the pictures. Nonetheless it tarnished the U.S. image
and its claims of owning the moral high ground.
From the law enforcement perspective torture
often produces false confessions, or leads the wrong
people to be punished while the actual perpetrators
go free, leaving the public with doubts about
whether duress figured in even legitimate confes-
sions. In the month after 9/11 the use of torture
to foil potential attacks had a 45% approval rating;
by 2005 it had fallen to 39%.
Torture not only violates the Geneva Conven-
tions but also violates a number of constitutional
protections against torture, although “somewhat
indirectly.”26 From a purely criminal justice perspec-
tive torture can be interpreted to violate the Fourth
Amendment restrictions on search and seizure and
354

protections against arbitrary arrests and “outrages of
the body.” What’s more, torture some have argued
violates the Fifth Amendment protection against
self-incrimination, “guarding against compelled tes-
timony and coerced confessions.” It can also be
construed that it violates the Sixth Amendment
guarantee of legal representation, the Fifth and Four-
teenth Amendments requiring “due process of law,”
and the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against
“cruel and unusual punishment.” Even the U.S.
State Department prohibits torture by law in
America as well as its use as a matter of policy and
as a tool of state authority. In 1996 more bite was
put into the laws against torture with the passage of
the 1996 War Crime Act (18 USC 2441), which
established in law the standards upheld by the 1949
Geneva Conventions. Therefore, by federal law U.S.
criminal jurisdiction is over any act of torture “com-
mitted by a U.S. national, no matter where the act
occurs.”27
President Obama fulfilled one of his campaign
promises in January 2009 when he announced a
ban on “enhanced interrogation” techniques that
had been acceptable tactics in the previous admin-
istration, including prohibition against waterboard-
ing, sleep deprivation (up to 11 days in some cases),
and most other aspects of the former interrogations
policy. But to be fair, many of the most egregious
practices of the Bush era had already been corrected
by the end of his presidency. Obama would expand
the ban to include prohibiting inhumane treatment
of prisoners by government officials and the closing
of the CIA’s network of “black site” prisons that
reached from Poland to Thailand.28
In the aftermath of 9/11 and the USA Patriot Act the
United States came under fire for violating the Geneva
Conventions. The Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions
were written and ratified following the civilian carnage
that accompanied World War II. The United States ratified
them in 1955. Their stated purpose was to codify interna-
tional norms and offer special protections to captured
soldiers and civilians living under military occupation. Both
identify specific forms of treatment that are prohibited
and affirm the responsibility of military authorities to
actively protect enemy prisoners and those civilians under
their control. Article 31 of the Fourth notes, “No physical
or moral coercion shall be exercised against protected
persons, in part to obtain information from them or their
parties.”29 The Conventions directly and indirectly prohibit
many of the practices that featured prominently in the
prison scandal at Abu Ghraib, including prohibitions
against the use of violence to control inmates, coercive
interrogations, prolonged solitary confinement, dark cells,
and the use of photographs to humiliate prisoners.
Although these actions occurred far from American
shores, Article VI of the U.S. Constitution asserts that when
the U.S. government ratifies such treaties they become
part of the “supreme law of the land.”30
Department of Homeland Security
Just one month after the 9/11 attacks President
George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13688,
creating the Office of Homeland Security and
Homeland Security Council. The creation of the
new cabinet position—the Department of Home-
land Security (DHS)—was supposed to reorganize
the American security community. However, the
CIA and the FBI “arguably precipitated the organi-
zational crisis managed to maintain their indepen-
dence from the DHS juggernaut.”31 DHS is now
the third largest federal agency just behind the
Department of Veteran Affairs and the Department
of Defense in size. Former Pennsylvania governor
(1995–2001) Tom Ridge was selected as its first
director with the mandate to develop and coordi-
nate a comprehensive national strategy to protect
the United States against terror threats or attacks.
The passage of the Homeland Security Act of
2002 abolished the Office of Homeland Security
and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
was established in its stead. Ridge continued as the
first secretary of the DHS; he resigned at the end of
2004. By 2003 the department had some 180,000
employees. But critics argued that the existence of
the DHS was only the “the first step toward the
erasure of the principle of keeping domestic and
foreign intelligence separate.”32
By 2004 the DHS claimed that it had established
“connectivity” in every state as well as with National
Guard units, police forces, local emergency services,
and private security operators in all major cities.33 In
2005 Ridge was succeeded by Michael Chertoff. The

DHS consists mainly of components transferred from
other cabinet departments because of their role in
homeland security, including the U.S. Secret Service,
the Coast Guard, Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment
(ICE),
Federal
Emergency
Management
Agency (FEMA), and others. ICE is the largest inves-
tigative arm of the DHS and is responsible for the
enforcement of immigration policy and identifying
criminals and organizations involved in human smug-
gling and trafficking. More than half of the agencies
under the DHS have police powers. However, the
organizational status of the FBI and the CIA were not
changed, allowing them to keep their cherished
autonomy. State and local governments are expected
to rely on their law enforcement groups as first re-
sponders (rather than federal agencies) in case of ter-
rorist attacks as well as protecting against them. With
the Obama administration taking office in 2009,
Chertoff passed the reins of directorship to former
Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano on January 21.

Criminal Terrorism Enforcement
in America since 9/11: Success
or Failure?
In 2001 Attorney General John Ashcroft reportedly
told the FBI Director Robert Mueller that “The
chief mission of U.S. law enforcement … is to
stop another attack and apprehend any accomplices
to terrorists before they hit us again.”34 In the years
following 9/11 the Bush administration asserted
that its counterterrorism strategy in the United
States was responsible for preventing any further
attacks on American soil. Gauging from the lack
of successful foreign terrorist attacks on American
soil since 9/11, the country’s criminal terrorism en-
forcement apparatus has been doing something
right or has been lucky. However, this claim needs
closer scrutiny beginning with the round-up of
Arab and Muslim nationals who were required to
register in the days following the attacks. More than
8,000 were interviewed by the FBI and over 5,000
were incarcerated in “preventive detention.” Of
these 13,000 not one was convicted of a terrorist
crime.35 One must consider the overwhelming po-
litical pressure on politicians to stop another attack
on America. There is little doubt that the govern-
ment overreacted in a number of instances and that
evidence shows that the Bush administration was
responsible for a number of abuses in the poorly
defined war on terror; nonetheless, during the
next election “no serious Democrat presidential
candidate in 2004 had the courage to speak out
against their illegal practices.”36
The year 2009 produced the highest number
of terror charges since 9/11. According to one
Associated Press (AP) survey, 54 defendants were
charged with federal terrorism-related charges. By
all accounts the number of arrests surged after
September 2009, ending the year with the attemp-
ted Christmas Day bombing by the “underpants
bomber” on a Detroit-bound jet. On September 24
alone charges were announced in five separate ter-

cases
in
Illinois,
New
York,
North
Carolina, and Texas. There is, however, a lack of
consensus as to what constitutes a terrorism case.
The AP study claims to have used a “rigorous stan-
dard
that
produced

count.”37
Charges that made the list included conspiring to
provide material support to terrorists, conspiring to
murder people abroad, and conspiracy to use a
weapon of mass destruction. However, what is cu-
rious are the cases left out, including the Army psy-
chiatrist suspected in the Fort Hood military base
shootings, who faces nonterrorism-related murder
charges by military prosecutors. Also missing are

five youths from the Washington, DC, area charged
in Pakistan. More recently the Justice Department
was asked to provide a figure of its own. However,
its only response was that more defendants were
charged that year than any since the attacks.38
Medical Marijuana and Drug Laws
With marijuana arrests at a record high in 2007
(43,000 more than the year before) and constituting
47.5% of national drug arrests, a number of law en-
forcement agencies were taking the drug more seri-
ously. According to NORML, the group supporting
the legalization of marijuana, the rise could be attrib-
uted to a combination of factors including the result
of federal justice assistance grant systems, which tend
to push local police toward meeting certain perfor-
mance levels, rather than “on the harder drug of-
fenses they would prefer to pursue.”39 Nonetheless,
the expansion of medical marijuana has become one
of the more contentious debates over the last decade.
It has been the subject of the long-simmering con-
troversy over the legality of state laws permitting
medical marijuana use, although it is still classified
under the 1970 Federal Controlled Substances Act
as a drug in the highest category for potential abuse.
Despite numerous studies testifying to its therapeutic
qualities by patients and doctors, federal prosecutors
refused to budge from their prohibition approach
until the end of the Bush administration in 2008.
The election of President Barack Obama to the
White House brought a more pragmatic leader into
the drug debate. In 2009, a reversal of the previous
policy was announced by Attorney General Eric H.
Holder, asserting that the U.S. Justice Department
would not enforce federal laws that conflicted with
state laws on the possession of marijuana, nor would
they prosecute medical marijuana distributors who
complied with state laws. This was in sharp contrast
to the previous administration’s stated policy of zero
tolerance for marijuana, regardless of state laws.40
A Zogby poll in 2009 revealed that 52% of vo-
ters would support legalizing, taxing, and regulating
the growth and sale of marijuana.41 In May 2009
President Obama’s new drug czar, former Seattle
Police Chief R. Gil Kerlikowske, took office, vowing
that the new administration would desist using the
expression “war on drugs” due in part because it im-
plied that the government was at war with American
citizens over this issue.42 The goal of President
Obama and his new czar was to change the country’s
drug-control strategy by “redirecting some of its re-
sources into prevention and treatment and away from
law enforcement and anti-trafficking efforts, which
had consumed 75 percent to 90 percent of the budget
during the Bush administration.”43 President Obama
also announced that the position of drug czar would
no longer be a cabinet-level position. Although the
president’s new drug policy strategy would be re-
leased with his budget in February 2010, insiders offer
that of America’s estimated 25 million substance abu-
sers, only 2 million are in treatment, and the new
administration wants to triple that, partly by devoting
more money and through other tactics such as inte-
grating addiction treatment into the primary health
care system.
According to critics, regulations and protocol for
this shift in marijuana policy have not been fully
developed as well as who could grow it or buy it.
In California, with the country’s oldest medical
marijuana program (1996), 56% of the voters support
it, and in 2010 Los Angeles alone had close to 600
dispensaries, which some claim is more than the
number
of
the
city’s
Starbucks
coffeehouses.
America is not the only country revisiting its mari-
juana laws. In June 2009 the Mexican legislature
voted to decriminalize possession of small amounts
of marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, and other
drugs for personal use, and just two months later
Argentina’s Supreme Court prohibited the incarcer-
ation of individuals for marijuana possession. Officials
have agreed that major traffickers should be targeted
and that more drug treatment programs should be
provided to keep addicts out of the criminal justice
system.44
According to a 2010 New Jersey measure pa-
tients would be granted access to marijuana available
through state-monitored dispensaries. In response to
critics of medical marijuana, New Jersey lawmakers
claim the measure will be the most restrictive in the
country because it would only grant doctors the au-
thority to prescribe it for a list of serious chronic

illnesses that include cancer, AIDS, muscular dystro-
phy, and multiple sclerosis. What’s more, it prohib-
ited patients from growing marijuana and using it
anywhere in public. Experts have compared the pro-
posed regulations to the strict conditions attached to
the distribution of medically prescribed opiates such
as morphine and OxyContin. The bill’s sponsor
hoped “this will become a model for other states
because it balances the compassionate use of medical
marijuana while limiting the number of ailments that
a physician can prescribe it for.”45
Once home to the country’s toughest drug laws,
New York has jumped on the bandwagon to ease
drug laws away from maximum-minimum sen-
tences. Although the strictest provisions of the state’s
famously draconian drug laws had been removed in
2004, in March 2009 New York Governor David
Paterson and legislative leaders announced a move-
ment to reduce the state’s drug laws, reversing the
trend that began in 1973 when Governor Nelson
Rockefeller lobbied for strict laws as part of a Re-
publican effort to fight the rising popularity of rec-
reational drugs in America. This and similar steps in
other states were part of a trend across the country
that saw a movement toward alternatives to impris-
onment as a way of cutting the enormous budgets
required to incarcerate tens of thousands of indivi-
duals for minor drug-related crimes. It was also part
of a trend that gave judges more discretion in sen-
tencing some nonviolent offenders and lower felony
offenders to alternatives such as local jail, probation,
parole, or military-style shock camps. In New York
alone it was estimated that this move would reduce
the prison population by more than 10,000 addi-
tional inmates (at costs of $45,000 per year per in-
mate) and save millions of dollars by offering
residential drug treatment ($15,000) at one third of
the amount it costs to house an inmate.46
LAW ENFORCEMENT
One police historian recently noted that on 9/11
“policing in America moved out of the community
policing era and into the era of homeland security,”
leading to the “largest reorganization of the federal
bureaucracy since World War Two.”47 What has
become clear is that the most successful method
for detecting and prosecuting terrorism cases is the
use of traditional crime-fighting strategies.48 Police
historian Samuel Walker has suggested the current
era is “a critical time in local policing,” noting such
new challenges as “taking a larger role in national
counterterrorism strategy and absorbing deep bud-
get cuts to reintegrating veterans returning to the
ranks from wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.”49
The International Association of Chiefs of
Police (IACP) issued a white paper in 2004 that
was critical of the National Strategy for Homeland
Security, asserting that the “national strategy” re-
leased in 2002 was developed by mostly federal
departments and despite claims to the contrary
made by the Bush administration, it was a “national
strategy” conceived without the feedback of local,
state, and tribal police agencies and thus it was for
all intents and purposes a federal strategy and not a
national one.50
At the federal level, the passage of the Intelli-
gence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act in
2005 required the FBI to create a National Intelli-
gence Workforce requiring every new agent hired
in the future have intelligence as well as police
training.51 In the years since 9/11 police forces at
the federal and state levels have been expanding
their databases at an unprecedented rate. In April
2009 the FBI joined 15 states in collecting DNA
samples from detained immigrants and those await-
ing trial. The FBI database of 6.7 million profiles
was expected to increase from 80,000 new entries a
year to 1.2 million by 2012.52 Police officials expect
these to solve more violent crimes pointing to the
fact that the database had already helped convict
thousands
(and
exonerated
several
hundred
others).53 However, there is still a debate about
whether having such a large database poses poten-
tial privacy concerns. On one hand, police and pro-
secutors enjoy having a larger pool of suspects,
while on the other, civil libertarians and other acti-
vists have pointed to Fourth Amendment privacy
concerns and fears that we are becoming a “genetic
surveillance society.”

In recent years DNA has become an even more
integral part of the evidence-gathering process. For
example, at least 16 states now collect DNA from
guilty misdemeanants and in 35 states minors are
required to provide samples on convictions (and
in some states upon arrest).54
Assault Weapons and Line of Duty
Deaths in the Twenty-First Century
In most states gun dealers are monitored by federal
firearms inspectors instead of state or local police.
That means there are 600 monitors for roughly
115,000 gun dealers. In most cases they can only
make one visit per year. In November 2009 police
chiefs attending a meeting of the Police Executive
Research Forum took up the issue of guns and
crime. What was most troubling for the chiefs was
the number of high-powered assault rifles on the
streets. With the expiration of the 10-year assault
weapon ban in 2004, police chiefs noticed an in-
crease of these weapons. More than 130 police
chiefs and officials answered a survey that found a
37% increase in assault weapons in street crime.55
Many of these weapons end up pointing in the
direction of police officers.
The end of the first decade of the twenty-first
century was accompanied by an increase in the num-
ber of police officers killed in the line of duty by
gunfire, increasing 24% over the previous year. As
of the middle of December 2009, 47 officers had
died from gunshots across the country. The year be-
fore saw “only” 38 killed, which was the lowest
number of gunfire deaths since 1956. What has
most surprised experts has been the numbers of po-
lice officers that have been specifically targeted by
shooters. This rising problem was highlighted by
the ambush murder of four police officers in a Seattle
coffee shop in November. This was preceded by the
murder of four Oakland police officers in March,
three in Pittsburgh, and two in Okaloosa County,
Florida, that April.56 A number of researchers have
argued that with more guns there are more gun-
crimes, making it more likely that police officers
will be shot in the line of duty. But, this is not
true across the board. Pennsylvania, for example,
led the nation in gun-related officer deaths in
2009, yet it had some of the nation’s strictest gun
laws. On the other hand, Louisiana, Oklahoma,
and Kentucky have had few if any gun-related
deaths of police that year and have some of the
most lenient laws. Nonetheless, the spokesman for
the Officers Memorial Fund optimistically reported
that “[t]he chances of being killed in the line of duty
are lower” than many previous years of the modern
era. This is especially true of gun-related deaths. In
1973 there were 600,000 police officers and 156
gun-related deaths. In 2009 there were 900,000 of-
ficers and 47 deaths. Much of the decline is attrib-
uted to better police protective equipment and
better and faster medical treatment.
The last time the U.S. Supreme Court examined the Sec-
ond Amendment was the case of United States v. Miller
in 1939, which ruled that a bootlegger who was arrested
for transporting a sawed-off shotgun across state lines
violated the intentions of the amendment. In the summer
of 2008 the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 vote that the
Washington, DC, handgun possession ban was unconsti-
tutional. What made this reversal of the 1976 law (one
of the nation’s toughest, which prohibited residents from
registering and purchasing handguns in almost all cir-
cumstances) so unique was that it was the first time in
American history that the court ruled that the Second
Amendment guarantees an individual’s right to own a
gun for self-defense. On one hand Justice Antonin Scalia
noted that the Second Amendment “surely elevates
above all other interests the rights of law-abiding, re-
sponsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and
home,” while dissenting Justice Stephen G. Breyer
warned that the decision “threatens to throw into doubt
the constitutionality of gun laws throughout the United
States.” President Bush applauded the decision, while
presidential candidate and eventual nominee Senator
Barack Obama feared the rise in gun-related violence
in “crime-ravaged” neighborhoods. The fallout from this
decision is still unclear as of 2010.57
Policing in the Age of Terrorism:
Getting By with Less
In his first two terms as mayor of New York City,
Michael R. Bloomberg has supervised the “greatest
expansion of police surveillance of political activity
CRIMIN AL JUSTICE IN TH E AG E OF TERRORISM (2000– 2010)

in at least half a century.”58 The mayor’s response
to this claim was that the federal government was
not doing enough to protect the city from possible
terrorist attacks, so it was necessary to mount inter-
nal intelligence operations. As 2009 came to a close
the NYPD was contemplating how to adjust to the
pending decline from 41,000 at its peak a decade
ago to 34,304 officers ( 16%). What’s more, almost
1,000 officers are tasked to counterterrorism-related
duties. On the bright side, New York City’s crime
rate continues to decline. During the first half of
2009 there were only 200 murders, compared to
2,200 in 1990, a peak year for homicide. Observers
have marveled at how this storied force has been
able to improve on critical aspects of crime fighting
of late, especially considering the reduction in offi-
cers and its new responsibilities in the terrorism
arena. Among the tactics that worked well has
been “predictive policing,” which relies on utilizing
crime statistics and other data to predict where
crime will take place next. Police Chief Raymond
W. Kelly claims some inspiration from the noted
nineteenth-century
military
tactician
Carl
von
Clausewitz, “who advised massing forces at certain
important points, instead of deploying scarce per-
sonnel thinly along an entire enemy line.”59
NYPD is not alone among police departments
having to do more with less. Many police forces are
suffering from budget increases unrelated to hiring
new officers. Much of the increase is due to the
soaring costs of salaries and skyrocketing increase
in pension and health care benefits built into recent
police contracts. For example, the Houston Police
Department, one of the nation’s largest police
forces, has fewer officers per square mile, and the
number of officers has remained the same from
2004 to 2009, yet its budget increased 40% due to
the aforementioned issues. Houston is caught in a
no-win situation. Despite a violent crime rate that is
among the highest in the nation, the federal gov-
ernment recently denied it stimulus funding for
more police academy classes due to the city’s fiscal
health and its decline in crime over the past several
years.60 In late December 2009 the Colorado
Springs Police Department was forced to reassign
three full-time helicopter pilots and auction off its
two Bell helicopters. Similar budget cuts have led
the Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Oakland, California, po-
lice departments to ground their helicopters as well.
Smaller departments have eliminated their helicop-
ter units altogether. It costs a city almost $500 per
hour to man and fuel a helicopter. Helicopters have
long served as the eye in the sky for urban police
tracking suspects through labyrinthine streets, and
as one law enforcement officer lamented, “There
is no replacement for a helicopter overhead,
particularly when violent and felony crimes are
unfolding.”61
Police Tactics
Civil libertarians continue to rail against law en-
forcement tactics such as “stop-and-frisk,” calling
it racist and unacceptable while claiming it fails to
deter crime. Supporters of this strategy cite the suc-
cess rate of the NYPD in reducing crime when it
implemented the strategy in the 1990s during the
administration of Mayor Rudy Giuliani. More re-
cently Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly esti-
mated that his officers stopped as many as 600,000
people in 2009 alone, with only 10% being ar-
rested.62 By most accounts more people are being
stopped and questioned than in previous years.
While more than one million (mostly Hispanic
and black males) have been subjected to this tactic,
few have been found guilty of any crimes. At the
same time these stops are increasing, crime rates are
falling.
According to Commissioner Kelly, “This is a
proven law enforcement tactic to fight and deter
crime,
one
that
is
authorized
by
criminal
procedure.”63 Police in Philadelphia adopted the
tactic in 2007–2008, nearly doubling the amount
of stops over the previous year; supporters cited it
for a drop in crime. Proponents of “stop and frisk”
refer to a 1968 Supreme Court decision that “es-
tablished the benchmark of ‘reasonable suspicion’—
a standard that is lower than the ‘probable cause’
needed to justify the arrest.”64 Nonetheless, some
major police departments either do not release or
keep records of police stops, a barrier to making any
conclusive comparisons.

Police departments are constantly looking for new “less-
than-lethal” weapons for their twenty-first-century
arsenals. One of the old standbys has been the Taser.
However a 2009 federal appeals court decision ruled in a
California case “that the police can be liable for using
one” after an unarmed person was Tasered during a
traffic stop and fell, breaking some of his teeth. The court
ruled that the device “constituted excessive force” when
used against an unarmed man who did not pose a threat.
It also concluded that the officer could not receive
immunity for using it.65
The FBI and 9/11: A Prisoner of
History?
Even before the two jets hit the twin towers, the
FBI had been elevated by law and presidential direc-
tives to America’s lead agency against terrorism. Un-
der the Clinton administration, law enforcement had
emerged as the nation’s preferred weapon against
terror. FBI historian Richard Gid Powers suggests
that where in the past the Marines would have
been sent in, the Reagan, H. W. Bush, and Clinton
administrations “had ordered the FBI to investigate
embassy bombings, barracks explosions, and assaults
on American warships” in the 1980s and 1990s.66 In
2001 the agency had 27,000 agents and support
workers with a budget of $3.4 billion. By the time
Freeh retired in 2001 he had persuaded Congress to
raise the FBI counterterrorism budget from $79
million to $372 million (an increase of 471%).67
The 9/11 attacks sounded a clarion call for
change at every level of law enforcement, particu-
larly at the federal level. On that September day the
FBI had only one analyst working on Al Qaeda.68
By 2003 not much had changed, when out of
11,500 field agents only six were Muslims.69 In
the fall of 2002 demands were made for a new
government enquiry into 9/11, resulting in the
U.S. 9/11 Commission chaired by former New
Jersey Governor Thomas H. Kean (1982–1990).
The commission conducted one of the largest gov-
ernment investigations in American history. After
completing the investigation, the chairman deliv-
ered his verdict that the “FBI failed,” lamenting,
“This is an agency that does not work.” Since
then, much of the blame for what turned out to
be a colossal intelligence failure has been directed
at the FBI. What made matters worse were revela-
tions that several FBI agents had prior knowledge of
possible attacks, while others claimed they were re-
stricted in their efforts to detect the hijackers due to
the dismantlement of much of the intelligence-
gathering system following the Watergate scandal
of the 1970s. If there was a smoking gun on 9/11
that could have averted this tragedy, “it went off
back in the 1970s” during the Carter administration,
said one FBI scholar, a period when its approval
rating dropped from 84% in 1965 to 37% in 1975.70
During the 1970s the investigations of the FBI
and CIA exposed some of FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover’s most nefarious efforts to repress political
dissent and in the process “convinced many in the
FBI that investigations of domestic groups were un-
constitutional and illegitimate.” As a result the FBI
refocused itself toward criminal cases under the
Ford and Carter administrations rather than the
political ones that so dominated the Nixon years.
As recently as 2002 FBI Director Robert Mueller
told a Senate Judiciary Committee “that fear of
political punishment over concerns about profiling
may have hindered the FBI’s investigation of
terrorists.”71 The events of the previous decades
had made the FBI “a prisoner of its history.”72 Un-
der FBI Director Louis Freeh, the bureau wanted to
prove it was most concerned with protecting civil
liberties and was a counterpoint to the Hoover FBI.
But probably more important was the fact that the
agency had made so many poor decisions and errors
in judgment in such high-profile cases as Ruby
Ridge and Waco, which ruined the careers of sev-
eral top-ranking agents. By most accounts this led
to a “risk aversion” culture in which FBI managers
found that the safest career choice was an avoidance
of unnecessary decisions.73
The retirement of FBI Director Louis Freeh in
June 2001 (his term would have expired in 2003),
shortly before the 9/11 attacks, concluded one of the
most controversial administrations in the history of
the agency. Despite the number of controversies
and missteps during his eight years at the helm, Freeh
could also point to some accomplishments during his
CRIMIN AL JUSTICE IN TH E AG E OF TERRORISM (2000– 2010)

administration. Under his leadership, the FBI hired
thousands of new agents, enjoyed better cooperation
with the Central Intelligence Agency, more than
doubled the FBI’s presence in other countries, and
secured a $3.44 billion crime-fighting budget, a 58%
increase over his first year in office. Freeh left a
mixed legacy as head of the FBI. While the FBI
did make great strides in increasing the diversity of
the bureau, adding more women and minorities, his
tenure as chief was mired in controversy. High-
profile embarrassments included the botched inter-
view with falsely accused Olympic bombing suspect
Richard Jewell; the investigation of a Pan-Am plane
crash; a series of domestic bombing cases; inefficiency
in the FBI crime lab; the Waco, Texas, and Ruby
Ridge, Idaho, shoot-outs; and security lapses in the
atomic weapons labs.
Current FBI Priorities
Changes for the FBI had been in the works even
before the departure of Louis Freeh. The FBI im-
plemented some of these modifications beginning
in July 2001, when the Justice Department’s inspec-
tor general was given permission to begin investiga-
tions of the bureau without needing the previously
required permission of the attorney general. In ad-
dition, a program was set up to give periodic poly-
graphs to agents with access to sensitive materials.
These changes followed a number of high-profile
embarrassments for the FBI, including the loss of
weapons and computers, the discovery of the
FBI-spy Robert Hanssen, and the bungled investi-
gation of former nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee.
However, the new legislation went even further.
Besides making it clear that the Justice Depart-
ment’s inspector general has jurisdiction over the
FBI, the bill includes provisions for the inclusion
of FBI employees under the Federal Whistleblower
Act, the creation of an FBI internal security divi-
sion, and other reporting requirements to Congress.

gence operations and espionage.

ternational partners.
10.

FBI’s mission.74
U.S. Air Marshals
The U.S. Air Marshals were “a nearly forgotten
force of 33 agents” until 9/11.75 While their official
number is classified, there are now an estimated
3,000 to 4,000 of them, operating out of the Trans-
portation Security Administration with a budget of
more than $780 million. However, the program has
been less than a rousing success and has been stung
by Congressional criticism for enforcing a dress
code that blows their covers, and three leaders
have been moved to four different parent agencies.
After the 9/11 attacks there was a rush to hire new
marshals and almost 200,000 applied. But perhaps
only one in 40 was accepted, making it tougher
than getting into Harvard.76 Prospective air mar-
shals were expected to pass top security clearance
background checks which included 10 years of
criminal history, credit reports, and interviews
with employers, neighbors, and relatives. This was
no guarantee that they would hire the best employ-
ees. A 2004 inspector’s report found 753 miscon-
duct cases over a 20-month period, with infractions
that included failed drug tests and sleeping on duty.
High-Tech Crime Fighting
Traditionally, people living in high crime districts
have been afraid to talk to the police or of even
being suspected of doing so. There have been
many incidents in which they have been targeted
by gang members and others. For law enforcement
it’s been an uphill battle against an “anti-snitching”
culture that made witnesses fear coming forward to
testify as witnesses to criminal acts. One recent
362

glimmer of hope has been a new program that al-
lows individuals to send anonymous text tips from
their cell phones. This, combined with an increase
in police patrol in violent neighborhoods, has
helped police gain more public trust leading to
progress in overcoming the anti-snitching attitude.
Over the past two years Boston became the first city
to heavily promote its use. Police claim to have
received more than 1,000 tips since then, including
several that provided leads that solved several prom-
inent murders.77 Individuals seem to be less reluc-
tant to text over dialing 911, since it provides more
anonymity. Police never see the tipster’s name or
phone number and the text messages are received
through a third-party server, “where identifying in-
formation is stripped out and they are assigned an
encrypted alias before being sent to the police.”
Anderson Software is among the leading providers
of this service, referred to as “text-a-tip programs.”
More than 400 police agencies are now utilizing it
including San Diego, Seattle, Miami, Tucson, and
Savannah. Police officials have been heavily pro-
moting the service in schools and have received
tips about drugs and weapons. “The system lets a
tipster send a message of up to 160 characters to the
police, who are then able to ask follow-up
questions.” What is most important is that “the
protection of the tipster is considered more impor-
tant than any one case.”
In December 2009 the San Jose police an-
nounced they were testing 18 “head-mounted
cameras” to record interactions with the public after
a series of complaints from citizens’ groups charging
police with unreasonable use of force. The 18 offi-
cers were required to start the cameras whenever
they began talking with citizens. They were similar
to the Bluetooth cell phone earpiece and were at-
tached by a headband above the ear.
Another emerging technology is focused on
ending high-speed chases. OnStar, a General Mo-
tors unit, makes GPS systems for cars. In 2008 it
introduced Stolen Vehicle Slowdown technology
that permits an operator to send a signal to the car
that will restrict the flow of gas and slow it down to
less than 5 mph. It was made available on almost
one million 2009 GM cars. Another company
called StarChase is testing a Pursuit Management
System, which it bills as a laser-guided launcher
on the front grill of a police car that can fire pro-
jectiles that stick to a fleeing vehicle that will allow
police to track it by GPS.78
Toward the end of the decade a growing num-
ber of sheriff’s departments and some metropolitan
police departments adopted iris scans that permitted
them to identify sex offenders, runaways, abducted
children, and even lost Alzheimer’s patients. It could
also be used to insure the correct prisoner was being
released from jail. By the end of 2007 over 2,100
departments in more than half the states were taking
digital photographs of eyes and storing the informa-
tion in a database that could be accessed to look for
missing persons. Compared to matching fingerprints,
which can take weeks, or months for DNA evi-
dence, an iris scan can be accomplished in seconds.
The pictures are taken by infrared cameras to record
up to 235 distinct details (compared to 70 details in a
fingerprint). What’s more, irises don’t change with
age, disease, or even Lasik eye surgery.79
Police have also jumped on the social network-
ing bandwagon, using sites such as YouTube,
Twitter, and MySpace to get information on law-
breakers. One new service is dubbed CrimeDex,
the brainchild of a former policeman who claims
it is a “Facebook for law enforcement.”80 By
2009 it was being used by over 1,000 law enforce-
ment agencies and numerous businesses and banks.
Members who pay a monthly fee are able to send in
information, photographs, and videos related to
possible crimes and make comparisons with data
from other agencies that may recognize certain pat-
terns or suspects. For example, it was successfully
used in a 2007 case involving a foreign national
who created fake ATM cards and was able to steal
hundreds of thousands of dollars from Wells Fargo
customers in California. Surveillance images posted
by a bank investigator on the Website were later
used to link him to other crimes in other states
and helped secure a federal conviction for identity
theft and money laundering.
Despite the positive developments in the brave
new world of cybercrime fighting, iris scanning,
and other new technologies, civil libertarians warn

that a lack of legal oversight, the potential for inva-
sion of privacy, and the potential for abuse or mis-
identification are some of the issues that will have to

CORRECTIONS
Much attention was devoted to a 2007 revelation,
based on a Census Bureau report for 2006, that
more than three times as many African Americans
live in prison cells as in college dormitories (not
including those living off-campus). The ratio was
only slightly better for Hispanics. That same year
one in 15 adult black men were incarcerated. On
average, states spend 7% on corrections budgets,
which is just behind health care, education, and
transportation. With costs for medical care skyrock-
eting by 10% each year, states and the federal gov-
ernment are grappling with cheaper alternatives to
incarceration. Nonetheless, as 2010 dawned, the
United States had the world’s highest incarceration
rate. With only 5% of the world’s population, the
United States now houses almost 25% of the
world’s reported prisoners; an imprisonment rate
of 756 per 100,000, almost five times the world’s
average (125 per 100,000). If one were to include
all adults in jail or on supervised releases, the rate
would be closer to 1 in every 31 adults.81
One of the more curious aspects of the “war on
crime” and the use of prisons is that as America’s
crime rate declined the total prison population con-
tinued to increase over the past two decades. Crim-
inologists and legal experts for the most part agree
that the high incarceration rate helped diminish
crime, but many assert that there were other factors
that should be considered including harsher sen-
tencing laws, the zealous commitment to combat-
ing illegal drugs, the lack of social safety nets, and a
legacy of racial tumult.82
There are a number of reasons why prisoners
are locked up in such numbers. Obviously their
criminal behavior is foremost. One must also con-
sider that over the past 30 years policy choices
driven by the electorate, elected officials, and repre-
sentatives of the criminal justice system have offered
few other alternatives for most crimes. Parole was
once viewed as the lever for reducing prison popu-
lations through good-time programs and the like.
However, in recent years get-tough policies are
sending parolees back to jail at an unprecedented
rate. As a result parole became the “key source be-
hind the policy” as various pieces of legislation were
passed to make it easier to send parolees back to jail.
Between 1983 and 2003 the proportion of parolees
returned to custody rose from 13% to 29%.83
However, there were some signs at the end of
2009 that a threshold had been reached as several
states with tight budgets have been forced to re-
think sentencing policies. While Florida continues
to adhere to strict sentencing polices and continues
to require all inmates to serve a large percentage of
the sentences, despite its toll on the state’s resources,
other states are moving in another direction.84 But
this pattern is slowly changing in some venues. For
example, in Mississippi, the truth-in-sentencing
laws that once required drug offenders to serve
85% of their time have been reduced to 25%.
Texas, for example, once had one of the lowest
parole rates in the country (as little as 15% just
five years ago). Today the rate is more than 30%,
in part due to a new strategy that had Texas vetting
the prison population for low-risk candidates that
could be paroled. In fact, Texas, once home to one
of the country’s largest prison populations, is actu-
ally experiencing a decline in its prison population.
This was unexpected to say the least and three new
prisons that had been scheduled for construction
have been taken off the drawing board. By 2005
Texas had reached an impasse—either spend half a
billion dollars to house a projected 17,000 new
prisoners each year or spend less than half of that
and reduce the prison population through treat-
ment programs. According to one journalist, Texas
“is becoming the unlikely new role model for a
prison reform movement spreading across the
country.”85 By most accounts this trend began in
2007 with what has been called the “reinvestment
movement.” The program has the benefit of sup-
port across the board and allows state funds to be

invested in alcohol, drug, and mental health pro-
grams to treat offenders rather than warehouse
them. As one observer put it, “States are learning
they just can’t build their way out of crime.”86
Now that so many states are facing major bud-
getary problems, states are looking to alternatives to
imprisonment. New York State, on the cusp of
repealing its draconian mandatory sentences, and
California, with a prison system so overcrowded
and underfunded that a federal judge recently or-
dered the state to release almost one third of its
158,00 prisoners by 2012, are just two of the states
looking for solutions. Michigan, New Jersey, and
North Carolina are either releasing prisoners who
have served minimum time or putting drug offen-
ders in treatment programs instead of in stir.87
The period of 1999–2005 is the last year that
the Bureau of Justice Statistics broke down state
prison populations by race and drug offense. Its
most interesting revelation was the decrease in the
number of black Americans ( 21%) in state prisons
for drug offenses; at the same time there has been an
increase in the number of whites ( 42%) convicted
of drug crimes, while Hispanic numbers stayed flat.
With drug offenders making up more than a quar-
ter of the prison population, some observers are
hoping that this is signaling a gradual change in
demographics. Explanations have varied. Some at-
tribute the new numbers to an increased emphasis
on prison alternatives by judges and prosecutors;
others suggest a shift from police focus from crack
cocaine to methamphetamines (most popular with
whites). Drug courts have become one popular al-
ternative, offering nonviolent offenders the option
of a strict substance abuse program and criminal
rehabilitation or incarceration behind prison bars.
Drug courts reportedly cost 10% to 30% less than
it costs to send someone to prison.88
The first drug court in the United States was introduced
in Dade County, Florida, in 1989. The concept was a re-
sponse to a federal mandate to reduce the state’s inmate
population or suffer the loss of federal funding. The
state’s Supreme Court directed a research program to
look for solutions. It turned out that a large proportion
of inmates had been imprisoned due to drug violations
and often found themselves in a revolving door of
recidivism that ultimately always led back to jail without
addressing the underlying causes of drug addiction. Thus,
it was determined that a program was necessary that
would bring drug treatment services and the criminal
justice system together. Typically a participant takes part
in a demanding routine of substance abuse treatment,
case management, drug testing, and probation supervi-
sion while reporting on a regular basis to scheduled
hearings held before a judge with expertise in the drug
court model. The drug treatment is supplemented by ad-
ditional services offering mental health treatment,
trauma and family therapy, job skills training, and other
“life-skill enhancement” services. All of this is accom-
plished with a minimal use of incarceration. Since the
1990s a number of studies support the contention that
“no other justice intervention can rival the results pro-
duced by drug courts.” A substantial body of research
demonstrates that drug courts “improve substance abuse
outcomes, substantially reduce crime, and produce
greater cost benefits than any other justice strategy.”89
By 2008 there were more than 2,147 drug courts in the
country. Former Director of the Office of U.S. National
Drug Control Policy General Barry McCaffrey is among
the growing number of supporters who highly endorse
the program, suggesting that, “If you don’t like paying
for jails, if you don’t like a waste of tax dollars, then
you’ll like the concept of drug courts. This is an initiative
that’s been working.”
The Second Chance Act
One looming challenge if new programs focusing
on alternatives to prison become de rigueur will be
the impact of the hundreds of thousands of ex-
convicts reentering society. Traditionally prisoners
upon release were given 50 dollars and a bus ticket
and sent on their way without preparation for what
came next. Typically a good percentage (more than
two thirds) would end up back in prison within
three years, through what some have termed the
“revolving door of recidivism.”90 What often goes
unstated is that almost half are returned for “tech-
nical violations” of parole that include not report-
ing to parole officers on time or failing drug tests.
In 2008 President Bush signed the Second
Chance Act 2007 (H.R. 1593) amending the
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of
1968 and designed to address the reintegration of
legions of ex-convicts back into society and lower
recidivism rates. Its goal was to improve reentry

programs for adult and juvenile offenders and devel-
oping new and better ones. The act was intended to
authorize essential parts of the administration’s Prison
Re-entry Initiative to help prisoners by expanding
job training and placement services, improving their
ability to find transitional housing, and helping
newly released prisoners get mentoring (including
from faith-based groups). President Bush hoped the
act would “give prisoners across America the second
chance for a better life.”91 One expert observed that
this was “an unexpected return to his original rheto-
ric of ‘compassionate conservatism’ that has so swiftly
dissipated upon his acquiring office.”92
The Aging Prison Population
One of the unintended consequences of get-tough
sentencing policies has been its impact on increasing
the aging prison population (whereas the challenge
twenty years ago was what to do with younger of-
fenders). Older offenders who commit violent
crimes have been serving longer sentences since the
1990s. Elderly prisoners represent the fastest growing
segment of the federal and state prison systems. This
is the first time in American history that the prison
system has had to face the challenges of a graying
prison population. With an aging population comes
a range of new treatment issues ranging from de-
mentia and cancer to incontinence and hyperten-
sion.93 A report by the National Institute of
Corrections in 2004 noted that the number of pris-
oners of ages 50 and over had increased 172.6% be-
tween
1992
and
2001
(41,000
to
113,000).
According to the most recent report by the Federal
Bureau of Justice Statistics, 4.3% of all inmates in
state, federal, and local jails were over 55 as of
mid-2008, a 23% increase since 2004. This trend
would continue throughout the next decade, in
part reflecting the general aging of the American
population. What’s more, this increase is more than
three times the increase in the overall number of
inmates (at only 7%). Other contributing factors
have included the get-tough reforms of the 1980s
and 1990s, three-strikes and truth-in-sentencing
laws—all contributing to more offenders locked up
behind bars for longer periods of times. As inmates
serve longer sentences it should not be surprising that
there is a surge in aging and sick inmates. What often
goes unstated is that prisoners are also probably living
longer due to better medical care, a reflection of
longer-living Americans on the outside.
Between 1999 and 2008 there was a 79% in-
crease in inmates 55 and older. It is expected that
this problem will only get worse, putting more bur-
dens on already underfunded prison systems. Among
the barriers to research in this arena is the fact that
every state defines geriatric prisoners differently (it is
generally regarded as 65 and older on the outside).
Furthermore, it has been documented that the prison
experience contributes to the aging process. Ulti-
mately older prisoners contract chronic illnesses and
experience disabilities at younger ages, making any
definition irrelevant. Others point to the fact that
besides normal aging problems elderly inmates have
more chronic illnesses due to lifestyle choices includ-
ing poor diets, risky behavior, drugs, smoking, and
alcohol consumption. These conditions are probably
exacerbated by lives spent in poverty and lacking
good health care. In addition elderly inmates face a
number of individual and environmental stressors in-
trinsic to their lives of crime than can aggravate ex-
isting health problems.94
Elderly inmates are at high risk in some facili-
ties for self-harm, suicide, and victimization by
other younger inmates. One recent study indicates
that it costs $70,000 to house an older inmate, al-
most two to three times what it costs for younger
ones. According to one interesting perspective the
rise in elderly is a reflection of the first wave of baby
boomers born in 1946 moving into their 60s and
“[ j]ust
as this demographic group
challenged
schools and public services decades ago, the pres-
ence of the baby boom is felt in jails and prison
today.”95 Others point to an increased level of
criminality among older Americans and get-tough
policies that “have ensnared some older in CJ sys-
tem,” pointing to the fact that sentencing policies
eliminated options such as probation and home ar-
rest. One alternative that has been considered is
separating younger from older prisoners. By most
accounts it would be a cheaper and healthier alter-
native. By and large elderly prisoners do not try to

escape, so they can be securely held in nursing
homes and nursing facilities. But this comes with
its own set of challenges.
Demonstrating that elderly citizens are just as capable of
murder as younger ones, on January 6, 2010, the Associ-
ated Press announced that an 89-year-old white suprem-
acist, who had been charged in a fatal shooting at the
Washington Holocaust Museum, had died while awaiting
trial. His medical records indicated that he had been suf-
fering from a range of health problems including sepsis
and chronic congestive heart failure. His death and
health problems confirm recent research on America’s
aging prison population demonstrating the numerous
health problems facing elderly prisoners as well as the
budgetary problems with caring for them in prison.
HIV, AIDS, and Mental Health Issues in
Prison
In 2004 the three leading causes of death in prison
were natural causes, AIDS, and suicide (double the
suicide rate of the general population). Prisoners
enter incarceration suffering a variety of maladies,
both physically and mentally. This is not a new
phenomenon. One merely needs to step back to
the eighteenth century when prison reformers lob-
bied for more hygienic conditions as they battled
“gaol fever.” The Centers for Disease Control esti-
mates that the AIDS rate is five times higher in
prison than in the general population. Prisons are
incubators for deadly diseases including tuberculo-
sis, Hepatitis C, and AIDS—what one expert has
referred to as a “perfect storm” for disease transmis-
sion, noting the proliferation of overcrowding, un-
protected sex, and needle sharing.96 It has been
almost 30 years since the beginning of the AIDS
epidemic, yet as of 2008 only 24 states required
testing all inmates for HIV at admission or during
custody.97 Nonetheless, once behind bars there are
many opportunities to contract AIDS through sex
or by sharing needles for drug use and tattooing.
More than a decade ago one health study commis-
sioned by Congress found 17% of all Americans
living with AIDS had passed through correctional
institutions in 1996.98 According to the most recent
Bureau of Justice report, 1.5% of the male prison
population had HIV or confirmed AIDS (about the
same as the previous year). As the rate of HIV and
AIDS among state prisoners fell from 100 to 25 per
100,000 between 1995 and 2001, the same period
saw the rate among the U.S. population drop from
29 to 9 per 100,000.99
In April 2009 New York passed legislation as
part of the state budget that will make chronically
and terminally ill patients eligible for early release
beginning in 2010. Many of them are part of an
increasingly aging prison population. To be consid-
ered, inmates had to be vetted to determine that
they were unable to pose a threat to society, “phys-
ically or cognitively.” The law expanded the list of
eligible inmates to include inmates convicted of vi-
olent crimes that included second-degree murder,
first-degree manslaughter, and sex offenses. How-
ever they must have already served half their sen-
tences.100 New York is among about a dozen states
to have enacted these programs since 2008.
Today 39 states have “compassionate release”
programs. When prisoners are released they are ex-
pected to be cared for by family members or placed
in nursing homes or hospices, with expenses mostly
covered by Medicare and Medicaid. However, by
most accounts, compassionate release programs
have had minimal impact up to now. For example,
New York only released seven in 2009, California
three, and Alabama four, despite an increase in ap-
plications. Many die waiting for parole. New York
adopted medical parole in 1992 at the height of the
AIDS crisis (364 released since then). New York
officials estimate it costs $150,809 a year to care
for a seriously ill inmate.
By most accounts the origins of how U.S. prisons and jails
were turned into “defacto insane asylums” can be found
in the early 1960s during an era when the “deinstitution-
alization movement” was in vogue.101 It was during this
period that the first psychotropic drugs for treating the
mentally ill were widely available. This led observers to
believe that instead of being warehoused in large state
mental hospitals such as the one that was portrayed in
Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1962), those
with mental issues could live and receive treatment in the
community. The main barrier to this way of thinking was
CRIMIN AL JUSTICE IN TH E AG E OF TERRORISM (2000– 2010)

the utter lack of funding for clinics and treatment. Many
states closed mental hospitals to save money without
making provisions for patients (in 1955 there were 559,000
patients in state mental hospitals, in 2004 72,000, even
though the population has grown by two thirds).102 As a
result many ended up on the streets and quickly found
themselves homeless and destitute, and many end up in
the criminal justice system, especially in recent years as
cities crack down on “quality of life offenses” such as
drinking in public, urinating in public, and panhandling.
Many become substance abusers. A 2002 study called the
Sentencing Project estimated that 700,000 of the 10 mil-
lion adults booked into local jails each year had symptoms
of mental illness. A typical pattern is for someone to cycle
in and out of jail dozens of times (referred to as “frequent
fliers”) without treatment until he or she commits a seri-
ous offense and lands in prison.
Today Florida, for example, has five times as many
mentally ill people in jails and prisons as in mental hos-
pitals. As one journalist recently noted, “It is hard to
write this without suspending disbelief; nevertheless it is
a fact that the three largest mental institutions in the
world are the Los Angeles County Jail, Rikers Island in
New York and Cook County Jail in Chicago.”103
Race, Ethnicity, and Prison Gangs in
the Twenty-First Century
American correctional facilities have been accorded
the distinction as the “most racially segregated” places
in America. Much of the segregation is the result of
prison policies seeking to prevent bloodshed by sepa-
rating various ethnic and racial groups, to avoid a
gang-based subculture that pits white gangs (Aryan
Brotherhood) against blacks (Black Guerrilla Family),
northern California Mexicans (nortenos such as La
Nuestra Familia) against southern California Mexicans
(surenos such as the Mexican Mafia), and so forth.
With little chance of breaking up prison gangs, prison
officials have opted to cluster the various groups for
protection. Since 9/11 illegal immigrants and other
noncitizens have become one of the fastest-growing
segments of the prison populations. What makes
prison so daunting for noncitizens is that unlike their
American counterparts, they do not automatically
have the right to legal representation and due to pov-
erty and other factors are often powerless.
Desegregation and the political awakening
among inmates in the 1960s and 1970s made these
transitional years for the development of prison
gangs. With politicization came polarization be-
tween various racial and ethnic groups, diminishing
what had been a more tradition bound and stable
prison culture. As mentioned in Chapter 12, the
new liberal prison environments that prevailed after
Cooper v. Pate in 1964 allowed gangs to spread
quickly. Before this ruling only several states re-
ported the presence of gangs; by 1984 more than
60% of the state and federal prisons reported gang
activity. With the expansion of the free world crack
cocaine trade in the 1980s and the concomitant
tougher sentencing laws, an unprecedented number
of street gang members ended up in the various
prison systems and in the process often transferred
street gangs from the outside to the inside. By the
late 1990s a number of these prison gangs have
made the transformation to extremely organized
gangs, causing alarm for law enforcement on both
sides of the prison walls. Some modern gangs are
quite distinct from earlier ones. A number of them
demand obedience based on a “death oath,” better
known as “Blood In, Blood Out.” In other words,
you shed blood to get in and die to get out. Others
have adopted paramilitary structures.
At the turn of the twenty-first century Illinois
had “the most gang-dominated prison system in the
country.”104 Today a number of prison officials and
police organizations refer to some prison gangs as
Security Threat Groups (STGs). More recently the
Gangs and Security Threat Group Awareness organi-
zation asserted that there are six prison gangs nation-
ally recognized “for their participation in organized
crime and violence” (Florida Dept. of Corrections).
These include Neta (Puerto Rican), Aryan Brother-
hood, Black Guerrilla Family, Mexican Mafia, La
Nuestra Familia, and Texas Syndicate. Besides these
groups are ever-growing populations of apolitical
street gangs. Prison gangs eluded the scrutiny of law
enforcement for many years by using racially charged
language to obscure the true nature of their criminal
activities, which include drug trafficking, extortion,
and assaults. The best evidence of the profit motive
now trumping the racist one is the willingness of
white supremacist gangs to form alliances with Black
or Hispanic prison gangs to increase profits.

Giving credence to the notion that some prison
gangs are equivalent to organized crime groups, in
1982, 25 members of La Nuestra Familia, a prison
gang created in the California state prison system in
1968, were indicted for criminal acts that included
extortion, robbery, drug trafficking, murders, and
witness intimidation. This was the first time a prison
gang was federally indicted for violating the RICO
act.
Over the past several years prison officials have
become most concerned with prison inmates gain-
ing access to cell phones for arranging crimes. In
Texas several high-profile incidents brought atten-
tion to this problem in 2004. On one occasion a
member of the Texas Syndicate prison gang was
discovered making cell phone calls to conduct or-
ganized crime activities such as drug trafficking, ex-
tortion, and escape planning. The problem in Texas
was reportedly exacerbated by the fact that inmates
in that state do not have regular access to phones for
calling family members and attorneys. Philadelphia
recognized the problem in 2002 during a sweep of
three prisons that found 61 illegal phones. Attempts
at introducing technology to jam cell phones have
had mixed results due to fears that it could jam
prison communication equipment used by correc-
tional officers as well. Today, cell phones can fetch
hundreds of dollars behind bars. As they get smaller
it becomes easier to hide them. Most are smuggled
in by inmates on work-release programs, after fam-
ily visits, or by corrections officers or contractors
working in the prison. In July 2008 cell-phone
sniffing dogs were successfully introduced to prisons
in Maryland and Virginia.105
The following items were confiscated from
one prison gang member’s cell during a 30-day
period.

CRIM E AND PUNISHM ENT
Mired in high unemployment (10%) and economic
recession that brought to mind for many people
images of the Great Depression and the Crisis Years
of criminal justice (see Chapter 10), researchers and
officials have had a difficult time explaining the
crime rate at the end of the first decade of the
twenty-first century, which had not been so low
since the 1960s. Indeed, most previous recessions
were accompanied by a rise in crime. But during
the first six months of 2009 the FBI reported a
crime decline throughout the country, including
murder and manslaughter, which had dropped
10% over the same period the previous year. Prop-
erty crimes fell by 6.1% and violent ones by 4.4%;
violent crime dropped nearly 7% in cities with one
million or more.107
Most criminologists opine that these crime drops
cannot be sustained over time. Criminologists have
suggested various explanations for the recent crime
drop, suggesting that as the population ages and with
fewer individuals in the crime-prone years this de-
crease should not be unexpected. Others surmise
that the availability of unemployment benefits,
food stamps, and “other government-driven eco-
nomic stimulus have cushioned and delayed for
many people the big blows that come from a
recession.” Police officials point to better law en-
forcement strategies that are often driven by technol-
ogy. For example, car theft has dropped due in large
part to modern security locking systems on most cars
and high-tech deterrents such as car-recovery devices
such as Global Positioning Systems.
For a nation seemingly inured to serial killers,
bank robbers, and deadly drug traffickers, the face
of crime in the twenty-first century would have a
new cast—peopled by terrorists and white-collar
corporate and banking scoundrels. Both types
would have a hand at bringing the country to the
depths of despair during the first decade of the new
century.
The FBI stepped up its investigations in 2009
during the recent recession, launching more than
2,100 probes into securities fraud (compared to
1,750 in 2008). The FBI increased the amount of

agents devoted to this crime by one-third. In addi-
tion, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) issued 82% more restraining orders and de-
voted more time to potential financial scams in
2009 over the prior year.
America’s greatest strength is its freedom and
openness. For the domestic terrorist, it is also
America’s greatest weakness. With loosely con-
trolled borders, people and goods legally and ille-
gally flow back and forth across these borders every
hour, every day. Every year, more than 400 million
people enter the United States. Every year, there
are 800,000 aircraft arrivals, and every year some
nine million cargo containers arrive at U.S. ports.
Customs officials report that they can inspect only
2% to 3% of these.
Modern criminal threats to American security
have new generations of law enforcement officials
preparing for unprecedented criminal acts. Among
the most feared are chemical, biological, and
computer-based instruments of mass destruction.
What is so threatening is that they are often cheap
to build and can be easily constructed and trans-
ported. One need look no further than the bomb-
ing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in
Oklahoma City (1995) and the first World Trade
Center bombing (1993), each accomplished with
one motor vehicle and one bomb. However, few
could have predicted that the worst fears of criminal
justice and security experts would become reality
on September 11, 2001.
White-Collar Crime
In 2001 Enron became synonymous with white-
collar fraud. Once one of the world’s leading energy
companies, by this time Enron executives had hid-
den millions of dollars in “offshore entities” to avoid
taxes, hide losses, and boost the perceptions of prof-
itability. Although share prices had continued to rise,
only company bigwigs knew Enron was running at a
loss. When shares reached their peak in 2000, execu-
tives sold their shares using inside information.
Once the country’s seventh largest corporation,
by the end of 2001 the former energy trading
giant Enron had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection. This was the largest bankruptcy in Amer-
ican history up to that time. Enron’s demise was
followed closely by that of the Arthur Anderson ac-
counting firm (one of the largest accounting firms in
the world) and trials that sent Enron’s top executives
to prison. However, justice was probably cheated
when its leader Ken Lay succumbed to a heart attack
before sentencing. The Enron scandal and other sim-
ilar scandals led Congress to enact the Sarbanes-
Oxley law, which brought a sweeping overhaul of
security regulations not seen since the 1930s. The
legislation was significant not just for holding audit-
ing firms to increased accountability but also for ex-
panding the sanctions for those found guilty of
destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal
investigations or attempting to defraud shareholders.
Charles Ponzi (1877–1949) orchestrated one of the most
famous swindles in American history and his name has
been forever linked with his 1919 scheme that brought in
millions of dollars, although no one knows for sure how
much was lost by investors. The Italian immigrant had a
checkered career as a dishwasher, forger, and alien
smuggler after coming to America in 1899. He came upon
the scheme rather serendipitously when he discovered he
could buy up international postal union reply coupons at
low prices in various countries and then mark them up
and sell at a 50% profit in the United States. Through an
astute advertising campaign claiming that investors could
expect large returns, investors flooded him with requests
to get in on the bargain. As word spread, millions of
dollars poured into Ponzi’s coffers. In one day alone in
1920 he reportedly reaped at least $2 million. On the face
of it the scheme was rather simple, as twenty-
first-century practitioners have found out. He would pay
the high returns to early investors as new money came in
from others. As long as the funds mounted he could
continue to pay interest on old accounts, whose owners
could vouch for his sincerity. Ponzi never had to actually
invest any of his own money and he spent most of the
money on his dandified lifestyle while paying off early
investors. But after about six months newspapers began
to investigate this unlikely “rags-to-riches” story. How-
ever, Ponzi was able to buy time by filing lawsuits against
the newspapers. Ponzi sued one newspaper for libel and
won a $500,000 judgment, which effectively tabled the
investigation for the moment. Subsequently another
newspaper revealed that his past included a stint in
prison for forgery and alien smuggling. He would even-
tually be convicted and sentenced to prison for his fraud
and in 1934 he was deported back to Italy upon his

release. During the investigation of Ponzi it was discov-
ered that out of the millions of dollars he took in he had
only purchased $30 in international mail coupons. He
died in Brazil in 1949.108
Bernard Madoff and the Return of the
Ponzi Scheme
Between 2008 and 2009 several enormous Ponzi
schemes unraveled as Securities and Exchange Com-
mission (SEC) regulators haplessly stood by. Despite
numerous warnings SEC regulators stood pat as such
luminaries as Bernard L. Madoff and R. Allen Stan-
ford shattered the dreams and retirements of thou-
sands of investors. At this writing the fraud was
estimated to be in the billions of dollars. The Madoff
scandal that broke in 2008 was the “biggest financial
scam in history.” The allegations against Stanford, set
to go on trial in 2011, that claimed he cost investors
$7 billion, made him a piker compared to the losses
incurred by Madoff investors. On March 12, 2009,
Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 counts in relation to a
Ponzi scheme that the government claimed involved
more than $60 billion. He was sentenced to 150
years in jail. What distinguished Madoff from other
white-collar criminals was not just the size and lon-
gevity of his scam, but the fact that he was so trusted,
as a former chairman of the Nasdaq stock company,
and the high regard with which he was held in New
York City’s management circles. In an ironic post-
script Madoff was transferred to the Atlanta Federal
penitentiary in July 2009, a jail where Charles Ponzi
did time.
Subprime Mortgage Crisis
One of the tragedies of the 9/11 terrorist attacks was
that warning signs were missed early on, even
though several agents from the FBI reported suspi-
cious activities that would eventually be linked to
the tragedy to their superiors. Likewise, at least two
years before the subprime mortgage scandal, one top
FBI official had warned of a widening mortgage
fraud crisis up the road, but no one within the
agency responded. In this case the agent seems
omniscient, having predicted in 2004, “The boom-
ing mortgage business, fueled by low interest rates
and soaring home values, was starting to attract shady
operators and billions in losses were possible.”109
In many respects the mortgage-fraud debacle
was another byproduct of the massive reassignment
of agents to counterterrorism duties after 9/11. One
high-ranking FBI official admitted in 2009 that the
agency knew of the fraud as far back as 2002 while
other officials concede that they were stretched too
thin due to their new duties in the war on terrorism.
But there was enough blame to go around. The FBI
also blamed the SEC for failing to detect the mort-
gage fraud schemes in a timely fashion.110 Despite
the mea culpas, the early twenty-first century was
no ordinary era. The FBI, like its “parent agency”
the Justice Department, directed its attention toward
other national priorities, particularly national secu-
rity, and paid scant attention to “bloodless” white-
collar crimes and fraudulent banking practices.
The current financial crisis is widely considered
the country’s worst since the Great Depression. Most
observers assert its roots are firmly planted in the
subprime mortgage crisis that began in 2006. Ac-
cording to one white-collar historian, the crime of
fraud based on deception dates back to at least the
fourth century B.C.111 But, this time around, the
mortgage crisis was caused by several factors includ-
ing unprincipled lending practices in the mortgage
industry, deceptive credit ratings, and years of dereg-
ulation and loose mortgage standards.
Less than a decade ago banks assiduously exam-
ined a borrower’s credit history and income, and if
they did not meet the qualification criteria for the
loan it was refused. But the lending fraud at the
root of the recent scandal involved mortgage len-
ders who issued loans based on information that
lenders knew mischaracterized the customer’s actual
financial status, such as exaggerating income or as-
sets, perhaps using false employment information,
or even overstating property values.112 Industry in-
siders began referring to subprime loans as “ninja
loans”; in other words “no income, no job, no
questions asked.” Many of the victims tended to
be “lower income borrowers” who in many cases
were “duped” into taking loans they did not

understand and could ill afford. Victims of naiveté,
the proud new homeowners eventually found
themselves weighted down with escalating interest
payments, prepayment penalties, and dubious fees.
Facing the fact they were on the cusp of not only
losing their homes but any equity as well, many just
walked away, leaving in some cases parts of new
subdivisons deserted.
Eventually the subprime mortgage crisis will
have cost investors billions of dollars and leave tax-
payers with a bill in the hundreds of billions of
dollars. Few segments of the real estate market es-
caped this calamity. Victims included borrowers
who had their homes foreclosed; neighborhoods
with a number of foreclosed homes who watched
home values plummet; and employees of failed in-
vestment
banks
and
investors
who
purchased
mortgage-based securities. In addition, anyone try-
ing to finance a home faced the barrier of much
tighter credit standards.113
In every major white-collar scam there are al-
ways those who walked away with a fortune. The
chief beneficiaries this time around were CEOs and
the top executives of major mortgage lending com-
panies and investment banks who earned tens of bil-
lions of dollars in salaries, bonuses, and stock options.
As far back as March 2008 the FBI Criminal
Investigative Division had 1,253 mortgage fraud in-
vestigations ranging the gamut from “illegal prop-
erty flipping” and home equity scams to check
fraud cases.114 A year later the number of pending
cases had almost doubled to 2,440. Estimated an-
nual losses were in the billions of dollars. In 2008
the Department of Justice launched “Operation
Malicious Mortgage,” which involved a joint task
force of federal agencies including the FBI, IRS,
and Postal Inspection Service. During the three-
and-one-half-month
operation
between
March
and June, 406 defendants were charged in 144
mortgage fraud cases. The FBI has also responded
to the crisis by ordering 26 of its 56 field offices to
focus on the subprime-mortgage crisis and drop
other financial crimes investigations for the time
being. Cooperation between the SEC and the
FBI resulted in the indictment of two former Bear
Stearns hedge-fund managers.115 The Security and
Exchange Commission (SEC), which dropped the
ball in the first place, has launched an agency-wide
task force to investigate this industry.
A number of experts and other observers who monitor
hate groups are worried that the election of an African
American president could spur the activities of hate
groups and reinvigorate the white power movement. In
2009 the Southern Poverty Law Center noted that in 2008
there were 929 hate groups nationally compared to 602
in 2007. While it is not clear how many are active, the
number of reported hate crimes has remained steady at
almost 7,500 each year over the past 10 years.116 Accord-
ing to the most recent hate crime statistics (2008), 7,783
hate crime incidents involving 9,168 offenses were re-
ported through Uniform Crime Reporting. More than half
were racially biased, followed by those based on sexual
orientation (17.7%), religious bias (17.5%), and ethnicity/
national origin bias (12.5%).117
Capital Punishment
David Fathi, director of the U.S. program at Human
Rights watch, recently suggested that the United
States has become “a global pariah” for its continued
support for the death penalty, claiming that in 2008
the United States was the world’s fourth leading ex-
ecutioner behind China, Iran, and Saudi Arabia.
Since the return of the death penalty in 1977 more
than 1,160 American prisoners have been hanged,
shot, gassed, electrocuted or lethally injected. Of
these, only 3 executions carried out since 1997
have been by the federal government, with the rest
carried out by mostly a handful of states—Texas,
Virginia, and Oklahoma accounted for more than
half of the executions in the modern era. And of
the 35 states whose laws allow it, two have carried
out none since 1977, and five only one each.
One of the unexpected trends in American
criminal justice in 2009 was a decline in the amount
of death sentences being doled out by juries. In
2008, 111 people were sentenced to death in
America, the lowest number of any year since the
reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976. There
are several explanations for this turn of events. This
reversal of course did not happen overnight. With
the option of life without parole in all death penalty

states, jurors and judges are more willing to avoid
the death penalty (ruling in costs and suspect con-
victions). Some suggest it lies on a question of in-
nocence and greater scrutiny of capital cases. More
than 130 individuals have been released from death
rows since 1973 after they were exonerated for the
crimes. With the addition of DNA evidence begin-
ning around 1999 the question of evidence reso-
nated
even
stronger.
Some
authorities
have
suggested that the decline in death sentences mir-
rored the decline in murder rates. Still others point
to the increased awareness of the racial disparities,
especially that a white who kills a black is much less
likely to be sentenced to death than a black who
kills a white. State budgets have also played a role.
Studies have demonstrated that states that seek the
death penalty increase the cost of a murder prose-
cution from 38% to 70%. These concerns come at a
time when states are already slashing budgets for
education, health, and other vital services.
In 2007 New Jersey became the first state to
ban executions since it was reinstated in 1976, and
in 2009 New Mexico followed suit, becoming the
15th state to repeal the death penalty. Officials cite
time and money as the main reasons, but also con-
cede the potential for error as well. It cost an esti-
mated $4.2 million for each death sentence (10
were on death row) and none had been executed
since 1963.118 One observer noted, “This is the first
time in which cost has been the prevalent issue in
discussing the death penalty.”119 What’s more,
death penalty trials are more expensive because
they often require extra lawyers and strict experi-
ence requirements for attorneys, leading to lengthy
appellate waits while competent counsel is sought
for the accused; security costs are higher as well, and
costs for processing evidence such as DNA testing,
for example, are much more expensive than blood
analysis. After sentencing, costs continue to rise—it
costs more to house death row inmates held in seg-
regated sections of prisons in separate cells with
guards expected to deliver everything required for
the feeding and housing of inmates.120
Executions increased in 2009 over the previous
year from 37 to 52. Although this was a period in
which juries and judges had become less likely to
sentence someone to death, the rise was likely due
to the previous year’s low number of executions as
states dealt with the backlog of 40 canceled execu-
tions before the 2008 Supreme Court decision on
lethal injection.
Cruel and Unusual? The Debate over
Lethal Injection
Between 2007 and 2009 the legitimacy of lethal in-
jection as a humane form of capital punishment was
at the center of several court appeals that brought a
seven-month de facto nationwide moratorium on the
process. However, on April 16, 2008, in a seven to
two ruling the Supreme Court in Baze v. Reese up-
held the use of lethal injection for capital punishment,
giving the go-ahead for the 40 executions that had
been put on hold until this issue was decided. In this
case two Kentucky inmates, Ralph Baze and another
inmate, challenged the state’s administration of the
four-drug cocktail process as a violation against the
Eighth Amendment against cruel and unusual pun-
ishment.121 The Court ruled that the procedure used
in Kentucky and other states with similar methods did
not violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel
and unusual punishments as long as it was performed
correctly. However, this was not the end of the story.
In November 2009 executions were suspended in
Kentucky after the state’s Supreme Court ruled that
the state did not follow proper administrative proce-
dures, including offering a public hearing, when it
adopted the lethal injection method.122 As of 2010
no new execution date had been set for Baze, the
convicted killer of two peace officers.
Supreme Court challenges to the death penalty as a vio-
lation of the Eighth Amendment have a long, sordid his-
tory in America. In the 7-2 decision the Court noted its
principle that defined cruelty as limited to punishments
that “involve torture or a lingering death.” This became
especially clear after the 2008 decision to continue with
lethal injections. Two decisions illustrate the disparity
between theory and practice on such occasions. In the
1879 decision Wilkerson v. Utah, Wallace Wilkerson’s ex-
ecution by firing squad was upheld after the Court found
the method did not constitute cruel and unusual punish-
ment. When it was his time to face the firing squad

Wilkerson declined the offer of a blindfold. As soon as he
heard the command to fire he braced his body for death
but happened to budge just enough for the bullets to
miss his vital organs and hit his arm and torso instead. He
reportedly cried out, “My God! They have missed.” It
took him almost a half hour to bleed to death in full
viewing of a physician and witnesses. In 1890, the court
ruled that the state of New York could carry on with the
country’s first execution by the electric chair, arguing
William Kemmler could be executed in this manner be-
cause the method reduced substantial risks of a “linger-
ing death” if compared to hanging. However, when
Kemmler was executed it took several surges of electricity
to kill him and enough voltage to light his coat on fire.123
The next major challenge to lethal injection
came out of Ohio after a botched execution under
the state’s traditional three-drug method. In this
case Romell Broom had been sentenced to die for
the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl in 1984.
On September 15, 2008, he was placed on the gur-
ney for his lethal injection. A lifetime intravenous
drug user, prison officials spent almost two hours
searching for a usable vein, leading the convict to
burst into tears. It was then decided to reschedule
the execution for another date—the first time in
U.S. history that an execution by lethal injection
was rescheduled after a failed attempt. Broom later
claimed he was stuck at least 18 times. His attorneys
challenged the process as cruel and unusual punish-
ment while the state’s assistant attorney general re-
sponded, “there is no evidence that Broom suffered
pain of such severity as to rise to the level of severe
pain prohibited by the Eight Amendment.” As of
December 2009 Ohio still intended to set a new
execution date.124 However, Ohio did decide to
become the first of the 36 states that use lethal
injections to switch to a single powerful anesthetic,
one dose of thiopental sodium (with a backup
method using two intramuscular injections). Ex-
perts compared this method to the way pets are
euthanized by veterinarians. While other states
such as California have considered the one drug
method, fears about “unpredictable consequences”
have so far prevented it. Even Chief Justice John
Roberts weighed in, suggesting that this method
“has problems of its own” before it was used for
the first time.125 Nonetheless, it was used for the
first time on December 8, 2009, in the execution of
killer Kenneth Biros the same day his appeal was
rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Juvenile Criminal Justice: Life without
Parole?
As of late 2009, 109 people were serving sentences
of life without parole for non-homicide crimes com-
mitted while under the age of 18 (at least 2,500 were
serving life without parole for murder or participat-
ing in a crime that led to murder). All of these
prisoners were in the United States and almost
three-quarters of them were in Florida prisons.126
Eight states have juvenile offenders serving life with-
out parole for non-homicide crime, including
Louisiana, California, Delaware, Iowa, Mississippi,
Nebraska, South Carolina, and Florida. In stark com-
parison the maximum juvenile sentence for any
crime in Germany is 10 years and 24 years in Italy.
The controversy over how to sentence juvenile
offenders for serious felonies has been brewing for
many years. More recently Florida was at the epicen-
ter of the debate. During the 1990s Florida was
rocked by a rising juvenile crime rate and a number
of high-profile crimes by juveniles that tarnished the
image of this vacation haven and threatened the state
tourism industry. In 1992–1993 alone nine foreign
tourists were killed during one 11-month period, in-
cluding one committed by a 14-year-old. One state
legislator opined that Florida should be called the
“Gunshine State” instead of the “Sunshine State.”127
In its rush to judgment, the state of Florida
began moving more juveniles into adult courts,
lengthening sentences and doing away with parole
for capital crimes. In the 1990s these actions were
heavily supported by “law and order” advocates.
However, as juvenile crime declined in the state
by 30% between 1994 and 2004, critics now charge
the continued draconian legislation was a hysterical
response to a looming juvenile crime wave prom-
ised by criminologists that never materialized.
In 1989 a 13-year-old Floridian was sentenced to
life in prison without parole for robbing and raping
an elderly woman. In 2005 a 16-year-old in Florida
was deemed “incorrigible” by a judge and given the

same punishment as above after several arrests for rob-
bery. Both these cases were at the center of a court
debate to determine whether it was cruel and unusual
to send a teenager to prison with no chance of parole.
These are just two of the 109 inmates serving life
sentences
for
non-homicide
crimes
committed
when they were younger than 18. In November
2009 the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments about
whether children should ever be sentenced to life
without parole for crimes that don’t involve murder.
The Court had already ruled (5-4) in 2005 in Roper v.
Simmons that executing convicts for offenses commit-
ted before the age of 18 was unconstitutional. The
jurists cited such factors as immaturity, irresponsibility,
and susceptibility to peer pressure and potential for
turning lives around.128
The distinction between childhood and adult-
hood remains a point of contention for the
American criminal justice system. Research has
shown that different people mature at different
ages. Recent behavioral and neurological research
by Professor Laurence Steinberg at Temple Univer-
sity has revealed that “young teenagers seek out risk
and have trouble controlling their impulses,” which
by all accounts is “a very bad combination when it
comes to crime.” These studies were used as miti-
gating factors in considering the execution of
convicts for crimes committed under the age of
18 in 2005 and are now a “centerpiece in the cur-
rent Supreme Court cases about life without
parole.”129 As of January 2010 decisions were still
pending in the unrelated juvenile cases of Terrance
Graham v. Florida and Joe Sullivan v. Florida.
Some New Crimes: Organ Smugglers
and Cybercriminals
Traditional crimes of murder, drug trafficking, rob-
bery, theft, and rape continue to plague American
citizens. But the new century has also been marked
by a number of new types of crime, most taking
advantage of advances in science and technology
that now make it possible, as well as the ever-
present greed. Cyberspace became a more danger-
ous and busier place by the 1990s. During this era
the information and communication technologies
have become central to the lives of at least a billion
people worldwide. Concomitant with societies be-
coming more dependent on the Internet are the
threats from cybercriminals who commit crimes
with virtual anonymity. With a large percentage
of American businesses now using the Internet, cy-
bergangs in Eastern Europe have learned to infil-
trate
businesses with
the
help
of
virus-laden
attachments that once opened as e-mail installs ma-
licious software created to steal passwords. Once
criminals receive the information they can start ini-
tiating wire transfers. To evade scrutiny this is done
in smaller than $10,000 increments to avoid banks’
anti–money laundering laws. In April 2009 a
plumbing company in Sugarland, Texas, lost $1.2
to cybercriminals; it was able to retrieve all but
$190,000 of it thanks to the quick work of the
company’s operations manager.130
Although the practice of selling human organs
is illegal in most of the world and in the United
States since 1984, organ trafficking rings continue
to proliferate, although it is difficult to get a handle
on how many are out there. In July 2009 the FBI
reported what might turn out to be the first docu-
mented case of organ trafficking in the United
States. This case revolved around a 58-year-old
New Yorker member of the Orthodox Jewish
community known as a “matchmaker,” for broker-
ing the sale of black market kidneys from vulnera-
ble individuals in Israel to patients in the United
States. Due to the fact that the demand outstrips
the supply there is a thriving black market for
kidneys around the world. Impoverished and
cash-strapped individuals have reportedly sold their
kidneys for $10,000 to the broker who has made as
much as $160,000 in the United States. One esti-
mate suggests that at least 5,000 to 6,000 kidney
transplants are done illegally each year around the
world.131
Same Old Crimes: The War on Drugs
The 2009 National Drug Threat Assessment states
that “Mexican drug trafficking organizations repre-
sent the greatest organized crime threat to the
CRIMIN AL JUSTICE IN TH E AG E OF TERRORISM (2000– 2010)

United States.”132 According to its findings the
number one drug threat is cocaine, followed by
methamphetamine, and in descending order mari-
juana, heroin, pharmaceutical drugs, and ecstasy
(MDMA). One of the more troubling findings is
that numerous urban street gangs are becoming in-
creasingly involved in “wholesale drug distribution
aided by their connections with Mexican and Asian
drug trafficking organizations.”
Historically poor relations between the United
States and Mexico dating back to the Mexican-
American War of 1846 have hampered cooperation
between the two countries’ police agencies. Coop-
eration began to improve during the administra-
tions of Vicente Fox (2000–2006) and current
president Felipe Calderon. As a result Mexico for
the first time is allowing U.S. military personnel to
offer training. Today the most powerful drug gangs
in the Americas are headquartered in Mexico.
What’s more, they flourish on both sides of the
Mexican border. They are involved in money laun-
dering, armed robbery, kidnapping for ransom, ex-
tortion, and illegal weapons trafficking. These
operations have become much more lucrative since
the passage of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) between Canada, the United
States, and Mexico in 1994. Being strategically lo-
cated on the American border allows Mexican drug
cartels to respond quickly to changing drug trends
in the United States, where most drug users live. In
recent years the violent war between the drug gangs
has spilled across the border into the United States.
American officials have identified 230 cities where
these gangs operate including Boston, Atlanta, and
Anchorage.
In 2009 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) announced that drug-related deaths outnum-
bered those from car accidents in many states.
According to their calculations the rate of drug-
induced deaths outpaced car wrecks in 16 states in
2006.133 This was double the number since 2003.
The overwhelming majority of drug-related deaths
are the results of overdoses. One explanation for
this is that the number of car crash victims spiraled
downward between 1999 and 2006 at the same time
drug deaths were increasing due to the rising
popularity of opoid analgesics such as methadone
and fentanyl, sedatives and painkillers such as Vicodin
and OxyContin, and the old standby, cocaine.134
In November 2009 more than 200 members of the
American and Canadian law enforcement communities
attended what was billed the National Prostitution Di-
version conference in Dallas, Texas. In what was consid-
ered a pioneering program for prostitute rehabilitation,
the Dallas Police Department adopted a new strategy to
handle the “world’s oldest profession” in a program that
gave arrested prostitutes the choice of either jail or re-
habilitation. The new strategy treated prostitutes as “sex-
crime victims” instead of criminals. So far the program
has had mixed result with less than 10% of the 375 who
chose rehab changing their lives. The Prostitution Diver-
sion Initiative involves “a monthly roundup of prostitutes
in an area health officials consider the national epicenter
of syphilis.” Police set up a staging area for the once-
a-month event. Here they take away the prostitute’s
property and interview her about criminal operations,
pimps, underage girls, and other issues. Once this is com-
pleted social service workers determine the needs of the
women, which range from alcohol and drug counseling
to mental health counseling. They are also tested for
sexually transmitted diseases. Finally they are taken to a
mobile courtroom where it can be determined if the
women have any outstanding felony warrants. The judge
can than decide whether the individual seems genuinely
interested in entering rehab. Police have noted long-term
advantages in cultivating prostitutes—they can some-
times provide leads on cold cases and perhaps learn to
trust police.135
Restitution
In 2004 almost one-fifth of all felons convicted in
the United States were given an additional penalty
of restitution. Nationwide unpaid court-ordered
restitution was estimated in the billions of dollars.136
When convicted offenders are sentenced, their
punishment might include incarceration, fines, res-
titution, and other penalties. But when it comes to
restitution there is more bark than bite in the law.
Often the punishment is regarded as symbolic, since
the offender is rarely in the financial position to pay
what is owed or is incarcerated. For example,
almost 17 years ago a young burglar was found
guilty of burning down a church and was ordered
376

to pay $2.4 million. By the time the church was
completed he had contributed less than $400.137
However, states are beginning to back up these
judgments and even turning to outside collection
agencies to supplement their in-house efforts. In
2003 Arizona reported $831 million in unpaid
court costs, fines, fees, and restitution. After con-
tracting with a major collection company it brought
in $90 million over the next four years. Arizona is
even going after tax refunds and preventing indivi-
duals from registering cars if they don’t pay up. A
variety of strategies are used in other states for col-
lecting these funds. Pennsylvania uses a computer
system that allows counties to customize payment
plans, track overdue payments, and create delin-
quency papers. Florida enforces an income deduc-
tion order as part of a restitution agreement, while
Colorado employs 100 collection investigators who
collaborate with offenders to come up with a re-
payment scheme.
AM ERICAN VIOLENCE
America’s current crime rates are noticeably lower
than the past. In fact there have been declines in all
serious crimes and pronounced decreases in violent
crime. Nowhere has the decline been felt more
than among lower income households and minori-
ties.138 According to some studies the spike in vio-
lence in mostly poor minority communities in the
mid-1980s and early 1990s was instigated by the
nature of the crack trade. Crack, it has been noted,
“has
unique
psychopharmacological
effects
on
users” that includes high sense of paranoia and a
predisposition to violence when compared to other
drugs. What’s more, compared to other drugs, the
number of purchases per user, due to its small and
inexpensive quantities, makes higher frequency of
contact between dealers and users unavoidable and
increases potential for violence. Raphael and Stoll
make an interesting case for considering the rise and
fall of the crack cocaine with the rise and fall of
inner-city violence during this era.139
For Americans at home and abroad the first
decade of the twenty-first century was an era
punctuated by violence. Bookended by two high
profile domestic terrorist attacks, first on September
11, 2001, and then ending with the Ft. Hood
shootings (and the failed Christmas Day attack by
the “underpants bomber”) at the end of 2009.
These attacks revealed the continuing futility and
failures of American anti-terrorism strategies, what
President Obama has alluded to as “human and sys-
temic failures.”
The relationship between mental health issues
and violence was brought home with several high-
profile cases involving child homicide and mass
murder. This decade witnessed the case of Andrea
Yates, who drowned her five children in a bathtub,
and further debate about the insanity defense and
increased awareness about postpartum depression
and psychoses. Yates was quickly convicted of cap-
ital murder and sentenced to life only to have it
overturned and found not guilty by reason of in-
sanity. She was transferred from prison to Kerrville
State Hospital. And on April 16, 2007, a senior at
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
(Virginia Tech) went on a campus rampage that left
32 students and faculty dead and 25 wounded, in
what
became
known
as
the
“Virginia
Tech
Massacre.” It was the nation’s worst mass murder.
According to the subsequent Report of the Virginia
Tech Review Panel, a 260-page report issued in
August 2007, mental health staff at the school
had failed to “connect the dots” after missing
numerous warning signs of mental instability of
the shooter Seung Hui Cho. What perhaps was
most troubling was that he had been able to pur-
chase two guns in violation of federal law because
the state of Virginia had “inadequate background
check requirements.”
Domestic terrorism struck urban America in
2002 when traveling snipers Lee Boyd Malvo and
John Allen Muhammed, known as the “DC sni-
pers,” shot 16 individuals, killing 10 in a shooting
spree that lasted from September to October, para-
lyzing holiday shoppers in the Washington, DC,
corridor. Muhammed was executed in November
2009. His accomplice, who was 17 at the time of
the shooting spree, was sentenced to life in prison
without parole in Virginia.

In 2006 the FBI Uniform Crime Report
showed a rise in violent crime for the second year
in a row. What was most troubling was this was the
first sustained increase in homicides, robberies, and
other serious offenses since the early 1990s almost
15 years ago. Much of the increase was accounted
for in medium-sized cities such as Washington, DC.
Researchers and law enforcement officials offered
varying explanations for the increase, including the
usual culprits—an increase in juvenile population,
growing numbers of released prison inmates, and
the rise of serious gang problems in smaller jurisdic-
tions. Democratic lawmakers blamed the Bush ad-
ministration for a lack of federal assistance to local
police forces. Then Senator Joseph Biden, as chair
of a Senate crime subcommittee, asserted, “It’s time
to get back to crimefighting basics—that means
more cops on the streets, equipped with the tools
and resources they need to keep neighborhoods
safe.”140 Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez
bristled at this criticism, claiming “it doesn’t appear
that the current data reveal nationwide trends,” but
“show local increases in certain communities,” and
in many places, he noted “violent crime continues to
decrease.” In some respects the attorney general was
correct, for indeed crime patterns often vary accord-
ing to region and demographics.
In 2009 the FBI released the previous year’s
crime data, which indicated a 4% drop in the mur-
der and manslaughter compared to the prior year,
part of a nationwide drop in violent crime. Violent
crime is a metric kept by the FBI and police depart-
ments across the country as a gauge of an area’s
safety, and it includes murder, rape, robbery, and
aggravated assault. Rapes declined to the lowest na-
tional average in 20 years. In 2009 Houston Police
Chief Harold Hurtt suggested that a better measure
of crime rates is to compare crime rates to previous
years “since different places present different crime-
fighting scenarios, such as the geographic area of a
city
or
its
number
of
high-crime
apartment
complexes.” The FBI warns against comparisons
for these same reasons.141
The following are the top 15 of the nation’s

The Immigrant Factor in
Homicide Rates
Between 2002 and 2007 homicide increases were
reported in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Newark, and
other East Coast cities, while New York remained
steady.143 There were some interesting anomalies in
the murder rates as the decade moved to conclu-
sion. One explanation that has been bandied about
by criminal justice experts is that this is because
there are “not enough new immigrants.” Suppor-
ters of this theory suggest that “waves of hardwork-
ing, ambitious immigrants reinvigorate desperately
poor black and Hispanic neighborhoods and help
keep crime down.” This runs against the accepted
notion that immigrants are more a source of crime
and disorder. One researcher points out that in
many cities immigrants “tend to be crime victims
rather than perpetrators.”144 Sociologists such as
Harvard’s Robert Sampson counter that cities
experiencing waves of immigration such as Los
Angeles and New York are being transformed and
revitalized by waves of new immigrants who have

gone to great trouble to reach America where they
can work hard and avoid trouble. Nonetheless the
immigration factor is only one explanation. Others
offer that cities that do not integrate innovative
practices that have lowered violence in larger cities,
such as limiting gun purchases, suing rogue dealers,
and deploying officers strategically based on crime
data analysis, are missing the boat. Still others blame
the availability of high-powered weapons, the on-
going shift in resources from fighting street crime to
homeland security and terrorism prevention, and
the resigned acceptance of “quality-of-life crimes”
such as vandalism and traffic infractions—actions
that breed disrespect for law and order.
Newark Experiment
Between 2002 and 2006 Newark, New Jersey, the
state’s largest city, saw a 50% rise in homicides, con-
tinuing a trend that existed for almost 40 years. How-
ever, in January 2008 a new strategy resulted in no
homicides in 33 days, something that had not oc-
curred since 1963. According to the Newark Police
Chief and former chief crime strategist for the NYPD
Garry J. McCarthy, this could be chalked up to sev-
eral factors that were part of a larger crime-fighting
strategy that included prosecuting petty crimes such
as loitering and public drunkenness along with more
serious crime, as well as better sharing of information
and resources with other police departments, includ-
ing the FBI, the DEA, and the state police. The city
has supplemented this program by installing 120 sur-
veillance cameras in high crime areas of the city.145
CONCLUSIONS
No decade in modern American history was de-
fined by terrorism as much as the first 10 years of
the twenty-first century. It began with the 9/11
attacks that led to two wars and big changes in
the way Americans live and travel. As the first
decade of the new century came to an end the
country was beginning to come out of its deepest
recession since the 1930s. The unemployment rate
stood at 15.4 million and the jobless rate at 10%
(historically, the normal is 5.5%) at the end of
2009. It dropped just below 10% in the first month
of 2010. Nonetheless, millions of jobs had disap-
peared, leading some economists to label the next
decade as the “New Abnormal,” fearing that high
unemployment will average at 8%.
A number of hopeful new criminal justice trends
have begun over the past decade, including the di-
minished reliance of mandatory-minimum sentences.
Perhaps, none had more impact than the movement
in some states to soften laws on harsh drug sentences.
As mentioned in earlier chapters New York State
started the ball rolling when Governor Nelson
Rockefeller led the campaign for draconian sentenc-
ing and mandatory sentencing in the early 1970s.
The movement toward lessening sentences made its
greatest strides in 2004. One of the more hopeful
trends has been the decrease of black imprisonment
rates, which paralleled the decline in the number of
black offenders between 2000 and 2008. However,
black males are still incarcerated at a rate six and half
times that of whites. The decline in the black impris-
onment rate overall is probably due to fewer blacks
being imprisoned for drug offenses.146 Nonetheless,
about one in every 198 U.S. residents was incarcer-
ated in state or federal prisons at the end of 2008.
One of the more unforeseen results of the age of
terrorism has been the increasing role played by fed-
eral corrections in the criminal justice process—albeit
in crimes revolving around terrorist criminal acts.
President Obama has called for an additional
$527.5 million for the federal prison service (and
judicial security) in the 2011 budget proposal, in-
creasing the Bureau of Prisons budget to $6.8 billion.
This is in stark contrast to state prisons, which are
cutting budgets and adopting a wide range of alter-
natives and even closing some prisons. Almost half of
the federal funding is directed at plans to close the
military detention unit at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
and transferal of a number of terrorist suspects to a
prison in Illinois. The federal prison population is
expected to rise from 213,000 inmates to 220,000
in 2011. Other provisions in the budget related to
criminal justice include increased expenditures for
hiring new prison guards and adding agents to the
FBI, DEA, BATF, and U.S. Marshal Service.147

Americans never have been of one mind about
the death penalty. Currently a number of states
facing budget shortfalls are considering the high
expenses required for executions. At least 10 states
are currently considering ending it altogether. New
Jersey jumped on the bandwagon in 2007 when it
figured out that the state could save $1.3 million in
incarceration costs alone per condemned inmate by
doing away with death row. What’s more, the de-
clining number of death sentences each year suggests
in an age of DNA testing that juries are more willing
to opt for life without parole if it is available as an
alternative. As one death penalty critic pointed out,
“the death penalty turns out to be a very expensive
form of life imprisonment,” citing the fact that of the
3,279 prisoners on death row in 2009, only 52 were
executed. Others will disagree, arguing that only
evaluating the penalty from an economic perspective
ignores the justice elements inherent in its use.
Historian Jill Lepore asserts that “among affluent
democracies, the death penalty, like the US homi-
cide and incarceration rates marks an American
exception.”148 This holds true as much for the
twenty-first century as previous centuries. No matter
the advances in crime-fighting and the research find-
ings of legions of sociologists, criminologists, histor-
ians, and public officials, none have yet been able to
explain why the United States still “has the highest
homicide rate of any affluent democracy, nearly four
times that of France and UK, and six times
Germany.”149 One common theme has been the
availability of firearms, which in 2008 were used in
two-thirds of all murders in the United States. From
a historical perspective a number of European
scholars have looked back over America’s violent
domestic history and suggested that the United States
went through a different process of the “civilizing
process.” But American historian Randolph Roth
recently opined that gun death statistics do not tell
the whole story, suggesting that Americans have not
necessarily intended to kill each other more often;
they just have succeeded more often, noting that
“three out of four people murdered before 1850
would probably survive today” if they had access
to modern medicine, emergency response teams,
trauma surgery, antibiotics, and wound care.150
However, many observers can agree that ex-
ceptional high-profile crimes—juvenile murders,
mass murders, and terrorist attacks—often make
“bad laws.” No crime in American history was as
high-profile and resulted in as much carnage as the
attacks of 9/11 that left almost 3,000 dead on
American soil. In its aftermath the federal govern-
ment introduced a number of new laws and crime-
fighting strategies that were controversial if not
unconstitutional in some respects. Over the ensuing
years officials were able to reflect on what had tran-
spired on 9/11, and that also meant revisiting the
rushed legislation that followed. Within several
years many of these laws and strategies had been
done away with by the Bush administration. Several
Supreme Court decisions between 2004 and 2007
reversed White House policies despite attempts to
increase executive authority in counterterrorism.
These included allowing several enemy combatants
to contest their arrest (2004); declaring the military
tribunal system established at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, illegal due to lack of congressional approval
(2006); and a decision that prevents prosecution of
U.S. citizens arrested in the United States from
being tried outside the criminal court system
(2007).151 Likewise California’s three-strikes law
instigated too quickly in the aftermath of the Polly
Klaas murder has proven to be a “bad law” as well.
But it has taken the criminal justice system
much longer to come to the realization and is
only now dealing with it because of state prison
budget issues.
In January 2010 President Barack Obama
became the first African American president and
“the first president to take office in the Age of
Terrorism.” He inherited two struggles—one with
Al Qaeda and its ideological allies, and another that
divides his own country over issues like torture,
prosecutions, security, and what it means to be an
American. “The first has proved to be complicated
and daunting. The second makes the first look
easy.”152 One journalist suggests that the new pres-
ident “adopted the bulk of the counterterrorism
strategy he found on his desk when he arrived in
the Oval Office, a strategy that has already been
moderated from the earliest days after 9/11.”153

The history of America’s criminal justice system
proves that if anything, no challenge to it is wholly
new. The age of terrorism points to the fact that
like other eras in history there is a “trade-off” to be
made between security and liberty. This text has
offered a number of lessons in American criminal
justice history where the government has taken
unpopular steps such as curbing civil liberties.
Those previously covered include the Alien and
Sedition Acts (1798), President Lincoln’s suspension
of habeas corpus during the Civil War and the
introduction of martial law, prosecution of critics
of World War I under President Woodrow Wilson,
the
internment
of
Japanese-Americans
during
World War II, COINTELPRO at the height of
the Vietnam War, and surveillance and bugging
campaigns under Nixon and Hoover. These events
echo in the current “war on terror,” beginning
with the Bush administration’s call for military tri-
bunals. The problem according to most critics in
“striking a balance” between security and liberty is
recognizing one “did not need to sacrifice one for
the other.”
As of the beginning of 2010 the American
criminal justice system continues to struggle with
how to respond to the new era of crime and pun-
ishment. This was most glaring in the aftermath of
the attempted Christmas Day 2009 bombing of a
commercial airliner, when officials were unclear
whether the Miranda warning extended to terrorist
suspects. Despite being engaged in a campaign
against domestic terror for more than a decade,
the lines have not yet been firmly established on
how to go about questioning a suspect. How does
one differentiate between foreign and domestic ter-
rorism cases? When can you conduct interviews?
Where should suspected terrorists be imprisoned?
Should terrorists be given their Miranda rights?
These issues and others will surely be settled in
the coming years, for American criminal justice is
a work in progress that is constantly adapting to
new challenges as history moves forward.

15. Hawala originated in the early medieval commerce
in the Near and Middle East. Traders used a system
of money transfer based solely on trust and
grounded in Islamic propriety. This allowed trav-
eling merchants and others who traveled long dis-
tances to engage in business in foreign lands
without having to actually carry the funds with
them. It is still used today throughout much of
South Asia and the Middle East. Since it does not
leave a paper trail hawalas are particularly popular
for criminal and terrorist groups that need to
transmit illegal funds.

racial disparity of these profiles is most troubling, with
almost 40% taken from black men. Similarly in the
United States blacks make up about 12% of the
population but are overrepresented in the database
at 40%.

on track to have fewer than 500 homicides in
2007, the lowest number in a 12-month period
since reliable NYPD statistics became available in
1963. Other official statistics are even more strik-
ing. Having only analyzed half of the killings only
35% were committed by strangers; most were
killed in disputes with friends and acquaintances,
rival drug gang members, romantic partners, and
family members. This continues a remarkable slide
since 1990 when New York City recorded its
greatest number of killings in a single year, 2,245,
