What is Oracle WebCenter? 
Man has just landed on Mars! Where would you go to find information about 
this event? Although Man has not actually reached Mars yet, it is likely that you 
would have looked for answers on websites like Google, Yahoo, or MSN, thus 
demonstrating the Web's ability as a tool to work, communicate, and quickly verify 
that Man has not yet reached Mars. 
This book will give us precisely the expertise needed to take advantage the web 
plataform in order to build applications that offer communication, collaboration, 
knowledge sharing, social networking, and all those features that become our 
applications in WEB 2.0 solutions. 
This first chapter describes how web technology has evolved into a platform that 
offers comprehensive services to share knowledge, communicate, and facilitate 
collaborative work. This platform evolution has been called Web 2.0. The arrival of 
Web 2.0 has not gone unnoticed in the business environment; indeed, companies 
have collected the benefits that this can offer and have applied them in their working 
environments to achieve efficiency in their operations. This new way of using Web 
2.0 in business environments has been called Enterprise 2.0. 
Obviously, our book is not oriented to simply describing concepts, but also to 
implementing those concepts using the tools and technologies that Oracle offers. For 
this reason, we will show the main features of WebCenter Suite and JDeveloper, 
and how they can be used to develop Web 2.0 solutions. 
In this chapter, we will describe the following topics: 
• 
Web 2.0 concepts 
• 
Evolution of the platform application 
• 
Enterprise 2.0 concepts 
• 
Oracle WebCenter 
• 
Oracle JDeveloper

WEB 2.0 concepts 
The term Web 2.0 was created in 2004 during a brainstorm between O'Reilly and 
MediaLive International. This term is used to describe a new version of the web 
platform that offers its users enormous capacities for socialization. 
To better understand the evolution of the platform and the social impact of it, we 
need to review these concepts in detail. 
Evolution of the platform application 
The first platform used for the execution of applications was the PC, and it offered 
the facility to run our applications. Unfortunately, technical knowledge (memory, 
I/O, Interrupts, BUS, and so on) was often necessary to build applications. 
Currently, operating systems have become the standard platform to support 
our applications. Proof of this are the various applications for office, database 
management, multimedia, and others that are executed using those operating systems. 
Office 
Tools 
Custom 
Applications 
Game 
Programs 
OperatingSystem (O/S) 
PC 
The emergence of the World Wide Web and tools for navigating it (Internet Explorer 
and Netscape), helped to bring about the emergence of a new platform called the 
Web (currently called Web 1.0). 
At the beginning, the GUI of this platform was limited (using only HTML and 
JavaScript) and it didn't offer the richness of solutions built under the support of 
the operating system. 
The emergence of new technologies that enrich the user interface, such as AJAX, 
consolidated the Web as a platform for a new generation of applications that are able 
to take advantage of these technologies. Google, Google Maps, Wikipedia, Blogs, and 
Flickr are evidence of this. This new version of the Web platform is called Web 2.0.

Custom 
Applications

OperatingSystem (0/S) 
PC 
The Web 2.0 as a platform provides the following technical advantages: 
• 
We just need the support of the browser to run our applications. 
• 
We can offer remote access to applications using the Internet. 
• 
We can update our applications online, without installing any additional 
software in the clients. 
• 
The applications are ready to be implemented in other portable devices such 
as Palm, BlackBerry, and Pocket PC. 
• 
It is not necessary to have technical expertise in order to put content on 
the Web. 
All these technical advantages, however, don't compare with the social impact that 
the Web 2.0 platform produces. 
Social impact of Web 
The use of the Web 2.0 platform has enabled new ways to foster socialization among 
users. They are as follows: 
• 
Communication: The platform, in addition to mail and instant message 
solutions, opens new ways to communicate using blogs, video, and so on. 
• 
Knowledge exchange: Spaces opened in discussion areas, sharing pictures 
and files, allow users to exchange information amongst themselves. 
• 
Collaboration and participation: Web Technology allows users to participate 
using simple tools (blogs, podcasting) when they want to publish 
their information. 
[ 9 ] 

What is Oracle WebCenter? 
• 
Content management: The Web now permits us access to repositories of 
files, such as image, audio, video, and other electronic documents. 
• 
Creation of social environments: The Web supports the creation of spaces 
oriented to groups whose members share similar interests. 
We can conclude that the arrival of Web 2.0 impacts not only technology, but above 
all, it represents a social impact. This social impact has significance in the business 
environment and leads to creation of new Enterprise 2.0 concepts. 
Enterprise 2.0 concepts 
Companies can also take advantage of new web technologies. When establishing the 
"Enterprise 2.0" concept and examining the evolution of a company adapting to the 
use of new technologies, it's important to remember that the scope of Enterprise 2.0 is 
not restricted to the organization itself, but also includes its partners and customers. 
The technological benefits that Enterprise 2.0 offers are as follows: 
• 
Work environments online 
• 
Use of social networks 
• 
Creating and customizing collaborative work environments 
• 
Management and dissemination of knowledge of the organization 
• 
Integration with internal and external business applications 
• 
Ease of contacting the organization's resources 
• 
Fermenting communication between an organization's members 
We can then conclude that Enterprise 2.0 promotes the productivity of organizations 
by using a new technology platform offered by Web 2.0. At this point, you could ask 
yourself: How we can implement a solution that supports the guidelines suggested 
by Enterprise 2.0 and Web 2.0? The Oracle answer is called Oracle WebCenter Suite. 
Oracle WebCenter Suite concepts 
Oracle WebCenter Suite is a platform for building corporate portals or custom 
applications that integrate Enterprise 2.0 features, and aims to improve business 
processes through the integration of business applications and user communities. 
This suite allows companies to build corporate portals, social networks, collaborative 
communities, content managers, composite applications, and intranet and 
internet sites.

• SOA Process 
• Team Collaborations 
• Alerts and WorkList 
• Web 2.0 Services 
• Custom and Enterprise Applications 
Oracle WebCenter suite has the following key components: 
• 
Oracle WebCenter Framework: Used for building user interfaces and 
portlets in our solutions. The components built with this Framework use 
JSF and AJAX to provide a rich interface. 
• 
Oracle WebCenter Services: This component provides capabilities that 
integrate our solutions with content managers, search, wikis, discussions, 
blogs, messaging services (mail, instant message, telephone) and the whole of 
the features of Web 2.0. 
• 
Oracle WebCenter Composer: Allows users to personalize their content 
through friendly interfaces. 
• 
Oracle WebCenter Spaces: An out-of-the-box application, which 
uses components previously detailed to provide a collaborative work 
environment, the ability to create social networks, and the facility to 
share resources. 
• 
Oracle WebCenter Anywhere: Introduced to enable an application's 
interaction with mobile devices such as PDAs and smartphones.

In order to build Oracle WebCenter solutions, we need the support of a tool, and that 
is Oracle JDeveloper. 
Oracle JDeveloper 
Oracle JDeveloper was created in 1997 as a tool for building Java solutions. 
Although, initially, it was based on a tool called JBuilder, Oracle started to add 
features for interacting with database. During this evolution, JDeveloper added 
many frameworks like Business Components (formely BC4J), UIX, and others. 
A big change came with the appearance of version 10g, which introduced the 
productivity framework called Application Development Framework (ADF), and 
which accelerates the development of JEE solutions through Oracle libraries. 
New versions of the tool have included other technologies such as ADF Faces, which 
help to create user interfaces in a declarative way. Recently, a new version of ADF 
Faces, call ADF Faces Rich Client, has enriched the user interface thanks to the use of 
technologies such as AJAX. 
After being consolidated in creating JEE solutions, Oracle JDeveloper was chosen 
as the standard tool for building solutions over the Fusion Middleware Platform. 
This platform supports solutions based on JEE, SO A, and Enterprise 2.0 using 
Oracle WebCenter. JDeveloper uses an extension in order to take advantage of key 
components in WebCenter such as the Framework, Services, and Composer. 
[ 1 2 ] 

Chapter 2 
Therefore, during the course of the book, we will use this tool to build our 
custom solutions. 
Summary 
The evolution of technology platforms and their use in new forms of socialization 
have led to the creation of Web 2.0, and the use of these concepts in the business 
environment is called Enterprise 2.0. With this motivation, Oracle introduced 
WebCenter as a platform for building Enterprise 2.0 solutions, which facilitate the 
development of collaborative environments in organizations. 
Finally Oracle JDeveloper is chosen to build those solutions using the platform 
offered by Oracle WebCenter. 
Now that we have the technology concepts in mind, we will begin developing our 
custom applications. But before that, we need to install and configure WebCenter. 
We'll do it in the following chapter. 
[ 1 3 ] 

WebCenter Installation and 
Configuration 
Oracle WebCenter 11g is outfitted with the latest components of the Oracle Fusion 
Middleware architecture. The WebLogic Application Server (which Oracle acquired 
from BEA), JDeveloper llg, support for Oracle l l g Database fully integrated Web 2.0 
services as well as Spaces. 
A diagram outlining the building blocks that you should be aware of during 
installation is shown as follows. We will use this building block diagram throughout 
the chapter to show you the components that are being installed. For a comprehensive 
guide to installing all WebCenter components, please refer to the "Oracle Fusion 
Middleware Enterprise Deployment Guide for WebCenter l l g Release 1".

WebCenter Installation and Configuration 
Hardware and software requirements 
Oracle WebCenter llg's hardware and software requirements broadly follow the 
minimum requirements for Oracle Fusion Middleware 11 g. The various requirement 
matrices can be found at h t t p : //www. o r a c l e . com/technology/software/ 
products /ias/files/ fusion_requirements . htm under "Oracle Fusion Middleware 
l l g System Requirements". 
High-level installation steps 
Following are the high-level installation steps for WebCenter llg, which you can 
refer to as you go through our step-by-step installation. 
1. 
Install a supported operating system (OS). 
2. 
Install a supported Oracle database to house the metadata repository. Oracle 
database versions from 10.2.0.4 to 11.0.7 are currently supported 
by WebCenter llg. 
3. 
Run the Repository Creation Utility (RCU) to create the metadata repository. 
4. 
Install Middleware Home (Oracle WebLogic Application Server) l l g R l 
(10.3.1). 
5. 
Install WebCenter Framework and Services. 
6. 
Configure WebLogic, WebCenter, and Web 2.0 Services. 
Step-by-step installation 
In this section, we will expand upon the high-level steps outlined previously and 
take you through a very detailed step-by-step walkthrough of the 
WebCenter l l g installation. 
1. 
Install a supported OS 
At the time of this writing, an official certification matrix was not available 
for WebCenter llg, but we are using Oracle Enterprise Linux 5.3, 32-bit in our 
environment with an Intel Core 2 Duo 2.13 GHz CPU and 3GB of RAM. We 
would consider this to be minimal hardware for a server environment, and 
WebCenter operated without any performance issues. As we understand, the 
following OSs will be supported: 
° 
AIX 
° 
HPUX 
° 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 
[ 1 6 ]

^ 
Step-by-step OS installation is out of scope for this book. 
J 
2. 
Preinstall steps 
° 
Create a group called oracle belonging to a group called dba 
to be used for the installation. 
° 
Ensure the /etc/hosts file is configured with a fully 
qualified domain (FQDN) name as the first entry. We used 
the following: 192 .168 . 1 . 74 w c l l g . m a n d s c o n s u l t i n g . com. 
° 
Ensure you have set the number of open file set on the OS. Set 
the appropriate limits in / e t c / s e c u r i t y / 1 i m i t s . c o n f by 
adding the following lines: 
o r a c l e s o f t nproc 2047 
o r a c l e hard nproc 
16384 
o r a c l e s o f t n o f i l e 
1024 
o r a c l e hard n o f i l e 
65536 
° 
Ensure Linux system settings are settings properly. Edit the / 
e t c / s y s c t l . conf file and add following lines: 
k e r n e l . s h m a l l 
= 2097152 
kernel.shmmax = 2147483648 
kernel.shmmni = 4096 
k e r n e l . s e m = 250 32000 100 128 
f s . f i l e - m a x = 6553600 
n e t . i p v 4 . i p _ l o c a l _ p o r t _ r a n g e 
= 1024 
65000 
n e t . c o r e . r m e m _ d e f a u l t 
= 41943 04 
net.core.rmem_max = 41943 04 
net.core.wmem_default 
= 262144 
net.core.wmem max = 262144

WebCenter Installation and Configuration 
Once you have made sure that the DB is running fine you need to increase 
the number of processes. The default number of processes is set to 40. 
However, for WebCenter the number of processes should be set to at least 
300. This can be done using the following command: 
a l t e r s y s t e m s e t p r o c e s s e s = 3 0 0 
s c o p e = s p f i l e ; 
Bounce the DB after changing the number of processes.

Congratulations! You are now done installing the underlying metadata repository. We 
are now ready to move into the WebLogic Application Server (Middleware Home). 
Installing Middleware Home 
In this section, we shall install Middleware Home (WebLogic Application Server) 
l l g R l (10.3.1). For those of you who have worked with previous Fusion Middleware 
products, or even WebCenter 10g, you will notice the default support for WebLogic 
Server is new as Oracle shifts direction after the BEA acquisition, moving away from 
Oracle's previous Application Server offering. 
Navigate to the WebLogic Application Server media and run the installer, 
following the graphical wizard. 
[ 2 5 ] 
www.allitebooks.com

WebCenter Installation and Configuration 
Once the wizard is launched, the welcome screen is shown. Click Next to proceed 
with the installation.

Installation of WebLogic server will create a Middleware directory where the 
Middleware is installed. We have selected the default directory suggested by the 
wizard. Click Next to proceed.

Oracle Fusion Middleware l l g WebCenter... 
| ~ 
Congratulations! You are now done installing the WebCenter Framework 
and Services. 
Summary 
In this chapter, we installed the core building blocks for WebCenter l l g in a Linux 
environment. These building blocks lay the plumbing for creating WebCenter 
composite applications, which are really brought to life through "tentacles" like web 
services, middleware components like SO A, and other business applications that are 
integrated through WebCenter's hot-pluggable architecture. 
Important Notes: 
• 
This is a single-server, standalone environment that can be quickly stood-up 
to accomplish the basic needs for testing and training. It does not take into 
account high availability, enterprise security, or other considerations that a 
production solution would typically require. 
• 
This environment will be used as the baseline for developing our sample 
application, so ensuring that you have been able to successfully complete the 
above steps is important. 
To begin WebCenter development, we will use the JDeveloper IDE, which we will 
review in the next chapter along with a simple example—WebCenter's version of 
"Hello World". 
[ 3 7 ]

Setting up the Development 
Environment 
After installing the components of Oracle WebCenter on the server side, it is 
necessary to prepare the development environment. 
As mentioned previously, the tool to construct Oracle WebCenter solutions is 
JDeveloper 11 g. This tool is commonly used for developing Java EE solutions; 
however, in this book we use it for building composite solutions. This means that 
we will combine different kinds of components like portlets, data access components 
(tables, list of values) and components that promote participation (discussions, 
wikis) into a single user interface, under the concept of a portal. 
Well, in this chapter, we will focus on preparing our development environment, 
which we will use for creating our WebCenter applications. 
So, in this chapter, we will cover the following topics: 
• 
JDeveloper l l g installation 
• 
Adding WebCenter extension for JDeveloper 
• 
Install Control Version System (Subversion) 
• 
Integrating JDeveloper with Subversion 
• 
Testing the integration of WebCenter server 
So, let's get down to work. 

Setting up the Development Environment 
Oracle JDeveloper 11 g installation 
During the development of this book, we will use the version Oracle JDeveloper 11 g 
Release 1 (11.1.1.1.0). 
System requirements 
When using the Windows operating system, the recommended system requirements 
are as follows: 
• 
Operating system: Windows Vista 
• 
Windows Server 2003 R2 
• 
Windows XP-Service Pack 2 
• 
CPU Type and Speed: Pentium IV 2 GHz or faster 
• 
Memory: 2 GB RAM 
• 
Display: 65536 colors, set to at least 1024 X 768 resolution 
• 
Hard Drive Space: 2.5 GB 
• 
JDK: JDK 6.0 Update 11 for Windows 
If you need to install the tool on any other operating system, see the Installation 
Guide 
for Oracle JDeveloper in the following link: 
h t t p : / / w w w . o r a c l e . c o m / t e c h n o l o g y / d o c u m e n t â t i o n / j d e v . h t m l 
Downloading the tool 
To start using it, we must first download it from the following page: 
h t t p : / / w w w . o r a c l e . c o m / t e c h n o l o g y / s o f t w a r e / p r o d u c t s / j d e v / i n d e x . h t m l

Version control system installation 
When working in a development team, it is advisable to use version manager software. 
For this reason, we will use a product called CollabNet Subversion, which is an open 
source Subversion project. 
We will install this software as follows: 
1. 
Download CollabNet Subversion from the following address: http : / / www.

The Subversion server uses an Apache web server, which allows us to 
access the subversion repository using the HTTP protocol. The Apache 
server uses port 80 and starts automatically every time you turn on 
the computer. 
5. 
Once you installed the repository it is necessary to create a project to save the 
WebCenter application code. To do this, open the Windows command-line 
options through Start | Run, type the command cmd, and press Enter. 
6. 
Go to repository directory, in our case c : \svn_repository: 
> cd c:\svn_repository 
7. 
Next, create the project webcenter_repository, which we will use to store 
versions in our code. The command is: 
> svnadmin create webcenter_repository 
8. 
Now edit the following Apache configuration file to allow for the register of 
users in the repository. 
C:\Program Files\CollabNet Subversion Server\httpd\conf\ 
httpd.conf 
[ 4 7 ] 

Setting up the Development Environment 
9. 
Go to the following section: 
«Location /svn> 
DAV svn 
SVNParentPath C:\svn_repository 
</Location> 
And modify it like this: 
«Location /svn> 
DAV svn 
SVNParentPath C:\svn_repository 
SVNListParentPath On 
Require valid-user 
AuthType Basic 
AuthName "Subversion Repository" 
AuthUserFile C:\svn_repository\password-file 
</Location> 
With this change, we are indicating that the users and passwords are 
extracted from the file password- file. 
10. Go to the installation directory of the subversion software: 
> cd c:\Program Files\CollabNet Subversion Server\httpd\bin 
11. In the next step, we are going to create users who access the repository. To 
create the admin user, use the htpasswd command as follows: 
> htpasswd -cm c:\svn_repository\password-file admin 
Then you will be prompted to enter the password the user will use. 
Hie - cm options are used to create the password file and encrypt 
passwords. To register more users only use the -m option, because we 
have created the password file, when we created the first user. Remember 
that you must create a user for each developer of your team. 
See the next sample: 
htpasswd -m c:\svn_repository\password-file joe 
12. Finally, to verify the server version installation, go to the following link: 
http://localhost/svn/. 
13. Enter the user and password information defined in the previous steps.

Testing WebCenter preconfigured server 
JDeveloper also includes a BEA WebLogic server that we will use to deploy and test 
our applications. In addition, this server provides a Portlet container, which offers a 
set of pre-built portlets, which we can take advantage of in our projects. For example, 
you can use the Web Clipping feature in order to capture content and functionality 
from existing websites. To confirm the availability of this server, we will do the 
following steps: 
1. 
Go to option File | New of JDeveloper.

Summary 
This chapter has helped us to prepare the development environment and the 
application server, in order to support our WebCenter applications. 
We will use JDeveloper to develop WebCenter solutions and its container WebLogic 
as a repository of portlets. 
Additionally, we have installed server version manager software that will help us 
to maintain control of changes in the project and will also allow the participation of 
many developers in the construction of the solution. 
Once our development environment is ready, in the next chapter, we can start 
building our first WebCenter using JDeveloper.

Getting Started with 
WebCenter Development: 
Hello World(s) 
Before we jump into developing our Enterprise 2.0 Intranet, we will create a simple 
WebCenter application to demonstrate the tools, development methodology, and 
deployment of custom WebCenter applications. 
This chapter will go through detailed step-by-step instructions to provide you 
with the knowledge you will need to succeed while implementing the example 
throughout the rest of the book, and on your own project. 
I'm sure you noticed that the title of this chapter contains the phrase "Hello 
World(s)", where the "(s)" sticks out like a sore thumb. This is intentional, but not to 
say we are building multiple WebCenter examples, nor is it to subliminally proclaim 
and acknowledge the existence of an alien race. The fact is that a single WebCenter 
Hello World application is best exemplified in its entirety when built up by a few 
Hello World components. We will show you a web service, consumed by a portlet, 
consumed by a WebCenter application. 
• 
HelloWorldWS: A simple web service that exposes a single method to say 
hello to an input name 
• 
HelloWorldPortlet: A Standards-based Java Portlet that uses the 
HelloWorldWS web service

• 
HelloWorldApp: A WebCenter application that consumes the

Building Up to a WebCenter Hello

Hello World WebCenter Application 
Hello World Portlet 
Hello World Web Service 
To be clear, the simplest possible WebCenter Hello World application does not 
require all of these components, but we have chosen this path so you have broader 
foundational knowledge. 
Prerequisites 
This tutorial uses JDeveloper 11 g running on Windows platform. We will use the 
integrated Web Logic Server present in JDeveloper for testing the applications 
developed during the course of this tutorial. We will not walk through the 
installation of the OS or JDeveloper l l g in this chapter. 
Creating the Hello World web service 
We will begin by creating a HelloWorld web service based on a Java class. This class 
exposes one method sayHello, which takes a string name as an input parameter and 
outputs Hello name. 
Step 0: Start Oracle JDeveloper 11 g 
The welcome screen of JDeveloper shows the Tip of the Day. It is a good way of 
learning various features about JDeveloper. Close the Tip of the Day window.

From the Application Template list, select Generic Application. The Generic 
Application template is suitable when you intend to manually select the technology 
scope of the project. Choose a name for the application, HelloWorldwsApp in this case. 
Click Next. 
Note the various templates present including Portlet Producer 
Application and WebCenter Application towards the end of 
the list. If you do not find the aforementioned templates listed, then 
the most likely cause is that WebCenter extensions for JDeveloper 
are not installed.

Congratulations! You have completed this tutorial and built a complete Hello World 
WebCenter application. 
Summary 
In this tutorial, you created a HelloWorld web service, which was used by a 
Hello World portlet producer. The portlet producer was consumed by a HelloWorld 
WebCenter application. 
You have accomplished a verification of your development environment and gained 
confidence in being able to build the foundational components and skills needed for 
WebCenter development. 
In the next chapter, we will begin with ABC's Intranet building the base pages. 
[ 9 9 ]

Design and Personalization 
Applications developed with Oracle WebCenter combine the data of traditional 
information systems with collaborative resources like Wikis, Discussions, and Blogs. 
Therefore, in this chapter, we will teach you how to develop traditional applications. 
In subsequent chapters, you will learn how to add collaborative resources to the 
traditional applications, in order to convert them into Enterprise 2.0 solutions. 
In this chapter, we will touch upon the following items: 
• 
Getting Started with ADF Faces Rich Client framework 
• 
Creating a WebCenter Application 
• 
Using templates 
• 
Building data components 
• 
Developing of a sample page 
OK, let's start to build a traditional application. 
ADF Faces Rich Client components 
ADF Faces Rich Client is a group of components used to build rich user interfaces. 
The key to these components is the use of AJAX technology, which allows our users 
to enjoy experiences and visual effects that are similar to those found on desktop 
applications (for example, EJM swing applications). These types of applications are 
called Rich Internet Applications (RIA). 

Design and Personnlizntion 
Types of ADF Faces components 
ADF Faces Rich Client components can be classified according to functionality into 
the following types. 
Components 
Description 
Layout components 
Input components 
Table and Tree components 
LOV components 
Pop-up components 
Menu and Toolbar components 
Output components 
Label and Message components 
Navigations components 
These components are used to define regions on 
the page that will serve as containers for other 
components. 
Used to allow the entry of any type of 
information. 
Used to display information using organized 
structures. 
We'll use these components to display lists. 
Used to generate pop-ups in our pages. 
Types of components used to create a menu of 
options in our applications. 
Used to display information in different formats. 
Such components will help us to place descriptive 
tags onto our components. 
Used to facilitate the flow between pages. 
Creating a new application 
To develop an application with Oracle WebCenter, perform the following steps: 
1. 
Execute JDeveloper, using the option Oracle Fusion Middleware | 
JDdeveloper Studio from the Windows Start Menu. 
2. 
Once in the tool, choose the option File | N e w in order to start the wizard. 
Next, choose WebCenter Application option and press the OK button, as 
shown in following screenshot:

consists of two projects: one for using the Content Repository to view content 
within your application and another project for view and controller components 
that consume WebCenter services and the portlets.

In the next page, we define the following information: 
° 
Name: Identifies the name of the application. In our case, our 
application will be called Paracas. 
° 
Directory: This defines the directory where we will store the 
code of our application. For the project, the directory will be 
c: \Paracas, so you need to create it beforehand. Henceforth, 
we will refer to that directory by <app_directory>. 
° 
Application Package Prefix: We will use this property in 
order to identify the root package from which we build our 
applications. The current application has the com. paracas 
package as a root.

Click Finish to create the new application. 
Including a template for our application 
Before starting the development of any page, it is necessary to create a template that 
has the colors and logos that identify our company. All the pages of our application 
will use this template in order to reduce the design time for each page. The steps for 
this activity are as follows: 
1. 
Go to the Application Palette, right-click on the project ViewController, and 
choose New.

Building pages with database interaction 
At this point, we have a custom template for all our pages. Now, let's use it for 
building a page with database access. As always, we start with a brief overview of 
the technologies to use. 
ADF Business Components 
ADF Business Components is a framework for implementing a persistence and 
business layer in our JEE applications. It's easy to use and improves the productivity. 
Furthermore, we can add business logic over the components. 
The architecture of ADF Business Components includes the following components: 
• 
Entity: This is a Java Component that represents a specific source of 
information (that is, a database table). 
• 
View Object: This component will be used to implement queries in order to 
access the data. 
• 
Application Module: The principal business rules of our applications will 
be defined in this component. Generally, we have an application module for 
each case we use. 
[

Creating a persistence layer 
First, we will create a schema and execute the relevant script. Make sure you have 
downloaded the script from the book's website into your directory. This script will 
create data and structures that will be used in our application. 
Creating a Schema for our application 
For this exercise, it is necessary to have an Oracle database. The following exercise is 
made using an Oracle 10g Express Edition database. 
Using the command line of your database, run the following instructions: 
1. 
Connect to the database as a dba user, like sys or system. 
[ 1 1 4 ]

2. 
Execute the following command: 
SQL> c r e a t e u s e r p a r a c a s i d e n t i f i e d b y p a r a c a s 
3. 
Give privileges to the paracas user: 
S Q L > g r a n t c o n n e c t , r e s o u r c e to p a r a c a s ; 
4. 
Connect as the paracas user: 
SQL> c o n n p a r a c a s / p a r a c a s ; 
5. 
Execute the script from this location: 
SQL> start

Design and Personnlizntion 
Notice that the page only displays the contents of the first region, 
because the others regions are empty. In the following chapters, 
we will continue to work with this page by adding other features 
to the available regions. 
Summary 
In this chapter, we have seen how to develop templates and add data-access features 
to our WebCenter applications. 
If you require further details of data access in applications, we encourage you to 
review the Fusion Developer's Guide for Oracle Application 
Development 
Framework 
at 
the following address: 
http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E12 8 3 9_01/web.Illl/b31974.pdf 
[ 1 2 6 ]

Portlets 
In the previous chapter, we looked at how to build a page containing information 
on our example company's requirements, and the offers made by its suppliers. Now, 
we are interested in adding a chart to that page that graphically shows the status 
of requirements pending and closed, as a percentage. However, this graph will not 
only be required on this page but in many others. Therefore, it is necessary build this 
chart as a reusable component. In this kind of scenario, the technology of portlets 
can help us. 
A portlet is a component of software that can be part of a page. In consequence, a 
page can be enriched by many portlets allowing us to grab the contents of various 
sources of data. This chapter will help us to understand the concept associated with 
this technology and how it can apply to our projects with Oracle WebCenter. 
During this chapter, you will learn the following: 
• 
JSF specification concepts 
• 
The types of portlets you can build with WebCenter 
• 
Developing a portlet using ADF 
• 
Integrating portlets with custom Applications 

Portlets 
Portlets, JSR-168 specification 
Specification JSR-168, which defines the Java technologies, gives us a precise 
definition of Java portlets: 
Portlets are web components - like Servlets - specifically designed to be aggregated 
in the context of a composite page. Usually, many Portlets are invoked to in the 
single request of a Portal page. Each Portlet produces a fragment of markup that is 
combined with the markup of other Portlets, all within the Portal page 
markup. 
f 
You can see more detail of this specification on the following page: 
I 
http://j cp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=16 8 
I 
While the definition makes a comparison with servlets, it is important to note that 
the portlets cannot be accessed directly through a URL; instead, it is necessary to use 
a page-like container of portlets. 
Consequently, we might consider portlets as tiny web applications that return 
dynamic content (HTML, WML) into a region of a Portal page. 
Graphically, we could view a page with portlets as follows: 
Portal Page 
Portal Static 
Contet 
(Text, Images) 
Portlet (Dynamic Content) 
Portlet (Dynamic 
Content) 
Portal Static Contet (Text, Images) 
Additionally, we must emphasize that the portlets are not isolated from the rest of 
the components in the pages, but can also share information and respond to events 
that occur in other components or portlets. 
[ 1 2 8 ] 

Chapter 2 
WSRP specification 
The WSRP specification allows exposing portlets as Web services. For this purpose, 
clients access portlets through an interface (* . wsdl) and get graphic content 
associated. Optionally, the portlet might be able to interact directly with the user 
through events ocurring on them. 
This way of invoking offers the following advantages: 
• 
The portals that share a portlet centralize their support in a single point. 
• 
The portlet integration with the portal is simple and requires 
no programming. 
• 
The use of portlets, hosted on different sites, helps to reduce the load 
on servers. 
WebCenter portlets 
Portlets can be built in different ways, and the applications developed with Oracle 
WebCenter can consume any of these types of portlets. 
• 
JSF Portlets: This type of portlet is based on a JSF application, which is used 
to create a portlet using a JSF Portlet Bridge. 
[ 1 2 9 ] 

Portlets 
• 
Web Clipping: Using this tool, we can build portlets declaratively using only 
a browser. These portlets show content from other sites. 
• 
OmniPortlet: These portlets can retrieve information from different types 
of data sources (XML, CSV, database, and so on) to expose different ways of 
presenting things, such as tables, forms, charts, and so on. 
• 
Content Presenter: This allows you to drop content from UCM on the page 
and display this content in any way you like or using a template. 
• 
Ensemble: This is a way to "mashup" or produce portlets or "pagelets" of 
information that can be displayed on the page. 
• 
Programmatic Portlets: Obviously, in addition to the previous technologies 
that facilitate the construction of portlets, it is also possible to build in a 
programmatic way. When we build in this way, we reach a high degree of 
personalization and control. However, we need specialized Java knowledge 
in order to program in this way. 
As we can see, there are several ways in which we can build a portlet; however, in 
order to use the rich components that the ADF Faces framework offers, we will 
focus on JSF Portlets. 
The portlet that we will build will have a chart, which shows the status of the 
company's requests. To do this, we must create a model layer that represents our 
business logic and exposes this information in a page. 
Therefore, we are going to do the following steps: 
1. 
Create an ADF application. 
2. 
Develop business components. 
3. 
Create a chart page. 
4. 
Generate a portlet using the page. 
5. 
Deploy the portlet. 
Developing a portlet using ADF 
In this example, we use a page for the construction of a portlet; however, 
ADF also offers the ability to create portlets based on a flow of pages 
through the use of ADF TaskFlows. You can find more information on 
the following link: 
http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E15 52 3_01/web.1111/

Consuming a port let 
After the construction and deployment of the portlet, it's time for it to be re-used by 
another application. For this, it is necessary to create a reference to this portlet in the 
application that needs to use it. Let's see the steps for this integration: 
1. 
In the Application Navigator, change the current application ParacasPortlet 
to the Paracas Application, which we were building in Chapter 5, Design 
and 
Personalization.

Chapter 6 
Summary 
This chapter has shown us the power of portlets, a mechanism that can be reused 
between pages. In this case, we have taken advantage of the JSF and wizards offered 
by JDeveloper to quickly build graphical components. 
In this chapter, we discovered the features offered by portlets as a technique 
of component reuse. Also, we applied this technology to build a portlet using 
JDeveloper. Next, we hosted the said component in a repository offered by Oracle 
WebCenter. Finally, we consumed this portlet through our Paracas portal, which 
we built earlier in this book.

Discussions. Wiki and Blog 
Services 
The Oracle WebCenter Discussions Service provides a forum tool that can be used 
within the organization to share information and foster collaboration. Forums are 
one of the most popular information exchange mechanisms used on the Internet. 
We are all familiar with the power of forums to create user communities and 
disseminate information. 
If you have used the Oracle Technology Network Forums, the WebCenter 
Discussions Service will look very familiar to you —both use the same 
powerful forum software.

Discussions, Wiki, and Blog Services 
Some of the common challenges we have found with implementing forums for the 
enterprise have been related to the following: 
1. 
Integration into the existing technology stack 
2. 
User and group administration using existing LDAP 
3. 
Support 
4. 
Cultural adoption 
Many of the most popular forum software solutions have been based on PHP and 
MySQL. Not long ago, we implemented the open source phpBB solution for an 
Oracle Fusion Middleware customer. Most of the implementation time and cost 
was spent in integrating with the existing Portal infrastructure and identity 
management components. 
With Discussions, Oracle has successfully minimized the technical level of effort 
required during implementation by addressing the main technical challenges 
(numbers 1 and 2 above). And with formal support offered, as well as the general idea 
that forums integration using Discussions will not be unique for each implementation, 
organizations can feel more comfortable about viable long-term support. Given 
how well Discussions addresses the first three challenges, we now view the cultural 
adoption as the largest challenge, which can be overcome with effective training and 
strategic management decisions. Forums in general have become increasingly popular 
within organizations and Oracle has implemented an intuitive end-user approach. 
The Discussions Server is installed as part of Oracle WebCenter installation. It can be 
accessed directly at the default location http: / /hostname: 8 8 90/owc_discussions. 
While Discussions in itself is a useful forum tool, the real power comes from the 
Discussions Service that enables us to embed, view, and interact with the forums 
as part of custom WebCenter applications where forums can be used as a means to 
obtain and share information by the enterprise from within the current application 
being used. 
A Wiki is a website that allows a group of editors to easily create web pages in a 
collaborative manner using simple markup language. The markup language helps 
to organize and format the web pages. Many corporations use Wikis to create 
documentation internally. Each employee of the company has easy access to edit the 
information within the wiki, and can therefore incorporate new information for the 
entire community. 
[ 1 5 2 ] 

Chapter 6 
A Blog is a website that allows an individual author to post a stream of content for a 
community to view. The word "Blog" is derived from the contraction of "Web Log". 
Each item in the Blog stream can be viewed as an article. An article can be something 
as simple as a video or image posting, or something as formal as a newspaper 
article. It is up to the author to decide what content to post. Typically, authors allow 
members of a community to engage in dialog related to the blog article by allowing 
them to post comments on the article. 
Both the Wild Service and the Blog Service depend on the WebCenter Wiki and Blog 
Server. Both services use a single connection to the single backend server. 
In this chapter, we will do the following: 
• 
Walk you through creating a custom WebCenter application that leverages 
the Discussions Service 
• 
Present a handful of task flows 
• 
Show you where to find key pieces of information required to configure your 
Discussions Service connection in your custom application 
• 
Learn how to integrate a custom WebCenter application with the Wiki and 
Blog Services, specifically, using an IFrame and using the Web Clipping Portlet 
Discussions configuration 
Our application is built with JDeveloper 11 g and connects to the Oracle WebCenter 
Discussions Server. Ensure that the Discussions Server is running by connecting to 
the Discussions Server URL (http: / /hostname : 8890/owc_discussions). It is a 
good idea to populate the Discussions Server with some example users, categories, 
and forums. The Forums Admin Console is used to create new users and forums. The 
admin console can be accessed at http: //hostname : 88 9 0/owc_discussions/admin. 
Hie default admin username is weblogic and the password 
I 
is weblogic. This is irrespective of any username/password 
I 
specified at installation time.

not limited to the following:

We will not focus on configuring all aspects of the forum, but instead the main pieces 
required to get started and integrated into WebCenter. Specifically, we will focus 
on users/groups, and the overall forum content structure. Jive documentation is 
thorough and explains individual settings in detail. 
[ 1 5 4 ] 

Chapter 6 
Content structure 
The general structure for Discussions is as follows: 
• 
Categories: logical grouping of discussions content 
° 
Subcategories: optional subgrouping(s) 
• 
Forums: Lowest-level grouping where end users can create 
discussion threads 
• 
Threads: Entries made by end users, which contain 
the original entry as well as replies 
Within the Forums Admin Console, you can define a structure that makes sense for 
your organization. The same principles that apply to other forum software will apply 
to Discussions content structure. 
For the purpose of this demo, we have created a Marketing category and a 
Marketing Ideas forum. 
Create Forum 
Main » Create Forun 
Use the form below to create a forum. The category where the forum will be created is displayed below.There are four permission presets to choose from. By default when you 
create a forum, permissions will be inherited or will match the system default. After creating the forum you can adjust the forum permissions on a finer-grain level.

Chapter 6 
As shown previously, we have added two users —amit and jimmy—with the 
appropriate privileges to post to the Marketing Ideas forum. 
Integrating Discussions with WebCenter 
During the remainder of this chapter, we will create a custom WebCenter application, 
which will integrate with the Discussions Server and in which we will expose a view of 
the forum that allows you to interact with the forum using task flows. 
Oracle exposes multiple task flows for the Discussions service. We have listed all the 
out-of-box task flows in the following table and bolded the ones we will drop into 
our WebCenter application: 
Task Flow 
Description 
Discussions Forums 
This task flow shows all the topics associated with a 
specified forum. Users can create, read, update, and 
delete topics based on their privileges. 
Discussions - Popular Topics 
Shows the popular topics under a given category ID 
or forum ID. 
Discussions - Recent Topics 
Shows all the recent topics under a given category ID 
or forum ID. 
Discussions - Watched Forums 
Allows users to see all their watched forums under a 
given category ID. 
Discussions - Watched Topics 
Allows users to see all their watched topics under a 
given category ID or forum ID. 
Discussions -- Sidebar View 
This shows a combined view of the Popular Topics, 
Recent Topics, Watched Topics, and Watched 
Forums task flows. 
The main steps we will complete are as follows: 
1. 
Ensure the Discussions Server is running 
2. 
Create a WebCenter application 
3. 
Create a connection to the Discussions Server 
4. 
Create a JSF page 
5. 
Select appropriate Discussions Service Task Flow and embed it in the page 
6. 
Deploy, run, and test the application 
[ 1 5 7 ] 

Discussions, Wiki, and Blog Services 
Ensuring the Discussions Server is running 
Before we start developing the application, ensure that the WebCenter Discussions 
Server is running. If the Discussions Server is not running then start the WLS_ 
Services managed server as described in the WebCenter Installation and 
Configuration 
chapter. Using a browser, open the URL for Discussions (for example, http : / / 
hostname :8890/owc_discussions). 
Log in with the newly created users and post some sample articles.

Creating a connection to the Discussion Forum 
In order to use the Discussions Service in our application, we need to create a 
Discussions Forum connection to the Discussions Server. This connection will be 
used by the application to connect to the backend Discussions Server. Note that it is 
possible to modify the connection after the application is deployed to the Web Logic 
server by using the Enterprise Manager Fusion Middleware Control. 
To set up the discussions connection, right-click on the Connections node in 
Application Resources pane and select New Connection | Discussions Forum.

Integrating Wiki and Blog with 
WebCenter 
There are three primary methods of integrating the Oracle WebCenter Wiki and Blog 
Server into custom WebCenter applications. They are as follows: 
1. 
Using an IFrame, which you include in a page in your custom 
WebCenter application. 
[ 1 6 5 ] 

Discussions, Wiki, and Blog Services 
2. 
Using any portlet capable of consuming a URL such as the 
Web Clipping portlet. 
3. 
Using the Web Services provided, which requires a custom-built user 
interface. We will not cover this method in detail. 
In this chapter, we will illustrate the use of the first two methods. For details on how 
to use the Web Services interface to the Wiki and Blog Server, refer to the Oracle 
WebCenter Developer's guide. 
Prerequisites 
Before we start developing the custom WebCenter application to integrate with the 
Wiki and Blog Server, we should ensure that the WebCenter Wiki and Blog Server 
is running. If the Wiki and Blog Server is not running then start the WLS_Services 
managed server as described in the WebCenter Installation and Configuration 
chapter. Using a browser, open the URL for Wiki main page (for example, http: // 
hostname: 8890/owc_wiki).

Creating a new WebCenter Application 
Using JDeveloper, create a new application selecting the WebCenter Application 
template. The steps to be followed are similar to the ones for HelloWorldApp in 
Chapter 4, Getting Started with WebCenter 
Development.

In the following sections, we will demonstrate how to add the Wiki and Blog 
Server to a custom WebCenter application using the Web Clipping Portlet. Oracle 
WebCenter Framework includes a Web Clipping Portlet that we can register with 
our custom WebCenter application. On running the application in the browser we 
can consume the Wiki and Blog Server URL using the Web Clipping Studio.

Chapter 8 
Finally, you must select the areas you would like the Web Clipping Portlet to clip, 
and then save your settings. 
This completes our demonstration of how to integrate Oracle WebCenter Wiki and 
Blog Server with custom WebCenter application using an iFrame and using a Web 
Clipping Portlet. 
Summary 
In this chapter, we have started on the path of integrating WebCenter services 
into our custom WebCenter application. We have demonstrated how the useful 
Discussion Forums Service can be used to create a view of the forum in 
our application. 
We demonstrated simple ways to incorporate the Wiki and Blog Services into your 
custom WebCenter applications. Utilizing these services within your organization 
can lead to dramatically improved communications and productivity. Individuals 
can even benefit from leveraging these services. For example, a user can use a Wiki 
as a personal notepad, and a Blog as a personal diary. 
[ 1 7 5 ]

Search Service 
In the previous chapter we have seen how to integrate various WebCenter 
collaboration tools such as Wiki, Blogs, and Discussions. These collaboration tools 
allow sharing of information in the enterprise allowing collective knowledge to be 
built and stored. One of the primary means of accessing the information is by using a 
search tool. WebCenter caters to this need by providing a built-in Search Service. 
In this chapter, we will explore the WebCenter Search Service, Tags and Links, and 
RSS. The Search Service allows WebCenter applications to search resources owned 
by other services. Search is a powerful tool in discovering information from and 
linking various WebCenter applications. 
By creating a sample application, we will demonstrate how to integrate WebCenter 
Search Service in your custom WebCenter application. 
Tags and Links are useful tools in organizing information for easy search and 
for creating context between different pieces of information. By creating links 
to different resources, we can promote reuse and avoid duplicating the same 
information at multiple locations. For example, in a discussion thread, a link can 
be created to another document that is being discussed or has more information 
about the subject matter, thus providing easy access to additional information stored 
elsewhere in the enterprise. Tags, on the other hand, enable labeling resources for 
easy discovery in Search and provide a loose organization of information. When 
users tag a resource, they are able to search quickly for the resource based on their 
own ad hoc label. 
Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is an important tool that allows us to collect 
information from multiple sources and present it at a single location. A typical use of 
RSS is to read (updated) information from multiple websites in a single RSS Reader. 
Custom WebCenter applications can use the RSS Service to present the information

Search Service 
Specifically, we will be covering these topics: 
• 
Role of search in WebCenter applications 
• 
Methods of integrating the Search Service in WebCenter applications 
• 
An example showing how to integrate Search task flows in a custom 
WebCenter application 
•

Search in enterprise applications 
With the growth in the amount of information collected and stored in the enterprise, 
it is important to have tools that ease the discovery of information in documents, 
blogs, forums, and so on. Search is the most popular mechanism by which 
information can be located. WebCenter provides a convenient service that allows 
easy integration with WebCenter applications opening up the benefits of Search to 
any custom WebCenter application. Using the WebCenter Search task flows, we can 
search through the resources owned by the application. Most WebCenter services 
such as Wiki, Blogs, Discussions, and Documents support Search. 
Integrating the WebCenter Search 
Service 
In a custom WebCenter application, we can use the Search Service to provide a 
convenient search facility to search other WebCenter services that are used in the 
application. In general, any WebCenter Web 2.0 service that owns resources supports 
Search, including announcements, discussions, documents, tags, and the Page service. 
Search Service can be integrated with the custom WebCenter application using a 
number of task flows. They are listed as follows: 
Task Flow 
Description 
Search 
This is the most comprehensive of the task flows and provides 
options for searching, refining, and saving search results. 
Search Preferences 
This task flow lets you select which WebCenter services to search. 
You can also set preferences such as the order of the columns 
available in search results.

Chapter 8 
Task Flow 
Description 
Search - Saved 
Searches 
Search Toolbar 
This task flow lets users run their saved searches from within the 
application. 
This task flow lets users quickly enter simple search criteria and 
search from the application. 
In order to demonstrate the use of Search in a custom WebCenter application, we 
will create an application that connects to the Discussions Server. We will then use 
the Search task flow to provide a search facility to the Discussions Server from within 
the custom application developed. 
Ensuring that the WebCenter Wiki and Blog 
Server are running 
Before we start developing the application, ensure that the WebCenter Discussions 
Server is running. If the Discussions Server is not running, then start the 
WLS_services managed server as described in Chapter 2. 
Creating a new WebCenter Application 
Using JDeveloper, create a new Application selecting the WebCenter Application 
template. The steps to be followed are similar to the ones used in HelloWorldApp 
and therefore we will not repeat them here.

Chapter 8 
Integrating the WebCenter Tags service 
Tags are the rage in the world of Web 2.0. Tags allow consumers of information 
classify the information rather than the publisher. Amongst the various uses of tags, 
classification, bookmarking and enhancing search are the most popular. WebCenter 
Tags service allows end users to tag various resources including pages and documents. 
Tagging promotes collaboration among the users of the resource by enabling sharing 
of tags. This allows other users to discover the tagged items in their search. 
Requirements for the Tags service 
In order to integrate the Tags service in a custom WebCenter application, we need 
a connection to a database that has the WebCenter schema installed. There are no 
additional requirements to use the Tags service. In this chapter, we will use the 
WebCenter schema that was installed during WebCenter installation. 
Integrating with the WebCenter Tags 
service 
We will see how to integrate with WebCenter Tags in the following section.

Configuring ADF Security 
ADF Security is a protection framework to authorize user access to iterator, action 
and attribute bindings. While any user can tag pages (anonymous role), in order for 
tagged resources to appear in search results, the application must be secured. In this 
step, we will configure ADF Security to secure our application.

Why to use the WebCenter RSS Service 
The RSS Service allows you to integrate content available via RSS feeds into your 
custom WebCenter application. RSS is an extremely popular means of disseminating 
changes to web pages. This is particularly popular with websites where the pages are 
updated frequently such as news sites. The WebCenter RSS View Task Flow makes it 
trivial to include RSS content in WebCenter applications. 
[ 1 9 9 ]

Requirements for the WebCenter RSS 
Service 
The RSS Service doesn't require any other resource. All you need to do is to include 
the RSS View Task Flow in your custom WebCenter application. If there is an HTTP 
proxy in the environment then the proxy needs to be configured using Tools | 
Preferences | Web Browser and Proxy. 
Integrating the WebCenter RSS Service 
The steps are explained as follows:

Search Service 
Summary 
In this chapter, we demonstrated the use of the Search Service provided by 
WebCenter. By using the Search task flows available in JDeveloper, we can quickly 
integrate the Search Service in any custom WebCenter application. 
We learned how to integrate with two key WebCenter services, the Tags Service 
and the Links Service. By integrating with the above mentioned services, custom 
WebCenter applications can benefit from the information organizing and discovery 
features provided by WebCenter. The ability to label information for easy discovery 
and linking to other resources allows enterprises to benefit from better 
organized knowledge. 
We demonstrated how to use the RSS Viewer task flow as a means to display 
information obtained from RSS feeds. WebCenter RSS Service makes it very easy to 
integrate with sources of information that provide an RSS interface. This enables easy 
collection and display of information from RSS feeds in your application.

Personalization with Oracle 
Composer 
Traditionally, only the technology professionals were in charge of designing and 
maintaining the information for companies' sites. This was due to the high technical 
expertise that was needed to build web pages. 
The emergence of enterprise portals promoted the participation of users in the design 
and content of information. However, with the technologies available at that time 
(HTML and JavaScript), we couldn't develop rich user interfaces in content 
and presentation. 
The arrival of new technologies (AJAX, XML, Web 2.0, RSS ,and others) have helped 
to improve the maintenance and creation of portals. 
Oracle Composer, one of the keys components of WebCenter, takes advantage of 
these new technologies to enable end users to improve the design and content of 
their interfaces in friendly and intuitive ways. In this chapter, we will work with 
Oracle WebCenter in two parts: 
• 
In the first part, as developers, we will prepare the environment for end users. 
• 
Then, we will assume the role of end user to personalize the page defined in 
the previous step. 
Oracle Composer for developers 
Oracle composer offers a highly functional design environment for end users. To 
achieve this, developers need to prepare an environment, which will be used by end 
users to design their content. 
What we will show next are just the Oracle composer components to be used by 
developers to prepare such an environment. 

Personnlizntion with Oracle Composer 
The tool that we will use for the preparation of this environment is Oracle 
JDeveloper, which helps us to define the regions that will subsequently be used by 
end users to personalize their content. 
Types of Oracle Components 
Oracle Components can be classified according to functionality in the 
following types: 
• 
Common Components 
° 
Change Mode Button: This a button which permits users to 
switch from runtime mode to design mode. 
° 
Change Mode Link: This link has the same purpose as the 
previous component. 
° 
Image Link: This component provides a link with an 
associated image. 
° 
Page Customizable: With this component, we can create a 
region whose content can be changed dynamically by users. 
• 
Layout Components 
° 
Panel Customizable: This panel serves as a container for the 
components that the user chooses in runtime mode. 
° 
Layout Customizable: This is another type of container that 
is characterized by allowing the user to divide it in 
several ways. 
° 
Show Detail Frame: This container is characterized by 
providing a region similar to portlets. It can be used 
to include an item. 
• 
Operation Components. 
° 
Custom Action: This component can invoke a taskflow. 
Building an environment with 
Oracle Composer 
Before end users can customize its content, developers need to prepare the dynamic 
environment. In order for the developer to achieve this goal, execute the 
following steps:

Once the page is created, we will only use the region customRight. Therefore, 
in the component palette choose the category ADF Faces and drag the Panel 
Box control onto the region customRight in order to define a container.

The Panel Customizable container does not allow the user to divide the 
region in other ways. For that reason, we are removing that container and 
we are going to replace it with a Layout Customizable container which has 
that capability. So, first remove the container, Customizable Panel by 
right-clicking on the container and choosing the Delete option.

Oracle Composer for end users 
Once the environment has been prepared, it is time that the end user can 
customize their content. 
Before performing the customization, it is important to know the following 
technologies, which are behind the Oracle Composer. 
[ 2 1 2 
] 

Chapter 10 
Oracle Metadata Service and Oracle Composer allow each user to customize the 
content of the pages. In this way, each user will have a different version of a base page. 
You'll probably wonder: how does this act on Oracle Composer? The answer is 
thanks to Oracle Metadata Service. 
This technology allows us to store any user customizations in a repository based 
on XML. That is, at run time, any customizations made by users, do not change the 
application code but are stored in XML files associated with each user of 
the application. 
Resource catalog 
The resource catalog has the components that end users can use in design mode to 
customize his content. 
Generally, the tool provides a default set of components, but this can be configured 
to expose portlets, task flow, JSF components, and other types of components.

29. From now on, every time you run the page again, you find that the changes 
are maintained. You probably wonder, Where are these changes? The answer 
is simple, in the metadata of the project. That is, in an XML file that has been 
generated in the application. You can find this file in the following path: 
C : \ P a r a c a s \ m d s \ m d s s y s \ c u s t \ s i t e \ s i t e \ c u s t o m I n f o r m a t i o n . j spx.xml 
30. You can open the file with Notepad and find all the changes made by 
the user. 
31. Let's delete the metadata file using the Windows Explorer in order to drop 
the user customization. 
32. Execute the page again and you should see the same page without 
any customizations. 
Summary 
Oracle Composer opens a lot of possibilities for content personalization. This 
technology helps end users to create their content and combine it with external 
information. In this way, they can share and transfer their knowledge to all members 
of the company and therefore, improve the productivity of the organization. 
In the following chapters, we will use this technology in a product called Oracle 
Spaces, and we'll learn how end users can continue to generate their own content.

Oracle WebCenter Spaces 
Overview 
Recent improvements in communications technology have helped to facilitate 
interaction and collaboration between people. Tools such as e-mails and chats are 
tangible proof of this. 
Imagine the productivity that can achieved by consolidating these Web 2.0 tools 
in one solution focused on promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing of the 
working groups of our companies! 
Precisely, this is one of the benefits that Oracle WebCenter Spaces offers. In 
addition to improving the productivity of working groups, this solution also helps 
improve the working environments of every employee of the company. Unlike 
other technologies of the WebCenter suite (WebCenter Framework, WebCenter 
Composer), Oracle WebCenter Spaces is a prebuilt application. However, the IT team 
can help in the configuration and personalization of this solution. 
It is important to note that Oracle Web Center Spaces is a solution that uses all the 
technologies that we have studied throughout the book. 
This chapter shows how to configure and customize Oracle WebCenter Spaces. 
Additionally, we are going to create personal and working group environments 
with this technology. 

Ornele WebCenter Spaces Ouervieiv 
Oracle WebCenter Spaces 
As we indicated in the introduction, WebCenter Spaces boosts performance of users 
and groups. To do so, it offers two environments: 
• 
Oracle WebCenter Personal Spaces: This is designed to give users a 
personalized environment and is highly productive. Using this feature, the 
users can customize their environment in order to add access for common 
applications, visualization of indicators (percentage of sales, meeting goals), 
and key documents among other features that offer Web 2.0 environments. 
• 
Oracle WebCenter Group Spaces: This is used by working groups to 
boost their productivity thanks to the many communication tools and the 
collaborative environment that is offered. The working groups could be 
associated with areas of the company (purchasing, HR), projects (launch 
of new products, implementation of new systems) or any grouping required 
by the organization. 
Oracle WebCenter Personal Spaces 
This feature of WebCenter enables the end user to personalize his or her work 
environment in order to be more productive. 
To achieve this, WebCenter Personal Spaces allows the user to construct an 
environment that gives access to their personal e-mail, their recent documents, their 
favorite forums, their worklist items coming from any BPEL server, and a list 
of applications to quickly access. 
In addition, it provides them with access to their personal social network of users 
and experts. 
Joining these tools in one context is what gives Oracle WebCenter Personal Spaces. 
Oracle WebCenter Group Spaces 
Group Spaces aims to provide a collaborative environment for the working groups of 
the organization. For example, members of a project or employees of a business area 
of the company. 
Group Spaces allows customizing content, sharing resources, and provides an 
environment for workgroups.

Oracle WebCenter Spaces installation 
Oracle WebCenter installation is detailed on the official website of Oracle: 
h t t p : / / w w w . o r a c l e . c o m / t e c h n o l o g y / p r o d u c t s / w e b c e n t e r / i n d e x . h t m l 
Consider the following points during installation: 
• 
It is necessary to have an Oracle database version 10.2.0.4 and higher or 
11.1.0.7 and higher. However, with Patchset 1 it's possible use MS SQL Server 
and IBM DB2. 
• 
You must run the Repository Creation Utility (RCU) to create the schemas 
required for WebCenter Spaces to work. 
Both products can be downloaded from: http: //www. oracle. com/ 
t e c h n o l o g y / s o f t w a r e / p r o d u c t s / m i d d l e w a r e / h t d o c s / f m w _ l l _ 
download.html. 
We recommend following the steps found in the guide: Oracle 
Fusion Middleware Quick Installation Guide for Oracle 
WebCenter. 
Oracle Spaces configuration 
Before initiating the creation of personal and group spaces, the administrator needs 
to configure Repository Services Content, Discussions, Wikis, and so on. 
In this case, as administrators we will set up access from WebCenter Spaces to a 
folder that contains files for each user. This folder will have the user name and 
will be in the file system of the server. 
1. 
Go to the Enterprise Manager console: http : //localhost : 7 00i/em. 
2. 
Click on the WebCenter Spaces service.

Building a business role page 
As we have mentioned in the introduction, the business role pages are a kind 
of pages that have the capability to be included in the work environment of all users 
who have a specific role. This way we can target information to a predetermined 
group of users, avoiding the need to allocate one by one. 
[ 2 3 6 ] 

Chapter 10 
In this example, we will define the role Purchaser and assign users to this role. Then 
we will create a business role page that lists the best suppliers of the company, which 
will be available to all users of the Purchaser role.

Developing a Group Space 
Another feature offered by Oracle Space is the development of a working group 
space using the tool Oracle Group Spaces. This option allows the creation of a 
working environment that can be used to foster collaboration among members of a 
project, area, or work group. 
In this exercise, we will use it to create a working environment for the team involved 
in a new procurement system.

Summary 
Oracle Space allows members of the organization develop their own environment in 
an easy way in order to improve their efficiency. 
For groups, Oracle Spaces provides an environment that allows them to manage 
their activities and meetings. 
Additionally, as discussed in this chapter, you can create Business Roles Pages that 
allow targeting information to certain groups of the organization. 
Finally, as we have seen, it's not necessary to do any kind of development because 
the solution is ready for use.
