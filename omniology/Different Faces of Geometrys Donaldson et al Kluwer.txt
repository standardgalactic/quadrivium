Preface
Modern information technology allows most mathematicians unprece-
dented access to the research literature. Published papers, reviews and
preprints can be obtained in a few seconds. This mountain of informa-
tion makes the need for articles which illuminate and survey important
developments all the greater.
Our volume brings together articles by leading experts on a variety
of different topics which are the scene of exciting current activity.
“Geometry” is famously hard to pin down, and means many different
things to different mathematicians: it is probably best interpreted as a
way of thought rather than a collection of specific subject areas-there is,
perhaps, no branch of mathematics which cannot be considered a part
of geometry, when approached in the right spirit.
Certainly we have not set out to cover all the main topics which
would normally be denoted as geometry (for example, there is relatively
little in the volume on algebraic geometry, nor on the interface between
partial differential equations and Riemannian geometry); but we hope
and believe that these articles will give a valuable picture of some major
areas.
One can distinguish various themes running through the different
contributions. There is some emphasis on invariants defined by elliptic
equations and their applications in low-dimensional topology, symplectic
and contact geometry (Bauer, Seidel, Ozsváth and Szabó). These ideas
enter, more tangentially, in the articles of Joyce, Honda and LeBrun.
Here and elsewhere, as well as explaining the rapid advances that have
v

vi
been made, the articles convey a wonderful sense of the vast areas lying
beyond our current understanding.
Simpson’s article emphasizes the need for interesting new construc-
tions (in that case of Kähler and algebraic manifolds), a point which is
also made by Bauer in the context of 4-manifolds and the “11/8 conjec-
ture.”
LeBrun’s article gives another perspective on 4-manifold theory, via
Riemannian geometry, and the challenging open questions involving the
geometry of even “well-known” 4-manifolds.
There are also striking contrasts between the articles. The authors
have taken different approaches: for example, the thoughtful essay of
Simpson, the new research results of LeBrun and the thorough exposi-
tions with homework problems of Honda.
One can also ponder the differences in the style of mathematics. In
the articles of Honda, Giannopoulos and Milman, and Mikhalkin, the
“geometry” is present in a very vivid and tangible way; combining re-
spectively with topology, analysis and algebra. The papers of Bauer and
Seidel, on the other hand, makes the point that algebraic and algebro-
topological abstraction (triangulated categories, spectra) can play an
important role in very unexpected ways in concrete geometric problems.
Finally, we wish to thank all the authors for their splendid contri-
butions and express the hope that the reader will find as much interest
and excitement in the articles as we ourselves have done.

Refined Seiberg–Witten Invariants
Stefan Bauer†
Universität Bielefeld
Bielefeld‚ Germany
In the past two decades‚ gauge theoretic methods became indispens-
able when considering manifolds in dimension four. Initially‚ research
centered around the moduli spaces of Yang–Mills instantons.
Simon
Donaldson had introduced the instanton equations into the field. Using
cohomological data of the corresponding moduli spaces‚ he defined in-
variants which could effectively distinguish differentiable structures on
homeomorphic manifolds. Some years later‚ Nathan Seiberg and Ed Wit-
ten introduced the monopole equations. In a similar spirit as in Don-
aldson theory‚ cohomological data of the corresponding moduli spaces
went into the definition of Seiberg–Witten invariants. These new in-
variants turned out to be far easier to compute‚ seemingly carrying the
same information on differentiable structures as Donaldson’s. His report

[14] gives a glimpse of the wealth of insights in 4-manifold topology that
could be extracted from these invariants.
However‚ there is more information in the monopole equations than
is seen by the Seiberg–Witten invariants. The additional information is
due to an interpretation of the monopole equations in terms of equivari-
ant stable homotopy. The fact that certain partial differential equations
admit a stable homotopy interpretation is not at all surprising. Indeed‚
this has been known for decades [37]. The good news is that in the case
of the monopole equations it actually is possible to make effective use of
this fact. The stable homotopy approach to the monopole equations does
not only give a different view on known results‚ but also new insights.
This article is a mixture of a survey and a research article. It serves
the multiple aims of introducing to this area of research‚ carefully outlin-
ing its foundations‚ presenting the known results in a unified framework
and‚ last but not least‚ proving new results.
The new results concern various improvements to the definition of
the refined invariants in [7]. Theorem 2.1‚ for example‚ specifies a class
of nonlinear Fredholm maps between certain infinite dimensional mani-
folds and shows that the path connected components of the space of all
such maps are naturally described by stable cohomotopy groups. This
makes it possible to define the refined Seiberg–Witten invariant as the
homotopy class of the monopole map in a precise way‚ clarifying a point
left open in [7]. The proof also indicates how to avoid ad hoc arguments
used in [6].
Another improvement is on the assumption 
which
had been necessary in [7] for a comparison with Seiberg–Witten invari-
ants. The situation is now summarized in Theorem 4.5. The relation to
Seiberg–Witten invariants is clarified without any restriction on 
or
This includes in particular the wall-crossing phenomenon in the
case‚ which had been missing in [7]‚ and the case
1. The Monopole Map
The main part in the story to be told is figured by the monopole map
which is defined for a closed Riemannian 4-manifold X after fixing a K-
orientation‚ or equivalently both an orientation in the usual sense and a

Refined SW-Invariants

In addition‚ also a background 
has
to be fixed. The monopole map then is a fiber preserving map between
infinite dimensional vector bundles over the torus
The refined invariant by definition is the homotopy class of the monopole
map in a sense to be made precise in the next chapter. This homotopy
class does not depend on the chosen Riemannian metric or the chosen
as these choices are parameterized by connected (in-
deed contractible) spaces and so‚ indeed‚ becomes an invariant of the
K-oriented differentiable manifold X (cf. 7.6).
Spinors are a main requisite in the definition of the monopole map.
Let us start with the spinor group. The group 
consists of
those pairs
of unitary rank two transformations which have the
same determinant. If 
and 
denote the two dimensional unitary
representations on which the respective factors act‚ then the
admits a real structure. The choice of
a basis for the real part H in this representation leads to a surjection
with kernel isomorphic to the group 
of complex
numbers of unit length. An element of H has an adjoint 
and acts on
This action extends to
an action of the Clifford algebra generated by H‚ resulting in an isomor-
phism

morphisms. The map

al selfdual part

with Hermitian line bundles results in a free and transitive action of

There is an interpretation of 
which is special to man-
ifolds up to dimension 4: Choosing a 
on X is equivalent
to choosing a stably almost complex structure‚ i.e.‚ an endomorphims
7 on the Whitney sum of the tangent bundle with a trivial rank two
bundle over X satisfying 
This is because the natural map
between the respective classifying spaces induces isomorphisms of homo-
topy groups up to dimension 5. By a theorem of Hirzebruch and Hopf
[26]‚ there always exists a stably almost complex structure on an oriented
4-manifold. If it comes from an (unstably) almost complex structure‚
then its second Chern class equals the Euler class of X. Using the
equality 
of characteristic classes‚ we derive as a necessary
condition for a stably almost complex structure to be almost complex
that its first Chern class satisfies 
If X is
connected‚ this condition is also sufficient [26]. In this case the integer
thus measures‚ how far a stably almost complex structure is away from
is the dimension of a maximal linear subspace of
the second de Rham group of X on which the cup product pairing is
positive definite.

At each point in X this symbol is
the generator of Bott periodicity‚ so it provides a K-theory orientation

index is given by

from this.
2. Enter Stable Homotopy
In case the first Betti number of X vanishes‚ the monopole map is a map
between Hilbert spaces. The boundedness property (1.3) of 
is equiva-
lent to the statement that 
extends continuously to a map 
be-
tween the one-point completions‚ where the neighborhoods of the points
at infinity are the complements of bounded sets. As spaces‚ these one-
point completions are infinite dimensional spheres. The monopole map
thus rightly may be considered as a continuous map between spheres.
In the general case‚ we use a trivialization 
of the
bundle 
to compose the monopole map with the projection 
to the
fiber 
Now the boundedness property of 
translates as follows: The
map 
extends continuously to a map 
from the Thorn
space of 
to the sphere
The idea of the refined invariant is to take the homotopy classes
of these one-point completed maps. As it stands‚ this idea is of course
nonsense: All the spaces involved are contractible‚ even equivariantly.
So there is no interesting homotopy theory.
However‚ not all is lost. Restriction to maps satisfying not only
(1.3)‚ but also property (1.2) actually does the trick. We will consider
the situation in a slightly more general setup.
Let 
and 
be infinite dimensional Hilbert space bundles over a
compact base B. The structure group is the orthogonal group with its
norm topology. Consider the set 
of fiber-preserving continuous
maps 
satisfying (1.2) and (1.3). Let us equip 
with

the topology induced by the metric

into the unit sphere bundle in 
over B. (Actually‚ there are various
topologies on 
for which the following theorem is true; the choice
made here is just to be definite.) Choosing a trivialization

roughly can be described
through a bijection
This description uses stable cohomotopy groups of B with “twisted coef-
ficients.” These groups need some explanation and as it stands‚ the
statement is rather imprecise. “For the purposes of planning strategy”
([1]) it is useful‚ to think of this decomposition as presented over the
group KO(B). For the purpose of rigorous definitions and proofs‚ much
more care has to be taken.
Let us start from the beginning‚ from pointed spaces. The prototype
of a topological space with a distinguished base point‚ usually denoted
by *‚ is the one-point compactification 
of a finite dimensional real
vector space U with the point at infinity as base point. The smash
product
of pointed spaces is the quotient of their product obtained
by identifying 
to a point. In this way 
is
canonically homeomorphic to 
The sphere 
is usually denoted
by 
The smash product with 
induces a functor from pointed
spaces to pointed spaces‚ called suspension.
According to Freudenthal’s suspension theorem‚ which holds for fi-
nite dimensional spaces‚ iterated suspensions eventually induce isomor-
phisms of sets of pointed homotopy classes
The notion of a spectrum arose from the desire to define a category in
which the elements of the resulting Abelian group
appear as homotopy classes of maps between the objects. There are
various ways to construct such categories. The situation suggests to use
the Spanier–Whitehead category indexed by a universe: Objects and

Refined SW-Invariants
9
morphisms in this category are defined through colimit constructions.
The index category consists of the finite dimensional linear subspaces
of an infinite dimensional real Hilbert space 
called universe‚ with
inclusions as morphisms. So an object A in the Spanier–Whitehead
category associates to 
a pointed space 
To relate these
spaces‚ we use the inclusion 
to identify W with 
where V
is the orthogonal complement to U in W. The collection of spaces
comes with identifications
satisfying the obvious compatibility condition
for 
The morphism set in the Spanier–Whitehead
category is the colimit
over the maps
The latter identification is induced by the identifications
and
Every (homotopy) category of spectra is supposed to contain some
variant of the Spanier-Whitehead category as a full subcategory. So it
should do no harm to call the objects spectra. It should, however, be
pointed out that some authors reserve the name spectrum to objects in
more elaborate categories.
Any pointed space A canonically defines its suspension spectrum,
denoted by A as well, by setting
To define objects in the Spanier-Whitehead category, it of course
suffices to define them for a cofinal indexing category, as for example

The theorem describes the path-connected components of these map-
ping spaces in terms of a disjoint union of algebraic objects. So one
can hardly expect the algebraic structure to be reflected in the world
of Fredholm maps by natural constructions. In particular‚ addition of
elements in the respective cohomotopy groups seems to be difficult to
describe in terms of Fredholm maps without making use of the theorem.
However‚ two aspects are inherent in the Fredholm setup.

3. Some Equivariant Topology
Using equivariant spaces and maps throughout‚ the above concepts carry
over to an equivariant setting in a straightforward manner. An appro-
priate reference is [1].
The action of a compact Lie group G on a pointed G-space A fixes
the distinguished base point. If A and C are pointed G-spaces‚ then
the smash product 
obtains a G-action by restricting the natural
G × G-action to the diagonal subgroup. A G-universe 
is a Hilbert
space on which G acts via isometrics in such a way that an irreducible
G-representation‚ if contained in 
is so with infinite multiplicity. A
complete G-universe contains all irreducible representations.
An object of the G-Spanier–Whitehead category indexed by 
as-
sociates to a finite dimensional representation 
a pointed G-space
The morphism set is the colimit
of G-homotopy classes of equivariant maps. This morphism set is a group
if the G-universe 
contains trivial G-representations.
An equivariant projection 
need not exist. This
may happen for example‚ if the G-action on the (unpointed) base space
B of the G-Hilbert bundle 
is nontrivial or if the fiber over a fixed
point in B does not qualify as a universe. If such a projection
exists‚
it induces a natural bijection
as before.
The stable cohomotopy groups in 2.1 and in particular their equivari-
ant counterparts are barely known. To get a rough impression‚ consider
the case of a point B = {P}. If we choose a universe with a trivial
G-action‚ then the twist ind is characterized by an integer 
and the
group 
can be identified with the 
stable stem
On the other extreme‚ if we choose 
to be a complete universe‚ then
the isomorphism class of ind gives an element in the representation ring
RO(G). In the case where is an isomorphism‚ 
is isomorphic
to the Burnside ring A(G) [10‚ II.8.4]. If G is a finite group‚ A(G) is the
Grothendieck ring of finite G-sets with addition given by disjoint union
and multiplication given by product. A point with the trivial G-action
on it represents 1.

Understanding the group 
for a virtual representation
ind 
of G in any universe 
whatsoever boils down to under-
standing the homotopy classes of G-maps 
Equivariant
K-theory provides some information in case both V and W are complex
representations. The method is explained in [10, II.5]:
Let

bundles over the G-space B. For a pointed space B as usual

If V is a complex G-representation, then

[2]. The image of the
Bott class 
under the restriction homomorphism
is 
This defines the Euler class, which was deter-
mined by Segal [38] to be the element

3.5. For spaces with free G-action‚ the equivariant cohomotopy is

This proper-
ty is obvious for spaces. The fact that it carries over to the equivariantly
stable world follows from a careful analysis of the equivariant suspension
theorem: In this situation‚ it suffices to suspend with trivial representa-
tions only to get into the stable range.
4. Topology of the Monopole Map
The first statement in the following theorem summarizes the previous
discussion.

defines an ele-
ment in the equivariant stable cohomotopy group

morphism of this stable cohomotopy group to

PROOF. The universe in this statement is explicitly given as the fiber
of the bundle 
The index of the linearization of the monopole map
consists of two summands. The Dirac operator associated to a defines a
virtual complex index bundle ind(D) over the Picard torus. The second
bundle is the trivial bundle with fiber the

dual harmonic forms

To see what happens in the cases 
not covered by this the-
orem we have to take a closer look at the monopole map and distinguish
different cases.

which is of degree 1 on the                 point set.
The existence of such an element contradicts 3.1.

theorem:
Theorem 4.3 ([11]‚ [12]).   Let X be a closed oriented four-manifold
with negative definite intersection form. Then the intersection pairing
on 
is diagonal.
4.2. The case 
In the case 
the Seiberg–
Witten invariants depend in a well understood manner ([44], [30]) on
the Riemannian metric and on an additional perturbation parameter.
To understand the phenomenon, let us illustrate it in a characteristic
example. This example describes the situation in the case of an almost
complex manifold with 
[7]:
View the spinning globe as a two-sphere with an 
and choose
the north pole as a base point. As a target space, take a one-sphere
with trivial action and choose two points on this one-sphere as “poles,”
the north pole again as base point. Based equivariant maps from the
spinning globe to the one-sphere are determined by their restriction to
a latitude, which as an arc is a contractible space. So there is only the
trivial homotopy class of equivariant such maps.
In contrast, consider equivariant maps, which take north and south
pole to north and south pole respectively. The monopole maps for all
choices of metrics and background connections actually are of this type.
Such a map basically wraps a latitude 
times around the one-
sphere. Choosing a generic point in the one-sphere, the oriented count

Refined SW-Invariants
19
of preimages in a fixed latitude defines in a natural way a map of the
set of relative homotopy classes to the integers. This oriented count‚
however‚ depends on the choice of the generic point. It changes by ±1‚
if the generic point is chosen in the “other half” of the one-sphere.
There are two ways to deal with the problem. If one prefers to have
homotopy classes‚ one may consider the monopole map up to equivariant
homotopy relative to the fixed point. The monopole map then is a well
defined element in the set of all such homotopy classes. However‚ this set
will not be a group anymore. There is a comparison map to the integers
depending upon the choice of a “chamber.” An alternative is described
below.
4.3. The case
The restriction of the monopole map
to the 
point set 
is a product
map. On the factor 
it is the identity, on the second factor it is
a linear embedding with cokernel 
To take this into account,
we would like to construct an equivariant spectrum Q encoding this
information. Ideally, this spectrum would be obtained by a push-out of
two maps. The one map describes the inclusion 
of the fixed
point set, the other the projection 
Such a
push-out seems not available in the category we are working in. Let us
try to define a substitute. Suppose E – U for

5. Kähler‚ Symplectic‚ and
Almost Complex Manifolds
The current knowledge about differentiable structures on four-dimen-
sional manifolds builds on the fact that the gauge theoretic invariants are
closely related to the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Witten explained how
in the case of Kähler surfaces Seiberg–Witten invariants can be deter-
mined by complex analytic methods. Taubes modified the arguments for
the case of symplectic manifolds. Various mathematicians consequently
studied Seiberg–Witten invariants for Kähler and symplectic manifolds.
Cutting-and-pasting methods were developed to transfer these compu-
tations to other almost complex manifolds. These efforts resulted in a
diverse and fascinating picture.
The refined invariants have little to add to this direction in four-
manifold theory. This section intends to explain why. For the sake of
brevity‚ let us focus on central aspects and let us assume

is nonvanishing‚ then this 
corresponds to an
almost complex structure.
Witten and Taubes actually prove more than is stated in these the-
orems: The monopole map is not surjective‚ unless there is a pseudohol-
omorphic curve in X which is Poincaré dual to the class L. The result
follows by the application of adjunction inequalities [34]. By Remark
2.2‚ we get as an immediate consequence:
Corollary 5.3. Let X be an oriented four-manifold with
which admits a symplectic structure. If the stable cohomotopy invariant
in 4.4 is nonvanishing for some 
on X‚
then 
describes an almost complex structure on X.
The refined invariants‚ when applied to symplectic manifolds‚ carry
exactly the same information as the Seiberg–Witten invariants. This is
a consequence of 5.3 and the following statement.
Proposition 5.4. Let X be an almost complex four-manifold with
Then the homomorphism 
in 4.4 comparing the
Seiberg–Witten invariant with its refinement is an isomorphism.
PROOF. For an almost complex 4-manifold‚ the “virtual dimension
of the moduli space” 
is zero (1). The construction of the comparison
homomorphism in 4.1 and 4.4 considers a map from a pair
of spaces to a sphere. The integer 
is exactly the difference of the
dimensions of
and the sphere. The dimensions being equal and
being a connected and oriented manifold relative to its
boundary‚ one can apply a classical theorem of Hopf. It states that the
homotopy classes of such maps are classified by their degree.
So in order to test‚ whether the refined invariants are of any use‚ we
have to leave the by now familiar world of symplectic or at least almost
complex 4-manifolds and enter the jungle.
6. Some Stable Cohomotopy Groups
The groups 
seem to be at least as hard to compute
as the stable homotopy groups of spheres. Let us restrict to the simplest
cases. In particular, let us only consider 4-manifolds X with vanishing
first Betti number and 
The groups then are then determined

in an informal way, how to represent elements in these groups for small

7. Intermezzo
This chapter aims at sensitizing for some snags one should be aware
of when working in this field. One concerns a misinterpretation of the
Pontrijagin–Thom construction‚ another the proper use of homotopy
categories.
The main difference between the familiar approach to gauge theo-
ry and the homotopy approach is the replacement of spaces by maps.
The Pontrijagin–Thom construction provides a perfect and well-known
duality between the concepts “stable homotopy classes of maps between
spheres” and “bordism classes of framed manifolds.” At first glance‚
this duality suggests stable maps to contain equivalent information as
localized data in the form of moduli spaces together with suitably speci-
fied normal bundle data. This idea is particularly appealing to anybody
working in gauge theory‚ since the use of localized data — often in form
of characteristic classes — is a main trick of the trade. I propose to
dispose of this idea as quickly as possible‚ since it is prone to deception
and self-deception. Here is a much too long discussion; for related topics
cf. [1‚ Chapter 6].
7.1. Equivarianttransversality. One minor reason is due to the fact
that the Pontrijagin–Thom correspondence fails in general in an equi-
variant setting due to the fact that transversality arguments do not work
in sufficient generality.
7.2. A variant on the Eilenbereg-swindle. More seriously‚ the infor-
mation cannot possibly localize as suggested above. The reason is as
puzzling as it is simple: Any two framings on a bundle by their very
definition are isomorphic. Framings can be distinguished only embedded
in a surrounding space.
But how to keep control over framings when changing the surround-
ing space? The default surrounding space we are dealing with is a Hilbert
space. In order to get into business‚ we have to reduce to finite dimen-
sions. And‚ to get this straight‚ the only natural way is by linear projec-
tion. Indeed‚ such projections are used in the proof of 2.1. Now comes
the point: Embedded framed manifolds are extremely ill behaved under
projections.
Let us look at this in more detail. Embed 
as the 
of a
nonzero element in 
and fix a framing of an affine normal disk to

26
Stefan Bauer
a given point in 
Using the 
on 
this framing extends
to a framing of the normal bundle of 
By equivariant (here it is
okay) Pontrijagin–Thom, this framing corresponds to a generator in the
corresponding equivariant stable homotopy group, which happens to be
isomorphic to 
as we have seen in the preceding chapter. Now consider
a generic projection 
This is a 
map and the
normal framing in 
complex dimensions is equivariantly
projected to one constructed the same way in complex 
dimensions,
which also represents a generator in the corresponding group. The disas-
trous effect on the framing becomes apparent only after forgetting the
action. As explained in the preceding chapter, nonequivariantly the con-
structed framing of the embedding in 
is
So it is trivial for odd 
and nontrivial for even. In particular, when
projecting along an infinite dimensional Hilbert space in an uncontrolled
manner, we systematically do Eilenberg-swindles. There are several ways
to deal with this. I’ll explain some commonly used ones.
7.3. Equivariance to the rescue.  The way to gain control is by the
use of the stable map representing the framing. Let us do that. This
is an equivariant map 
From the equivariant picture it is
clear that this map has nothing to do with equivariant maps
Projection should correspond to desuspension. But considering
source and target, we immediately realize that if our example were a
desuspension, then it were along different
on either
side of the map. The lesson should be that only by holding to the map
as a double-entry book-keeping device, we can tell legal and harmless
projections (desuspensions) from the illegal and harmful. But actually,
in our case this is not enough.
7.4. Universes to the rescue. Let us take a closer look at the example
just discussed and let us forget that there was a 
As pointed
out, linear projections should correspond to desuspensions. But if we
forget the 
the linear projections in the example on both sides
are real linear along an 
As we have seen, they cannot correspond
to desuspensions. Intuitively, the problem is easy to understand: In
the source, we are trying to desuspend a “moving frame,” whereas in
the target, we want to desuspend a “fixed frame.” Now that we have
excluded representation theory to act as a savior, we need a replacement
to convey that idea. The notion of a universe, which seems to go back to

Refined SW-Invariants
27
Peter May, is such a replacement. The point here is that the projection
above along 
does not factor through a projection along 
as it
should. If one uses universes, this feature is built in.
7.5. On the usage of spectra I. I want to present a way how not
to define the refined invariants: This uses the spectrum of a selfadjoint
elliptic operator, acting on a Hilbert space 
After choosing an ordered
basis for eigenspaces, we get a canonical embedding 
which we
may use to make suspensions ordered by the integers instead of finite
dimensional linear subspaces of
This is okay if one does not change
the operator.
The snag appears if one wants to change the operator. Let us do
that, say by changing a metric used to define it. At first sight this looks
controllable: A small change of the operator will result in a small change
of the eigenvalues, so locally, up to “canonical” homotopy, this should
define a “canonical” homotopy equivalence between the sphere spectra
indexed by the integers.
Will this stand up to scrutiny? Assume we have a closed path of
operators such that the eigenspaces for eigenvalues in a fixed interval
constitute a bundle over 
It may happen that the bundle for
a chosen set of eigenvalues is not orientable. Following the “canonical”
homotopy equivalences of the sphere along the circle, we obtain that the
identity map over the base point is canonically” homotopic to minus
the identity map. This is not what we want.
But, the space of metrics is contractible. So we may always extend
the operator to an operator parameterized by a disk. In the critical
cases this will involve other eigenspaces than the ones we started with.
So only very special arrangements of eigenspaces will be “admissible” for
the argument. And which arrangements are “admissible” may depend
heavily on the chosen extension of the operator on the disk. There may
exist no “admissible” arrangement that works in all situations.
Orientation is governed by a determinant line bundle, which exists
in the Fredholm setting. So, indeed, there may be a way to coherently
enforce all such bundles over B to be orientable. I do not know any,
but let us suppose we found one. Then, as bundles over B, they are
trivial. However, there are two trivializations up to homotopy to choose
from. If we pick the wrong one, we will have the following phenomenon:
Using the trivialization, we may parallel transport an embedded 
with

28
Stefan Bauer
framed normal bundle in the fiber over a point in B once around the loop
B. This parallel transport changes the framing.
But, the space of metrics is contractible. Indeed, if the operator is
such that the bundle over B extends to a bundle of eigenspaces over
the disc, then this would pick a trivialization. However, there may be a
different extension of the operator to the disk such that we get a trivial-
ization only if we add a 2-dimensional eigenspace. The two trivializations
obtained that way need not be the same, as the example (7.2) shows.
Which to choose?
7.6. Why do universes work? The discussion above shows well-de-
finedness of the refined invariants to be a nontrivial issue. The following
argument is not based on the contractibility of some parameter space,
but on the contractibility of the orthogonal group of Hilbert space. If we
take a path in our parameter space (metrics, 
then we
will get a bundle of universes over that path. The theorem of Kuiper [29]
shows that this is a trivial bundle and has a unique trivialization up to
homotopy. A trivialization identifies the universes defined for different
parameters. Such an identification of universes provides for a change-
of-universe isomorphism of the stable cohomotopy groups defined with
respect to the respective universes. A trivialization homotopic modulo
end points to the one chosen will induce the same isomorphism of stable
cohomotopy groups. This uses 2.1 for the parameter space B × [0,1] ×
[0,1]. In particular, by taking closed paths, we get that the invariants
are well defined.
7.7. On the usage of spectra II. Finally, I want to point out a re-
liable avenue to create nonsense. Is it possible to construct (homotopy
types of) spectra out of spaces, which themselves are only defined up
to homotopy? That means, all spaces are defined up to homotopy, the
suspensions are defined up to homotopy, the compatibility condition (5)
holds only up to homotopy. The answer in general is: No. This would
amount to a lift from the homotopy category of topological spaces to the
category of topological spaces. This problem has been addressed in work
of Dwyer and Kan, cf., for example, [15], [16]. To see the problems, just
assume for each 
the space 
to be a sphere homotopy equiva-
lent to 
When trying to prove well-definedness of the identity map,
not only similar problems as above turn up, but also higher dimensional
phenomena. There is no magic to cure this problem.

Since I am using [10] as a reference, I should point out that his
definition of spectra looks similar to the one I am criticizing. It actually
is different: The author wisely only uses complex representations as
suspension coordinates. Because of the implicit
(7.3)
this gets rid of all the complications I lamented about. Moreover, the
author is only interested in spectra as realizing equivariant homology and
cohomology functors on spaces. He does not define a category of spectra
and in particular he does not define maps of spectra, thus avoiding any
discussion about the indicated higher dimensional phenomena.
Not all authors have taken this problem seriously. Sadly enough,
it renders a considerable part of the homotopy theory literature in this
subject useless.
8. Gluing Results
8.1. Gluing along positive curvature. Connected sums of oriented
4-manifolds have vanishing Seiberg–Witten invariants, unless one of the
summands has negative definite intersection form. The same statement
holds for Donaldson invariants. This fits very well with known stabil-
ity results on simply connected 4-manifolds: A theorem of Wall [43]
states that if any two differentiable 4-manifolds are homotopy equiva-
lent, then after taking connected sum with sufficiently many copies of
the resulting manifolds will be diffeomorphic. In many cases
it is known that already one copy is “sufficiently many.” For example,
complete intersections or elliptic surfaces are almost completely decom-
posable [31]. That means, the result of taking connected sum with a
single complex projective plane is diffeomorphic to a connected sum of
projective planes, taken with both standard and reversed orientation.
S. Donaldson defined in [13] mod 2-polynomial invariants, which poten-
tially could distinguish different structures on connected sums. However,
no examples were found.
The stable cohomotopy invariants do not vanish in general for con-
nected sums. This shows that they are true refinements of Seiberg–
Witten invariants. The connected sum theorem [6] states that for a
connected sum 
of 4-manifolds, the stable equivariant cohomo-
topy invariant is the smash product of the invariants of its summands.
It is straightforward to compute explicit examples.

A precise statement of the theorem constitutes already a major part
of its proof. We will discuss a slightly more general setup. Let x be the
disjoint union of a finite number, say
of closed connected Riemannian
4-manifolds 
each equipped with a K-theory orientation. Suppose
each component contains a separating neck
So it is a union
of closed submanifolds with common boundary

length 2L > 2 of the neck is considered a variable. For an even per-
mutation 
of the indices, let 
be the manifold obtained from X by
interchanging the positive parts of its components, i.e.,
Next comes the question of whether and how K-orientations glue. In
order to be able to glue, we of course need the following
ASSUMPTION.  The K-orientations on all components 
when pulled
back along the inclusion
lead to the same K-orientation.
This assumption is automatically satisfied in case Y is an integral
homology sphere. In general, in order to get a well-defined K-orientation
on the manifold 
it does not suffice to fix an isomorphism class, but
we also have to fix identifications. Note that the gauge group map
acts freely on the set of all such identifications. If the gauge
group is connected, any such identification will give the same K-orien-
tation on 
We can enforce connectedness by the following
ASSUMPTION. Let Y have vanishing first Betti number.
It turns out that we will have to put much stronger assumptions on
the geometry of Y in order to prove the gluing theorem. So we need
not discuss this tricky issue at this point. Under these assumptions, a

in 4.1 and the case 
The proof extends without further changes
to the version in 4.4 and to positively curved manifolds Y, i.e., quotients
of the sphere.
Theorem 8.1. Let Y be a manifold with positive Ricci and in par-
ticular scalar curvature. Then the change of universe isomorphism
identifies the monopole classes of X and 
for corresponding K-theory
orientations.
The theorem claims the diagram
to commute up to homotopy, i.e., there is a path in 
connect-
ing the maps 
and 
The difference between the two maps is a
compact operator. So the homotopy need only change the compact sum-
mand in the monopole map such that at any time during the homotopy
the boundedness condition (1.3) remains satisfied. Control is achieved
by the use of Weitzenböck formulas for both the Dirac operator and the

32
Stefan Bauer
covariant derivative. Positivity of scalar and Ricci curvature, respective-
ly, along the neck provide the necessary estimates on the spinor and form
components during the homotopy. The estimates on spinor and forms
finally are tuned by neckstretching. So the theorem holds for sufficiently
large L and hence for any L > 1. The proof in [6] actually constructs
a path in a slightly bigger space than 
This can be avoided by
the use of the homotopy (6).
To apply this theorem, let us spell out the following elementary
observation.
Proposition 8.2 ([6]). Let X be the disjoint union of a finite num-
ber of K-oriented 4-manifolds     Then the Thom spectrum T(ind l) of
the index bundle over 
is the smash product of the corresponding
spectra 
associated to the components and the stable cohomotopy
class of the monopole map of X is the smash product
of the stable cohomotopy classes associated to the respective components.
The action of the torus 
on the sum 
is factorwise.
Note that the 
in 8.1 on these spectra is the diagonal one.
The proof of the connected sum formula follows from applying this
theorem to the case 
when X is the disjoint union of a connected
sum 
and two copies of the 4-sphere. The manifold 
then will
be the disjoint union of 
and one further copy of the 4-sphere.
Using (4.5) and (3.1) it is immediate to recognize 
as homotopic to
the identity map on the sphere spectrum. In particular, we may identify
the monopole class 
with the monopole class
via some obvious change-of-universe identifications. So as a corollary to
8.1 we obtain the connected sum theorem.
Theorem 8.3 ([6]). The gluing map
identifies the class
of the monopole map of the connected sum of two K-oriented 4-manifolds
with the smash product 
of the monopole classes
of the summands.
The gluing theorem applies to a further construction, which is dis-
cussed in [25, p. 411]: Suppose, the K-oriented 4-manifolds 
and

Refined SW-Invariants
33
both contain a –2-curve, i.e., a smoothly embedded 2-sphere with
self-intersection number –2. Cutting out tubular neighborhoods of these
–2-curves, we obtain manifolds with real projective 3-space as boundary.
Using an orientation reversing diffeomorphism of the boundaries, we
may glue the manifolds along their boundaries. Let 
denote the
resulting manifold.
The orientation reversing diffeomorphism permutes the two spin-
structures on the real projective 3-space 
One of these two spin-
structures extends as a spin-structure to the tubular neighborhood of
a –2-curve. This property distinguishes the two spin-structures. The
other spin structure extends to a 
on the tubular neigh-
borhood, the determinant line bundle of which has degree congruent 2
mod 4, when restricted to the –2-curve.
Gluing two copies of tubular neighborhoods of –2-curves by the use
of an orientation reversing diffeomorphism of the boundaries, results in a
manifold N. This manifold can also be recognized as the manifold
obtained by reversing the orientation on the connected
sum of two copies of the complex projective plane. There are four
on N for which the monopole map is homotopic to the identity
map on the sphere spectrum. This again is immediate from (4.5) and
(3.1). Exactly the same argument as in 8.3, with 
replaced by N, thus
proves:

Obviously, the range of applications of 8.1 is rather limited. It would
be desirable to extend the stable cohomotopy approach in a well-defined
manner (cf. 7.7) to manifolds with boundary explaining the behavior
under cutting and pasting.
8.2. Applications to 4-manifolds. The computations of the stable
cohomotopy groups in (6.1) can now be combined with known results on
Seiberg–Witten invariants (5.4). Most of the following statements are
immediate.

has some nontrivial implications. Note that the assumptions are met by
symplectic manifolds.

theorems might suggest. To get an impression, let us consider connected
sums of certain elliptic surfaces which had been classified [5] up to diffeo-
morphism with methods from Donaldson theory. Note that in each of the
two homeomorphism classes of such elliptic surfaces there are infinitely
many diffeomorphism classes.

phic to a connected sum

applications of the connected sum theorem. In particular they proved
nonexistence statements for Einstein metrics on connected sums of alge-
braic surfaces.
9. Additional Symmetries
9.1. Spin structures. The case of spin structures was pioneered by
Furuta [20]. The key observation is that for a spin 4-manifold X the
monopole map is actually Pin(2)-equivariant, where Pin(2)
is the normalizer of the maximal torus 
in

In this setup, our standard universe
will not contain trivial Pin(2)-representations. As a consequence, equi-
variant cohomotopy 
in general does not carry a
group structure; it is just a set which even may be empty. Indeed, the
main result in [20] in effect proves emptiness of this set in certain cases.
In order to get groups, we may simply enlarge the universe
by adding an infinite dimensional Hilbert space H with trivial Pin(2)-
action. The change-of-universe map
can be viewed as induced by smash product with the identity element

loss of information by this change-of-universe, but a gain of convenient
algebraic structure.

Then the refined Seiberg–Witten invariant of X is
nonzero. In particular, if X has second Betti number

and sign(X) = –80), then X has
nonvanishing refined invariants.
The special cases of vanishing first Betti numbers and sign(X) =
–16, sign(X) = –32, and sign(X) = –48 were obtained in [33], [22],
and [23] respectively.
9.2. Symplectic structures with
Let X be a K-oriented
4-manifold, which is both symplectic and spin. This means the canoni-
cal 
coming with the symplectic structure has vanishing
integral first Chern class. For such a manifold one can combine the
considerations above with Taubes’ result (5.1).
According to the Kodaira classification of complex surfaces [4] there
are only three families of complex surfaces with 
The obvious
families are the simply connected K3-surfaces and the tori. Furthermore,

40

there are primary Kodaira surfaces with first Betti number 3. The first
two families are Kähler, hence symplectic by default. Other symplectic,
non-Kähler and even noncomplex manifolds with 
and Betti num-
bers 2 and 3, were constructed [42], [18], [24].
Theorem 9.5 ([33]).
Let X be a symplectic 4-manifold with van-
ishing first Betti number and with trivial canonical line bundle. Then
sign(X) = –16.
PROOF. The vanishing of

The monopole map is Pin(2)-equivariant,

as in 6.1, we obtain a stable
map in 
The action is free on both
spaces and the spaces are of the same dimension. This allows to apply
a 
version of the Hopf theorem [10, p. 126].
According to this theorem, the (nonequivariant) degree of such a
map is determined modulo 2. As we will see, this degree, which is
the Seiberg–Witten invariant, can be an odd number only in the case
sign(X) = –16. Taubes’ theorem 5.1 then completes the argument. To
show that the degree is even for 
it suffices because of Hopf’s the-
orem to exhibit an element in 
which has even
degree. Here it is: The 
power 
of the Pin(2)-equivariant Hopf
map induces a 
map 
Composed with
the inclusion 
we get a map of degree zero for
Here is an immediate corollary:
Corollary 9.6. A symplectic 4-manifold with finite fundamental
group and with trivial canonical line bundle is homeomorphic to a K3-
surface.
It is well known that there are infinitely many different smooth struc-
tures on the topological 4-manifold underlying a K3-surface. The infin-
itely many smooth structures which come from complex Kähler struc-
tures were classified in [5]. There are infinitely many more smooth struc-
tures which come from symplectic ones, cf. [25, p. 396f]. And there are
again infinitely many more smooth structures which do not allow for
a symplectic structure at all, cf. [19]. Nevertheless, amongst all these
smooth structures only the K3-surface seems to be known to carry a
symplectic structure with 
The analogy to the Kodaira-dimension
zero case in the Kodaira-classification therefore is tantalizing:

Question 9.7. Are symplectic 4-manifolds with 
necessarily
either parallelizable or K3-surfaces?
9.3. Group actions. The stable cohomotopy approach does not re-
ly on transversality results and therefore seems suitable for considering
group actions on 4-manifolds. In the discussion below, which closely fol-
lows [39], the first Betti number of the manifolds will always be zero. A
compact Lie group acting on a 4-manifold X is supposed to preserve its
K-orientation.
Theorem 9.8 ([39]). Let G act on the K-oriented 4-manifold X.
There is a central extension 
of the group G by the torus 
such that
the monopole map 
is 
The associated element
restricts to the 
stable cohomotopy invar-
iant.
When considering free actions of finite groups, one gets into a situ-
ation which very much resembles Galois theory. The quotients X/H by
the various subgroups H < G are 4-manifolds carrying a residual action
of the Weyl group
Theorem 9.9 ([39]). Let X be a K-oriented 4-manifold with a free
action of a finite group G and H < G a subgroup. The set 
of
on the quotient X/H which pull back to the given
on X can be canonically identified with the set of subgroups
of 
which map isomorphically to H under the projection to G. For
the invariant 
can be identified with the
restriction of                    to the fixed points of
In particular, stable cohomotopy invariants of oriented 4-manifolds
with finite fundamental group are determined by equivariant stable coho-
motopy invariants of simply connected 4-manifolds.
One can combine all the restrictions to fixed points into a comparison
map
Under certain conditions a general splitting result in equivariant ho-
motopy theory implies that this comparison map is an isomorphism after
localization away from the order of the group. This splitting theorem
can be applied for example if both

of G and the index of the Dirac operator can be represented by an actu-
al representation. So in this case kernel and cokernel are torsion groups
with nonzero
parts only for those primes which do divide the
order of G,
Finally, let us restrict to the case of a group of prime order
Again
the case where the K-orientation on X comes from an almost complex
structure is easy to handle.
Theorem 9.10 ([39]). If the group G of prime order 
acts freely
on the almost complex manifold X, then the invariant 
is com-
pletely determined by the nonequivariant invariants for X and for X/G.
Among the latter, the relation
is satisfied.
The comparison map, however, is not injective in general. This
is proved in [39] using Adams spectral sequence calculations. To find
geometrical applications for these homotopy theoretical computations
looks like a challenging problem.
10. Final Remarks
There is no chance to determine stable cohomotopy invariants by di-
rect computation. This seems obvious. So the only way to get further
information out of the monopole map is through a better conceptual
understanding.
Any improvement in our knowledge about the groups which arise as
equivariant stable cohomotopy groups in this field could help as a guide-
line to computing invariants as well as to constructing 4-manifolds. We
know disturbingly few examples of nonvanishing refined invariants. All
examples known at the moment are powers of the Hopf map 
Actually
this reflects the fact that 
by Pontrjiagin–Thom describes the Lie group
framing of the group
 acting.
A hypothetical way to realizing other stable cohomotopy elements
was pointed out in 9.4: Construct a minimal counterexample to the
Now we know, where to start the search (9.3). It does not
look like that hopeless an enterprise anymore.

It were symmetry considerations which lead to 9.4. Indeed, symme-
try considerations may be a key to further progress. Let us dwell upon
it a little more. One can consider the monopole map as a map between
infinite dimensional bundles over some configuration space Conf(X) con-
sisting of all the choices made: metrics,
harmonic 1-
forms. There is a symmetry group 
acting: It is an extension of the
subgroup of the diffeomorphism group preserving the K-orientation by
some gauge group. Ideally, the monopole map can be understood as an
Euler class of the virtual index bundle in a “proper stable
cohomotopy group”
with twisting in an element of “proper                    KO-theory.” The
space Conf(X) is the classifying space for proper 
The obvious
map 
from the classifying space of free actions induces a
“Segal map”
In analogy to the compact Lie group case one would expect the latter
group to be isomorphic (or at least related) to nonequivariant stable
cohomotopy 
Now the classifying space 
of the group
indeed classifies parameterized families of K-oriented 4-manifolds. The
image of the monopole class in this last group therefore is the universal
parameterized stable cohomotopy invariant. Of course, everything here
is ill defined and probably cannot be made precise at all. However, it can
be made precise for compact approximations, i.e., for compact subgroups
of 
or for finite equivariant subcomplexes of Conf(X). This might lead
to information on the diffeomorphism groups of 4-manifolds. Already
the case of the four-dimensional sphere looks interesting.
Interesting first results in this direction, relating diffeomorphisms
of 4-manifolds to parameterized stable cohomotopy invariants over the
1-sphere, can be found in a recent preprint [32].
The space Conf(X) might also be of interest for considering the
behavior of the stable cohomotopy invariants at its “boundary,” i.e.,
study the behaviour of the maps under degeneration of the manifolds.
Another challenging direction of research is to find homotopy inter-
pretations of Donaldson invariants and of Gromov–Witten invariants and
to relate these concepts. At the moment these seem to be totally out of
reach.

Stefan Bauer
Most urgently needed, however, are more general concepts of gluing.
Ideally, there should be relative invariants for manifolds with boundaries
defining a “stable homotopy” quantum field theory.
Indeed, there are papers in the literature claiming such a construc-
tion. The proposal is to use Conley indices of finite dimensional approxi-
mations to define homotopy types of “Seiberg-Witten-Floer”-spectra and
related relative invariants. I do see serious problems in this approach,
concerning well-definedness.
Here is a brief discussion of the main point. The choices, which
go into the construction of the Conley index of a given flow, can be
put together to define a colimit in the homotopy category of spaces.
More precisely, they form a “connected simple system”, a concept which
also carries over to parameterized situations as long as the parameter
space is simply connected. Amongst many other choices, the proposed
construction uses the choice of a homotopy equivalence of the suspension
of the Conley index for a given approximation with the Conley index of a
higher dimensional approximation. The space of such choices, however,
is not simply connected in general. Indeed, let us consider the special
case where all the relevant Conley indices are represented by spheres.
The space of stable homotopy equivalences of spheres has fundamental
group

is still in an incipient
state, contact structures in dimension 3 are much better understood,
largely due to the fact that symplectic geometry in two dimensions is
just the study of area. The goal of this article is to explain some of the
recent developments in 3-dimensional contact geometry, with an empha-
sis on methods from 3-dimensional topology. Basic references include
[1, 7, 13, 18]. The article [31] is similar in spirit to ours.
Three-dimensional contact geometry lies at the interface between 3-
and 4-manifold geometries, and has been an essential part of the flurry
in low-dimensional geometry and topology over the last 20 years. In
dimension 3, it relates to foliation theory and knot theory; in dimension

Consider the front projection
where 
Generic Legendrian knots L (the
genericity can be achieved by applying a small contact isotopy) can be
projected to closed curves in

can be
lifted to a Legendrian knot in 
by setting to be the slope of the curve

For an oriented Legendrian knot in 
or 
the topological knot
type, the Thurston–Bennequin invariant, and the rotation number are
called the classical invariants. Although Legendrian unknots are com-
pletely determined by their classical invariants according to Theorem 1.2,
Legendrian knots in general are not completely classified by the classical
invariants. One way of distinguishing two Legendrian knots with the
same classical invariants is through contact homology. (See [3, 11] for
more details.)
1.3. Tight vs. overtwisted. In the 1970’s, Lutz [36] and Martinet
[37] proved the following:
Theorem 1.3 (Lutz, Martinet). Let M be a closed oriented 3-man-
ifold, Dist(M) be the set of smooth 2-plane field distributions on M, and
Cont(M) be the set of smooth contact 2-plane field distributions on M.
Then 
is surjective.
STRATEGY OF PROOF. 1. Start with a 2-plane field    Take a fine
enough triangulation of M so that on each 3-simplex 
is close to a
linear foliation by planes.
2. It is easy to homotop near the 2-skeleton so it becomes contact.
Now we have an extension problem to the interior of each 3-simplex.

A typical OT disk looks like

what Bennequin proved was
that 
contains no OT disks. It turns out that the existence of
an OT disk is equivalent to the existence of a Legendrian unknot L with
HW 11 (Hard). Try to prove that 
has no overtwisted disks.
It is not an exaggeration to say that modern contact geometry has
its beginnings in Bennequin’s theorem. There is a dichotomy in the
world of contact structures, those that contain OT disks (called over-
twisted contact structures) and those that do not (called tight contact
structures). In view of Theorem 1.1, every contact structure is locally
tight, and therefore the question of overtwistedness is a global one.

The following is an important inequality for knots in tight contact
manifolds.

gendrian knot in a tight               If      is a Seifert surface for L with Euler
characteristic

1.4. Classification of contact structures. When discussing the clas-
sification of contact structures, it is important to keep in mind the fol-
lowing theorem:
Theorem 1.6 (Gray). Let 
be a 1-parameter family of
contact structures on a closed manifold M. Then there is a 1-parameter
family of diffeomorphisms         such that                 and
In other words, a homotopy of contact structures gives rise to a
contact isotopy.
The overtwisted classification (on closed 3-manifolds) was shown by
Eliashberg [8] to be essentially the same as the homotopy classification
of 2-plane fields. (The result is quite striking, especially when contrasted
with the tight classification on 
below.)
Theorem 1.7 (Eliashberg). Let M be a closed oriented 3-manifold,
and
be the overtwisted 2-plane field distribu-
tions. Then
On the other hand, tight contact structures tend to reflect the under-
lying topology of the manifold, and are more difficult to understand. The
goal of this article is to introduce techniques which enable us to better
understand tight contact structures. In the meantime, we list a couple
of examples:
1. 
Eliashberg [7] proved that there is a unique tight contact
structure up to isotopy. It is the one given in Example 3.

is symplec-
tically fillable if there exists a compact symplectic 4-manifold 
such

(Technically speaking, what we are calling “symplectically fill-
able” is usually called “weakly symplectically fillable,” but since we have
no need of such taxonomy in this article, we will stick to “symplectically
fillable” or even just “fillable.” For more information, refer to [16].)

Hint: first modify

A powerful general method for producing tight contact structures is
the following theorem of Gromov and Eliashberg [6, 23]:
Theorem 1.8 (Gromov–Eliashberg). A symplectically fillable con-
tact structure is tight.
It immediately follows from the symplectic filling theorem that the
standard 
from Example 3 and the contact structures 
from
Example 2 are tight.
Symplectic filling is a 4-dimensional way of checking whether
is tight. We will discuss other methods (including a purely 3-dimensional
one) of proving tightness in Section 5.
1.6. Relationship with foliation theory. Foliations are the other
type of locally homogeneous 2-plane field distributions. The following
table is a brief list of analogous objects from both worlds (note that the
analogies are not precise):

is an integrable 2-plane field distribution, i.e.,
locally given as the kernel of a 1-form
with 
According
to Frobenius’ theorem, 
can locally be written as the kernel of
The world of foliations also breaks up into the topologically significant
taut foliations (i.e., foliations for which there is a closed transversal curve
through each leaf), and the foliations with generalized Reeb components,
which exist on every 3-manifold. A generalized Reeb component is a
compact submanifold 
whose boundary 
is a union of torus
leaves, and such that there are no transversal arcs which begin and end
on 
The primary example of a generalized Reeb component is a Reeb
component, i.e., a foliation of the solid torus 
whose boundary
is a leaf and whose interior is foliated by planes as in Figure 5.
The following is a key theorem which allows us to transfer informa-
tion from foliation theory to contact geometry.

In this section, we investigate embedded surfaces 
in the contact man-
ifold 
The principal notion is that of convexity. For the time
being, 
may be tight or overtwisted.
2.1. Characteristic foliations. Before discussing convexity, we first
examine how 
traces a singular line field on an embedded surface
Definition 2.1. The characteristic foliation 
is the singular foli-
ation induced on 
from 
where 
The singular points
(or tangencies) are points 
where
Lemma 2.2. A 
characteristic foliation
is of Morse–
Smale type, i.e., satisfies the following:
(1) the singularities and closed orbits are dynamically hyperbolic, i.e,
hyperbolic in the dynamical systems sense,
(2) there are no saddle-saddle connections,
(3) every point 
limits to some isolated singularity or closed orbit
in forward time and likewise in backward time.
The proof of Lemma 2.2 uses the fact that a 
perturbation
of 
is still contact. We choose the perturbation of 
to be compactly
supported near 
and hence the isotopy in Gray’s theorem is compactly
supported near 
Therefore, generic properties of 1-forms (in particular
the Morse–Smale condition) are satisfied.
HW 15. Show that if 
is a contact 1-form and 
is any 1-form,
then

There are two types of dynamically hyperbolic singularities: elliptic
and hyperbolic (not in the dynamical systems sense). Choose coordinates

negative elliptic points are sinks. If

Then 
will have
two singular points, the positive elliptic point (0,0,1) and the negative
elliptic point (0,0, –1), and the leaves spiral downward from (0,0,1) to
(0,0,–1).
2. An example of an overtwisted disk D is one which has a positive
elliptic point at the center and radial leaves emanating from the center,
such that 
is a circle of singularities. Often in the literature one sees
overtwisted disks whose boundary is transverse to 
and whose leaves
emanating from the center spiral towards the limit cycle 
(Strictly
speaking, such a D with a limit cycle is not an OT disk according to our
definition, but can easily be modified to fit our definition.)

The importance of the characteristic foliation 
comes from the
following proposition:
Proposition 2.3. 
Let 
and 
be two contact structures which
induce the same characteristic foliation on

2.2. Convexity. The notion of a convex surface, introduced by Giroux
in [19] and extended to the case of a compact surface with Legendrian
boundary by Kanda in [30], is the key ingredient in the cut-and-paste
theory of contact structures.
Definition 2.4. A properly embedded oriented surface 
is convex
if there exists a contact vector field            Here, a contact vector field is
a vector field whose corresponding flow preserves the contact structure
In this article we assume that our convex surfaces are either closed or
compact with Legendrian boundary.
If

orientation to

an boundary, but more care is needed along the boundary.)

properly embedded (smooth) 1-manifold, possibly disconnected and pos-
sibly with boundary)

What Giroux Flexibility tells us is that it is easy to switch between
the two types of characteristic foliations – nonsingular Morse–Smale and
standard form. The following corollary of Giroux Flexibility is a crucial
ingredient in the cut-and-paste theory of contact structures.
Corollary 2.6 (Legendrian realization principle (LeRP)). Let 
be
a convex surface and C be a multicurve on

is nonisolating, i.e., each connected component of

Here #(·) represents cardinality, not geometric intersection.
Now we present the criterion (see [21]) for determining when a con-
vex surface has a tight neighborhood.
Proposition 2.7 (Giroux’s criterion). A convex surface
has a tight neighborhood if and only if 
has no homotopically triv-
ial dividing curves. If 
then there is a tight neighborhood if and

Hint: Use LeRP, together with a trick when

ponents besides the homotopically trivial curve.
The “only if” direction in Giroux’s Criterion follows from HW 19.
The “if” direction follows from constructing an explicit model inside a
tight 3-ball or gluing (for the latter, see [4]).
Suppose that

and the slope,
once a trivialization 
is fixed.
2.3. Convex decomposition theory. The reader may have already
noticed certain similarities between convex surfaces and the theory of
sutured manifolds due to Gabai [17].
Definition 2.8. A sutured manifold 
consists of the following
data:
1) M is a compact, oriented, irreducible 3-manifold; each component
of M has nonempty boundary,
then      is unique up to isotopy, consisting on one (homotopically trivial)

2) 
is a multicurve on 
which has nonempty intersection with each
component of 
and
3) 
divides 
into positive and negative regions, whose sign changes
every time 
is crossed. We write
Here, a 3-manifold M is irreducible if every embedded 2-sphere
bounds
a 3-ball
Note that our definition of a sutured manifold, chosen to simplify
the exposition in this paper, is slightly different from that of Gabai [17].
Definition 2.9. Let S be a compact oriented surface with connect-
ed components 
The Thurston norm of S is:
Definition 2.10. A sutured manifold 
is taut if 
are in-
compressible in M and minimize the Thurston norm in 
Here,
a surface

amongst all the embedded representatives in the relative homology class
We have the following theorem which gives the equivalence between
tightness and tautness in the case of a manifold with boundary (see [26]):

In the rest of this section, we explain how sutured manifold decompo-
sitions have an analog in the contact world, namely the theory of convex
decompositions. Using it we outline the proof of
Definition 2.12. Let S be an oriented, properly embedded surface
in 
which intersects 
transversely. Then a sutured manifold split-
ting 
is given as follows (see Figure 8 for an illustra-
tion) : Define

sutured manifold splittings:

is taut, then it is decomposable.
2. Reconstruction: Given a sutured manifold decomposition, we can
backtrack and construct a taut foliation which is carried by
Now, in the contact category, we choose a dividing set 
so that

If there is an invariant contact structure defined in a neighborhood
of 
with dividing set 
then by an application of LeRP, we
may take 
to be Legendrian. (There are some exceptional cases, but
we will not worry about them here.) Extend the contact structure to
be an invariant contact structure in a neighborhood of S with
dividing set 
Now, if we cut M along S, we obtain a manifold with
corners. To smooth the corners, we apply edge-rounding. This is given
in Figures 9 and 10. Figure 9 gives the surface S before rounding, and
Figure 10 after rounding. Notice that we may think of S as a lid of a
jar, and the edge-rounding operation as twisting to close the jar.
HW 20. Explain why edge-rounding works as in Figures 9 and 10.

Observe that the dividing set in Figure 10 is isotopic to the sutures
in Figure 8. Therefore, given a sutured manifold splitting
there is a corresponding convex splitting
with a 
dividing set 
Using the decomposition theorem of
Gabai, if 
is taut, then there exist s a convex decomposition:
We now work backwards, starting with the following theorem of
Eliashberg [7]:
Theorem 2.14 (Eliashberg). Fix a characteristic foliation adapt-
ed to 
Then there is a unique tight contact structure on
up to isotopy relative to
The following gluing theorem of Colin [4] allows us to inductively
build a universally tight contact structure carried by
Theorem 2.15 (Colin). Let

This theorem and other similar theorems will be discussed in Section
5. Theorem 2.11 is a refinement, in the case of manifolds with boundary,
of the following theorem:
Theorem 2.16 (Gabai–Eliashberg–Thurston). Let M be a orient-
ed, closed, irreducible 3-manifold with 
Then M carries
a universally tight contact structure.
The Gabai–Eliashberg–Thurston theorem was originally proved in
two parts: Gabai [17] proved that such an M carries a taut foliation, and
Eliashberg–Thurston [12] proved that the taut foliation can be perturbed
into a universally tight contact structure. There is also an alternate,
purely 3-dimensional method for proving this theorem [27, 28, 29].

3. Bypasses
In this section, we introduce the other chief ingredient in the cut-and-
paste theory of tight contact structures: the bypass. As a surface is
isotoped inside the ambient tight contact manifold 
the dividing
set changes in discrete units, and the fundamental unit of change is

effected by the bypass. Bypasses would be quite useless if they were
difficult to find. For the cases we examine in Section 4, namely solid
tori, 
and lens spaces, they can be found relatively easily by
examining the next step in the Haken hierarchy. This will be explained
in Section 3.2. For more information on bypasses, refer to [24].
3.1. Definition and examples.
Definition 3.1. Let 
be a convex surface and 
be a Legendrian
arc in 
which intersects 
in three points 
where 
and
are endpoints of 
A bypass half-disk is a convex half-disk D with
Legendrian boundary, where 
and 
is called
the arc of attachment of the bypass, and D is said to be a bypass along
or
REMARK. Most bypasses do not come for free. Finding a bypass
is equivalent to raising the twisting number (or Thurston–Bennequin
invariant) by 1. Although it is easy to lower the twisting number by
attaching “zigzags” in a front projection, raising the twisting number is
usually a nontrivial operation.
Lemma 3.2 (Bypass Attachment Lemma). Let D be a bypass for
If  
is isotoped across D, then we obtain a new convex surface
whose dividing set is obtained from 
via the move in Figure 12.
Note that this is reasonable because a bypass attachment increases
the twisting number along the arc of attachment by 1.
EXAMPLE:
Let us enumerate the possible bypass attachments
– see Figure 13.
(a) is the case where 
and the bypass reduced
by two, while keeping the slope fixed.
(b) is the case where 
and the slope is modified.
In addition, there also are trivial and disallowed moves, which are moves
locally given in Figure 14. It turns out that the trivial move always
exists inside a tight contact manifold, whereas the disallowed move can
never exist inside a tight contact manifold.
HW 21. Is there a bypass attachment which increases

Intrinsic interpretation. Observe that, in case (b), the bypass
move is equivalent to performing a positive Dehn twist along a particu-
lar curve. We can therefore reformulate this bypass move and give an
intrinsic interpretation in terms of the Farey tessellation of the hyper-
bolic unit disk H (Figure 15). The set of vertices of the Farey tessellation

on Lens Spaces
As an illustration of the technology introduced in the previous two sec-
tions, we give a complete classification of tight contact structures on the

We group the basic slices into continued fraction blocks. Each block
consists of all the slopes whose continued fraction representations are
of the same length. In the example, we have two blocks: slope
to –2, and slope –2 to – 1. All the relative half-Euler classes of the
basic slices in the first block are ±(–1,3); for the second block, they are
±(0,1). Therefore, a naive upper bound for the number of tight contact
structures would be 2 to the power #(basic slices).
A closer inspection however reveals that we may shuffle basic slices
which are in the same continued fraction block. More precisely, if

(Contrary to what is
claimed in [24], the general answer is not yet known.)
There are three general methods for proving tightness:
1. Symplectic filling.
2. Gauge theory (in particular Heegaard Floer homology).
3. Gluing (state traversal).
Symplectic filling was already discussed in Section 1.5. We briefly
explain the relationship between contact structures and the Heegaard
Floer homology of Ozsvath and Szabo [40, 41]. To an oriented closed
3-manifold M one can assign a Heegaard Floer homology group
constructed out of the Heegaard decomposition of M. In [42], Ozsvath
and Szabo assigned a class 
to every contact structure
(tight or overtwisted). This was done via the work of Giroux [22]
in which it was shown that every contact structure 
corresponds
to an equivalence class of open book decompositions of M (and hence an
equivalence class of fibered knots). Lisca and Stipsicz [35] showed that
large families of contact structures are tight (but not fillable) by showing
that their Heegaard Floer homology class is nonzero. The Heegaard

5. Gluing

Floer homology approach appears to be very promising at the time of
the writing of this article.
In this section we focus on the last technique, namely gluing. Many
of the key ideas in gluing were introduced by Colin [4, 5] and Makar-
Limanov [39], and subsequently enhanced by Honda [25] who combined
them with the bypass technology.
Let us start by asking the following question:

All of the above examples can be characterized by the fact that
the state transitions are trivial. However, to create more interesting
examples, we need to “traverse all states.”

We outline the development of Asymptotic Convex Geometry, a rela-
tively recent theory having its origin in Convex Geometry and Geo-
metric Functional Analysis, which is concerned with the geometric and
linear properties of high dimensional normed spaces and convex bodies.
The asymptotic theory has succeeded to reveal the underlying order and
structures which accompany high dimensional convex bodies. In many
important respects, convex bodies exhibit less and less diversity as the
dimension increases; all bodies share important common features and
most bodies “look similar.” We demonstrate this unified behavior of the
family of “all convex bodies” through classical results which form the
main body of the theory as well as important very recent discoveries.

Introduction
In this article, we outline a rapidly developing theory of high dimension-
al normed spaces and convex bodies. The classical Convex Geometry,
sometimes called Brunn–Minkowski theory, studies the geometry of con-
vex bodies and related geometric inequalities in Euclidean space of a
fixed dimension (because of this, it is an isometric theory). The classical
Functional Analysis is standardly understood as the theory of infinite di-
mensional spaces. However, it is a relatively recent discovery that there
is a theory “in between,” which is concerned with the geometric and lin-
ear properties of finite dimensional normed spaces or convex bodies, the
emphasis now being on the asymptotic behavior of various quantitative
parameters as the dimension grows to infinity. We call it Asymptotic
Geometric Analysis, but also Asymptotic Convex Geometry (actually,
more names are associated to it: history has not yet selected the right
one). In the framework of this theory, very unexpected phenomena, hid-
den structures and forms of behavior were discovered, new intuition was
built and many new tools were developed. It is now clear that the the-
ory provides the right questions to reveal the underlying “order” and
structures which accompany high dimensional spaces.
The quantitative study of high dimensional normed spaces used
many of the tools of convex geometry. However, these tools were now
used under a different point of view. The isometric questions which
were typical in classical convexity were replaced by isomorphic ones,
which were most natural for functional analysis but alien to convexity.
Isoperimetric type problems provide a bold example of this transfor-
mation. Isomorphic versions of such problems, which make sense only
from the asymptotic point of view, led to the discovery of the concentra-
tion of measure phenomenon, which plays a crucial role in the proof of
Dvoretzky type theorems. Later, the method spread and influenced the
development of other “asymptotic” theories in Probability, Asymptotic
Combinatorics and Complexity, where much more general high paramet-
ric systems arise.
After this major step on the conceptual level, many unsolved prob-
lems of classical convexity were put in asymptotic form and were stud-
ied systematically. In this way, the two theories started to interact with
many deep consequences in both analysis and geometry. Typical exam-
ples are the reverse Brunn–Minkowski inequality and the reverse Santaló

inequality, which provides an affirmative answer — at least in the as-
ymptotic sense — to a classical conjecture of Mahler.
The article is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a brief synop-
sis of the major results of asymptotic convex geometry (the concept
of concentration, Dvoretzky type theorems, Pisier’s inequality on the
Rademacher projection, Milman’s low M*-estimate and the quotient of
subspace theorem, entropy estimates) and of some more recent impor-
tant directions (global theory, asymptotic formulas and phase transition
behavior, “coordinate theory”).
Section 3 contains background material from classical convexity: the
Brunn–Minkowski inequality and its functional forms, the Alexandrov–
Fenchel inequality and related geometric inequalities about mixed vol-
umes of convex bodies, volume preserving transformations (Knöthe and
Brenier maps).
Section 4 describes classical positions of convex bodies such as John’s
position, the minimal surface area and the minimal mean width posi-
tions. They are all characterized as isotropic ones, an observation which
relates them to the Brascamp–Lieb inequality and its reverse form. Some
sharp geometric inequalities are applications of this point of view, a fact
which was first observed and successfully exploited by Ball. We also give
a short account on the challenging slicing problem.
Section 5 gives some classical and recent examples of the interaction
between the asymptotic convex geometry point of view and classical
convexity. The reverse Santaló inequality and the reverse Brunn–Min-
kowski inequality are proved with the method of isomorphic symmetriza-
tion. This discussion introduces M-ellipsoids and their basic properties.

Steiner symmetrizations that are needed in order to bring an arbitrary
convex body close to a ball give another example of use of the asymptotic
theory in questions with classical convexity flavor.
Section 6, which is closer to the spirit of geometric functional anal-
ysis, is devoted to the geometry of the Banach–Mazur compactum and
some questions on the local structure of high-dimensional normed spaces.
Random spaces, which were first introduced by Gluskin, play an impor-
tant role in this discussion.
A number of surveys on different aspects of the theory were recently
published (see [14, 86, 87, 109, 110]). In particular, [54] gives a more
geometrically directed point of view on the theory. However, this article
was written before 1999 and a new stream of results is now available.

We cannot avoid repeating the very basic and already classical line of
development we described, but we refer to [54] for many proofs which are
outlined there in a very condense form. General references on the Brunn–
Minkowski theory and geometric inequalities are the books of Schneider
[134] and Burago–Zalgaller [34]. The reader may consult the books of
Milman–Schechtman [113], Pisier [121] and Tomczak-Jaegermann [147]
for various aspects of the asymptotic theory of finite dimensional normed
spaces.

2.1. Isomorphic isoperimetric inequalities and concentration of
measure. Concentration of measure was understood and developed as
a method for the goals of geometric functional analysis, but it was soon
realized that it was very well adapted to the needs of probability theory,
asymptotic combinatorics and complexity. General references on concen-
tration, from various viewpoints, are the following surveys and books:
[14, 68, 69, 80, 81, 104, 110, 132].
The general framework is a probability space 
where

One can then formulate the abstract isoperimetric problem for metric
probability spaces as follows: Given

available for a few but very important geometric examples.

important case is when                  (see [113]).

teresting techniques were invented in order to estimate the concentration

Natural families of obvious geometric importance are
the following.
1. The family of the orthogonal groups 
equipped
with the Hilbert–Schmidt metric and the Haar probability measure is a
Lévy family with constants 
and
2. The family 
with the natural Riemannian metric
and the product probability measure is a Lévy family with constants
and
3. All homogeneous spaces of
inherit the property of forming
Lévy families. In particular, any family of Stiefel manifolds 
or
any family of Grassman manifolds 
is a Lévy family with the same
constants as in 1. These first three examples appear in [70].
4. The spaces 
with the normalized Hamming distance
and the normalized counting measure
form a Lévy family with constants 
and 
This follows
from an isoperimetric inequality of Harper [72] and it was first stated in
this form and used in [5].

functions (see [80] or [113]).

be a metric probability space. If

Therefore, if the concentration function of X is small, Lipschitz func-
tions are almost constant on almost all space. This observation has very
important applications to the study of the normal Lévy families above.

Many problems which arise in the asymptotic geometric analysis
require the proof of the existence of some geometric structure with pre-
scribed behavior. The basic idea of the probabilistic method is to show
that a random element of a suitable metric probability space has the
required properties. The method (which was first used in combinatorial
geometry and graph theory) works because the desirable structure is
quite often the typical one. The concentration phenomenon provides a
powerful tool for the probabilistic method, since it enables us to identify
the typical structure in many situations. The first appearance of this
idea in Analysis was in the proof of Dvoretzky’s theorem in [97], which
we discuss in the next subsection.
2.2. Dvoretzky type theorems. Dvoretzky’s theorem [40, 41] states
that every high-dimensional normed space has a subspace of “large di-
mension” which is well isomorphic to the Euclidean space. We use
the terminology “Dvoretzky type theorems” for a wide family of re-
sults which exhibit large nice substructures inside normed spaces of suf-
ficiently high dimension. The concrete estimates regarding the different
parameters which enter in this type of results have become a crucial and
important topic in the theory. There are many theorems which provide
such estimates and even asymptotic formulas depending on different pa-
rameters.
The starting point for Dvoretzky’s original theorem is a lemma of
Dvoretzky and Rogers [42], which shows that for every symmetric convex
body K whose maximal volume ellipsoid is 
(see § 4.1), there exist
and a 
subspace

Dvoretzky’s theorem provides an affirmative answer to
this question. The best known version can be stated in the language of
geometric functional analysis as follows.

In other words, X must have Euclidean subspaces
of proportional dimension. This fact underlines the importance of the
concentration of measure phenomenon on the sphere: if some metric
probability space with a normal concentration function well embeds into
a normed space, this must be also true for the Euclidean space.

2.3. The 
and Pisier’s inequality. One of the fundamen-
tal facts in the local theory of normed spaces is Pisier’s estimate on the
K-convexity constant. Combined with important results of Lewis, Figiel
and Tomczak-Jaegermann, it leads to the following geometric statement:
every convex body K in 
has an affine image TK of volume 1 whose
mean width satisfies the “reverse Urysohn inequality”
where 
is an absolute constant. In this subsection we give a very
concise description of this circle of ideas.

Combining the above with John’s estimate

can give an upper bound for the “minimal mean width” of a symmetric
convex body (see § 4.1 for a discussion on different “positions” of convex
bodies).

argument based on the Rogers–Shephard inequality [125] shows that the
symmetry of K is not necessary.

we have
If H satisfies both conditions, repeating the same argument for H*, we
may find a subspace G of H* with

for every 
In other words, F := H/G satisfies
To set up the iteration, we write QS(X) for the class of all quotient
spaces of a subspace of X, and define a function 
by
The argument we have just described proves that
This is enough to estimate the function 
as in Theorem 2.13.
It is natural to ask whether the estimate on the diameter of pro-
portional dimensional sections given by Theorem 2.12 is precise in some
sense. From the computational geometry point of view it would be desir-
able to have a simple way to determine the diameter of a random section

of fixed proportion. One can easily rephrase the Low M*-estimate as fol-
lows [108]: If 
is the solution of the equation
then for a random 
section 
of K we have
In view of Gordon’s proof of Theorem 2.12, we can choose
for any

subset of 
of measure greater than 
It
turns out that the function 
can be used for a dual
estimate [52]. There exists a second function 
with the
following property: if 
and if 
is the solution of the equation
then a random 
section 
of
K satisfies 
This gives a “confidence interval”
for 
which may be viewed as an asymptotic formula. What
is essential is of course that the functions 
and 
can be described
analytically and they do not depend on the dimension 
or on the body
K.
Another consequence of the Low M*-estimate is that very accurate
linear relations hold true in full generality for the diameter of sections of
a body and its polar. This fact can be made precise in the following way
[107]. Let 
be the greatest integer 
for which a random
subspace 
satisfies 
If
then for any 
and any 
we have
where C > 0 is an absolute constant.
2.5. Coordinate theory. We fix an orthonormal basis 
of
and for every non empty 
we consider the coordinate
subspace 
The following coordinate version of
the Low M* -estimate was established by Giannopoulos and Milman in
[51]: If K is an ellipsoid in 
then for every 
we can find
of cardinality 
such that

104
A. A. Giannopoulos and V. D. Milman
This observation (which has its origin in [48, 49]) has consequences for
the question of the maximal Banach–Mazur distance to the cube (see
also the proportional Dvoretzky–Rogers factorization theorem in § 6.1).
The proof has its roots in an isomorphic version of the Sauer–Shelah
lemma from Combinatorics, which was proved by Szarek and Talagrand
[141] (see also [3, 142]), and is close in spirit to the theory of restricted
invertibility of operators which was developed by Bourgain and Tzafriri
[30].
As the example of the cube shows, one cannot have a coordinate low
M*-estimate for an arbitrary convex body. Under assumptions which
guarantee the existence of “large ellipsoids” of any proportional dimen-
sion inside the body, one can use the above ellipsoidal result and obtain
analogues of (2.5.1). This is done in [51] for bodies whose volume ratio
or cotype-2 constant is well-bounded. These results can be applied to
give estimates on the number of points with “many” integer coordinates
inside a given convex body.
Very recently, Rudelson and Vershynin [130] obtained a new family
of coordinate results. Assume that K is a symmetric convex body in
such that the norm 
induced by K satisfies the conditions
for all 
and 
for some positive constant 
Then,
there exist two positive numbers 
and 
with

and a subset 
of 
with cardinality
such that
for all choices of reals 
From this statement one can recover
Elton’s theorem about spaces which contain large dimensional copies of
[43] in an optimal form.
Note that the space 
satisfies
In other words, the result concerns spaces which have Euclidean
subspaces of some dimension proportional to 
(depending on 
The
estimate in (2.5.2) shows that
This may be viewed as a coordinate version of the low M*-estimate for
this class of bodies. The formulation is dual to the one in (2.5.1): one
now considers sections instead of projections. The condition
is in some sense dual to the assumptions on the volume ratio or the
cotype-2 constant in [51].

Asymptotic Convex Geometry
105
To feel the analogy even more, we state the following “condition-
free” version of the result in [130]: Let K be a symmetric convex body in
with 
There exists a subset 
of 
with cardinality
such that
where
Compare with the low M*-estimate: one
has sections of the body inside an appropriate 
on coordinate sub-
spaces (this is weaker, but the example of 
shows that it is natural).
Also, the parameter 1/M* is replaced by M (which is stronger). Howev-
er, the estimates hold for some proportional dimensions and not for any
proportion.
All these are still preliminary but interesting results which show that
a coordinate theory may be further developed in the future. This would
have several consequences for the theory.

The most classical estimate on covering numbers is Sudakov’s in-

From Theorem 2.15 one can deduce Sudakov’s inequality with a duality
argument of Tomczak-Jaegermann [146].
We close this subsection with some information on the duality con-
jecture for the entropy numbers of operators. The conjecture, which
was stated by Pietsch [118], asserts that if X, Y are Banach spaces, if
is a compact operator and if

only under strong assumptions for both spaces X and Y (see [65] and

the conjecture is equivalent to the following statement about covering
numbers of convex bodies: There exist two constants 
such that

that this inequality proves the duality conjecture in the case where the
logarithm of the covering numbers is large enough with respect to the
dimension
Very recently, Artstein, Milman and Szarek [7, 8] proved (2.6.7) in
full generality. This settles the duality conjecture in the case either X or
Y = H (a Hilbert space). The proof consists of three steps: Given a sym-
metric convex body K in 
in the first step one shows that there exists
a parameter 
depending on K such that

sets under
such random projections, so the information on covering numbers is kept

is chosen so
that the result of [79] will be enough to give duality for the projected
bodies.
This step can be iterated, each time applied to an intersection of
some multiple of K with a ball of suitable radius (here, a variant of Tom-
czak’s duality argument is used). As a result, 
and
are bounded by products of covering numbers of polar bodies. In the
last step, each product can be “telescoped” to a product of only two or
three terms, which establishes duality.

ric) convex body in

The same situation appears if one considers a dual “global problem.”

with the random one (expectation of the diameter).
The fact that the “asymptotic formula” 
holds true for

statements can be translated to global ones, and a very useful intuition

statements are not “direct translations” of each other, and they should
often be invented from the start.

to the Asymptotic Theory

tional forms. The fundamental Brunn–Minkowski inequality states that
if K and T are two nonempty compact subsets of 
then
If we make the additional hypothesis that K and T are convex bodies,
then we can have equality only if K and T are homothetical.
The inequality expresses in a sense the fact that volume is an
function with respect to Minkowski addition. For this reason,
it is often written in the following form: If K, T are nonempty compact

then
Using (3.1.2) and the arithmetic-geometric means inequality we can also
write
This weaker, but actually equivalent, form of the Brunn–Minkowski in-
equality has the advantage (or disadvantage) of being dimension free.
There are many interesting proofs of the Brunn-Minkowski inequal-
ity, all of them related to important ideas. Historically, the first proof of
the Brunn–Minkowski inequality was based on Brunn’s concavity prin-
ciple:
Theorem 3.1. Let K be a convex body in 
and let F be a
subspace of
Then, the function
defined by 
is concave on its support.
The proof goes by symmetrization. The Steiner symmetrization of
K in the direction of 
is the set 
consisting of all points
of the form 
where 
is in the projection 
of K onto
and 
Steiner symmetrization preserves
convexity and volume: if K is a convex body then 
is also a convex
body, and 
A well known fact which goes back to Steiner
and Schwarz is that for every convex body K one can find a sequence
of successive Steiner symmetrizations in directions 
so that the
limiting convex body 
has the following property:
For every 
is a ball with center at
and radius 
such that
Now, the proof of the theorem is immediate. Convexity of

as follows. If K and T are convex bodies in

A functional form of the Brunn–Minkowski inequality is an integral
inequality which reduces to (3.1.1) by appropriate choice of the functions
involved. The advantage of such functional inequalities is that they can
be applied in many other contexts: an example is given by the Prékopa-
Leindler inequality (see [121] or [14]) which is stated below: it can be
applied to yield the logarithmic Sobolev inequality and several important
concentration results in Gauss space.

There are many variants of the Prékopa–Leindler inequality. All of
them can be proved by a “transportation of measure” argument similar
to the one used above. We shall state one of them and use it to give
a functional version of a proof of Brunn’s principle which was given by
Gromov and Milman [71].

The Prékopa–Leindler inequality and the statement above, have re-
cently been extended to Riemannian manifolds [37]. There, the curva-
ture plays an essential role (through the Ricci curvature, in particular)
and a distortion coefficient has to be added to the condition (3.1.5). We
will state the spherical extension of the Prékopa–Leindler inequality ob-
tained in [36]. Let

Minkowski inequality holds on the sphere for the geodesic midsum of two

results for the sphere.

and
There are many other inequalities on positive symmetric matrices, and
one is tempted to look for their analogues in the setting of convex geome-
try. An inequality of Bergstrom (see [18]), which is the matrix analogue
of (3.2.9), states that if A and B are symmetric positive definite matrices
This is generalized by Ky Fan in the form
where 
is the submatrix of A we obtain if we delete 
rows and the
corresponding columns of A. For 
this reduces to Minkowski’s
inequality 
For related inequali-
ties about mixed volumes see [50, 46].
One last comment is that behind all these numerical or convex geo-
metric inequalities there is a unified principle: “the minimum of certain

functionals is achieved on equal objects.” Statements like the Brunn–
Minkowski or the Alexandrov–Fenchel inequality may be equivalently
expressed in the form
The Brunn–Minkowski inequality can be rederived from its simple
consequence
Likewise, the
Alexandrov–Fenchel inequality is equivalent to the inequality
The same principle applies to all the hyperbolic type inequalities we
discussed in this subsection. In contrast, “elliptic type” inequalities like
the triangle inequality and the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality obey a “max-
imum principle”: for example, the latter inequality is equivalent to the
statement
The maximum of the functional 
is “achieved on
equal objects.” Hölder’s inequality is also a consequence of such an
“elliptic” principle, which should however be correctly applied so that
the functions 
and 
involved stay in “correct” spaces. If 
and 
are
conjugate exponents, then the inequality

is equivalent to the classical Hölder’s inequal-
ity.
3.3. Volume preserving transformations. Let K and T be two
open convex bodies in 
A volume preserving transformation from K
onto T is a map 
which is one to one, onto and has a Jacobian
with constant determinant equal to |K|/|T|. In this section we describe
two such maps, the Knöthe map and the Brenier map. Applying each
one of them we may obtain alternative proofs of the Brunn–Minkowski
inequality.
The Knöthe map. We fix a coordinate system in 
The prop-
erties of the Knöthe map [78] from K to T with respect to the given
coordinate system are described in the following theorem.

The Brenier map. For any two open convex bodies K and T
there exists a volume preserving transformation from K onto T, called
the Brenier map [33], which is the gradient of a 
convex function.

transportation of measure result which we briefly describe.

the two theories is obvious. Also, some particular cases are indeed sim-

choice of a position is often quite important for the study of geometric
quantities. For example, let K be a symmetric convex body in 
and
consider the volume product 
The Blaschke–
Santaló inequality asserts that

ellipsoid (note that 
is invariant under 
On the other hand,
a simple application of Hölder’s inequality shows that

This implies that
Therefore, in order to obtain a reverse Blaschke–Santaló inequality it is
useful to study the quantity
One way to estimate this minimum is using the 
of K, and
Pisier’s inequality shows that the above quantity is bounded by
Thus, the 
provides a first quite nontrivial reverse inequality
for the volume product
All classical positions of convex bodies arise as solutions of such
extremal problems. We often normalize the volume of K to be 1 and
ask for the maximum or minimum of

is the
product of the mean widths of a body and its polar). Another useful
normalization is 
we then say that the volume radius of
K is equal to 1. Below we describe some classical positions of a given
convex body K which solve natural extremal problems. An interesting
feature of this procedure is that a simple variational method leads to a
geometric description of the extremal position, and that in many cases
this position satisfies an isotropic condition for an appropriate measure

There exists an analogue of this fact for the not necessarily sym-
metric case (see, for example, [54]). From John’s decomposition of the
identity one can recover all the available information about John’s posi-
tion: for example, the Dvoretzky–Rogers lemma is a simple consequence
of (4.1.5).
John’s decomposition of the identity holds in a much more general
context: If K and L are (not necessarily symmetric) convex bodies in
we say that L is of maximal volume in K if 
and, for every

This fact was
proved in [57] under some conditions on K and L (in the symmetric
case it had been observed by Milman, see [147]). A second proof was
recently given in [66], where the decomposition is also used to establish
that for any symmetric convex body K in

Every convex body (in fact, every compact set) has
an isotropic position, which is unique up to orthogonal transformations.
This position may again be described as the solution of an extremal
problem of the type we discussed in the previous subsection (see [111]
for an extensive survey of all these facts).

value of the volume of a random simplex inside K . Uniform boundedness

1-unconditional basis, zonoids and their polars, etc. For partial answers
to the question, see [111, 9]. The best known general upper estimate is
due to Bourgain [23]:

For a sketch of the proof, see [54] (the argument follows the presentation
of [38], see also [116] for the not-necessarily symmetric case).
There is a renewed interest in the problem. We mention here a very
recent result of Bourgain, Klartag and Milman [24] which reduces the
question to convex bodies with bounded volume ratio. There exists a
constant A > 1 with the following property: if for all

The multidimensional version of the Brascamp–Lieb inequality was

inequality and its reverse form is due to Barthe [16] and follows the
idea of the proof of the one-dimensional case. However, instead of the
direct transportation of measure argument there, one now has to make
essential use of the Brenier map.
4.4. Sharp geometric inequalities. As § 4.1 shows, isotropic posi-
tions of convex bodies and the corresponding decompositions of the
identity are typical in the asymptotic theory: isotropicity may be viewed
as the ultimate form of nondegeneracy. Ball made the very important
observation that the constants in the Brascamp–Lieb inequality and its
reverse form take a surprisingly simple form in the presence of such a
decomposition of the identity.

Ball applied the Brascamp–Lieb inequality in this context to solve
purely geometric problems. A well-known example is his reverse isoperi-
metric inequality [12], which gives the exact value of the constant
in (4.1.4). We ask for the best constant 
for which every symmetric
convex body K in 
has a position 
satisfying
The natural position of K is the minimal surface area position. However,

results which answer deep questions of the Brunn–Minkowski theory, at
least in their asymptotic version. Here, the main ideas and methods we
described in § 2 find applications to classical convexity.
Our first example is the inverse Blaschke–Santaló inequality of Bour-
gain and Milman [28], which gives an “affirmative answer” to Mahler’s
conjecture (see § 4.1).

The original proof of Theorem 5.1 used a dimension descending pro-
cedure which was based on the quotient of subspace theorem. We will
describe a proof using the method of isomorphic symmetrization [105].
This is closer to classical convexity and much more geometric in nature
since it preserves dimension: however, it is a symmetrization scheme
which is in many ways different from the classical symmetrizations. In
each step, none of the natural parameters of the body is being preserved,
but the ones which are of interest remain under control. After a finite

abilistic methods. The general idea is to estimate the distance
by a suitable average of norm-products. The method of random orthogo-
nal factorizations (which has its origin in work of Tomczak-Jaegermann,
and was later developed and used by Benyamini and Gordon [20]) uses
the integral

bound for 
An inequality of Marcus and Pisier allows one to pass
from 
to matrices whose entries are independent standard Gaussian
variables and then use Chevet’s inequality from the theory of Gaussian
processes in order to control this average (see [147]). Using this method
one can prove a general inequality in terms of the type-2 constants of
the spaces [39]:

man [27] to

Mazur compactum. This can be made a precise question as follows: Does
there exist a function

of random 
normed spaces and

spaces

The class 
is defined as follows: we consider a sequence
of independent standard Gaussian random variables on some pro-

Theorem 6.2 was the starting point for a systematic study of random
spaces. Random quotients of 
provided examples of the worst possible
order for several parameters of the local theory. It turns out that a ran-
dom space 
has a rather “poor” family of bounded operators.
It was observed by Gluskin [59], that a random space 
has the
following property: any projection P in X of rank           satisfies
As a consequence such a space has basis constant
[Recall that the basis constant 
of an 
normed space
X is the infimum of the basis constants 
over all bases of
X.] This follows immediately from the fact that, by the definition of
the basis constant, in any 
normed space X there exists a
projection P of rank 
with
Szarek [137] modified the random structure on 
and was able to
construct an 
normed space X with 
Because
of John’s theorem this order is optimal. Mankiewicz [91] applied the
random spaces method to construct finite dimensional spaces with the
worst (in order) possible symmetric constant. In this work Mankiewicz
used the “space mixing” property of the irreducible group of operators.
Szarek [139] explicitly introduced the notion of the class 
of
mixing operators which is the set of all linear operators T, satisfying
for some 
subspace E and every 
It is not difficult
to show that any projection P of rank 
is 
mixing. Then,
Szarek showed that the mixing property is sufficient for proving the
results of [91], but also [59] and [137]. In particular, he proved that for
a random space 
one has

It should be mentioned that the random space method allows us to
construct a sequence of finite dimensional normed spaces, which serve
as blocks for the construction of examples of infinite dimensional spaces
with some unexpected properties: real isomorphic complex Banach spaces
which are not complex isomorphic (Bourgain [22]), a Banach space
without a basis which has the bounded approximation property (Szarek
[140]) etc.

with large Banach–Mazur distance to

the only known example of a pair of spaces with distance significantly
larger than 
in which one of the two spaces is concrete.

version of Wigner’s semicircle law: if

In the last years it was understood that the ideas and arguments used
in the study of random quotients of 
could be transferred to a much
more general setting. The idea of studying random projections of arbi-
trary high-dimensional convex bodies comes from Bourgain, and it was
developed in a whole theory by Mankiewicz and Tomczak-Jaegermann
(see the survey article [93]). The starting observation is that the main
geometric properties of a random space in 
can be satisfied by pro-
jections of an arbitrary convex body if they are put in a suitable position.
More precisely, for  fixed
and for every                          convex
body K, there exist a 
projection 
and a
Euclidean norm on E satisfying the following properties:

The proof of this fact makes use of the M-ellipsoids. Properties
1 and 2 correspond to the two geometric properties of
The third one, which was also clear by construction in our previous
discussion, is allowed in the general setting because of the proportional
Dvoretzky–Rogers factorization (Theorem 6.1).
An example of this line of thought is the following recent result from
[92]: If 
and 
are two symmetric convex bodies in 
whose min-
imal volume ellipsoid is the Euclidean unit ball, then for every propor-
tional dimension 
the average distance between
projections 
and 
of 
and 
is bounded from below
by the product of the average distances
where can be taken equal to 
for any small
Random spaces were used very recently by Szarek and Tomczak-
Jaegermann [144] to provide a strong negative answer to a series of
questions raised in the mid-eighties (see [102]), which roughly speak-
ing asked if the cotype properties of every 
normed space
improve by passing to quotients of proportional dimension. A typical ex-
ample is the following: Is it true that there is an absolute constant C > 0
such that every 
space X has a quotient 
of dimension
such that the cotype-2 constant of 
is bounded by
C? Recall that this is true if we replace bounded cotype-2 constant by
bounded volume ratio (and, by a result of Bourgain and Milman [28],
the first property implies the second). A positive answer would be of
obvious importance, since all the theory of type and cotype would enter
decisively in the study of general convex bodies.
For any given finite dimensional space W, Szarek and Tomczak-
Jaegermann construct a space X of an appropriately larger dimension,
which is well saturated with W. The precise statement is the following:
Let 
and 
be positive integers with 
If W is a
normed space with 
there exists
an 
normed space X such that: if 
every
quotient     of X contains a 1-complemented subspace
isometric to W.
Let us give a direct application of this fact: If we choose
with 
and consider an 
space X as above, taking

we see that the cotype-2 constant of every
quotient

Singularities of Special
Lagrangian Submanifolds
Dominic Joyce†
Lincoln College
Oxford, UK
We survey what is known about singularities of special Lagrangian sub-
manifolds (SL 
in (almost) Calabi–Yau manifolds. The bulk of
the paper summarizes the author’s work [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] on SL
X with isolated conical singularities. That is, near each singular
point 
X is modelled on an SL cone C in 
with isolated singularity
at 0. We also discuss directions for future research, and give a list of
open problems.
1. Introduction
Special Lagrangian
(SL 
are a distinguished class of real
minimal submanifolds which may be defined in 
or
in Calabi–Yau 
or more generally in almost Calabi–Yau
(compact Kähler 
with trivial canonical bundle). They are of

interest to Differential Geometers, to String Theorists (a species of the-
oretical physicist), and perhaps in the future to Algebraic Geometers.
This article will discuss the singularities of SL
a field which
has received little attention until quite recently. We begin in §2 with a
brief introduction to special Lagrangian geometry and (almost) Calabi–
Yau 
Sections 3–7 survey the author’s series of papers [18, 19,
20, 21, 22] on SL 
with isolated conical singularities, a large
class of singularities which are simple enough to study in detail. The
last and longest section, §8, suggests directions for future research and
gives some open problems.
We say that a compact SL 
X in an almost Calabi–Yau
M for 
has isolated conical singularities if it has only finitely many
singular points 
in M, such that for some special Lagrangian
cones 
in 
with 
\ {0} nonsingular, X approaches
near 
in an asymptotic 
sense. The exact definition is given in §3.3.
Section 4 discusses the regularity of SL
X with conical singu-
larities 
i.e., how quickly X converges to the cone 
near
with all derivatives. In 
we consider the deformation theory of compact
SL 
X with conical singularities. We find that the moduli space
of deformations of X in M is locally homeomorphic to the zeroes of
a smooth map 
between finite-dimensional vector spaces,
and if the obstruction space 
is zero then 
is a smooth manifold.
Section 6 is an aside on Asymptotically Conical SL m-folds (AC

which are asymptotic at infinity to an SL cone C at a prescribed rate
In §7 we explain how to desingularize of a compact SL 
X
with conical singularities 
with cones

in an almost
Calabi–Yau 
M. We take AC SL 
in 
asymptotic to
at infinity, and glue
into X at 
for small 
to get a smooth
family of compact, nonsingular SL 
in M, with

For brevity I generally give only statements of results, with at most
brief sketches of proofs. For the same reason I have left out several
subjects I would like to discuss. Some particular omissions are:
We give very few examples of SL 
But many examples are
known in 
in [2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
and other papers.
We give no applications of the results of §3–§7. See [22, §8–§10].

We do not discuss smooth families of almost Calabi–Yau
However, all the main results of §2.4, §5 and §7 have extensions to
families, which can be found in [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. The discussion
of index of singularities in §8.1, and its applications in §8.3 and §8.4,
would also be improved by extending it to families.
2. Special Lagrangian Geometry
We begin with some background from symplectic geometry. Then special
Lagrangian submanifolds (SL 
are introduced both in 
and
in almost Calabi–Yau 
We also describe the deformation theory
of compact SL 
Some references for this section are McDuff and
Salamon [26], Harvey and Lawson [3], McLean [28], and the author [13].
2.1. Background from symplectic geometry. We start by recalling
some elementary symplectic geometry, which can be found in McDuff and
Salamon [26]. Here are the basic definitions.
Definition 2.1. Let M be a smooth manifold of even dimension
A closed 2-form 
on M is called a symplectic form if the
is nonzero at every point of M. Then 
is called a symplectic
manifold. A submanifold N in M is called Lagrangian if
 and
The simplest example of a symplectic manifold is
Definition 2.2. Let
have coordinates
and define the standard metric 
and symplectic form 
on 
by
Then 
is a symplectic manifold. When we wish to identify
with 
we take the complex coordinates 
on 
to be
For R > 0, define 
to be the open ball of radius R
about 0 in
Darboux’s Theorem [26, Theorem 3.15] says that every symplectic
manifold is locally isomorphic to 
Our version easily follows.
Theorem 2.3. Let

Given an isomorphism

Let N be a real 
Then its tangent bundle T* N has a
canonical symplectic form 
defined as follows. Let 
be local
coordinates on N. Extend them to local coordinates
on T*N such that
represents the 1-form
in 
Then
Identify N with the zero section in T*N. Then N is a Lagrangian
submanifold of T*N. The Lagrangian Neighborhood Theorem [26, Theo-
rem 3.33] shows that any compact Lagrangian submanifold N in a sym-
plectic manifold looks locally like the zero section in T*N.
Theorem 2.4. Let 
be a symplectic manifold and
a compact Lagrangian submanifold. Then there exists an open tubular
neighborhood U of the zero section N in T *N, and an embedding
with 
and 
where 
is the
canonical symplectic structure on T*N.
We shall call U, 
a Lagrangian neighborhood of N. Such neighbor-
hoods are useful for parametrizing nearby Lagrangian submanifolds of
M. Suppose that 
is a Lagrangian submanifold of M which is
to N. Then 
lies in

of the graph

is a closed 1-form. This
establishes a 1-1 correspondence between small closed 1-forms on N and
Lagrangian submanifolds 
close to N in M, which is an essential tool
in proving later results.
2.2. Special Lagrangian submanifolds in
We define calibra-
tions and calibrated submanifolds, following [3].
Definition 2.5.
Let 
be a Riemannian manifold. An oriented
tangent 
V on M is a vector subspace V of some tangent space
to M with
equipped with an orientation. If V is an
oriented tangent 
on M then 
is a Euclidean metric on V, so
combining 
with the orientation on V gives a natural volume form
 on V, which is a 
on V.
of a unique 
1-form 
on N.

Now let 
be a closed 
on M. We say that 
is a calibration
on M if for every oriented 
V on M we have 
Here
for some 
and 
if 
Let N be an
oriented submanifold of M with dimension 
Then each tangent space
for 
is an oriented tangent 
We say that N is a
calibrated submanifold if                             for all
It is easy to show that calibrated submanifolds are automatically
minimal submanifolds [3, Theorem II.4.2]. Here is the definition of spe-
cial Lagrangian submanifolds in 
taken from [3, §III].
Definition 2.6. Let
have complex coordinates 
and
define a metric 
a real 2-form 
and a complex 
on 
by
Then 
are as in Definition 2.2, and 
and

on 
Let L be an oriented real submanifold of 
of real dimension
We say that L is a special Lagrangian submanifold of
or SL
for short, if L is calibrated with respect to 
in the sense of
Definition 2.5.
Harvey and Lawson [3, Corollary III.1.11] give the following alter-
native characterization of special Lagrangian submanifolds:
Proposition 2.7. Let L be a real
submanifold of
Then L admits an orientation making it into an SL submanifold
of 
if and only if 
and
Thus special Lagrangian submanifolds are Lagrangian submanifolds
satisfying the extra condition that
which is how they get
their name.
2.3. Almost Calabi–Yau
and SL
We shall define
special Lagrangian submanifolds not just in Calabi–Yau manifolds, as
usual, but in the much larger class of almost Calabi–Yau manifolds.
Definition 2.8. Let 
An almost Calabi–Yau 
is a
quadruple 
such that (M, J) is a compact
complex manifold, 
is the Kähler form of a Kähler metric 
on M,
and 
is a non-vanishing holomorphic 
on M.

This is not the usual definition of a Calabi–Yau manifold, but is
essentially equivalent to it.
Definition 2.9. Let 
be an almost Calabi–Yau
and N a real 
submanifold of M. We call N a special
Lagrangian submanifold, or SL 
for short, if
It easily follows that 
is a nonvanishing
 on N. Thus N is
orientable, with a unique orientation in which 
is positive.
Again, this is not the usual definition of SL 
but is essentially
equivalent to it. Suppose

as in Definition 2.6. This recovers the
usual definition of special Lagrangian
in Calabi-Yau
2.4.
Deformations of compact SL
The deformation theory
of special Lagrangian submanifolds was studied by McLean [28, §3], who
proved the following result in the Calabi-Yau case. The extension to the
almost Calabi-Yau case is described in [13, §.9.5].
Theorem 2.10. Let N be a compact SL 
in an almost Calabi–
Yau 
Then the moduli space
of special La-
grangian deformations of N is a smooth manifold of dimension

SKETCH OF PROOF. There is a natural orthogonal decomposition
where
is the normal bundle of N in M.
As N is Lagrangian, the complex structure 
gives an
isomorphism 
But the metric 
gives an isomorphism
Composing these two gives an isomorphism
Let T be a small tubular neighborhood of N in M. Then we can
identify T with a neighborhood of the zero section in 
Using the iso-
morphism 
we have an identification between T and a neigh-
borhood of the zero section in T*N. This can be chosen to identify the
Kähler form 
on T with the natural symplectic structure on T*N. Let
be the obvious projection.
Under this identification, submanifolds 
in 
which are
close to N are identified with the graphs of small smooth sections 
of
T*N. 
That is, submanifolds
of M close to N are identified with
1-forms on N We need to know: which 1-forms

But by Hodge theory, this is isomorphic
to the de Rham cohomology group 
and is a manifold with
dimension
To carry out this last step rigorously requires some technical ma-
chinery: one must work with certain Banach spaces of sections of T *N,
and 
use elliptic regularity results to show the map
has closed image in these Banach spaces, and then
use the Implicit Function Theorem for Banach spaces to show that the
kernel of the map is what we expect.

by (6), as
by (5).
We call C stable if s-ind(C) = 0.
Following [18, Definition 6.7], we call C rigid if
dim G. As
we see that if C is stable, then C is rigid.
We shall see in §5 that s-ind(C) is the dimension of an obstruction
space to deforming an SL 
X with a conical singularity with cone
C, and that if C is stable then the deformation theory of X simplifies.
An SL cone C is rigid if all infinitesimal deformations of C as an SL cone
come from 
rotations of C. This will be useful in the Geometric
Measure Theory material of §4.

we can compute the data of §3.1 very explicitly.

and some 
satisfying (11), then we can choose a natural

(12) holds for all

satisfying (11). Thus the
number of derivatives required in (12) and the choice of

little difference. We choose 
in (12), and some 
in (11), to
make the definition as weak as possible.
We suppose 
for two reasons. Firstly, the only SL cones in
are finite unions of SL planes 
in 
intersecting only at 0. Thus
any SL 2-fold with conical singularities is actually nonsingular as an
immersed 2-fold, so there is really no point in studying them. Secondly,

and it is simpler to
exclude it. Therefore we will suppose

homology of SL

fold, write

de Rham cohomology group and

4. The Asymptotic Behavior of X near
We now review the work of [18] on the regularity of SL               with con-
ical singularities.  Let M be an almost Calabi–Yau  
and X an SL
in M with conical singularities at

deduce asymptotic bounds for

Theorem 4.2 in effect strengthens the definition of SL 
with
conical singularities, Definition 3.7, as it shows that (12) actually implies
the much stronger condition (15) on all derivatives.
To prove Theorem 4.2, we show using an analogue of Theorem 2.4
for

Using known results on the regularity of solu-
tions of nonlinear second-order elliptic p.d.e.s, and a theory of analysis
on weighted Sobolev spaces on manifolds with cylindrical ends developed
by Lockhart and McOwen [24], we can then prove (15).
Our next result [18, Theorem 6.8] is an application of Geometric
Measure Theory. For an introduction to the subject, see Morgan [29].
Geometric Measure Theory studies measure-theoretic generalizations of
submanifolds called integral currents, which may be very singular, and
is particularly powerful for minimal submanifolds. As from §2 SL
are minimal submanifolds w.r.t. an appropriate metric, many major
results of Geometric Measure Theory immediately apply to special La-
grangian integral currents, a very general class of singular SL
with strong compactness properties.
Theorem 4.3. Let

and define 
as in (3). 
Let

morphism

1 tangent cone to T at 
where C is a rigid special Lagrangian cone in
, in the sense of Definition 3.4. Then T has a conical singularity at
in the sense of Definition 3.7.
This is a weakening of Definition 3.7 for rigid cones C. Theorem 4.3
also holds for the larger class of Jacobi integrable SL cones C, defined

178
Dominic Joyce
in [18, Definition 6.7]. Basically, Theorem 4.3 shows that if a singular
SL 
T in M is locally modelled on a rigid SL cone C in only a
very weak sense, then it necessarily satisfies Definition 3.7. One moral
of Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 is that, at least for rigid SL cones C, more-
or-less any sensible definition of SL           with conical singularities is
equivalent to Definition 3.7.
Theorem 4.3 is proved by applying regularity results of Allard and
Almgren, and Adams and Simon, mildly adapted to the special La-
grangian situation, which roughly say that if a tangent cone 
to X
at 
has an isolated singularity at 0, is multiplicity 1, and rigid, then X
has a parametrization 
near 
which satisfies (12) for some 
It
then quickly follows that X has a conical singularity at 
in the sense
of Definition 3.7.
As discussed in [18, §6.3], one can use other results from Geometric
Measure Theory to argue that for tangent cones C which are not Jacobi
integrable, Definition 3.7 may be too strong, in that there could exist
examples of singular SL 
with tangent cone C which are not
covered by Definition 3.7, as the decay conditions (12) are too strict.
5. Moduli of SL
with Conical Singularities
Next we review the work of [19] on deformation theory for compact SL
with conical singularities. Following [19, Definition 5.4], we define
the space 
of compact SL 
in M with conical singularities
deforming a fixed SL 
X with conical singularities.
Definition 5.1. Let

and X a compact SL 
in M with conical singularities at

and cones

moduli space 
of deformations of X to be the set of

it is the natural choice. We will not repeat the complicated definition
here; readers are referred to [19, §5] for details. In [19, Theorem 6.10]
we describe

between the
infinitesimal deformation space

and we deduce [19, Corol-

manifold of dimension dim
This has clear similarities with Theorem 2.10. Here is another simple
condition for 
to be a manifold near X, [19, Definition 6.12].
Definition 5.4. Let
be an almost Calabi–Yau
and X a compact SL 
in M with conical singularities, and let
and 
be as in Theorem 5.2. We call X transverse if the
linear map 
is surjective.
If X is transverse then 
is a manifold near 0, so
Theorem 5.2 yields [19, Corollary 6.13]:

is an almost Calabi–Yau
and X a transverse compact SL
in M with conical singulari-
ties, and let 
and 
be as in Theorem 5.2. Then 
is near
X a smooth manifold of dimension
Now there are a number of well-known moduli space problems in
geometry where in general moduli spaces are obstructed and singular,
but after a generic perturbation they become smooth manifolds. For
instance, moduli spaces of instantons on 4-manifolds can be made smooth
by choosing a generic metric, and similar things hold for Seiberg–Witten
equations, and moduli spaces of pseudo-holomorphic curves in symplectic
manifolds.
In [19, §9] we try (but do not quite succeed) to replicate this for
moduli spaces of SL 
with conical singularities, by choosing a
generic Kähler metric in a fixed Kähler class. This is the idea behind [19,
Conjecture 9.5]:
Conjecture 5.6. 
Let
be an almost Calabi–Yau
X a compact SL
in M with conical singularities, and 
be
as in Theorem 5.2. Then for a second category subset of Kähler forms
in the Kähler class of  
the moduli space 
of compact SL
with conical singularities in 
isotopic to X consists solely
of transverse 
and so is a manifold of dimensi on
A partial proof of this is given in [19, §9]. If we could treat the
moduli spaces 
as compact, the conjecture would follow from [19,
Theorem 9.3]. However, without knowing        is compact, the condition
that 
is smooth everywhere is in effect the intersection of an infinite
number of genericity conditions on 
and we do not know that this
intersection is dense (or even nonempty) in the Kähler class.
Notice that Conjecture 5.6 constrains the topology and cones of SL
X with conical singularities that can occur in a generic almost
Calabi–Yau 
as we must have
6. Asymptotically Conical SL
We now discuss Asymptotically Conical SL 
L in 
[18, Defi-
nition 7.1].

parallels between the theories of SL

of Asymptotically Conical SL

has been studied independently by Pacini [30] and Marshall [25].
Pacini’s results are earlier, but Marshall’s are more complete.
Definition 6.4. Suppose L is an Asymptotically Conical SL
in

as in Definition 6.1. Define the moduli
space 
of deformations of L with rate

One can define a natural topology on 
in a similar way to the conical
singularities case of [19, Definition 5.6].
Note that if L is an AC SL 
with rate 
then it is also an AC
SL 
with rate 
for any 
Thus we have defined a 1-
parameter family of moduli spaces 
for L, and not just one. Since we
did not impose any condition on 
in Definition 6.1 analogous to (11) in
the conical singularities case, it turns out that 
depends nontrivially
on
The following result can be deduced from Marshall [25, Theorem
6.2.15] and [25, Table 5.1]. (See also Pacini [30, Theorems 2 and 3].) It
implies conjectures by the author in [6, Conjecture 2.12] and [13, §10.2].

This is the analogue of Theorems 2.10 and 5.2 for AC SL
If 
then the deformation theory for L with rate
is unobstructed and 
is a smooth manifold with a given dimension.
This is similar to the case of nonsingular compact SL 
in Theorem
2.10, but different to the conical singularities case in Theorem 5.2.

Let L be an
AC SL 
in 
with cone C, and set 
Using the
notation of §3.4, as in (13) there is a long exact sequence
Following [18, Definition 7.2] we define cohomological invariants
Y(L), Z(L) of L.

7. Desingularizing Singular SL
We now discuss the work of [20, 21] on desingularizing compact SL
with conical singularities. Here is the basic idea. Let

and X a compact SL 
in M

is close to special Lagrangian (its phase is nearly
constant), but also close to singular (it has large curvature and small
injectivity radius). We prove using analysis that for small 
we
can deform 
to a special Lagrangian 
in M, using a small
Hamiltonian deformation.
The proof involves a delicate balancing act, showing that the ad-
vantage of being close to special Lagrangian outweighs the disadvantage
ofbeing nearly singular. Doing this in full generality is rather complex.
Here is our simplest desingularization result, [20, Theorem 6.13].

8. Directions for Future Research
Finally we discuss directions the field of special Lagrangian singularities
might develop in the future, giving a number of problems the author
believes are worth attention. Some of these problems may be too difficult
to solve completely, but can still serve as a guide.

In good cases, say if 
is suitably generic, it seems rea-
sonable that 
should be divided into a number of strata, each of
which is a moduli space of singular SL 
with singularities of a
particular type, and is itself a manifold with singularities. In particular,
some or all of these strata could be moduli spaces 
of SL
with isolated conical singularities, as in §5.
Let 
be a moduli space of compact, nonsingular SL

a moduli space of singular SL

Following [22, §8.3],
we (loosely) define the index of the singularities of X to be
provided 
is smooth near X. Note that ind(X)
depends on N as well as X.
In [22, Theorem 8.10] we use the results of [19, 20, 21] to compute
ind(X) when X is transverse with conical singularities, in the sense of
Definition 5.4. Here is a simplified version of the result, where we as-
sume that

If the cones 
are not rigid, for instance if 
is not connected,
then (23) should be corrected, as in [22, §8.3]. If Conjecture 5.6 is true
then for a generic Kähler form 
all compact SL 
X with conical
singularities are transverse, and so Theorem 8.2 and [22, Theorem 8.10]
allow us to calculate ind(X).
Now singularities with small index are the most commonly occur-
ring, and so arguably the most interesting kinds of singularity. Also, as
for various problems, such as those in §8.3 and §8.4,
it will only be necessary to know about singularities with index up to a
certain value. This motivates the following:
Problem 8.3. Classify types of singularities of SL 3-folds with small
index in suitably generic almost Calabi–Yau 3-folds, say with index 1, 2
or 3.
Here we restrict to
 to make the problem more feasible, though
still difficult. Note, however, that we do not restrict to isolated conical
singularities, so a complete, rigorous answer would require a theory of
more general kinds of singularities of SL 3-folds.
One can make some progress on this problem simply by studying the
many examples of singular SL 3-folds in [3, 4] and [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17], calculating or guessing the index of each, and ruling out
other kinds of singularities by plausible-sounding arguments. Using these
techniques I have a conjectural classification of index 1 singularities of SL
3-folds, which involves the SL 
of (7), and several different
kinds of singularity whose tangent cone is two copies of 
intersecting
in 0, 
or
Coming from another direction, integrable systems techniques may
yield rigorous classification results for SL 
by index. Haskins
[5, Theorem A] has used them to prove that the SL 
in
of (7) is up to SU(3) equivalence the unique SL 
C with
Now the index of a singularity modelled on C is at least
so this implies that 
is the unique SL 
with
index 1 in Problem 8.3.

SL 
which are not ‘isolated conical singularities’ in the sense of

are some known classes of nontrivial examples when

written down very explicitly, as in [11, Theorem 7.1].
The tangent cones of such singularities, in the sense of Geomet-
ric Measure Theory, are generally

the singular point, the SL 3-fold resembles a

Using analytic techniques, we construct and study solutions
of (24) satisfying boundary conditions on a strictly convex domain
S. These include many singular solutions, and we show in [16,
§9–§10] that we can construct countably many distinct geometrical-
topological types of isolated SL 3-fold singularities, whose tangent
cone is the union of two

There appear to the author to be two ways of studying special La-
grangian singularities which are not isolated conical. The first is to try
and study all singularities of special Lagrangian integral currents, using
Geometric Measure Theory. As far as the author understands (which
is not very far), it will be difficult to use the special Lagrangian con-
dition in GMT, or to say anything nontrivial about special Lagrangian
singularities in this generality.
The second way is to define some restricted class of singularities
and then study them, just as we did in §3–§7.  The problem here is
to decide upon a suitable kind of local model for the singularities, and
appropriate asymptotic conditions for how the SL 
approaches the

local model near the singularity. Now not just any local model and
asymptotic conditions will do.
For a class of singularities to be worth studying, they should occur
fairly often in “real life,” so that, for instance, examples of such singular-
ities might occur in compact SL 
in fairly generic almost Calabi-
Yau 
A good test of this is whether the deformation theory of
compact SL 
with this kind of singularity is well-behaved. That
is, the analogue of Theorem 5.2 should hold, with finite-dimensional
obstruction space
One very obvious way to make examples of SL
with noniso-
lated singularities is to consider 
in 
where
C is an SL cone in 
with isolated singularity at 0, and
So we could study SL 
with singularities locally modelled on
Calculations by the author indicate that the deformation
theory of such singular SL 
will be well-behaved if and only if C
is stable. Therefore we propose:
Problem 8.4. Let 
and suppose C is an SL cone in
with an isolated singularity at 0 which is stable, in the sense of Def-
inition 3.4. Study compact SL
N in almost Calabi–Yau
where the singular set S of N is a compact
submanifold of M, and N is modelled on 
in
at each singular point
Here we have not defined what we mean by ‘modelled on’. There
should be some fairly natural asymptotic condition, along the lines of
(12). Perhaps, as in Theorem 4.3, it will be equivalent to N having
tangent cone 
with multiplicity 1 at each
A related problem is to classify the possible stable C:
Problem 8.5. Classify special Lagrangian cones C in 
for
with an isolated singularity at 0 which are stable, in the sense of Defini-
tion 3.4.
As above, by Haskins [5, Theorem A] the SL 
in 
of
(7) is up to SU(3) equivalence the unique stable SL 
C in 
In
fact 
is the only example of a stable SL cone in 
for 
known
to the author.
It is conceivable that it really is the only example, so that the answer
to Problem 8.5 is 
and no others.

194
Dominic Joyce
We can also look for other interesting classes of singularities with
well-behaved deformation theory. The key is to find suitable asymptotic
conditions.
Problem 8.6. Let C be an SL cone in 
with nonisolated singu-
larity at 0, or with multiplicity 
Can you find a good, natural set
of asymptotic conditions for SL 
with isolated singularities with
tangent cone C?
One way to approach this is through examples: we find some class
of examples of singular SL 
calculate their asymptotic behavior
near their singularities, and try and abstract the important features.
For the examples in (i) above this may be easy, as they are very explicit.
But for those in (ii) above the author failed miserably to understand the
asymptotic behavior.
8.3. The SYZ Conjecture. Mirror Symmetry is a mysterious rela-
tionship between pairs of Calabi–Yau 3-folds
arising from a branch
of physics known as String Theory, and leading to some very strange and
exciting conjectures about Calabi-Yau 3-folds.
Roughly speaking, String Theorists believe that each Calabi–Yau
3-fold M has a quantization, a Super Conformal Field Theory (SCFT).
If 
have SCFT’s isomorphic under a certain simple involution of
SCFT structure, we say that 
are mirror Calabi–Yau 3-folds. One
can argue using String Theory that 
and
The mirror transform also exchanges things related to the
complex structure of M with things related to the symplectic structure
of 
and vice versa.
The SYZ Conjecture, due to Strominger, Yau and Zaslow [31] in
1996, gives a geometric explanation of Mirror Symmetry. Here is an
attempt to state it.
Conjecture 8.7  (Strominger–Yau–Zaslow). Suppose M and  
are
mirror Calabi–Yau 3-folds. Then (under some additional conditions)
there should exist a compact topological 3-manifold B and surjective,
continuous maps 
and
with fibres
and 
for 
such that
(i) There exists a dense open set 
such that for each
the fibres
are nonsingular special Lagrangian 
in M
and 
which are in some sense dual to one another.

Special Lagrangian Singularities
195
(ii) For each 
the fibres
 
are expected to be
singular special Lagrangian 3-folds in M and
We call 
special Lagrangian fibrations, and the set of singular
fibres 
is called the discriminant. It is not yet clear what the final
form of the SYZ Conjecture should be. Much work has been done on it,
working primarily with Lagrangian fibrations, by authors such as Mark
Gross and Wei-Dong Ruan. For references see [10].
The author’s approach to the SYZ Conjecture, focussing primarily
on special Lagrangian singularities, is set out in [10], and we do not
have space to discuss it here. Very briefly, we argue that for generic
(almost) Calabi–Yau 3-folds (ii) will not hold, as the discriminants
of 
cannot be homeomorphic near certain kinds of singular fibre. We
also suggest that the final form of the SYZ Conjecture should be an
asymptotic statement about 1-parameter families of Calabi-Yau 3-folds
approaching the large complex structure limit.
Problem 8.8. Study special Lagrangian fibrations
 
of
almost Calabi–Yau 3-folds 
particularly when

is generic, and 
has isolated conical singularities, then 
is
transverse. We can then use Theorem 8.2 or [22, Theorem 8.10] to
calculate 
and 
will severely restrict the possible
singular behavior.
8.4. Invariants from counting special Lagrangian homology
spheres. In [6] the author proposed to define an invariant of almost
Calabi–Yau 3-folds 
by counting special Lagrangian rational
homology 3-spheres N (which occur in 0-dimensional moduli spaces) in
a given homology class, with a certain topological weight. This invari-
ant will only be interesting if it is conserved under deformations of the
underlying almost Calabi–Yau 3-fold, or at least transforms in a rigid
way as the cohomology classes 
change.
During such a deformation, nonsingular SL 3-folds can develop sin-
gularities and disappear, or new ones appear, which might change the
invariant. In [6] the author showed that if we count rational SL homol-
ogy spheres N with weight 
then under two kinds of singular
behavior of SL 3-folds, the resulting invariant is independent of 
, and

196
Dominic Joyce
transforms according to certain rules as 
crosses real hypersurfaces
in complex structure moduli space where phases of
become equal.
Again, the ideas of §8.1 will be helpful here. It is enough for us to
study how the invariant changes along generic 1-parameter families of
almost Calabi–Yau 3-folds. The only kinds of singularities of SL homol-
ogy 3-spheres that arise in such families will have index 1. So if we can
complete the index 1 classification in Problem 8.3, we should be able to
resolve the conjectures of [6].
In fact, I now believe that interesting invariants of almost Calabi-
Yau 
by ‘counting’ SL 
can be defined for all
The definition, properties and transformation laws of these invariants
are formidably complex and difficult, even to state. The best approach
I have to them is to use Homological Mirror Symmetry to translate
the problem to the derived category 
of the Fukaya
category of
Then SL 
conjecturally correspond to stable objects of the
triangulated category
under a stability condition à la Tom Bridgeland.
The invariants are Euler characteristics of moduli spaces of configurations
in 
which are finite collections of (stable or semistable) objects and
morphisms in 
satisfying some axioms. In this set-up, using algebra and
category theory, I can rigorously develop the definition and properties of
the invariants, and their transformation rules under change of stability
condition (effectively, deformation of

Curvature Functionals, Optimal Metrics,
and the Differential Topology
of 4–Manifolds
Claude LeBrun†
SUNY at Stony Brook
New York, USA
This paper investigates the question of which smooth compact 4-mani-
folds admit Riemannian metrics that minimize the 
of the cur-
vature tensor. Metrics with this property are called optimal; Einstein
metrics and scalar-flat anti-self-dual metrics provide us with two inter-
esting classes of examples. Using twistor methods, optimal metrics of
the second type are constructed on the connected sums 
for
However, related constructions also show that large classes of simply
connected 4-manifolds do not admit any optimal metrics at all. Inter-
estingly, the difference between existence and nonexistence turns out to
delicately depend on one’s choice of smooth structure; there are smooth
4-manifolds which carry optimal metrics, but which are homeomorphic
to infinitely many distinct smooth 4-manifolds on which no optimal met-
ric exists.

1. Introduction
“Does every smooth compact manifold admit a best metric?” René
Thom allegedly first posed this naïve but fundamental question to Marcel
Berger [10] at some point in the early 1960s. By the early 1990s, it had
emerged from the world of informal discussion to find itself in print, as
the leading entry on one of S.-T. Yau’s celebrated problem lists [61].
Of course, Thorn’s question, as formulated above, seems to be less a
problem than a meta-problem; after all, we are being asked to find some
interpretation of the word “best” which will lead to an interesting conclu-
sion. Nevertheless, the question always had some unambiguous content,
because Thom had clarified his question by means of a paradigmatic ex-
ample. What he of course had in mind was the classical uniformization
theorem, which tells us that every compact 2-manifold carries metrics of
constant curvature. This paradigm moreover gives us some vital clues
concerning what we ought to look for. First, the definition of “best met-
ric” should somehow involve the Riemannian curvature, and should be
invariant under the action of the diffeomorphism group. Second, one
might hope that metrics of constant sectional curvature, when they ex-
ist, would turn out to be the “best metrics” on the manifold in question.
And third, we should not expect our “best” metric to necessarily be
absolutely unique; a finite-dimensional moduli space of “beat metrics”
would certainly be quite acceptable.
If we agree that the flat metrics are the best metrics on the
dimensional torus 
then it seems rather natural to
look for metrics on other manifolds which are “as flat as possible,” in
the sense that they minimize some norm of curvature. For example, one
might try to minimize the 
of the Riemann curvature tensor for
some fixed
However, this is simply not a sensible problem for
most choices of 
one can typically find a sequence of metrics for which
the 
norm of curvature tends to zero by just multiplying a fixed metric
by a suitable sequence of constants. Indeed, there is only one value of
for which this trick does not work: namely, 
where 
is the
dimension of the manifold.
Given a smooth compact 
M, and letting
we are thus led to consider the functional

given by
where 
denotes the Riemann curvature tensor, 
is its point-wise
norm with respect to the metric, and 
is the 
volume
measure determined by the metric. Berger [10] has suggested the minima
of 
as natural candidates for Thom’s “best metrics.” Let us codify this
proposal:
Definition 1.1. Let M be a smooth compact 
man-
ifold, 
A smooth Riemannian metric 
on M will be called an
optimal metric if it is an absolute minimizer of the functional 
in the
sense that
for every smooth Riemannian metric 
on M.
Notice that we have defined an optimal metric to be a minimum,
not just a critical point, of the functional 
This brings into play a
natural diffeomorphism invariant which is defined even in the absence of
an optimal metric:
Definition 1.2. For any smooth compact 
manifold
M, we define 
to be the nonnegative real number given by
Thus 
coincides with the number Berger [10] calls
Of course, our definitions have precisely been chosen so that any metric
on 
on M automatically satisfies
with equality iff 
is an optimal metric.
While it generally remains unclear to what extent optimal metrics
really represent an appropriate response to Thom’s question, the situ-
ation in dimension 4 is rather encouraging. In particular [10, 11], an
Einstein metric on any compact 4-manifold is optimal. However, the
converse is by no means true, and the primary purpose of this article is
to explore this aspect of the problem. Here is what will emerge:
We will construct infinitely many new examples of non-Einstein op-
timal metrics on simply connected compact 4-manifolds.

202
Claude LeBrun
We will show that there are many simply connected compact 4-
manifolds which do not admit optimal metrics.
We will see that the existence or nonexistence of optimal metrics
depends strictly on the diffeotype of a simply connected 4-manifold;
it is not determined by the homeotype alone.
We will calculate the invariant 
for many simply connected 4-
manifolds (some common-garden, others a bit more exotic).
We will show that the value of 
depends strictly on the diffeotype
of a 4-manifold. Different differentiable structures on an underlying
topological 4-manifold can often be distinguished by the fact that
the corresponding values of 
are different. However, we will also
see many examples of distinct differentiable structures which cannot
be distinguished in this way.
2. Four-Dimensional Geometry
Our investigation of optimal metrics on 4-manifolds will necessarily pre-
suppose a certain familiarity with the rudiments of 4-dimensional ge-
ometry and topology. The present section will attempt to offer a quick
introduction to some of this essential background material.
The notion of self-duality plays a fundamental role in four-dimension-
al Riemannian geometry. If 
is an oriented Riemannian 4-manifold,
the Hodge star operator
satisfies 
and so yields a decomposition
where 
is the (+1)-eigenspace of *, and
is the (–1)-eigenspace.
Both 
and 
are rank-3 vector bundles over M. Reversing the
orientation of M interchanges these two bundles.
Definition 2.1. On any smooth oriented 4-manifold, sections of
are called self-dual 2-forms, whereas sections of 
are called anti-self-
dual 2-forms.
Because the curvature of any connection is a bundle-valued 2-form,
the decomposition (1) allows one to break any curvature tensor up into
more primitive pieces. This idea has particularly important ramifications
when applied to the Riemannian curvature of the metric itself. Indeed,

Curvature, Optimal Metrics, and 4-Manifolds
203
first notice that, by raising an index, the Riemann curvature tensor may
be reinterpreted as a linear map 
called the curvature operator.
But decomposing the 2-forms according to (1) then allows us to view
this linear map as consisting of four blocks:
Here 
are the trace-free pieces of the appropriate blocks, and are
called the self-dual and anti-self-dual Weyl curvatures respectively. The
scalar curvature 
is understood to act by scalar multiplication, whereas
the trace-free Ricci curvature 
acts on 2-forms by
An important feature of the decomposition (1) is that it is confor-
mally invariant, in the sense that it is unchanged if is replaced by
where is an arbitrary smooth positive function. Similarly, the self-dual
and anti-self-dual Weyl curvatures are also conformally invariant (when
considered as sections of
Since our objective is to better understand metrics on 4-manifolds
which minimize the quadratic curvature integral
it is highly relevant that there are two other quadratic curvature inte-
grals which actually compute topological invariants. Indeed, no matter
which metric 
we choose on a smooth compact oriented 4-manifold M,
the generalized Gauss–Bonnet theorem [1] tells us that the Euler char-
acteristic is given by

204
Claude LeBrun
while the Hirzebruch signature theorem [31] tells us that the signature
is given by
Let us recall that the signature of a smooth compact 4-manifold may be
defined in terms of the intersection pairing
on de Rham cohomology. By Poincaré duality, this is a non-degenerate
pairing; and it is symmetric, since 2-forms commute with respect to the
wedge product. We may therefore find a basis for 
in which
the intersection pairing is represented by the diagonal matrix
and the numbers 
are then topological invariants of M. Their
difference
is the signature of M, whereas their sum
is just the second Betti number.
A more concrete interpretation of the numbers 
can be given
by using a bit of Hodge theory. Since every de Rham class on M has a
unique harmonic representative with respect to 
we have a canonical
identification

Curvature, Optimal Metrics, and 4-Manifolds
205
But the Hodge star operator 
defines an involution of the right-hand
side. We thus obtain a direct sum decomposition
where
are the spaces of self-dual and anti-self-dual harmonic forms. The in-
tersection form is then positive-definite on
and negative-definite on
so we have
Notice that the spaces 
only depend on the conformal class of the
metric.
One can easily construct 4-manifolds with any desired values of
and 
by means of the following construction:
Definition 2.2. Let 
and 
be smooth connected compact ori-
ented
Their connected sum 
is then the smooth connected oriented
obtained by deleting a small ball from each manifold
and identifying the resulting 
boundaries
via a reflection.

If 
and 
are simply connected 4-manifolds, then
is also simply connected, and has 
Now let
us use 
denote the complex projective plane with its standard orien-
tation, and 
denote the same smooth 4-manifold with the opposite
orientation. Then the iterated connected sum
is a simply connected 4-manifold with 
and 
Notice that
and that
These 4-manifolds are non-spin, meaning that their tangent bundles
have 
For a simply connected compact 4-manifold M, this is
equivalent to saying that M contains a compact oriented surface of odd
self-intersection.
Is this a complete list of the simply connected non-spin 4-manifolds?
Well, yes and no. In the affirmative direction, the remarkable work of
Michael Freedman [20] tells us the following:
Theorem 2.3 (Freedman). Two smooth compact simply connected
oriented 4-manifolds are orientedly homeomorphic if and only if
they have the same value of
they have the same value of 
and
both are spin, or both are non-spin.
Thus, up to homeomorphism, the connected sums 
pro-
vide us with a complete list of the simply connected non-spin 4-manifolds.
However, many of these topological 4-manifolds turn out to have infin-
itely many distinct known smooth structures, and it is generally thought
that many of these manifolds will turn out to have exotic smooth struc-
tures that no one has even yet imagined.
Freedman’s surgical techniques also allow one to classify simply con-
nected topological 4-manifolds, but the classification is much more in-
volved. One of the key ingredients that makes it possible to give Theorem
2.3 the simple phrasing used above is the main theorem of Donaldson’s
thesis [16], which showed that the anti-self-dual Yang–Mills equations
implied previously unsuspected constraints on the homotopy types of
smooth 4-manifolds:
Theorem 2.4 (Donaldson). Let M be any smooth compact simply
connected 4-manifold with 
Then M is homotopy equivalent to
or to a connected sum

Curvature, Optimal Metrics, and 4-Manifolds
207
In particular, if M is a simply connected differentiable 4-manifold
with 
and 
this result tells us that M cannot be
spin.
We have just seen that Theorem 2.3 allows us to compile a com-
plete list of simply connected non-spin homeotypes. In the spin case,
the situation remains more unsettled, but a conjectural complete list of
smoothable simply connected spin homeotypes consists of
their connect sums, and orientation reverses of these. Here K3
means the unique simply connected smooth compact 4-manifold admit-
ting a complex structure with 
This 4-manifold has 
and
An interesting model of K3 was discovered by Kummer, who
considered the involution of 
with 16 fixed points which arises as the
product of two copies of the Weierstrass involution of an elliptic curve:
Kummer’s model of K3 is then obtained from the orbifold 
by
replacing each singular point with a 
of self-intersection –2. Analo-
gous constructions will turn out to play a central role in this paper.

3. Optimal Geometries in Dimension Four
A Riemannian metric is said to be Einstein if it has constant Ricci
curvature. Since the Ricci curvature of 
is by definition the function
on the unit tangent bundle 
where 
denotes the
Ricci tensor, this is clearly equivalent to the requirement that
for some constant 
This in turn can be rewritten as the pair of condi-
tions
where 
is the scalar curvature, and where 
is the
trace-free part of the Ricci tensor. However, double contraction of the
second Bianchi identity tells us that
so, in any dimension 
a metric is Einstein iff it satisfies the equation
An important motivation for the study of optimal metrics is that
[10, 11] any Einstein metric is optimal in dimension 4. Indeed, let M
be a smooth compact 4-manifold, and let 
be an arbitrary Riemannian
metric on M. Then the 4-dimensional Gauss–Bonnet formula (3) allows
us to rewrite
as
Thus any metric 
with 
minimizes 
and when such a metric
exists, the Einstein metrics are the only optimal metrics on M.
However, similar arguments also show that smooth compact 4-mani-
folds often do not admit Einstein metrics, even in the simply connected
case. Indeed, a judicious combination of (3) with (4) reads

Curvature, Optimal Metrics, and 4-Manifolds
209
so that a compact oriented 4-manifold M can only admit an Einstein
metric if it satisfies the Hitchin–Thorpe inequality [32, 57]
Thus, for example, the simply connected 4-manifolds 
do not admit
an Einstein metric when 
since these spaces have
In the boundary case of the Hitchin–Thorpe inequality, we also get a
striking amount of additional information. Indeed, if
and M admits an Einstein metric 
then the Riemannian connection
on 
must be flat, since its curvature tensor is algebraically
determined by 
and 
such a metric is said to be locally hyper-
Kähler. Any locally hyper-Kähler 4-manifold is finitely covered [11, 32]
by a flat 4-torus or a Calabi–Yau K3. In particular, a simply connected
4-manifold with 
can admit an Einstein metric only if it is
diffeomorphic to K3. In particular, 
does not admit an Einstein
metric, since it has 
but is not even homotopy equivalent to
K3.
It should therefore seem a bit reassuring that there are many simply
connected 4-manifolds which carry optimal metrics which are not Ein-
stein [45]. To see this, we may begin by observing that (3) and (4) allow
one to re-express 
as
This brings another important class of metrics to the fore:
Definition 3.1. If M is a smooth oriented 4-manifold, a Riemann-
ian metric 
on M will be said to be anti-self-dual (or, for brevity, ASD)
if its self-dual Weyl curvature is identically zero:
A metric 
will be called scalar-flat (or, more briefly, SF) if it satisfies
Finally, we will say that 
is scalar-flat anti-self-dual (or SFASD) if it
satisfies both of these conditions.
Equation (8) then immediately yields the following:
Proposition 3.2. Suppose that M is a smooth compact oriented 4-
manifold. If M carries a scalar-flat anti-self-dual metric 
then 
is

210
Claude LeBrun
optimal. When this happens, moreover, every other optimal metric 
on
M is SFASD, too.
This fact seems to have first been noticed by Lafontaine [42], who
simultaneously discovered an important obstruction to the existence of
SFASD metrics. Indeed, equation (7) and our previous discussion of
the locally hyper-Kähler manifolds immediately gives us the following
upside-down version of the Hitchin–Thorpe inequality:
Proposition 3.3 (Lafontaine). Let 
be a compact scalar-flat
anti-self-dual 4-manifold. Then
with equality if and only if 
is finitely covered by a flat 4-torus or
a Calabi–Yau K3.
However, a completely different set of topological constraints is im-
posed by the following result [43]:
Proposition 3.4. 
Let 
be a compact scalar-flat anti-self-dual
4-manifold. Then either
or
and 
is a scalar-flat Kähler metric; or else
and 
is a hyper-Kähler metric.
PROOF.  Recall that 
is exactly the dimension of the space of
harmonic self-dual 2-forms on M. However, any self-dual 2-form 
on
any Riemannian 4-manifold satisfies the Weitzenböck formula [13]
so if 
is harmonic and if 
is SFASD we obtain
Thus, when 
is a compact SFASD manifold, 
is exactly the
dimension of the space of the parallel self-dual 2-forms.
Now SO(4) is a double cover of SO(3) × SO(3), where the factor
projections to SO(3) are given by its action on 
The subgroup of
SO(4) stabilizing a nonzero element of 
is thus the double cover U(2)
of SO(2) × SO(3), whereas the subgroup acting trivially on
or even
on a 2-dimensional subspace of it, is the universal cover

Curvature, Optimal Metrics, and 4-Manifolds
211
of SO(3). Thus an oriented Riemannian 4-manifold with a non-trivial
parallel self-dual 2-form has holonomy 
and is Kähler, whereas
the existence of 2 independent parallel self-dual 2-forms would force the
manifold to have holonomy 
and so to be hyper-Kähler.
Let us now assume that 
is a simply connected SFASD man-
ifold, and see what the above results now tell us. By Proposition 3.4,
the only possibilities for 
are 0, 1 and 3. If 
we would
have a simply connected hyper-Kähler manifold; such an object is nec-
essarily a K3 surface. If 
we have a simply connected complex
surface with nontrivial canonical line bundle and a Kähler metric of zero
scalar curvature; by a plurigenus vanishing theorem of Yau [59] and the
Enriques–Kodaira classification [7], such a complex surface must be ob-
tained from 
by blowing up and down, and hence diffeomorphic to
either 
or a connected sum 
and since Proposition
3.3 tells us that 
is negative, we
conclude in this case that M is diffeomorphic to 
for some
Finally, if 
Theorems 2.4 and 2.3 tell us that M is at least
homeomorphic to either 
or a connected sum 
and since Propo-
sition 3.3 tells us that 
is negative, we conclude in this
case that M is homeomorphic to 
for some 
Summarizing,
we have [43]
Proposition 3.5. Let M be a smooth compact simply connected 4-
manifold. If M admits a scalar-flat anti-self-dual metric 
then
M is homeomorphic to 
for some 
or
M is diffeomorphic to 
for some        or else
M is diffeomorphic to K3.
A major objective of this paper is to prove the following partial converse:
Theorem A. A simply connected 4-manifold M admits scalar-flat
anti-self-dual metrics if
M is diffeomorphic to 
for some 
or
M is diffeomorphic to
for some 
or
M is diffeomorphic to K3.
In particular, each of these manifolds carries optimal metrics.
It is worth emphasizing that, except in the K3 case, the optimal
metrics of Theorem A are necessarily non-Einstein.

212
Claude LeBrun
On the other hand, Corollary 3.5 and a computation of
will allow
us to show that the existence of optimal metrics is highly sensitive to
the choice of smooth structure:
Theorem B. For each 
the topological manifold
admits infinitely many “exotic” smooth structures for which the corre-
sponding smooth compact 4-manifold does not admit optimal metrics.
Similarly, the topological manifold K3 admits infinitely many exotic
smooth structures for which the corresponding smooth 4-manifold does
not admit optimal metrics.
Similar ideas will also allow us to prove the nonexistence of optimal
metrics for smooth manifolds representing many more homeotypes:
Theorem C.
If 
and 
the smooth simply connected
4-manifold
does not admit optimal metrics. Moreover, if
and 
mod 8, the underlying topological manifold of this space
admits infinitely many distinct differentiable structures for which no op-
timal metric exists.
4. Constructing Anti-Self-Dual Metrics
The condition of anti-self-duality is conformally invariant; if 
is an
ASD metric, so is 
for any 
The strategy of our proof of
Theorem A will be to first construct a family of anti-self-dual conformal
classes of metrics on 
and then show that some of the
constructed conformal classes contain scalar-flat metrics. Our approach
to both aspects of this problem will be carried out using methods of
complex analysis via the Penrose twistor correspondence, to which we
now provide a brief introduction.
Given any oriented Riemannian 4-manifold
one can construct
an associated almost-complex 6-manifold (Z, J), where 
is
the 
of unit self-dual 2-forms. The almost-complex
structure 
preserves the decomposition of TZ into hori-
zontal and vertical components with respect to the Levi–Civita connec-
tion. On the tangent spaces of each fiber
J simply acts by rotation
by –90°. Meanwhile, in the horizontal sub-bundle, which we identify
with 
J acts at 
by
Each fiber
of
is thus a J-holomorphic curve, and the fiber-wise antipo-
dal map 
is J-anti-holomorphic, in the sense that

Curvature, Optimal Metrics, and 4-Manifolds
213
A remarkable and non-obvious feature of this con-
struction is that the almost-complex structure J is actually conformally
invariant, despite the fact that replacing 
with 
alters the horizon-
tal subspaces on 
Now recall that an almost-complex
manifold is a complex manifold iff it admits sufficiently many local holo-
morphic functions. In general, the obstruction [52] to the existence of
such functions is the Nijenhuis tensor, but in the present case the Nijen-
huis tensor of (Z, J) just amounts to the self-dual Weyl curvature 
of
When 
is anti-self-dual, (Z, J) thus acquires the structure
of a complex manifold [4, 53]:
Theorem 4.1 (Penrose/Atiyah–Hitchin–Singer). The almost-com-
plex manifold (Z, J) is a complex 3-manifold iff 
Moreover,
a complex 3-manifold arises by this construction iff it admits a fixed-
point-free anti-holomorphic involution 
and a foliation by
rational curves 
each of which has normal bundle
Finally, the complex manifold (Z, J) and the real structure a
suffice to determine the metric 
on M up to conformal rescaling.
Definition 4.2. The complex 3-manifold (Z, J) associated with an
anti-self-dual 4-manifold
by Theorem 4.1 is called the twistor
space of
Definition 4.3. 
Let 
be an anti-self-dual 4-manifold, and let
(Z, J) be its twistor space, and let 
Then the holomorphic curve
given by 
will be called the real twistor line
corresponding to
The moduli space of holomorphic curves 
near the real
twistor lines is a complex 4-manifold 
and is a complexification of
the original real 4-manifold M . The term complex twistor line (or just
twistor line) is used to refer to any 
in this larger family.
One of the cornerstones of the theory of anti-self-dual manifolds is
the connected sum construction of Donaldson and Friedman [15]. If
and 
admit anti-self-dual metrics, this allows one to construct anti-
self-dual metrics on the connected sum 
provided the twistor
spaces 
and 
of the given manifolds satisfy
An orbifold generalization of this construction was later developed
by the present author in collaboration with Michael Singer [48], and
allows one to build up nonsingular anti-self-dual manifolds by gluing
special orbifolds across 
necks. We will now review those features
of this generalized construction which will be needed in what follows.

214
Claude LeBrun
Let 
be a compact anti-self-dual manifold with twistor space
Z, and let us assume from the outset that 
Let
be an isometry of

fixed points, for some positive integer 
Each fixed
point is therefore isolated, and in geodesic normal coordinates around
any fixed point, 
therefore just becomes the involution 
of
in particular, 
is orientation-preserving. We thus have an induced map
and this map may be viewed as a holomorphic
involution 
The fixed point set of 
then consists of a disjoint
union of 
real twistor lines, one for each fixed point of 
Let 
be
obtained by blowing up Z along these 
twistor lines, and notice that
induces a holomorphic involution 
of 
The fixed point set of
then consists of 
quadrics 
with normal bundle
and the 
acts on their normal bundles by multiplication by –1. The
quotient 
is therefore a nonsingular compact complex 3-fold con-
taining 
hypersurfaces 
each biholomorphic to
and each with normal bundle 
The complement of these hy-
persurfaces is just the twistor space of 
In this
complement, choose 
twistor lines, and blow them up to obtain
hypersurfaces 
each biholomorphic to 
and
each with normal bundle 
Let 
denote this blow-up of
and notice that our original anti-holomorphic involution 
of Z induces
an anti-holomorphic involution
The next ingredient we will need is a compactification of the twistor
space of the Eguchi–Hanson metric. The usual Eguchi–Hanson metric
[19] is a locally asymptotically flat hyper-Kähler metric on
which,
up to homothety, is the metric-space completion of the Riemannian met-
ric
on 
where 
is the standard left-invariant co-frame on
However, because this metric is asymptotic to the flat
metric on 
as 
its conformal class naturally extends
to an orbifold ASD conformal metric on 
where the added
point is singular, with a neighborhood modeled on 
Blowing up
the twistor line of this added “point at infinity” then yields a nonsingular
complex 3-fold 
which contains a hypersurface 
with
normal bundle 
arising as the exceptional divisor of the blow-up.

Curvature, Optimal Metrics, and 4-Manifolds
215
The complex 3-fold 
is [48] a small resolution of the hypersurface
in the 
over 
where
and 
are the homogeneous coordinates on 
The small
resolutions replace the two singular points
with rational
curves.
Finally, consider the Fubini–Study metric on 
which, up to
homothety, may be characterized as the unique SU(3)-invariant met-
ric on the complex projective plane. Because the isotropy subgroup
is so large, the Fubini–Study metric has 
for
representation-theoretic reasons; reversing the orientation, the Fubini–
Study metric thus becomes an ASD metric on 
Let 
denote the
twistor space of this metric, and let 
denote its blow-up along a real
twistor line. Explicitly, 
may be realized [4] as
and we may take the relevant twistor line to be given by
Blowing up of this twistor line provides us with a preferred hypersurface
with normal bundle
Now let 
be the disjoint union of 
copies of 
and 
copies
of 
and let 
be the real structure it inherits from the twistor
spaces of the Eguchi–Hanson and Fubini–Study metrics. Let
be the disjoint union of 
copies of

copy of the constructed exceptional divisor in a copy of

Remembering that 
also contains a disjoint union
of the same number of copies of 
we may thus form a 3-
dimensional complex-analytic space 
with normal crossing singularities
by identifying 
with 
However, we carry out this identification
according to a few simple rules. First of all, the quadrics 
are
each to be identified with a quadric in a copy of

quadrics
are each to be identified with a quadric in a copy
of 
Secondly, we always interchange the factors of

identifications in such a way that the real structures

theory [21] then yields a versal deformation of

neighborhood of the origin in 
The generic fiber of this
family is nonsingular
and the real structure 
extends to act on the total space of this family.
Rather than working with the entire versal family, it is convenient to
restrict ones attention to certain subfamilies, called standard deforma-
tions. A 1-parameter standard deformation of

is a conformally invariant differential operator when viewed as a map
between sections of suitable real line bundles; the geometric reason for
this is that for any smooth function

on

One useful consequence of this is that, for any
smooth function

Green’s function of
Now the celebrated proof of the Yamabe conjecture [49] t ells us
that any conformal class on any compact manifold contains metrics of
constant scalar curvature. In particular, any conformal class contains
metrics whose scalar curvature has the same sign at every point. But
actually, this last assertion is much more elementary. Indeed, if
is an eigenfunction corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue 
of the
Yamabe Laplacian, then 
has empty nodal set, and 
is therefore a
conformally related metric whose scalar curvature has the same sign as
everywhere on M. Similar considerations also show that if two metrics

Curvature, Optimal Metrics, and 4-Manifolds
219
with scalar curvatures of fixed signs are conformally related, then their
scalar curvatures have the same sign. The sign of Yamabe constant of
a conformal class, meaning the sign of the constant scalar curvature of
the metric produced by the proof of the Yamabe conjecture, therefore
coincides with the sign of the smallest Yamabe eigenvalue 
for any
metric in the conformal class.
Here is another way of determining the sign of the Yamabe constant:
Lemma 5.1. Let 
be a compact Riemannian 4-manifold whose
Yamabe Laplacian 
has trivial kernel. Let 
be any point.
Then the conformal class 
contains a metric of positive scalar curva-
ture if and only if 
for all 
Moreover, if
contains a metric of negative scalar curvature, then 
for some
These assertions also hold for any finite sum 
or
for any other finite linear combinations of conformal Green’s functions
with positive coefficients.
PROOF. Since the Yamabe Laplacian is conformally invariant when
viewed as acting on functions of the appropriate conformal weight, we
may assume from the outset that either 
everywhere, or else
everywhere.
Now notice that
Thus, if 
must be negative somewhere, and since

the Green’s function must also have a zero by continuity. Notice that
the same argument works for any finite linear combinations of Green’s
functions with positive coefficients.

Now suppose that

manifold, and let Z be its twistor space. If

What is this mysterious coho-
mology class? The answer was discovered by Atiyah [3], and involves a
construction largely due to Serre [56] and Horrocks [34]:

 the Bockstein map of this long exact
sequence therefore gives us an isomorphism
In particular, any choice of isomorphism
gives us an exten-

of sheaves on W. The class of this extension is called the Serre class
and its restriction to W – V is an element
of 
Strictly speaking, the Serre class depends on
a choice of isomorphism

out to be exactly
Combining this remarkable result with Lemma 5.1 now gives us a
twistorial criterion for determining whether an anti-self-dual conformal
class has positive Yamabe constant:
Proposition 5.4. Let Z be the twistor space of a compact anti-self-
dual 4-manifold

be a real twistor line. Then

by construction, the result now follows from
lemma 5.1 and Proposition 5.3.
6. The Sign of the Scalar Curvature
We are now ready to approach the problem of determining the sign of
the Yamabe constant for the anti-self-dual conformal classes constructed
in Theorem 4.4. The results obtained in this section are loosely inspired
by the work of Dominic Joyce [37] on the Yamabe constants of certain
conformal classes on connect sums, although the techniques employed
here are completely different from Joyce’s.
Lemma 6.1. Let 
be a 1-parameter standard deforma-
tion of 
where 
is as in Theorem 4.4, and 
is an open disk
about the origin. Let 
be the union of the Eguchi–Hanson compo-
nents of 
which is a nonsingular complex hypersurface in
and let 
denotes its ideal sheaf. 
Then the invertible sheaf
has a square-root as a holomorphic line bundle.
PROOF. A holomorphic line bundle has a holomorphic square-root
iff its second Stieffel–Whitney class 
vanishes. Write
as 
where U is a tubular neighborhood of 
V is a tubular
neighborhood of 
and 
is a tubular neighborhood of Q, so that
these open sets deform retract to 
and Q respectively. Since each
component of Q is simply connected, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence
therefore tells us that it is enough to check that the restrictions of our
line bundle to 
and 
both have square-roots.

224
Claude LeBrun
It thus suffices to produce an explicit square-root of the restrictions
of 
to each copy of 
each copy of 
and to 
On
each copy of 
such a square-root is given by 
where [Q]
is the divisor of the exceptional quadric, and where 
is the pull-back
of 
from the twistor space 
via the blowing-down map. On each
copy of 
such a square-root is given by the pull-back of 
via
the projection 
And on 
there is a natural choice of
square-root whose sections are the 
invariant sections of 
pulled-
back to the blow-up 
twisted by the divisors 
That
each of these bundles really has the correct square can be verified directly
using the adjunction formula; the details are left as an exercise for the
interested reader.

be a 1-parameter standard deforma-
tion of

ponents of

quence tells us that it would suffice to show that the direct image sheaves

small
the conformal class
contains a metric of negative scalar
curvature.
The positive case is similar, but is slightly more delicate. Instead
of just restricting 
on rational curves in 
we must also con-
sider what happens when we restrict this class to twistor lines in
However, we already saw in the proof of Lemma 6.2, an element of
or 
is non-zero iff its restric-
tion to the corresponding exceptional quadric is non-zero, and this has
the effect that the restriction of the cohomology class to every twistor
line in either of these spaces is non-zero if there is a rational curve in
the quadric on which the class is non-zero. Thus, when the conformal
Green’s function
of 
is positive, the vector bundle E determined
by 
has splitting type 
on all the 
rational
curves in 
which are limits of real twistor lines in

It
therefore has the same splitting type on all the real twistor lines of

dual manifold with

the
conformal class 
contains a metric of positive scalar curvature.
In this positive case, it is interesting to re-examine the above con-
struction in purely Riemannian terms. In this setting, the positivity
of the Green’s functions allows us to define a family of asymptotically
flat, scalar-flat, anti-self-dual metrics 
on
What the above construction tells us is that these metrics converge, in
the pointed Gromov–Hausdorff sense [29], to the orbifold metric
on 
However, there is something else going on in certain regions,
where viewing these metrics under higher and higher magnification re-
sults in a family that converges to the Eguchi–Hanson metric or to the
Burns metric, meaning the Green’s function rescaling of the Fubini–

It is the appearance of the ideal sheaves
in the definition of L* which accounts for the fact that these seemingly
incompatible pictures simultaneously apply at wildly different length-
scales.
7. Conformally Flat Orbifolds
Consider the involution of 
given by
This involution has only four fixed points, namely

Curvature, Optimal Metrics, and 4-Manifolds
227
and near each of these isolated fixed points, the involution necessarily
looks exactly like reflection through the origin in 
We can therefore
construct an involution of the connected sum 
by
cutting out a ball centered at a fixed point of the involution of each
copy of 
and then being careful to carry out the usual gluing
procedure in a 
manner. The resulting involution
then has exactly 6 fixed points, and may usefully be thought of as a
4-dimensional analog of the hyperelliptic involution
of a Riemann surface of genus 2.
In this section, we will be interested in conformally flat orbifold
metrics on 
or in other words, in
conformally flat metrics on 
The key
result we will need is the following:
Proposition 7.1. There is a real-analytic family 
of
Riemannian metrics on 
with the following proper-
ties:
for each 
the metric 
is locally conformally flat;
for each 
the involution 
is an isometry of

of

when 
is sufficiently close to 0, 
has
when 
is sufficiently close to 1, 
has
the set of

is discrete; and
there are only finitely many values of for which 
has
Consequently, there is a 
and an 
such that, for all
the scalar curvature of 
has the same sign as
and such that the Yamabe Laplacian 
has trivial kernel for all
Our proof of the existence of such a family hinges on a result of
Schoen and Yau [55], and the construction used here is analogous to
related constructions of Kim [39] and Nayatani [51]. Let us begin by

observing that 
can be obtained from 
by deleting
four balls, and identifying the resulting boundary spheres in pairs via
reflections. Now think of

of radius 
and we henceforth stipulate that 
so as to guarantee
that the closures of these four balls are pairwise disjoint. We may then
think of

via the reflection 
and identifying 
with
via the reflection
Since the reflections that we have used to identify the boundary com-
ponents in pairs are just the restrictions to the relevant spheres of the
global conformal transformations
of 
we may therefore define a unique flat conformal metric
on 
by restricting the standard conformal metric
on 
to

act on two
separate copies of
minus  two balls, each with its boundary components
identified via reflections, and then forming the 
connected
sum of these manifolds; but each of these two building blocks looks like

so
the claim follows.
So far, we have only constructed a family 
of 
flat
conformal classes, but we next need to worry about how nicely these
conformal structures vary with

they are real-analytic in

is a
real-analytic family of 
metrics representing the constructed
conformal classes

ture is of a fixed sign for each
But what is the sign of the scalar curvature? To answer this, first
observe that, for each

In other
words,

is the region of discontinuity of the Kleinian group
generated by
These Kleinian groups are of the special type known as Schottky groups
[50]. Henceforth, 
is to be understood as a fundamental domain for
the corresponding group action.
The complement 
of the region of discontinuity is called
the limit set of the group action. If we think of 
as the boundary of
the 5-disk, on whose interior 
acts by isometries
of the hyperbolic metric, then the limit set may also be characterized
as the accumulation points of the orbit of any point in the open 5-
ball. Since we have arranged for each of our subgroups of
to actually lie in 
it follows that we
have 
This will later allow us to use planar diagrams
to understand the structure of the limit set.
For our purposes, the ultimate utility of the Kleinian point of view
stems from a remarkable result of Schoen and Yau [55] that relates the
scalar curvature of a uniformized conformally flat manifold to the size
of the corresponding limit set. The form of this result we will use is
actually a slight refinement due to Nayatani [51]:
Lemma 7.2 (Schoen–Yau, Nayatani). Let
be a compact, lo-
cally conformally flat
which can be uniformized as
where
is a Kleinian group and where 
is the
region of discontinuity of G. Let 
be a metric on M in the fixed
conformal class for which the scalar curvature 
does not change sign.
Assume that the limit set 
of G is infinite, and let 
denotes

its Hausdorff dimension. Then
The original argument given by Schoen and Yau is rather indirect,
but Nayatani’s proof actually constructs a particular metric for which
the scalar curvature does not change sign; his conformal factor is ob-
tained by convolving an appropriate power of the Euclidean distance
with the Patterson–Sullivan measure of the limit set. Because this con-
struction is so natural and canonical, it might seem tempting to simply
use Nayatani’s algorithm to define our family of metrics 
We have
avoided doing so here, however, in order avoid the technical problem of
proving that these metrics depend analytically on the parameter
To prove Proposition 7.1, we now proceed by showing that
1 for close to 0, and that 
for close to 1.
Since the region of discontinuity 
is the union of all translates of
the limit set 
may be thought of as the intersection of a nested
sequence of balls in
where each of our original four balls contains
the reflections of the other three, each of these in turn contains another
three, and so forth. However, we have also observed that
so the limit set may instead be thought of as the generalized Cantor
set in 
given by the intersection of a nested sequence of disks, where,
in passing from one level to the next, each disk is replaced by three
smaller ones. Now the two generators of our Schottky group both have
derivatives satisfying
Since the disks at the 
level of the nesting are obtained by applying
compositions of 
generators to one of the original 4 disks, this implies
that the the disks at the 
level have Euclidean radius
There
are 
of these,

so the 
Hausdorff measure of 
is less than a constant
times 
for all
and vanishes if
It therefore
follows that
In particular, 
for all

our
conformally flat metrics
will have 
The interested
reader may enjoy the exercise of constructing explicit choices of

is extremely small, and comparing the results obtainable
in this way with the predictions of the above limit-set argument.
Next, we need to show that 
when 
is sufficiently close
to 1. To see this, first consider the Kleinian group
generated by
which is the limiting case of our construction that arises by naïvely set-
ting 
We can still construct a fundamental domain D domain for
this action as the complement of four balls, but certain pairs our four
balls in 
will now have a boundary point in common. The correspond-
ing system of nested disks in
then contains two ‘bracelets’ of disks
arranged around a pair of circles in the plane:

Curvature, Optimal Metrics, and 4-Manifolds
233
As one passes from one level of the nesting to the next, both of these
circles continue to be completely covered by bracelets of smaller and
smaller disks. Hence these two circles are both contained in the limit
set of G. But, by a result of Bishop and Jones [12], this implies that
the Hausdorff dimension of the corresponding limit set must be strictly
greater than one:
Lemma 7.3 (Bishop–Jones). Let
be a finitely gen-
erated Kleinian group with infinite limit set 
If 
is not to-
tally disconnected, then either 
is a single geometric circle, or else
Now, to clinch the argument, we would like to somehow use this to
estimate the Hausdorff dimension of 
as 
A second general result
of Bishop and Jones [12] provides the machinery needed to do this:
Lemma 7.4 (Bishop–Jones). Let
be a finitely gen-
erated Kleinian group, and suppose that G is the limit of subgroups
in the sense of convergence of a set of generators. If
is the
limit set of G, and if
is the limit sets of

To wrap up our proof of Proposition 7.1, it just remains to show
that

defined by
is consequently finite. In principle this could again be done by appealing
to the perturbation theory of the spectrum of the Yamabe Laplacian,
but, just for fun, let us give a twistorial proof, in the spirit of §5. Indeed,
the Penrose transform tells us that we can re-express (10) as
where

identifications using the two biholomorphisms given by the

Since

this shows that the set B defined by (10) is discrete. The compact set
defined by (11) is thus finite, as claimed.
It follows that the element of A defined by

For 
in this neighborhood, the scalar curva ture

8. A Vanishing Theorem
At this point, we have constructed an interesting family of locally con-
formally flat metrics on the orbifold 
where
However, our aim is to eventually smooth the orbifold singularities of
these metrics in order to produce a similar family of anti-self-dual met-
rics on a simply connected manifold. To carry this out, we will need
to know that the Kodaira–Spencer deformation theory is unobstruct-
ed for the corresponding family of twistor spaces. In fact, the relevant
vanishing theorem easily follows from a decade-old unpublished paper
of Eastwood and Singer [18], whose beautiful ideas will be given a self-
contained exposition in this section.
Let 
be an oriented, locally conformally flat Riemannian 4-
manifold, and let 
denote the complete presheaf of conformal Killing
fields on

the 
sections of a given vector bundle. Now observe that there is
a rank-15 vector bundle
equipped with a flat connection
such that 
is the sheaf of parallel sections of 
Indeed, if
is any simply connected open set, then we can conformally immerse U
onto an open subset of 
by means of the developing map [41], and
is thereby identified with the 15-dimensional space 
of global
conformal Killing fields on the round 4-sphere 
As we pass from
one such choice of U to another, these identifications will be related to
one another by elements of 
acting on 
via the adjoint
representation. These elements of 
are exactly the transition
of functions of F, relative to a collection of local trivializations of F in
which the flat connection 
has vanishing connection 1-forms.
Now we could certainly construct a fine resolution of 
by just con-
sidering the F-valued differential forms on Y, but this would involve
using vector bundles of rather high rank. A more efficient resolution was
first discovered by Gasqui and Goldschmidt [24] using Spencer cohomol-
ogy, and later rediscovered by Eastwood and Rice [17] in the setting of
Bernstein–Gelfand–Gelfand resolutions. This resolution takes the form

where 
indicates the trace-free symmetric-tensor-product of a vector
bundle with itself. Here 
is the first-order operator
which measures the way the conformal class 
is distorted by the flow
of a given vector field. The next step in the sequence is the linearization
of the Weyl curvature tensor; and for our purposes, it will
be important to recognize this second-order differential operator can be
decomposed as 
where the operators
are the linearizations
of the self-dual and anti-self-dual Weyl curvatures. The next step is
again a second-order operator, and is given by
The sequence then culminates with the first-order operator
Clearly, all of these operators are conformally invariant, provided that
each bundle in the complex is given the correct conformal weight.
Since each of the sheaves in the Gasqui–Goldschmidt resolution is
fine, and hence acyclic, the abstract de Rham theorem [58] immediately
tells us that the sheaf cohomology of Y with coefficients in 
is exactly
the cohomology of the corresponding complex of global sections:
However, the Gasqui–Goldschmidt resolution is also an elliptic complex;
thus, provided Y is compact, we have [25]
by a generalized form of the Hodge theorem. Since
this immediately gives us the following result:

unions of 3-spheres, while U is homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of 3-
spheres. In particular, each of these sets is a disjoint union of simply
connected spaces. Since

in a manner which is compatible with the involution. Thus X can be

Now this by no means represents the first construction ever of SFASD
metrics on simply connected compact 4-manifolds.
However, all the
previous results depended on an essentially different idea: namely, that
any Kähler metric on a complex surface with 
is SFASD. Through
this observation, Yau’s existence theorem for Ricci-flat Kähler metrics on
K3 surfaces [60] provided a crucial early family of examples which largely
drove the subsequent development of the entire subject. Much later, the
present author and his collaborators showed [40] that 
admits
scalar-flat anti-self-dual metrics if 
The proof of this last result
depends on a refinement of Theorem 4.4, set up so that the constructed
twistor spaces carries a special divisor whose existence implies that the

ASD conformal class contains a Kähler metric. For a related re-proof of
the existence of Calabi–Yau metrics on K3, see [48].
Putting these previous results together with Corollary 9.2, we have
thus proved Theorem A:

In particular, each of these simply connected compact 4-manifolds admits
optimal metrics; and any optimal metric on any one of them is SFASD.
10. Nonexistence Results
We have now seen that many simply connected 4-manifolds admit non-
Einstein optimal metrics. However, related ideas will now allow us to
show there are also many simply connected 4-manifolds which do not
admit optimal metrics. To see this, we begin by introducing a new
concept:
Definition 10.1. Let M be a smooth compact oriented 4-dimension-
al manifold (respectively, orbifold). We will say that M admits an
anorexic sequence if there is a sequence 
of smooth Riemannian met-
rics (respectively, orbifold metrics) on M for which 
and
When a manifold admits such a sequence, we then know the value of
and stand a very good chance of determining whether it admits
an optimal metric:
Lemma 10.2. Let M be a smooth compact oriented 4-manifold which
admits an anorexic sequence. Then any optimal metric on M is SFASD.
Moreover,
PROOF. Recall that equation (8) tells us that

242
Claude LeBrun
If there is an anorexic sequence, the infimum of the right-hand side is
thus obtained by dropping the curvature integral. Moreover, a metric
minimizing 
would necessarily have 
and
Now imagine a curvaceous young 4-manifold who, bedazzled by the
glamorous starlets with optimal metrics she has been reading about in
the tabloids, suddenly decides to go on a starvation diet to get rid of all
that unwanted curvature. If she has the wrong body type, this misguided
procedure will be dangerous to her health, and she will merely succeed
in putting herself in the hospital:
Proposition 10.3. Let M be a smooth compact oriented 4-manifold
which admits an anorexic sequence. Then M does not admit an optimal
metric if
or
or
and M is not diffeomorphic to K3; or
and M is not diffeomorphic to
for some
PROOF. By Lemma 10.2, an optimal metric on such an M would
necessarily be SFASD. However, Propositions 3.4 and 3.5 show that we
would then obtain a contradiction in any of the scenarios considered
above.
Now we come to our main method of construction [46]:
Lemma 10.4. Let X be an oriented compact 4-dimensional orbifold
with only isolated singularities modeled on 
Let 
be the smooth
oriented 4-manifold obtained by replacing each singular point by a 2-
sphere of self-intersection –2. If X admits an anorexic sequence, then
so does 
Moreover, if there is an anorexic sequence on X with the
property that 
then 
also admits an anorexic sequence
with this property.
PROOF. If

would like to delete a ball of small radius

Thus we can choose a sequence of

the transition annuli 
while the volumes of these annuli
simultaneously tend to zero. For 
far out in the sequence, the tran-
sition annulus therefore makes a contribution to

the only possible source of increase of

comes from the transition annuli, which already have under
control, and so we have succeeded in producing a metric 
on 
with all
the claimed properties.
Here is a simple application of this Lemma:

metrics on

arbitrarily small volume; thus we obtain an anorexic sequence of such
metrics by taking any sequence 
The 4-manifold 
obtained from
X by replacing its orbifold singularities with 2-spheres of self-intersection
–2 therefore also admits anorexic sequences by Lemma 10.4. But X =
V#V, where 
and so 
However, as we already
noted in the proof of Proposition 9.1, 
and so
We thus obtain our first nonexistence result:
Proposition 10.6. The 4-manifold 
does not admit optimal
metrics.
PROOF. By Lemmas 10.2 and 10.5, an optimal metric on
would have to be SFASD. However, 
so Propo-
sition 3.3 would imply that any SFASD metric on the simply connected
4-manifold 
would be hyper-Kähler.
But such a metric would entail the existence of non-trivial self-dual
harmonic 2-forms, which is excluded here, since

A rather more important application of 10.4 is the following:
Lemma 10.7. The 4-manifold
admits an anorexic se-
quence.
PROOF. Consider the involution of 
which is obtained as
the product of a 180° rotation of 
around an axis and the Weierstrass
involution of an elliptic curve:
This involution has exactly 8 fixed points. Let 
be the manifold which
desingularizes the orbifold 
by replacing each of the
resulting eight singular points with an 
of self-intersection –2.
Now it is easy to see that 
admits sequences of metrics with
bounded sectional curvature, but with volume tending to zero: namely,
equip 
with a sequence of flat metrics of smaller and smaller area,
and take the Riemannian product of these metrics with the standard
round metric on 
Moreover, the metrics given by this explicit recipe
are all 
and so give rise to a sequence of orbifold metrics
on 
with bounded sectional curvature for which the total
volume tends to zero. Such a sequence is anorexic, and also has the
special property that 
By Lemma 10.4, 
therefore also
admits such a special anorexic sequence.
It only remains to show that

be diffeomorphic to either

Working with one’s bare hands [46], it is
not difficult to show that, with the fixed complex structure used above,
is precisely the complex surface obtained by iteratively blowing up
at a configuration of points arranged as in the following diagram,
in which a pair of adjacent points on a line means that one is to blow
up the first point, and then blow up the resulting exceptional divisor at
the point corresponding to the direction of the line, while the adjacent
triple of points on a line has an analogous interpretation:
If we think of the right-hand line as the line at infinity, the horizontal
line as the

not admit optimal metrics.
PROOF. Lemma 10.7 allows us to apply the last clause of Proposi-
tion 10.3.
To build more complicated examples, first consider the wormhole
space obtained by equipping 
with the metric
Because 
is a harmonic function, this conformally flat metric is
scalar-flat. However, rewriting this metric in polar coordinates as

Thus:

As the length-scale parameter tends to zero,

therefore gives us the following result:

manifold which admits an anorexic sequence. Then

We now prove the first part of Theorem C:

metric on V with local product metrics on 
and
The result is a Riemannian submersion orbifold metric on V. If we now
scale down the fiber E with keeping the metric on our orbifold 
fixed,
the result is therefore a family of metrics on 
with volume tending
to zero while the curvature remains uniformly bounded [14, 46]. In
particular, this is an anorexic sequence on 
and Lemma 10.4 tells
us that the complex surface
obtain by replacing each of the 8 orb-
ifold singularities of 
by (–2)-curves also admits anorexic sequences;
moreover, the manifolds 
all admit anorexic sequences, too,
as a consequence of Lemma 10.10. However, the manifolds 
are the
so-called Dolgachev surfaces. These Dolgachev surfaces are all homeo-
morphic to 
but Donaldson or Seiberg–Witten invariants can
be used [22] to show that no two of them are diffeomorphic. Moreover,
the corresponding smooth structures on the blow-ups remain distinct,
no matter how many times we blow up, and these smooth structures are
moreover all distinct from the standard one on 
By Propo-
sition 10.3, it follows that none of these smooth manifolds admits an
optimal metric, even though 
does admit optimal metrics for
The story is similar for homotopy K3 surfaces. Namely, we can
view 
as an orbifold elliptic fibration over 
and so mod-
ify it by logarithmic transforms of odd order at one fiber. The result-
ing orbifolds 
then admit anorexic sequences as before, as do the 4-
manifolds 
obtained by replacing their singular points by 2-spheres of
self-intersection –2. These manifolds are homeomorphic to K3 surfaces,
but as smooth manifolds they are distinct, not only from K3, but also
from each other. Proposition 10.3 thus tells us that none of them admits
optimal metrics, even though they are homeomorphic to K3, which does
admit optimal metrics. We have thus proved Theorem B:
Theorem 10.12. The existence or nonexistence of optimal metrics
depends on the choice of smooth structure. In particular, the topological
4-manifolds K3 and 
admit infinitely many exotic
smooth structures for which no optimal metric exists, even though each
also admits a “standard” smooth structure for which optimal metrics do
exist.
A similar construction [46] yields anorexic sequences on many exotic
manifolds homeomorphic to 
Consider the complex orbifold

performing a logarithmic transform to one fiber by the previous gluing
argument. If

that

that

many distinct smooth structures in this way for any fixed g and 
By
Proposition 10.3, we therefore have the following result:
Theorem 10.13. For any odd 
and any 
the topo-
logical manifold

Lemma 10.9 now allows us to produce more examples of smooth
4-manifolds with anorexic sequences by taking connected sums of our

previous examples. Determining whether we obtain distinct differen-
tiable structures in this way is a cutting-edge problem in gauge-theory,
however, and it is only by applying the sophisticated new machinery
of Bauer and Furuta [9, 8] that a result of this type can be obtained.
Specifically, if g is odd, then the bandwidth argument of [35] shows that

Since Proposition 10.3
tells us that none of these spaces can admit optimal metrics, we thus
obtain the second part of Theorem C:
Theorem 10.14. If    and    are integers, with
 mod 8,
and               then the topological manifold                        admits infinitely
distinct smooth structures for which no optimal metric exists.
11. Concluding Remarks
While we have seen that many topological 4-manifolds fail to admit
optimal metrics for many choices of smooth structure, the techniques
developed here do not by any means allow us to determine whether or
not an optimal metric exists for an arbitrary smooth structure. The
reason is that the arguments deployed in §10 are heavily dependent on
the existence of anorexic sequences of metrics, whereas such sequence
simply do not exist for many smooth structures. For example, if X is
a minimal complex surface of general type, and if 
is the
complex surface obtained from it by blowing up points, then Seiberg–
Witten theory can be used to show [47] that any metric on M satisfies
so there are certainly no anorexic metrics on such an M. If X is simply
connected and is sufficiently large, however, this 4-manifold is homeo–
morphic to one of the manifolds treated by Theorem C, and so represents
an exotic smooth structure on this topological 4-manifold which is simply
not amenable to treatment with the current technology.

The main obstacle to progress on this front is that the estimate (13)
does not appear to be sharp; if we compare it with known minimizing se-
quences for            on a complex surface M of general type with minimal
model X, we only obtain upper and lower bounds
for 
These bounds certainly do not allow one to compute
but they do allow us to estimate with sufficient accuracy to be able to
know that at least several different values of 
must occur for many
fixed homeotypes. An exact computation of 
for such examples would
have many interesting ramifications, and should be considered as an
outstanding open problem in the subject.
While current technology does not suffice to compute 
for many
of the most interesting 4-manifolds, the analogous invariants
arising from the scalar and Ricci curvatures do turn out to be exact-
ly computable for complex surfaces of general type and many of their
connect sums [47, 36]. It may therefore come as a surprise that one
key trick used in computations of 
is closely related to the techniques
developed here. Indeed, the Gauss–Bonnet and signature formulæ tell
one that
so that the existence of an anorexic sequence is certainly quite sufficient
to allow one to calculate 
However, the curious difference is that the

and one can actually find sequences of metrics for which the left-hand
side approaches the expression on the right; thus, an exact formula
emerges from the discussion. Moreover, related arguments show that
this infimum is unattained whenever 
For details and further
applications, see [47, 36].
While Theorem A may shed a fair amount of light on the existence
of SFASD metrics on compact 4-manifolds, it by no means closes the
book on the subject. For example, we still do not know whether such
metrics exist on 
The existence of SFASD metrics on

is also not covered by Theorem A, although Yann Rollin
and Michael Singer seem to have recently made considerable progress
concerning these manifolds. The global structure of the moduli space of
SFASD metrics still remains a mystery. And it would obviously be of
the greatest interest to sharpen Proposition 3.5 so as to say something
about diffeotype when 
or to definitively handle the non-simply
connected case.
We now have many examples of optimal metrics on compact 4-
manifolds, essentially falling into two classes: the Einstein metrics, and
the scalar-flat anti-self-dual metrics. Of course, we can cheaply obtain
further examples by reversing the orientation of SFASD manifolds to
make them self-dual instead of anti-self-dual. But, such trickery aside,
there do not really seem to be any other known examples of optimal
metrics on compact 4-manifolds. In particular, it seems that all known
examples of optimal metrics are critical points of

timality, also of 
Now a metric on a 4-manifold is a critical
point of 
iff it has vanishing Bach tensor [11]. Are there any
optimal metrics on compact 4-manifolds that are not Bach-flat? Are
there scalar-flat optimal metrics which are Bach-flat, but neither self-
dual nor anti-self-dual? Both of these questions should illustrate the
degree to which we still remain fundamentally ignorant as to the true
nature of general optimal metrics, even in dimension four.

This survey consists of two parts. Part 1 is devoted to amoebas. These
are images of algebraic subvarieties in 
under the logarithmic
moment map. The amoebas have essentially piecewise-linear shape if viewed
at large. Furthermore, they degenerate to certain piecewise-linear objects
called tropical varieties whose behavior is governed by algebraic geometry
over the so-called tropical semifield. Geometric aspects of tropical algebraic
geometry is the content of Part 2. We pay special attention to tropical curves.
Both parts also include relevant applications of the theories. Part 1 of this
survey is a revised and updated version of the report [28].

Part 1. AMOEBAS
1. Definition and Basic Properties of Amoebas
1.1.  Definitions.  Let                     be an algebraic variety. Recall that
is the group of complex numbers under multiplication. Let
be defined by
Definition 1.1 (Gelfand–Kapranov–Zelevinski [11]). The amoeba of
V is
Proposition 1.2 ([11]). The amoeba             is a closed set with
a nonempty complement.
If 
is a closed 
toric variety and
is a compactification of V then we say that
is the amoeba of
(recall
that
is also the amoeba of
Thus we can speak about
amoebas of projective varieties once the coordinates in 
or at least
an action of 
is chosen.
If 
is equipped with a 
symplectic form then we
can also consider the corresponding moment map               (see

Amoebas and Tropical Geometry
259
[4] ,[11]), where      is the convex polyhedron associated to the toric variety
with the given symplectic form. The polyhedron 
is a subset of
but it is well defined only up to a translation. In this case we can
also define the compactified amoeba of
Definition 1.3 ([11]). The compactified amoeba of V is
Remark 1.4. Maps 
and Log are submersions and have the
same real 
as fibers. Thus 
is mapped diffeomorphically onto
under a reparameterization of 
onto
Using the compactified amoeba we can describe the behavior of
near infinity. Note that each face 
of 
determines a toric variety
Consider 
Let 
be the compactified
amoeba of
Proposition 1.5 ([11]). We have
This proposition can be used to describe the behavior of
near infinity.

1.2. Amoebas at infinity. Consider a linear subspace         parallel
to 
and with 
Let 
be a supporting hyperplane
for the convex polyhedron 
at the face 
i.e., a hyperplane such that
Let 
be an outwards normal vector to H. Let
be the intersection of L with the result of translation of 
by
Recall that the Hausdorff distance between two closed sets
is
where 
is the Euclidean distance between a point 
and a set B.
We say that a sequence 
converges to a set 
when
with
respect to the Hausdorff metric on compacts in 
if for any compact
we have
Proposition 1.6.  The subsets     converge to     when
with respect to the Hausdorff metric on compacts in
This proposition can be informally restated in the case 
and
dimV = 1. In this case 
is a polygon and the amoeba 
develops
“tentacles” perpendicular to the sides of
(see Figure 3). The number
of tentacles perpendicular to a side of 
is bounded from above by the
integer length of this side, i.e., one plus the number of the lattice points
in the interior of the side.
Corollary 1.7. For a generic choice of the slope of a line   in
the intersection 
is compact.
1.3. Amoebas of hypersurfaces: concavity and topology of the
complement. Forsberg, Passare, and Tsikh treated amoebas of hy-
persurfaces in [10]. In this case V is a zero set of a single polyno-
mial
 Here we use the multiindex notations
and 
Let

which maps different components of the complement of    to different
lattice points of
Corollary 1.9 ([10]). The number of components of               is nev-
er greater then the number of lattice points of
Theorem 1.8 and Proposition 1.6 indicate the dependence of the
amoeba on the Newton polyhedron.
The inequality of Corollary 1.9 is sharp. This sharpness is a spe-
cial case of Theorem 2.8. Also examples of amoebas with the maximal
number of the components of the complement are supplied by Theorem
4.6.
The concavity of 
is equivalent to concavity of its boundary. The
boundary 
is contained in the critical value locus of 
The
following proposition also takes care of some interior branches of this
locus.
Proposition 1.10 ([26]). Let             be an open convex domain
and       be a connected component of                              Then
is convex.

1.4. Amoebas in higher codimension: concavity. The amoeba of
a hypersurface is of full dimension in 
unless its Newton poly-
hedron 
is contained in a line. The boundary 
at its generic point
is a smooth 
submanifold. Its normal curvature form
has no negative squares with respect to the outwards normal (because of
convexity of components of 
). This property can be generalized
to the nonsmooth points in the following way.
Definition 1.11. An open interval
where L is a straight
line in 
is called a supporting1-cap for
if
is nonempty and compact;
there exists a vector 
such that the translation of 
by
is disjoint from 
for all sufficiently small
The convexity of the components of 
can be reformulated as
stating that there are no 1-caps for
Similarly we may define higher-dimensional caps.
Definition 1.12. An open round disk 
of radius 
in a
is called a supporting 
for 
if
is non -empty and compact;
there exists a vector 
such that the translation of 
by
is disjoint from 
for all sufficiently small
Consider now the general case, where 
is
Let 
be the codimension of V. The amoeba
is of full dimension
in 
if 
The boundary 
at its generic point is a smooth
submanifold. Its normal curvature form may not have more
than 
negative squares with respect to the outwards normal. To
see that note that a composition of 
and any linear
projection 
is a pluriharmonic function.
Note that this implies that there are no 
for 
at its smooth
points. It turns out that there are no 
for 
at the nonsmooth
points as well and also in the case of 
when 
is

is called
if for any 
the induced homomorphism
is injective.
Conjecturally the amoeba of a codimension
variety in 
is
A proof of a somewhat weaker version of this statement is
contained in [13].
1.5. Amoebas in higher codimension: topology of the comple-
ment. Recall that in the hypersurface case each component of
is connected and that there are not more than 
such com-
ponents. The correspondence between the components of the comple-
ment and the lattice points of 
can be viewed as a cohomology class
whose evaluation on a point in each component of
is the corresponding lattice point.
Similarly, when V is of codimension 
there exists a natural class

where 
is the real

and

is the linking number in 
of 
and the closure of V.
The cohomology class 
corresponds to the linking with the funda-
mental class of V. Consider now the linking with smaller-dimensional
homology of V.
Note that for an 
variety 
we have

Recall that a subspace 
is called isotropic if the restriction
of the intersection form to L is trivial.

The image 
is isotropic in

Remark 1.17. A positive answer to Question 1.15 together with
Proposition 1.16 would produce an upper bound for the dimension of
One may also define similar linking forms for
(if 
then we can use ordinary homology 
instead of
homology with closed support).
The answer to Question 1.15 is currently unknown even in the case
when
is a curve. In this case V is a Riemann surface and it
is defined by a single polynomial. Let 
be the Newton polygon of V.
The genus of V is equal to the number of lattice points strictly inside
(see [22]) while the number of punctures is equal to the number of
lattice points on the boundary of 
). Thus the dimension of a maximal
isotropic subspace of 
is equal to 
and Question 1.15
agrees with Corollary 1.9 for this case.
2. Analytic Treatment of Amoebas
This section outlines the results obtained by Passare and Rullgård in
[33], [39] and [40].
We assume that 
is a hypersurface in this section. Thus
for a polynomial 
and we can consider
the Newton polyhedron of V (see 1.3).
2.1. The Ronkin function     Since  is a holomorphic function,
is a pluriharmonic function. Furthermore, if we
set 
then we have a plurisubharmonic function
which is, obviously, strictly plurisubharmonic over V. Recall that a func-
tion F in a domain 
is called plurisubharmonic if its restriction
to any complex line L is subharmonic, i.e., the value of F at each point
is smaller or equal than the average of the value of F along a small
circle in L around
Let 
be the push-forward of 
under the map
i.e.,

Amoebas and Tropical Geometry
265
(cf. [38]). This function was called the Ronkin function in [33]. It is
easy to see that it takes real (finite) values even over 
where
the integral is singular.
Proposition 2.1 (Ronkin–Passare–Rullgård [33], [38]). The func-
tion
is convex. It is strictly convex over 
and linear over
each component of
This follows from plurisubharmonicity of 
its
strict plurisubharmonicity over V and its pluriharmonicity in
Indeed the convexity of a function in a connected real domain is just a
real counterpart of plurisubharmonicity. A harmonic function of one real
variable has to be linear and thus a function of several real variables is
real-plurisubharmonic if and only if it is convex. Over each connected
component of 
the function is linear as the push-forward of a
pluriharmonic function.
Remark 2.2. Note that just the existence of a convex function
which is strictly convex over 
and linear over components of
implies that each component of             is convex.
Thus the gradient 
is constant over each component

defined by the Laplacian

coincides with the push-forward of the symplectic volume on V,
i.e., for any Borel set A
This theorem appears in [33] as a particular case of a computation
for the mixed Monge–Ampère operator, the symmetric multilinear op-
erator associating a measure to 
functions 
(recall that by
our convention 
is the number of variables) and such that its value

is the Monge–Ampère measure from Definition 2.9. The to-

Recall that this mixed volume divided by 
appears in the Bern-
stein formula [6] which counts the number of common solutions of the
system of equations
(assuming that the corresponding hypersur-
faces intersect transversely). Passare and Rullgård found the following
local analogue of the Bernstein formula which also serves as a geomet-
ric interpretation of the mixed Monge–Ampère measure. Note that the
complex torus 
acts on polynomials of

Passare and Rullgård [33] showed that in this case the Lebesgue mea-
sure on 
is not greater than 
times the Monge–Ampère measure. In
particular, we have the following theorem.

This theorem is specific for the case 
Nondegenerate higher-
dimensional amoebas of hypersurfaces have infinite volume. This follows
from Proposition 1.6 since the area of the cross-section at infinity must
be separated from zero.
3. Some Applications of Amoebas
3.1. The first part of Hilbert’s 16th problem. Most applications
considered here are in the framework of Hilbert’s 16th problem. Consider
the classical setup of its first part ([14]). Let 
be a smooth

algebraic curve of degree 
What are the possible topological types of
pairs 
for a given
Since 
is smooth it is homeomorphic to a disjoint union of circles.
All of these circles must be contractible in 
(such circles are called
the ovals) if is even. If is odd then exactly one of these circles is non-
contractible. Therefore, the topological type of 
(also called
the topological arrangement of 
in 
) is determined by the num-
ber of components of 
together with the information on the mutual
position of the ovals.
The possible number of components of 
was determined by Har-
nack [12]. He proved that it cannot be greater than
Furthermore he proved that for any number
there exists a curve of degree 
with exactly 
components as long as
in the case of odd 
(recall that for odd 
we always have to have
a noncontractible component).
Note that each oval separates
into its interior, which is homeo-
morphic to a disk, and its exterior, which is homeomorphic to a Möbius
band. If the interiors of the ovals intersect then the ovals are called
nested. Otherwise the ovals are called disjoint. Hilbert’s problem start-
ed from a question whether a curve of degree 6 which has 11 ovals (the
maximal number according to Harnack) can have all of the ovals disjoint.
This question was answered negatively by Petrovsky [34] who showed
that at least two ovals of a sextic must be nested if the total number of
ovals is 11.
In general the number of topological arrangements of curves of de-
gree 
grows exponentially with 
Even for small 
the number of the
possible types is enormous. Many powerful theorems restricting possible
topological arrangements were found for over 100 years of history of this
problem, see, in particular, [34], [3], [37], [44]. A powerful patchwork-
ing construction technique [42] counters these theorems. The complete
classifications is currently known for 
(see [42]).
The most restricted turn out to be curves with the maximal numbers
of components, i.e., with 
Such curves were called
M-curves by Petrovsky. However, even for M-curves, the number of
topological arrangements grows exponentially with

is unique.
In subsection 3.5 we formulate this maximality condition and sketch the
proof of uniqueness. A similar statement holds for curves in other toric
surfaces. The Newton polygon

Many M-curves with one or two disjoint bases are known (see, for
example, [8]).
However there is (topologically) only one known example of curve
with three disjoint bases, namely the first M-curve constructed by Har-
nack [12]. Theorem 3.12 asserts that this example is the only possible.

The map

surface-to-surface map in our case and its most generic singularities are
folds. By Proposition 1.10 the folds are convex. Thus a logarithmic
inflection point of 
must correspond to a higher singularity of
In [26] it was stated that there are two types of stable (surviving
small deformations of           logarithmic inflection points of           Here we’d
like to correct this statement. Only one of these two types is genuinely
stable. The first type (see Figure 7), called junction, corresponds to an
intersection of 
with a branch of imaginary folding curve. A junction
logarithmic inflection point can be found at the curve
Note that the image of the imaginary folding curve under the complex
conjugation is also a folding curve. Thus over its image we have a double
fold.
The second type, called pinching, corresponds to intersection of
with a circle 
that gets contracted by Log. The circle E intersect
at two points. These points belong to different quadrants of
but have the same absolute values of their coordinates. Both of these
points are logarithmic inflection points. The pinching is not stable even
in the class of real deformations. A small perturbation breaks it to two
junctions with a corner of two branches of the amoeba as in Figure 8.

nack curve then Area
In the opposite direction we have the following theorem. We say that
a curve

such

corresponding real part with

Example 3.27. There are 3 different topological types of smooth
M-quartics in 
(see [21]). They realize all topological possibilities
for maximal real structures on abstract K3-surfaces. Namely, such real
surface may be homeomorphic to
the disjoint union of 9 spheres and a surface of genus 2;
the disjoint union of 5 spheres and a surface of genus 6;
the disjoint union of a sphere and a surface of genus 10.
Theorem 3.25 asserts that only the last type can be a torically maximal
quartic in 
More generally, only the last type can be a torically
maximal surface is a toric 3-fold
3.6.2. Geometric properties of maximal algebraic surfaces in
Recall the classical geometric terminology. Let 
be a smooth
surface. We call a point 
elliptic, hyperbolic or parabolic if the
Gauss curvature of S at 
is positive, negative or zero.
Remark 3.28. Of course we do not actually need to use the Rie-
mannian metric on S do define these points. Here is an equivalent defini-
tion without referring to the curvature. Locally near 
we can present S
as the graph of a function 
If the Hessian form of this function
at 
is degenerate then we call 
parabolic. If not, the intersection of S
with the tangent plane at 
is a real curve with an ordinary double point
in 
If this point is isolated we call 
elliptic. If it is an intersection of
two real branches of the curve we call it hyperbolic.
We say that a point 
is logarithmically elliptic, hy-
perbolic or parabolic if it maps to such point under
Generically for a smooth surface in 
the parabolic locus, i.e., the
set of parabolic points, is a 1-dimensional curve. So is the logarithmic
parabolic locus for a surface in 
In a contrast to this we have
the following theorem for torically maximal surfaces. Note that torically
maximal surfaces form an open subset in the space of all surfaces with
a given Newton polyhedron.
Theorem 3.29 ([32]). The logarithmic parabolic locus of a torically
maximal surface consists of a finite number of points.
Note that such a zero-dimensional locus cannot separate the surface
Thus each component of

cally hyperbolic (all its points except finitely many are logarithmically
hyperbolic).

three outer vertices, namely (–1,0,0), (0,–1,0) and (0,0,–1). At the
second step we remove a unit cube whose outer vertex is one of these
three and proceed inductively. For each N we have a finite number of
possible resulting regions
The projection of such region defines a tiling by diamond-shaped
figures (dimers) as in Figure 9. Clearly there is no more than 3N dimers
in the tiling. Each dimer in 
is assigned a weight in a double-periodic
fashion with some integer period vectors. The probability of a tiling is
determined by these weights.
It is shown in [20] that after some rescaling the union of the dimer
tiles converges to some limiting region 
that depends only on the
choice of the (periodic) choice of weights of the dimers when
Furthermore, according to [20] there exists a simple Harnack curve
V with the amoeba

The curve V is
a line (as in Figure 9) if all the dimer weights are the same. For other
periodic weight choices any simple Harnack curve can appear.
Using such dimer interpretation Kenyon and Okounkov [19] have
constructed an explicit parameterization for the set of all simple Harnack
curves of the same degree. It is shown in [19] that this set is contractible.

usually taken to be the minimum (instead of the maximum), but, clearly,
the minimum generates an isomorphic semifield.

It turns out that these polynomials are responsible for some piecewise-
linear geometry in 
that is similar in many ways to the classical al-

Furthermore, this tropical geometry can be obtained as the result of a

Viro’s patchworking theorem [42] asserts that for
large values of 
the hypersurface 
can be obtained from

a certain patchworking procedure. The same holds for amoebas of the
hypersurfaces 
and 
In fact patchworking of real hypersurfaces
can be interpreted as the real version of patchworking of amoebas (see
Appendix in [26]). It was noted by Viro in [43] that patchworking is
related to so-called Maslov’s dequantization of positive real numbers.
Recall that a quantization of a semiring R is a family of semirings

4.4. Tropical varieties and non-Archimedean amoebas. We start
by defining tropical hypersurfaces. The semiring 
lacks (additive)
zero so the tropical hypersurfaces are defined as singular loci and not as
zero loci. Let F :
be a tropical polynomial. It is a continuous
convex piecewise-linear function. Unless F is linear it is not everywhere
smooth.
Definition 4.7. The tropical variety 
of F is the set of all
points in 
where F is not smooth.
Equivalently we may define 
as the set of points where more than
one monomial of 
reaches the maximum.
Let us go back to the non-Archimedean field K of Puiseux series.
Let
be a polynomial that defines a hypersurface
and let 
be the corresponding non-Archimedean
amoeba. We form a tropical polynomial
Kapranov’s description [18] of the non-Archimedean amoebas can
be restated in the following way.
Theorem 4.8 ([18]). The amoeba 
coincides with the tropical
hypersurface
Definition of tropical varieties in higher codimension in 
gets
somewhat tricky as intersections of tropical hypersurfaces are not al-
ways tropical. As is was suggested in [36] non-Archimedean amoebas
provide a byway for such definition as tropical varieties can be simply
defined as non-Archimedean amoebas for algebraic varieties in
In the next section we concentrate on the study of tropical curves.

clude [29] for the case of hypersurfaces and [41] for the case of the

5.1. Definitions. Let 
be a finite graph whose edges are weighted by
natural numbers. Let 
be the set of 1-valent vertices of 
We set
Definition 5.1 (Mikhalkin [31]). A proper map 
is
called a parameterized tropical curve if it satisfies to the following two
conditions.
Two parameterized tropical curves 
and 
are
called equivalent if there exists a homeomorphism 
which
respects the weights of the edges and such that 
We do not
distinguish equivalent parameterized tropical curves.
The image
is called the (unparameterized) tropical curve. It is a weighted piecewise-
linear graph in 
Note that the same curve 
may admit
nonequivalent parameterizations. The curve C is called irreducible if
is connected for any parameterization. Otherwise the curve is called
reducible.
Remark 5.2. In dimension 2 the notion of tropical curve coincides
with the notion of 
introduced by Aharony, Hanany and Kol
in [2] (see also [1]).
It is convenient to prescribe a multiplicity to a 3-valent vertex
of the tropical curve 
as in [31]. As in Definition 5.1 let
be their weights of the edges of 
adjacent to A and let
be the primitive integer vectors in the direction of the edges.

the restriction 
is an embedding. The

is contained in a line 
such that the slope of is
rational.
For every vertex 
we have the following property. Let
be the edges adjacent to V, let 
be their
weights and let 
be the primitive integer vectors
from V in the direction of the edges. We have

If the multiplicity of a vertex is greater than 1 then it is possible to
deform it with an appearance of a new cycle as in Figure 11.
5.2. Degree, genus and the tropical Riemann–Roch formula.
Heuristically, the degree of a tropical curve
is the set of its
asymptotic directions. For each end of a tropical curve 
we fix
a primitive integer vector parallel to this ray in the outward direction
and multiply it by the weight of the corresponding (half-infinite) edge.
Doing this for every end of C we get a collection 
of integer vectors in
Let us add all vectors in 
that are positive multiples of each other.
The result is a set 
of nonzero integer vectors such

that
Note that in this set we do not have positive multiples
of each other, i.e. if 
for 
then
Definition 5.4 ([31]). The set
is called the degree of the tropical
curve 
The genus of a parameterized tropical curve
is 
so that if is connected then it coincides
with the number of cycles
in
The genus of a tropical curve
is the minimal genus among all the parameterization
There is an important class of tropical curves that behaves especially
nice with respect to a genus-preserving deformation.
Definition 5.5 ([31]). A parameterized tropical curve
is called simple if
is 3-valent,
is an immersion,
if 
are such that 
then neither 
nor 
can be a
vertex of
In this case the image 
is called a simple tropical curve.
Simple curves locally deform in a linear space.
Theorem 5.6 (Tropical Riemann–Roch, [31]). Let 
be
a simple tropical curve, where 
is a graph with 
ends. Non-equivalent
tropical curves of the same genus and with the same number of ends close
to 
locally form a 
real vector space, where
If the curve is nonsimple then its space of deformation is locally
piecewise-linear.
5.3. Enumerative tropical geometry in 
It was suggested by
Kontsevich (see [24] and [28]) that tropical curves can be used for enu-
meration of holomorphic curves. This suggestion was realized in [31] for
the case of toric surfaces. Let us review the problem of curve counting
for the complex torus
Any algebraic curve 
is defined by a polynomial

Recall that from the topological viewpoint the degree of a variety is its
homology class in the ambient variety. Here we have a difficulty caused
by noncompactness of
Help is provided by the Newton polygon
of 
The polygon 
can be interpreted as the (tone) degree of
V. Indeed being a compact lattice polygon 
defines a compact toric
surface
for example, by taking the closure of the image
under the Veronese embedding
(see, for example,
[11]). The closure of V in 
defines a homology class induced from
the hyperplane section by the Veronese embedding.
Note that the definition of the toric degree agrees with its tropical
counterpart in Definition 5.4. Indeed, for each side 
of 
we can
take the primitive integer normal vector in the outward direction and
multiply it by the lattice length 
of the side. The result
is a tropical degree set 
Accordingly we define
which is the number of ends of a general curve of degree 
in
An irreducible curve V has geometric genus which is the genus of
its normalization 
In the case when V is not necessarily irre-
ducible it is convenient to define the genus as the sum of the genera of
all irreducible components minus the number of such components plus
one.
Let us fix the genus (i.e. a number 
and the toric degree (i.e.,
a polygon

general points in

irreducible curves among them.
These numbers are close relatives of the Gromov–Witten invariants

Fano they coincide with the corresponding Gromov–Witten invariants.
The numbers 
and 
have tropical counterparts.
For a fixed genus 
and a toric degree 
we fix a configuration

of 
general points in the tropical plane 
(for a rigorous def-
inition of tropical general position see [31]). We have a finite number
of tropical curves of genus 
and degree 
passing through 
(see
[31]). Generically all such curves are simple (see Definition 5.5. However
unlike the situation in
the number of such curves is different for
different configurations of 
general point.
Definition 5.7 ([31]). The multiplicity 
of a simple tropical
curve 
of degree 
and genus 
passing via 
equals to the
product of the multiplicities of the (3-valent) vertices of
(see  Definition
5.3).
Theorem 5.8 ([31]). The number of irreducible tropical curves of
genus 
and degree 
passing via 
and counted with multiplicity from
Definition 5.7 equals to
The number of all tropical curves of genus 
and degree 
passing via
and counted with multiplicity from Definition 5.7 equals to

Example 5.9. Figure 12 shows a (generic) configuration of 8 points
and all curves of genus 0 and of projective degree 3 passing
through 
Out of these nine curves eight have multiplicity 1 and one
(with a weight 2 edge) has multiplicity 4. All the curves are irreducible.
Thus
Theorem 5.8 thus reduces the problem of finding            and
to the corresponding tropical problems. Furthermore, it allows
us to use any general configuration 
in the tropical plane 
(as it
implies that the answer is independent of 
We can take the configu-
ration 
on the same affine (not tropical) line 
and still insure
tropical general position as long as the slope of L is irrational. It was
shown in [31] that such curves are encoded by lattice paths of length
connecting a pair of vertices in
Namely, the slope of L determines a linear function
such that 
is injective and thus a linear order on the lattice points
of 
There is a combinatorial rule (see [30] or [31]) that associates
a nonnegative integer multiplicity to every
lattice path of
length 
i.e., to every order-increasing sequence of lattice points
of 
that contains 
points. This multiplicity is only nonzero if the
first and the last points of the sequence are the points where 
reaches
its minimum and maximum.
Example 5.10. The tropical curves from Figure 12 are described
by the lattice paths from Figure 13 shown together with their multiplic-
ities. Here the first path describes the first 3 tropical curve from Figure
12, the second — the next two paths, the third — the next curve (which
itself corresponds to 4 distinct holomorphic curves), the fourth — the
next curve and the fifth — the last two tropical curves from Figure 12.
These paths are

sion). The results of previous subsections can be established with the
help of the following restatement of Theorem 4.6 in the case of
Lemma 5.11.
If

exists a family 
of holomorphic curves for 
such that
Here the degree of C coincides with the degree of
The situation is more complicated if 
as such statement is no
longer true for all tropical curves in

planar projective cubic curve. Let 
be the end points of
these rays. Consider the curve
It is easy to check that 
is a (spatial) projective curve of degree 3
and genus 1. Suppose that

not lying on the same tropical line in

to be in tropically general position). Then C cannot be obtained
as the limit of

stands for
Indeed, any cubic curve 
of genus 1 is planar, i.e., is con-
tained in a plane 
It is easy to see (after passing to a sub-
sequence, see [29] and [31]) that there has to exist a limiting set H for
Furthermore, H is a tropical hypersurface in 
whose New-
ton polyhedron is contained in the polyhedron of a hyperplane. Since
we can deduce that H has to be a hyperplane. But then the

intersection of H with 
is (up to a translation in 
a union of the
negative quadrant 
and the ray
The points 
have to sit on the boundary of the quadrant (which is
impossible unless they are tropically collinear).
Note that the tropical Riemann–Roch formula (Theorem 5.6) is a
strict inequality for the curve C. In accordance with the classical ter-
minology such curves are called superabundant. Conversely, a tropical
curve is called regular if the Riemann–Roch formula turns into equal-
ity. It is easy to see that all rational curves are regular and that the
superabundancy of C is caused by the cycle contained in an affine plane
in 
Conjecturally all regular curves are limits of the corresponding
complex amoebas. Hopefully the technique developed in the Symplectic
Field Theory, see [9] and [7] can help to verify this conjecture.
Let us formulate a tropical enumerative tropical problem in 
We
fix the genus 
and the degree 
In addition we
fix a configuration 
which consists of some points and some higher
dimensional tropical varieties in 
in general position. Let

sum of the codimensions of all varieties in 
For each

If 
then the expected number of tropical curves
of genus 
and degree 
passing through 
is finite. However there may
exist positive-dimensional families of superabundant curves of genus
and degree 
through
One way to avoid this (higher-dimensional) difficulty is to restrict
ourselves to the genus zero case. In this case one can assign multiplicities
to tropical rational curves passing through 
so that the total number of
tropical curves counted with these multiplicities agrees with the number
of curves in the corresponding complex enumerative problem (details are
subject to a future paper).

can be presented as images C =  Log(B) for certain objects
called complex tropical curves. (Recall that Log : 
is the
coordinatewise logarithm of the absolute value.) Let

It is easy to see that for every open edge of 
the inverse image
is a disjoint union of holomorphic cylinders. We can
prescribe the weights to this cylinder so that the sum is equal to the
weight of E. (In fact the second condition in Definition 5.13 is needed
only to insure that the cylinder weights in different neighborhoods are
consistent.)
Complex tropical curves can be viewed as curves “holomorphic” with
respect to a (maximally) degenerate complex structure in

curve

strictly greater than that of C.
In a similar way one can define real tropical curves by requiring all
curves 
in Definition 5.13 to be real. Our next purpose is to define
simple real tropical curves. Let

In this paper, we describe some invariants for low-dimensional manifolds
that are constructed using suitable counts of pseudo-holomorphic disks.
1. Introduction
Gromov’s theory of pseudo-holomorphic disks [40] has wide-reaching
consequences in symplectic geometry and low-dimensional topology. Our
aim here is to describe certain invariants for low-dimensional manifolds
built on this theory.
The invariants we describe here associate a graded Abelian group
to each closed, oriented three-manifold Y, the Heegaard Floer homology
of Y. These invariants also have a four-dimensional counterpart, which

associates to each smooth cobordism between two such three-manifolds
a map between the corresponding Floer homology groups. In another
direction, there is a variant which gives rise to an invariant of knots in Y.
1.1. Some background on Floer homology. To place Heegaard Flo-
er homology into a wider context, we begin with Casson’s invariant.
Starting with a Heegaard decomposition of an integer homology three-
sphere Y, Casson constructs a numerical invariant which roughly speak-
ing gives an obstruction to disjoining the SU(2) character varieties of the
two handlebodies inside the character variety for the Heegaard surface
(cf. [1] and [95]).
During the time when Casson introduced his invariants to three-
dimensional topology, smooth four-dimensional topology was being rev-
olutionized by the work of Donaldson [16], who showed that the moduli
spaces of solutions to certain nonlinear, elliptic PDEs – gauge theory
equations which were first written down by physicists – revealed a great
deal about the underlying smooth four-manifold topology. Indeed, he
constructed certain diffeomorphism invariants, called Donaldson polyno-
mials, defined by counting (in a suitable sense) solutions to these PDEs,
the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations [13], [14], [10], [33], [52].
It was proved by Taubes in [100] that Casson’s invariant admits
a gauge-theoretic interpretation. This interpretation was carried fur-
ther by Floer [28], who constructed a homology theory whose Euler
characteristic is Casson’s invariant. The construction of this instanton
Floer homology proceeds by defining a chain complex whose generators
are equivalence classes of flat SU(2) connections over Y (or, more pre-
cisely, a suitably perturbed notion of flat connections, as required for
transversality), and whose differentials count solutions to the anti-self-
dual Yang-Mills equations. In fact, Floer’s instanton homology quickly
became a central tool in the calculation of Donaldson’s invariants, see
for example [68], [26], [12]. More specifically, under suitable conditions,
the Donaldson invariant of a four-manifold X separated along a three-
manifold Y could be viewed as a pairing, in the Floer homology of Y, of
relative Donaldson invariants coming from the two sides.
Floer’s construction seemed closely related to an earlier construc-
tion Floer gave in the context of Hamiltonian dynamics, known as “La-
grangian Floer homology” [27]. That theory – which is also very closely
related to Gromov’s invariants for symplectic manifolds (cf. [40]) — as-
sociates to a symplectic manifold V, equipped with a pair of Lagrangian

submanifolds
and
(that are in generic position, and satisfy certain 
topological restrictions), a homology theory whose Euler characteristic
is the algebraic intersection number of 
and 
but which gives a
refined symplectic obstruction to disjoining the Lagrangians through ex-
act Hamiltonian isotopies. More specifically, the generators for this chain
complex are intersection points for 
and 
and its differentials count
holomorphic Whitney disks which interpolate between these intersection
points, see also [34].
The close parallel between Floor’s two constructions, which take us
back to Casson’s original picture, were further explored by Atiyah [4].
Atiyah conjectured that Floer’s instanton theory coincides with a suit-
able version of Floer’s Lagrangian theory, where one considers the SU(2)
character variety of 
as the ambient symplectic manifold, equipped with
the Lagrangian submanifolds which are the character varieties of the two
handlebodies. The Atiyah-Floer conjecture remains open to this day. For
related results, see [17], [94], [106].
In 1994, there was another drastic turn of events in gauge theo-
ry and its interaction with smooth four-manifold topology, namely, the
introduction of a new set of equations coming from physics, the Seiberg-
Witten monopole equations [107]. These are a novel system of nonlinear,
elliptic, first-order equations which one can associate to a smooth four-
manifold equipped with a Riemannian metric. Just as the Yang-Mills
equations lead to Donaldson polynomials, the Seiberg–Witten equations
lead to another smooth four-manifold invariant, the Seiberg–Witten in-
variant (cf. [107], [67], [11], [53], [101]). These two theories seem very
closely related. In fact, Witten conjectured a precise relationship be-
tween the two four-manifold invariants, see [107], [24], see also [51].
Moreover, many of the formal aspects of Donaldson theory have their
analogues in Seiberg–Witten theory. In particular, it was natural to
expect a similar relationship between their three-dimensional counter-
parts [65], [69], [64].
But now, a question arises in studying the three-dimensional theory:
what is the geometric picture playing the role of character varieties in
this new context? In attempting to formulate an answer to this question,
we came upon a construction which has, as its starting point a Heegaard
diagram 
for a three-manifold Y [85]. That is, 
is an oriented
surface of genus 
and 
and

of 
of embedded, homologically linearly independent, mutually
disjoint, closed curves. Thus, the

However,
by using the holomorphic disk techniques of Lagrangian Floer homolo-
gy, we obtain a nontrivial invariant for three-manifolds,               whose
Euler characteristic is this intersection number. In fact, there are some
additional elaborations of this construction which give other variants of
Heegaard Floer homology (denoted 
and 
discussed
below).
This geometric construction gives rise to invariants whose definition
is quite different in flavor than its gauge-theoretic predecessors. And yet,
it is natural to conjecture that certain variants give the same information
as Seiberg–Witten theory. This conjecture, in turn, can be viewed as an
analogue of the Atiyah-Floer conjecture in the Seiberg–Witten context.
With this said, it is also fruitful to study Heegaard Floer homology and
its structure independently from its gauge-theoretical origins.
1.2. Structure of this paper. Our aim in this article is to give a
leisurely introduction to Heegaard Floer homology. We begin by recall-
ing some of the details of the construction in Section 2. In Section 3,
we describe some of the properties. Broader summaries can be found
in some of our other papers (cf. [84], [82]). In Section 4 we describe
in further detail the relationship between Heegaard Floer homology and
knots (cf. [76], [78] and also the work of Rasmussen [90], [88]). We
conclude in Section 5 with some problems and questions raised by these
investigations.
We have not attempted to give a full account of the state of Hee-
gaard Floer homology. In particular, we have said very little about
the four-manifold invariants. We do not discuss here the Dehn surgery
characterization of the unknot which follows from properties of Floer
homology (see Corollary 1.3 of [77], and also [57] for the original proof
using Seiberg-Witten monopole Floer homology; compare also [39], [8],
[36]). Another topic to which we have paid only fleeting attention is

Heegaard Diagrams and Holomorphic Disks
305
the close relationship between Heegaard Floer homology and contact ge-
ometry [80]. As a result, we do not have the opportunity to describe
the recent results of Lisca and Stipsicz in contact geometry which result
from this interplay, see for example [60].
1.3. Further remarks. The conjectured relationship between Heega-
ard Floer homology and Seiberg–Witten theory can be put on a more
precise footing with the help of some more recent developments in gauge
theory. For example, Kronheimer and Mrowka [55] have given a com-
plete construction of a Seiberg–Witten–Floer package, which associates
to each closed, oriented three-manifold a triple of Floer homology groups
and 
which are functorial under cobordisms be-
tween three-manifolds. They conjecture that the three functors in this
sequence are isomorphic to (suitable completions of)
and 
respectively. A different approach is taken in papers by
Manolescu and Kronheimer (cf. [63], [50]).
It should also be pointed out that a different approach to under-
standing gauge theory from a geometrical point of view has been adopt-
ed by Taubes [102], building on his fundamental earlier work relating
the Seiberg–Witten and Gromov invariants of symplectic four-manifolds
[103], [104], [101].
2. The Construction
We recall the construction of Heegaard Floer homology. In Subsec-
tion 2.1, we explain the construction for rational homology three-spheres
(i.e., those three-manifolds whose first Betti number vanishes). In Sub-
section 2.2, we give an example which illustrates some of the subtleties
involved in the Floer complex. In Subsection 2.4, we outline how the con-
struction can be generalized for arbitrary closed, oriented three-manifolds.
In Subsection 2.5, we sketch the construction of the maps induced by
cobordisms, and in Subsection 2.6 we give preliminaries on the construc-
tion of the invariants for knots in 
The material in Sections 2.1-2.4
is derived from [85]. The material from Subsection 2.5 is an account
of the material starting in Section 8 of [85] and continued in [83]. The
material from Subsection 2.6 can be found in [76], see also [88].

which flow into the index two critical points.
In the opposite direction, a set of attaching circles for 
specifies a
handlebody which bounds 
and hence a Heegaard diagram specifies an
oriented three-manifold Y. It is a classical theorem of Singer [99] that
every closed, oriented three-manifold Y admits a Heegaard diagram, and
if two Heegaard diagrams describe the same three-manifold, then they
can be connected by a sequence of moves of the following type:
isotopies: replace 
by a curve 
which is isotopic through isotopies
which are disjoint from the other 
or, the same moves
amongst the
handleslides: replace

respectively, where 
and 
are a pair of curves supported in
E, meeting transversally in a single point.
Our goal is to associate a group to each Heegaard diagram, which is
unchanged by the above three operations, and hence an invariant of the
underlying three-manifold.
To this end, we will use a variant of Floer homology in the
symmetric product of a genus 
Heegaard surface 
relative to the pair
of totally real subspaces
That is to say, we define a chain complex generated by intersection
points between 
and 
and whose boundary maps count pseudo-
holomorphic disks in 
Again, it is useful to bear in mind the
Morse-theoretic interpretation: an intersection point x between

can be viewed as a 
of gradient flow-lines which connect all the
index two and index one critical points. We denote the corresponding
one-chain in Y by 
and call it a simultaneous trajectory.
Before studying the space of pseudo-holomorphic Whitney disks, we
turn our attention to the algebraic topology of Whitney disks. Specifi-
cally, we consider the unit disk

connecting x and y. (Indeed, the condition is sufficient to guarantee
existence of such a Whitney disk when
What this shows is that the space of intersection points between
and 
naturally fall into equivalence classes labeled by elements in an
affine space over
There is another very familiar such affine space over 
the
space of           structures over Y. Following Turaev [105], one can think
of this space concretely as the space of equivalence classes of vector
fields. Specifically, we say that two vector fields
and
over Y are

homology classes of vector fields (which in turn are identified with the
more standard definitions of
structures, see [105], [38], [56]) is
also an affine space over
In order to link these two concepts, we fix a basepoint

a Morse function as described earlier, the base point 
describes a flow
from the index zero to the index three critical point (for generic metric
on Y). Now, each tuple

flows between the index one and index two critical points. Modifying the
gradient vector field

lines so that it does not vanish there, we obtain a nowhere vanishing
vector field over Y, whose homology class gives us a 
structure,
depending on x and 
This gives rise to an assignment
It follows from the previous discussion that x and y have

x and y can be connected by a Whitney
disk.
Having answered the existence problem for Whitney disks, we turn
to questions of its uniqueness (up to homotopy). For this, we turn once
again to our fixed base-point

Our aim will be to count pseudo-holomorphic disks. For this to make
sense, we need to have a sufficiently generic situation, so that the moduli
spaces are cut out transversally and, in particular,

notion of pseudo-holomorphic disks, see for instance Section 3 of [85],
see also [31], [34]. Specifically, for such a perturbation, we can arrange

Floer homology with coefficients in 
or, in a more general case, to
be an appropriately signed count of the number of points in the moduli
space. For a discussion on signs, see [85], see also [30], [34].
By analyzing Gromov limits of pseudo-holomorphic disks, one can
prove that

It is easy to see that if a given homotopy class 
contains a holomor-
phic representative, then the intersection number 
is nonnegative.

invariance of the theory under a natural degeneration of the
symmetric product of the connected sum of

sum neck is stretched, compare also [59], [42].
Although the study of holomorphic disks in general is a daunting
task, holomorphic disks in symmetric products in a Riemann surface ad-
mit a particularly nice interpretation in terms of the underlying Riemann
surface: indeed, holomorphic disks in the 
symmetric product cor-
respond to 
branched coverings of the disk by a Riemann surface-
with-boundary, together with a holomorphic map from the Riemann-
surface-with-boundary into 
This gives a geometric grasp of the ob-
jects under study, and hence, in many special cases, a way to calculate
the boundary maps. In particular, it makes the model calculations used
in the proof of handle-slide invariance mentioned above possible. We use
it also freely in the following example.
2.2. An example. We give a concrete example to illustrate some of
the familiar subtleties arising in the Floer complex. For simplicity, we
stick to the case of

But the chain complex can change for reasons more subtle than com-
binatorics. Consider the Heegaard diagram for 
illustrated in Figure 2.
For this diagram, there are two different chain complexes, depending
on the choice of complex structure over 
(and the geometry of the
attaching circles). We sketch the argument below.

diagrams are topological invariants of Y. The interrelationships between
these groups is essential in the study of four-manifold invariants, as we

2.5. Maps induced by cobordisms. Cobordisms between three-ma-
nifolds give rise to maps between their Floer homology groups. The
construction of these maps relies on the holomorphic triangle construc-
tion from symplectic geometry (cf. [7], [34]).
A bridge between the symplectic geometry construction and the four-
manifold picture can be given as follows.
A Heegaard triple-diagram of genus 
is an oriented two-manifold
and three 
and 
which are sets of attaching circles for
handlebodies 
and 
respectively. Let
and 
denote the three induced three-manifolds. A
Heegaard triple-diagram naturally specifies a cobordism
between
these three-manifolds. The cobordism is constructed as follows.
Let 
denote the two-simplex, with vertices 
labeled clock-
wise, and let 
denote the edge from 
to 
where
Then, we form the identification space
Over the vertices of 
this space has corners, which can be naturally
smoothed out to obtain a smooth, oriented, four-dimensional cobordism
between the three-manifolds 
and 
as claimed.
We will call the cobordism 
described above a pair of pants

its natural
orientation, then

maps are homotopic through maps which are all Whitney triangles. We
let 
denote the space of homotopy classes of Whitney triangles
connecting x, y, and w.
Using a base-point
we obtain an intersection number

If the
space of homotopy classes of Whitney triangles 
is nonempty,
then it can be identified with 
in the case where
As explained in Section 8 of [85], the choice of base-point
gives rise to a map
A 
structure over X gives rise to a map
by the formula:
Under suitable admissibility hypotheses on the Heegaard diagrams, these
sums are finite (cf. Section 8 of [85]). Indeed, there are induced maps
on some of the other variants of Floer homology, and again, we refer the
interested reader to that discussion for a more detailed account.
Let X be a smooth, connected, oriented four-manifold with bound-
ary given by 
where 
and 
are connected, oriented
three-manifolds. We call such a four-manifold a cobordism from 
to
If X is a cobordism from 
to 
and 
is a
structure, then there is a naturally induced map

denotes the restriction of to 
This map is constructed
as follows. First assume that X is given as a collection of two-handles.
Then we claim that in the complement of the regular neighborhood of
a one-complex, X can be realized as a pair-of-pants cobordism, one of
whose boundary components is 
the other which is 
and the third
of which is a connected sum of copies of 
Next, pairing Floer
homology classes coming from 
with a certain canonically associated
Floer homology class on the connected sum of 
we obtain a map
using the holomorphic triangle construction as defined in Equation (6) to
obtain a the desired map to 
For the cases of one- and three-
handles, the associated maps are defined in a more formal manner. The
fact that these maps are independent (modulo an overall multiplication
by ±1) of the many choices which go into their construction is established
in [83].

Indeed, variants of this construction can be extended to the following
situation (again, see [83]): if X is a smooth, oriented cobordism from
to 
then there are induced maps (of 
modules) between the
corresponding Heegaard Floer homology groups, which make the squares
in the following diagrams commutate:
Naturality of the maps induced by cobordisms can be phrased as
follows. Suppose that

Sometimes, it is convenient to obtain topological invariants by sum-
ming over all 
structures. To this end, we write, for example,

in that case a little more care must be taken. For fixed X and

2.6. Doubly-pointed Heegaard diagrams and knot invariants.
Additional basepoints give rise to additional filtrations on Floer homolo-
gy. These additional filtrations can be given topological interpretations.
We consider the case of two basepoints.
Specifically, a Heegaard diagram 
for Y equipped with two
basepoints 
and in 
gives rise to a knot
in Y as follows. We connect 
and 
by a curve 
in
and also by another curve 
in 
By pushing 
and
into 
and 
respectively, we obtain a knot 
We call the
data 
a doubly-pointed Heegaard diagram compatible with
the knot 
Given a knot K in Y , one can always find such a
Heegaard diagram.
This can be thought of from the following Morse-theoretic point of
view. Let Y be an oriented three-manifold, equipped with a Riemannian
metric and a self-indexing Morse function
with one index 0 critical point, one index three critical point, and index
one (hence also index two) critical points. The knot K now is obtained
from the union of the two flows connecting the index 0 to the index 3
critical points which pass through 
and 
We call a Morse function
as in the above construction one which is compatible with K . Note
also that an ordering of 
and 
is equivalent to an orientation on K.
However, the invariants we construct can be shown to be independent of
the orientation of K, see [76], [88].
The simplest construction now is to consider a differential on
defined analogously to Equation (4), only now we count holomorphic
disks for which
More generally, we use the reference
point 
to construct the Heegaard Floer complex for Y, and then use
the additional basepoint 
to induce a filtration on this complex. We
describe this in detail for the case of knots in 
and using the chain
complex

There is a unique function 
satisfying the relation
for any 
and the additional symmetry
for all

more intrinsic characterization can be given in terms of relative
structures on the knot complement.) Clearly, if y appears in

nonzero multiplicity, then the homotopy class 
with
admits a holomorphic representative, and hence
Thus, any filtration satisfying Equation (8) induces a filtration on the
complex

It is shown in [76] and [88] that the chain homotopy type of this
filtration is a knot invariant. More precisely, recall that a filtered chain
complex is a chain complex C , together with a sequence of subcomplexes
indexed by 
where 
Our filtered
complexes are always bounded, meaning that for all sufficiently large

are chain maps, and also we have that
The construction we mentioned earlier – counting holomorphic disks
with 
can be thought of as the chain complex of the
associated graded object
The homology of this is also a knot invariant. We return to properties
of this invariant in Section 4.

3. Basic Properties
We outline here some of the basic properties of Heegaard Floer homology,
to give a flavor for its structure. We have not attempted to summarize
all of its properties; for additional properties, see [84], [82], [83]. We
focus on material which is useful for calculations: an exact sequence
and rational gradings. We then turn briefly to properties of the maps
induced on 
which have some important consequences explained
later, but they also shed light on the special role played by 
in Hee-
gaard Floer homology. In Section 3.4 we give a few sample calculations.
In Section 3.5, we describe one of the first applications of the rational
gradings: a constraint on the intersection forms of four-manifolds which
bound a given three-manifold, compare the gauge-theoretic analogue
of Frøyshov [32]. Finally, in Subsection 3.6, we sketch how the maps
induced by cobordisms give rise to an interesting invariant of closed,
smooth four-manifolds X with 
which are conjectured to
agree with the Seiberg-Witten invariants (cf. [107]).
3.1. Long exact sequences. An important calculational device is pro-
vided by the surgery long exact sequence. Long exact sequences of this
type were first explored by Floer in the context of instanton Floer ho-
mology [29], [7], see also [98], [57].
Heegaard Floer homology satisfies a surgery long exact sequence,
which we state presently.
Suppose that M is a three-manifold with
torus boundary, and fix three simple, closed curves 
and 
in
with
(where here the algebraic intersection number is calculated in 
ori-
ented as the boundary of M), so that

Theorem 3.1. Let 
and 
be related as above. Then, there
is a long exact sequence relating the Heegaard Floer homology groups:
The above theorem is proved in Theorem 9.12 of [84]. A variant for
Seiberg–Witten monopole Floer homology, with coefficients in 
is
proved in [57].

The maps in the long exact sequence have a four-dimensional inter-
pretation. To this end, note that there are two-handle cobordisms
connecting 
to 
(where we view 
When we work with
Heegaard Floer homology over the field

to 
in the above exact sequence is the map induced by the
corresponding cobordism
(i.e., obtained by summing the maps
induced by all 
structures over
When working over 
though,
one must make additional choices of signs to ensure that exactness holds.
3.2. Gradings. It is proved in Section 10 of [84] that if Y is a ratio-
nal homology three-sphere and 
is any 
structure over it, then
thus, this invariant is not a very subtle invari-
ant of three-manifolds. However, extra information can still be gleaned
from the interplay between 
and 
with the help of some ad-
ditional structure on Floer homology.
It is shown in [83] that when Y is an oriented rational homology
three-sphere and 
is a
structure over Y , the relative 
grading
on the Heegaard Floer homology described earlier can be lifted to an
absolute

characterized by the above property, together with the convention that
is supported in degree zero.
The image of

(the “correction terms” of [82]) which associates to each 
struc-
ture the minimal 
of any (nonzero) homogeneous element in
in the image of
Certain properties of the correction terms can be neatly summarized,
with the help of the following definitions.
The three-dimensional 
homology bordism group 
is the set of
equivalence classes of pairs
 where Y is a rational homology three-
sphere, and t is a
structure over Y , and the equivalence relation
identifies 
if there is a (connected, oriented, smooth)
cobordism W from 
to 
with

can be endowed with a 
structure 
whose restrictions to 
and
are 
and 
respectively. The connected sum operation endows this set
with the structure of an Abelian group (whose unit is 
endowed with
its unique 
structure).
There is a classical homomorphism
(see for instance [3]), defined as follows. Consider a rational homology
three-sphere

structure

whose first Chern class is trivial. In this case, the gradings are fixed so
that Equation (10) still holds. With these conventions, for example, for
a three-manifold with

3.3. Maps on 
As we have seen, for rational homology three-
spheres, the structure of 
is rather simple. There are corresponding
statements for the maps on 
induced by cobordisms.
Indeed, if W is a cobordism from

Moreover, if W is a cobordism from

3.4. Examples. We begin with some algebraic notions for describing
Heegaard Floer homology groups. Let 
denote the graded
module 
graded so that the element 1 has grading
A rational homology three-sphere Y is called an L-space if
has no torsion and the map from 
to 
is surjective. The
Floer homology of an L-space can be uniquely specified by its correction
terms. That is, if Y is an L-space, then
where here (and indeed throughout this subsection) the subscript denotes
absolute grading, and
By a direct inspection of the corresponding genus one Heegaard di-
agrams, one can see that 
is an L-space. Indeed, by a similar picture,
all lens spaces are L-spaces.
The absolute 
grading can also be calculated for lens spaces [82].
For example, for 
there are two
structures     and
with correction terms 1/4 and –1/4 respectively.
The Brieskorn homology sphere 
is also an L-space, and it
has
However, 
is not an L-space. Its Heegaard Floer homology
is determined by
A combinatorial description of the Heegaard Floer homology of Brieskorn
spheres and some other plumbings can be found in [73]; see also [82],
[70], [93].

3.5. Intersection form bounds. The correction terms of a rational
homology three-sphere Y constrain the intersection forms of smooth four-
manifolds which bound Y , according to the following result, which is
analogous to a gauge-theoretic result of Frøyshov [32]:
Theorem 3.2. Let Y be a rational homology and W be a smooth
four-manifold which bounds Y with negative-definite intersection form.
Then, for each 
structure 
over W, we have that
The above theorem gives strong restrictions on the intersection forms
of four-manifolds which bound a given three-manifold Y . In particular,
if Y is an integral homology three-sphere, following a standard argument
from Seiberg–Witten theory, compare [32], one can combine the above
theorem with a number-theoretic result of Elkies [22] to show that if
Y can be realized as the boundary of a smooth, negative-definite four-
manifold, then 
moreover if 
then if X has negative-
definite intersection form, then it must be diagonalizable.
3.6. Four-manifold invariants. The invariants associated to cobor-
disms can be used to construct an invariant for smooth, closed four-
manifolds which is very similar in spirit to the Seiberg–Witten invariant
for four-manifolds. Indeed, all known calculations support the conjecture
that the two smooth four-manifold invariants agree.
Suppose that X is a four-manifold with 
We delete four-
ball neighborhoods of two points in X , and view the result as a cobordism
from 
to 
which we can further subdivide along a separating hy-
persurface N into a union 
with the following properties:
is a cobordism from 
to N with
is a cobordism from N to 
with
restriction map 
is injective.
Such a separating hypersurface is called an admissible cut for X .
Let 
denote the kernel of the map
Of course, this is isomorphic to the group 
via an identification
coming from the homomorphism from Equation (7). Since
the maps on
induced by cobordisms are trivial (see Lemma 8.2
of [83]), and in particular the image of the map

326
Peter Ozsváth and Zoltán Szabó
lies in the kernel
of the map
(cf. Diagram (5). Moreover,
the map
factors through the projection of 
to 
(the
cokernel of the map 
from Diagram (5)). Thus, we can define
to be the composite:
where
is the natural isomorphism induced from
The definition of 
depends on a choice of admissible cut for X ,
but it is not difficult to verify [83] that 
is independent of this choice,
giving a well-defined four-manifold invariant.
The element 
is nontrivial for only finitely many 
struc-
tures over X. It vanishes for connected sums of four-manifolds with
cf. Theorem 1.3 of [83] (compare [14] and [107] for corre-
sponding results for Donaldson polynomials and Seiberg–Witten invari-
ants respectively). In fact, according to [81], if 
is a symplectic
four-manifold 
for the canonical 
structure 
associated
to the symplectic structure. This can be seen as an analogue of a the-
orem of Taubes [103] in the Seiberg–Witten context. Whereas Taubes’
theorem is proved by perturbing the Seiberg–Witten equations using a
symplectic two-form, the nonvanishing theorem of 
is proved by first
associating to 
a compatible Lefschetz pencil, which can be done
according to a theorem of Donaldson (cf. [15]) blowing up to obtain a
Lefschetz fibration, and then analyzing maps between Floer homology
induced by two-handles coming from the singular fibers in the Lefschetz
fibration, with the help of Theorem 3.1.
4. Knots in
We describe here constructions of Heegaard Floer homology applicable
to knots. For simplicity, we restrict attention to knots in 
This knot
invariant was introduced in [76] and also independently by Rasmussen
in [90], [88]. The calculations in Subsection 4.2 are based on the results

Heegaard Diagrams and Holomorphic Disks
327
of [78], [74], [75]. In Subsection 4.3, we discuss the fact that knot
Floer homology detects the Seifert genus of a knot. This result is proved
in [77]. The relationship with the four-ball genus is discussed in 4.4,
where we discuss the concordance invariant of [86] and [88], and also
the method of Owens and Strle [71]. Finally, in Subsection 4.5, we
discuss an application to the problem of knots with unknotting number
one from [72]. This application uses the Heegaard Floer homology of
the branched double-cover associated to a knot.
4.1. Knot Floer homology. In Subsection 2.6, we described a con-
struction which associates to an oriented knot in a three-manifold Y a
filtration of the chain complex 
Our aim here is to describe prop-
erties of this invariant when the ambient three-manifold is 
(although
we will be forced to generalize to the case of knots in a connected sum of
copies of 
as we shall see later). In this case, a knot 
in-
duces a filtration 
indexed by 
of the chain complex
whose homology is a single 
With some loss of information, we can
take the homology of the associated graded object, to obtain the “knot
Floer homology”
Note that this can be viewed as one bigraded Abelian group
We call here 
the filtration level and 
(the grading induced from the
Heegaard Floer complex 
the Maslov grading.
These homology groups satisfy a number of basic properties, which
we outline presently. Sometimes, it is simplest to state these properties
for 
the homology with rational coefficients:
The Euler characteristic is related to the Alexander polynomial of
K, 
by the following formula:

328
Peter Ozsváth and Zoltán Szabó
(it is interesting to compare this with [1], [65], and [25]). The sign
conventions on the Euler characteristic here are given by
Unlike the Alexander polynomial, the knot Floer homology is sensi-
tive to the chirality of the knot. Specifically, if 
denotes the mirror of
K (i.e., switch over- and under-crossings in a projection for K), then
Another symmetry these invariants enjoy is the following conjugation
symmetry:
refining the symmetry of the Alexander polynomial.
These groups also satisfy a Künneth principle for connected sums.
Specifically, let 
and 
be a pair of knots, and let 
denote
their connected sum. Then,
(see Corollary 7.2 of [76], and [88]). Of course, this can be seen as a
refinement of the fact that the Alexander polynomial is multiplicative
under connected sums of knots. These invariants also satisfy a “skein
exact sequence” (compare [29], [7], [82], [48]). To state it, we must
generalize to the case of oriented links in 
This can be done in the
following manner: an 
oriented link in 
gives rise, in a
natural way, to an 
oriented knot in 
Specif-
ically, we attach 
one-handles to 
so that the two feet of each
one-handle lie on different components of the link, and so that each link
component meets at least one foot. Next, we form the connected sum
of the various components of the link via standard strips which pass
through the one-handles. In this way, we view the link invariant for an
link 
as a knot invariant for the associated knot in
In this manner, the homology of the associated graded object – the
link Floer homology – is a sequence of graded Abelian groups
where here 
If L has an odd number of components, the Maslov
grading is a 
while if it has an even number of components,

the Maslov grading takes values in 
As a justification for this
convention, observe that the reflection formula, Equation (13), remains
true in the context of links.
Suppose that L is a link, and suppose that 
is a positive crossing of
some projection of L. Following the usual conventions from skein theory,
there are two other associated links, 
and 
where here 
agrees
with 
except that the crossing at 
is changed, while 
agrees with
except that here the crossing 
is resolved in a manner consistent
with orientations, as illustrated in Figure 4. There are two cases of the
skein exact sequence, according to whether or not the two strands of
which project to 
belong to the same component of
Suppose first that the two strands which project to 
belong to the
same component of 
In this case, the skein exact sequence reads:
where all the maps above respect the splitting of 
into sum-
mands (e.g. 
is mapped to 
Furthermore, the
maps to and from 
drop degree by 
The remaining map
from 
to 
does not necessarily respect the absolute
grading; however, it can be expressed as a sum of homogeneous maps,
none of which increases absolute grading. When the two strands belong
to different components, we obtain the following:

330
Peter Ozsváth and Zoltán Szabó
where V denotes the four-dimensional vector space
where here 
are one-dimensional pieces supported in degree ±1, while
is a two-dimensional piece supported in degree 0. Moreover, the maps
respect the decomposition into summands, where the 
summand of the
middle piece 
is given by
The shifts in the absolute gradings work just as they did in the previous
case.
The skein exact sequence is, of course, very closely related to The-
orem 3.1. Indeed, its proof proceeds by using the surgery long exact
sequence associated to an unknot which links the crossing one is consid-
ering, and analyzing the behaviour of the induced maps (cf. Section 8
of [76]).
4.2. Calculations of knot Floer homology. It is useful to have a
concrete description of the generators of the knot Floer complex in terms
of the combinatorics of a knot projection. In fact, the data we fix at first
is an oriented knot projection (with at most double-point singularities),
equipped with a choice of distinguished edge 
which appears in the
closure of the unbounded region A in the planar projection. We call this
data a decorated projection for K. We denote the planar graph of the
projection by G.
We can construct a doubly-pointed Heegaard diagram compatible
with K from a decorated projection of K, as follows.
Let B denote the other region which contains the edge in its closure,
and let 
be the boundary of a regular neighborhood of G, thought of
as a one-complex in 
(i.e., if our projection has 
double-points, then
has genus 
we orient 
as 
We associate to each
region 
an attaching circle 
(which follows along the
boundary of 
To each crossing 
in G we associate an attaching circle
as indicated in Figure 5. In addition, we let 
denote the meridian of
the knot, chosen to be supported in a neighborhood of the distinguished
edge
Each vertex 
is contained in four (not necessarily distinct) regions.
Indeed, it is clear from Figure 5, that in a neighborhood of each vertex
there are at most four intersection points of 
with circles correspond-
ing to the four regions which contain

intersection points with 
if is a corner for the unbounded region A.)
Moreover, the circle corresponding to 
meets the circle 
in a single
point (and is disjoint from the other circles). Placing one reference point
and on each side of 
we obtain a doubly-pointed Heegaard diagram
for 
compatible with K.
We can now describe the generators 
for the knot Floer
homology in terms of the planar graph G of the projection.
Definition 4.1. A Kauffman state (cf. [45]) for a decorated knot
projection of K is a map which associates to each vertex of G one of the
four in-coming quadrants, so that:
the quadrants associated to distinct vertices are subsets of distinct
regions in
none of the quadrants is a corner of the distinguished regions A or
B (whose closure contains the edge

332
Peter Ozsváth and Zoltán Szabó
If K is a knot with a decorated projection, it is straightforward to
see that the intersection points 
for the corresponding Heegaard
diagram correspond to Kauffman states for the projection. Note that
Kauffman states have an alternative interpretation, as maximal trees in
the “black graph” associated to a checkerboard coloring of the comple-
ment of G (cf. [45]).
We can also describe the filtration level and the Maslov grading of a
Kauffman state in combinatorial terms of the decorated knot projection.
To describe the filtration level, note that the orientation on the knot
K associates to each vertex 
a distinguished quadrant whose
boundary contains both edges which point towards the vertex 
We
call this the quadrant which is “pointed towards” at 
There is al-
so a diagonally opposite region which is “pointed away from” (i.e., its
boundary contains the two edges pointing away from

The filtration level associated to a Kauffman state, then, is given by the
sum
Note that the function 
is the T-power appearing for the contribu-
tion of 
to the symmetrized Alexander polynomial, see [2], [44].
The Maslov grading 
is defined analogously.
First, at each
vertex 
we define the local grading contribution 
This local
contributions is nonzero on only one of the four quadrants – the one
which is pointed away from at 
At this quadrant, the grading contri-
bution is minus the sign 
of the crossing, as illustrated in Figure 8.
Now, the grading 
of a Kauffman state 
is defined by the formula
A verification of these formulas can be found in Theorem 1.2 of [78].
It is clear from the above formulas that if K has an alternating proj
ection, then 
is independent of the choice of state x. It

follows that if we use the chain complex associated to this Heegaard di-
agram, then there are no differentials in the knot Floer homology, and
indeed, its rank is determined by its Euler characteristic. Indeed, by cal-
culating the constant, we get the following result, proved in Theorem 1.3
of [78]:

be an alternating knot in the three-
sphere, and write its symmetrized Alexander polynomial as

entirely in dimension
and indeed
Thus, for alternating knots, this choice of Heegaard diagram is re-
markably successful. However, in general, there are differentials one must
grapple with, and these admit, at present, no combinatorial description
in terms of Kauffman states. However, they do respect certain additional
filtrations which can be described in terms of states, and this property,
together with some additional tricks, can be used to give calculations
of knot Floer homology groups in certain cases (cf. [75], [18]). As a
particular example, these filtrations are used in [75] to show that knot
Floer homology of the eleven-crossing Kinoshita–Terasaka knot (a knot
whose Alexander polynomial is trivial) differs from that of its Conway
mutant.
In a different direction, some knots admit Heegaard diagrams on a
genus one surface. For these knots, calculation of the differentials be-
comes a purely combinatorial matter (cf. Section 6 of [76] and also [90],
[88], [37]).

Sometimes, it is more convenient to use more abstract methods to
calculate knot Floer homology. In particular, there is a relationship
between knot Floer homology and the Heegaard Floer homology three-
manifolds obtained by surgery along K (cf. [76], [88]). With the help
of this relationship, we obtain the following structure for the knot Floer
homology of a knot for which some positive surgery is an L-space (proved
in Theorem 1.2 of [74]):

is a knot for which there is
a positive integer 
for which

For example, all (right-handed) torus knots satisfy the hypothesis of
this theorem. (Recal that if 
denotes the right-handed 
torus
knot, then 
is a lens space.) The knot Floer homology of the
(3, 4) torus knot is illustrated in Figure 9. The above theorem can be
fruitfully thought of from three perspectives: as a source of examples of
knot Floer homology calculations (for example, a calculation of the knot
Floer homology of torus knots), as a restriction on knots which admit
L-space surgeries (for example, it shows that if 
admits a lens
space surgery, then all the coefficients of its Alexander polynomial satisfy
or as a restriction on L-spaces which can arise as surgeries on
knots in 
(cf. [74]).
4.3. Knot Floer homology and the Seifert genus. A knot
can be realized as the boundary of an embedded, orientable surface in
Such a surface is called a Seifert surface for K, and the minimal
genus of any Seifert surface for K is called its Seifert genus, denoted
Of course, a knot has 
if and only if it is the unknot.
The knot Floer homology of K detects the Seifert genus, and in
particular it distinguishes the unknot, according to the following result

336
Peter Ozsváth and Zoltán Szabó
proved in [77]. To state it, we first define the degree of the knot Floer
homology to be the integer
Theorem 4.4. For any knot
Given a Seifert surface of genus 
for K , one can construct a Hee-
gaard diagram for which all the points in 
have filtration level
This gives at once the bound
(this result is analogous to a classical bound on the genus of a knot in
terms of the degree of its Alexander polynomial).
The inequality in the other direction is much more subtle, involving
much of the theory described so far. First, one relates the degree of
the knot Floer homology by a similar quantity defined using the Floer
homology of the zero-surgery 
Next, one appeals to a theorem
of Gabai [36], according to which if K is a knot with Seifert genus
then 
admits a taut foliation 
whose first Chern class

is 
times a generator for 
The taut foliation nat-
urally induces a symplectic structure on 
according to
a result of Eliashberg and Thurston [21], which, according to a recent
result of Eliashberg [20], [23] can be embedded in a closed symplectic
four-manifold X (indeed, one can arrange for 
to divide the four-
manifold X into two pieces with
The nonvanishing of the
four-manifold invariant 
for a symplectic four-manifold can then be
used to prove that the Heegaard Floer homology of 
is nontrivial
in the 
structure gotten by restricting the canonical
struc-
ture 
of the ambient symplectic four-manifold – i.e., this is the
structure belonging to the foliation 
The details of this argument are
given in [77].
Since the generators of knot Floer homology can be thought of from
a Morse-theoretic point of view as simultaneous trajectories of gradi-
ent flow-lines, Theorem 4.4 immediately gives a curious Morse-theoretic
characterization of the Seifert genus of K, as the minimum over all Morse
functions compatible with K of the maximal filtration level of any si-
multaneous trajectory.
4.4. The four-ball genus. A knot 
can be viewed as a knot
in the boundary of the four-ball, and as such, it can be realized as the
boundary of a smoothly embedded oriented surface in the four-ball. The
minimal genus of any such surface is called the four-ball genus of the
knot, and it is denoted 
Obviously, 
In general,
is quite difficult to calculate.
Lower bounds on 
can be obtained from Heegaard Floer ho-
mology. The construction involves going deeper into the knot filtration.
Specifically, as explained explained in Subsection 2.6, the filtered chain
homotopy type of the sequence of inclusions
is a knot invariant; passing to the homology of the associated graded
object constitutes some loss of information. There is a quantity asso-
ciated to the filtered complex which goes beyond knot Floer homology,
and that is the integer 
which is defined by
It is proved in [86], [88] that

The above inequality can be used to prove a property of which un-
derscores its analogy with the correction terms 
described earlier.
To put this result into context, we give a definition. Two knots 
and
are said to be concordant if there is a smoothly embedded cylinder
C in 
with 
for 
The set of con-
cordance classes of knots can be made into an Abelian group, under the
connected sum operation. It follows from Inequality (18), together with
the additivity of under connected sums, that 
gives a homomorphism
from the concordance group of knots to
Another such homomorphism is provided by 
In fact, ac-
cording to Theorem 4.2,
when K is alternating. By contrast, Theorem 4.3 gives many examples
where Equation (19) fails. Indeed, combining Theorem 4.3 with Theo-
rem 4.4 and Equation (12) and (18), we see that if K is a knot which
admits a positive surgery which is an L-space surgery, then
and in particular, if 
then
Note that the fact that 
is given by the above formula was con-
jectured by Milnor and first proved by Kronheimer and Mrowka using
gauge theory [54].
In [61], see also [62] Livingston shows that properties of the concor-
dance invariant 
(specifically, the fact that it is a homomorphism
whose absolute value bounds the four-ball genus of K, and satisfies Equa-
tion (20)) leads to the result that if K is the closure of a positive on
strands with 
crossings, then
The second of these equations was proved first by Rudolph [92] using the
local Thom conjecture proved by Kronheimer and Mrowka [54]. Further
links between the Thurston-Bennequin invariant and 
are explored by
Plamenevskaya, see [87].
A different method for bounding 
is given by Owens and Strle
in [71], where they describe a method using the correction terms for the

Heegaard Diagrams and Holomorphic Disks

branched double-cover of 
along K, 
Under favorable circum-
stances, their method gives an obstruction for Murasugi’s bound
to being sharp. Specifically, taking the branched double-cover 
of
a surface F in 
which bounds K, one obtains a four-manifold which
bounds 
When F is a surface with 
the branched
double 
is a four-manifold with definite intersection form, whose
second Betti number is 
Comparing this construction with the
inequality from Theorem 3.2, one obtains restrictions on the correction
terms of 
which sometimes can rule out the existence of such sur-
faces F.
4.5. Unknotting numbers. Recall that the unknotting number of a
knot K, denoted 
is the the minimal number of crossing-changes
required to unknot K. An unknotting of K can be realized as an im-
mersed disk in 
which bounds 
Resolving the self-intersections, one
gets the inequality 
However, there are circumstances
where one needs better bounds (most strikingly, for any nontrivial slice
knot). In [72], we describe an obstruction to knots K having
in terms of the correction terms of the branched double-cover of K .
This construction works best in the case where K is alternating. In
this case, the branched double-cover 
is an L-space (cf. [79]). A
classical construction of Montesinos [66] shows that if 
then
can be obtained as ±D/2 surgery on another knot C in 
where
here D denotes the determinant of the knot K
(i.e., 
On the one hand, correction terms for an
L-space which is realized as

in 
satisfy certain symmetries (cf. Theorem 4.1 of [72]); on the other
hand, the correction terms of the branched double-cover of an alternat-
ing knot can be calculated explicitly by classical data associated to an
alternating projection of K (cf. [79]). Rather than recalling the result
here, we content ourselves with illustrating an alternating knot K (listed
as 
in the Alexander-Briggs notation) whose unknotting number was
previously unknown, but which can now be shown to have
using these techniques.
5. Problems and Questions
The investigation of Heegaard Floer homology naturally leads us to the
following problems and questions.
Perhaps the most important problem in this circle of ideas is the
following:
Problem 1. Give a purely combinatorial calculation of Heegaard
Floer homology or, more generally, the Heegaard Floer functor.
In certain special cases, combinatorial calculations can be given, for
example [73], [78]. This problem would be very interesting to solve even
for certain restricted classes of three-manifolds, for example for those
which fiber over the circle, compare. [41], [97], [96] [9].
In a related direction, it is simpler to consider the case of knots in
Recall that in Section 4 we showed that the generators of the knot
Floer complex can be thought of as Kauffman states.
Question 2. Is there a combinatorial description of the differential
on Kauffman states whose homology gives the knot Floer homology of K.
It is intriguing to compare this with Khovanov’s new invariants for
links, see [48]. These invariants have a very similar structure to the knot
Floer homology considered here, except that their Euler characteristic
gives the Jones polynomial, see also [43], [47], [46], [49] [5]. Indeed,
the similarities are further underscored by the work of E-S. Lee [58],
who describes a spectral sequence which converges to a vector space of
dimension 
where 
is the number of components of L, see also [89].
In a similar vein, it would be interesting to give combinatorial calcu-
lations of the numerical invariants arising from Heegaard Floer homolo-
gy, specifically, the correction terms 
or the concordance invariant
An intriguing conjecture of Rasmussen [89] relates 
with a nu-
merical invariant coming from Khovanov homology.

341
Problem 3. Establish the conjectured relationship between Heegaard
Floer homology and Seiberg–Witten theory.
There are two approaches one might take to this problem. One di-
rect, analytical approach would be to analyze moduli spaces of solutions
to the Seiberg–Witten equations over a three-manifold equipped with a
Heegaard decomposition. Another approach would involve an affirma-
tive answer to the following question:
Question 4. Is there an axiomatic characterization of Heegaard Flo-
er homology?
A Floer functor is a map which associates to any closed, oriented
three-manifold Y a 
Abelian group 
and to any cobor-
dism W from 
to 
a homorphism 
which is
natural under composition of cobordisms, and which induce exact se-
quences for triples of three-manifolds 
which are related as in
the hypotheses of Theorem 3.1. It is interesting to observe that if 
is a
natural transformation between Floer functors 
and 
to 
and
then if 
induces an isomorphism 
then
induces isomorphisms for all three-manifolds
This can be proved from Kirby calculus, following the outline laid out
in [7]. We know from [57] that monopole Floer homology (taken with
coefficients) is a Floer functor in this sense, and also (Theorem 3.1)
that Heegaard Floer homology is a Floer functor. Unfortunately, this
still falls short of giving an axiomatic characterization: one needs axioms
which are sufficient to assemble a natural transformation
Problem 5. Develop cut-and-paste techniques for calculating the
Heegaard Floer homology of Y in terms of data associated to its pieces.
As a special case, one can ask how the knot Floer homology of a
satellite knot can be calculated from data associated to the companion
and the pattern. Of course, the Künneth principle for connected sums
can be viewed as an example of this. Another example, of Whitehead
doubling, has been studied by Eftekhary [19].
We have seen that the set of 
structures for which the Heegaard
Floer homology of Y is nontrivial determines the Thurston norm of Y.
It is natural to ask what additional topological information is contained
in the groups themselves. It is possible that these groups contain further
information about foliations over Y.

342
Peter Ozsváth and Zoltán Szabó
We specialize to the case of knot Floer homology. If 
is a
fibered knot of genus 
then it is shown in [80] that
Question 6. If
is a knot with genus and
does it follow that K is fibered?
Calculations give some evidence that the answer to the above ques-
tion is positive.
Question 7.   If
is a knot, is there an explicit relationship
between the fundamental group of 
 and the knot Floer homology
The above question is, of course, very closely related to the following:
Question 8. Is there an explicit relationship between the Heegaard
Floer homology and the fundamental group of Y?
For example, one could try to relate the Heegaard Floer homology
with the instanton Floer homology of Y. (Note, though, that presently
instanton Floer homology is defined only for a restricted class of three-
manifolds, cf. [7].) A link between Seiberg–Witten theory and instanton
Floer homology is given by Pidstrygach and Tyurin’s PU(2) monopole
equations [24]. This connection has been successfully exploited in Kro-
nheimer and Mrowka’s recent proof that all knots in 
have Property
P [51].
The conjectured relationship with Seiberg–Witten invariants raises
further questions. Specifically, Bauer and Furuta [35], [6] have con-
structed refinements of the Seiberg–Witten invariant which use proper-
ties of the Seiberg–Witten equations beyond merely their solution counts.
Correspondingly, these invariants carry topological information about
four-manifolds beyond their usual Seiberg–Witten invariants. A three-
dimensional analogue is studied in work of Manolescu and Kronheimer,
see [63], [50]
Question 9. Is there a refinement of the four-manifold invariant
defined using Heegaard Floer homology which captures the information
in the Bauer-Furuta construction?
In the opposite direction, it is natural to study the following:
Problem 10. Construct a gauge-theoretic analogue of knot Floer
homology.

Heegaard Diagrams and Holomorphic Disks
343
Recall from Section 3 that there is a class of three-manifolds whose
Heegaard Floer homology is as simple as possible, the so-called L-spaces.
This class of three-manifolds includes all lens spaces, and more gener-
ally branched double-covers of alternating knots. The set of L-spaces
is closed under connected sums. According to [77], L-spaces admit no
(coorientable) taut foliations. A striking theorem of Némethi [70] char-
acterizes those L-spaces which are boundaries of negative-definite plumb-
ings of spheres: they are the links of rational surface singularities. Note
also that there is an analogous class of three-manifolds in the context of
Seiberg–Witten monopole Floer homology (cf. [57]).
Question 11. Is there a topological characterization of L-spaces
(i.e., which makes no reference to Floer homology)?

Exact Lagrangian Submanifolds in
and the Graded Kronecker Quiver
Paul Seidel
S. University Ave
Chicago, USA
The topology of Lagrangian submanifolds gives rise to some of the most
basic, and also most difficult, questions in symplectic geometry. We have
many tools that can be brought to bear on these questions, but each one
is effective only in a special class of situations, and their interrelation is
by no means clear. The present paper is a piece of shamelessly biased
propaganda for a relatively obscure approach, using Fukaya categories.
We will test-ride this machinery in a particularly simple case, where the
computations are very explicit, and where the outcome can be nicely
compared to known results. For clarity, the level of technical sophistica-
tion has been damped down a little, and therefore the resulting theorem
is not quite the best one can get. Also, in view of the expository nature
of the paper, we do not take the most direct path to the conclusion,
but instead choose a more scenic route bringing the reader past some
classical questions from linear algebra.

and Viterbo’s approaches should still admit some technical refinements,

1. Introduction

In the first place, Fukaya categories provide a convenient way of packag-
ing the information obtained from Lagrangian Floer cohomology groups.
We will find it convenient to include noncompact Lagrangian subman-
ifolds with a fixed behaviour at infinity, so we choose a point on
and consider the corresponding cotangent  fibre
The objects
of the Donaldson-Fukaya category 
are constructed from con-
nected Lagrangian submanifolds 
subject to the following restric-
tions:
L is either compact, or else agrees with 
outside a compact subset.
For any smooth disc with boundary on L,
the symplectic area 
vanishes;
Similarly, the Maslov number of any disc 
which is a relative Chern
class 
must vanish. As remarked above, this
implies orientability of L;
To be more precise, the objects are Lagrangian branes 
which means
Lagrangian submanifolds L as described above coming with certain choic-
es of additional data:
A grading 
which is a lift of the Lagrangian phase function
to a real-valued function. This exists because of
the zero Maslov condition, but clearly there are infinitely many dif-
ferent choices, differing by integer constants. We write 
for the
brane obtained by shifting the grading down by
A spin structure on L, and a fiat complex vector bundle
These
are actually coupled, in the sense that changing the spin structure

is homeomorphic to 
In contrast, the question of whether
L needs to be diffeomorphic to the standard sphere is hard to attack,
and issues about its Lagrangian isotopy class seem to be entirely be-
yond current capabilities (for 
In the course of proving Theorem
1, we will show that any submanifold L satisfying its assumptions is
“Floer-theoretically equivalent” (in rigorous language, isomorphic in the
Donaldson-Fukaya category) to the zero-section. This is a much weaker
equivalence relation than Lagrangian isotopy, but still sufficiently strong
to imply properties (1) and (4) above.
2. The Donaldson–Fukaya Category

the corresponding complex line bundle (with monodromy ±1), does
not change our Lagrangian brane.
This list is no doubt baffling to the non-specialist reader, but its purpose
is just to make the Lagrangian Floer cohomology groups well-defined and
as nicely behaved as possibly. We need these to provide the rest of the
category structure, namely, the morphisms between two objects are the
Floer cohomology groups in degree zero, with twisted coefficients in our
flat vector bundles:
and composition of morphisms is provided by the pair-of-pants (or more
appropriately pseudo-holomorphic triangle) product
Some basic reminders about Floer cohomology are in order. First of
all, one can recover the full Floer groups by considering morphisms into
shifted objects, 
The endomorphism
group of any brane equipped with the trivial line bundle is its usual
cohomology
More generally, if we take L with a fixed grading and spin structure, and
equip it with two different flat vector bundles 
the resulting two
branes satisfy
In our arguments, three simple Lagrangian submanifolds in M will
be prominent. One is the zero-section Z , which we make into a brane
by choosing some grading and equipping it with the trivial line bundle.
The second is the  fibre
treated in the same way, and the third is
the image 
under the Dehn twist 
which inherits a brane
structure from

Part (1) is obvious, because the Lagrangian submanifolds intersect
in a single point. For the rest, one needs to remember that Floer coho-
mology of a pair of noncompact Lagrangian submanifolds is defined by

A triangulated category lurks wherever long exact sequences of (any kind
of) cohomology groups appear. The axioms of exact triangles formalize
some nontrivial properties of such sequences, thus allowing one to manip-
ulate them more efficiently. We will give an informal description of the
axioms, which is neither exhaustive nor totally rigorous, but which suf-
fices for our purpose. Let 
be a category in which the morphism spaces
between any two objects are complex vector spaces. Hav-
ing a triangulated structure on 
gives one certain ways of constructing
new objects out of old ones. First of all, we assume that 
is additive,
which means that one can form the direct sum 
of two objects,
with the expected properties. Secondly, one can shift or translate an
object by an integer amount, 
which allows one to define
higher degree morphism spaces 
We
will denote the direct sum of all these spaces by 
As a
side-remark which will be useful later, note that by using direct sums
and shifts, one can define the tensor product 
of any object X
with a finite-dimensional graded complex vector space V: choose a ho-
mogeneous basis 
for V, and set

References. All that we have discussed belongs to the basics of Floer
homology theory. Gradings and twisted coefficients were both introduced
in [10]; for the use of spin structures see [6]; for the product (1) see [5]
(these are by no means the only possible references).

is the following: to any morphism 
one can associate a new
object, the mapping cone 
which is unique up to isomorphism.
This can be interpreted as measuring the failure of 
to be an isomor-
phism: at one extreme, if 
then 
and on the
other hand, 
is an isomorphism iff 
is the zero object.
Mapping cones come with canonical maps
such that the composition of any two arrows in the
diagram
is zero. By applying Hom(Y, –) or Hom(–, Y) for some object Y one
gets long exact sequences of vector spaces,
which is what we were talking about at the beginning of the section.
Diagrams of the form (5) (and isomorphic ones) are called exact triangles,
and drawn rolled up like this:

Loosely speaking, the formalism of triangulated categories puts the bound-
ary operator in long exact sequences on the same footing as the other
two maps. To round off our picture, we look at the situation where one
has two morphisms
Since the mapping cone measures the failure of a map to be an iso-
morphism, it seems intuitive that these defects should somehow add up
under composition, and indeed there is an exact triangle
This is part of the “octahedral axiom” of triangulated structures (the
name comes from a more complicated diagram, which describes vari-
ous compatibility conditions between the maps in (8) and those in the
triangles defining
The following simple construction arose first in algebraic geome-
try as part of the theory of mutations. Suppose that 
is a trian-
gulated category in which the graded vector spaces
are finite-dimensional. One can define the tensor products 
and

By definition, this means
that

and similarly for 
Unfortunately, the axioms of triangulated cate-
gories are not quite strong enough to make 
into actual functors.
Still, these operations can be shown to have nice behaviour, such as tak-
ing direct sums to direct sums, and cones to cones (up to isomorphism).
Exact Lagrangian submanifolds
355

We will now come to the geometric interpretation of T, 
Con-
trary to what the reader may have hoped, the Donaldson-Fukaya cate-
gory 
is not triangulated. It does have a shift operation with
the correct properties, namely the change of grading for a Lagrangian
brane, but neither direct sums not cones exist in general. It is an open
question whether one can define a triangulated version of this cate-
gory by geometric means, such as including Lagrangian submanifolds
with self-intersections. Meanwhile, there is a purely algebraic construc-
tion in terms of twisted complexes, which yields a triangulated category
containing 
as a full subcategory. The gist of this is
simply to add on new objects in a formal way, so that the requirements
of a triangulated category are satisfied. The details are slightly less
straightforward than this description may suggest, and involve the use
of Fukaya’s higher order
product structures on Floer cohomology,
but for the purposes of this paper, all we need is the knowledge that
exists, and the following fact:
Theorem 3. For any object

of triangulated categories. For mutations see the papers in [14]. The
construction of 
is outlined in [10]. The long exact sequence in
Floer cohomology which is a consequence of Theorem 3 was introduced
in [17]. The argument given there can easily be adapted to prove the
result as stated, see [16] for an explanation.
We will now switch gears slightly. The representation theory of quivers
is a subject with deceptively humble appearance. Superficially, it is no
more than a convenient way of reformulating certain questions in linear
algebra, but in many cases these reveal themselves to be equivalent to
much less elementary problems in other areas, such as algebraic geome-
try. We will only need a very simple instance of the theory, namely the

4. The Graded Kronecker Quiver

Exact Lagrangian submanifolds
357
By definition, a representation of (9) consists of two finite-dimensional
graded 
spaces V, W, together with linear maps 
of
degree zero and 
of degree 
respectively. Two representa-
tions (V, W, 
and 
are isomorphic if there are graded
linear isomorphisms 
such that
Of course, any representation splits into a direct sum of in-
decomposable ones. The Kronecker quiver is nice in that the latter can
be classified explicitly:
Proposition 4. Any indecomposable representation is isomorphic,
up to a common shift in the gradings of both vector spaces, to one of the
following:

This is actually simple enough to be tackled using only linear al-
gebra, but the meaning of the classification becomes much clearer in
algebro-geometric terms. To any representation (V, W, 
of (9) one
can associate a map of algebraic vector bundles on

and the induced
action on X . Then the sheaves 
are naturally equivariant,
and if one equips V, W with the 
whose weights are given by
the grading, 
becomes an equivariant map. At this point, the
usual procedure would be to look at the kernel and cokernel of (10), and
to use Grothendieck’s splitting theorem for holomorphic vector bundles
on 
to derive Proposition 4, but we prefer a sleeker and more high-
tech approach using triangulated categories. The category 
of
equivariant coherent sheaves admits a full embedding into a triangulated
category, its derived category 
One can look at the cone
of (10) as an object 
in that category. A computation using the long
exact sequences (6) shows that the morphisms between two such cones
are precisely the homomorphisms of quiver representations, which means

that the cone construction embeds the category of representations of our
quiver as a full subcategory into 
In particular, indecom-
posable representations must give rise to indecomposable objects
Grothendieck’s theorem extends easily to the derived category and
to the equivariant case: each indecomposable object of

A straightforward computation of cohomology groups identifies the vari-
ous

our proof of that result.
References. The analogue of Proposition 4 for the ungraded quiver
is due to Kronecker, and is explained in textbooks on the representation
theory of finite-dimensional algebras [1, 2]. The connection with coher-
ent sheaves is well-known. The fact that an indecomposable object of the
derived category is actually a single sheaf is a general property of abelian
categories of homological dimension one, and is used extensively in pa-
pers about mirror symmetry on elliptic curves [13, 11]. Grothendieck’s
paper is [8].

Because the Euler characteristic of Floer cohomology is the ordinary
intersection number, it follows that

the conditions of that theorem, they would give rise to isomorphic objects
in the Fukaya category by Lemma7, hence their Floer cohomology would
be equal to the ordinary cohomology of each. Since that is nonzero, the
two Lagrangian submanifolds necessarily intersect, which is part (4).
The remaining statement (3) about the fundamental group is slightly
more complicated. Take an indecomposable flat complex vector bundle

ing (3) to this pair of branes, one finds that

One of the most surprising things in algebraic geometry is the fact
that algebraic varieties over the complex numbers benefit from a collec-
tion of metric properties which strongly influence their topological and
geometric shapes. The existence of a Kähler metric leads to all sorts
of Hodge theoretical restrictions on the homotopy types of algebraic va-
rieties. On the other hand, a sparse collection of examples shows that
the remaining liberty is nontrivially large. Paradoxically, with all of this
information, the research field remains as wide open as it was many
decades ago, because the gap between the known restrictions, and the
known examples of what can occur, only seems to grow wider and wider
the more closely we look at it.
In spite of the differential-geometric nature of the questions and
methods, the origins of the situation are very algebraic. We look at
subvarieties of projective space over the complex numbers. The main

over-arching problem in algebraic geometry is to understand the classifi-
cation of algebro-geometric objects. The topology of the usual complex-
valued points of a variety plays an important role, because the topological
type is a locally constant function on any classifying space. Thus the
partitioning of the classification problem according to topological type
provides a coarse, and more calculable, alternative to the partition by
connected components. Furthermore, the topology of a variety strongly
influences its geometric properties. A sociological observation is that
the quest for understanding the topology of algebraic varieties has led
to a rich set of techniques which found applications elsewhere, even in
physics.
Perhaps a word about the choice of ground field is appropriate. One
could also look at the shapes of the real points of real algebraic varieties.
However, by Weierstrass approximation, pretty much anything can arise
if you let the degree get big enough. Thus the classical question in this
case is “which shapes can occur for a given degree?” This is so much more
difficult that it constitutes a separate subject.1 Taking the algebraically
closed field of complexes means that we do not unwittingly leave any
points out of the picture, so it seems reasonable to regard this as one
possible canonical choice. Historically at least, and probably also for
some philosophical reasons, investigations into the topology of complex
varieties have in turn been mirrored in arithmetic algebraic geometry
over other fields. A lot of what we say for complex Hodge theory could
also apply to the 
versions.
It is a standard norm for mathematical papers, to discuss positive
contributions to the collective knowledge. I would like to take advantage
of the present opportunity, to focus on a zone where we have little or
no knowledge, and where I have nothing new to report, in any case. I
apologize therefore for the very vague nature of most of the discussion.
I hope that the references2 will give readers a place to look for what-
ever details are available. With our purpose stated this way, we should
normally try to cover most of modern Kähler geometry. However, this
would be unreasonable, because for many parts of the subject I would

(do a recursive search on the references in [28]) could be of help in the complex case
we are discussing here.

not have anything further to say than just repeating what would be in
the references. So, toning down our ambitions a little bit, we get to the
description of what I really would like to talk about, which is to isolate
a certain family of questions which seem important, and about which
very little seems to be known: how to construct algebraic (or Kähler)
varieties with interesting topological behavior.
To get going, recall that projective space is endowed with the Fubini–
Study metric, a hermitian metric which has the Kähler property which
we now explain in two ways. The first way is to note that if you write the
matrix for the hermitian metric in terms of a local system of holomorphic
coordinates, then transform the tensor product between 
and
to a wedge product, you get an alternating form 
It is well-defined
independently of the choice of coordinates. The Kähler condition is that
the two-form 
is closed, i.e. it gives a symplectic structure. The second
definition is to say that a metric is Kähler if at each point there exists
a holomorphic system of coordinates in which the matrix for the metric
is equal to the identity, up to an error term in 
(rather than just
as would be the case for an arbitrary choice of coordinates). The good
system is called an osculating system of coordinates. This second point
of  view leads directly to the famous Kähler identities
where 
and
are the (1, 0) and (0, 1)-components of the de
Rham differential, and 
is the pointwise adjoint of the operation
The correspondence between hermitian metrics and (1, 1)-forms is
compatible with restriction to subvarieties, as is the Kähler condition
so any smooth subvariety 
inherits a Kähler metric
too. This extrinsic description can be modified so as to seem more
intrinsic, by saying that the Kähler metric is obtained as the Chern
(1, 1)-form of a positively curved metric on a line bundle L over X: in
the projective case L is the pullback of the tautological bundle
on projective space. In a philosophical sense, a Kähler metric should
of referential information available, by searching starting with the authors cited in
our bibliography. A crucial recent improvement has been the inclusion of forward
searching to get future papers referring to a given paper. This results in such a vast
amount of information that even our rather long reference list can only be considered
as a sampling.

be thought of as corresponding to a curvature of a connection on a line
bundle; this will only be precise if the cohomology class 
is integral.
On the other hand, there may be algebraic varieties, or other more exotic
things such as algebraic spaces, which do not have projective embeddings
and so are not Kähler. Nonetheless, the main intention of the theory
is to investigate the properties of projective varieties. There are some
significant differences between the Kähler and the projective situations
[194], but in spite of those we will often mix things up, so that questions
posed for one class of varieties might well be reinterpreted for any other
related class.
When a variety X has a Kähler metric 
the Kähler identities imply
that the Laplacians for 
and 
are proportional. This leads3 to the
Hodge decomposition for cohomology (certainly when X is compact, and
soms results are possible in the noncompact case too [63] [156] [183]
[201]). It gives us a first Hodge-theoretic result about the homotopy of
X: if is odd then 
is even.4 Johnson and Rees
point out that this result carries over easily to the case of cohomology
with coefficients in a local system with finite monodromy group [104],
and they use it to show that certain free products cannot occur. This
was extended by Arapura [11] to cover certain amalgamated products,
in a more elementary version of Gromov’ general theorem that
can never be a nontrivial amalgamated product [88].
Treating the noncompact case by compactifying, resolving singular-
ities,5 and then using the logarithmic de Rham complex, leads to mixed
Hodge structures on the cohomology in this case [63] [183] [201] [173]
[172] [149].  Combining with simplicial techniques gives mixed Hodge
structures on singular varieties too.
A classical technique for analyzing the topology of algebraic varieties
is Lefschetz devissage [63]. One can arrange (by a birational transfor-
mation) to have a  fibration
whose fibers are
–1-dimensional
varieties, a finite number of them singular (that is to say more singular
than the others). The topological properties of X are determined by the
3 Some good references for the theory starting from the beginning are [87], [104],
[195], [27].
4This apparently characterizes exactly those algebraic surfaces which are pro-
jective, as was stated in Simanca’s Math Review MR 1723831 of [10] but I did not
find the actual reference for it.

topological properties of the general fiber, the way its topology is trans-
formed under the monodromy representation of
and the way the singular fibers fill things in. This led to things such as
Zariski’s calculations of fundamental groups, as well as proofs of certain
parts of the Lefschetz theorems (fuller and easier proofs being obtained
using the Hodge decomposition for cohomology). Griffiths proposed to
throw Hodge theory into this situation, namely to look at how the Hodge
decomposition of the cohomology of the fibers varies. He discovered the
fundamental Griffiths transversality relation governing the variance of
the Hodge filtration, and developed much of the basic theory of varia-
tions of Hodge structure which shows how this family of Hodge structures
integrates to give the Hodge structure on the total space. This left open
the question of what happens near the singularities, the answers fur-
nished by [174] [51].  Similarly, what happens when the total space, and
hence the fibers, are noncompact and/or singular—in this case we obtain
variations of mixed Hodge structure, and the combined situation where
this degenerates leads to a mountain of linear algebra [183] [201] which
very few can grasp (anyone out there?).
To wrap up this historical perspective a little faster, basically the
remaining theoretical directions have been to look at Hodge theory for
the full homotopy type of X. This can mean looking at the homotopy
groups, which obtain mixed Hodge structures6 [141], idem for the pro-
nilpotent completion of the fundamental group [141] [93]; looking at
representations of 
in nonabelian groups such as 
which have
harmonic representatives [53]; and combining various of these. Much of
what we shall say below issues from these basic themes.
In a family of varieties, all of the Hodge-theoretic invariants give
rise to variations of mixed Hodge structure over the base. This imposes
restrictions on the monodromy. We have things like the invariant cycle
theorem stating that a global section which is of type 
at one point
is also of type 
at other points.
6 One notable exception to the principle that homotopic invariants which are
finite dimensional complex vector spaces, have mixed Hodge structures, is the case of
the group cohomology of 
This was a question that was raised by many workers
such as Toledo, Carlson, Hain, long ago. I do not recall whether I have heard of any
progress (or counterexample) in the meantime, and Google did not help either.

A crucial property is the formality theorem of [65], saying that the
cohomology ring of a simply connected smooth projective variety deter-
mines its rational homotopy type. This has been extended to the pro-
nilpotent completion of 
[141] [93], to the spaces of representations
[144] [81], and to relative Malcev completions at other representations
in [93]. In the case of open varieties, the quadratic formality condition
is replaced by a weaker but still restrictive condition of generation in low
degrees [141].
Any representation 
with reductive Zariski clo-
sure, admits a structure of harmonic bundle [53]. These behave formally
much like variations of Hodge structure except that they lack a notion of
“Hodge type.” The space of representations of 
has a hyperkähler
structure,[99] [78] where the other complex structures come from the
interpretation as a moduli space of Higgs bundles [99] [151] [177] [78].
The cohomologies of X with coefficients in the different representations
give a nicely varying family of complexes indexed by the representation
space. The support loci are hyperkähler subvarieties, and even have
certain rationality properties. An important distinction occurs between
representations which are rigid (i.e. isolated points of the space of repre-
sentations) and those which are not. Rigid representations of the funda-
mental group are variations of Hodge structure, and one could conjecture
that they must be motivic i.e. that they should come from families of
varieties (this is a special case of a slightly more general conjecture [177]
(i)). On the other hand, nonrigid representations fit into a bigger fac-
torization theory [178] [47] [202] [111] [105] [75] [117] [147] [59] which
also encompasses results such as the fact (due to 
cohomology on in-
finite covers of X) that if 
decomposes into a nontrivial amalgamated
sum then there must be a map from X to a Riemann surface of genus
[88]. We now know the Shafarevich holomorphic convexity conjec-
ture relative to reductive representations in a linear group [111] [75]
[124]. There are a number of directions of investigation running which
look at cohomological invariants associated to representations, specially
work of Reznikov [170] which has been applied in [117]. We are starting
to get a good picture of the theory of representations of the fundamental
group for quasiprojective open varieties [53] [105] [138].
The above results lead to important classes of restrictions of the
form, certain homotopy types or homotopical invariants, cannot occur
for (projective) algebraic and/or Kähler varieties. In fact, it becomes
possible to write down explicit large families of topological types which
370
Carlos Simpson

cannot occur, see [47] [178] [45] [110] [177] .... Reznikov has proven
some of the deepest versions of these restrictions, including a theorem
covering many cases of a conjecture due to him, and independantly Gold-
man and Donaldson, saying that irreducible 3-manifold groups are not
Kähler groups [170].
Intrinsic global methods appeared in the work of Calabi and Yau
giving certain types of special Kähler metrics. This hooked up with a
sector of the subject of interest to the physicists generating the subject
of “Mirror symmetry” which can no longer be considered as just a sub-
field of Hodge theory or Kähler geometry. These important subjects are
underrepresented in present article.
Investigations of the Hodge-theoretic properties of algebraic cycles
have led very far in the direction of K-theory. In particular, this leads
to the introduction of new invariants such as regulators [23] [167] [170],
behaving in a way which is related to Hodge theory via the Beilinson
conjectures and Deligne cohomology.
Recent work of Voisin has underlined the difference between the
Kähler and the algebraic categories. For example, the Q-polarization
of the Hodge structure of an algebraic variety is a distinguishing char-
acteristic, the existence of which can be ruled out for certain Kähler
homotopy types; this leads to Kähler homotopy types whose cohomol-
ogy ring cannot be the cohomology ring of an algebraic variety ([194]
(v)). Philosophically going in the same direction is her result that the
Hodge conjecture for representing cycles by Chern classes of bundles,
cannot be true for arbitrary Kähler manifolds. Of course we do not
know whether it is true for algebraic varieties, but Voisin’s proof [194]
(iv) clearly distinguishes these cases since it makes use of a Kähler va-
riety (a complex torus) which has no rational Hodge classes in degrees
2 or 4 (in particular no hyperplane class). In view of these results, the
questions of realization of homotopy types in the Kähler and projective
categories are clearly distinct and can be treated as separate problems.
The reader is invited to double-up our questions in this way.
It seems safe to say (if nothing else, in view of the length of the
reference list which is only partial) that a relatively complete picture of
the Hodge-theoretic properties of algebraic varieties, is in the making.
It would be good to understand how Lefschetz devissage works in the
context of Hodge structures on homotopy, or nonabelian cohomology,
see Navarro Aznar [148] for example. The theory should be extended
to apply to algebraic stacks and other exotic objects. One detail for the

curious, is the variance of the formality equivalence on the homotopy
type given by [65]. And more globally, it seems unclear whether the
full complicated version of the theory as sketched above has really been
explicitly applied in many examples. Aside from these brief remarks, it
is best to consult the references for a good picture of where the current
development of the theory stands, and in which directions it will (or
should) be developed in the near future.
Now we come to the main point of the present exposition, which is to
try to isolate some of the important questions in the subject. It should
be stressed that these are not at all new, but rather come from the folk-
lore explicit or implicit in most of the work that has been done. Still, it
seems like a good idea to look at them from an analytical viewpoint. A
historical overview brings out an inescapable fact: we know a lot more
about what (projective) algebraic, or Kähler, varieties do not look like,
than about what they do. This is because the most subtle tool we have
found yet is Hodge theory, and this is essentially geared toward addition-
al properties, or equivalently, restrictions on the topology and/or geom-
etry of Kähler manifolds. This type of application determines the style
of numerous theorems in the subject. In some hypothetical alternative
world, this might have been enough to gain a complete understanding of
the subject, if we could prove so many properties that there were very
few possibilities left and we would get a complete classification of what
could happen. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately for the interest of
the subject at least, this is not the case. In spite of the large and varied
collection of properties given by Hodge theory, it seems nowhere close to
giving any kind of classification of the topological behavior which could
arise.
On the other side of the story, this situation leaves wide open the
whole problem of how to construct varieties exhibiting topological be-
havior that is allowed by Hodge theory. Theoretical machinery is not in
the fore here, although it is present insofar as it facilitates the calculation
of the topological behavior of a variety which for other reasons we have
at hand. Unfortunately (in all senses) on this side of things, we do not
have very many deep techniques of construction.7 I will try to discuss
below the possible techniques of construction we know about. For the
purposes of the present paragraph, let’s just look at what might be seen
7The only full exception is the Lefschetz (1,1)-theorem.

Carlos Simpson

as a good candidate for a “deep technique of construction:” the notion
of quotient of a symmetric domain by a group action. The associated
variety comes out of a transcendental construction, so it is at least very
indirect as a construction. However, the geographical place occupied by
the varieties obtained in this way is quite infinitesimal, so in spite of
a number of successful applications of this construction, we are mostly
left wondering how come there is not a way of twiddling it to cover
more nearby cases.8 To give a precise version of these statements, look
at the case of surfaces: those which are uniformized by the ball have
whereas there exist other surfaces uniformized by a product of
discs, with 
Siu mentioned as a folkloric problem, the question
of whether or not every variety with 
lying between 
and 
would
have to have infinite fundamental group. I do not know whether it is
reasonable to expect such a thing or not, but it does seem quite clear
that it is silly to have such a wide swath where we think non-simply con-
nected varieties should be lying, but to have a nice general construction
only on the boundary of the region. This example is pretty emblematic
of the whole problem of constructing interesting varieties: we have the
impression that there is a huge mass of stuff out there, waiting to be
constructed or seen, but we have no idea how to get there.
The construction question can take many forms, depending on what
type of thing you want to construct. Among the infinite variations on
this question, we can try to isolate some exemplary ones. Start with the
simply connected case. In all of the questions, we will for simplicity ask
for smooth projective varieties but the same question could be asked for
proper smooth algebraic spaces, compact Kähler manifolds, etc.; and we
stick to the compact smooth case again for simplicity, but more subtle
questions involving mixed Hodge structures are available for the open
and/or singular case.
The easiest version of the question would be the following: given
and a vector 
satisfying the known constraints such as
and that 
is even, plus the constraint given by the
Lefschetz decomposition, does there exist a smooth projective variety X
with 
A recent investigation of the very first case
is [200]. Take note of the obvious (and in this case pretty useless)
observation that there exists an algorithm which lists all of the vectors
which occur: just run through all possible varieties defined over finite
8 Actually, this has been done in some cases such as Toledo’s examples [191], see
also [3]
The Construction Problem in Kähler Geometry

extensions of Q and for each one, calculate the Betti numbers. This does
not imply that there is a decision algorithm for a given vector. To get
even an impractical decision algorithm we would have to get a bound on
the degree and height of varieties with a given set of Betti numbers. Of
course the algorithmic question does not really represent what we would
like, which is a clean statement saying, a vector of Betti numbers occurs
if and only if it satisfies a given simple constraint.
We can refine the above question by asking for the full collection
of Hodge numbers 
See [74] and [64] for example. In this case,
it is interesting even to look at only one cohomology group: given a
collection 
does there exist a variety X such that the
Hodge structure on 
has these Hodge numbers? In a sort of
vague philosophical sense, Mirror symmetry says that there may be some
relationship between this Hodge number question and the Betti number
question in the previous paragraph.
At the very least, there is a question which intuitively suggests itself
in both cases. This was the subject of a conversation with J. Kollar a long
time ago. Is it possible to have big numbers on the ends of the vector,
and small numbers in the middle? Or, on the other hand, is there some
type of bound that says the middle Hodge (or Betti) numbers have to be
bigger than the outer ones? Our intuition says that the middle numbers
probably should be bigger than the outer ones, but there does not seem
to be any result in this direction. This can be made into a very small
and specific question, for example do there exist surfaces with Hodge
numbers 
with 
Or say with a arbitrarily
large and 
or 
The same concrete question could be posed
for threefolds, or more generally for the Hodge structures on 
or
One can weaken the requirement by looking at motives. In this case,
we just mean the image of an algebraically defined correspondence. Can
the image Hodge structure have Hodge numbers with
In formulating the same question for Betti numbers, care must be
taken with the Lefschetz decomposition, which already provides the type
of bound we are looking for in a certain sense. One could ask, do there
exist varieties with large primitive cohomology 
and small 
for
Again here it might be convenient to distinguish odd and
even cohomology.
When we see that we do not even know what to say about these rea-
sonably simple questions, it is apparent that more complicated things
374
Carlos Simpson

such as the possible structure of the cohomology ring or just of cer-
tain fixed cup product operations, are completely open problems too.
Without trying to list these questions exhaustively, we can formulate an
example. If X is a 3-fold with a nontrivial vector space
then the cup product gives a cubic form 
What are the
possibilities for the equivalence class of 
Even in the simplest case
dim V = 2, the space of forms is 8-dimensional, and it is acted upon by
the 4-dimensional group GL(2); where does 
lie in the 4-dimensional
space (or stack to be more precise) of orbits? What examples can we con-
struct? The numerous possible generalizations of this type of question
are perhaps better understood in terms of nonabelian cohomology.
The discussion would not be complete without pointing out that the
Hodge conjecture is an example (perhaps the first) of the construction
problem. In that case, the problem is to construct subvarieties such that
the cycle map gives a certain topological class. There are many different
formulations, for example one can say that we want subvarieties such that
the restriction of some cohomology class is nonzero. The situation for the
Hodge conjecture remains much the same as the more general situation
we are reflecting on here: we really do not have any good constructions
of cycles. Indeed, most cases where it is known are obtained by showing
that there are not too many Hodge classes, in other words that there are
sufficiently many restrictions on the classes that we do not have to look
too far to get the rest. Two notable exceptions are Steenbrink’s semi-
regularity theorem [182] and Voisin’s construction for Kummer surfaces
in [194] (ii).
Another side of the story is related to our previous questions for Betti
numbers. One of the simplest “standard conjectures” is algebraicity of
the Kunneth projectors. But, even to construct varieties for which this
question is interesting, we need ones with nontrivial Betti numbers in
different degrees. It is not even clear that we really know a very wide
collection of such varieties
Let’s move onto the non-simply connected case, and more specifi-
cally to questions about the fundamental group. One can note that by
the existence of Artin neighborhoods, the topology of quasiprojective
can be considered as the basic building block for the topol-
ogy of any other varieties.  (Also a recent result of Beilinson [23] and
Katzarkov, Pantev and Toen [114] refines this to a statement about
schematic homotopy types.) In this sense, it is natural to pay what
The Construction Problem in Kähler Geometry

Carlos Simpson
might at first seem to be an inordinate amount of attention to questions
about the fundamental group.
The situation is pretty well summed up by the first two sentences of
Reznikov’s paper [170] (vii):
Fundamental groups of complex projective varieties are very diffi-
cult to understand. There is a tremendous gap between few computed
examples and few general theorems. ...
Reznikov is referring to what is actually a fairly diverse collection
of constructions serving to give examples of fundamental groups. These
range from uniformization constructions (which are also seen from other
viewpoints e.g. in Deligne and Mostow [67], Livne [132]) to explicit
constructions for example of nilpotent fundamental groups [44] [180].
See the discussion in the book of Amorós et al [7]. Nonetheless, this
collection of examples leaves us with the impression that there are many
examples of groups that we do not know about. It is not altogether
trivial to formulate precise questions which express this feeling.
We can start with a very general one, which was inspired by Toledo’s
examples of varieties with non-residually finite    [191] [7]. Can any
finitely presented group be a subgroup of a 
for a smooth projective
variety X? Or, on the contrary, are there restrictions on which groups
can occur as subgroups? As far as I know, none of the Hodge theory
results that we currently have serves to rule out arbitrary subgroups. It
is possible that some type of 
cohomology techniques, or maybe some
Yang–Mills techniques such as in Ni and Ren [150], on the (possibly
infinite) covering
determined by a subgroup 
could
give some restrictions. Toledo’s example shows that one cannot hope for
any results on this question using finite-dimensional Hodge theory.
On the construction side there is something obvious to try: given a
finitely presented group 
it is the fundamental group of a smooth com-
pact manifold M (say, of dimension 4). This manifold can be embedded
in some 
and then approximated by a real algebraic manifold. Thus
we may assume that M is a connected component of the real points of
an algebraic variety X defined over R. We can further replace X by any
covering whose ramification locus does not intersect W. We might hope
in this way to get an injection 
I do not see any way of
proving that a map of this type is injective, though.
An interesting test case (suggested by M. Larsen) would be
the group of points in an algebraic group G defined over Z.

with coefficients in a finite localization
This group is linear, but
cannot immediately be embedded in the fundamental group of a Her-
mitian symmetric domain quotient. One suspects that such 
cannot
itself be a Kähler group, because it would tend to have rigid representa-
tions which are not integral, which would go against the conjecture that
all rigid representations are motivic. It might, on the other hand, be
possible to carry out a real-points construction such as in the previous
paragraph, keeping enough control over a linear representation to prove
injectivity of the map.
More generally, after Toledo’s example and several others in the same
direction (these are nicely presented in [7]), we can ask what type of non-
residually finite groups can occur. A folkloric observation/question9 is
that in all examples so far, there is a nontrivial linear quotient group; do
there exist Kähler groups without any subgroups of finite index at all?
A question which was recalled in E. Rees’ Math Review MR1396672
of the paper by Amorós [4], as well as in [7] is whether there are groups
which are fundamental groups of Kähler manifolds but not of smooth
projective varieties. It might now be possible to give such an example,
based on Voisin’s construction [194].
One of the main invariants of a finitely presented group is its space
of representations, say into 
It provides a way of measur-
ing how well we can construct examples of fundamental groups. Say
that a representation 
is non-rigid if its semisimplification lies in a
positive-dimensional component of the moduli space of representations
(recall that the moduli space parametrizes Jordan equivalence classes of
representations, which is the same as isomorphism classes of semisimple
representations). The non-rigidity condition stated this way implies non-
vanishing of the deformation space, but the converse is not necessarily
true: there can exist representations with nontrivial deformation space
but where all the deformations are obstructed so there are no truely
integrable deformations (and indeed this seems to be what happens in
some Teichmüller examples, see below). The known factorization results
leave ample room for existence of interesting non-rigid representations.
However, the only examples I know are obtained in the following way:
if 
is a morphism and if, for some reason we already have a
nonrigid local system V over Z, then some higher direct image

will tend to be nonrigid on X. This construction has the notable prop-
erty that the birational equivalence class of the irreducible component
of the moduli space of representations of 
which is constructed, is
not necessarily any different from the one we started with for 
In
other words, no new moduli spaces are constructed in this way,10 even if
old moduli spaces are reinterpreted in new ways for new varieties.
This inevitably raises the question, do we already know11 all of the
possible moduli spaces of representations? Or are there varieties hav-
ing new moduli spaces not on the basic list? A first comment is that
by the Lefschetz theorem restricting to a curve, any new moduli spaces
are subspaces of moduli spaces of representations on a curve. This in-
cludes all of the structure, notably the hyperkähler structure [99] [78].
So one possible attack on this question would be to try to classify all
hyperkähler subspaces of the moduli spaces of representations on curves.
The extensive works of Verbitsky, Kaledin [193] [108] [109] are certainly
relevant to any such project.
It is probably not easy to prove that two given hyperkähler varieties
of the same dimension are distinct. For this part of the question, several
possibilities might work: analysis of the singularities, looking at the
power-series expansion of the hyperkähler structure at a special point,
analysis of the structure at infinity, or calculation of the metric (e.g.
curvature) properties. These things are all undoubtedly easier to do in
low dimensions. This suggests that an important variant of the question
would be, can we construct varieties whose space of representation has
components with positive but low dimension? (Recall that the complex
dimension is divisible by 2, so the first possibilities would be dimension 2
or dimension 4.) Here we have fallen back into a situation analogous to
that for the geography of surfaces: there are many natural examples of
rigid representations, but for the “nearby” case of representations with
10This is a bit of a misstatement. The moduli spaces are the same, if the
collection of representations obtained as higher direct images from representations on
Z constitutes an irreducible component of the moduli space of representations on X.
It of course remains possible that the representation on X could acquire additional
deformations in other directions not coming from deformations on Z. In this case we
would get a candidate for a new moduli space (although that would not be a proof
that it was really different from the old ones, either ... ). Comparing deformation
spaces of the local system V on Z and the higher direct image 
on X is therefore
an interesting question.
11 The known ones would be products of moduli spaces of representations on
curves, and of rank one representations on abelian varieties.

The Construction Problem in Kähler Geometry

low-dimensional moduli we know only very few12. For orbicurves (which
also applies to certain fibrations with multiple fibers), the situation is
much better: by work of Kostov [121] and Crawley–Boevey [55] we
have a good classification of the irreducible components of the moduli
spaces, and in particular there exist components of all possible (even)
dimensions. Small components appeared in the “toy example” in [175].
At this juncture, note that cohomology support loci13 provide nat-
ural hyperkähler subvarieties. One might therefore ask whether the ir-
reducible components of support loci occur as components of moduli
spaces of representations. There might be geometric constructions re-
lating the situation of a support locus, to a nonrigid representation. For
these reasons (as well as because it fits into our general construction
question) it would be interesting to have constructions of varieties giv-
ing rise to nontrivial cohomology support loci. As mentioned in the
previous paragraph, a variant would be to ask for support loci of small
positive dimension.
This brings us to a question raised by Hain and/or Looijenga (com-
municated to me by R.H. but he said it was more due to E.L.). They
looked the moduli of 
genus curves 
and looked at spaces
of representations of 
or perhaps more precisely the Teichmüller
group which is the orbifold fundamental group. It is of course well-known
that the standard representation is rigid. However, they found other
representations (subobjects of tensor powers of the standard one) which
were not infinitesimally rigid. The ones they found all had the property
that there were enough obstructions that they were globally rigid even
if not infinitesimally so. This then raises the question: are there any
non-rigid (in our above sense) representations of 
Or on the
contrary are all representations globally rigid?
Actually if a variety X has the property that all of its representa-
tions are globally rigid, then the pro-algebraic completion of 
has
a reasonable structure (something like a product of the relative Malcev
completions at the various points) and similarly the schematic homotopy
type
as defined by Toen [189] [114] will have reasonable finiteness
12One should consider the possibility that this phenomenon might be substantial,
rather than just a consequence of our lack of suitable constructions, see [53] (ii) for
example.
13 By “support loci” we mean the loci 
of local systems V such that
One could introduce variants here, such as loci where certain
cup products in cohomology have a given rank.

Carlos Simpson
properties (for example the bad behavior noted at the beginning of Artin
and Mazur [14] would not occur). This, plus the fact that the repre-
sentations found so far by Hain and Looijenga turned out to be globally
rigid in spite of their infinitesimal non-rigidity, leads us to conjecture
that 
does not have any globally non-rigid representations.
If the above questions are not enough, one could pose similar ones
for higher nonabelian cohomology [177]. The reader will readily imagine
the details, so it does not seem necessary to stress this further here. The
long-range hope is that nonabelian cohomology might help explain or
organize what is going on—some hint of this can already be seen in the
fact that it was natural to look at cohomology support loci.
We have been concentrating on the question of the pure topology
of X. On the other hand, a great deal of research in differential geom-
etry has looked at the classification of differential manifolds and other
structures such as symplectic manifolds. A major part of this work has
been to consider the place of algebraic or Kähler manifolds in the clas-
sification. Thus, what we know about the Donaldson–Seiberg–Gromov–
Witten invariants of algebraic varieties, is quite comparable to what we
know about them for other types of manifolds (I maintain that, as a
whole, this is still not very much.) See [142], [77] [72] [154] for exam-
ple. Lönne has considered an interesting question, which is the group of
diffeomorphisms of a variety and its action on cohomology. He was able
to calculate this in one case using Seiberg–Witten theory [133] (see also
[103]). An important question is, to what extent will consideration of
the new invariants help us for example to construct varieties with given
Hodge numbers?
Another possible invariant that we could look to obtain would be
intersection cohomology for singular varieties. All of the same types of
questions could be posed in that context. One can also ask things like
how many (and what kind of) singularities a variety can have, see [73]
for example.
A general research direction, tangentially related to our present pre-
occupations, is the question of what happens when we go to “infinity.”
As became apparent with work of Wentworth and others, there are three
natural directions to look at:
We can go to infinity in an open (say, quasiprojective) variety,
and ask for the behavior of representations, vector bundles, cohomology
classes and so forth near the divisor at infinity.

The Construction Problem in Kähler Geometry
381
We can go to infinity in the space of representations. This leads
to the whole subject of “singular perturbation theory,” which is grow-
ing very diverse. There are lots of things to investigate. The question
of how the harmonic metric degenerates when the representation goes
to infinity was raised in [56] [58], in particular what relationship this
has with harmonic maps to buildings occurring on the boundary of the
moduli space of representations. There is also the whole question of the
Stokes phenomenon for the asymptotic expansion of the monodromy,
which actually is probably closely related to the harmonic map ques-
tion, for example spectral curves play an important role in the Stokes
phenomenon [61] [102] [9] [33].
We can look at a degenerating family of varieties, considered as a
smooth family over a punctured disc, and go to infinity at the puncture.
This amounts to saying that we look at varieties where certain vanishing
cycles become infinitely small. The degeneration of cohomology has
been extensively studied in this case. The degeneration of the space of
representations has been much less studied, see however [58] and [50]
for example. Some time ago, Katzarkov raised the question of whether
there is an analogue of the Clemens–Schmid exact sequence for spaces
of representations or other nonabelian cohomology.
The above topics suggest their own formulations of the construction
question. For example, do open varieties, or degenerating varieties, exist
with given topological behavior? This is a vast question, and is also
related to the smoothing and branching techniques for construction even
of smooth projective examples.
Perhaps the biggest research area in Kähler geometry is the study
of special metrics, for example Kähler–Einstein metrics or metrics with
other rigidifying curvature properties [69] [186]. This continues to mo-
tivate a large segment of the field, and we could not go into sufficient
detail here. This subject probably has or will have important impli-
cations for the topological construction problem we are discussing, on
the one hand because the existence of metrics with special curvature
properties implies strong topological restrictions, and on the other hand
because this type of global analysis might contain key techniques for the
construction of algebraic objects. A similar question is what new infor-
mation will be brought by the Ricci flow techniques of Perelman [161]:
can these be used to construct Hodge cycles by a minimization process,
for example? More generally, is there a way in which one can look at
“almost Kähler manifolds,” then define obstructions and minimization

382
Carlos Simpson
processes allowing us to determine when an “almost Kähler manifold”
could be deformed to a true one?
Now it’s time to look at some of the main techniques for constructing
varieties. The first and most obvious is by writing down equations. It is
a nontrivial task just to understand what are the topological properties
of a variety which is given by its equations. The other nontrivial task is
to find systems of equations which do not reduce to complete intersec-
tions,14 a question which Landsberg has looked at in a theoretical way
[123].
The equational method becomes very subtle already in codimension
two. Perhaps a fundamental example is the determination by Gruson
and Peskine of the values of 
for which there exist a smooth curve
of degree 
and genus 
in 
(which after all is an early version of
the whole construction question we are considering). They succeeded by
a very careful construction noticing that you got interesting examples
out of the relatively large Picard groups of cubic and singular quartic
surfaces.
This type of method has not been sufficiently exploited in
relationship with more overtly topological questions.
The next technique, which could sometimes be considered as a vari-
ant on the equational method, is to construct varieties as branched cov-
erings of other varieties with a given branch locus. This has led to a
large and intensive study of some of the first possible cases of branch
loci, for example hyperplane arrangements, or curves with a few compo-
nents of low degree in the projective plane [130] [97]. Fulton’s theorem
that    is abelian if the branch curve has only nodes [80] shows that
the question is subtle, see also [86]. The branched variety construction
serves as a bridge between the topology of compact smooth varieties,
and the topology of the open branch locus complements. In many cases
it is easier to envision calculations, for example of fundamental groups,
in the open case. This program has already been carried a long way by
Moishezon and Teicher [140] with Robb [171] and others.
Another variant on the equational method is looking at degeneracy
loci of vector bundle maps (see Decker, Ein, Schreyer who extensively
investigated this in [60], see also [71]). Eyssidieux’s construction of some
varieties as base loci of linear systems [75] could also fit in here, although
14 Although it is not even completely clear that we fully understand the topology
of complete intersections together with their embeddings, specially in twisted cases
such as weighted projective spaces. A few references are [122], [131] but this is not
a complete list.

The Construction Problem in Kähler Geometry
383
it has the additional subtlety that the linear system is 
taking place
on an infinite covering—equivariance says that the base locus descends
to a usual subvariety downstairs.
A hitherto underexplored idea is Kapovich and Millson’s theorem
saying that any variety can be viewed as the moduli space of a linkage
[110]. It is possible that the “mechanical” properties of a linkage could
show up in the topological properties of the moduli space, and in this
way we might have a more natural relationship between the presentation
of a variety and its topology. It seems urgent to look at this in more
detail.
A generalization would be to try to construct varieties as moduli
spaces of any kind of geometric object, and to hope that the topological
properties of the moduli spaces would be related to the moduli problem.
This is of course what happens with well-known moduli spaces. However,
up to now the philosophical take on this theory has always been that
the “moduli spaces” are natural objects, and we should be interested
in their topological properties. A more intentional approach would say
that we are interested in constructing given topological types, and we
would like to pick and choose our moduli problem in order to get what
we want. One place to start might be to look at moduli spaces of group
representations (a point of view present in [110]). For strange groups
which the researcher should carefully choose (probably not Kähler
ones!), does the moduli space of representations of 
have an interesting
topological type? Other possibilities might include components of the
moduli spaces of space curves [91], or (related by [16]) components of
the Noether–Lefschetz loci [48] [155].
Something which was mentioned previously is the existence of uni-
formization constructions for algebraic varieties. The simplest examples
are direct construction of the quotient of a symmetric domain by a dis-
crete group action. In recent years this has been considerably extended.
Perhaps one of the first extensions was Toledo’s construction of exam-
ples with non-residually finite fundamental group [191]. The idea is that
certain natural subspaces of symmetric domains can fit together into in-
teresting configurations in the quotient variety. Then other techniques
such as branched covers, or in Toledo’s case blowing down a negative
subvariety and then taking hyperplane sections which miss the singular-
ities, give new varieties. Lately some more complicated configurations
have been considered by Allcock, Carlson and Toledo [3]. These types

384
Carlos Simpson
of constructions are good candidates; one of the major difficulties is in
calculating what happens.
Another important technique is the notion of fibration, which came
up under the notion of Lefschetz devissage above. Whereas one often
uses fibrations to study the topology of a variety, it is also possible to try
to construct varieties by explicitly constructing a fibration. The easiest
example is that of Kodaira surfaces, where the fibration is automatical-
ly smooth (a construction which easily generalizes in higher dimensions
too). Recall that the basic idea consists of saying that given a pointed
curve we can take a covering ramified at the point. As the point moves,
this gives a family of curves fibering over the original curve; the con-
struction can be iterated in the fibers. One can write down the group
automorphisms determining the monodromy, but the formulae tend to
be long and not very enlightening. Things might get more tractable
by putting computers to work to do the calculations. Other examples
of fibration constructions include the ones of Bogomolov and Katzarkov
[35]—but here again it is difficult to know what the result is. This theory
of course spills over into the symplectic world via Donaldson’s notion of
almost-Lefschetz fibration. Gompf [82], Amorós et al [6], Reznikov [170]
(ii) show that the symplectic “almost-Lefschetz” world is more flexible
in an essential way, for example any fundamental group can arise. In
view of these results, it does not seem clear what implications there are
for our present construction problem.
Braid groups come into play when looking at fibrations whose fibers
are punctured projective lines [140]. In this case, a family is just a
moving system of points in 
The de Rham version of the devissage
for representations of the fundamental group is what is often known as
“isomonodromic deformation,” or “Painlevé equations.” The isomon-
odromy equations or nonabelian Gauss–Manin, are equations which tell
us when we have a family of representations on the fibers which fit to-
gether to give a representation of the fundamental group of the total
space. So, looking for algebraic solutions of these equations could be
a way of constructing quasiprojective varieties with nonrigid represen-
tations. Some solutions have been found by Boalch [33] and Hitchin
[99].
Birational transformations enter into algebraic geometry in many
ways, and they constitute a way of modifying a variety which changes
its topological type in a readily calculable way. These provide a tool
for transforming a subvariety into a modification, for example. Also

a singularity could become a topological feature after resolution. This
type of construction showed up very successfully in Voisin’s examples
of compact Kähler varieties whose homotopy types cannot be smooth
projective [194].
One of the major potential techniques for construction of smooth
projective varieties is smoothing of degenerate configurations. This was
mentioned, for example, in Peters’ “Math Review” [166] of U. Persson’s
paper [162]. This tool plays an important role in the determination of
the “geography of surfaces” [163]. While not immediately trivial, the
calculation of the homotopy type of the smooth nearby fiber is something
which can be done reasonably well using traditional Hodge-theoretic
techniques. One of the main difficulties is that not enough research
has been done to establish useful criteria stating when a configuration
can be smoothed. This has to be a subtle problem [165], because all
of the Hodge-theoretic restrictions on homotopy types show that you
cannot just smooth any configuration. Smoothings are known to exist in
some special cases [90] [168] [169] [186] [188]. There is a wide choice of
initial configuration, which could be a union of projective spaces or other
easy pieces—in which case the combinatorics of the configuration would
determine the topology of the nearby fiber; or it could on the other hand
be a variety having a complicated singularity which contributes a lot of
topology in the smoothing.
Whatever methods are used for constructing varieties, there is al-
ways the problem of calculating what you get. The calculation problem
is rendered difficult by the fact that, not only do we need to know how
to find the answer, but we need a sufficiently agile understanding of how
the calculation works that we can choose the construction accordingly.
Indeed, the main point of the whole “construction question” we are ask-
ing here is to be able to influence the output topological type as much
as possible, by varying the input construction of the variety.15
Some recent advances in Hodge theory are likely to be key elements
of this computational aspect. Notable is T. Mochizuki’s work on non-
abelian Hodge theory on open varieties [138], see previously [32] [128].
We will describe in a bit more detail how this is relevant. In the short
range, one of the most promising avenues for constructing things re-
mains the consideration of complements of configurations of curves in
(maybe one would blow up at singular points to obtain a normal

crossings configuration). The isomonodromy equations constitute one
approach to look for representations of the fundamental group of the
complement. However, a more global approach would be to look for
harmonic bundles over 
with singularities along the curves in the con-
figuration. There are three incarnations we could use to look for these:
the Dolbeault incarnation would say to look for logarithmic parabolic
Higgs bundles; the de Rham incarnation, to look for parabolic bundles
with logarithmic connexion; and the Betti incarnation (hitherto less ex-
plored) would be to look for “filtered local systems.” T. Mochizuki’s
work describes the properties of harmonic bundles on open varieties and
their extensions to the normal crossings compactification. There is still a
lot to be done here, but he has crossed the essential step of understand-
ing the local behavior at the singularities. Thus, we can imagine that in
the semi-near future we will have the full panoply of tools necessary to
analyze the correspondence between the Dolbeault, de Rham and Bet-
ti points of view. In each case, there should be a Bogomolov–Gieseker
inequality (for the logarithmic Dolbeault case this was mentioned to me
recently by Narasimhan). It is the limit case of this inequality which
gives rise to representations. The case of filtered local systems is worth
highlighting. The easiest possibility would be to look at filtrations on
the trivial local system. Then a filtered structure is just specification of
a filtration (indexed by real weights) for each divisor in the configura-
tion. The parabolic Chern classes would be polynomials in the weights
whose coefficients are determined by the combinatorics of which divisors
intersect. The Bogomolov–Gieseker inequality might well give nontrivial
constraints on the possible combinatorics of the configuration; and when
the limiting case of equality is attained, one would get families of har-
monic bundles which, after transformations such as described in [177]
(which would require the fully worked-out theory to implement), would
give representations of the fundamental group on the complement. It
would then become a combinatorial problem to find configurations where
the limiting case of equality could be attained. We can vividly hope that
T. Mochizuki’s work will allow us to carry out this type of investigation.
It is really unclear what type of answer we would expect from calcu-
lations such as described in the previous paragraph. We would be looking
to attain the limiting case of a Bogomolov–Gieseker type inequality, and
that would seem hard to do. A lot of negative results formalizing this
difficulty would lend credence to the conjecture on Teichmüller groups
stated above, and would also increase the hope for some type of strong

classification results about representations. Generalizing the rank two
classification of [54], it might be possible to get say a classification for
rank three representations.
If there is any conclusion to be drawn, it is perhaps that even though
there is no single fully satisfactory choice of a method of construction,
nonetheless there are many methods which have not been fully exhaust-
ed yet; and similarly there are so many different variants of the basic
construction question, that maybe we should just spend some time try-
ing to see what topological shapes can be constructed with the methods
currently at hand. This might direct us towards the most promising
construction methods, and might also lead to ideas for improving the
underlying Hodge-theoretical tools of calculation.
