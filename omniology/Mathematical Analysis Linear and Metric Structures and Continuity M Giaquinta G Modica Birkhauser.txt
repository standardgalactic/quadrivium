Preface 
One of the fundamental ideas of mathematical analysis is the notion of 
a function', we use it to describe and study relationships among variable 
quantities in a system and transformations of a system. We have already 
discussed real functions of one real variable and a few examples of functions 
of several variables^, but there are many more examples of functions that 
the real world, physics, natural and social sciences, and mathematics have 
to offer: 
(a) not only do we associate numbers and points to points, but we asso-
ciate numbers or vectors to vectors, 
(b) in the calculus of variations and in mechanics one associates an en-
ergy or action to each curve y{t) connecting two points (a, y{a)) and 
{b,y{b)y. 
b 
^{y):= j F{t,y{tW{t))dt 
in terms of the so-called Lagrangian F(t, y,p), 
(c) in the theory of integral equations one maps a function into a new 
function 
h 
^(^) "^ 
K{s,r)x{T)dT 
by means of a kernel K{s, r), 
(d) in the theory of differential equations one considers transformations 
of a function x{t) into the new function 
t 
t 
/ 
f{s,x{s))ds, 
a 
where f{s,y) is given.

Of course all the previous examples are covered by the abstract setting 
of functions or mappings from a set X (of numbers, points, functions, 
...) with values in a set Y (of numbers, points, functions, . . . ) . But in 
this general context we cannot grasp the richness and the specificity of 
the different situations, that is, the essential ingredients from the point of 
view of the question we want to study. In order to continue to treat these 
specificities in an abstract context in mathematics, but also use them in 
other fields, we proceed by identifying specific structures and studying the 
properties that only depend on these structures. In other words, we need 
to identify the relevant relationships among the elements of X and how 
these relationships reflect on the functions defined on X. 
Of course we may define many intermediate structures. In this volume 
we restrict ourselves to illustrating some particularly important structures: 
that of a linear or vector space (the setting in which we may consider linear 
combinations), that of a metric space (in which we axiomate the notions 
of limit and continuity by means of a distance)^ that of a normed vector 
space (that combines linear and metric structures), that of a Banach space 
(where we may operate hnearly and pass to the limit), and finally, that 
of a Hilbert space (that allows us to operate not only with the length of 
vectors, but also with the angles that they form). 
The study of spaces of functions and, in particular, of spaces of contin-
uous functions originating in Italy in the years 1870-1880 in the works of 
among others Vito Volterra (1860-1940), Giulio Ascoh (1843-1896), Ce-
sare Arzela (1847-1912) and Ulisse Dini (1845-1918), is especially relevant 
in the previous context. 
A descriptive diagram is the following:

Accordingly, this book is divided into three parts. In the first part 
we study the hnear structure. In the first three chapters we discuss basic 
ideas and results, including Jordan's canonical form of matrices, and in the 
fourth chapter we present the spectral theorem for self-adjoint and normal 
operators in finite dimensions. 
In the second part, we discuss the fundamental notions of general topol-
ogy in the metric context in Chapters 5 and 6, continuous curves in Chap-
ter 7, and finally, in Chapter 8 we illustrate the notions of homotopy and 
degree, and Brouwer's and Borsuk's theorems with a few applications to 
the topology of R^. 
In the third part, after some basic preliminaries, we discuss in Chap-
ter 9 the Banach space of continuous functions presenting some of the 
classical fixed point theorems that play a relevant role in the solvability of 
functional equations and, in particular, of differential equations. In Chap-
ter 10 we deal with the theory of Hilbert spaces and the spectral theory of 
compact operators. Finally, in Chapter 9 we survey some of the important 
applications of the ideas and techniques that we previously developed to 
the study of geodesies, nonlinear ordinary differential and integral equa-
tions and trigonometric series. 
In conclusion, this volume^ aims at studying continuity and its im-
plications both in finite- and infinite-dimensional spaces. It may be re-
garded as a companion to [GMl] and [GM2], and as a reference book for 
multi-dimensional calculus, since it presents the abstract context in which 
concrete problems posed by multi-dimensional calculus find their natural 
setting. 
Though this volume discusses more advanced material than [GMl,2], 
we have tried to keep the same spirit, always providing examples and

William R. Hamilton (1805-1865), James Joseph Sylvester (1814-1897) and Arthur 
Cayley (1821-1895). 

1. Vectors, Matrices and Linear 
Systems 
The early developments of linear algebra, and related to it those of vectorial 
analysis, are strongly tied, on the one hand, to the geometrical represen-
tation of complex numbers and the need for more abstraction and formal-
ization in geometry and, on the other hand, to the newly developed the-
ory of electromagnetism. The names of William R. Hamilton (1805-1865), 
August Mobius (1790-1868), Giusto Bellavitis (1803-1880), Adhemar de 
Saint Venant (1797-1886) and Hermann Grassmann (1808-1877) are con-
nected with the beginning of linear algebra, while J. Willard Gibbs (1839-
1903) and Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925) established the basis of modern 
vector analysis motivated by the then recent Treatise in Electricity and 
Magnetism by James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879). The subsequent formal-
ization is more recent and relates to the developments of functional analysis 
and quantum mechanics. 
Today, linear algebra appears as a language and a collection of results 
that are particularly useful in mathematics and in applications. In fact, 
most modeling, which is done via linear programming of ordinary or par-
tial differential equations or control theory, can be treated numerically by 
computers only after it has been transformed into a linear system; in the 
end most of the modeling on computers deals with linear systems. 
Our aim here is not to present an extensive account; for instance, we 
shall ignore the computational aspects (error estimations, conditioning, 
etc.), despite their relevance, but rather we shall focus on illustrating the 
language and collecting a number of useful results in a wider sense. 
There is a strict link between linear algebra and linear systems. For 
this reason in this chapter we shall begin by discussing linear systems in 
the context of vectors in R'^ or C"^. 
1.1 The Linear Spaces R^ and C" 
a. Linear combinations 
Let K be the field of real numbers or complex numbers. We denote by '. 
the space of ordered n-tuples of elements of K, 
K^ := {x \yi:={x\x^,..., 
x^), x' eK, 
i = 1,..., n } . 

4 
1. Vectors, Matrices and Linear Systems 
The elements of K^ are often called points or vectors of K^] in the latter 
case we think of a point in K^ as the end-point of a vector applied at the 
origin. In this context the real or complex numbers are called scalars as 
they allow us to regard a vector at different scales. 
We can sum points of K^, or multiply them by a scalar by summing 
their coordinates or multiplying the coordinates by A: 
X + y := (x^ + y \ x2 + y^ ..., a;^ + 2/^), 
Ax := {Xx\ Ax^,..., Ax^), 
if X = {x\ 
x \ . . . , X-), y = (2/1, 2/2,..., 2/-), A E K. 
Of course Vx, y, z G K"^ and VA, /x G K, we have 
o (x + y) + z = X + (y + z), X 4- y = y + X, 
o A(x 4- y) = Ax + Ay, (A -f /i)x = Ax + /ix, (A/i)x = A(/ix), 
o if 0 := (0,..., 0), then x-fO = 0 + x = x, 
o 1 • X = x and, if —x := (—l)x, then x + (—x) = 0. 
We write x — y for x + (—y) and, from now on, the vector 0 will be simply 
denoted by 0. 
1.1 Example. If we identify B? with the plane of geometry via a Cartesian system, 
see [GMl], the sum of vectors in R"^ corresponds to the sum of vectors acccording to the 
parallelogram law, and the multipHcation of x by a scalar A to a dilatation by a factor 
|A| in the same sense of x if A > 0 or in the opposite sense if A < 0. 
1.2 About the notation. A list of vectors in K^ will be denoted by 
a lower index, Vi, V2,..., Vfc, and a list of scalars with an upper index 
A^, A^,..., A'^. The components of a vector x will be denoted by upper 
indices. In connection with the product row by columns^ see below, it is 
useful to display the components as a column 
/x^\ 
.2 
However, since this is not very convenient typographically, if not strictly 
necessary, we shall write instead x = (x^, x^,..., x"). 
Given k scalars A^, A^,..., A'^ and k vectors vi, V2,. •., v^ of R'^, we 
may form the linear combination vector of vi, V2,..., Vfc with coefficients 
A^, A^,..., A'^ given by 
k

1.3 Definition, 
(i) We say that W CK^ is a linear subspace, or simply 
a subspace of K^, if all finite linear combinations of vectors in W 
belong to W.

(ii) Given a subset S CW^ we call the span ofS the subset ofK^, denoted 
by Span 5, of all finite combinations of vectors in S. IfW = Span 5, 
we say that the elements of S span W, or that S is a set of generators 
forW. 
(iii) We say that k vectors Vi, V2,..., v^ E K'^ are linearly dependent if 
there exist scalars A^, A^,..., A^, not all zero, such that X]^=i ^^'^j = 
0. 
(iv) If k vectors Vi, V2,..., v^ are not linearly dependent, that is 
A^vi + • • • + A'^Vfc = 0 
implies 
A^ = A^ = • • • = A^ = 0, 
then vi, V2,..., Vjfc are called linearly independent. 
(v) A subset S CK^ is di set of linearly independent vectors if any finite 
choice of vectors Vi, V2,..., v^ G 5 Z5 made of linearly independent 
vectors. 
(vi) Let W be a linear subspace ofW^. A subset S C W of linearly inde-
pendent vectors that form a set of generators for W is called a basis 
ofW. 
Observe the following. 
(i) W is a, linear subspace of K" if and only if for all x, y G VT and all 
A, /i G K, we have Ax + /L^y G W. 
(ii) If VF is a hnear subspace of K^, then 0 e W and moreover Av G VF 
for all A G K if V G W^. 
(iii) vi, V2,..., Vjfc G K^ are linearly dependent if and only if one of the 
vectors Vi, V2,..., v^ is a linear combination of the others.

(iv) If k vectors vi, V2,..., v^ are linearly independent, then necessarily 
vi, V2,..., Vfc are distinct and not zero. Moreover, any choice of h, 
1 < h < k, yields a linearly independent set. 
(v) Let S C K^. Then W := Span 5 is a linear subspace of K*^. More 
explicitly W = Span S if and only if for every w e W there exist 
A: G N, scalars A^, A^,..., A'^ G K and vectors Vi, V2,..., v^ G S 
such that w = J2j=i ^^"^j-
b. Basis 
We shall now discuss the crucial notion of basis. 
1.4 Definition. Let C C K^. A subset B C C is a maximal set of linearly 
independent vectors oiC if B is a set of linearly independent vectors and, 
for every w G C \ S, the set B U {w} is not a set of linearly independent 
vectors. 
1.5 Proposition. Let W be a linear subspace ofK^. B is a basis ofW if 
and only if B is a maximal set of linearly independent vectors ofW. 
Proof. Let B be a basis of Vl^. JB is a set of linearly independent vectors. Moreover, since 
for every w G W^ there are k vectors v i , V2,. •., v^ G ;S and k scalars /x^, / i ^ , . . . , yJ^ 
such that w = Ylj=i l^'^^ki the vectors v i , V2,..., v^, w are not linearly independent, 
i.e., 6 U {w} is not a set of linearly independent vectors. 
Conversely, suppose that JB is a maximal set of linearly independent vectors. To 
prove that B is a basis, it suffices to prove that Span B = W and, actually, that W C 

1.1 The Linear Spaces M^ and C^ 
Span JS. If w G W, by assumption B U {w} is not a set of linearly independent vectors. 
Then there exist v i , V2,..., v^ G H and scalars a, A^, A^,..., A'^ such that

and w G Span B. Therefore W C Span B, 
D 
Using Zorn's lemma, see e.g., [GM2], one can show that every subspace 
of a hnear space, including of course the linear space itself, has a basis. 
In the present situation, Proposition 1.5 allows us to select a hasis of a 
subspace W by selecting a maximal set of linearly independent vectors in 
W. For instance, \iW = Span {vi, V2,..., Vjt}, we select the first nonzero 
element, say wi :== vi, then successively choose W2,W3,...,w^ in the 
list (vi, V2,..., Vfc) so that W2 is not a multiple of vi, and by induction, 
Wj is not a linear combination of wi, W2,..., Wj_i. This is not a very 
efficient method, but it works. For more efficient methods, see Exercises 
1.46 and 3.28. 
1.6 % Define the notion of minimal set of generators and show that it is equivalent 
to the notion of basis. 
c. Dimension 
We shall now show that all bases of a subspace W of K^ have the same 
number of elements, called the dimension of W, denoted by dim W, and 
that dim W <n. 
1.7 Theorem. We have the following. 
(i) Let {wi, W2,..., Wfc} be a basis of a subspace W C K^ and let 
vi, V2,..., Vp be p vectors of W that are linearly independent with 
p < n. Then one can complete the list vi, V2,..., Vp with n — p 
vectors among Wi, W2,..., w^ to form a new basis of W. 
(ii) k vectors ofW^ are always linearly dependent if k > n. 
(iii) All bases of a subspace W C W^ have the same number of elements 
k and k <n. 
Proof, (i) We proceed by induction on p = 1,2,..., n. 
Let p = 1 and vi ^ 0. Since w i , W2,..., w^ is a basis of W^ we have 
VI = x^wi H- . • • + x^Wfc 
(1.1) 
with at least one of the x* not zero. Without loss of generality, we can assume that 
x^ i^ 0, hence 
1 
J^ x^ 
^ 
j=2 ^ 

1. Vectors, Matrices and Linear Systems 
and the vectors vi, W2, W3,..., w^ span W. The vectors vi, W2, W3,..., w^ are also 
independent. In fact, if A^, A'^,..., A^ are such that 
k 
A^vi+^A^Wj =0, 
j=2 
then (1.1) yields 
k 
i~2 
and this implies A^ = 0 since x^ ^ 0; consequently ^^=2 ^"^^j ~ ^' hence A^ = • • • = 
A^ = 0 . 
Assume now the inductive hypothesis, that is, that we can choose n—p vectors of the 
basis wi = (1,0, ...,0), W2 = ( 0 , 1 , . . . ,0), . . . , Wn = (0,0, ...,1), say Wp+i,...,Wn, 
such that { v i , . . . , Vp, Wp+i,..., Wn} is a basis of W. Let us prove the claim for p + 1 
vectors. Since Vp+i is independent of vi, V2,..., Vp, we infer by the induction hypoth-
esis that 
p 
k 
i=l 
j=p4-l 
where at least one of the y* is not zero. Assuming, without loss of generality, that 
yp+'^ / 0, we have 
-I 
k 
n 
P
i 
and the vectors v i , . . . , Vp_|_i, Wp_|.2, • •, Wfc span W. Let us finally show that these 
vectors are also independent. If 
p 
k 
J2 ^'vi -h AP+Vp+1 + Yl ^^"^J = 0' 
i = l 
j=p+2 
(1.2) yields 
P 
k 
^ ( V + AP+ia:^)viH-AP+i2/P+iwp+i+ 
Yl 
(A^'+ AP+i2/^)w,-= 0. 
i = l 
j=p+2 
Since { v i , . . . , Vp, Wp+i,..., Wn} is a basis of W^ because of the induction assumption, 
and yP^^ 7^ 0 by construction, we conclude that A^"*"^ = 0, and consequently A* = 0 for 
all indices i. 
(ii) Assume that the vi, V2,..., v^ G K^ are independent and fc > n. By (i) we can 
complete the basis {wi, W2,..., Wn} of W^ to form a basis of Span {vi, V2,..., v^} 
with k elements; this is a contradiction since {ei, 6 2 , . . . , en} is already a basis of K'^, 
hence a maximal system of linearly independent vectors of K^. 
(iii) follows as (ii). Let us prove that two bases of W have the same number of elements. 
Suppose that {vi, V2,.. •, Vp} and {ei, e 2 , . . . , e^} are two bases of W with p < k. 
By (i) we may complete vi, V2,..., Vp with k — p vectors chosen among ei, 6 2 , . . . , e^ 
to form a new basis {vi, V2,..., Vp, ep^-i,... ,6^} of W; but this is a contradiction 
since {ei, 6 2 , . . . , ep} is already a basis of W, hence a maximal system of linearly 
independent vectors of W, see Proposition 1.5. Similarly, and we leave it to the reader, 
one can prove that k < n. 
D 
1.8 Definition. The number of the elements of a (all) basis of a linear 
subspace W ofK^ is called the dimension ofW and denoted by dimM^. 

1.1 The Linear Spaces E^ and C^ 
9 
1.9 Corollary. The linear space W^ has dimension n and, if W is a linear 
subspace ofW^, then dimW < n. Moreover, 
(i) there are k linearly independent vectors vi, V2,..., v^ G W, 
(ii) a set of k linearly independent vectors vi, V2,..., v^ 6 M^ is always 
a basis of W, 
(iii) any p vectors vi, V2,..., Vp G W with p > k are always linearly 
dependent, 
(iv) z/vi, V2,..., Vp are p linearly independent vectors ofW, then p < k, 
(v) for every subspace V C K^ such that V CW we have dim V < k, 
(vi) let V, W be two subspaces of W^; then V = W if and only 
ifVcW 
and dim V = dim W. 
1.10 If. Prove Corollary 1.9. 
d. Ordered basis 
Until now, a basis 5 of a linear subspace W of W^ is just a finite set of 
linearly independent generators of VF; every x G VF is a unique linear 
combination of the basis elements. Here, uniqueness means uniqueness of 
the value of each coefficient in front of each basis element. To be precise, 
one would write 
v € 5 
It is customary to index the elements of 5 with natural numbers, i.e., to 
consider 5 as a list instead of as a set. We call any list made with the ele-
ments of a basis S an ordered basis. The order just introduced is then used 
to link the coeflficients to the corresponding vectors by correspondingly 
indexing them. This leads to the simpler notation 
x ^ ^ A V , 
i=l 
we have already tacitly used. Moreover, 
1.11 Proposition. Let W be a linear subspace ofW^ of dimension k and 
let (vi, V2,..., Vfc) be an ordered basis of W. Then for every x G VF there 
is a unique vector A G K^, A := (A^, A^,..., A^) such that x = J2^=i ^^^i-
1.12 Example. The list (ei, ©2) • • • J Gn) of vectors of W^ given by ei :— (1, 0,. 
e2 := ( 0 , 1 , . . . , 0),..., Gn = (0,0,..., 1) is an ordered basis of K^. In fact ei, e2,.

1.2 Matrices and Linear Operators 
Following Arthur Cayley (1821-1895) we now introduce the calculus of 
matrices. An m x n matrix A with entries in X is an ordered table of 
elements of X arranged in m rows and n columns. It is customary to index 
the rows from top to bottom from 1 to m and the columns from left to 
right from 1 to n. If {aj} denotes the element or entry in the ith row and 
the jth column, we write 
A = 
/a\ 
\o 
al 
2 
a. n 
or A = [a}], z = l,...,m, j 
,n. 
<) 
Given a matrix A we write A^ for the entry (i, j) of A, and denote the 
set of matrices with m rows and n columns with Mm,n{X). Usually X will 
be the field of real or complex numbers K, but a priori one allows other 
entries. 
1.13 Remark (Notation). The common agreement about the indices 
of the elements of a matrix is that the row is determined by the upper 
index and the column by the lower index. Later, we shall also consider 
matrices with two lower indices or two upper indices, A = [aij] or A = 
[a*-^]. In both cases the agreement is that the first index identifies the row. 
These agreements turn out to be particularly useful to keep computation 
under control. The three diff^erent types of notation correspond to different 
mathematical objects represented by those matrices. But for the moment 
we shall not worry about this. 
If A = [a*] G Mp^n and B = [6^] G Mp^rn are two matrices with the 
same number of rows p, we denote by [A | B], or by ( A 
matrix with p rows and (n + m) columns defined by 
B

Similarly, given A = [a*] G Mp^n and B = [6^] G M^^n, we denote by

a. The algebra of matrices 
Two matrices A := [a^], B = [6^] in Mm,n{^) can be summed by setting 
A + B 
where c} := a] +6J, 
i = l,...,m, j = l,...,n. 
Moreover, one can multiply a matrix A € Mm,n{^) by a scalar A G K by 
setting 
AA:= 
Xal 
that is, each entry of AA is the corresponding entry of A multiplied by A. 
Notice that the sum of matrices is meaningful if and only if both ma-
trices have the same number of rows and columns. 
Putting the rows one after the other, we can identify Mm,nOQ with 
K'^"^ as a set, and the operations on the matrices defined above correspond 
to the sum and the multiplication by a scalar in K^'^. Thus 
Mm,n{^), 
endowed with the two operations (A, B) —^ A + B and (A, A) -^ AA, is 
essentially K*^"^. A basis for Mm,n{^) is the set of m x n matrices {I^} 
where IJ has entries 1 at the (i, j) position and zero otherwise. 
1.14 Definition (Product of matrices). // the number of rows of A 
is the same as the number of the columns of "B, A = [a'j] G Mp^n{^), 
B = [b'j] e Mn,q{K), we define the product matrix AB G Mp^q by setting 
AB = [c)] 
where c] = y^a^b^. 
k=i 
Notice that if {a\,ai,..., 
aj,) is the ith row of A and (6], 6^,..., 6p is the 
jth column of B, then

where 
(AB)} := 4 = a\b] + c^^h] + • • • + a^^^. 
For this reason the product of matrices is called the product rows by 
columns. 
It is easily seen that the product of matrices is associative and distribu-
tive i.e., 
(AB)C = A(BC) =: ABC, 
A(B + C) = AB + AC 
but, in general, it is not commutative, 
AB ^ BA, 
as simple examples show. Indeed, we may not be able to form BA even if 
AB is meaningful. Moreover, AB may equal 0, 0 being the matrix with 
zero in all entries, although A^^ 
and B 7^ 0. 
b. A few special matrices 
For future purposes, it is convenient to single out some special matrices. 
A square n x n matrix A with nonzero entries only on the principal 
diagonal is called a diagonal matrix and denoted by 
A = diag(Ai,...,An) := 
/Ai 
0 
... 
0 \ 
0 
A2 ... 
0 
\0 
0 ... A J 
in short, A is diagonal iff ^ = [^jl'^j •" ^'^^^ where Sj is the Kronecker 
symbol. 
S):-
The nx n matrix 
Idn :=diag(l,...,l) = 
is called the identity matrix since for every A G Mp^ni^) and B G Mn,q 
we have 
AIdn = A, 
IdnB = B. 
We say that A = [a*] is upper triangular if a'j = 0 for all {i,j) with 
i > j and lower triangular if a'j = 0 for all (i^j) with j < i. 
1.15 Definition. We say that a n x n square matrix A G Mn,n{^) ^^ 
invertible if there exists B € Mn^n(^) such that AB = Idn andBA 
= Idn-
Since the inverse is trivially unique, we call B the inverse of A and we 
denote it by A~^. 

1.2 Matrices and Linear Operators 
13 
1.16 ^. Show that an upper (lower) triangular matrix A = [a*] € Mn,n{^) 
is invertible 
if and only ii a\ / 0 Vi = 1,..., n. Show that, if A is invertible, A~^ is upper (lower) 
triangular. 
1.17 Definition. Let A = [a'j] G Mm,n{^)' 
The transpose A^ of A is the 
matrix A^ := [6*] G Mn,m(^) 
where 6^ = a^ Vz = 1,..., n, Vj = 1,..., m. 
We obtain A^ from A by exchanging rows with columns, that is, writing 
the successive columns of A from left to right as successive rows from top 
to bottom. 
It is easily seen that 
(i) (A^)^ = A, 
(ii) (AA + /iB)^ = XA^ + /xB^ VA, /i G K, 
(iii) (AB)^ = B^A^VA,B, 
(iv) A is invertible if and only if A^ is invertible and (A~-^)^ = (A^)"-^. 
In particular, in the context of matrices with one upper and one lower 
index, the transposition operation exchanges upper and lower indices; thus 
in the case of row- and column-vectors we have 
(Oi, a2,..., 
ttnf 
= 
a2 
c. Matrices and linear operators 
A map A:K^ 
-^ W^ is said to be linear if 
A(Ax + /iy) = A A(x) -h /i A{y) 
Vx, y G K^, VA, /i G K. 
In particular A{0) = 0 . By induction it is easily seen that A is linear if and 
only if 
3=1 
j=l 
for any A; = 1,2,3,..., for any vi, V2,..., v^ G K^ and scalars A^,..., A^. 
Linear maps from K^ into K^ and m x n matrices are in one-to-one 
correspondence. In fact, we have the following. 
1.18 Proposition. Let A : K"^ ^ K^ be a linear map. Then the matrix 
A:=[A(ei)|A(e2)|...l^(e„)], 
(1.3) 
where (ei, e2,..., en) is the canonical basis ofW^, is the unique matrix 
such that 
A(x) = Ax, 
X = {x\ x^ ..., x^). 
(1.4) 
Conversely, if A e Mn,mi^), 
then the linear map in (1.4) is a linear map 
fromW 
intoK^. 

14 
1. Vectors, Matrices and Linear Systems 
Proof. Assuming A is defined by (1.3), we have for all x = (x^, x^,..., a:^) € K'^ 
n 
n 
A(x) = A{^x^Gi\ 
= ^ x M ( e i ) = Ax. 
i=l 
i-l 
Actually, A is characterized by (1.4), since if ^(x) = Bx Va:, then A{ei) = Be, Vz = 
1,..., n, hence A and B have the same columns. 
Conversely, given A 6 Mm,n{^)^ 
it is trivial to check that the map x —>• A x is a 
linear map from K^ into K^. 
D 
1.19 Remark. The map A -^ A that relates hnear operators and matri-
ces is tied to the {ordered) canonical basis of K!^ and K^. 
If A and A are related by (1.4), we refer to A and A respectively as 
the linear map associated to the matrix A and the matrix associated to 
the linear map A. 
If we denote by ai, a2,..., an the columns of A indexed from the left 
so that A = [ai I a2 I ... | a^], then 
n 
A(x) = Ax = ^ x ' a i , 
x = ( x \ x^,..., x^), 
(1.5) 
that is, for every x = (x^, x^,..., x"^), ^(x) is the linear combination of 
vectors ai, a2,..., a^ of W^ with scalars X 1 X , . . . , x 
as coefficients. 
Observe that A{ei) = ai, ..., A{en) = an, where (ei,e2,... ,en) is the 
canonical basis of K*^. 
1.20 Proposition. Under the correspondence (1.4) between matrices and 
linear maps, the sum of two matrices corresponds to the sum of the asso-
ciated operators, and the product of two matrices corresponds to the com-
position product of the associated operators. 
Proof, (i) Let A , B G Mm,n(K) and let A{x.) := A x and B(K) := Bx. Then we have 
{A -f S)(x) := A(x) + B(x) = A x + B x = (A + B)x. 
(ii) Let A € Mrn,n(K), B € Mp,m{K), 
yl(x) := A x and B(y) := B y Vx € K^, 
Vy G K^. Then 
(B o A)(x) = B(A(x)) = B(A(x)) = B(Ax) = (BA)x. 
D 
1.21 ^. Give a few examples of 2 x 3 and 3 x 2 matrices, their sums and their products 
(whenever this is possible). Show examples for which A B ^ B A and A B = 0 although 
A 7«^ 0 and B 7«^ 0. Finally, show that A x = 0 Vx G K^ implies A = 0. [Hint: Compare 
Exercises 1.76, 1.79 and 1.81.] 
1.22 ^. Show that (^ : R^ —• R is linear if and only if there exist a, 6 G R such that 
(p{{x, y)) 
=ax-hbyWx,yeR. 
1.23 t- Show that v? : R^ -> R is linear if and only if 
(i) (fiiXx, At/)) = Xip{x, y) V(a:, y) G R^ and VA G R+, 
(ii) there exist A and r G R such that (p({cose,sinO)) — Aco9{0 + r) ^9 e R.

of the square [0,1] x [0,1] are in shadow. 
d. Image and kernel 
Let A G M^,n(K) and let A(x) := Ax, x G K*^ be the linear associated 
operator. The kernel and the image of A (or A) are respectively defined 
by 
kerA = ker A : - {x G K^ I A(x) - o}, 
1mA = Im A : - | y G K^ I 3 x G K'' such that ^(x) = y | . 
Trivially, kerA is a linear subspace of the source space K"^, and it easy 
to see that the following three claims are equivalent: 
(i) A is injective, 
(ii) kerA = {0}, 
(iii) ai, a2,..., an are linearly independent in W^. 
If one of the previous claims holds, we say that A is nonsingular, although 
in the current literature nonsingular usually refers to square matrices. Also 
observe that A may be nonsingular only if m > n. 
Also Im A — Im A is a linear subspace of the target space K"^, and by 
definition lm.A = Spanjai, a2,..., a^}. The dimension of Im A = Im A is 
called the rank of A (or of A) and is denoted by Rank A (or Rank A). By 
definition Rank A is the maximal number of linearly independent columns 
o/A, in particular Rank A < min(n, m). Moreover, it is easy to see that 
the following claims are equivalent 

16 
1. Vectors, Matrices and Linear Systems 
(i) A is surjective, 
(ii) ImA = K^, 
(iii) Rank A = m. 
Therefore A may be surjective only if m < n. 
The following theorem is crucial. 
1.25 Theorem (Rank formula). For every matrix A G Mm,n{^) ^^e 
have 
dim Im A = n — dim ker A. 
Proof. Let (vi, V2,..., v^) be a basis of ker A. According to Theorem 1.7 we can 
choose (n — k) vectors e^^i, . . . , en of the standard basis of K" in such a way 
that vi, V2,..., Vfc,efe_|_i,... ,en form a basis of K'^. Then one easily checks that 
(A(efc_|_i),..., A(en)) is a basis of Im A, thus concluding that dimlm A = n — k. 
D 
A first trivial consequence of the rank formula is the following. 
1.26 Corollary. Let A e M^,n(K). 
(i) If m <n, then dim ker A > 0. 
(ii) If m > n, then A is nonsingular, i.e., ker A = {0}, if and only if 
Rank A is maximal, Rank A = n. 
(iii) Ifm, = n, i.e., A is a square matrix, then the following two equivalent 
claims hold: 
a) Let A{K) := Ax be the associated linear map. Then A is surjec-
tive if and only if A is injective. 
b) Ax = h is solvable for any choice of h e K^ if and only if 
A{-x) = 0 has zero as a unique solution. 
Proof, (i) Prom the rank formula we have dim ker A = n — dim I m A > 7 2 — m > 0 . 
(ii) Again from the rank formula, dim Im A = n — dim ker A = n = min(n, m). 
(iii) (a) Observe that A is injective if and only if ker A = {0}, equivalently if and only 
if dim ker A = 0, and that A is surjective if and only if Im A = K^, 
i.e., dimlm A = 
m = n. The conclusion follows from the rank formula. 
(iii) (b) The equivalence between (iii) (a) and (iii) (b) is trivial. 
D 
Notice that (i) and (ii) imply that A : K^ ^ W^ may be injective and 
surjective only if n = m. 
1.27 %, Show the following. 
Proposition. Let A € Mn,nOQ and A(x.) \— Ax. The following claims are equivalent: 
(i) A is injective and 
surjective, 
(ii) A is nonsingular, 
i.e., ker A = {0}, 
(iii) A is 
surjective, 
(iv) there exists B G Mn,n{^) 
such that B A = Idn, 
(v) there exists B 6 Mn,ni)^) 
such that A B = Idn, 
(vi) A is invertible, i.e., there exists a matrix B G Mn,n{^) 
such that B A = A B = 
Idn. 

1.2 Matrices and Linear Operators 
17 
An important and less trivial consequence of the rank formula is the 
following. 
1.28 Theorem (Rank of the transpose). Let A e Mm^n- Then we 
have 
(i) the maximum number of linearly independent columns and the max-
imum number of linearly independent rows are equal, i.e., 
Rank A = Rank A^, 
(ii) let p := Rank A. Then there exists a nonsingular p x p square sub-
matrix of A. 
Proof, (i) Let A = [a* ], let ai, a 2 , . . . , an be the columns of A and let p := Rank A. We 
assume without loss of generality that the first p columns of A are linearly independent 
and we define B as the mxp submatrix formed by these columns, B := [ai | a2 | ... | ap]. 
Since the remaining columns of A depend linearly on the columns of B, we have 
p 
a^ = J2'''j^i 
Vfc = l , . . . , m , V j = p + l , . . . , n 
i=i 
for some R = [r*] G Mp^n-p{^)- 
In terms of matrices, 
I ap-f 1 ap-f 2 . •. an = I ai 
... 
ap I R = BR, 
hence 
A= [ B I B R I -=B[ldp|R]. 
Taking the transposes, we have A-^ G Mn,mO^)j B-^ G Mp^rnO^) ^^^ 
A^ = 
R ^ 
(1.6) 
Since [Idp | R ] ^ is trivially injective, we infer that ker A ^ = kerB^, hence by the rank 
formula 
Rank A"^ = m — dim ker A ^ = m — dim ker B-^ = Rank B ^ , 
and we conclude that 
Rank A ^ = RankB-^ < min(m, p) = p = Rank A. 
Finally, by applying the above to the matrix A ^ , we get the opposite inequality 
Rank A = Rank(A-^)-^ < RankA-^, hence the conclusion. 
(ii) With the previous notation, we have Rank B-^ = Rank B = p. Thus B has a set of 
p independent rows. The submatrix S of B made by these rows is a square pxp 
matrix 
with Rank S = Rank S-^ = p, hence nonsingular.

1.29 1. Let A G Mm,n{K), 
let A(x) := Ax and let (vi, V2,..., Vn) be a basis of K^. 
Show the following: 
(i) A is injective if and only if the vectors A(vi), A(v2), •.., A{vn) of K^ are linearly 
independent, 
(ii) A is surjective if and only if {A(vi), A(v2),..., A(vn)} spans K^, 
(iii) A is bijective iff {^(vi), A(v2),..., A(vn)} is a basis of K"^.

e. Grassmann's formula 
Let U and V be two linear subspaces of K^. Clearly, both U (IV and 
[/ -h F := | x G K"" I X = u + V for some u G C/ and v E F | 
are linear subspaces of K^. When U OV = {0}, we say that U -^ V is 
the direct sum of U and V and we write [/ 0 F for C/ + V. If moreover 
U ® V = K^, we say that U and V are supplementary subspaces. The 
following formula is very useful. 
1.30 Proposition (Grassmann's formula). LetU andV be linear sub-
spaces ofK^. 
Then 
dim{U + y) + dim(C/ nV) = dimU-\- dimV. 
Proof. Let (ui, U2,. •., u^) and (vi, V2,..., v^) be two bases of U and V respectively. 
The vectors ui, U2,..., u/^, vi, V2,..., v^ span U -{-V, and a subset of them form a 
basis of U -\-V. In particular, dim.{U + V) = RankL where L is the n x {h-\-k) 
matrix 
defined by 
L := l^ui I ... I u^ I - VI I ... I - VfcJ. 
Moreover, a vector x = XlILi ^^^i G K'^ is in L^ fl V if and only if there exist unique 
y^^ y^^- • • ^ y^ such that 
X = x^u\ + ... x^Wh = 2/^vi H 
h 2/^Vfc, 
thus, if and only if the vector w := (—x^, —x^,..., —x^, y^, y^,..., 
y^) € K^'^'^ be-
longs to kerL. Consequently, the linear map (j) : K^'^'^ —v K^, 
h 
is injective and surjective from kerL onto UHV. It follows that dini{U OV) = dim kerL 
and, by the rank formula, 
dim(C/ nV) + dim{U + V) = dim kerL -h RankL = h + k = dimU + dimV. 
D 
1.31 f. Notice that the proof of Grassmann's formula is in fact a procedure to compute 
two bases oiU-\-V 
and UOV starting from two bases of U and V. The reader is invited 
to choose two subspaces U and V of K" and to compute the basis of U -\- V and of 
unv. 
f. Parametric and implicit equations of a subspace 
1.32 Parametric equation of a straight line in K"^. Let a 7^ 0 and let q be two 
vectors in K^. The parametric 
equation of a straight line through q and direction a is 
the map r : K —>• K*^ given by r(A) := Aa + q, AG K. The image of r 
| x G R^ 3 A such that x = Aa -h q | 
is the straight line through q and direction a. 

1.2 Matrices and Linear Operators 
19 
Figure 1.4. Straight line through q and direction a. 
We have r(0) = q and r(l) = a -h q. In other words, r{t) passes through q and 
a -f q. Moreover, x is on the straight Une passing through q and a -f q if and only if 
there exists t E K such that x = i a + b, or, more explicitly 
^2 =ta^ 
-\-q'^, 
[x^ = ta^ -\-q'" 
(1.7) 
In kinematics, K — R and the map t —• r{t) := ta + q gives the position at time t of a 
point moving with constant vector velocity a starting at q at time t = 0 on the straight 
line through q and a + q. 
1.33 Implicit equation of a straight line in K^. We want to find a representa-
tion of the straight line (1.7) which makes no use of the free parameter t. 
Since a 7«^ 0, one of its components is nonzero. Assume for instance a^ ^ 0, we can 
solve the first equation in (1.7) to get t = {q^ — x^)/a^ 
and, substituting the result 
into the last (n — 1) equations, we find a system of (n — 1) constraints on the variable 
x = (a;\ a:^,..., x^) e K^,

1.35 Parametric and implicit equations of a 2-plane in K^. Given two linearly 
independent vectors vi,V2 in R^ and a point q G M^, we call the parametric 
equation

[

Of course v? is Unear iff q = 0. The 2-plane determined by this parametrization is defined 
by 
n : = I m ( ^ = | x G M^ I x - q G I m A J . 
Suppose vi = (a, 6, c) and V2 = {d, e, / ) so that 
Because of Theorem 1.28, there is a nonsingular 2 x 2 submatrix B of A and, without 
loss of generality, we can suppose that B = ( 
1. We can then solve the system 
\b 
e 
\x^ - q^ = ba -\- e(3 
in the unknown (a,/3), thus finding a and /3 as linear functions of x^ — q^ and x^ — 
(p'. Then, substituting into the third equation, we can eliminate (a, ^) from the last 
equation, obtaining an implicit equation, or constraint, on the independent variables, 
of the form 
r (x^ - gl) + 5 {x^ -q^) + t (x^ - q^) = 0, 
that describes the 2-plane without any further reference to the free parameters 
{a,0). 
More generally, let W he a. linear subspace of dimension fc in K^, also 
called a k-plane (through the origin) of K"^. If vi, V2,..., v^ is a basis of 
W, we can write H^ = ImL where 
L : = 
v i 
V2 
Vfc 
We call X -^ L{x) 
:= Lx the parametric equation of W generated 
by (vi, V2,..., Vfc). Of course a different basis of W yields a different 
parametrization. 
We can also write any subspace W of dimension k a.sW = ker A where 
A G Mn-k,n{^)' 
We call it an implicit representation of W. Notice that 
since ker A = W, we have Rank A-^ = Rank A = n — A: by Theorem 1.28 
and the rank formula. Hence the rows of A are n — k linearly independent 
vectors of K*^. 
1.36 Remark. A A;-dimensional subspace of K" is represented by means 
of k free parameters, i.e., the image of K^ through a nondegenerate para-
metric equation, or by a set of independent {n — k) constraints given by 
linearly independent scalar equations in the ambient variables. 

1.2 Matrices and Linear Operators 
21 
1.37 Parametric and implicit representations. One can go back and forth from 
the parametric to the impUcit representation in several ways. For instance, start with 
W = ImL where L G M^^/c(K) has maximal rank, RankL = k. By Theorem 1.28 there 
is a A: X A: nonsingular matrix submatrix M of L. Assume that M is made by the first 
few rows of L so that 
L = 
M 
N 
where N G M^-kM^)- 
Writing x as x = (x',x'0 with x' € K^ and x'' G K'^"'', the 
parametric equation x = Lt, t G K'^, writes as 
I x' = Mt, 
I x'' = Nt. 
(1.8) 
As M is invertible, 
(
t = M - i x ' , 
N M - i x ' = x". 
We then conclude that x G ImL if and only if N M ~ ^ x ' = x". The latter is an implicit 
equation for W, that we may write as Ax = 0 if we define A G Mn-fc,n(K) by 
A = 
N M -
-Idfc 
Conversely, let W = ker A where A G Mn,fc(K) has Rank A = n — k. Select n — k 
independent columns, say the first n — fc on the left, call B G Mn-k,n-kO^) 
the square 
matrix made by these columns, and split x as x = (x',x'') where x' G K'^~^ and 
x " G K^. Thus A x = 0 rewrites as

Bx' -f Cx'' = 0. 
As B is invertible, the last equation rewrites as x' = —B ^Cx", Therefore x G ker A

1.3 Matrices and Linear Systems 
a. Linear systems and the language of linear algebra 
Matrices and linear operators are strongly tied to linear systems. A linear 
system of m equations and n unknowns has the form 
(1.9) 
[afx^+a^x'^^'" 
+ a^x 
m^n 
Lm 
The m-tuple (6^,..., b^) is the given right-hand side, the n-tuple (x^,..., 
x"^) is the unknown and the numbers {a}}, i = 1,..., m, j = 1,..., n are 
given and called the coefficients of the system. If we think of the coefficients 
as the entries of a matrix A, 
(1.10) 
and we set b := (6\ 6^,..., V^) £ K'", x := {x^, x^,..., 
x") € K", then 
A = K-] =

the system can be written in a compact way as 
Ax = b. 
(1.11) 
Introducing the linear map ^(x) := Ax, (1.9) can be seen as a functional 
equation 
A{x) = b 
(1.12) 
or, denoting by ai, a2,..., an the n-columns of A indexed from left to 
right, as 
x^ai + x^8i2 + • • • -h x'^ain = b. 
(1.13) 
Thus, the discussion of linear systems, linear independence, matrices and 
linear maps are essentially the same, in different languages. The next 
proposition collects these equivalences. 
1.38 Proposition. With the previous notation we have: 
(i) Ax is a linear combination of the columns of A. 
(ii) The following three claims are equivalent: 
a) the system (1.11) or (1.9), is solvable, i.e., there exists x G K^ 
such that Ax = b; 
b) h is a linear combination o/ai, a2,..., an/ 
c) h e ImA. 
(iii) The following four claims are equivalent: 

1.3 Matrices and Linear Systems 
23 
a) Ax = b has at most one solution, 
b) Ax = 0 implies x = 0, 
c) A(x) = 0 has a unique solution, 
d) kerA = {0}, 
e) ai, a2,..., an are linearly independent. 
(iv) ker A is the set of all solutions of the system Ax = 0. 
(v) Im A is the set of all b ^s such that the system Ax = b has at least 
one solution. 
(vi) Let XQ £ W^ he a solution of AXQ — h. Then the set of all solutions 
of Ax = h is the set 
| x o | + ker A := {x G K"" x - XQ G ker A}. 
With the previous notation, we see that b is Unearly dependent of 
ai, a2,..., an if and only if 
Rank 
Thus from Proposition 1.38 (ii) we infer the following. 
ai 
^n 
= Rank ai 
an b 
1.39 Proposition (Rouche-Capelli). With the previous notation, the 
system (1.9) or (1.11) is solvable if and only if 
Rank ai 
an = Rank ai 
an b 
The m X (n + 1) matrix 
/a{

is often called the complete matrix of the system (1.9).

1.41 Solving linear systems. Let us return to the problem of solving 
A x = b, 
where 
A G MmA^)^ 
heK^. 
If n = m and A is nonsingular, then the unique solution is XQ := A~^6. In the general 
case, according to Proposition 1.39, the system is solvable if and only if Rank A = 
Rank [A | b], and if XQ € K"^ is a solution, the set of all solutions is given by {a:o}+ker A. 
Let r := Rank A. Since RankA^ = r, we may assume without loss of generality 
that the first r rows of A are linearly independent and the other rows depend linearly 
on the first r rows. Therefore, if we solve the system of r equations

the remaining equations are automatically fulfilled. So it is enough to solve A x = b in 
the case where A G Mr,n{^) 
and Rank A ^ = Rank A = r. 
We have two cases. If r = n, then A 6 Mr,r is nonsingular, consequently A x = b 
has a unique solution x = A~^b. If r < n , then A has r linearly independent columns, 
say the first r. Denote by R the r x r nonsingular matrix made by these columns, and 
decompose x = (x',x") with x' G K^ and x'' 6 K^"''. Then A x = b writes as 
= b, 
i.e., R x ' + Sx" = b, or x' = R - i ( b - Rx'O- Therefore, 
/ - R - i b ^

concluding that the set of all solutions of the system Ax — b is 
{x I X - Xo G ker A} = | x x - xo G Im L >. 
b. The Gauss elimination method 
As we have seen, linear algebra yields a proper language to discuss linear 
systems, and conversely, most of the constructions in linear algebra reduce 
to solving systems. Moreover, the proofs we have presented are constructive 
and become useful from a numerical point of view if one is able to efficiently 
solve the following two questions: 
(i) find the solution of a nonsingular square system Ax = b, 
(ii) given a set of vectors T c K^, find a subset S CT such that Span S = 
SpanT. 
In this section we illustrate the classical Gauss elimination method 
which efficiently solves both questions. 
1.42 Example. Let us begin with an example of how to solve a linear system. Consider 
the linear system 
Sx + Sy + Qz 
=b2, 
2x-hy-\-z 
=63, 
where x := {x,y,x), 
b := (61,62,63) and 
A x = b 

1.3 Matrices and Linear Systems

We subtract from the second and third equations the first one multipUed by 1/2 and 
1/3 respectively to get the new equivalent system: 
i.e., 
This essentially 
1 
6x-\-18y-\-6z 
=bi, 
< 3x-\-Sy + 6z-^{6x-\-18y-\-6z) 
=-^bi-\-b2, 
[ 
2x-^ y-\-z - l{6x + 18y + 6z) 
= - § 6 1 + 6 3 , 
( 6x-\-lSy 
+ 6z 
= 61, 
< 
- i / + 3z 
= - § 6 1 + 6 2 , 
[ 
-by-z 
=-§61+63. 
requires us to solve the system of the last two equations 
f - 2 / + 32 
= - § 6 1 + 6 2 , 
\ 
-5y-z 
= - § 6 1 + 6 3 . 
(1.15) 
We now apply the same argument to this last system, i.e., we subtract from the last 
equation the first one multiplied by 5 to get 
(
6x-\-lSy-\-6z 
= 6 1 , 
-y + Sz 
= - § 6 1 + 6 2 , 
-52/ - z - 5(-2/ + 3^) 
= - § 6 1 + 63 - 5(-§6i + 62), 
i.e., 
(
6x-\-18y-\-6z 
= 6 1 , 
-y + Sz 
= - § 6 1 + 6 2 , 
- I 6 2 
= 2 6 1 - 5 6 2 + 6 3 . 
This system has exsictly the same solution as the original one and, moreover, it is easily 
solvable starting from the last equation. Finally, we notice that the previous method 
produced two matrices 
U is upper triangular and L is lower triangular with 1 in the principal diagonal, so the 
original system A x = b rewrites as 
U x = Lb. 
Since L = [/*] is invertible (l] = 1 Vi) and x is arbitrary, we can rewrite the last formula 
as a decomposition formula for A, 
A = L - i U . 
The algorithm we have just described in Example 1.42, that transforms 
the proposed 3 x 3 square system into a triangular system, extends to 
systems with an arbitrary number of unknowns and equations, and it is 
called the Gauss elimination method. Moreover, it is particularly efficient, 
but does have some drawbacks from a numerical point of view.

Ax = 0 
(1.16) 
be a linear homogeneous system with m equations, n unknowns and a 
coefficient matrix given by 
A =

</ 
Starting from the left, we denote by ji the index of the first column of A 
that has at least one nonzero element. Then we reorder the rows into a 
new matrix B of the same dimensions, in such a way that the element 6]^ 
is nonzero and all columns with index less than ji are zero, 
B = [6]] =

where * denotes the unspecified entries. We then set pi := 6j^, and for 
i = 2,..., m we subtract from the ith row of B the first row of B multiplied 
by —b'j^/pi. The resulting matrix therefore has the following form 
Ai := 
/O

0 pi 
* ...

* . . . * / 
where pi ^ 0, below pi all entries are zero and * denotes the unspecified 
entries. 
We then transform Ai into A2, A2 into A3, and so on, operating as 
previously, but on the submatrix of Ai of rows of index respectively larger 
than 2,3, 
The algorithm of course stops when there are no more rows 
and/or columns. 
The resulting matrix produced this way is not uniquely determined as 
there is freedom in exchanging the rows. However, a resulting matrix that 
we call a Gauss reduced matrix, is clearly upper triangular if A is a square 
matrix, m = n, and in general has the following stair-shaped form

Finally, since 
o multiplying one of the equations of the system Ax = 0 by a nonzero 
scalar, 
o exchanging the order of the equations, 
o summing a multiple of one equation and another equation, 
produces a linear system with the same solution as the initial system, and 
observing that the Gauss elimination procedure operates with transforma-
tions of this type, we conclude that GAX = 0 has the same solution as the 
initial system. 
We now discuss the solvability of the system Lx = b, if L is stair-
shaped. 
1.43 Proposition. Let Li be a stair-shaped mxn 
matrix. Suppose that L 
has r pivots, r < min(n, m). Then a basis o/ImL is given by the r columns 
containing the pivots, and the system Lx = b, b = (6^, 6^,..., b^)^, has 
a solution if and only if¥^^ 
= ...=: 6"^ z= 0. 
Proof. Since there are r pivots and at most one pivot per row, the last rows of L are 
identically zero, hence ImL C {b G W^ | b = (6i, 62,..., 6r, 0 , . . . , 0)}. Consequently,

dim Im L < r. On the other hand the r columns that contain the pivots are in Im L and 
are hnearly independent, hence Rank L = r, and Im L = {(6^, 6^,..., 6^, 0,..., 0) | 6* G

The Gauss elimination procedure preserves several properties of the 
original matrix A. 
1.44 Theorem. Let A G Mm,n{^) 
O'fid l^i G A be one of the matrices 
resulting from the Gauss elimination procedure. Then 
(i) ker A = kerGA, 
(ii) Rank A = Rank G A = number of pivots of GA? 
(iii) letji,J2, " ",jr be the indices of the columns of the pivots O/GA? then 
the columns of A with the same indices are linearly independent, 
Proof, (i) is a rewriting of the equivalence of Ax = 0 with G A X = 0. 
(ii) Because of (i), the rank formula yields Rank A = RankGA, and Rank G A equals 
the number of pivots by Proposition 1.43. 
(iii) Let A = [ai | a2 | ... | an] and let

we find, on account of Theorem 1.44, that

where G A G Mm,n{^) is a Gauss reduced matrix of A and S G M^,rn(K). 
Moreover, if the elimination procedure has been carried out without any 
permutation of the rows, then S is a lower triangular matrix with 1 as 
entries in the principal diagonal, hence it is invertible. Since for every b 
the system Ax = b is equivalent to GAX = Sb, we then have 
GAX = S b - S A x 
V X G K ^ , 
thus concluding that A = S ~ ^ G A . In particular. 

30 
1. Vectors, Matrices and Linear Systems 
1.50 Proposition (LR decomposition). Let A G Mn,n(K) be a square 
matrix. If the elimination procedure proceeds without any permutation of 
the rows, we can decompose A as A = LR, where R = G A is the resulting 
Gauss reduced matrix and "L is a suitable lower triangular matrix with 1 
as entries in the principal diagonal o/L. 
In general, howewer, the permutation of the rows must be taken into 
account. For this purpose, let us fix some notation. Recall that a permu-
tation of { 1 , . . . , m} is a one-to-one map a : { 1 , . . . , m} —> { 1 , . . . , m}. 
The set of all permutations of m elements is denoted by Vm- For every 
permutation a of m elements, define the associated permutation 
matrix 
R a e Mm,m{^) 
by 
R . := 
where (ei, 62,..., e^^) is the canonical basis of W^. 
Let A E Mm,n{^)' If o- permutes the indices of the rows of A, then the 
resulting matrix is R^A. Now denote by ^(A) the Gauss reduced matrix, 
if it exists, obtained by the Gauss ehmination procedure starting from the 
top row and proceeding without any permutation of the rows. 
Let G A be a Gauss reduced form of A. Then G A = ^(Ra A) for some 
permutation a oi m elements. 
Now fix a Gauss reduced form G A of A, and let a be such that G A = 
^(R^A). Write Ax = y as (R<jA)x = R^-y = Idm(Ro-y) and let 
B : = R^A 
Id 
Then B and R^-A may be reduced without any permutation of the rows, 
hence by the above 
g{B) = [^(RaA) I S] = [GA 
where S is lower triangular with all entries in the principal diagonal equal 
to 1. Therefore G A X = SR^-y = SR^-Ax Vx, that is. 
G A = SRo-A. 
(1.18) 
When A G Mn,n(^) is a square matrix, (1.18) shows that A is invert-
ible if and only if a Gauss reduced form G A of A is invertible and 
. - 1 
G A 
SRO^. 
In practice, let (ei, 62,..., e^) be the canonical basis of K^ and let 
A~^ =: [vi IV2 I ... I Vn]. Let i = 1,... n. To compute v^, we observe that 
Vi = A~^e^, i.e., Av^ = e^. Thus, using the Gauss elimination procedure, 
from (1.18) Vi is a solution of GAV^ = SR^e^. Now, since G A is upper 
triangular, this last system is easily solved by inductively computing the 
components of v^ starting from the last, upward.

1.4 Determinants 
The notion of determinant originated with the observation of Gabriel 
Cramer (1704-1752) and Carl Priedrich Gauss (1777-1855) that the pro-
cess of elimination of unknowns when solving a linear system of equa-
tions amounts to operating with the indices of the associated matrix. De-
velopments of this observation due to Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827), 
Alexandre Vandermonde (1735-1796), Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) 
and Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), who introduced the word determi-
nant, were then accomplished with a refined study of the properties of the 
determinant by Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) and Jacques Binet 
(1786-1856). Here we illustrate the main properties of the determinant. 
1.51 Determinant and area in '. 
A = 
Let 
a 
b 
c 
d

be a 2 X 2 matrix. It is easily seen that A is not singular, i.e., the linear homogeneous 
system 
{
ax + 62/ = 0, 
ex -\- dy = () 
has zero, {x^y) — (0,0), as a unique solution if and only if ad — he ^ 0. The number 
ad — he is the determinant 
of the matrix A, 
det A = det (

One immediately notices the combinatorial characteristic of this definition: if A = [a*], 
then det A — a\a2 — a\a\. 
Let a := (a, c) and b := (6, d) be the two columns of the matrix A in (1.19). The 
elementary area of the parallelogram spanned by a and b with vertices (0,0), {a^e)^ 
(6, d) and (a -h 6, c + d), is given by 
Area(T) = |a| |b| | sin(9| 
where 6 is the angle ab, irrespective of the orientation, see Figure 1.7. On the other 
hand, by Carnot's formula |a| |b| cosO = ah-{- ed, hence

I.e., 
Area(T) = |detA|. 
We may think of det A as of the area of T with sign. In fact, the sign of det A may 
be used to define the sign of the angle formed by the vectors a and b. The angle a b is 
positively {negatively) oriented if det[a| b] > 0 (det[a| b] < 0). 
Angles with sign in geometry are also modelled by complex multiplication, iden-
tifying E^ with C. Using the previous notation, setting z := a -\- ib, w = c + id we 
have 
zw = {a-\- ib){c — id) = {ac -h bd) + i{bc — ad) = ( a • b )]jj2 -\-i det A. 
Let vi, V2 G M^. As we have seen, the determinant of the matrix [vi | V2] 
is not zero iff vi and V2 are linearly independent. Actually, for any n > 1 
there is a real function defined on n x n matrices that tells us whether the 
n columns of the matrix are linearly independent: the determinant 
One 
of the simplest ways to define it is as follows. 
We recall that a permutation of {l,...,n} is a one-to-one map a : 
{ 1 , . . . , n} -^ { 1 , . . . , n}. The set of permutations of n objects, denoted 
by Vn is a group with respect to the operation of composition. A permu-
tation that exchanges two adjacent indices and leaves the other indices 
unchanged is called a transposition. Transpositions are elementary permu-
tations in the sense that each permutation a can be obtained by composing 

1.4 Determinants 
33 
subsequent transpositions. Of course, there are several ways to decompose 
a given permutation into elementary transpositions, but the parity or odd-
ity of the number of transpositions needed to realize a given permutation 
a depends only on the permutation a. We define the signature^ or sign^ of 
the permutation a the number 
f+1 
ifcr 
\ - l 
if (J 
. 
. ^ 
. , ^ .X ^ decomposes in an even number of transpositions, 
decomposes in an odd number of transpositions. 
1.52 Definition. Let A = [a^] e Mn,n(IK), n > 1. The determinant of A 
is then defined by 
detA :=:= Yl ( - i r < i ) « ^ ( 2 ) •••<(„)• 
(1-20) 
Notice that det A is a sum of products and each product contains just one 
element from each row and each column, and the sum, apart from the sign, 
is extended to all possible choices. 
1.53 Example. Of course for matrix A in (1.19) we again get det A = ad — be. Going 
b£u:k to the area, one shows that given 3 vectors vi, V2, V3 6 M^ and denoting by T the 
polyhedra generated by these vectors, we still have 
Vol3(T) = |det[vi|v2|v3]|. 
For n vectors vi, V2,. •., Vn G M", let 
L : = [vi I V2 I . . . I Vn] G 
Mn,n{^) 
and let L{x) := Lx. If Q is the unit cube of M.'^, 
Q:= !yi = ( x \ x^,...,x'')\o<x' 
<1 Vi}, 
we define the n-dimensional volume of T := L{Q) by 
Voln(T) :==|detL|. 
It is useful to think of the determinant as a function of the columns of 
the matrix. In fact, we have the following. 
1.54 Theorem. The determinant onnxn 
matrices is the unique function 
det : Mn,n{^) -^ ^ such that, when seen as a function of columns, it is

(NORMALIZED); det Idn = 1. 
Notice that because of (i) the alternating property can be equivalently 
formulated by saying that det A == 0 if A has two equal columns. 
Proof. Clearly the right-hand side of (1.20) fulfills the conditions (i), (ii), (iii). To prove 
uniqueness, suppose that D : Mn,ni^) 
~^ ^ fulfills (i), (ii), (iii) of Theorem 1.54. Write 
A = [aj] G Mn,n{^) 
as A = [ai I a2 I ... | an] where 
n 
j = l 
(ei, 6 2 , . . . , Bn) being the canonical basis of K". Then by (i) 
D{A) =

' ' ' <(n)^([ei I • • . I en]) 
^(l),...,^(n) 
where cr(l), cr(2),..., a{n) vary in { 1 , . . . , n}. Since by (ii) D{A) = 0 if A has two equal 
columns, we infer that cr(i) ^ a{j) ii i ^ j , i.e., that cr is a permutation of (1, 2 , . . . , n). 
Since £>([e^(i) | ... | e^(^)]) = (-l)^D([ei | ... | en]) and D([ei | ... | en]) = 1, we con-
clude that D{A) agrees with the right-hand side of (1.20), hence D{A) = det A. 
D 
The determinant can also be computed by means of an inductive for-
mula. 
1.55 Definition. Let A = [aj] E Mn^nOQ, n > 1. A r-minor of A is a 
r X r suhmatrix of A, that is a matrix obtained by choosing the common 
entries of a choice of r rows and r columns of A and relabeling the indices 
from 1 to r. For i,j = l,...,nwe 
define the complementing (i, j)-minor of 
the matrix A, denoted by M^(A), as the (n — 1) x (n — l)-minor obtained 
by removing the ith row and the jth column from A. 
1.56 Theorem (Laplace). Let A e Mn,n(^), n>l. Then 
det A : -
A 
z/n = 1, 
X;=i(-lP+'«] detMJ(A) 
ifn>l. 
(1.21) 
Proof. Denote by D(A) the right-hand side of (1.21). Let us prove that D{A) fulfills 
the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of Theorem 1.54, thus D{A) = det A. The conditions (i) 
and (ii) of Theorem 1.54 are trivially fulfilled by D{A). Let us also show that (iii) holds, 
i.e., if aj = a^+i for some j , then D(A) — 0. We proceed by induction on j . By the 
induction step, det M^(A) = Q ioi h ^ jj + 1, hence D{A) = (-l)-?+ia] det M](A) + 
(—l)^aL ^ d e t M L j(A). Since aj = ^j-fi? ^^^^ consequently, Mj(A) = Mj_j_^(A), we 
conclude that D{A) = 0 .

Prom (1.20) we immediately infer the following.

1.57 Theorem (Determinant of the transpose). We have 
det A^ = det A 
for all A G Mn,n(lK). 
One then shows the following important theorem. 
1.58 Theorem (Binet's formula). Let A and B be two nxn 
matrices. 
Then 
det(BA) = d e t B det A. 
Proof. Let A -: [a]] = [ai | ... | an], B = [6j] = [bi | ... | bn] and let ( e i , . . . ,en) be 
the canonical basis of K"^. Since

As stated in the beginning, the determinant gives us a criterion to 
decide whether a matrix is nonsingular or, equivalently, whether n vectors 
are linearly independent. 
1.59 Theorem. A nxn matrix A is nonsingular if and only if det 
A^^. 
Proof. If A is nonsingular, there is a B G Mn.ni]^) 
such that A B = Idn, see Exer-
cise 1.27; by Binet's formula det A det B = 1. In particular det A ^ 0. 
Conversely, if the columns of A are linearly dependent, then it is not difficult to see 
that det A = 0 by using Theorem 1.54. 
• 
Let A = [a^] be an m x n matrix. We say that the characteristic of A 
is r if all p-minors with p > r have zero determinant and there exists a 
r-minor with nonzero determinant. 
1.60 Theorem (Kronecker). The rank and the characteristic of a ma-
trix are the same. 
Proof. Let A 6 Mm,ni^) 
and let r := Rank A. For any minor B, trivially RankB < 
Rank A = r, hence every p-minor is singular, i.e., has zero determinant, if p > n. On 
the other hand. Theorem 1.28 implies that there exists a nonsingular r-minor B of A, 
hence with det B ^ 0. 
• 
The defining inductive formula (1.21) requires us to compute the de-
terminant of the complementing minors of the elements of the first row; 
on account of the alternance, we can use any row, and on account of The-
orem 1.57, we can use any column. More precisely,

1.62 ^. To compute the determinant of a square n x n matrix A we can use a Gauss 
reduced matrix G A of A. Show that det A = (—1)*^ n r = i ( ^ A ) i where a is the permu-
tation of rows needed to compute G A , and the product is the product of the pivots. 
It is useful to rewrite Laplace's formulas using matrix multiplication. 
Denote by cof(A) = [c*] the square n x n matrix, called the matrix of 
CO factors of A, defined by 
c}:=(-l)^+^detM^(A). 
Notice the exchange between the row and column indices: the (z, j) en-
try of cof(A) is (—1)*"^-^ times the determinant of the complementing 
(j, z)-minor. Using the cofactor matrix, Laplace's formulas in Theorem L61 
rewrite in matrix form as

using linearity and the alternating property of the determinant. In fact, solving A x = b

2. Vector Spaces and Linear 
Maps 
The linear structure of K^ is shared by several mathematical objects. We 
have already noticed that the set of m x n matrices satisfies the laws of 
sum and multiplication by scalars. The aim of this chapter is to introduce 
abstract language and illustrate some facts related to linear structure. In 
particular, we shall see that in every finite-dimensional vector space we 
can introduce the coordinates related to a basis and explain how the co-
ordinates description of intrinsic objects changes when we change the co-
ordinates, i.e., the basis. 
2.1 Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
a. Definition 
Let K be a commutative field, here it will be either R or C. 
2.1 Definition. A vector space over the field K is a set X endowed with 
(i) an operation -\- : X x X -^ X^ called the sum, that makes X a 
commutative group, i.e., 
a) {x-\-y)-\- z = x + {y-\- z), x + y = y-\-x,'ix,y 
e X, 
b) there exists an element 0 e X called the zero element, such that 
x-hO = 0-hx = x V x G X , 
c) for every x £ X there exists —XEX 
such that x -\- {—x) = 0, 
(ii) an operation of multiplication by a scalar - : K x X —^ X that as-
sociates to every X e K and x £ X an element of X denoted by \x 
such that 
a) \{x -\-y) = \x-\- Xy, (A -h fi)x = Xx -i- fix, 
b) X{/jix) = {Xfi)x, 1' X = X. 
In particular, {—l)x = —x Vx G X; we therefore write x — y instead of 
x-h(-y). 
The elements of a vector space over K are called vectors, and the ele-
ments of K are called scalars. The product of a vector by scalars allows us 
to regard a vector at all scales. 

42 
2. Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
2.2 Example. As we have seen, K^ for n > 1, and all the linear subspaces of K^ are 
vector spaces over K. Also, the space of m x n matrices with entries in K, Mm,n{^), 
is 
a vector space over K, with the two operations of sum of matrices and multiplication of 
a matrix by a scalar, see Section 1.2. 
2.3 Example. Let X be any set. Then the class T{X, K) of all functions ip : X —^ K 
is a vector space with the two operations of sum and multiplication by scalars defined 
by 
{if + ip)ix) := ip{x) -f 7p(x), 
(A(/?)(a:) := X(p{x) 
Va: G X. 
Several subclasses of functions are vector spaces, actually linear subspaces of 
J^(X,K). 
For instance, 
o the set C°([0,1],]R) of all continuous functions cp : [0,1] —>• R, the set of k-
diflFerentiable functions from [0,1] into R, the set C'^([0,1],R) of all functions with 
continuous derivatives up to the order k, the set C"^([0,1],R) of infinitely differen-
tiable functions, 
o the set of polynomials of degree less than /c, the set of all polynomials, 
o the set of all complex trigonometric polynomials, 
o the set of Riemann summable functions in ]0,1[, 
o the set of all sequences with values in K. 
We now begin the study of properties that depend only on the hnear 
structure of a vector space, independently of specific examples. 
b. Subspaces, linear combinations and bases 
2.4 Definition. A subset W of a vector space X is called a linear sub-
space, or shortly a subspace of X, if 
(i) 
OeW, 
(ii) "^ x,y eW 
we have x ~\-y eW, 
(iii) \/ X eW 
and W XeK 
we have Xx G W. 
Obviously the element 0 is the zero element of X and the operations of 
sum and multiplication by scalars are as those in X. 
In a vector space we may consider the finite linear combinations of 
elements of X with coefficients in K, i.e., 
^ A ^ ^ . eX 
i=l 
where A^, A^,..., A'^ G K and vi, t'2, • • •, ^n ^ X. Notice that we have 
indexed both the vectors and the relative coefficients, and we use the stan-
dard notation on the indices: a list of vectors has lower indices and a list 
of coefficients has upper indices. 
It is readily seen that a subset VF C X is a subspace of X if and only 
if all finite linear combinations of elements of X with coefficients in K 
belong to W. Moreover, given a set 5 C X, the family of all finite linear 
combinations of elements of 5 is a subspace of X called the span of S and 
denoted by Span S. 
We say that a finite number of vectors are linearly dependent if there 
are scalars, not all zero, such that

or, in other words, if one vector is a linear combination of the others. If 
n vectors are not hnearly dependent, we say that they are linearly inde-
pendent More generally, we say that a set S of vectors is a set of linearly 
independent vectors whenever any finite list of elements of S is made by 
hnearly independent vectors. Of course linearly independent vectors are 
distinct and nonzero. 
2.5 Definition. Let X be a vector space. A set S of linearly independent 
vectors such that Span 5 = X is called a basis of X. 
A set A C X is a maximal independent set of X if A is a set of linearly 
independent vectors and, whenever we add to it a vector w € X\A, 
Au{w} 
is not a set of linearly independent vectors. 
Thus a basis of X is a subset S C X such that 
(i) every a: G X is a finite linear combination of some elements of S. 
Equivalently, for every x e X there is a map A : 5 ^ K such that 
X = J2ves -^C^)^ ^iid X{v) = 0 except for a finite number of elements 
(depending on x) of 5, 
(ii) each finite subset of 5 is a set of linearly independent vectors. 
It is easy to prove that for every x e X the representation x = J2ves ^(^)^ 
is unique if 5 is a basis of X. 
Using the same proof as in Proposition 1.5 we then infer 
2.6 Proposition. Let X be a vector space over K. Then S C X is a basis 
of X if and only if S is a maximal independent set. 

44 
2. Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
Using Zorn's lemma, see [GM2], one can also show the following. 
2.7 Theorem. Every vector space X has a basis. Moreover, two bases 
have the same cardinality. 
2.8 Definition. A vector space X is finite dimensional if X has a finite 
basis. 
In the most interesting infinite-dimensional vector spaces, one can show 
the basis has nondenumerable cardinality. Later, we shall see that the 
introduction of the notion of limit, i.e., of a new structure on X, improves 
the way of describing vectors. Instead of trying to see every a; G X as a 
finite linear combination of elements of a nondenumerable basis, it is better 
to approximate it by a suitable sequence of finite linear combinations of a 
suitable countable set. 
For finite-dimensional vector spaces. Theorem 2.7 can be proved more 
directly, as we shall see later. 
2.9 f. Show that the space of all polynomials and C^([0,1], M) are infinite-dimensional 
vector spaces. 
c. Lifear maps 
2.10 Definition. Let X and Y be two vector spaces over K. A map (p : 
X -^Y 
is called K-linear, or linear for short, if 
(p{x -\-y) = (f{x) -h (p(y) 
and 
(p{Xx) = X(p{x) 
for any x,y E X and A G K. 
A linear map that is infective and surjective is called a (linear) isomor-
phism. 
Of course, ii (p : X ^Y 
is hnear, we have (p{0) = 0 and, by induction, 
2.11 Proposition. Let (p : X ^^Y 
be linear. Then 
k 
k 
i=l 
i=l 
for any A^, A^,..., A^ G K and e\, 62,..., Cn G X. In particular, a linear 
map is fixed by the values it takes on a basis. 
The space of linear maps (p : X -^Y 
between two vector spaces X and 
y, denoted by £(X, Y"), is a vector space over K with the operations of 
sum and multiplication by scalars defined in terms of the operations on Y 
by 
{ip + ip){x) := (p(x) + ip{y), 
(A(^)(x) = X(p(x) 
for all (p,ip e C{X, Y) and A G R. Notice also that the composition of linear 
maps is again a linear map, and that, if (/? : X -> F is an isomorphism, 
then the inverse map (p~^ :Y -^ X is also an isomorphism. 
It is easy to check the following. 

2.1 Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
45 
2.12 Proposition. Let ip : X -^Y 
be a linear map, 
(i) If S C X spans W C X, then (p{S) spans ip{W), 
(ii) If ei, 62,..., Cn are linearly dependent in X, then ^(ei),..., (^(cn) 
are linearly dependent in Y. 
(iii) ^ is injective if and only if any list (ei, 62,..., Cn) of linearly inde-
pendent vectors in X is mapped into a list ((^(ei),(/?(e2),... ,(p{en)) 
of linearly independent vectors in X. 
(iv) The following claims are equivalent 
a) if is an isomorphism, 
b) S C X is a basis of X if and only if (p{S) is a basis ofY.

2.14 Definition. Let cp : X —^ Y be a linear map. The kernel of (p and 
the image of ip are respectively 
kercp := Ix e X\ (p{x) = oi, 
Im(p := <y e Y 13 X e X : (p{x) = y}. 
It is easily seen that ker cp is a. linear subspace of the source space X and 
that ker ip = {0} if and only if cp is injective. Also, Im(/? is a Unear subspace 
of the target space Y, and limp = Y ii and only if (p is surjective. If limp 
has finite dimension, its dimension is called the rank of (p and denoted by 
Rank(/?. Of course cp is surjective if and only if dimF = Rank(^, provided 
dim.liD.(p < +CX). 
d. Coordinates in a finite-dimensional vector space 
Let X be a finite-dimensional vector space over K and let (ei, 62,..., Cn) 
be an ordered basis on X. Then every vector x e X writes uniquely as 
X = Yl7=i ^*^^' where xi, X2,..., Xn G K. Then (ei, 62,..., Cn) defines a 
map £ : X -^W^ characterized by 
n 
£{x) = X = (x^, x^,..., x^) 
if and only if 
x = ^ 
xV^. 
2 = 1

It is trivial to verify that S is linear, injective and surjective, hence an 
isomorphism, together with its inverse 
n 
2 = 1 
We call £ the coordinate system related to the ordered basis (ei, e2,..., e^) 
and refer to £{x) as to the coordinate vector of x with respect to the basis 
(ei, 62,..., Cn). Notice that £ maps Ci to the zth vector e^ of the canonical 
basis of K^. 
Also notice that ordered bases and isomorphims £ : X —^ W^ are in 
one-to-one correspondence. In particular, any isomorphism £ : X -^ W^ 
is a coordinate system related to a suitable basis. In fact, the vectors 
ei, 62,..., Cn of X defined for i = 1,..., n by ei := £~^{ei) form a basis 
of X by Proposition 2.12 (iii) and it is easy to check that 
n 
£{x) = X = (a:^, x^,..., x'^) 
if and only if 
x = 2 J x'^^i-
i=l 
The use of a basis, or, equivalently, of a coordinate system, allows us 
to transfer definitions and results in K^ to similar definitions and claims 
in X. We have the following. 
2,15 Proposition. Let X be a finite-dimensional vector space. 
(i) Let (ei, 62,..., Cn) be an ordered basis of X and let vi, V2," - ^ Vp £ 
X, p < n, be p linearly independent vectors. Then we can choose 
n — p elements among ei, 62,..., e^, say ei, 62,..., en-p, such that 
(i'l, 1^2,. • • 5 Vp,ei, 62,..., en-p) is a basis of X. 
(ii) Assume that vi, i;2,..., Vk spans X. Possibly eliminating some of the 
vi^ V2,.. ", Vkf ^e get a basis of X. 
(iii) Any two bases of X have the same number of elements. 
The number of elements of a basis of a finite-dimensional space X is 
called the dimension of X and denoted by dimX. 
The following corollaries follow from Proposition 2.15. 

2.1 Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
47 
2.16 Corollary. Let X be a vector space of dimension n, let £ : X —^ W^ 
he a coordinate system on X and let W he a suhspace of X. Then E{W) 
is a suhspace ofK^ and dim VF = 
dim£{W). 
2.17 Corollary. Let X he a vector space of dimension n. Then 
(i) n linearly independent vectors of X form a hasis of X, 
(ii) if k> n, then k vectors of X are always linearly dependent, 
(iii) for every suhspace W of X we have dim W 
<n, 
(iv) let V, W he two suhspaces of X. Then V = W if and only 
ifVcW 
and dim V = dim W. 
Let U and V be two subspaces of a vector space X. Then both U OV 
and 
U + v := lxex\x 
= u + v, ueU, v ev\ 
are Unear subspaces of X, When U dV = {0}, we say that U + V is the 
direct sum of U and V and we write f/ 0 V instead oiU -\-V. Moreover if 
X = [/ 0 y, we say that U and V are supplementary. Thus X = U ^V 
means that every x e X decomposes uniquely as x = u-\-w, u e U, v 
eV. 
2.18 Corollary (Grassmann's formula). Let U and V he two finite-
dimensional suhspaces of a vector space X. Then 
dim U-\-dimV = dim{U H V) + dim{U -f V). 
2.19 f. Show that every n-dimensional vector space is the direct sum of n subspaces 
of dimension 1. 
2.20 f. Let ei, 62,..., en be distinct vectors of X and let 1 < p < n. Then, trivially, 
Span{ei, 62,..., ep} + Span{ep-|-i,... ,en} = Span{6i, 62,..., en}- Show that, if the 
6i's are linearly independent, then 
Span{ei, 62,..., 6p} e Span {ep+i,... ,en} = Span{ei, 62,..., en}-
2.21 %, Let Vi, V2 be two subspaces of a vector space V of finite dimension and assume 
that V = Vi © V2. Then every vector v G V decomposes uniquely as v = vi -\- V2 with 
Vi eV. 
Show that the coordinate maps ni : V —>- Vi, i = 1,2, ni{v) =Vi, are linear. 
2.22 f. Let (f : X —^Y he an isomorphism from X onto Y. Show that dimX = dimy. 
e. Matrices associated to a linear map 
Let X, y be two vector spaces of dimension n and m respectively. We 
shall now show that every choice of an oriented basis, equivalently of a 
coordinate system, in X and Y yields an identification between linear 
maps and matrices. 
Let (ei, 62,..., Cn) be an oriented basis in X, (/i, /2, • •., fm) be an 
oriented basis in Y and let £ : X -^K^, T :Y —^ W^ be the corresponding

(2.1) 
see Figure 2.4, that maps the coordinates of a vector x G X, relative to the 
basis (ei, e2,..., Cn), into the coordinates oii[x) G y , relative to the basis 
(/i^ /2,. • •, /m), and then, see Proposition 1.18, an m x n matrix L such 
that L(x) = Lx. We call L and L respectively, the vfia'p and the matrix 
associated to £ using the coordinate systems £ and T^ or, equivalently, using 
(ei, 62,..., en) and (/i, /2, •.., /m) ^^ ^ 6a5Z5 in X and in Y, respectively. 
Since 5~^ maps the iih vector Ci of the canonical basis of K^ to e^, 
L(e^) is the coordinate vector of £{ei) in the basis (/i, /2,.. •, /m), hence 
L = [L*] where 
e{ej) = J2^f-
(2.2) 
z=l 
Equivalently, see Proposition 1.18, 
Since £ : X 
have 
L(ei) L(e2) ... U/(en)j. 
U^ and ^ : y —> K^ are isomorphisms, we trivially 
£{keT £) = ker L, 
.:r(Im ^) = Im L. 
Hence, recalling Theorem 1.25, we have the following.

2.23 Theorem (Rank formula). Let £ : X ^^ Y be a linear map be-
tween linear spaces. If X is finite dimensional, then 
Rank£ = dimlm^ = dimX — dimkerf. 
Proof. Let (ei, 62,..., en) be a basis of X. Then Im^ = Span {^(ei),...,^(cn)}, hence 
dimlm^ < +oo. Now choose a basis (/i, /2, • • •, /m) of Im^ and consider the lin-
ear associated map L : K^ —> K"^ using the two bases (ei, 62,..., Cn) on X and 
(/i, / 2 , . . . , fm) on Im^. Then Theorem 1.25 yields 
dim Im i = dim Im L = n — dim ker L = n — dim ker £. 
f. The space C{X, 
Y) 
Let X and Y be vector spaces of dimension n and m, and let (ei, e2,.. •, Cn) 
and (/i, /2, • • •, /m) be two bases in X and Y. Then (2.2) defines a map 
M : iC(X, y) -^ M7n,n(K) which is trivially injective and surjective. Since 
M is also Unear, we deduce that £(X, Y) and Mm,n(K) are isomorphic. In 
particular, the vector space £(X, Y) has dimension mn. A basis of >C(X, y) 
is given by the mn maps {^j}, j = 1,..., n, z = 1,..., m, defined in terms 
of the bases as 
^ii{ek)=Sifj = 0 
if k ^ i, 
if k = i, 
A; = 1,.. .,n. 
The matrix associated to ip'j is the mx n matrix with all entries 0 except 
for the entry (i, j) where we have 1. Of course the matrix Ad{£) associated 
to £ depends on the coordinate systems we use on X and Y. When we 
want to emphasize such a dependence, we write 
to denote the matrix associated to £ : X -^ y using the coordinate systems 
£ on the source space and T in the target space. 
The product of composition of Unear maps corresponds to the product 
of composition of linear maps at the level of coordinates, hence to the 
product row by columns of the corresponding matrices. More precisely, we 
have the following. 

50 
2. Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
2.24 Proposition. Let (/? : X —> F and ip : Y -^ Z be two linear maps, 
and let £ : X -^W, 
T :Y -^ K^, and G : Z ^ K^ be three systems of 
coordinates on X,Y 
and Z. Then 
MJ{^ov) = M%{^P)Mf{<p) 
rows by columns. 
Proof. In fact, 
G o {ip o (f)S-'^ = {G o ij; o 7^-^)0 {To if oE-'^). 
A special case arises if X = F = Z. In this case, the space C{X^ X) 
of the hnear maps from X into itself, also known as the space of endo-
morphisms of X and sometimes denoted by End(X), is closed under the 
operations of sum, multiplication by scalars and product of composition. 
We say that C{X, X) is an algebra with respect to these operations and, 
for any coordinate system £ on X, M^ : C{X,X) 
-^ Mn,n{^) is an iso-
morphism of algebras. The set of isomorphisms from X into itself, called 
the automorphisms of X and denoted by Aut {X), is a group with respect 
to the composition. If dim X = n and £ : X -^K^ is a coordinate system, 
then A^f (Aut {X)) coincides with the group GL(n,K) of all nonsingular 
n X n matrices, 
GL(n,K) := | L G Mn,n(K) I detL ^^ o}. 
g. Linear abstract equations 
Let X, Y be two vector spaces over K. A linear (abstract) equation in the 
unknown x is an equation of the form 
^{x) = y, 
(2.3) 
where (p : X -^ Y is a> linear map and y £ Y. The equation (f{x)=0 
is 
called the associate homogeneous equation to (2.3). 
Of course, we have 
(i) the set of all solutions of the associate linear homogeneous equation 
ip{x) = 0 is ker ip, 
(ii) (2.3) is solvable iff t/ G limp, 
(iii) (2.3) has at most a unique solution if ker (^ = {0}, 
(iv) if (p{xo) = 2/, then the set of all solutions of (2.3) is 
Ix e X\x — xo e ker (p >. 
Taking into account the rank formula, we infer the following. 
2.25 Corollary. Let X, Y be finite dimensional of dimension n and m 
respectively, and let (p : X -^Y 
be a linear map. Then 

2.1 Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
51 
(i) if m <n, then dimker(^ > 0, 
(ii) if m>n, 
then (p is injective iff Rank ip = n, 
(iii) ifn = m, then ip is injective if and only if (p is surjective. 
The claim (iii) of Corollary 2.25 is one of the forms of Predholm 's alternative 
theorem: either (p{x) = y is solvable for every y ^ Y or (p{x) = 0 has a 
nonzero solution. 
2.26 Example. A second order linear equation 
ay"+by'-\-cy 
= f, 
a,b,ceR, 
/ 6 C^R), 
(2.4) 
can be seen as an abstract linear equation ip(y) = f by introducing the linear map 
if : C2(R) -^ C^R), 
y - . <p{y) := ay'' + by' + cy. 
(2.5) 
Since (2.4) has a solution for every / G C^(R), see [GMl], (p is onto, and the linearity 
yields the following 
(i) the set of all solutions of the associated homogeneous equation ay"-\-by'-\-cy 
= 0 
is a linear space, actually ker <^, 
(ii) if yf is any solution of (2.4), then all solutions of (2.4) are obtained by adding to 
yf a solution of the homogeneous equation a y " -|- fey' + cy = 0, i.e., of (p{y) = 0. 
In abstract terms, the set of all solutions of (^(y) = / is given by 
| y 6 C 2 ( R ) | y - y / 6 kerc^}. 
Moreover, consider the map 7 : R^ —• C^(R) that maps each (a, /5) G R^ to the unique 
solution of the initial value problem 
a y " + 6 y ' + c y = 0, 
y ( 0 ) = : a , y ' ( 0 ) = / 3 . 
It is easy to show that 7 : R^ —• C^(R) is linear, and by definition, I m 7 = ker(/?, 
where ip is the map in (2.5). Since 7 is trivially injective, the rank formula yields 
dim Im 7 = 2 — 0 = 2, concluding that the space of solutions of a homogeneous second 
order ODE is a vector space of dimension 2. 
h. Changing coordinates 
The coordinates of a vector depend on the chosen coordinate system. Let 
us discuss how they change. 
Let X be a vector space of dimension n, and let £^ : X —> K*^ and 
T : X -^ K^ he two coordinate systems on X, that we label respec-
tively as the old system and the new system. Denote by (ei, e2, •. •, Cn) 
and (/i, / 2 , . . . , fn) the bases associated respectively to the old coordi-
nate system £ and to the new coordinate system T. The linear map 
L \= !F o £~^ : W*' -^ W^ maps the old f-coordinate vector of x G X 
to the new ^-coordinate vector of x, see Figure 2.5. The matrix L associ-
ated to L in the basis (ei, 62,..., en) is 
L := M^{ld) 
= [jr(ei) I T{e2) I ... I Hen) 

52 
2. Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
Figure 2.5. Changing the basis. 
We say that L or L changes coordinates from S to T. Remember that the 
zth column of L is the new ^-coordinate vector of the zth vector of the 
old basis, i.e, see (2.2), L = [Lj] where 
-E^;/'-
(2.6) 
i=l 
Let m : X -^ X he the hnear map defined by m{ei) := /^ Vi = 1,..., m. 
Then the associated matrix M = [M-] to m using the basis £ is 
M : = 
5 ( / i ) ^ ( / 2 ) 
£{fn)] 
or, 
Therefore, comparing with (2.6), M = L~^. 
In conclusion 
(i) L maps the old coordinates to the new coordinates, 
(ii) L~-^ maps the old basis to the new basis. 
Thus L acts differently on the basis and on the coordinates. We say that 
the coordinates change in a contravariant way. This is nothing mysterious; 
for instance, 7000 p = 7 Kg: if the unit measure ei is, say 1000 times the 
unit measure ei, then we expect that the number of units ei associated to 
a measure will be 1/1000 of the number of units ei. 
2.27 Example. Suppose we want to change from the canonical basis (ei, 62) to a new 
one given by the vectors (1, 2) and (3,4) in R^. The matrix that changes the basis from 
ei = (1,0), 62 = (0,1) into / i = (ei +2e2), /2 = (3ei -h4e2) is 
M = 
The old coordinates of a vector P can easily be obtained from the new ones, as 
P = X ei -\- y €2 = a fi -{- P f2, 

2.1 Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
53 
thus, in the old coordinates, 
and, conversely, we have 
i. The associated matrix under changes of basis 
Let X and Y be two vector spaces of dimension n and m. As before, the 
matrix associated to a linear map depends on the chosen coordinates on 
X and Y. Let f : X —^ K"^, £' : X -^ W^ be two coordinate systems on 
X, and let ^ : X ^> K^, ^ ' : X -^ K"^ be two coordinate systems on Y. 
Of course, for every map i we have (. = Idy o ^ o Idx, consequently 
Mfiii) = M^'{ld)Mf{i)MUld), 
or, in other words, we can state the following. 
2.28 Proposition. Given the previous notation, let R G Mn,n{^) be the 
matrix that changes coordinates from £ to £', let S G Mm,m{^) 
^^ the 
matrix that changes coordinates from J^ to T', let A A' be the matrices 
that represent £ respectively, in the systems of coordinates £ and T and in 
the systems £' and T'. 
Then 
A' = S A R - ^ 
2.29 Corollary. Let A G Mn^n^^ 
cind let AiW^ 
^K^ 
be the associated 
linear operator A{x) := Ax. Let (fi, f2,..., fn) be a basis ofK^. 
Then the 
matrix associated to A using the basis (fi, f2,. •., fn)? both in the source 
and the target W^, is the matrix 
A' := S-^AS 
where 
=[' fl f2 
f„ 
Proof. Let (ei, e 2 , . . . , en) be the canonical basis of K^, then Sci = fi are the coordi-
nates of fi in the basis (ei, e 2 , . . . , en), ASei = Afj is the coordinate vector of A(fi) 
in canonical coordinates and, finally, S~^ ASei is the coordinate vector of A(fi) in the 
(fl, f2,..., fn) basis.

2. Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
j . The dual space £ ( X , K) 
Linear maps from X into K play a special role. 
Let X be a vector space over K with dimX = n. Linear maps from 
X into K are also called linear forms or covectors, and the space of linear 
forms, C{X, K), also denoted by X*, is called the dual space of X. Suppose 
X is finite dimensional. Then, as we have seen, X* has dimension n and, 
if (ei, 62,..., en) is a basis of X, then every linear form ^ : X —> K is 
represented as a 1 x n matrix L that maps the coordinates x of x G X to 
i{x), i.e.. 
Lx = e{x) 
if 
X = ^ x V i , X = (x\ x^,..., x'^) 
or, L = [/i I /2 I ... I In] and 
n 
e{x) = ^ iix\ 
vx = {x\ x^..., x""). 
2 = 1 
Consider now the linear maps e^, e^,..., e'^ : X ^ K defined by 
e'{ei) = Sij 
Vz,j = l,...,n. 
(2.7) 
2.30 Proposition. We have 
(i) for i = 1,.. .,n, the map eV X —> K maps x e X to the ith coordinate 
of X, so that 
n 
X = 2_\e^{x)ei 
Vx G X,

(iii) ifx = ^^^1 x'ci eX

then(>{x) = YTi^i

Proof, (i) If x = J^^^i x^ei, then e^{x) = Y:7=i x'e^{ei) 
= x^. 
(ii) Let ^ := Yl]=iH^^' 
Then ^(e^) = /i^ Vi. Thus, if ^(x) = 0 Vx we trivially have 
/ii = 0 Vi.

The system of linear maps (e^, e^,..., e'^) characterized by (2.7) is 
called the dual basis of (ei, e2,..., en) in X*.

2.31 Remark. Coordinates of vectors or covectors of a vector space X of 
dimension n are both n-tuples. However, to distinguish them, it is useful 
to index the coordinates of covectors with lower indices. We can reinforce 
this notation even more by writing the coordinates of vectors as column 
vectors and coordinates of covectors as row vectors. 
k. The bidual space 
Of course, we may consider also the space of linear forms on X*, denoted 
by X** and called the hidual of X. Every v e X identifies a Hnear form 
on >C(X*,K), by defining t;** : X* -^ K by ^;**(^) := e{v). The map 
7 : X —> X**, X —> 7(x) := x** we have just defined is linear and injective. 
Since dimX** = dimX* = dimX, 7 is surjective, hence an isomorphism, 
and we call it natural since it does not depend on other structures on X, 
as does the choice of a basis. 
Since X** and X are naturally isomorphic, there is a "symmetry" be-
tween the two spaces X and X*. To emphasize this symmetry, it is usual 
to write 
< (p^x > 
instead of 
ip{x) 
if (^ G X* and a; G X, introducing the evaluation map 
< , >:X* x X 
< (p,x >:= (f{x). 
2.32 ^. Let X be a vector space and let X* be its dual. A duality between X and X* 
is a map < , > : X* x X ^ K that is 

56

(i) linear in each factor,

(ii) nondegenerate 
i.e., 
if < If ,x > = 0 Wx, then (f = 0, 
if < V? , x > = 0 V<p, then x = 0. 
Show that the evaluation map {(p^x) -^ < (p ,x > that evaluates a linear map (p : X 
^^K 
at x G X is a duality. 
1. Adjoint or dual maps 
Let X, Y be vector spaces, X* and F* their duals and < , >x and 
< , >Y the evaluation maps on X* x X and Y* x Y. For every linear map 
£ : X ^^ y, one also has a map ^* : F* -^ X* defined by 
< r(2/*),x >:=< y\e{x) 
> 
Vx G X,V2/* G F*. 
It turns out that £* is linear. Now if (ei, e2,. •., Cn) and (/i,..., fm) are 
bases in X and Y respectively, and (e^, e^,..., e^) and (/^, /^,..., / ^ ) 
are the dual bases in X* and F*, then the associated matrices L = [L^] G 
Mm,n(If^) and M = [Mj] G Mn,m(IK), associated respectively to £ and ^*, 
are defined by 
m 
n 
h=l 
2=1 
By duality, 
i.e., M = L-^. Therefore we conclude that i/L is the matrix associated to 
£ in a given basis, then L^ is the matrix associated to £* in the dual basis. 
We can now discuss how coordinate changes in X reflect on the dual 
space. 
Let X be a vector space of dimension n, X* its dual space, (ei,..., e^), 
(ei, 62,..., Cn) two bases on X and (e\ e^,..., e^) and (e^ e^,..., e") the 
corresponding dual bases on X*. 
Let ^ : X -^ X be the linear map defined by £{ei) := e^ Vi = 1,..., n. 
Then by duality 
<£*{e'),ej > = <e\£{ej) 
> = < e\ej > = Sij =< e\ej > 
Vz,j, 
^*(e*) = e* Vz = 1,..., n. If L and L^ are the associated matrices to £ and 
^*, L changes basis from (ei, e2,..., e-n) to (ei, 62,..., en) in X, and L^ 
changes basis in the dual space from (e^, e^,..., e") to (e^, e^,..., e").

Thus, if a := (ai, a2,..., a^), b := (61, 62, • • •, bn)^ we have 
a^ = L^b^ 
or 
a = bL. 
In other words, the coordinates in X* change according to the change of 
basis. We say that the change of coordinates in X* is covariant 
2.2 Eigenvectors and Similar Matrices 
Let A : X —^ X he a. hnear operator on a vector space. How can we describe 
the properties of A that are invariant by isomorphisms? Since isomorphims 
amount to changing basis, we can put it in another way. Suppose X is finite 
dimensional, dim X = n, then we may consider the matrix A associated to 
A using a basis (we use the same basis both in the source and the target 
X). But how can we catch the properties of A that are independent of 
the basis? One possibihty is to try to choose an "optimal" basis in which, 
say, the matrix A takes the simplest form. As we have seen, if we choose 
two coordinate systems £ and ^ on X, and S is the matrix that changes 
coordinates from £ to ^ , then the matrices A and B that represent A 
respectively in the basis £ and J^ are related by 
B = S A S - ^ 
Therefore we are asking for a nonsingular matrix S such that S~^AS has 
the simplest possible form: this is the problem of reducing a matrix to a 
canonical form. 
Let us try to make the meaning of "simplest" for a matrix more precise. 
Suppose that in X there are two supplementary invariant subspaces 
under A 
X = Wi® W2, 
A{Wi) C Wi, A{W2) C W2. 
Then every x e X splits uniquely as x = xi + X2 with xi G VFi, X2 G W25 
and A{x) = A{xi) + A{x2) with A(xi) G Wi and A{x2) G VF2. In 
other words, A splits into two operators Ai : Wi ^^ Wi^ A \ W2 -^ 
W2 that are the restrictions of A to Wi and W2- Now suppose that 
dimX = n and let (ei, 62,..., Ck) and (/i, /2, •. •, fn-k) be two bases 
respectively of Wi and W2. Then the matrix associated to A in the basis 
(ei, 62,..., efc, / i , /2,.. •, fn-k) of X has the form 

58 
2. Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
Ai 
A = 
0 
where some of the entries are zero. 
If we pursue this approach, the optimum would be the decomposition 
of X into n supplementary invariant subspaces Wi, W2,.. •, Wn under A 
of dimension 1, 
X = T^i e H^2 e • • • e T^n, 
A(Wi) c Wi. 
In this case, A acts on each Wi as a dilation: A{x) = Xix Vx G Wi for some 
A^ G K. Morever, if (ei, 62,..., Cn) is a basis of X such that ei G W^ for 
each 2, then the matrix associated to A in this basis is the diagonal matrix 
A = diag(Ai,A2,...,An). 
2.2-1 Eigenvectors 
a. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues 
As usual, K denotes the field R or C. 
2.33 Definition. Let A : X -^ X be a linear operator on a vector space 
X over K. We say that x E X is an eigenvector of A if Ax = Xx for some 
X E K. If X is a nonzero eigenvector, the number X for which A{x) = Xx is 
called an eigenvalue of A, or more precisely, the eigenvalue of A relative 
to X. The set of eigenvalues of A is called the spectrum of A. 
/ / A G Mn,nO^), we refer to eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the asso-
ciated linear operator A : W^ —> W^, A(x) := Ax, as the eigenvalues and 
the eigenvectors of A. 
Prom the definition, A is an eigenvalue of A if and only if ker(A Id — 
A) 7^ {0}, equivalently, if and only if Aid — >1 is not invertible. If A is an 
eigenvalue, the subspace of all eigenvectors with eigenvalue A 
FA := {^ e X I A{x) = Xx\ = ker(AId - A) 
is called the eigenspace of A relative to A. 
2.34 Example, let X = C°° ([0, n]) be the linear space of smooth functions that vanish 
at 0 and n and let £>^ : X —> X he the linear operator D'^{f) := j " that maps every 
function / into its second derivative. Nonzero eigenvectors of the operator D^ ^ that 
is, the nonidentically zero functions y € C°*^[0,1] such that D'^y{x) = \y{x) 
for some 
A G M, are called eigenfunctions. 
2.35 Example. Let X be the set Pn of polynomials of degree less than n. Then, each 
Pfc d Pn A; = 0 , . . . , n is an invariant subspace for the operator of differentiation. It has 
zero as a unique eigenvalue.

2.36 %, Show that the rotation in E^ by an angle 6 has no nonzero eigenvectors if 
9 ^ 0,n, since in this case there are no invariant lines. 
2.37 Definition. Let A : X ^^ X be a linear operator on X. A subspace 
W C X is invariant (under A) if A{W) C W. 
In the following proposition we collect some simple properties of eigen-
vectors. 
2.38 Proposition. Let A : X -^ X be a linear operator on X. 
(i) X 7^ 0 is an eigenvector if and only if Span {x} is an invariant sub-
space under A. 
(ii) Let A be an eigenvector of A and let Vx be the corresponding eigen-
space. Then every subspace W C Vx is an invariant subspace under 
A, i.e., A{W) C W. 
(iii) dimker(AId — A) > 0 if and only if A is an eigenvalue for A. 
(iv) Let W C X be an invariant subspace under A and let A be an eigen-
value for A^^r. Then A is an eigenvalue for A : X ^ X. 
(v) A is an eigenvalue for A if and only ifO is an eigenvalue for Aid —^. 
(vi) Let if : X —^ Y be an isomorphism and let A : X -^ X be an 
operator. Then x E X is an eigenvector for A if and only if (p{x) 
is an eigenvector for (p o A o (p~^, and x and ip{x) have the same 
eigenvalue. 
(vii) Nonzero eigenvectors with different eigenvalues are linearly indepen-
dent. 
Proof, (i), ..., (vi) are trivial. To prove (vii) we proceed by induction on the number 
k of eigenvectors. For A; = 1 the claim is trivial. Now assume by induction that the 
claim holds for fc — 1 nonzero eigenvectors, and let ei, 62, • • •, e^ be such that ej / 0 
Vi = 1,..., fc, A{ej) = XjCj Vj = 1,..., fc with Xj ^ Ai Vi 7^ j . Let 
aiei-fa2e2H 
\-akCk = 0, 
(2.8) 
be a linear combination of ei, 62,..., e^. From (2.8), multiplying by Ai and applying 
A we get 
aiXiei 
+ a2Aie2 H 
h afcAie^ = 0, 
aiAiei -h a2A2e2 H 
h OfcAfcefc = 0, 
consequently 
k 
^{Xj 
-Xi)ajej 
= 0 . 
j=2 
By the inductive assumption, aj{Xj — Ai) = 0 Vj = 2 , . . . , n, hence aj = 0 for all j > 2. 
We then conclude from (2.8) that we also have ai = 0, i.e., that ei, 62,.-., Cfc are 
linearly independent. 
D 
Let A : X ^^ X he a. linear operator on X of dimension n, and let A 
be the associated matrix in a coordinate system f : X —> W^. Then (vi) 
implies that x G X is an eigenvector of A if and only if x := £{x) is an 
eigenvector for x —> Ax and x and x have the same eigenvalue. 
Prom (vii) Proposition 2.38 we infer the following. 

60 
2. Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
2.39 Corollary. Let A : X -^ X be a linear operator on a vector space 
X of dimension n. If A has n different eigenvalues, then X has a basis 
formed by eigenvectors of A. 
b. Similar matrices 
Let A : X ^^ Xhea, linear operator on a vector space X of dimension n. As 
we have seen, if we fix a basis, we can represent A by an n x n matrix. If A 
and A' G Mn^ni^) ^^^ ^wo such matrices that represent A in two different 
bases (ei, e2,..., e^) and (ei, 62,..., en), then by Proposition 2.28 A' = 
S~^AS where S is the matrix that changes basis from (ei, ^2,..., e^) to 
( e i , € 2 , . . . , 
€n)-
2.40 Definition. Two matrices A,B G Mn n(K) are said to be similar if 
there exists S G GL(n,K) such that B = S~ AS. 
It turns out that the similarity relation is an equivalence relation on 
matrices, thus nxn matrices are partitioned into classes of similar matrices. 
Since matrices associated to a linear operator A : X ^^ X^ dimX = n, are 
similar, we can associate to A a unique class of similar matrices. It follows 
that if a property is preserved by similarity equivalence, then it can be 
taken as a property of the linear operator to which the class is referred. 
For instance, let A : X -^ X he a. hnear operator, and let A, B be such 
that B = S~^AS. By Binet's formula, we have 
det B = det S"^ det A det S = —— det A det S = det A. 
detS 
Thus we may define the determinant of the linear map A : X —^ X hy 
det A := det A 
where A is any matrix associated to A. 
c. The characteristic polynomial 
Let X be a vector space of dimension n, and let A : X ^^ X he a, hnear 
operator. The function 
^-^PAW 
'•= det(AId -A), 
AG K, 
is called the characteristic polynomial of A. It can be computed by repre-
senting A by a matrix A in a coordinate system and computing PAW as 
the characteristic polynomial of any of the matrices A representing A, 
PA{X)=PA{X) = 
detiXld-A). 
In particular, it follows that p^( ) : K —> IK is a polynomial in A of degree 
n, and that the roots of p^(A) are the eigenvalues of A or of A. 
Moreover, we can state 

2.2 Eigenvectors and Similar Matrices 
61 
2.41 Proposition. We have the following. 
(i) Two similar matrices A, B have the same eigenvalues and the same 
characteristic polynomials. 
(ii) // A has the form

(iii) We have 
where for z = 1,..., fc, each block A^ is a square matrix of dimension 
ki with principal diagonal on the principal diagonal of A, then 
PA{S) = PAA^) ' PA2{s). • .PAfc(s). 
det(5ld - A) = 5^ - tr A5^-i + • • • + (-l)^det A 
n 
k=l 
where trA := X]^=i A^ is the trace of the matrix A, and ak is the 
sum of the determinants of the kx k submatrices of A with principal 
diagonal on the principal diagonal of A. 
Proof, (i) If B = S A S - i , S G GL(n,K), 
then sId - B = S(sld - A ) S - i , hence 
det(s Id - B) = det S det(s Id - A)(det S)-^ = det(s Id - A), 
(ii) The matrix 5 Id — A is a block matrix of the same form 
s I d - A 2

hence det(s Id - A) = Y[i=i det{s Id - A^). 
(iii) We leave it to the reader.

Notice that there exist matrices with the same eigenvalues that are not 
similar, see Exercise 2.73.

2. Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
d. Algebraic and geometric multiplicity 
2.42 Definition. Let A : X -^ X be a linear operator, and let X GK be 
an eigenvalue of A. We say that A has geometric multiplicity k e N if 
dimker(AId - A) = k. 
Let PA{S) be the characteristic polynomial of A. We say that A has 
algebraic multiplicity k if 
PA{S) = {S- X)^q{s), 
where q{X) ^ 0. 
2.43 Proposition. Let A : X -^ X be a linear operator on a vector space 
of dimension n and let A be an eigenvalue of A of algebraic multiplicity m. 
Then dimker(AId - A) 
<m. 
Proof. Let us choose a basis (ei, 62,.. •, Cn) in X such that (ei, e2, • •., e^) is a basis 
for Vx '•= ker(AId — A). The matrix A associated to A in this basis has the form 
A = 
(\ 
Aid 
0 
vl 
|\ 
C 
D 
1/ 
where the first block, Aid, is a fc x /c matrix of dimension k = dimV^. Thus Proposi-
tion 2.41 (ii) yields PA{S) = det(s Id — A) = (s — \)^pr>(s), 
and the multiplicity of A is 
at least k. 
D 
e. Diagonizable matrices 
2.44 Definition. We say that A G Mn,n{^) is diagonizable, if A is sim-
ilar to a diagonal matrix. 
2.45 Theorem. Let A : X -^ X be a linear operator on a vector space of 
dimension n, and let (ei, 62,..., Cn) be a basis of X. The following claims 
are equivalent. 
(i) ei, 62,..., Cn are eigenvectors of A and Ai, A2,..., An are the rela-
tive eigenvalues. 
(ii) We have A{x) = Yl^=i K^^^i /^^ all x e X if x = Yl7=i ^^^i-
(iii) The matrix that represents A in the basis (ei, ^2,..., e^) is 
diag(Ai, A2,..., An). 
(iv) If A is the matrix associated to A in the basis (/i, / 2 , . . . , fn), then 
S-^AS = dia^(Ai, A2,..., An) 
where S is the matrix that changes basis from (/i, /25 • • • ? /n) io 
(ei, 62,..., Cn), i-e., the ith column of S is the coordinate vector of 
the eigenvector ei in the basis (/i, 72,..., /n)-

Proof, (i) ^ (ii) by linearity and (iii) <=> (i) since (iii) is equivalent to A{ei) = Xiei. 
Finally (iii) ^ (iv) by Corollary 2.29. 
D 
2.46 Corollary. Let A : X ^^ X be a linear operator on a vector space of 
dimension n. Then the following claims are equivalent. 
(i) X splits as the direct sum of n one-dimensional invariant subspaces 
(under A), X = Wie • • - ^ Wn. 
(ii) X has a basis made of eigenvectors of A. 
(iii) Let Ai, A2,..., A^ be all distinct eigenvalues of A, and let Vx^, • • •, Vx,^ 
be the corresponding eigenspaces. Then 
y ^ dim Vxi = n. 
(iv) // A is the matrix associated to A in a basis, then A is diagonizable. 
Proof, (i) implies (ii) since any nonzero vector in any of the Wis is an eigenvector. 
Denoting by (ei, e2,. • •, en) a basis of eigenvectors, the spaces Wi := Spanje^} are 
supplementary spaces of dimension one, hence (ii) implies (i). (iii) is a rewriting of 
(i) since for each eigenvalue A, Vx is the direct sum of the Wi^s that have A as the 
corresponding eigenvalue. Finally (ii) and (iii) are equivalent by Theorem 2.45. 
D 
2.47 Linear equations. The existence of a basis of X of eigenvectors 
of an operator A : X —^ X makes solving the Unear equation A{x) — y 
trivial. 
Let (ei, e2,..., Cn) be a basis of X of eigenvectors of A and let 
Ai, A2,..., An be the corresponding eigenvalues. Writing x^y e X in this 
basis,

x = Y^x'ei,

A is invertible if and only if 0 is not an eigenvalue for A. In this case show that 1/A is

f. Triangularizable matrices 
First, we notice that the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are the entries 
of the principal diagonal. We can then state the following. 
2.49 Theorem. Let A G Mn,n(IK). // the characteristic polynomial de-
composes as a product of factors of first degree, i.e., if there are (not nec-
essarily distinct) numbers Ai, A2,..., An G K such that 
det(AId - A) = (A - Ai)... (A - An), 
then A is similar to an upper triangular matrix. 
Proof. Let us prove the following equivalent claim. Let A : X -^ X he a linear operator 
on a vector space of dimension n. If PAW 
factorizes as a product of factors of first 
degree, then there exists a basis (iti, it2, • • •, Un) of X such that 
Span{wi}, Span {it 1,1*2}, Span {141,1*2,^x3}, ... ,Span {1*1,1*2, • • itn} 
are invariant subspaces under A. In this case we have for the linear operator >l(x) = A x 
associated to A 
A u i = A(ui)

2.2 Eigenvectors and Similar Matrices

We proceed by induction on the dimension of X. If dimX = 1, the claim is trivial. 
Now suppose that the claim holds for any linear operator on a vector space of dimension 
n — 1, and let us prove the claim for A. Prom 
PA (A) = det(AId - A) = (A - A i ) . . . (A - An), 
Ai is an eigenvalue of A, hence there is a corresponding nonzero eigenvalue ui and 
Span {ui} is an invariant subspace under A. Now we complete {ui} as a basis by adding 
vectors f2, • • • i^n, and let B be the restriction of the operator A to Span {v2,.. 
.Vn}-
Let B be the matrix associated to B in the basis {v2,. • • ,Vn), and let A be the matrix 
associated to A in the basis (iti, W2, • • •, Wn)- Then 
/«! 
A = 
\ 
where ai = Ai. 
Thus 
PA(X) 
= PA (A) = (A - A I ) P B ( A ) = (A - 
A I ) P B ( A ) . 
It follows that the characteristic polynomial of B is PB(A) = (A — A2)... (A — An). By 
the inductive hypothesis, there exists a basis (u2,... 
itn) of Span {v2,..., 
fn} such that 
Span{1x2}, Span{u2,W3}, ... ,Span{ii2,.. •,Wn} 
are invariant subspaces under B, hence 
Span{ui}, Span{iti,ii2}, Span{141,1x2,^3}, ... ,Span{iti,tX2,... Wn} 
are invariant subspaces under A. 
D 
2.2.2 Complex matrices 
When K = C, a significant simplification arises. Because of the funda-
mental theorem of algebra, the characteristic polynomial PA (A) of every 
linear operator A : X ^^ X over a complex vector space X of dimension 
n, factorizes as product of n factors of first degree. In particular, A has n 
eigenvalues, if we count them with their multiplicities. Prom Theorem 2.49 
we conclude the following at once. 
2.50 Corollary. Let A e Mn,n(C) be a complex matrix. Then A is simi-
lar to an upper triangular matrix, that is, there exists a nonsingular matrix 
S G Mn,n(C) such that S~-^AS is upper triangular. 
Moreover, 
2.51 Corollary. Let A G Mn,n(C)6e a matrix. Then A is diagonizahle (as 
a complex matrix) if and only if the geometric and algebraic multiplicities 
of each eigenvalue agree. 

66 
2. Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
Proof. Let Ai, A2,..., Afc be the distinct eigenvalues of A, for each i = 1^.. .k,\et 
rrii 
and Vx^ respectively be the algebraic multiplicity and the eigenspace of A^. 
If dim V\^ = rrii Vi, then by the fundamental theorem of algebra 
k 
n 
^ d i m V ^ . =^mi

i=l 
i=l 
Hence A is diagonizable, by Corollary 2.46. 
Conversely, if A is diagonizable, then Yli=i dim Vx^ = n, hence by Proposition 2.43 
dimVxi ^ i^i^ hence 
k 
k 
n = ^rrii 
> ^ d i m V ^ i = n. 
D 
2.52 Remark (Real and complex eigenvalues). If A G Mn,n{^), its 
eigenvalues are by definition the real solutions of the polynomial equation 
det(AId — A) = 0. But A is also a matrix with complex entries, A G 
Mn,n{C) and it has as eigenvalues which are the complex solutions of 
det(AId — A) = 0. It is customary to call eigenvalues of A the complex 
solutions of det(AId — A) = 0 even if A has real entries, while the real 
solutions of the same equation, which are the eigenvalues of the real matrix 
A following Definition 2.33, are called real eigenvalues. 
The further developments we want to discuss depend on some relation-
ships among polynomials and matrices that we now want to illustrate. 
a. The Cayley-Hamilton theorem 
Given a polynomial f{t) = ^^=1 CLk^^•> to every n x n matrix A we can 
associate a new matrix /(A) defined by 
n 
n 
k 
/(A) := ao Id + ^ akA^ =: ^ a^A 
k=l 
k=0 
if we set A^ := Id. It is easily seen that, if a polynomial f{t) factors as 
f{t) = p{t)q{t), then the matrices p{A) and q{A) commute, and we have 
fiA)=p{A)q{A)=q{A)p{A). 
2.53 Proposition. Let A E Mn{C), and let p{t) be a polynomial. Then 
(i) if X is an eigenvalue of Ay then p{\) is an eigenvalue 
ofp{A), 
(ii) if fi is an eigenvalue of p{A), then fi = p{X) for some eigenvalue A 
of A. 
Proof, (i) follows observing that A'^ , /c G N, is an eigenvalue of A'^ if A is an eigenvalue 
of A. 
(ii) Since ^ is an eigenvalue of p(A), the matrix p{A) — /xld is singular. Let p{t) = 
J2i=i ^i** be of degree fc, a/e 7^ 0. By the fundamental theorem of algebra we have 

2.2 Eigenvectors and Similar Matrices 
67 
p{t) ~ iJ, = ak n(*~'^^)' 
i=l 
hence p(A) — /ild = a^ Hi^iCA — r^ Id) and, since p(A) — /xld is singular, at least 
one of its fa<:tors, say A — ri Id, is singular. Consequently, ri is an eigenvalue of A and 
trivially, p{ri) — /x = 0. 
D 
Now consider two polynomials P{t) := J^- PjP and Q(t) := ^ ^ Qkt^ 
with n X n matrices as coefficients. Trivially, the product polynomial 
R(t) := P{t)Q{t) is given by 
2.54 Lemma. Using the previous notation, if A G Mn,n{C) 
commutes 
with the coefficients ofQ{t), 
then R(A) = P(A)Q(A). 
Proof. In fax;t, 
R(A) = ^P,QfcA>+'= = 5^(P,A^)(QfeA'=) 
= ( ^ P , A ^ ) ( ^ Q , A ^ ) =P(A)Q(A). 
2.55 Theorem (Cayley-Hamiilton). Let A G Mn,n{C) 0,'^d let PA{S) 
be its characteristic polynomial, PA{S) '= det(sld —A). Then PA{A) = 0. 
Proof. Set Q(5) := sId — A, s G C, and denote by cof Q(s) the matrix of cofactors of 
Q(s). By Laplace's formulas, see (1.22), 
cof Q(s) Q(s) = Q(s) cof Q(s) = det Q(s) Id = PA{S) Id. 
Since A trivially commutes with the coefficents Id and A of Q(s), Lemma 2.54 yields 
PA (A) = PA (A) Id = cof Q(A) Q(A) = cof Q(A) -0 = 0. 
D 
b. Factorization and invariant subspaces 
Given two polynomials Pi,P2 with degPi > degP2, we may divide Pi 
by P2, i.e., uniquely decompose Pi as Pi = QP2 + R where degP < 
degP2. This allows us to define the greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of 
two polynomials that is defined up to a scalar factor, and compute it 
by Euclid's algorithm. Moreover, since complex polynomials factor with 
irreducible factors of degree 1, the g.c.d. of two complex polynomials is a 
constant polynomial if and only if the two polynomials have no common 
root. We also have 
2.56 Lemma. Let p{t) and q{t) be two polynomials with no common 
zeros. Then there exist polynomials a{t) and b{t) such that a{t)p{t) + 
b{t)q{t) = 1 V t e C . 

68 
2. Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
We refer the readers to [GM2], but for their convenience we add the 
proof of Lemma 2.56 
Proof. Let 
V := (r{t) := a{t)p{t) -h b{t)q(t) I a{t), b{t) are polynomials} 
and let d = ap-\-/3q he the nonzero polynomial of minimum degree in V. We claim that 
d divides both p and q. Otherwise, dividing p by d we would get a nonzero polynomial 
r := p — md and, since p and d are in V, r = p — md G V also, hence a contradiction, 
since r has degree strictly less than d. 
Then we claim that the degree of d is zero. Otherwise, d would have a root that 
should be common to p and q since d divides both p and q. In conclusion, d is a nonzero 
constant polynomial. 
• 
2.57 Proposition. For every polynomial p, the kernel of p{A) is an in-
variant subspace for A G Mn,n{C)-
Proof. Let w G kerp(A). 
Since tp{t) = p{t) t, we infer Ap{A) = p{A)A. 
Therefore 
p(A)(Aw) = (p(A) A)w = (Ap(A))w = Ap(A)w := AO = 0. 
Hence Aw G kerp(A). 
• 
2.58 Proposition. Let p be the product of two coprime polynomials, 
p{t) =Pi{t)p2{t), 
and let A G Mn,n(C). Then 
kerp(A) := kerpi(A) 0ker;?2(A). 
Proof 
By Lemma 2.56, there exist two polynomials ai,a2 such that ai{t)pi(t) 
+ 
a2(t)p2(t) = 1. Hence 
ai (A)pi (A) + a2 (A)p2 (A) = Id. 
(2.9) 
Set 
Wi := kerpi(A), 
W2 := kerp2(A), 
W := kerp(A). 
Now for every x G W, we have ai {A)pi (A)x G W2 since 
P2(A)ai(A)pi(A)x = P2(A)(Id - a2(A)p2(A))x = (Id - a2(A)p2(A))p2(A)x 
= ai(A)pi(A)p2(A)x = ai(A)p(A)x - 0. 
and, similarly, a2(A)p2(A)x G Wi. Thus W = Wi + W2. Finally W = WieW2- 
In 
fact, if y G Wi n W2, then by (2.9), we have 
y = ai (A)pi (A)y -h 02 (A)p2 (A)y = 0 + 0 = 0. 
c. Generalized eigenvectors and the spectral theorem 
2.59 Definition. Let A G Mn,n(C), and let A be an eigenvalue of A 
of multiplicity k. We call generalized eigenvectors of A relative to the 
eigenvalue A the elements of 
W:=ker{Xld-A)^. 
Of course, 
(i) eigenvectors relative to A are generalized eigenvectors relative to A, 
(ii) the spaces of generalized eigenvectors are invariant subspaces for A. 

2.2 Eigenvectors and Similar Matrices

2.60 Theorem. Let A G Mn,n(C). Let Ai, A2,..., A^ be the eigenvalues 
of A with multiplicities mi, 7712,..., ruk and let VFi, VF2,..., W^ 6e the 
subspaces of the relative generalized eigenvectors, Wi := ker(AiId — A). 
Then 
(i) the spaces VFi, VF2,..., Wk are supplementary, consequently there is 
a basis of C^ of generalized eigenvectors of A, 
(ii) dimWi = mi. 
Consequently, if we choose A' G Mn,n(^) 
using a basis (ei, 62,..., e^) 
where the the first rui elements span Wi, the following m2 elements span 
W2 and the last m^ elements span Wk- We can then write the matrix A' 
in the new basis similar to A where A' has the form 
A' = 
A i 
0 
A2 
0 
0 
0 \ 
0 
where for every i = 1,... ,k, the block Ai is ami x ^ i matrix with Xi as the 
only eigenvector with multiplicity mi and, of course, (A^ Id — A^)"^^ = 0. 
Proof, (i) Clearly the polynomials pi{s) := (Ai - s)"^i, ^2(5) := (A2 - s)"^^, 
. . . , 
Pk{s) := (Afe — s)'^f^ factorize pA and are coprime. Set N^ := pi(A) and notice that 
Wi = kerNi. Repeatedly applying Proposition 2.58, we then get 
kerpA(A) = ker(NiN2 ... N^) = ker(Ni) © ker(N2N3 • • • N^) 
= --- = 
WieW2e"-®Wk. 
(i) then follows from the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, kerpA(A) = C^. 
(ii) It remains to show that dim Wi = rrii VI Let (ei, 62, • • •, e-n) be a basis such that 
the first hi elements span VTi, the following /12 elements span W2 and the last h^ 
elements span W^. A is therefore similar to a block matrix 
A' = 
A i 
0 
0 
0 
A 2 
0 
0 
\ 
0 
Afc h 
where the block A^ is a square matrix of dimension hi := dim W^. On the other hand, 
the Qi X Qi matrix (A^ Id — Aj)"^^ = 0 hence all the eigenvalues of Xi Id — Ai are zero. 
Therefore Ai has a unique eigenvalue Ai with multiplicity /li, and p^i (s) := (s — Xi)^^. 
We then have 
k 
k 
PA{S) = PA'is) = UPAM 
= Yl(s ~ A)^S 
i = l 
i=l 
and the uniqueness of the factorization yields hi = rrii. The rest of the claim is trivial.

2. Vector Spaces and Linear Maps 
Another proof of dim Wi = ruj goes as follows. First we show the following. 
2.61 Lemma. IfO is an eigenvalue ofB^ 
Mn,n(C) with multiplicity 
m, the 0 is an 
eigenvalue for B"^ with multiplicity 
m. 
Proof. The function 1 - A'^, A € C, can be factorized as 1 - A"^ = Ililo^(^' ~ ^) where 
(jj := e*27r/m jg ^ j.QQ^ Q£ unity (the two polynomials have the same degree and take the 
same values at the m roots of the unity and at 0). For z,t E C 
m—l 
. 
m —1 
---*'"=.™(i - (1)-)=.- n (-^ - ^) = n (-*- - *). 
i=0 
i=0 
hence 
m — l 
2 ^ I d - B ^ = 2 ^ I d - B ^ - J|(u;^2ld-B). 
i=0 
If we set qo(z) := Hli^^ Q{^-^z)^ we have qo{0) ^ 0, and 
m—l 
m—l 
P B - (z"^) ••= detiz"^ Id - B"^) = Yl 
PB(UJ'Z) = JJ (uj^z^q{uj^z) 
= 
z'^\o{z). 
i=0 
i=0 
(2.10) 
On the other hand p-B^ — s'^qi(r) for some qi with qi{0) ^ 0 and some r > 1. Thus, 
following (2.10) 
PBm(s) = 
s'^qi(s), 
i.e., 0 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity m for B*^. 
• 
i4noi/ier proof that dim Wj = m,i in Theorem, 2.60. Since 
y] m,i = y^ dim Wi = dim X, 
it suffices to show that dim Wi < rui Vi. 
Since 0 is an eigenvalue of B := Aj Id —A of multiplicity m := r/ij, 0 is an eigenvalue 
of multiplicity m for B"^ by Lemma 2.61. Since Wi is the eigenspace corresponding to 
the eigenvalue 0 of B'^, it follows from Proposition 2.43 that dim Wj < m. 
D 
d. Jordan's canonical form 
2.62 Definition. A matrix B E Mn^n^) 
^s said to he nilpotent if there 
exists k >0 such that B'^ = 0. 
Let B G Mq^q{C) be a nilpotent matrix and let k be such that B^ = 0, but 
gfc-i _^ Q p^^ g^ basis (ei, 62,..., Cg) of kerB, and, for each z = 1,..., s, 
set ej := Ci and define ef, ef,..., ef' to solve the systems Be^ '-= ^i~ 
for 
j = 2,3... as long as possible. Let {e^}, j = 1,..., fc^, z = 1,..., ^, be the 
family of vectors obtained this way. 
2.63 Theorem (Canonical form of a nilpotent matrix). Let "B be a 
q X q nilpotent matrix. Using the previous notation, {e]} is a basis ofC^. 
Consequently, if we write B with respect to this basis, we get a qxq 
matrix 
B' similar to B of the form

The reduced matrix B' is called the canonical Jordan form of the nilpo-
tent matrix B. 
Proof. The kernels Hj := ker B-^ of B-^, j = 1,... ,k, form a strictly increasing sequence 
of subspaces 
{0} = i/o C //i C i/2 C • • • C Hk-i C Hk := C*?. 
The claim then follows by iteratively applying the following lemma. 
D 
2.64 Lemma. For j = 1,2,... ,k — l, let (ei, e2,..., Cp) be a basis of Hj 
and let xi, X2,..., x^ be all possible solutions of Bxj = Cj, j = 1,... ,p. 
Then (ei, 62,..., ep,xi, X2,..., Xr) is a basis for Hj^\. 
Proof. In fact, it is easily seen that 
o the vectors ei, e2, •.., Cp, xi, 0:2, • • •, Xr are linearly independent, 
o {ei, 62,..., ep,a;i, X2,..., Xr} C 
Hj^i, 
o the image of Hj^i by B is contained in Hj. 
Thus r, which is the number of elements ei in the image of B, is the dimension of the 
image of i/j+i by B. The rank formula then yields 
dim Hj^i = dim Hj -\- dim f Im B PI if j+i ) = 
p-\-r. 
Now consider a generic matrix A G M„,n(C). We first rewrite A using 
a basis of generalized eigenvectors to get a new matrix A' similar to A of 
the form

where each block A^ has the dimension of the algebraic multiplicity rrii 
of the eigenvalue A^ and a unique eigenvalue A^. Moreover, the matrix 
Ci := AJd - Ai is nilpotent, and precisely C^' 
= 0 and C^"''^ •=/- 0. 
Applying Theorem 2.63 to each Cj, we then show that A^ is similar to 
\i Id + B' where B' is as (2.11). Therefore, we conclude the following. 
2.65 Theorem (Jordan's canonical form). Lei Ai, A2,.., A^; he all 
distinct eigenvalues of A e Mn,n(C). For every z = 1,..., A: 
(i) let (^2,1,..., Ui^p.) be a basis of the eigenspace Vx. (as we know, pi < 
rii), 
(ii) consider the generalized eigenvectors relative to Ai defined as follows: 
for any j = 
1,2,...,pi, 
a) set ejj := Uij, 
b) set efj to be a solution of 
iA-Xild)efj=e

a 
(2.14) 
as long as the system (2.14) is solvable, 
c) denote by OL{i,j) the number of solved systems plus 1. 
Then for every i = 1,... ,k the list (efj) with j = 1,... ,pi and a = 
1,..., 
a(i,j) 
is a basis for the generalized eigenspace Wi relative to \i. Hence the 
full list

A is lower triangular hence the eigenvalues of A are 2 with multiplicity 3 and 3 with 
multiplictiy 2. 
We then have 
A - 2 I d = 
A — 2Id has rank 4 since the columns of A of indices 1, 2, 3 and 5 are linearly inde-
pendent. Therefore the eigenspace V2 has dimension 5 — 4 == 1 by the rank formula. We 
now compute a nonzero eigenvalue,

2.2 Eigenvectors and Similar Matrices

e. Elementary divisors 
As we have seen, the characteristic polynomial 
det(5ld-A), 
seK, 
is invariant by similarity transformations. However, in general the equality 
of two characteristic polynomials does not imply that the two matrices be 
similar. 
2.67 Example. The unique eigenvalue of the matrix A^ = I 
I is AQ and has 
V /i 
XoJ 
multiplicity 2. The corresponding eigenspace is given by the solutions of the system 
{
O'x'^ +0'X^ 
=0, 
fjLX^ + 0 • X^ = 0. 
If /x 7^ 0, then VXO,M ^ ^ dimension 1. Notice that AQ is diagonal, while A^ is not 
diagonal. Moreover, AQ and A^ with fi ^ 0 are not similar. 
It would be interesting to find a complete set of invariants that char-
acterizes the class of similarity of a matrix, without going explictly into 
Jordan's reduction algorithm. Here we mention a few results in this direc-
tion. 
Let A e Mn,n(C). The determinants of the minors of order k of the 
matrix 5 Id — A form a subset T>k of polynomials in the s variable. Denote 
by Dk{s) the g.c.d. of these polynomials whose coefiicient of the maximal 
degree term is normalized to 1. Moreover set Do{s) := 1. Using Laplace's 
formula, one sees that Dk-i{s) 
divides Dk{s) for all k = l,...,n. The 
polynomiSfe 
are called the elementary divisors of A. They form a complete set of invari-
ants that describe the complex similarity class of A. In fact, the following 
holds. 
2.68 Theorem. The following claims are equivalent 
(i) A and B are similar as complex matrices, 
(ii) A and B have the same Jordan's canonical form (up to permutations 
of rows and columns), 
(iii) A and B have the same elementary divisors.

3- Euclidean and Hermitian 
Spaces 
3.1 The Geometry of Euclidean and 
Hermitian Spaces 
Until now we have introduced several different languages, linear indepen-
dence, matrices and products, linear maps that are connected in several 
ways to linear systems and stated some results. The structure we used is 
essentially hnearity. A new structure, the inner product, provides a richer 
framework that we shall illustrate in this chapter. 
a. Euclidean spaces 
3.1 Definition. Let X be a real vector space. An inner product on X is 
a map ( | ) : X x X —^W which is 
o (BILINEAR) (X,2/) —> {x\y) is linear in each factor, i.e., 
{Xx + fiy\z) = X{x\z) + fi{y\z), 
{x\Xy -h /iz) = X{x\y) + fi{x\z), 
for all x,y,z 
e X, for all A, // G M. 
o (SYMMETRIC) {x\y) 
= {y\x) 
for all x,y 
e 
X. 
o (POSITIVE DEFINITE) {X\X) > 0 VX and {x\x) =0 if and only if x = 0. 
The nonnegative real number 
\x\ := y/{x\x) 
is called the norm of x e X. 
A finite-dimensional vector space X with an inner product is called 
an Euclidean vector space, and the inner product of X is called the scalar 
product of X. 
3.2 Example. The map ( | ) : R^ x E'^ -^ R defined by 
(x|y) := x . y = f ^ ^ V , 
x := {x\ x^,..., x^), y := {y\ y\ ... ^ y^)

3. Euclidean and Hermitian Spaces 
is an inner product on W^, called the standard scalar product of R^, and W^ with 
this scalar product is an Euclidean space. In some sense, as we shall see later, see 
Proposition 3.25, it is the unique Euclidean space of dimension n. 
Other examples of inner products on M^ can be obtained by weighing the coordi-
nates by nonnegative real numbers. Let Ai, A2, •. •, An be positive real numbers. Then 
(x|y) •.= ^ \ i x Y , 
x = (xi, x 2 , . . . , x"), y = {y\ 
y\...,y") 
i=l 
is an inner product on R^. 
Other examples of inner products in infinite-dimensional vector spaces can be found 
in Chapter 10. 
Let X be a vector space with an inner product. Prom the bihnearity of 
the inner product we deduce that 
(3.1) 
\x + 2/p = {x + y\x + y) = {x\x + t/) + {y\x + y) 
= {x\x) + 2{x\y) + {y\y) = \x\^ + 2{x\y) + l^l^ 
from which we infer the following. 
3.3 Theorem. The following hold. 
(i) (PARALLELOGRAM IDENTITY) We have 
\x + y\^ + \x-yf 
= 2 (|x|2 + \yf) 
Vx, 
yeX. 
(ii) (POLARITY FORMULA) We have 
{x\y) = 4 (k + 2/P - k - y\^) 
Vx, yeX, 
hence we can get the scalar product of x and y by computing two 
norms. 
(iii) (CAUCHY-SCHWARZ INEQUALITY) The following inequality holds 
\{x\y)\<\x\ 
\yl 
V X , 7 / G X ; 
moreover^ {x\y) = \x\\y\ if and only if either y = 0 or x = Xy for 
some A G M, A > 0. 
Proof, (i), (ii) follow trivially from (3.1). Let us prove (iii). If y = 0, the claim is trivial. 
If 2/ 7^ 0, the function < -^ |x -f iyp, i 6 E, is a second order nonnegative polynomial 
since 
0<\x-\- 
ty\'^ = ix + ty\x + ty) = {x-\- ty\x) -f (x + ty\ty) = \x\'^ + 2{x\y) t + |y|^ *^; 
hence its discriminant is nonpositive, thus ((x\y))'^ — |xp|2/p < 0. 
If {x\y) = \x\ \y\, then the discriminant of t —>• |x -f ty\^ vanishes. If t/ 7^ 0, then 
for some t G M we have \x + *2/P = 0, i.e., x = —ty. Finally, —t is nonnegative since 
-t{y\y) 
=: ix\y) = \x\ \y\ > 0.

3.4 Definition. Let X be a vector space with an inner product. Two vec-
tors x,y G X are said to be orthogonal, and we write x Ly, if {x\y) = 0.

Prom (3.1) we immediately infer the following. 
3.5 Proposition (Pythagorean theorem). Let X be a vector space 
with an inner product. Then two vectors x^y G X are orthogonal if and 
only if

3.6 Carnot's formula. Let x,y G M^ be two nonzero vectors of R^, 
that we think of as the plane of Euclidean geometry with an orthogonal 
Cartesian reference. Setting x := (a, 6), y := (c, d), and denoting by 6 the 
angle between Ox and Oy, it is easy to see that |x|, |y| are the lengths of 
the two segments Ox and Oy, and that x«y := ac-\- bd = |x| |y| cos^. 
Thus (3.1) reads as Carnot's formula 
|x + yp = |xp -h |yp H- 2|x| |y| cos^. 
In general, given two vectors x,y G R", we have by Cauchy-Schwarz 
inequality | x » y | < | x | | y | , hence there exists a ^ G R such that 
x»y 
. 
=: cos^. 
m \y\ 
6 is called the angle between x and y and denoted by xy. In this way (3.1) 
rewrites as Carnot 's formula 
|x -f yp = |xp + |yp + 2|x| |y| cosl9. 
Notice that the angle 6 is defined up to the sign, since cos^ is an even 
function. 
3.7 Proposition. Let X be a Euclidean vector space and let { \ ) be its 
inner product. The norm of x G X, 
|x| := y/{x\x) 
is a function \ | : X -^ R with the following properties 
(i) \x\ G R4. Vx G X. 
(ii) (NONDEGENERACY) \X\ =0 if and only ifx = 0. 
(iii) 
(1-HOMOGENEITY) |AX| = |A| |x| VA G R, Vx G 
X. 
(iv) (TRIANGULAR INEQUALITY) \x-\-y\ < \x\ + \y\ \/x,y G X. 
Proof, (i), (ii), (iii) are trivial (iv) follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality since 
\x + 2/|2 = |x|2 + |t/|2 + 2{y\x) < |x|2 + |y|2 + 2 \{y\x)\ 
<|xp + |2/|2+2|x|M = (N + M)2). 
D 
Finally, we call the distance between x and y G X the number 
d{x,y) := \x — y\. It is trivial to check, using Proposition 3.7, that the 
distance function d : X x X ^^ R defined by d{x,y) := \x — y\^ has the 
following properties 

82 
3. Euclidean and Hermitian Spaces 
(i) (NONDEGENERACY) d(x, y) >0^x,y 
e X and d{x, y) = 0 ii and only 
ii X = y. 
(ii) (SYMMETRY) d{x,y) = d{y,x) Vx,?/ € X. 
(iii) (TRIANGULAR INEQUALITY) d{x,y) < d(x,z) + d{z,y) Vx,y,z e X. 
We refer to d as the distance in X induced by the inner product. 
3.8 Inner products in coordinates. Let X be a Euclidean space, de-
note by ( I ) its inner product, and let (ei, 62,..., e^) be a basis of X. If 
^ = ElLi ^'^i^ y = EILi y'^i ^ ^i then by linearity 
{x\y) = 
Y^x'y^{ei\ej). 
The matrix 
G = [gij], 
Qij = {ei\ej) 
is called the Gram matrix of the scalar product in the basis (ei, eg, • • •, ^n)-
Introducing the coordinate column vectors x = (x^, x^,..., x'^)'^ and y = 
(2/^, y^,..., 2/"^)^ G R"^ and denoting by • • • the standard scalar product 
in R"^, we have 
{x\y) = x . G y = x^Gy 
rows by columns. We notice that 
(i) G is symmetric, G^ — G, since the scalar product is symmetric, 
(ii) G is positive definite, i.e., x^Gx > 0 Vx G R"' and x^Gx = 0 if and 
only if X — 0, in particular, G is invertible. 
b. Hermit ian spaces 
A similar structure exists on complex vector spaces. 
3.9 Definition. Let X be a vector space over C. A Hermitian product on 
X is a map {\):XxX-^C 
which is 
(i) (SESQUILINEAR), 
i.e., 
{av -h (iw\z) = a{v\z) + l3{w\z), 
{v\aw -f /3z) = a{v\w) -h l3{v\z) 
(ii) (HERMITIAN) {Z\UJ) = (wlz) "iw.z £ X, in particular {z\z) G \ 
yzex. 
(iii) (POSITIVE DEFINITE) (Z\Z) > 0 and {z\z) = 0 if and only if z = 0. 
The nonnegative real number \z\ :=^ y^{z\z) is called the norm of z E X. 
3.10 Definition. A finite-dimensional complex space with a Hermitian 
product is called a Hermitian space. 

3.1 The Geometry of Euclidean and Hermitian Spaces 
83 
3.11 Example. Of course the product (z,w) -^ {z\w) := wz is a Hermitian product 
on C. More generally, the map ( | ) : C^ x C" —^ C defined by 
n 
{z\w) := z » w := ^z^w^ 
Mz = (z^, z^,..., 
^ " ) , w = {w'^, w'^,..., 
w'^) 
J=i 
is a Hermitian product on C^, called the standard Hermitian product of C^. As we shall 
see later, see Proposition 3.25, C^ equipped with the standard Hermitian product is in 
a sense the only Hermitian space of dimension n. 
Let X be a complex vector space with a Hermitian product ( | ). Prom 
the properties of the Hermitian product we deduce

from which we infer at once the following. 
3.12 Theorem, 
(i) We have 
(ii) (PARALLELOGRAM IDENTITY) We have 
\z + w\'^ -\-\z-wf 
= 2 (|zp + \wf)

4:{z\w) =: (\z -\- w\'^ — \z — w;p 1 4- if 1^: -h iw\'^ — \z — iw\ 
2^ 
for all z^w G X. We therefore can compute the Hermitian product of 
z and w by computing four norms. 
(iv) (CAUCHY-SCHWARZ INEQUALITY) The following inequality holds 
\{z\w)\ < \z\ \wl 
yz.weX; 
moreover {z\w) = \z\ \w\ if and only if either w = 0, or z = Xw for 
some A G M, A > 0. 
Proof, (i), (ii), (iii) follow trivially from (3.2). Let us prove (iv). Let z, w E X and 
A = te*^, t,e eR. From (3.2) 
0 < |z + \w\'^ = t'^\w\'^ + \z\^ + 2t^{e-'yz\w)) 
Vt G M, 
hence its discriminant is nonpositive, thus 
me-'»{z\w))\ 
< \z\ \w\. 
Since 0 is arbitrary, we conclude |(2;|ii;)| < \z\ \w\. The second part of the claim then 
follows as in the real case. If {z\w) = \z\ \w\, then the discriminant of the real polynomial 
t —> |2 + ttyp, t e R, vanishes. If -w; ^i^ 0, for some t G M we have \z + tw\'^ = 0, i.e., 
z = —tw. Finally, —t is nonnegative since —t{w\w) = {z\w) = \z\ \w\ > 0.

3.14 Definition. Let X be a complex vector space with a Hermitian prod-
uct ( I ). Two vectors z^w e X are said to be orthogonal, and we write 
z 1.W, if {z\w) = 0. 
Prom (3.2) we immediately infer the following. 
3.15 Proposition (Pythagorean theorem). Let X be a complex vec-
tor space with a Hermitian product ( | ). If z^w E X are orthogonal, then 
We see here a diiference between the real and the complex cases. Contrary 
to the real case, two complex vectors, such that |z + i(;p = |2:p + |if;p holds, 
need not be orthogonal. For instance, choose X := C, {z\w) := wz, and let 
z = 1 and w = i. 
3.16 Proposition. Let X be a complex vector space with a Hermitian 
product on it. The norm of z e X, 
\z\ := 
^/(z\z), 
is a real-valued function \ \ : X —^R with the following properties 
(i) \z\ G R+ Vz G X. 
(ii) (NONDEGENERACY) \Z\=0

(iv) 
(TRIANGULAR INEQUALITY) \Z-\-W\ < \z\ + \w\ \/z,w 
G X. 
Proof, (i), (ii), (iii) are trivial, (iv) follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality since 
\z + w\^ = \z\^ -f k|2 + 2^(z\w) < \z\^ + |i/;|2 + 2 \(z\w)\ 
<\z\^ + \w\^ + 2\z\\w\ = (\z\ +

D 
Finally, we call distance between two points z^w oi X the real number 
d{z,w) := \z — w\. It is trivial to check, using Proposition 3.16, that the 
distance function d : X x X ^^ R defined by d{z,w) := \z — w\ has the 
following properties 
(i) (NONDEGENERACY) d{z,w) > 0 yz,w e X and d{z,w) = 0 if and 
only ii z = w. 
(ii) (SYMMETRY) d{z,w) = d{w,z) ^z.w G X.

the Gram matrix associated to the Hermitian product is defined by setting

if z = (z^, z^,..., z'^), w = (it;^, w'^,..., w'^) G C^ are the coordinate 
vector columns of z and w in the basis (ei, e2,..., Cn)- Notice that 
(i) G is a Hermitian matrix, G 
= G, 
(ii) G is positive definite, i.e., z^Gz > 0 Vz G C^ and z^Gz = 0 if and 
only if z = 0, in particular, G is invertible. 
c. Orthonormal basis and the Gram—Schmidt algorithm

a Hermitian vector space with Hermitian product ( | ). ^4 system of vectors

iea\ep) =Sap 
Va,/3 G A 
Orthonormal vectors are hnearly independent. In particular, n orthonor-
mal vectors in a Euclidean or Hermitian vector space of dimension n form 
a basis, called an orthonormal basis. 
3.19 Example. The canonical basis (ei, e 2 , . . . , Cn) of E"^ is an orthonormal basis for 
the standard inner product in E". 
Similarly, the canonical basis (ei, 6 2 , . . . , en) of C^ is an orthonormal basis for the 
standard Hermitian product in C"^. 
3.20 %. Let ( I ) be an inner (Hermitian) product on a Euclidean (Hermitian) space 
X of dimension n and let G be the associated Gram matrix in a basis (ei, 62,..., en)-
Show that G = Idn if and only if (ei, e2,. •., en) is orthonormal. 
Starting from a denumerable system of linearly independent vectors, 
we can construct a new denumerable system of orthonormal vectors that 
span the same subspaces by means of the Gram-Schmidt 
algorithm, 
3.21 Theorem (Gram-Schmidt). Let X be a real (complex) vector 
space with inner (Hermitian) product ( | ). Let t'l, t;2,..., t'jt,... be a de-
numerable set of linearly independent vectors in X. Then there exist a set 
of orthonormal vectors wi, W2,. - -, Wk,- • - such that for each fc = 1,2,... 
Span|it;i, W2,..., wA = Spanjt'i, t'2,.--, Vkj.

d. Isometries 
3.23 Definition. Let X^Y he two real (complex) vector spaces with inner 
(Hermitian) products ( | )x and ( | )y. We say that a linear map A : X -^ 
Y is an isometry if and only if 
\A{X)\Y 
= \x\x 
Vx e 
X, 
or, equivalently, compare the polar formula, if 
{A{x)\A{y))Y = {x\y)x 
^x,yeX. 
Isometries are trivially injective, but not surjective. If there exists a sur-
jective isometry between two Euclidean (Hermitian) spaces, then X and 
Y are said to be isometric. 
3.24 %. Let X,Y 
be two real (complex) vector spaces with inner (Hermitian) products 
{ \ )x and { \ )Y and let A : X —>• V be a linear map. Show that the following claims 
are equivalent 
(i) A is an isometry, 
(ii) B C X is am orthonormal basis if and only if A{B) is an orthonormal basis for 
A{X). 
Let X be a real vector space with inner product ( | ) or a complex 
vector space with Hermitian product ( | ). Let (ei, e2,..., e^) be a basis 
in X and f : X -^ K^, (K = R of K = C) be the corresponding sys-
tem of coordinates. Proposition 3.22 implies that the following claims are 
equivalent. 
(i) (ei, 62,..., Cn) is an orthonormal basis, 
(ii) £{x) = ((x|ei),...,(x|en)), 
(iii) £ is an isometry between X and the Euclidean space W^ with the 
standard scalar product (or C^ with the standard Hermitian product). 
In this way, the Gram-Schmidt algorithm yields the following. 
3.25 Proposition. Let X be a real vector space with inner product ( | ) 
(or a complex vector space with Hermitian product { \ )) of dimension n. 
Then X is isometric to R^ with the standard scalar product (respectively, to 
C^ with the standard Hermitian product), the isometry being the coordinate 
system associated to an orthonormal basis. 
In other words, using an orthonormal basis on X is the same as identifying 
X with R"^ (or with C") with the canonical inner (Hermitian) product. 
3.26 Isometries in coordinates. Let us compute the matrix associated to an isom-
etry R : X -^ Y between two Euclidean spaces of dimension n and m respectively, in 
an orthonormal basis (so that X and Y are respectively isometric to R^ (C^) and W^ 
(C^) by means of the associated coordinate system). It is therefore sufficient to discuss 
real isometries i? : E^ -^ E"^ and complex isometries RiC^ 
-^C^. 
Let i? : E^ —)• E ^ be linear and let R € Mm,nW 
be the associated matrix, 
il(x) = Rx, X G E"^. Denoting by (ei, e2,.. •, en) the canonical basis of E", 

3. Euclidean and Hermitian Spaces 
R = ri r2 
... 
Fn , 
Ti = Rej Vi. 
Since (ei, e 2 , . . . , Cn) is orthonormal, R is an isometry if and only if (ri, rg, • •., Tn) 
are orthonormal. In particular, m > n and 
Tj Ti = Ti* Tj = 5ij 
i.e., the matrix R is an orthogonal matrix^ 
R ^ R = Idn. 
When m — n, the isometries il : R'^ —» R'^ are necessarily surjective being injective, 
and form a group under composition. As above, we deduce that the group of isometries 
of R'^ is isomorphic to the orthogonal group 0(n) defined by 
0{n) := | R e Mn,n(R) | R ^ R = Idn}. 
Observe that a square orthogonal matrix R is invertible with R~^ = R-^. If follows 
that R R ^ = Id and | det R| = 1. 
Similarly, consider C^ as a Hermit ian space with the standard Hermitian product. 
Let R:C 
-^C^ 
he linear and let R € Mm,n(C) be such that R{z) = Rz. Denoting 
by (ei, e 2 , . . . , Cn) the canonical basis of R^, 
R = 
ri r2 
... 
Fn , 
Ti = Rei Vi = 1,..., m. 
Since (ei, e 2 , . . . , en) is orthonormal, R is an isometry if and only if r i , r2,.. •, rn are 
orthonormal. In particular, m > n and 
i.e., the matrix R is a unitary 
matrix, 
R ^ R = Idn. 
When 171 = 71, the isometries R : C^ -^ C^ are necessarily surjective being injective, 
moreover they form a group under composition. From the above, we deduce that the 
group of isometries of C^ is isomorphic to the unitary group U(n) defined by 
U{n) := | R € Mn,n(C) | R ^ R = Idn}. 
Observe that a square unitary matrix R is invertible with R 
^ = R . I t follows that 
R R ^ = Id and | det R| = 1. 
e. The projection theorem 
Let X be a real (complex) vector space with inner (Hermitian) product 
( I ) that is not necessarily finite dimensional, let F C X be a finite-
dimensional linear subspace of X of dimension k and let (ei, 62,..., e^) 
be an orthonormal basis of V. 
We say that x G X is orthogonal to V if {x\v) = 0 Vz; G 1^. As 
(ei, e2,..., ek) is a basis of V, x 1.V if andonly if (x|ei) = 0 Vi = 1,... ,fc. 
For all a; G X, the vector 
Py{x) :=^{x\ei)ei 
eV 
i=i 

3.1 The Geometry of Euclidean and Hermitian Spaces 
89 
is called the orthogonal projection of x in F, and the map Py : X -^ V, 
X —> Pv{x), the projection map onto V. By Proposition 3.22, Py(x) = x 
if X G F, hence ImP = V and P^ = P. By Proposition 3.22 we also have 
|Py(x)p = Zli=i l(^ki)P- The next theorem explains the name for Pv{x) 
and shows that in fact Pv{x) is well defined as it does not depend on the 
chosen basis (ei, e2, • •., e/c). 
3.27 Theorem (of orthogonal projection). With the previous nota-
tion, there exists a unique z G V such that x — z is orthogonal to V, 
i.e., {x — z\v) = 0 \fv e V. Moreover, the following claims are equivalent. 
(i) X — z is orthogonal to V, i.e., {x — z\v) = 0 ^v e V, 
(ii) z GV is the orthogonal projection of x onto V, z = Pv{x), 
(iii) z is the point in V of minimum distance from x, i.e., 
\x — z\ < \x — v\ 
Mv GV^ V ^ z. 
In particular, Pv{x) is well defined as it does not depend on the chosen 
orthonormal basis and there is a unique minimizer of the function v -^ 
\x — v\, V e V, the vector z = Pv{x). 
Proof. We first prove uniqueness. U zi,Z2 £V are such that (x — Zi\v) = 0 ioT i = I, 2, 
then {zi — Z2\v) = 0 Vt; G V, in particular \zi — Z2\'^ = 0. 
(i) => (ii). From (i) we have {x\ei) = {z\ei) Vi = 1 , . . . , fc. By Proposition 3.22 
k 
k 
z = Y^{z\ei)ei 
= '^{x\ei)ei 
= 
Pv{x). 
i=i 
1=1 
This also shows existence of a point z such that x — z is orthogonal to V and that the 
definition of Pv{x) is independent of the chosen orthonormal basis (ei, 62,..., e^). 
(ii) =^ (i). Ii z = Py{x), 
we have for every j = 1,... 
,k 
k 
{x - z\ej) = {x\ej) - '^{x\ei)(ei\ej) 
= {x\ej) - {x\ej) = 0, 
i=l 
hence (x — z\v) = 0 Vi'. 
(i) => (iii). Let v EV. Since {x — z\v) = 0 v/e have 
\x-v\'^ 
= \x- 
z-\- z-vl"^ 
= \x- 
z\'^ -\-\z- 
i;p, 
hence (iii). 
(iii) =^ (i). Let v e V. The function t ^y \x — z + tvp, t G M, has a minimum point at 
t = 0. Since 
\x- 
z + tvl"^ = \x - z\'^ + 2t^{x 
- z\v) -\- t'^\v\'^, 
necessarily 3f?(x — z\v) = 0. If X is a real vector space, this means {x — z\v) = 0, 
hence (i). If X is a complex vector space, from R{x — z\v) = 0 \/v e V, we also have 
3f?(e-^^(x - z\v)) = 0 V(9 € M Vv G V, hence {x - z\v) = 0 Vi; € V and thus (ii). 
D 
We can discuss linear independence in terms of an orthogonal projec-
tion. In fact, for any finite-dimensional space V C X, x e V ii and only 
if X — PY{X) = 0, equivalently, the equation x — Pv{x) = 0 is an implicit 
equation that characterizes V as the kernel of Id- 
Py.

3.32 Projections in coordinates. Let X be a Euclidean (Hermitian) space of di-
mension n and let F C X be a subspace of dimension k. Let us compute the matrix 
associated to the orthogonal projection operator Py : X -^ X in an orthonormal basis. 
Of course, it suffices to think of Py as of the orthogonal projection on a subspace of 
R^ (C^ in the complex case). 
Let (ei, e 2 , . . . , en) be the canonical basis of R^ and V C R^. Let vi, V2,..., v^

f. Orthogonal subspaces 
Let X be a real vector space with inner product ( | ) or a complex vector 
space with Hermitian product ( | ). Suppose X is finite dimensional and 
let W^ C X be a linear subspace of X. The subset 
ly-^ := {x G X I {x\y) 
=OyyeW^ 
is called the orthogonal of W in X.

W. Then we can complete (vi, V2,... •, v^) with n — k vectors of the canonical basis to 
get a new basis of X. Then the Gram-Schmidt procedure yields an orthonormal basis

g. Riesz's theorem 
3.34 Theorem (Riesz). Let X be a Euclidean or Hermitian space of di-
mension n. For any L e X* there is a unique XL G X such that 
L{X) = {X\XL) 
V X G X . 
' 
(3.5) 
Proof. Assume for instance, that X is Hermitian. Suppose L ^ 0, otherwise we choose 
XL = 0, and observe that dimlmL = 1, and V := kerL has dimension n — 1 if 
dimX = n. Fix XQ G V-^ with |a:o| = 1, then every x E X decomposes as 
X = x' -\- XxQ, 
x' 6 kerL, A = (x|a:o)-
Consequently, 
L{x) = I/(a:') -f AL(xo) = (x|a;o)I/(a:o) = (a;|L(xo)xo) 
and the claim follows choosing x^ '= L{xo)xo. 
• 
The map (3 : X* ^^ X, L ^^ XL defined by the Riesz theorem is called 
the Riesz map. Notice that /? is linear if X is Euclidean and antilinear if 
X is Hermitian. 
3.35 The Riesz map in coordinates. Let X be a Euclidean (Hermitian) space 
with inner (Hermitian) product ( | ), fix a basis and denote by x = (x^, x^,..., x'^) the 
coordinates of x, and by G the Gram matrix of the inner (Hermitian) product. 
Let L G X* and let L be the associated matrix, L{x) = Lx. From (3.5) 
Lx = L{x) = {X\XL) 
= X-^GXL 
if X is Euclidean, 
Lx = L{x) = {X\XL)

3. Euclidean and Hermitian Spaces 
Figure 3.1. Dynamometer. 
3.36 Example (Work and forces). Suppose a mass m is fixed to a dynamometer. 
If 9 is the inclination of the dynamometer, the dynamometer shows the number 
L = mg cos 0, 
(3.6) 
where p is a suitable constant. Notice that we need no coordinates in R"^ to read the 
dynamometer. We may model the lecture of the dynamometer as a map of the direction 
V of the dynamometer, that is, as a map L : S"^ —* R from the unit sphere 5"^ = {x € 
E^ Ma;I = 1} of the ambient space V into R. Moreover, extending L homogeneously to 
the entire space V by setting L{v) := \v\ L{v/\v\), 
v e R^ \ {0}, we see that such an 
extension is linear because of the simple dependence of L from the inclination. Thus 
we can model the elementary 
work done on the mass m, the measures made using 
the dynamometer, by a linear map L : V -^ R. Thinking of the ambient space V as 
Euclidean, by Riesz's theorem we can represent L as a scalar product, introducing a 
vector F := XL EV such that 
{v\F) = L(y) 
Vt; G V. 
We interpret such a vector as the force whose action on the mass produces the elemen-
tary work L{v). 
Now fix a basis (ei,62,63) of V. li F = (F^^F"^, F^)^ 
is the column vector of the 
force coordinates and L = (Li,L2,I/3) is the 1 x 3 matrix of the coordinates of L in 
the dual basis, that is, the three readings Li = L{ei), i = 1,2,3, of the dynamometer 
in the directions 61,62,63, then, as we have seen. 
In particular, if (61,62,63) is an orthonormal basis. 
h. The adjoint operator 
Let XyY be two vector spaces both on K = M or K = C with inner 
(Hermitian) products ( | )x and ( | )y and let A : X -^Y he a, hnear map. 
For any y eV the map 
X -> {A{x)\y)Y 

3.1 The Geometry of Euclidean and Hermitian Spaces

defines a linear map on X, hence by Riesz's theorem there is a unique 
A*{y) e X such that 
{A{x)\y)Y = {y\A%x))x 
Vx G X, Vy e Y, 
(3.7) 
It is easily seen that the map y -^ A*{y) from Y into X defined by (3.7) 
is linear: it is called the adjoint of A. Moreover, 
(i) let A,B 
: X -^ Y he two linear maps between two Euchdean or 
Hermitian spaces. Then {A + B)* = A* ^ B*, 
(ii) (XA)* = XA* if A G M and A : X ^ Y is SL hnear map between two 
Euclidean_spaces, 
(iii) (XA)* = XA"" if A G C and A : X ^ F is a hnear map between two 
Hermitian spaces, 
(iv) (5 o A)* = A* o 5* if A : X ^ F and B : F ^ Z are hnear maps 
between Euclidean (Hermitian) spaces, 
(v) (A*)* = ^ i f A : X - ^ y i s a linear map.

3.38 The adjoint operator in coordinates. Let X, Y be two Euclidean (Hermi-
tian) spaces with inner (Hermitian) products { \ )x and ( | )y. Fix two bases in X 
and y , and denote the Gram matrices of the inner (Hermitian) products on X and Y 
respectively, by G and H. Denote by x the coordinates of a vector x. Let A : X -^ Y 
be a linear map. A* be the adjoint map and let A, A* be respectively, the associated 
matrices. Then we have 
(A(x)\y)Y 
= x^A^Hy, 
{x\A*{y)) = x^'GA'y, 
if X and Y are Euclidean and 
(A{x)\y)Y 
= x^A^Hy, 
{x\A*iy)) 
= x^GA^^y, 
if X and Y are Hermitian. Therefore 
GA* = A ^ H 
if X and Y are Euclidean, 
GA* = A ^ H 
if X and Y are Hermitian, 
or, recalling that G ^ = G, ( G ~ i ) ^ = G - \ H ^ = H if X and Y are Euclidean and 
that G ^ = G, ( G - i ) ^ = G - i , and H ^ = H if X and Y are Hermitian, we find 
A* = G - ^ A ^ H 
if X and Y are Euclidean, 
A* = G~^ A ^ H 
if X and r are Hermitian. 
In particular. 
A* = A ^ 
in the Euclidean case, 
_ r 
(3.8) 
A* = A 
in the Hermitian case 
if and only if the chosen bases in X and Y are orthonormal.

3. Euclidean and Hermitian Spaces 
3.39 Theorem. Let A: X -^Y be a linear operator between two Euclid-
ean or two Hermitian spaces and let A* : Y -^ X be its adjoint. Then 
Rank^* = Rank^. Moreover, 
(Im^)-^=ker^*, 
{lmA*)-^=kerA, 
I m ^ = ( k e r ^ * ) ^ , 
IinA* = (ker^)-^. 
Proof. Fix two orthonormal bases on X and Y, and let A be the matrix associated to 
A using these bases. Then, see (3.8), the matrix associated to A* is A-^, hence 
Rank A* = Rank A ^ = Rank A = Rank A, 
and 
dim(ker A*)-^ = dim Y - dim ker A* = Rank A* = Rank A = dim Im A. 
On the other hand, Im A C (ker A*)-*- since, if t/ = A{x) and A*{v) = 0, then {y\v) = 
(A{x)\v) = {x\A*{v)) = 0. We then conclude that (ker A*)-*- = ImA. The other claims 
easily follow. In fact, they are all equivalent to ImA = (kerA*)-*-. 
D 
As an immediate consequence of Theorem 3.39 we have the following. 
3.40 Theorem (The alternative theorem). Let A : X -^ Y be a 
linear operator between two Euclidean or two Hermitian spaces and let 
A* : Y -^ X be its adjoint. Then A|kerA-L * (ker^)-^ -^ ImA and 
At^ 
: ImA —^ (ker^)-^ are injective and onto, hence isomorphisms. 
Moreover, 
(i) A(x) = y has at least a solution if and only if y is orthogonal to 
kerA^ 
(ii) y is orthogonal to ImA if and only if A*{y) = 0, 
(iii) A is injective if and only if A* is surjective, 
(iv) A is surjective if and only if A* is injective. 
3.41 . A more direct proof of the equaUty ker A = (Im^*)-^ is the fol-
lowing. For simplicity, consider the real case. Clearly, it suffices to work in 
coordinates and by choosing an orthonormal basis, it is enough to show 
that Im A = (ker A^)-^ for every matrix A € Mm,n{^)-
Let A = (a'j) G Mm„n{^) and let a^, a^,..., a"^ be the rows of A, 
equivalently the columns of A^, 
/ a i \ 
A =

Then,

3-2 Metrics on Real Vector Spaces 
In this section, we discuss bilinear forms on real vector spaces. One can 
develop similar considerations in the complex setting, but we refrain from 
doing it. 
a. Bilinear forms and linear operators 
3.42 Definition. Let X he a real linear space. A bilinear form on X is a 
map 6 : X X X —> M that is linear in each factor, i.e., 
b{ax + /3y, z)=a 
6(x, z)-\-(3b{y, z), 
6(x, ay -\- f3z) = a 6(x, y) + 0 b{z, z). 
for all X, y, X G X and all 
a,l3e 
forms on X by B{X). 
We denote the space of all bilinear 
Observe that, if 6 G B{X), then 6(0, x) - b{0,y) = 0 Vx,?/ G X. The 
class of bihnear forms becomes a vector space if we set 
(6i + 62)(x,y) := 6i(x,y) + b2{x,y), 
(A6)(x, y) := 6(Ax, y) =- 6(x, A, y). 
Suppose that X is a linear space with an inner product denoted by 
( I ). If 6 G S(X), then for every y e X the map x -^ b{x,y) is linear, 
consequently, by Riesz's theorem there is a unique B := B{y) G X such 
that 
b{x,y) = {x\B{y)) 
Vx G X. 
(3.10) 
It is easily seen that the map y —> B{y) from Y into X defined by (3.10) 
is linear. Thus (3.10) defines a one-to-one correspondence between B{X) 
and the space of linear operators £(X, X), and it is easy to see this corre-
spondence is a linear isomorphism between B{X) and £(X, X).

3.43 Bilinear forms in coordinates. Let X be a finite-dimensional vector space 
and let (ei, 62,..., e-n) be a basis of X. Let us denote by B the nxn 
matrix, sometimes 
called the Gram matrix of b. 
B = [bij] 
bij = 
b{ei,ej). 
Recall that the first index from the left is the row index. Then by linearity, if for every x, 
2/, X = {x^, cc^,..., ic^)^ and y = (y^, 2/^, • • •, y^)^ 
€ M^ are respectively, the column 
vectors of the coordinates of x and y, we have 
bix,y) = J2 ^ij^'y' = x^-lBy) =x^By. 
In particular, a coordinate system induces a one-to-one correspondence between bilinear 
forms in X and bilinear forms in W^. 
Notice that the entries of the matrix B have two lower indices that sum with the 
indices of the coordinates of the vectors x, y that have upper indices. This also reminds 
us that B is not the matrix associated to a linear operator B related to B. In fact, if 
instead N is the associated linear operator to 6, 
bix.y) = (x\N{y)) 
V x , y € X , 
then 
y ^ B x - b(x,y) = {x\N{y)) = y ^ N ^ G x 
where we have denoted by G the Gram matrix associated to the inner product on X, 
G = [gij], gij — (ei|ej), and by N the n v. n matrix associated to A^ : X —^ X in the 
basis (ei, 62,..., en). Thus 
N ^ G = B 
or, recalling that G is symmetric and invertible, 
N = G - i B ^ . 

3.2 Metrics on Real Vector Spaces

b. Symmetric bilinear forms or metrics 
3.44 Definition. Let X be a real vector space. A bilinear form b G B{X) 
is said to be 
(i) symmetric or a metric, ifb{x^y) = b{y,x) Vx,?/ G X, 
(ii) antisymmetric ifb{x,y) 
= —b{y,x) ^x,y G X. 
The space of symmetric bilinear forms is denoted by Syra{X). 
3.45 %, Let b G B(X). 
Show that bs{x,y) 
:= ^{b{x,y) 
+ b{y,x)), 
x,y € X, is a sym-
metric bilinear form and bA{x,y) 
:— ^{b{x,y) 
— b{y,x)), x,y £ X, is an antisymmetric 
bilinear form. In particular, one has the natural decomposition 
6(x, y) = bs {x, y) + 6^ (x, y) 
of b into its symmetric 
and antisymmetric 
parts. Show that b is symmetric if and only 
if 6 = 65, and that b is antisymmetric if and only if 6 = 6^^. 
3.46 %. Let 6 G B(X) be a symmetric form, and let B be the associated Gram matrix. 
Show that 6 is symmetric if and only if B ^ = B. 
3.47 %, Let b e B(X) 
and let N be the associated linear operator, see (3.10). Show 
that AT is self-adjoint, N* = AT, if and only if 6 G Sym{X). 
Show that N* = -N 
if and 
only if b is antisymmetric. 
c. Sylvester's theorem 
3.48 Definition. Let X be a real vector space. We say that a metric on 
X, i.e., a bilinear symmetric form g : X x X ^^^R is 
(i) nondegenerate if^xeX,x^O 
there is y e X such that 6(x, y) ^ 0 
and Wy e Xy y y^ 0 there is x e X such that 6(x, y) j^ 0, 
(ii) positively definite ifb{x^x) > O'^x ^ X, x ^ 0, 
(iii) negatively definite ifb{x,x) 
< 0 \/x e X, x 
^0. 
3.49 %. Show that the scalar product {x\y) on X is a symmetric and nondegenerate 
bilinear form. We shall see later, Theorems 3.52 and 3.53, that any symmetric, nonde-
generate and positive bilinear form on a finite-dimensional space is actually an inner 
product. 
3.50 Definition. Let X be a vector space of dimension n and let g G 
Sym{X) 
be a metric on X. 
(i) We say that a basis (ei, e2,..., Cn) is g-orthogonal if g{ei,ej) = 0 
Vz,j = l,...,n, 
i^j. 
(ii) The radical of g is defined as the linear space 
md{g) := | x G X\g{x,y) 
= 0\fye 
x } . 
(iii) The range of the metric g is r{g) := n — dimrad^. 

98 
3. Euclidean and Hermitian Spaces 
Figure 3.3. Jorgen Gram (1850-1916) and James Joseph Sylvester (1814-1897). 
(iv) The signature of the metric g is the triplet of numbers 
{i^{g)J.{g),io{g)) 
where 
i^{g) := maximum of the dimensions of the subspaces V C X 
on which g is positive definite, g{v^v) > O^v EV, V ^^ 0, 
i-{g) := maximum of the dimensions of the subspaces V C X 
on which g is negative definite, g{v,v) <Oyv EV, V ^ 0, 
io{g) :=dimrad(5f). 
One immediately sees the following. 
3.51 Proposition. We have 
(i) The matrix associated to g in a basis (ei, e2, •.., e^) is diagonal if 
and only i/ (ei, 62,..., e^) is g-orthogonal, 
(ii) g is nondegenerate if and only if raid (g) = {0}, 
(iii) if G is the matrix associated to g in a basis, then x G rad g if and 
only if its coordinate vector belongs to ker G; thus r{g) = Rank G 
and g is nondegenerate if and only if G is not singular, 
(iv) if X is Euclidean and G G C{X, X) is the linear operator associated 
to g, by g{x,y) = {x\G{y)) \/x,y G X, then rad(G) = kerG, hence 
r{g) = RankG and g is nondegenerate if and only if G is invertible. 
3.52 Theorem (Sylvester). Let X be a finite-dimensional 
vector space 
and /e^ (ei, 62,..., en) 6e a g-orthogonal basis for a metric g on X. Denote 
by n-\.,n- 
and no the numbers of elements in the basis such that respec-
tively, we have g{ei,ei) > 0, g{ei,ei) < 0, g{ei^ei) = 0. Then n+ = 'i+id), 
u- = i-{g) and UQ = ioig)- In particular, n^., n_, no do not depend on the 
chosen g-orthogonal basis, 
i^{g) + i-{g) = r{g) 
and 
i+{g) + i-{g) + io{g) = n. 

3.2 Metrics on Real Vector Spaces 
99 
Proof. Suppose that g(ei,ei) 
> 0 for i = 1,..., n-j.. For each v = X^i^i '^^^i^ we have 
9{v,v) = Y^\v'\'^g{ei,ei) 
> 0, 
1 = 1 
hence dim Span {ei, 62,..., en^} < H ( P ) - On the other hand, if ly C X is a subspace 
of dimension i-^{g) such that g{v, i;) > 0 Vv € W, we have 
V y n S p a n { e n ^ + i , . . . , e n } = {0} 
since g{v,v) 
< 0 for all v G S p a n { e n , + i , . . . ,en}. Therefore we also have i-\-{g) < 
n — {n — n-|_) = n.^. 
Similarly, one proves that n_ = i-{g). 
Finally, since G := [^(ei,ej)] is the matrix 
associated to g in the basis (ei, 62,..., en), we have io{g) = dimrad(y) = dimkerG, 
and, since G is diagonal, dimkerG = UQ. 
D 
d. Existence of ^-orthogonal bases 
The Gram-Schmidt algorithm yields the existence of an orthonormal basis 
in a Euclidean space X. We now see that a slight modification of the Gram-
Schmidt algorithm allows us to construct in a finite-dimensional space a 
^-orthogonal basis for a given metric g. 
3.53 Theorem (Gram-Schmidt). Let g be a metric on a finite-dimen-
sional real vector space X. Then g has a g-orthogonal basis. 
Proof. Let r be the rank of gf, r := n—dimrcid (^), and let {wi, W2,. •., Wn-r) be a basis 
of rad (g). If V denotes a supplementary subspace of rad (^f), then V is p-orthogonal to 
radg and d i m F = r. Moreover, for every v £ V there is z £ X such that g{v, z) ^ 0. 
Decomposing zasz 
= w-\-t^wEV^t£ 
rad(^), we then have g{v,w) 
= g{v,w) 
+ 
g{v, t) = g(v, z) ^ 0, i.e., g is nondegenerate on V. Since trivially, (i^i, ii;2,..., 
Wn-r) 
is ^-orthogonal and V is ^-orthogonal to (i^i, 1^2, • • •, '^n-r)-, 
in order to conclude it 
suffices to complete the basis {w\^ W2,. - • -, Wn-r) 
with a ^f-orthogonal basis of V; in 
other words, it suffices to prove the claim under the further assumption that g be 
nondegenerate. 
We proceed by induction on the dimension of X. Let (/i, / 2 , . . . , /n) be a basis of 
X. We claim that there exists ei G X with g{ei,ei) 
/ 0. In fact, if for some fi we have 
gifiifi) 
7^ O5 we simply choose ei := /i, otherwise, if g{fi,fi) 
= 0 for all i, for some 
k ^ 0 we must have g{fi, fk) ¥" 0, since by assumption rad (g) = {0}. In this case, we 
choose ei := / i -|- /^ as 
g{fi + fkji + fk) = gifufi) + 2g{fiJk) -f gifkJk) = O + 2g{fiJk) + 0 / 0 . 
Now it is easily seen that the subspace 
Vi:=[vex\g{euv) 
= 0] 
supplements Span{ei}, and we find a basis (t'2, • • • ,^n) of Vi such that g{vj,ei) 
= 0 
for all j = 2 , . . . , n by setting 
. _ . 
fl(/j,ei) 
P(ei,ei) 
Since g is nondegenerate on Vi, by the induction assumption we find a p-orthogonal 
basis (e2,..., Cn) of Vi, and the vectors (ei, 62,..., Cn) form a p-orthogonal basis of 
X.

3. Euclidean and Hermitian Spaces 
A variant of the Gram-Schmidt procedure is the following one due to 
Carl Jacobi (1804-1851). 
Let g : X X X -^ R he Si metric on X. Let (/i, /2,. •., fn) be a 
basis of X, let G be the matrix associated to g in this basis, G = [gij], 
gij = 9{fu fj)- Set Ao = 1 and for A: = 1,..., n 
Ak :=detGA: 
where G^ is the k x k submatrix of the first k rows and k columns. 
3.54 Proposition (Jacobi). // A^ 7^ 0 for all k = 1,..., n, there exists 
a g-orthogonal basis (ei, 62,..., e^) of X; moreover 
g[ek,ek) := —7—. 
Proof. We look for a basis (ei, e2, •.., en) so that 
I ei 
=a\fi, 
62 = 0 2 / 1 +«2/2» 
or, equivalently, 
ek •=Yl^kfi^ 
k = l,..-,n, 
(3.11) 
as in the Gram-Schmidt procedure, such that g(ei,ej) 
= 0 for i ^ j . At first sight the 
system giei^ej) 
= 0, i :^ j , is a system in the unknowns aj.. However, if we impose that 
for all fc's 
p(efc,/i) = 0 
Vi = l , . . . , A ; - l , 
(3.12) 
by linearity g{ek,ei) 
= 0 for i < /c, and by symmetry gie^^ei) = 0 for i > k. It suffices 
then to fulfill (3.12) i.e., solve the system of fc — 1 equations in k unknowns al.,a^,...

(3.14)

we get a system of k equations in k unknowns of the type G^x = b, where Gk = [9ij]y 
9ij '•= gifiJj)^ 
X = (oj^,...,aj^)^ and b = (0,0,..., 1)^. Since det Gfc = Afc and 
Afc 7^ 0 by assumption, the system is solvable. Due to the arbitrarity of fc, we are able 
to find a gf-orthogonal basis of type (3.11). It remains to compute ^(6^,6^). Prom (3.13) 
and (3.14) we get 
9iek,ek) = Yl ^O'kOUiJj) = J2'^k{Y^9(fiJj)4)

3.55 Remark. Notice that Jacobi's method is a rewriting of the Gram-
Schmidt procedure in the case where g{fi^fi) 
7^ 0 for all i's. In terms of 
Gram's matrix G := [gi^i^ej)]^ we have also proved that 
T-GT = diag{^} 
for a suitable triangular matrix T. 
3.56 Corollary (Sylvester). Suppose that Ai,...,Afc ^ 0. Then the 
metric g is nondegenerate. Moreover, i-{g) equals the number of changes 
of sign in the sequence (1, Ai, A2,..., A^). In particular, if Ak > 0 for all 
k 's, then g is positive definite. 
Let (ei, 62,..., en) be a ^-orthogonal basis oi X. By reordering the 
basis in such a way that

e. Congruent matrices 
It is worth seeing now how the matrix associated to a bilinear form changes 
when we change bases. Let (ei, 62,..., Cn) and (/i, /2, • • •, fn) be two 
bases of X and let R be the matrix associated to the map R : X -^ X, 
R{ei) := fi in the basis (ei, 62,..., e^), that is 
R := [ri I r2 
where r^ is the column vector of the coordinates of fi in the basis 
(ei, 62,..., Cn)' As we know, if x and x' are the column vectors of the coor-
dinates of X respectively, in the basis (ei, 62,..., en) and (/i, /2, • • •, /n), 
then x = Rx'. Denote by B and B' the matrices associated to b respec-
tively, in the coordinates (ei, 62,..., e^) and (/i, /2,. • •, fn)- Then we 
have

3. Euclidean and Hermitian Spaces 
b{x,y) 
x'^BV 
T-DTJ 
hence 
b{x, y) = x^By = x" R^BRy' 
B' = R^BR. 
(3.15) 
The previous argument can be of course reversed. If (3.15) holds, then B 
and B' are the Gram matrices of the same metric h on W^ in different 
coordinates 
6(x,2/)=x^bV = (RxfB(Ry). 
3.57 Definition. Two matrices A,B G Mn^n{ 
if there exists a nonsingular matrix R E Mn,n{ 
are said to he congruent 
such that B = R^AR. 
It turns out that the congruence relation is an equivalence relation on 
matrices, thus the nxn 
matrices are partitioned into classes of congruent 
matrices. Since the matrices associated to a bilinear form in different basis 
are congruent, to any bilinear form corresponds a unique class of congruent 
matrices. 
The above then reads as saying that two matrices A, B G Mn,n{^) are 
congruent if and only if they represent the same bilinear form in different 
coordinates. Thus, the existence of a ^r-orthogonal basis is equivalent to 
the following. 
3.58 Theorem. A symmetric matrix A G Mn^n{ 
diagonal matrix. 
is congruent to a 
Moreover, Sylvester's theorem reads equivalently as the following. 
3.59 Theorem. Two diagonal matrices I, J G Mn,n(^) 
o,f^ congruent if 
and only if they have the same number of positive, negative and zero en-
tries in the diagonal. If, moreover, a symmetric matrix A G Mji_^ji{M^ is 
congruent to

then (a^b^n — a — b) is the signature of the metric y^Ax. 
Thus the existence of a ^-orthogonal matrix in conjunction with Sylvester's 
theorem reads as the following. 
3.60 Theorem. Two symmetric matrices A,B G Mn,nO^) o,re congruent 
if and only if the metrics y-^ Ax and y-^Bx on W^ have the same signature 
(a, 6, r). In this case, A and B are congruent to

f. Classification of real metrics 
Since reordering the basis elements is a linear change of coordinates, we 
can now reformulate Sylvester's theorem in conjunction with the existence 
of a ^-orthonormal basis as follows. Let X, Y be two real vector spaces, and 
let g, h be two metrics respectively, on X and Y. We say that {X,g) and 
(F, h) are isometric if and only if there is an isomorphism L : X —^ Y such 
that h{L{x),L{y)) 
= g{x^y) Wx,y G X. Observing that two metrics are 
isometric if and only if, in coordinates, their Gram matrices are congruent, 
from Theorem 3.60 we infer the following. 
3.61 Theorem. (X, g) and (y, h) are isometric if and only if g and h 
have the same signature, 
(hid) ^'^-{9)^0(9)) = (i+(/i),i_(/i),ioW). 
Moreover, if X has dimension n and the metric g on X has signature 
(a^b.r), a + b + r = n, then (X^g) is isometric to (lR^,/i) where /i(x,y) := 
x^Hy and 
H

According to the above, the metrics over a real finite-dimensional vector 
space X are classified, modulus isometrics, by their signature. Some of 
them have names: 
(i) The Euclidean metric: i-^{g) = n, i-{g) = io{g) — 0; in this case g is 
a scalar product. 
(ii) The pseudoeuclidean metrics: i-{g) = 0. 
(iii) The Lorenz metric or Minkowski metric: i-\-{g) = n — 1, i-{g) — 1, 
^o(^) = 0. 
(iv) The Artin metric i-\-{g) = i-{g) = P, ^o(p) = 0-
3.62 %. Show that a biUnear form ^ on a finite-dimensional space X is an inner product 
on X if and only if g is symmetric and positive definite.

3. Euclidean and Hermitian Spaces 
g. Quadratic forms 
Let X be a finite-dimensional vector space over M and let b G B{X) be 
a bilinear form on X. The quadratic form 0 : X ^ R associated to b is 
defined by 
0(x) = b{x,x)^ 
X e X. 
Observe that 0 is fixed only by the symmetric part of b 
bs{x,y) := 
-{b{x,y)-\-b{y,x)) 
since b{x, x) = bs{x, x) \fx G X. Moreover one can recover bs from (/) since 
bs is symmetric, 
bs{x, y) = 2 v^^ -^y)- 
^ W - ^(^)) • 
Another important relation between a bilinear form b G B{X) and its 
quadratic form 0 is the following. Let x and v £ X. Since 
(j){x -f- tv) = (f){x) + M b(x^ v) -f b{v, 
we have 
j^(t>{x + tv)^t=o = 2bs{x,v). 
(3.16) 
We refer to (3.16) saying that the symmetric part bs ofb is the first vari-
ation of the associated quadratic form. 
3.63 Homogeneous polynomials of degree two. Let B = [bij] € 
Mn,nW 
and let 
n 
6(x,y) := x^By = ^ 
bijx'y^ 
be the bilinear form defined by B on R*^, x = (x\ x^,..., x"), y = 
(y\ ?/2,..., 2/^). Clearly, 
n 
(/)(x) = 6(x, x) = x^Bx = ^ 
bijx'^x^ 
is a homogeneous polynomial of degree two. Conversely, any homogeneous 
polynomial of degree two 
P{x) = ^ 
bijx'x^ = x^Bx 
i , j = l , n 
i<3 
defines a unique symmetric bilinear form in W^ by 
6 ( x , y ) : = ^ ( p ( x + y ) - P ( x ) - P ( y ) ) 
with associated quadratic form P.

3.65 Derivatives of a quadratic form. Prom (3.16) we can compute the partial 
derivatives of the quadratic form (f){x) := x ^ G y . In fact, choosing u = e^, we have 
-^{x) 
:= -(t>{x + teh) = 2bs(x,eh) 
= x ^ ( G + G^)e^

we have 
D</>(a;)=x^(G-hG^), 
or, taking the transpose, 
V(/)(x) := (D</)(x))^ = (G + G^)x. 
h. Reducing to a sum of squares 
Let ^ be a metric on a real vector space X of dimension n and let (j) be 
the associated quadratic form. Then, choosing a basis (ei, 62,..., en) we 
have 
(t){x) = g{x,x) = 
^{x'fg[euei) 
2 = 1 
if and only if (ei, 62,..., e^) is ^-orthogonal, and the number of positive, 
negative and zero coefficients is the signature of g. Thus, Sylvester's the-
orem in conjunction with the fact that we can always find a ^-orthogonal 
basis can be rephrased as follows. 
3.66 Theorem (Sylvester's law of inertia). Let (j){x) = g{x,x) be the 
quadratic form associated to a metric g on an n-dimensional real vector 
space. 
(i) There exists a basis (/i, / 2 , . . . , fn) of X such that 
2 = 1 
2 = 1 
2 = 1 
where {i^{g),i-{g),io{g)) 
is the signature of g.

(3.17) 
then the numbers n^^n^ andno respectively, of positive, negative and 
zero ^{ei)^s are the signature {i^{g),i-{g),io{g)) 
of g. 
3.67 Example. In order to reduce a quadratic form cf) to the canonical form (3.17), we 
may use Gram-Schmidt's algorithm. Let us repeat it focusing this time on the change 
of coordinates instead of on the change of basis. Suppose we want to reduce to a sum 
of squares by changing coordinates, the quadratic form 
n 
where at least one of the aij 's is not zero. We first look for a coefficient akk that is not 
zero. If we find it, we go further, otherwise if all akk vanish, at least one of the mixed 
terms, say ai2, is nonzero; the change of variables 
x^ = i / i -f-2/2, 
yx^ = y^ 
for j = 3 , . . . , n, 
transforms ai2X^x'^ into ai2{(y^)'^ — (y^)^), and since a n = 022 = 0, in the new 
coordinates (y^, j / ^ , . . . , y^) the coefficient of (y^)^ is not zero. Thus, possibly after a 
linear change of variables, we write 0 as 
^(x) = — ( a n j / i ) 2 + y ^ azjyiyJ + B(s/2,..., J/").

consequently, P into 
ax^ + bxy + cy^ = pX"^ + g^^, 
pX'^ + qY'^ + 2rX + 2sy + / = 0. 
Now we can classify the conies in terms of the signs of p, q and / . If p, q are zero, 
the conic reduces to the straight line 
2rX + 2sy + / = 0. 
If p 7»^ 0 and g == 0, then, completing the square, the conic becomes 
p{X - Xof 
+ 25y -f / = 0, 
Xo = - , 
i.e., a parabola with vertex in (Xo,0) and axis parallel to the axis of Y. Similarly, if 
p = 0 and q ^ 0, the conic is a parabola with vertex in {0,Yo), YQ := s/q, and axis 
parallel to the X axis. Finally, if pq ^ 0, completing the square, the conic is 
p{X - Xo? -h q{Y - Yof + / = 0, 
Xo= 
r/p, 
FQ = s/q, 
i.e., it is 
o a hyperbola if / 7^ 0 and pg < 0, 
o two straight lines if / = 0 and pg < 0, 
o an ellipse if sgn (/) = —sgn (p) and pq > 0, 
o a point if / = 0 and pq > 0, 
o the empty set if sgn (/) = sgn (p) and pq > 0. 
Since we have operated with linear changes of coordinates that map straight lines into 
straight lines, ellipses into ellipses, and hyperbolas into hyperbolas, we conclude the 
following. 
3.70 Proposition. The conies in the plane are classified in terms of the signature of 
their quadratic part and of the sign of the zero term.

variables, see Figure 3.4 for n — 3, has the form

where A G Mn,n{R) is symmetric, h ^ X and c ^R. 
Prove the following claims, 
(i) 0 is a center of symmetry, 
i.e., </)(x) = </>(—x), if and only if b = 0. 
(ii) xo is a center of symmetry, i.e., 0(xo — x) = </)(xo + x), if and only if AXQ = —b. 
(iii) If det A 7^ 0, then there is a center of symmetry XQ; letting x = z + XQ, we have 
(f)(x.) = z^ Az -f ci = 0 for a suitable ci 6 M.

of coordinates into

4. Self-Adjoint Operators 
In this chapter, we deal with self-adjoint operators on a Euclidean or Her-
mitian space, and, more precisely, with the spectral theory for self-adjoint 
and normal operators. In the last section, we shall see methods and results 
of linear algebra at work on some specific examples and problems. 
4.1 Elements of Spectral Theory 
4.1.1 Self-adjoint operators 
a. Self-adjoint operators 
4.1 Definition. Let X be a Euclidean or Hermitian space X. A linear 
operator A : X -^ X is called self-adjoint if A* = A. 
As we can see, if A is the matrix associated to A in an orthonormal 
basis, then A^ and A 
are the matrices associated to A* in the same 
basis according to whether X is Euclidean or Hermitian. In particular, A 
is self-adjoint if and only if A = A"^ in the Euclidean case and A = A^ 
in the Hermitian case. 
Moreover, as a consequence of the alternative theorem we have 
X = ker A 0 Im A, 
ker A 
±lmA 
ii A : X -^ X is self-adjoint. Finally, notice that the space of self-adjoint 
operators is a subalgebra of £(X, X). Typical examples of self-adjoint op-
erators are the orthogonal projection operators. In fact, we have the fol-
lowing. 
4.2 Proposition. Let X be a Euclidean or Hermitian space and let P : 
X -^ X be a linear operator. P is the orthogonal projection onto its image 
if and only if P* = P and P o P = P. 

112 
4. Self-Adjoint Operators 
Proof. This follows, for instance, from 3.32. Here we present a more direct proof. 
Suppose P is the orthogonal projection onto its image. Then for every y € X 
{y~P{y)\z) 
= 0 V2 € I m P . Thus y = P{y) if y € I m P , that is P{x) = PoP(a:) = P'^{x) 
Vx G X. Moreover, for x,y E X 
0 = (a; - P{x)\P{y)) 
= (x\P{y)) - 
(P{x)\P(y)), 
0 = (P{x)\y - P(y)) = (P(x)\y) - 
(P(x)\P{y)), 
hence, 
{P{x)\y) = (x|P(j/)), 
i.e., 
P* = P. 
Conversely, if P* = P and P^^ = P we have 
{x - P{x)\Piz)) 
= {P*(x - P{x))\z) 
= (P{x) - P''(x)\z) 
= (P(x) - P{x)\z) = 0 
for all z^X. 
D 
b. The spectral theorem 
The following theorem, as we shall see, yields a characterization of the 
self-adjoint operators. 
4.3 Theorem (Spectral theoremi). Let A : X -^ X be a self-adjoint 
operator on the Euclidean or Hermitian space X. Then X has an orthonor-
mal basis made of eigenvectors of X. 
In order to prove Theorem 4.3 let us first state the following. 
4.4 Proposition. Under the hypothesis of Theorem 4-3 we have 
(i) A has n real eigenvalues, if counted with multiplicity, 
(ii) ifV CW^ is an invariant subspace under A, then V-^ is also invariant 
under A, 
(iii) eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. 
Proof, (i) Assume X is Hermitian and let A € Mn,n(^) 
be the matrix associated to A 
in an orthonormal basis. Then A = A''", and A has n complex eigenvalues, if counted 
with multiplicity. Let z 6 C"^ be an eigenvector with eigenvalue A G C. Then 
Az = Az = Az = A z. 
Consequently, if A = (a*), z = (z^, z"^,..., 
z^), we have 
1 A|z|2 = Er=i A z* z* = E«"=i ^' A? = E«",,=i "5 ^^ ^\ = E",=i 4 ^' ^'-
Since a* = a^ for alH, j = 1,..., n, we conclude that 
( A - A ) | z p = 0 
i.e., 
A G M . 
In the Euclidean case, A ^ = A = A, also. 
(ii) Let w € V^. For every v £ V -we have {A{'w)\v) = (w\A{v)) = 0 since A{v) G V 
and w eV-^. Thus A{w) ± V. 
(iii) Let x, y be eigenvectors of A with eigenvalues A, /x, respectively. Then A and /x are 
real and 
(A - ^i){x\y) = iXx\y) - {x\ny) = (A(x)\y) - {x\A{y)) = 0. 
Thus (x\y) = 0 if A 5^ ^. 
D 

4.1 Elements of Spectral Theory 
113 
Proof of Theorem 4-3. We proceed by induction on the dimension n oi X. On account 
of Proposition 4.4 (i), the claim trivially holds if dimX = 1. Suppose the theorem has 
been proved for all self-adjoint operators on H when dim H = n — 1 and let us prove it 
for A. Because of (i) Proposition 4.4, all eigenvalues of A are real, hence there exists at 
least an eigenvector ui of A with norm one. Let H := Span {txi}"*" and let B := A^fj be 
the restriction of A to H. Because of (ii) Proposition 4.4, B{H) C H, hence B \ H ^^ H 
is a linear operator on H (whose dimension is n — 1); moreover, B is self-adjoint, since 
it is the restriction to a subspace of a self-adjoint operator. Therefore, by the inductive 
assumption, there is an orthonormal basis {u2^... ,Un) oi H made by eigenvectors of B, 
hence of A. Since U2,... ,Un are orthogonal to ui, (txi, W2, • • •, ttn) is an orthonormal 
basis of X made by eigenvectors of ^ . 
• 
The next proposition expresses the existence of an orthonormal basis 
of eigenvectors in several diflFerent ways, see Theorem 2.45. We leave its 
simple proof to the reader. 
4.5 Proposition. Let A : X ^^ X be a linear operator on a Euclidean or 
Hermitian space X of dimension n. Let (wi, U2, • • •, Un) be a basis of X 
and let Xi^ A2,..., An be real numbers. The following claims are equivalent 
(i) (lAi, 1^2, •. •, Un) is an orthonormal basis of X and each Uj is an eigen-
vector of A with eigenvalue Xj, i.e., 
A{uj) = XjUj, 
(^il'^j) = ^ij 
Vi, j = 1,..., n, 
(ii) {ui, U2',..., Un) is an orthonormal basis and 
n 
J = l 
(iii) (lii, 1/2,..., Un) is an orthonormal basis and for all x^y £ X 
(A(x)\y) = / ^ ^ = i ^ji^M 
(y\^j) 
^f^ ^^ Euclidean, 
IX]?= 1 ^3i^Wj) iy\%•) if X is Hermitian. 
Moreover, we have the following, compare with Theorem 2.45. 
4.6 Proposition. Let A : X —^ X be a self-adjoint operator in a Euclid-
ean or Hermitian space X of dimension n and let A € Mn^n{^) be the 
matrix associated to A in a given orthonormal basis. Then A is similar to 
a diagonal matrix. More precisely, let {ui, 1*2,..., Un) be a basis of X of 
eigenvectors of A, /et Ai, A2,.. •, An E M be the corresponding eigenvalues 
and let S G Mn,n{^) be the matrix that has the n-tuple of components of 
Ui in the given orthonormal basis as the ith column. 
Ur, 
S : = 
Ui U2 
Then 
S^S = Id 
and 
S^AS = diag (Ai, A2,..., An) 

114 
4. Self-Adjoint Operators 
if X is Euclidean, and 
S^S = Id 
and 
S^AS = diag (Ai, A2,..., A^). 
if X is Hermitian. 
Proof. Since the columns of S are orthonormal, it follows that S^S = Id if X is Euclid-
—T 
ean or S S = Id if X is Hermitian. The rest of the proof is contained in Theorem 2.45. 
D 
c. Spectral resolution 
Let A : X —^ X he 3. self-adjoint operator on a Euclidean or Hermitian 
space X of dimension n, let (i^i, 1*2,..., Un) be an orthonormal basis of 
eigenvectors of A, let Ai, A2,..., A^; be the distinct eigenvalues of A and 
Vi, V2,..., Vk the corresponding eigenspaces. Let Pi : X -^ Vi he the 
projector on Vi so that 
UjEVi 
and by (ii) Proposition 4.4 
k 
A{x) = J2XiPi{x). 
i=l 
As we have seen, by (iii) Proposition 4.4, we have Vi L Vj ii i •=^ j 
and, by the spectral theorem, Y2i=i dimV^ = n. In other words, we can 
say that {Vi}i is a decomposition of X in orthogonal subspaces or state 
the following. 
4.7 Theorem. Let A : X -^ X be self-adjoint on a Euclidean or Hermi-
tian space X of dimension n. Then there exists a unique family of projec-
tors Pi, P25. • • 5 Pk CL'^d distinct real numbers Ai, A2,. •., A^^ such that 
k 
k 
p. o Pj = 6ijPj, 
^ Pi = Id 
and A = ^ 
XiPi. 
Finally, we can easily complete the spectral theorem as follows. 
4.8 Proposition. Let X be a Euclidean or Hermitian space. A linear 
opertor A : X -^ X is self-adjoint if and only if the eigenvalues of A are 
real and there exists an orthonormal basis of X made of eigenvectors of A. 

4.1 Elements of Spectral Theory 
115 
d. Quadratic forms 
To a self-adjoint operator A : X —^ X we may associate the bilinear form 
a:X 
xX 
^K, 
a{x,y) := {A{x)\y), 
x,y e X, 
which is symmetric if X is EucUdean and sesquilinear^ tt(^?y) = o.{y^x)^ if 
X is Hermitian. 
4.9 Theorem. Let A : X —^ X be a self-adjoint operator, (ei, e2, •.., e^) 
an orthonormal basis of X of eigenvectors of A and Ai, A2,. •., A^ be the 
corresponding eigenvalues. Then 
n 
{A{x)\x) =Y.Xi\{x\ei)f 
Vx e X, 
(4.1) 
2 = 1 
In particular, if Amin ^nd Amax CiT'e respectively, the smallest and largest 
eigenvalues of A, then 
Aminkl^ < {A{x)\x) 
< A max 1^1 
Vx G X. 
Moreover, we have {A{x)\x) = Amin |^P (resp. {A{x)\x) = Amax kPy^ if 
and only if x is an eigenvector with eigenvalue Amin (resp. Xmax)-
Proof. Proposition 4.5 yields (4.1) hence 
n 
n 
i=l 
2=1 
and, since l^p = J27=i l(^ki)P ^^ G X, the first part of the claim is proved. 
Let us prove that {A(x)\x) 
= Amin 12^ P if and only if x is an eigenvector with 
eigenvalue Amin- If x is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue Amin) then A{x) = Amin 2: 
hence {A{x)\x) = (Amin^:^!^) = Amin k p . Conversely, suppose (ei, 62,..., Cn) is a basis 
of X made by eigenvectors of A and the eigenspace Vx^-^^ is spanned by (ei, 62,..., e^). 
Prom {A(x)\x) = AminkP^ we infer that 
n 
0 = iA(x)\x) 
- A m i n k P = E ( ^ ^ - 
^min)|(x|ei)P 
i = l 
and, as AjAmin ^ 0, we get that (x|ei) = 0 Vz > A:, thus x G V\^.^. 
We proceed similarly for Amax. 
D 
All eigenvalues can, in fact, be characterized as in Theorem 4.9. Let us 
order the eigenvalues, counted with their multiplicity, as 
Ai < A2 < • • • < An 
and let (ei, e2,..., en) be an orthonormal basis of corresponding eigen-
vectors (ei, 62,..., en), A{ei) = XiCi Vz = 1,..., n; finally, set 
Vk := Span{ei, e2,..., e^}, 
Wk := {efc,efc+i,... ,en}. 

116 
4. Self-Adjoint Operators 
Since T4, Wk are invariant subspaces under A and Vj^ = Wk-\-i, by apply-
ing Theorem 4.9 to the restriction of {A{x)\x) on 14 and VF^, we find 
Ai = mm{A{x)\x), 
(4.2) 
1x1=1 
Xk = max< {A{x)\x) 
|x| = 1, x G Vjt > 
= min< {A{x)\x) 
|a:| = 1, x e Wk \ 
if A: = 2,..., n — 1, 
An = max(A(x)|x). 
kl=i 
Moreover, if 5 is a subspace of dimension n—fc-fl, we have 5014 ¥" {0}? 
then there is XQ ^ S ilVk with |a;o| = 1; thus 
min|(A(x)|x) |x| = 1, x e s\ < {A{xo)\xo) 
< max< {A{x)\x) 
|x| = 1, x eVk\ 
= Xk-
Since dim W4 = n — k -\-1 and mmxeWk{^{^)\^) 
= A^, we conclude with 
the min-max characterization of eigenvalues that makes no reference to 
eigenvectors. 
4.10 Proposition (Courant). Let A he a self-adjoint operator on a 
Euclidean or Hermitian space X of dimension n and let Xi < X2 < - - - < 
Xn be the eigenvalues of A in nondecreasing order and counted with mul-
tiplicity. Then 
Xk =

4.11 A variational algorithm for the eigenvectors. Prom (4.2) we 
know that 
Afc :=min{(A(x)|x)| |x| = 1, x G 14-^1}, 
A: = l . . . , n , 
(4.3) 
where F_i = {0}. This yields an iterative procedure to compute the eigen-
values of A. For j = 1 define 
Ai = 
m.m{A{x)\x), 
kl=i 
and for j = 1,..., n — 1 set 
Vj := eigenspace of Aj, 
Aj+i := min< {A{x)\x) | |x| = 1, x e Wj >. 

4.1 Elements of Spectral Theory 
117 
Notice that such an algorithm yields an alternative proof of the spectral 
theorem. We shall see in Chapter 10 that this procedure extends to certain 
classes of self-adjoint operators in infinite-dimensional spaces. 
Finally, notice that Sylvester's theorem, Gram-Schmidt's procedure or 
the other variants for reducing a quadratic form to a canonical form, see 
Chapter 3, allow us to find the numbers of positive, negative and null 
eigenvalues (with multiplicity) without computing them explicitly. 
e. Positive operators 
A self-adjoint operator A : X -^ X is called positive (resp. nonnegative) 
if the quadratic form (j){x) := (Ax|x) is positive for x ^ 0 (resp. nonnega-
tive). Prom the results about metrics, see Corollary 3.56, or directly from 
Theorem 4.9, we have the following. 
4.12 Proposition. Let A: X ^^ X be self-adjoint. A is positive (nonneg-
ative) if and only if all eigenvalues of A are positive (nonnegative) or iff 
there is X> 0 (X>0) 
such that {Ax\x) > A|xp. 
4.13 Corollary. A : X ^^ X is positive self-adjoint if and only if 
a{x,y) = {A{x)\y) is an inner (Hermitian) product on X. 
4.14 Proposition (Simultaneous diagonalization). Let A^M : X ^>-
X be linear self-adjoint operators on X. Suppose M is positive. Then there 
exists a basis (ei, e2,..., e^) of X and real numbers Ai, A2,..., An such 
that 
{M{ei)\ej) = 6ij, 
A{ej) = XjMcj \/iJ = 1,... ,n. 
(4.4) 
Proof. The metric g{x,y) 
:= (M(x)\y) 
is a scalar (Hermitian) product on X and the 
Unear operator M~^A 
: X —> X is self-adjoint with respect to g since 
g{M-^A{x),y) 
= {MM-''A(x)\y) 
= {A{x)\y) = 
{x\A{y)) 
= {x\MM-'^A(y)) 
= (Mx\M-'^A(y)) 
= 
g{x,M-'^A{y)). 
Therefore, M~^A 
has real eigenvalues and, by the spectral theorem, there is a g-
orthonormal basis of X made of eigenvectors of M~^A, 
g{ei,ej) 
= {M{ei)\ej) 
= Sij, 
M~^A(ej) 
= XjCj \/i,j = 1,... ,n. 
4.15 Remark. We cannot drop the positivity assumption in Proposi-
tion 4.14. For instance, if 
we have det(AId — M~^A) = A^ + 1, hence M~^A has no real eigenvalue. 

118 
4. Self-Adjoint Operators 
4.16 %. Show the following. 
Proposition. Let X be a Euclidean space and let g,b : X x X —^R be two metrics on 
X. Suppose g is positive. Then there exists a basis of X that is both g-orthogonal 
and 
b-orthogonal. 
4.17 ^. Let A,M 
be linear self-adjoint operators and let M be positive. Then 
M~^A 
is self-adjoint with respect to the inner product g{x,y) 
:= (M{x)\y). 
Show that the 
eigenvalues Ai, A2, • •., An of M~^^A are iteratively given by 
Ai = 
min 
g{M

[Xj+1 := mm{{A{x)\x)

where V-*- denotes the orthogonal to V with respect to the inner product g. 
4.18 f. Show the following. 
Proposition. Let T be a linear operator on K^. IfT-\-T* 
is positive 
(nonnegative), 
then all eigenvalues of T have positive (nonnegative) 
real part. 
f. The operators A* A and A A* 
Let A : X -^Y he Si linear operator between X and Y that we assume are 
either both Euclidean or both Hermitian. Prom now on we shall write Ax 
instead of A{x) for the sake of simplicity. As usual, A* : Y ^ X denotes 
the adjoint of A. 
4.19 Proposition. The operator A* A : X -^ X is 
(i) self-adjoint, 
(ii) nonnegative, 
(iii) Ax, A*Ax and {A*Ax\x) are all nonzero or all zero, in particular 
A* A is positive if and only if A is infective, 
(iv) if ui^ i/2,..., Un are eigenvectors of A* A respectively, with eigenval-
ues Ai, A2,..., An; then 
{Aui\Auj) = 
\i{ui\uj), 
in particular, if ui, U2,. -., Un are orthogonal to each other, then 
Au\,..., 
Aun are orthogonal to each other as well. 
Proof 
(i) In fact, {A*A)* = A*A** = A*A. 
(ii) and (iii) If Ax = 0, then trivially A*Ax = 0, and if A*Ax = 0, then (A*Ax\x) 
= 0. 
On the other hand, {A*Ax\x) 
= {Ax\Ax) 
= | ^ x p hence Ax = 0 if (A*Ax\x) 
= 0. 
(iv) In fact, {Aui\Auj) 
= {A*Aui\uj) 
= \i{ui\uj) 
= Xi\ui\'^Sij. 
D 

4.1 Elements of Spectral Theory

4.20 Proposition. The operator A A* :Y ^^Y 
is 
(i) 
self'adjoint, 
(ii) nonnegative, 
(iii) A*x, AA*x and {AA*x\x) are either all nonzero or all zero, in par-
ticular AA* is positive if and only if ker A* = {0}, equivalently if and 
only if A is surjective. 
(iv) if ui, U2j' >., Un are eigenvectors of AA"^ with eigenvalues respec-
tively, Ai, A2,..., Xny then 
{A''ui\A*Uj) = Xi{ui\uj), 
in particular, if ui, U2,.. - ^ Un are orthogonal to each other, then 
A*ui^..., 
A*Un are orthogonal to each other as well 
Moreover, A A* and A* A have the same nonzero eigenvalues and 
Rank^Tl* = R a n k ^ M = Rank A = Rank A*. 
In particular, Rank A A* = Rank A* A < min(dim X, dim F). 
Proof. The claims (i) (ii) (iii) and (iv) are proved as in Proposition 4.19. 
To prove that A* A and A A* have the same nonzero eigenvalues, notice that if 
X € A", x 7«^ 0, is an eigenvalue for A*A with eigenvalue A 7^ 0, A*Ax 
= Xx, then 
Ax 7^ 0 by (iii) Proposition 4.19 and AA*{Ax) 
= A{A*Ax) 
= A{Xx) = XAx, i.e., Ax is 
a nonzero eigenvector for A A* with the same eigenvalue A. Similarly, one proves that if 
2/ 7^ 0 is an eigenvector for A A* with eigenvalue X ^ 0, then by (iii) A*y ^ 0 and A*y 
is an eigenvector for A* A with eigenvalue A. 
Finally, from the alternative theorem, we have 
Rank A A* = Rank A* = Rank A = Rank A M . 
g. Powers of a self-adjoint operator

positive. 
The operator B such that B'^^ = A \s called the 2A;th root of A and is 
denoted by ^ \ / A .

Uniqueness remains to be shown. Suppose B and C are self-adjoint, nonnegative 
and such that A = B"^^ = C^'^. Then B and C have the same eigenvalues and the same

4.27 Proposition. Under the hypoteses of Theorem 4-26, we have 
(i) A and B have a common nonzero eigenvector, 
(ii) if V is invariant under A and B, then V-^ is invariant under A and

Proof, (i) Let A be an eigenvalue of A and let V\ be the corresponding eigenspace. For 
all y € Vx we have ABy = BAy = XBy, i.e., By G V^. Thus V^ is invariant under B, 
consequently, there is an eigenvector w £ Vx oi B^y^, i.e., common to A and B. 
(ii) For every w G V-^ and z £ V, we have Az,Bz 
G V and {Aw\z) = {w\Az) = 0, 
{Bw\z) = {w\Bz) = 0, i.e.. Aw, Bw eV-^.

4.28 %. Show that two symmetric matrices A, B are simultaneously diagonizable if 
and only if they commute A B = BA. 
b. Normal operators on Hermitian spaces 
A linear operator on a Euclidean or Hermitian space is called normal if 
NN* = N*N. Of course, if we fix an orthonormal basis in X, we may 
represent N with an n x n matrix N 6 Mn,n(C) and N is normal if and 
only if N N ^ = N ^ N if X is Hermitian or N N ^ = N ^ N if X is Euclidean. 
The class of normal operators, though not trivial from the algebraic 
point of view (it is not closed for the operations of sum and composi-
tion), is interesting as it contains several families of important operators as 
subclasses. For instance, self-adjoint operators A^ = A^*, anti-self-adjoint 
operators N* = —N, and isometric operators, N*N = Id, are normal 
operators. 
Moreover, normal operators in a Hermitian space are exactly the ones 
that are diagonizable. In fact, we have the following. 

122 
4. Self-Adjoint Operators 
4.29 Theorem (Spectral theorem). Let X be a Hermitian space of di-
mension n and let N : X -^ X he a linear operator. Then N is normal if 
and only if there exists an orthonormal basis of X made by eigenvectors 
ofN. 
Proof. Let (ei, 62,..., Cn) be an orthonormal basis of X made by eigenvectors of N. 
Then for every z £ X

It is easily seen that A and B are self-adjoint and commute. Theorem 4.26 then yields 
a basis of orthonormal eigenvectors of A and B and therefore of eigenvectors oi N := 
A+ iB and N* = A- iB. 
D 
4.30 1. Show that AT : C"^ -^ C"^ is normal if and only if N and N* have the same 
eigenspaces. 
c. Normal operators on Euclidean spaces 
Let us translate the information contained in the spectral theorem for 
normal operators on Hermitian spaces into information about normal op-
erators on Euclidean spaces. In order to do that, let us first make a few 
remarks. 
As usual, in C^ we write z — x+iy, x,y EW^ for z — {x\ -\-iyi,..., 
Xn + 
iyn)' If VF is a subspace of W^, the subspace of C"^ 
WeiW

is called the complexified ofW. Trivially, A\mc{W®iW) 
= dim^ W. Also, 
if F is a subspace of C^, set 
V : = { Z G C ^ | Z G F } . 
4.31 Lemma. A_subspace V C C^ is the complexified of a real subspace 
W if and only ifV = V.

4.1 Elements of Spectral Theory 
123 
For N : M^ ^ W^ we define its complexified as the (complex) linear 
operator Nc : C -^ C defined by Nc{z) := Nx + iNy iiz = x-\-iy. Then 
we easily see that 
(i) A is an eigenvalue of N if and only if A is an eigenvalue of Nc^ 
(ii) N is respectively, a self-adjoint, anti-self-adjoint, isometric or normal 
operator if and only if Nc is respectively, a self-adjoint, anti-self-
adjoint, isometric or normal operator on C"^, 
(iii) the eigenvalues of N are either real, or pairwise complex conjugate; 
in the latter case the conjugate eigenvalues A and A have the same 
multiplicity. 
4.32 Proposition. Let N : W^ ^^ W^ be a normal operator. Every real 
eigenvalue \ of N of multiplicity k has an eigenspace Vx of dimension k. 
In particular, V\ has an orthonormal basis made of eigenvectors. 
Proof. Let A be a real eigenvalue for NQ, NQZ = Xz. We have 
NQZ — Nx - iNy = N^z = Xz = Xz, 
i.e., z € C^ is an eigenvector of N^ with eigenvalue A if and only if 'z is also an 
eigenvector with eigenvalue A. The eigenspace Ex of Nc relative to A is then closed 
under conjugation and by Lemma 4.31 Ex '•= Wx © iWx, where 
Wx:={xeR''\x=^, 
zeEx],

and dimR Wx — dime ^x • Since N^ is diagonizable in C and W\ C VA ? we have 
k — dime Ex = dim Wx < dimR V^. 
As dimV^ ^ k, see Proposition 2.43, the claim follows. 
D 
4.33 Proposition. Let X be a nonreal eigenvalue of the normal operator 
N :W^ —^W^ with multiplicity k. Then there exist k planes of dimension 
2 that are invariant under N. More precisely, i/ei, e2,..., en G C"^ are k 
orthonormal eigenvectors that span the eigenspace Ex of Nc relative to A 
and we set

N{u2j) = /3u2j-i + au2j 
where X=: a-\- i/3. 
Proof. Let Ex, Ej be the eigenspax:es of Nc relative to A and A. Since Nc is diagonizable 
on C, then 
dime ^A = dime -^X ~ ^'

Therefore, z ^ Ex'ii and only if 2 G E-^. The complex subspgice F\ := Ex®Ej

dimR Wx = dime E = 2k. 
(4.7) 
If (ei, 62,..., efc) is an orthonormal basis of Ex, (ei, 62,..., e^) is an orthonormal 
basis of Ej; since

V ^ e j = : U2j-1

Observing that the eigenspaces of the real eigenvalues and the eigen-
spaces of the complex conjugate eigenvectors are pairwise orthogonal, from 
Propositions 4.32 and 4.33 we infer the following. 
4.34 Theorem. Let N be a normal operator on M.^. Then R^ is the di-
rect sum of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional subspaces that are pairwise 
orthogonal and invariant under N. In other words, there is an orthonormal

4.1.3 Some representation formulas 
a. The operator A* A 
Let yl: X —> y be a linear operator between two Euclidean spaces or two 
Hermitian spaces and let ^* : y ^' X be its adjoint. As we have seen, 
yl*A : X —> X is self-adjoint, nonnegative and can be written as 
n 
A" Ax = 
Y^Xi{x\ei)ei 
2 = 1 
where (ei, 62,..., Cn) is a basis of X made of eigenvectors of A*A and for 
each 2 = 1,... ,n Ai is the eigenvalue relative to e^; accordingly, we also 
have 
{A*Ay^^x := ^ 
fJ.i{x\ei) e^. 
2 = 1 
where /Xi := ^/Xi. The operator (A*A)^/^ and its eigenvalues /ii,... ,/Xn, 
called the singular values of A, play an important role in the description 
of A 
4.37 f. Let A G Mm,n{^)' 
Show that ||A|| := sup|a.|^i |Ax| is the greatest singular 
value of A. [Hint: |Axp = (A* Ax) •x .] 
4.38 Theorem (Polar decomposition). Let A : X ^^Y be an operator 
between two Euclidean or two Hermitian spaces. 
(i) If dimX 
< dimy, then there exists an isometry U : X -^ Y, i.e., 
tf'U = Id, such that 
Moreover, if A = US with f/*C/ = Id and S* = S, then S = (A* A)^/^ 
and U is uniquely defined on ker S-^ = ker A-^. 
(ii) If dimX 
> dim.Y, then there exists an isometry U : Y ^y X, i.e., 
U*U = Id such that 
A = 
{AA*y^^U\ 
Moreover, ifA = SU with U*U = Id and 5* = S, then S = {AA*)^^'^ 
and U is uniquely defined on ker 5-^ = Im^. 
Proof. Let us show (i). Set n := dimX and N := d i m y . First let us prove uniqueness. 
If A = 175 where U*U = Id and 5* = S, then A*A = S*U*US 
= S*S = ^2, i.e., 
S = (A*A)i/2. Now from A = U(A*A)^/^, 
we infer for i = 1,... ,n 
Aid)

fiiU{ei), 
if (ei, 62,..., en) is an orthonormal basis of X of eigenvectors of {A*A)^^^ with relative 
eigenvalues ^ 1 , /JL2, . • •, /Xn- Hence, U(ei) = —A(ei) 
if/Ltj ^ 0, i.e., U is uniquely defined 
by A on the direct sum of the eigenspaces relative to nonzero eigenvalues of (A* A)^/^, 
that is, on the orthogonal of ker(A*A)^/2 = ker A. 
Now we shall exhibit U. The vectors A{ei),..., 
A{en) are orthogonal and |A(ei)| = 
Mi as

4. Self-Adjoint Operators 
{A{ei)\A{ej)) 
= {A*A{ei)\ej) 
= fJLi{ei\ej) = f^i6ij. 
Let us reorder the eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues in such a way that 
for some k, 1 < k < n, the vectors A{ei),..., 
A{ek) are not zero and A(ek-\-i) = - • - = 
A{en) = 0. For i = 1,..., A: we set i;i := , .r^^ and we complete t;i, t;2,..., ^^fc to form 
a new orthonormal basis (vi^ V2,-.., 
VN) oiY. 
Now consider U : X -^Y 
defined by 
U(ei) :=Vi 
i=l,...,n. 
By construction {U{ei)\U{ej)) 
— Sij, i.e., U*U = Id, and, since fXi = \A{ei)\ = 0 for 
i > k, we conclude for every i = 1,... 
,n 
I yrt^t;^ = Ovi = 0 
if k < i < n 
(ii) follows by applying (i) to ^*. 
D 
b. Singular value decomposition 
Combining polar decomposition and the spectral theorem we deduce the 
so-called singular value decomposition of a matrix A. We discuss only 
the real case, since the complex one requires only a few straightforward 
changes. Let A G MM,nW with n < N. The polar decomposition yields 
A = U(A^A)i/2 
^i^j^ 
u T u _ j j 
On the other hand, since A-^A is symmetric, the spectral theorem yields 
S e Mn.nW 
such that 
(A^A)i/2 = S^diag(/ii, /i2,..., /in)S, 
S^S = Id, 
where /ii, /X25 • • •, /^n are the squares of the singular values of A. Recall 
that the ith column of S is the eigenvector of (A*A)^/^ relative to the 
eigenvalue fii. 
In conclusion, if we set T := US^ G MNA^), 
then T^T = Id, 
S^S = Id and 
A = Tdiag(/ii, /i2,..., /in)S. 
This is the singular value decomposition of A, that is implemented in 
most computer hbraries on linear algebra. Starting from the singular value 
decomposition of A, we can easily compute, of course, (A-^A)^/^, and the 
polar decomposition of A. 
4.39 . We notice that the singular value decomposition can be written in a more sym-
metric form if we extend T to a square orthogonal matrix V G MN,N(^), 
V ^ V = Id 
and extending diag (/xi, /i2, • • •, /in) to a A/^ x n matrix by adding N — n null rows at 
the bottom. Then, again 
A = VAS 
where V G MATXATW, V ^ V = Id, S G Mn,n(^), 
S^S = Id and

c. The Moore-Penrose inverse 
Let A : X —^Y he 3. linear operator between two Euclidean or two Hermi-
tian spaces of dimension respectively, n and m. Denote by 
P:X 
^kevA^ 
and 
Q:Y-^lmA 
the orthogonal projections operators to kevA-^ and 1mA. Of course Ax = 
Qy has at least a solution x G X for any y ^Y. 
Equivalently, there exists 
X E X such that y — Ax ± Im ^. Since the set of solutions of Ax — Qy is 
a translate of ker A, we conclude that there exists a unique x := A'^y E X 
such that 
y — Ax 1. Im A, 
[x e 
kerA^, 
equivalently, 
Ax = Qy, 
X = Px. 
(4.8) 
The linear map A"^ :Y ^^ X, y —^ A^y, defined this way, i.e., 
is called the Moore-Penrose inverse oi A: X ^^Y. From the definition 
{AA^ 
=Q, 
A^A = P, 
ker A+ =lmA^ 
= kerQ, 
ImA^ = 
keiA^. 
4.40 Proposition. A^ is the unique linear map B :Y -^ X such that 
AB = Q, 
BA = P 
and 
kerB = keTQ', 
(4.9) 
moreover we have 
A^AA"^ =A^AA'' 
=A\ 
(4.10) 

128 
4. Self-Adjoint Operators 
Proof. We prove that B = A^ by showing for s\\ y £ Y the vector x := By satisfies 
(4.8). The first equaUty in (4.9) yields Ax = ABy = Qy and the last two imply x = 
By = BQy = BAx = Px. 
Finally, from AA^ = Q and A^A = P^ we infer that 
A*AA^ = A*Q = A\ 
A^AA* = PA* = A*, 
using also that A*Q = A* and PA* = A* since A and A* are such that ImA 
= 
(kerA*)-^ and ImA* = kerA-^. 
D 
The equation (4.10) allow us to compute A^ easily when A is injective 
or surjective. 
4.41 Corollary. Let A : X ^^ Y be a linear map between Euclidean or 
Hermitian spaces of dimension n and m, respectively. 
(i) If ker A = {0}, then n <m, A* A is invertible and 
A^ = {A*A)-^A*; 
moreover^ if A = [/(A*A)^/^ is the polar decomposition of A, then 
A^ = 
{A*A)-^/^U\ 
(ii) If ker A* = {0}, then n>m, 
AA* is invertible, and 
moreover, if A = {AA*)^^'^U* is the polar decomposition of A, then 
At = C/(AA*)-V2. 
For more on the Moore-Penrose inverse, see Chapter 10. 
4.2 Some Applications 
In this final section, we illustrate methods of linear algebra in a few specific 
examples. 
4.2.1 The method of least squares 
a. The method of least squares 
Suppose we have m experimental data yi, 2/2, • • •, Vm when performing an 
experiment of which we have a mathematical model that imposes that the 
data should be functions, (/>(x), of a variable x e X. Our problem is that 
of finding x G X in such a way that the theoretical data 0(x) be as close 
as possible to the data of the experiment. 
We can formahze our problem as follows. We list the experimental data 
as a vector y = (yi, 2/2, • • •, 2/m) G W^ and represent the mathematical 

4.2 Some Applications 
129 
model as a map 0 : X —> W^. Then, we introduce a cost function C = 
C{(j){x)^y) that evaluates the error between the expected result when the 
parameter is x, and the experimental data. Our problem then becomes 
that of finding a minimizer of the cost function C. 
If we choose 
(i) the model of the data to be linear^ i.e., X is a vector space of dimen-
sion n and (j) = A\ X -^ W^ is a linear operator, 
(ii) as cost function, the function square distance between the expected 
and the experimental data, 
C{x) = \Ax - 2/|2 = {Ax - y\Ax - y), 
(4.11) 
we talk of the {linear) least squares problem. 
4.42 Theorem. Let X and Y he Euclidean spaces, A \ X ^^ Y a linear 
map, y EY and C : X ^^R the function 
C{x) := \Ax-y\Y^ 
x e X. 
The following claims are equivalent 
(i) X is a minimizer of C, 
(ii) y - Ax ± 1mA, 
(iii) X solves the canonical equation 
A*{Ax-y) 
= 0. 
(4.12) 
Consequently C has at least a minimizer in X and the space of minimizers 
of C is a translate o/ker A. 
Proof. Clearly minimizing is equivalent to finding z = Ax G ImA of least distance 
from y. By the orthogonal projection theorem, x is a minimizer if and only if Ax is the 
orthogonal projection of y onto Im A. We therefore deduce that a minimizer x G X for 
C exists, that for two minimizers xi,X2 of C we have Axi = Ax2, i.e., xi — X2 6 ker A 
and that (i) and (ii) are equivalent. Finally, since ImA-*- = kerA*, (ii) and (iii) are 
clearly equivalent. 
• 
4.43 Remark. The equation (4.12) expresses the fa-ct that the function x —>• | Aa: — 6p 
is stationary at a minimizer. In fact, compare 3.65, since Vx{z\x) 
= z and Vx(^x\x) 
= 
2La; if L is self-adjoint, we have 
\Ax - 6|2 = |6|2 _ 2(6|Ax) + |Ax|2, 
V(6|Ax) = V(A*6|x) = A*6, 
Vx|Ax|2 = Vx{A*Ax\x) 
= 
2A*Xx 
hence 
Vx\h-Ax\^ 
= 
2A*{Ax-h). 
As a consequence of Theorem 4.42 on account of (4.8) we can state the 
following 
4.44 Corollary. The unique minimizer of C{x) = \Ax — y|y in Im A* = 
ker A-^ is X = A^y. 

130 
4. Self-Adjoint Operators 
b. The function of linear regression 
Given m vectors xi, X2,. • •, Xm in a Euclidean space X and m correspond-
ing numbers yi, 2/2, • • •, 2/m, we want to find a linear map L : X -^R that 
minimizes the quantity 
m 
nL):='£\yi-Lixi)\\ 
i=l 
This is in fact a dual formulation of the linear least squares problem. 
By Riesz's theorem, to every linear map L : X —> R corresponds a 
unique vector WL ^ X such that L{y) := {y\wL)j and conversely. Therefore, 
we need to find w G X such that 
m 
C{w) := ^Ivi 
- {xi\w)\'^ -^ min. 
2 = 1 
If y := (2/1, 2/2, • • •, 2/m) ^ R"^ and A: X —^ W^ is the linear map 
Aw := [{xi\w), {X2\w),... 
{xn\w)j, 
we are again seeking a minimizer of C : X —> M 
C{w) :=\y-Aw\^, 
w e X. 
Theorem 4.42 tells us that the set of minimizers is nonempty, it is a trans-
late of ker A and the unique minimizer of C in ker A-^ = Im ^* is if; := A^y. 
Notice that 
n 
A*a=j2 
^i^i^ 
^=(«^ 
^^ • • -«"") ^ ^"^ 
2 = 1 
hence, w £ IxnA'' = ker A"^ if and only if if; is a linear combination of 
xi, X2,..., Xm- We therefore conclude that A'^y is the unique minimizer 
of the cost function C that is a linear combination o/xi, 0:2,..., Xm- The 
corresponding linear map L{x) := {x\A^y) is called the function of linear 
regression. 
4.2.2 Trigonometric polynomials

results about trigonometric polynomials, see e.g.. Section 5.4.1 of [GM2].

4.2 Some Applications 
135 
Notice that, according to their definitions, we need N'^ multiphcations 
to compute DFTN 
(or IDFTjsj). There is an algorithm, that we shall not 
describe here, called the Fast Fourier Transform that, using the redun-
dance of some multiphcations, computes DFTN 
(or IDFTN) 
with only N 
multiplications with a performance of 0{N log N). 
Let P{t) = E L - n ^k^'^'' ^ ^n,27r and let AT > 2n + 1. A computation 
similar to the one in Proposition 4.50 shows that

and Xj := ^ j , -N

spectrum of P is the DFT^ 
of its values at Xj if n < N/2. 
On the other hand, if z := (ZQ, • • •, ZN-I) is the vector defined by

if n < A: < iV/2,

if iV/2 + n < fc < TV 
and we recall that IDFTN 
is the inverse of DFTN, 
we have 
P{xj) 
:= 
{IDFTNZ)J, 
i.e., the values of P at X j are the IDFTN 
of the spectrum of P.

and 
IDFTN

the sampling points and DTFN

4.2.3 Systems of difference equations 
Linear difference equations of first and second order are discussed e.g., in 
[GM2]. Here we shall discuss systems of linear difference equations. 
a. Systems of linear difference equations 
First let us consider systems of first order. Let A G Mk,k{C). The homo-
geneous linear recurrence for the sequence in C'^ 
{
Xn+i = AXn, 
n > 0, 
Xo given 
has the unique solution Xn := A'^XQ Vn, as one can easily check. 
4.53 Proposition. Given {Fn} in C^, the recurrence

n > 0, 
[Xo given 
has the solution 
n 
Xn := A^Xo + Y. ^""''^3

and conversely, if {Xn} solves (4.20), then {xn}, Xn '-= X^ Vn, solves 
(4.18). In this way the theory of higher order linear difference equations is 
subsumed to that of first order systems. In this respect, one computes for 
the matrix A in (4.19) that 
k-i 
det(AId - A) = A'^ + ^ajX^. 
j=0 
This polynomial in A is called the characteristic polynomial of the differ-
ence equation (4.18). 
b. Power of a matrix 
Let us compute the power of A in an efficient way. To do this we remark 
the following. 
(i) If B is similar to A, A = S'^BS for some S with det S 7^ 0, then 
A^ = S-^BSS-^BS = S-^B^S 
and, by induction, 
A" = S-^B"S Vn.

k 
3 = 1 
where Ai, A2,..., A^ are the eigenvalues of A and Pj{t) is a polynomial of 
degree at most Pj — 1, where pj is the algebraic multiplicity of \j. It follows 
that for p > maxi{\\i\) there is a constant Cp such that every solution of 
Xn-^i = AXfi satisfies 
\Xn\ = sup < Cpp"" \Xo\

In particular we have the following. 
4.55 Theorem. If all eigenvalues of A have modulus less than one, then 
every solution of Xn^i = AXn converges to zero as n -^ +00. 
Proof. Fix cr > 0 such that maxi=i,n \^i\ < cr < 1. As we have seen, there exists a 
constant Ca such that if Xn is a solution of Xn+i = AXn Vn, then 
\Xn\ < CaCT'' \Xol

Since 0 < cr < 1, a"^ —^ 0, and the claim is proved.

4,2.4 An ODE system: small oscillations 
Let xi, X2,..., xjv be N point masses in M^ each respectively, to a nonzero 
mass mi, m2,..., TRN. Assume that each point exerts a force on the other 
points according to Hookers law^ i.e., the force exerted by the mass at Xj 
on Xi is proportional to the distance of Xj from x^ and directed along the 
line through x^ and Xj, 
By Newton's reaction law, the force exerted by x^ on Xj is equal and 
opposite in direction, fji = ~fij^ consequently the elastic constants fc^j, 
i ^ j , satisfy the symmetry condition kij = kji. In conclusion, the total 
force exerted by the system on the mass at x^ is

z = l,...,Ar, 
(4.23) 
with the particularity that the jth component of the force depends only 
on the jth component of the mass. The system then splits into 3 systems 
of N equations of second order, one for each coordinate. If we use the 
matrix notation, things simplify. Denote by M := diag {mi, m2,. • •, TUN}

Then (4.23) transforms into the system of equations 
MX'\t)-\-KX{t) = 0

Since M~^K is symmetric, there is an orthonormal basis of R^ made 
by eigenvalues of M~^K and real numbers Ai, A2,..., AA/^ such that 
{ui\uj) = 5ij 
and 
M.~^Kuj := \jUj\ 
notice that i^i, ?X2? • • •, ^iv are pairwise orthonormal vectors since M is

Vj = 1,..., iV, 
i.e., the system (4.25) splits into A^ second order equations each in the 
unknowns of the matrix PjX.{t). 
Since K is positive, the eigenvalues are positive, consequently each 
element of the matrix PjX(t) is a solution of the harmonic oscillator 
hence 
PjX{t) = cos(yA~t)P,X(0) + ! ^ ^ ^ i ^ P , . X ' ( 0 ) .

and was carried on with the introduction of the system of real numbers 
by Richard Dedekind (1831-1916) and Georg Cantor (1845-1918) and of 
the system of complex numbers with the parallel development of the the-
ory of functions by Camille Jordan (1838-1922), Karl Weierstrass (1815-
1897), J. Henri Poincare (1854-1912), G. F. Bernhard Riemann (1826-
1866), Jacques Hadamard (1865-1963), Emile Borel (1871-1956), Rene-
Louis Baire (1874-1932), Henri Lebesgue (1875-1941) during the whole of 
the XIX and beginning of the XX century, led to the introduction of new 
concepts such as open and closed sets, the point of accumulation and the 
compact set. These notions found their natural collocation and their cor-
rect generalization in the notion of a metric space, introduced by Maurice 
Frechet (1878-1973) in 1906 and eventually developed by Felix Hausdorff 
(1869-1942) together with the more general notion of topological space. 
The intuitive notion of a "continuous function" probably dates back 
to the classical age. It corresponds to the notion of deformation without 
"tearing". A function from X to F is more or less considered to be con-
tinuous if, when x varies slightly, the target point y = f{x) also varies 
slightly. The critical analysis of this intuitive idea also led, with Bernhard 
Bolzano (1781-1848) and Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857), to the cor-
rect definition of continuity and the limit of a function and to the study 
of the properties of continuous functions. We owe the theorem of interme-
diate values to Bolzano and Cauchy, around 1860 Karl Weierstrass proved 
that continuous functions take on maximum and minimum values in a 
closed and limited interval, and in 1870 Eduard Heine (1821-1881) stud-
ied uniform continuity. The notion of a continuous function also appears 
in the work of J. Henri Poincare (1854-1912) in an apparently totally dif-
ferent context, in the so-called analysis situs, which is today's topology 
and algebraic topology. For Henri Poincare, analysis situs is the science 
that enables us to know the qualitative properties of geometrical figures. 
Poincare referred to the properties that are preserved when geometrical 
figures undergo any kind of deformation except those that introduce tear-
ing and glueing of points. An intuitive idea for some of these aspects may 
be provided by the following examples.

o Let US draw a disc on a rubber sheet. No matter how one pulls at the 
rubber sheet, without tearing it, the disc stays whole. Similarly, if one 
draws a ring, any way one pulls the rubber sheet without tearing or 
glueing any points, the central hole is preserved. Let us think of a loop 
of string that surrounds an infinite pole. In order to separate the string 
from the pole one has to break one of the two. Even more, if the string 
is wrappped several times around the pole, the linking number between 
string and pole is constant, regardless of the shape of the coils. 
o We have already seen Euler's formula for polyhedra in [GMl]. It is 
a remarkable formula whose context is not classical geometry. It was 
Poincare who extended it to all surfaces of the type of the sphere, i.e., 
surfaces that can be obtained as continuous deformations of a sphere 
without tearing or glueing. 
o E, R^, R^ are clearly different objects as linear vectorspaces. As we have 
seen, they have the same cardinality and are thus undistinguishable as 
sets. Therefore it is impossible to give meaning to the concept of dimen-
sion if one stays inside the theory of sets. One can show, instead, that 
their algebraic dimension is preserved by deformations without tearing 
or glueing. 
At the core of this analysis of geometrical figures we have the notion of 
a continuous deformation that corresponds to the notion of of a continuous 
one-to-one map whose inverse is also continuous, called homeomorphisms. 
We have already discussed some relevant properties of continuous functions 
/ : R - ^ R e / : R 2 - ^ R i n 
[GMl] and [GM2]. Here we shall discuss 
continuity in a sufficiently general context, though not in the most general.

Poincare himself was convinced of the enormous importance of extending 
the methods and ideas of his analysis situs to more than three dimensions.

reflechi^ 
In the first twenty years of this century with the contribution, among 
others, of David Hilbert (1862-1943), Maurice Prechet (1878-1973), FeUx 
Hausdorff (1869-1942), Pavel Alexandroff (1896-1982) and Pavel Urysohn 
(1898-1924), the fundamental role of the notion of an open set in the 
study of continuity was made clear, and general topology was developed 
as the study of the properties of geometrical figures that are invariant 
with respect to homeomorphisms, thus linking back to Euler who, in 1739, 
had solved the famous problem of Konigsberg's bridges with a topological 
method. There are innumerable successive applications, so much so that 
continuity and the structures related to it have become one of the most 
pervasive languages of mathematics. 
In this chapter and in the next, we shall discuss topological notions 
and continuity in the context of metric spaces. 
5.1 Metric Spaces 
5.1.1 Basic definitions 
a. Metrics 
5.1 Definition. Let X be a set. A distance or metric on X is a map 
d : X X X -^ R+ for which the following conditions hold: 
(i) (IDENTITY) d{x,y) >Oifx^yeX, 
and d{x,x) = 0 Vx G X. 
(ii) (SYMMETRY) d{x,y) = d{y,x) ^x,y e X. 
(iii) (TRIANGLE INEQUALITY) d{x,y) < d{x,z) -\-d{z,y), 
\/ x,y,z 
e X. 
A metric space is a set X with a distance d. Formally we say that (X, d) 
is a metric space if X is a set and d is a distance on X. 
The properties (i), (ii) and (iii) are often called metric axioms. 
^ The analysis situs in more than three dimensions presents enormous difficulties; in 
order to overcome them one has to be strongly convinced of the extreme importance 
of this science. If its importance is not well understood by everyone, it is because 
they have not sufficiently thought about it.

Figure 5.2. Time as distance. 
5.2 Example. The Euclidean distance d{x, y) := \x — y\, x,y £R, is a, distance on R. 
On M? and R^ distances are defined by the Euclidean distance, given for n = 2,3 
by 
_ 
^ 1/2 
Irtixi-y^A 
where X := (xi,a;2),y := (yi,2/2) if n = 2, or x := (xi,X2,X3),y := (2/1,2/2,2/3) if n = 3. 
In other words, R, R'^, R^ are metric spaces with the EucHdean distance. 
5.3 Example. Imagine R^ as a union of strips En := {(a:i,a;2,iC3) \n < X3 < n -\- 1}, 
made by materials of different indices of refractions Vn- The time t{A, B) needed for a 
light ray to go from A to B in R^ defines a distance on R^, see Figure 5.2. 
5.4 Example. In the infinite cylinder C = {{x,y,z)\x'^ 
-\-y"^ = 1} c R^, we may 
define a distance between two points P and Q as the minimal length of the line on C, 
or geodesic, connecting P and Q. Observe that we can always cut the cylinder along a 
directrix in such a way that the curve is not touched. If we unfold the cut cylinder to a 
plane, the distance between P and Q is the Euclidean distance of the two image points. 
5.5 1. Of course 1001a; — 2/1 is also a distance on R, only the scale factor has changed. 
More generally, if / : R —• R is an injective map, then d(x, y) := \f(x) — f{y)\ is again 
a distance on R. 
5.6 Definition. Let (X, d) be a metric space. The open ball or spherical 
open neighborhood centered at XQ e X of radius p > 0 is the set 
B{xo,p) := Ix e X\ d{x, XQ) < p\. 
Figure 5.3. Metrics on a cylinder and on the boundary of a cube. 

5.1 Metric Spaces 
153 
Notice the strict inequality in the definition of B{x,r). 
In M, R^, R^ 
with the EucHdean metric, B{xo^ r) is respectively, the open interval ]xo — 
r, xo + r[, the open disc of center XQ G R^ and radius r > 0, and the ball 
bounded by the sphere of R^ of center XQ G R^ and radius r > 0. 
We say that a subset £' C X of a metric space is bounded if it is 
contained in some open ball. The diameter oi E C X is given by 
diam^ := sup< d(a:,y) x, ?/ G £^L 
and, trivially, E is bounded iff didiXnE < +oo. 
Despite the suggestive language, the open balls of a metric space need 
not be either round nor convex; however they have some of the usual 
properties of discs in R^. For instance 
(i) B{xo, r) C B{xo, s) VXQ G X and 0 < r < 5, 
(ii) Ur>oB{xo,r) = X Vxo G X, 
(iii) nr->o^(^o,^) = {^o} Vxo G X , 
(iv) Va:o G X and Vz G B{xo^r) the open ball centered at z and radius 
p :=z r — d(xo, z) > 0 is contained in B{xo, r), 
(v) for every couple of balls B{x,r) 
and B{y,s) with a nonvoid inter-
section and Vz G B{x,r) n ^(y, s), there exists t > 0 such that 
B{z, t) C B{x, r) n B{y, s), in fact t := min(r — d(x, z), s — d{y, z)), 
(vi) for every x,y e X with x ^ y the balls 5(x,ri) and B{y^r2) are 
disjoint if ri + r2 < G!(X, y). 
5.7 ^. Prove the previous claims. Notice how essential the strict inequality in the def-
inition of B(xo, p) is. 
b. Convergence 
A distance d on a set X allow us to define the notion of convergent sequence 
in X in a natural way. 
5.8 Definition. Let (X, c!) he a metric space. We say that the sequence 
{xn} C X converges to x e X, and we write Xn -^ x, if d{Xn,x) -^ 0 in 
R, that is , if for any r > 0 there exists n such that d{xn^x) < r for all 
n>n. 
The metric axioms at once yield that the basic facts we know for limits 
of sequences of real numbers also hold for limits of sequences in an arbitrary 
metric space. We have 
(i) the limit of a sequence {xn} is unique, if it exists, 
(ii) if {xn} converges, then {xn} is bounded, 
(iii) computing the limit of {xn} consists in having a candidate x G X 
and then showing that the sequence of nonnegative real numbers 
{d{xn',x)} converges to zero, 
(iv) if Xn -^ X, then any subsequence of {xn} has the same limit x. 

154 
5. Metric Spaces and Continuous Functions 
Thus, the choice of a distance on a given set X suffices to pass to the 
limit in X (in the sense specified by the metric d). However, given a set 
X, there is no distance on X that is reasonably absolute (even in R), but 
we may consider different distances in X. The corresponding convergences 
have different meanings and can be suited to treat specific problems. They 
all use the same general language, but the exact meaning of what con-
vergence means is hidden in the definition of the distance. This flexibility 
makes the language of metric spaces useful in a large context. 
5-1.2 Examples of metric spaces 
Relevant examples of distances are provided by linear vector spaces on the 
fields K = E or C in which we have defined a norm. 
5.9 Definition. Let X be a linear space over K = R or C. A norm on X 
is a function \\ \\ : X -^ R+ satisfying the following properties 
(i) (FiNiTENESS) ||a;|| eR\/x 
e X. 
(ii) (IDENTITY) ||X|| > 0 and \\x\\ =0 if and only if x — 0. 
(iii) 
(1-HOMOGENEITY) ||AX|| = |A| ||X|| V X G X, 
VA G K. 
(iv) (TRIANGLE INEQUALITY) ||X + 2/|| < ||x|| + ||2/|| \J x,y e X. 
// II • II is a norm on X, we say that (X, || ||) Z5 a linear normed space or 
simply that X is a normed space with norm \\\\. 
Let X be a linear space with norm || ||. It is easy to show that the 
function d: X x X -^ R+ given by 
d{x,y) := \\x-y\\, 
x,y e X, 
satisfies the metric axioms, hence defines a distance on X, called the nat-
ural distance in the normed space (X, || ||). Obviously, such a distance is 
translation invariant, i.e., d{x -\- z,y -\- z) — d{x, y) Vx, y,z ^ X. 
Trivial examples of metric spaces are provided by the nonempty subsets 
of a metric space. If A is a subset of a metric space (X, c?), then the 
restriction of d to ^ x A is trivially, a distance on A. We say that ^ is a 
metric space with the induced distance from X. 
5.10 If. For instance, the cylinder C := {{x, y, 2;) G M^ | x^ 4- y^ = 1} is a metric space 
with the Euclidean distance that, for x, y G C, yields d(x, y) :=:length of the chord 
joining x and y. The geodesic distance dg of Example 5.4, that is the length of the 
shortest path in C between x and y, defines another distance. C with the geodesic 
distance dg has to be considered as another metric space different from C with the 
Euclidean distance. A simple calculation shows that 
l | x - y | | < d , ( x , y ) < | | | x - y | | . 
We shall now illustrate a few examples of metric spaces.

a. Metrics on 
finite-dimensional 
vector spaces 
5.11 %, As we have already seen, E^ with the Euclidean distance |x — y| is a metric 
space. More generally, any Euclidean or Hermitian vector space X is a normed space 
with norm given by 
\\x\\:=^/W) 
cf. Chapter 3. X is therefore a metric space with the induced distance 
d{x,y) := 
\\x-y\\, 
called the Euclidean distance of X.

Show that X —> ||a:||oo is a norm on R'^. Hence, R^, equipped with the distance 
doo(x,y) := 
\\x-y\\oo, 
is a metric space different from the standard R^ with the Euclidean distance of Exer-
cise 5.11. In R"^, the unit ball centered at (0,0) of radius one for the metric doo is the 
square ] — 1, l[x] — 1,1[, see Figure 5.4. 
5.13 % p-distance. Given a real number p > 1, we set for x € R*^ 
:=(Ekil

Show that ||x||p is a norm on R"^, hence 
dp(x,y) := ||x-2/||p 
is a distance on R*^. Observe that || II2 and ^2 are the Euclidean norm and distance 
in R"^. In R^, the unit ball centered at (0,0) of radius one for the metric dp for some 
values of p is shown in Figure 5.4. [Hint: The triangle inequality for the p-norm is called

Va := (ai, a2, •.., an), h={bi, 
62,..., 6n), 
which follows for instance from Minkowski's inequality for integral norms, see [GMl]. 
Alternatively, we can proceed as follows. Suppose a and b are nonzero, otherwise the 
inequality is trivial, apply the convexity inequality f{Xx+{l 
— X)y) < Xf{x)-\-{l — X)f{y) 
to f{t) = tP with X := ai/||a||p, y := 6i/||b||p, A := ||a||p/(||a||p + ||b||p), and sum on 
i from 1 to n, to get 
|a + b||p

5.14 t Product spaces. Let (Xi,^^^)), {X2,d^'^^), ... (Xn,d(^)) be n metric spaces 
and let y = Xi X ^ 2 X • • • X Xn be the Cartesian product of X i , . . . , Xn- Show that

for X = (rr^, x^,..., x^), y = (t/^, 2/^,..., y^) G Y, are distances on Y. Notice that if 
Xi = • • • = Xn = M with the Euclidean distance, Y is R^, then the distances dp(x, y) 
are just the distances in Exercises 5.13 and 5.12. Also show that if {x^} C Y, x^ := 
(x^, x | , . . . x^) Vfc, and x = (x^, x^,..., x^), then the following claims are equivalent. 
(i) There exists p > 1 such that dp(xfc,x) —^ 0,

b. Metrics on spaces of sequences 
We now introduce some distances and norms on infinite-dimensional vector 
spaces. 
5.17 Example (^oo space). Consider the space of all real (or complex) sequences 
X := (a;i,...)- For x = {xn}, y := {yn}, set 
||x||oo :=sup|a:n|, 
doo(x,y) := | | x - y | | o o . 
n 
It is easy to show that x —• ||a;||oo satisfies the axioms of a norm apart from the fact 
that it may take the value +oo. Thus a: —>• ||a:||oo is a norm in the space 
^C50 : = | x = {Xn} I ||x||oo < +CXD j , 
that is, on the linear vector space of hounded sequences. Consequently, 
doo{x,y) := ||x-y||oo, 
x,y eioo, 
is a distance on ^oo J called the unifoTm distance. Convergence of "{x/j. }• (Z •^oo to x G •^oo 
in the uniform norm, called the uniform convergence, amounts to 
(5.1) 
||Xfc - x | | o o =SUp|xJ. - X ' 
as fc —• oo. 
where Xfc = (a;^,a;|,...) and x = (x^, x ^ , . . . ) . Notice that the uniform convergence in 
(5.1) is stronger than the pointwise 
convergence 
Vi xi 
as fc —>^ oo. 
For instance, let (f{t) := te~*, t € M+, and consider the sequence of sequences {x^} 
where x^ := {x^}n, xV- := <^(^). Then \fi we have xj. = f e"^/'' -^ 0 as fc -^ oo, while 
llxfc - Oiloo = supj ^ e - ^ / ^ I 2 = 0 , 1 , . . . j = - 7^ 0. 

158 
5. Metric Spaces and Continuous Functions 
Of course W^ with the metric doo in Exercise 5.12 is a subset of ^oo endowed with 
the induced metric doo- This follows from the identification 
( a : \ . . . , x ^ ) ^ 
( x \ . . . , x " , 0 , . . . , 0 , . . . ) . 
5.18 Example (£p spaces, p > 1). Consider the space of all real (or complex) se-
quences X := ( x i , . . . ) . For 1 < p < oo, x = {xn} and y := {y-n} set 
1 / 
Trivially, ||x||^p = 0 if and only if any element of the sequence x is zero, moreover 
Minkowski's 
inequality 
l|x + y|Up<||x||«^ + ||y|U^, 
holds as it follows from Exercise 5.13 (passing to the limit as n -^ oo in Minkowski's 
inequality in E'^). Thus || ||^ satisfies the metric axioms apart from the fact that it 
may take the value -f-oo. Hence, || H^ is a norm in the linear space of sequences 
^ p - { x = { X n } | | | x | U p < + O o } . 
Consequently, d^ (x, y) := ||x — yWcp is a distance on ip. 
Convergence of {x^} C ^p to x G ^p amounts to 
oo 
where x^ = i^\^^^^ • • •) ^^^ ^ = (x^, x ^ , . . . ) . Notice that W^ with the metric dp in 
Exercise 5.13 is a subset of £p endowed with the induced metric d^p. This follows for 
instance from the identification 
( x \ . . . , x ' ^ ) ^ 
( x \ . . . , x ' ' , 0 , . . . , 0 , . . . ) . 
Finally, observe that ||x||^g < ||x||£p Vx if 1 < p < g, hence 
iiCipC 
iq. 
(5.2) 
Since there exist sequences x = {xn} such that HxH^^ < +oo while ||x||£p = +00 if 
p < g, as for instance 
r 1 1i/p 
the inclusions (5.2) are strict if 1 < p < g. 
The case p = 2 is particularly relevant since the ^2 norm is induced by the scalar 
product 
(x|y),, := £ x * j / * , 
||x|U, = ^ ( x l x ) , , .

c. Metrics on spaces of functions 
The language of metric spaces is particularly relevant in dealing with dif-
ferent types of convergences of functions. As examples of metric spaces of 
functions, we then introduce a few normed spaces that are relevant in the 
sequel. 
5.19 Example (Continuous functions). Denote by C°([0,1]) the space of all con-
tinuous functions / : [0,1] -^ M. For / : [0,1] -> E set 
ll/||oo,[0,l] — 
sup 
\f(x)\. 
x€[0,l] 
We have 
(0 ll/llcxD,[o,i] ^ ~^^^ ^y Weierstrass's theorem, 
(ii) ll/lloc!lo!i]=Oifr/(x) = OVx, 
(iii) l|A/||oc,[o,i] = |A|||/||oo,[o,i). 
(iv) | | / + 9 | | c » , [ 0 , l l < ll/llcx,,[0,ll + IMIoo,lO,ll-
To prove (iv) for instance, observe that for all x € [0,1], we have 
\f(x)+g{x)\ 
< \f(x)\ + \g{x)\ < ||/||oc,[o,i] + IMIoc,[o,i] 
hence the right-hand side is an upperbound for the values of f -\- g. 
The map / —* ||/||oo,[o,i] ^^ *^^^ ^ norm on C^([0,1]), called the uniform or infinity 
norm. Consequently C^([0,1]) is a normed space and a metric space with the 
uniform 
distance 
^ 
^ 
te[o,i] 
In this space, the ball B{f, e) of center / and radius e > 0 is the set of all continuous 
functions g G ^^([0,1]) such that 
\gix) - f{x)\ < e 
V x G [ 0 , l ] 
or the family of all continuous functions with graphs in the tubular neighborhood of 
radius e of the graph of / 
t / ( / , e ) : = { ( a ; , j / ) | x e [ 0 , l ] , y eR,\y 
- f{x)\ < e], 
(5.3) 
see Figure 5.6. 
The uniform convergence in C^([0,1]), that is the convergence in the uniform norm, 
of {fk} C C^([0,1]) to / G C^([0,1]) amounts to computing 
Mk '•= ll/fc - /lloc,[o,i] = ^^^,j l/fc W - / W l 
for every fc = 1, 2 , . . . and to showing that Mk —* 0 as /c -^ -f-oo.

5.20 Example (Functions of class C^dO, 1])). Denote by C^([0,1]) the space of all

It is easy to check that / —• 
Consequently, 
dc^([o,i])if^9) •= ll/-pllci([o,i]) 
defines a distance in C^([0,1]). In this case, a function g E C^ has a distance less than 
e from / if | | / - S/||oo,[o,i] + 11/' - P1IOO,[O,I] < ^i equivalently, if the graph of g is in the 
tubular neighborhood t/(/, ei) of the graph of / , and the graph of g' is in the tubular 
neighborhood C/(/',e2) of f with ei + 62 = e, see (5.3). Moreover, convergence in the 
Ci([0,l])-norm of { A } C CH[0,1]) to f E Ci([0,l]), \\fk - /Ilci([0,i]) ^ 0, amounts 
to

Figures 5.8 and 5.9 show graphs of Lipschitz functions and functions of class 
C^([0,1]) that are closer and closer to zero in the uniform norm, but with uniform 
norm of the derivatives larger than one. 
5.21 Example (Integral metrics). Another norm and corresponding distance in 
C^([0,1]) is given by the distance in the mean

5.22 ^. Show that the L -norm in C0([0,1]) satisfies the norm axioms. 
Convergence with respect to the L^-distance differs from the uniform one. For 
instance, for A: = 1, 2 , . . . set

We have ||/fc||cx>,[o,i] = /(O) = fc -^ H-oo while ||/fc||Li([o,i]) = V(2fc) -^ 0, cf. Fig-
ure 5.7. 
More generally, the I/P([0, l])-norm, 1 < p < oo, on C°([0,1]), is defined by

The triangle inequality is in fact Minkowski's inequality, see [GMl].] 
5-l,3 Continuity and limits in metric spaces 
a. Lipschitz-continuous maps between metric spaces 
5.24 Definition. Let (X^dx) 
and (Y^dy) be two metric spaces and let 
0 < a < 1. We say that a function f : X ^^ Y is a-Holder-continuous if 
there exists L > 0 such that 
dY{f{x)J{y)) 
< Ldxix.vr, 
yx.yeX. 
(5.5) 
1-Holder-continuous functions are also called Lipschitz continuous. The 
smallest constant L for which (5.5) holds is called the a-Holder constant 
of / , often denoted by [f]a' When a = 1, the l-Holder constant is also 
called the Lipschitz constant of f and denoted by [f]i, Lip/ or Lip(/). 
5.25 Example (The distance function). Let {X, d) be a metric space. For any XQ G 
X, the function f{x) 
:= d{x,xo) 
: X —> R is a Lipschitz-continuous function with 
Lip (/) = 1. In fact, from the triangle inequaUty, we get 
\fiy) - f{x)\ = \d(y,xo) -d{x,xo)\ 
< d{x,y) 
yx,y G X, 
hence / is Lipschitz continuous with Lip (/) < 1. Choosing a; = XQ, we have 
\f{y) - /(^o)| = \d{y, xo) - d{xo, xo)\ = d{y, XQ), 
thus Lip(/) > 1. 

162 
5. Metric Spaces and Continuous Functions 
Figure 5.9. On the left, the sequence fkix) 
:= k~^ cos{kx) that converges uniformly 
to zero with slopes equibounded by one. On the right, gk(x) 
'•= k~^ cos{k'^x), that 
converges uniformly to zero, but with slopes that diverge to infinity. Given any function 
/ G C'^([0,1]), a similar phenomenon occurs for the sequences fk{x) := f(kx)/k, 
gk{x) = 
f{k'^x)/k. 
5.26 ^ Distance from a set. Let (X, d) be a metric space. The distance function 
from cc € A" to a nonempty subset A C X is defined by 
d{x, A) := inf|d(a:, y) U € A \ . 
It is easy to show that f{x) := d(x, A) : X —^R is a, Lipschitz-continuous function with 
Li (f)^ 
Jo iid(x,A) = OWx, 
I 1 
otherwise. 
If d{x, A) is identically zero, then the claim is trivial. On the other hand, for any x,y £ X 
and z E A we have d{x, z) < d{x, y) -\- d{y, z) hence, taking the infimum in z^ 
d{x,A)-d{y,A) 
<d{x,y) 
and interchanging x and y, 
\d{x,A)-d{y,A)\<d{x,y), 
that is, x —> d(x, A) is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant less than one. Since 
there exists a. x ^ A such that d(rr. A) > 0, there exists a sequence {zn} C A such that 
W r < l 
+ i 
Therefore, 
\d(x, A) — d(xn,A)\ 
= d{x, A) > 
d(x, Xn), 
n -\-1 
from which we infer that the Lipschitz constant of a: —• d{x^ A) must not be smaller 
than one. 
b. Continuous maps in metric spaces 
The notion of continuity that we introduced in [GMl], [GM2] for functions 
on one real variable can be extended in the context of the abstract metric 
structure. In fact, by paraphrasing the definition of continuity of functions 
/ : R -^ R+ we get 

5.1 Metric Spaces 
163 
5.27 Definition. Let (X^dx) 
and {Y^dy) be two metric spaces. We say 
that f : X ^^ Y is continuous at XQ Z/ Ve > 0 there exists S > 0 such that 
dy(/(x),/(xo)) < e whenever dx{x,xo) 
< S, i.e., 
Ve > 0 3(5 > 0 such that f{Bx{xo, 
S)) C 5y(/(XQ), e). 
(5.6) 
We say that f : X ^^ Y is continuous in E C X if f is continuous at 
every point XQ ^ E. When E = X and f : X ^^ Y is continuous at any 
point of X, we simply say that f : X ^^Y 
is continuous. 
5.28 1[. Show that a-Holder-continuous functions, 0 < a < 1, in particular Lipschitz-
continuous functions, between two metric spaces are continuous. 
Let (X, dx) and (F, dy) be two metric spaces and E C X. Since E is a, 
metric space with the induced distance of X, Definition 5.27 also appHes 
to the function f : E —^Y. Thus f : E —^Y is continuous dit XQ E E if 
\/e>03S>0 
such that f{Bx{xo, 
S) H E) C By{f{xo), 
e) 
(5.7) 
and we say that / : E" ^ y is continuous ii f : E ^^ Y is continuous at 
any point XQ E E. 
5.29 Remark. As in the case of functions of one real variable, the domain 
of the function / is relevant in order to decide if / is continuous or not. 
For instance, f : X -^Y 
is continuous in £" C X if 
Vxo G E V€ > 0 35 > 0 such that f{Bx{xo, 
5)) C By{f{xo), 
e), 
(5.8) 
while the restriction f\E - E -^ Y oi f to E is continuous in E if 
yxoeE\/e>03S>0 
such that f{Bx{xo,S)nE) 
C By{f{xo),e). 
(5.9) 
We deduce that the restriction property holds: if f : X ^^Y is continuous 
in E, then its restriction f\E '- ^ ~^^ 
^o E is continuous. The opposite is 
in general false, as simple examples show. 
5.30 Proposition. Let X,Y,Z 
be three metric spaces, and XQ E X. If 
f : X ^^ Y is continuous at XQ and g : Y -^ Z is continuous at f{xo), 
then g o f : X ^^ Z is continuous at XQ • In particular, the composition of 
two continuous functions is continuous. 
Proof. Let e > 0. Since g is continuous at f{xo), 
there exists a > 0 such that 
g{BY{f{xo),(T)) 
C Bz{g{f{xo)),e). 
Since / is continuous at XQ, there exists 5 > 0 
such that f(BxixoyS)) 
C By(/(a;o),cr), consequently 
go f{Bx{xo,S)) 
C g{BYif{xo),a)) 
C Bzigo 
f{xo),e). 
D 
Continuity can be expressed in terms of convergent sequences. As in 
the proof of Theorem 2.46 of [GM2], one shows 
5.31 Theorem. Let (X, dx) and (y, dy) be two metric spaces, f : X 
-^Y 
is continuous at XQ E X if and only if f{xn) -^ f{xo) in iy^dy) 
whenever 
{Xn} 
d X, Xn-^ 
XQ in ( X , d x ) . 

164 
5. Metric Spaces and Continuous Functions 
c. Limits in metric spaces 
Related to the notion of continuity is the notion of the hmit. Again, we 
want to rephrase f{x) —^yo as x ^ XQ. For that we need / to be defined 
near XQ, but not necessarily at XQ. For this purpose we introduce the 
5.32 Definition. Let X be a metric space and A C X. We say that XQ G 
X is an accumulation point of A if each ball centered at XQ contains at 
least one point of A distinct from XQ , 
V r > 0 
B ( x o , r ) n A \ { x o } ^ 0 . 
Accumulation points are also called cluster points. 
5.33 %, Consider R with the EucUdean metric. Show that 
(i) the set of points of accumulation of A :=]a, 6[, B = [a,b], C = [a, b[ is the closed 
interval [a, 6], 
(ii) the set of points of accumulation of A :=]0,1[U{2}, B = [0,1]U{2}, C = [0,1[U{2} 
is the closed interval [0,1], 
(iii) the set of points of accumulation of the rational numbers and of the irrational 
numbers is the whole R. 
We shall return to this notion, but for the moment the definition suffices. 
5.34 Definition. Let (X, dx) and (Y, dy) be two metric spaces, 
letEcX 
and let XQ G X be a point of accumulation of E. Given f : E\ {XQ} -^ Y, 
we say that y^ £Y 
is the limit of f{x) as x -^ XQ, X E E, and we write 
f{x) -^yo as x-^ 
XQ, 
or 
lim /(x) = yo 
X 
' X Q 
xeE 
if for any e > 0 there exists 6 > 0 such that dy(/(x),2/o) < e whenever 
X e E and 0 < dx{x,xo) 
< S. Equivalently, 
Ve > 0 3(5 > 0 such that f{Bx{xo, 
S)r]E\ 
{XQ}) C Byiyo, e). 
Notice that, while in order to deal with the continuity of / at xo we 
only need / to be defined at XQ; when we deal with the notion of limit we 
only need that XQ be a point of accumulation of E. These two requirements 
are unrelated, since not all points of E are points of accumulation and not 
all points of accumulation of E are in E, see, e.g.. Exercise 5.33. Moreover, 
the condition 0 < dxix^xo) 
in the definition of limit expresses the fact 
that we can disregard the value of / at XQ (in case / is defined at XQ). Also 
notice that the limit is unique if it exists^ and that limits are preserved by 
restriction. To be precise, we have 
5.35 Proposition. Let (X, dx) and (F, dy) be two metric spaces. Suppose 
F C E C X and let XQ G X be a point of accumulation for F. If f{x) —^y 
as X -^ xo; X £ E, then /(x) -^ y as x -^ XQ, X £ F. 
5.36 ^. As for functions of one variable, the notions of limit and continuity are strongly 
related. Show the following. 

5.1 Metric Spaces 
165 
Proposition. Let X and Y be two metric spaces, E C X and XQ ^ X. 
(i) // XQ belongs to E and is not a point of accumulation 
of E, then every 
function 
f : E —^Y is continuous 
at XQ. 
(ii) Suppose that XQ belongs to E and is a point of accumulation for E. 
Then 
a) f : E -^ Y is continuous 
at XQ if and only if f{x) —>• f{xo) 
as x ^^ XQ, 
xe 
E, 
b) f(x) —> y as X -^ XQ, X ^ E, if and only if the function 
g : EU {XQ} -^ Y 
defined by 
\fix) 
ifxeE\{xo}, 
if X = XQ 
is continuous 
at XQ. 
We conclude with a change of variable theorem for limits, see e.g., 
Proposition 2.27 of [GMl] and Example 2.49 of [GM2]. 
5.37 Proposition. Let X^Y,Z 
be metric spaces, E C X and let XQ be 
a point of accumulation for E. Let f : E —^ Y, g : f{E) 
-^ Z be two 
functions and suppose that /(XQ) is an accumulation point of f{E). If 
(i) 9{y) -^ L as y -^ yo, y e 
f{E), 
(ii) f(x) -^ yo as X -^ xoy X e E, 
(iii) either f{xo) = yO) or f{x) ^ yo for all x e E and x ^ XQ, 
then g{f{x)) -^ L as x —^ XQ, X E E. 
d. The junction property 
A property we have just hinted at in the case of real functions is the 
junction property^ see Section 2.1.2 of [GMl], which is more significant for 
functions of several variables. 
Let X be a set. We say that a family {[/«} of subsets of a metric space 
is locally finite at a point XQ G X if there exists r > 0 such that B(xo, r) 
meets at most a finite number of the C/a's. 
5.38 Proposition. Let {X^dx), 
(1^,dy) be metric spaces, f : X —^ Y a 
function, XQ E X, and let {Ua} be a family of subsets of X locally finite at 
XQ. 
(i) Suppose that XQ is a point of accumulation of Ua and that f[x) -^ y 
as X -^ XQ, X eUa, for all a. Then f{x) —^y as x ^^ XQ, X £ X. 
(ii) // XQ G HaUa and f : Ua C X —^ Y is continuous at xo for all a, 
then f : X ^^Y 
is continuous at XQ . 
5.39 t- Prove Proposition 5.38. 
5.40 Example. An assumption on the covering is necessary in order that the conclu-
sions of Proposition 5.38 hold. Set A := {(x, y)\x'^ <y <.2x'^} C M^ and 
{

0 
otl 
otherwise. 

166 
5. Metric Spaces and Continuous Functions 
The function / is discontinuous at XQ := (0,0), since its oscillation is one in every ball 
centered at XQ. Denote by Um the straight line through the origin 
Um '•= {(x,y)\y = mx}, 
m G M, 
Uoo '-= {{x,y)\x 
= 0}. 
The C/a's, a G R U {oo} form a covering of E^ that is not locally finite at XQ and for 
any a G M U oo, the restriction of / to e£ich Ua is zero near the origin. In particular, 
each restricition f^u^ : [/« —^ M is continuous at the origin. 
5-1-4 Functions from R^ into 
om 
It is important to be acquainted with the Umit notion we have just intro-
duced in an abstract context. For this purpose, in this section, we shall 
focus on mappings between Euclidean spaces and illustrate with a few 
examples some of the abstract notions previously introduced. 
a. The vector space 
C^{A,W^) 
Denote by eV R"^ -^ R the linear map that maps x = (x^, x^,..., x^) G 
R'^ into its ith component, e*(x) := x \ Any map f : X -^ W' from 
a set X into R^ writes as an n-tuple of real-valued functions /(x) = 
(/^(x),..., /'^(x)), where for any i = 1,..., n the function /* : X -^ R 
is given by p{x) := e^(/(x)). 
Prom 
n 
|yi|,|y2|,...,i2/„l<|y|<X^|j/i| 
yeM" 
z=l 
we readily infer the following. 
5.41 Proposition. The following claims hold. 
(i) The maps eV R^ —> R, i = 1,..., n, are Lipschitz continuous. 
(ii) Let {X, d) he a metric space. Then 
a) f : X -^ W^ is continuous at XQ e X if and only if all its 
components f^, /^,..., /^ are continuous at XQ, 
b) '^f fi9 ' ^ -^^^ 
^^6 continuous at XQ, then f -\- g : X —> W^ is 
continuous at XQ , 
c) if f : X -^ W^ and A : X —> R are continuous at XQ then the 
map Xf : X —^ W^ defined by A/(x) := A(x)/(x), is continuous 
at 
XQ. 
5.42 Example. The function / : R^ —>• R, /(x, y, x) := sin(x^y) + x^ is continuous at 
R^. In fact, if xo := (xo,yo,zo), 
then the coordinate functions x = (x, y,%) -^ x, x —^ y, 
X —>• z are continuous at XQ by Proposition 5.41. By Proposition 5.41 (iii), x -^ x'^y and 
X -^ z'^ are continuous at xo, and by (ii) Proposition 5.41, x -^ x'^y + z"^ is continuous 
at XQ. Finally sin(x^2/ -^ x^) is continuous since sin is continuous. 
5.43 Definition. Let X and Y he two metric spaces. We denote hy 
C^{X, Y) the class of all continuous function f : X 
-^Y. 

5.1 Metric Spaces 
167 
As a consequence of Proposition 5.41 C^(X,R"^) is a vector space. 
Moreover, if A G C^{X,R) and / G CO(X,R^), then A/ : X -^ R^ given 
by Xf{x) := A(x)/(x), xeX, 
belongs to C^(X,R^). In particular, 
5.44 Corollary. Polynomials in n variables belong to C^(R^,R). There-
fore, maps f '.W^ —^ W^ whose components are polynomials of n variables 
are continuous. In particular, linear maps L G £(R^,R'^) are continuous. 
It is worth noticing that in fact 
5.45 Proposition. Let L :W^ ^^ W^ be linear. Then L is Lipschitz con-
tinuous in R^. 
Proof. As L is linear, we have 
Lip (/) : ==

Let us prove that ||L|| < H-CXD. Since L is continuous at zero by Corollary 5.44, there 
exists S > 0 such that ||L(ii;)|| < 1 whenever \\w\\ < S. For any nonzero 2 € M^, set 
w := 2Jnr\- Since ||ti;|| < 6, we have ||L(i(;)|| < 1. Therefore, writing z = 
^y^w and 
using the linearity of L 
||L(.)|| = | | « L W | | = « | 1 L H | | < ^ | N 1 
hence 
||L||<?<+oo. 
For a more detailed description of linear maps in normed spaces, see Chap-
ters 9 and 10. 
b. Some nonlinear continuous transformations 
from R^ into R ^ 
We now present a few examples of nonlinear continuous transformations 
between Euclidean spaces. 
5.46 Example. For fc = 0 , 1 , . . . consider the map w^ :] — 1,1[—> M^ given by 
, , 
J (cos kt, sin kt) 
if t G]0, 27r/fc[, 
1(1,0) 
otherwise. 
This is a Lipschitz function whose graph is given in Figure 5.10. Notice that the graph 
of Uk = {{t,Uk{t))} 
is a curve that "converges" as fc —>• oo to a horizontal Une plus a 
vertical circle at 0. Compare with the function sgn x from M to R.

5.47 Example (Stereographic projection). Let 
be the unit sphere in E^"*"^. If x = ( x i , . . . Xn.Xn^i) 
€ R^"*"^, let us denote the coordi-
nates of x by (2/, z) where y = (xi, X2,..., 
Xn) € M" and z = Xn-\-i € R. With this nota-
tion, S"^ = {(y, z) e M"" X M 112/|2 -j-z'^ = 1}. Furthermore, denote by Ps = (0, - 1 ) € 5^ 
the South pole of S"^. The stereographic projection 
(from the South pole) is the map 
that projects from the South pole the sphere onto the {z = 0} plane, 
cT : S" \ {Ps} C K"+i ^ R", 
(y, z) -^

L -j- Z 
It is easily seen that a is injective, surjective and continuous with a continuous inverse 
given by 
that maps x E M.'^ into the point of S'^ lying in the segment joining the South pole of 
5"' with X, see Figure 5.11. 
5.48 Example (Polar coordinates). The transformation 
(T:E:= 
Up,e)\p>0, 
0 < ^ < 2 7 r } - ^ R 2 , 
(p,^) ^ (pcos(9,psin(9) 
defines a map that is injective and continuous with range R^ \ {0}. 
The extension of the map to the third coordinate 
a : E X R - ^ R 2 x R - - R ^ , 
(p.O.z) -^ 
(pcose.psmO.z) 
defines the so-called cylindrical coordinates in R^. 
5.49 Example (Spherical coordinates). The representation of points {x,y, z) € R^ 
as 
I X — psinipcosO, 
I y = p simp sin 6, 
^Z = 
pCOSip, 
see Figure 5.12, defines the spherical coordinates in R^. This in turn defines a continuous 
transformation (p,0,(p) —> {x,y,z) 
from 
E := | ( p , ^, (^) I /9 > 0, 0 < ^ < 27r, 0 < <^ < TT} = ] 0 , +OO[X [0,2n[x [0, n] 
into R 3 \ {0}.

Complex-valued functions of one complex variable provide examples of 
tranformations of the plane. 
5.50 Example {w = z'^). The map z ^^ z'^ defines a continuous transformation of C 
to C. The inverse image of each nonzero n; G C is made by n distinct points, given by the 
n roots of w, those n points collapse to zero when it; = 0. If we write the transformation 
w = z"^ as 
\w\ == \z\'^ 
Argti; = nArgz, 
we see, identifyng C with M^, that the circle of radius r and center 0 is mapped into 
the circle of radius r'^ and center 0. Moreover, if a point goes clockwise along the circle, 
then the normalized point image -^jp^ goes along the unit circle clockwise n times. 
5.51 f. The map z —^ w = z'^ restricted to ipo < Argz < c^i with 0 < c^i — v?o < 27r/n 
is injective and continuous. 
5.52 %. Show that the map z -^ w = z"^ maps the family of parallel lines to the axes 
(but the axes themselves) into two families of parabolas with the common axis as the 
real axis and the common foci at the origin, see Figure 5.13. 
5.53 Example (The Joukowski function). This is the map

except for the axes, into two families of parabolas with the common axis as the real 
axis and the common foci at the origin. 
which appears in several problems of aerodynamics. It is a continuous function defined 
in C \ {0}. Since X{z) = \(l/z), 
every point w ^ ±1,0 has at most, and, in fact, exactly 
two distinct inverse images zi,Z2 satisfying ziZ2 = 1. 
5.54 If. Show that X(z) = l/2{z-\-l/z) 
is one-to-one from {\z\ < 1, 2 / 0} or {\z\ > 1} 
into the complement of the segment {w\ — 1 < dlw < 1}. A maps the family of circles 
{z I \z\ = r}ry 0 < r < 1, into a family of co-focal ellipses and maps the diameters 
z = te^°^, — 1 < ^ < 1 , 0 < a < 7 r , i n a family of co-focal hyperbolas, see Figure 5.14. 
5.55 Example (The Mobius transformations). These maps, defined by 
L(^):==^i±^, 
ad-bc^O 
(5.10) 
cz -\- d 
are continuous and injective from C \ {—d/c} into C \ {a/c} and have several relevant 
properties that we list below, asking the reader to show that they hold. 
5.56 %. Show the following. 
(i) L(z) —> a/c as \z\ -^ oo and \L{z)\ -^ oo as z -^ —d/c. Because of this, we write 
L(oo) = a/c, L(—d/c) = oo and say that L is continuous from CU{oo} into itself. 
(ii) Show that every rational function, i.e., the quotient of two complex polynomials, 
defines a continuous transformation of C U {oo} into itself, as in (i). 
(iii) The Mobius transformations L{z) in (5.10) are the only rational functions from 
C U {oo} into itself that are injective. 
(iv) The Mobius transformations (aiZ -\- bi)/(ciZ -|- di), i = 1,2, are identical if and 
only if (ai, 6i, ci, di) is a nonzero multiple of (a2, 62, C2, ^2)-
(v) The Mobius transformations form a group G with respect to the composition of 
maps; the subset H C G, H := {z, 1 — z, l/z, 1/(1 — z), (z — l)/z} is a subgroup 
of a 
(vi) A Mobius transformation maps straight lines and circles into straight lines and 
circles (show this first for the map l/z, taking into account that the equations 
for straight lines and circles have the form A{x'^ + V^) + 2Bx + 2Cy + D = 0 if 
z = 
x-\-iy). 
(vii) The map in (5.10) maps circles and straight lines through —c/d into a straight 
line and any other straight line or circle into a circle.

Figure 5.14. The Joukowski function maps circles \z\ = r, 0 < r < 1, and diameters 
z = ±6=*=*", 0 < t < l , 0 < a < 27r, respectively into a family of ellipses and of cofocal 
hyperbolas. 
(viii) The only Mobius transformation with at least two fixed points is z. Two Mobius 
transformations are equal if they agree at three distinct points. There is a unique 
Mobius transformation that maps three distinct points 2:1,22, ^3 € C U {00} into 
three distinct points wi,W2jWs 
G C U {00}. 
5.57 Example (Exponential and logarithm). The complex function z —> exp^;, 
see [GM2], is continuous from C —• C, periodic of period 27Ti with image C \ {0}. In 
particular e^ does not vanish, and every nonzero w has infinitely many preimages. 
5.58 f. Taking into account what we have proved in [GM2], show the following. 
(i) ii; = e^ is injective with a continuous inverse in every strip parallel to the real 
axis of width /i < 27r, and has an image as the interior of an angle of radiants h 
and vertex at the origin; 
(ii) w = e^ maps every straight line which is not parallel to the axes into a logarithmic 
spiral, see Chapter 7. 
c. The calculus of limits for functions of several variables 
Though we may have appeared pedantic, we have always insisted in spec-
ifying the domain E C X in which the independent variables varied. This 
is in fact particularly relevant when dealing with limits and continuity of 
functions of several variables, as in this case there are several reasonable 
ways of approaching a point XQ. Different choices may and, in general, do 
lead to different answers concerning the existence and/or the equality of 
the limits

and 
lim

xeF 
Let (X, dx) and (F, dy) be two metric spaces, f : X -^Y 
and XQ e X 
a point of accumulation of X. 

172 
5. Metric Spaces and Continuous Functions 
Figure 5.15. The function in Example 5.59. 
(i) If we find two sets Ei^E2 such that XQ is an accumulation point 
of both El and E2, and the restrictions f : Ei C X -^ Y and 
f : E2 C X -^Y 
oi f have diflFerent Hmits, then / has no Hmit when 
X ^y XQ, X e El U E2. 
(ii) if we want to show that f{x) has hmit as a: ^ XQ, we may 
a) guess a possible limit yo £Y^ for instance computing the limit 
yo of a suitable restriction of / , 
b) show that the real-valued function x -^ dy(/(x),2/o) converges 
to zero as X -^ xo, for instance proving that 
dy (/(x), yo) < h{x) for all x G X, x ^ XQ, 
where h : X -^R is such that h{x) -^ 0 as x -^ XQ. 
5.59 Example. Let / : E^ \ {(0,0)} -^ M be defined by f(x,y) 
:= xy/{x^ 
+ 2/^) for 
{x,y) 7^ (0,0). Let us show that / has no limit as (x^y) —• (0,0). By contradiction, 
suppose that f{x,y) 
—> L G R as (x,y) —>• (0,0). Then for any sequence {(xn,2/n)} C 
R^\{(0,0)} converging to (0,0) we find f{xn,yn) 
—>• L- Choosing {xn.yn) 
'-— (l/'^, ^7^)? 
we have 
hence, a s n - ^ 0 0 , L = k/{l-\-k?). 
Since k is arbitrary, we have a contradiction. 
This is even more evident if we observe that / is positively homogeneous of degree 0, 
i.e., /(Ax, \y) = f{x, y) for all A > 0, i.e., / is constant along half-lines from the origin, 
see Figure 5.15. It is then clear that / has limit at (0,0) if and only if / is constant, 
which is not the case. Notice that from the inequality 2xy < x^ -^y^ we can easily infer 
that \f{x, y)\ < 1/2 V(x, y) € R^ \ {(0, 0)}, i.e., that / is a bounded function. 
5.60 Example. Let fix,y) 
:= sm(x'^y)/{x'^ 
+2/^) for {x,y) 
^ (0,0). In this case 
(l/n,0) -» (0,0) and / ( l / n , 0 ) = 0 - ^ 0 . Thus 0 is the only possible limit as (x,y) 
-^ 
(0,0); and, in fact it is, since

as (x,2/) —^ (0,0). Here we used | sin t\ < \t\ Vt, 2|x| |y| < x2 -h 2/^ V(x,2/) and that 
(x,2/) -^ |x| is a continuous map in R^, see Proposition 5.41. 

5.1 Metric Spaces 
173 
We can also consider the restriction of / to continuous paths from XQ, 
i.e., choose a map (f : [0,1] -^ R^ that is continuous at least at 0 with 
(p{0) = XQ and ^{t) ^ XQ ior t ^ 0 and compute, if possible 
Such limits may or may not exist and their values depend on the chosen 
path, for a fixed /. Of course, if 
xeE 
then, on account of the restriction property and of the change of variable 
theorem, 
iiS, /(^) = ^ 
and 
lim f{^{t)) = L 
xeF 
respectively for any F C E oi which XQ remains a point of accumulation 
and for any continuous path in E, (^([0,1]) C E. 
5.61 Example. Let us reconsider the function 
/ : R2 \ {(0, 0)} ^ M, 
fix, y) := 
- ^ ^ 
x^ + 2/^ 
which is continuous in R-^ \ {(0, 0)}. Suppose that we move from zero along the straight 
Hne {(x,y)\y 
— mx,a: € M} that we parametrize \yy x -^ (x,mx). 
Then 
f{(p{x)) = f{x,mx) 
= —- 
-^ —

1 + m^ 
1 + m^ 
in particular, the previous limit depends on m, hence f{x, y) has no limit as (x, y) -^ 
(0,0). 
Set E := {{x,y) | x € M, 0 <y < Ax^}. We instead have

line through (0,0) parametrized as (p{t) = (ta, tb), t € K, gives 
f(^it)) = fiat,bt) = - ^ ^ ^ = J^t^O

5.2 The Topology of Metric Spaces 
In this section we introduce some families of subsets of a metric space X 
that are defined by the metric structure, namely the families of open and 
closed sets. Recall that if X is a set, V{X) denotes the set of all subsets of 
X: Ae V{X) if and only 
liAdX. 

5.2 The Topology of Metric Spaces 
175 
5.2.1 Basic facts 
a. Open sets 
5.63 Definition. A subset A of a metric space (X, d) is called an open 
set if for all x £ A there exists a ball centered at x contained in A, i.e., 
Vx G A 3ra, > 0 such that B{x,rx) C A. 
(^-H) 
5.64 Proposition. A subset A of a metric space X is open if and only if 
either A is empty or is a union of open balls. 
Proof. Let A be open. Then either A is empty or A is trivially a union of open balls, 
A — \Jr^^AB(x,rx). 
Conversely, (5.11) trivially holds if A = 0. If instead x G A 7^ 0, 
since we assume that A is union of balls, there is 2/ 6 X and p > 0 such that x G 
^(2/5 p) G A. Thus y ^ A and, setting r := p — d{x, y), we have r > 0 and by the triangle 
inequality B{x^r) C B{y,p) 
C A. 
• 
In particular, 
5.65 Corollary. The open balls of a metric space X are open sets. 
5.66 %. Let (X, d) be a metric space and r > 0. Show that {y E X \ d{y, x) > r} is an 
open set in X. 
5.67 %, Let (X, d) be a metric space. Show that {xn} C X converges to x G X if and 
only if, for any open set A such that x £ A, there exists n such that Xn E A for all 
n 
>n. 
The following is also easily seen. 
5.68 Proposition. Let {X, d) be a metric space. Then 
(i) 0 and X are open sets, 
(ii) if {Aa} is a family of open sets, then UaA^ is an open set, too, 
(iii) zf 74i, A2,..., An are finitely many open sets, then n^^^A^ is open. 
5.69 % By considering the open sets {] — - , ^[ | n G N}, show that the intersection of 
infinitely many open sets needs not be an open set. 
b. Closed sets 
Recall that the complement of A C X is the set 
A^ := X \ A. 
5.70 Definition. Let X be a metric space. F C X is called a closed set 
if F^ — X\F 
is an open set. 

176 
5. Metric Spax^es and Continuous Functions 
The de Morgan formulas 
a 
a 
together with Proposition 5.68 yield at once the following. 
5.71 Proposition. Let X be a metric space. Then 
(i) 0 and X are closed sets, 
(ii) the intersection of any family of closed sets is a closed set, 
(iii) the union of finitely many closed sets is a closed set. 
5.72 %. Show that [a, 6], [a,+oo[ and [—a, H-oo[ are closed sets in E, while [0,1[ is 
neither closed nor open. 
5.73 if. Show that the set {- | n = 1,2,... } is neither closed nor open. 
5.74 %, Show that any finite subset of a metric space is a closed set. 
5.75 ^. Show that the closed ball {x € X\d{x,xo) 
< r}, and its boundary {x € 
X I d(x, xo) = r} are closed sets. 
One may characterize closed sets in terms of convergent sequences. 
5.76 Proposition. Let {X,d) be a metric space. A set F C X is a closed 
set if and only if every convergent sequence with values in F converges to 
a point of F. 
Proof. Suppose that F is closed and that {x^} C F converges to x € X. Let us 
prove that x E F. Assuming on the contrary, that x f F, there exists r > 0 such 
that B(x,r) 
fl F = 0. As {xn} C F , we have d{xn,x) 
> r Vn, a contradiction since 
d{xn,x) 
—> 0. 
Conversely, suppose that, whenever {xk} C F and Xk -^ x, we have a: G F , but F 
is not closed. Thus X \F is not open, hence there exists a point x £ X \F such that 
Vr > 0 B{x, r) n F ^ 0. Choosing r = l , | , | , . . . , w e inductively construct a sequence 
{xn} C F such that d{xn,x) 
< ^, hence converging to x. Thus x e F by assumption, 
but X £ X \F by construction, a contradiction. 
• 
c. Continuity 
5.77 Theorem. Let {X,dx) 
and {Y^dy) be two metric spaces and f : 
X —^Y. Then the following claims are equivalent 
(i) / is continuous, 
(ii) f~^{B) 
is an open set in X for any open ball B 
ofY, 
(iii) f~^{A) 
is an open set in X for any open set A 
inY, 
(iv) f~^(F) 
is a closed set in X for any closed set F 
inY. 

5.2 The Topology of Metric Spaces 
177 
Proof, (i) => (ii). Let B be an open ball in Y and let x be a point in f~^{B). 
Since 
f(x) E B, there exists a ball BY{f{x),e) 
C B. Since / is continuous at x, there exists 
(5 > 0 such that f{Bx{x,S)) 
C By(/(x),e) C B that is Bx(x,5) C / " ^ ( B ) . As x is 
arbitrary, f~^{B) 
is an open set in X. 
(ii) =^ (i) Suppose / " ^ B ) is open for any open ball B of y . Then, given XQ, 
/~^(By(/(xo,6))) is open, hence there is (5 > 0 such that Bx{xo,S) 
is contained in 
/~-^(By(/(xo,6))), i.e., f(Bx{xoyS)) 
C By(/(xo),€), hence / is continuous at XQ. 
(ii) and (iii) are equivalent since f~^{UiAi) 
= Uif~^{Ai) 
for any family {Ai} of subsets 
ofX. 
(iii) and (iv) are equivalent on account of the de Morgan formulas. 
• 
5.78 %. Let /, p : X —> y be two continuous functions between metric spaces. Show 
that the set {x £ X \ /(x) = 9{x)} is closed. 
5.79 ^. It is convenient to set 
Definition. Let (X, d) be a metric space. U C X is said to be a neighborhood of 
XQ £ X if there exists an open set A of X such that XQ £ A C U. 
In particular 
o B(xo,r) 
is a neighborhood of any x € B(xo,r), 
o A is open if and only if A is a neighborhood of any point of A. 
Let {X, d), (y, d) be two metric spaces let XQ e X and let / : X -^ y . Show that / 
is continuous at XQ if and only if the inverse image of an open neighborhood of /(XQ) 
is an open neighborhood of XQ . 
Finally, we state a junction rule for continuous functions, see Proposi-
tion 5.38. 
5.80 Proposition. Let (X, d) be a metric space, and let {Ua} be a cover-
ing of X. Suppose that either all Ua ^s are open sets or all Ua 's are closed 
and for any x £ X there is an open ball that intersects only finitely many 
Ua- Then 
(i) A<Z X is an open (closed) set in X if and only if each AoUa 
is an 
open (closed) set in Ua, 
(ii) Let Y be another metric space and let f : X -^Y. 
Then f is contin-
uous if and only if all the restrictions (t)\u^ :?/«—> F are continuous. 
5.81 %, Some kind of assumption on the covering in Proposition 5.80 is necessary. If 
X := [a, 6], xo G [a, 6], Ux := {x} for all x G [a, 6], show that the claims in Proposi-
tion 5.80 are false. 
d. Continuous real-valued maps 
Let (X, d) be a metric space and / : X ^> R. Prom Theorem 5.77 we find 
that / : X ^' R is continuous if and only if /~^(]a, b[) is an open set for 
every bounded interval ]a, fe[c M. Moreover, 
5.82 Corollary. Let f : X ^^ R be a function defined on a metric space 
X and let t e R. Then 

178 
5. Metric Spaces and Continuous Functions 
(i) {x e X\ f{x) > t}, {x e X\ f{x) < t} are open sets, 
(ii) {x e X\ f{x) >t},{xeX\ 
f{x) < t} and {x £ X \ f{x) = t} are 
closed sets. 
5.83 Proposition. Let (X^d) be a metric space. Then F C X is a closed 
set of X if and only if F = {x\ d(x, F) 
=0}. 
Proof. By Corollary 5.82, {x \ d{x, F) = 0} is closed, x -> d{x, F) being Lipschitz 
continuous, see Example 5.25. Therefore F = {x\ d(x, F) = 0} implies that F is closed. 
Conversely assume that F is closed and that there exists x ^ F such that d{x, F) = 0. 
Since F is closed by assumption, there exists r > 0 such that B{x, r) D F = 0. But then 
(i(x, F) > r > 0, a contradiction. 
D 
5.84 f. Prove the following 
Proposition. Let (X, d) he a metric space. Then 
(i) F C X is a closed set if and only if there exists a continuous function f : X 
-^R 
such that F = {x e X\ f{x) < 0}, 
(ii) A C X is an open set if and only if there exists a continuous function f : X ^>-R 
such that A = {x e X\ f{x) < 0}. 
Actually f can be chosen to be a Lipschitz-continuous 
function. 
[Hint: If F is closed, choose f{x) := d{x,F)^ while if A is an open set, choose f{x) 
= 
-d(x,X\A).] 
e. The topology of a metric space 
5.85 Definition. The topology of a metric space X is the family TX C 
V{X) of its open sets. 
It may happen that different distances di and ^2 on the same set X that 
define diff'erent famihes of balls produce the same family of open sets for 
the same reason that a ball is union of infinitely many squares and a square 
is union of infinitely many balls. We say that the two distances are topo-
logically equivalent if {X,di) and (X, ^2) have the same topology, i.e., the 
same family of open sets. The following proposition yields necessary and 
sufficient conditions in order that two distances be topologically equivalent. 
5.86 Proposition. Let di, d2 be two distances in X and let Bi{x,r) 
and 
B2(x^r) be the corresponding balls of center x and radius r. The following 
claims are equivalent 
(i) di and ^2 ^^^ topologically equivalent, 
(ii) every ball Bi{x,r) 
is open for 0^2 OL^d every ball B2{x^r) is open for 
di. 
(iii) \/x e X and r > 0 there are r^^Px > 0 such that B2{x, r^) C Bi{x, r) 
and Bi[x,px) 
C B2[x,r), 
(iv) the identity map i : X -^ X is a homeomorphism between the metric 
spaces (X^di) and (X, 0J2). 

5.2 The Topology of Metric Spaces 
179 
Figure 5.17. x is an interior point to A, y is s. boundary point to A and z is an exterior 
point to A. X and y are adherent points to A and z is not. 
5.87 ^. Show that the distances in R^ doo and dp Vp > 1, see Exercise 5.13, are all 
topologically equivalent to the Euclidean distance d2- If we substitute W^ with the 
infinitely-dimensional vector space of sequences ii, the three distances give rise to dif-
ferent open sets. 
We say that a property of X is a topological property of X if it can be 
expressed only in terms of set operations and open sets. For instance, being 
an open or closed set, the closure of or the boundary of, or a convergent 
sequence are topological properties of X, see Section 5.2.2 for more. 
As we have seen, / is continuous if and only if the inverse image of open 
sets is open, A trivial consequence, for instance, is that the composition of 
continuous functions is continuous, see Proposition 5.30. Also we see that 
the continuity of / : X —> y is strongly related to the topologies 
Tx '•= {Ac 
X\A 
open in X}, 
ry := {AcY\A 
open in F } , 
respectively on X and y, and in fact it depends on the metrics only through 
Tx and Ty. In other words being a continuous function f : X ^^ Y is a, 
topological property of X and Y. 
f. Interior, exterior, adherent and boundary points 
5.88 Definition. Let X be a metric space and A C X. We say that XQ G 
X is interior to A if there is an open ball B{xQ,r) such that B{xo^r) C A; 
we say that XQ is exterior to A if XQ is interior to X \ A; we say that XQ 
is adherent to A if it is not interior to X \ A; finally, we say that XQ is a 
boundary point of A if XQ is neither interior to A nor interior to 
X\A.

points of accumulation of A, X{A) := ^ \ DA, are the points x e A such 
that J5(x, r) r\A = {x} for some r > 0. These points are contained in A,

(i) X is adherent to F if and only if there exists a sequence {xn} C F 
that converges to x, 
(ii) X is an accumulation point for F if and only if there exists a se-
quence {xn} C F taking distinct values in F that converges to x; in 
particular, 
a) X is an accumulation point for F if and only if there exists a 
sequence {xn} C F\ {x} that converges to x, 
b) in every open set containing an accumulation point for F there 
are infinitely many distinct points of F. 
Proof, (i) If there is a sequence {xn} C F that converges to x G X, in every neighbor-
hood of X there is at least a point of F, hence x is adherent to F. Conversely, if x is 
adherent to F, there IS a XYI G B{x, ^) n F for each n, hence {xn} C F and Xfi 
^ X. 
(ii) If moreover x is a point of accumulation of F, we can choose Xn E F \ {x} and 
moreover Xn G B{x,rn),

D 
h. Subsets and relative topology 
Let (X^d) be a metric space and Y C X. Then (Y^d) is a metric space, 
too. The family of open sets in Y induced by the distance d is called the 
relative topology of Y, We want to compare the topology of X and the 
relative topology of Y. 
The open ball in Y with center x ^Y 
and radius r > 0 is 
Bvix.r) 
:= ^yeY^d{y,x) 
< r | 
=Bx{x,r)nY. 
5.96 Proposition. Let {X,d) be a metric space and let Y C X. Then 
(i) B is open in Y if and only if there exists an open set A C X in X 
such that B = 
AnY, 
(ii) B is closed in Y if and only if there exists a closed set A in X such 
that B = 
AnY. 
Proof. Since (ii) follows at once from (i), we prove (i). Suppose that A is open in X 
and let x be a point in An Y. Since A is open in X, there exists a ball Bx{x,r) 
C A, 
hence By(x,r) 
= Bx{x,r)nY 
C AnY. 
Thus AnY 
is open in Y. 
Conversely, suppose that B is open in Y. Then for any x e B there is a ball 
Byix^rx) 
= Bx{x,rx) 
n B C B. The set A := U{Bxix,rx) 
| a: G B} is an open set in 
X and AnY 
= B. 
D 
Also the notions of interior, exterior, adherent and boundary points, 
in (y, d) are related to the same notions in (X, d), and whenever we want 
to emphasize the dependence on_y' of the interior, closure, derived and 
boundary sets we write inty(yl), Ay, VyA, dyA instead of int A, A, DA, 
dA, 
5.97 Proposition. For any A CY we have 
(i) 
mty{A)_=mtx{A)nY, 
(ii) Ay = 
AxnY,

5.98 f. Let Y := [0,1[C R. The open balls of Y are the subsets of the type {y G 
[0,1[ I I?/ — a:;| < r } . If x is not zero and r is sufficiently small, {y | I?/ — ic| < r} fl [0,1[ is 
again an open interval with center x,]x — r^x -\- r[. But, if x = 0, then for r < 1 
By(0,r) := [0,r[. 
Notice that x = 0 is an interior point of Y (for the relative topology of Y), but it is a 
boundary point for the topology of X. This is in agreement with the intuition: in the 
first case we are considering y as a space in itself and nothing exists outside it, every 
point is an interior point and dyY 
= i/}; in the second case y is a subset of R and 0 is 
at the frontier between Y and M \ y . 
5.99 ^. Prove the claims of this paragraph that we have not proved. 
5.2.2 A digression on general topology 
a. Topological spaces 
As a further step of abstraction, following Felix Hausdorff (1869-1942) 
and Kazimierz Kuratowski (1896-1980), we can separate the topological 
structure of open sets from the metric structure, giving a set-definition of 
open sets in terms of their properties. 
5.100 Definition. Let X be a set. A topology in X is a distinct family 
of subsets T C V{X), called open sets, such that 
o 0, X G r, 
o if {Aoc} C T, then Ua^a ^ T, 
o if Ai,A2,...,AneT, 
thenOl^^Ak^T. 
A set X endowed with a topology is called a topological space. Sometimes 
we write it as (X^r). 
5.101 Definition. A function f : X -^ Y between topological spaces 
(X,Tx) and {Y,TY) 
is said to be continuous if f~^{B) 
e TX whenever 

5.2 The Topology of Metric Spaces 
183 
B e TY' f : X ^^ Y is said to be a homeomorphism if f is both injec-
tive and surjective and both f and f~^ are continuous, or, in other words 
A G Tx if and only if f{A) G ry-
Two topological spaces are said to be homeomorphic if and only if there 
exists a homeomorphism between them. 
Proposition 5.68 then reads as follows. 
5.102 Proposition. Let (X, d) be a metric space. Then the family formed 
by the empty set and by the sets that are the union of open balls of X is a 
topology on X, called the topology on X induced by the metric d. 
The topological structure is more flexible than the metric structure, 
and allows us to greatly enlarge the notion of the space on which we 
can operate with continuous deformations. This is in fact necessary if one 
wants to deal with qualitative properties of geometric figures, in the old 
terminology, with analysis situs. We shall not dwell on these topics nor 
with the systematic analysis of different topologies that one can introduce 
on a set, i.e., on the study of general topology. However, it is proper to 
distinguish between metric properties and topological properties. 
According to Felix Klein (1849-1925) a geometry is the study of the 
properties of figures or spaces that are invariant under the action of a 
certain set of transformations. For instance, Euchdean plane geometry is 
the study of the plane figures and of their properties that are invariant 
under similarity 
transformations. 
Given a metric space (X, d), a property of an object defined in terms of 
the set operations in X and of the metric of X is a metric property of X, for 
instance whether {xn} C X is convergent or not is a metric property of X. 
More generally, in the class of metric spaces, the natural transformations 
are those h : (X, dx) -^ {Y, dy) that are one-to-one and do not change the 
distances dy{h{x)^h{x)) 
= dx{x,y). 
Also two metric spaces (X,d) and 
(y, d) are said to be isometric if there exists an isometry between them. 
A metric invariant is a predicate defined on a class of metric spaces that 
is true (respectively, false) for all spaces isometric with (X, d) whenever 
it is true (false) for (X, d). With this languange, the metric properties 
that make sense for a class of metric spaces, being evidently preserved by 
isometrics, are metric invariants. And the Geometry of Metric Spaces^ that 
is the study of metric spaces, of their metric properties, is in fact the study 
of metric invariants. 
5.103 %, Let {X,di) 
and (K,^2) be two metric spaces and denote them respectively, 
by Bi{x^ r) and B2{x, r) the ball centered at x and radius r respectively, for the metrics 
di and d2. Show that a one-to-one map /i : X —>> K is an isometry if and only if the 
action of h preserves the balls, i.e., 
h{Bi{x,r)) 
= B2{h{x),r) 
Vx G X,Vr > 0. 
Similarly, given a topological space (X, rx), a property of an object 
defined in terms of the set operations and open sets of X is called a topo-
logical property of X, for instance being an open or closed subset, being 

184 
5. Metric Spaces and Continuous Functions 
the closure or boundary of a subset, or being a convergent sequence in X 
are topological properties of X. 
In the class of topological spaces, the natural group of transforma-
tions is the group of homeomorphisms, that are precisely all the one-to-
one maps whose actions preserve the open sets. Two topological spaces are 
said homeomorphic if there is a homeomorphism from one to the other. A 
topological invariant is a predicate defined on a class of topological spaces 
that is true (false) in any topological space that is homeomorphic to X 
whenever it is true (false) on X. With this language, topological properties 
that make sense for a class of topological spaces, being evidently preserved 
by the homeomorphims, are topological invariants. And the topology, that 
is the study of objects and of their properties that are preserved by the 
action of homeomorphisms, is in fact the study of topological invariants. 
b. Topologizing a set 
On a set X we may introduce several topologies, that is subsets 
o{V{X). 
Since such subsets are ordered by inclusion, topologies are partially ordered 
by inclusion. On one hand, we may consider the indiscrete topology r = 
{0, X} in which no other sets than 0 and X are open, thus there are no 
"small" neighborhoods. On the other hand, we can consider the discrete 
topology in which any subset is an open set, r = T^iX), thus any point is 
an open set. There is a kind of general procedure to introduce a topology 
in such a way that the sets of a given family £ CV{X) 
are all open sets. 
Of course we can take the discrete topology but what is significant is the 
smallest family of subsets r that contains £ and is closed with respect to 
finite intersections and arbitrary unions. This is called the coarser topology 
or the weaker topology for which f C r. It is unique and can be obtained 
adding possibly to £ the empty set, X, the finite intersections of elements 
of £ and the arbitrary union of these finite intersections. This previous 
construction is necessary, but in general it is quite complicated and £ loses 
control on r, since r builds up from finite intersections of elements of 
£. However, if the family £ has the following property, as for instance it 
happens for the balls of a metric space, this can be avoided. 
A basis S of X is a family of subsets of X with the following property: 
for every couple Ua and Up e 13 there is U^ e B such that Uj 
cUaf^Up. 
We have the following. 
5.104 Proposition. Let B = {Ua} he a basis for X. Then the family 
T consisting of ^, X and all the unions of members of B is the weaker 
topology in X containing B. 
c. Separation properties 
It is worth noticing that several separation properties that are trivial in a 
metric space do not hold, in general, in a topological space. The following 
claims, 
o sets consisting of a single points are closed, 

5.3 Completeness 
185 
o for any two distinct points x and y G X there exist disjoint open sets A 
and B such that x ^ A and y E B, 
o for any x e X and closed set F C X there exist disjoint open sets A 
and B such that x G A and F C B. 
o for any pair of disjoint closed sets E and F there exist disjoint open sets 
A and B such that E C A and F C B, 
are all true in a metric space, but do not hold in the indiscrete topology. A 
topological space is called a Hausdorff topological space if (ii) holds, regular 
if (iii) holds and normal if (iv) holds. It is easy to show that (i) and (iv) 
imply (iii), (i) and (iii) imply (ii), and (ii) implies (i). 
We conclude by stating a theorem that ensures that a topological space 
be metrizable, i.e., when we can introduce a metric on it so that the topol-
ogy is the one induced by the metric. 
5.105 Theorem (Uryshon). A topological space X with a countable ba-
sis is metrizable if and only if it is regular. 
5.3 Completeness 
a. Complete metric spaces 
5.106 Definition. A sequence {xn} with values in a metric space {X,d) 
is a Cauchy sequence if 
Ve > 0 3 1/ such that d{xn^Xm) < ^ ^n^m > v. 
It is easily seen that 
5.107 Proposition. In a metric space 
(i) every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence, 
(ii) any subsequence of a Cauchy sequence is again a Cauchy sequence, 
(iii) if {xk^} is a subsequence of a Cauchy sequence {xn} such that Xk^ -^ 
XQ, then Xn —> XQ. 
5.108 Definition. A metric space (X, d) is called complete if every 
Cauchy sequence converges in X. 
By definition, a Cauchy sequence and a complete metric space are met-
ric invariants. 
With Definition 5.108, Theorems 2.35 and 4.23 of [GM2] read as R, 
R^, C are complete metric spaces. Moreover, since 
n 
\xi\, 
\X21 . . . , \Xn\ < \\x\\ < ^ 
\Xi\ 
VX = (Xi, X2, . . . , Xn), 
2 = 1 

186 
5. Metric Spaces and Continuous Functions 
{xk} C M.^ or C"^ is a convergent sequence (respectively, Cauchy sequence) 
if and only if the sequences of coordinates {x^},2 = l , . . . , n are convergent 
sequences (Cauchy sequences). Thus 
5.109 Theorem. For all n > 1, W^ and C^ endowed with the Euclidean 
metric are complete metric spaces. 
b. Completion of a metric space 
Several useful metric spaces are complete. Notice that closed sets of a com-
plete metric space are complete metric spaces with the induced distance. 
However, there are noncomplete metric spaces. The simplest significant ex-
amples are of course the open intervals of R and the set of rational numbers 
with the Euclidean distance. 
Let X be a metric space. A complete metric space X* is called a com-
pletion of X if 
(i) X is isometric to a subspace X of X*, 
(ii) X is dense in X*, i.e., clX = X*. 
We have the following. 
5.110 Theorem (HausdorfF). Every metric space X has a completion 
and any two completions of X are isometric. 
Though every noncomplete metric space can be regarded as a subspace 
of its completion, it is worth remarking that from an effective point of view 
the real problem is to realize a suited handy model of this completion. For 
instance, the Hausdorff model, when apphed to rationals, constructs the 
completion as equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rationals, instead of 
real numbers. In the same way, the Hausdorff procedure applied to a metric 
space X of functions produces a space of equivalence classes of Cauchy 
sequences. It would be desirable to obtain another class of functions as 
completion, instead. But this can be far from trivial. For instance a space 
of functions that is the completion of C°([0,1]) with the L^([0,1]) distance 
can be obtained by the Lebesgue integration theory. 
5.111 %, Show that a closed set F of a complete metric space is complete with the 
induced metric. 
5.112 f. Let (X,d) 
be a metric space and A C X. Show that the closure of A is a 
completion of A. 
Proof of Theorem 5.110. In fact we outline the main steps leaving to the reader the 
task of completing the arguments. 
(i) We consider the family of all Cauchy sequences of X and we say that two Cauchy 
sequences {yn} and {zn} are equivalent if d{yn,Zn) 
-^ 0 (i.e., if, a posteriori, 
{yn} 
and {zn} "have the same limit"). Denote by X the set of equivalence classes obtained 
this way. Given two classes of equivalence Y and Z in X, let {yn} and {zn} be two 
representatives respectively of Y and Z. Then one sees 

5.3 Completeness 
187 
Figure 5.19. Felix Hausdorff (1869-1942) and Rene-Louis Baire (1874-1932). 
(i) {d{zn,yn)} 
is a Cauchy sequence of real numbers, hence converges to a real num-
ber. Moreover, such a limit does not depend on the representatives {yn} e {zn} 
of Y and Z, so that 
d{zn,yn) 
-^ 
diZ,Y). 
(ii) (i(y, Z) is a distance in X. 
(ii) Let X be the subspace of X of the equivalence classes of the constant sequences 
with values in X. It turns out that X is isometric to X. Let Y e X and let {yn} be a 
representative of Y. Denote by Yu the class of all Cauchy sequences that are equivalent 
to the constant sequence {zn} where Zn := yu ^'n. Then it is easily seen that Y^ ^>^ Y 
in X and that X is dense in X. 
(iii) Let {Yu} be a Cauchy sequence in X. For all u we choose Zu ^ X such that 
d{Yu, Zu) < 1/^' and we let Zu ^ X he Q. representative of Z^. Then we see that 
{z^} 
is a Cauchy sequence in X and, if Z is the equivalence class of {zu}^ then Y^ —> Z. 
This proves that X is complete. 
(iv) It remains to prove that any two completions are isometric. 
Suppose that X and X are two completions of X. With the above notation, we find 
X C X and X (Z X that are isometric and one-to-one with X. Therefore X and X 
are isometric and in a one-to-one correspondence. Because X is dense in X and X are 
dense respectively in X and X it is not difficult to extend the isometry i \ X ^ X to 
an isometry between X and X. 
D 
c. Equivalent metrics 
Completeness is a metric invariant and not a topological invariant. This 
means that isometric spaces are both complete or noncomplete and that 
there exist metric spaces X and Y that are homeomorphic, but X is com-
plete and Y is noncomplete. In fact, homeomorphisms preserve convergent 
sequences but not Cauchy sequences. 
5.113 Example. Consider X :— 
endowed with the distance 
endowed with the Euclidean metric and Y : = 
d{x,y) 
l + l^l 
i + |y|| 

188 
5. Metric Spaces and Continuous Functions 
X and Y are homeomorphic, a homeomorphism being given by the map h{x) := jirr^y 
x G R. In particular both distances give rise to the same converging sequences. However 
the sequence {n} is not a Cauchy sequence for the EucHdean distance, but it is a Cauchy 
sequence for the metric d since for n, m G N, m > n 
d(m, n) = 
< 1 
>^ 0 
per 1/ —» oo. 
- 
1 + n 
11 4- n 
1 H- m 
Since {n} does not converge in (M, d), Y = (R, d) is not complete. 
Homeomorphic, but nonisometric spaces can sometimes have the same 
Cauchy sequences. A sufficient condition ensuring that Cauchy sequences 
with respect to different metrics on the same set X are the same, is that 
the two metrics be equivalent, i.e., there exist constants Ai,A2 > 0 such 
that 
Aidi(x,2/) < d2{x,y) 
< 
\2di{x,y). 
5.114 %, Show that two metric spaces which are equivalent are also topologically equiv-
alent, compare Proposition 5.86. 
d. The nested sequence theorem 
An extension of Cantor's principle or the nested intervals theorem in R, 
see [GM2], holds in a complete metric space. 
5.115 Proposition. Let {Ek} he a monotone-decreasing sequence of non-
empty sets, i.e., ^ ^ Ek-\-\ C Ek^k 
= 0,1,..., 
in a complete metric space 
X. //diam (Ek) —^ 0, then there exists one and only one point x E X with 
the following property: any ball centered at x contains one, and therefore 
infinitely many of the Ek 's. Moreover, if all the Ek are closed, then DkEk = 
{x}. 
As a special case we have the following. 
5.116 Corollary. In a complete metric space a sequence of nested closed 
balls with diameters that converge to zero have a unique common point. 
Notice that the conclusion of Corollary 5.116 does not hold if the diameters 
do not converge to zero: for Ek := [k, +oo[c M we have 0 ^^ Ek^i C Ek 
and CikEk = 0. 
5.117 ^. Prove Proposition 5.115. 
e. Baire's theorem 
5.118 Theorem (Baire). Let X be a complete metric space that can be 
written as a denumerable union of closed sets {Ei}, X = U^^Ei. Then at 
least one of the Ei's contains a ball of X. 

5.3 Completeness 
189 
Proof. Suppose that none of the EiS contains a ball of X and let x\ ^ E\\ Since 
Ei is closed, there is r\ such that cl(S(xi,ri)) n £"1 = 0 . Inside cl (B(a;i,ri/2)) 
there is now X2 ^ E2 (otherwise cl (B(xi,ri/2)) C E2 which is a contradiction) 
and r2 such that c\{B{x2,r2)) 
H E2 = 0 , also we may choose r2 < r i / 2 . Iterat-
ing this procedure we find a monotonic-decreasing family of closed balls 
{B{xk,rk)}, 
cl{B{xi,ri)) 
D cl(B(x2,r2)) D • • • such that cl(B(xn,rn)) fl J5n = 0. Thus the com-
mon point to all these balls, that exists by Corollary 5.116, would not belong to any of 
the En, a contradiction. 
D 
An equivalent formulation is the following. 
5.119 Proposition. In a complete metric space, the denumerable inter-
section of open dense sets of a complete metric space X is dense in X. 
5.120 Definition. A subset A of a metric space X is said nowhere dense 
if its closure has no interior point, 
intcl(^) = 0 , 
equivalently, if X\A 
is dense in X. A set is called meager or of the first 
category if it can he written as a countable union of nowhere dense sets. 
If a set is not of the first category, then we say that it is of the second 
category. 
5.121 Proposition. In a complete metric space a meager set has no in-
terior point, or, equivalently, its complement is dense. 
Proof. Let {An} be a family such that intclAn = 0. Suppose there is an open set U 
with U C Un^n. Prom U C UnAn C On An we deduce HnAn^ C U^. Baire's theorem, 
see Proposition 5.119, then implies that U^ is dense. Since U^ is closed, we conclude 
that U"" = X i.e., U = 0. 
D 
5.122 Corollary. A complete metric space is a set of second category. 
This form of Baire's theorem is often used to prove existence results or to 
show that a certain property is generic^ i.e., holds for "almost all points" 
in the sense of the category, i.e., that the set 
X\{xeX\p{x) 
holds} 
is a meager set. In this way one can show^, see also Chapters 9 and 10, 
the following. 
5.123 Proposition. The class of continuous functions on the interval 
[0,1] which have infinite right-derivative at every point, are of second cat-
egory in C^([0,1]) with the uniform distance; in particular, there exist 
continuous functions that are nowhere differentiable. 
Finally we notice that, though for a meager set A we have int A = 0, we 
may have intclA ^ 0: consider A := Q C M.

6. Compactness and 
Connectedness 
In this chapter we shall discuss, still in the metric context, two important 
topological invariants: compactness and connectedness. 
6.1 Compactness 
Let E be a subset of M?. We ask ourselves whether there exists a point 
xo E E oi maximal distance from the origin. Of course E needs to be 
bounded, sup^.^^; d(0, x) < -foo, if we want a positive answer, and it is 
easily seen that if E is not closed, our question may have a negative answer, 
for instance ii E = 5(0,1). Assuming E bounded and closed, how can 
we prove existence? We can find a maximizing sequence, i.e., a sequence 
{xn} C E such that 
d(0,Xfc) —> supd(0,x), 
and our question has a positive answer if {xk} is converging or, at least, if 
{xk} has a subsequence that converges to some point XQ G E. In fact, in 
this case, d(0,a:jfc^) -^ d(0,a;o), x -^ d{0,x) is continuous, and d(0, Xn^) —^ 
sup^^^(i(0,x), too, thus concluding that 
d(0,xo) = supd(0,x).

6.1.1 Compact spaces 
a. Sequential compactness 
6.1 Definition. Let (X^d) be a metric space. A subset K C X is said 
to be sequentially compact if every sequence {xk} C K has a subsequence 
{xuk} that converges to a point of K. 
Necessary conditions for compactness are stated in the following

6.2 Proposition. PFe have 
(i) ^ni/ sequentially compact metric space (X, d) zs complete; 
(ii) ^n^/ sequentially compact subset of a metric space {X, d) is hounded, 
closed, and complete with the induced metric. 
Proof, (i) Let {x^} C X be a Cauchy sequence. Sequential compactness allows us to 
extract a convergent subsequence; since {x^} is Cauchy, the entire sequence converges, 
see Proposition 5.107. 
(ii) Let K be sequentially compact. Every point x 6 K is the limit of a sequence with 
values in K\ by assumption x £ K, thus K = K and K is closed. Suppose that K is 
not bounded. Then there is a sequence {xn} C K such that d(xi,Xj) 
> 1 Vi, j . Such 
a sequence has no convergent subsequences, a contradiction. Finally, K is complete by 
(i). 
D 
b. Compact sets in R^ 
In general, bounded and closed sets of a metric space are not sequentially 
compact. However we have 
6.3 Theorem. InW^, n > 1, a set is sequentially compact if and only if 
it is closed and bounded. 
This follows from 
6.4 Theorem (Bolzano—Weierstrass). Any infinite and bounded sub-
set E ofW^, n>l, 
has at least a point of accumulation. 

6.1 Compactness 
199 
Proof. Since E is bounded, there is a cube Co of side L, so that 
£ C Co := \af\bf^] 
X ... X [a^f^.b'"'], 
bf' - a f > = L. 
Since £J is infinite, if we divide CQ in 2^ equal subcubes, one of them 
C i : = [ a W , 6 W l x . . . x [ a « , 6 W ] , 
6 ^ ' - a ^ = L/2, 
contains infinitely many elements of E. By induction, we divide Ci in 2^ equal subcubes 
with no common interiors, and choose one of them, Ci-|-i, that contains infinitely many 
elements oi E. If 
Q := [a<t\bf\ 
x ... X [a<i\b<i'^\ 
fef' 
- af' = 
L/2\ 
the vertices of Cj converge, 
<^^^'bf 
^ 
« r . 6 r 
and 
a r = 6 r 
since for each k = l , . . . , n the sequences {a^'^^^} and {b^^^^^} are real-valued Cauchy 
sequences. The point a := (af^,..., a^) 
is then an accumulation point for E, since for 
any r > 0, Ci C B(a, r) for i sufficiently large. 
• 
Another useful consequence of Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem is 
6.5 Theorem. Any bounded sequence {xk} ofW^ has a convergent sub-
sequence. 
Proof. If {xk} takes finitely many values, then at least one of them, say a, is taken 
infinitely often. If {pfclfceN are the indices such that Xp^ = a, then {xpj^} converges, 
since it is constant. Assume now that {xk} takes infinitely many values. The Bolzano-
Weierstrass theorem yields a point of accumulation Xoo for these values. Now we choose 
pi as the first index for which Ixp^ — Xoo| < 1, P2 as the first index greater than pi such 
that \xp2 — Xc»| < 1/2 and so on: then {xp^} is a subsequence of {xn} and Xp^ -^ Xoo. 
D 
c. Coverings and €-nets 
There are other ways to express compactness. 
Let A be a subset of a metric space X. A covering of A is a, family 
A = {Ac} of subsets of X such that A C Ua^a- We have already said 
that A = {Aa} is din open covering of A if each A^ is an open set, and 
that {Aa} is a finite covering of A if the number of the A^'s is finite. A 
subcovering of a covering ^ of A is a subfamily of A that is still a covering 
of A 
6.6 Definition. We say that a subset A of a metric space X is totally 
bounded if for any e > 0 there is a finite number of balls 
B{xi,e), 
i = 1,2,...,A/" of radius e, each centered at xi G X, such that A C 
uiIiB(a;i,€). 
For a given e > 0, the corresponding balls are said to form an e-covering 
of A^ and their centers, characterized by the fact that each point of A has 
distance less than e from some of the x^'s, form a set {xi) called an e-net 
for A. With this terminology A is totally bounded iff for every e > 0 there 
exists an e-net for A. Notice also that A C X is totally bounded if and 
only if for every e > 0 there exists a finite covering {Ai} oi X with sets 
having diam Ai < e. 

200 
6. Compactness and Connectedness 
6.7 Definition. We say that a subset K of a metric space is compact if 
every open covering of K contains a finite subcovering. 
We have the following. 
6.8 Theorem. Let X be a metric space. The following claims are equiv-
alent. 
(i) X is sequentially compact. 
(ii) X is complete and totally bounded. 
(iii) X is compact. 
The implication (ii) => (i) is known as the Hausdorff criterion and the 
implication (i) => (iii) as the finite covering lemma. 
Proof, (i) =^ (ii) By Proposition 6.2, X is complete. Suppose X is not totally bounded. 
Then for some r > 0 no finite family of balls of radius r can cover X. Start with 
xi € X; since B(a;i,r) does not cover X, there is X2 G X such that d{x2,xi) 
> r. Since 
{B{xi,r), 
S(x2,r)} does not cover X either, there is X3 G X such that d{xs,xi) 
> r 
and d{xs,X2) > r. By induction, we construct a sequence {xi] such that d(xi,Xj) 
> r 
"ii > j , hence d{xi,Xj) 
> r Vi, j . Such a sequence has no convergent subsequence, but 
this contradicts the assumption. 
(ii) => (iii) By contradiction, suppose that X has an open covering A = {Aa} with no 
finite subcovering. Since X is totally bounded, there exists a finite covering {Ci} of K, 
n 
\ \ Ci = X, 
such that 
diam Ci < 1, 
i = 1,..., n. 
1 = 1 
By the assumption, there exists at least ki such that A has no finite subcovering for 
Cki • Of course Xi := C^j is a metric space which is totally bounded; therefore we can 
cover Cki with finitely many open sets with diameter less than 1/2, and A has no finite 
subcovering for one of them that we call X2. By induction, we construct a sequence 
{Xi} of subsets of X with 
XiD 
X2D 
-•' , 
diamXi < 1/2% 
such that none of them can be covered by finitely many open sets of A. Now we choose 
for each k a point x^ G Xk. Since {xk} is trivially a Cauchy sequence and X is complete, 
{xfc} converges to some XQ E X. Let AQ E Abe such that XQ E A and let r be such that 
B{xo,r) 
C A {A is an open set). For k suflficiently large we then have d(xk,xo) 
< r for 
all X G Xk, i.e., X^ C B(xo,r) 
C AQ. In conclusion, Xk is covered by one open set in 
A, a contradiction since by construction no finite subcovering of A could cover Xk • 
(iii) => (i) If, by contradiction, {xk} has no convergent subsequence, then {xk} is an 
infinite set without points of accumulation in X. For every x E X there is a ball 
B{x,rx) 
centered at x that contains at most one point of {xk}- The family of these 
balls J' := {B{Xyrx)}x£X 
is an open covering of X with no finite subcovering of {xk} 
hence of X, contradicting the assumption. 
D 
6.9 Remark. Clearly the notions of compactness and sequential compactness are topo-
logical notions. They have a meaning in the more general setting of topological spaces, 
while the notion of totally bounded sets is just a metric notion. We shall not deal with 
compactness in topological spax:es. We only mention that compactness and sequential 
compactness are not equivalent in the context of topological spaces.

6.1.2 Continuous functions and compactness 
a. The Weierstrass theorem 
As in [GM2], continuity of / : K ^ M and compactness of K yield existence 
of a minimizer.

f{x-) 
= inf /(x), 
/(x+) = sup f{x) 
^€X 
xex 
are called respectively, a minimum point or a minimizer and a maximum 
point or a maximize! for / : X ^ R. 
A sequence {xk} C X such that f{xk) -^ inixex f{x) fresp. f{xk) -^ 
^^Pxex fi^)) 
^^ called a minimizing sequence fresp. a maximizing se-
quence/ 
Notice that any function / : X ^ R defined on a set X has a minimiz-
ing and a maximizing sequence. In fact, because of the properties of the 
infimum, there exists a sequence {yk} C f{X) such that yk -^ infa^^x /(^) 
(that may be — oo), and for each k there exists a point Xk E X such that 
f{xk) = yk, hence f{xk) -> inf^ex f{x). 
6.14 Theorem (Weierstrass). Let f : X -^ R be a continuous real-

maximum and minimum values, i.e., there exists a:_,x+ G X such that

(resp. maximum) point.

6. Compactness and Connectedness 
b. Continuity and compactness 
Compactness and sequential compactness are topological invariants. In 
fact, we have the following. 
6.15 Theorem. Let f : X -^ Y be a continuous function between two 
metric spaces. If X is compact, then f(X) is compact. 
Proof. Let {Va} be an open covering of f{X). Since / is continuous, {/"^(Va)} is an 
open convering of X. Consequently, there are indices a i , . . . , aj^ such that 
XCf-HVa,)U...UrHVa^), 
hence 
f(X)CVa,U...UVaj,, 
i.e., f{X) is compact. 
• 
Another proof of Theorem 6.15. Let us prove that f{X) is sequentially compfict when-
ever X is sequentially compact. If {yn} C f{X) and {xn} C X is such that f{xn) = y-n 
\fn, since X is sequentially compact, a subsequence {x^^} of {xn} converges to a point 
XQ G X. By continuity, the subsquence {f(xk^)} 
of {yn} converges to f{xo) E 
f(X). 
Then Theorem 6.8 applies. 
• 
6.16 t- Infer Theorem 6.14 from Theorem 6.15. 
6.17 %, Suppose that E is a. noncompact metric space. Show that there exist 
(i) f : E -^R continuous and unbounded, 
(ii) f : E —^M. continuous and bounded without maximizers and/or minimizers. 
c. Continuity of the inverse function 
Compactness also plays an important role in dealing with the continuity 
of the inverse function of invertible maps. 
6.18 Theorem. Let f : X —^ Y be a continuous function between two 
metric spaces. If X is compact, then f is a closed function. In particular, 
if f is infective, then the inverse funcion f~^ : f{X) —^ X is continuous. 
Proof. Let F C X he a. closed set. Since X is compact, F is compact. Prom Theo-
rem 6.15 we then infer that f{F) is compsict, hence closed. 
Suppose / injective and let g : f{X) 
—^ X he the inverse of / . We then have 
9~'^{E) = f{E) "iE C X, hence g'^^iF) is a closed set if F is a closed set in X. 
D 
6.19 Corollary. Let f : X -^Y be a one-to-one, continuous map between 
two metric spaces. If X is compact, then f is a homeomorphism. 
6.20 Example. The following example shows that the assumption of compactness in 
Theorem 6.18 cannot be avoided. Let X = [0, 27r[, Y he the unit circle of C centered 
at the origin and f{t) := e**, t G X. Clearly f{t) — cost + isint 
is continuous and 
injective, but its inverse function f~^ is not continuous at the point (1,0) = /(O).

6.1.3 Semicontinuity and the 
Frechet-Weierstrass theorem 
Going through the proof of Weierstrass's theorem we see that a weaker 
assumption suffices to prove existence of a minimizer. In fact, if instead of 
the continuity of / we assume^ 
/ ( ^ - ) < hminf /(x^), 
whenever {xk} is such that Xk -^ x_, 
(6.1) 
then for any convergent subsequence {xn^} of a minimizing sequence, 
Xrik -^ ^ 0 ,

we have 
inf f{x) < f{xo) < hminf / ( x ^ J = lim / ( x ^ J = inf/(x), 
x£X 
AC—>oo 
k-^oo 
xEX 
i.e., again /(XQ) = inf^GX /(^)- We therefore introduce the following def-
initions. 
6.21 Definition. We say that a function / : X ^ R defined on a metric 
space X is sequentially lower semicontinuous at x G X, s.l.s.c. for short, 
if 
/(x) < liminf/(xfc) 
whenever {xk} C X is such that Xk -^ x. 
fc—»-oo 
6.22 Definition. We_say that a subset E of a metric space X is relatively 
compact if its closure E is compact. 
6.23 Definition. Let X be a metric space. We say that f : X -^ R is 
coercive if for allteR 
the level sets of f, 
[xex\ 
fix) < t] 
are relatively compact. 
Then we can state the following. 
6.24 Theorem (Frechet-Weierstrass). Let X be a metric space and 
let f : X ^^ R be bounded from below, coercive and sequentially lower 
semicontinuous. Then f takes its minimum value. 
^ See Exercises 6.26 and 6.28 for the definition of lim inf and related information.

6. Compactness and Connectedness 
Figure 6.2. Lebesgue's example of a sequence of curves of length \/2 that converges in 
the uniform distance to a curve of length 1. 
6.25 Example. There are many interesting examples of functions that are semicontin-
uous but not continuous: a typical example is the length of a curve. Though we postpone 
details, Lebesgue's example in Figure 6.2 shows that the function length, defined on the 
space of piecewise linear curves with the uniform distance, is not continuous. In fact 
length(/fc) = \/2, fkix) 
-^ fooix) := 0 uniformly in [0,1], and length(/oo) = 1 < 27r. We 
shall prove later that in fact the length functional is sequentially lower semicontinuous. 
6.26 %, We say that f : X —>• R is lower semicontinuous, 
for short l.s.c., if for all 
t G M the sets {x G X \ f(x) < t} are closed. Sequential lower semicontinuity and lower 
semicontinuity are topological concepts; they turn out to be different, in general. Show 
that if X is a metric space, then / is lower semicontinuous if and only if / is sequentially 
semicontinuous. 
6.27 f. Let X be a metric space. We recall, see e.g., [GM2], that ^ G M is the liminf

(ii) V m > ^ V ( 5 > 0 3 2/5G B{x, 5) \ {x) such that f{ys) < m. 
Show that the lim inf always exists and is given by 
liminf / (2/)= sup

f{y). 
Similarly we can define the lim sup of / : X —> R, so that 
lim sup/(y) = — lim inf (—/(x)).

6.2 Extending Continuous Functions 
205 
6.2 Extending Continuous Functions 
6.2.1 Uniformly continuous functions 
6.29 Definition. Let {X,dx) 
and {Y^dy) be two metric spaces. We say 
that f : X —^Y is uniformly continuous in X if for any e > 0 there exists 
6 > 0 such that dy(/(x), f{y)) < e for all x^y £ X with dx{x,y) 
< 5. 
6.30 Remark. Uniform continuity is a global property, in contrast with 
continuity (at all points) which is a local property. A comparison is worth-
while 
(i) / : X —> y is continuous if Vxo G X , V e > 0 3 ( 5 > 0 ( i n principle 5 
depends on e and XQ) dy{f (X), f (XQ)) < e whenever dx{x,xo) 
< S. 
(ii) / : X -^ y is uniformly continuous in X if Ve > 0 35 > 0 (in this 
case S depends on e but not on XQ) dy {f {X)^ f (XQ)) < e whenever 
dx{x,xo) 
< S. 
Of course, if / is uniformly continuous in X, / is continuous in X and 
uniformly continuous on any subset of X. Moreover if {Ua} is a finite 
partition of X and each F^u^ : Ua -^ Y is uniformly continuous in [/«? 
then / : X -^ y is uniformly continuous in X. 
6.31 %, Show that Lipschitz-continuous and more generally Holder-continuous func-
tions, see Definition 5.24, are uniformly continuous functions. 
6.32 ^. Show that f : X ^^ Y is not uniformly continuous in X if and only if there 
exist two sequences {xn}, 
{Vn} C X and eo > 0 such that dx{xn^yn) 
-^ 0 and 
dY{f{xn),f{yn)) 
> eo Vn. 
6.33 % Show that 
(i) x^ and sinx^, x G M, are not uniformly continuous in R, 
(ii) 1/x is not uniformly continuous in ]0,1], 
(iii) sin x^, x E M, is not uniformly continuous in M. 
Using directly Lagrange's theorem, show that 
(iii) x'^, x G [0,1], is uniformly continuous in [0,1], 
(iv) e~^, X G M, is uniformly continuous in [0, +oo[. 
6.34 f. Let X, y be two metric spaces and let / : X —>> y be uniformly continuous. 
Show that the image of a Cauchy sequence is a Cauchy sequence on Y. 
6.35 Theorem (Heine-Cantor-Borel). Let f : X -^ Y be a contin-
uous map between metric spaces. If X is compact^ then f is uniformly 
continuous. 

206 
6. Compactness and Connectedness 
Proof. By contradiction, suppose that / is not uniformly continuous. Then there is 
eo > 0, and two sequences {xn}, {Vn} C X such that 
dx(xn,yn) 
< - , 
and 
dvUi^n), 
f{yn)) > eo Vn. 
(6.2) 
n 
Since X is compact, {xn} has a convergent subsequence, x^^ -^ x, x E X. The first 
inequality in (6.2) yields that {y^ } converges to x, too. On account of the continuity 
of/, 
dY{f(xkJ,f{x))^0, 
dY{f{ykJ,fix))^0, 
hence dY{f{xk^)^f{yk^)) 
-^ 0: this contradicts the second inequality in (6.2). 
D 
6.2.2 Extending uniformly continuous 
functions to the closure of their domains 
Let X, Y be metric spaces, E C X and / : £" ^ F be a continuous 
function. Under which conditions is there a continuous extension of / over 
£•, i.e., a continuous g : E -^ Y such that g = f in E? Notice that we do 
not want to change the target Y. Of course, such an extension may not 
exist, for instance if ^ =]0,1] and f{x) = 1/x, x G]0, 1]. On the other hand, 
if it exists, it is unique. In fact, if gi and g2 : E —> Y are two continuous 
extensions, then A := {x e E\gi{x) 
= ^2(^)} is closed and contains E^ 
hence A = E. 
6.36 Theorem. Let X and Y be two metric spaces. Suppose that Y is 
complete and that f : E C X —^ Y is a uniformly continuous map. Then 
f extends uniquely to a continuous function on E; moreover the extension 
is uniformly continuous in E. 
Proof. First we observe 
(i) since / is uniformly continuous in E, if {xn} is a Cauchy sequence in E, then 
{f{xn)} 
is a Cauchy sequence in y , hence it converges in Y, 
(ii) since / is uniformly continuous, if {xn} {yn} C E are such that Xn ^>- x and 
y-n ^^ X for some x £ X^ then the Cauchy sequences {f{xn)} 
and {f(yn)} 
have 
the same limit. 
Define F : ^ —> y as follows. For any x ^ E, let {xn} C E he such that Xn —^ x. Define 
F{x) := lim /(xn). 
We then leave to the reader the task of proving that 
(i) F is welldefined, i.e., its definition makes sense, since for any x the value F{x) is 
independent of the chosen sequence {xn} converging to x, 
(ii) F{x) = f{x)\^xeE, 
_ 
(iii) F is uniformly continuous in E, 
(iv) F extends / , i.e., F{x) = f(x)\/x 
G E. 
D 
6.37 %. As a special case of Theorem 6.36, we notice that a function f : E C X 
^ 
y , which is uniformly continuous on a dense subset E C X, extends to a uniformly 
continuous function defined on the whole X. 

6.2 Extending Continuous Functions 
207 
6.2.3 Extending continuous functions 
Let X, Y be metric spaces, E C X and f : E -^Y 
he a, continuous func-
tion. Under which conditions can / be extended to a continuous function 
F : X ^ y? This is a basic question for continuous maps. 
a. Lipschitz-continuous functions 
We first consider real-valued Lipschitz-continuous maps, f : E C X —^ R. 
6.38 Theorem (McShane). Let (X, d) be a metric space, E C X and 
let f : E ^^R be a Lipschitz map. Then there exists a Lipschitz-continuous 
map F : X ^ R with the same Lipschitz constant as f, which extends f. 
Proof. Let L := Lip (/). For a: 6 X let us define 
F{x):= 
ini (f{y) + 
Ld{x,y)) 
yeE \ 
/ 
and show that it has the required properties. For x £ E v/e clearly have F{x) < 
f(x) 
while, / being Lipschitz, gives 
f{x)<f{y) 
+ Ld{x,y) 
"iy e E, 
i.e., f(x) < F{x), thus concluding that F(x) = f(x) Vx € E. 
Moreover, we have 
F{x) < inf (f{z) + L d(y, z)) + L d{x, y) = F{y) + L d{x, y) 
and similarly 
F{y)<F{x)-^Ld{x,y). 
Hence F is Lipschitz continuous with Lip (F) < L. As F is an extension of / , we trivially 
have Lip (F) > L, thus concluding Lip (F) = L. 
• 
The previous theorem allows us to extend vector-valued Lipschitz-
continuous maps f : E C X -^ R"^, but the Lipschitz extension will 
have, in principle, a Lipschitz constant less than y/mLip{f). 
Actually, a 
more elaborated argument allows us to prove the following. 
6.39 Theorem (Kirszbraun). Let f : E C R'' -> W^ be a Lipschitz-
continuous map. Then f has an extension F :W^ -^ W^ such that Lip F = 
Lip/. 
In fact there exist several extensions of Kirszbraun's theorem that we 
will not discuss. We only mention that it may fail if either R'^ or R"^ is 
remetrized by some norm not induced by an inner product. 
6.40 If (Federer). Let X be R^ ^ith the infinity norm 11 x | ] oo — 
supdx^l + \x'^\) and 
the map f : AcX 
-^R'^, 
where A := {(-1,1), (1, - 1 ) , (1,1)} and 
/ ( - 1 , 1 ) := ( - 1 , 0), 
/ ( I , - 1 ) := (1, 0), 
/ ( I , 1) := (0, Vs). 
Show that Lip (/) = 1, but / has no 1-Lipschitz extension to A U {(0, 0)}. 

208 
6. Compactness and Connectedness 
6.2.4 Tietze's theorem 
An extension of Theorem 6.38 holds for continuous functions in a closed 
domain. 
6.41 Theorem (Tietze). Let X be a metric space, E C X be a closed 
subset of X, and f a continuous function from E into [—1,1] (respectively, 
R / Then f has a continuous extension from X into [—1,1] (respectively, 
R). 
Actually we have the following. 
6.42 Theorem (Dugundji). Let X he a metric space, E a closed subset of X and let 
f be a continuous function from E into W^. Then f has a continuous 
extension 
from 
X into W^; moreover the range of f is contained in the convex hull of 
f(E). 
We recall that the convex hull of a subset E CM."^ is the intersection of all convex 
sets that contain E. 
Proof of Tietze's theorem,. First assume that / is bounded. Then it is not restrictive to 
assume that inf^; / = 1 and sup^; f = 2. We shall prove that the function 
fix) 
iixe E, 
lix^E 
F{x):=liniy^E{f{y)d{x,y)) 
I 
d{x, E) 
is a continuous extension of / and 1 < F(a:) < 2 Vx € X. 
Since the last claim is trivial, we need to prove that F is continuous in X. Decompose 
X = \ntE\J 
{X\E)\J 
dE. If XQ 6 int E, then F is continuous at XQ by assumption. 
Let XQ ^ X\E.lii 
this case x -^ d{x,E) 
is continuous and strictly positive in an open 
neighborhood of XQ, therefore it suffices to prove that that h{x) := miy^E{fiy)d(x, 
y)) 
is continuous at XQ. We notice that for y E E and x, XQ € A' we have 
f(y)d{x,y) 
< f{y)d{xo,y) 
+ fiy)d{x,xo) 
< f(y)d(xo,y) 
+ 
2d{x,xo), 
hence 
h{x) < h{xo) 4- 2d(x, XQ) 
and, exchanging x with XQ, 
\h{x) — h{xo)\ < 2d{x,xo)-
This proves continuity of h a.t XQ. 
Let XQ e dE. For e > 0 let r > 0 be such that \f{y) — f{xo)\ 
< e provided 
d{y^ ^o) < r and y G E. For x G B{xo,r/4) 
we have 
^ o J " ^ 
„,(/(2/)d(^.J/)) < nxo)d{x,xo}

r.v J^^ 
. Sf{y)d{x,

E\B(xo,r/4)

Therefore we find for x with d(xo,x) 
< r/4, 
h{x) = inU f{y)d{x,y)) 
= 
inf 
f{y)d{x,y) 
yeE 
EnB{xo,r/4) 
and 
d{x, E) = d(x, E n B(xo, r/4)). 

6.2 Extending Continuous Functions 
209 
On the other hand, ior y £ E n B(xo, r) we have |/(a:o) — f{y)\ < ^ hence 
{f{xo) - €)d{x, E) < h{x) < {f{xo) + e)d{x, E) 
if a; G B{xo,r/4:), 
i.e., h{x) is continuous at XQ. 
Finally, if / is not bounded, we apply the above to g := (f o f, (f being the home-
omorphism (p : M —>]0,2[, (p{x) = ^ + Wi^TT)' 
^^ ^ extends continuously g, then 
F := (p~^ o G continuously extends / . 
• 
6.43 Remark. The extension F : X ^ R oi f : Ec 
X ^ R provided by 
Tietze's theorem is Lipschitz continuous outside E. 
Sketch of the proof of Theorem 6.42, assuming X = R^ and E C X compact.

6.45 f. Let E and F be two disjoint nonempty closed sets of a metric space 
{X,d). 
Using the function / in Exercise 6.44 show that there exist two open sets 
A.BcX 
with An B = 0, AD E and B D F. 
Indeed Exercise 6.45 has an inverse. 
6.46 Lemma (Uryshon lemma). Let X be a topological space such that each couple 
of disjoint closed sets can be separated by two open disjoint sets. Then, given a couple 
of disjoint closed sets E and F, there exists a continuous function 
/ : X —^ [0,1] such 
that f{x) = l'ixe 
E and f{x) = 0 Vx G F . 
This lemma answers the problem of finding nontrivial continuous functions in a 
topological space and is a basic step in the construction of the so-called partition 
or 
decomposition 
of unity, a means that allow us to pass from local to global constructions 
and vice versa. 
Since we shall not need these results in a general context, we refrain from further 
comments and address the reader to one of the treatises in general topology.

6.3 Connectedness 
Intuitively, a space is connected if it does not consist of two separate pieces. 
6.3.1 Connected spaces 
6.47 Definition. A metric space X is said to be connected if it is not the 
union of two nonempty disjoint open sets. A subset E C X is connected if 
it is connected as subspace of X. 
This can be formulated in other ways. For example we say_that two 
sets A and 5 of a metric space X are separated if both AilB and AnB are 
empty, i.e., no point of A is adherent to B and no point of B is adherent 
to A. 
6.48 Proposition. Let X be a metric space. The following properties are 
equivalent. 
(i) X is connected. 
(ii) There are no closed sets F,G in X such that F fl G = 0 and X = 
FUG. 
(iii) The only subsets of X both open and closed are 0 and X. 
(iv) X is not the union of two nonempty and separated subsets. 

6.3 Connectedness 
211 
Proof. Trivially (i) <^ (ii) ^ 
(iii). Let us prove that (i) =^ (iv). By contradiction, 
suppose X = AUB where A and_B are nonempty and separated. Prom An B = ^ and 
AUB = X we infer A C B^ and B^ C A, hence A = B^, i.e., A is an open set. Similarly 
we infer that B is open, concluding that X is not connected, a contradiction. Finally, 
let us prove that (iv) =^ (ii). By contradiction, assume that X is not connected. Then 
X = AuB with A, B closed, disjoint and nonempty, thus (AnB) = (AHB) = AnB = 0. 
Thus X is separated, a contradiction.

a. Connected subsets 
6.49 Theorem. E cR is connected if and only if E is an interval. 
Proof. If £• C M is not an interval, there exist x,y ^ E and z ^ E with x < z < y. Thus 
the sets Ei := ED] — oo,z[ and E2 := En]z,-\-oo[ are nonempty and separated. Since 
E = EiU E2, E is not connected, a contradiction. 
Conversely, if E is not connected, then E = AU B with A and B nonempty and 
separated. Let x £ A and y £ B and, without loss of generality, suppose x < y. Define 
z :=sup{An 
[x,y]). 
We have z £ A hence z ( B; in particular x < z < y. If z ^ A_then x < z < y and 
z ^ E, i.e., E is not an interval. Otherwise, if 2; € ^ , then z ( B and there exists zi 
such that z < zi <y and zi ( B but then x < zi < y with zi ^ E, thus once again, E 
is not an interval.

6.50 %. Show that the closure of a connected set is connected. 
6.51 %. Show that any subset of Q having more than one point is not connected. 
6.52 %, Let A and B be nonempty, disjoint and open sets of a metric space X such 
that X = AU B and let y be a connected subset of X. Then either Y C A or Y C B. 
6.53 %. Let {Ya} be a family of connected subsets of X such that flaVa / 0- Show 
that Y := UotYa is connected. [Hint: Argue by contradiction.] 
6.54 %. Let {Yn} be a sequence of connected subsets such that Yn n Yn-\-i 7^ 0 V n. 
Then Y := UnYn is connected. 
b. Connected components 
Because of Exercise 6.53, the following definition makes sense. 
6.55 Definition. Let X be a metric space. The connected component of 
X containing XQ E X is the largest connected subset CXQ of X such that 
6.56 Proposition. Let X be a metric space. We have the following. 
(i) The distinct connected components of the points of X form a partition 
ofX. 
(ii) Each connected component C C X is a closed set. 
(iii) Ifye 
Cx, then Cx =Cy. 

212 
6. Compactness and Connectedness 
(iv) If Y C X is a nonempty open and closed subset of X, then Y is a 
connected component of X. 
Observe that the connected components are not necessarily open. For in-
stance, consider X = Q for which Cx := {x} Va: G Q. 
Of particular interest are the locally connected metric spaces, i.e., spaces 
X for which for every x e X there exists r^ > 0 such that B{x,rx) is 
connected. 
6.57 Proposition. LetX be metric space. The following claims are equiv-
alent. 
(i) Each connected component is open. 
(ii) X is locally connected. 
Proof. Each point in X has a connected open neighborhood by (i), hence (ii) holds. 
Let C be a connected component of X, let a; G C and, by assumption, let B{x^rx) 
be 
a connected ball centered at x. As B{x^rx) 
is connected, trivially B{x^rx) 
C C, i.e., C 
is open. 
D 
6.58 Corollary. Every convex set ofW^ is connected. 
Proof. In fact every convex set iC C M^ is the union of all segments joining a fixed 
point xo €i K to points x ^ K. Then Exercise 6.53 applies. 
D 
The class of all connected sets of a metric space X is a topological 
invariant. This follows at once from the following. 
6.59 Theorem. Let f : X -^ Y be a continuous map between metric 
spaces. If X is connected, then f{X) cY 
is connected. 
Proof. Assume by contradiction that f{X) is not connected. Then there exist nojiempty 
open sets C,D CY 
such that CnDn 
f{X) 
= 0, (C U D) D f{X) = f{X). 
Since / 
is continuous, A := f~^{C), 
B := f~^(D) 
are nonempty open sets in A", such that 
An B = (d and AU B = X. A contradiction, since X is connected. 
D 
Since the intervals are the only connected subsets of M, we again find 
the intermediate value theorem of [GMl] and, more generally, 
6.60 Corollary. Let f : X ^^ R be a continuous function defined on a 
connected metric space. Then f takes all values between any two that it 
assumes. 
c. Segment-connected sets in M"^ 
In R'^ we can introduce a more restrictive notion of connectedness that in 
some respect is more natural. If x, y G M^, a polyline joining x to 2/ is the 
union of finitely many segments of the type 
[a:,Xi],[xi,X2],...,[a:Ar-i,y] 

6.3 Connectedness 
213 
where Xi e R'^ and [xi,Xi_j_i] denotes the segment joining Xi with Xi^i. It 
is easy to check that a polyUne joining x to y can be seen as the image 
or trajectory of a piecewise hnear function 7 : [0,1] —> W^. Notice that 
piecewise hnear functions are Lipschitz continuous. 
6.61 Definition. We say that A cW^ is segment-connected if each pair 
of its points can be joined by a polyline that lies entirely in A. 
If A[x] denotes the set of all points that can be joined to x by a polyline 
in A, we see that A is segment-connected if and only ifA = A[x]. Moreover 
we have the following. 
6.62 Proposition. Any segment-connected A CM.'^ is connected. 
Of course, not every connected set is segment-connected, indeed a cir-
cle in R^ is connected but not segment-connected. However, we have the 
following. 
6.63 Theorem. Let A be an nonempty open set ofW^. Then A is con-
nected if and only if A is segment-connected. 
Proof. Let XQ e A, let B := A[x] be the set of all points that can be connected with XQ 
by a polyline and let C := A\A[x]. 
We now prove that both B and C are open. Since 
A is connected, we infer A = i4[x] hence, A is segment-connected. 
Let X E B. Since A is open, there exists B{x,r) 
C A. Since x is connected with XQ 
by a polyline, adding a further segment we can connect each point of B{x, r) with XQ 
by a polyline. Therefore B(x,r) 
C B if x G B, i.e., B is open. Similarly, if x G C, let 
B{x, r) C A. No points in B{x, r) can be connected with XQ by a polyline since on the 
contrary adding a further segment, we can connect x with XQ. SO B{X, r) C C if X G C , 
i.e., C is open. 
D 
d. Path-connectedness 
Another notion of connection that makes sense in a topological space is 
joining by paths. 
Let X be a metric space. A path or a curve in X joining x with y is a 
continuous function / : [0,1] ^> X with /(O) = x and /(I) = y. The image 
of the path is called the trajectory of the path. 
6.64 Definition. A metric space X is said path-connected if any two 
points in X can be joined by a path. 
Evidently R*^ is path-connected. We have, as in Theorem 6.63, the 
following. 
6.65 Proposition. Any path-connected metric space X is connected. The 
converse is however false in general. 
6.66 t . Consider the set A CR"^, A = GU I where G is the graph of f{x) := sin 1/x, 
0 < a; < 1, and / = {0} x [—1,1]. Show that A is connected but not path-connected. 

214 
6. Compactness and Connectedness 
Similarly to connected sets, if {Aa} C X are path-connected with 
Ha^a 7^ 0, then A := UaAa is path-connected. Because of this, one can 
define the path-connected component of X containing a given XQ G X as 
the maximal subset of X containing XQ that is path-connected. However, 
examples show that the path-connected components are not closed, in 
general. But we have the following. 
6.67 Proposition. Let X be metric space. The following claims are equiv-
alent. 
(i) Each path-connected component is open (hence closed). 
(ii) Each point of x has a path-connected open neighborhood. 
Proof, (ii) follows trivially from (i). Let C be a path-connected component of X, let 
X £ C and by assumption let B(x^rx) 
be a path-connected ball centered at x. Then 
trivially B(x, Vx) C C, i.e., C is open. Moreover C is also closed since X\C 
is the union 
of the other path-connected components that are open sets, as we have proved. 
D 
6.68 Corollary. An open set A of W^ is connected if and only if it is 
path-connected. 
Proof. Suppose that A is connected and let U C A he a, nonempty open set. Each 
point X E U then has a ball B{x,r) 
C U that is path-connected. By Proposition 6.57 
any path-connected component C of A is open and closed in A. Since A is connected, 
C = A. 
D 
6.3.2 Some applications 
Topological invariants can be used to prove that two given spaces are not 
homeomorphic. 
6.69 Proposition. R and R^, n> 1, are not homeomorphic. 
Proof. Assume, by contradiction, that /i : R^ —> E is a homeomorphism, and let XQ be 
a point of R'^. Then clearly R^ \ {XQ} is connected, but /i(R^ \ {XQ}) = R \ {h(xo)} is 
not connected, a contradiction. 
D 
Much more delicate is proving that 
6.70 Theorem. R"^ and W^, n^vn, 
are not homeomorphic. 
The idea of the proof remains the same. It will be sufficient to have a 
topological invariant that distinguishes between different R'^. 
Similarly, one shows that [0,1] and [0,1]"^, n > 1, are not homeomorphic 
even if one-to-one correspondence exists. 
6.71 %, Show that for any one-to-one mapping /i : [0,1]" —> [0,1] neither h nor h~^ is 
continuous.

6.72 %, Show that the unit circle S^ of M^ is not homeomorphic to M. [Hint: Suppose 
/i : 5^ ^ R is a homeomorphism and let XQ e S^. Then S^ \ {XQ} is connected, while 
R \ {h{xo)} is not connected.] 
6.73 Theorem. In R each closed interval is homeomorphic to [—1,1]; 
each open interval is homeomorphic ^o ] — 1,1[ and each half-open interval 
is homeomorphic ^o ] — 1,1]. Moreover, no two of these three intervals are 
homeomorphic. 
Proof. The first part is trivial. To prove the second part, it suffices to argue as in 
Proposition 6.69 removing respectively, 2, 0 or 1 points to one of the three standard 
intervals, thus destroying connectedness. 
D 
6.74 %, Show that the unit ball 5^ := {x e R'^^^ | \x\ = 1} in R^+^ is connected and 
that S^ and S^, n > 1, are not homeomorphic. 
6.75 ^. Let A C R^ and let C C R"^ be a connected set containing points of both A 
and R"^ \ A. Show that C contains points of dA. 
6.76 f. Show that the numbers of connected components and of path-connected com-
ponents are topological invariants. 
Theorem. Let f : X —^ Y be a continuous function. 
The image of each connected 
(path-connected) 
component of X must lie in a connected component ofY. 
Moreover, if 
f is a homeomorphism, 
then f induces a one-to-one correspondence between connected 
(path-connected) 
components of X 
andV. 
6.77 %. In set theory, the following theorem of Cantor-Bernstein holds, see Theo-
rem 3.58 of [GM2]. 
Theorem. // there exist injective maps X —>• "K and K —> X, then there exists a 
one-to-one map between X and Y. 
This theorem becomes false if we require also continuity. 
Theorem (Kuratowski). There may exist continuous and one-to-one maps f \ X ^y 
Y and g :Y -^ X between metric spaces and yet X and Y are not 
homeomorphic.

By Exercise 6.76, X and Y are not homeomorphic, since the component ]0,1] of Y 
is not homeomorphic to any component of X, but the maps f : X —^ Y and g :Y ^>^ X

7. Curves 
The intuitive idea of a curve is that of the motion of a point in space. This 
idea summarizes the heritage of the ancient Greeks who used to think of 
curves as geometric figures characterized by specific geometric properties, 
as the conies, and the heritage of the XVIII century, when, with the de-
velopment of mechanics, curves were thought of as the trace of a moving 
point. 
7.1 Curves in W 
7.1-1 Curves and trajectories 
Prom a mathematical point of view, it is convenient to think of a curve as 
of a continuous map 7 from an interval / of R into M'^, 7 € C^(/, M'^). The 
image 7(7) of a curve 7 G C^{I,W^), is called the trace or the trajectory 
of 7. We say that 7 : / ^' R"^ is a parametrization of F if 7(/) = F, 
intuitively, a curve is a (continuous) way to travel on F. li x^y G R^, a 
curve 7 € C^([a, 6], R^) such that 7(a) = x, 7(6) = y, is often called a path 
joining x and y. A curve is what in kinematics is called the motion law of 
a material point, and its image or trajectory is the "line" in R*^ spanned 
when the point moves. 
If the basis in R"^ is understood, —as we shall do from now on, fixing the 
standard basis of R'^— a curve 7 G C^(/, R"^) writes as an n-tuple of contin-
uous real-valued functions of one variable, 7(t) = (7^(t),7^(t),... ,7"^(t)), 
7* : / ^ R, 7*(t) being the component of 7(t) Vt G /. 
Let /c = 1,2,..., or 00. We say that a curve 7 G C^(/,R^) if all the 
components of 7 are real-valued functions respectively, of class C^(/,R), 
and that 7 is a curve of class C'^ if 7 G C^(/,R^) We also say that 7 : 
[a, b] ^ R'^ is a closed curve of class C^ if 7 is closed, 7 G C^(/,R'^) and 
moreover, the derivatives of order up to k of each component of 7 at a and 
b coincide, 
Dj-f'{a) = Dj^\b) 
Vz = 1,..., n, Vj - 1,..., A;. 
If 7 : / ^ R" is of class C \ the vector 

220 
7. Curves 
7'(*o):=((y)%),..., (7")'(<o)) 
is the derivative or the velocity vector of 7 at to G /, and its modulus 
|7'(to)| is the (scalar) velocity of 7 at to. We also call 7'(to) the tangent 
vector to 7 at to- Finally, if 7 G C^(/,R"), the vector 
7"(to):=((y)"(to),...,(7")"(M) 
is called the acceleration vector of 7 at to-
7.1 Example (Segment). Let x and y be two distinct points in R^. The curve s{t) : 
s{t) = (1 - t)x -\- ty = X -\-1 {y - x), 
te [0,1], 
is an affine map, called the parametric equation of the line through x in the direction of 
y. Thus its trajectory is the line L CW^ through s(0) = x and s(l) = y with constant 
vector velocity s'{t) = y — x. In kinematics, s{t) is the position of a point traveling on 
the straight line s(R) with constant velocity ly — x| assuming s(0) = x and s(l) = y. 
Therefore the restriction si[o,i] of s, 
s{t) = {l-t)x-\-ty, 
0<t< 
1, 
describes the uniform motion of a point starting from x at time t = 0 and arriving in y 
at time t = 1 with constant speed ly — x| and is called the parametric 
equation of the 
segment joining y to x. 
7.2 Example (Uniform circular motion). The curve 7 : R —)^ E^^ given by ^{t) = 
(cos t, sin t) has as its trajectory the unit circle of R^ {(x, y) | x^ + 2/^ = 1} with velocity 
one. In fact, Y(t) = (—sint,cost) thus |7'(t)| = 1 Vt. 7 describes the uniform circular 
motion of a point on the unit circle that starts at time t = 0 at (1,0) and moves 
counterclockwise with angular velocity one, cf. [GMl]. Notice that 7' J- 7 and 7'' JL 7' 
since 
(7'(*)h(t)) = i ^ ( t ) = 0 . 
(7"(*)|7'(t))=J^W = 0. 
Finally, observe that the restriction of 7 to [0,27r[ runs on the unit circle once, since 
7|[o,27r[ is injective. 
The uniform circular motion is better described looking at R^ as the Gauss plane 
of complex numbers, see [GM2]. Doing so, we substitute y(t) with t —> e**, t € R, since 
we have e** = cos t-\- i sin t. 
7.3 Example (Graphs). Let / G C°(/,R^) be a curve. The graph of / , 
Gf := [(x,y) 
elxW'lxel, 
y = fix)] C R ^ + \ 
has the standard parametrization, still denoted by Gf, Gf : I —> R'^'^^, Gf{t) := t -^ 
(t, f{t)), called the graph-curve of/. Observe that Gf is an injective map, in particular 
Gf is never a closed curve, Gf is of class C^ if / is of class C^, k = 1 
,00, and 
G^(t) = (!,/'(()) 
if / is of class C^. A point that moves with the graph-curve law along the graph, 
moves with horizontal component of the velocity field normalized to + 1 . Notice that 
\G'^(t)\ > 1 V(. 

7.1 Curves in W 
221 
Figure 7.1. A cylindrical helix. 
7.4 Example (Cylindrical helix). If j{t) = (acost, asint, 6t), t 6 M, then y{t) 
= 
(—asint, acos t, 6), t E M. We see that the point ^{t) moves with constant (scalar) speed 
along a helix, see Figure 7.1. 
7.5 Example (Different parametrizations). Different curves may have the same 
trace, as we have seen for uniform circular motion. As another example, the curves 
71 (t) := (t,0), 72(0 '= (*^,0) and73(t) := (t{t'^-l),0), 
t G M, are different parametriza-
tions of the abscissa-axis of M^; of course, the three parametrizations give rise to different 
motions along the x-axis. Similarly, the curves ai (t) = (t3,t2) and (72(t) = (t, (t2)V3)^ 
t G M, are different parametrizations of (a) Figure 7.2. Notice that ai is a C°°-
parametrization, while a2 is continuous but not of class C^. 
7.6 Example (Polar curves). Many curves are more conveniently described by a 
polar parametrization: 
instead of giving the evolution of Cartesian coordinates of 7(t) := 
(x(t), y{t)), we give two real functions 9{t) and p{t) that describe respectively, the angle 
evolution of 7(t) measured from the positive part to the abscissa axis and the distance 
of 7(t) from the origin, so that in Cartesian coordinates 
7(0 = {p{t) cose{t),p{t) 
sinOit)). 
If the independent variable t coincides with the angle 0, 9{t) = t, we obtain a polar 
curve 
^{0) = (p((9) cos (9, p(^) sin ^). 
In the literature there are many classical curves that have been studied 
for their relevance in many questions. Listing them would be incredibly 
long, but we shall illustrate some of them in Section 7.1.3.

If 7 G C^{[a, 6], R*^) and n > 1, the mean value theorem does not hold. 
Indeed, if j{t) = (cost, sinf), t G [0,27r], and s G [0, 27r] is such that 
0 = 7(27r)-7(0) = 27ry(5), 
we reach a contradiction, since |7'(5)| = |(— sin 5, cos s)| = 1. However, the

Figure 7.3. Some trajectories: from the left, (a) simple curve, (b) simple closed curve, 
(c), (d), (f) curves that are not simple. 
b. Self-intersections 
Traces of curves may have self-intersections^ i.e., in general, curves are not 
injective. In (b) Figure 7.2 the trace of the curve 7(t) = {t^ - 4t, t'^ - 4) 
t eR self-intersects at the origin. One defines the multiplicity of a curve 
7 G C^{I,W) 
dit xeW^ 
as the number of fs such that j{t) = x, 
N(nJ,x):=#[tel\i{t) 
= x] 
Of course, the trace of 7 is the set of points with multiplicity at least 1. 
We shall distinguish two cases. 
(i) 7 : / -^ R"^ is not closed, i.e., 7(a) ^ 7(6). In this case we say 
that 7 is simple if 7 is not injective i.e., all points of its trajectory 
have multiplicity 1. Notice that, if / = [a, ^], then 7 is simple if and 
only if 7 is an homeomorphism of [a, 6] onto 7([a, 6]), [a, 6] being 
compact, see Corollary 6.19. In contrast, if / is not compact, / and 
7(7) in general are not homeomorphic. For instance let / = [0,27r[ and 
7(t) := (cost,sint), t G / be the uniform circular motion. Then 7(7) 
is the unit circle that is not homeomorphic to 7, see Exercise 6.72. 
(ii) ^ is a closed curve, i.e., 7 = [a, 6] and 7(a) = 7(6). In this case we 
say that 7 is a simple closed curve if the restriction of 7 to [a, 6[ 
is injective, or, equivalently, if all points of the trajectory of 7, but 
7(a) = 7(6) have multiplicity 1. 
A (closed) curve 7 has self-intersections if it is not a (closed) simple 
curve. 
7.10 %. Show that any closed curve 7 : [a, 6] —> M^ can be seen as a continuous map 
from the unit circle S^ C M^. Furthermore show that its trax^e is homeomorphic to S^ 
if 7 is simple. 
7.11 If. Study the curves (x{t),y(t)), 
x{t) = 2t/(l + t^), y(t) = (f 
- 1)/(1 + t^), 
c. Equivalent parametrizations 
Many properties of curves are independent of the choice of the parameter, 
that is, are invariant under homemorphic changes of the parameter. This 
is the case for the multiplicity function and, as we shall see later, of the 
length. For this reason, it is convenient to introduce the following definition 

224 
7. Curves 
7.12 Definition. Let I, J be intervals and let 7 E C^(J,M^) and 5 G 
C^(J,R"^). We say that 5 is equivalent to 7 if there is a continuous one-
to-one map h : J -^ I such that 
5{s) = j{h{s)) 
V 5 G J. 
In other words S is equivalent to 7 if (5 reduces to 7 modulo a continuous 
change of variable in the time axis. Since the inverse /i~^ : / —^ J of a 
continuous one-to-one map is also continuous, see [GMl], we have that 7 
is equivalent to S iff S is equivalent to 7. Actually one sees that the relation 
of equivalence among curves is an equivalence relation. 
Trivially, two equivalent curves have the same trace and the same mul-
tiplicity function; the converse is in general false. 
7.13 Example, ^{t) = (cosi, sint), t 6 [0, 27r] and d(t) = (cost, sint), t e [0,4n] have 
the same trace but are not equivalent since their multipHcity functions are diflPerent. 
However, we have the following. 
7.14 Theorem. Two simple curves with the same trace are equivalent. 
Proof. Assume for simplicity that the two curves 7 G C^il.R"^) 
and <5 G C^{J,W^), 
I 
and J being intervals, are not closed. Set h := y'^ oS which clearly is a one-to-one and 
continuous map from J to I. h is then a homeomorphism, see [GMl], and clearly 
s(t) = 707-10 s(t) = s(h{t)) 
\/teJ. 
The notion of equivalence between curves can be made more precise. 
7.15 Definition. Let 7 G C^{I,W) 
and S G C^(J,W) 
be two equivalent 
curves, and let h : J -^ I be a homeomorphism such that S(t) — j{h{t)) 
Wt e J. We say that 7 and 5 have the same orientation if h is monotone-
increasing and have opposite orientation if h is monotone-decreasing. 
Since every homeomorphism between intervals is either strictly increas-
ing or strictly decreasing, see [GMl], two equivalent curves either have the 
same orientation or have opposite orientations. In this way, the set of curves 
can be partitioned into equivalence classes and each class decomposes into 
two disjoint subclasses: equivalent curves with the same orientation and 
equivalent curves with opposite orientation. 
7.1.2 Regular curves and tangent vectors 
a. Regular curves 
We say that a curve 7 of class C^ is regular if 7'(^) ^ 0 Vt. It is also 
convenient to reconsider the notion of equivalence in the category of curves 
of class C^. 

7.1 Curves in E^ 
225 
7.16 Definition. Let I, J be intervals. Two curves 7 G C^(/,R^), S G 
C^(J,R'^) of class C^ are C^-equivalent if there exists a one-to-one map 
h : J -^ I of class C^ with h'{t) ^ 0 Wt e J such that 7(5) = 7{h{s)) 
^seJ. 
Clearly C^-equivalent curves have the same trace. We can prove that being 
C^-equivalent is an equivalence relation between regular curves; actually 
we shall prove the following result after Proposition 7.37. 
7.17 Theorem. Let 7 and S be two curves of class C^, and suppose they 
are regular. Then 7 and S are C^ -equivalent if and only if they are C^-
equivalent. 
Since every function of class C^ with h' ^ 0 Mt is either strictly in-
creasing or strictly decreasing, since h' cannot change sign, any two C^-
equivalent curves either have the same orientation or have opposite ori-
entation. In this way the set of C^-curves can be partitioned into equiva-
lence classes and each class decomposes into two disjoint subclasses: C^-
equivalent curves with the same orientation and C^-equivalent curves with 
opposite orientation. 
b. Tangent vectors 
Let 7 : / ^^ R"^ be a simple, regular curve of class C^ and let F := 7(7) be 
its trace. If x G F, there exists a unique t e I such that ^(t) = x. 
7.18 Definition. The space of tangent vectors to the trace T at x eT is 
defined as the space of all multiples 
ofy{t), 
Tan^F := Span W{t)\ 
7(t) = x. 
The unit tangent vector to 7 at a; := 7(t) is defined by 
Notice that the previous definition makes sense since one proves that 
Span {7'(t)} where 7(t) = x, depends only on the trace of 7 and on x. 
In fact, if 7 : / —^ R'^ and S : J —^M^ are two curves with the same trace 
F, then Theorems 7.14 and 7.17 yield that 7 and 5 are C^-equivalent, i.e., 
there exists h : J ^^ I one-to-one and of class C^ with h'{s) ^ 0 "is E J 
such that S{s) = ^{h{s)) \/s G /. Differentiating, we get 
S\s) = 
h\s)S\h{s)), 
that is, 6'{s) and 7'(t) are multiples of each other when S{s) = ^{t) =: x. 
Moreover,

litN) 
that is, two C^-equivalent curves with the same orientation have the same 
unit tangent vector, and two C^-equivalent curves with opposite orienta-
tion have the opposite unit tangent vector. 
Remaining in a classic context, it is convenient to also introduce the 
families of piecewise-C^ curves and piecewise regular curves. 
7.19 Definition. A curve 7 : [a, 6] —> W^ is said to be piecewise-C^ (re-
spectively, regular) if ^ ^ C^(/, R'^) and there exist finitely many points 
a = to < ti < ' •' < tjsf = b such that the restrictions 7|[t.,ti_i] ^^^ ^/ class 
C^ (respectively, regular) for all i — 1^... ^N. 
We emphasize that in Definition 7.19 7 is required to be continuous ev-
erywhere in [a, 6], while derivatives are required to exist everywhere except 
at finite many points where only left- and right-derivatives exist. Notice 
also that piecewise-C^ curves are Lipschitz continuous. 
7.20 %, Let 7 : [a, 6] —> R^ be a piecewise regular curve. Show that every point in 
7([a, 6]) has finite multiplicity. Show a piecewise regular curve that has infinitely many 
points of multiplicity 2. 
7.21 % Show that 
7(b) - 7 ( a ) = / 
l'{s)ds 
J a 
if 7 : [a, h] —>• M"" is piecewise C^. 
c. Length of a curve 
Recall that a partition a of [a, 6] is a choice af finitely many points 
to,..., tjv with a = to < ti < ' •' < t^ = b. Denote by S the family of parti-
tions of [a,b]. For each partition G = {to->ti,... .t^] ^ S one computes the 
length of the polygonal line P{cr) joining the points 7(^0)? 7(^1)7 • • • ? I{^N)

Figure 7.5. The graph of f{x) = xsin(l/x), x € [0,1], is not rectifiable. 
7.22 Definition. Let 7 G C°([a,6];E^). The length of 7 Z5 defined as 
L(7) := sup|p(a) I cr G ^ j 
and i(;e 5a?/ ^/ia^ 7 Z5 rectifiable or 7 has finite total variation z/ L(7) < 
+CXD. 
In other words the length of a curve is the supremum of the lengths of 
all inscribed polygonals. The following is easily seen. 
7.23 Proposition. 7/7 and S are equivalent, then L(7) = L{5). In par-
ticular 7 and S are either both rectifiable or not, and the length of a simple 
curve depends only on its trace. 
7.24 If. Prove Proposition 7.23. 
7.25 f. Let 7 : [a, b] —>- R'^ be a curve and let a < c < b. Show that L{'y) = L(7|[a,c]) + 
^(7[c,6])-
7.26 If. Show that if -f{t) = (cost,sint), t G [0,27r], we have L(7) = 27r, while if 
7(t) = (cost,sint), t 6 f0,47r], we have L{'y) = 47r. 
7.27 Example. Curves 7 G C^i[a, 6);R^) need not be rectifiable, i.e., of finite length. 
Indeed the curve graph of / , j{x) = (x, f{x)) 
where

i.e., L(7) = oo. Notice that 7 belongs to C0([0,1],M^) fl C^flO, 1],R^), but 7' is not 
bounded in a neighborhood of 0. 
7.28 Example (The von Koch curve). Clearly a bounded region of the plane may 
be enclosed by a curve of arbitrarily large length, think of the coasts of Great Britain or 
of Figure 7.6. A curve of infinite length enclosing a finite area is the von Koch curve that 
is constructed as follows. Start from an equilateral triangle, replace the middle third of 
each line segment with the two sides of an equilateral triangle whose third side is the 
middle third that we want to remove. Then one iterates the procedure indefinitely. One 
can show that the iterated curves converge uniformly to a curve, called the von Koch 
curve, which 
(i) is a continuous simple curve, 
(ii) has infinite length and encloses a finite area, 
(iii) is not diff^erentiable at any point. 
7.29 %, Show that each iteration in the construction of von Koch's curve increases its 
length by a factor 4/3, and, given any two points on the curve, the length of the arc 
between the two points is infinity. Finally, show that the surface enclosed by von Koch's 
curve is 8/5 of the surface of the initial triangle. 
7.30 Example (The Peano curve). 
Continuous nonsimple curves may be quite 
pathological. Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932) showed in 1890 an example of a continuous 
curve 7 : [0,1] —• [0,1] x [0,1] whose trsice is the entire square: any such curve is called a 
Peano curve. Following David Hilbert (1862-1943), one such curve may be constructed 
as follows. Consider the sequence of continuous curves 7i : [0,1] —>• R^ as in Figure 7.8. 
The curve at step i is obtained by modifying the curve at step (i — 1) in an interval 
of width 2~* and in a corresponding square of side 2~* on the target. The sequence 
of these curves therefore converges uniformly to a continuous curve, whose trsLce is the

entire square. Of course, 7 is not injective, otherwise we would conclude that [0,1] is 
homeomorphic to the square [0,1]^, compare Proposition 6.69. 
Another way of constructing a Peano curve, closer to the original proof of Peano 
who used ternary representations of reals, is the following. Represent each x € [0,1] in 
its dyadic expression, x = Y^QLI ^i/2*, h 6 {0,1}, choosing not to have representations 
ending with period 1. If x = J2^o ^i/2' ^ [0.1]^ set

i=0 
Using the fact that the alignment "changes" by a small quantity if x varies in a suf-
ficiently small interval, we easily infer that 7 is continuous. On the other hand, 7 is 
trivially surjective. 
No pathological behavior occurs for curves of class C^. In particular, 
there is a formula for computing their length. 
7.31 Theorem. Let 7 G C^([a,6];R'^). Then 7 is rectifiable and 
L(n)= I \i{s)\ds. 
J a 
Proof. Let cr G «S be a partition of [a, 6], P(cr) the length of the polygonal line corre-
sponding to G. The fundamental theorem of calculus yields

hence

Giuseppe Vitah (1875-1932), Tibor Rado (1895-1965), Hans Rademacher

of length L is a curve 5 : [0, L] -^ W^ that is C^-equivalent to 7 , has the 
same orientation of 7 and for which \S'{s)\ = 1 V5 G [0,1/]. It is actually 
the unique reparametrization with these properties.

7.1.3 Some celebrated curves 
Throughout the centuries, mathematicians, artists, scholars of natural sci-
ences and layman have had an interest in plane curves, their variety of 
forms, and their occurrence in many natural phenomena. As a consequence 

234 
7. Curves 
Figure 7.12. (a) Archimedes's spiral, (b) Fermat's spiral, (c) Hyperbolic spiral. 
there is a large literature which attempts to classify plane curves accord-
ing to their properties focusing on their constructive aspects or by simply 
providing catalogs. In this section we shall present some of these famous 
curves. 
a. Spirals 
Spirals are probably among the most known curves, the first and simplest 
being the spiral of Archimedes. This is the curve described by a point that 
moves with constant velocity along a half-line that rotates with constant 
angular velocity along its origin. If the origin of the half-line is the origin 
of a Cartesian plane, we have p = vt,9 = cut, thus the polar form of 
Archimedes's spiral is 
p = a6, 
a := —. 
Other spirals are obtained assuming that the motion along the half-line is 
accelerated, for instance 
p = a^". 
All these spirals begin at the origin at ^ = 0 and move away from the 
origin as 9 increases.

ARCHIMEDEAN SPIRALS. These are the curves defined by 
ae. 
m e 
Among them, see Figures 7.12 and 7.13, we mention 
o Archimedes's spiral p = aO^ 
o FermaVs spiral p^ = a^6^ 
o the hyperbolic or inverse spiral p = a/6^ 
o the lituus (? — a^/9^ 
o the logarithmic or equiangular spiral 6 — log^ /?, i.e., p = A^, A > 1. 
It is the spiralis mirabilis of Johann Bernoulh (1667-1748). It (ac-
tually, its tangent at every point) forms a constant angle with any 
ray from the origin, and every ray intersects the logarithmic spiral 
in a sequence of points with distances in a geometric progression. 
It is probably the spiral that one finds most frequently in nature, 
expressing growth proportional to the organism, as in shells, pine 
cones, sunfiowers or in galaxies. 
SINUSOIDAL SPIRALS. A large variety of curves is described by the sinu-
soidal spirals p^ = a'^cos(n^), n rational. For instance, 
o Cayley's sextic p = 4acos^(^/3), see Figure 7.13, that we can also 
write in an implicit form as the set of points (x, y) such that 4(x^ + 
2/2-ax)3 = 27a2(x2 +7/2)2^

o Cardioid p = 2a(l + cos0), see Figure 7.14, that we can write 
implicitly as the set of points (x, y) such that [x^ + y^ — 2ax)'^ = 
Aa^{x'^-\-y^), 
o Lemniscate of Bernoulli p^ = a^cos(2^), see Figure 7.14, equiva-
lently as the set of points (x, y) such that (x^ + y^)^ = a^(x^ — 2/^), 
o Cubic of de VHospital: pcos^lO/S) — a, see Figure 7.14. 
Other well-known spirals are, see Figure 7.15,

where x{t) = ± J^ ^

b. Conchoids 
According to Diadochus Proclus (411-485), Nicomedes (280BC-210BC) 
studied the problem of the trisection of an angle by means of the conchoids. 
Let O be a fixed point, and let ^ be a line through O intersecting 
a trajectory C at a point Q. The locus of point Pi and P2 on i such 
that PiQ = QP2 = k = const is a conchoid of C with respect to O, see 
Figure 7.16. 
CONCHOID OF NICOMEDES. It is the conchoid of a line with respect to a 
point not on the line. If the line ^ is x = 6 and the point 0 is (0,0), 
then the conchoid has parametric equations j{t) = {x{t),y{t)) where 
I.e., 
\ X = b-\- a cos ^, 
\y= (6 + a cos 6) tan 0, 
by the change of variable t = 6 tan^, see Figure 7.16. We can write it 
also in polar coordinates as 
p{e) = a -f cos^' 

7.1 Curves in W

or as the set of points (x, y) such that 
LiMACON OF PASCAL. (Etienne Pascal (1588-1640), the father of Blaise 
Pascal.) It is the conchoid of a circle of radius a with respect to a 
point O on the circle. If 0 is the origin and p = 2a cos 9 is the polar 
equation of the circle of center (a, 0) through (0,0), the polar equation 
of the limacon is p = 2a cos 0 + 6, see Figure 7.16. Choosing b = 2a 
the limacon becomes a cardioid. 
CONCHOID OF DURER. Let Q = {q, 0) and R = (0, r) be points such that 
q + r = b. The locus of points P and P', on the straight line through 
Q and i?, with distance a from Q is Durer's conchoid (Albrecht Diirer 
(1471-1528)), see Figure 7.18. Its Cartesian equation may be found 
by eliminating q and r from the equations 
b = q + r, 
y = - ^ x + r. 
c. Cissoids 
Given two curves Ci and C2 and a fixed point O, we let Qi and Q2 be the 
intersections of a line through 0 with Ci and C2, respectively. The locus of 
points P on such lines such that OP = OQ2 — OQi = Q2Q1 is the cissoid 
of Ci and C2 with respect to O, see (a) Figure 7.17. 
The cissoids of a circle and a tangent line with respect to a fixed point 
of the circle that is not opposite to the point of tangency is the cissoid of 
Diodes introduced by Diodes (240BC-180BC) in his attempts to doubling 
the cube, see (b) Figure 7.17. If O is the origin, and the circle has equa-
tion (x — a/2)^ -h 2/^ = o^^/4, the intersections points are C = a(l,tan^), 
B = a cos 6{cos 9, sin 6), hence Diocles's cissoid has the Cartesian equation 
2/^ (a — x) = x^, or, equivalently, polar equation 
p = a sin 0 tan 0.

d. Algebraic curves 
These are loci of zeros of polynomials. The degree of the polynomial may 
be taken as measure of complexity: curves that are zeros of second order 
polynomials are well classified, see Example 3.69. We list here a few more 
algebraic curves, see Figure 7.19. 
WITCH OF AGNESI. It has an equation y{x'^-\-a'^) = a^ and it is the trace 
of the curve ^{t) = {x{t),y{t)) 
where x(t) = at, y{t) = a/{l + t^), 
teR. 
STROPHOID OF BARROW. It has an equation x{x - a)^ = y^i'^a - x) and 
it is the trace of the curve 7(^) = {x{t),y{t)) where x{t) = 2acos^ t, 
y{t) =ataint{l-2cos^t), 
teR. 
EIGHT CURVE or LEMNISCATE OF GERONO. It has an equation x"^ = 
o?{x'^ — y^) and it is the trace of the curve ^{t) = {x(t),y{t)) 
where 
x(t) = a cost, y{t) = asintcost, 
teR. 
CURVES OF LISSAJOUS. They are the traces of curves 7(t) = 
{x{t),y(t)) 
where x{t) = asm{at + d), y{t) — 6sint, t G M in which each coordi-
nate moves as a simple harmonic motion. One shows that such curves 
are algebraic closed curves iff a is rational. 
FOLIUM OF DESCARTES. It has an equation x^ -^y^ = Saxy and arises 
as trace of the curve 7(t) = {x{t),y{t)) 
where x{t) = Sat/{1 + t^), 
y{t) = 3atV(l +1^), t e M, see Figure 7.17. 
DEVIL'S CURVE. It has an equation y'^-x'^+ay^+bx'^ = 0, see Figure 7.18. 
DOUBLE FOLIUM. It has an equation {x^ -{-y^)'^ = iaxy'^, see Figure 7.20. 
TRIFOLIUM. It has an equation {x'^ -\- y'^){y'^ -\- x{x -\- a)) = Aaxy"^, see 
Figure 7.20. 
OVALS OF CASSINI. They have equation {x^ + y^ + a^)^ = 6^ + 4a^x^, 
see Figure 7.18. 
ASTROID. It has an equation x^/^ -h y^^^ — o?!^, see Figure 7.20. 
e. The cycloid 
Nonrational curves are called transcendental Among them one of the most 
famous is the cycloid. This is the trajectory described by a fixed point (the 
tyre valve) of a circle (a tyre) rolhng on a line, see Figure 7.21.

strophoid of Barrow, (c) the lemniscate of Gerono, (d) the Lissajous curve for n = 5, 
d = n/2. 
If the center of the circle is C = (0,i?), the radius R, P = (0,0) and 
we parametrize the movement with the angle 6 that CP makes with the 
vertical through C, then P — P{9), C = C{9), the cycloid has period 27r, 
and we have 
^ ^

\R{l-cose)J 
Since the circle rolls, C{0) simply translates parallel to the axis of R6. We 
then conclude that the cycloid is the trace of the curve 7 : R —> R^ defined 
by

7. Curves 
Figure 7.21. The cycloid. 
The cycloid solves at least two important and celebrated problems. 
As we know, the pendulus is not isochrone, but it is approximately 
isocronic for small oscillations, see Section 6.3.1 of [GMl]. Christiaan Huy-
gens (1629-1695) found that the isochronal curve is the cycloid. 
Johann BernouUi (1667-1748) showed that the cycloid is the curve 
of quickest descent, that is, the curve connecting two points on a vertical 
plane on which a movable point descends under the influence of gravitation 
in the quickest possible way. 
Other curves of the same nature as the cycloids are the epicycloids and 
the hypercycloids^ see Figure 7.22. These are obtained from a circle that 
rolls around the inside or the outside of another circle (or another curve). 
f. The catenary 
Another celebrated transcendental curve is the catenary. It describes the 
form assumed by a perfect flexible inextensible chain of uniform density 
hanging from two supports, already discussed by Gahleo Gahlei (1564-
1642). Answering a challenge of Jacob Bernoulh (1654-1705), it was proved

ipocycloid x{t) = 8cost + 2cos(4t), y{t) = Ssint — 2sin(4t), (c) a catenary.

7.2 Curves in Metric Spaces 
Of course we may also consider curves in a general metric space X, as 
continuity is the only requirement. Let us start introducing the notion of 
total variation, a notion essentially due to Camille Jordan (1838-1922). 
a. Functions of bounded variation and rectifiable curves 
Let X be a metric space and / : [a, 6] C M —» X be any map. Denote by 
S the family of finite partitions a = {to,... ^tjsf} with a = to < ti < - • - < 
tN = b oi the interval [a, b] and, in correspondence to each partition cr, set 
|o-| := maxi=i,...,iv(|^2 - ^z-i|) and 
N-l 
K(/):=5]d(/(ti),/(ii+i)), 
i=0 
that we have denoted by P{(j) in the case of curves into W^.

7.38 Definition. The total variation of a map f : [a^h] —^ X is the num-
ber (eventually +ooj 
n / , [ a , 6 ] ) - s u p y , ( / ) . 
We say that f has bounded total variation ifV{f^ [^?^]) < co. When the 
curve / : [a, 6] —^ X is continuous, V{f, [a, b]) is called the length of f and 
curves with bounded total variation, that is with finite length, are called 
rectifiable. 
Either directly or repeating the arguments used in studying the length 
of curves into R*^, it is easy to show the following. 
7.39 Proposition. We have 
(i) if [a, b] C [c, d], then F(/, [a, b]) < F(/, [c, d]), 
(ii) F(/, [a, 6]) > d{f{a),f{b)) 
and, if f is real-valued and increasing, 
thenV{f,[a,b]) 
= 
m-f{a), 
(iii) every Lipschitz-continuous function / : [a, 6] ^ X has bounded total 
variation and F(/, [a, b]) < Lip (/) {b ~ a), 
(iv) the total variation is a subadditive set-function, meaning 
V{f, [a, b]) < V{f, [a, c]) + V{f, [c, b]) 
ifa<c< 
b; 
moreover, if f is continuous at c, then V{f,[a,b]) 
— V{f,[a,c]) + 
V{f,[c,b]), 
(v) V{f, [a, b]) = lim|,|_.o+ VM, [«, b]).

7.40 ^. Let f : [a,b] —^ X X X where X is a metric space. Show that / has bounded 
variation if and only if the two components of / = (/i,/2), /i,2 : [a,6] —> X have 
bounded variation. 
We say that two curves (p : [a, 6] -^ X and i/; : [c, d] ^ X into X are 
equivalent if there exists a homeomorphism a : [c, d] -^ [a, 6] such that 
jp{s) = (p{h{s)) Mx G [a, 6]. Prom the definitions we have the following. 
7.41 Proposition. Two equivalent curves have the same total variation. 
From (iv) and (v) of Proposition 7.39 we also have the following. 
7.42 Proposition. Let (^ : [a, 6] —> X he a rectifiable (continuous) curve. 
Then the real-valued function t -^ V{(p^ W.t]), t ^ [fl,^] is continuous and 
increasing. 
7.43 1. Prove the claims in Propositions 7.39, 7.41 and 7.42. 
b. Lipschitz and intrinsic reparametrizations 
We saw that every regular Euclidean curve may be reparametrized with 
velocity one. 
Por curves in an arbitrary metric space we have 
7.44 Theorem. Let j : [a^b] -^ X be a simple rectifiable curve on a met-
ric space X of length L. Then there exists a homeomorphism a : [0, L] —> 
[a, 6] such that 7 o a : [0,L] —^ X is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz 
constant one. 

244 
7. Curves 
Figure 7.26. The sets Ek of the middle third Cantor set. 
We call that parametrization of the trace of 7 the intrinsic parametrization 
oi7{[a,b]). 
Proof. Let x € [a, b] and V{x) := V{j, [a, x]). We have L = V(7, [a, b]) and, on account 
of Proposition 7.42, V{x) is continuous and increasing. Since 7 is simple, V{x) is strictly 
increasing hence a homeomorphism between [a, 6] and [0, L]. Set cr := F " ^ . We then 
infer for 0 < x < y < L 
db(<T(y)), 7(<T(X))) < K(7 o <T, [x, y]) = y ( 7 , [<T(X), cr{y)]) 
= V(<7(y)) - y(<T(x)) 
=x-y, 
i.e., (^ o a is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant one. 
• 
7.2,1 Real functions with bounded variation 
It is worth adding a few more comments about the class of real-valued func-
tions / : [a, 6] -^ R with finite bounded variation, denoted by BV{[a,b]). 
7.45 Theorem. We have 
(i) BV([a^b]) is a linear space and \\f\\ := \f{a)\ + F(/, [a,6]) is a norm 
on it, 
(ii) BV{[a^h]) contains the convex cone of increasing functions, 
(iii) every f G BF([a, b]) is the difference of two increasing functions. 
Proof. We leave to the reader the task of proving (i) and (ii) and we prove (iii). For 
/ G BV([a, b]) and t G [a, b] set 
^{t) '= V{f, K t]), 
i;it) := ^(t) + f{t), 
t G [a, 6]. 
For x,y £ [a,b], X < y, we have 
t/;(2/) - t/;(x) = [ifiy) - ip(x)] + [/(y) - 
f{x)]; 
now the subadditivity of the total variation yields 
^{y) - -fix) = V{f, [x,y]) > \f{y) - 
fix)l 
in particular 
ilj(y) - iPix) > 0. 
Therefore (p and ip are both increasing with bounded total variation, and f(t) = ip{t) — 
(p(t) Vt. 
D 
A surprising consequence is the following. 
7.46 Corollary. Every function in BV{[a,b]) has left- and right-limits at 
every point of [a,b].

7.47 Proposition. Every continuous function f : [a, 6] -^ R with finite 
total variation is the difference of two continuous increasing functions. 
a. The Cantor-Vitali function 
The Cantor ternary set is defined, see of [GM2], as C = CikEk where

8. Some Topics from the 
Topology of E^ 
As we have aheady stated, topology is the study of the properties shared 
by a geometric figure and all its bi-continuous transformations, i.e., the 
study of invariants by homeomorphisms. Its origin dates back to the prob-
lem of Konigsberg bridges and Euler's theorem about polyhedra, to Rie-
mann's work on the geometric representation of functions, to Betti's work 
on the notion of multiconnectivity and, most of all, to the work of J. Henri 
Poincare (1854-1912). Starting from his research on differential equations 
in mechanics, Poincare introduced relevant topological notions and, in par-
ticular, the idea of associating to a geometric figure (using a rule that is 
common to all figures) an algebraic object, such as a group, that is a topo-
logical invariant for the figure and that one could compute. The fundamen-
tal group and homology groups are two important examples of algebraic 
objects introduced by Poincare: this is the beginning of combinatorial or 
algebraic topology. With the development of what we call today general 
topology due to, among others, Rene-Louis Baire (1874-1932), Maurice 
Prechet (1878-1973), Prigyes Riesz (1880-1956), Pelix Hausdorff (1869-
1942), Kazimierz Kuratowski (1896-1980), and the interaction between 
general and algebraic topology due to L. E. Brouwer (1881-1966), James 
Alexander (1888-1971), Solomon Lefschetz (1884-1972), Pavel Alexan-
droff (1896-1982), Pavel Urysohn (1898-1924), Heinz Hopf (1894-1971), 
L. Agranovich Lyusternik (1899-1981), Lev G. Schnirelmann (1905-1938), 
Harald Marston Morse (1892-1977), Eduard Cech (1893-1960), the study 
of topology in a wide sense is consolidated and in fact receives new incen-
tives thanks to the work of Jean Leray (1906-1998), Elie Cartan (1869-
1951), Georges de Rham (1903-1990). Clearly, even a short introduction 
to these topics would deviate us from our course; therefore we shall con-
fine ourselves to illustrating some fundamental notions and basic results 
related to the topology of R^, to the notion of dimension and, most of all, 
to the existence of fixed points.

Figure 8.1. A homotopy. 
8.1 Homotopy 
In this section we shall briefly discuss the different flavors of the notion of 
homotopy. They correspond to the intuitive idea of continuous deformation 
of one object into another. 
8.1-1 Homotopy of maps and sets 
a. Homotopy of maps 
In the following, the ambient spaces X, Y, Z will be metric spaces. 
8.1 Definition. Two continuous maps f,g : X —^Y are called homotopic 
if there exists a continuous map H : [0,1] x X -^ Y such that H{0, x) = 
/(x), H(l,x) 
= g{x) M X G X. In this case we say that H establishes or is 
a homotopy of f to g. 
It is easy to show that the homotopy relation f ^ g on maps from X 
to Y is an equivalence relation, i.e., it is 
(i) 
(REFLEXIVE) / ~ / . 
(ii) 
(SYMMETRIC) / ~ ^ iff P ~ / . 
(iii) (TRANSITIVE) if / ~ C/ and g ^ h, then f ^ h. 
Therefore C^{X,Y) 
can be partioned into classes of homotopic functions. 
It is worth noticing that, since 
C«([0,1],C^X,F)) 
we have the following. 
C\[0,l]xX,Y), 
(8.1) 
8.2 Proposition. / and g e C^{X,Y) 
are homotopic if and only if they 
belong to the same path-connected component of C^{X,Y) 
endowed with 
uniform distance. The subsets of C^{X,Y) 
of homotopy equivalent maps 
are the path-connected components of the metric space C^{X,Y) 
with uni-
form distance.

be metric spaces. Show the equality (8.1), which we understand as an 
isometry of metric spaces. 
8.4 ^. Let y be a convex subset of a normed linear space. Then every continuous 
map f : X -^ Y from an arbitrary metric space X is homotopic to a constant. In 
particular, constant maps are homotopic to each other. [Hint: Fix yo eY 
and consider 
the homotopy H : [0,1] x X -^ Y given by H{t, x) := tyo + (1 - 
t)f(x).] 
8.5 ^. Let X be a convex set of a normed linear space. Then every continuous map 
/ : X —)• y into an arbitrary metric space is homotopic to a constant function. [Hint-
Fix XQ e X and consider the homotopy H : [0,1] x X —>• y given by H{t,x) 
:= 
f{txo + (1 - t)x).] 
8.6 5. Two constant maps are homotopic iff their values can be connected by a path. 
8.7 1[. Let X be a linear normed space. Show that the homotopy classes of maps 
/ : X —)> y correspond to the path-connected components of Y. 
According to Exercises 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6, all maps into W^ or defined on 
R"^ are homotopic to constant maps. However, this is not always the case 
for maps from or into S'^ := {x | ||x|| = 1}, the unit sphere of M^+^ 
8.8 Proposition. We have 
(i) Let f^g : X -^ S'^ be two continuous maps such that f{x) and g{x) 
are never antipodal, i.e., g{x) ^ -f{x) 
Mx G X, then f and g are 
homotopic; in particular, if f : X —^ S'^ is not onto, then f is homo-
topic to a constant. 

252 
8. Some Topics from the Topology of R^ 
Figure 8.3. The figure suggests a homotopy of closed curves, that is a continuous family 
of closed paths, from a knotted loop to S^. But, it can be proved that there is no family 
of homeomorphisms of the ambient space E^ that, starting from the identity, deforms 
the initial knotted loop into S^. 
(ii) Let 5^+1 := {x G W^^ | |x| < 1}. .4 continuous map f : S"" ^ Y is 
homotopic to a constant if and only if f has a continuous extension 
F : B^+i -^ Y. 
Proof, (i) Since f{x) and g{x) are never antipodal, the segment tg{x) H- (1 — t)f(x), 
t € [0,1], never goes through the origin; a homotopy of f to g is then 
\tg(x) + {l 
-t)f{x)\ 
Notice that y —>• A is the radial projection from R^^"^ onto the sphere 5^^, hence H{t, x) 
is the radial projection onto the sphere of the segment tg{x) + (1 — t)f(x), 
t 6 [0,1]. 
The second part of the claim follows by choosing yo ^ S'^\ f{X) 
and g{x) := —yo-
(ii) If F : B"+i -^ y is a continuous function such that F(x) = f{x) Vx G S"^, then 
the map H(t^x) 
:= F(tx), 
(t^x) G [0,1] x 5^^, is continuous, hence a homotopy of 
i/(0, x) = F(0) to if (1, x) = f{x). Conversely, if if : [0,1] x 5^ ^ F is a homotopy of 
a constant map g(x) = p eY 
to f, if (0, x) = p, if (1, x) = f{x) \/x G X, then the map 
F : B^+i ^ y defined by 
I p 
if X = 0 
is a continuous extension of / to 5^+^ with values into Y. 
• 
b. Homotopy classes 
Denote by [X, Y\ the set of homotopy classes of continuous maps / : X ^ 
Y and by [/] G [X, Y] the equivalence class of /. The following two propo-
sitions collect some elementary facts. 
8.9 Proposition. We have 
(i) (COMPOSITION) Let f,f'\X-^Y,g,g':Y-~^Z 
he continuous 
maps. If f ^ f and g ~ g', then g o f r^ g' o f'. 
(ii) (RESTRICTION) If f,g : X -^Y 
are homotopic and Ac X, then f\A 
is homotopic to g\A ^^ maps from A to Y. 

8.1 Homotopy 
253 
(iii) (CARTESIAN PRODUCT) f,g : X ^YixY2 
are homotopic if and only 
if ^i^ f and TTi o g are homotopic (with values in Yi) where i = 1,2 
and TTi, i = 1,2 denote the projections on the factors. 
A trivial consequence of Proposition 8.9 is that the set [X^Y] is a 
topological invariant of both X and Y. In a sense [X, Y] gives the number 
of "diflFerent" ways that X can be mapped into F, hence measures the 
"topological complexity" of Y relative to that of X. 
Let (/? : X ^ y be a continuous map and let Z be a metric space. Then 
(f defines a pull-back map 
^*:[Y,Z]^[X,Z] 
defined by (p^[/] := [/ o <^], as Proposition 8.9 yields that the homotopy 
class oi f o (p depends on the homotopy class of /. Similarly cp induces a 
push-forward map 
defined by (p:^[g] := [p o g]. 
8.10 Proposition. We have the following. 
(i) Let (f^ip : X —^Y be continuous and homotopic^ (/p ~ t/^. Then (^^ = 
^ ^ and (f:^ = -0^. 
(ii) Let (p : X ^^Y 
and rj :Y ^^ Z be continuous. Then 
{rj o if)"^ = ip"^ orf^ 
and 
[T] O ip)^ = ^# o ^#-
c. Hcsmotopy equivalence of sets 
8.11 Definition. Two metric spaces X and Y are said homotopy equiv-
alent, or are said to have the same homotopy type, if there exist two 
continuous maps f : X -^ Y and g : Y ^y X such that g o f ^ Idx and 
f O g rsj I d y . 
If f : X -^ Y and g : Y -^ X define a homotopy equivalence between X 
and y, then for every space Z we infer from Proposition 8.10 
g* o f* 
= Id[y,z], 
f* 
og* 
= Id[x,Zl-
Similarly 
hence [Z, X] and [Z, Y] are in a one-to-one correspondence. 
8.12 Definition. A space X is called contractible if it is homotopy equiv-
alent to a space with only one point, equivalently, if the identity map 
i : X ^^ X of X is homotopic to a constant map. 
By definition if X is contractible to XQ G X, then X is homotopic equivalent 
to {xo}, hence [Z,X] and [X, Z] reduces to a point for any space Z. 

254 
8. Some Topics from the Topology of R"^ 
Figure 8.4. W^ is contractible. 
8.13 Example. R'^ is contractible. In fact, H(t,x) 
:= (1 - t)x, {t,x) € [0,1] X R^, 
contracts R'^ to the origin. 
In general, describing the set [X, Y] is a very difficult task even for the 
simplest case of the homotopy of spheres, [5^, S'^], k,n>l. 
However, the 
following may be useful. 
8.14 Definition. LetX be a metric space. We say that A C X is a retract 
of X if there exists a continuous map p : X ^^ A, called a retraction^ such 
that p{x) = x\/x £ A. Equivalently A is a retract of X if the identity map 
Id A : A-^ A extends to a continuous map r : X —^ A. 
We say that A C X is a deformation retract of X if A is a retract of 
X and the identity map Idx -^ X is homotopic to a retraction of X to A. 
Let ^ C X be a deformation retract of X and denote by iA '• A —^ X 
the inclusion map. Since Idx : X ^ X is homotopic to the retraction map 
r : X —> yl, we have 
r o iA = Idyl, 
z^ o r = r ~ Idx, 
hence A and X are homotopic equivalent. By the above, for every space 
Z we have [A, Z] = [X, Z] and [Z, A] = [Z, X] as sets, thus reducing the 
computation of [Z, A] and of [X, Z] respectively, to the smaller sets [Z, X] 
and [A,Z]. 
The following observation is useful. 
8.15 Proposition. Let A C X be a subset of a metric space X. Then 
A is a deformation retract of X if and only if A is a retract of X and 
Idx : X —^ X is homotopic to a continuous map g : X ^^ A. 
Figure 8.5. S^ is a deformation retract of the torus T C R^. 

8.1 Homotopy 
255 
Figure 8.6. 5^ is a deformation retract of B^ \ {0}. 
Proof. It is enough to prove sufficiency. Let r : X —^ A he a retraction and let h : 
[0,1] X X —)- X be a homotopy of Idx to g, /i(0,x) = x, h{l,x) 
= g{x) Vx G X. Then 
the map 
yh{2-2t,x) 
if I < t < 1 
is continuous since /i(l, x) = r(/i(l, x)) Vx and shows that Idx is homotopic to r : X ^^

retracts of the third figure.

Figure 8.8. M\dM 
is not a retract of M, but M and M\dM 
are homotopy equivalent. 
d. Relative homotopy 
Intuitively, see Figure 8.1, the maps Ht : X —^ Y^ t ^ [0,1] defined by 
Ht{x) := H(t^x), are a continuous family of continuous maps that deform 
/ to^. 
In particular, it is important to note that, in considering homotopy of 
maps, the target space is relevant and must be kept fixed in the discussion. 
As we shall see in the sequel, maps with values in Y that are nonhomotopic 
may become homotopic when seen as maps with values in Z 
DY. 
Also, it is worth considering homotopies of a suitable restricted type. 
For instance, when working with paths with fixed endpoints, it is better to 
consider homotopies such that for each t all curves x -^ Ht{x) := H{t,x), 
X e [0,1], have the same fixed endpoints for all t e [0,1]. Similarly, when 
working with closed curves, it is worthwile considering homotopies H{t, x) 
such that every curve x -^ Ht{x) := H{t, x) is closed for all t G [0,1]. 
8.22 Definition. Let C C C^{X,Y). 
We say that f,g eC are homotopic 
relative to C if there exists a continuous map H[0,1] x X -^ Y such that 
if(0,x) = f{x), if(l,x) = g{x) and the curves x -^ Ht{x) := 
H{t,x) 
belong to C for all t G [0,1]. 
It is easy to check that the relative homotopy is an equivalence relation. 
The set of relative homotopy classes with respect to C C C^(X, F) is 
denoted by [X,r]c. 
Some choices of the subset C C C^([X, Y]) are relevant. 
(i) Let Z C y and C '.=^ {f e C0([0, l],Y) \ f{X) 
C Z}. In this case a 
homotopy relative to C is a homotopy of maps with values in Z. 
(ii) Let X = [0,1], a,6 G y and C := {/ G C^{X,Y) \ /(O) = a, /(I) = 
6}. Then a homotopy relative to C is called a homotopy with fixed 
endpoints. 
(iii) Let X = [0,1], and let C := {f e C0([0,1],!^) | /(O) = /(I)} be the 
class of closed curves, or loops^ in Y. In this case two curves homotopic 
relative to C are said loop-homotopic. 
Recall that a closed curve 7 : [0,1] ^' X can be reparametrized 
as a continuous map 5 \ S^ ^^ X from the unit circle S^ C C 
Now let 7i,72 : [0,1] -^ X he two loops and let 81^82 '- S^ ^^ X 
be two corresponding reparametrizations on 5^. Then, recalling that 

8.1 Homotopy 
257 
homotopies are simply paths in the space of continuous maps, it is 
trivial to show that 71 and 72 are loop-homotopic if and only if 61 and 
S2 are homotopic as maps from S^ into X. Therefore [[0,1],X]c = 
[S\X]. 
Finally, notice that the intuitive idea of continuous deformation has several 
subtle aspects, see Figure 8.3. 
8.1.2 Homotopy of loops 
a. The fundamental group with base point 
Let X be a metric space and let XQ G X. It is convenient to consider 
loops 7 : [0,1] ^ X with 7(0) = 7(1) = XQ. We call them loops with base 
point XQ. Also, one can introduce a restricted form of homotopy between 
loops with base point XQ by considering loop-homotopies if (t, x) such that 
X -^ H{t, x) has base point XQ for every t. We denote the corresponding 
homotopy equivalence relation and homotopy classes repectively, by ^xo 
and []xo. Finally, 
7ri(X,{xo}) 
denotes the set of loop-homotopy with base point XQ classes of loops with 
base point XQ. 
8.23 %. Show that 7ri(X, XQ) reduces to a point if X is contractible and XQ G X. [Hint: 
Show that 7ri(X,xo) C [S^^X].] 
b. The group structure on 7ri(X, a^o) 
Given two loops (/?,-0 : [0,1] -^ X with base point XQ, we may consider 
the junction of (f and ip denoted hy (p*ip as the loop with base point XQ 
defined by 
^.m:=h''^ 
if ^^[0,1/2], 
\^{2t-l) 
iftG [1/2,1]. 
Since the homotopies with fixed endpoints can be joined, too, we have 
(fi * ^1 ~ (f * 7p if (pi,<P25'0i, V^2 are loops with base points XQ such that 
^1 ^xo ^ and -01 r^xo V^- Thus the junction induces an operation on 
7ri(X,{xo}), 
* : 7ri(X, {xo}) X 7ri(X, {XQ}) -^ 7ri(X, {XQ}) 
still denoted by *, defined by [(p]xo * [V^]xo •= [^ * V^la^o- ^^ i^ ^^^y ^^ ^^^ ^^^ 
following. 
8.24 Proposition. The map * has the following properties. 
(i) (ASSOCIATIVITY) Let f,g,h 
: [0,1] -^ X be three loops with base 
point XQ. Then {[f]xo * [g]xo) * [h]xo = [f]xo * ([^]xo * Mxo)-

8. Some Topics from the Topology of W 
(ii) (RIGHT AND LEFT IDENTITIES) Let f : [0,1]-^ X be a loop with base 
point xo and let e^^o • [0? I] -^ X be the constant map, Cxoit) := XQ. 
Then [e^J^^ * [/]^o = ifUo * [exolxo = IDxc 
(iii) (INVERSE) Let ex^ : [0,1] -^ X be the constant map exo{t) := XQ and, 
for a loop / : [0,1] -^ X with base point XQ, let / : [0,1] -^ X be the 
map J{t) := /(I - 1 ) . Then [f]xo * [7]:ro = [J]xo * [f]xo = [exol^o-
In this way the junction of_loops defines a natural group structure on 
7ri(X,{a;o}), where [f]-^ = [f]^^-
8.25 Definition. Let X be a space and XQ G X. The set 7ri(X, {XQ}) of 
homotopy classes of loops with base point XQ has a natural group structure 
induced by the junction operation of loops. We then call 7ri(X, {XQ}) the 
fundamental group of X, or the first homotopy group of X, with base 
point XQ . 
c. Changing base point 
By definition 7ri(X, XQ) depends on the base point XQ. However, if XQ, xi G 
X, suppose that there exists a path a : [0,1] -^ X from XQ to Xi and let 
a : [0,1] -^ X, 'a{t) := a(l — t), be the reverse path from xi to XQ. For 
every loop 7 with base point XQ, the curve a * 7 * a is a loop with base 
point xi. Since evidently a * 71 * a ~ a * 72 * a if 71 ~ 72, a defines a map 
a* : 7ri(X,xo) -^ 7ri(X,xi) by 
<^*([7]a:o) '= [ a * 7 * ^ ] x i , 
(8.2) 
where we have denoted by [ ]a;o and []xi respectively, the homotopy classes 
of curves with base point XQ and xi. It is trivial to see that a* is a group 
isomorphism, thus concluding the following. 
8.26 Proposition. 7ri(X, XQ) and 7ri{X,Xi) are isomorphic as groups for 
all xo,xi G X if X is path-connected. 
Thus, for a path-connected space X, all groups 7ri(X, XQ), XQ e X are 
the same group up to an isomorphism. We call it the fundamental group 
or the first homotopy group of X, and we denote it by 7TI{X). 
However, 
the map a* defined by (8.2) depends explictly on a. 
For convenience, let ha '-= a*. Examples show that in general ha 7^ hp 
if a and /? have the same endpoints, but we have 
h^^ha{[j]xi) 
= h^^{[aja]xo) = [~pajaP]x, = [^a]a;i * Hxi * [P(^]x^-
This implies that 
(i) ha = h(3 if a and (3 are homotopic with the same endpoints^ 
(ii) ha is always the same map, independently from a, if 7ri{X^xi) is a 
commutative group.

Thus, attaching a path to XQ to any curve 7 : 5^ —> X, we can construct 
a loop with base point XQ and, at the homotopy level, this construction is 
actually a map h : [S^^X] ^^ 7ri(X,xo). It is clear that h is one-to-one, 
since its inverse is just the inclusion oi7Ti{X,xo) into [5^,X]. 
8.27 Proposition. Let X be path-connected. If 7ri{X) is commutative, 
then the map h : [S^^X] -^ ^i{^) 
described above is bijective. 
8.28 Definition. We say that a space X is simply connected ifX is path-
connected and 7ri(X, xo) reduces to a point for some XQ E X (equivalently 
for any XQ e X by Proposition 8.26). 
8.29 %. Show that X is simply connected if X is path-connected and contractible. 
d. Invariance properties of the fundamental group 
Let us now look at the action of continuous maps on the fundamental 
group. Let X, Y be metric spaces and let XQ G X. To any continuous map 
/ : X —> y one associates a map 
/# :7ri(X,xo) ^7ri(y,/(xo)) 
defined by /#([7]xo) •= [/°7]/(xo)-1^ is easy to see that the above definition 
makes sense, and that actually / ^ is a group homomorphism. 
8.30 Proposition. We have the following. 
(i) Let f : X -^ Y and g : Y ^^ Z be two continuous maps. Then 
{9of)^=g^of^.

(ii) If Id : X -^ X is the identity map and XQ G X, then Id^ is the 
identity map on 7ri(X, {XQ}). 
(iii) Suppose Y is path-connected^ and let F : [0^1]xX -^Y be a homotopy 
of two maps f and g from X into Y. Then the curve a(t) := F{t,xo), 
t G [0,1], joins /(xo) to g{xQ) and g^ = a^o f^. 
Proof, (i) and (ii) are trivial. To prove (iii), it is enough to show that / 0 7 and a0^070a 
are homotopic for every loop 7 with base point XQ . A suitable homotopy is given by the 
map H{t, x) : [0,1] -^ X -> y defined by 
H(t,x):= 
Of course, Proposition 8.30 (i) and (ii) imply that a homeomorphism 
h : X -^ Y induces an isomorphism between 7ri(X, XQ) and 7ri(y,/i(xo)). 
Therefore, on account of Proposition 8.26, the fundamental group is a 
topological invariant of path-connected spaces. Actually, from (iii) Propo-
sition 8.30 we infer the following. 
8.31 Theorem. Let X, Y be two path-connected homotopy equivalent 
spaces. Then 7ri{X) and 7ri{Y) are isomorphic. 
Proof. Let f : X -^ Y, g :Y —i- X he continuous such that gofr^ 
Idx and fogr^ 
Idy 
and let XQ £ X. Then we have two induced maps 
/ # : 7 r i ( X , x o ) - 7 r i ( y , / ( x o ) ) , 
g^ : 7ri(y,/(xo)) - 
7ri(X,p(/(xo))). 
Let if : [0,1] X X -^ X be the homotopy of Idx to g o f and let K : [0,1] : Y -^ Y 
be the homotopy of Idy to f o g. If a\{i) := H{t,xo), 
a2{t) := K{t,f(xo)), 
then by 
Proposition 8.30 we infer 
g#of^ 
= ( p o / ) # = r ( a i ) * o ( I d x ) # = (ai)*, 
/ # o p # = ( / o p ) # = ( a 2 ) * ( I d y ) # = (a2)*. 
Since (ai)* and (a2)* are isomorphisms, f^ is injective and surjective.

8.1.3 Covering spaces 
a. Covering spaces 
A useful tool to compute, at least in some cases, the fundamental group, 
is the notion of covering space. 
8.32 Definition. A covering of Y is a continuous map p : X —^Y from a 
topological space X, called the total space, onto Y such that for all x EY 
there exists an open set U C Y containing x such that p~^{U) = UaVa, 
where Va are pairwise disjoint open sets and p^y^ is a homeomorphism 
between Va and U. Each Va is called a slice of p~^{U). 

8.1 Homotopy 
261 
Figure 8.10. 
8.33 Example. Let Y be any space. Consider the disjoint union of fc-copies of y , that 
we can write as a Cartesian product X := Y x {1,2,..., fc}. Then the projection map 
p : A" —)• y , p{{y, i)) = y, is a. covering of X. 
8.34 Example. Let S^ be the unit circle of C. Then the circular motion p : R —> S*^, 
p{6) = e* '^'^^ is a covering of S^. 
8.35 Example. Let X C M^ be the treice of the regular helix 7(t) = (cost,sint,t). 
Then p : X —> 5^ where p : R^ —^ E^, p{x,y,z) 
:= {x,y), 
is the orthogonal projection 
on M^, is another covering of 5^. 
8.36 1. Let p : X —>^ y be a covering of Y. Suppose that Y is connected and that for 
some point yo E Y the set p~^(yo) 
is finite and contains k points. Show that 
p~^{y) 
contains k points for all y G y . In this case, we say that p : X —> y is a k-fold 
covering 
o f y . 
8.37 f. Show that p:R+ 
-^ S'^, p(t) := e**, is not a covering of S^. 
8.38 %. Show that, if p : X —>^ X and q : Y -^ Y are coverings respectively, of X and 
y , then pxq:XxY^yXxY,px 
q{x, y) := (p(a;), q{y)), is a covering of X x y . In 
particular, if p : E -^ S'^ is defined by p(t) := e* ^'^S then the map p x p : E x R ^ 5^ x 5^ 
is a covering of the torus S^ x S^. Figure 8.10 shows the covering map for the standard 
torus of M^ that is homeomorphic to the torus S^ x S^ C E^. 
8.39 1. Think of 5^ as a subset of C. Show that the map p : 5^ -^ 5 \ p{z) = z^, 
is a two-fold covering of S^. More generally, show that the map S^ —>• S^ defined by 
pit) := z"^ is a |n|-covering of 5Mf n G Z \ {0}. 
8.40 %. Show that the map p : E-j. x 
covering of S^ x E+. 
E+ X S^ defined by p{s,e) = (s,e*^) is a 
8.41 %. Show that the map p : E+ x E defined by p{p,0) := pe*^ is a covering of 
E 2 \ {0}. 
b. Lifting of curves 
In connection with coverings the notion of (continuous) lift is crucial. 
8.42 Definition. Let p : X ^^ Y he a covering of Y and let f : Z ^^ Y 
be a continuous map. A continuous map f : Z -^ X such that po f = f is 
called a Hft of f on X. 

262 
8. Some Topics from the Topology of I 
8.43 Example. Let p : R -^ 5^ be the covering of 5^ given by p{t) = e^K A Uft of 
/ : [0,1] —>- S^ is a continuous map /i : [0,1] —^ R such that f{t) = e*^(*). Looking at t 
as a time variable, h{t) is the angular evolution of f{t) as f(t) moves on S^. 
8.44 Example. Not every function can be lifted. For instance, consider the covering 
p :R-^ 
S^, p{t) = e*^^*. Then the identity map on S^ cannot be lifted to a continuous 
map /i : 5^ —>• R. In fact, parametrizing maps from S^ as closed curves parametrized 
on [0,27r], h would be periodic. On the other hand, if h was a lift of 2; = e**, we would 
have e** = ^iHt)^ which implies that h{t) = t-fconst, a contradiction. 
However, curves can be lifted to curves that are not necessarily closed. 
Let X be a metric space. We say that X is locally path-connected if every 
point X e X has an open path-connected neighborhood U. 
8.45 Proposition. Let p : X -^ Y be a covering ofY 
and let XQ G X. 
Suppose that X and Y are path-connected and locally path-connected. Then 
(i) each curve /? : [0,1] ^> F with ^(0) = P{XQ) has a unique continuous 
lift a : [0,1] -^ X such that po a = (3 and Q;(0) = xo, 
(ii) for every continuous map k : [0,1] x [0,1] -^ F with A:(0,0) = p{xo), 
there is a unique continuous lift h : [0,1] x [0,1] -^ X such that 
/i(0,0) = xo and p{h{t, s)) = k{t, s) for all {t, s) e [0,1] x [0,1]. 
Proof. Step 1. Uniqueness 
in (i). Suppose that for the two curves ai,Q!2 we have 
p(ai{t)) 
= p{cx2{t)) Vt e [0,1] and ai(0) = a2(0). The set E := {t\ai(t) 
= a2(0} is 
closed in [0,1]; since p is a local homeomorphism, it is easily seen that E is also open 
in [0,1]. Therefore E = [0,1]. 
Step 2. Existence in (i). We consider the subset 
^ := "s i G [0,1] 3 a continuous curve at : [0, t] -^ X 
such that a(0) = XQ and p{at{e)) = 13(6) V(9 E [0,i]} 
and shall prove that E is open and closed in [0,1] consequently, E = [0,1] as it is not 
empty. 
Let T E E and let U be an open neighborhood of OiriT) for which p^u is a, home-
omorphism. For a sufficiently small, a < CTQ, the curve s -^ j{s) 
:= (P|t/)~^(/3(5)), 
s G [r, r + cr], is continuous, 7(T) = ctrir) and p(a{s)) = /3(s), Vs € [r^r + cr]. Therefore 
for the curve a<r : [0, cr] —> X defined by 
, . 
I ar(s) 
if 0 < s < r, 
o^ais) := < 
- 
-
I 7(5) 
if r < 5 < r + cr, 
we have aa(t) = (3{t) for all t G [0, a], i.e., r -|- CTQ G £^ for some CTQ > 0 if r G £^, or, in 
other words, E is open in [0,1]. 
We now prove that E is closed by showing that T := sup£? G E. Let {tn} C E 
be a nondecreasing sequence that converges to T and for every n, let an : [0, in] -^ ^ 
be such that p{an{t)) 
= p{t) Vt G [0,tn]. Because of the uniqueness (Xr{t) = as{t) for 
all t G [0, r] if s < r, consequently a continuous curve a : [0, T[-^ X is defined so that 
p(a{t)) 
= p{t) Vt G [0, T[. It remains to show that we can extend continuously a at 
T. Let V be an open neighborhood of /3(T) such that p~^{V) 
— UjUj where Ua are 
pairwise disjoint open sets that are homeomorphic to V. Then f3{t) £ V iovt < t 
<T. 
Since a(\t,T[) 
is connected and the C/^'s are pairwise disjoint, we infer that a{t) must 

8.1 Homotopy 
263 
belong to a unique Ua, say Ui, ior t <t <T. It suffices now to extend by continuity a 
by setting a{T) := (p|^J-i(/?(T)). 
Step 3. (ii) Uniqueness follows from (i). In fact, if P 6 [0,1] x [0,1], 7 P is the segment 
joining (0,0) to P and /ii,/i2 : [0,1] —> [0,1] -^ X are such that p o hi = p o h2 in 
[0, l]x [0,1] with/ii(0,0) = ^2(0,0), from (i) we infer/ii(P) = h2{P), as hi\^p = /i2|7p-
Let us prove existence. Again by (i) there is a curve a{t) with a(0) = XQ and 
p{a(t)) 
= k(0,t) for all t, and, for each t, a curve s -^ h(s,t) 
such that p{h{s,t)) 
= 
k{s,t) with /i(0, t) = a{t). Of course fc(0,0) = a(0) = XQ and it remains to show that 
h : [0,1] X [0,1] -> X is continuous. Set Rs := [0,s[x[0,l] and RQ := {0} x [0,1]. 
Suppose h is not continuous and let (s, i) be a point in the closure of the points of 
discontinuity of h. Let U be an open and connected neighborhood of kite's) such that 
p^U is a homeomorphism. By lifting fcip(f/) we find a rectangle P C M"^ that has (s,t) as 
an interior point and a continuous function w : R -^ U with w{t,s) = h(t,'s) such that 
p{w{t,s)) 
= k{t,s) = p{h{t,s)) 
for all (t, s) 6 Ps"- Since w and /i are continuous in Pg-, 
they agree in Rs fl P. On the other hand, both h{t, s) and w{t, s) lift the same function 
/c(t, s), thus by (i) they agree, hence h{t,s) = w{t,s) is continuous in a neighborhood 
of (t, s): a contradiction. 
D 
8.46 Proposition. Let X and Y be path-connected and locally path-
connected metric spaces and let f : X —^ Y be a covering of Y. Let 
a,P : [0,1] -^ Y be two curves with a(0) = /?(0) and a{l) = ^3(1) that 
are homotopic with fixed endpoints and let a, 6 : [0,1] -^ X be their contin-
uous lifts that start at the same point a(0) = 6(0). Then a(\) = 6(1), and 
a and b are homotopic with fixed endpoints. 
Proof. Prom (i) Proposition 8.45 we know that a, (3 can be lifted uniquely to two curves 
a, 6 : [0,1] -^ X with a(0) = 6(0) = ao, p{ao) = a(0). Let k : [0,1] x [0,1] -> y be a 
homotopy between a and /5, i.e., k(0,t) = a{t), k{l,t) 
= P{t), k{s,0) = a(0) = /3(0), 
fc(s, 1) = a(l) = /?(1). By (ii) Proposition 8.45 we can lift k to /i, so that p{h{s,t)) 
= 
k{s, t) and A;(0,0) = a(0) = 6(0). Then ^ is a homotopy between a and 6 and in particular 
a(l) = ^(0,1) ^6(1). 
D 
8.47 Theorem. Let X and Y be path-connected and locally path-connec-
ted metric spaces and let p : X ^^ Y be a covering ofY. If Y is simply 
connected, then p : X ^^Y is a homeomorphism. 
Proof. Suppose there are xi,a;2 G X with p{xi) — p(x2)- Since X is connected, there 
is a curve a : [0,1] —>• X with a(0) = xi and a(l) = X2. Let 6 : [0,1] -^ X be 
the constant curve b{t) = xi. The image curves a{t) := p(a(i)) and P{t) := p{b(t)) are 
closed curves, hence homotopic, Y being simply connected. Proposition 8.46 then yields 
X2 =a{l) 
= 6(1) =xi. 
D 
8.48 Theorem. Let X and Y be path-connected and locally path-connec-
ted, and let p : X -^ Y be a covering of Y. Suppose that Z is path-
connected and simply connected. Then any continuous map f : Z —^Y has 
a lift f : Z -^ X. More precisely, given ZQ e Z and XQ G X, such that 
p{^o) = fi^o), there exists a unique continuous map f : Z -^ X such that 
f{zo) = xo andpoj 
= f. 
Proof. Let z ^ Z and let 7 : [0,1] ^^ Z be a curve joining ZQ to z. Then the curve 
OL{t) := /(7(t)), t e [0,1], in y has a lift to a curve a : [0,1] -> X with a(0) = XQ, 
see (i) Proposition 8.45, and Proposition 8.46 shows that a(l) depends on a(l) = f{z) 

264 
8. Some Topics from the Topology of R"^ 
and does not depend on the particular curve 7. Thus we define f{z) := a(l), and by 
definition f{zo) = XQ and pof = f. We leave to the reader to check that / is continuous. 
D 
c. Universal coverings and homotopy 
8.49 Definition. Let Y be a path-connected and locally path-connected 
metric space. A covering p : X -^ Y is said to be a universal covering of 
Y if X is path-connected, locally path-connected and simply connected. 
Prom Theorems 8.47 and 8.48 we immediately infer 
8.50 Theorem (Universal property). Let X, F, Z be path-connected 
and locally path-connected metric spaces. Let p . X -^ Y, q : Z -^ Y 
be two coverings of Y and suppose Z simply connected. Then q has a lift 
q: Z -^ X which is also a covering of X. Moreover q is a homeomorphism 
if X is simply connected, too. 
The relevance of the universal covering space in computing the homo-
topy appears from the following. 
8.51 Theorem. Let X and Y be path-connected and locally path-connec-
ted metric spaces and letp:X—^Y 
be the universal covering ofY. 
Then 
Vyo ^ Y 7ri(F,2/0) andp~^{yo) C X are one-to-one. 
Proof. Fix q € p~^(xo). 
For any curve a in F with base point XQ, denote by a : [0,1] ^• 
X its lift with a(0) = q. Clearly a is a curve in X which ends at a(l) € 
p~^{xo)' 
Moreover, if /3 is loop-homotopic to a in Y, then necessarily a(l) = 6(1), so the map 
a -^ a(l) is actually a map 
(pq : 7ri(y,xo) 
-^p~'^{xo). 
Of course (fq is surjective since any curve in X with endpoints in P~^{XQ) 
projects onto 
a closed loop in Y with base point XQ. Moreover, if (^q([7]) = ^q([<^])5 then the lifts c 
and d that start at the same point end at at the same point; consequently c and d are 
homotopic, as X is simply connected. Projecting the homotopy between c and d onto 
Y yields [7] = [S]. 
D 
d. A global invertibility result 
Existence of a universal covering p : X ^ F of a space Y can be proved 
in the setting of topological spaces. Observe that if X and Y are path-
connected and locally path-connected, and if p : X ^ Y is a. universal 
covering of Y, then Y is locally simply connected, i.e., such that Wy e Y 
there exists an open set F C F containing y such that every loop in V 
with base point at x is homotopic (in Y) to the constant loop x. It can be 
proved in the context of topological spaces that any path-connected, locally 
path-connected and locally simply-connected Y has a universal covering 
p : X -^ Y. We do not deal with such a general problem and confine 
ourselves to discussing whether a given continuous map f : X ^^ Y is a. 
covering of Y. 

8.1 Homotopy 
265 
Let X,Y 
be metric spaces. A continuous map / : X ^ Y" is a local 
homeomorphism if every x € X has an open neighborhood U such that 
/|[/ is a homeomorphism onto its image. We say that / is a proper map if 
f~^{K) 
is compact in X for every compact K 
CY. 
Clearly a homeomorphism from X onto its image /(X) C F is a local 
homeomorphism and a proper map. Also, if p : X -^ F is a covering of Y 
then p is a local homeomorphism. We have 
8.52 Theorem. Let X be path-connected and locally path-connected and 
let f : X -^Y 
be a local homeomorphism and a proper map. Then X and 
f{X) 
are open, path-connected and locally path-connected and f : X -^ 
f{X) 
is a covering of 
f{X). 
Before proving Theorem 8.52, let us introduce the Banach indicatrix of 
/ : X ^ R^ as the map 
Nf'.Y-^NU 
{oo}, 
Nf{y) := # { x G X | f{x) = y}. 
Evidently /(X) = {y \ Nf{y) > 1} and / is injective iff Nf{y) < 1 \/y. 
8.53 Lemma. Let f : X -^ Y be a local homeomorphism and a proper 
map. Then Nf is bounded and locally constant on /(X). 
Proof. Since / is a local homeomorphism, the set f~^{y) 
= {x £ X\f(x) 
= y} is 
discrete and in fact f~^{y) 
is finite, since / is proper. Let Nf{y) 
= k and f~^{y) 
= 
{xi,..., 
Xfc}. Since / is a local homeomorphism, we can find open disjoint neighborhoods 
[/i of xi, . . . , C/fe of Xk and an open neighborhood Vofy 
such that /| [/. : Uj —> V are 
homeomorphisms. In particular, for every y E V there is a unique Xj G Uj such that 
f(xj) 
= y.lt follows that Nf{y) > k^y 
^V. 
We now show that for every y there exists 
a neighborhood Woiy^WcV, 
such that Nf{y) 
< k holds for all y ^W. 
Suppose, in 
fact, that for a y there is no neighborhood W such that N{y) < k for y EW, then there 
is a sequence {yi} C W, yt ^>- y with N{yi) > k, and points fi ^ Ui U • • - U Uk with 
/(?i) — Vi- The set f~^{{yi} 
U {y}) is compact since / is proper, thus possibly passing 
to a subsequence {^i} converges to a point ^ and necessarily ^ ^ t/i U • • • U t/^; passing to 
the limit we also find /($) = y: a. contradiction since ^ is different from x i , . . . ,Xfc. 
D 
Proof of Theorem 8.52. Prom Lemma 8.53 we know that, for every y G Y^ 
f~^{y) 
contains finitely many points {xi, X2, •. •, xj^} where N is locally constant. If t/^, i = 
1,... 
,N, Ui 3 Xi and V 3 y are open and homeomorphic sets, we then set 
V = ntiVi n {3/ e y I Nf{y) = N], 
Wi := ifiuX'C^)-
Clearly V is open and / " ^ (V) is a finite sum of disjoint open sets that are homeomorphic 
to V. 
D 
As a consequence of Theorem 8.47 we then infer the following useful 
global invertibility theorem. 
8.54 Theorem. Let X be path-connected and locally path-connected, and 
let f : X ^^Y 
be a local homeomorphism that is proper. If f{X) 
is simply 
connected, then f is injective, hence a homeomorphism between X and 
fix). 

266 
8. Some Topics from the Topology of R^ 
Proof, f : X -^ f(^) 
is a covering by Theorem 8.52. Theorem 8.47 then yields that / 
is one-to-one, hence a homeomorphism of X onto f{X). 
D 
8-1.4 A few examples 
a. The fundamental group of S^ 
The map p : R -^ 5^, p{t) = e^^^* is a universal covering of S^. Therefore 
for any XQ G 5^, p~^{xo) = Z as sets. Therefore, see Theorem 8.51, one 
can construct an injective and surjective map 
that maps [a] to the end value a(l) G Z of the lift a of a with a(0) = 0. 
We have 
8.55 Lemma. ipxQ : 7ri(5^,xo) -^ Z is a group isomorphism. 
Proof. Let a,/3 he two loops in S^ with base point XQ and a, b the liftings with a(0) = 
6(0) = 0. If n := (po{[a]) and m = (/?o([/?]), we define c : [0,1] -^ M by 
^ ^ ^ ^ _ , _ 
s e [0,1/2], 
, ^ U{2s) 
| n + 6 ( 2 s - l ) 
sG [1/2,1]. 
It is not diflftcult to check that c is the lift of a * /? with c(0) = 0 so that 
^o([a] * IP]) = Ml^ 
* P]) = c(l) = n + m = <foM) + 
MW)-
D 
Since (pxQ is a group isomorphism and Z is commutative, 7ri(S'^,xo) is 
commutative, and there is an injective and bijective map h : [5^,5^] —^ 
7ri(X, xo), see Proposition 8.27. The composition map 
deg : (f{S\S') 
-> Z, 
deg(7) := 
f.oihib])) 
is called the degree on 5^, and by construction we have the following. 
8.56 Theorem. Two maps f,g : S^ —^ S^ have the same degree if and 
only if they are homotopic. 
Later we shall see that we can recover the degree mapping more directly. 
8.57 %, Show that the fundamental group of M^ \ {0} is Z.

The figure eight is the union of two circles A and B with a point XQ in

If a is a loop based at XQ that goes clockwise once around A, and a~^ 
is the loop that goes counterclockwise once around A, and similarly for 6, 
6~^, then the cycle aba~^b~^ is a loop that cannot be unknotted in AUB 
while aa~^bb~^ can. 
More precisely, one shows that the fundamental group of the figure 
eight is the noncommutative free group on the generators a and b. Indeed, 
this can be proved using the following special form of the so-called Seifert-
Van Kampen theorem. 
8.58 Theorem. Suppose X = UyjV, where U, V are open path-connected 
sets and U H V is path-connected and simply connected. Then for any 
XQ eU nV, 7ri(X, Xo) is the free product ofTTi{U,xo) and 7ri(y, XQ). 
8.59 %. Show that the fundamental group of M? \ {XQ, xi} is isomorphic to the funda-
mental group of the figure eight. 
8.60 %. Show that 7ri(X x Y, {xo,yo)) 
is isomorphic to 7ri(X,XQ) X ni{Y,yo), 
in par-
ticular the fundamental group of the torus S^ x S^ 
i s Z x Z . 
8.61 %, Let X = Ai U ^2 U • • • U An where each Ai is homeomorphic to S^, 
and 
AiCiAj = {XQ} Hi ^ j . Show that TTI{X, XQ) is the free group on n generators a i , . . . , an 
where a^ is represented by a path that goes around Ai once. 
8.62 %. Let X be the space obtained by removing n points of M."^. Show that TTI(X, XQ) 
is a free group on n generators a i , . . . ,an, where ai is represented by a closed path 
which goes around the ith hole once. 
c. The fundamental group of S'^^ n > 2 
The following result is also a consequence of Theorem 8.58. 
8.63 Theorem. Let X = U UV where U and V are simply connected 
open sets of X and UDV is path-connected. Then X is simply connected, 
i.e., 
7ri(X, Xo) = 0. 
As a consequence we have the following. 
8.64 Proposition. The sphere S'^ C R"^"^^ is simply connected, i.e., 
7ri(5^,xo) = 0 
ifn>2. 

268 
8. Some Topics from the Topology of R"^ 
Proof. Let ps and pN be respectively, the south pole and the north pole of the sphere. 
The stereographic projection from the south (north) pole establishes a homeomor-
phism between 5 ^ \ {ps} (respectively, S"^ \ {PN}) and R^. Thus 7ri(S'^ \ {ps},xo) 
= 
7ri(S''^ \ {PN}^XO) 
= 0 Wxo ^ 
PS,PN- 
By Theorem 8.63 it suffices to show that 
S'^\{PS,PN} 
is path-connected. For that we notice that the stereographic projection is 
a homeomorphism between S^ \ {PS,PN} 
and M^ \ {0} which in turn is path-connected 
if n > 2. 
D 
Since the fundamental groups of R"^+^ \ {0} and S'^ are isomorphic, see 
Theorem 8.31, equivalently we can state 
8.65 Proposition. W^ \ {0} is simply connected 
ifn>2. 
8.66 %. Show that R^, n > 2, and R^ are not homeomorphic. 
8.1.5 Brouwer's degree 
a. The degree of maps S^ -^ S^ 
A more analytic presentation of the mapping degree for maps S^ —> S^ 
is the following. Think of S^ as the unit circle in the complex plane, so 
that the rotations of S^ write as complex multiplication, and represent 
loops in S^ as maps f : S^ -^ S^ or by 27r-periodic functions 6 -^ /(e^^), 
8.67 Lemma. Let f : S^ —^ S^ be continuous. There exists a unique 
continuous function /i: R ^ R such that 
{ h{0) = 0. 
(8.3) 
Proof. Consider the covering p : E —»> 5^ of 5^ given by p{t) := e**. The loop g{z) := 
f(z)/f{l) 
has base point 1 6 5'^. Then by the Ufting argument. Proposition 8.45, there 
exists a hft /i : R —• R such that (8.3) holds. The uniqueness follows directly from (8.3). 
In fact, if /n,/i2 verify (8.3), then hi(0) - h2(0) = k{e)2n where k{e) € Z. As hi and 
/i2 are continuous, k{0) is constant, hence k(6) = k{0) = 0. 
D 
Let / : 5^ -^ 5^ be continuous and let /i : R ^ R be as in (8.3). Of 
course, for every 0 we have 
h{0 + 27r) - h{e) = 2k{e)TT 
for some integer k{6) G Z. Since h is continuous, k is continuous, hence 
constant. Observe that k = h{2n) — h{0) = h{27r) and k is independent of 
the initial point /(I). In particular, f : S^ -^ S^ and / / / ( I ) : S^ -^ S^ 
have the same degree. 

8.1 Homotopy 
269 
8.68 Definition. Let f : S^ ^ S^ and let h be as in (8.3). There is a 
unique integer d G Z such that 
h{e + 27r) - h{e) =d27r 
V6> G R. 
The number d is called the winding number, or degree, of the map f : 
S^ -^ S^^ and it is denoted by deg(/). 
8.69 Theorem. Two continuous maps /o,/i *. S^ -^ S^ have the same 
degree if and only if they are homotopic. 
Proof. Let f : S^ —>• 5^. We have already observed that f{z) and f{z)/f{l) 
have the 
same degree. On the other hand, f{z) and f(z)/f(l) 
are also trivially homotopic. To 
prove the theorem it is therefore enough to consider maps /o, / i with the same base 
point, say /(I) = 1. 
(i) Assume / o , / i are homotopic with base point 1 G 5^. By the lifting argument, 
the liftings ho, hi of / o , / i characterized by (8.3) have /ii(27r) = /i2(27r), hence 
deg(/i) = /ii(27r) - ^i(O) = hi{2n) = h2{2n) = /i2(27r) - /i2(0) = deg(/2). 
Conversely, let / : 5^ —>• 5^ be of degree d and let h be given by (8.3). Then the map 
k : [0,1] X 51 ^ S^ defined by 
fc(t, 6) := exp {th(e) + d{l- 
1)9) 
establishes a homotopy of / to the map if : S^ -^ S^, (f{z) = z^. Therefore, if /o and 
/ i have the same degree d and base point 1 G S^, then they are both homotopic to the 
same map (f{z) — z^. 
• 
Finally we observe that deg(z^) = d'id elt and that, if / and g have 
the same base point, deg(^ * /) = deg(^) + deg(/). 
b. An integral formula for the degree 
Let / : 5^ ^ 51 and let /i : R ^ R be as in (8.3). Clearly, thinking 
of ^ as a time variable, h{6) is the angle evolution of the point /(e^^) 
on the circle. The degree of / corresponds to the total angle evolution, 
that is to the number of revolutions that f{z) does as z goes around 
5^ once counterclockwise, counting the revolutions positively if f{z) goes 
counterclockwise and negatively if f{z) goes clockwise. 
Suppose / : [0,27r] ^ 5^ is a loop of class C^, that \s 9 -^ /(e*^) is of 
class C \ and let /i: R ^ R be as in (8.3). Differentiating (8.3) we get 
ie'^f\e^^) 
= if{l)e'^^^^h'{e) 
= 
if{e^^)h\e) 
and taking the modulus \h'(6)\ = |/'(e^^)|. Therefore, h' is the angular 
velocity of f{z) times ±1 depending on the direction of motion of f{z) 
when z moves as e^^ on the unit circle. In coordinates, writing / := /i 4-i/2, 
we have / ' = / { + */2, hence 
We conclude using the fundamental theorem of calculus 

270 
8. Some Topics from the Topology of W

8.70 Proposition (Integral formula for the degree). Let / : 5^ —> 
S^ be of class C^. Then the lift h of f in (8.3) is given by 
h{t) - I'h'{e)de 
= I'ie''[- 
f2{e'')f[{e'') 
+ fi{e'')f^{e'')) 
d6. (8.4) 
In particular 
deg(/) = ^j^"'/i'W \dB 
h r ' " ' ' ( ~ /2(e^')/((e'^) + fi{e'')fiie'')) 
de. 
(8.5) 
One can define the lifting and degree of smooth maps by (8.5), showing 
the homotopy invariance in the context of regular maps, and then extend-
ing the theory to continuous functions by an approximation procedure. 
c. Degree and inverse image 
The degree oi f : S^ —^ S^ is strongly related to the number of roots of 
the equation f{x) = y counted with a suitable sign. 
8.71 Proposition. Let f : S^ -^ S^ be a continuous map with degree 
d £ Z. For every y e S^, there exist at least \d\ points xi, ^2,..., a;^^ in 
S^ such that f{xi) = y, 
, d. Furthermore, if f : S^ -^ S^ goes 
around S^ never turning back, i.e., if f{e^^) = e*^(^) where h : [0,27r] -^ R 
is strictly monotone, then the equation f{x) = y, y G S^, has exactly \d\ 
solutions. 
Proof. Let /i : R -^ R be as in (8.3) so that /i(27r) = 27rrf, and let s € [0, 2n[ be such 
that e*^ = y. For convenience suppose d > 0. 
The intermediate value theorem yields d distinct points 6i, ^2, • • •, ^d in [0,27r[ such 
that h(Oi) = 5, h{02) = 5-1- 2n, . . . , h{dd) = s + 2(d - l)7r, hence at least d distinct 
points xi, X2,..., 
Xd such that f{xj) 
= /(e*^J) = e^^^^^) — e*^ = y, see Figure 8.12. 
They are of course exactly d points xi, 0:2, •.., a;^ if /i is strictly monotone. 
D 

8.1 Homotopy 
271 
With the previous notation, suppose f : S^ -^ S^ is of class C^, let h 
be as in (8.3) and let y £ S^ and s G [0,27r[ be such that y = e^^. Assume 
that y is chosen so that the equation f{x) — y has a finite number of 
solutions and set 
iV+(/,2/) := #\e 
e S^ I h{0) = s 
(mod 27r), h\e) > o}, 
N.{f,y) 
:= #{<9 G S^ I h{0) = s 
(mod 27r), h\e) < o}. 
Then one sees that 
degif) ^ N+{f,y) - N.if,y), 
(8-6) 
see Figure 8.12. 
8.72 The fundamental theorem of algebra. Using the degree the-
ory we can easily prove that every complex polynomial 
P{z) := z"^ + aiz"^-^ + • • • + am-iz + ao 
has at least a complex root. Set Sj, := {z \ \z\ = p}. For p sufficiently large, 
P maps Sp in R^ \ {0}. Also deg(P/|P|) = m. In fact, by considering the 
homotopy 
Pt{z) := z"^ + tiaiz"^-^ + • • • + ao) 
t G [0,1], 
of P{z) to z"^, we have 
|p,(.)l>|.r(i-t(^ + ... + M ) ) 
vH^o. 
Thus |Pt('2^)| > 0 V t G [0,1] provided \z\ is large enough, consequently 
Pt{z)/\Pt{z)l 
t G [0,1], z G S'\ establishes a homotopy of P/\P\ to z^ 
from S^p into 5^, and we conclude that 
deg(P/|P|) = deg(z^) = m. 
8.73 %. Show that / : 5^ -^ 5^ has at least d-l 
fixed 
points if deg f = d. [Hint: See 
Figure 8.12.] 
d. The homological definition of degree for maps S^ -^ S^ 
Let / : 5^ -^ E^ be a continuous map, where for convenience we have 
denoted the target space S^ by T}. We fix in S^ and Y} two orientations, for 
instance the counterclockwise orientation, and we divide 5^ in small arcs 
whose images by / do not contain antipodal points (this is possible since 
/ : 5^ ^ E^ is uniformly continuous) and let zi,..., Zw, ^n+i = zi £ S^ 
the points of such subdivision indexed according to the chosen orientation 
in S^. For each i = 1..., n we denote by a^ the minimal arc connecting 
f{zi) with /(zi+i). We give it the positive sign if f{zi) precedes 7(2:^+1) 
with respect to the chosen orientation of E^, negative otherwise. Finally, 
for (^ G E^, ( 7^ f{zi) V i, we denote by p{() and n{Q the number of arcs 
ai respectively, positive and negative that contain ^. Then 
P(C) - n(C) = deg(/) G Z 
as we can see looking at the lift of /.

8.2 Some Results on the Topology of 
Though the presentation of these topics would require more space and 
advanced techniques, and in any case, it leads us away from the main 
path, we think that it is worthwhile to present here some results that are 
relevant in the sequel. However, we shall confine ourselves to illustrate the 
ideas and refer to the literature for complete proofs and more details. In 
the next two paragraphs we collect a few relevant results on the topology 
of maps into S"^ that we freely use in the rest of this section. 
8.2.1 Brouwer's theorem 
a. Brouwer's degree 
A topological degree, called Brouwer's degree, can be defined for continuous 
maps / : 5 " -^ 5^^, n > 2, either by extending the homological type 
arguments in the case n = 1 or, more generally, in terms of homology 
groups or, analytically, in terms of a sum with sign of the numbers of 
inverse images of a point, either pointwise or in the mean. Intuitively, one 
counts how many times the target 5^ is covered algebraically by the source 
S'^ via the map f} 
^ Both approaches require the development of more advanced and relevant techniques; 
we refer the reader e.g., to 
o J. Dugundji, Topology, Allyn and Bax:on, 1966, 
o L. Nirenberg, Topics in Nonlinear Analysis, AMS-CIMS, New York, 2001, 

8.2 Some Results on the Topology of M^ 
273 
In this way we end up with a map 
deg:C^(S^,5^)-^Z 
such that 
(i) deg(Id) = l, 
(ii) deg(/) = 0 if / is constant, 
(iii) deg(/) = (-l)"+Mf/(x) = - x , 
and we have the following. 
8.74 Theorem (Brouwer). Let /o,/i : S'^ -^ S'^ be continuous and ho-
motopic. Then deg(/o) = deg(/i). 
Indeed the degree completely characterizes the homotopy classes of 
continuous maps from S'^ into S'^. In fact, we have the following. 
8.75 Theorem (Hopf). Two continuous maps of S'^ into itself are ho-
motopic if and only if they have the same degree. Moreover, for each d eZ 
there is a map f : S^ ^^ S'^ with deg(/) = d. 
A map / : 5^ ^ 5^ C R^^^ is called antipodal if f{-x) 
= 
-f{x) 
Vx G 5^. For instance. Id : 5^ -> 5^ and - Id : 5^ ^ 5^ are antipodal. 
8.76 Theorem (Borsuk antipodal theorem). Let f : S'^ ^ S^ be a 
continuous antipodal map. Then deg(/) is odd; in particular f is not ho-
motopic to a constant map. 
b. Extension of maps into S^ 
The following two extension theorems for maps into S'^ are also crucial. 
We refer the reader e.g., to J. Dugundji, Topology^ AUyn and Bacon, 1966. 
8.77 Theorem. We have the following. 
(i) Let A C S'^ be a closed set. Every continuous map f : A -^ S^ 
extends to a continuous map F : S'^ -^ S'^. 
(ii) Let A C 5^^"^^ be closed and f : A ^ S^ be continuous. Pick a point 
Xi € Ui in every bounded connected component Ui of A^ := S'^'^^ \A. 
Then there is a continuous extension F : 5"^"^^ \ Ui{pi} -^ S"^. 
8.78 Theorem (Borsuk). Let A C R^, k > 1, be closed and let f : 
A ^^ S'^ be continuous. Then f can be extended to a continuous map 
F :R^ -^ S'^ if and only if f is homotopic to a constant map. 
Observing that A^ has a unique unbounded connected component if A 
is a compact subset of E^, and using the stereographic projection, it is not 
difficult to infer from Theorem 8.77 (i), (ii). 
o one of the several books on degree theory. 

274 
8. Some Topics from the Topology of R^ 
8.79 Theorem. We have the following. 
(i) Let A CW^ be compact. Then any continuous function from A into 
S'^ can be extended to a continuous F iW^ -^ S'^. 
(ii) Let A C R"'"^^ be compact and f : A ^^ S'^ be continuous. Pick a 
point Pi G Ui in every connected component Ui of A^. Then f can be 
extended to a continuous map F : W^^^ \ Ui{pi} —^ S"^. 
As a consequence of the Hopf theorem and Proposition 8.8 we imme-
diately infer the following. 
8.80 Proposition. A function f : S'^ ^^ S'^ has a continuous extension 
F : cl (5^+1) -> 5^ if and only if deg(/) - 0. 
8.81 Corollary. Let f : S'^ ^ W^^ \ {0} be a continuous map. Then 
there exists a continuous extension F : cl (J^^^^^) -^ W^'^^ \ {0} of f if and 
onlyifdegif/\f\) = 0. 
c. Brouwer's fixed point theorem 
Since the identity from 5^ into S'^ has degree one, and the constant maps 
have degree zero, from the homotopic invariance of the degree we conclude 
the following. 
8.82 Theorem (Brouwer). The identity map Id : S^ -^ S'^ is not ho-
motopic to a constant map. 
In other words, we cannot peel an orange without piercing the peel. 
Brouwer's theorem, whose content is quite intuitive, at least in dimen-
sion n = 2, has several interesting and surprising consequences. In fact, we 
have the following. 
8.83 Theorem. The following claims are equivalent 
(i) (BROUWER'S THEOREM) The identity map 
Id : 5^ -^ S"^ is not 
homotopic to a constant map. 
(ii) There is no continuous map F : B ^^ S^, B — c^^^"^^); such that 
F{x) = X Vx G 5^^, that is, S'^ is not a retract of B. 
(iii) (BROWER'S FIXED POINT THEOREM, I) Every continuous map f : 
B ^^ B, B := c^^^"^^), has a fixed point, i.e., there is at least one 
x E B such that f{x) = x. 
Proof, (i) =^ (ii) If F : 5 -^ S"^ is a continuous function with F{x) = x Vx E S'^, 
then H(t,x) 
:= F{tx), 
{t,x) € [0,1] x 5^, is a homotopy of the identity to F(0). A 
contradiction. 
(ii) => (iii) Suppose that there is a continuous F : B —^ B such that F{x) ^ x for all 
X e B. Then, and we leave this to the reader, the map G : B -^ S^ that maps x e B 
into the unique point of S'^ on the half-line from f{x) to x would be a continuous map 
from B in S"^ with G{x) = x \/x e S^, contradicting (ii). 

8.2 Some Results on the Topology of M^ 
275 
(iii) => (i) Suppose that there is a homotopy H : [0,1] x S"^ -^ S^ between the identity 
and a constant map, H(l,x) 
= x, H{0,x) 
= p £ S"^. Then the function F \ B ^^ S^ 
defined by 
yp 
if X = 0, 
would be a continuous extension of the identity on S'^ to B, hence —F{x) : B -^ B 
would have no fixed point. 
D 
8.84 %. Let U_ C W^'^^ be a bounded open set. Prove that there existsjio continuous 
retraction r : U ^>^ dU with r{x) = x on dU. [Hint: Let 0 E C/, B{0, k) D U and consider 
the continuous map / : S(0, k) -^ B(0, k) defined by 
^r{x) 
\r{x) 
if X € t/, 
X 
k— 
i{xeB{0,k)\U.] 
X 
d. Fixed points and solvability of equations in R"^+^ 
Going through the proof of Theorem 8.83, we can deduce a number of 
results concerning the solvabihty of equations of the type F{x) = 0. 
Let f : S'^ -^ R"^"^^ \ {0} be a continuous map. Since / never vanishes, 
the map f/\f\ 
continuously maps 5^ into S'^. We call degree of f with 
respect to the origin the number 
deg(/,0):=deg(^). 
8.85 Proposition. Let f : S'^ ^^ R"^+^ \ {0} be a continuous map with 
deg(/,0) ^ 0. Then every extension F : B ^W 
of f, B := cl(B^+i), 
has a zero in B^^^. 
Proof. Suppose this is not true. Then there exists a continuous extension F : B ^>^ 
E^"'"^ \ {0} of /• Hence F{x)/\F{x)\ 
is a continuous map from B into S'^. According to 
Proposition 8.80, F{x)/\F{x)\ 
= f{x)/\f{x)\ 
has degree zero, a contradiction. 
D 
Let us illustrate a few situations in which Proposition 8.85 applies. 
8.86 Proposition. Let F : c^^'^"^^) -^ R"^+^ be a continuous map such 
that F{x) never points opposite to x for all x e S'^. Then F{x) = 0 has a 
solution. 
Proof. Let / := F^sn : 5^ -> W^^. 
Since, by assumption F{x) + Ax / 0 V A > 0, 
Vx G 5^, / has no zeros and therefore 
h(t, x) := tf{x) + (1 - t)x, 
t € [0,1], X G 5'', 
never vanishes. Hence ^(t, x)/|^(t, x)| is a homotopy of f/\f\ 
: 5"^ —>• 5^ to the identity 
map Id : 5^ —)^ 5^. It follows that deg(/, 0) = deg(//|/|) = 1. We conclude, on account 
of Proposition 8.85 that F , being an extension of / , has at least one zero in B'^^^. 
D 

276 
8. Some Topics from the Topology of R^ 
8.87 Theorem (Brouwer's fixed point, II). Let F : B -^ W, B := 
cl (B"'), be a continuous map with F{dB) C B. Then F has a fixed point. 
Proof. Set (l>{x) := x — F(x), x E B, and suppose (p(x) ^ 0 Vx, otherwise we are through. 
In this case </> never points opposite for each x G dB. Indeed, if a: — F(x) + \x = 0 for 
some A > 0 and x G dB, then F{x) = (1-|-A)a:. Now A > 0 is impossible since |F(a:)| < 1, 
and, if A = 0, then F{x) = a; on dB which we have ruled out. Thus, F{x) — x = 0 has 
a solution inside B. 
D 
It is worth noticing that Brouwer's theorem still holds if we replace 
cl{B'^) with any set which is homeomorphic to the closed ball of R"^. 
Moreover, it also holds in the following form. 
8.88 Theorem (Brouwer fixed point theorem, III). Every continu-
ous map f : K -^ K from a convex compact set K into itself has a fixed 
point. 
Proof. According to Dugundji's theorem. Theorem 6.42, / has a continuous extension 
F : E^ —^ W^, whose image is contained in K, K being convex and closed. If B is a ball 
containing K^ then F{B) C B and by Brouwer's fixed point theorem, Theorem 8.87, 
F has a fixed point x G B, i.e., F{x) — x, and, since F(x) 
G K, we conclude that 
x^K. 
D 
e. Fixed points and vector fields 
Every (n -f l)-dimensional vector field in a domain A C W^^^ may be 
regarded as a map (p : A C W^'^^ -^ M"^"^^, once we fix the coordinates. If 
(p is continuous and nonzero, the degree of (f with respect to the origin is 
called the characteristic of the vector field. The Brower's degree properties 
and Proposition 8.8 then read in terms of vector fields as follows. 
8.89 Proposition. We have the following. 
(i) (BROUWER) Let (p be a nonvanishing vector field in cl{B'^~^^). Then 
(p\s^ has characteristic zero. 
(ii) The outward normal to B"^^^ at x e S'^ = dB'^~^^ is x. Therefore 
the outward normal field to 5^, x -^ x/\x\, 
x G R'^"^^ \ {0}, has 
characteristic one. 
(iii) The inward normal at x £ S^ is —x. Therefore the inward normal 
field to 5^, X -^ -x/\x\, 
X e W"-^^ \ {0}, has characteristic (-1)^+^ 
(iv) Let (f and tp be two continuous nonvanishing vector fields on S'^ that 
are never opposite on S^. Then ^p and ip have the same characteristic. 
Let us draw some consequences. 
8.90 Proposition. Each nonvanishing vector field on (p : c\{B'^^^) —^ 
MP'~^^ must contain at least an inward normal and an outward normal 
vector. 
Proof. In fact, (p\sn has characteristic zero by (i) Proposition 8.89. Since (p\s^ and the 
field of outward (inward) normals have different characteristics, we infer from Proposi-
tion 8.89 (iv) that (p\sn must contain an inward (outward) normal.

8.91 Theorem (Poincare-Brouwer). Every continuous 
nonvanishing 
vector field on an even-dimensional sphere S'^'^ must contain at least one 
normal vector. In particular, there can be no continuous nonvanishing tan-
gential vector fields to S'^. 
Proof. By (ii), (iii) Proposition 8.89, the inward and outward normal vector fields in S^"^ 
have different characteristics. Since any unitary vector field must have characteristics 
differing from one of these two fields, the result follows from (iv) Proposition 8.89. 
D 
8.92 Proposition. Let f : S'^'^ -^ 5^"^ be a continuous map. Then either 
f has a fixed point x = f{x), or there is an x e 5^^ such that f{x) = —x. 
Proof. Suppose f : S'^'^ ^ 5^^ has no fixed point. Then the vector field g : S'^'^ ^ 5^^ 
given by g{x) := .-^rc"^., x € 5^^, is continuous and of modulus one. Thus it contains 
a normal vector, i.e., f{x) — x = Xx for some x e S'^ and A G M. Since \f{x)\ = |a;| = 1 
we infer 1 = |/(a;)| = |A -f l\\x\ = |A -f 1|, i.e., either A = 0 or A = - 2 . We cannot 
have A = 0 since otherwise f(x) — x = 0 and x would be a fixed point. Thus necessarily 
A = - 2 , i.e., f(x) = -X.

Show that <t> is onto W^. [Hint: Show that for every x,y € R^ </)(x) — y never points 
opposite to X for \x\ = R, R large.] 
8.94 %. Let (/) : R"^ —)> R'^ be a continuous map such that 
hmsup ' , / ' < 1. 
Show that </) has a fixed point. 
8.95 %, Let us state another equivalent form of Brouwer's fixed point theorem. 
Theorem (Miranda). Let f : Q := {x e R"^ \ \xi\ < 1, i = 1,... ,n} -^ R^ 6e a 
continuous map such that for i = 1 , . . . , n we have 
fi{xi,. 
. . ,Xi_i,-l,Xi-|.i,. . .,Xn) > 0, 
fi{xi,. 
. . ,Xi_i, l,Xi+i, . . . ,Xn) < 0. 
Then there is at least one x £ Q such that f{x) = 0. 
Show the equivalence between the above theorem and Brouwer's fixed point theorem. 
[Hint: To prove the theorem, first assume that strict inequalities hold. In this case show 
that for a suitable choice of e i , . . . , en G R the transformation 
x^= Xi -\- €ifi(x), 
i = 1,..., n, 
maps Q into itself, and use Brouwer's theorem. In the general case, apply the above to 
f{x) — Sx and let S tend to 0. 
Conversely, if F maps Q into itself, consider the maps fi{x) 
= Fi{x) — Xi, i = 
l,...,n.] 
8.96 ^. Show that there is a nonvanishing tangent vector field on an odd-dimensional 
sphere S^^-i. [Hint: Think S^""'^ C R^^. Then the field 
X = (xi,X2,. . . ,X2n) -^ {-Xn-\-l, -Xn+2, - • • , X2n, Xi,X2, . . • ,Xn) 
defines a map from 52n-i -^^^^ itself that has no fixed point.]

8.2.2 Borsuk's theorem 
Also Borsuk's theorem, Theorem 8.76, has interesting equivalent formula-
tions and consequences. 
8.97 Theorem. The following statements hold and are are equivalent. 
(i) (BORSUK-ULAM) There is no continuous antipodal map f : S'^ -^ 
(ii) Each continuous f : S'^ -^ W^ sends at least one pair of antipodal 
points to the same point. 
(iii) (LYUSTERNIK-SCHNIRELMANN) In each family o / n + l closed subsets 
covering S'^ at least one set must contain a pair of antipodal points. 
Proof. Borsuk's theorem => (i) Ii f : S^ -^ 5^~^ is a continuous antipodal map, and 
if we regard 5^~^ as the equator of S^, S^~^ C 5^, / would give us a nonsurjective 
map f : S'^ -^ S'^, hence homotopic to a constant. On the other hand / has odd degree 
by Borsuk's theorem, a contradiction. 
(i) =>• (ii) Suppose that there is a continuous g : S^

the map a{x) = —x. Suppose that a{Fi) f) Fi = 0 for a l H = 1 , . . . , n. Then we can 
find continuous functions gi : S'^ -^ [0,1] such that g~^{0) = Fi and p~^(l) = oc(Fi). 
Next we define g : S^ —^ R^ as g(x) = (gi{x),.

consequently a^o € -Fn+i n a ( F n + i ) , a contradiction. 
(iii) =^ (i) Let f : S^ -^ 5"~^ be a continuous map. We decompose S^~^ into (n -f- 1) 
closed sets Ai,...

by projecting the boundary of an n-simplex enclosing the origin and S'^~^. Defining 
Fi := f~^{Ai), 
i = 1,... ,n + 1, according to the assumption there is an XQ and a k 
such that Xo € Ffc n a{Fk). But then f{xo) and /(—XQ) belong to Fk and so / cannot 
be antipodal.

8.98 Theorem. R"^ is not homeomorphic to W^ 
ifn^m. 
Proof. Suppose n > m and let h : W^ —^ W^ be a continuous map. Since n — 1 > m, 
from (ii) Theorem 8.97 we conclude that h^gn-i 
: S"^"^ -^ R"^ C M"""^ must send two 
antipodal points into the same point, so that h cannot be injective. 
D 
8.99 Remark. As a curiosity, (ii) of Theorem 8.97 yields that at every 
instant there are two antipodal points in the earth with the same temper-
ature and atmospheric pressure.

8.2.3 Separation theorems 
8.101 Definition. We say that a set A C W'^ 
separates R^+^ if its 
complement A^ := W^'^^ \A is not connected. 
8.102 Theorem. Let A C W^^^ be compact. Then 
(i) each connected component o/R^"^^ \A is a path-connected open set, 
(ii) A^ has exactly one unbounded connected component, 
(iii) the boundary of each connected component of A^ is contained in A, 
(iv) if A separates R^+^, but no proper subset does so, then the boundary 
of each connected component of A^ is exactly A. 
Proof, (i) follows e.g., from Corollary 6.68, since connected components of A^ are open 
sets. 
(ii) Let B be a closed ball such that B D A. Then B^ is open, connected and B C A^. 
Thus B is contained in a unique connected component of A^. 
(iii) Let U be any connected component of A^ and x G dU. We claim that x does not 
belong to any connected component of A^, consequently x ^ A^. In fact, x ^ U, and, 
if X was in some component V, there would exist B(x, e) C V. B{x, e) would then also 
intersect U, thus U r\V ^ ^•. a contradiction. 
(iv) Let U be any connected component of A^. Since A separates E^"^^, there is another 
connected component V of A^ and, because V C M""''^ \ U, necessarily R^+^ \ C/ ^ 0. 
Consequently R^+i \ dU splits as 
R ^ + ^ \ a t / = t / U ( E ^ + ^ \ t 7 ) 
which are disjoint and nonempty, so dU separates R^"*"^. Since by (iii) dU C A and is 
closed, it follows from the hypotheses on A that dU = A. 
D

8.103 Theorem (Borsuk's separation theorem). Let A C W^~^^ be 
compact Then A separates W^~^^ if and only if there exists a continuous 
map f : A -^ S'^ that is not homotopic to a constant. 
Proof. Define the map /?p|^ as 
\x-p\ 
Assume that A separates M^"'"^. Then R^"'"^ \ A has at least one bounded component 
U. Choosing any p £ U v/e shall show that ^p|^ cannot be extended to a continuous 
function on the closed set AUU, consequently on R'^"''^; hence ^p|A is not homotopic to a 
constant map by Proposition 8.8. In fact, if F : AUU -^ S^ were a continuous extension 
of Pp\A we choose R> 0 such that B(p, R) D AuU 
and define g : B{p, R) -^ dB{p, R) 
X — p 
\P + R] 
~ 
iixeB{p,R)\U, 
\p-\-RF{x) 
iixeU. 
Then g would be continuous in B{p,R) 
and g = Id on dB(p,R): 
this contradicts 
Brouwer's theorem. 
Conversely, suppose that A does not separate A^. Then A^ has exactly one con-
nected component, which is necessarily unbounded. By Theorem 8.79, / extends to 
F : R'^+i -^ S^. Therefore F and consequently / = F|^ are homotopic to a constant 
map. 
D 
In particular, Borsuk's separation theorem tells us that the separation 
property is invariant by homeomorphisms. 
8.104 Corollary. Let A be a compact set in W^ and let h : A-^W^ 
be a 
homeomorphism onto its image. Then A separates W^ if and only if h{A) 
separates W^. 
As a consequence we have the following. 
8.105 Theorem (Jordan's separation theorem). A homeomorphic 
image of S^ in W^~^^ separates R'^'^^^ and no proper closed subset of S^ 
does so. In particular h{S'^) is the complete boundary of each connected 
component o/R^+i \ /i(5^). 
It is instead much more difficult to prove the following general Jordan's 
theorem. 
8.106 Theorem (Jordan). Let h : S^ —^ R'^^^ be a homeomorphism 
between S'^ and its image. Then R"^+^ \h{S'^) 
has exactly two connected 
components, each having h{S'^) as its boundary. 
Jordan's theorem in the case n = 1 is also known as the Jordan curve 
theorem. We also have 

8.3 Exercises 
281 
8.107 Theorem (Jordan-Borsuk). Let K be a compact subset ofR'^'^^ 
such that W^\K 
has k connected components, and let h be a homeomor-
phism of K into its image on E^"^^. Then R^+^ \ h{K) has k connected 
components. 
Particularly relevant is the following theorem that follows from Bor-
suk's separation theorem, Theorem 8.103. 
8.108 Theorem (Brouwer's invariance doraiain theorem). Let U 
be an open set ofW^~^^ and let h : U C W^~^^ -^ ]R'^+^ be a homeomorphism 
between U and its image. Then h{U) is an open set in M^"^^. 
Proof. Let y € h(U). We shall show that there is an open set W C R^"*"^ such that 
y eW C h(U). Set x = /i~^(2/), and B := B(x, e) so that 'B CU. Then 
(i) E^+i \ h(B) is connected by Corollary 8.104 since B is homeomorphic to B(0,1) 
and B(0,1) does not separate E'^''"^, 
(ii) h{B,dB) 
= h{B) \ h{dB) is connected since it is homeomorphic to B{x, e). 
By writing 
R''-^^ \ h{dB) = {W" \ h(B)\ U h(B \ dB) 
we see that MP' \ h{dB) is the union of two nonempty, disjoint connected sets, that are 
necessarily the connected components of M.'^ \ h{dB); since h{dB) is compact, they are 
also open in R^+^ Thus we can take W := h(B \ dB). 
D 
A trivial consequence of the domain invariance theorem is that if A is 
any subset of R"^+^ and h : A —^ R'^+^ is a homeomorphism between A 
and its image h{A), then h maps the interior of A onto the interior of h{A) 
and the boundary of A onto the boundary of h{A). 
Using Theorem 8.108 we can also prove 
8.109 Theorem. W^ and W^ are not homeomorphic 
ifn^m. 
Proof. Suppose m > n. If M^ were homeomorphic to M^, then the image of W^ into 
R ^ under such homeomorphism would be open in R"^. However, the image is not open 
under the map ( x i , . . . ,Xn) —> {xi,... 
,Xn,0,... 
,0).

9. Spaces of Continuous 
Functions, Banach Spaces and 
Abstract Equations 
The combination of the structure of a vector space with the structure of 
a metric space naturally produces the structure of a normed space and a 
Banach space^ i.e., of a complete linear normed space. The abstract defi-
nition of a linear normed space first appears around 1920 in the works of 
Stefan Banach (1892-1945), Hans Hahn (1879-1934) and Norbert Wiener 
(1894-1964). In fact, it is in these years that the Polish school around Ba-
nach discovered the principles and laid the foundation of what we now call 
linear functional analysis. Here we shall restrain ourselves to introducing 
some definitions and illustrating some basic facts in Sections 9.1 and 9.4. 
Important examples of Banach spaces are provided by spaces of contin-
uous functions that play a relevant role in several problems. In Section 9.3 
we shall discuss the completeness of these spaces, some compactness crite-
ria for subsets of them, in particular the Ascoli-Arzeld theorem, and finally 
the density of subspaces of smoother functions in the class of continuous 
functions, as the Stone-Weierstrass 
theorem. 
Finally, Section 9.5 is dedicated to establishing some principles that en-
sure the existence of solutions of functional equations in a general context. 
We shall discuss the fixed point theorems of Banach and of Caccioppoli-
Schauder, the Leray-Schauder principle and the method of super- and sub-
solutions. Later, in Chapter 11 we shall discuss some applications of these 
principles. 
9.1 Linear Normed Spaces

// II II is a norm on X, we say that (X, || ||) is a linear normed space or 
simply that X is a normed space with norm \\ \\. 
Let X be a linear space. A norm 
on X, defined by 
on X induces a natural distance 
d{x,y) := \\x-y\\ 
\/x,y e X, 
which is invariant by translations, i.e., d{x-\-z^y-\-z) = d{x,y) Vo;,y^z ^ X, 
Therefore, topological notions such as open sets, closed sets, compact sets, 
convergence of sequences, etc., and metric notions, such as completeness 
and Cauchy sequences, see Chapter 5, are well defined in a linear normed 
space. For instance, if X is a normed space with norm || ||, we say that 
{xn} C X converges to x ^ X li \\xn — x\\ —> 0 as n ^ oo. Notice also that 
the norm 11 11 : X ^^ R is a continuous function and actually a Lipschitz-
continuous function, 
x||-|Ml|<||x-y||, 
see Example 5.25. 
9.2 Definition. A real (complex) normed space (X, || ||) that is complete 
with respect to the distance d{x^y) := \\x — y\\ is called a real (complex) 
Banach space. 
9.3 Remark. By Hausdorff's theorem, see Chapter 5, every normed Unear 
space X can be completed into a metric space, that is, X is homeomorphic 
to a dense subset of a complete metric space. Indeed, the completed metric 
space and the homeomorphism inherit the linear structure, as one easily

sees. Thus every normed space X is isomorphic to a dense subset of a 
Banach space. 
9.4 Example. With the notation above: 
(i) E with the Euclidean norm |a;| is a Banach space. In fact, \x\ is a norm on R, and 
Cauchy sequences converge in norm, compare Theorem 2.35 of [GM2]. 
(ii) E*^, n > 1, is a normed space with the EucUdean norm 
vV2 
= ( E l ^ ' l ' ) 
' 
x = 
{x\x\...,xn, 
see Example 3.2. It is also a Banach space, see Section 5.3. 
(iii) Similarly, C^ is a Banach space with the norm \\z\\ := (EILi ki^)^^^^ ^ = 
9.5 % Convex sets. In a linear space, we may consider convex subsets and convex 
functions. 
Definition. E C X is convex if Ax-h (1 — X)y G E for all x,y ^ E and for all A G [0,1]. 
f : X -^R is called convex if f{Xx + (1 - X)y) < Xf{x) + (1 - X)f{y) for all x,y e X 
and all A G [0,1]. 
Show that the balls B{xo,r) 
:= {x £ X \ \\x — xo\\ < r} of a normed space X are 
convex. 
a. Norms induced by inner and Hermitian products 
Let X be a real (complex) linear space with an inner (Hermitian) product 
{x\y). Then ||x|| := y^{x\x) is a norm on X, see Propositions 3.7 and 3.16. 
But in general, norms on linear vector spaces are not induced by inner or 
Hermitian products. 
9.6 Proposition. Let \\ \\ be a norm on a real (respectively, complex) 
normed linear space X. A necessary and sufficient condition for the exis-
tence of an inner (Hermitian) product ( | ) such that ||x|| = (x|x) Vx G X 
is that the parallelogram law holds, 
\\x + y\? + \\x~ y||' = 2(||a;||2 + \\y\\^) 
Vx,2/ S X. 
9.7 1[. Show Proposition 9.6. [Hint: First show that if ||x||^ = {x\x), then the parallel-

b. Equivalent norms 
9.9 Definition. Two norms || ||i and \\ ||2 on a linear vector space X are 
said to be equivalent if there exist two constants 0 < m < M such that 
m||x||i < ||x||2 <M||x||i 
V X G X 
(9.1) 
If II 111 and II II2 are equivalent, then trivially the normed spaces (X, || ||i) 
and (X, II 112) have the same convergent sequences (to the same limits) 
and the same Cauchy sequences. Therefore {X, || ||i) Z5 a Banach space if 
and only if (X, || II2) i5 a Banach space. Since the induced distances are 
translation invariant, we have the following. 
9.10 Proposition. Let \\ ||i and \\ II2 be two norms on a linear vector 
space X. The following statements are equivalent 
(i) II 111 and || II2 are equivalent norms, 
(ii) the relative induced distances are topologically equivalent, 
(iii) for any {xn} C X, \\xn\\i —> 0 if and only if \\xn\\2 -^ 0. 
Proof. Obviously (i) =^ (ii) => (iii). Let us prove that (iii) =^ (i). (iii) implies that 
the identity map i : (X, || ||i) —> {X, || II2) is continuous at 0. Therefore there exists 
6 > 0 such that ||2:||2 < 1 if ||2;||i < (5. For x G M, x / 0, if z := {S/\\x\\i))x 
we have 
||2;||i = S hence ||2;||2 < 1, i.e., ||a:||2 < ^ ||a:||i- Exchanging the role of || ||i and || II2 
and repeating the argument, we also get the inequality 
Iklli < ^IW|2 Vx e X for 
some (5i > 0, hence (i) is proved. 
D 
9.11 ^. Let X and Y be two Banach spaces. Show that their Cartesian product, called 
the direct sum, is a Banach space with the norm ||(a:,2/)||i,xxy •— Ikllx + Ibllr- Show 
that 
||(x,2/)||p,xxy := ^IWI^ + IMI^, P > 1,

WVWY), 
are equivalent norms. 
c. Series in normed spaces 
In a linear vector space X, finite sums of elements of X are elements of X. 
Therefore, given a sequence {xn} in X, we can consider the series Xl^o ^^' 
i.e., the sequence of partial sums < X]fc=o ^^ r • •^^' moreover, X is a normed 
space, we can inquire about the convergence of series in X. 
9.12 Definition. Let X be a normed vector space with norm \\ \\. A series 
]^^o^^^ Xn ^ X, is said to be convergent in X if the sequence of its 
partial sums, Sn := XIfc=o^^ converges in X, i.e., there exists s E X such 
that \\sn — s\\ -^ 0. In this case we write 
fc=0 
instead 0/ ||5n — s|| ^^ 0 and s is said to be the sum of the series.

9.13 Remark. Writing s = Yl^=o^k might make one forget that the 
sum of the series s is a hmit. In dubious cases, for instance if more than 
one convergence is involved, it is worth specifying in which normed space 
(X, II ||x), equivalently with respect to which norm || ||x, the hmit has 
been computed by writing 
s = 2_] ^k

9.14 Definition. Let X he a normed space with norm \\ \\. We say that 
the series YL^^Xn, 
{xn} C X, is absolutely convergent if the series of 
the norms X]n=o 11^^ 11 converges in M. 
We have seen, compare Proposition 2.39 of [GM2], that every absolutely 
convergent series in R is convergent. In general, we have the following. 
9.15 Proposition. Let X be a normed space with norm \\ \\. Then all the 
absolutely convergent series of elements of X converge in X if and only if 
X is a Banach space. Moreover, if Yll^=o ^n is convergent, then 
||5^Xfe||<^||Xfc||. 
k=p 
k=p 
Proof. Let A" be a Banach space, and let J ^ ^ Q ^k be absolutely convergent. The se-
quence of partial sums of X^fcio ll^fcll ^^ ^ Cauchy sequence in E, hence X]fc=p Ikfcll ~^ 0 
ss p,q -^ OO. From the triangle inequality we infer that 
k=p 
k=p 
hence 
Efc=p^k\\ —* 0 as p,q —^ oo, i.e., the sequence of partial sums of S^^o ^k is a 
Cauchy sequence in X. Consequently, it converges in norm in X, since X is a Banach 
space. 
Conversely, let {xk} C X be a Cauchy sequence. By induction select ni such that 
\\xn — XniW < 1 if n > ni, then 712 > ni such that \\xn — a;n2 II < 1/2 if n > 712 and so 
on. Then {xn^} is a subsequence of {xk} such that 
IK,+i-x„J|<2-'= 
Vfc, 
and consequently the series ^'^=i(xnk+i 
— ^n^) is absolutely convergent, hence con-
vergent to a point y £ X by assumption, i.e.,

Since this simply amounts to \\xnp — x\\ -^ 0, x := y -\- Xm, {xuk} 
converges to x, 
and, as {xn} is a Cauchy sequence, we conclude that in fact the entire sequence {xn} 
converges to x. Finally, the estimate follows from the triangle inequality

d. Finite-dimensional normed linear spaces 
In a finite-dimensional vector space, there is only one topology induced by 
a norm: the Euclidean topology. In fact, if K = R or K = C, we have the 
following. 
9.18 Theorem. In K^ any two norms are equivalent. 
Proof. It suffices to prove that any norm p on K^ is equivalent to the Euclidean norm 
I |. Let (ei, 62,..., en) be the standard basis of K^. If x = (x^, x'^,..., 
x^) and y = 
(2/1, 2/^,..., y"^), we have 
n

Z=l 
i=l

o \ l / 2 
hence p : K'^ -> E+ is continuous. Since the unit ball B := {x e K'^ \ \x\ = 1} of K^ 
is compact, we infer that p attains a maximum value M and a minimum value m on 
B. Since the minimum value is attained, we infer that m > 0, otherwise p would be 
zero at some point of B. Therefore 0 < m < p{x) < M on B, and, on account of the 
1-homogeneity of the norm, 
m\x\ < p{x) < M \x\ 
Wx € K'^, 
i.e., II II is equivalent to the Euclidean norm. 
• 
9.19 Corollary. Every finite-dimensional normed space X is a Banach 
space. In particular, any finite-dimensional subspace of X is closed and 
K C X is compact is and only if K is closed and hounded. 

9.1 Linear Normed Spaces 
291 
Proof. Let p be a norm on X and let E : K^ ^^ X be a coordinate map on X. Since 8 
is linear and nonsingular, p o £^ is a norm on K^ and E is trivially an isometry between 
the two normed spaces (K'^,poE) 
and (X,p). Since p o 5 is equivalent to the Euclidean 
norm, (K^jpo 
E) is a Banach space and therefore {X,p) is a Banach space, too. The 
second claim is obvious. 
D 
9.20 %, Let A" be a normed space of dimension n. Then any system of coordinates 
E : X ^^ K^ is a linear continuous map between K^ with the Euclidean metric and the 
normed space X. 
A key ingredient in the proof of Theorem 9.18 is the fact that the 
closed unit ball in W^ is compact. This property is characteristic of finite-
dimensional spaces. 
9.21 Theorem (Riesz). The closed unit ball of a normed linear space X 
is compact if and only if X is finite dimensional. 
For the proof we need the following lemma, due to Prigyes Riesz (1880-
1956), which in this context plays the role of the orthogonal projection 
theorem in spaces with inner or Hermitian products, see Theorem 3.27 
and Chapter 10. 
9.22 Lemma. Let Y be a closed linear subspace of a normed space 
(X, II II). Then there exists x G X such that \\x\\ = 1 and ||x — x|| > 1/2 
\f 
xeY. 
Proof. Take XQ € X\Y 
and define d := inf{||2/ —xo|| | y € Y}. We have d > 0, otherwise 
we could find {yn} C Y with yn -^ XQ and XQ ^Y 
since Y is closed. Take yo ^Y 
with

Proof of Theorem 9.21. Let B := {x e X \\\x\\ < 1}. If X has dimension n, and E : 
K^ —> X is a system of coordinates, then E is an isomorphism, hence a homeomorphism. 
Since B is bounded and closed, E~^{B) is also bounded and closed, hence compact in 
K", see Corollary 9.19. Therefore B = E{E-^{B)) 
is compact in X. 
We now prove that B is not compact if X has infinite dimension. Take x\ with 
||xi|| = 1. By Lemma 9.22, we find X2 with ||x2|| = 1 at distance at least 1/2 from the 
subspace Span{a;i}, in particular \\x\ — X2II > | . Again by Lemma 9.22, we find X3 
with ||x3|| = 1 at distance at least 1/2 from Span {xi, 0:2}, in particular ||a:3 — x\\\ > | 
and 11^3 — X211 > | . Iterating this procedure we construct a sequence {xn} of points in 
the unit sphere such that ||iCi — Xj|| > | ^i^j^i 
^ 3- Therefore {xn} has no convergent 
subsequence, hence the unit sphere is not compact. 
D 
9.23 Remark. We emphasize that, in any infinite-dimensional normed 
space we have constructed a sequence of unit vectors, a subsequence of 
which is never Cauchy.

9. Spaces of Continuous Functions, Banach Spaces and Abstract Equations 
9.1.2 A few examples 
In Sections 9.2 and 9.4 we shall discuss respectively, the relevant Banach 
spaces of linear continuous operators and of bounded continuous functions. 
Here we begin with a few examples. 
a. The space ^p, 1 < p < oc 
Let (y, II \\Y) be a normed space and p G M, p > 1. For a sequence ^ = 
{^i} CY we define 
Then the space of sequences 
is a linear space with norm ||^||£p(y). Moreover, we have the following. 
9.24 Proposition, ^p(y) is a Banach space if Y is a Banach space. 
Proof. Let {^fe}? ^k •= {$1 }, be a Cauchy sequence in ipiV). 
Since for any i 
l l d - C l l y < I I C n - U l l M y ) . 
(9.2) 
the sequence {Q ^}k is a Cauchy sequence in Y, hence it has a limit fi € K, 
We then set ^ := {^i} and prove that {^k} converges to ^ in ipiV)- Fix e > 0, then for 
all n,m > no(e) we have 
Win -im\\ep(Y) 
< e 
hence, for all r G N

and, since x —^ ||2; — a:||y is continuous in Y, as m —^ oo, 
for n > no{e) and all r. Letting r —^ oo, we find ||^n — Cll£p(y) ^ ^ ^^^ '^ ^ '^o, i-e., 
^n ^^ ? in ^p(l^). Finally, the triangle inequality shows that ^ 6 ^p(^)-

P = li/llLp(K6[,y):= / 
\\m\fydt, 
p > 1, 
Ja 
defines a norm on the space of continuous functions with values in Y. 
In fact, t -^ ||/(^)||y is a continuous real-valued map, hence Riemann 
integrable, thus ||/||p is well defined. Clearly ||/||p = 0 if and only if 
f{t) =0 \/t and 11/lip is positively homogeneous of degree 1. It remains to 
prove the triangle inequality for / ^ jj/lIP? called the Minkowski inequality, 
||/ + 5||p<||/||p + ||5llp 
V/,5eC0([a,6],y). 
The claim is trivial if one of the two functions is zero. Otherwise, we use 
the convexity of 0 : F —» E where 0(j/) := ||j/||y, i.e., 
<t){Xx + (1 - X)y) < X<P{x) + (1 - A)0(2/),

with X = m/\\f\\p,

integrate to get

that is Minkowski's inequality. 
It turns out that C^([a,6],R) normed with \\ \\p is not complete, see 
Example 9.25. Its completion is denoted by L^(]a, 6[). Its characterization 
is one of the outcomes of the Lebesgue theory of integration.

also denoted by ||/||OO,A or even by ||/||oo when no confusion can arise. The 
topology induced on B{A^ Y) by the uniform norm is called the topology 
of uniform convergence, see Example 5.19. In particular, we say that a 
sequence {fn} C B{A, Y) converges uniformly in Ato f e B{A, Y) and we 
write 
/n(^) -^ f{x) 
uniformly in A,

9.26 Proposition. If Y is a Banach space, then B{A,Y)

Proof. Let {fn} C 1S{A, Y) be a Cauchy sequence with respect to || ||oo. For any e > 0

9.2 Spaces of Bounded and 
Continuous Functions 
In this section we discuss some basic properties of the space of continuous 
and bounded functions from a metric space into a Banach space. 
9.2.1 Uniform convergence 
a. Uniform convergence 
Let X be a metric space and let F be a normed space with norm || ||y. 
Then, as we have seen in Proposition 9.26, the space B{X, Y) of bounded 

296 
9. Spaces of Continuous Functions, Banach Spaces and Abstract Equations 
functions from X into F is a normed space with uniform norm, and 
B{X^ Y) is a Banach space provided y is a Banach space. 
We denote by Cb{X, Y) the subspace of B{X, Y) of bounded and con-
tinuous functions from X into F, 
Cb{X,Y) 
:=C''{X,Y)nB{X,Y). 
Observe that, by the Weierstrass theorem Cb{X, Y) = C{X, Y) if X is 
compact, and that, trivially, Cb{X^Y) is a normed space with uniform 
norm. 
9.30 Proposition. Cb{X,Y) 
is a closed subspace of 
B{X^Y). 
Proof. Let {/n} C Cb{X, Y) be such that fn^f 
uniformly. For any e > 0, we choose 
no = no(e) such that ||/ — /no I loo,x < ^- It follows that 
ll/lloc,X < 11/ 
/no ||oo,X 
+ | | / n o l | o o , X < 4 - 0 0 , 
i.e., / 6 B{X,Y). 
Moreover, since /no is continuous, for a fixed XQ ^ X there exists 
6 > 0 such that \\fno(x) — fno{xo)\\Y 
< € whenever x G X and dx{x,xo) 
< S. Thus, 
for d(x, xo) < S, we deduce that

Immediate consequences are the following corollaries. 
9.31 Corollary. The uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions 
is continuous. 
9.32 Corollary. Let X be a metric space and let Y be a Banach space. 
Then Cb{X^Y) with uniform norm is a Banach space.

Figure 9.3. Consider a wave shaped function, e.g., f{x) = 1/(1 +x^), and its translates 
fn{x) := 1/(1 -\-(x-\- n)2). Then ||/n||oo = 1, while fn(x) -^ 0 for all 
xeR. 
b. Pointwise and uniform convergence 
Let ^ be a set and let y be a normed space normed by | |y. We say that 
{/n}, /n • ^ —^ y , converges pointwise to f : A ^^Y in A ii 
\fn{x)^f{x)\Y^O 
V X G A , 
while we say that {fn} converges uniformly to / in A if 
| | / n - / | | o o , A ^ O . 
Since for all x G ^ ll/n(a:) — /(^)||y < ll/n — /||cx),x, uniform convergence 
trivially implies pointwise convergence while the converse is generally false. 
For instance, a sequence of continuous functions may converge pointwise 
to a discontinuous function, and in this case, the convergence cannot be 
uniform, as shown by the sequence fn{x) := x^, x e [0,1[, that converges 
to the function / which vanishes for all x G [0,1[, while /(I) = 1. Of 
course, a sequence of continuous functions may also converge pointwise 
and not uniformly to a continuous function, compare Figure 9.3. 
More explicitly, /n ^ / pointwise in A if 
Vx G A,Ve > 0 3 n = n(x, e) such that \fn{x) - /(^)|y < e for all n>n, 
while, fn—^f 
uniformly in A if 
V € > 0 3 n = 6 such that \fn{x) — /(^)|y < ^ for all n > n and all x e A. 
Therefore, we have pointwise convergence or uniform convergence accord-
ing to whether the index n depends on or is independent of the point 
X.

f{x) = \^ fn{x) 
uniformly in A 
n=l 
if the partial sums converge uniformly. Simply writing Yl^=i fn{x) = /(^) 
is, in fact, ambiguous. 
Summarizing, we introduced four different types of convergence for 
series of functions from a set A into a normed space Y. More precisely, if 
{/n} C B{A, Y) and / G B{A, F), we say that 
(i) S ^ o /n(^) converges pointwise to / if for all a: G ^ X^^o fni^) — 
/(^) in r , i.e., for all x G ^, || J^^^Q fn{x) - /(x)||y ^ 0 as ;? -> oo, 
(ii) X]^o/^(^) converges absolutely in Y for all x ^ A i.e., for any 
fixed X e A, the series of nonnegative real numbers Yl'^=o ll/n(^)||r 
converges, 
(iii) Er=o fn{x) converges uniformly in A to f if Yl7=o fn = f^^ B{A, F), 
i-e., \\YZ=0 
fn - f\\B{A,Y) 
- ^ 0 a s p - > 00, 
(^^) J2^=o fn{x) converges absolutely in B{A^ Y) if the series of nonnega-
tive real numbers Y!^=Q \\fn\\B{A,Y) converges. 
Clearly (iv) implies (ii), and (iii) implies (i). Moreover, (iv) implies (iii) 
and (ii) implies (i) if F is a Banach space; the other implications are false, 
see Example 9.35 below. 
9.35 Example. Consider functions / : R+ —> E. Choosing fn{x) 
:= ( - l ) ^ / n , we 
see that X ] ^ i fn{x) converges pointwise and uniformly, but not absolutely in M or in 
H(R,R). 
Let f{x) := sinx/x, a; > 0, and, for any n G N, 
ii n < X < n-\- 1, 
otherwise. 
Since ci/n < ||/n||oo < C2/n, J2n f^ ^^^^ ^^* converge absolutely in JS(M+,R). But 
/(^) = Yl'^=o fn(,x) converges pointwise Wx G R+ and also absolutely in R for all

therefore ^^fn 
converges uniformly, that is in iB(]R+,M). 
Here the convergence is uniform in iS(E+,M) but not absolute in iB(M-|.,E), because 
the functions fn take their maxima at different points and the maximum of the sum is 
much smaller than the sum of the maxima.

9.2.2 A compactness theorem 
At the end of the nineteenth century, especially in the works of Vito 
Volterra (1860-1940), Giulio AscoU (1843-1896), Cesare Arzela (1847-
1912) there appears the idea of considering functions J-" whose values de-
pend on the values of a function, the so-called funzioni di linee, functions 
of lines; one of the main motivations came from the calculus of variations. 
This eventually led to the notion of abstract spaces of Maurice Prechet 
(1878-1973). In this context, a particularly relevant result is the compact-
ness criterion now known as the Ascoli-Arzela theorem. 
a. Equicontinuous functions 
L§t X be a metric space and Y a normed space. 

9.2 Spaces of Bounded and Continuous Functions 
301 
9.45 Definition. We say that a subset T of B{X^Y) is equibounded, or 
uniformly bounded, by some constant M > 0 if we have ||/(x)||y < M 
Vx ex,yf e T. 
We say that the family of functions T is equicontinuous if for all e> 0 
there is S > 0 such that 
\\f{x) - f{y)\\Y <€ 
Wx.yeX 
with dx{x,y) < S, and V/ G T. 
9.46 Definition (Holder-continuous functions). Let X^Y be metric 
spaces. We say that a function f : X -^ Y is Holder-continuous with 
exponent a, 0 < a <1, if there is a constant M such that 
dY{fix),f{y))<Mdx{x,yr, 
and we denote by C^'^(X, F) the space of these functions. 
Clearly the space C^'^{X,Y) 
is the space Lip(X, F) of Lipschitz-
continuous functions from X into Y. 
On C°'^(X, Y) n B(X, F), 0 < a < 1, we introduce the norm 
WfWco,^ = sup \\f{x)\\y + 
sup 
''^^,;]"f,^,^^''^, 
(9.7) 
xeX 
x,yeX,Xy^y 
I F ~ i / | l x 
and it is easy to show the following. 
9.47 Proposition. C^^'^{X,Y)nB{X,Y) 
endowed with the norm (9.7) is 
a Banach space ifY is a Banach space. 
Bounded subsets with respect to the norm (9.7), of (7^'"(X, F) fl 
B{X, F) provide examples of equicontinuous families. 
See the exercises at the end of this chapter for more on Holder-
continuous functions. 
b. The Ascoli—Arzela theorem 
9.48 Theorem (Ascoli—Arzela). Every sequence of functions {/„} in 
C^{[a,b]) which is equibounded and equicontinuous has a subsequence that 
is uniformly convergent. 
More generally, we have the following. 
9.49 Theorem. Let X be a compact metric space. A subset T ofC^{X, R) 
is relatively compact if and only if T is equibounded and equicontinuous. 
Proof. We recall that a subset of a metric space is relatively compact or precompact if 
and only if it is totally bounded, see Theorem 6.8. 
If .F is relatively compact, then T is totally bounded and, in particular, equibounded 
in C^{X,R). 
For any e > 0, let / i , . . . , / n , G ^ be an e-net for T, i.e., \/ f e T 
11/ — /ill < € for some fi. Since the /j's are uniformly continuous, there is a Se such that 
dx{x,y) 
< Se implies \fi{x) - fi(y)\ < e, 
2 = 1, 2 , . . . ,ne.

Conversely, suppose J^ is equibounded and equicontinuous. Again by Theorem 6.8, 
it suffices to show that J^ is totally bounded. Let e > 0. Prom the compactness of X and 
the equicontinuity of .F, we infer that there exists a finite family of open balls B(xi, r^)

with TT varying among the bijective maps TT : { 1 , . . . ,n} —^ { 1 , . . . ,n}. Therefore, it

9.3 Approximation Theorems

9.51 f. Theorem 9.49 can be formulated in slightly more general forms that are proved 
to hold with the same proof of Theorem 9.49. 
Theorem. Let X be a compact metric space, and let Y be a Banach space. A subset 
T C C(X, y ) is relatively compact if and only if T is equicontinuous 
and, for every X, 
the set Tx of all values f{x) 
of f E J^ is relatively compact in Y. 
Theorem. Let X and Y be metric spaces. Suppose X is compact. A sequence {fn} C 
C{X,Y) 
converges uniformly 
if and only if {fn} 
is equicontinuous 
and there exists a 
compact set K C Y such that {fn{x)} 
is contained in a 6-neighborhood 
of K for n 
sufficiently 
large. 
9.52 ^. Show the following. 
Proposition. Let X^Y 
be two metric spaces and let Q C X be compact. Then the 
subsets ofC^^'^iQ^Y) 
that are bounded in the \\ ||^o,a norm are relatively compact in 
C^{n,Y). 
9.3 Approximation Theorems 
In this section we deal with the following questions: Can we approximate a 
continuous function uniformly, and with given precision, by a polynomial? 
Under which conditions are classes of smooth functions dense with respect 
to the uniform convergence in the class of continuous functions? 
9.3.1 Weierstrass and Bernstein theorems 
a. Weierstrass's approximation theorem 
In 1885 Karl Weierstrass (1815-1897) proved the following. 
9.53 Theorem (Weierstrass, I). Every continuous function in a closed 
bounded interval [a, b] is the uniform limit of a sequence of polynomials. 
In particular, for every n there exists a polynomial Qn(^) (of degree 
d = d{n) sufficiently large) such that |/(x) — Qn{x)\ < 2~'^ V a: G [a, 6]. If 
we set 
Pi{x) := Qi{x), 
Pn{x) := Qn{x) - Qn-i{x), 
n > 1, 
we therefore conclude that every continuous function f{x) can be written 
in a closed and bounded interval as the (infinite) sum of polynomials., 
oo 
f{x) = y ^ Pn{x) 
uniformly in [a, b]. 
n=0

9. Spgices of Continuous Functions, Banach Spaces and Abstract Equations 
We recall that, in general, a continuous function is not the sum of a power 
series, since the sum of a power series is at least a function of class C"^, 
compare [GM2]. 
Many proofs of Weierstrass's theorem are nowadays available; in this 
section we shall illustrate some of them. This will allow us to discuss a 
number of facts that are individually relevant. 
A first proof of Theorem 9.53. We first observe, following Henri Lebesgue (1875-1941), 
that in order to approximate uniformly in [a, h] any continuous function, it suffices to 
approximate the function |a;|, x G [—1,1]-
In fact, any continuous function in [a, h] can be approximated, uniformly in [a, 6], by 
continuous and piecewise linear functions. Thus it suffices to approximate continuous 
and piecewise linear functions. Let f{x) 
be one of such functions. Then there exist 
points XQ = a < XI < X2 < • • • < Xr < Xr-\-i = b such that f^x) takes a constant value 
dk in each interval ]xk,Xk-\-i[' Then, in [a,b] we have 
r 
f{x) = f{a)-\-^{dk 
-dk-i)(pxk(x), 
d-i = 0 , 
fc=o 
where 
ipc{x) := max(a: - c,0) = -{{x — c) -\-\x — c\). 
If we are able to approximate \x — Xk\-> x e [a,6], uniformly by polynomials {Qk,n}^ 
then the polynomials 
^ 
1 
Pn{x) := /(a) + ^{dk - dk-i)-({x 
- Xk) + 
Qk,n{^)) 
k=0 
approximate f(x) uniformly in [a,b]. By a linear change of variable, it then suffices to 
approximate |a;| uniformly in [—1,1]. 
This can be done in several ways. For instance, noticing that if x G [—1,1], then 
1 — |a;| solves the equation in z 
one considers the discrete process 
izn^i{x) 
= ^[zUx) 
+ {l-x^)] 
n > 0 , 
[zo{x) = 1. 
It is then easily seen that the polynomials Zn{x) satisfy 
(i) 
Znix)>Oin[-hll 
(ii) Zn{x) 
> 
Zn-\-l{x), 
(iii) Znix) converges pointwise to 1 — \x\ if x G [—1,1]. 
Since 1 — \x\ is continuous, Dini's theorem. Theorem 9.36, yields that the polynomials 
Zn{x) converge uniformly to 1 — |a:| in [—1,1]. 
Alternatively one shows, using the binomial series, that 
VT^^=f^CnX'', 
Cn = ( ^ ^ ^ ) ( - i r . 
in ] — 1,1[. Then one proves that the series converges absolutely in C^([—1,1]), hence 
uniformly in [—1,1]. In fact, we observe that Cn := (^/^)(—1)" is negative for n > 1 
hence,

b. Bernstein's polynomials 
Another proof of Theorem 9.53, grounded in probabHstic ideas, see Exer-
cise 9.57, and giving expHcit formulas for the approximating polynomials, 
is due to Sergei Bernstein (1880-1968). 
It is enough to consider functions defined in [0,1] instead of in a generic 
interval [a, 6]. 
9.55 Definition. Let f e C^([0,1]). Bernstein polynomials of f are 
Bn{x) := JZf{^ 0^'(1 - ^)"-'. 
^ > 0. 

306 
9. Spaces of Continuous Functions, Banach Spaces and Abstract Equations 
9.56 Theorem (Bernstein). Bernstein's polynomials off converge uni-
formly in [0,1] to f. 
Proof. We split the proof into three steps. 
Step 1. The following identities hold 
5:n.^i-xr-'= = i. 
fc=0 
(9.8) 
(9.9) 
The first is trivial: it follows from the binomial formula (a + 6)" = ^Q {^)a^h'^-^ 
by 
choosing a = x and 6 = \ — x. The second needs some computation. Fix n > 1. Starting 
from the identities 
fc=0 '^ 
±kQ)y'-yD(tQ)y')=nyiy+ir-\ 
'£k^ny'' 
= ny{ny + l){y + i r - \ 
we replace y by x/(l — x) and multiply each of the equalities by (1 — x)". It follows that 
fc=0 '^ 
f2kr)x^{i-xr-^ = nx, 
k=0

n 
S ^^ Q)^^(^ - ^T~^ = ^^(^^ + 1-3:). 
fc=0 
Multiplying each of the previous identities respectively, by n'^x^, —2nx and —1, and 
summing, we infer (9.9). 
Step 2. As x{l-x) 
< \ , (9.9) yields 
«=0 
Fix S > 0 and x G [0,1], and denote by An (a:) the set of fc in { 0 , 1 , . . . , n} such that 
a: > (5; 
n 
(9.10) then yields 
?:,{:y»-'>-<-^' 
(9.11) 
keAnix) 
that is, for n large, the terms that mostly contribute to the sum in (9.8) are the ones 
with index k such that 
\k 
x\ 
n 
<S. 

9.3 Approximation Theorems 
307 
Step 3. Set M := sup^^jg,!] 1/(^)1 ^^^^ given e > 0, let 8 be such that \f{x) — f{y)\ < e 
for \x — y\ < 5. Then we have 
Bn{x)

fcGr,,(x) 
where 
Tn : = | o , . . . , n ) \ A n = (fc G {0,... ,n} I I - - x\

For k G Tnix), i.e., |/c/n — x| < (5, we have \f{k/n) 
— f{x)\ < e, hence 
on the other hand, if \k/n — x\ > S, (9.11) yields 
Therefore, we conclude for n large enough so that M/{2nS'^) < €, 
\Bn{x) - f{x)\ < 2e 
uniformly in [0,1].

and one shows in the theory of probability that E [f{Xn{t))] 
converge uniformly to / . 
c. Weierstrass's approximation theorem for periodic functions 
We denote by Cj^ the class of continuous periodic functions in R with 
period T > 0. 
9.58 Theorem (Weierstrass, II). Every function f e C^^ is the uni-
form limit of trigonometric polynomials with period T. 

308 
9. Spaces of Continuous Functions, Banach Spaces and Abstract Equations 
In Section 9.3 we shall give a direct proof of this theorem and in Sec-
tion 11.5 we shall give another proof of it: the Fejer theorem. It is worth 
noticing that, in general, a continuous function is neither the uniform nor 
the pointwise sum of a trigonometric series. 
Here we shall prove that the claims in Theorems 9.58 and 9.53 are 
equivalent. By a linear change of variable we may assume that T = 27r. 
First let us prove the following. 
9.59 Lemma. Let f e C^([—7r,7r]) be even. Then for any e > 0 there is 
an even trigonometric polynomial 
T{x) := yjQfccoskx 
k=0 
such that \f{x) - T{x)\ < 6 V x G [-7r,7r]. 
orem 9.53 to the continuou 
n 
/(arccosj/) - ^ 
CkV^l <e 
in [-1,1], 
Proof. We apply Theorem 9.53 to the continuous function g{y) := /(arccos?/), y € 
[—1,1], to obtain 
hence 
n 
\f{x) — y^CkCOS^x\<e 
in [0,TT]. 
fc=o 
n 
To conclude, it suffices to notice that ^ 
Cfc cos'^ x is an even polynomial. 
D 
k=0 
Proof of Theorem 9.58. Let / € C2T^{R). We consider the two even functions in [—TT, TT] 
f{x) + f{-x), 
(fix) 
- 
f(-x))smx. 
Then Lemma 9.59 yields for any e > 0 
fix) + f(-x) 
= Ti(x) + ai(x), 
(fix) 
- fi-x)) 
sinx = T2{x) + a2{x) 
Ti{x) and T2{x) being two even trigonometric polynomials, and for the remainders a i 
and a2 one has 
|ai(a:)|, |a2(x)| < e 
in [-7r,7r]. 
Multiplying the first equation by sin^ x and the second by sin x and summing we find 
fix) sin^ X = Tsix) -\- asix), 
(9.12) 
for Tsix) 
a trigonometric polynomial and ||a3||oo^[_7r,7r] < 2e. The same argument 
applies to fix — 7r/2), yielding 
f(x 
j sin^ X = T4ix) -h a4ix) 
where T4 is a trigonometric polynomial and ||a4||oo,[-7r,7r] < 26. By changing the vari-
able X in a; + ^, we then infer 
fix) cos^ X = Tsix) + asix) 
(9.13) 
where Tsix) := T4(x-{-|) and ||Q;5||oo,[-7r,7r] < 2e. Summing (9.12) and (9.13) we finally 
conclude the proof.

9.60 Remark. Actually, the two Weiertrass theorems are equivalent. We 
have already proved Theorem 9.58 using Theorem 9.53. We now outline 
how to deduce the first Weierstrass theorem, Theorem 9.53, from Theo-
rem 9.58, leaving the details to the reader. Given / G C^([—7r,7r]), the 
function 
satisfies ^(TT) = g{—7r), hence g can be extended to a continuous periodic 
map of period 27r. According to Theorem 9.58, for any e > 0 we find a 
trigonometric polynomial 
n{e) 
Te{x) := ao -\- 2^i^k cosfcx + b^ sin/ex) 
with \g{x) — Tg(x)| < e for all x E [—7r,7r]. Next, we approximate sinfcx 
and cosfcx by polynomials (e.g., by Taylor polynomials), concluding that 
there is a polynomial Qe{x) with \Te{x) — Qe(x)| < e Vx G [—7r,7r], hence 
\g{x)-Q,{x)\<2em[-l,l]. 
9.3.2 Convolutions and Dirac approximations 
We now introduce a procedure that allows us to find smooth approxima-
tions of functions. 
a. Convolution product 
Here we confine ourselves to considering only continuous functions defined 
on the entire line. The choice of the entire line as a domain is not a restric-
tion, since every continuous function on an interval [a, b] can be extended 
to a continuous function in R and, actually for any 5 > 0, to a continuous 
function that vanishes outside [a — S^b^ 5].

consider the mean function 
of /

Simple consequences of the fundamental theorem of calculus are 
(i) fs{x) is Lipschitz continuous, 
(ii) fs{x) -^ f{x) pointwise, 
while from the estimate

\f{y)-f{x)\

and Theorem 6.35 
(iii) fs{x) -^ f{x) uniformly on every bounded interval of R.

The above allows us, of course, to uniformly approximate continuous functions with 
Lipschitz-continuous functions on every bounded interval. 
9.62 Definition. Let /,p : R ^ R be two Riemann integrable functions. 
Suppose that g{x — t)f{t) 
is summable in R for any x G R. Then the 
function 
g * f{x) := / g{x - y)f{y) dy, 
x G R, 
called the convolution product of f and g, is well defined. 
Clearly the map {f^g) -^ g * f 
(i) is a bilinear operator, 
(ii) g^ f = —/ * g since 
g * f[x) = / p(x - y)f{y)dy 
= - 
g{z)f{x -z)dz 
= 
-f*g{x),

i.e., e*^* * / is the fcth harmonic component of the periodic extension of / , compare 
Section 11.5. 
9.66 Theorem. Letg G C'^(R), and let f be Riemann summable. Suppose 
that either f or g vanishes outside a bounded interval [a,b]. Then g * f G 
C^(R) and Dk{g * f){x) = {Dug) * f{x) \/x e R. 

9.3 Approximation Theorems

Proof. We prove the claim when / = 0 outside [a, 6], the other case p = 0 outside [a, 6] 
is similar. By (9.15) we then have

(i) We now prove that g*feC^{R)iige 
C^(R). In fact, 
g*f{x-\-h)-g* 
f{x) = / {g{x - y -\- h) - g{x - y))f{y) dy = G * /(x), 
where G{x) := g{x -\- h) — g{x). Therefore, using (9.15), we get 
\g*f(x

(9.16) 
as /i —> 0 since \\g(t -\- h) — g{t)\\oo,[x-b,x-a] 
~^ 0, because of the uniform continuity of 
g on compact sets. 
(ii) Similarly, we prove that p * / G C^(R) if / G C^(R). We have 
g* f(x + h)- g* f{x) -

because of the uniform continuity of p' on compact sets, we then conclude that p * / is

continuous by (i). 
(iii) The general case is then proved by induction.

9.67 Remark. Let / and g be summable and let one of them vanish out-
side a bounded interval. If / instead of g is of class C^(R), then, recalhng 
that ^ * / = - / * ^, we infer from Theorem 9.66 that g * f e C^{R) and 
Dk{g ^ f){x) = g^ {Dkf){x). Therefore if both / and g are of class C^(E), 
then 
Dk{g * f){x) = (Dkg) * f{x) = g * {Dkf){x) 
and, in general, ^ * / is as smooth as the smoother of / and g.

9.68 Definition. A function k{x) G C^(R) such that 
k{x) = fc(—x), k{x) > 0, 
k{x) = 0 for \x\ > 1, 
/ k{x) dx = 1

is called a smoothing kernel.

(

ip{x) := { ^ \

if \x\ > 1 
is C°*^(E), nonnegative, even and with finite integral. Hence the map k{x) := -^(p(x), 
where A := f^(p{x)dx, 
is a smoothing kernel. 
Given a smoothing kernel fc(x), we can generate the family 
k,{x):=e-^k(^-^ 
e > 0 . 
Trivially, ke{—x) = fce(x) and 
ke G C^(R), 
ke{x) > 0, 
ke{x) = 0 per |x| > e, 
/ ke{x) dx = 1. 
JR 
Also ke{x) = 0 for \x\ > e and ||fee||oo = ||A:||oo/e. 
9.70 Definition. Given a smoothing kernel k, the mollifiers or smoothing 
operators Se are defined by 
SJ{x) := K * f{x) = f K{x - y)f{y) dy.

Since the functions ke are of class C ^ , the functions 5e/(x), x G M, are 
of class C^ by Theorem 9.66. Moreover, as shown by the next theorem, 
they converge to / in norms that are as strong as the differentiability of 
/; for instance, they converge uniformly or in norm C^ if / is continuous 
or if / is of class C^, respectively.

If / G C^(E), we have already proved in Theorem 9.66 that Sef is of class C^ and 
that (SefYix)

Applying (iv) to Sef and Sef 
we then reach the claim.

c. Approximation of the Dirac mass 
The family {fce} is often referred to as an approximation of the Dirac delta. 
In appHcations, the Dirac S is often "defined" as a function vanishing at 
every point but zero and with the property that 
/ 
+ 00 
6{x) dx = 1; 
sometimes it is "defined", with respect to convolution, as if it would operate 
like 
f 
J —c 
Of course, no such function exists in the classical sense; but it can be 
thought of as a linear operator from C^(M) into R 
We shall avoid dealing directly with J, as the correct context for doing this 
is the theory of distributions., and we set 
9.72 Definition. A sequence of nonnegative functions Dn : R ^> R with 
the properties that for any interval [a, b] and for any p > 0 we have

/ 
Dn{x) dx ^0, 
as n -^ (X), (9.17) 
JB{0,p) 
J[a,b]\B{0,p) 
is called an approximation of the S.

Show that 
Um / 
Dn{x-

Vx €]a, 6[. 
It is easy to prove the following. 
9.74 Theorem. Let {Dn} be an approximation of 6. Suppose that each 
Dn is continuous in M and let f he a continuous function in [a, 6]. Then 
the functions 
fn{x) := / Dn{x - y)f{y) dy, 
x G [a, 6], 
converge uniformly to f in every interval [c^d] strictly contained in [a, 6]. 
Theorem 9.74 uses, in an essential way, the fact that the approximations 
oiS are nonnegative. For instance, the result in Theorem 9.74 does not hold 
for the sequence of the Dirichlet kernels, since the Fourier series of / does 
not converge to / if / is merely continuous, compare Section 11.5.

Finally, observing that the functions fn{x) are actually polynomials of degree not 
greater than 2n, called Stieltjes polynomials, deduce from the above Wieierstrass's the-
orem, Theorem 9.53.

The functions Tn{x) in (9.18) are often called de la Vallee Poussin 
integrals. 
9.79 Remark. Let g G C^(R) be a periodic function with period 27r. 
Applying Theorem 9.78 to g{x) := /(3x), x G [—TT,TT], we deduce the 
uniform convergence of {Tn{x)] to g{x) in [—7r/3,7r/3], i.e., the uniform 
convergence of {Tn{x/i)} 
to g{x) in [—TT, TT]. Since the T^'s are trigonomet-
ric polynomials of degree at most 2n, we may deduce at once the second 
Weierstrass theorem from Theorem 9.78. 
9.3.3 The Stone—Weierstrass theorem 
Weierstrass's theorems can be generalized to and seen as consequences of 
the following theorem proved in 1937 by Marshall Stone (1903-1989) and 
known as the Stone-Weierstrass 
theorem. 
Let X be a compact metric space and let C{X) = C^{X,R) 
be the 
Banach space of continuous functions with uniform norm. An algebra of 
functions X is a real (complex) linear space of functions / : X —> R 
(respectively, / : X —> C) such that fgeAiif 
and g E A. We say that A 
distinguishes between the points of X if for any two distinct points x and 
y in X there is a function f in A such that f{x) ^ f{y). We say that A 
contains the constants if the constant functions belong to A. 
9.80 Theorem (Stone-Weierstrass). Let X be a compact metric space 
and let A be an algebra of continuous real-valued functions, A C C^(X, M). 
If A contains constants and if it also distinguishes between the points of 
X, then A is dense in the Banach space C^(X, R). 
Let A be an algebra of bounded and continuous functions. As we have 
seen, the function \y\ can be approximated uniformly in [0,1] by polyno-
mials. Consequently, if / G ^ , by considering instead of / the function 
h '-= //I I/I loo? we can approximate x -^ \f{x)\ uniformly by the functions 
Pn{f{x)) where {Pn} is a sequence of polynomials. Since the 
Pn{f{x)ys 
belong to A, as A is an algebra of functions and f E A, we conclude that 
I/I belongs to the uniform closure of A, and also

are in the uniform closure of A^ if both / and g are in the uniform closure 
of A 
A linear space of functions R with the property that max {f^g) and 
min (/, ^) are in i? if / and g e R is called a linear lattice: the above can 
be then restated as the closure of A is a linear lattice. To prove that A is 
dense in C^(X,R), it therefore suffices to prove the following. 
9.81 Theorem. Let X be a compact metric space. A linear lattice R C 
C^(X, R) is dense, provided it contains the constants and distinguishes 
between the points in X. 
Proof. First we show that, for any / G C^(X, E) and any couple of distinct points 
x,y G X, we can find a function iljx,y G R such that 
'^x,y{x) 
= f{x) 
^Px,y{y) = 
fiv)-
In fact by hypothesis, we can choose w ^ R such that w{x) ^ w{y); then the function 
(fix) - f{y)w(t) 
- if(x)w{y) 
- 
f{y)w{x)) 
i^x,y{t) := 
w(x) — w{y) 
has the required property. 
Given / G C^{X,R), 
e > 0 and y G X, for every x E X we find a ball 
B{x,rx) 
such that ijjx,y{t) > f{t) — e Vt G B{x,rx)- 
Since X is compact, we can cover it by a 
finite number of these balls {B^^} and we set (py := max tpxi,y- Then (py{y) = 
f{y) 
and ipy £ R since R is a lattice. We now let y vary, and for any y we find B{y, Vy) 
such that ^y{t) < f{t) -\- e^^t E B{y, Vy). Again covering X by a finite number of these 
balls {B(iii^ry^)}^ 
and setting (p := maxi c^y^, we conclude (p E'R and \^p{t) — /(t)| < e 
Vt G X, i.e., the claim. 
D 
Of course real polynomials in [a, 6] form an algebra of continuous func-
tions that contains constants and distinguishes between the points of [0,1]. 
Thus the Stone-Weierstrass theorem implies the first Weierstrass theorem 
and even more, we have the following. 
9.82 Corollary. Every real-valued continuous function on a compact set 
K C M.'^ is the uniform limit in K of a sequence of polynomials in n 
variables. 
Theorem 9.80 does not extend to algebra of complex-valued functions. 
In fact, in the theory of functions of complex variables one shows that 
the uniform limits of polynomials are actually analytic functions and the 
map z ^ ;^, which is continuous, is not analytic. However, we have the 
following. 
9.83 Theorem. Let A C C^(X, C) be an algebra of continuous complex-
valued functions defined on a compact metric space X. Suppose that A 
distinguishes between the points in X, contains all constant functions and 
contains the conjugate f of f if f E A. Then A is dense in 
C^{X,C).

Proof. JDenote by ^ o the subalgebra of A of real-valued functions. Of course 3?/ = 
^ ( / + / ) and ^f = -^(f - f) belong to ^ o if / and g E A. Since f{x) i^ f{y) implies 
that ^f(x) 
7^ 3f?/(y) or Qf{x) ^ ^f{y), 
Ao also distinguishes between the points of X

consequently, A is dense in C(X, C).

form an algebra that distinguishes between the points of [0,27r[ and con-
tains the constants. Thus, trigonometric polynomials are dense among con-
tinuous real-valued periodic functions of period 27r. 
More generally, from Theorem 9.83 we infer the following.

a. Baire's approximation theorem 
The next theorem relates semicontinuous functions to continuous func-
tions. 
9.85 Theorem (Baire). Let X be a metric space and let f : X ^>' R 
be a function that is bounded from above and upper semicontinuous. 
Then 
there is a decreasing sequence of continuous, actually Lipschitz continuous, 
functions {/„} such that fn{x) —> f{x) for all x e X. 
Proof. Consider the so-called Yosida regularization of / 
fn{x) := sup{/(2/) 
-nd{y,x)}. 
yex 
Obviously f{x) < fn{x) < s u p / , fnix) 
> fn+i{x). 
We shall now show that each fn is 
Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant less than n. Let x,y ^ X and assume that 
fnix)

fn{x) < f{x') - nd{x, x') -f- T)

Let us show that fnixo)

Suppose that X == R^. An immediate consequence of Dini's theorem, 
Theorem 9.36, and of Baire's theorem, is the following.

continuous functions that converges uniformly on compact sets to f.

Yosida regularization also turns out to be useful to approximate uniformly 
continuous functions from a metric (or normed) space into R by Lipschitz-
continuous functions. 
Let X be a normed space with norm 11 11. 
9.87 Proposition. The class of uniformly continuous functions f : X —> 
M is closed with respect to the uniform convergence. 
Recall that the modulus of continuity oi f : X —^ R is defined for all 
te 
[0,+oo[by 
Ufit) := sup[\f{x) 
- f{y)\ \x,yeX, 
\\x - y\\ < t } . 
(9.21) 
Clearly / is uniformly continuous on X if and only if ujf{t) -^ 0 as ^ —> 0. 
9.88 1. Prove Proposition 9.87. 
Lipschitz-continuous functions from X to R are of course uniformly 
continuous, therefore uniform limits of Lipschitz-continuous functions are 
uniformly continuous too, on account of Proposition 9.87. We shall now 
prove the converse, compare Example 9.61. 
9.89 Theorem. Every uniformly continuous function f : X ^^ R is the 
uniform limit of a sequence of Lipschitz-continuous 
functions. 
In order to prove Theorem 9.89, we introduce the function 6f{s) that 
measures the uniform distance of / from the class Lips{^) 
of Lipschitz-
continuous functions g : X —^R with Lipschitz constants not greater than 
s 
Sfis) :^mi[\\f - g\\^\g eUp,{X)}. 
9.90 %. Show that s —^ Sf(s) is nonincreasing and that / is the uniform limit of a 
sequence of Lipschitz-continuous functions if and only if (5y(s) -^ 0 as s -^ oo. 
Then we introduce the Yosida regularization of / : X —> R by 
fs{x):=m{^[f{y) 
+ 
s\\x-y\\]. 
9.91 t . Show that 
(i) fs is Lipschitz-continuous with Lipschitz constant s, 
(ii) fs (x) < ft (x) Va; if s < t, and, actually 
(iii) fs is the largest s-Lipschitz-continuous function among functions less than or 
equal to / . 

9.3 Approximation Theorems 
321 
9.92 Proposition. Let f : X —^ R be a uniformly continuous 
function. 
Then 
6f{s) = ^sup[ujf{t)-st}. 
(9.22) 
Moreover, the minimum distance of f from Lip5(X) is obtained at gs{x) := 
fs{x)-}-Sf{s), 
i.e., 
^f{s) = 
\\f-9s\\oo' 
Proof. Let g 6 Ups{X). 
Then 
l / W - / ( 2 / ) l < 2 | | / - ^ | | o o + 5||a:-2/||. 
For x,y such that ||ic — 2/11 < *? by taking the infimum with respect to g, we infer

and, taking the supremum in x and y with ||x — 2/|| < t, we get ujf{t) < 2Sf{s) + st, 
hence

Let us prove that the inequaUty (9.23) is actually an equality and the second part of

9. Spaces of Continuous Functions, Banach Spaces and Abstract Equations 
Proof of Theorem 9.89. It is enough to prove that infs>o<^/(s) = 0. First, we notice 
that ujf{t) is nondecreasing and subadditive. In fact, lix^y are such that ||a: —2/|| < a-\-h 
and we write

then l-z — x| < a and |>2; — 2/| < 6; consequently, 
\f(x) - fiz)\ < ujfia) 
and 
|/(s/) - f{z)\ < u,f{b) 
that yield at once 
ujf{a -\-b) < oJf(a) +

Next, we observe that for any e > 0 and t = me -|- cr, m G N, cr < e, we have m < t/e 
and 
ojf (t) = LJf {me + cr) < mcjy (e) -f ujf (cr) < cjy (e) - -\-ujf (e).

9.4 Linear Operators 
9.4.1 Basic facts 
In finite-dimensional spaces, linear maps are continuous, but this is no 
more true in infinite-dimensional normed spaces, see Example 9.96. 
9.94 % Show that 
Proposition. Let X and Y be normed spaces. Suppose that X is finite 
dimensional. 
Then every linear map L \ X ^>'Y is 
continuous. 
The following proposition characterizes linear maps between two Ba-
nach spaces that are continuous. 
9.95 Proposition. Let X and Y he normed spaces and let L : X -^ Y be 
a linear map. Then the following conditions are equivalent 
(i) L is continuous in X, 
(ii) L is continuous at 0, 
(iii) L is bounded on the unit ball, i.e., there exists K > 0 such that 
\\L{X)\\Y 
<K'ix 
with \\x\\x < 1, 
(iv) there exists a constant K such that \\L{X)\\Y 
< K\\X\\X 
^X E X, 
(v) L is Lipschitz continuous. 

9.4 Linear Operators 
323 
Proof. If L is continuous, then trivially, (ii) holds. If (ii) holds, then there exists S > 0 
such that ||L(a:)||y < 1 provided \\x\\x < S. This yields ||L(x)||y < 1/S if ||a;||x < 1, 
since L is linear, i.e., (iii). Assuming (iii) and the linearity of L, we infer that for all 
\\L{^)\\Y 
^ \ \ . ( 
X 
x i i 
^ 
\\x\\x 
II V \ \ x \ \ x J \ \ y - 
' 
i.e., (iv). (iv) in turn implies (v) since 
\\L(x) - L{y)\\Y = \\L{x - y)\\Y < K\\x - y\\x 
Vx,s/ 6 X, 
and trivially, (v) implies (i). 
D 
9.96 Example. Let X be a normed space and let {cn} C X be a countable system 
of independent vectors with ||en|| = 1, and let y C X be the subspace of finite linear 
combinations of {cn}. Consider the operator L :Y —^R defined on {cn} by L{en) '-= n 
Vn and linearly extended to Y. Evidently L is linear and not bounded. 
Linear maps between Banach spaces are often called linear operators. 
a. Continuous linear forms and hyperplanes 
Consider a linear map L : X ^ K defined on a linear normed space X, 
often called also a linear form. If L is not identically zero, we can find x 
such that X ^ ker L and we can decompose every x E X as 
L(x) _ 
/ 
L{x) 
_ 
( 
L,\X)\ 
L(x) 
V 
L(x) 
in other words 
X = Span {x}e ker L. 
However it may happen that kerL is dense in X. 
9.97 Proposition. Let L : X —^R be a linear map defined on a normed 
space X. Then ker L is closed if and only if L is continuous. 
Proof. Trivially, kerL := L~^(0) is closed if L is continuous. Conversely, if kerL = X, 
then L is constant, hence continuous. Otherwise we can choose x such that L(x) = 1. 
Since kerL is closed, also H := x-\-kerL 
is closed; since 0 ^ LT, we can then find a ball 
B(0, r) such that B{0,r) D H = 0. We now prove that L is continuous showing that 
\L{x)\ 
<l\/xeB{0,r). 
In fact, if |L(rE)| > 1 for some x G B(0,r), then 
X 
\\ 
1 
'\x\\ < r 
while 
\L{X)) 
\L(x)\\ 
\L{x)\' 
Since H = {x\ L(x) = 1}, we conclude that xjLix) 
e H f) B{0, r), a contradiction. 
D 
9.98 Corollary. If L : X -^ R is a linear map on a normed space X, 
then ker L is either closed or dense in X. 
In fact, the closure of ker L is a linear subspace that may agree either with 
kerL or X. 

324 
9. Spaces of Continuous Functions, Banach Spaces and Abstract Equations 
b. The space of linear continuous maps 
For any linear map L : X -^ Y between two normed spaces with norms 
\x and II ||y, we define 
\L\\cix,Y) '= 
sup 
||L(x)||y, 
(9.25) 
|x||x<l 
I.e., 
Il^ll/:(x,y) = PllocB, 
or, equivalently, 
{ xeX 
\x\\x - } . 
\C{X,Y) 
inf{ii:GR|||L(x)||y<i^||a:|U} 
so that 
\\Lix)\\Y<\\L\\cix,Y)\\x\\x 
V x e X 
One can shorten this to 
IMI<l|i||INI 
once the norms used to evaluate x, Lx and L are understood. 
Prom Proposition 9.95 it follows that L : X -^ Y is continuous if and 
only if \\L\\JC(X,Y) < +oo. Por this reason, linear continuous maps from X 
to Y are also called bounded operators. 
It is now easily seen that ||I/||£(x,y) is a norm on the linear space 
C{X, Y) of linear continuous maps from X into Y. 
9.99 Theorem. Let X be a normed space and let Y be a Banach space. 
Then £(X, Y) is a Banach space. 
Proof. Let {Ln} be a Cauchy sequence in C(X,Y). 
For any e > 0 there is no(e) such 
that \\Ln — Lm\\ < e for n,m > no- In particular, ||Ln(a:) — Lmix)\\Y 
< e||x||x for all 
X £ X, i.e., for every x ^ X {Ln(x)} 
is a Cauchy sequence in Y hence converges to an 
element L{x) G Y, Ln{x) —>• L{x) as n —>• oo. Letting n to infinity in 
Ln(x 
-\-y) = Ln{x) 
+ Ln{y), 
Ln{Xx) 
= 
XLnix), 
we see that L is linear. Letting m ^- cx) in ||Ln(ip) — Lm{x)\\Y 
< e valid for \\x\\x < 1? 
n > no(e), we also find \\Ln{x) — L(X)\\Y 
< e for ||a:||x ^ 1 and n > no(e). This 
implies ||L|| < \\Ln\\ + e and \\Ln — L\\ < e for n > no, which in turn yields Ln -^ -^ in 
C{X,Y). 
D 
c. Norms on matrices 
Por any n, let K = R (K = C) and consider R'^ (respectively C^) as an 
Euclidean (Hermitian) space endowed with the standard Euclidean (Her-
mitian) product and let | | be the associated norm. Let L : W^ —> K^ be 
linear, let L G Mm,n(^) 
be the associated matrix, L{x) =: Lx, and let 
/ii, /i2, •.., /in be the singular values of L, that is the eigenvalues of the 
matrix (L^L)^/^ ordered in increasing order. Then 
||L||2 = sup |L(x)p = sup {L*L{x)\x) = fil 
\x\ = l 
\x\ = l 

9.4 Linear Operators 
325 
Now define the i'^- norm of L € £(K",K'^), by 
,1/2 
\Lh:={Y.m?) 
Of course, || ||2 and || || are equivalent norms in >C(K'^,K'^), since 
CiJL^^K^) is finite dimensional. More precisely we compute 
||L||^ ^ tr(L^L) = ti(L^L) 
= ^x\ + 
,..^l, 
and therefore, 
9.100 Proposition. Let L G Mm,n{^)- Then \\L\\ is the maximum of the 
singular values of L and \\L\\ < \\L\\2 < \/n 11-^11- Moreover, \\L\\ = \\L\\2 
if and only if Rank L = 1. 
Proof. Let /xi, /i2, • • •, Mn be the singular values of L ordered in nondecreasing order. 
By the above, ||L|| = /Xn < H^lb < >/n||L|| while equality ||L|| = ||L||2 is equivalent to 
/ii = • • • = jjin-i = 0, and this happens if and only if Rank L = 1. 
D 
9.101 %, Let T : ^2 —>^ IK be a bounded operator and for i = 1,..., let e^ = 
{Sin}n' 
Then 
oo 
3 = 1 
d. Pointwise and uniform convergence for operators 
In £(X, Y) we may define two notions of convergence. 
9.102 Definition. Let {L^} C 
C{X,Y). 
(i) We say that {Ln} converges pointwise to L i/Vx G X we have 
\\Ln{x) - L{X)\\Y 
^ 0, 
(ii) we say that {Ln} converges to L in norm or uniformly, if 
\\Ln- 
L\\c{X,Y)= 
s u p 
\\Ln{x) 
- L{X)\\Y 
-^ 0 
aS U ^ OO. 
\\x\\x<l 
Trivially, Ln -^ L pointwise ii Ln -^ L uniformly. But the converse is 
in general false and holds true if X is finite dimensional. 
9.103 Example. Recall that a sequence {xn} is in ^2(K) if and only if Efcli ^l < +oo. 
For any n G N let e^^) := {Skn}k- Of course, ||e(^)||2 = 1 Vn. 
Consider the sequence of linear forms {Ln} on i2{^) defined by Ln{{xk}) 
= Xn-
For any x G ^2 W we have X]fcLi ^fc < +00, hence Ln{x) = Xn ^>- 0 as n ^>- 00, i.e., 
Ln —> 0 pointwise. On the other hand, 
\\Ln-0\\c(i^^^) 
= \\Ln\\cie2,R)= 
sup 
|Ln(x)|>Ln(e(^)) = l 
l|a;||2<l 
and {Ln} does not converge uniformly to 0.

e. The algebra End (X) 
Let X, Y and Z be linear normed spaces and let / : X —> F and g :Y -^ Z 
be linear continuous operators. The composition g o f : X -^ Z is again a 
linear continuous operator from X to Z, and for every x e X we have 
ll(5o/)(x)||z<IMI||/(x)||y<|M| 11/11INU, 
hence 
ll5o/ll<IMI 11/11- 
(9.26) 
9.104 Example. In general \\g o / | | < \\g\\ \\f\\. For instance, if X = R^ ^^(1 / and g 
are the orthogonal projections on the axes, we have ||/|| = ||p|| = 1 and fog = gof = 0, 
hence | | ^ o / | | = 1 1 / o p | | = 0 . 
9.105 Example. Let T : R"^ --^ R'^ he defined by T(x) = Tx where T := I

\\T\\ = 1, | | T - i | | = 1/6 and ||T|| | | T - i | | »

\\T-'oT\\. 
Let X be a Banach space with norm || \\x, denote the Banach space 
C{X,X) 
by End(X) and the norm on End(X) by || ||. The product of 
composition defines in End (X) a structure of algebra in which the product 
satisfies the inequality (9.26): this is expressed by saying that End(X) is 
a Banach algebra. Clearly, if L G End (X) and L^ = L o L o - - - o L , then 
by (9.26) we have 
IIL^II < ||L|r. 
(9.27) 
Again, in general, we may have a strict inequality.

9.4.2 Fundamental theorems 
In this subsection, we briefly illustrate four of the most important theorems 
about the structure of linear continuous operators on normed spaces. The 
first three, the principle of uniform boundedness, the open mapping theo-
rem and the closed graph theorem are a consequence of Baire's category 
theorem, see Chapter 5, and are due to Stefan Banach (1892-1945); the 
fourth one, known as Hahn-Banach theorem, was proved independently 
by Hans Hahn (1879-1934) in 1926 and by Banach in 1929. 

328 
9. Spaces of Continuous Functions, Banach Spaces and Abstract Equations 
a. The principle of uniform boundedness 
The following important theorem is known as the Banach-Steinhaus the-
orem and also as the principle of uniform boundedness. 
9.109 Theorem (Banach-Steinhaus). LetX be a Banach space andY 
be a normed linear space. Let {T^} be a family of bounded linear operators 
from X to Y indexed on an arbitrary set A (possibly nondenumerable). If 
sup llTc^xlly < C{x) < +00 
Vx e X, 
aeA 
then there exists a constant C such that 
SUp\\Ta\\ciX,Y)<C<+00. 
aeA 
Proof. Set 
Xn :== la: G X I ||Tax||y <n\/ae 
AV 
Xn is closed and by hypothesis UnXn = X. By Baire's category theorem, it follows 
that there exists no £N, XQ £ X and ro > 0 such that B(xo, ro) C Xno, that is 
\\Tcc{xo -h ro2)||y < no

ro 
ro 
The following corollaries are trivial consequences. 
9.110 Corollary. Let {Tk} be a sequence of bounded linear operators from 
a Banach space X into a normed space Y. Suppose that for each x e X 
limfc_^oo Tk^ =: Tx exists in Y. Then the limit operator T is also a bounded 
linear operator from X to Y and we have 
\\T\\cix,Y) 
<liminf||Tfc|U(x,y). 
k—>oo 
9.111 Corollary. Let I < p < 4-oo. Any linear operator from ip{M.) into 
a normed linear space Y is continuous. 
Proof. In fact, the linear operators {Ln} defined by 
L n ( 0 : = i > ( ( 6 , 6 , . . - , ^ n , 0 , 0 , . . . ) ) 
if? = (Ci,?2,---) 
are clearly continuous and l/n(0 ~^ ^{0 i^ ^p- Therefore L is continuous by the 
Banach-Steinhaus theorem. 
D 
The following theorem, again due to Banach, is also a consequence of Baire's cate-
gory theorem. 

9.4 Linear Operators 
329 
9.112 Theorem. Given a sequence of bounded linear operators {T^} from a Banach 
space X into a normed linear space Y, the set 
{x ex\ 
liminf ||Tfcx||y < +oo) 
fc—••oo 
either coincides with X or is a set of the first category of X. 
This in turn implies the following. 
9.113 Corollary (Principle of condensation of singularities). For p = 1,2,..., 
let {Tp,q}, q = 1,2,..., be a sequence of bounded linear operators from a Banach 
space into a normed space Yp. Assume that for each p there exists Xp £ X such that 
limsupq_^QQ \\Tp^qXp\\c(^X,Yp) = oo- Then the set 
\x e X\ limsup||Tp,q||£(x,y„) = +oo for all p = 1,2,3,.. 
A 
*^ 
• q-^oo 
•' 
is of second category. 
The above principle gives a general method of finding functions with many singu-
larities. For instance one can find in this way a continuous function x(t) of period 27r 
such that the partial sum of its Fourier expansion 
n 
Snf(t) := 
h Y^ (ttfc cos kt -h bk sin kt) 
^ 
k=i 
satisfies the condition 
limsup |5n/(*)l = ^^ 
n—+00 
in a set P C [0, 27r] which has the power of the continuum.^ 
b. The open mapping theorem 
9.114 Theorem (Banach's open mapping theorem). Let X and Y 
be Banach spaces and let T be a surjective bounded linear operator from X 
into y . Then T is open, i.e., it maps open sets of X onto open sets ofY. 
Proof 
We divide the proof into two steps. 
Step 1. First we prove that there is a <5 > 0 such that 
T B x ( 0 , l ) D By (0,2(5). 
Set Xn := nTBx(0,1). 
All Xn are closed and, since T is surjective, U ^ ^ X n = Y. 
By Baire's category theorem, see Theorem 5.118, it follows that for some n, Xn has 
a nonvoid interior. By homogeneity, T(Bx(0,1) has a nonvoid interior, too, i.e., there 
exists yo e Y and 6 > 0 such that By(2/0,4(5) C T(Bx(0,1). By symmetry -yo G 
T B x ( 0 , l ) , and, as TJBX(0, 1) is convex, By (0, 26) C T B x (0,1). 
Step 2. We shall now prove that 
T B x ( 0 , l ) D B y ( 0 , 5 ) , 
that is the claim. Observe that by Step 1 and homogeneity 
TBx (0, r) D BY (0, 2Sr) 
Vr > 0.

9. Spaces of Continuous Functions, Bansich Spaces and Abstract Equations 
We want to prove that the equation Tx = y has a solution x € Bx(0,1) for any 
y e By(0,(5). Let y e Y be such that ||t/||y < 6. By (9.28) there exists xi e X 
such that ||a;i||x < 1/2 and ||Txi — 2/||y < <5/2- Similarly, considering the equation 
Tx = y — Txi, one can find X2 £ X such that ||a:2||x < 1/4 and \\y — Txi — TX2\\Y 
< 
6/4. By induction, we then construct points Xn E X such that ||xn||x < 2~^ and 
\\y - E L i ^ ^ f c l l v < V2''- Therefore the series X3fc=i ^k is absolutely convergent in 
X with sum less than 1, hence it converges to some x E: X with ||ic||x < 1? and 
\\y-Tx\\Y=0. 
D 
9.115 ^. Show the converse of the open mapping theorem: if T : X —>• y is an open, 
bounded linear operator between Banach spaces, then T is surjective. 
A trivial consequence of Theorem 9.114 is the following. 
9.116 Corollary (Banach's continuous inverse theorem). 
LetX^Y 
be Banach spaces and let T : X ^^ Y be a surjective and one-to-one 
bounded linear operator. Then T~^ is a bounded operator. 
9.117 Remark. Let X and Y be Banach spaces and let T : X -^ F be 
a linear continuous operator. Often one says that the equation Tx = y is 
well posed if for any y EY it has a unique solution x E X which depends 
continuously on y. Corollary 9.116 says that the equation Tx = y is well-
posed if X and Y are Banach spaces and Tx = y is uniquely solvable 
yyeY. 
c. The closed graph theorem 
Let X, Y be two Banach spaces. Then X xY endowed with the norm 
\\{x,y)\\xxY:=\\x\\x 
+ \\y\\Y 
is also a Banach space. 
9.118 Theorem (Banach's closed graph theorem). Let X andY be 
Banach spaces and letT : X ^^Y 
be a linear operator. Then T \ X 
-^Y 
is bounded if and only if its graph 
GT := {{x,y) e X xY\y 
= Tx] 
is closed in X 
xY. 
Proof. If T is continuous, then trivially GT is closed. Conversely, GT is a closed linear 
subspace of X x y , hence GT is a Banach space with the induced norm of X xY. 
The 
linear map n : GT —> X, 7r((x, Tx)) := x, is a bounded linear operator that is one-to-one 
and onto; hence, by the Banach continuous inverse theorem, the inverse map of TT, n~^ : 
X -^ GT, X -^ (x,Tx), is a bounded linear operator, i.e., \\x\\x + ||Tx||y < C||x||x 
for some constant C. T is therefore bounded.

d. The Hahn-Banach theorem 
The Hahn-Banach theorem is one of the most important results in hnear 
functional analysis. Basically, it allows one to extend to the whole space 
a bounded linear operator defined on a subspace in a controlled way. In 
particular, it enables us to show that the dual space, i.e., the space of linear 
bounded forms on X, is rich. 
9.119 Theorem (Hahn-Banach, analytical form). Let X be a real 
normed space and let p : X ^^'R be a sublinear functional^ that is, satisfy-
ing 
p{x + 2/) < p{x) + p{y), 
p(\x) = Xp{x) 
VA > 0, Vx, y E X. 
Let Y be a linear subspace of X and let f : Y —^ R be a linear func-
tional such that f{x) < p{x) Vx G F . Then f can be extended to a linear 
functional F : X ^ R satisfying 
F{x) = f{x) Vx G y, 
F{x) < p{x) Vx G X. 
Proof. Denote by /C the set of all pairs (Ya, Qa) where Ya is a linear subspace of X 
such that Yot D Y and ga is a linear functional on Y^ satisfying 
9<x{x) = fix) Vx G X, 
gcc{x) < p{x) Vx G Fa-
We define an order in /C by (Ya,ga) < (^/3,p/3) if Ya C Yj3 and ga = gp on Yot. Then K 
becomes a partially ordered set. Every totally ordered subset {iXoi^goc)} clearly has an 
upperbound {Y\g') 
given by Y' = U(3Yfs, g' = gp on Yp. Hence, by Zorn's lemma, see 
e.g., Section 3.3 of [GM2], there is a maximal element {Yo,go). If we show that YQ = X, 
then the proof is complete with F = go. 
We shall assume that YQ ^ X and derive a contradiction. Let y\ ^YQ and consider 
Yi := Span (YQ U {yi}) = [x = y-{-Xyi^y 
eYo, 
AG M } , 
notice that y EYQ and A G M are uniquely determined by x, otherwise we get yi G Vo-
Define pi : Ki —> M by gi (y + Ai/i) '-= go{y) -\- X c. If we can choose c in such a way that 
giiy + Xyi) = go{y) + Ac < ^(t/ + Xyi) 
for all A G M, y G YQ, then {Yi,gi) 
G K and {Yo,go) < {Yi,gi), 
Yi # YQ. This 
contradicts the maximality of (Yo,go). 

332 
9. Spaces of Continuous Functions, Banach Spaces and Abstract Equations 
To choose c, we notice that for x,y EYQ 
9o{y) - 9o{x) = go{y-x) 
< p{y - x) <p{y-{-yi) 
+pi-yi 
- x). 
Hence 
-p{-yi -x) - 9o{x) <p(y + yi) - go{y)-
This impUes that 
A'.= 
^n\>\-p{-yi-x)-go{x)\ 
< ini \p{y+ 
yi) - go{y)\ =\ B.

Thus we can choose c such that A <c< 
B. Then 
c<p{y^- 
yi) - go{y) 
Vy € Fo, 
pi-yi 
-y) 
- goiy) <c 
Vy G YQ. 
Multiplying the first inequality by A, A > 0, and the second by A, A < 0, and replacing 
y with y/X we conclude that for all A 7^ 0 and trivially for A = 0 
Xc<p{y-i-yi) 
- go{y). 
9.120 Theorem (Hahn-Banach). Let X be a normed linear space of 
K = R or K = C and let Y be a linear subspace of X. Then for every 
f E £(F, K) there exists F e £(X, K) such that 
F{x) = f{x) Vx G r, 
\\F\\cix,K) = ll/IU(y,K). 
Proof. If X is a real normed spgice, then the assertion follows from Theorem 9.119 
with p(x) = \\f\\c(Y,R)\\^\\x- 
To prove that \\F{x)\\c(x,R) 
< \\f\\c(Y,R). 
notice that 
F{x) = e\F{x)\, 6 := ±1, then 
\F{x)\ = eF(x) = F{ex) < p(Ox) = ||/||£(y,R)||^a:||x = ||/||£(y,R)lkllx. 
This shows ||i^||£(x,R) £ ll/ll£(y,R)- The opposite inequality is obvious. 
Suppose now that X and Y are complex normed spaces. Consider the real-valued 
map 
h{x) := dlf{x), 
xeY. 
/i is a R-linear bounded form on Y considered as a real normed space since 
IM^)l<l/(x)|<||/||c(y,c)INIx 
Vxey, 
thus the first part of the proof yields a R-linear bounded map H : X —^ R, such that 
H{x) = h{x) Vx € y and \H(x)\ < ||/||£(y,R)||x||x Vx G X. 
Now define 
F{x) := H{x) - iH{ix) 
Vx G X, 
hence H{x) — dlF(x). It is easily seen that F : X —> C is a C-linear map and extends 
/ . It remains to show that 
I^WI < ll/ll£(y,c)IMIx 
V x e X . 
For X E X, we can write F(x) = re*^ with r > 0. Hence 
\F{x)\ =r = R{e-'^F{x)) 
= ^F{e-'^x) 
= 
H{e''^x)

Simple consequences are the following corollaries. 
9.121 Corollary. Let X be a normed space and let x E X. Then there 
exists F G C{X^ M) such that 
F{x) = \\x\\x, 
\\F\\c(x,R) = l' 
9.122 Corollary. Let X be a normed space. Then for all x e X 
\\x\\x = SUP{F(X) I F e £(X,M), \\F\\cix<R) < l } 
9.123 Corollary. Let Y be a linear subspace of a normed linear space X. 
IfY 
is not dense in X, then there exists F G >C(X, R) F ^ 0, such that 
F{y) - 0 Vy G y . 
9.124 %. Prove Corollaries 9.121, 9.122 and 9.123. 
We can give a geometric formulation to the Hahn-Banch theorem that 
is very useful. For the sake of simplicity from now on we shall assume that 
X is a real normed space, even though the following results hold also for 
complex normed spaces. 
A closed affine hyperplane in X is a set of the form 
H:=ixex\ 
F{x) = a\ 
where F G £(X,M) and a G R. It defines the two half-spaces 
H.=lxeX\ 
F{x) < aV

Then

9.126 Proposition. Let C C X be an open convex subset of the real

closed affine hyperplane {x \ f{x) = f{x)}. 
Proof. By translation we can assume 0 G C and introduce the gauge function p{x) by 
Lemma 9.125. If Y := Span{^} and g : Span {^} —>> E is the linear map g{tx) := t, 
it is clear that g(x) < p{x) \/x G Span{x}. By Theorem 9.119, there exists a linear 
extension f of g such that f{x) < p(x) \/x G X. In particular, we have f(x) = 1 and 
/ is bounded because of (ii) of Lemma 9.125. On the other hand, f{x) < 1 Va: G C by 
(iii) of Lemma 9.125.

9.127 Theorem (Hahn-Banach thereom, geometrical formi). Let 
A and B be two nonempty disjoint convex sets of a real normed space 
X. Suppose A is open. Then A and B can be separated by a closed affine 
hyperplane. 
Proof. Set C := A — B = {x — y\x e A, ye 
B}. Trivially C is convex and open as 
C := Uy^siA

the affine hyperplane {f{x) = a} separates A and B.

9.5 Some General Principles for 
Solving Abstract Equations 
In this final section we establish some fundamental principles concerning 
the solvability of abstract equations 

9.5 Some General Principles for Solving Abstract Equations 
335 
Au = f 
where A : X ^ F is a continuous function also called a continuous nonlin-
ear operator between Banach spaces. These principles are fully appreciated 
for instance when dealing with the theory of ordinary or partial differential 
equations; however in Chapter 11 we shall illustrate some of their applica-
tions. 
9.5.1 The Banach fixed point theorem 
Many problems take the form of finding a fixed point for a suitable trans-
formation. For instance, if A maps X into X where X is a vector space, the 
equation Au = 0 is equivalent to An -\-u = u^ i.e., to finding a fixed point 
for the operator A -h Id. The contraction mapping theorem^ proved by Ste-
fan Banach (1892-1945) in 1922, an elementary version of which we saw in 
Theorem 8.48 in [GM2], is surely one of the simplest results that ensures 
the existence of a fixed point and also gives a procedure to determine it. 
The method has its origins in the method of successive approximations of 
Emile Picard (1856-1941) and may be regarded as an abstract formulation 
of it. Let {xji] be defined by 
Xji 
= 
r 
(^XTI—I j . 
If {xn} converges to x and F is continuous, then x is a fixed point of F, 
F{x) = X. 
a. The fixed point theorem 
Let X be a metric space. A map T : X ^ X is said to be k-contractive if 
d{T{x),T{y)) 
< kd{x,y) Vx,y G X, or, in other words, if T : X ^ X is 
Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant 
less than or equal to fc. If 0 < A: < 1, T is often said simply a contraction 
or a contractive mapping. A point a: G X for which Tx = x is called a 
fixed point for T. The contraction principle states that contractions have 
a unique fixed point. 
9.128 Theorem (The fixed point theorem of Banach). Let X be a 
complete metric space and letT : X -^ X be k-contractive with 0 < k < 1. 
Then T has a unique fixed point. Moreover, given XQ G X, the sequence 
{xn} defined recursively by Xn-\-i = T{xn) converges with an exponential 
rate to the fixed-point, and the following estimates hold

Proof. The proof is as in Theorem 8.48 of [GM2]. First we prove uniqueness. If x, y are 
two fixed points, from d{x,y) = d{Tx,Ty) 
< kd{x,y), 
0 < k < 1 we infer d{x,y) = 0, 
i.e., X = y. 
Then we prove existence. Choose any XQ £ X and let Xn-\-i '•= T{xn), 
n > 0. We 
have 
d{Xn-\-l,Xn) 
< kd{Xn,Xn-l) 
< k^d{xi,Xo)

Therefore d{xp,Xn) 
—^ 0 as n,p -^ oo, i.e., {xn} is a Cauchy sequence, hence it has a 
limit X ^ X and a; is a fixed point as it is easily seen passing to the limit in a^n+i = T{xn)-
Finally, we leave to the reader the proof of the convergence estimates. 
D 
Notice that the second estimate in Theorem 9.128 allows us to evaluate 
the number of iterations that are sufficient to reach a desired accuracy; the 
second estimate allows us to evaluate the accuracy of Xn as an approximate 
value of X in terms of d(xn-\-i,Xn)-

9.131 Proposition. Let X be a Banach space and T : X —^ X a k-

Proof. For any y E X the equation x — Tx = y is equivalent to x = y -\- Tx =: F{x). 
Since F is fc-contractive and fc < 1, the fixed point theorem shows that x — Tx = y has 
a unique solution for any given y ^ X, i.e., Id — T is bijective. Finally, if x — Tx = y, 
then

Then, of course the functions Lt^ t £ [0,1], are injective; moreover, Li is 
surjective if and only if LQ is surjective. 
Proof. Injectivity follows from the linearity and (9.30). Suppose now that Ls is surjec-
tive for some s. Then Ls : X ^ Y is invertible and by (9.30) ||(I/s)~^|| < C. We shall 
now prove that the equation Ltx = y can be solved for any y E Y provided t is closed 
to s. For this we notice that Ltx = y is equivalent to 
LsX = y + (Ls — Lt)x = y + (t — s)Lox — {t — s)Lix 
which, in turn, is equivalent to 
X = L-^y 
+ (t - S)L-^{LQ 
- Li)x 
=: 
Tx 
since Ls '• X -^Y 
has an inverse. Then we observe that ||Ta; — T2;||y < C|t — s|(||Lo|| + 
||Li||), consequently T is a contractive map if 
\t-s\<6:= 
^(ll^oll + lli^il 
and we conclude that Lt is surjective for all t with |t — s| < 5. Since <5 is independent of 
s, starting from a surjective map LQ we successively find that Lt with t 6 [0,(5], [0,2(5], 
... is surjective. We therefore prove that Li is surjective in a finite number of steps. 
D 
9.135 Remark. Notice that the proof of Theorem 9.134 says that, assuming (9.30), 
the subset of [0,1] 
5 := | s 6 [0,1] I Ls : X ^ y is surjectivej 
is open and closed in [0,1]. Therefore S = [0,1] provided S ^ 0,

9.5.2 The Caccioppoli-Schauder fixed point 
theorem 
Compared to the fixed point theorem of Banach, the fixed point theorem 
of Caccioppoh and Schauder is more sophisticated: it extends the finite-
dimensional fixed point theorem of Brouwer to infinite-dimensional spaces. 
9.136 Theorem (The fixed point theorem of Brouwer). Let K he 
a nonempty, compact and convex set of W^ and let f he a continuous 
map mapping K into itself. Then f has at least a fixed point in K. 
The generalization to infinite dimensions and to the abstract setting 
is due to JuUusz Schauder (1899-1943) at the beginning of the Twenties 
of the past century, however in specific situations it also appears in some 
of the works of George Birkhoff (1884-1944) and Oliver Kellogg (1878-
1957) of 1922 and of Renato Caccioppoh (1904-1959) (independently from 
Juhusz Schauder) of the 1930's, in connection with the study of partial 
differential equations. 
Brouwer's theorem relies strongly on the continuity of the map / and in 
particular, on the property that those maps have of transforming bounded 
sets of a finite-dimensional linear space into relatively compact sets. As we 
have seen in Theorem 9.21, such a property is not valid anymore in infinite 
dimensions, thus we need to restrict ourselves to continuous maps that 
transform bounded sets into relatively compact sets. In fact, the following 
example shows that a fixed-point theorem such as Brouwer's cannot hold 
for continuous functions from the unit ball of an infinite-dimensional space 
into itself. 
9.137 Example. Consider the map / : ^2 —>^ ^2 given by 
Clearly / maps the unit ball of ^2 in itself, is continuous and has no fixed point. 
a. Compact maps 
9.138 Definition. Let X and Y he normed spaces. The (non)linear op-
erator A: X ^yY 
is called compact if 
(i) A is continuous, 
(ii) A maps hounded sets of X into relatively compact suhsets ofY, equiv-
alently for any hounded sequence {xk} C X we can extract a suhse-
quence {xn^} such that {Axnk} ^^ convergent. 
9.139 Example. Consider the integral operator A : C^{[a,b]) -^ C^([a, 6]) that maps 
u e C^{[a,b]) into Au{x) G C^{[a,b]) defined by 
Au{x) := / 
F{x,y,u{y))dy 
J a

where F{x,y,u) 
is a continuous real-valued function in R^. For r > 0 set Qr := 
{{x,y,u) 
eM.^\x,y 
e[a,b], 
|u| < r} and 
Mr := [u e C^{[a,b]) | ||tx||oo < r } . 
Proposition. A : Mr -^ C^{[a,b]) is a compact 
operator. 
Proof, (i) First we prove that A : Mr —» C^([a, b]) is continuous. Fix e > 0 and observe 
that, F being uniformly continuous in Qr, there exists S > 0 such that 
\F{x,y,u)- 
F{x,y,v)\ 
< e 
if (x, y, u), (x, y, v) G Br and |IA — i;! < 6. Consequently, we have 
\F{x,y,u{y)) 
- F{x,y,v{y))\ 
< e 
for u, t> € Mr with \\u — t'||cx),[a,6] < <^? hence 
\\Au-Av\\^^^a^^^= 
sup \f[F{x,y,u{y))-F{x,yMy))]dy\<e{b-a). 
(9.31) 
(ii) It remains to show that A maps bounded sets into relatively compact sets. To do 
that, it suffices to show that A{Mr) is relatively compact in C^([a,6]). We now check 
that A{Mr) C C^([a, 6]) is a set of equibounded and equicontinuous functions. Then 
the Ascoli-Arzela theorem. Theorem 9.48, yields the required property. In fact, the 
equiboundedness of functions in A{Mr) follows from 
\\Au\\oo<{b-a) 
sup 
\F{x,y,z)l 
ix,y,z)eQr 
while the equicontinuity of functions in A{Mr) is just (9.31). 
D 
Compact operators arise as limits of maps with finite rank as shown 
by the following theorem. 
9.140 Theorem. Let X and Y be Banach spaces and M C X a nonempty 
bounded set. We have 
(i) If {An}, An : M —>Y, is a sequence of compact operators that con-
verges to A : M -^ Y in B{A,Y), 
i.e., \\An - A\\]siA,Y) -^ 0 as 
n ^ oo, then A si compact. 
(ii) Suppose A : M ^^ Y is compact. Then there exists a sequence {An} 
of continous operators An '. X ^^ Y such that \\An — ^||OO,M —^ 0 as 
n ^ oo and each An has range in a finite-dimensional subspace ofY 
as well as in the convex envelope of A{M). 
Proof, (i) Fix e > 0 and choose n so that \\An — A||oo,M < c- Since An{M) is relatively 
compact, we can cover AniM) 
with a finite number of balls An(M) C 
[Jl^-^B{xi,e), 
i = 1 , . . . , / . Therefore A(M) C ul^-^B{xi,2e), 
i.e., A{M) is totally bounded, hence 
A{M) has compact closure, compare Theorem 6.8. 
(ii) Since A{M) is relatively compact, for each n there is a —-net, i.e., elements yj G 
A(M), j = 1,..., Jn such that A(M) C ^j=iB(yj,l/n), 
or, equivalently, 
min \\Ax - yjW < - 
\/x e M.

It is easily seen that the functions aj : M —> R are continuous and do not vanish

b. The Caccioppoli-Schauder theorem 
9.141 Theorem (CaccioppoU-Schauder). Let M C X be a closed, 
bounded, convex nonempty subset of a Banach space X. Every compact 
operator A: M -^ M from M into itself has at least a fixed point. 
Proof. Let WQ € M. Replacing u with u — UQ we may assume that O E M . Prom 
(ii) of Theorem 9.140 there are finite-dimensional subspaces Xn C X and continuous 
operators An : M -^ Xn such that \\Au - Anu\\ < ^ and AniM) 
C co{A{M)). 
The 
subset Mn -= Xn n M is bounded, closed, convex and nonempty (since 0 G Mn) and 
An{Mn) 
C Mn- Brouwer's theorem then yields a fixed point for An ' Mn —^ Mn, ie., 
Un 6 Mn, 
A-nUn — Un, 
hence, as the sequence {un} is bounded, 
\\AUn -Un\\ 
= \\AUn - AnUn\\ 
< - | | W n | | —^ 0. 
n 
Since A is compact, passing to a subsequence still denoted by {un}, we deduce that 
{Aun} 
converges to an element v £ X. On the other hand v G M, since M is closed, 
and 
\\un - v\\ < \\v - Aun\\ + \\Aun - Un\\ -^ 0 
as n —^ oo; 
thus Un —^ V and from Aun = Un Vn we infer Av = v taking into account the continuity 
of A

c. The Leray-Schauder principle 
A consequence of the Caccioppoli-Schauder theorem is the following prin-
ciple, which is very useful in applications, proved by Jean Leray (1906-
1998) and Juliusz Schauder (1899-1943) in 1934 in the more general con-
text of the degree theory and often referred to as to the fixed point theorem 
of Helmut Schaefer (1925- ) . 
9.142 Theorem (Schaefer). Let X he a Banach space and A : X —^ X 
a compact operator. Suppose that the following a priori estimate holds: 
there is a positive number r > 0 such that, ifuEX 
solves 
u = tAu 
for some 0 < ^ < 1, 
then 
Then the equation 
has at least a solution. 
\u\\ < r. 
Av 
V e X 
Proof. Let M := {u £ X \ \\u\\ < r} and consider the composition B of A with the 
retraction on the ball, i.e., 
Au 
if \\Au\\ < r, 
{\\Au\\ 
Bu := < 
rAu 
B maps M to M, is continuous and maps bounded sets in relatively compact sets, since 
A is compact. Therefore the Caccioppoli-Schauder theorem yields a fixed point u £ M 
for B, Bu = u. Now, if ||^it|| < r, It is also a fixed point for A; otherwise \\Au\\ > r and 
f 
r 
u — Bu = -—377^w ~ tAu, 
t := 
\\Au\\ 
\\An\\ 
-
hence ||iZ|| < r: it follows that also ||-BtI|| < r, i.e., u = Bu = Au and u is again a fixed 
point for ^ . 
D 
Theorems 9.134 and 9.142 may be regarded as special cases of a sort of 
general principle: a priori estimates on the possible solution yield existence 
of a solution. 
9.5.3 The method of super- and sub-solutions 
In this section we state an abstract formulation of the following principle 
that reminds us of the intermediate value theorem: to find a solution, it 
often suffices to find a subsolution and a supersolution.

a. Ordered Banach spaces 
9.143 Definition. An order cone in a Banach space X is a subset X^ 
such that 
(i) X+ is closed, convex nonempty and X+ 7^ {0}, 
(ii) if u e XJ^ and A > 0, then Xu G X+, 
(iii) if u ^ X^ and —u G X^, then u = {). 
An order cone X+ C X defines a total order in X 
u <v 
if and only if 
v — u e X.^, 
and we say that X is an ordered Banach space (by X+). In this case 
intervals in X are well defined 
[u,w] := {v e X \ u < V < u)}. 
9.144 Definition. An order cone X^ is called normal if there is a number 
c > 0 such that \\u\\ < c\\v\\ whenever 0 < u <v. 
9.145 Example. In R"^ with the Euclidean norm the set 
X+ =R!f. := | ( x i , . . . , X n ) U i > 0 Vi} 
is a normal order cone: 0 < x <y implies \x\ < \y\. 
9.146 Example. In the Banach space C^([a, 6]) with the uniform norm 
Cl([a,b]) 
:= |w e C^{[a,b])\u{x) 
>OWxe 
[a,6]} 
is a normal order cone. 
9.147 %. Let u,v,w,Un,Vn 
be elements of an order cone X^ of a Banach space X. 
Show that 
(i) u < V and v < w imply u < w, 
(ii) u < V and v < u imply u = v, 
(iii) ii u <v, then u-\-w<v-\-w 
and Aw < At; VA > 0, Vtt; G X, 
(iv) if Un < Vn, Un ^^ u and Vn -^ V as n -^ 00, then w < f, 
(v) if XJ^ is normal, then u<v<'w 
imply

b. Fixed points via sub- and super-solutions 
9.148 Theorem. Let X be a Banach space ordered by a normal order 
cone J let UQ^VQ E X and let A : [UQ^VQ] C X -^ X be a (possibly nonlinear) 
compact operator. Suppose that A is monotone increasing, i.e., Au < Av 
whenever u <v and that 
(i) UQ is a subsolution for the equation Au = u, i.e., UQ < AUQ, 
(ii) ^0 is a supersolution for the equation Au = u, i.e., AVQ < VQ. 
Then the two iterative processes 
Un+i = Aun 
and 
Vn-\-i — A.Vn 
Vn > 0 
started respectively, from UQ and VQ converge respectively to solutions u-
and u^ of the equation u — Au. Moreover 
UQ ^ Ul ^ " ' '^ Un ^ " ' '^ U- < U^ < ' " < Vn < " ' '^ VO-
Proof. By induction 
UQ < • ' ' < Un < Vn < " • < Vo, 
since A is monotone. Prom (v) of Exercise 9.147 
11^0-itnll < C||vo-ixoll 
Vn, 
i.e., {un} is bounded. As A is compact, there exists u- 
G X such that for a subse-
quence {uk^} of {un} we have Au^^ -^ u- as n —)- oo. Finally u- — Au-^ since A is 
continuous. One operates similarly with {vn}- 
^ 
9.149 Remark. Notice that the conclusion of Theorem 9.148 still holds 
if we require that A be monotone on the sequences {un} and {vn} defined 
by Un-\-i = Aun and Vn^\ = Avn started respectively, at i^o and v^ instead 
of being monotone in [UQ? ^O]-

10. Hilbert Spaces, Dirichlet's 
Principle and Linear Compact 
Operators 
In a normed space, we can measure the length of a vector but not the angle 
formed by two vectors. This is instead possible in a Hilbert space, i.e., a 
Banach space whose norm is induced by an inner (or Hermitian) product. 
The inner (Hermitian) product allows us to measure the length of a vector, 
the distance between two vectors and the angle formed by them. 
The abstract theory of Hilbert spaces originated from the theory of 
integral equations of Vito Volterra (1860-1940) and Ivar Fredholm (1866-
1927), successively developed by David Hilbert (1862-1943) and J. Henri 
Poincare (1854-1912) and reformulated, mainly by Erhard Schmidt (1876-
1959), as a theory of linear equations with infinitely many unknowns. The 
axiomatic presentation, based on the notion of inner product, appeared 
around the 1930's and is due to John von Neumann (1903-1957) in con-
nection with the developments of quantum mechanics. 
In this chapter, we shall illustrate the geometry of Hilbert spaces. In 
Section 10.2 we discuss the orthogonality principles, in particular the pro-
jection theorem and the abstract Dirichlet principle. Then, in Section 10.4 
we shall discuss the spectrum of compact operators partially generalizing to 
infinite dimensions the theory of finite-dimensional eigenvalues, see Chap-
ter 4. 
10.1 Hilbert Spaces 
A Hilbert space is a real (complex) Banach space whose norm is induced 
by an inner (Hermitian) product. 
10.1.1 Basic facts 
a. Definitions and examples 
10.1 Definition. A real (complex) linear space, endowed with an inner or 
scalar (respectively Hermitian) product { \ ) is called a pre-Hilbert space.

We have discussed algebraic properties of the inner and Hermitian products 
in Chapter 3. We recall, in particular, that in a pre-Hilbert space H the 
function 
xeH, 
(10.1) 
||a;|| := y/{x \ x), 
defines a norm on H for which the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, 
l(%)l < INI IMI 
yx,yeH, 
holds. Moreover, CamoVs theorem 
\\x + 2/lP = \\x\\^ + \\y\\^ + 2^{x\y) 
^x,y e H 
and the parallelogram law 
\\x + y\? + \\x-y\\^ 
= 2{\\x\\^ + \\y\\^) 
yx,yGH 
hold. In Chapter 3 we also discussed the geometry of real and complex 
pre-Hilbert spaces of finite dimension. Here we add some considerations 
that are relevant for spaces of infinite dimension. 
A pre-Hilbert space H is naturally a normed space and has a natural 
topology induced by the inner product. In particular, if {xn} C H and 
X e H, then Xn ^^ x means that ||xn — x|| = {xn — x\xn — x)^/^ ^ 0 as 
n -^ oo. As for any normed vector space, the norm is continuous. We also 
have the following. 
10.2 Proposition. The inner (or Hermitian) product in a pre-Hilbert 
space H is continuous on H x H, i.e., if Xn —^ x and yn —^ y in H, 
then {xn\yn) -^ {Ay)- -^^ particular, if {x\y) — 0 for all y in a dense subset 
Y of H, we have x = 0. 

10.1 Hilbert Spaces

Proof. In fact 
\iXn\yn) 
- ix\y)\ 
= \{Xn - x\yn) 
+ (x\yn 
- 
y)\ 
< | | a : n - x | | ||2/n||-h||x||||2/n-2/||; 
the claim then follows since the sequence ||2/n|| is bounded, since it is convergent. 
If y is a dense subset of H, we find for any x € // a sequence {yn} C Y such that 
yn -^ X. Taking the limit in (x | yn) = 0, we get (x | x) = 0. 
D 
10.3 % Differentiability of the inner product. Let u :]a, h[-^ H be a, map from an 
interval of R into a pre-Hilbert space H. We can extend the notion of derivative in this 
context. We say that u is differentiable at to €]a, b[ if the limit 
u - ( t o ) : = l i m ^ ( ^ ) - " ( ^ ^ ) e / f

+ {u{t)\v'{t)) 
Vt G]a,6[. 
10.4 Definition. A pre-Hilbert space H that is complete with respect to 
the induced norm, \\x\\ := y/{x\x), 
is called a Hilbert space. 
10.5 K. Every pre-Hilbert space //, being a metric space, can be completed. Show that 
its completion if is a Hilbert space with an inner product that agrees with the original 
one when restricted to H. 
Exercise 10.5 and Theorem 9.21 yield at once the following. 
10.6 Proposition. Every finite-dimensional 
pre-Hilbert space is com-
plete, hence a Hilbert space. In particular, any finite-dimensional subspace 
of a pre-Hilbert space is complete, hence closed. The closed unitary ball of 
a Hilbert space H is compact if and only if H is finite dimensional. 
10.7 Example. The space of square integrable real sequences 
oo 
h = hW 
:= [x = {xn} U n € M, ^ 
|xi|2 < oo} 
i = l 
is a Hilbert space with inner product {x \ y) := X^i^i^il/i' compare Section 9.1.2. 
Similarly, the space of square integrable complex sequences 
oo 
^2(C) := | x = {Xn} \xneC, 
"^ 
\Xi\'^ < Ooj 
i = l 
is a Hilbert space with the Hermitian product {x \ y) := X3Si ^iVi-

defines an inner product with induced norm ||/||2 := f /^ \j{i)Y' dt\ 
. As we have 
seen in Section 9.1.2, C^([a, 6]) is not complete with respect to this norm. Similarly 
1 
0 
defines in C^([0,1],C) a pre-Hilbert structure for which C^([0,1],C) is not complete. 
b. Orthogonality 
Two vectors x and y of a pre-Hilbert space are said to be orthogonal, and 
we write x ± y, if {x\y) = 0. The Pythagorean theorem holds for pairwise 
orthogonal vectors Xi, X2,..., Xn

A denumerable set of vectors {e^} is called orthonormal if {eh\ek) = Shk

10.1.2 Separable Hilbert spaces and basis 
a. Complete systems and basis 
Let H he a. pre-Hilbert space. We recall that a set E of vectors in H are 
said to be linearly independent if any finite choice of vectors in E are 
linearly independent. A set E C H oi linearly independent vectors such 
that any vector in if is a finite linear combination of vectors in E is called 
an algebraic basis of H. 
We say that a system of vectors {ea}aeA in ^ pre-Hilbert space H is 
complete if the smallest closed linear subspace that contains them is ff, or 
equivalently, if all finite hnear combinations of the {ca} are dense in H. 
Operatively, {ea}aeA C H is complete if for every x e H, there exists a 
sequence {xn} oi finite linear combinations of the Ca 's, 
cti,...,akeA 
that converges to x. ^ 
10.10 Definition. A complete denumerable system {cn} of a pre-Hilbert 
space H of linearly independent vectors is called a basis of H. 
b. Separable Hilbert spaces 
A metric space X is said to be separable if there exists a denumerable and 
dense family in X. Suppose now that if is a separable pre-Hilbert space, 
and {xn} is a denumerable dense subset of if; then necessarily {xn} is 
a complete system in H. Therefore, if we inductively eliminate from the 
family {xn} all elements that are linearly dependent on the preceding ones, 
we construct an at most denumerable basis of vectors {?/„} of H. Even 
more, applying the iterative process of Gram-Schmidt, see Chapter 3, to 
the basis {^/n}? we produce an at most denumerable orthonormal basis of 
H, thus concluding that every separable pre-Hilbert space has an at most 
denumerable orthonormal basis. The converse holds, too. If {cn} is an at 
most denumerable complete system in H and, for all n, Vn is the family of 
the linear combinations of ei, 62,..., Cn with rational coefficients (or, in 
the complex case, with coefficients with rational real and imaginary parts), 
then UnVn is dense in H. We therefore can state the following. 
10.11 Theorem. A pre-Hilbert space H is separable if and only if it has 
an at most denumerable orthonormal basis. 
^ Notice that a basis, in the sense just defined, need not be a basis in the algebraic 
sense. In fact, though every element in H is the limit of finite linear combinations 
of elements of {ca}, it need not be a finite linear combination of elements of {ea}. 
Actually, it is a theorem that any algebraic basis of an infinite-dimensional Banach 
space has a nondenumerable cardinality.

10.12 Example. The following is an example of a nonseparable pre-Hilbert space: 
the space of all real functions / that are nonzero in at most a denumerable set of 
points {ti} (varying with / ) and moreover satisfy J2if(^i)^ 
< ^^ with inner product 
(x \ y) = Yl^{^)y{^)^ 
the sum being restricted to points where x{t)y{t) / 0. 
10.13 Remark. Using Zorn's lemma, one can show that every Hilbert 
space has an orthonormal basis (nondenumerable if the space is nonsepara-
ble) ; also there exist nonseparable pre-Hilbert spaces with no orthonormal 
basis. 
Let iif be a separable Hilbert space, let {en} be an orthonormal basis 
on H and \ei Pn : H -^ H be the orthogonal projection on the finite-
dimensional subspace Hn := Span {ei, e2,..., en}- liL : H —^ Y is a linear 
operator from H into a linear normed space Y, set Ln{x) := LoPn{x)'ix 
E 
H. Since the LnS are obviously continuous, Hn being finite dimensional, 
and ||Lri(a;) — L(x)||y -^ 0 Vx G iJ, we infer from the Banach-Steinhaus 
theorem the following. 
10.14 Proposition. Any linear map L : H 
space into a normed space Y is hounded. 
Y from a separable Hilbert 
Therefore linear unbounded operators on a separable pre-Hilbert space 
L : D -^ Y are necessarily defined only on a dense subset D ^ H of SL 
separable Hilbert space. There exist instead noncontinuous linear operators 
from a nonseparable Hilbert space into E. 
10.15 Example. Let X be the Banach space CQ of infinitesimal real sequences, cf. 
Exercise 9.158, and let / : X ^ R be defined by / ( ( a i , a 2 , . . . ) ) •= «i- Then ker / =

so that {x^, e^, e^,... } is a linearly independent set in CQ. Denote by B a. Hamel basis

1, ker / is dense in co but clearly ker f ^ CQ. 
10.16 %. Formulate similar examples in the Hilbert space of Example 10.12. 
c. Fourier series and i2 
We shall now show that there exist essentially only two separable Hilbert 
spaces: £2 W and £2(C). 
As we have seen, if if is a finite-dimensional pre-Hilbert space, and 
(ei, e2,..., Cn) is an orthonormal basis of H^ we have 
n 
n 
X = ^{x\ej) 
Cj, 
\\x\\^ = ^ 
\{x\ej)\^. 
3=1 
3=1 
We now extend these formulas to separable Hilbert spaces. 
Let i? be a separable pre-Hilbert space and let {en} be an orthonormal 
set of H. For x E H^ the Fourier coefficients of x with respect to {cn} are 
defined as the sequence {(a:|ej)}j, and the Fourier series of x as the series 
(X) 
2^\x\ej)ej^ 
3=1 
whose partial n-sum is the orthogonal projection Pn{x) of x into the finite-
dimensional space Vn := Spanjei, 62,..., e^}, 
n 
Pn{x) = 
^{x\ej)ej. 
j = i 
Three questions naturally arise: what is the image of 
J^{x) := {{x\e^)}j, 
xGH? 
Does the Fourier series of x converge? Does it converge to x? The rest of 
this section will answer these questions.

and (iv) trivially implies (iii). 
Finally (iii) implies that x = 0 if {x\ek) = 0 Vfc.

- the inverse map of T, T~^ : £2 —> H, is given by 
0 0 
i=i 
Therefore, we can state the following. 

360 
10. Hilbert Spaces, Dirichlet's Principle and Linear Compact Operators 
10.20 Theorem. Every separable Hilbert space H over R (respectively 
over C) is isometric to ^2(R) (respectively to ^2(C)^. More precisely, given 
an orthonormal basis {en} C H, the coordinate map £ : (^2{^) -^ H 
(K = R if H is real, resp. K = C if H is complex), given by 
oo 
k=o 
is a surjective isometry of Hilbert spaces and its inverse maps any x G H 
into the sequence of the corresponding Fourier coefficients 
{{x\ej)}j. 
Finally, we conclude with the following. 
10.21 Theorem (Riesz-Fisher). Let H be a Hilbert space and let {cn} 
be an at most denumerable orthonormal set of H. Then the following state-
ments are equivalent. 
(i) {cn} is a basis of H. 
(ii) yx G H we have x = Sjli(^kj)^j-
(iii) ||x — Pri(^)|| -^ 0, where Pn is the orthogonal projection onto Vn := 
Span{ei, e2,..., Cn}. 
(iv) (PARSEVAL'S FORMULA or ENERGY EQUALITY) ||a:|| = Zljli l(^kj)P 
holds ^x e H. 
(v) (a:|2/) = E^i(x|e^)(2/|e^). 
(vi) if {x\ej) = 0 Vj then x = 0. 
Proof. The equivalences of (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and of (i) => (vi) were proved in 
Proposition 10.18. It remains to show that (vi) implies (i). Suppose that {cn} is not 
complete. Then there is y e H with ||t/|p > ^27^1 l(2/kj)Pj while, on the other hand, 
Bessel's inequality and Proposition 10.19 show that there is z e H such that z := 
J2'jLoiy\^j)^j 
1 and by Parseval's formula, ||2:|P = S ^ ^ i l(2/l^j)l^- Consequently ||2;|P < 
||2/|p. But, on account of the continuity of the scalar product

i^l^k) = (5Z(2/|ej)ej |efc) = X^(!/|ej)(ej |efc) = (y|efc) 
j = i 
j = i 
i.e., {y — z\ek) = 0 Vfc. Then by (vi) y = z, a. contradiction.

{x\y):= Jx{t)'^p{t)dt 
defines a Hermitian product on it. This way V^ is a pre-Hilbert space. Also, 
one easily sees that the monomials {f^} n > 0, are linearly independent; 
Gram-Schmidt's orthonormalization process then produces orthonormal 
polynomials {Pn{t)} of degree n with respect to the weight p. Classical

One can show that the polynomials {Jn}^ {^n}, {^n}, {Ln}, {^n} form

Denoting by {Rn} the system of orthonormal polynomials with respect 
to p{t) obtained by applying the Gram-Schmidt procedure to {f^}, n > 0, 
the i?n's have interesting properties. First, we explicitly notice the follow-
ing properties 
o (Al) for all n, Rn is orthogonal to any polynomial of degree less than n, 
o (A2) for all n the polynomial Rn{t) — tRn-i{t) 
has degree less than n, 
hence 
{tRn-l\Rn) 
= 
{Rn\Rn)^ 
o (A3) for all x,y^z eVp we have {xy\z) = {xy'z\l) = {x\yz). 
10.22 Proposition (Zeros of R^)* Every Rn has n real distinct roots 
in the interior of I.

Proof. Since / j Rn{t)p{t) dt = 0, it follows that Rn changes sign at least once in /. Let 
ti < • • • < tr be the points in int (/) in which Rn changes sign. Let us show that r = n. 
Suppose r < n and let 
Q(t):=(t-ti){t-t2)...{t~tr), 
then RnQ has constant sign, hence, {Rn\Q) 7^ 0, that contradicts property (Al).

and for i < n — 1, we have —(tRn-i\Ri)

By (A3), we have {tRn-i\Ri)

For i = n — 2, property (A2) shows that

10.2 The Abstract Dirichlet's 
Principle and Orthogonality 
The aim of this section is to illustrate some aspects of the linear geometry 
of Hilbert spaces mainly in connection with the abstract formulation of the 
Dirichlet principle. In its concrete formulation, this principle has played 
a fundamental role in the geometric theory of functions by Riemann, in 
the theory of partial differential equations, for instance, when dealing with 

364 
10. Hilbert Spaces, Dirichlet's Principle and Linear Compact Operators 
gravitational or electromagnetic fields and in the calculus of variations. 
On the other hand, in its abstract formulation it turns out to be a simple 
orthogonal projection theorem. 
a. The abstract Dirichlet's principle 
Let H he a. real (complex) Hilbert space with scalar (respectively Hermi-
tian) product ( | ) and norm \\u\\ := y/{u\u). Let K = R if ff is real or 
K := C if iJ is complex. Recall that a hnear continuous functional L on H 
is a linear map L : if —^ M such that 
\L{u)\ <K\\u\\ 
"iueH; 
(10.3) 
the smallest constant K for which (10.3) holds is called the norm of L, 
denoted ||L|| so that 
\L{u)\ < ||L||||i/||, 
^ueH, 
and, see Section 9.4, 
\L{u)\ 
\\L\\= 
sup \L{u)\ =sup-
inti=i 
u/0 
\m\ 
We denote by H* = C{H, K) the space of linear continuous functional on 
if, called the dual of H. 
10.27 Theorem (Abstract Dirichlet's principle). Let H be a real or 
complex Hilbert space and let L G if*. The functional T : H —^R defined 
by 
J^{u):=h\u\\'^-^{L{u)) 
(10.4) 
achieves a unique minimum point u in H, and every minimizing sequence, 
i.e., every sequence {uk} C H such that 
T{uk) -^ inf J^{v), 
converges ton in H. Moreover u is characterized as the unique solution of 
the linear equation 
{ip\u) = L{ip) 
\/(p e H. 
(10.5) 
In particular \\u\\ = ||L||. 
Proof. Let us prove that T has a minimum point. First we notice that T is bounded 
from below, since, recaUing the inequahty 2ah < a^ -f 6^, we have for dX\ v ^ H 
Hv) 
> \\\v\? 
- \\L\\ \\v\\ > i | H | 2 - i | H | 2 _ i | | L | p = - i | | L | | 2 e R, 
hence A := inf^^if ^(v) 
€ M. Then we observe that, by the parallelogram law.

Thus, if {txfe} is a minimizing sequence, by (10.6)

as h^k —^ oo. Therefore {uk} is a Cauchy sequence in H and converges to some u E H; 
by continuity T(uk) 
—> J^{u) hence J^{u) — A. This proves existence of the minimizer 
u. 
If {vk} is another minimizing sequence for .F, (10.6) yields ||wfc — "^fcll —^ 0? ^-nd this 
proves that the minimizer is unique and that every minimizing sequence converges to 
u in H. 
Let us show that u solves (10.5). Fix (f £ H, and consider the real function e —> 
J^(u + ec^), that is the second order polynomial in e 
J^(u + ev) = \M\\'' 
+ ^[W\u) - L(v)]e + ^ ( « ) 
with minimum point at e = 0. We deduce 3f?((v?|u) - L{ip)) = O^cp e H hence, as 2; = 0

{(f\u) - L{ip) = 0

Conversely, if v solves (10.5), then for every (p ^ H

hence ^(1; + (p) > T{y)^ Vv? G i/, i.e., i; is a minimum point for T in H. This proves 
that (10.5) has a unique solution, the minimum point w of .F : if —> M. Finally, we infer

b. Riesz's theorem 
In particular, we have proved the following. 
10.28 Theorem (Riesz). For every linear continuous functional L £ H* 
there exists a unique UL £ H such that 
L{ip) = {ip\uL) 
V(^ G H. 
(10.8) 
Moreover \\UL\\ = \\L\\. 
Actually, we have also proved that Riesz's theorem and the abstract Dirich-
let's principle are equivalent. 
10.29 Continuous dependence and Riesz's operator. If u solves 
the minimum problem (10.4), or equation (10.8), we have \\u\\ = \\L\\. 
This implies that the solution of (10.4) or (10.8) depends continuously 
on L. In fact, if Ln,L G H* and ||Ln - L|| -^ 0, and if Un,u e H solve 
{(p\un) = L{(p) and {(p\u) = L{(p) "iip G if, then 
hence 
{ip\Un -U) 
= {Ln - L){ip) 
W(p G H, 
^/|| = | | L n - L | | - . 0 . 
10.30 Riesz's operator. The map T : H* -^ H that associates to each 
L e H* the solution UL of (10.8) is called Riesz^s map. It is easily seen 
that r : H* -^ H is linear and by Riesz's theorem we have ||r(L)|| = 
\\UL\\ = ||L||, i.e., not only is F continuous, but 

10.2 The Abstract Dirichlet's Principle and Orthogonality 
367 
10.31 Theorem. Riesz's map T : H* -^ H is an isometry between H* 
and H. 
c. The orthogonal projection theorem 
Let us now extend the orthogonal projection theorem onto finite-dimen-
sional subspaces, see Chapter 3, to closed subspaces of a Hilbert space. 
Let H he a, Hilbert space and V a subspace of iJ. If / G if, then the 
map L : V -^ K, V -^ L{v) = {f\v) is a linear continuous operator on V 
with ||L|| < 11/11 since \{f\v)\ < \\f\\ \\v\\ Vv G F by the Cauchy-Schwarz 
inequality. Since a closed linear subspace F of a Hilbert space H is again 
a Hilbert space with the induced inner product, a simple consequence of 
Theorem 10.27 is the following. 
4. 
10.32 Theorem (Projection theorem). Let V be a closed linear sub-
space of a Hilbert space H. Then for every f £ H there is a unique point 
u eV 
of minimum distance from f, that is 
\\f-u\\ = dist (/, V) := inf {l/ 
-^\\^&V}. 
Moreover, u is characterized as the unique point such that f — u is orthog-
onal to V, i.e., 
(/ - u\ip) = 0 
\/(feV. 
Proof. We have for a\\ v e V \\v - fW^ = ||i;||2 - 2dl{v\f) + | | / | p . Theorem 10.27, when 
applied to J^(v) := H'ulP — 2^{f\v), 
v £V, 
yields existence of a unique minimizer u 
^V 
of ||t> — / I p , hence of i; —> ||v — /||. The characterization of u given by Riesz's theorem 
states, in our case, that u is also the unique solution of 
2{^\u) = 2Mf) 
Vcp G V. 
Let y be a subspace of a Hilbert space H. We denote by V-^ the class 
of vectors of H orthogonal to V 
v^ :=^xeH\ {x\v) = 0Wve vy 
Clearly V-^ is a closed subspace of H. 
10.33 Corollary. If V is a linear closed subspace of a Hilbert space H, 
then H = V ® V-^, i.e., every u £ H uniquely decomposes as u = v -\-w, 
where v £V and w G V-^. 
10.34 %. Show that, if V is a linear subspace of a Hilbert space //, then V-*- is closed 
and that (V-^)-^ is the closure of V. 

368 
10. Hilbert Spaces, Dirichlet's Principle and Linear Compact Operators 
10.35 %. Show that the orthogonal projection theorem is in fact equivalent to Riesz's 
theorem and, consequently, to the abstract Dirichlet's principle. [Hint: We give the 
scheme of the proof leaving it to the reader to add details. Uniqueness and ||WL|| = 11-^11 
follow from (10.8). Let us prove the existence of a solution of (10.8). Suppose L is not 
identically zero, then kerL = L~^({0}) is a linear closed proper subspace of H and 
there exists UQ G kerL"*- such that UQ ^ 0 and L{uo) = 1. Since u — L{u)uo € kerL 
Vix € //, we have 
u = w -{• L{u)uo 
with w € ker L and UQ E ker L . 
Multiplying by UQ, we then find L{u) = lu \ . ^^.^ )• 
d. Projection operators 
Let y be a linear closed subspace of a Hilbert space H. The projection 
theorem defines a linear continuous operator Py : H -^ H that maps 
f E H into its orthogonal projection Pyf G V; of course \\Pv\\ < 1 and 
Im(Py) = y. Also 
P^=Py0Py= 
Py 
and the formula H = V ^ V-^ can be written as 
Id = Py+Py±, 
PyPy±=Py±Py=0. 
For the reader's convenience, we only prove that Py{f + g) = Pv{f) 
+ 
Py{g). TVivially, f + g- Py{f + g) ± V and f + g - Pyf - Pyg ± V; 
since there is a unique u E V such that f + g — h _L F, we conclude 
Pvif + g) = Pv{f) + Pvi9). 
10.36 ^. Let P : H -^ H he a linear operator such that P^ = P. Then P is continuous 
if and only if ker P and Im P are closed. 
10.37 %, If y is a closed subspace of a Hilbert space H and {en} is a denumerable 
orthonormal basis of V, then the orthogonal projection of x G i/ is given by

10.3 Bilinear Forms 
Prom now on we shall only consider real vector spaces, though one could 
develop similar results for sesquilinear forms on complex vector spaces. 

10.3 Bilinear Forms 
369 
10.3.1 Linear operators and bilinear forms 
a. Linear operators 
Let i / be a real Hilbert space. As we know, the space C{H^ H) of linear 
continuous operators, also called hounded operators from H into i7, is a 
Banach space with the norm 
11^11='"-IF-
xT^o 
I F I I 
If T G C{H, H), we denote by N{T) and R(T) respectively the kernel and 
the image or range of T. Since T is continuous, N(T) = T~^({0}) is closed 
in H^ while in general R{T) is not closed. The restriction of T to N{T)-^, 
T : N{T)-^ —> R{T) is of course a linear bijection, therefore, from Banach's 
open mapping theorem, cf. Section 9.4, we infer the following. 
10.38 Proposition. Let T e C{H^H). Then T has a closed range in H 
if and only if there exists C > 0 such that \\x\\ < C||rx|| \/x e 
N{T)^, 
that is, if and only if T~^ : R{T) —> N{T)^ is a bounded operator, or, 
equivalently, if and only ifT : N{T)-^ -^ R{T) is an isomorphism. 
b. Adjoint operator 
Let X, y be two real Hilbert spaces endowed with their inner products 
( I )x and ( I )y, and let T G C{X, Y). For any y G F the map x -^ {Tx\y)Y 
is a linear continuous form on X, hence Riesz's theorem yields a unique 
element T*y ^ X such that 
(x|r*y)x - {Tx\y)Y 
Vx eX,\/ye 
y. 
(10.9) 
It is easily seen that the map T* : F ^^ X just defined is a linear operator 
called the adjoint of T. Moreover, from (10.9) T* is a bounded operator 
with ||r*|| = ||r||. Obviously, if 5',T G 
C{H,H) 
{TSy = S*T\ 
{Ty =T. 
10.39 %. Suppose that P : H —^ H is a. linear continuous operator such that P"^ — P 
and P* = P. Show that V := P{H) is a closed subspace of H and that P is the 
orthogonal projection onto V. 
An operator L : H —> H on a, Hilbert space H is called self-adjoint if 
T* = T, i.e., 
{x\Ty) = {Tx\y) 
^x,y e H. 
It follows from (10.9) that R{T)^ = N{T*). Consequently R{T) = 
N{T*)-^ and using the open mapping theorem, we conclude the following. 
10.40 Corollary. Let T G C{H,H) 
be a bounded operator with closed 
range. Then we have

10. Hilbert Spaces, Dirichlet's Principle and Linear Compact Operators 
(i) The equation Tx = y is solvable if and only if y -L N{T*), 
(ii) T is an isomorphism between N{T)^

Therefore, 
by considering the orthogonals, 
R{T) = (R(T)^)-^ 
=NiT*)^. 
(ii) follows from the open mapping theorem and (iii) follows from (i) by considering the 
projections onto N{T*)-^ and N{T*).

i.e., if and only if R{A) is 
closed, 
(iv) if R(A*A) 
is closed, then R(A*) and R(A) are closed. 
10.42 ^. Let H he a. Hilbert space and let T be a self-adjoint operator. Show that T 
is continuous. [Hint: Show that T has a closed graph.] 
c. Bilinear forms 
Let if be a real vector space. A map B : H x H ^ R which is Unear on 
each factor is called a bilinear form. A bilinear form B : H x H —^ R is 
called continuous or bounded if, for some constant A, we have 
|e(u,^)|<A||ti||||^|| 
^u.veH, 
and it is called coercive if there is A > 0 such that 
B{u,u)>\\\u\\^ 
\/ueH. 
Finally, B{u, v) is said to be symmetric if 
B{u, v) = B{v, u) 
Vu, V e H. 
Any linear operator T : H —^ H defines a bilinear form by 
B{v,u) := {v\Tu), 
and B is bounded if T is bounded since \B{v,u)\ < \\T\\ \\v\\ \\u\\. Con-
versely, given a continuous bilinear form B : H x H —^Ron a, real Hilbert 
space if, 
\B{u,v)\ <L\\u\\ \\v\\ 
\/u,ve 
if, 
(10.10) 
for any given u e H, the map v —> B{v, u) is a Unear continuous operator 
on H^ hence by Riesz's theorem, there exists Tu € H such that 
B{v, u) = {v\Tu) 
\fv e H. 
(10.11) 

10.3 Bilinear Forms 
371 
It is easy to see that T is linear and, from (10.10) that ||T|| < A since 
\\Tu\\^ = 
B{Tu,u)<A\\Tu\\\\u\\. 
Consequently, by (10.11), there is a complete equivalence between bihnear 
continuous forms on a real Hilbert space H and bounded linear operators 
from H into H. 
Also, by (10.11), coercive bilinear continuous forms correspond to 
bounded operators called coercive, i.e., such that for some A > 0 {u\Tu) > 
A||?i|P VIA G H. Moreover, self-adjoint operators correspond to bilinear 
symmetric forms, in fact 
I3{v,u) - B{u,v) = {v\Tu) - {u\Tv) = {v\{T - T*)u) 
^u^v e H. 
10.3.2 Coercive symmetric bilinear forms 
a. Inner products 
Clearly, every symmetric continuous coercive bilinear form on H defines in 
H a new scalar product, which in turn induces a norm that is equivalent 
to the original, since 
All^lP <B{u,u) 
<A\\u\\'^ 
^ueH. 
Replacing (u\v) with B{u,v), Dirichlet's principle and Riesz's theorem 
read as follows. 
10.43 Theorem. Let H be a real Hilbert space with inner product ( | ) 
and norm \\u\\ := ^/{u\ u) and let B : H x H ^ R be a symmetric, 
continuous and coercive bilinear form on H, i.e., B{u,v) = B{v,u) and for 
some A > A > 0 
\B{u,v)\ <A\\u\\\\v\l 
B{u,u) > A||u|p, 
"iu.v e H\ 
finally, let L be a continuous linear form on H. Then the following equiv-
alent claims hold: 
(i) (ABSTRACT DIRICHLET'S PRINCIPLE). The functional 
J'{u):=^B{u,u)-L{u) 
has a unique minimizer u £ H, every minimizing sequence converges 
to u, u in H,u 
solves 
B{ip,u) = L{ip) 
^^eH. 
(ii) (RIESZ'S THEOREM) The equation 
B{ip,u) = L{ip) 
\J^eH. 
(10.12) 
has a unique solution UL ^ H. 

372 
10. Hilbert Spaces, Dirichlet's Principle and Linear Compact Operators 
Moreover u = UL and \\UL\\ < ;^ll^ll-
The continuity estimate for UL follows from 
VX\\UL\\ < VB{UL,UL) = sup J § P = < -^\\L\\. 
In terms of operators Theorem 10.43 may be rephrased as follows. 
10.44 Theorem. Let T he a continuous, coercive^ self-adjoint operator 
on H, i.e., 
\\Tu\\ < \\T\\ \\u\l 
{u\Tu) > \\\uf, 
A > 0, VTX G F , 
T = T*. 
Then T is invertible with continuous inverse, and HT"-^!! < 1/A. 
Proof. From coercivity we infer that 
A | M | 2 < | ( n | T u ) | < | M | | | r « | | , 
(10.13) 
hence N(T) 
— {0} and T~^ 
: R{T) 
-^ H is continuous. T is therefore an isomor-
phism between H and R{T), and therefore R{T) is closed, R{T) = R{T) = N{T*)-^ 
= 
N{T)-^ = H and (10.13) rewrites as ||T-itx|| < ^||u|| \fueH. 
D 
A variational proof of Theorem 10.44- For any y e H, consider the bounded operator 
L: H ^R, 
L{ip) := {(f\y) and the bilinear form B : H x H 
-^R 
6{^,u):={if\Tu). 
B is bounded and symmetric, T being bounded and self-adjoint. Moreover, the coercivity 
implies that B{<<p^ u) is an inner product on H which induces a norm ^B{u^ u) equivalent

or Riesz's theorem. Theorem 10.43, we find x £ H such that 
MTx) 
= B{^,x)

that is, Tx = y. Finally, from the coercivity assumption we infer 
A | | x | | 2 < | ( x | T x ) | < | N | | | T x | | , 
that is, ||T||-i < ^.

b. Green's operator 
Given a bilinear form in a real Hilbert space as above, the Green operator 
associated to B is the operator Tjs ' H* -^ H that maps L G H* into 
the unique solution UL,B G i/ of B{^,UL^S) 
= L{^) V(/? G H. It is easily 
seen that Fg is linear and the estimate ||iiL,iB|| ^ j\\M\ ^^Y^ ^^^^ ^B is 
continuous. Of course, if F is the Riesz operator and T : H —^ H is an 
isomorphism such that B{v,u) = {v\Tu), then F^ = T~^ o F. 
10.45 %. Under the assumptions of Theorem 10.43, let K C H be a. closed convex set 
of a real Hilbert space. Show that 
(i) the functional T{u) has a unique minimizer u £ K^ 
(ii) u is the unique solution u £ K oi the variational 
inequality

c. Ritz's method 
The Dirichlet principle answers the question of the existence and unique-
ness of the minimizer of 
J^{u) := -B{u^u) — L{u) 
and characterizes such a minimizer as the unique solution of S(i;, UL) = 
L{v) Vf G H. But, how can one compute uiP. If i/ is a separable Hilbert 
space, there is an easy answer. In fact, since B{u, v) is an inner product, 
we can find a complete system in H which is orthonormal with respect to 
B, 
such that every u G H uniquely writes as u = Xljli ^i'^^^j)^j^ 
compare 
Theorem 10.20. If I3{(p,u) = L{ip), V(^ € H, then B{ej,u) = L{ej), thus 
we have the following. 
10.46 Theorem (Ritz's method). Let H be a separable real Hilbert 
space, B a symmetric coercive bilinear form, L e H* and {cn} a com-
plete orthonormal system with respect to B. Then L{v) = B{v,u) ^v e H 
has the unique solution 
oo 
3=1 
This, of course, allows us to settle a procedure that, starting from a 
denumerable dense set of vectors {xn}, computes a system of orthonormal 
vectors with respect to JB( , ) by the Gram-Schmidt method, and yields 
the approximations Xlj^i ^i^j) ^j ^f ^L-

d. Linear regression 
Let H,Y be Hilbert spaces and let A G C{H,Y). 
Given y e Y, we may 
find the minimum points u E H oi the functional 
T{u) := \\Au -yWlr 
u e H. 
(10.14) 
Prom the orthogonal projection theorem, we immediately infer the fol-
lowing. 
10.49 Proposition. Let A G £(i/, Y) be a bounded operator with closed 
range. Then the functional (10.14) has a minimum point u £ H and, if 
u E H is another minimizer of (10.14), then u — u£ N{A). Moreover, all 
minimum points are characterized as the points u e H such that An — y-L 
R{A) i.e., as the solutions of 
A*{Au-y) 
= 0. 
(10.15) 
If N{A) = {0}, as N{A) = N{A*A), 
(10.15) has a unique solution, 
u = {A*A)~^A*y. 
If N{A) ^ {0}, the minimizer is not unique, so it 
is worth computing the minimizer of least norm, equivalently the only 
minimizer that belongs to N{A)^, 
or the solution of 
| ^ * ( ^ ^ - ^ ) = ^' 
(10.16) 
Recall that, being R[^A) closed, the map A|JV(A)^ ~^ ^(^) is an isomor-
phism by the open mapping theorem. Consequently 
A+2/:= ( A | ^ ( ^ ) J . ) 
Qy, 
y 
eY, 
where Q is the orthogonal projection onto R{A), defines a bounded linear 
operator A^ :Y -^ H called the Moore-Penrose inverse of A. It is trivial 
to check that the solution u of (10.16) is u = A^y. 
In the simplest case, A/'(A*) = {0}, we have R{A) = Y and (10.15) is 
equivalent to solving Au = y. Since we want to find a solution in N{A)-^^ 
it is worth solving AA*z = y so that u = A'^y = A*{AA*)~^y. 
In general, however, both AA* and A*A are singular and, in order 
to compute A^y, we resort to an approximation argument. Consider the 
penalized functional 
Tx{u) := \\Au -yW^Y^^MlH

where A > 0, that we may also write as

is a symmetric, bounded, coercive, bilinear form on H, it follows from 
the abstract Dirichlet principle, Theorem 10.43, that Tx has a unique 
minimizer u\E H given by the unique solution of 
{ip\A''Aux)H + K^\UX)H 
= (v^|^*2/)i/ 
V(/? G H, 
i.e., 
{Xld + A*A)ux = A*y, 
(10.18) 
We also get, multiplying both sides of (10.18) by UA, 
X\\ux\\l + \\Aux\\l = {y\Aux)Y 
from which we infer the estimate independent on A 
P^Ally < ||y||y. 
(10.19) 
10.50 Proposition. Let A G C{H, Y) be a bounded operator with closed 
range and for A > 0, let 
ux := {Xld + A^'Ay^A^y 
e H, 
be the unique minimizer of (10.17). Then {ux} converges to A^y in H and 
\\(xid +A*AY^ -A^\

as X^ 0"^. 
Proof. Since R(A) is closed by hypothesis, there exists C > 0, such that 
II^^IIH < C | | A ^ | | y 
\/veN{A)^. 
(10.20) 
Since Xux = A*{y — Aux) G R{A*) C N{A)-^, we get in particular from (10.19) and 
(10.20) 
\\ux\\H<C\\Aux\\Y<C\\y\\Y, 
i.e., {ux} is uniformly 
bounded in H. 
Let A,/i > 0. Prom (10.18) we have 
-{Xux - fiu^) = A*A{ux - Uy) 
from which we infer 
\\A{ux - w/x)lly = (^A - u^j,\\ux - fiu^)Y

Taking into account (10.20) and the boundedness of the W/^'s we then infer 
I K - « M l l H < c 2 | | ^ K - « M ) l l y

that is, 
\\ux-u^\\H<'2C^\\y\\Y\\-ti\ 
(10.21) 
provided 20^ A < 1. 
For any {A^}, A^ —>^ 0"*", we then infer from (10.21) that {ux^} is a Cauchy sequence 
in Ar(A)-'-, hence converges to w € N{A)^. 
Passing to the Umit in (10.18), we also get 
A*{Au — J/) = 0, since {ux} is bounded, i.e., u := A'^y, as required.

10. Hilbert Spaces, Dirichlet's Principle and Linear Compact Operators 
10.3.3 Coercive nonsymmetric bilinear forms 
Riesz's theorem extends to nonsymmetric bilinear forms. 
a. The Lax-Milgram theorem 
As for finite systems of linear equations in a finite number of unknowns, 
in order to solve Tx = y, it is often worth first solving TT*x = y or 
T*Tx = T*y, since TT* and TT* are self-adjoint. We proceed in this way 
to prove the following. 
10.51 Theorem (Lax—Milgram). Let B{u,v) be a continuous and co-
ercive bilinear form on a Hilbert space H, i.e., there exists A > A > 0 such 
that 
\B{u,v)\ < K\\u\\\\v\\, 
B{u,u) > \\\u\\^ 
W,v e H. 
Then for all L G H* there exists a unique UL E H such that 
B{V,UL) 
= L{V) 
"iveH; 
(10.22) 
moreover \\UL\\ < 1/A||L||, i.e., Greenes operator associated to B, Ts * 
i/* -^ H, Tjs{L) := UL, is continuous. 
Proof. Let T : H —^ H he the continuous linear operator associated to B by 
B{v, u) = {v\Tu) 
Vti, V e H. 
The biUnear form 
_ 
B{u,v) := {TT*u \ v) = {T*u \ T*v) 
is trivially continuous and symmetric; it is also coercive, in fact, 
A^iHi^ < \B{u,u)\^ = \{u I r'«)|2 < ||«||2||r-«||2 = ||«|pB(«,«). 
Riesz's theorem. Theorem 10.43, then yields a unique UL £ H such that 
B{V,UL) 
=-L{v) 
"iveH. 
Thus UL := T*UL is a solution for (10.22). Uniqueness follows from the coercivity of 
B. 
D 
Equivalently we can state the following. 
10.52 Theorem. Let T : H —^ H be a continuous and coercive linear 
operator, 
\\Tu\\ < \\T\\ \\u\l 
{u\Tu) > X\\u\\^ 
^ueH 
where A > A > 0. Then T is infective and surjective; moreover its inverse 
T~^ is a linear continuous and coercive operator with ||T~^|| < A~^. 
10.53 % Show the equivalence of Theorems 10.51 and 10.52. 
10.54 %. Read Theorem 10.52 when H = M^; in particular, interpret coercivity in 
terms of eigenvalues of the symmetric part of the matrix associated to T. 

10.3 Bilinear Forms

b. Faedo-Galerkin method 
If if is a separable Hilbert space, the solution UL of the hnear equation 
(10.22) can be approximated by a procedure similar to the one of Ritz. 
Let if be a separable Hilbert space and let {en} be a complete orthonor-
mal system in H. For every integer A^, we define VN '-= Span {ei,..., e^v} 
and let P/v : H —> H he the orthogonal projection on VN and UN to be 
the solution of the equation 
B{^,UN) 
= L{^) 
y^eVN, 
(10.23) 
i.e., in coordinates, UN '-= Yli=i ^^^i where 
N 
J2B{ei,ej)x^ 
=L{ei), 
V2 = l,...,iV. 
3 = 1 
Notice that the system has a unique solution since the matrix B, B^j = 
B{ei,ej) has N linearly independent columns as S is coercive. 
10.55 Theorem (Faedo-Galerkin). The sequence {UN} converges to 
UL in H. 
Proof. We have 
X\\UN 
- I ^ L I P < B{uN 
-UL,UN 
-UL) 
= B{UN,UN) 
+ B{UL,UL) 
-B{UN,UL) 
-B{UL,UN) 
= B{UL,UL 
-UN), 
since B{UN,UL) 
= L(UN) = B(UN,UN)- 
It suffices to show that for every v? € / / 
B{(p,UN -UL)-^0 
as 
N-^oo. 
(10.24) 
We first observe that the sequence {UN} is bounded in H by ||L||/A since A||tt^|p < 
B{UN,UN) 
— L(UN) < \\L\\ ll^tivll- On the other hand, we infer from (10.22) that 
B{PN<P, UN -UL)=0 
^(peH, 
(10.25) 
hence 
B{(p, UN - UL) = B{ip - PN(P, UN -UL)-\- 
B(PN(f, UN - UL) 
= B{cp - PN^, UN - 
UL), 
and 
\B{ip,UN - UL)\ < A\\uN - ULW W^ - PN^W < 2-IILll \\if - PNM-
Then (10.24) follows since \\ip - PN<P\\ -^ 0 as N ^ OO.

10. Hilbert Spaces, Dirichlet's Principle and Linear Compact Operators 
10.4 Linear Compact Operators 
In Chapter 4 we presented a rather complete study of hnear operators 
in finite-dimensional spaces. The study of linear operators in infinite-
dimensional spaces is more complicated. As we have seen, several impor-
tant linear operators are not continuous, and moreover, linear continuous 
operators may have a nonclosed range: we may have {xk} C H, {yk} C Y 
such that Txk = yk.Vk -^ y ^Y, but the equation Tx = y has no solution. 
Here we shall confine ourselves to discussing compact perturbations of 
the identity for which we prove that the range or image is closed. We notice 
however, that for some applications this is not sufficient, and a spectral 
theory for both bounded and unbounded self-adjoint operators has been 
developed. But we shall not deal with these topics. 
10.4.1 Fredholm-Riesz-Schauder theory 
a. Linear compact operators 
Let if be a real or complex Hilbert space. Recall, cf. Chapter 9, 
10.56 Definition. A linear operator K : H -^ H is said to he compact if 
and only if K is continuous and maps hounded sets into sets with compact 
closure. The set of compact operators in H is denoted hy K{H^H). 
Therefore K : H -^ H is compact if and only if K is continuous and 
every bounded sequence {un} C H has a subsequence {uh^} such that 
K{uh^) converges in H. Also K{H,H) C C{H,H). Moreover, every linear 
continuous operator with finite range is a compact operator, in particular 
every linear operator on H is compact if H has finite dimension. On the 
other hand, since the identity map on H is not compact if dxmH = +oo, 
we conclude that )C{H^ H) is a proper subset of C{H, H) if dimiif = -hoo. 
Exercise 10.89 shows that compact operators need not have finite-
dimensional range. However, cf. Theorem 9.140, 
10.57 Theorem. 1C{H^ H) is the closure of the space of the linear con-
tinuous operators of finite-dimensional 
range. 
Proof. Suppose that the sequence of Unear continuous operators with 
finite-dimensional 
range {An} converges to A G C(H,H), 
\\An - A\\ -^ 0. Then by (i) Theorem 9.140 A 
is compact. Conversely, suppose that A is compact, and let B be the unit ball of H. 
Then A(B) has compact closure, hence for all n there is a 1/n-net covering A{B), i.e., 
there are points 2/i, 2/2, • • •, 2/iV G A{B), N = N{n), such that A{B) C UjL^B(yj, 
1/n). 
Define 
Vn := Span{2/1, 2/2,..., VN}, 
let Pn : H ^ Vnhe the orthogonal projection onto Vn and An := Pn^ A. Clearly each 
An has finite-dimensional range, thus it suffices to prove that \\An — A\\ -^ 0. 
For a\\ X £ B we find i € {1,2,..., iV} such that \\Ax — yi\\ < 1/n, hence, since 
PnVi = Vi and \\Pnz\\ < \\z\\,

10.58 Proposition. Let K G K{H,H). 
Then the adjoint K* of K is 
compact and AK and KA are compact provided A G C{H, H). 
Proof. The second part of the claim is trivial. We shall prove the first part. Let {un} C 
if be a bounded sequence, ||wn|| < M. Then {K*Un} is also bounded, hence 
{KK*Un} 
has a bounded subsequence, still denoted by {KK*Un}^ 
that converges. This implies 
that {K*Un} is a Cauchy sequence since 
\\K*Ui - K*Uj\\'' - {K*{ui - Uj)\K*{ui 
- Uj)) = {m - Uj\KK*{ui

b. The alternative theorem 
Let A G C{H^ H) be a bounded operator with bounded inverse. A linear 
operator T G C{H,H) 
of the form T = A + K, where K G 
K{H,H), 
is called a compact perturbation of A. Typical examples are the compact 
perturbations of the identity, T = Id + K, i^ G /C(if, H)^ to which we can 
always reduce T = A + K = A{IA^- 
A~^K). 
The following theorem, that we already know in finite dimension, holds 
for compact perturbations of the identity. It is due to Frigyes Riesz (1880-
1956) and extends previous results of Ivar Predholm (1866-1927). 

380 
10. Hilbert Spaces, Dirichlet's Principle and Linear Compact Operators 
10.59 Theorem (Alternative). Let H be a Hilbert space and let T = 
A-\- K : H -^ H be a compact perturbation of an operator A € C{H,H) 
with bounded inverse. Then 
(i) R{T) is closed, 
(ii) N{T) and N{T*) are finite-dimensional linear subspaces; moreover, 
dimiV(T)-dim7V(r*) = 0. 
The following lemma will be needed in the proof of the theorem. 
10.60 Lemma. LetT = ld-\-K be a compact perturbation of the identity. 
U {^n} C H is a bounded sequence such that Txn -^ y, then there exist a 
subsequence {xk^} of {xn} and x e H such that 
^kn ~^ ^ 
^^^ 
Tx = y. 
Proof. Since {xn} is bounded and K is compact, we find a subsequence {xk^} of {xn} 
and z £ H such that Kxk^ 
—^z.It 
follows that Xk^ = Tx^^ — Kx^^ 
-^ y — z =: x, 
and, since K is continuous, Txk^ —^ Tx = x -\- Kx = x — z = y. 
D 
Proof of Theorem 10.59. Since T = A-\-K = A{ld-\- A~^K)^ 
A has a bounded inverse, 
A~^K 
is compact, we shall assume without loss of generality that A = Id. 
Step 1. First we show that there is a constant C > 0 such that 
||a;||<C||Tx|| 
Vx€A^(T)-^. 
(10.26) 
Suppose this is not true. Then there exists a sequence {xn} C N{T)^ 
such that ||a:n|| = 
I and ||T(xn)|| —> 0. T{xn) -^ 0 and Lemma 10.60 yield a subsequence {x^^} 
of {xn) 
and X ^ H such that x^^ —^ x and Tx — 0. The first condition yields x G N{T)-^ 
and 
I I a; 11 = 1, while the second x € N{T). A contradiction. 
It follows from (10.26) that T is an isomorphism between the Hilbert space N(T)-^ 
and R{T), hence R{T) is complete, thus closed. This proves (i). 
Step 2. By Lemma 10.60 every bounded sequence in N{T) has a convergent subsequence. 
Riesz's theorem. Theorem 9.21, then yields that dimiV(T) < +oo. Similarly, one shows 
that dim Ar(T*) < oo. The rest of the claim is trivial if K is self-adjoint. Otherwise, we 
may proceed as follows, also compare 10.62 below. 
We use the fact that every compact operator is the limit of operators with finite-
dimensional range. Theorem 10.57. First we assume T = ld-\-K^ K of 
finite-dimensional 
range. In this case K : N{K)^ 
-^ R{K) is an isomorphism, in particular dim-R(i<r*) = 
dimN{K)-^ 
= dimR{K). 
Since T = Id -f i^, we have Ar(T) C R{K) and N{T*) 
C 
R(K), 
hence N(T) 
and N{T*) 
are finite-dimensional, and (ii) is proved. Let V := 
R{K) + R{K*). Trivially N{T), N{T*) C V and T and T* map V into itself. The rank 
theorem then yields 
dimN(T)=dimAr(T*). 
This proves the claim (ii) if K has finite-dimensional range. 
Step 3. Returning to the case K compact, by the approximation theorem, Theo-
rem 10.57, there is a linear continuous operator Ki with finite-dimensional range such 
that \\K - Kill < 1. If Q'.= Ki- 
K, the series T^'jLi Q^ converges in C{H, H) and 
oo 
(Id-(3)^Q^ = Id. 
j=\ 
In particular. Id — Q is invertible with bounded inverse S j i i Q^ - Therefore we can 
write 
T = ld +K= 
Id-Q 
+ Ki = {ld-Q){ld^{ld-Q)-^Ki)='.A{ld 
+ B) 
where B has finite-dimensional range; the claim (ii) then follows from Step 2. 
D 

10.4 Linear Compact Operators 
381 
c. Some facts related to the alternative theorem 
We collect here a few different proofs of some of the claims of the alternative 
theorem, since they are of interest by themselves. 
10.61 R{Id + K) is closed. As we know, this is equivalent to R{T) = 7V(T*)-^, i.e., 
to show that for every / 6 N{T*)-^ 
the equation Tu := u -\- K{u) = / is solvable. To 
show this, we can use Riesz's theorem. 
Given / € N{T*)^, 
we try to solve TT*v = / , i.e., 
h{^,v) = {^\v) 
WipeH, 
(10.27) 
where 
b{if,v) := (TT*v\ip) = 
{T*v\T*(p). 
liv e H solves (10.27), then u := T*v solves Tu = f. 
{Tu\<p) = (TT*v\ip) = b{v, if) = (/|(^), 
Wif e H. 
We notice that N{TT*) 
= N{T*), 
therefore the bilinear bounded form b{(p,v) is 
symmetric if H is real (sesquilinear if H is complex) and well defined on the Hilbert 
space N{TT*)-^. 
We claim that b((p,v) is coercive on 
N{TT*)-^, 
6((^,(^)>c||(p||2 
V(^eiV(TT*)-^. 
(10.28) 
Otherwise, there exists a sequence {e-n} C N{T*)-^ with ||en|| = 1 and 
b{en,en) = \\en + K*en\\^ 
-^ 0. 
By Lemma 10.60, there exists e ^ H and a subsequence {cfc^} of {e-n} such that 
efcn ^ e, 
Te = e + Ke = 0; 
in particular ||e|| = 1, e 6 N(T*) 
and e 6 N{T), 
a contradiction. We then conclude 
that b{(p, u) is an inner product on H (a Hermitian product if H is complex), equivalent 
to the original one. 
Applying Riesz's theorem, we then find v € N(T*)-^ 
such that 
b(ip,v) = (<p\f) 
^<peN(r)^, 
| | t ; | | < - | | / | | . 
(10.29) 
C 
It remains to show that v solves (10.27). If P is the orthogonal projection of H into 
A/'(T*), then (10.29) is equivalent to 
b{P^,v) 
= {P^\f) 
VvPG//. 
On the other hand, 
{if - Pcplf) = 0, 
b{ip - P^, v) = {ip- Pip\TT*v) 
= 0, 
since / and v are in iV(T*)-'-, hence b{ip,v) = b{Pip,v) = (P(p\f) — (v?|/). 
10.62 Another proof of dim ^ ( T ) = dim7V(T*). Step 1. Let us prove the equality 
if T or T* is injective. Let Hi := R{T) and, by induction Hjj^i 
:= T{Hj). 
Hj is a 
nonincreasing sequence of closed subspaces of H. We claim that there exists n such that 
Hri = Hn Vn > n. If not, we can find {sn} C R{H) with ||en|| = 1 and en € Hnr\H:^_^^. 
Since for n > m, T{en),T{em),e-n 
6 Hm+i, ^m G H;^^-^, and 
Ken - Kem = {en + Ken) - (em + Kem) - en + em -= z-\- em, 
we may infer 
\\Ken-Kem\\^

a contradiction, since {K{en)} 
has a convergent subsequence.

10. Hilbert Spaces, Dirichlet's Principle and Linear Compact Operators 
If N{T) = {0} and Hi = R{T) / //, then necessarily Hj^i 
^ Hj \/j since T is 
injective, and this is not possible, as we have seen. Hence H = R{T) and N{T*) 
= 
R(T)^ 
= {0}. 
If N{T*) — {0}, then repeating the above consideration for Id + i^* we get N{T) = 
{0}. 
Step 2. Let us prove that dim N{T) > dim R{T)-^. Assume that dim N(T) < dim R{T)-^. 
Then there exists a linear continuous operator L that maps the 
finite-dimensional 
space N{T) 
into the 
finite-dimensional 
space R{T)^ 
with L injective but not sur-
jective. Let us extend L as a linear operator from H to R{T)-^ 
by setting Lx = 0 
Va; G N(T)^. 
Then L has a finite-dimensional range, thus it is compact. Now we claim 
that N{ld + L-\- K) = {0}. In fact u -\- Ku + Lu = 0 implies Tu = u + Ku = 
-Lu 
and, since Tu e R{T) and Lu 6 R(T)-^, 
we infer Tu = Lu = 0, i.e., u 6 N{T) 
and 
u G N{T)^, 
since L is injective when restricted to N{T); in conclusion u = 0. Step 1 
then says that Id -h K + L is surjective. This is a contradiction, since the equation 
u -h Ku -{- Lu = V has no solution when u G R{T)-^, v ^ R{L). 
Step 3. Replacing K hy K* in the above proves that 
dimR{T)^ 
= dimN{T*) 
> dimR{T*)-^ 
= 
dimN{T), 
which completes the proof. 
10.63 Yet another proof of dim Ar(T) = dim N{T*). 
Let H he a. separable Hilbert 
space, T = ld-{-K he a. compact perturbation of the identity, and let {cj} be a complete 
orthonormal system for H, ordered in such a way that N{T) + N{T*) is generated by 
the first elements ei, 62,..., e^. 
Proposition. Let Vn = Span{ei, 62,..., en}, Pn be the orthogonal projection 
over 
Vn. Then there exists a constant 7 > 0 and an integer no such that Vn > no 
l|i'nr{<^)||>7ll¥'ll 
v<^ey„nJV(r)-L. 
Proof. Suppose the conclusion is not true; then for a sequence n^ ^ 
00 of vectors 
V?i € Vm n N{T)-^ we have 
\\Pn,T<pi\\-.0, 
\\^i\\ = l. 
(10.30) 
By Lemma 10.60 for a subsequence {^pk^} and if £ H we then have K(pk^ -^ —(p- Since 
PnX -^ X as n -^ 00, we infer 
\\Pn^.Kipk,+<p\\ 
< WPn^^Kifik.W -H \\Kifk, + c^ll - 0 
hence ipk^ -^ (p in H, since (pi = Pn^Tipi — PniK{(pi), 
and finally ^p H- K(p = 0. In 
particular ||(^|| = 1 and (p G N{T) D N{T)-^, a contradiction. 
D 
Prom the previous proposition, if {(^1, ip2,... •, (ps} is a. family of linearly indepen-
dent vectors, then PnT(ipi),..., 
PnT{(ps) are also linearly independent, at least for n 
large enough; on the other hand, since R{T) = 7V(T*)-L, the vectors PnT((^i), •.., 
PnT{(ps) belong to PnR{T) = Vn n Ar(T*)-^. Hence we have 
dimVnnN{T*)-^ 
>dimVnnN{T)-^ 
for n large enough. Similarly one proves dim^n n N{T)-^ > dimVn H N{T*)^, 
hence 
dimVnnAr(T)-^ 
=dimVnriN{T*)-^ 
for n large enough. The claim then follows by considering the orthogonal complements. 

10.4 Linear Compgict Operators

d. The alternative theorem in Banach spaces 
The alternative theorem generaUzes to the so-called Predholm operators between Banach 
spaces X and Y of which compact perturbations of the identity are special cases. 
Let X be a real Banach space on K = R or K = C and X* := C{X,K) 
its dual 
space, which is a Banach space with the dual norm 
| M | = 
sup Mx)l 
Vc/PGX*. 
\\x\\ = l 
U (f e X* and x E X, we often write < (f^x > for ^{x). Clearly, the bilinear map 
< , >: X* X X —)• K, defined by < ip,x >= (f(x), is continuous, 
| < < ^ , x > | < | | ¥ > | | | | x | | 
\/v€X',yx€X. 
In general, X* is not isomorphic to X, contrary to the case of Hilbert spaces. If X 
and Y are Banach speices and if T : X —^ y is a linear bounded operator, the dual or 
adjoint operator T* :Y* -^ X* is defined by 
< T*((^),x > : = < if.Tx 
> . 
(10.31) 
T* is continuous and ||T*|| = ||T||. 
10.64 %, Let T G C{H, H), where H is a. Hilbert space. We then have two notions of 
adjoint operators: as the operator T* : H -^ H in (10.9) Chapter 10 and as the operator 
T^: H* ^ H* defined in (10.31). Show that, ii G : H* ^ H is Riesz's operator, then 
T = G-^ oT* 
oG. 
For a subset y C X of a Banach space X, we define 
V-L .= 1^ ^ X* I <ip,x>=0\/xe 
V^ 
called the annihilator of V. Notice that V-^ is closed in X*. We have 
10.65 Lemma. Let T : X -^ X be a bounded linear operator.Then 
N{T*) = 
R{T)-^, 
R{T*) = 
N{T)-^. 
The class of linear compact operators on a Banach space, denoted by /C(X, X) 
is a closed subset of C{X,X). 
But in general these operators are not limits of linear 
operators with 
finite-dimensional 
range, contrary to the case X = H, where if is a 
Hilbert space as shown by a famous example due to Lindemann and Strauss. Recall 
that we can always approximate K € /C(X, X) by nonlinear 
operators with range 
contained in a finite-dimensional subspace, see Theorem 9.140. We can now state, but 
we omit the proof, the following result. 
10.66 Theorem (Alternative). Let X be a Banach space and letT = A-\-K 
: X -^ 
X be a compact perturbation 
of an isomorphism 
A : X —^ X. 
Then 
(i) R{T) is closed, 
(ii) N{T) and N(T*) 
have finite dimension, 
and dimN{T) 
= 
dimN{T*). 
Consequently, we have the following. 
10.67 Corollary (Alternative). Let A,K^ 
C{X,X) 
where A is a linear 
isomor-
phism of X and K is compact. Then the equation Ax + Kx = y is solvable if and only 
ifyeNiT*)-^.

10. Hilbert Spaces, Dirichlet's Principle and Linear Compact Operators 
e. The spectrum of compact operators 
10.68 Definition. Let H be a Hilbert space on K, K = R or K = C^ and 
let L G C{H, H) be a bounded linear operator on H. The resolvent p{L) of 
the operator L is defined as the set 
p{L) = < A G K (Aid — L)~^ is a bounded operator^ 
and its complement cr{L) = K \ p{L) is called the spectrum of L. 
By the open mapping theorem 
cr(L) := < A G K Aid — 1/ is not injective or surjective >. 
(10.32) 
10.69 Definition. Let L G C{H,H). 
Then the pointwise spectrum of L 
is defined as 
(Jp{L) := IXeKlXld 
— L is not injective>. 
The points in (Jp{L) are called eigenvalues of L, and the elements of 
A^(AId — L) are called the eigenvectors of L corresponding to A. 
Of course, crp(L) C cr(L) and, if dimi/ < +00, crp(L) = a{L) as, in 
this case, a linear operator is injective if and only if it is surjective. If 
dimiJ = -hoo, there exist, as we know, linear bounded operators which 
are injective but not surjective, hence, in general (Tp{L) ^ CF{L). 
10.70 Remark. In the sequel we shall deal with compact operators L. For 
these operators the equahty crp(L) = a{L) also follows from the alternative 
theorem of the previous section. 
As in the finite-dimensional case, see Proposition 4.5, eigenvectors cor-
responding to distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent. Moreover 
a ( L ) c { A G K | | A | < | | L | | } , 
(10.33) 
because, if |A| > ||L||, then \\\L\\ 
< 1, therefore, see Proposition 9.106, 
Id-\- JL, equivalently XId -h L, is invertible and 
00 
{Xld + L)-i = ^ ( - l ) ^ A ^ - ^ L ^ 
j=o 
hence A G p{L). 
The following theorem gives a complete description of the spectrum of 
a linear compact operator. 

10.4 Linear Compact Operators 
385 
10.71 Theorem. Let H be a Hilbert space with dimH 
= +oo and let 
K G /C(JF/', H) he a compact operator. Then 
(i) 0 G cj{K), 
(ii) K has either a finite number of eigenvalues or an infinite sequence 
of eigenvalues that converges to 0. 
(iii) the eigenspaces corresponding to nonzero eigenvalues have finite di-
mension, 
(iv) if X ^ 0 and A is not an eigenvalue for K, then XId — K is an 
isomorphism of H and {XId — K)~^ is continuous, 
(v) a{K)\{0} 
= 
ap{K)\{0}. 
Proof, (i) In fact R{K) ^ i/, since K is compact. 
(ii) Prom (10.33) the set of eigenvalues A is bounded, thus either A is finite or A has an 
accumulation point. Let us prove that in the latter case, A has only 0 as an accumulation 
point; we then conclude that A is denumerable, actually a sequence converging to zero. 
Suppose {An} is a sequence of nonzero eigenvalues with corresponding eigenvectors 
{un} such that An —>^ A 7«^ 0. Set fin '= 1/An and Vn := Span{iti, U2,..., 
Wn}, and 
notice that, if w := ^2^=1 ^j'^j G Vn, then XnW — Kw = J2]=i Cj{Xn — Xj)uj € 
Vn-i-
We now construct a new sequence {vn} with \\vn\\ = 1 by choosing vi € Vi and, for 
n > 2, t;n G K i f l V ^ j . Clearly Vn is an eigenvector corresponding to An and, according 
to the previous remark, Vn — fXnKvn G Vn-\- 
For n > m we then find Vn — jjinKvn, 
HmKvm G Vn-1, Vn G V^_^ and 
K{flnVn 
- fJ'mVm) = Vn - {Vn - fJ'uKVn + HmKVm) 
= : Vn - Z, 
with Vn G Vj^^i and z G Vn-i. 
Thus we conclude 
\\K(flnVn) 
- K{flmVm)\\^ 
= \\Vn\\^ + \\z\\^ > 1, 
a contradiction, since {fXnUn} is bounded and K is compact. In conclusion A = 0. 
(iii), (iv) are part of the claims of the alternative theorem, and (v) follows from (iv). 
D 
10.72 Remark. Actually, Theorem 10.71 holds under the more general 
assumption that if is a Banach space. In this case it is known as the 
Riesz-Schauder theorem. 
10.4.2 Compact self-adjoint operators 
Let us discuss more specifically the spectral properties of linear self-adjoint 
operators. 
a. Self-adjoint operators 
10.73 Proposition. Let H be a real Hilbert space and L : H -^ H he a 
bounded self-adjoint linear operator. Set 
m := inf {Lu\u), 
M := sup {Lu\u). 
\u\ = l 
\u\=l 
Then 

386 
10. Hilbert Spaces, Dirichlet's Principle and Linear Compact Operators 
(i) eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal, 
(ii) m,M 
e 
(T{L), 
(iii) ||L|| = supji^ii^i \iu\Lu)\ = max(|m|, |M|). 
Also, if L is a bounded self-adjoint operator in a complex Hilbert space, 
then {u\Lu) G R^u 
e H, consequently all eigenvalues are real, moreover 
(i), (ii) and (iii) hold. 
Proof, (i) In fact Lu — \u and Lv = jiv^ X,/I£R,X^/J, 
yield 
(A - /i)(w I v) = {Lu \v)-{u\ 
Lv) = 0. 
We now prove that for all u G H 
\\Mu - Lu\\ < \(Mu - Lu\u)\^/^, 
\\mu - Lu\\ < \{mu - Lu\u)\^^'^. 
(10.34) 
The bilinear form b{u,v) := (Mu — Lu\v) is symmetric and nonnegative, h{u,u) > 0; 
the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality then yields 
\{Mu - Lu\v)\ < \{Mu - Lu\u)\^/^\{Mv 
- Lv\v)\^^'^ < C\{Mu - 
Lu\u)\^/^\\v\l 
By choosing v = Mu — Lu, the first of (10.34) follows. A similar argument yields the 
second of (10.34). 
(ii) Let us prove that M G o-{L); similarly one proves that m 6 ciL). 
Let {u^} be a 
sequence such that \\uk\\ = 1 and {Luk\uk) 
—>• M. Because of (10.34) Muk — Lu^ -^ 0 
in H. If M is in the resolvent, then Mu — Lu is one-to-one and onto with continuous 
inverse because of the open mapping theorem. Thus 
Uk := (Mid - L)-'^{Muk 
- Luk) -^ 0, 
that contradicts \\uk\\ = 1. 
(iii) Set a := supij^ij^^i |(Lit|u)|; of course max(|M|, |m|) = a and a < \\L\\. Let us 
show that ||L|| < a. Since L is self-adjoint 
4U{Lu\v) = {L(u + v)\u + v) - {L{u - v)\u - v), 
hence, according to the parallelogram law, 
4\(Lu\v)\ < a{\\u + v\\^ + \\u~ vlf) 
= 2a(\\u\f 
+ | H p ) . 
Replacing u and v with eu, v/e respectively, e > 0, we find 
) = 4a|HIIH|.

In the

£2 
i.e.. 
{Lu\u) = {u\L*u) = (u\Lu) = {Lu\u) 
hence {Lu\u) 6 M. We leave to the reader the completion of the proof. 
D 
We notice that the proof of (iii) Proposition 10.73 uses the continuity 
of (Mid - L)~^ when M E p{L). If L is compact, this is a consequence 
of the alternative theorem and the open mapping theorem is not actually 
needed. 

10.4 Linear Compact Operators 
387 
10.74 Corollary. Let L : H ^^ H be a linear compact self-adjoint opera-
tor. Then there exists an eigenvalue X of L such that \\L\\ = |A|. 
Proof. If L = 0, then A = 0 is an eigenvalue. If L / 0, then ||L|| = max(|m|, \M\) ^ 0 
and M,m £ cr{L). Assuming ||L|| — |M|, then M ^Q and, according to Theorem 10.71, 
M G o-p{L), i.e., M is an eigenvalue of L. 
Alternatively, we can proceed more directly as follows. Let {un} be a sequence 
with ||txn|| = 1 such that {Lun\un) -^ M\ then {Mun — Lun\un) 
—>• 0, and by (10.34) 
Mun — Lun —> 0 in i/. Since L is compact, there is u £ H and a subsequence u^^ of 
{un} such that Uk^ -^ u hence 
Mu-Lu 
= 0, 
IN| = l, 
i.e., M is an eigenvalue for L. 
D 
b. Spectral theorem 
10.75 Theorem (Spectral theoremi). Let H be a real or complex 
Hubert space and K a linear self-adjoint compact operator. Denote by W 
the family of finite linear combinations of eigenvectors of K corresponding 
to nonzero eigenvalues. Then W is dense in N{K)-^. In particular, N{K)-^ 
has an at most denumerable orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of K. If Pj 
is the orthogonal projection on the eigenspace corresponding to the nonzero 
eigenvalue \j, then 
oo 
K = ^\jPj 
inC{H,H). 
j=i 
Proof. We order the nonzero eigenvalues as 
X.^Xj 
f o r i ^ j , 
| A i | > | A 2 | > | A 3 | > . . . 
and set Nj := N(Xj Id — K) for the finite-dimensional eigenspace corresponding to Aj. 
According to Proposition 10.73 
Nj ± Nk 
for j ^ k 
and 
N{K) ± Nj Vj, 
hence N{K) C W-^. To prove that W is dense in N{K)-^, 
it suffices to show that 
W = N{K)^ 
or W-^ = N{K). 
Define 
Wn= { 
{0} 
if K has no nonzero eigenvalues, 
uy^j^TVj 
if K has at least n nonzero eigenvalues, 
Wp 
if K has only p < n nonzero eigenvalues 
and Vn := W^. Trivially W-^ = DnVn. Notice that, since K is self-adjoint K{W^) 
C 
W^ if K{Wn) C Wn and the linear operator K\Y^ € C{Vn,Vn) is again compact and 
self-adjoint. Moreover, the spectrum of K^y^ is made by the eigenvalues of K different 
from {Ai, A2,..., An}. Therefore by Corollary 10.74 
\\T^

J l^^+il 
i^ ^ ^ ^ ^* least n -h 1 eigenvalues, 
. 
. 
\\^\Vn\\ = \ 
(10.35) 
I 0 
otherwise. 
If K has a finite number of eigenvalues, then V = V^ and (10.35) yields K{Vn) = 
{0}, i.e., y = HrCiV(T). 

388 
10. Hilbert Spaces, Dirichlet's Principle and Linear Compact Operators 
If K has a denumerable set {An} of eigenvalues, then |An| —> 0 by Theorem 10.71, 
hence 
| | ^ | v | | < | | K | v „ | | = | A n + l | - 0 
and K{V) 
= {0}, i.e., V C N(K). 
Choosing an orthonormal set of eigenvectors in 
each eigenspace Nj, we can produce an orthonormal system {en} of eigenvectors of K 
corresponding to nonzero eigenvalues, i.e., such that 
(6i \€j J = Oij , 
J\€j 
^= Aj €j , 
that is complete in the closure W = N{K)^ 
of W. 
Let us prove the last part of the claim. Let Pj and Qn be the orthogonal projections 
respectively, on Nj and Wn- Since the eigenspaces are orthogonal, we have K{Qn{x)) 
= 
Yl]=i ^jPjix) 
\fx e H, hence 
n 
KX-J2

j = l

n 
Kx-Y^XjPj{x)\\<\\K^v^\\\\x-Qn{x)\\<\Xn+i\\\x^

\K-^\jPj\\<\Xn+i\; 
the conclusion then follows since |An|—^Oasn—>^oo. 
• 
c. Compact normal operators 
A linear bounded operator T G C{H^ H) in a complex Hilbert space H is 
called normal if T*T = TT*. It is easy to show that if T is normal, then 
(i) N(T) = N{T*T) = N{TT*) = N{T*), 
(ii) N{T - Aid) = A^(T* - Aid), 
that is, T and T* have the same eigenspaces and conjugate eigenvalues. 
If T is normal, the operators 
A:= 
Z 
, 
B:= 
2 
' 
2i 
are self-adjoint and commute, AB = BA. 
Two linear compact self-adjoint operators that commute have the same 
spectral resolution^ see Theorem 4.29 for the finite-dimensional case. 
10.76 Theorem. Let H he a complex Hilbert space and A,B two linear 
compact self-adjoint operators in H such that AB = BA. Then there exists 
a denumerable orthonormal system {e^} which is complete in {N(A) D 
N{B))-^ and made by common eigenvectors of A and B. If Xj and fij are 
respectively, the eigenvalue of A and the eigenvalue of B relative to Cj, and 
Pj : H -^ H is the orthogonal projection onto Span{ej}, PjX := {x\ej)ej,

Proof. Let V^ be as in Theorem 10.75. As in the finite-dimensional case, see Proposi-
tion 4.27, for every eigenvalue A of A we find a basis of the corresponding eigenspace 
Ar(AId — A) made by eigenvectors of B. By induction we then find a denumerable 
orthonormal system which is complete in W and made of common eigenvectors {e-n} 
of A and B. By Theorem 10.75 then W = N{A)-^ and {cn} is a basis of N{A)-^ of 
common eigenvectors of A and B. Now AB = BA implies that B(N{A)) 
C N{A). 
Therefore, applying the spectral theorem to -B|;v(A)5 we find further eigenvectors {un} 
of B corresponding to nonzero eigenvalues that form a basis of N(A) n N{B)-^. 
The 
family {en} U {un} is now a denumerable orthonormal set of eigenvectors common to 
A and B that is complete in (N{A) D N{B))-^. 
The second part of the claim easily follows by applying Theorem 10.75 to A and 
B. 
D 
10.77 Corollary. Let H be a complex Hilbert space and let T : H -^ H 
be a compact normal operator. Then there exists a denumerable basis {cn} 
in H of common eigenvectors of T and T*. // Pj denotes the orthogonal 
projection on Spanjcj} and Xj is the corresponding eigenvalue, then 
T = £ A,P„ 
T* = £ A,P„ 
in C{H,H). 
j = i 
j=i 
Proof. Set A := (T -h T*)/2 and B := {T - T*)/{2i). 
We can apply Theorem 10.76 
and find a basis {en} in (N(A) niV(B))-^, i.e., a basis in ker(T)-^ = ker(T*)-^ made by 
common eigenvectors to T = A-\-iB 
and T* = A — iB.

10. Hilbert Spaces, Dirichlet's Principle and Linear Compact Operators 
d. The Courant-Hilbert-Schmidt theory 
In several instances one is led to discuss the existence and uniqueness of 
solutions in a Hilbert space H of equations of the type 
a((^, u) - \k{^, u) = F{ip) 
^ipeH 
(10.36) 
where F G i/*, and a{(f,u)^ k{(f^u) are bounded bilinear forms in H. As 
we have seen, by Riesz's theorem, there exist bounded operators 
A,Ke 
C{H, H) and / G if such that 
a((p, u) := {ip\Au), 
k{ip, u) := {ip\Ku), 
F{ip) = {ip\f) 
ioT all u^(p e H. Then (10.36) reads equivalently as the linear equation in 
H 
{A - \K)u = /. 
(10.37) 
With the previous notation suppose that 
— A is continuous, self-adjoint and coercive on i/, i.e., there exists u > 0 
such that 
a{u,u)>iy\\u\\^ 
\/ueH, 
(10.38) 
— K is compact, self-adjoint and positive, i.e., 
k{u, u) = {u\Ku) > 0 
yu:j^O, ueH, 
(10.39) 
With these assumptions, the corresponding bilinear forms are continu-
ous and symmetric; moreover a{v, u) defines an inner product in H equiv-
alent to the original one {v\u) since 
V \\u\^ < a{u,u) < 
\u 
|2 
Finally, see Theorem 10.44, A has a continuous inverse. The operator A — 
XK is therefore a compact perturbation of an isomorphism, and, since A 
and K are self-adjoint, the alternative theorem yields the following. 
10.78 Theorem. The equation An -h XKu = f has a solution if and only 
if f is orthogonal to the solutions of An — XKu = 0. 
Now we want to study the equation 
An - XKu = 0 
equivalently, 
a{ip, u) — Xk{(p, u) = 0 
"iif e H, 
which can be rewritten as 
\u - A-^Ku = 0. 
A 
With the assumptions we have made 
o A~^K is a linear compact operator.

o A ^K is self-adjoint with respect to the inner product a{v,u), since 
a{v,A-^Ku) 
= {v\Ku) = {u\Kv) = 
a{u,A-^Kv), 
10.79 Definition. We shall say that X ^ 0 is an eigenvalue of (A^K) 
and that u is a eigenvector of {A^K) corresponding to A if 1/A is an 
eigenvalue of A~^K and u is a corresponding eigenvector, i.e., a solution 
ofAu-XKu 
= 0. 
The theory previously developed, when applied to the self-adjoint com-
pact operator A~^K in the Hilbert space H with the inner product a(i;, u), 
yields the following. 
10.80 Theorem. Let H he an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and let 
A and K G C{H^ H) he self-adjoint, for A coercive and K compact. The 
equation Au—XKu = 0 has zero as its unique solution except for a sequence 
{An} of positive real numhers such that Xn -^ -hoc. For any such Xn, the 
vector space of solutions ofAu—XnKu 
— 0 is finite dimensional. Moreover, 
ifW 
is the family of finite linear combinations of eigenvectors of {A^K), 
then W is dense in H. In particular, there exists a complete orthonormal 
system in H of eigenvectors of (A, K) such that 
aici, Cj) = Xj6ij, 
k{ei, ej) = 6ij 
Vi, j . 
Proof. The eigenvalues of A~^K 
are positive since A~^K 
is positive. Since A~^K 
is 
compact, A~^K 
has a denumerable sequence of eigenvalues {jjin} and /Xn -^ 0"^ and 

392 
10. Hilbert Spaces, Dirichlet's Principle and Linear Compact Operators 
the corresponding eigenspaces are finite dimensional by Theorem 10.71. Consequently 
Au — XKu = 0 has nonzero solutions for the sequence An = l/fJ^n —^ -f-oo. The spectral 
theorem yields the density of W in H and the existence of an orthonormal basis of 
A~^K 
with respect to the inner product a{v^ it), 
a{ui,Uj) = Sij, 
—Uj — A~ Kuj = 0. 
Therefore, a{ui,Uj) = Sij, \jk(ui,Uj) 
= a(ui,Uj) 
= Sij and, if we set Sj := y/^Uj, 
we 
conclude

e. Variational characterization of eigenvalues 
10.81 Theorem. Let H, A and K he as in Theorem 10.80. Let {en} 
he a hasis in H of eigenvalues of {A^ K) ordered in such a way that the 
corresponding eigenvalues A^ form a nondecreasing sequence {An}, An < 
An-f 1. Then each An is the minimum of the Rayleigh's quotients 
.

Moreover with the previous notation and assumptions, we have the

11. Some Applications 
In this chapter we shall illustrate some of the applications of the abstract 
principles we stated in the previous chapter to specific concrete problems. 
Our aim is to show the usefulness of the abstract language in formulating 
and answering specific questions, identifying their specific characteristics 
and recognizing common features of problems that a priori are very differ-
ent. Of course, the abstract approach mostly follows and is motivated by 
concrete questions, but later we see the approach as the most direct way 
to understand many questions, and even the most natural. 
Clearly, the problems we are going to discuss deserve more careful and 
detailed study because of their relevance, but this is out of our present 
scope and, in any case, often not possible because of the limited topics 
we have so far developed. For instance, in this chapter, we shall only use 
uniform convergence, since the use of integral norms, besides being more 
complex, requires the notion of Lebesgue's integration, without which any 
presentation would sound artificial. 
11.1 Two Minimum Problems 
11.1.1 Minimal geodesies in metric spaces 
Let X be a connected metric space so that every two of its points can be 
connected by a continuous path. One of the simplest problems of calculus 
of variations is to find a continuous curve of minimal length connecting 
two given points. A first question is deciding when such a minimal con-
nection exists. Here, we shall see how the Frechet-Weierstrass theorem. 
Theorem 6.24, and the Ascoli-Arzela theorem. Theorem 9.48, lead to an 
answer. 
a. Semicontinuity of the length 
Let X be a metric space. Recall that / : X —> K is called lower semi-
continuous if the level sets Tf^x := {x \ f{x) < A} of / are closed for all 
A G R, equivalently if /~^(]A, +oo[) is open for all A € R. Observing that,

if f = sup^ fi, then / ^(]A, +oc[) = U^/^ ^(]A, 4-oo[), we conclude the fol-
lowing. 
11.1 Proposition. Let fi : X -^ R, i e I, be a family of lower semi-
continuous functions on a metric space X. Then f := sup^fi is a lower 
semicontinuous 
function. 
Let (X, of) be a metric space. As we have seen, cf. Example 6.25, the 
length functional L : C^([a, 6],X) -^ R, which for each continuous curve 
(p : [a, 6] -^ X gives its length, is not a continuous functional with respect 
to uniform convergence in C°([a, 6],X). But we have the following. 
11.2 Theorem (Semicontinuity). The length functional L{(p) is lower 
semicontinuous in C^([a, 6],X). 
Proof. Recall that we have 
L{ip) = sup Vs if) 
ses 
where Vs{f) 
:= T>idx{f{ti)J{ti+i)), 
S = {to = a < ti < - - • < IN = b}. Since the 
functional / -^ Vsif) 
is continuous for every fixed subdivision S of [a, 6], the result 
follows. 
• 
b. Compactness 
The intrinsic reparametrization theorem. Theorem 7.44, can be reformu-
lated as: For every family of parametric curves {Ci} in X of length strictly 
less than A:, there exists a family of curves {C^'} parametrized in [0,1], 

11.1 Two Minimum Problems 
397 
thus belonging in C^([0,1],X), such that Ci and (7^' are equivalent for all 
i e Lin particular they have the same length, and the curves C^ are equi-
Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant less than k. Assuming X compact, the 
Ascoli-Arzela theorem yields the following. 
11.3 Theorem (Compactness). Let X be a compact metric space and 
let {Ci} be a family of parametrized curves of length strictly less than k. 
Then the family {Ci} is relatively compact with respect to uniform conver-
gence. More precisely, one can reparametrize the curves Ci on [0,1] in such 
a way that they belong to Lipfc([0,1],^), and therefore {Ci} is a relatively 
compact subset of 
C^{[0,1],X). 
c. Existence of minimal geodesies 
An immediate consequence of Theorems 11.2 and 11.3, on account of the 
Prechet-Weierstrass theorem is the following. 
11.4 Theorem (Existence). Let X be an arc-connected compact metric 
space and P, Q two points of X. There exists a simple rectifiable curve of 
minimal length joining P to Q, provided there exists at least a rectifiable 
curve connecting P and Q. 
Proof. Since there exists at least a rectifiable curve connecting P and Q, A := 
inf{L(7) I 7 connecting P and Q} < +oo. Let A; > A and let 
K:={^:[OA]-^x\ipe 
Lipfc([0,1], X), <^(0) = P, (^(1) = Q } . 
By the Ascoli-Arzela theorem, K is compact in C°([0,1],X), hence there is (fo £ K 
such that 
L(ipo) = inf I L(7) 7 connecting P and Q > 
(H-l) 
by the Prechet-Weierstrass theorem. The map (/?o need not be injective a priori. How-
ever, the intrinsic reparametrization ip : [0, L((^o)] —^ ^^ see Theorem 7.44, which is 
equivalent to (po, having Lipschitz constant one, satisfies 
L{il;,[xi,X2]) 
= \xi 
-X2\ 
and is injective. In fact, if 1/^(2:1) = '0(cc2) with xi < X2, deleting the loop corresponding 
to the interval ]a;i,a;2[, we would still get a curve connecting P and Q, but of length 
strictly less than L((po), contradicting (11.1). 
• 
11.5 %, Show that the compactness assumption on X in Theorem 11.4 is necessary. In 
particular, discuss the cases when X equals the closed unit cube minus an interior open 
segment and minus a closed interior segment. 
11.1.2 A minimum problem in a Hilbert 
space 
In this section we shall show how the theorem ensuring the existence of 
minimizers for quadratic coercive functionals generalizes to convex coercive 
functionals in a Hilbert space. 

398 
11. Some Applications 
a. Weak convergence in Hilbert spaces 
Let X be a Banach space. We say that a sequence {xn} C X converges 
weakly to x G X, and we write 
if F{xn) —> F{x) VF e X*, i.e., for every linear continuous functional 
F : X -> R on X. 
On account ot the Riesz's representation theorem, we have the follow-
ing. 
11.6 Proposition. A sequence {un} in a Hilbert space converges weakly 
to u e H iff {un\v) -> {u\v) ^v e H. 
If H is finite dimensional, weak and strong convergence agree, since 
weak convergence amounts to the convergence of the components in an 
orthonormal basis. 
On the contrary, if H has infinite dimension, the two notions of con-
vergences diflFer. In fact, while from the inequaUty 
\{Un-u\v)\ 
< \\v\\\\Un 
- 
u\\ 
we get that strong convergence, ||iin — ^^H —> 0, implies weak convergence 
u-n -^ u; the opposite is not true. Consider, for instance, a denumerable 
orthonormal set {e^} C H. Then Bessel inequality yields {en\v) —> 0 Vi; G 
if, i.e., Cn -^ 0, while {cn} does not converge since 
Ikn -emii^ = ||en||^ - 2{en\em) + ||em||^ = 2 
yn,m. 
Weak convergence is one of the major tools in modern analysis. Here 
we only state one of its major useful issues. 
11.7 Theorem. Every bounded sequence in a separable Hilbert space has 
a subsequence that is weakly convergent. 
Proof. Let {xn}, 
\xn\ < M, be a bounded sequence in H, and {ci} be a basis of H. 
{xn} has a subsequence {x!^} such that (x!^\ei) -^ a i . Similarly {x!^} has a subsequence 
{x!^} such that ((x!Jl\e2) -^ <y2, and so on. Therefore by a Cantor diagonal procedure, 
we can find a subsequence {xk^ } of {xn} such that (xk^ |ei) —> a^ € M Vi, and of course 
|ai| < M Vz. Now consider the map T : H -^R 
given by 
cx> 
T{y) := Yl^y\ei)au 
y e H. 
i=l 
T is linear and bounded, ||T|| < M as 
hence the representation theorem of Riesz yields the existence of XT ^ H such that 
Tiy) = iy\xT) ^y e H and \\XT\\ 
= \\T\\ < M. In particular XT = Er'Si ^i^i e H. 
We now prove that {xk^} 
converges weakly to XT- For that, set Zn := x^^ — XT and 

11.1 Two Minimum Problems 
399 
let y be any vector in H. For any fixed e > 0 choose TV sufficiently large so that for 
VN '= Z)ili(2/|ei)ei, we have \\y - yjsfW < e. Then 
|(^n|2/-yiv)|<lkn||||2/-2/iv||<2M6; 
on the other hand {zn\ei) —> 0, hence |(2n|yAr)| < e for n larger than some n = n(Ar, e). 
Thus 
\{zn\y)\<{2M 
+ \)e 
\^n>n. 
D 
11.8 Remark. The last part of the proof actually shows that in a sepa-
rable Hilbert space, weak convergence [xn — x|y) -^ 0 Vy amounts to the 
convergence of the components [xn — a:|ei) —^ 0 Vi in an orthonormal basis 
11.9 %, Show that the compactness theorem, Theorem 10.52, holds in a generic Hilbert 
space which is not necessarily separable. [Hint: Apply Theorem 10.52 to the closure HQ 
of the family of finite combinations of {xn}, which is a separable Hilbert space. Then 
find X £ Ho and a subsequence {xk^} such that (xk^ —x\y) —>• 0 Vy G i/o- Then, use the 
orthogonal projection theorem onto HQ to show that actually, {x^^ —x\y) ^^ 0 Vy G H.]

is the quadratic functional

where L is a bounded linear form on if, that we have encountered in 
deahng with the abstract Dirichlet principle. 
Then we have, compare Proposition 5.61 of [GMl], the following.

11.2 A Theorem by Gelfand and 
Kolmogorov 
In this section we shall prove that a topological space X is identified by 
the space of continuous functions on it. If we think of X as a geometric 
world and of a map from X into R as an observable of X, we can say: if we 
know enough observables, say the continuous observables, then we know 
our world. 
Let us begin by proving the following. 
11.14 Proposition. Every metric space (X^d) can be isometrically em-
bedded in C^ {X). 
Proof. Fix p e X and consider the map (/? : X —» C^(X,R) 
that maps a e X into 
fa'.X 
-^R defined by 
fa{x) := d{x,a) - 
d{x,p). 
Trivially, fa € C°(X,R) and 
\fa{x) - A(x)| = \d{x, a) - d{x, b)\ < d{a, 6), 
i-e., Il/a — Alloo £ d{a^ 6); on the other hand ioi x = h we have \fa{h) — fh{b)\ — d{a, b), 
hence (p is an isometry. 
D 
11.15 %. Show that every separable metric space (X, d) can be isometrically embedded 
in loo. [Hint: Let {xn} be a sequence in X and let (f : X -^ loo be given by (f{x)n '•= 
d{x,Xn) — d(xi,Xn)' 
Show that ip is an isometry.] 
Let X be a topological space, see Chapter 5. The set C^{X,R) 
is a 
linear space and actually a commutative algebra with identity, since the 
product of two continuous functions is continuous. Let R and R^ be two 
commutative algebras. A map (/? : i? ^ i?' is said to be a homomorphism 
from R into R^ iiip{a-^b) = ip{a)-\-(p{b) and ip{ab) = (p{a)(p{b). If, moreover, 
ip is bijective we say that R and R' are isomorphic. 
Clearly C^{X,R) 
is completely determined by X, in the sense that 
every topological isomorphism (p : X -^ Y determines an isomorphism of 
the commutative algebras C^ (F, R) and C^ (X, R), the isomorphism being 
the composition product / -^ / o <^. If X is compact, the converse also 
holds. 
11.16 Theorem (Gelfand—Kolmogorov). Let X be a compact topolog-
ical space. Then C^(X,M) determines X. 
We confine ourselves to outlining the proof of Theorem 11.16. An ideal X of the 
algebra R is a, subset of R such that a,b £X => a — b E X and 
aEX,rER=^a-rEX. 
R is clearly the unique ideal that contains the identity of R. An ideal is called proper if 
X ^ R and maximal if it is not strictly contained in any proper ideal. Finally, we notice 
that R/X is a field if and only if X is maximal. 
11.17 Lemma. Let X be a compact topological space. X is a proper maximal ideal of 
C^{X) 
if and only if there is XQ e X such that X = {f e C^{X) \ f{xo) = 0}. 

11.3 Ordinary Differential Equations 
403 
Proof. For any / € X, the set / 
^(0) is closed and / 
^(0) ^ 0. Otherwise 1//, hence 1, 
belongs to X, and J is not proper. Let / i , •.., /n € X. The function / := 53?==! f? i^ i^ ^ 
and / " H o ) = n / ^ ^ O ) 7«^ 0. Since X is compact, n{/-HO) | / G X} / 0. In particular, 
there is XQ G -^ such that f{xo) = 0 V/ G X. On the other hand, {/1 f{xo) = 0} is an 
ideal, hence X = {/ | /(xo) = 0}. 
D 
The spectrum of a commutative algebra with unity is then defined by 
specR := j X X meiximal ideal of R?. 
Trivially, if R is isomorphic to C°(X, M), R ~ C^(X, M), then also the maximal ideals 
of R and C^(X, R) are in one-to-one correspondence, hence by Lemma 11.17 
s p e c i f - s p e c C ^ ( X ) - X . 
To conclude the proof of Theorem 11.16, we need to introduce a topology on the 
space specC^(X, R) in such a way that spec C^(X,M) ~ X becomes a topological 
isomorphism. For that, we notice that, if X is a maximal ideal of C^{X,R), 
then 
C^(X, R)/X ~ R, hence the so-called evaluation 
maps /(X), that map (/,X) into 
[/] € C^(X, R)/X c^ R, have sign. Now, if we fix the topology on spec R :^ spec C^{X, R) 
by choosing as a basis of neighborhoods the finite intersections of 
U(f) := *{ X X proper maximal ideal with /(X) > 0 >, 
it is not difficult to show that the isomorphism X —> specC^(X, R) is continuous. Since 
X is compact and the points in specC^(X, R) are separated by open neighborhoods, it 
follows that the isomorphism is actually a topological isomorphism. 
Theorem 11.16 has a stronger formulation that we shall not deal with, but that we 
want to state. A Banach space with a product which makes it an algebra such that 
\\^y\\ < Ikll \\y\\ is called a Banach algebra. An involution 
on a Banach algebra R is 
an operation x -^ x* such that (x -\- y)* = x* + y*, (Ax)* = Ax*, {xy)* = (yx)* and 
(x*)* = X. A Banach algebra with an involution is called a C*-algebra. Examples of 
C*-algebras are: 
(i) the space of complex-valued continuous functions from a topological space with 
involution / —» / , 
(ii) the space of linear bounded operators on a Hilbert space with the involution given 
by A —^ A*, A* being the adjoint of A. 
Again, the space of proper maximal ideals of a commutative C*-algebra, endowed 
with a suitable topology, is called the spectrum of the algebra. 
Theorem (Gelfand—Naimark). A C*-algebra is isometrically 
isomorphic to the al-
gebra of com,plex-valued continuous functions 
on its 
spectrum. 
11.3 Ordinary Differential Equations 
The Banach fixed point theorem in suitable spaces of continuous func-
tions plays a key role in the study of existence, uniqueness and continuous 
dependence from the data of solutions of ordinary differential equations.

11. Some Applications 
11.3.1 The Cauchy problem 
Let D be an open set in R x R^, n > 1, and F{t, y) : D cRxW 
-^W 
be a continuous function. A solution of the system of ordinary equations 
f^x{t)^F{t,x{t)) 
(11.2) 
is the data of an interval ]a, P[c R and a function x G C^Qa^ /?[; R'^) such 
that (11.2) holds for all t G]a, ^[. In particular, (t, x{t)) should belong to D 
for all t G]a, /?[. Geometrically, if we interpret F(t, x) as a vector field in P, 
then x{t) is a solution of (11.2) if and only if its graph curve t -^ {t, x{t)) 
is of class C-^, has trajectory in JD, and velocity equals to (1, F(t, x{t))) for 
all t. For this reason, solutions of (11.2) are called integral curves of the 
system. 
a. Velocities of class 
C^{D) 
In the sequel, at times we need a fact that comes from the differential 
calculus for functions of several variables that we are not discussing in this 
volume. Let (7 C R^ be an open set. We say that a function / : f] —> R is 
of class C^(p)^ fc > 1, if / possesses continuous partial derivatives up to 
order k. One can prove that, if / G C^{0) and 7 : [a, 6] -^ fi is a C^ curve 
in n, then / o 7 : [a, 6] —> R is of class C^([a, h\). For fc = 1 we have the 
chain rule 
where D/(x) := ( | ^ ( ^ ) , | ^ ( ^ ) , • • •, ^ ( ^ ) ) is the matrix of partial 
derivatives of / and the product D/(7(^))7'(^) is the standard matrix 
product. 
A trivial consequence is that integral curves, when they exist, possess 
one derivative more than the function velocity F{t,x{t)). 
This is true by 
definition if F is merely continuous. If, moreover, F(t, x) G C^ and x{t) G 
C^, we successively find from the equation x'{t) = F{t,x(t)) 
that x'{t) G 
C^, x'{t) G C^,.", x'{t) G C^. In particular, if F{t,x) 
has continuous 
partial derivatives of any order, then the integral curves are C^. It is 
worth noticing that if F G C^{D), then by the chain rule 
dF 
x"{t) = 
—{t,x{t))~^DF^{t,x{t))x\t), 
where DF^ is the matrix of partial derivatives with respect to the x's 
variables and the product 'DFx{t,x{t))x'{t) 
is understood as the matrix 
product. 
For the sequel, it is convenient to set

11.18 Definition. We say that a function F{t, x) : [a, 0] x B{xo, b) -^ W^ 
is Lipschitz in x uniformly with respect to t if there exists L > 0 such that 
\F{t,x)-F{t,y)\<L\x-y\ 
\/{t,x),{t,y) 
e [a,f3] x B{xo^b). 
(11.3) 
Let D be an open set m R x R^. We say that a function F{t,x) 
: 
D -^ W^ is locally Lipschitz in x uniformly with respect to t if for any 
D := [a, (3] x 5(xo, b) strictly contained in D there exists L := L{a, /?, XQ, b) 
such that 
\F{t,x)-F{t,y)\<L\x-y\

eD. 
11.19 f. Show that the function /(t, x) = sgn{t)\x\, (t, x) G [-1,1] x [—1,1] is Lipschitz 
in X uniformly with respect to t. 
11.20 If. Let D = [a,b] x [c,d] be a closed rectangle in M x E. Show that, if for all 
t G [a,6], the function x —^ fit,x) 
has derivative fx{t,x) 
on [c,d] and (t,x) —> fx{t,x) 
is continuous in D, then / is Lipschitz in x uniformly with respect to t. [Hint: Use the 
mean value theorem.] 
11.21 If- Show the following. Let D be an open set of R x R^ and let F{t,x) 
G C^(D). 
Then F is locally Lipschitz in x uniformly with respect to t. [Hint: For any {to,xo) G D, 
choose a,b ^ R such that D := {{t, x)\\t 
— to\ < a, \x — xo\ < b} is strictly contained 
in D. Then, for (t,xi), 
(t,X2) G D, consider the curve 7(5) := (t, (1 — s)xi + 8X2), 
s G [0,1] whose image is in D and apply the mean value theorem to ^(7(5)), s G [0,1].] 
b. Local existence and uniqueness 
Assume (to,xo) G D. We seek a local solution 
x{t) := (xi(t),.. .,Xn{t)) e C\[to - r, to + r],R^) 
for some r > 0 of the Cauchy problem relative to the system (11.2), i.e., 
^x{to) = XQ. 
We have the following. 
11.22 Proposition. Let D be an open set in R x W^, n > 1, and let 
F{t,x) : D —> R"^ be a continuous function. Then x{t) G C^{[to — r, to + 
r],W) 
solves (11.4) if and only if x{t) belongs to C^{[to - r,to + 
r],W) 
and satisfies the integral equation

(11.5)

11. Some Applications 
Proof. Set / := [to-r,to+r\. 
If x G C^(/,M^) solves (11.4), then by integration x sat-
isfies (11.5). Conversely, if a; G C^(/,R^) and satisfies (11.5), then, by the fundamental 
theorem of calculus, x{t) is differentiable and x'{t) = F{t, x{t)) in /, in particular it has 
a continuous derivative. Moreover, (11.5) for t = to yields x{to) = XQ. 
D 
Let US start with a local existence and uniqueness result. 
11.23 Theorem (Picard-Lindelof). Let F(t,x) : D cRxW 
^W 
he a continuous function with domain D := {{t^x) G R x R^ | |t — to| < 
a, \x — xo\ < b}. Suppose 
(i) F{t,x) is hounded in D, \F{t,x)\ < M, 
(ii) F(t, x) is Lipschitz in x uniformly with respect to t, 
\F{t,x)-F{t,y)\<k\\x-y\\ 
V{t,x), 
{e,y) e D. 
Then the Cauchy problem (11.4) has a unique solution in [to — r,to + r] 
where

Proof. Let r be as in the claim and Ir := [*o — ^^^ to-\-r]. According to Proposition 11.22, 
we have to prove that the equation 
x{t) =xo-{- 
F(T,x(T))dT. 
JtQ 
has a unique solution x{t) G C°(/r,M^). 
Let 2/1,2/2 G C^{Ir,W) 
be two solutions of (11.5). Then for all t G Ir

The fixed point theorem of Banach, Theorera 9.128, yields a (actually, a unique) fixed

The Picard-Lindelof theorem allows us to discuss the uniqueness for 
the initial value problem (11.4). 
11.24 Theorem (Uniqueness). Let D cRxW^ 
be a bounded domain, 
let F{t, x) : D -^W^ be a continuous function that is also locally Lipspchitz 
in X uniformly in t, and let {to,xo) G D. Then any two solutions x\ : I -^ 
W^, X2 '- J —^W^ defined respectively, on open intervals I and J containing 
to of the inital value problem 
(x^{t) = 
F{t,x{t)), 
[x{to) = xo, 
are equal on I H J. 
Proof. It is enough to assume I C J. Define 
E := |t G/|xi(t) =X2{t)Y 
Obviously to £ E and E is closed relatively to I, as xi, X2 are continuous. We now prove 
that E is open in /, concluding E = I since / is an interval, compare Chapter 5. 
Let t* e E, define x* := xi{t*) = X2(t*). Let a, 6 G M+ be such that D := {{t, x) € 
D I |t — t*| < a, |a; — a:*| < 6} is strictly contained in D. F being bounded and locally 
Lipschitz in x uniformly with respect to t in D, the Picard-Lindelof theorem applies 
on D. Since xi(t) and X2{t) both solve the initial value problem starting at (t*,x*), 
we 
conclude that xi{t) = X2(t) on a small interval around x*. Thus E is open. 
D 
c. Continuation of solutions 
We have seen that the initial value problem ha^ a solution that exists on 
a possibly small interval. Does a solution in a larger interval exist? 
As we have seen, given two solutions xi : / —> E"^, X2 : J -^ M'^ 
of the same initial value problem, one can glue them together to form a 
new function x : I U J —^ W^, that is again a solution of the same initial 
value problem but defined on a possibly larger interval. We say that x is 
a continuation of both xi and X2' Therefore, Theorem 11.24 allows us to 
define the maximal solution, or simply the solution as the solution defined 
on the largest possible interval. 
11.25 Lemma. Suppose that F : D CR xW^ -^W^ is continuous in D, 
and let x{t) be a solution of the initial value problem

\x{to) = xo 
in the bounded interval ^ < t < 5; in particular {t^x{t)) e D ^t €]7,(5[. 
If F is bounded near {S,x{S)), then x{t) can be continuously extended on 
S, Moreover, if {S^x{S)) G D, then the extension is C^ up to S. A similar 
result holds also at (7, a:(7)). 
Proof 
Suppose that \F{t,x)\ 
< M V(t,x) and let x{t), t e]j,5[, be a solution. For 
ti, ^2 €]7, S[ we have 
r(t2) -x(ti)\ 
< I ^ \F{t,x(t))\dt 
<M\ti

i.e., X is Lipschitz on ]7, (5[, therefore it can be continuusly extended to [7, S]. The second

Now if, for instance, {5^ x{S)) is not on the boundary of D and we can 
solve the initial value problem with initial datum x{5) at to = ^, we can 
continue the solution in the C^ sense because of Proposition 11.22, beyond 
the time 5, thus concluding the following. 
11.26 Theorem (Continuation of solutions). Let F(t,x) 
be continu-
ous in an open set D dB^xW^ 
and locally Lipschitz in x uniformly with 
respect to t. Then the unique (maximal) solution of x'(t) = F{t^x{t)) 
with 
x{to) = XQ extends forwards and backwards till the closure of its graph 
eventually meets the boundary of D. More precisely, any (maximal) solu-
tion x(t) is defined on an interval ]a, /?[ with the following property: for any 
given compact set K C /S., there is 5 — S{K) > 0 such that {t,x{t)) ^ K 
forti 
[a-^5,(3-5]. 
Recalling Exercise 11.21, we get the following. 
11.27 Corollary. LetD be an open domain in^xW^, 
and letF G C^{D). 
Then every (maximal) solution of x'{t) = F(t^x{t)) 
can be extended for-
wards and backwards till the closure of its graph eventually reaches dD. 
11.28 Corollary. Let D '.=]a,b[xW^ (a and b may be respectively, +00 
and —00) and let F{t,x) : D -^ W^ be continuous and locally Lipschitz in x 
uniformly with respect to t. Then every locally bounded (maximal) solution 
of x' = F{t,x) is defined on the entire interval ]a, 6[. 
Proof. Let \x(t)\ 
< M. Should the maximal solution be defined on [a,/?] with, say 
P < b, then the graph of x would be contained in the compact set [a, /3] x B(0, M) 
strictly contained in ]a, 6[xR^. This contradicts Theorem 11.26. 
D 

11.3 Ordinary Differential Equations

Of course, if F is bounded in D :=]a, fofxR*^, all solutions of x' = F(t^x) 
are automatically locally bounded since their velocities are bounded, so the 
previous theorem applies. For a weaker condition and stronger result, see 
Exercise 11.33. 
11.29 Example. Consider the initial value problem x' = x^, x{0) = 1, in Da '•= 
{(t, x) 11 G M, \x\ < a}. Since \F\ < a^ in Da, the continuation theorem applies. In fact, 
the maximal solution 1/(1 — t), t G] — O O , 1 — - [ has a graph that extends backwards 
till —CO and forward until it touches dDa-
d. Systems of higher order equations 
We notice that a differential equation of order n in normal form in the 
scalar unkown x{t) 
lx{t) 
= F(t,x(t), | x ( t ) , . . . , ^,x{i)) 
(11.6) 
can be written, by defining 
xi{t) := x{t), 
X2{t) := -JlXiii)^ 
as the first order system 
x[{t)=:x2{t), 
{x'^{t)=:Fit,Xi{t),X2it),...,Xn{t)) 
or, compactly as, 
y'{t) = 
F{t,y{t)) 
for the vector-valued unknown y{t) := {xi{t),X2{t),... 
,Xn{t)) and F : 
D C R X R^ -^ M^ given by 
F{t, Xi, . . . , Xn) :=- (X2, X3, . . . , Xn, / ( t , Xi(t), X2(t), . . . , 
Xn{t)). 
Consequently, the Cauchy problem for (11.6) is

Along the same line, the initial value problem for a system of higher order 
equations can be reformulated as a Cauchy problem for a system of first 
order equations, to which we can apply the theory just developed. 
e. Linear systems 
For linear systems 
x'{t)=A{t)x{t)+g{t), 
(11.8) 
where A{t) is an n x n matrix and g{t) G R^, we have the following. 
11.30 Theorem. Suppose that A{t) and g{t) are continuous in [a, 6] and 
that to G [a, 6] and XQ EW^. Then the solution of (11.8) with initial value 
x{to) = xo exists on the entire interval

Let 7 > 0. The function on C^([a,b],W^) defined by 
||X||,:= sup (iX(t)le-^l^-^ol) 
is trivially a norm on C^([a, 6]). Moreover, it is equivalent to the uniform 
norm on C^([a, 6],R'^) since 
e-^l''-"l||X|U,Ml<l|X||^<||X|U,[a,6l. 
Hence the space C^([a, 6], R"') endowed with the norm || ||^, that we denote 
by C^, is a Banach space. 
11.34 Proposition. Let T be the map in (11.11). Then T{C^) C C^

11.35 Theorem. The initial value problem (11.9) has a unique solution 
X{t) of class C^{[a^b]), and 
\X(t)\< 
(^\Xo\ + I '

Banach fixed point theorem T has a unique fixed point. Going into its proof, we get the 
approximations. Finally, the estimate on \X{t)\ follows from (11.10) and the Gronwall 
Lemma.

We now show that the local solution x{t; to, XQ) of the Cauchy problem

[x{to) = Xo 
depends continuously on the initial point (to, XQ), and in fact is continuous 
in (t,to,xo).

11. Some Applications 
11.37 Theorem. Let F(t,x) and Fx{t^x) be bounded and continuous in 
a region D. Also suppose that in D we have 
\F{t,x)\<M, 
\FS,x)\<k. 
Then, for any e > 0 there exists 5 > 0 such that 
\x{t;to,xo) - x(t',To,xo)\ < e 
provided \t — t\ < S and \xo — xo\ < S and t, t are in a common interval of 
existence.

h. The Peano theorem 
We shall now prove existence for the Cauchy problem (11.4) assuming only 
continuity on the velocity field F(t, x). As we know, in this case we cannot 
have uniqueness, see Example 6.16 of [GMl]. 
11.39 Theorem (Peano). Let F{t,x) he a hounded continuous function 
in a domain D, and let (ito,xo) he a point in D. Then there exists at least 
one solution of 
(x' = F{t,x), 
\x{to) = XQ. 
Proof. Let \F{t,x)\ 
< M and D := {{t,x) 
G M x R^ | \t - to\ < a, \x - xo\ < b} be 
strictly contained in D. If r < min{a, b/M} we have seen that

T[x]{t) := f

maps the closed and convex set 
X := ixeC^{[xo 
-r,xo+r],R'^)\x{to)

continuous in D, Ve > 0 Br/ such that 
|F(t, x) - F(t, x')\<e

dt 
to 
Moreover 
\T[x]it')-T[x]{t)\ 
= 
^lF{T,x{r))dT <M\t-t'\, 
t' 
and we conclude by the Ascoli-Arzela theorem that T : X —>^ X is compact. The 
Caccioppoli-Schauder theorem yields the existence of at least one fixed point x(t), 
x{t) = T[x]{t); this concludes the proof. 
• 
Notice that the solutions can be continued, cf. Lemma 11.25, possibly 
in a nonunique way. Therefore any solution can be continued as a solution 
forwards and backwards in time till the closure of the graph of the extension 
eventually meets the boundary of the domain D.

through every point {to,XQ) with t E [to,to -\- S] and x G [x{t),x{t)] there passes 
a solution of (11.13).

11.3.2 Boundary value problems 
For second order equations it is useful to consider, besides the initial value 
problem, so-called boundary value problems in which the values of u or 
u', or a combination of these values, are prescribed at the boundary of 
the interval. For instance, suppose we want to find the linear motion of 
a particle under the external force F{t^x{t)^x'{t)) 
starting at time t = 0 
in XQ and ending at time t = 1 in xi, i.e., we want to solve the Dirichlet 
problem, 
' x"{t) = F{t,x{t),x\t)) 
in]0,l[, 
x{0) = XQ, 
x(l) = xi.

11.44 Theorem. Lei F{t,x,y) 
be a continuous function in the domain 
D := {{t^x^y)\t 
e [0,1], |x| < a, \y\ < a}. Moreover, suppose that 
F{t,x,y) 
is Lipschitz in {x^y) uniformly with respect to t, i.e., there exists 
/i > 0 such that 
\F{t,xi,yi) 
-F(t,X2,2/2)1 < M ( k i -X2I + I2/1 -2/2I) 
for every (t,xi,?/i), (t,X2,2/2) ^ L). Then for |A| sufficiently small the 
problem

\x(0)=x(l) = 0 
has a unique solution x{t) G C^([0,1]). Moreover \x{t)\ < a and \x\t)\ < a

Proof. If x(t) solves x" = XF{t,x(t),x'{t)), 
then

11. Some Applications 
a. The shooting method 
A natural approach to show existence of scalar solutions to the boundary 
value problem 
^x" = F(t,x,x') 
in]Oj[, 
x(0)=0, 
(11.16) 
x{t) = X 
consists in showing first existence of solutions y{t,\) 
of the initial value 
problem 
\ " = F{t,y,y') 
in[0,^ 
y(0) = 0, 
(11-17) 
,y'(o) = A, 
defined in the interval [0, ?] , and then showing that the scalar equation 
y(t, 
\)=x 
has at least a solution A; in this case the function y{t^\) clearly solves 
(11.16). Since y{t,X) is continuous in A by Theorem 11.37, to solve the 
last equation it suffices to show that there are values Ai and A2 such that 
y{t, Ai) <x< 
y{t, A2). This approach is usually referred to as the shooting 
method, introduced in 1905 by Carlo Severini (1872-1951). 
11.45 Theorem. Let F{t,x,y) 
be a continuous function in a domain D. 
The problem (11.16) has at least a solution, provided that t and x/t are 
sufficiently small. 
Proof. Suppose \F{t, x,y)\ < M\ choose M > M' and a sequence of Lipschitz functions 
Fk(t,x^y) 
that converge uniformly to F{t^x,y) 
with 
\Fk{t,x,y)\<M 
Vfc, 
\ft,x,y. 
Problem (11.17) for F^ transforms into the Cauchy problem for the first order system 
i^(0) = (0,A) 
where z{t) = (x(t),y(t)) 
and Gk(x,z) 
= (y, Fk{t,x,y)). 
Now if 6 > 0 is chosen so that 
D := {(t, z)\\t\ 
< a e \z — (0, A)| < 6} is in the domain of Gk(t, z), and we proceed as 
in the proof of Peano's theorem, we find a solution z^^x of (11.18) defined in [0, r] with 
r < mm L, 
-^ 
1. 
(11.19) 
Since Gk is a Lipschitz function, z^ is in fact the unique solution of (11.18) and depends 
continuously on A := (0, A). If Xk,x{t) is the first component of zj^^x, we have, see 
Theorem 11.44, 
t 
Xk,xW = Xt-h j{t 
- T)Fir, Xfc,A(r), 4,A W ) dr, 

11.3 Ordinary Differential Equations

hence 
Xr - r^M < Xk,x{r) < Ar + r'^M 
and in particular, 
Xk,xi'^)<x 
ii Xr-\-r^M 
<x, 
fii 90) 
Xk,xi'^) > ^ 
if Ar — r^M > x. 
It follows from (11.19) that the assumptions in (11.20) hold for two values of A if r 
and x/r are small enough, concluding that there is a solution Xk € C^([0, r]) to the 
boundary value problem 
fx'^'(t) = Ffc(t,a:fc,4), 
\xk(0)=Q, 
(11-21) 
[xk{r) = x. 
As in Theorem 11.44, we see that the family {xk{t)} is equibounded with equicontinuous 
derivatives, thus, by the Ascoli-Arzela theorem, a subsequence converges to x in the 
space C^([0,r]), and passing to the limit in the integral form of (11.21), we see actually 
that X e C2([0,r]) and solves (11.16) in [0,r]. 
D 
b. A maximum principle 
Let u e C^QO, 1[) n C°([0,1]), but [0,1] can be replaced by any bounded 
interval. If u has a local maximum point XQ in the interior of [0,1], then 
^'(xo) = 0 and 
u'\xo) < 0. 
(11.22) 
If, moreover, u satisfies the differential inequality 
u" -\-b{x)u' >0, 
(11.23) 
then clearly (11.22) does not hold at points of ]0,1[, thus the maximum of 
?/ is at 0 or 1, that is, at the boundary of [0,1]. If we allow the nonstrict 
inequality 
^'' + b{xy > 0 
the constant functions that have maximum at every point, are allowed; 
but this is the only exception. In fact, we have the following. 
11.46 Theorem (Maximum principle). Let u be a function of class 
C^(]xi,X2[) nC^([xi,X2]) that satisfies the differential inequality 
u" + b(x)u' > 0 
in ]x\,X2[ 
where b{x) is a function that is bounded below. Then u is constant, if it 
has an interior maximum point. 
Proof. By contradiction, suppose XQ €]XI,X2[ is an interior maximum point and u is 
not constant so that there is x such that u(x) < u{xo). Assume for instance x €]xo, X2[ 
and consider the function 
;2(x) := e"(^-^o) - 1 , 
xe 
[xi,X2], 
where a is a positive constant to be chosen. Trivially z{x) < 0 in ]xi,xo[, z{xo) = 0, 
z{x) > 0 in ]xo,X2[ and

w{x) := u(x) + €z{x) 
where e > 0 has to be chosen. We have w(xo) = u(xo), w{x) < u(x) < u{xo) = w(xo) 
for X < xo, and w{x) = u{x) -h tz{x) < u{xo) if e < ^ ^^(^)^^^^ • With the previous 
choices of a and e, the function w has an interior maximum point in ]a;i,a:2[, but 
w" + b{x)w > 0: a contradiction. 
D 
11.47 %, In the previous proof, z{x) := e*^(^~^o) — 1 is one of the possible choices. 
Show for instance that z{x) := {x — xi)^ — (XQ — xi)*^ does it as well.

< 0 if u has a maximum 
value at xi and u'{x2) > 0 if u has maximum value at X2. 
Proof. As in Theorem 11.46 we find w'(xi) 
= u'(a) -f ea < 0 if w has maximum value 
at a:i. 
D 
Similarly we get the following. 
11.49 Theorem (Maximum principle). Letb{x) andc{x) be two func-
tions with b{x) bounded from below and c{x) < 0 in [xi,X2]. Suppose that 
u G C^(]xi,X2[) n C^([xi,^2]) satisfies the differential inequality 
u" + h{x)u\x) -h c{x)u > 0 
in ]xi, X2[. 
Then 
(i) either u is constant or u has no nonnegative maximum at an interior 
point, 
(ii) ifu is not constant and has nonnegative maximum at Xi (respectively, 
at X2), then u'{xi) < 0 (respectively, u'{x2) > 0). 
An immediate consequence is the following comparison and uniqueness 
theorem for the Dirichlet boundary value problem for linear second order 
equations. 
11.50 Theorem (Comparison principle). Let ui and U2 be two func-
tions in C^(]x 1,^2 [) n C^([x 1,0:2]) that solve the differential equation 
u'\x) + b{x)u'{x) -h c{x)u{x) = f{x) 
where b, c and f are bounded functions and c{x) < 0. 
(i) If ui > U2 at xi and X2, then u\ > U2 in [xi.,X2], 
(ii) if ui = U2 in Xi and X2, then ui = U2 in [xi,X2]. 
11.51 t ' Add details to the proofs of Theorems 11.49 and 11.50. By considering the 
equations u" + u = 0 e u" — u = Q show that Theorem 11.49 is optimal.

c. The method of super- and sub-solutions 
Consider the boundary value problem 
i-u''^Xu 
= f{x) 
in]0,l[, 
^^^24) 
The comparison principle, Theorem 11.50, says that it has at most one 
solution if A > 0, and, since we know the general integral, (11.24) has a 
unique solution. Let Q be the Green operator that maps / G C^([0,1]) to 
the unique C^([0,1]) solution of (11.24). Q is trivially continuous; since 
C2([0,l]) embeds into C^([0,1]) compactly, G is compact from C°([0,1]) 
into C^([0,1]); finally by the maximum principle, Q is monotone: if / < p, 
then Gf < Gg. 
Consider now the boundary value problem 
\-u" 
= 
f{x,u), 
\u{0) = u{l) = 0 
where we assume / : [0,1] x M ^ M to be continuous, differentiable in 
u for every fixed x, with fu{x,u) continuous and bounded, \fu{x,u)\ < k 
V(x, u) e [0,1] X R. By choosing A sufficiently large, we see that /(x, u) + Xu 
is increasing in u and we may apply to the problem 
I -u'' + Xu = /(x, u) -f Xu, 
.^^ 25) 
\u{0) = u{l) = 0 
the argument in Theorem 11.46, inferring that, iiu and u are respectively, 
a subsolution and a supersolution for —u" = f{x,u), i.e., 
- M ' ' < / ( X , U ) , 
f - 7 l " > / ( x , ^ ) , 
^(0), M ( 1 ) < 0 , 
<IZ(0), U{1) < 0 , 
[MeC2([0,l]), 
[ueC\[OA]) 
then setting Tu := G{f{x, u{x)) + Xu{x)) and 
U:=M, 
iun^i-Tun, 
f o r n > l , 
[Vo :=U, 
[Vn+l 
=TVn 
the sequences {un} and {vn} converge uniformly to a solution of 
i.e., to a function of class C^ that solves (11.25). Hence we conclude

11.52 Theorem. Let f{x,u) 
be a smooth function with \fu{x^u)\ < k 
V(a:, ?i). Assume that there exist a subsolution and a supersolution for

\u{0) = u{l) = 0. 
Then there also exists a solution. 
We also have the following. 
11.53 Theorem. Let f{t,p) : [0, +oc[x]R —> R 6e a function of class C^ 
that is periodic of period p in t. If the equation x"{t) = f{t,x{t)) 
has a 
subsolution x{t) and a supersolution x{t) that are periodic of period p with 
x{t) < x{t) for all t, then it has also a solution in between, of period p.

d. A theorem by Bernstein 
We conclude our excursus in the field of ODEs by the following result. 
11.55 Theorem (Bernstein). Let F{x,u,p) 
: [a,6] x R x M ^ R 6e a 
continuous function such that 
(i) there exists M > 0 such that uF{x,u,0) 
> 0 if \u\ > M, 
(ii) there exist continuous nonnegative functions a{x, u) and b{x, u) such 
that 
\F(x,u,p)\ 
< a{x,u)\p\'^ -^b{x,u) 
\J{x,u,p) 6 [a,6] x R x R. 
Then the problem i
n" — F(x^u^u') 
in]a^b[^ 
u{a) = u(b) = 0 
has a solution. 
The original theorem^ by Bernstein, instead of (i), requires the stronger 
assumption that F be of class C^ and for some positive constant k one has 
Fu{x, u,p) > k > 0 for all (x, u,p). Its proof uses the shooting method. We 
shall instead use Schaefer's theorem, Theorem 9.142. 
Proof. As we have seen, the operator that maps every v G C^([a, 6]) into the solution 
of the problem 
L'' 
= 
F{x,v{x),v'{x)), 
| i t ( a ) = 0 , 
u{b) = 0 
is compact. Therefore, according to Schaefer's theorem, it suffices to show that, under 
the assumptions of Theorem 11.55, there exists r > 0 such that, whenever the function 
V e C2([a,6]) solves 
(
v'' = 
XF{x,v,v'), 
v(a) = vib) = 0, 
for some A G [0,1], then ||'y||c2([a,6]) < '^^ 
ESTIMATE OF ||^;||CXD- Let XQ be a maximum point for v'^{x). We may assume XQ E.]a,b[, 
otherwise v = 0; therefore we have v'{xo) = 0 and 
0 > ^ ^ ^ W I ^ = ^ o = 2V''^{XQ) + 2V{XO)V"{XO) 
= 
Xv{xo)F{xo,v{xo),0); 
the assumption (i) then implies |t^(xo)| < M, hence ||t'||oo < M. 
ESTIMATE OF ||f'||oo- Let /i be a positive constant and let A and B be bounds for a(x, u) 
and b{x,u) when x G [a,b] and \u{x)\ < M. Multiplying the equation for v by e~^'" we 
find 
hence 
if /i > A. Similarly, multiplying the equation for v by e^^, we find

11.4 Linear Integral Equations 
11.4.1 Some motivations 
In several instances we have encountered integral equations, as convolution 
operators or, when solving linear equations, as integral equations of the 
type 
x{t) = yo+ 
f{s,y{s))ds; 
Jto 
for instance, the linear system x'{t) = A{t)x{t) can be written as 

11.4 Linear Integral Equations 
425 
x{t)=: f A{s)x{s)ds. 
(11.26) 
Jto 
(11.26) is an example of Volterra^s equation, i.e., of equations of the form 
t 
f{t) - ax{t) -h f k{t, r)x{r) dr. 
(11.27) 
0 
a. Integral form of second order equations 
The equation x'\t) — A{t)x{t) = 0, t G [a, ^], can be written as a Volterra 
equation. In fact, integrating, we get 
x'{t) = ci -h / A{s)x{s) ds 
and, integrating again, 
x{t) = co + ci{t-to) 
+ J 
(^j^ 
A{s)x{s)ds)dT 
= Co-\-ci{t - to) + / {t-s)A{s)x{s)dsdT 
(11.28) 
=: F{t) + I {t- s)A{s)x{s) ds, 
with F{t) := Co + ci{t - to) and G : [a, /?] x [a, /?] ^ E given by 
\t-s)A{s) 
iis<t, 
G{t,s):= 
10 
otherwise. 
b. Materials with memory 
Hooke's law states that the actual stress a is proportional to the actual 
strain e. At the end of 1800, Boltzmann and Volterra observed that the 
past history of the deformations of the body cannot always be neglected. 
In these cases the actual stress a depends not only on the actual strain, 
but on the whole of the deformations the body was subjected to in the 
past, hence at every instant t 
a{t) = ae{t) + F[e{T)ll 
where F is a functional depending on all values of €(r), 0 < r < t. In the 
linear context, Volterra proposed the following analytical model for F, 
k{t, T)e{T) dr. 

426 
11. Some Applications 
This leads to the study of equations of the type 
t 
a{t) = ae{t) + / 
k{t,T)e{T)dr, 
that are called Volterra ^s integral equations of first and second kind ac-
cording to whether a = 0 or a ^^^ 0. 
c. Boundary value problems 
Consider the boundary value problem 
x" - A{t)x = 0, 
x(0) = a, 
x{L) = b. 
(11.29) 
Prom (11.28) we infer 
x{t) = ci + C2t + / {t- s)A{s)x{s) ds

C2

equation, called Fredholm equation.,

d. Equilibrium of an elastic thread 
Consider an elastic thread of length i which readily changes its shape, 
but which requires a force cd£ to increase its length by d£ according to 
Hooke's law. At rest, the position of the thread is horizontal (the segment 
AB) under the action of the tensile force TQ which is very large compared 
to any other force under consideration. 
If we apply a vertical force p at C for which x = ^, the thread will 
assume the form in Figure 11.6. Assume that S — CCQ be very small 
compared to ACQ and CQB (as a consequence of the smallness of p com-
pared with To) and, disregarding terms of the order S'^ (compared with 
^), the tension of the thread remains equal to TQ. Then the condition of 
equilibrium of forces is 
'^'l + ^'T^ 
I.e., 
p{i-m 
Tol 
' 
Denoting by y{x) the vertical deflection at a point of abscissa x, we have 
y{x) = G{x,^)p 
where 
G{x,0:--
(x{l-0 
Tol 
Tol 
0 < X < ^, 
Now suppose that a continuously distribuited force with length density 
p{^) acts on the thread. By the principle of superposition the thread will 
assume the shape 
I 
y{x) = JGix^OpiOdC 
(11.30) 
If we seek the distribution density p(^) so that the thread is in the shape 
2/(x), we are led to study Fredholm's integral equation in (11.30). 
e. Dynamics of an elastic thread 
Suppose now that a force, which varies with the time t and has density at 
^ given by 
p(^)sinu;t. 
a; > 0, 

428 
11. Some Applications 
acts on the thread. Suppose that during the motion the abscissa of ev-
ery point of the thread remains unchanged and that the thread oscillates 
according to 
y — 
y{x)smut. 
Then we find that at time t the piece of thread between ^ and ^ + A^ is 
acted upon by the force p{() sin(a;t) A^ plus the force of inertia 
where ^ is the density of mass of the thread at ^, and the equation (11.30) 
takes the form

A linear integral equation in the unknown x{t), t G [a, b] of the type 
x{t) 
o 
= f{t) + jk{t. T)X{T) 
dr 
where f{i) and k{t,x) are given functions, is called a Fredholm equation of 
second kind^ while a Fredholm equation of the first kind has the form

11. Some Applications 
6 
fk{x,T)x{T)dr 
= f{t). 
a 
The function k{t, r) is called the kernel of the integral equation. If the 
kernel satisfies k{t^ r) = 0 for t > r, the Fredholm equations of first and 
second kind are called Volterra equations. However it is convenient to treat 
Volterra equations separately. 
11.58 Theorem. Let k{t,r) 
be a continuous kernel in [a,b] x [a, 6] and 
let f G C^([a, 6]). Then the Volterra integral equation 
x{t) = f{t) -f A / fe(t, r)x{T) dr 
J a 
has a unique solution in C^([a, 6]) for all values of X. 
Proof. The transformation 
o 
T[x]it) := fit) -h A / k{t, r)x{r) 
dr 
maps C^{[a, b]) into itself. Moreover for all t 6 [a, b] we have 
\T[xi]{t) - T[x2\{t)\ < |A| M{t - a)\\xi - xalloo.la.b) 
hence 
\T^[x^]{t)~T^[X2]{t)\ 
< l A I ^ M ^ ^ i ^ l l x i 
-a;2||cc,[a,6] 
and by induction, if T^ := T o • - o T n times, 
n! 
^ ^ 
If n is sufficiently large, so that |A|^ M^ (b — a)'^/n\ 
< 1, we conclude that T'^ is a 
contraction, hence it has a unique fixed point x e C^{[a,b]). li n = 1 the proof is done, 
otherwise Tx is also a unique fixed point for T'^, so necessarily we again have Tx = x 
by uniqueness. 
D 
11.4.3 Fredholm integral equations in C^ 
11.59 Theorem. Let k{t,T) be a continuous kernel in [a, 6] x [a, 6] and 
let f G C°([a, 6]). The Fredholm integral equation 
b 
x{t) = f{t) + A / k{t, r)x{r) dr 
a 
has a unique solution x{t) in C^{[a,b]), provided \X\ is sufficiently small.

431 
Proof. Trivially, the transformation 
b 
T[x]{t) := fit) 
- H A / k{t, T)x(r) dr 
a 
maps C^([a, 6]) into itself and is contractive for A close to zero, in fact, if M :=

equation

has a set of eigenvalues A with the only accumulation point A = 0. Each 
eigenvalue X ^ 0 has finite multiplicity and for any X, X ^ 0 and X ^ A, 
(11.34) has a unique solution. 
Further information concerning the eigenvalue case requires the use of 
a different space norm, the integral norm || ||2, and therefore a description 
of the completion L'^{{a, b)) of C^{{a^ b)) that we have not yet treated.

u{t, x) = (p{x + at) + IIJ{X — at), 
where ip and ijj are, in principle, generic functions. 
Shghtly later, in 1753, Daniel Bernoulh (1700-1782) proposed a differ-
ent approach. Starting with the observation of Brook Taylor (1685-1731) 
that the functions

) • 
n = l , 2 , . . . 
(11.36) 
are solutions of the equation (11.35) and satisfy the boundary conditions 
u{t,G) = u{t,i) = ^, Bernoulli came to the conclusion that all solutions of 
(11.35) could be represented as superpositions of the tones in (11.36). An 
outcome of this was that every function could be represented as a sum of 
analytic functions, and, indeed.

was clarified with the contributions of Joseph Fourier (1768-1830), Lejeune 
Dirichlet (1805-1859), G. F. Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866) and many 
other mathematicians. The methods developed in this context, in partic-
ular the idea that a physical system near its equilibrium position can be 
described as superposition of vibrations and the idea that space analysis 
can be transformed into a frequency analysis, turned out to be of funda-
mental relevance both in physics and mathematics. 
11.5.1 Definitions and preliminaries 
We denote by Ll^^ the space of complex-valued 27r-periodic functions in R 
that are summable on a period, for instance in [—7r,7r]. For /c G Z, the kth 
Fourier coefficient of / G L^^^ is the complex number 
often denoted by f^k) 
or / ^ .

metric polynomial of order n given by

11.5,2 Point wise convergence 
If P is a trigonometric polynomial, P e 7^n,27r, then P agrees with its 
Fourier series, P{x) = E L - n ^fc^'^"^ ^^ ^ ^ ' see Section 5.4 of [GM2]. 
But this does not hold for every / G L^-j^. Given / G ^37^5 we then ask 
ourselves under which assumptions on / the Fourier series of / converges 
and converges to /. 
a. The Riemann—Lebesgue theorem 
The theorem below states that a rapidly oscillating function with a 
summable profile has an integral that converges to zero when the fre-
quency of its oscillations tends to infinity, as a result of the compensation 
of positive and negative contributions due to oscillations, even though the 
L^ norms are far from zero. 
11.64 Theorem (Riemann-Lebesgue). Let f :]a, b[-^ R be a Riemann 
summable function in ]a, 6[. For every interval ]c,d[c]a,b[ we have 
[ 
f{t)e'''^dt~^^ 
as \\\ -^00 
uniformly with respect to c and d. 
Proof, (i) Assume first that / is a step function, and let a := {XQ = a,xi,... 
,Xn = i>} 
be a subdivision of ]a,6[ so that f(x) = a^ on [xk-x^x^]. 
Then

This proves the theorem in this case. 
(ii) Let / be summable in ]a, 6[ and e > 0. By truncating / suitably, we find a bounded 
Riemann integrable function he such that /^ \f(t) — he{t)\dt 
< e, and in turn a step 
function ge : (a, 6) -^ R with fl \he{t) - ge(t)\ dt < e. Consequently J^ \f{t)-ge{t)\

J

dt = J

Of course, if / is differentiable at x, then / is regular at x with L^{x) = 
f{x) and M'^{x) = f{x). Discontinuous functions with left and right hmits 
at X and bounded slope near x are evidently regular at x. In particular 
square waves, sawtooth ramps and C^ functions are regular at every x G R. 
It is easy to see that if / is regular at x then the function 
^^^ty_^fi- + t) + fi--i)^-LH^)-L-(-)

the Corollary 11.65 yields

a. Fourier's partial sums and orthogonality 
Denote by ||/||2 the quadratic mean over a period of / 
\\f\\l--=^fjm\'dt, 
and with L^^^ the space of integrable functions with ||/||2 < oo. The Her-
mitian biUnear form and the corresponding "norm" 
(f\3):=^fj{t)W)dt, 
11/112:= (^/j/Wl'^*)

are not a Hermitian product and a norm in L^^r, since ||/||2 = 0 does 
not imply f{t) = 0 V^, but they do define a Hermitian product and a 
norm in L^^^ 0 C^(E), since ||/||2 = 0 imphes / = 0 if / is continous. 
Alternatively, we may identify functions / and g in 1/2^^ i f l l / ^ ^ ' I b ^ O , 
and again {f\g) and II/II2 define a Hermitian product and a norm on the 
equivalence classes of L27r if^ ^^ i^ is usual, we still denote by L^TT ^^^ space 
of equivalence classes. It is easily seen that L^TT is a pre-Hilbert space with 
{f\g). Notice that two nonidentical continuous functions belong to different 
equivalence classes. 
Since e*'^^, A: G Z, belong to L^^j. and

The convergence of Fourier's partial sums is a local property in the follow-

11.86 Proposition. If g,h e L\^ and g = h in a neighborhood of a point 
X, then Sng{x) — Snh{x) -^ 0 as n ^^ oo. 
Proof. Assume f .= g — h vanishes in [x — S, x -\- S], S > 0. Then, for every t e [0,6] we 
have f{x + t) = f{x — t)=0, 
hence 
Snfix) 
- fix)

Since (f{x + t) -\- f{x — t))/ sm(t/2)

Riemann-Lebesgue theorem.

11.87 Proposition. If f G L\^ and f = 0 in ]a, b[, then Snf{x)

uniformly on every interval [c, d] with a < c < d <b. 
Proof. Let us show that Snf{x) —>• 0 uniformly in [a-\-S,b — S], 0 < 6 < [h — a)/2. For 
X £[a-\- 5,b — 6] and 0 < t < (5 we have f{x -\-t) = f{x — t) = 0, hence

The locaUzation principle says that, when studying the pointwise con-

interval inside ]a, b[ of the Fourier series of a function / , we can modify / 
outside of ]a, b[. With this observation we easily get the following. 
11.88 Corollary. Let f G Ll^ be a function that is of class C^([a,6]). 
Then {Snf{x)} 
converges uniformly to f{x) in any interval strictly con-
tained in ]a, b[.

11.5.6 The Dirichlet-Jordan theorem 
The pointwise convergence of the Fourier series of a continuous or summa-
ble function is a subtle question and goes far beyond Dini's test, Theo-
rem 11.71. An important result, proved by Lejeune Dirichlet (1805-1859), 
shows in fact that a 27r-periodic function which has only a finite num-
ber of jumps and maxima and minima, has a Fourier series that con-
verges pointwise to (L"^ -h L~)/2 where L^ := \imy_^x± f{y); in particular 
Snf{x) 
-^ f{x) at the points of continuity. The same proof applies to 
functions with bounded variation, see Theorem 11.91. In 1876 Paul du 
Bois-Reymond (1831-1889) showed a continuous function whose Fourier 
series diverges at one point, and, therefore, that the continuity does not 
solely suffice for the pointwise convergence of the Fourier series. We shall 
present a different example due to Lipot Fejer (1880-1959). Starting from 
this example one can show continuous functions whose Fourier series do 
not converge in a denumerable dense set, for instance, the rationals. In 
the 1920's Audrey Kolmogorov (1903-1987) showed a continuous function 
with Fourier series divergent on a set with the power of the continuum, and 
Hugo Steinhaus (1887-1972) showed a continuous function whose Fourier 
series converges pointwise everywhere, but does not converge uniformly 
in any interval. Eventually, the question was clarified in 1962 by Lennart 
Carleson. Here we collect some complements. 
a. The Dirichlet-Jordan test 
11.91 Theorem (Dirichlet-Jordan). Let f be a 27r-periodic function 
with bounded total variation in [a, 6]. 
(i) For every x e]a,b[ we have Snf{x) 
-^ {L'^ -h L~)/2 where L^ := 
\imy_,^±f{y). 
(ii) // / is also continuous in ]a, b[, then Snf{x) 
-^ f{x) uniformly in 
any closed interval strictly contained in]a^b[.

Proof. Let [a, b] be an interval with b — a < 2IT. Since every function with bounded 
variation in [a, 6] is the sum of an increasing function and of a decreasing function, we 
may also assume that / is nondecreasing in [a, b]. 
(i) Let X G]a,6[, gx{t) := f{x + t) - L+ + f{x - t) - L- where L± := lim^_,^± f{y).

where 5 > 0 is to be chosen later. Since f(x + t) — L^ and ~{f{x 
— t) — L ) are 
nondecreasing near t = 0 and nonnegative, the second theorem of mean value and 
(11.42) yield 
|/i| < 2n \f{x + (5) - L+l + |/(x -S)-L-\ 
(11.53) 
while (11.43) yields 
\l2\<c{S)-. 
(11.54) 
n 
Therefore, given e > 0, we can choose S > 0 in such a way that 
\f(x-\-S)-L-^\ 
+ 
\f{x-S)-L-\<e 
to obtain from (11.53) and (11.54) that 
\Snf(x) -^^~^ 
I 
<27re~\-c{S)^. 
That proves the pointwise convergence at x. 
(ii) In this case for every x G [a, 6], we have L+ = L~ = f(x) and it suffices to estimate 
uniformly in [a + cr, 6 - cr], 0 < a < (6 — a)/2, h and /2 in (11.52). Since / is uniformly 
continuous in [a, 6], given e > 0, we can choose S, 0 < S < a, in such a way that 
\f{x -\- S) — f{x)\ + \f{x — S) — f(x)\ < e, uniformly with respect to x in [a -\- a^b — a], 
hence from (11.53) | / i | < 27re uniformly in [a-\- cr,b — a]. The uniform estimate of IJ2I 
is instead the claim of Proposition 11.83. 
Finally, if 6 — a > 27r, it suffices to write [a, 6] as a finite union of intervals of length 
less than 27r and apply the above to them. 
• 
11.92 Remark. Notice that the Dirichlet-Jordan theorem is in fact a 
claim on monotone functions. Monotone functions are continuous except 
on a denumerable set of jump points, that is not necessarily discrete.
