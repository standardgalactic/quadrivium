Dedication
We would like to dedicate this book to the backbone of the U.S. economy, 
namely the tens of thousands of business owners, managers, and 
entrepreneurs that battle every day to make their companies succeed.  
Remember that while the deck at times may seem stacked against you during 
these trying economic times, your spirit cannot be deterred. Our simple 
hope is that for those of you experiencing cash flow problems or just simply 
looking to understand cash flows a little better, this book can help ease 
your pain and offer additional insight on how to improve and manage your 
business interests.
We also want to mention who this book is not dedicated to: the politicians 
in Washington and across the U.S. and the banksters that have lost sight of 
what it means to create, launch, build, and operate a business. Simply put, 
these parties have spent too much time managing other people’s hard-earned 
money and not enough time creating real value, wealth, and opportunity. 
Think of the Grinch from the wonderful story by Dr. Seuss, How the Grinch 
Stole Christmas. The Grinch attempted to “steal” Christmas by taking all of the 
trees, presents, decorations, and whatever else was available from Whoville. 
Yet Christmas still came, and it was then that the Grinch realized that 
“Maybe, just maybe, Christmas meant a little bit more.” When the politicians 
and banksters finally realize that maybe, just maybe, owning a business and 
risking everything one has to pursue a dream means just a little bit more, the 
unparalleled historical disconnect between the twin Ws (Washington and 
Wall Street) and Main Street America will begin to evaporate, allowing for real 
growth to resume.
From Tage Tracy: I would like to dedicate this book to my old man and 
coauthor (or as I refer to him, TOP,  or The Old Pro). About seven years 
ago, my dad, in a manner reminiscent of Vito Corleone of The Godfather, 
made me an offer I couldn’t refuse: Take over the family business or else. 
(Thank goodness we didn’t own a horse, but I was concerned about our cat 
from time to time). In this case, the family business involved carrying on 
his remarkable and deeply insightful legacy of being able to translate even 
the most complex and difficult accounting and financial concepts into easy-
to-comprehend layman’s terms. As for the “else,” well let’s just say that the 
old man has threatened to ditch me from his will more than once (a running 
joke in our family). I am forever grateful for the opportunity to write with and 
learn from TOP.

ash Flow For Dummies explains how cash flows in the business setting. 
In broad terms, cash flow refers to generating or producing cash (cash 
inflows) and using or consuming cash (cash outflows). As such, maybe the 
simplest way to view cash flows are to consider them the blood of the 
business, and you must keep that blood circulating at all times in order 
avoid failure or death. So the first rule is that you can’t run out of cash, no 
more than you can run out of blood, and although you might be able to go 
on cash flow life support for a short time, the outcome of this strategy is 
almost always extremely painful. In addition to explaining the basics of cash 
flow, this book then tackles numerous issues on how to improve cash flow 
and manage this invaluable resource more efficiently. Continuing the analogy 
of cash flow being the blood of the business, we assist you in keeping your 
arteries free and clear of any potential blockages to ensure that your blood 
flows freely and that your business’s health is protected at all times.
In large business organizations, cash-flow duties are delegated to finance 
professionals. In small businesses, and even in many midsize businesses, 
managers and owners have to take a more direct role in cash-flow affairs, and 
this area of business management isn’t always easy to navigate. That’s why 
we’re here to help.
Cash flow is both clear and opaque. Borrowing money from a bank is an 
obvious source of cash. But when should you borrow money, what payment 
terms should you negotiate, and what are the risks of debt? Our book provides 
practical answers for the fundamental cash-flow questions facing every 
business. We explain the crucial difference between recording a profit, which 
is an accounting measure, and generating cash flow from that profit. Many 
business managers confuse profit and cash flow, which can have serious 
consequences. With this book at hand, you’ll be prepared to handle cash flow 
in an efficient and profitable way.
About This Book
Cash Flow For Dummies aims to help managers and owners of small and 
midsize business who have direct involvement in the cash flows of their 
business. We also provide very useful information for business lenders and 
investors. Although business finance professionals may find fresh insights 
in this book, this book sticks to essentials, and we don’t delve into technical 
areas.

Cash Flow For Dummies 
Business managers are very busy people; they have to carefully budget their 
time. Small business owners/managers are especially busy people; they have 
little time to spare. We promise not to waste your time with this book. In 
every chapter, we cut to the chase and avoid detours. We restrict our 
discussions to fundamentals — topics you must know to handle the cash-flow 
affairs of your business.
This book is not like a mystery novel; you can read the chapters in any order. 
You may have more interest in one chapter than others, so you can begin 
with the chapters that have highest priority to you. Where a topic overlaps 
with a topic in another chapter, we provide a cross-reference.
By all means, use the book as a reference manual. Put it on your desk and 
refer to it as the need arises. It’s your book, so you can mark topics with 
comments in the margins or place sticky notes on pages you refer to often. 
This book isn’t a college textbook. You don’t have to memorize things for 
exams. The only test is whether you improve your skills for managing the 
cash flow of your business.
Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout this book we use examples to explain cash flow, most of which 
are illustrated with financial statements or elements of financial statements. 
We make the examples as true to life as we can without getting bogged down 
in too many details. Our examples are hypothetical, but they come from the 
real world of business.
As you may know, financial statements are based on standardized accounting 
methods and terminology. It’s been said many times that accounting is the 
language of business. You may not be entirely comfortable with financial 
statements and the methods and jargon of accountants. We understand 
your predicament. Throughout the book we take care to use plain English in 
explaining financial statements and accounting methods.
In this book, we distinguish between the internal accountant, who is an 
employee of your business, and the outside, independent accounting 
professional who advises you from time to time. A small business employs 
an accountant who is in charge of its accounting system. The employee’s job 
title may be controller, in-charge accountant, or office manager. In this book, 
the term accountant refers to the person on your payroll. We refer to your 
independent professional accountant as a CPA (certified public accountant).
As for formatting conventions, we use italic to introduce new terms that are 
defined. We also use italic to reference information listed in figures.

 Introduction
What You’re Not to Read
We occasionally go off on tangents or offer anecdotes in gray boxes called 
sidebars. These sidebars offer interesting but nonessential information, so 
you can skip them if you like.
Not every topic may have you sitting on the edge of your seat. For example, 
you may already have a good grasp on the three primary financial statements 
of a business — the income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement 
of cash flows. If so, you may not be terribly interested in Chapter 3, which 
introduces these three financial statements. (But be sure that you understand 
the statement of cash flows!) You can skip over topics that aren’t immediately 
relevant or urgent; you won’t hurt our feelings.
We suspect that a few topics in the book are more detailed than you’re 
interested in. For example, you may find that the details of the technique 
discussed in Chapter 6 for analyzing cash flow from profit is not practical for 
your business because it deviates from the standard methods of accountants. 
You may simply skim over the technique, and reconsider it at a later time.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, we’ve done our best to put ourselves in your shoes as 
a manager of a small or midsize business who has responsibilities for cash 
flow. Of course, we don’t know you personally. But we have a good composite 
profile of you based on our experience in consulting with small business 
managers and explaining cash-flow issues to business managers who have a 
limited background in financial matters.
Perhaps you’ve attended a short course in finance for the nonfinance manager, 
which would give you a leg up for reading this book. We should mention that 
many of these short courses focus mainly on financial statement analysis and 
don’t explore the broader range of cash-flow management issues that owners 
and managers of smaller-size businesses have to deal with.
However, we take nothing for granted and start our discussions at ground 
zero. We present the material from the foundation up. The more you already 
know about the topics, the quicker you can move through the discussion. 
Whether you’re a neophyte or veteran, you can discover useful insights and 
knowledge in this book. If nothing else, the book is a checklist of the things 
you ought to know for managing the cash flow of your business.

Cash Flow For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into parts, and each part is divided into chapters. The 
following sections describe what you find in each part.
Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big 
Picture of Running a Business
Part I explains the crucial importance of managing cash flow to avoid running 
out of cash and to keep your business financially viable. The continued 
existence of a business depends on a healthy rhythm of cash flow. Cash flow 
from making profit is the starting point. The first two chapters explain the 
important difference between accrual-basis accounting that’s used in 
recording revenue and expenses and the cash flows of revenue and expenses. 
Also, the three basic financials statements of a business are reviewed with 
special emphasis on the statement of cash flows.
Part II: Using Financial Statements 
to Assess Cash Health
Part II offers chapters that take you on a walk through the balance sheet from 
the cash-flow point of view. As you probably know, this financial statement 
summarizes the assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity of the business. The 
cash-flow aspects of assets and liabilities are typically overlooked or not 
understood well. Business managers need to astutely understand the cash-flow 
aspects of every asset and liability. Also, we take the particular assets and 
liabilities from the balance sheet that affect cash flow from profit and use 
them to build a technique for analyzing the difference between cash flow and 
bottom-line profit in the income (profit and loss) statement.
Part III: Getting Intimate with Your 
Company’s Cash Flow Needs
To begin this part of the book, we explain the importance of developing a 
viable and realistic business plan, one that lays the foundation for the 
business and that serves as the key document in raising capital to start and 
grow a business. A business has to demonstrate clear thinking when it comes 
to raising cash from lenders and investors, and its clearheaded thinking must 
show through in its business plan. This part of our book takes a hard but 
realistic look at the two basic sources of business capital: debt and equity.

 Introduction
Part IV: Managing Your Business 
with Cash Flow in Mind
Part IV gets down to the nuts and bolts of managing cash flows. The first two 
chapters explain the day-to-day management details of keeping cash flowing 
and preventing cash losses from embezzlement and fraud. The last two 
chapters explain how to squeeze more cash flow from the two basic cycles 
of business: the selling cycle and the disbursement cycle. Managers often 
overlook the potential cash-flow benefits from paying more attention to the 
cash-related aspects of these two basic operating cycles.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is a staple in every For Dummies book. These chapters offer 
pithy lists of advice related to the main points of the chapters. One chapter 
summarizes ten cash-flow management rules for the small business (that 
apply to larger businesses as well, we should mention). The final chapter in 
this part of the book tells ten tales of cash-flow woes.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, you see some little pictures in the margins. These 
icons highlight the following types of information:
	
This icon asks you to keep in mind an important point that is central in the 
explanation of the topic at hand.
	
This icon serves as a bookmark tagging an extremely significant concept.
	
As you may surmise, this icon serves as a “yellow light” that the going gets 
a little heavier here. You may have to slow down and read this stuff more 
carefully and ponder it more than usual. However, this information isn’t 
critical to understanding the basic concept.
	
This icon highlights, well, tips for understanding, analyzing, and managing 
cash flow. These pointers and advisories are worth highlighting with a yellow 
marker so you don’t forget them. On second thought, this icon saves you the 
cost of buying a highlighter pen.

concept or point we happen to be discussing.
	
This icon calls out terminology that is frequently used in the accounting and 
finance world.
	
This sign warns you about speed bumps and potholes on the cash-flow 
highway. Taking special note of this material can steer you around a financial 
road hazard and keep you from blowing a fiscal tire. You can save yourself a 
lot of trouble by paying attention to these warning signs.
Where to Go from Here
Many small business managers and owners are confused (or if not confused, 
then not entirely sure) about earning profit on the one hand and squeezing 
out cash flow from profit on the other hand. For that matter, many managers 
of larger businesses are confused about profit and cash flow. If you are in this 
state of mind, you should start with Chapter 1, where we distinguish between 
revenue and expenses that you see in a profit report and the cash flows of 
revenue and expenses. Chapter 2 is the logical next step, which explains why 
accrual accounting is necessary for measuring revenue and expenses.
You may need to review business financial statements. If so, then by all 
means read Chapter 3. You can start with that chapter, but you’ll probably 
get more use out of it after you have absorbed the captivating topics in 
Chapters 1 and 2. You may already have a solid understanding of accrual 
accounting (be certain that you do) and you may already have a good 
understanding of the balance sheet and income statement of businesses. 
In this case, you may want to charge directly ahead to Chapter 4, which 
explains the statement of cash flows.
After Part I, you can take a more cafeteria-style approach and read the 
chapters in Parts II, III, and IV as you prefer. One or more chapters may have 
particular interest to you, such as Chapter 14, on the “ground rules” for using 
debt, or Chapter 8, on creating a business plan with cash flow foremost in 
mind. Feel free to jump around. However, we recommend saving the chapters 
in Part V for dessert, after enjoying a full meal of other chapters.

e begin with the first rule of business — you can’t 
run out of cash. Business managers and owners 
need to understand cash flow. The logical place to start is 
cash flow from making profit. When you read about reve­
nue and expenses in an income statement (also known as a 
profit and loss report), you aren’t reading cash-flow numbers. 
The cash flows of revenue and expenses are different, and 
you’d better know why.
Business managers and owners need to know how to read 
their three basic financial statements from the cash-flow 
point of view, and that includes having a sure grip on the 
statement of cash flows and how it connects with the 
balance sheet and income statement. Ignoring cash flow is 
not an option in managing a business — unless you have 
more cash than you know what to do with. Many businesses 
operate with a razor-thin cash balance, so understanding 
cash flow should be a top priority.

I

n running a business, you have to follow many rules, but one rule stands 
above the others: Don’t run out of cash. As obvious as you may think this 
rule is, the importance and difficulty of maintaining an adequate cash balance 
are generally taken for granted in business management books and articles. 
Many business managers ignore cash until a serious problem pops up. They 
assume that cash will take care of itself, as if cash could be put on automatic 
pilot. Nothing is farther from the truth. If you don’t pay attention to cash, you 
may be in for a nasty surprise.
To control cash, you must control cash inflows and cash outflows. To do 
that, you need cash-flow information, and you need to know how well your 
current cash balance stacks up against the short-term demands on cash. 
Managers depend on regular accounting reports for financial information; in 
particular, their monthly income statement (also called the profit and loss, or 
P&L, report). However, the income statement doesn’t provide the cash-flow 
information you need.
You must turn to another financial statement for cash-flow information, 
appropriately called the statement of cash flows. But here is where things get 
rather befuddling for the business manager. The cash-flow statement lists 
adjustments to profit to arrive at the cash flow from making profit. It assumes 
that the reader has a good basic understanding of profit accounting and, 
therefore, knows why adjustments are necessary to find cash flow. But in our 
experience, business managers do not fully understand how their accountants 
measure profit, which makes understanding cash flow and why it’s higher or 
lower than profit very difficult.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
This chapter starts by pointing out the catastrophic consequences of running 
out of cash. Next, we offer a brief review of profit accounting and the assets 
and liabilities that are used in recording revenue and expenses. Changes in 
these assets and liabilities are the reasons why cash flow differs from profit. 
Then the chapter takes the first steps in explaining the cash-flow aspects of 
making profit and why cash flow is invariably higher or lower than the bottom-
line profit or loss number in the income statement. We also explain the 
cash-flow side of business transactions and the basic classes of cash flows.
Not Letting the Well Run Dry
One morning you arrive at your business. As usual, you’re the first person 
to arrive. But none of your employees come to work. Not one. Who will open 
the doors for customers? Who will sell your products? Who will start tapping 
on the computers? This scenario may seem like a nightmare, but it’s not the 
worst thing that can happen to a business.
Here’s the real fiasco you should worry about: One day your accountant 
rushes into your office and tells you that the business’s bank account balance 
is zero. You have $50 in petty cash and a small amount of currency in the 
cash registers. But that’s it. Your checking account is empty. You can’t cut 
any checks to your vendors, who will cut off your credit if not paid on time. 
You have a sizable payroll to meet in two days. If not paid, your employees 
will quit. And your bank is sure to notice that your checking account balance 
is zip and may consider shutting down your credit line. It’s not a pretty 
picture, is it?
	
A zero cash balance puts you on the edge of a cliff. One false step and you 
can fall off and be unable to recover. When your suppliers, employees, and 
sources of capital find out about your cash problems — and they will — your 
credibility drops to zero. The businesses and various people you deal with 
depend on your ability to continue as a going business that they can rely on 
in the future. Running out of cash would pull the rug out from under the 
reputation of your business that you worked so hard to build up over the 
years. You could lose your business to creditors or have to declare bankruptcy.
Running out of cash is an extreme, worst-case scenario, although it’s a threat 
many businesses face. The purpose of mentioning it here is to emphasize its 
disaster potential for a business. Running out of cash is not just a life-changing 
event for a business; it can be a life-ending event. Business managers should 
never let their guard down regarding cash and cash flows.

 Chapter 1: Getting in Sync with the Rhythm of Cash
Surprisingly, many business managers, small-business owners/mangers in 
particular, do not take an aggressive, proactive approach toward controlling 
cash. Instead of learning cash-flow fundamentals and techniques of controlling 
cash flows, they retreat into a passive mode. But very few businesses have 
the luxury of sitting on hoards of cash such that they really don’t have to 
worry about the cash balance period to period. Many businesses operate on 
a razor-thin cash balance.
Outlining Profit Accounting Basics
	
The best way to avoid cash-flow problems and to generate a stream of cash 
flow is to earn profit. Measuring profit (or loss) is the job of your accountant. 
Each period your accountant prepares an income statement that summarizes 
revenue and expenses and profit (or loss) for the period. To understand cash 
flow emanating from profit, you need to understand how your accountant 
records revenue and expenses. Otherwise you’ll be confused about why your 
cash flow from profit during the period is different from your profit for the 
period. You don’t have to delve into the technical aspects of revenue and 
expense accounting — just understand the basics. This section gives you the 
brief overview you need to go forward with managing cash flow.
We’re optimistic that you know that profit is the excess of revenue over 
expenses (and loss is the excess of expenses over revenue). We mention it 
simply to stress that profit accounting really refers to revenue and expense 
accounting. Profit (or loss) is just the residual number left over after 
recording revenue and expenses for the period.
The brief discussion of revenue and expense accounting in this section is no 
more than dipping our toes in the water. Profit accounting involves much, 
much more than this very brief introduction covers. We go into more details 
later in this chapter in and future chapters. For a more extensive explanation of 
accounting methods and problems, see Accounting For Dummies, 4th Edition, 
by John A. Tracy (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
Reviewing revenue accounting
When a sale is made for “cash on the barrelhead,” to use an old expression, 
cash increases and the accountant increases the sales revenue account 
the same amount. At the retail level, most sales are for cash; currency and 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
12
Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
coins are received by the business, or a credit or debit card is accepted that 
almost immediately increases the cash account of the business. In contrast, 
many businesses sell on credit, especially to other businesses. No money is 
collected from the customer until a month or so after the sale. In those cases, 
the accountant records the sale immediately by increasing an asset account 
called accounts receivable and increases sales revenue the same amount. 
When the customer pays later, cash is increased and the accounts receivable 
asset is decreased. Notice the time lag between the two events — point one 
when the sale is recorded and point two when the cash is received.
Revenue accounting can be much more complicated than recording simple 
cash and credit sales. For example, some businesses collect cash from 
customers before delivering the product or service, such as newspapers 
that collect subscriptions in advance before delivering the papers, and 
insurance companies that collect premiums before the insurance period 
coverage begins. But in any case, recording revenue is coupled with a 
corresponding increase in an asset or, in some cases, a decrease in a liability.
Examining expense accounting
A business records many expenses by decreasing cash and increasing an 
expense account, such as paying the monthly utility bill for gas and electricity. 
This transaction is straightforward enough: Cash decreases and an expense 
account increases the same amount. But many expenses are more complicated. 
Perhaps an expense is recorded before cash is actually paid out, or it may be 
recorded sometime after cash has been paid out.
	
Recording an expense is coupled with a corresponding decrease in an asset 
or an increase in a liability. For example, a business receives a bill from its 
lawyer for work already done. The appropriate expense account (legal fees) is 
increased, and a liability account called accounts payable is increased. When 
the bill is paid later, cash is decreased and the accounts payable liability is 
decreased.
When a business buys products that it will sell later to its customers, it 
increases an asset account called inventory. Suppose the purchase is on 
credit from the vendor. The inventory asset account is increased, and the 
accounts payable liability account is increased. When the goods are sold — 
but not until then — the inventory asset account is decreased for the cost of 
products sold and the expense account cost of goods is sold is increased the 
same amount.
Usually a business pays its vendor before it sells the products to its customers. 
However, in some cases a business may sell products to its customers before 
it pays the supplier of the products.

 Chapter 1: Getting in Sync with the Rhythm of Cash
Here’s another example of an important expense: Suppose a business bought 
a delivery truck three years ago and paid for it then. The cost of the truck 
is recorded as an increase in an asset account. Then each year the truck is 
used, a fraction of the total cost of the truck is recorded to expense, which 
amount is recorded as a decrease in the asset account. That portion of the 
original cost charged to expense in the year is called depreciation expense, 
and we discuss its cash-flow aspects in the later section “Depreciation 
expense.”
Contrasting cash- and accrual-basis 
accounting
For most businesses, profit accounting (recording revenue and expenses) 
involves much more than just recording cash inflows and cash outflows. 
Recording only cash inflows and outflows is not acceptable for most businesses 
and, in fact, would be seriously misleading. That type of accounting, called 
cash-basis accounting, doesn’t fit how most businesses carry on their 
profit-making activities or how businesses raise and invest capital.
	
Under cash-basis accounting, revenue and expenses are recorded when the 
cash flow happens. Revenue is recorded when cash is received, and expenses 
are recorded when cash payments are made — not before and not after. Some 
small businesses that tend to operate through straightforward transactions 
get by with cash-basis accounting. Federal income-tax law allows cash-basis 
accounting for businesses that meet certain conditions. Generally, cash-basis 
accounting is acceptable only for relatively small businesses that don’t buy or 
sell on credit and that don’t make investments in operating assets.
Most businesses of any size and complexity buy and/or sell on credit and 
make sizable investments in long-term operating assets (buildings, machinery, 
and the like). For these businesses, cash-basis accounting is woefully 
inadequate. Instead, they use accrual-basis accounting. (How well they use 
it is another matter.) Fundamentally, accrual-basis accounting means that 
several assets other than cash and several liabilities are used in recording 
revenue and expenses.
	
Accrual is not a particularly good descriptive term. In accounting jargon, it 
doesn’t mean accumulation, accretion, growth, or enlargement. In the field 
of accounting, the term accrual refers to recording revenue and expenses (as 
well as the resultant increases and decreases in assets and liabilities) at the 
time that economic exchanges and business transactions take place. The cash 
flows of many transactions occur before or after the transaction — perhaps 
a few days, maybe a month, or even years before or after recording revenue 
and expenses. Accrual-basis accounting is on one timetable; cash flows are on 
another timetable.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
Seeing Why Profit and Cash Flow 
Are Different Bottom Lines
You often hear that a business “made money,” meaning that it earned a 
profit. But earning a profit does not mean that the business’s cash balance 
went up the same amount. In fact, earning profit can sometimes cause the 
cash balance to decrease. To keep the business healthy, managers need to 
differentiate the two numbers and understand the importance of each.
	
The income statement of a business (a key accounting report also called the 
P&L report, earnings statement, statement of operations, and other titles) 
summarizes the revenue and expenses of a business for a period of time. The 
last line of the statement is the profit or loss for the period. The cash increase 
(or decrease) from making the profit is a different matter. Many business 
managers mistakenly assume that profit reported in this statement means 
the cash balance increases the same amount — a potentially dangerous 
misperception.
In this section, we discuss what information you can glean from the income 
statement, what info you can’t, and why you need to keep an eye on more 
than one bottom line.
Considering what the income statement 
doesn’t say about cash flow
Figure 1-1 presents the most recent annual income statement of your friendly 
hardware store. We keep the number of lines in this income statement 
example to a minimum, to focus attention on fundamentals. Also, the 
dollar amounts are rounded off. (Following common practice, numbers in 
parentheses mean a decrease by that amount; numbers not in parentheses 
mean an increase.) The figures for revenue and expenses are in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting standards, and you can assume that 
they’re free of fraud or deliberate distortion.
The business sells a wide variety of products to retail customers who pay 
cash or use credit and debit cards, which the business converts into cash 
almost immediately. The hardware store also sells to other businesses. Its 
basic business model is to mark up the costs of products (called “goods”) it 
buys to earn enough total gross margin to cover its operating, depreciation, 
and interest expenses, and to provide profit. As you see in Figure 1-1, the 
business earned $600,000 bottom-line profit for the year just ended, which 
equals sales revenue minus all expenses. As an aside, you may notice that 
profit equals 5 percent of sales revenue ($600,000 profit/$12,000,000 sales 
revenue = 5%), which means that expenses are 95 percent of sales revenue.

The income statement by itself doesn’t report how much of sales revenue 
was collected in cash during the year. Consider the $12 million sales revenue 
amount, for instance. This accrual-basis accounting amount may be relatively 
close to the actual cash inflow from sales during the year — but then again, it 
may not be. Most of the total annual sales revenue probably has been collected 
in cash through the end of the year, but some of it probably hasn’t been 
collected in cash yet at that time. In this case, cash flow from sales would be 
less than sales revenue. (We explain cash flow from revenue in the next 
section, “Exploring cash flow from profit.”)
Likewise, the income statement by itself does not report how much of each 
expense was paid in cash during the year. You don’t see in the income 
statement the impact of expenses on the particular assets and liabilities used 
to record the expenses. The amount of an expense may be relatively close 
to the actual cash outflow for the expense — but maybe not. One expense 
in particular is important to understand in this regard because it is a noncash 
expense: depreciation. Depreciation recorded on the income statement involves 
no cash outlay at any point. In contrast, other expenses are intertwined with 
cash. (We also explain cash flow for expenses in the next section.)
The actual cash flows of revenue and expenses differ from the accrual-basis 
amounts reported in the income statement for most businesses. Therefore, 
the bottom-line profit number does not indicate the increase in cash from 
making profit. Cash flow can be about the same, or can be considerably lower 
or higher than profit.

The cash flows of revenue and most expenses in Figure 1-2 are different 
from the accrual-basis numbers in the income statement (in Figure 1-1). The 
income statement reports the correct profit for the period, $600,000 in the 
example. The cash-flows summary shows actual cash flows of revenue and 
expenses, and it turns out that net cash flow for the year is $400,000, which 
is $200,000 lower than profit for the year. This discrepancy isn’t unusual and 
doesn’t in any way imply that profit has not been accounted for correctly.
Here’s a quick summary of the differences between the income statement 
amounts and the cash flows of revenue and expenses in thousands.

A negative number (shown in parentheses) means that cash inflow from 
revenue is lower than the accrual-basis number in the income statement, or that 
cash outflow for an expense is higher than the number in the income statement. 
A positive number (without parentheses) means that cash inflow from revenue 
is higher than the accrual-basis number in the income statement, or that cash 
outflow for an expense is lower than the number in the income statement.
Because these numbers are different, business managers need to keep an eye 
on both cash flows and accrual-basis revenue and expenses. You could say 
that the business manager needs bifocals — one level for focusing on cash

 Chapter 1: Getting in Sync with the Rhythm of Cash
flow and one level for profit — because cash flow can get out of control even 
when profit performance is acceptable. For example, a business may allow its 
uncollected receivables from credit sales to balloon way out of proportion to 
the growth in sales. Or a business may overstock its inventory of products, 
resulting in slow-moving products (that take too long to sell). Business survival 
depends both on making profit and controlling the cash flow outcomes of 
making profit. Like riding a bicycle, a business needs to keep both the 
cash-flow wheel and the profit wheel turning.
In the following sections, we offer brief explanations for each of the cash-flow 
amounts in Figure 1-2, explaining why the cash-flow amount differs from the 
income statement amount.
Cash inflow from sales
The reason cash inflow from sales revenue is $250,000 less than sales revenue 
for the year is that the company’s accounts receivable balance increased 
$250,000 during the year. The balance in this asset account is the total of 
uncollected credit sales. The sales were recorded in sales revenue but were 
not collected in cash by the end of the year. In short, the business made 
$250,000 in credit sales that it has not yet collected. This amount counts 
toward profit but won’t turn into cash inflow until the customers pay for their 
purchases next year.
Cash outflow for products
The reason cash outflow for products is $300,000 more than cost of goods 
sold expense for the year is that the business increased its inventory of 
products (goods) being held for sale. The inventory asset account holds 
the cost of products purchased or manufactured until the goods are sold, at 
which time the business decreases the asset account and records the cost of 
the items sold. The $300,000 inventory increase was paid for during the year, 
but the cost of these goods will not be charged to expense until next year 
when the products are sold.
Cash outflow for operations
Cash outflow for operations is $150,000 less than the amount of operating 
expenses for the year because the business increased its payables for these 
costs $150,000 during the year. Many operating costs are not paid for 
immediately. The expenses are recorded when the obligation to pay becomes 
fixed on the business (when the business incurs the liability to pay the 
expense). The expenses are not paid until four to six weeks later. For example, 
a business records advertising expense as soon as the ads are run in the local 
newspaper, even though the newspaper will not be paid until weeks later.
The obligations for these expenses are recorded in liability accounts. During 
the year, the balances in these liability accounts increased $150,000. The 
business will not pay these liabilities until next year.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
Depreciation expense
	
Depreciation expense is a prime example of accrual-basis accounting — of 
recording an expense in the period benefited rather than when cash is paid 
out. The assets being depreciated were bought and paid for sometime in the 
past. These assets last many years. Thus, the cost of a long-lived asset is 
recorded as an investment. No expense is recorded until the business starts 
using the asset in its operations. The costs of these long-term or fixed assets 
are allocated over the years the assets are used. The business doesn’t make a 
second cash payment when recording depreciation expense. Depreciation is 
not a cash outlay in the period the expense is recorded.
Depreciation accounting methods get rather involved, and this chapter isn’t 
the place to go into a lengthy discussion on depreciation accounting. The 
main point is that a fraction of the cost of a long-lived operating asset — such 
as a delivery truck, a building, or a computer — is recorded as a decrease 
in the asset account and the amount is charged to depreciation expense. 
The business doesn’t write a check for depreciation; no cash is involved in 
recording deprecation expense. Depreciation is a real expense because the 
long-term operating assets wear out and lose their economic usefulness. 
Eventually these assets are traded in, sold, or sent to the junkyard.
From the cash-flow point of view, depreciation is a zero outlay expense. In 
recording depreciation, the recorded cost value of the asset is decreased 
and the amount is charged to depreciation expense. Depreciation expense is 
deducted from revenue like other expenses to determine profit. But from the 
cash-flow point of view, there is nothing to deduct. So in Figure 1-2, the cash 
outflow for depreciation is zero.
	
Don’t simply add back deprecation expense to bottom-line profit and call this 
amount cash flow. This practice may appear to be a convenient shortcut to 
finding cash flow, but it isn’t. In this example, cash flow would be $800,000 
because $600,000 net income + $200,000 depreciation expense = $800,000. In 
fact, cash flow from profit for the year is only $400,000 because of the other 
factors that determine cash flow (refer to Figure 1-2). You should consider all 
the factors that impact cash flow from profit.
Interest expense
The cash outlay for interest in the example in Figure 1-2 is exactly equal to 
the interest expense for the year. No difference between the two amounts 
means that the business paid the exact interest that was owed on its debt 
during the year. Interest is one of the few expenses for which cash payments 
often are equal to (or very nearly equal to) the amount of expense that is 
recorded in the year. On the other hand, if the business had not paid all its 
interest that had accumulated during the period, it would record the unpaid 
amount in a liability account in order to pick up the full amount of interest 
expense for the year and to recognize its obligation to pay the additional 
unpaid amount of interest.

 Chapter 1: Getting in Sync with the Rhythm of Cash
Identifying and Reporting Basic 
Types of Cash Activities
Until a generation ago, explicit cash-flow information was not included in the 
external financial reports of businesses. Sophisticated financial statement 
users could do cash-flow analysis, but it was a burdensome and time-consuming 
process. Under pressure from financial analysts and others, the rule-making 
body of the accounting profession decided that henceforth a statement of 
cash flows should be included in external financial reports to supplement the 
income statement and balance sheet.
Cash-flow information is useful to users of financial reports, who are primarily 
business managers, investors, and creditors. Both public and private 
companies are required to include a statement of cash flows in their external 
financial reports. By law, publicly owned corporations must make their 
financial reports available to the public at large. Private companies, on the 
other hand, generally limit circulation of their financial reports to their 
investors and lenders. They treat their financial reports as confidential. 
Internally, businesses can report information however they want, but in 
general, internal accounting reports look a lot like the external financial 
statements of the business.
Depreciation expense versus losses 
from nonrecurring write-downs of assets
Depreciation expense is based on a 
predetermined, systematic method. When a 
depreciable asset is bought or constructed, 
its cost is recorded in an asset account. The 
accountant estimates its future useful life to the 
business and chooses a method to allocate the 
cost to each year of expected use. Depreciation 
is not a cash outlay in the year in which 
depreciation expense is recorded. The cash 
outlay occurred in its entirety when the asset 
was acquired.
In contrast, a business may have to record 
an unexpected write-down in the recorded 
value of an asset. The write-down was not 
predetermined and is not factored according to 
any systematic plan. For example, a business 
may suffer irreparable damage to its building 
from an earthquake. Assuming that insurance 
doesn’t cover this risk, the business records an 
entry to reduce the recorded value of the asset 
to zero and records a loss of equal amount. The 
loss is reported as an extraordinary item in the 
income statement. The loss reduces the profit 
of the business, of course, but it doesn’t involve 
cash outlay. Like depreciation, recording the 
loss does not decrease the cash balance of the 
business.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
For external financial reporting, accountants divide cash flows into three 
groupings or types, which we discuss in the following sections. In fact, these 
three classes constitute the three parts of the statement of cash flows, as we 
explain further in Chapter 4.
Cash flow from investing activities
One group of cash flows contains the investing and “disinvesting” activities 
of the business during the year. As you would think, investing refers to the 
expenditure of cash for investments in different assets. Most years (except in 
severe downturns), businesses make new investments to replace and expand 
long-term operating assets, such as buildings, building improvements, land, 
machinery, manufacturing equipment, vehicles, and information-processing 
equipment. These cash outlays are referred to as capital expenditures. The 
term capital is used to stress the long-term commitment of these investments 
in assets that will be used in the operations of the business.
Companies also invest in intangible assets, such as patents and trademarks. 
A business may buy all the ownership shares or a controlling interest of 
another business and pay for a goodwill asset. A business may invest in 
marketable securities, either short term or long term. Or a business may 
invest in ownership instruments that are not readily marketable. We suppose 
a business could even invest in pork-belly futures contracts if it wanted to 
(and meat processers do). The law allows a business to invest in almost 
anything (that’s legal).
	
During the year, the business may sell or otherwise dispose of some of its 
investments. The cash inflows from these disinvestments are included in the 
investment category. So the category includes both cash outflows and cash 
inflows. The buying and selling of marketable securities can be a major source 
of income for a business. In contrast, long-term tangible and intangible assets 
that are used in the operations of a business are not sold off very often, except 
when the assets reach the end of their useful lives or when the business has to 
downsize its scale of operations.
Cash flow from financing activities
The term financing refers to securing capital and returning capital to its 
sources. We discuss capital sources in Chapters 10 and 11. Basically, the two 
sources of capital to a business are equity and debt. Equity refers to ownership 
capital invested in a business. For example, a business corporation issues 
shares of capital stock to individuals willing to put their money in the 
business. The business may or may not be able to pay its shareowners for 
the use of their money, depending on whether it makes a profit and whether 
it generates enough cash flow from profit to make a cash distribution. Equity

 Chapter 1: Getting in Sync with the Rhythm of Cash
can be simple (just one class of ownership shares) or incredibility complex, 
and it depends on the legal organization of the business. (We discuss equity 
sources in Chapter 10.)
Debt refers to money borrowed from banks and other business lenders, and 
even credit cards used by the business. Businesses pay interest for the use 
of the debt capital. The debt is either paid back or renewed on the maturity 
date of the loan. The business signs a note payable or a similar legal 
instrument to the lender. (Chapter 11 explores debt in more detail.)
	
Interest paid on debt capital is reported as an expense in the income statement, 
so the bottom-line profit is after interest expense is deducted. In contrast, a 
cash distribution from profit that is paid to shareowners for the use of their 
equity capital is not treated as an expense. (Cash distributions from profit by 
corporations are called dividends.) Bottom-line net income is calculated before 
making distributions to shareowners. The amount of cash distributions from 
profit to shareowners is included in the financing category of cash flows.
Cash flow from operating 
(profit-making) activities
The third class of cash flow is the profit-making activities of the business. 
Investing and financing activities constitute only a small fraction of the total 
activities of a business during the year. Over 95 percent, maybe 99 percent, 
of the action in a business has to do with operating activities: making sales, 
acquiring products for sale, hiring employees, and all the other things that 
are done to make a profit.
The cash flows of the operating activities during the year can be reported 
the same way as the summary of cash flows shown in Figure 1-2. In fact, the 
authoritative rule-making body of the accounting profession prefers this 
method of reporting the cash flows. However, an alternative method of 
reporting operating cash flows is permitted, which has become the most 
popular method. Instead of directly reporting the cash flows of revenue and 
expenses, the alternative method starts with bottom-line net income and 
then lists several adjustments to net income in order to work down to the 
amount of cash flow from profit. (Chapter 4 goes into more detail.) Both ways 
of presenting cash flow from operating activities report the same cash flow 
figure; the difference is how you get there.
Putting cash-flow activities together
The change in cash during the period is the sum of the changes in the three 
types of cash flow:

22
Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
 	
✓	Cash from investing activities
	
✓	Cash from financing activities
	
✓	Cash from operating activities
For most businesses, investing activities result in a decrease in cash, which is 
caused by expenditures for new machinery, equipment, buildings, and other 
long-term operating assets. The old assets disposed of during the year don’t 
produce much cash inflow. Financing activities can have either positive or 
negative cash impact, depending on whether the business raised new debt 
and equity capital during the period or reduced its debt and equity capital. 
Also, it depends on the size of cash dividends paid to shareowners from 
profit for the year. Ominously, all three activities can be negative, which 
would probably indicate serious cash-flow problems.
We end this section with a pop quiz to wrap things up: Suppose the net cash 
result from the investing activities of a business during the year is a $500,000 
decrease in cash. Purely by coincidence, the net cash result from its financing 
activities is $500,000 increase in cash. Therefore, the net effect on cash of 
these two classes of cash-flow activities is exactly zero for the year (not too 
likely, of course). Yet the company’s cash balance increased $200,000 during 
the year. Is this cash increase due solely to its cash flow from operating 
activities for the year?
The answer is yes. In addition to cash flow from investing and financing 
activities, the only other source of cash to a business is from its operating 
(profit-making) activities. Therefore, the $200,000 cash increase must be the 
cash flow from profit. The other two sources and uses of cash are a wash; 
the increase in one offsets the decrease in the other.
What was the company’s profit for the year? Well, you can’t tell from the 
cash-flow figure. Profit could be much more, about the same, or less than the 
$200,000 cash-flow amount. In fact, the business may have recorded a loss for 
the year (and still have $200,000 positive cash flow from operating activities). 
You have to look at the company’s income statement for the year, which is 
based on accrual-basis accounting, to find the profit or loss for the period.

Is Essential

W

hen most people hear the term accounting, they first think of 
recordkeeping (or bookkeeping, which is the same thing). Accounting 
certainly does involve a lot of recordkeeping. Why go to the time, trouble, 
and expense? Recordkeeping isn’t done just for the sake of keeping a detailed 
financial history of a business. Businesses spend money on recordkeeping 
because it serves the information needs of the business.
Every business’s information needs include a multitude of financial and other 
types of information for operating day to day, making decisions, controlling 
the activities of the business, complying with various tax laws, and preparing 
financial statements that are essential for securing capital and reporting to 
the sources of its capital.
Compared with personal accounting, business accounting is much more 
comprehensive and standardized. Few people, for example, prepare formal 
financial statements, keep track of the daily balance of their credit cards, 
or formally list their assets. Most people simply keep a checkbook and save 
other receipts and documents that are needed for preparing their income tax 
returns. A business, in contrast, needs a comprehensive accounting system. 
More specifically, it needs an accrual accounting system, which records 
revenue and expenses at the time of transactions whether or not cash flow 
takes place at the same time. Recordkeeping through accrual accounting 
helps businesses keep track of profit or loss more effectively.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
This chapter begins with an overview of the main functions of accounting, 
starting with the recordkeeping that captures and stores this vital information. 
We then move on to explain accrual accounting and why your business needs 
it (as opposed to cash-based accounting), and we close by taking a look at 
common accounting terms that you need to be familiar with to keep successful 
records of your business’s transactions.
Finding Out the Four Functions 
of Accounting
Accountants do a lot of multitasking. They carry out the four functions 
described in this section — bookkeeping, management accounting, complying 
with tax laws, and reporting financial info — all of which have to be done well 
and under time constraints. Delays cause serious problems. Quite literally, a 
business can’t continue to operate very long without these accounting functions 
because its managers typically would be in the dark about which bills were 
due for payment, the amounts of wages and salaries to pay its employees, 
and whether a bank loan was due.
	
Accountants should design a business’s accounting system to fit the specific 
needs of the business. Frankly, in our experience, small businesses tend to be 
too lackadaisical in designing their accounting systems. A company’s accounting 
system should report all detailed expenses that are needed for making decisions 
and keeping control over operations.
Accountants at small businesses may decide to record revenue and expenses 
through simple cash-basis accounting, which, as the term implies, means 
recording only cash inflows and cash outflows. Even so, the business has to 
be careful to distinguish its various cash inflows and outflows. For example, 
the business must distinguish between cash from sales versus cash from 
borrowing money.
	
Cash-basis accounting simplifies recordkeeping, but it puts serious limits on 
the range of information that is reported to the company’s managers. And 
when a business uses cash-basis accounting, its financial reports may not 
fully report its financial condition and may not report its correct profit or loss. 
Cash-basis accounting is adequate only when a business conducts nearly all 
of its revenue and expense transactions in cash, has very few noncash assets, 
and has very few liabilities. Accrual basis accounting, which we introduce 
in Chapter 1 and discuss in more detail in the later section, “Examining the 
Nature of Accrual Accounting,” offers many advantages even to very small 
businesses.

 Chapter 2: Why Accrual Accounting Is Essential
Keeping records (Bookkeeping)
A business can’t operate day in and day out without a good recordkeeping 
system. Accountants capture and store information through the recordkeeping 
system of the business so that they can complete many critical tasks in the 
daily operating activities that demand up-to-date, accurate, complete, and 
readily available information. The lack of information can bring things to a 
halt or at least cause a costly delay.
Folks may not think much about these back-office activities of accountants, 
but they would sure notice if those activities didn’t get done. On payday, 
a business had better not tell its employees, “Sorry, but the accounting 
department is running a little late this month; you’ll get your checks later.” 
And when a customer insists on up-to-date information about how much he 
owes to the business, the accounting department can’t very well say, “Oh, 
don’t worry, just wait a week or so and we’ll get the information to you then.”
An army marches on its stomach, and a business marches on information. To 
give you an idea of the various types of information that the recordkeeping 
system of a business has to gather and make accessible, consider the 
following tasks the accounting department of a business is responsible for:
	
✓	Payroll: The total wages and salaries earned by all employees every 
pay period, which are called gross wages or gross earnings, have to be 
calculated. Based on detailed private information in personnel files and 
earnings-to-date information, the correct amounts of individual income 
tax, Social Security tax, and several other deductions from gross wages 
have to be determined, and all this information is reported to each 
employee every pay period. The total amounts of withheld income tax 
and Social Security taxes, plus the employment taxes imposed on the 
employer, have to be paid to federal and state government agencies on 
time. Retirement, vacation, sick pay, and other benefits earned by the 
employees have to be updated every pay period.
	
✓	Cash collections: All cash received from sales and other sources has to 
be carefully identified and recorded, not only in the cash account but 
also in the appropriate account for the source of the cash received. The 
accounting department makes sure that the cash is deposited in the 
correct checking accounts of the business and that an adequate amount 
of coin and currency is kept on hand for making change for customers. 
Accountants balance the checkbook of the business and control who 
has access to incoming cash receipts. (In larger organizations, the 
treasurer is responsible for some of these functions.)
	
✓	Cash payments (disbursements): In addition to payroll checks, a business 
writes many other checks during the course of a year — to pay for a 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
26
Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
wide variety of purchases, to pay property taxes, to pay on loans, and to 
distribute some of its profit to the owners of the business, for example. 
The accounting department prepares all these checks for the signatures 
of the business officers who are authorized to sign checks. The accounting 
department keeps all the supporting business documents and files to 
know when the checks should be paid, makes sure that the amount to 
be paid is correct, and forwards the checks for signing.
	
✓	Procurement and inventory: Accounting departments usually are 
responsible for keeping track of all purchase orders that have been 
placed for inventory (products to be sold by the business) and all other 
assets and services that the business buys, from postage stamps to 
forklifts. A typical business makes many purchases during the course of 
a year, many of them on credit, which means that the items bought are 
received immediately but paid for later. So this area of responsibility 
includes keeping files on all liabilities that arise from purchases on 
credit so that cash payments can be processed on time. The accounting 
department also keeps detailed records on all products held for sale by 
the business. When products are sold, the accountant determines the 
cost of the goods sold, which is recorded as an expense.
	
✓	Property accounting: A typical business owns many different substantial 
long-term assets collectively called property, plant, and equipment, 
including office furniture and equipment, retail display cabinets, 
computers, machinery and tools, vehicles, buildings, and land. Except 
for relatively small-cost items, such as screwdrivers and staplers, the 
accounting department maintains detailed records of the business’s 
property, both for controlling the use of the assets and for determining 
personal property and real estate taxes.
	
To keep its wheels turning, a business needs a complete and reliable 
recordkeeping system that can organize and protect many different things: 
formal accounting records (mainly accounts and journals), supporting 
schedules, files, purchase orders, cancelled checks, correspondence, legal 
documents, and so on. Businesses have the choice of many customizable 
computer-based recordkeeping programs, and they may hire certified public 
accountants or certified public bookkeepers to advise in selecting, designing, 
and updating a system.
Giving company management 
the information it needs
Another main function of accounting in a business is to provide its managers 
with the financial information they need. This function is generally called 
management accounting or managerial accounting. Business managers need 
financial information for developing strategy and policies, planning and 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
27
 Chapter 2: Why Accrual Accounting Is Essential
constructing budgets for the coming period (assuming they do budgeting), 
and controlling the activities and performance of the business.
The laundry list of financial information that managers need is long and 
diverse, but the info falls into the following three basic categories:
	
✓	Profit or loss performance: Did the business earn a profit for the period 
or suffer a loss, and why?
	
✓	Financial condition: Is the business in a healthy and viable situation, or 
is it in trouble and facing disruption?
	
✓	Cash flows: What amount of cash flow was realized from profit, and 
what were other sources and uses of cash?
Not every manager in a business gets all three types of financial information. 
For example, the vice-president of production may get only cost reports for 
manufacturing. In designing internal financial reports for managers, accountants 
follow the organizational structure of the business to provide only information 
for the sphere of activity that the manager is responsible for. In a small 
business, the owner/manager may be responsible for all aspects of the 
business, which means she gets all types of financial information.
	
The three separate audiences that receive accounting reports are the managers of 
the business, tax authorities (principally the IRS), and the investors and lenders 
of the business. Internal financial reporting to managers, which tends to be 
more detailed as well as sensitive and confidential, is not bound to the financial 
statements and formats that are required in income tax returns and issued to 
the investors and lenders. Nevertheless, in actual practice, accountants 
generally use the same templates for all three audiences even though they 
divulge different information.
	
A business has to decide on the accounting methods that it will use to measure 
profit period by period and to record its assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity. 
The IRS, which you know cannot be ignored, requires that most businesses 
that produce or sell merchandise or that have annual sales revenue of 
$5 million or more use accrual, not cash-basis, accounting. (See the sidebar 
“IRS and accounting methods.”) The cash basis of profit accounting may be 
adequate for certain smaller businesses, such as a barber shop, computer 
repair business, law firm, or real estate agency. However, for the reasons we 
explain in “Examining the Nature of Accrual Accounting,” accrual accounting 
is necessary for businesses of any size and complexity.
Managers need to understand the cash-flow consequences of earning a profit. 
Unfortunately, accrual accounting can obscure the cash flows of revenue and 
expenses. This chapter isn’t the place for jumping into a detailed examination 
of accounting reports to managers, but we do advise accountants to pay partic­
ular attention to reporting the cash flows of revenue and expense to managers 
in a manner they can understand. (We discuss this topic more in Chapter 4.)

Complying with tax laws
A saying in business is that if something can be taxed, it is taxed. Even in a 
relatively small business with just a few employees, one accountant can 
keep busy just filing all the tax returns and forms that are required. The 
federal income tax is the 500-pound gorilla, but many other types of taxes are 
imposed on businesses.
Businesses that are employers pay taxes on their payroll, including Social 
Security, Medicare, and unemployment taxes. Some states levy a tax on 
inventory (goods being manufactured and products being held for sale). 
Most states and local jurisdictions tax the real estate owned by the business. 
International trading has its own types of taxes, such as import and export 
duties. Then they have to deal with sales taxes, for which a business acts as a 
collection agent for the taxing authority. Furthermore, a business has license 
fees to pay, and some companies have to pay franchise fees.
The accounting department has the responsibility of keeping up with 
changes in all the tax laws the business is subject to and filing all the forms 
and reports required under the various tax laws and regulations. Failure to 
pay the proper amounts of taxes or filing tax returns after their deadlines can 
result in heavy fines and penalties. Furthermore, the accounting department 
is expected to keep managers informed about major changes in tax laws and 
to advise them on tax strategies.
IRS and accounting methods
Some people view the IRS as a blood-sucking 
ogre intent on harassing businesses. Actually 
the IRS has quite reasonable rules regarding 
business accounting methods for determining 
annual taxable income. Businesses with 
annual sales revenue of more than $5 million 
are required to use accrual-basis accounting 
methods for revenue and expenses. One main 
exception: Personal service corporations (in 
which 95 percent or more of revenue is from 
rendering personal services) may elect to 
use cash accounting. Also, farmers can use 
cash-basis accounting. Smaller businesses 
(less than $5 million annual sales revenue) 
can elect to use cash accounting — except 
for those businesses that produce, purchase, 
and sell merchandise. They must use accrual 
accounting for inventory, cost of goods sold, 
and sales revenue; they can use the cash basis 
for other income and expenses. So they may 
use a hybrid accounting system that includes 
elements of both cash and accrual accounting.
The IRS stresses consistency of accounting 
methods year to year, which is a fundamental 
pillar of accounting theory and standards. 
Changes in accounting methods from one year 
to the next are anathema — to be avoided 
unless absolutely necessary. The IRS does 
allow changes in accounting methods, but a 
business has to jump through hoops to do it.

and Methods for more details. To download this

Reporting financial information
Financial reporting refers to the preparation and delivery of reports about 
a business’s financial activities. Financial reports that accountants prepare 
for equity shareowners and debt holders consist of certain basic financial 
statements that are accompanied with footnotes and other disclosures. We 
explore financial statements in depth in Chapter 3 but give you an overview 
in the following sections.
Accountants also have to decide how to present financial information to 
managers, how often to present it (daily, monthly, quarterly), and who gets 
what information. (See the previous section “Giving company management 
the information it needs” to review the types of financial information that 
may need to be reported.) Different managers get different information based 
on their sphere of responsibility. The top-level president and chief executive 
get global information for the business as a whole. Likewise, the board of 
directors should receive high-level comprehensive financial reports for the 
business as a whole.
Financial statements
Following are the three primary financial statements, prepared by accountants, 
that are included in the financial report of a business:
The sticky business of tax evasion
You probably are aware that some businesses 
engage in illegal practices to evade taxes, and 
we don’t mean just the federal income tax. One 
well-known tactic for evading income tax is 
sales skimming, in which the manager or owner 
doesn’t record all sales revenue in the accounts 
of the business. Instead, some amount of the 
cash flow from sales goes directly into the 
pocket of the owner/manager without being 
recorded on the books. Another example 
of illegal evasion of taxes concerns payroll 
taxes. A business may deliberately misclassify 
certain persons as being independent contractors 
when in fact they are employees, in order to 
avoid paying Social Security and Medicare 
employer taxes on their salaries.
Most accountants work with the implicit 
assumption that the business is not engaging 
in illegal tax-evasion tactics. They assume that 
the business managers want all revenue to be 
recorded and want all expenses to be legitimate 
costs of operating the business, which may not 
be entirely true, of course. The accountant 
should be careful regarding whether he 
could be held liable as a coconspirator in a 
tax-evasion scheme. And business investors 
and lenders should understand that when a 
business engages in tax evasion, its financial 
reports as well as tax returns are fraudulent 
and misleading. Furthermore, all involved 
parties should be aware of the risk that tax 
authorities may find out the business, which 
can lead to major penalties and collapse.

✓	Income statement: This statement (commonly called the P&L within a 
business) reports total sales revenue and other income for the period 
and expenses and losses for the period. The total amount of expenses 
and losses is deducted from total revenue to get the bottom line, which 
is the net profit or loss for the period.
	
✓	Balance sheet: This statement lists the assets of the business at their 
recorded values, the business’s liabilities, and the amounts invested 
from its equity shareowners and accumulated retained earnings (profit 
earned but not distributed to equity shareowners).
	
✓	Statement of cash flows: The cash flow from operating activities (that is, 
profit-making activities) and other sources and uses of cash during the 
period are reported in this financial statement.
	
Don’t forget that the three financial statements are supplemented with footnotes 
and other disclosures in the financial report. Not all relevant information can 
be contained within the boundaries of the three financial statements. Each 
financial statement is somewhat of a skeleton of information, not a full 
explanation.
External reporting
Accountants have to provide financial reports to people or organizations 
outside the business that have provided the business with capital, money 
to acquire the various assets for operating and achieving the business’s 
objectives. Capital comes from two basic sources: debt and equity.
Debt is money loaned to the business by banks, other types of financial 
institutions, and individuals. Debt has a finite life; it has to be paid at 
maturity (or rolled over and renewed for an additional period). Interest has 
to be paid on debt, so it’s accounted for as an expense of the business.
Equity refers to the ownership capital of a business, which is divided into 
shares (for example, capital stock shares of a corporation). Equity capital 
is committed for the long run; the business has no obligation to redeem or 
return equity capital to its shareowners. (Mutual funds are an exception to 
this rule.) The shareowners take the risk that a business may suffer a loss 
(which diminishes their equity in the business), may not earn enough profit 
to justify the amount of capital they have invested in the business, or may 
not generate enough cash flow from profit to allow the business to distribute 
some of its profit to the equity shareowners of the business.
The equity shareowners and debt holders of a business demand to be kept 
informed about the financial performance and condition of the business. 
Therefore, a business prepares financial reports for its sources of capital.

 Chapter 2: Why Accrual Accounting Is Essential
	
The equity shareowners and debt holders who receive financial reports from a 
business are treated as outsiders who are not active members of management. 
They’re entitled to fair and adequate disclosure about the financial performance 
and condition of the business, but they’re not entitled to all the information 
that the managers of the business know. Most recipients of an annual financial 
report, for instance, can’t get back to the accountant and ask for more 
information or for a different explanation. However, members of the board of 
directors, acting in their capacity as representatives of all equity shareowners, 
as well as major lenders or shareowners, can usually ask the accountant for 
more explanation about what’s in the standard financial report. But in general, 
financial reports are presented on the newspaper model — only one paper for 
all readers is released outside the business.
Businesses, contrary to popular belief, do not keep two sets of books. The 
formats in externally reported financial statements of a business are 
generally the same frameworks used for internal accounting reports to its 
managers. Businesses rarely adopt a completely different format and 
structure for the internal financial statements to their managers. The profit 
or loss reported in the financial report issued to shareowners is the same 
number that managers use inside the business. However, managers have a 
better idea regarding to what extent revenue and expenses have been 
massaged (manipulated) to boost or dampen the profit number that is 
reported outside the business.
Examining the Nature of 
Accrual Accounting
As we mention in Chapter 1, the term accrual is not a particularly helpful 
word for understanding accrual accounting. Accrual suggests accumulation, 
accretion, addition, or growth. These meanings are wide of the mark. Accrual 
accounting refers to the recording of revenue and expenses when these 
­economic events take place, whether or not cash flow takes place at the 
same time.
	
A good example of the difference between accrual and cash accounting is 
when a business makes a sale on credit. The sale takes place today, but the 
customer doesn’t pay the business until, say, 30 days later. The products and/
or services are delivered to the customer at the time of sale. Accrual accounting 
records the sale immediately and also records the cost of goods sold at the 
same time so that the expense is matched with the sales revenue in the same 
period. Cash-basis accounting waits to record the sales revenue until the cash 
is collected from the customer. That type of accounting gives good numbers 
for cash flows but poor numbers for profit (or loss).

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
Uncovering the inadequacy 
of cash-basis accounting
In cash accounting, sales revenue is recorded when cash is received, and 
expenses are recorded when paid. Profit or loss equals the net increase 
or decrease in cash from making sales and paying expenses. Simple? Yes. 
Correct? No. For one thing, profit shown by using the cash method depends 
on when you write checks for expenses. You can improve profit by simply 
not writing checks to pay for certain expenses until next year.
	
Accrual accounting provides a more realistic picture of revenue and expenses. 
You get a better matching of expenses against revenue to determine profit 
or loss. Accrual accounting captures the economic reality of what’s going 
on. Cash-basis accounting looks only at what’s going on in the cash account. 
The business of making profit involves much more than just cash flows — 
although cash flows are very important, of course.
Cash accounting is tolerated as “good enough” for small businesses that 
don’t sell on credit and don’t sell products from inventory. The cash-basis 
numbers for sales revenue and expenses are reasonably close to the 
accrual-basis numbers for these businesses, assuming that the business 
doesn’t deliberately time cash payments for expenses in order to manipulate 
profit for the period. The IRS allows, but does not require, certain small 
businesses to use cash accounting (see the sidebar “IRS and accounting 
methods”).
Though the accrual-accounting method is best for measuring profit for the 
period, it comes with some additional baggage, which we examine in the next 
section.
Recognizing accrual accounting 
in financial reports
	
Financial report readers are entitled to assume that accrual accounting is 
being used to prepare the financial statements in the report unless stated 
otherwise. In other words, accrual accounting is taken for granted unless the 
financial report makes clear that some other basis of accounting is being used. 
(We explain financial statements in Chapter 3.)
You can’t tell whether accrual accounting is being used by a business from 
its income statement. Both the cash- and accrual-accounting methods report 
sales revenue and expenses in the income statement. (Different amounts are 
reported between the two accounting methods). If you want to know for sure 
whether accrual accounting is being used, look in the balance sheet of the 
business. This statement of financial condition, which we discuss in more

 Chapter 2: Why Accrual Accounting Is Essential
detail in the following section, lists the assets and liabilities of the business 
(and other information as well).
Cash-basis accounting — in which only cash transactions are recorded for 
sales and expenses — doesn’t record several assets and liabilities that are 
employed in accrual accounting. Accrual accounting uses several noncash 
asset and liability accounts in recording sales and expenses. These additional 
elements “complicate” the balance sheet. On the other hand, the additional 
assets and liabilities improve the informational value of the balance sheet 
and give a superior measure of profit or loss.
The telltale balance sheet items that reveal the use of accrual accounting in 
recording revenue and expenses include the following assets and liabilities. 
Only their names are mentioned here. The next section explains these assets 
and liabilities in the context of a balance sheet example.
	
✓	Assets:
 
• Accounts receivable
 
• Inventory
 
• Prepaid expenses
 
• Property, plant, and equipment
	
✓	Liabilities:
 
• Accounts payable
 
• Accrued expenses payable
	
When you see these assets and liabilities in a company’s balance sheet, you 
know that it is using accrual accounting, because they’re the devices and 
means to carry out accrual accounting. The accounts are necessary to record 
revenue and expenses when the transactions occur, regardless of when cash 
flows take place.
	
Even when the financial reports tell you that accrual accounting is being used, 
they don’t reveal how well it’s being done by the business. A business may 
be cutting corners regarding how it applies accrual-accounting principles. 
For instance, a business should, according to accrual-accounting principles, 
record the accumulation of vacation and sick pay earned by its employees 
each pay period. However, the business may wait to record this cost until 
employees are paid when they take sick leave or their vacations. The business 
is using the cash method for this particular expense.
Many businesses do not strictly observe every principle of accrual accounting. 
They take practical shortcuts to reduce the amount of entries that have to be 
recorded. Such deviations from accrual accounting are understandable, and 
as long as the amounts involved aren’t significant, accountants and CPA 
auditors don’t object to these departures from the letter of the law. But a 
business can go too far and stray off the path of acceptable accrual-accounting

standards. One troublesome area, for instance, concerns expenditures on 
minor renovations and refurbishment of buildings. The amount should be 
recorded in a property, plant, and equipment asset account and then 
gradually charged to depreciation expense over the estimated future useful 
life of the improvement. But a business may simply record the cost immediately 
to expense instead of going to the trouble of recording it in an asset account 
and depreciating the cost over many years.
Reporting Assets and Liabilities 
in the Balance Sheet
	
The assets and liabilities of a business are reported in a financial statement 
called the balance sheet, which lists the total assets on one side and balances 
them on the other side with the total liabilities and owners’ equity. (It is also 
called the statement of financial condition or statement of financial position.) We 
explain the balance sheet and the other financial statements issued by businesses 
in Chapter 3. In this section, we focus on the key assets and liabilities that are 
used in accrual accounting.
Balance sheets follow certain rules regarding the placement of assets and 
liabilities. On the asset side, cash is listed first, and then accounts receivable, 
inventory, and so on. Accounts payable and accrued expenses payable are 
placed before other liabilities. Figure 2-1 shows an example of a balance sheet 
with cash and the other assets and the liabilities that are used to record 
revenue and expenses shown “in place” (that is, in their typical positions in a 
balance sheet).

 Chapter 2: Why Accrual Accounting Is Essential
	
✓	Accounts receivable: When a sale is made on credit, this asset account 
is increased and sales revenue is increased. Cash accounting involves 
no accounts receivable asset account because sales on credit are not 
recorded until cash is received from customers.
	
✓	Inventory: The cost of products manufactured or purchased is entered 
as an increase in this asset account, and remains in the asset account 
until the products are sold, at which time the cost of the items sold is 
removed from the asset and is recorded as cost of goods sold expense. 
No inventory account is used in cash accounting.
	
✓	Prepaid expenses: A business makes certain expenditures today for 
operating costs that will benefit several future months. One example is a 
12-month fire-insurance policy on a building and its contents. Such 
paid-in-advance amounts are first entered in this asset account. The 
asset account is gradually decreased month by month over the beneficial 
life of the prepayment and the amounts are recorded in an expense 
account. Cash accounting charges the entire cost of the insurance policy 
immediately to expense. Cash accounting doesn’t involve a prepaid 
expense asset account.
	
✓	Property, plant, and equipment: This asset group includes buildings 
and land, land improvements (parking lots and landscaping), machinery, 
tools, office equipment, computers, and vehicles. These assets are used 
by a business for many years. The assets are held not for sale but for 
use in the operations of the business; hence the name fixed assets. The 
cost of these assets (except land) is spread over the estimated useful 
lives of the assets. Each period a fraction of the cost is taken out of the 
asset and entered in the depreciation expense for the period. In cash 
accounting the costs of such assets are recorded to expense immediately 
and, therefore, no such assets are recorded.
	
✓	Accounts payable: This liability account is used to record unpaid 
expenses of the business. When a business gets an invoice for an 
operating cost — such as a utility bill, a bill from its lawyers for services 
provided, or from the local TV station for ads that have already run — it 
records the cost in this liability, and the amount is entered in the 
appropriate expense account. When a bill is paid, cash is decreased and 
this liability account is decreased. In cash accounting, no such liabilities 
are recorded. Expenses are not recorded until actually paid.
	
✓	Accrued expenses payable: Certain operating costs are recorded that 
will not be paid until a month or more later. An expense account is 
increased and this liability is increased. One example is the estimated 
cost of future warranty and guarantee work on products that have 
already been sold. Another example is the accumulated amount of 
interest that has been earned by the lender but not yet paid by the 
business. In cash accounting, this liability isn’t recorded; expenses are 
recorded only when they’re actually paid.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
In Figure 2-1, the balance sheet is in balance because it includes the company’s 
sources of capital. We explain in the earlier section “External reporting” that 
business capital comes from two basic sources: interest-bearing debt and 
owners’ equity. We show just one account labeled debt for all the company’s 
interest-bearing debt, but in actual balance sheets, short-term debt is 
separated from long-term debt. Also, we show just one account for owners’ 
equity. As we explain in Chapter 3, owners’ equity is actually divided into two 
(or more) different accounts. (If you want to see a more complete and less 
simplified balance sheet, flip to Chapter 3.)
	
Debt and owners’ equity accounts aren’t involved in recording revenue and 
expenses. The cash inflow from borrowing money isn’t revenue, and the 
cash outflow for paying down a debt balance isn’t an expense. Keep in mind, 
however, that the interest on debt is recorded as an expense. Likewise, when 
owners invest money in a business, the cash inflow isn’t revenue, and when 
a business returns equity capital to its owners, the cash outflow isn’t an 
expense. At the end of every year the final amount of profit (or loss) for the 
year is entered as an increase (or decrease) in the owners’ equity account 
retained earnings.
The Figure 2-1 example doesn’t have any extraneous assets or liabilities. 
All the assets and the first two liabilities are directly involved in the profit-
making operating activities of the business. These several balance sheet 
accounts are increased or decreased in recording revenue and expenses. 
Knowing the balance sheet accounts that are used in recording revenue and 
expenses is extremely important for understanding cash flow from profit 
because changes during the period in the noncash assets and liabilities that 
are used in recording revenue and expenses determine the cash flow from 
profit (operating activities) for the period.
For example, suppose accounts receivable increases $100,000 during 
the year. Using accrual accounting, during the year the business records 
$100,000 sales revenue that it hasn’t yet collected in cash. Accounts receivable 
increases $100,000 because the cash hasn’t arrived yet. Sales revenue, which 
is used to measure profit, is $100,000 higher than the cash inflow from 
customers during the year. (If you want to find out more about cash-flow 
analysis of profit, turn to Chapter 4.)

The Big Three Financial 
Statements
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding why businesses need financial statements
▶	Finding your way around the balance sheet
▶	Walking down the income statement
▶	Taking a first stab at the statement of cash flows
O

ne of the main functions of accountants in a business is to prepare its 
financial statements. This chapter takes a look at the three primary 
financial statements of a business: the balance sheet, the income statement, 
and the statement of cash flows. Together, these three documents provide 
a comprehensive summary of the financial condition and performance of 
the business. The income statement reveals whether the business earned a 
profit or suffered a loss during the period. The balance sheet stacks up the 
company’s assets against its liabilities at the end of the period. The statement 
of cash flows explains the difference between bottom-line profit and the cash 
flow from profit-making operations, and the business’s other cash sources 
and uses during the period.
	
Which of the three financial statements is most important? If you had time 
to read only one, which one would give you the best understanding of the 
business’s situation? Accountants would find these questions rather odd. 
The three financial statements fit together like pieces in a puzzle. Profit per­
formance may look good in the income statement, but the balance sheet may 
reveal that the business is on the edge of bankruptcy. And if you didn’t read 
the statement of cash flows, you might not notice that the business didn’t gen­
erate much actual cash during the period. In short, the three financial state­
ments are designed to be read in conjunction with one another. You’ve heard 
the expression, “It takes two to tango.” With financial statements, tangoing 
takes all three.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
	
The accountant who prepares the financial statements of a business needs to 
be knowledgeable and up-to-date on the “rules of the game.” The content, 
format, and reporting of financial statements are governed by generally 
accepted standards. Most important, financial statements should be based on 
correct accounting methods. And it should go without saying that financial 
statements should be fair and honest. As you probably suspect, financial 
statements can be deliberately false and misleading. Some of the biggest busi­
ness scandals in recent memory involved fraudulent financial statements 
(does Enron ring a bell?).
In this chapter we focus first on the balance sheet. It’s the “financial anchor” 
of a business. Revenue and expenses pass through the balance sheet, as do 
cash flows. The assets, liabilities, and owners’ equities reported in a balance 
sheet are called real accounts. The amounts reported in the other two finan­
cial statements are total flows for the period, whereas the amounts in the 
balance sheet are net balances (excess of increases over decreases) at the 
end of the period. After examining the balance sheet, we next look into the 
structure of the income statement from the top line to the bottom line and 
see how revenue and expenses are connected with the balance sheet. Finally, 
we introduce the statement of cash flows, which is more fully explored in 
Chapter 4.
Why Financial Statements Are Essential
Are financial statements really necessary? Must a business prepare regular 
financial statements? Is it a crime not to prepare financial statements? For 
most businesses, the answer to these questions is yes. (Well, strictly speak­
ing, you may not be breaking the law if you don’t prepare financial state­
ments, but you get our meaning.) However, you may be surprised to hear 
that many small privately owned businesses that use cash-basis accounting 
don’t bother to regularly prepare financial statements. We were surprised 
to see a 2003 study by the U.S. Federal Reserve System and Small Business 
Administration that found that the large majority of small business firms 
don’t use financial statements for managing the business.
Being accountants, we believe in the importance and usefulness of financial 
statements. But preparing financial statements costs some money — the 
business has to hire a competent accountant and have an adequate account­
ing system to prepare financial statements, so many small, private businesses 
don’t go to the trouble. To keep track of the profit or loss performance of the 
business, the owner/manager may simply look at his or her monthly bank 
statement to track profit — after sorting out nonrevenue sources of cash 
and non-expense uses of cash. If cash increases, then according to cash-
basis accounting the business made a profit. (We explain cash and accrual 
accounting in Chapter 2.)

 Chapter 3: The Big Three Financial Statements
However, modest-size and larger businesses need to prepare financial state­
ments on a regular basis. They use accrual accounting to capture all the 
information needed for preparing financial statements. Financial statements 
are needed for the following reasons:
	
✓	Business income tax returns require income statement information 
(to determine taxable income) and a balance sheet. The accounting 
system has to be designed to record and accumulate this financial infor­
mation (as we explain in Chapter 2).
	
✓	The managers of a business need the financial information in the 
statements for making decisions and controlling the financial affairs 
of the business. They can’t make decisions and identify problems 
without a broad range of financial information, and financial statements 
provide that key information in a reasonably compact and summarized 
format — not all the information they need, but a good part of the 
information.
	
✓	Sources of debt capital and major creditors typically want to see the 
financial statements of a business before they are willing to loan 
money to the business or to extend other forms of credit to a business. 
Money put into a business by lenders and investors is at risk to one 
degree or another. Lenders want to see the latest financial statements to 
assess the risk of the business defaulting on the interest and debt repay­
ment requirements of their loans. Investors want the information to 
assess the ability of the business to stay financially healthy and to earn 
a return on their capital invested in the business.
	
✓	Financial statements are the bedrock information for business 
valuation. When the owners of a business put it up for sale, or when a 
company is approached with an offer to buy the business, its financial 
statements are the main source of information to both sides.
	
✓	“Outside” shareowners use financial statements to keep informed 
about their investment in the business. The larger a business becomes, 
the more likely it is that one or more of its equity owners (shareowners) 
are not active members of the management team running the business. 
Sending them financial statements is the most practical way of commu­
nicating with them.
Financial reports are also used for several other secondary purposes in busi­
ness. For example, financial statements serve as the financial archives of the 
business and are its historical financial trail. And many companies operate a 
franchise, and the contract may require that financial statements be provided 
to the franchisor.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
Who gets financial statements and why
	
The managers of a business are the first people to get the business’s financial 
statements, which they use for decision making and controlling the financial 
performance and condition of the firm. However, exactly which managers get 
which financial statements depends on the organizational structure of the 
company. Generally, the higher up you go in the management hierarchy, the 
more likely a manager is to get all three financial statements, or at least the 
balance sheet and income statement. We explain how managers analyze their 
financial statements in Chapters 5, 6, and 7.
Beyond its managers, who else get the financial statements of a business? 
The first thing to keep in mind is that the financial statements of a business 
are privileged information. A business doesn’t publish its financial statements 
in the local newspaper or put a copy in the library. You could call a business 
and ask for a copy of its latest financial report that includes its financial state­
ments, but don’t expect the business to comply — unless the business is a 
publicly owned corporation.
Roughly speaking, businesses fall into two groups: privately owned compa­
nies and publicly owned corporations. The availability of financial informa­
tion to the public depends largely on which type of business it is.
	
✓	Publicly owned companies: The ownership shares of public companies 
are traded in markets open to the public, such as the New York Stock 
Exchange and NASDAQ. Stockholders of a public company, such as IBM, 
GE, or Apple, are entitled to receive a copy of the company’s latest finan­
cial report. Public corporations also have to make regular filings with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is the federal 
agency that oversees the federal laws that govern the original issue and 
subsequent trading in corporate securities (bonds and stocks).
	
	In addition, public companies are required by law to make their financial 
reports available to the public at large. Most public companies today 
put their financial reports online, so you can go to their websites and 
retrieve their financial reports. Also, mutual funds and other financial 
institutions are subject to federal laws; their financial reports are avail­
able to anyone who wants to see them.
	
✓	Privately owned companies: These businesses are a different kettle 
of fish altogether regarding the circulation of their financial reports. 
Generally speaking, a private business is one that isn’t covered by 
federal securities law. A private business has to be careful regarding 
whether or not federal (or state) laws apply to reporting its financial 
statements.

 Chapter 3: The Big Three Financial Statements
	
	If not required by specific legal requirements, private businesses gener­
ally limit the distribution of their financial statements to their current 
shareowners and lenders. Usually, though not always, banks and other 
sources of debt capital ask to see the financial statements of a private 
business in the loan-application process. The loan may or may not 
include a provision that the business provides up-to-date financial state­
ments on a regular basis over the life of the loan. In addition, a private 
company may release particulars about its business to credit-rating 
agencies and in response to business surveys by state agencies, local 
business groups, and academics doing research.
Who doesn’t get financial 
statements and why
Think about range and number of individuals and other businesses that a 
company deals with. By and large, a private business doesn’t send its finan­
cial statements to any of these people or businesses. A private business cer­
tainly doesn’t send a copy of its financial statements to its competitors, but it 
also doesn’t release its financial statements to customers or vendors.
In fact, a private business doesn’t even provide its financial statements to its 
own employees, who obviously have a stake in the stability of the company. 
On the other hand, a private business may have a profit-sharing plan for its 
employees, in which case it releases some information about its profit perfor­
mance to its employees. Even in this situation, a private company generally 
doesn’t provide balance sheet or cash-flow information to its employees who 
are participating in its profit-sharing plan.
	
Overall, most private businesses keep their financial statements private and 
away from prying eyes of those who may want to take advantage of some 
weakness or vulnerability of the business revealed in its financial statements. 
Private companies take the attitude that people who want to see financial 
statements are up to no good and that sharing the statements would only 
harm the business. This attitude may seem a little paranoid, but it’s undeni­
able that many private businesses have weaknesses that would be noticed by 
someone reading their financial statements.
The restricted availability of the financial reports of private businesses 
contrasts sharply with the open distribution of financial reports by public 
businesses. As we explain in the preceding section, public companies make 
their financial reports available to the public; anyone can get their financial 
reports. And public companies provide financial reports to their lenders and 
shareowners, of course. In addition, public companies must file financial 
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). So the financial 
problems of these companies are more out in the open. We should add, 
however, that many public companies resort to inadequate and opaque 
disclosure in their financial reports to obscure their problems.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
Facing Off: The Balance Sheet
The balance sheet shows how a company’s assets and liabilities stack up at 
the end of the period, as well as the sources of its owners’ equity. Balance 
sheets are presented either in a horizontal (landscape) layout, with assets on 
the left and liability and owners’ equity on the right, or in a vertical (portrait) 
layout, with assets on top and liability and owners’ equity below. Segregating 
assets from liabilities and owners’ equity indicates a face-off of sorts: 
Liabilities and owners’ equity have claims and rights against the assets. Cash 
and assets that will be converted into cash in the future are used to satisfy 
the claims of liabilities and shareowners.
We present a prototype balance sheet with a horizontal layout in Figure 3-1.

Strolling through the balance sheet
If you count the number of assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity in the 
Figure 3-1 balance sheet example, the total comes to 13 accounts. Subtotals 
and totals are not included in this count. Compared with most actual balance 
sheets, this number of accounts is a little low; according to our experience, a 
typical balance sheet reports roughly 15 to 20 accounts. But for the purposes 
of this example, we keep it simple by not jamming in too many accounts. For 
instance, we don’t include an asset account for investments or for loans to 
employees. We also omit “other assets,” which many balance sheets include 
to cover who knows what.
	
The question concerning how many accounts are included in a balance sheet 
raises a very important issue. How much detail should a balance sheet dis­
close about the company’s assets and liabilities? For example, the accounts 
receivable asset account can include amounts seriously overdue from custom­
ers, which raises the question whether the past-due balances will be collected 
in full. Should the overdue amounts be reported in a separate asset account?

 Chapter 3: The Big Three Financial Statements
The property, plant, and equipment asset account includes the cost of the 
land owned by the business. The cost of land is not depreciated, whereas the 
costs of the other assets in this balance sheet account are depreciated. Should 
the cost of land be reported separately in the balance sheet? Usually it isn’t.
	
The accountant faces many disclosure questions in preparing a balance sheet. 
On the one hand, a financial statement should provide adequate disclosure. 
On the other hand, too much detail can defeat the very purpose of a financial 
statement. A balance sheet with 40, 50, or more accounts becomes unwieldy 
and takes too much time to read. The accountant must compromise between 
reporting too much information versus too little, which can be a tough call. 
Furthermore, in many situations, the managers and directors of a business 
intervene and put pressure on the accountant not to disclose certain informa­
tion that would make the business look vulnerable or reveal losses from bad 
decisions. So the accountant “buries” the negative information in one of the 
accounts in the balance sheet without calling attention to it.
One of the calls an accountant has to make is how to treat accumulated depre­
ciation on property, plant, and equipment. In the Figure 3-1 balance sheet 
example, the accumulated depreciation account balance is deducted from the 
balance of the property, plant, and equipment asset account. Accumulated 
depreciation is a contra account, meaning its negative balance is subtracted 
from the positive balance of its companion account. Original historical costs 
are recorded in the property, plant, and equipment asset account, and the 
depreciation expense recorded each year is accumulated in the contra 
account. The book value of these long-term operating assets (also called fixed 
assets) is the net amount after deducting accumulated depreciation. In the 
example, the book value of the company’s property, plant, and equipment 
assets is $14,072,250 at the close of the year just ended. This is the amount 
included in the $26,814,579 total assets of the business at that date.
	
Some businesses report only one line for their property, plant, and equipment 
assets, which is the net amount after deducting the accumulated depreciation 
on the assets. The original costs of the assets and the accumulated depreca­
tion on the assets are relegated to the footnotes that accompany the financial 
statements of the business. So rather than the three lines for these long-term 
assets, shown in Figure 3-1, only the following line is reported:
Property, Plant, and Equipment, net of Accumulated Depreciation ..... 
$14,072,250
This alternative illustrates the desire to keep the balance sheet as brief as 
possible and include only truly relevant information. Is reporting original 
cost and accumulated depreciation really necessary? That’s the $64,000 ques­
tion. Do readers of financial reports really need to know the original costs 
and accumulated depreciation of a company’s long-term operating assets? 
Would their assessment of a company’s financial condition be any different 
if only the book value (net of accumulated depreciation) is reported in the 
main body of the balance sheet?

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
Accountants don’t object to reporting only one line for a company’s prop­
erty, plant, and equipment (book value net of accumulated depreciation). 
This alternative doesn’t violate generally accepted financial reporting 
standards. But at the same time, most accountants are probably a little 
uncomfortable with this alternative and prefer that both original cost and 
accumulated depreciation be included in the balance sheet. In the old days, 
the prevailing practice was to report both original cost and accumulation 
depreciation. Old habits die hard. Accountants know that the newer method 
of reporting just one line for cost minus depreciation is okay, but accoun­
tants are generally conservative and prefer to stick to traditional ways in 
financial reporting.
Accountants do not allow offsetting, or netting off a liability against a related 
asset. It’s a definite no-no. For instance, the amount of accounts payable for 
inventory purchases is never deducted from the cost balance of the invento­
ries asset account with only the net difference reported. Long-term debt may 
a have a mortgage on the property, plant, and equipment of a business. The 
debt is never deducted from the balance of the assets.
Putting accounts in their right places
Assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity components are grouped into certain 
classes in a balance sheet. Liabilities are not intermingled with assets, nor 
are owners’ equity accounts. These three basic types of accounts are clus­
tered together in their own neighborhoods.
Assets and liabilities are separated into current and longer-term categories. 
Current basically means one year or less, although the technical rule for this 
classification doesn’t put a strict and definite time limit on what’s reported 
as current. In our balance sheet example, total current assets and liabilities 
equal $12,742,329 and $6,126,096, respectively. We explain in Chapter 5 that 
current assets are compared with current liabilities to get an important indi­
cator of the short-term solvency of the business.
The Figure 3-1 balance sheet example includes 13 accounts for assets, liabili­
ties, and owners’ equities. In addition, subtotals and totals take up seven 
lines. The subtotals for current assets and current liabilities are always 
presented. The total of assets on the one side and the total of liabilities plus 
owners’ equity on the other side are always given. Otherwise, reporting 
practices vary somewhat. For instance, Figure 3-1 includes a subtotal for all 
liabilities ($13,626,096). Many balance sheets do not include this line, which 
is acceptable.
	
When you see that total assets exactly equals the total of liabilities and 
owners’ equity, you are reassured that the accounting system of the business 
must be okay — the books are in balance. However, even when the books are 
in balance, serious accounting errors or even outright accounting fraud can be 
taking place, resulting in a balance sheet that is seriously misleading.

 Chapter 3: The Big Three Financial Statements
Most balance sheets are presented in a two- or three-year comparative 
format so that readers can compare the balances a year and two years ago 
with the balances at the end of the most recent year. The Figure 3-1 example 
is a two-year presentation. Notice, however, that the changes in each account 
are not included in the Figure 3-1 balance sheet example. The changes can be 
included but are not in most financial reports.
	
The account balances in a balance sheet can be rounded off to the nearest 
thousand, or nearest million for very large businesses. So the balance of 
cash at the close of the year just ended can be reported as $2,346 thousand 
(rounded). Rounding off account balances is fairly common. It puts less strain 
on the eyeballs. No one raises any objection to rounding off.
Figure 3-2 is the same example as in Figure 3-1 except that the dollar amounts 
are rounded to the nearest thousand and changes in the accounts during the 
year, as well as changes in the subtotals and totals, are included. (Note that 
this balance sheet is in the vertical format — assets on top and liabilities and 
owners’ equity on bottom.)
A balance sheet can be prepared at any point in time (assuming that the com­
pany’s accounting system is up-to-date). However, balance sheets take time 
to assemble and to make available in print form or put online. Generally, a 
business doesn’t prepare a balance sheet any more often that it has to. The 
standard time for preparing a balance sheet is at the close of business on the 
last day of the profit period. Profit (or loss) is reported in the income state­
ment (see the later section “Making Profit: The Income Statement”). If, for 
example, the income statement is for the year ending September 30, 2012, the 
balance sheet is prepared as of midnight on that date.
Dealing with the limitations 
of the balance sheet
	
Financial statements don’t include interpretative comments or indicators of 
what’s most important. The premise is that financial statements “speak for 
themselves.” Or, rather, we should say that the financial statements are pre­
sented on the premise that readers know how to understand and interpret 
financial statements. Financial reporting assumes that the readers of these 
accounting statements are persons who are fairly knowledgeable about busi­
ness, financial terminology, and accounting methods. Quite a presumption, 
isn’t it?

You should understand that a balance sheet reports recorded values. The 
dollar amounts you see in the asset, liability, and owners’ equity accounts 
are the result of the amounts recorded in these accounts. Some of the bal­
ances are the result of recent transactions and some are from transactions 
that took place years ago. However, the balance sheet doesn’t disclose how 
old the balances in each account are. You, the reader, are expected to under­
stand that some balances are driven mainly by recent activities and other 
balances include amounts recorded 5, 10, or 20 years ago (or even longer).
	
The balance sheet does not report up-to-date market values for its assets. 
(A few exceptions exist, but they don’t apply in our example.) For instance, 
the assets included in property, plant, and equipment are the original costs 
of these resources, which very well may be considerably lower than current 
replacement values of the assets.

 Chapter 3: The Big Three Financial Statements
	
A balance sheet also does not report what the business would be worth if it 
were for sale, either as a thriving going concern or as an entity that might be 
liquidated. In other words, the net worth of the business reported in its bal­
ance sheet — its assets minus its liabilities — may or may not be a good indi­
cator of what a buyer would be willing to pay for 100 percent ownership of the 
business. The business may be worth much more than the book value of its 
owners’ equity, or much less. Until the shareowners actually put their shares 
up for sale, the business’s worth is anyone’s guess. (For more on business val­
uation, you can go to our book Small Business Financial Management Kit For 
Dummies [John Wiley & Sons, Inc.].)
Every day that a company is open for business, it engages in transactions and 
carries on operating activity of all sorts. All these transactions and activities 
are recorded in the balance sheet accounts of the business. Therefore, the 
balance sheet is constantly changing. Though the balance sheet is prepared 
as of the last day of the income statement period, the preparation normally 
takes a few weeks or longer. Suppose, for instance, that the balance sheet 
is prepared at the close of business on September 30, 2012, because the 
income statement is for the year that ends then. The financial report of the 
business may not be ready until, say, November 15, 2012. (Six weeks’ delay is 
not unusual.) So by the time the balance sheet is ready for distribution, it’s 
already somewhat out of date. Things may have changed for the better or for 
the worse.
	
The accountant must decide whether or not the balance sheet at the last day 
of the income statement period is misleading compared with the more recent 
up-to-date financial condition of the business. Developments between the 
official balance sheet date (the last day of the income statement period) and 
the date of distribution of the balance sheet are called subsequent events. If the 
subsequent events substantially change the financial condition of the busi­
ness, the changes should be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial state­
ments of the business so that readers are not lulled into false impressions 
based on the balance sheet at the previous date.
Tracing revenue and expenses 
in the balance sheet
Chapter 2 explains accrual-basis accounting for measuring profit or loss — 
that is, for recording revenue and expenses. (Other types of income and 
gains may be recorded, as well as losses, to determine the final profit or 
loss for the period.) Understanding which accounts in the balance sheet are 
the result of recording revenue and expenses is very helpful because these 
accounts are inextricably linked with making profit. In fact, the accounts 
connected with recording revenue and expenses are a large part of the 
balance sheet.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
To “size up” assets and liabilities, or to determine whether the balances of 
assets and liabilities are too high or too low, you compare the balance of the 
asset or liability with the revenue and/or the appropriate expense reported 
in the income statement. For example, in the Figure 3-2 balance sheet, the 
accounts receivable asset at the end of the most recent year is about $3.8 
million. Is this amount about right, or is it out of whack? Well, the only way 
to answer is to compare it with sales revenue for the year. If sales revenue 
were, say, only $10.0 million for the year, an ending balance of $3.8 million 
of accounts receivable is way too high and should raise alarm. Why should 
such a large percent of annual sales revenue still be uncollected at the end of 
the year?
Cash is like the Grand Central Station of the balance sheet. More or less 
everything passes through the cash account sooner or later. Not just revenue 
and expenses, but investing and financing activities also pass through the 
cash account. One exception is depreciation expense, which consists of writ­
ing down the long-term operating assets of the business that are reported 
in property, plant, and equipment. (A business may record noncash gains 
and other kinds of noncash expenses, such as amortization of the cost of its 
intangible assets.)
	
So which balance sheet accounts in addition to cash do revenue and expenses 
drive? Quite a few, as it turns out. The following list summarizes the balance 
sheet accounts that are part and parcel of recording revenue and expenses:
	
✓	Accounts receivable: Sales made on credit are first recorded in this 
asset account. The balance in this account is the amount of uncollected 
sales revenue at the balance sheet date.
	
✓	Inventories: When products are manufactured or purchased, their costs 
are recorded in this asset account, and when the products are later sold, 
the cost is taken out of this asset account and charged to cost of goods 
sold expense. The balance in this account is the total cost of unsold 
products at the balance sheet date.
	
✓	Prepaid expenses: Certain operating costs have to be paid in advance 
of when the amounts should be recorded as expenses, and the amounts 
are first recorded in this asset account. Over time, the costs are allo­
cated to the months in which the company benefited from the prepaid 
expense. The balance in this asset account is the amount of prepaid 
operating costs that have not yet been charged to expense at the bal­
ance sheet date.
	
✓	Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) and accumulated depreciation: 
The costs of long-term operating resources (that are not held for sale 
but are for use by the business) are recorded in the PP&E asset account. 
The cost of each item, except land, is allocated over the estimated 
useful life of the asset. A fraction of the cost is charged to each period 
as depreciation expense. The amounts of depreciation are not directly

49
 Chapter 3: The Big Three Financial Statements
deducted from the asset account but rather accumulated in the contra 
account called accumulated depreciation. The book value of the asset 
(cost minus accumulated depreciation) is the amount of cost that has 
not yet been written off to depreciation expense at the balance-sheet 
date. The book value will be charged to depreciation in future periods 
unless the business disposes of such assets before they reach the end of 
their estimated useful lives.
	
✓	Accounts payable: When a business makes a purchase on credit, the 
amount is recorded in this liability account, which is reduced later 
when the amount is paid. These purchases are for products to be sold, 
raw materials used in manufacturing, utilities, various services, office 
supplies, and so on, which are charged to expense. The balance in this 
account is the cost of things the business has not yet paid for at the bal­
ance sheet date.
	
✓	Accrued expenses payable: To recognize the gradual accumulation of 
certain expenses over time, for which the business does not receive 
a bill, certain expenses are recorded in the correct period by increas­
ing this liability account. These liabilities are paid at a later time. For 
example, each period, the cost of employee vacations is recorded in this 
liability even though they don’t take their vacations until later. The bal­
ance in this account is the accumulated amount of expenses that have 
been recorded but have not been paid for at the balance sheet date.
On the balance sheet, if you were to cross out cash and the accounts just 
listed, you would end up with only the two debt accounts (short-term and 
long-term) and the two owners’ equity accounts (capital stock and retained 
earnings). These accounts are not involved in recording revenue and expenses. 
Rather, the accounts have to do with where the business gets its capital from, 
which we turn to next.
Managing capital
One reason for reading a balance sheet is to determine the business’s capital 
structure, the mix of sources of capital. We’re sure that you’ve heard the com­
ment that it takes money to make money. It does. Before opening its doors, 
a business needs to raise enough capital to invest in the assets it needs for 
its operations. Being undercapitalized is the kiss of death. Many businesses 
gamble that they can get by with too little capital, but this is a bad bet. They 
may have a great business plan and model, but without sufficient capital, it’s 
just a pipe dream.
	
The assets show how the capital is deployed, and the other half of the bal­
ance sheet shows where the capital came from. So in the Figure 3-2 example, 
how much total capital does the business have at its disposal at the end of its 
most recent year? The answer is the total of liabilities and owners’ equity — in 
other words, the part of the balance sheet below assets.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
Identifying sources of capital
The first three liabilities in Figure 3-2 — accounts payable, accrued expenses 
payable, and income tax payable — in one sense are not sources of capital. 
They are the operating liabilities of the business and arise naturally from car­
rying on the profit-making operations of the business. The business doesn’t 
borrow money from these sources of credit. These short-term liabilities are 
non–interest bearing. The business has no explicit or determinable interest 
cost on these liabilities — although accounts payable and income tax pay­
able typically include late payment penalties that tack on an interest charge 
beyond the interest-free credit period.
When people speak of raising capital, they aren’t talking about operating 
liabilities. They’re talking about borrowing money, having owners invest 
money in the business, or having the business itself plow back profit (by not 
distributing cash dividends from profit to shareowners). Therefore, you may 
often hear discussions about debt versus equity and the advantages and 
disadvantages of each source of capital. Operating liabilities more or less get 
lost in the shuffle. Nevertheless, operating liabilities are usually a fairly sig­
nificant source of the total assets of a business — as they are in the Figure 3-2 
business example (14.5 percent of total capital).
Using the same example, the capital structure of the business at the close of 
its most recent year is summarized in Figure 3-3. Three sources of capital are 
reported: operating liabilities, interest-bearing debt, and owners’ equity. As 
you can see, debt is separated between short-term (one year or shorter matu­
rity date) and long-term (longer than one year). Details about the maturity 
dates, interest rates, and significant provisions of the debt instruments are 
disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements.
Total owners’ equity (refer to Figure 3-1 or 3-2) is separated into two quite 
distinct types. The first account, capital stock, keeps track of the amounts 
invested in the business for which the owners receive capital stock shares 
(assuming that the business is a corporation). The second owners’ equity 
source is retained earnings and equals the cumulative profit earned by the 
business over the years that has been retained instead of having been distrib­
uted as cash dividends to shareowners.
	
From the information in Figure 3-3, you can say that this business is moderately 
leveraged. Leverage refers to the use of debt capital on top of equity capital. The 
basic strategy is to magnify your equity capital by adding debt so that the busi­
ness has more total capital to work with. If the business earns a higher percent 
of operating profit than the interest rate on its debt, it boosts the earnings on its 
equity capital. Leverage may refer to the total of both operating liabilities and 
interest-bearing debt. In other words, the term can refer just to debt or to all 
liabilities. Another term you may hear is the debt load of the business. Generally 
this term refers just to the interest-bearing debt of a business, which in the 
example is $9,750 thousand (both short-term and long-term).

We extend the explanation of various sources of capital in Chapters 10 and 
11, and we go into more detail about reading the balance sheet in Chapter 5.
Figuring out what to do with capital when you have it
The whole point of raising capital is for the business to make good use of 
the money by investing in the assets needed for operating and making profit. 
Capital has a cost; interest is paid on debt capital, and the business needs 
to earn an adequate bottom-line profit (after interest) to justify the use of 
its owners’ equity capital. Capital supplied by the operating liabilities of a 
business has no explicit cost. In the example in Figure 3-3, 14.5 percent of 
the total capital of the business is from its operating liabilities. This amount 
can be viewed as “free capital” on which the business does not pay a cost for 
using the money.
From Figure 3-3, you can also see that the business has raised about $27 mil­
lion total capital (rounded) as of the close of its most recent year. The asset 
side of a balance sheet reveals how the company has invested its capital. 
The listed assets reveal how much money the business has invested in each 
kind of asset. Referring back to Figure 3-2, you can see, for example, that the 
business has invested $5,760 thousand in products being held for sale to cus­
tomers (labeled inventories in the balance sheet). The business has invested 
$2,346 thousand in cash, which may seem odd to you. How do you invest in 
cash? Well, by not spending the money.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
	
A business needs to maintain an adequate cash balance for day-to-day opera­
tions. Letting the cash balance hover around zero isn’t practical. If a business 
did, it might have to wait for cash to come in from collections of accounts 
receivable or from cash sales to be able to pay its bills and cut payroll checks 
for its employees. The cash balance is a buffer against unexpected delays in 
cash inflows. Having cash on hand allows the business to take advantage of 
opportunities that demand quick cash payment.
The investment in fixed assets (property, plant, and equipment) needs a 
comment or two here. The balance sheet (refer to Figure 3-2) shows that the 
total original cost of these long-term operating resources is $20,858 thousand 
at the close of the year just ended. This amount was invested in the assets 
at the times of acquisition. The accumulated depreciation recorded on the 
assets is $6,785 thousand. This amount is the portion of original cost that has 
been recovered by the business. A business sets sales prices high enough to 
cover its depreciation expense (as well as the cost of goods sold, other oper­
ating expenses, interest, and income tax.). In this way, a business gradually 
“sells off” some of its fixed assets to its customers over the years. Each year 
part of the original cost is converted back into cash. So at the close of the 
year just ended, the business has only $14,073 thousand still invested in its 
fixed assets.
Making Profit: The Income Statement
A business earns profit by making sales and controlling expenses. Thus, the 
financial statement that reports profit performance starts with sales revenue 
and then deducts the expenses of making the sales and operating the busi­
ness. Figure 3-4 shows the latest annual income statement of the business 
whose balance sheet is explained in the previous sections in this chapter.
Note: If the balance sheet reports assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity 
rounded to the nearest thousand, then the income statement follows suit.
	
Two basic financial benchmarks that tie together the income statement and 
the balance sheet can be used to judge a company’s financial performance. 
First, annual sales revenue is compared against total assets to test whether 
the business is making good use of its assets (because assets are used to make 
sales). The business in our example reports about $27 million total assets 
(refer to Figure 3-2). The company reports about $40 million annual sales (see 
Figure 3-4.) Second, annual net income is compared against owners’ equity, 
which gives a measure of return on investment earned for the shareowners. 
The business in our example reports about $13 million total owners’ equity 
at the end of the most recent year (shown in Figure 3-2), and it earned about 
$1.6 million bottom-line net income for the year (shown in Figure 3-4).

Publicly owned corporations disclose earnings per share (EPS) in their income 
statements just below bottom-line net income. The market value per share 
is the most closely watched figure of a publicly owned company, and market 
value depends mainly on the earnings (net income, or profit) performance 
of the business. Therefore, generally accepted financial reporting standards 
require that EPS be reported by public companies.
In contrast, privately owned business corporations don’t have to report earn­
ings per share. The ownership shares of a private business aren’t actively 
traded in a public market, so the market value per share is not readily deter­
minable. The EPS of a private company can’t be compared to any reference 
point, so financial reporting standards don’t require that private companies 
report their EPS.
Truth be told, the income statement presented in Figure 3-4 contains minimal 
disclosure. Take out the subtotals — gross margin, earnings before interest 
and income tax, earnings before income tax, and bottom-line net income — 
and you’re left with only five lines of “hard information”: sales revenue and 
four expenses. The managers of the business need much more information 
about expenses; for that matter, they need more detailed information about 
sales revenue as well.
The disclosure in the income statement example in Figure 3-4 is for exter­
nal financial reporting to the lenders and shareowners of the business. 
The extent of disclosure of expenses in Figure 3-4 meets minimum financial 
reporting standards. Many public businesses disclose research and develop­
ment expenses separate from selling, general, and administrative expenses. 
In contrast, external income statements don’t disclose management compen­
sation or marketing expenses as separate expenses.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
Moving from the revenue top 
line to the profit bottom line
The income statement can be read from the top down or from the bottom 
up. You can start with the sales revenue line and then work your way down 
to the bottom line. Or you can start with the bottom line and work your way 
up to the top line. One professional football player who is a very successful 
businessman was quoted as saying that the first thing he looks for in his com­
pany’s income statement is whether the bottom line has parentheses around 
it, meaning that the bottom line is a loss (negative number) rather than a 
profit (positive number). Suffering a loss is said to be “in the red,” and earn­
ing a profit is said to be “in the black.”
The income statement example shown in Figure 3-4 includes four profit lines: 
gross margin, earnings before interest and income tax (also called operating 
earnings), earnings before income tax, and net income. As shown in Figure 
3-4, businesses that sell products should disclose gross profit (also called 
gross margin), which equals sales revenue less the cost of goods (products) 
sold. Many public businesses don’t report earnings before interest and 
income tax or earnings before income tax. Because private companies limit 
the distribution of their financial reports, we don’t know whether they gener­
ally report those profit lines.
	
Earnings before interest and income tax (abbreviated EBIT) is compared with 
sales revenue to see whether the company has been able to maintain its oper­
ating margin (as a percent of sales revenue). Financial analysts consider this 
performance measure very important, so they would be upset if the business 
didn’t provide the EBIT in its income statement.
Deciding which is more important: 
Revenue or expenses
Revenue and expenses act like the two blades on scissors. The final cut of 
profit is the result of both revenue and expenses. Quite clearly, both factors 
determine profit for the period. So in one sense, asking which is more impor­
tant is nonsensical. Yet at the same time, experienced business managers 
argue that making sales and generating sales revenue is more important than 
controlling expenses — keeping in mind that both are important, of course.
Why is revenue more important? Without revenue, there can be no profit. In 
other words, the starting point for making profit is making sales. Of course, a 
business may let its expenses get out of control relative to its sales revenue. 
But for a given level of sales revenue, a rock-bottom level of expenses has to 
be incurred to make the sales and operate the business. A business can only 
cut costs to a certain point before hurting sales in the process.

 Chapter 3: The Big Three Financial Statements
On the other hand, sales have no theoretical limit; with smart marketing a 
business can keep increasing its sales (assuming it can raise enough capital). 
The upside potential of sales is limitless, but the downside limit of reducing 
expenses is definitely limited. For these reasons, financial analysts are gener­
ally more concerned with the direction of sales year to year. Sales downturns 
are more likely to kill a business than costs that are out of control.
Summarizing Cash Flows: The 
Statement of Cash Flows
In 1987, the accounting rule-making body in the United States decided that 
a statement of cash flows should be included in financial reports to supple­
ment the income statement and to help explain changes in the financial 
condition as reported in the balance sheet. The concept of this statement is 
rather straightforward: It summarizes the sources and uses of cash during 
the year.
From the very first page of this book, we emphasize the importance of cash 
flows. Our purpose here is to simply introduce the statement of cash flows. 
Figure 3-5 illustrates this financial statement for the same business example 
for which we present a balance sheet (Figures 3-1 and 3-2) and income state­
ment (Figure 3-3).
Note: If the balance sheet and income statement figures are rounded to the 
nearest thousand, then the statement of cash flows follows suit.
The purpose of the statement of cash flows is to give the reader a road 
map of the reasons for the change in cash during the year. You can see in 
the example in Figure 3-5 that cash increased $247,137 during the year. But 
remember, the increase in cash is not a measure of the profit performance of 
the business. You must look in the income statement for profit performance.
	
Frankly, the first section of the statement of cash flows is a bearcat to get a 
grip on. For this reason, we spend a good part of Chapter 4 on understanding 
and interpreting cash flow from operating activities, or the cash result from 
earning profit. Chapter 2 explains that the cash impact from the profit-making 
activities of a business is invariably different from the bottom line of the busi­
ness. Chapter 4 offers a more in-depth explanation of the reasons for the dif­
ference between cash flow and profit. In the following sections of this chapter, 
we introduce the three categories of cash flows that are reported in the state­
ment of cash flows.

Showing cash flow from operating 
 (profit-seeking) activities
The first section in the statement of cash flows explains why cash 
flow from profit is a different amount than the bottom-line profit (net 
income) for the period. As you can see in Figure 3-5, this section of 
the statement of cash flows is called cash flow from operating activi­
ties. A better title might be cash flow from profit-making activities. 
In any case, this section begins with the net income reported in the 
income statement, which in the example is $1,585,587 for the year. 
Next, several adjustments are made to the net income figure in order 
to arrive at the cash flow from operating activities amount, which in 
the example is $1,297,907.

 Chapter 3: The Big Three Financial Statements
You may question the difference between net income and cash flow from net 
income (or cash flow from operating activities). Cash flow is $287,680 lower 
than net income for the year: $1,585,587 net income – $1,297,907 cash flow 
from operating activities = $287,680 difference. This gap is due to a combina­
tion of factors, in particular depreciation expense and changes in the assets 
and liabilities used in recording revenue and expenses. The net result of 
all these factors is a reduction in cash flow from net income for the year. 
Chapter 4 carefully explains each of the cash-flow adjustments to net income.
Listing other sources and uses of cash
The remainder of this financial statement divides cash flows between invest­
ing activities and financing activities (refer to Figure 3-5). Investing refers to 
making capital expenditures for expanding, updating, and replacing the long-
term operating assets of the business, which are reported as property, plant, 
and equipment in the balance sheet. A business may also make other types 
of investments, for example in intangible assets, marketable securities, and 
capital stock shares in other businesses. (The example in Figure 3-5 doesn’t 
include any of these other types of investments.)
The investing activities section of the statement includes any cash inflows 
from disposals of the assets classified in the investment activities section. In 
the example, the business realized $265,480 cash proceeds from disposing of 
some of its fixed assets.
In the example, the business spent $2,920,770 cash (net of the cash inflow 
from disposals) on capital expenditures, or about $3 million. Where did it get 
this $3 million? Cash flow from profit (operating activities) was only about 
$1.3 million, and its cash balance increased during the year. Therefore, the 
business must have raised additional cash from its sources of capital.
Sure enough, the third section of the statement reports that the business 
raised $1,870,000 cash during the year through financing activities — in 
this case, by increasing its short-term and long-term debt and by issuing 
additional stock shares to its owners. This cash increase figure is net of 
the $450,000 cash dividends paid to its stockholders during the year. Cash 
dividends are placed in the financing section of the statement of cash flows.

of Cash Flows
In This Chapter
▶	Defining the different kinds of cash flows
▶	Determining what the statement reveals about changes in financial condition
▶	Checking out different cash-flow situations
▶	Realizing the faults of the statement of cash flows
T

he statement of cash flows is the youngest of the three primary finan­
cial statements reported by businesses. In 1987, the high priests that 
mandate financial reporting standards decided that this statement should 
be included alongside the balance sheet and income statement in financial 
reports of businesses.
Despite being one of the “big three” financial statements, the statement of 
cash flows doesn’t draw the attention from financial analysts, creditors, and 
investors that the balance sheet and income statement do. The top line (sales 
revenue) and the bottom line (net income, or profit) in the income statement 
get the most focus, and the balance sheet also gets a fair amount of consid­
eration, especially if the business is on the ropes and faces a serious risk of 
bankruptcy.
	
However, the statement of cash flows is the dominant financial statement 
when a business isn’t generating enough cash flow or is hemorrhaging cash 
from operations, and has gotten itself in a precarious situation regarding its 
ability to pay its debt obligations on time. In these stressful situations, the 
statement of cash flows takes center stage.
Even for financially healthy and prosperous companies, the statement has 
several important uses, so don’t limit your attention to the statement to dire 
situations. At the same time, be cautioned that reading this financial state­
ment presents certain challenges. In this chapter, we explain the statement’s 
important uses and advise you on how to read and understand it.

Figure 4-1 presents a basic example for the statement of cash flows, pre­
sented according to generally accepted financial reporting standards of 
course. (If you read Chapter 3, note that this example is different.) The state­

$25,000 decrease in the example. The statement also includes the beginning 
balance and the ending balance (as you see in Figure 4-1).

 Chapter 4: Getting a Grip on the Statement of Cash Flows
In this financial statement, cash flows are classified into three categories:
	
✓	Cash flow from operating activities: The first section in the statement 
of cash flows lists the adjustments to net income for determining the net 
cash increase or decrease from the profit-making operating activities of 
the business during the period. In the example in Figure 4-1, net income 
is $350,000 for the year, but this amount isn’t the cash flow for the year. 
Cash flow for the year is $420,000. In other words, the total cash inflow 
from revenue during the year was $420,000 more than the total cash out­
flow for expenses during the year. This first section leaves the trail you 
follow to see why cash flow was higher than net income for the year.
	
✓	Cash flow from investing activities: The second section in the state­
ment of cash flows lists outlays called capital expenditures. They include 
cash expenditures to replace, upgrade, and expand the long-term oper­
ating assets of the business, including its buildings, land, machinery, 
equipment, tools, and so on. Also, a business may make other invest­
ments in marketable and nonmarketable securities, intellectual property 
(patents and secret processes, for example), and in other businesses. A 
business may make an “investment” by loaning money to one or more of 
its key executives. This section of the statement includes proceeds from 
the sale or disposals of investment assets. In the example in Figure 4-1, 
the business made capital expenditures of $400,000 during the year. It 
had no sales or other disposals of investments.
	
✓	Cash flow from financing activities: The third section in the statement 
of cash flows reports dealings between the business and its sources of 
capital, which are interest-bearing debt and owners’ equity. It does not 
include changes during the year in its non-interest-bearing, short-term 
operating liabilities: accounts payable, accrued expenses payable, and 
income tax payable. Changes in these three operating liabilities are 
included in the first section, cash flow from operating activities. The 
third section focuses on changes during the year in the short-term and 
long-term debt of the business, whether the business raised additional 
capital from its owners or returned capital to them, and cash dividends 
paid to its shareowners.
Chapters 1 and 2 explain the differences between accrual-basis accounting 
for revenue and expenses versus the cash flows of revenue and expenses. 
The following section explains in detail how to get from the accrual-basis 
profit number for the period (net income) to the increase or decrease in cash 
resulting from the profit-making activities for the period. The profit-making 
operating activities change the balances in those assets and liabilities that 
are used to record revenue and expenses. These changes are the stepping­
stones from net income to cash flow from operating activities.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
Adjusting your way to cash flow 
from operating activities
Think of the first section in the statement of cash flows as the route from one 
side of the river (the accrual-accounting shore) to the other side (the cash-
basis shore). Net income, the bottom line of the income statement and the first 
line in the statement of cash flows, is the first steppingstone and the connect­
ing link between the two documents. Be warned: The trip is across choppy 
waters. It’s like crossing the Mississippi, not jumping over a puddle. The other 
two sections of the financial statement are more intuitive and straightforward 
(which is why we devote less discussion to them in the next section).
	
Assuming that you have a basic understanding for why revenue and expense 
cash flows are different from their accrual-basis amounts, you could simply 
skip down to the line for cash flow from operating activities ($420,000 in the 
example in Figure 4-1). However, you might miss an important piece of infor­
mation about the business. For example, suppose that during the year there 
was a huge increase in its inventory of products held for sale. This increase 
caused a corresponding decrease in cash flow. Also, the inventory buildup 
could force the business to sell products below normal prices.
Referring back to Figure 4-1, net income is $350,000 for the year just ended. 
This amount isn’t the same as cash increase (or decrease) from earning profit 
for the year. To get from net income to the amount of cash flow, you have to 
make several adjustments to net income. These adjustments to net income, 
explained in the following sections, are usually presented in the same order 
that the assets and liabilities connected with revenue and expenses are listed 
in the balance sheet. So the first adjustment is the change during the year in 
accounts receivable.
Accounts receivable increase
In the example in Figure 4-1, accounts receivable causes a $70,000 nega­
tive adjustment to net income. This asset account, which is used to record 
sales on credit, increased $70,000 during the year. (To find out more about 
asset accounts and effect on cash flow, you may want to refer to the side­
bar “Understanding adjustments to net income.”) The increase means that 
$70,000 less cash was collected during the year than the amount recorded in 
sales revenue.
	
Cash inflow from credit sales was $70,000 less than the sales revenue amount 
used to determine profit for the year. An easy way to think about this is to 
assume that the business started the year with zero accounts receivable and 
has $70,000 accounts receivable at the end of the year. The ending balance is 
the amount of uncollected receivables from customers. The business won’t 
collect this amount until early next year. For the year being reported, the cash 
had not been collected.

 Chapter 4: Getting a Grip on the Statement of Cash Flows
Inventories decrease
In the example in Figure 4-1, the change in inventories results in the $60,000 
positive adjustment to net income. The balance in this asset account (the 
cost of products awaiting future sale) decreased $60,000 during the year, 
which means that the business didn’t replace all the products it sold during 
the year. It allowed its stockpile of products held in inventory to drop. The 
implication is that the business started the year with too much inventory and 
reduced the size of its inventory during the year.
In this situation, the business is said to have liquidated part of the amount 
invested in its inventories asset. In other words, it sold some products with­
out replacing them, reducing cash outflow. Suppose, for instance, that the 
business sold 100,000 units of product during the year but replaced only 
95,000 of units. Therefore, the business avoided cash outlay for the 5,000 
units it did not replace. In short, the business spent $60,000 less cash on pur­
chasing products than the amount of cost of goods sold expense recorded 
in the period. Therefore, the $60,000 inventories decrease is added to net 
income, as you see in Figure 4-1.
Prepaid expenses increase
Usually the change in the prepaid expenses asset account during the year is 
relatively small compared with changes in accounts receivable and inventories. 
In the example, the prepaid expenses asset account increased $5,000 during the 
year. This increase had to be paid for, of course. Basically, the business spent 
$5,000 more for prepaid costs than was charged to expense during the year.
Understanding adjustments to net income
Many (probably most) readers of financial 
statements find that the most difficult part of the 
statement of cash flows to understand is the 
first section — cash flow from operating activi­
ties. This section starts with net income and 
then lists several adjustments to net income. In 
addition to cash, several other asset accounts 
as well as several liability accounts are used 
in recording revenue and expenses in accrual 
accounting.
Changes in these asset and liability accounts 
during the year help or hurt cash flow, causing 
cash flow from profit (operating activities) to be 
higher or lower than the amount of profit. The 
rules are fairly straightforward:
	✓	An increase in an asset decreases cash 
flow.
	✓	A decrease in an asset increases cash 
flow.
	✓	An increase in a liability increases cash 
flow.
	✓	A decrease in a liability decreases cash 
flow.
In summary, asset changes work in reverse 
direction on cash flow, and liability changes 
work in the same direction.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
For instance, suppose the balance in this asset was $70,000 at the start of the 
year. This amount would have been charged to various operating expenses 
during the year. The business would end the year with $75,000 in the asset, 
which means it would have paid out $5,000 more than the amount charged to 
expenses. Therefore, the increase in the asset is shown as a negative adjust­
ment to net income (as you can see in Figure 4-1).
Accumulated depreciation increase
Like almost all companies, the business in the example in Figure 4-1 recorded 
depreciation expense to the year. Depreciation accounting in actual practice 
is somewhat controversial. The influence of the federal income tax law has 
caused deviations from what accountants should theoretically record as 
depreciation expense period by period over the actual useful lives of fixed 
assets. Speaking broadly, the useful lives over which assets are depreciated 
are too short, and, for no good reason, depreciation is front-loaded. The fed­
eral income tax law gives businesses rapid depreciation options as incentives 
to invest in long-term operating assets. Be that as it may, the concern here is 
with the cash-flow aspects of depreciation.
In Figure 4-1, the business recorded $85,000 depreciation expense for the 
year. This amount is one of the expenses deducted from sales revenue to 
determine net income for the year. In recording depreciation, a business 
increases the contra account accumulated depreciation instead of reducing 
the asset account property, plant, and equipment. The balance in the accu­
mulated depreciation account is deducted from the balance in the property, 
plant, and equipment asset account, and the difference, which is called the 
book value of the asset, is the value reported in the balance sheet.
	
The recording of depreciation does not require cash outlay. For this reason, 
it’s sometimes called only a book entry. The business paid cash when it origi­
nally purchased or constructed its fixed assets (property, plant, and equip­
ment). It does not have to pay a second time when using its fixed assets. 
But depreciation is real and factual, and fixed assets wear out over time or 
otherwise lose their usefulness to the business. Except the cost of land, which 
is not depreciated, all fixed assets are on the march to the junkyard. Because 
depreciation is not a cash outlay expense, the amount of depreciation for the 
year is a positive adjustment to net income.
Accounts payable decrease
A business makes many purchases on credit (unless it has a lousy credit 
rating and no vendors will extend it credit). Also, a business receives many 
bills (invoices) from a variety of sources — for utility costs, wireless and 
landline telephone and Internet services, property taxes, renewal of insur­
ance policies, and so on. These short-term liabilities generally have to be 
paid in a month, give or take a little. Until paid, the amounts sit in the liability 
called accounts payable.

 Chapter 4: Getting a Grip on the Statement of Cash Flows
	
Although not entirely correct in a technical sense, the practical way to think 
about accounts payable is that when recording an increase in this liability 
account, an expense account is also increased. When payments are made on 
this liability, cash decreases and the liability decreases. If the business starts 
and ends the year with the same balance of accounts payable, the cash out­
flow equals the amount of expenses recorded during the period. But usually 
the ending balance of accounts payable is higher or lower than the beginning 
balance, so net income needs a cash-flow adjustment.
In the example in Figure 4-1, the accounts payable balance decreased $20,000. 
In other words, the business paid down its accounts payable during the 
year. Cash outflow was $20,000 more than the amount of expenses that 
are deducted from sales revenue to determine net income for the year. 
Therefore, the $20,000 pay down on accounts payable is a negative cash-flow 
adjustment to net income.
Accrued expenses payable increase, and income tax payable increase
Changes in accrued expenses payable and income tax payable have the same 
impact on cash flow as the change in accounts payable. Both these operating 
liabilities increased during the year, whereas accounts payable decreased. 
Therefore, as you should expect, the cash-flow adjustment to net income is 
opposite to that caused by the decrease in accounts payable. The changes 
during the year in these liabilities are positive adjustments to net income 
(refer to Figure 4-1 for an example). Cash flow is higher because these two 
operating liabilities increased during the period.
	
When an operating liability increases during the period, the amount of cash 
outlay associated with the liability is less than the amount charged to expense 
in the period. The full amount of the expense is deducted from sales rev­
enue to determine profit (net income). The $15,000 increase in the accrued 
expenses payable liability means that this amount of expenses for the year 
was recorded by an increase in the liability, not by cash outlay. Likewise for 
the increase in income tax payable: The company’s actual cash outlay for 
income tax expense during the year was $5,000 less than the amount recorded 
to the expense for the year.
The final cash-flow tally from operating activities
In Figure 4-1, the cash flow from operating activities, after making several 
adjustments, is $420,000 for the year, which is considerably higher than the 
$350,000 net income for the year. In a particular situation, cash flow can be 
about equal to net income, or it can be much higher or lower than profit for 
the period. The difference depends on changes in the assets and liabilities 
used to record revenue and expenses. We examine different cash-flow sce­
narios in the later section “Comparing Cash-Flow Scenarios.”

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
Cogitating on cash flow 
from investing activities
If you made it through the last section, you can breathe easier now. You 
made it over the hump — the cash-flow adjustments to net income. The 
remaining two sections of the statement of cash flows are relatively straight­
forward, and you can navigate though the next part of the statement, cash 
flow from investing activities, without much guidance. But in this section we 
deal with a few potholes on the road through this type of cash flows. (If you 
want to review the difference between investing cash flows and the other two 
types, refer to “Distinguishing Cash Flows.”)
	
In one sense, every asset is an investment. In the broad sense of the term, a 
business “invests” in accounts receivable by making sales on credit that gen­
erate the receivables. Under this inclusive definition, a business “invests” in 
inventories and prepaid expenses.
Keep in mind, however, that the changes in accounts receivable, inventories, 
and prepaid expenses are not included in the investing activities section of 
the statement of cash flows. Instead, the changes are treated as adjustments 
to net income to determine cash flow from operating activities. Changes in 
other assets are reported in the cash flow from investing activities section of 
the statement of cash flows. In the example in Figure 4-1, the business has 
only one other asset — property, plant, and equipment. In other situations, a 
business may have investments in marketable securities or intangible assets.
In the example, the business didn’t make any disposals of investments 
during the period. It had no cash inflow from this source. On the other 
hand, it spent $400,000 in capital expenditures during the period to replace, 
upgrade, and expand its building, machines, tools, and equipment. By the 
way, the $400,000 outlay during the period does not include repair and main­
tenance costs on the company’s fixed assets. These routine upkeep costs are 
recorded to expense in the period. This particular expense is not disclosed 
in the external income statement of a business, but it must be reported in its 
federal income tax return.
Considering cash flow from 
financing activities
The last part of the statement of cash flows deals with financing activities. 
A business relies on certain short-term non-interest-bearing liabilities to 
finance, or provide part of the total capital it needs. Typically, the total of a 
company’s accounts payable, accrual expenses payable, and income tax pay­
able may be 10 or 20 percent or more of its total assets. In other words, these 
three liabilities provide a small but significant fraction of the total capital of

67
 Chapter 4: Getting a Grip on the Statement of Cash Flows
a business. Changes in these three operating liabilities are not reported as 
financing activities in the statement of cash flows. Instead, these changes are 
treated as adjustments to net income in order to determine cash flow from 
operating activities. Refer to Figure 4-1 to see an example.
Changes in debt borrowings, in other liabilities, and in the company’s 
owners’ equity are reported in the cash flow from financing activities section 
of the statement of cash flows. In the example, the business has short-term 
and long-term debt and reports two owners’ equity sources. In some situa­
tions, a business may record unusual types of long-term deferred liabilities 
that arise from recording certain expenses or losses. Changes in these spe­
cial types of liabilities during the year are reported in the cash flow from 
operating activities section, even though the placement of these long-term 
liability accounts is close to long-term debt liabilities in the balance sheet.
Reporting cash flows from financing activities may appear to be rather 
straightforward. But appearances can sometimes be deceiving. The purpose 
of this section in the statement of cash flows is to summarize changes during 
the period in the debt and equity capital of the business, but in many situa­
tions, disclosure problems are lurking under the surface.
Detailing debt changes
	
One issue concerns the turnover of short-term debt that came due during 
the year. Often a business doesn’t actually pay off its debt. Instead it rolls 
over (renews) the debt. The interest rate and other terms of the loan may 
change. Should only the net increase or decrease of short-term and long-term 
debt be reported? Or should the statement also disclose the gross turnover, 
which includes the totals for renewal of old loans as well as new loan activity? 
Different companies follow different reporting practices.
Because businesses want to keep the statement to a page in length, they 
don’t have all that much room in the statement of cash flows to go into a lot 
of detail. To clarify, a business should include relevant details in the foot­
notes of its financial statements. In the example in Figure 4-1, the business 
decreased its short-term debt a net $50,000 and increased its long-term debt 
$50,000. The two changes may be independent of one another, or maybe not. 
Perhaps the business persuaded its lender (say a bank) to stretch out the 
term of its short-term notes payable to make them long term. The particulars 
aren’t apparent.
Explaining equity changes
	
A business keeps two distinct types of accounts for owners’ equity. One is for 
capital activity between the business and its owners, which refers to the put­
ting in and taking out of capital by its shareowners. For example, a business 
may issue additional ownership shares or redeem some of its shares during 
the year. In the example in Figure 4-1, the business issued new shares for 
$25,000 and did not redeem any of its capital stock during the year. As you see 
in Figure 4-1, the cash inflow from issuing capital stock (or other ownership 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
68
Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
shares) is reported in the cash flow from financing activities section in the 
statement of cash flows.
	
Business owners tend to be sensitive to increases in the number of shares 
because they dilute ownership, reducing power per owner and potentially 
decreasing the cash dividend per share. For that reason, a business should 
comment on the reasons for issuing additional ownership shares, probably in 
the footnotes to its financial statements.
The other basic type of owner’s equity account is typically called retained 
earnings. Net income for the period increases the balance of this account 
(or, a loss for the period decreases the balance). (Net income is also the 
leadoff figure in the cash flow from operating activities section of the state­
ment of cash flows.) The $350,000 net income for the year (refer to Figure 4-1) 
increased the balance in the account.
Cash dividends paid to stockowners are also reported in the cash flow from 
financing activities section. Businesses have to decide whether to retain all 
the cash flow from operating activities (which may be done to help fund the 
growth of the business or to shore up its cash position) or to pay a cash 
dividend from profit to its shareowners. In the example in Figure 4-1, the 
business decided to distribute $70,000 in dividends to its shareowners, which 
equals 20 percent of its net income.
$70,000 cash dividends ÷ $350,000 net income = 20%
The business retained 80 percent, or $280,000 of its net income for the year. 
Therefore, its retained earnings increased $280,000 during the year.
	
There is no agreed-upon benchmark regarding the percent of net income that 
“should” be distributed as cash dividends from net income. One factor is the 
cash flow from operating activities. Obviously a business must have enough 
cash flow to pay cash dividends. Other demands on the cash flow are also a 
factor. For example, a business may need every cent of its cash flow for des­
perately needed upgrades and expansion of its fixed assets. Every business is 
a relatively unique case. Indeed, a business may be in entirely different cash 
circumstances year to year.
Some businesses have abundant cash flow but don’t pay cash dividends; 
instead they hoard cash. For many years, Microsoft didn’t pay a cash 
dividend — until it did. The absence of cash dividends in the financing 
activities section of the statement of cash flows reveals that the business 
did not pay cash dividends. However obvious that may seem, readers may 
not note the omission.
For clarity, businesses can explain their cash dividend policy in the footnotes 
or elsewhere in their financial reports. But in fact, such disclosure is not 
required by generally accepted financial reporting standards. Public compa­
nies have to be careful in what their press releases and chief executives say

 Chapter 4: Getting a Grip on the Statement of Cash Flows
about their cash dividend plans. Market prices of their stock shares depend 
on many factors, but anticipated cash dividends is one of the most important. 
A public company does not want to be accused of misleading investors about 
its future dividend plans, which can change abruptly because of changing 
business conditions. Private companies can be more relaxed about making 
comments concerning their cash dividend plans.
Getting to Know the Dual Personality
of the Statement of Cash Flows
The name itself — the statement of cash flows — would lead you to think that 
its purpose is limited to reporting cash flows and explaining the increase or 
decrease in cash during the period. The statement does serve this objective. 
However, reporting cash flows is not the whole and only purpose of the state­
ment. Cash is not the end of the story told by this financial statement — not 
at all. In some respects, cash flows aren’t even the most important informa­
tion being reported in the statement, despite the title and organization of 
information in the statement of cash flows.
	
The statement has a dual nature and twofold purpose: to summarize cash 
flows and to summarize changes in the financial condition of the business 
during the period. The changes in the financial condition of a business are 
very important and should not be overlooked. Cash flow may be satisfactory, 
but it doesn’t guarantee that changes in the financial condition of a business 
are satisfactory. Make the effort to read the statement of cash flows twice, as 
it were — first focusing on cash flows, and then focusing on changes assets, 
liabilities, and owners’ equity.
Spotting changes in financial condition
Cash is king, as the saying goes. But the managers of a business should pay 
close attention to its overall financial condition. Cash is just one piece in the 
financial-condition chess game of a business, and putting on blinders and 
watching only cash can lead to catastrophic results. A business’s managers 
should keep a careful eye on all assets as well as the liabilities and owners’ 
equity. Cash flow may be the most pressing problem facing a business, but 
after it gets its cash flow under control, it still has to keep its financial condi­
tion healthy, under control, and out of harm’s way.
	
After evaluating the statement of cash flows in terms of, well, cash flows, 
concentrate on the changes in the assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity of 
the business during the period. Ask whether there are any “outsize” changes 
during the year. In other words, did any relatively large changes signal a major 
shift in the policies or predicament of the business?

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
Suppose the business in the example had increased its long-term debt by 
$750,000 during the year. (In the example shown in Figure 4-1, the business 
increased its long-term debt by only $50,000.) The obvious questions are: 
Why did the business take on so much additional debt, and what did it do 
or will it do with this money? You should look for an explanation in the foot­
notes or in other communications from management that explain such a 
large step-up in the company’s long-term debt. The business may have a very 
good reason for it. Then again, taking on so much additional debt may be too 
risky and ill advised.
In the Figure 4-1 business example, the changes in assets, liabilities, and 
owners’ equity appear more or less in a normal range. The biggest change 
is the $400,000 additions to property, plant, and equipment. These capital 
expenditures are typically large amounts. Ideally, the financial report should 
include commentary by management on the reasons for the relatively large 
outlay for capital expenditures.
To interpret the changes in assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity that are 
reported in the statement of cash flows, you need to compare the amounts 
of the changes with the balances in the company’s assets, liabilities, and 
owners’ equity, which are reported in its balance sheet. As a matter of fact, 
the statement of cash flows provides a bridge from the balance sheet at the 
start of the period to the balance sheet at the end of the period.
Building the year-end balance sheet
The statement of cash flows is presented as a stand-alone statement, as are 
the balance sheet and income statement. Because each financial statement 
is presented on a separate page, you may lose sight of the fact that the three 
financial statements are tightly interwoven. For example, the balance in the 
accounts receivable asset is connected with sales revenue amount in the 
income statement, and the statement of cash flows provides the connecting 
links between the beginning and the ending balance sheets.
Figure 4-2 shows the beginning balance sheet of the business in the left 
column. The changes in assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity that are 
reported in the statement of cash flows are in the middle column, and these 
changes lead over to the ending balances in the right column. Note that two 
changes affect the ending balance of the owners’ equity account retained 
earnings: Net income is an increase in this account, and cash dividends are a 
decrease.

The changes in assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity taken all together can 
be thought of as the collection of decisions made by managers during the 
year. These changes are the outcomes of their actions (or perhaps not taking 
actions when they should have). Change is constant. A business is always 
doing things that change its financial condition. For instance, the business in 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
72
Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
Figure 4-2 allowed its accounts receivable to increase $70,000 during the year. 
In contrast, it reduced its inventory level $60,000. Hopefully, these changes 
were the results of carefully thought-out decisions to improve profit perfor­
mance and to keep the financial condition of the business in good order.
You’ll never see a situation in which all assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity 
accounts of a business remain unchanged or nearly so during the year. You’ll 
be confronted with many changes in the balance sheet accounts. To evalu­
ate the year overall, the trick is to look at the changes in their entirety and 
ask whether the business is better or worse off (or perhaps simply about the 
same) because of the changes.
	
Businesses do not include a supplementary explanation like Figure 4-2 in their 
financial reports. We show Figure 4-2 as a teaching tool to illustrate the tie-
ins between the changes during the period in assets, liabilities, and owners’ 
equity and the amounts reported in the statement of cash flows. Including a 
summary like Figure 4-2 in the financial report of a business wouldn’t be objec­
tionable. However, financial reports don’t explicitly integrate or connect the 
three primary financial statements to make the connections between the state­
ments more obvious. Each financial statement is reported as a tub standing on 
its own feet.
Comparing Cash-Flow Scenarios
One of the scariest comments business managers can hear from their 
accountant or CPA is “You have a cash-flow problem.” It’s like the famous line 
from Apollo 13, “Houston, we have a problem.” Of course, business managers 
should plan and closely monitor cash flow so that they don’t have to go into 
a panic mode to deal with it. But cash-flow problems have a habit of sneak­
ing up on a business. If a business is earning profit, many business managers 
simply assume that cash flow is satisfactory. Earning a profit means making 
money, doesn’t it? We hope you know better by now. Even if profit is good, 
cash flow can be bad.
	
Savvy business managers demand quarterly or monthly accounting reports on 
cash flows. They keep a close watch on the variables that drive cash flow from 
profit, which are the changes in the assets and liabilities used in recording 
revenue and expenses. If accounts receivable, for example, takes a big jump, 
the experienced manager knows that this increase hurts cash flow during the 
period. The manager understands that a part of the sales revenue used in cal­
culating profit has not been actually received as cash inflow by the end of the 
period. If inventories creep up, the perceptive manager knows that cash was 
spent to build up the inventory, which reduces cash flow during the period.

 Chapter 4: Getting a Grip on the Statement of Cash Flows
A cash-flow problem can arise out of the blue (as discussed in the sidebar 
“If your bank pulls the plug”). As we address in Chapter 11, securing and 
managing debt capital, which are necessary for good cash flow, can be tricky. 
When a business is said to have a cash-flow problem, most often the mean­
ing is that the business isn’t generating enough positive cash flow from profit 
(operating activities) or that its cash flow is negative. We explain the calcula­
tion of cash flow from operating activities in the earlier section “Adjusting 
your way to cash flow from operating activities.” But if your calculations turn 
up an ugly truth about your situation, you’ll need to know what to do to fix it. 
This section explores different cash-flow scenarios, good and bad.
Starting with cash flow in a steady state
Suppose that over the last few years, a business has been in a relatively 
steady state. Its sales revenue and profit have been relatively constant year 
to year. Its managers keep accounts receivable, inventories, and prepaid 
expenses under control, which means that the balances in these assets are 
consistent with sales revenue and operating costs. The managers also con­
trol accounts payable, accrued expenses payable, and income tax payable. 
The balances in these liabilities are in line with its total expenses and profit 
for the year. In this steady-state scenario, what’s the story with cash flow?
If your bank pulls the plug
If your business has an existing loan come due 
and all of a sudden the bank refuses to roll it 
over, you’re facing a serious cash-flow prob­
lem. The bank, in addition to refusing to renew 
the loan, may even demand immediate pay­
ment of all loans. Of course, this situation would 
put the business into a real bind, and not just 
because of the lost capital from the bank. After 
word got around that the bank had stopped 
lending money to your business, you’d find con­
vincing another source of debt capital to loan 
you money that much harder. The business 
probably would find it difficult, if not impossible, 
to raise equity capital on short notice to replace 
its debt capital. Scrambling for more equity 
capital is a worst-case scenario. Your business 
may find a source, but the price it would be 
asked to pay for the new equity capital would 
probably be steep.
If your bank senses that you’re not doing a good 
job managing your cash flow, the loan officer 
will probably become very nervous. Try to avoid 
any blunders, such as making a late interest 
payment, because a single incident may cause 
the bank to reach its tipping point and refuse 
to renew your loan. It’s extremely important 
to keep your debt sources convinced that you 
know what you’re doing in managing cash flow.

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
In this situation, the cash-flow adjustments to net income are close to zero — 
not significant — except one, depreciation. Other than depreciation, the 
cash-flow adjustments to net income are negligible because the assets and 
liabilities didn’t change during the year (or the changes were minor so as not 
to matter much). However, depreciation has to be added to net income to 
determine cash flow.
To illustrate the steady-state scenario, we modify the example shown in 
Figure 4-1. Assume that the company’s accounts receivable, inventories, 
prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses payable, and income 
tax payable did not change during the year. Their ending balances are equal 
to their beginning balances. Therefore, depreciation is the only cash-flow 
adjustment to net income. In this scenario, the company’s cash flow is as fol­
lows (refer to Figure 4-1 for data):
$350,000 net income + $85,000 depreciation expense = $435,000 cash flow
Therefore, the company has $435,000 cash available for general purposes, 
such as replacing fixed assets and paying dividends to shareowners.
	
Now, instead of earning $350,000 profit in the steady state, suppose the 
company breaks even. In other words, its net income for the period is zero 
(expenses equal revenue). The company’s cash flow from operating activities 
would be
$0 net income + $85,000 depreciation expense = $85,000 cash flow
Despite earning no profit, the business would have $85,000 cash flow, all 
of it attributable to depreciation. The break-even scenario isolates atten­
tion on depreciation, which is not a cash outlay in the period the expense is 
recorded. The story isn’t over, however. The cash inflow from sales revenue 
each period includes an amount toward the recovery of the capital invested 
property, plant, and equipment, or fixed assets. In the break-even scenario, 
the business recoups $85,000 of the money invested in its fixed assets in 
past years.
	
Almost all businesses record depreciation every year, but that recordkeeping 
may not be the end of the story for cash-flow adjustment in stable conditions. 
A business may record other kinds of noncash expenses, such as amortization 
on intangible assets, that are first cousins to depreciation. Also, a business 
may record noncash gains and losses in the year. For example, a business 
may record a loss due to an uninsured flood loss that destroyed one of its 
warehouses. The asset is written off and the loss is recorded; no cash outlay is 
caused by the loss (other than the cost of removing the rubble). In these situ­
ations, you have to add back the noncash losses and subtract noncash gains 
(writing up the market value of investments, for example).

 Chapter 4: Getting a Grip on the Statement of Cash Flows
Assessing cash-flow effects 
of growth and of decline
To assess your cash-flow scenario, start with profit plus depreciation and 
then ask, why is the company’s cash flow higher or lower that this bench­
mark? You know the answer, don’t you? (If you have no idea, here’s a hint: 
Refer to the earlier section “Adjusting your way to cash flow from operating 
activities.”) The changes during the period in the assets accounts receivable, 
inventories, and prepaid expenses, as well as the changes in the liabilities 
accounts payable, accrued expenses payable, and income tax payable, help 
or hinder cash flow. To remind you: Asset increases and liability decreases 
hurt cash flow, and asset decreases and liability increases help cash flow.
	
The amount of depreciation is not driven by current events or recent transac­
tions; it’s largely historical. The calculation of depreciation is based on a pre­
determined schedule that reaches back to the earliest years in which the fixed 
assets were acquired. In most situations, the bulk of a company’s fixed assets 
were acquired some years ago. In sharp contrast, the changes in the other 
cash-flow factors — accounts receivable, inventories, and so on — are driven 
by recent transactions.
In the example scenario way back in Figure 4-1, the changes in assets and 
liabilities cause a $15,000 net negative adjustment to cash flow. (Do the arith­
metic to check our calculation if you like.) Taking into account these several 
changes, cash flow is calculated as follows:
$435,000 cash flow from net income and depreciation – $15,000 net 
change in other cash flow factors = $420,000 cash flow
When a business experiences rapid sales growth, its accounts receivable 
and inventories grow rapidly also. Sizable increases in these two areas can 
put a big dent in current cash flow. These negative cash-flow effects can be 
partially offset with increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
payable, but only in part. Rapid growth causes a cash-flow penalty as the 
business pumps up its receivables and inventories. In extreme cases, the 
increases in accounts receivable and inventories can get very large and cause 
a negative cash flow for the year.
When a business has a rapid decline in sales, its cash flow, ironically, may 
improve because the business’s accounts receivable and inventory assets 
decline as rapidly as sales. However, a business may not be able to reduce 
expenses as quickly as its drop in sales, which results in a loss. In these situa­
tions, a business may suffer a negative cash flow: Cash inflow from sales may 
be significantly less than cash outflow for expenses. See the next section for 
more info.

Suppose, for example, that sales revenue increases 30 percent over last year. 
You would then expect a corresponding increase in accounts receivable and 
inventories (usually the two biggest cash-flow adjustments to net income). 
Alternatively, if sales revenue drops 30 percent, these two assets probably 
drop more or less the same percent. However, life is not so simple. The actual 
changes in receivables and inventories may be out of step with the change in 
sales revenue, and there may be good business reasons for the deviations. 
Managers should know the reasons, of course. However, discrepancies 
between changes in accounts receivable and inventories and the growth 
or decline in sales revenue are generally not commented on in the financial 
reports.
Understanding negative cash flow
A negative cash flow means simply that the first section of the statement 
of cash flows (refer to Figure 4-1) reports a decrease in cash flow from the 
operating activities of the business during the period. Unless the decrease 
is offset with cash increases from investing activities (possible but not too 
likely) or increases from financing activities, the business suffers a decrease 
in its cash balance during the year.
Mention that a business has negative cash flow, and most people have a 
knee-jerk reaction: The business must be in deep trouble and on the edge 
of bankruptcy. Not so fast. In reading a financial report, look for the reasons 
behind the numbers, which can tell you the real story. The causes of a nega­
tive cash flow for the year may be temporary and unlikely to repeat in later 
years. Then again, the reasons may be systemic and likely to continue until 
drastic action is taken by the business.
The starting point is looking at why cash flow from operating activities is 
negative. The worst-case scenario is when a business records a large net loss 
for the year and the cash-flow adjustments don’t mitigate the loss. Suppose, 
for example, that a business reports $2,000,000 bottom-line loss for its most 
recent year. It recorded $300,000 depreciation expense for the year. So its 
negative cash flow is $1,700,000 before looking at the changes in its other 
assets and liabilities. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventories com­
bined with increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses payable may 
be large enough to overcome the negative $1,700,000 cash flow, but prob­
ably not. In fact, the changes in the assets and liabilities may be in the wrong 
direction and aggravate negative cash flow.
	
When a business has negative cash flow, financial analysts pay particular 
attention to its cash burn rate. The amount of negative cash flow per month is 
divided into its available cash balance to see how long the business can sur­
vive before it runs out of cash. During their start-up phases, new businesses 
typically have relatively large negative cash flow until they get over the hump 
and start bringing in enough sales revenue to get the company into the profit

77
 Chapter 4: Getting a Grip on the Statement of Cash Flows
column. The cash burn rate is a rough measure of how long they have to get 
their sales up to speed.
It hardly needs mentioning that a business should quickly solve its negative 
cash-flow problem. If it’s caused by a one-time extraordinary event that won’t 
be repeated (for example, a business may have been forced to make a huge 
expenditure to remove asbestos in its plant and offices), then the loss won’t 
be repeated next year and the managers have nothing to worry about. On 
the other hand, the problem may be that the business’s sales prices are too 
low and/or its expenses are too high. In that case, unless things are turned 
around, the business is on a negative cash-flow death march.
Recognizing Problems with the 
Statement of Cash Flows
As we note in the opening to this chapter, the statement of cash flows has been 
around for about a quarter of a century. At the time of writing this book, gener­
ally accepted financial reporting standards — which include the requirement 
that a statement of cash flows be included with financial reports — apply to 
all businesses, public and private and large and small. However, some facts 
about the statement of cash flows make it a less-than-ideal tool for under­
standing the cash-flow situation of your own business and that of other busi­
nesses. The primary problems occur when small businesses skip creating the 
statement altogether and when businesses include too much or not enough 
information in the statement.
Getting skipped by small businesses
Practicing CPAs would admit off the record that private companies are cut a 
lot of slack in financial reporting. Some private companies don’t even include 
the statement of cash flows in their financial reports. They include a balance 
sheet and an income statement, but not a cash-flows statement. In contrast, 
public companies, without exception, include a statement of cash flows in 
their external financial reports, because failing to do so would jeopardize 
the trading in their securities. Their CPA auditors would find fault and the 
Securities & Exchange Commission would take action to force the business to 
report a statement of cash flows.
	
Smaller businesses may find preparing a cash-flow statement difficult. Many 
small businesses do not employ a full-time qualified accountant. Their book­
keeper may not know how to prepare this financial statement. The small busi­
ness may decide not to hire a CPA or other trained person who knows how 
to prepare the statement of cash flows. This statement isn’t prepared in a 
straightforward manner from the accounts kept by a business; the cash-flow

Part I: Fitting Cash Flow into the Big Picture of Running a Business 
figures reported in the statement have to be “backed out” from the informa­
tion in the accounts of the business and the comparative balance sheet of the 
business at the start and end of the period. We don’t go into the accounting 
techniques for preparing the statement of cash flows, because preparing this 
statement is a demanding “extra step” that many private businesses evidently 
either cannot do or don’t bother to do. We’ve even talked to CPAs who aren’t 
sure footed regarding the preparation of this statement. Accountants are not 
cash-flow people.
As of 2011, a movement is underway to allow private businesses to make 
exceptions and modifications to generally accepted financial accounting 
standards, but nothing has been set in concrete yet. We would be surprised if 
private businesses were allowed to skip reporting a statement of cash flows. 
But you never know.
Providing too much or 
too little information
Another problem with the statement of cash flows concerns the number of 
lines of information in the statement. Many cash flow statements have 30, 
40, or more lines of information. (The cash flow statement in Figure 4-1 is 
relatively simple, with only 18 lines of information.) Therefore, this financial 
statement can be very demanding on the reader. Should a business expect 
readers to spend 30 minutes or more reading the statement? In short, all too 
many statements of cash flow suffer from information overload. Therefore, 
readers have to pick and choose what information they want to absorb; most 
won’t take time to pore over every line.
Despite the sometimes overwhelming amount of information in the statement 
of cash flows, it doesn’t really lay bare the cash-flow strategy and policies 
of a business. You can (and theoretically should) read the statement line 
by line. But after reading all the lines, getting a clear picture of the financial 
strategy of a business is still difficult. What’s needed is management com­
mentary and explanation concerning cash flow and the company’s long-run 
cash-flow plan in the context of its overall financial strategy. Here’s one 
example: If a business is sitting on a large cash balance and has a strong 
cash flow, it would be helpful for the CEO or president to explain what’s 
going on. But you don’t usually find explanatory comments about cash flow 
in financial reports.
Another complicating detail is that in many statements of cash flows, one or 
more amounts reported in the statement cannot be reconciled or matched 
up with their corresponding changes during the year that are reported in 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
79
 Chapter 4: Getting a Grip on the Statement of Cash Flows
the balance sheet. For example, the amount of the adjustment to net income 
for the change in accounts receivable may not tie out with the difference 
between the beginning and ending balances that are reported for accounts 
receivable in the balance sheet. Many readers may not care about such 
loose ends. But the lack of clear-cut connections between the comparative 
balance sheet and the amounts in the statement of cash flows is frustrating 
to financial analysts and others who do a close reading of a company’s 
financial report.
	
Business managers definitely should understand and control cash flow. 
However, the design of the statement of cash flows for external reports is not 
necessarily the best layout for internal reporting to managers. Business man­
agers, working with their accountants, should devise a report design that is 
most useful for their planning and controlling of cash flows. The statement of 
cash flows that is included in external financial reports should not be a strait­
jacket for the internal reporting of cash flows to managers. (We explore cash-
flow reporting for managers in Chapter 7.)
The role of cash flow in business valuation
When a company’s owners decide to put the 
business up for sale, and in certain other situa­
tions, they need to put a value on the business. 
The number one factor in determining a value 
of a business is its cash flow from operating 
activities, which typically is called simply cash 
flow. Other factors come into play, including the 
debt load of the business, continuity or replace­
ment of management, long-run business trends, 
the location(s) of the business, and many other 
considerations. But in most situations, the dom­
inant factor is the business’s potential to gener­
ate future cash flow.
The topic of business valuation is beyond the 
scope of this book. If you want to delve into the 
topic, we recommend our book Small Business 
Financial Management Kit For Dummies (John 
Wiley & Sons, Inc.).

n the good old days, before the financial crisis that started to engulf the 
world’s capital markets and economies in 2007, business owners and 
managers tended to focus on the financial statement with the highest degree of 
perceived value: the income statement. With capital plentiful (whether it was 
debt or equity), the focus of most businesses was to drive top-line revenue and 
improve bottom-line profitability. This approach was far and away one of the 
easiest, most reliable (or so they thought), and most tried-and-proven methods 
for company owners and managers to evaluate the performance of their 
businesses (not to mention to assure their year-end bonuses). As for managing 
the balance sheet and statement of cash flows (the two forgotten financial 
statements), well, that’s what bean counters were for, because the financial 
information provided from these reports was deemed simply too complicated 
or less important than sales and profitability. But over the past three years, 
business owners and managers learned very quickly and painfully that if their 
business wasn’t liquid with readily available access to cash and capital, which 
at its heart is a strong balance sheet, life was going to be very difficult.
	
One of the best descriptions offered about the so-called “Great Recession” 
experienced in the United States was provided by a number of economists who 
simply stated the obvious. Past recessions were basically income-statement 
driven in that sales levels decreased, resulting in lower profits being earned 
and thus the need to reduce expenses, including eliminating employees where 
needed. What separated the recent recession from others, as noted by Richard 
Koo (of the Nomura Research Institute) among others, is that it was a balance 
sheet driven event, centered in the unavailability of capital, cash, and liquidity 
to businesses. To companies that had strong balance sheets with ample cash 
and liquidity, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity was presented to capitalize on 
the marketplace turmoil by taking market share. And for the companies that 
didn’t (like AIG and GM, which benefited enormously from the generosity of 
the government), unfortunately, weak balance sheets proved catastrophic.

The essence of a financially strong business resides not just in how much 
profit is generated but also, more importantly, in how much financial muscle 
and capital resources reside in the balance sheet. So this chapter is designed 
first to provide tools to assist you with understanding what the balance 
sheet is really saying and then to let you know how the balance sheet can be 
worked with, managed, and controlled to improve cash flows and financial 
strength.
Reading the Balance Sheet from 
a Cash-Flow Perspective
The balance sheet is most often viewed from a relatively simple perspective 
of assessing what assets a company owns compared to its obligations or 
liabilities. The difference between those numbers is the company’s net 
equity (which hopefully is a positive number for most businesses). If you 
are evaluating the balance sheet from only this perspective, however, you 
miss a much larger and more important concept: understanding the balance 
sheet from a cash-flow point of view. This perspective is focused not on the 
stated value of a company’s assets and liabilities but rather on how quickly 
assets can be converted into cash (that is, sources of cash) and how soon 
liabilities will consume cash (the uses of cash). The basic structure of almost 
all company balance sheets is centered on this one all-important concept: the 
proper ordering of assets and liabilities.
	
The balance sheet must balance! That is, total assets must equal total liabilities 
plus net equity. This concept is so simple, you may ask why we even bother to 
mention it, and the reason is simple. For non-accounting/financial types, this 
simplest of equations is often the most difficult to comprehend.
The standard balance sheet structure used by most businesses is very 
straightforward and is based on the following ordering concepts:
	
✓	All company assets are listed on the left side of the balance sheet 
(when the balance sheet is presented in a side-by-side format, as in 
Figure 5-1).
	
✓	The assets are classified as either current or long term.
 
• A current asset classification assumes the asset will either be 
converted into cash within one year (as is the case with trade 
receivables) or, conversely, the asset will be consumed within one 
year (like a prepaid insurance policy).
 
• Long-term assets represent assets that will convert into cash past 
a year period (like a note receivable due in three years) or will be 
consumed over an extended period of time (for example, equipment 
used to manufacture products).

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
85
 Chapter 5: Mining the Balance Sheet for Cash
	
✓	All company liabilities are listed on the right side of the balance sheet 
(when the balance sheet is presented in a side-by-side format, as in 
Figure 5-1).
	
✓	The liabilities are classified as either current or long-term.
 
• A current liability classification assumes that the liability will either 
consume cash within one year (like trade payables) or will be 
worked off within one year (a customer deposit which turns into a 
sale, for example).
 
• Long-term liabilities will consume cash past a year period (for 
instance, a note payable due in three years) or will be worked off 
over an extended period of time (like a settlement on a lawsuit that 
will be repaid over three years).
	
✓	The company’s equity accounts are presented on the right side of the 
balance sheet, after the liabilities and clearly segregated from them, 
with no distinction made between current and long term. Equity is 
generally considered a long-term or permanent commitment to support 
business operations.
Figure 5-1 represents an example of a standard balance sheet for a distribution 
company that we use as an example throughout this chapter.
In the title of the balance sheet in Figure 5-1 is the word Unaudited, which 
is a clue to the reader to be aware of the chance of mistakes, omissions, or 
irregularities. As we address throughout this chapter, the difference between 
audited and unaudited financial information is as significant as the difference 
between night and day. Audited financial statements indicate that an 
independent and qualified third party (most commonly a certified public 
accountant) has examined, tested, reviewed, and evaluated the financial 
statements in accordance with GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) 
and rendered an opinion on the quality of the financial statements (in an 
attached report). Unaudited financial statements generally are prepared 
internally by the company’s management without any third-party verification, 
so obviously they carry higher levels of risk than audited financial statements 
in terms of assessing the financial health of a business and basing a decision 
on the assessment (such as extending credit to a customer).
How assets are listed in the balance 
sheet in relation to generating cash
	
Upon close review of the ordering of assets in the balance sheet in Figure 5-1, 
you can see that the flow is very logically based on the nearness of turning 
assets into cash (or being consumed internally). We take a look at each 
category of asset in this section.

Trade accounts receivables
Trade accounts receivable represent the final stage of the selling cycle before 
the sale actually turns into cash. Generally, trade accounts receivable are 
listed right after cash because this asset class tends to turn over and convert 
to cash relatively quickly. Although the actual conversion time (that is, from 
the point of which credit is extended to the point cash is received) varies 
between different types of businesses, a range of 30 to 45 days is very 
commonplace for companies that extend credit terms to customers. This 
calculation is known as the days sales outstanding in receivables.
Inventory
Next up in the asset-ordering structure is inventory, which is usually comprised 
of three subcomponents including raw materials, WIP (work in process, or 
partially completed products), and finished goods. Inventory takes longer 
to turn into cash, because it first must be produced or purchased, and then 
sold (with a trade receivable generated), and finally turned into cash. No set 
standard tells you how much inventory a company should keep on hand to 
support ongoing operations because the numbers vary wildly by different 
industries. For companies that manufacture goods, the inventory levels tend 
to be higher as a result of having to support the three primary types of 
inventory (raw, WIP, and finished goods). For distribution companies that

87
 Chapter 5: Mining the Balance Sheet for Cash
generally only carry finished goods, the amount of inventory tends to be 
lower (in relation to the revenue level of the company), and for retail 
companies such as Walmart, the amount of inventory is even less (because 
the goal is to quickly turn over inventory.
Prepaid expenses
Prepaid expenses generally consist of insurance policies that cover a period 
of time (for instance, a general liability insurance policy that covers the 
company for a year), rents for facilities and equipment (which are usually 
paid in advance in the preceding month), advertising programs to reserve 
space in different media forms such as the Internet and magazines, and 
various other expenses paid for in advance.
Unlike trade accounts receivable and inventory, which a company strives to 
turn into cash, prepaid expenses are not likely to be turned into cash. These 
expenses are consumed over a period of time to support continued company 
operations. But this doesn’t excuse management from properly controlling 
and monitoring these types of assets, as your vendors, whether it’s your 
landlord or advertising agency, would like nothing more than for you to pay 
in advance so they can use your cash.
	
In order to proactively manage prepaid expenses to limit tying up cash, active 
negotiation is critical. If the landlord wants two months of rent on deposit, 
offer one (especially if it’s a tenant’s market). If a law firm or advertising 
agency wants a large retainer to start work, offer a hint that you need to 
obtain a competitive bid from another firm but would get started if the upfront 
cash requirement was reduced. If the insurance company wants your general 
liability policy for the year paid in advance, request quarterly installments. In 
most cases, the parties requesting the cash have the room to be flexible.
Other current assets
The final type of asset located in the current asset section of the balance 
sheet is generally reserved as a catchall for “other” current assets. These 
assets may include a temporary advance provided to an employee, a short-term 
deposit or retainer paid, other non-operational-based receivables such as an 
income tax refund expected to be received within one year, and so on. Some 
of these assets may in fact turn into cash, while others may not. But both 
demand the same level of management support, because, similar to prepaid 
expenses, other current assets can quickly consume cash.
Various strategies are available to help manage other current assets (in 
terms of consuming cash), such as establishing a clear company policy 
where employee advances are limited to 50 percent of an employee’s 
monthly compensation and must be repaid within 30 days and making sure 
that estimated income tax payments are as accurate as possible (to avoid 
overpaying).

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
	
Some types of current assets lumped into “other” may be separately 
presented if they are deemed material or if multiple immaterial assets are 
grouped together. In the accounting world, the use of the words material and 
immaterial is very important to understand. If an asset is deemed to be 
immaterial in size, then it tends to get lumped together with other smaller 
assets and classified in the catchall “other current assets.” If an asset is 
deemed material, then it’s presented separately in the financial statements. Of 
course, the ultimate decision as to what is material or immaterial has led to 
more than a few lively discussions between management, auditors, and other 
external parties.
Property, plant, and equipment
Property, plant, and equipment is the primary category for long-term assets. 
This grouping of assets includes basically all types of production equipment, 
machinery, facility leasehold improvements, autos, buildings, land, furniture, 
fixtures, and so on — everything owned by the company and anticipated 
to be used/consumed in its regular operations over an extended period of 
time (ranging from at least 1 year to as long as 30 years). Similar to prepaid 
expenses, these assets aren’t turned into cash directly but rather provide 
an investment basis for a business to deliver its products or services to the 
market in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible. Furthermore, 
these assets are depreciated over the time period during which the asset is 
anticipated to be consumed. Some assets, such as computers, have a very 
short depreciation time period of just a few years. For other assets, such as a 
building, a time period of 25 years may be used to depreciate the asset. The 
accumulation of depreciation of all asset types is summed and reflected as a 
reduction to the original cost of this group of assets to produce a net asset 
value.
Other assets
All other assets owned by the company that are long term in nature (that 
is, their values will take more than a year to be realized) are the last items 
presented in the asset section of the balance sheet. Common types of other 
assets include company-owned intellectual property (such as patents, 
trademarks, and software development costs), deferred tax assets, permanent 
deposits, and notes receivable (greater than a year due). Similar to other 
current assets, some of these long-term types of assets may eventually turn 
into cash, such as a long-term note receivable, whereas others are consumed 
in the business, such as company intellectual property.
The long-term asset segment of the balance sheet is subject to the same 
concept of material versus immaterial as the current asset segment. As 
a company becomes older, grows larger, and undertakes more complex 
transactions, more long-term assets may be deemed material and disclosed 
separately on the balance sheet. You see more separate disclosures for other 
long-term assets than for other current assets.

 Chapter 5: Mining the Balance Sheet for Cash
How liabilities are listed in the balance 
sheet in relation to consuming cash
As with assets, the ordering of liabilities in Figure 5-1 is based on the relative 
closeness of when the liability has to be satisfied and consume or use cash.
Trade accounts payable
To start, the liability that will most likely consume company cash in the 
shortest time period is generally trade accounts payable. Trade accounts 
payable represents valid claims against the company for the purchases of 
goods or services that have been formally presented to and approved by the 
company. For most companies, trade accounts payable require payment 
anywhere from 15 to 60 days of the date of the balance sheet.
	
One of the most effective ways to generate extra cash for a company is to 
request that vendors and suppliers offer extended payment terms for paying 
invoicing. For example, a jewelry retailer that generates a large percentage of 
its annual sales during the Christmas holiday season needs to secure inventory 
well in advance of the actual selling season to make sure the proper type and 
amount of products are available. Requesting an additional 60 days of time to 
remit payment to manage seasonal cash-flow pressure is more than acceptable, 
and the inventory may be ordered and purchased in the summer but not paid 
for in cash until December. Countless other situations are utilized by companies 
to extend payment terms, but the point remains the same. Using the cash of 
other businesses to support your operation can be a very inexpensive source 
of capital.
Accrued liabilities
After trade accounts payable, accrued liabilities are generally the next item 
listed in the current liability section of the balance sheet. Accrued liabilities 
consist of obligations a company knows it has incurred but doesn’t yet know 
a final amount or due date for. Obligations for future commissions, property 
taxes, product warranties, employee vacations, and so on all fall into this 
category and are quite often based on estimates (initially) to ensure that a 
reasonable calculation of the obligation due is reflected in the financial 
statements.
Most accrued liabilities eventually consume cash in one fashion or another 
but may take slightly longer than traditional trade accounts payable. For 
example, a vendor invoice provided from a supplier with net 30-day payment 
terms will consume cash in approximately 30 days. Commissions accrued 
for a sales representative that are due and payable based on when the sale is 
actually received in cash may not be paid out for 45 to 60 days.

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
Line of credit borrowings
Line of credit borrowings represent the amount of borrowings a company 
utilizes from a working capital lending agreement established with a bank 
or other lender. The working capital lending agreement is almost always 
collateralized by either a company’s trade accounts receivable or inventory. 
For a more detailed understanding of how these agreements are structured, 
see Chapter 11. Generally, the term for most of these agreements is one year 
in length, indicating that a current liability is present.
One controversial way to improve the current ratio of a business is to make 
sure the working capital lending agreement has an expiration date greater 
than one year. For example, if your fiscal year ends on 12/31/10 and your 
working capital lending agreement expires on 6/30/12, then most auditors 
consider this a long-term liability because it expires 18 months after the 
year-end. By moving the liability from current to long-term, a business’s 
current ratio calculation appears stronger. But at issue is the fact that the 
lending agreement, which may be considered long-term because of its 
expiration date, is secured by current assets that generally will turn into 
cash in well less than a year. Or looking at it from another perspective, if 
the assets securing the lending agreement, such as trade receivables, are 
substantially collected within four months, then the outstanding balance on 
the lending agreement needs to decrease to stay in compliance.
So is this really matching current assets with current liabilities? Well, we 
leave that discussion to the auditors. What’s important to remember is that 
even though the lending agreement may be classified as long-term in the 
financial statements, an understanding of how that liability may consume 
short-term cash flows should be clear.
Current portion of long-term debt
Unlike line-of-credit borrowings, the current portion of long-term debt 
represents the portion of note-payable borrowings that’s due within one 
year. For example, if you borrow $1 million to finance equipment purchases 
and the loan must be repaid in 60 equal principal payments of $16,666.67 
each, then the $200,000 you pay in cash in the first 12 months is considered a 
current liability. This system of apportioning applies to all forms of long-term 
debt, including formal notes payable, capital lease obligations, issued bonds, 
and others.
Other current liabilities
As you may have guessed, other current liabilities are basically the opposite of 
other current assets. Other current liabilities may include deferred revenue 
(like an annual license fee billed to customers in one installment but earned 
over a 12-month period), customer deposits, and other miscellaneous current 
liabilities. Similar to prepaid expenses, certain other current liabilities tend to 
be earned back into the business and ultimately don’t consume cash.

 Chapter 5: Mining the Balance Sheet for Cash
Guaranteed debt commitments
This group covers basically all long-term liabilities that have set payment 
terms and that are subordinated by a legally binding agreement such as 
notes payable, loans, capital lease obligations, and other forms of debt. As 
previously discussed, the portion of the debt commitments that is due within 
12 months is classified as current liabilities, leaving the balance to be treated 
as long-term liabilities.
Other long-term liabilities
The classification of other long-term liabilities captures various other long-
term business obligations including commitments, contingencies, deferred 
revenue earned past 12 months, and others. For most businesses, other 
long-term liabilities are generally fairly small in size. However, an example of 
a large long-term liability is an accrual for the restoration of a mining site to 
its original state by a mining operation after the mineral has been extracted. 
Over a period of time, the mine operator estimates how much restoring the 
property (after the mining activities are completed) will amount to, realizes 
an expense in the current financial statements to account for this cost, and 
then records the future long-term liability to properly disclose the anticipated 
obligation. Eventually, well out in the future, the mine is closed and money is 
then spent to reclaim the property.
What the balance sheet doesn’t 
disclose about cash flows
Despite all the information the balance sheet does provide on cash flows, it 
only represents part of the cash-flow story. Valuable information must be 
harvested from other sources to truly understand a business’s complete 
cash-flow picture. In this section, we give you an overview of the balance 
sheet’s limitations.
Capturing only a moment in time
Remember that the balance sheet is based on a snapshot of a company’s 
financial condition at a point in time. It’s very different from the income 
statement and the cash-flow statement, which measure the performance 
of a business over a period of time (monthly, quarterly, or annually). The 
balance sheet is a great tool to help understand where cash has been 
invested/committed and what source provided the cash, but it doesn’t offer 
an explanation of the entire cash-flow cycle.
Reflecting history more accurately than the present
The balance sheet provides a historical perspective on the cost or book 
value of the assets and the amount of liabilities or obligations owed by a 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
92
Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
business. The balance sheet doesn’t provide a proper picture of what the 
assets may actually be worth in the market if an asset needs to be liquidated 
outside the normal course of business. For example, if a company needs to 
raise cash relatively quickly, it may be forced to sell assets at a discount to 
cost or the net book value. In the same breath, a building or piece of land 
purchased decades ago may be grossly understated in value as a result of 
long-term appreciation in commercial real estate.
	
Any company that experienced pain during the Great Recession and had to 
pledge assets against a loan quickly became familiar with the acronym FLV. 
FLV stands for forced liquidation value and is a tool used by lenders that estimates 
the value of an asset in the worst possible scenario (that is, a forced or fire 
sale of the asset required in a hostile market). They use this figure to calculate 
the amount of a loan they’re willing to extend to make sure that at any point in 
time, if the company can’t repay the loan, then the asset offered as collateral 
for the loan can be liquidated and the lender will be covered. A mistake 
businesses often make is assuming that just because they paid X dollars for an 
asset means that the asset still has a reasonable value compared to the original 
cost and can borrow against this value. Management’s somewhat overly 
optimistic perception of asset values may lead them to believe they have more 
assets available to pledge as collateral and thus can borrow higher amounts.
Failing to help with future plans
When analyzing a company’s cash flow, a simple historical evaluation of the 
financial statements most likely doesn’t suffice, especially for companies 
that are undergoing a significant change in the operating model or are new 
and anticipate rapid growth. As much as a business’s historical financial 
information may support the “hows” of cash flow (that is, how much cash 
has been consumed by asset growth? how much cash was burned to support 
the launch of a business? and so on), it doesn’t support management’s future 
plans. If managers need to know what source of cash is available to support 
future operations or know when the company will run out of cash at its 
current growth rate, they need to be fully engaged in the company’s strategic 
planning process and have access to and understand all critical reports, 
goals, or objectives.
Offering internal information
The balance sheet cannot tell a company how much cash may be available 
from external business sources to support its operations. Debt and equity 
markets are constantly changing. One year may provide more financing 
options than you can shake a stick at, and another year you may find that 
basically every available option has been eliminated. For an example, look no 
farther than the period of 2006, when capital was readily available, to 2009, 
when the debt and equity markets basically ceased to operate.
In order to gain a complete understanding of a business’s cash-flow cycle and 
properly manage cash resources, you need to digest and understand all relevant

93
 Chapter 5: Mining the Balance Sheet for Cash
information, from additional internal financial statements, such as the income 
statement, to available external data on the state of capital markets.
	
Banks tend to have far more capital/cash to support your business when you 
least need it. And conversely, when your business is in greatest need of 
capital/cash, the banks seem to have little to offer. This drives home the 
importance of planning, planning, and more planning (covered in Chapters 8 
and 9) and the need to always save for a rainy day.
Giving the Balance Sheet a 
More Thorough Examination
In the health industry, as a patient becomes older, his health risks tend 
to increase, and, as a result, more thorough examinations commonly are 
required. Well, the same logic holds for the balance sheet. When companies 
get older and begin to mature, their balance sheets tend to become more 
complex as, over time, the volume and diversity of transactions increase. As 
a result, the aging of the company and its financial statements often trigger 
the accumulation of excess baggage (from years of neglect) on the balance 
sheet, which, if left unchecked, can quickly mislead management as to the 
company’s financial health and strength.
The goal of this section is to provide a clear understanding of how to perform 
a basic financial analysis on the balance sheet to help you identify where 
problems may reside, when assets are lying to you, and why your liabilities 
may not be telling the truth.
	
Just because an asset is stated at “cost” on the balance sheet doesn’t mean 
that the value of the asset if sold or liquidated will match. Market value is 
often quite different from the original cost when you have a need to turn the 
asset into cash in a timely manner. More than a few business owners and 
managers have experienced reverse sticker shock when the need arises to 
liquidate an asset in a less-than-favorable economic climate. Unless your 
business is TBTF (too big to fail), don’t expect freely operating capitalists 
to feel your pain.
Using key balance sheet performance-
measurement tools
The best way to begin to evaluate and understand your balance sheet is by 
applying the most commonly used financial performance measurement tools 
utilized by accounting and financial professionals throughout the country. 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
94
Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
Note that these measurement tools are focused on evaluating a company’s 
financial strength at a point and time (for example, as of 12/31/10) rather 
than over a period of time (for the three-month period of 10/1/10 through 
12/31/10). As such, these financial performance measurement tools are 
geared toward evaluating a company’s strength as measured by its solvency 
and liquidity.
In addition to the financial performance measurement tools we discuss in 
this section, countless others are available and utilized by professionals 
operating in different industries, but they’re beyond the scope of this chapter. 
However, the goal of applying all financial performance measurement tools 
remains the same: to complete an independent and objective evaluation on 
the company’s financial statements to assess its financial health, strength, 
and stability.
Using the same sample company as presented in Figure 5-1 (the balance 
sheet), Figure 5-2 shows the six measurement tools we discuss in this section.

GIGO, or garbage-in, garbage-out, is a simple concept that’s extremely important 
to understand. If the financial information you apply the financial performance 
measurement tools to is “garbage” (in other words, unreliable, inaccurate, 
incomplete, or otherwise bad), then the results produced from applying the 
measurement tools will also be “garbage” (and should not be relied on). 
Don’t bother applying financial performance measurement tools to unreliable 
financial information.

 Chapter 5: Mining the Balance Sheet for Cash
Net working capital
To determine net working capital, total current liabilities are subtracted 
from total current assets. Generally speaking, a positive figure should be 
present for most businesses. If this ratio is negative, it implies that the 
business doesn’t have enough short-term or liquid assets to cover its short-
term liabilities.
Current ratio
Taking the company’s total current assets and dividing them by its total 
current liabilities determines the current ratio. A current ratio of greater than 
one to one should be present, because a ratio below that level implies a 
possible liquidity problem.
Quick or acid-test ratio
This ratio represents an extension of the current ratio. It’s calculated by 
taking the total current assets, less inventory and other current assets (such 
as prepaid expenses), and then dividing this adjusted figure by total current 
liabilities to produce the quick, or acid-test, ratio. The higher the ratio, the 
better. However, having a ratio of less than one to one is common, especially 
for companies with significant levels of inventory. The idea with this ratio is 
to evaluate just the company’s most liquid assets (generally cash and trade 
accounts receivables) in relation to its current liabilities to drill down into 
another measurement of liquidity.
Days sales outstanding (DSO) in trade accounts receivable
Trade receivables divided by average monthly sales multiplied by 30 days 
produces the days sale outstanding in trade accounts receivable figure. 
Lower numbers with this calculation are usually positive, because they 
indicate a company is doing a good job of managing this asset and not 
consuming excess capital. Again, although the DSO will vary by industry, 
keeping receivable turnover rates lower than 30 days or one month is 
generally very positive.
	
If your company is growing rapidly or has significant seasonal sales, don’t use 
average monthly sales for this calculation, because your numbers won’t 
accurately reflect the state of affairs. Instead, use an average monthly sales 
figure that is more representative of more recent business activity. For 
example, if your business sells cold-weather gear such as snow shovels and 
snow blowers, you stock up on these items starting in the fall so your business 
probably has a peak selling period of August through December and then a 
falloff starting in the spring. So when applying this calculation, your days sales 
outstanding in trade accounts receivable balance is best measured against the 
seasonal sales peak versus average monthly sales for the year.

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
Days costs of goods sold outstanding in inventory
The days costs of goods sold outstanding in inventory figure is found by dividing 
inventory by average monthly cost of goods sold and multiplying by 30. You 
usually want a lower number with this calculation because it indicates that 
your company is doing a good job of managing this asset and not consuming 
excess capital.
Note: If your company is growing rapidly or has significant seasonal sales, 
average monthly costs of goods sold can be misleading. Instead, you want 
to use an average monthly costs of sales figure that is more representative 
of more recent business activity. For example, if your company has recently 
doubled the size of product offerings to the market by tapping new sales 
channels (such as selling products on QVC), the period of time the new 
products have been sold offers a better comparison to your inventory levels 
(as it is only logical that inventory levels are higher to support increased 
sales activity).
Debt-to-equity ratio
Total debt (current and long term) divided by the total equity of the company 
equals the debt-to-equity ratio. Higher ratios indicate that the company has 
more financial leverage (refer to “Unlocking Hidden Cash from the Balance 
Sheet,” later in this chapter, for a discussion on financial leverage), which 
translates into more risk being present.
Evaluating your assets
In my (Tage Tracy’s) 20 years of professional experience with financial 
statements, I’ve yet to see a balance sheet that isn’t lying in one form or 
another. Most companies aren’t intentionally committing fraud and/or the 
willful intent to deceive; the financial statements presented have simply not 
been properly evaluated and adjusted to make sure that all balance sheet 
accounts have been classified correctly and that the assets’ net realizable 
value are, in fact, accurate.
The problem with properly accounting for and valuing assets isn’t so much 
based in understanding what the stated value of the asset should be. If 
inventory was purchased for $100 per unit, then it should be valued at $100 
per unit. Likewise, if a customer sale amounted to $750, then that amount 
should be the receivable due from the customer. Accounting for the original 
cost or value of a transaction is fairly straightforward and easy to understand, 
so you may be wondering what the problem is. The answer is simple: age and 
intent.
On the age front, as most assets get older, they naturally depreciate and lose 
value as the asset is consumed over the ordinary course of business. A 
perfect example is the purchase of machinery used to manufacture a product. 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
97
 Chapter 5: Mining the Balance Sheet for Cash
Over time, the machine slowly depreciates as it’s worn out through repeated 
use or becomes outdated. This same concept also holds for just about every 
other type of asset, including trade accounts receivable, inventory, intangible 
assets, and others. As the assets get older, the risks of obsolescence and 
eventual recoverability increase, directly reducing the value of the asset. For 
most business assets, aging carries the greatest single risk to value impairment.
As for the intent issue, well, we’ll just say that this is where business owners 
and managers can really start to get creative. It’s not that they deliberately lie 
about the value of their intellectual property being intact or about their 
intentions to pay back the advance they provided themselves over the next 
12 months. As George Costanza says in an episode of Seinfeld when Jerry 
asks him how to beat a lie detector test, it’s not a lie if you believe it’s the 
truth. Business owners truly believe that various assets do, in fact, hold the 
original value paid. However, believing it doesn’t make it true on the balance 
sheet, as we explore in the following sections.
	
More times than not, those little white lies that business owners and managers 
start with innocently enough (to support asset value) can quickly turn into 
all-consuming black holes as the owners and managers really start to believe 
the horse you-know-what they’re shoveling. Business owners and managers 
are not intentionally trying to inflate asset values and commit fraud, but over 
time they lose objectivity in making sure that all assets are properly valued.
Determining real cash availability
The balance sheet is not always clear about what assets are readily available 
to turn into cash. For the most part, cash is cash and can be utilized freely 
in the business. However, various types of cash need to be clearly segregated 
and classified when the cash is not freely available for use in normal company 
operations. Examples of cash that need to be properly classified as other 
current or long-term assets include certificates of deposits pledge as collateral 
(like for a facility lease), cash allocated to employees in deferred compensation 
programs (and generally invested in marketable securities), cash earmarked 
for the payments of specific obligations (such as deductibles on insurance 
programs), and so on. A simple rule of thumb is that if cash is restricted to 
its use, then it needs to be classified appropriately so that it isn’t improperly 
factored into or assumed to be available for general business needs.
Considering whether trade accounts receivables are collectible
Are all receivables really collectible? This question can be answered very 
concisely: No! And not just for the obvious reason of receivables not being 
collectible because the customer can’t pay. Clearly, bad debt represents 
one of the largest valuation impairments related to receivables, and most 
businesses have to deal with some level of it. Bad debt must be proactively 
managed to limit related losses and must be accounted for in the business’s 
economic profitability model. But in addition to bad debt, the net realizable 
value of receivables can be impacted by numerous other factors, including 
the following two examples:

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
	
✓	Allowance for returns and discounts: In today’s economy, sales 
channels have never been more aggressive in pushing back unsold 
merchandise to the supplier. So though sales may have taken place, 
the real question is what potential is present for the return of unsold 
merchandise after a set period. Making sure that a proper allowance 
has been established to account for expected sales returns represents a 
high-profile management task.
	
	Likewise, properly accounting for future discounts needs to be 
addressed. In certain industries, a sale may occur, but if a competitor 
offers the same product at a reduced price, your customer may look for 
a discount (in order to preserve the original sale). If providing discounts 
after the fact is relatively common practice, then in order to capture 
the real net value of trade receivables, the business needs to establish 
a reserve to account for potential or estimated customer discounts that 
will eventually be provided (after the sale).
	
✓	Trade payable offsets: Numerous businesses both sell products to 
and purchase material from the same party, creating both a customer 
and vendor relationship. Quite often, settlements on the accounts are 
addressed by offsetting the balances owed rather than by remitting 
payment. The net effect of the offset on the income statement is zero, 
but a balance sheet impact is present as a result of reducing both trade 
accounts receivables and trade accounts payable.
Accounting for the true value of inventory
Businesses are required to value inventory at cost based on generally 
accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, the inventory’s value must 
also be based on the concept of lower of cost or market (LCM). This concept 
states that any inventory for which the net market value is lower than cost 
must be recorded on the balance sheet as reflecting the lower net market 
value (where net market equals the anticipated selling pricing less any direct 
expenses incurred to support the sale).
The problem with valuing inventory isn’t so much based in these two simple 
concepts but rather in management’s ability and willingness to apply these 
two concepts in a timely and impartial manner. Businesses must be willing 
to develop and implement disciplined accounting policies and procedures to 
properly evaluate and account for obsolete, slow moving, lost, and/or 
market-price-impaired inventory. Inventory maintenance and management 
are expensive (keep reading to find out why), and, similar to bad debts 
realized on sales, periodic losses on inventory represent a normal and 
recurring expense that must be accounted for on a periodic basis to ensure 
that a business’s profit and loss are properly reported.

 Chapter 5: Mining the Balance Sheet for Cash
	
Continuing to carry and stock obsolete and slow-moving inventory can be 
very expensive for a business because a number of added expenses are 
incurred to support the inventory (including leased space, utilities, insurance, 
taxes, personnel to manage the inventory, and so on). Although these 
expenses vary by business, a general rule of thumb is that for every dollar of 
inventory supported, the carrying costs may be as high as 10 percent. So if a 
business has $1 million in inventory, the annual maintenance and carrying 
costs are $100,000. By managing inventory appropriately, not only are carrying 
costs reduced, thus improving a businesses’ profitability, but also, more 
important, cash is not tied up in excess inventory levels. Business owners and 
managers must not be fooled by a common pitfall based on the thinking, “This 
is what the inventory costs, so this is what it has to sell for in order to make a 
profit.” For slow-moving, obsolete, and value-impaired inventory, liquidating 
the inventory in bulk is often more profitable than continuing to carry the 
inventory in the hopes that it will sell some day.
Providing for property pitfalls
The term property refers here to all equipment, machines, buildings, land, 
leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, and other fixed assets owned. 
Significant variations in property market values compared to the net book 
value are generally present for most companies and can work in both 
directions. For instance, most tangible personal property, such as machines, 
equipment, computers, furniture, and autos, tend to have a lower fair-market 
value (the value that could be obtained in the open market if liquidated) 
than the net book value stated on the balance sheet. This difference is due 
to the fact that when new equipment becomes used equipment on day one 
of ownership, a significant decrease in value is realized. And because most 
companies use the straight-line method of accounting to record depreciation 
expense, the fair-market value of the property is usually below the net book 
value of the property for the first 60 to 70 percent of the ownership life. 
Conversely, other types of real property, such as land and buildings, may 
actually increase in value, especially if held for an extended period of time.
	
Numerous opportunities are present to save money and properly manage risk 
with business property. For example, making sure that all tangible personal 
property such as computers, equipment, and machinery that are no longer in 
use are properly relieved from the accounting records can help reduce 
property taxes and insurance costs. Businesses often forget to remove the 
cost of property when filing property tax returns and completing insurance 
coverage applications, which drives taxes and premiums higher.
Dealing with other problem assets
The list of problems that can be encountered with other assets is about as 
long and varied as the Yellow Pages. So rather than attempt to list every

100
Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
possible scenario, here are two real-life scenarios that illustrate how some 
business owners and managers can stretch the truth on their balance sheets:
	
✓	Capitalized start-up costs: A company incurs $250,000 in start-up 
expenses to start a new business unit. The company elects to capitalize 
the cost as an intangible asset rather than record it as a direct expense, 
because by recording the cost as an expense, the company would incur 
a net loss and thus violate the covenants established with its bank.
	
✓	Owner advances: One of the oldest and most common tricks used by 
businesses is to reduce owner compensation levels and instead allow 
the owners to take loans from the business which will eventually (yeah, 
right) be paid back during years of strong profitability. The loans are 
then treated as an asset on the balance sheet, giving the appearance of 
a stronger company. Be warned that everyone (from outside financing 
sources to auditors) looks right through this scheme and treats owner 
advances as an expense on the income statement and a reduction to net 
equity.
Taking a closer look at your liabilities
If your assets are lying to you, then it should come as no surprise that your 
liabilities may not be telling you the entire truth either. When businesses 
implement proper accounting procedures, liabilities tend to suffer from 
management neglect, poor understanding (of the core issue), and/or plausible 
deniability.
The following sections take a closer look at a business’s liabilities to make 
sure they’re coming clean with management. The overriding issues in 
whether liabilities are telling the truth are really completeness and accuracy. 
Have all liabilities of a business been accounted for and been accurately 
presented in the balance sheet? From an auditor’s perspective, auditing 
what’s there (assets) is much easier than auditing what’s not there but 
should be (liabilities).
Examining payable and receivable relationships
Similar to cash, trade payables are just what they sound like (see the earlier 
section “Trade accounts payable” for an overview) and should be classified 
as a current liability. However, various trade accounts payable scenarios 
warrant further discussion:
	
✓	As noted with the discussion on trade accounts receivables, certain 
trade accounts payable owed may be offset against trade account 
receivables due if a business has a customer that is also a supplier.

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
101
 Chapter 5: Mining the Balance Sheet for Cash
	
✓	Vendor balances that are past due may indicate that a dispute is present 
between the company and its supplier (for example, concerning defective 
products that were returned). If material, the balance owed may need to 
be extracted from the trade accounts payable classification.
	
✓	If a large balance due has accumulated with a key supplier that is a 
related or affiliated party, a better understanding of the expected 
payment terms for the balance due should be obtained (and if needed, 
properly recorded).
Properly accounting and accruing for all liabilities
Businesses often struggle to make sure that all liabilities are properly 
accounted for and accrued at the end of each period. Most notably, businesses 
tend to have problems with accrued liabilities that arise from having to use 
estimates for calculating future obligations due (which are not necessarily 
invoiced to the business for payment). A perfect example of this uncertainty 
is businesses that provide warranties for products and/or services. Though 
a business doesn’t know what sale will eventually result in a warranty claim, 
it should have enough information to estimate what future claims will arise 
based on sales levels. Other accrued liabilities are somewhat easier to calculate, 
such as interest expense on outstanding debt, property taxes on real and 
personal property, income tax obligations due (based on net profit levels), 
and employee commissions and bonuses, but the same accounting principle 
holds for all these problem areas: matching.
	
The accounting matching principle states that all revenue and expenses 
should be properly matched in the same period to ensure that a company’s 
true financial performance is reported. A perfect example is employee 
commissions paid in arrears when cash is received. The commissions earned 
should be accrued and expensed in the period during which they were 
generated as opposed to when they’re paid. Although paying commissions in 
arrears based on when the cash from the sale is received represents a solid 
cash-management strategy, if sales of $800,000 were realized in the third 
quarter and generated a commission of 10 percent, or $80,000, then the 
income statement for the third quarter should reflect an $80,000 commission 
expense.
Classifying debt as current or long term
Properly classifying liabilities between current and long term is extremely 
important. On the surface, this classification may appear straightforward to 
you (for example, the next 12 months of principal payments on a note payable 
get classified as current). But careful classification is often overlooked by 
businesses with areas that are not quite as clear cut, such as accrued liabilities 
that cover multiple years. You also need to keep in mind that a liability that 
was considered long-term a year ago may change based on economic

conditions or your company’s financial performance and now need to be 
classified as a current liability for the current year. For example, if your 
business has a note payable extended from a bank with specific financial 
covenants attached that were met in a prior year, then the note is most likely 
accounted for with both a current portion and long-term portion. However, 
if the business violates the terms of the note-payable agreement by not meeting 
a covenant, then the note may be in default and become due and payable 
immediately (requiring 100 percent of the balance due to be classified as 
current).
Handling risks with other liabilities
The importance of properly accounting for and classifying other liabilities 
has been highlighted recently by the accounting community in relation to 
recognizing earned revenue. This issue has been centered in the technology 
industry as a result of how technology licensing agreements are structured 
and when revenue is actually earned. I won’t go into the specifics because 
they can get very complicated, but the key issue is based in an agreement 
that is billed in advance and that covers a period of time (such as an annual 
license that provides the customer with free future updates and technical 
support). If for any reason a business is obligated to support a customer over 
a period of time and potentially incur future expenses to support the customer, 
then a portion of the revenue billed to the customer will need to be deferred 
and recognized appropriately — the matching principle.
Remembering off-balance-sheet obligations and transactions
Off-balance-sheet obligations result from transactions or events that are not 
required to be recorded in the financial statements per GAAP but carry risks 
to a business in one fashion or another. One simple example is the practice of 
providing a business guarantee, which has become more commonplace over 
the past three years. If a business, for any reason, guarantees the obligations 
of another entity, then an off-balance-sheet obligation is created. Though the 
other entity may be fully capable of supporting the repayment of the obligation 
that was guaranteed, if for any reason it can’t, the impact on the business 
providing the guarantee may be significant.
Off-balance-sheet obligations and transactions have been one of the hottest 
topics with corporate America for the past ten years. From Enron’s accounting 
fraud and eventual implosion in the early 2000s to the current uncertainties 
facing the banking and financial industry in accounting for exposures to 
derivatives, understanding a business’s risks with these types of transactions 
is absolutely essential. For most small businesses, this issue may not seem 
to be all that important, but it can bite very hard and very fast for the 
unsuspecting.

 Chapter 5: Mining the Balance Sheet for Cash
Scrubbing the Balance Sheet 
Clean for Its Users
“Scrubbing” the balance sheet means exactly what it sounds like. Every 
balance sheet account, asset, liability, and equity, is “scrubbed” clean of all 
the financial and accounting dirt, garbage, grime, and grit (such as old 
inventory purchased 2 years ago at $10 per unit but which hasn’t sold in 
12 months) that tends to build up over time. The process of scrubbing the 
balance sheet is often completed at the end of a quarter or fiscal year end 
and involves applying strict internal policies and procedures to ensure that 
the financial information is as accurate and reliable as possible.
After walking you through a case study, we explain some of the reasons why 
scrubbing is important to both internal management and outside investors.
A case study: Scrubbing the balance 
sheet of ACME Distribution, Inc.
In this section, we walk you through a review of the assets and liabilities of a 
fictitious company called ACME Distribution, Inc.
Reviewing the assets
First, we scrub the company’s assets as presented in its balance sheet to see 
if any are lying. Figure 5-3 shows the adjustments being made. This document 
is nothing more than the asset side of the balance sheet extracted into a 
separate management analysis tool (or Excel worksheet, in this case) for 
additional evaluation purposes.
Note: The amount column represents the original asset value presented in 
the company’s balance sheet. The adjustment column indicates the reduction 
in the asset’s value to properly account for the real value of the asset. The 
adjusted amount column is the new, correct asset value.
Here are some issues with this balance sheet that were adjusted:
	
✓	In cash and equivalents, a certificate of deposit for $35,000 is being 
used as security for a long-term company office/warehouse lease. Even 
though the certificate of deposit represents cash (and is an asset of the 
company, because if the terms of the lease are met, the cash would be 
returned to the company), it needs to be reclassified as a long-term asset 
given that its use is restricted. This is a simple asset-misclassification issue 
that needs to be corrected.

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
	
✓	In trade receivables, no allowance for potential bad debts has been 
accounted for. An estimate of 2 percent of outstanding trade receivables 
was determined based on historical data (so the adjustment here is 
2 percent × $750,000, resulting in a $15,000 bad-debt reserve being 
required). In addition, a 3 percent reserve for sales returns was established 
based on the previously three months sales of $1,000,000 to account for 
historical return rates. (The adjustment here is 3 percent × $1,000,000 of 
sales over the past three months, resulting in a $30,000 reserve for sales 
returns.) The combination of these two reserves amounts to $45,000. 
The percentage reserve amounts for both bad debts and sales returns 
would primarily be based on evaluating the company’s historical 
operating and sales trends by evaluating the number of adjustments to 
previously recorded sales that occur over a period of time after the sale.
	
✓	Under current assets: inventory, obsolete inventory of $50,000 is 
calculated and written off as being worthless.
	
✓	Shareowner advances provided in a past year were not supported by 
proper documentation and were determined at the time of the creation 
of the balance sheet to represent a dividend.
	
✓	Under long-term assets: property, plant, and equipment and less: accumulated 
depreciation, fully depreciated and disposed of equipment is removed 
from the accounting records.
	
✓	The note receivable from an affiliated operation wasn’t properly 
reconciled for over two years, and the discrepancy wasn’t supported. 
In the adjustment, management confirmed with the affiliated operation 
that a $100,000 reduction in the value should be realized based on 
support provided by affiliated operations, agreed to by all parties.
	
✓	Amortization of intellectual property wasn’t recorded in the current 
year. The intellectual property’s total value was $250,000, which 
management determined should be written off or amortized over a 
60-month period (5 years). A full year’s amortization expense amounts 
to one-fifth of the total, or $50,000.
	
✓	The deferred income taxes needed to be fully reserved for at the end 
of the year due to future uncertainty over profitability. Although the 
company properly calculated the value of a deferred income tax asset 
(which can be used to offset potential future profits and reduce taxable 
income), at the point and time the balance sheet was prepared, the 
future profitability of the company was in question, so if no future 
profits are generated, the deferred income tax asset has no value.
Reviewing the liabilities
Next, take a look at Figure 5-4, which lists the company’s liabilities, to make 
sure they’re all telling the truth.

The liabilities and equity in the balance sheet had these problems:
	
✓	The note payable requires $200,000 of principal be repaid each year. In 
addition, the amortization schedule for the capital lease obligation 
indicates that $50,000 of principal will be repaid over the next 12 months. 
So in total, $250,000 of short-term debt-repayment obligations are 
present and have been reclassified under the heading current portion, 
long-term debt. This term is generally used to capture all debt or loan 
principal payments due within the next 12 months (for loans that have 
been structured to be repaid over a longer period of time, such as 5 or 
10 years). Although in total the liability amounts reflected in the balance 
sheet are correct, the classification between short-term and long-term 
liabilities is incorrect because readers need to understand what portion 
of debt is due within the coming 12 months.
	
✓	Accrued interest due in 90 days on the subordinated debt was not 
recorded during the year. The error was noted from evaluating two 
sources of information. First, the subordinated debt agreement stated 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
106
Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
that interest of 10 percent per year was due, but it was noted in the 
income statement that this interest expense was never recorded. 
Second, when loans, notes payable, and/or other similar types of liabilities 
are recorded in the balance sheet as an obligation, associated interest 
expense should be present in the income statement. When the income 
statement was evaluated, the interest expense was deemed to be 
unusually low (resulting in further investigation and identification of the 
error) and needed to be increased to properly reflect the company’s real 
interest expense (which decreased the company’s profits).
	
✓	The company didn’t record the limited warranty is offers for product 
replacements. An estimate of $40,000 for warranty repairs and service 
is determined based on an analysis of historical product returns and 
repairs (for defects and malfunctions), so when combined with the 
accrued interest adjustment of $25,000, the total increase in accrued 
liabilities is $65,000.
	
	Furthermore, both of these adjustments to accrued liabilities reduce 
the company’s profits because interest expense was understated (as 
previously discussed), in addition to understated product warranty 
expense. According to the matching principle, if a warranty is provided, 
then the estimated costs associated with fulfilling the warranty must be 
matched in the same period as the product sales (even if the eventual 
cost incurred for the warranty repair occurs five months later).
Completing the scrubbing
Many small businesses (like the fictional ACME Distribution, Inc.) do not 
receive audited financial statements and subsequently have somewhat weak 
accounting policies and procedures. More times than not, our experiences in 
these cases have generally resulted in having an independent party, such as 
a CPA or financial consultant, perform rather intensive “scrubbings” of the 
balance sheets originally prepared by the company’s internal management 
team or accounting firm retained to assist with basic accounting and taxation 
related matters.
The balance sheet in Figure 5-5 displays the final adjusted balance sheet (in 
the traditional format, with assets on the left side and liabilities and equity on 
the right side) for our fictitious company after the asset scrubbing in Figure 5-3 
and liability scrubbing in Figure 5-4 are taken into consideration.
Now that the balance sheet shown in Figure 5-5 is scrubbed, you can revisit 
the balance sheet performance measurement tools (described in the earlier 
section “Using key balance sheet performance-measurement tools”) to really 
evaluate the company’s financial strength. Check out Figure 5-6 to take a 
look, paying particular attention to the company’s financial measurements 
tools that changed significantly, including net working capital, the current 
ratio, and the debt-to-equity ratio.

With this new and improved information (at least from a reliability stand­
point), the scrubbed information really sheds new light on the company 
and its financial strength. On the unaudited performance analysis in Figure 
5-2, the net working capital was $780,000, and in Figure 5-6 it’s reduced to 
$185,000 with the current ratio also decreasing from a relatively healthy 1.81 
to a very slim 1.15 (and the quick ratio decreasing to .73 from 1.06). All these 
measurements indicate that the company is not nearly as liquid and finan­
cially strong as first presented. Furthermore, the company’s debt-to-equity 
ratio decreases from 1.58 to 1.00 all the way to 2.87 to 1.00, indicating a much 
higher degree of financial leverage (and associated operating risk).

 Chapter 5: Mining the Balance Sheet for Cash
Aiding internal business management
	
The concept of CART is discussed in detail in Chapter 8, but it’s also worth 
mentioning in this discussion of scrubbing. CART stands for complete, 
accurate, reliable, and timely financial information that’s available to internal 
management and used to make business decisions. To operate a business 
effectively (not to mention profitably), all financial statements, including the 
balance sheet, must adhere to CART. The following real-world example 
highlights just how important having a CART-based balance sheet is:
	
Looking to avoid violating a debt covenant that required the company to 
remain profitable, a service company decided it would “capitalize” certain 
start-up costs associated with a new business unit and then amortize the costs 
over 60 months. (Management convinced themselves that this was appropriate 
accounting.) This maneuver had the effect of inflating the balance sheet with 
assets of limited value, which, in turn, helped the company achieve profitability 
(because expenditures that should have been recorded as expenses were in 
fact treated as assets). Of course, the bank questioned this transaction, and 
the company had to restate its financial statements. The outcome was not 
pleasant because not only did the company now show a loss and violate the 
lending covenant, but also the bank lost faith in management, reduced the 
lending facility (further restricting already tight cash availability), and basically 
demanded that the company find a new lending source.
Because they didn’t have an accurate and reliable balance sheet, the company’s 
internal managers had formalized growth plans assuming that financial 
resources would be available from the bank. When these resources were 
reduced and eventually eliminated, the company faced a number of very 
uncomfortable and unpopular decisions as damage control became the 
primary focal point (as opposed to being able to grow the business).
Providing confidence to outsiders
The concept of CART — making complete, accurate, reliable, and timely 
financial information available — applies not only to internal business 
management needs but also, more importantly, to outside parties. Outside 
parties come in all shapes, sizes, and forms and range from financing sources 
such as a bank, to the owners of a business undertaking estate planning and 
in need of a company valuation, to public and governmental agencies looking 
to obtain a vast range of info. The goal when providing info to outsiders, 
however, remains the same: Eliminate unnecessary questions and concerns 
by instilling confidence that financial information provided is accurate and 
reliable.

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
	
Most external users of business financial data are not consuming the 
information in an effort to help you run your business. Rather, they are reviewing 
it to help make a decision in their best interest (not yours). Did the company 
collect and remit the appropriate amount of sales and use tax? Does the 
company’s performance warrant a loan to be extended that they’ll make 
money on? The more confidence the outsiders have in the business financial 
information, the fewer questions and issues that will be raised, which translates 
into reduced management time and effort being expended on managing 
compliance-related matters.
In any economic environment, the importance of providing CART business 
information to external parties is essential. But since 2007, this issue has 
reached an entirely new level of importance based on one of the hottest 
terms used during this period — transparency. Business credibility is so 
critical in today’s uncertain economic environment that any indication that 
a business is not being honest, forthright, open, and professional leads to 
almost-certain rejection from outsiders. When providing financial statements, 
reports, and forecasts to external parties, you have no room for error.
Unlocking Hidden Cash 
from the Balance Sheet
Data mining has become one of the most important tools and management 
functions businesses must perform today in order to remain competitive 
in the global economic marketplace. From knowing everything about your 
existing and target customer base to scheduling production from engineering 
design through final delivery to the warehouse, having access to your 
company’s information and thoroughly understanding it is critical. This same 
concept applies to a company’s balance sheet as well, because if business 
owners and managers understand the vast amount of data available, in plain 
sight, they can use it to unlock cash.
Though countless examples on how to use individual assets and liabilities to 
unlock cash from the balance sheet can be offered, we like the following four 
key strategies for improving cash flow: turning over current assets, investing 
in long-term assets, leveraging suppliers and vendors, and using notes 
payable, loans, and leases. In this section we explore all four methods.
Turning over current assets
The most important (and perhaps most obvious) method for improving cash 
flow is converting current assets into cash. This concept is related to what 
we discuss in “Using key balance sheet performance-measurement tools” 
about using business measurement tools to evaluate how quickly a company 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
111
 Chapter 5: Mining the Balance Sheet for Cash
can turn over current assets, including trade receivables and inventory. The 
quicker these assets can be turned over, the lower balances these assets 
retain on the balance sheet, which in turn drives cash balances higher. For 
example, if a company generates $10 million a year in revenue and has an 
average days sales outstanding of 45 days, a balance of $1,250,000 of trade 
receivables is outstanding. However, if the company can reduce the days 
sales in trade accounts receivable to 35 days, the trade receivables balance 
will amount to roughly $975,000 (which translates into increased cash of 
$275,000).
Investing in long-term assets
When cash is plentiful, you probably have no trouble making a decision to 
simply purchase long-term assets such as equipment, machinery, computers, 
furniture, and even buildings. (After all, why would a business borrow and 
pay interest when it has ample cash available to support the purchase?) 
Of course, when cash isn’t plentiful, the question is, “Why did we purchase 
everything for cash when we need it to operate the business? Or simply put, 
why didn’t we set aside some cash for a rainy day and just get a loan?” And 
to add insult to injury, if your business then needs to secure cash from these 
assets (by using them as collateral for a loan or selling the assets), you have 
to be prepared for sticker shock if the value has decreased.
Avoid the common pitfall of consuming cash needed for short-term operating 
needs in long-term, illiquid assets. When investing in long-term assets, consider 
the purchase in the context of your business plan and make a careful and 
thorough evaluation of financing options available (at the point of purchase). 
For example, a lease for equipment may be priced by using an 8 percent 
per annum interest rate when the equipment is new with 90 percent of the 
original cost available to be financed. Compare this to attempting to secure 
lease financing against the same equipment (but now used, even if it’s just 
six months old), which may cost twice as much in terms of the interest rate 
charged with only 50 percent of the original purchase price available to be 
financed. What looked expensive at the point of purchase could quickly 
become the bargain of the century down the road.
Leveraging your current liability friends
The suppliers and vendors a business uses on a regular basis can quickly 
turn into cash-generating friends if managed properly. If you need a little 
extra credit or require extended time to make payments, looking to suppliers 
and vendors to offer better terms during a period of short-term cash-flow 
pressure is more than reasonable. Over time, if vendor and supplier payment 
terms (whether stated or accepted/assumed) can be pushed out an extra 
week to ten days, your cash resources can be increased.

Vendors and suppliers clearly understand the importance of customer 
relationships. The vendors and suppliers have worked hard to secure their 
customers and don’t want to lose them to the competition. If they have to 
bend a little to provide more credit, most will be receptive to strong and 
long-lasting relationships. Chapter 15 discusses this strategy in more detail.
The concept of leveraging liabilities goes well past the more traditional trade 
payables. You can improve cash balances by lengthening the time period in 
which cash is remitted by using accrued liabilities, appropriately structured 
employee compensation programs, and other current liabilities (like requiring 
customer deposits or prepayments). And the final perk is that a number of 
these strategies can be implemented without incurring any type of interest, 
carrying costs, and/or related expenses (as long as the requests are kept 
reasonable).
Using notes payable, loans, 
and leases appropriately
When notes, loans, and leases are used and structured appropriately, they 
can offer a great and efficient source of cash. However, that tip comes with a 
caveat: When these methods aren’t used appropriately, cash resources can 
quickly be consumed, weakening the business’s financial strength.
	
Businesses must understand that using debt in the form of formally structured 
notes payable, loans, and leases should be done only when appropriate. 
Chapter 10 evaluates when this type of debt is most appropriately used, but 
the general rule of thumb is easy to follow: Structured debt is best used when 
a company has positive earnings and cash flow and the debt can be secured 
against an actual asset. Structured debt is not well suited to and generally 
should not be used to support continued operating losses or to support 
investments in relatively high-risk business assets (such as unproven 
technology, patents, developing new markets, and so on). An asset should be 
able to generate or “throw off” enough cash to support the associated debt 
principal and interest payments.
In addition, notes payable, loans, and leases should always be structured to 
make sure a proper balance is maintained between the current portion and 
the long-term portion. A common problem businesses can encounter is 
inappropriately structuring the liability section of the balance sheet by using 
too much short-term debt to finance long-term assets (or vice versa). For 
example, a line of credit loan or lending facility established to be used to 
finance increases in trade receivables should not be used to purchase fixed 
assets.

T

his chapter explains useful techniques and tricks for analyzing cash flow. 
If you recall that the statement of cash flows is one of the primary three 
financial statements, you may anticipate, therefore, that this chapter focuses 
on that statement. However, analyzing cash flows requires looking beyond 
the statement of cash flows to the other two financial statements: the income 
statement and the balance sheet.
The cash flows reported in the statement of cash flows depend on the 
profit-making activities reported in the income statement and the changes 
in the assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity reported in the balance sheet. 
Trying to analyze cash flows without the income statement and balance sheet 
would be like watching a ballet without music: You could see the moves of 
the dancers (the amounts in the statement of cash flows), but you couldn’t 
hear the music that energizes their movements (the related amounts in the 
other two financial statements).
This chapter starts with what you could call the basic training or boot camp 
for reviewing the cash flows of a business. Then we move on to more incisive 
cash-flow analytical techniques that managers, lenders, and investors can 
use for making their business decisions and evaluations.
Tying Up Cash Flow in a Neat Bundle
Money constantly flows into and out of a business. Cash flows, as we stress in 
virtually every chapter of this book, pose an unending challenge to business 
managers because they have to be carefully managed. Business managers 
need to clearly understand the dynamics of cash inflows and cash outflows. 
Savvy business lenders and investors, who are very concerned about how 
well managers are controlling the cash flows of the business, also need a

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
solid understanding of cash-flow dynamics. The trick is to connect the dots 
between the drivers of cash flow in the balance sheet and income statement 
with the cash-flow outcomes in the statement of cash flows.
Presenting financial statements 
for analyzing cash flows
	
In this book, we focus on businesses that make profit by selling products. 
Many businesses sell services rather than products; examples include utility 
companies, cellphone network providers, professional sports organizations, 
and financial institutions that make a profit by investing and lending. We don’t 
have the space in this book to explore all the differences in financial statements 
between product-based, service-based, and other types of businesses. The 
variety is simply too large. But the financial statements of product-based 
businesses are a good example for all types of businesses.
Figures 6-1 and 6-2 introduce an example business’s financial statements 
(borrowed from How To Read A Financial Report by John A. Tracy [John 
Wiley & Sons, Inc.]). Figure 6-1 presents the income statement for the 
company’s most recent year, and Figure 6-2 presents its balance sheet at the 
end of the year. From Figure 6-1, you can tell that the business sells products. 
Note the relatively large cost of goods sold expense, which is the cost of 
products sold that’s deducted from sales revenue to determine gross margin. 
Also, note the relatively large inventory asset account in the balance sheet. 
Most businesses provide services for the products they sell. The costs of 
these services are not in cost of goods sold expense; the costs are lodged in 
the broad category of selling, general, and administrative expenses.
Both financial statements are free of nuisance elements that would divert 
attention from analyzing cash flow. The income statement doesn’t include 
extraordinary gains or losses, which are a dreadful distraction from the 
mainstream information. And, mercifully, the balance sheet doesn’t include 
“other assets” (which can be almost anything) or long-term liability deferrals 
resulting from the recording of certain types of expenses. In short, the 
examples are financial statements that are free of distracting elements.
We don’t include the statement of cash flows for the business. The company 
would, of course, include this statement in its financial report, but we don’t 
need this statement for explaining and analyzing cash flows. As we mention 
at the start of the chapter, the cash flows of a business are driven by the 
sales and expense activities of a business and the changes in its assets, 
liabilities, and owners’ equity.

Try to always keep the possibility of accounting and financial-reporting fraud 
in the back of your mind. In this case, you can assume that the business has 
not engaged in accounting or financial-reporting fraud in the preparation of 
its financial statements. The statements are presented according to generally 
accepted financial reporting standards. The company is private, so it doesn’t 
have to report earnings per share, but the business decided to provide this 
vital statistic to save its shareowners the trouble of calculating it.
Cutting the balance sheet down to size
For analyzing cash flow, working with a formal, full-blown balance sheet is 
very clumsy. It has too many numbers to deal with, which compete for 
attention against the key metrics of the business. A useful technique is to 
condense and rearrange the balance sheet information.
The balance sheet in Figure 6-2 is in “formal dress” and conforms to generally 
accepted financial reporting standards. In contrast, Figure 6-3 presents the 
company’s balance sheet in “work clothes,” which is much easier to work 
with. Figure 6-3 also includes the two columns on the right side for reviewing 
the cash rules of a business. Increases in assets and decreases in liabilities 
and owners’ equity result in a cash decrease. Conversely, decreases in assets 
and increases in liabilities and owners’ equity result in a cash increase.

Figure 6-3 introduces a new item: The company’s short-term operating 
liabilities are deducted from its short-term (current) noncash operating 
assets, which renders an amount called net short-term operating position. The 
acronym for this key financial metric is NSTOP, which doesn’t exactly roll 
off the tongue, does it? But compared with other financial acronyms such as 
EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization), EPS 
(earnings per share), and GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles), 
NSTOP isn’t that bad.

The three short-term operating liabilities (accounts payable, accrued 
expenses payable, and income tax payable) are deducted from the three 
noncash short-term operating assets (accounts receivable, inventory, and 
prepaid expenses). These six accounts are transformed into one net amount, 
which is on the asset side. Short-term operating liabilities of a business are 
almost never more than short-term operating assets. Netting, or offsetting 
short-term operating liabilities against their cousins on the asset side, helps 
you to better understand the common characteristics of these assets and 
liabilities and provides a clearer picture of the capitalization of the business. 
By netting, you can analyze the following aspects:
 	
✓	Behavior of accounts: The short-term operating liabilities (accounts 
payable, accrued expenses payable, and income tax payable) tend to 
march in tandem with the short-term operating assets of a business. 
These liabilities are close working partners with the assets, though on 
different sides of the street. For example, a good fraction of the accounts 
payable liability balance is for recent purchases of products held in the 
inventory asset account. The cadence of the liabilities and assets are not 
in perfect unison, but by and large, the two sides dance together.
 	
✓	Non-interest nature of accounts: The short-term operating liabilities 
are non-interest bearing liabilities that are distinct and substantially

118
Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
different from the short-term debt of a business. They arise from the 
expense activities of the business, not from borrowing money on the 
basis of formal loan procedures and signing a negotiable instrument 
(such as a promissory note payable). Short-term noncash operating 
assets, accounts receivable and inventories being the prime examples, 
do not earn interest income. The business doesn’t earn investment 
income from inventories, for example. Both the short-term operating 
assets and the short-term liabilities have high turnover of activity.
	
✓	Capitalization structure: The capitalization of a business usually refers 
to the mix of its debt (interest-bearing liabilities) and owners’ equity. 
You can more easily focus on the capitalization structure of a business 
by deducting short-term operating liabilities from short-term operating 
assets. In the example in Figure 6-3, for instance, the company’s largest 
source of capital is its retained earnings, and its capital stock is larger 
than its total indebtedness. At a glance, you can see that the business 
has a conservative (low debt/high equity) capitalization structure.
	
One key advantage of reducing the formal balance sheet into its condensed 
version is that you can more easily see and focus on where the business has 
invested its capital. The business has $30.5 million total capital to work with, 
which it deploys among the assets it needs to operate. The company is holding 
more than $3 million cash (deposited in banks or invested in very short-term 
marketable investments that can be immediately converted into cash). It has 
$9.4 million in net short-term operating position.
The business has invested $12.25 million over the years in fixed assets. 
Money invested in these long-term operating assets has to be recovered 
through future sales revenue or by disposing of the assets. As we explain 
in Chapter 4, a business should set its sales prices high enough to generate 
enough revenue to recoup the cost of its depreciable assets. In doing so, the 
business recovers part of the total cost of these assets year by year.
The business has invested almost $6 million in intangible assets. The cost of 
intangible assets may or may not be written down annually and charged to 
amortization expense. In the example, the business did not record any 
amortization expense in the year, which is permissible if the assets didn’t 
suffer impairment in value during the year. (The writing-down of intangible 
assets and recording of amortization expense is a long story that we don’t 
have space to go into here.)
	
The balance of the net short-term operating position, or NSTOP, is the net 
cash invested by the business in its high turnover short-term assets minus its 
high turnover short-term liabilities. Collapsing the assets and liabilities into 
one net amount and leaving the details to the day-to-day management of the 
business simplifies the balance sheet. This technique is particularly handy in 
analyzing the cash flow from profit (operating activities), which we discuss in 
the next section.

 Chapter 6: Digging Deeper into Cash Flow
By the way, don’t confuse NSTOP with a similar term in financial analysis 
that you may come across, net working capital. Net working capital equals 
all current assets, including cash, minus all current liabilities, including 
short-term notes payable. NSTOP does not include cash in the assets and 
does not include short-term debt in the liabilities.
Reviewing sources and uses of cash
Figure 6-3 has two columns titled cash rules. Most of the rules need just a 
quick comment: If debt had been higher, cash would be higher. That is, if 
the company had borrowed more from its lenders, then its cash would have 
been higher, ceteris paribus (all other factors being equal). If the capital stock 
source of owners’ equity had been lower, cash would have been lower. In 
other words, if the shareholders had put less capital in the business, the 
company would have a lower amount of cash to work with, holding all other 
assets, liabilities, and retained earnings the same.
	
If the business had invested less over the years in its property, plant, and 
equipment or in its intangible assets, then its cash balance would be higher. 
However, investing a smaller amount may not have provided enough production 
or sales capacity to carry on its current level of activities. In the example, the 
business paid $750,000 cash dividends to its stockholders, which decreased 
its retained earnings. If it had not made any cash distributions from profit to 
shareowners, its cash balance would have been $750,000 higher (and retained 
earnings would be this much higher). The shareowners may have been very 
dissatisfied and restive if no dividends had been paid. They might have even 
gone after the scalps of the president or CEO.
Zeroing in on changes in financial 
condition from making profit
Now for a tough question. The business reports $2,642,000 bottom-line profit, 
or net income for the year just ended (refer to Figure 6-1). How did the 
company’s financial condition change as the result of earning this profit? You 
can answer part of this question from the income statement, which reports 
bottom-line profit and depreciation expense for the year.
The company’s profit of $2,642,000 increased the net worth of the business — 
its assets minus its liabilities — without any additional capital investment 
by shareowners. To be more specific, profit increases the owners’ equity 
account retained earnings, which is one of the two types of owners’ equity 
of a business. The shareowners are $2,642,000 better off from earning profit. 
What about the assets of the business? Its assets also increased $2,642,000. 
But which assets? Did cash increase this amount?

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
During the year, the company’s fixed assets (property, plant, and equipment) 
decreased $785,000. This amount of depreciation expense is reported in the 
company’s income statement (refer to Figure 6-1). The business didn’t record 
any amortization expense during the year, so its intangible assets were 
not affected by profit for the year. Therefore, the decrease stems from the 
remaining two assets shown in Figure 6-3 — cash and net short-term 
operating position. The change in cash depends on the change in the net 
short-term operating position (NSTOP).
Figure 6-4 presents three scenarios for the change in NSTOP during the 
year. If by chance NSTOP did not change during the year (not too likely, of 
course), cash would increase by the amount of net income plus the amount 
of depreciation, as you see for Scenario A in Figure 6-4. In this scenario, 
cash increases $3,427,000. But in almost all situations, NSTOP increases or 
decreases during the year. In Scenario B, NSTOP increases $500,000 during 
the year, and in the Scenario C, it decreases $200,000 during the year.

Figure 6-4 is a useful template for summarizing and analyzing cash flow from 
operating activities. However, it requires that several assets and liabilities 
be collapsed into one neat number: net short-term operating position (as we 
explain in “Cutting the balance sheet down to size”). Unfortunately, NSTOP is 
not reported in financial statements. The “outsiders” who read financial 
statements (lenders and shareowners) don’t have the time or savvy to 
condense the balance sheet as shown in Figure 6-3. Perhaps stock analysts go 
to the trouble of condensing a company’s balance sheet in this way. But 
calculating NSTOP doesn’t appear to be a commonly used technique.

 Chapter 6: Digging Deeper into Cash Flow
	
On the other hand, business managers can “order up” from their accountant 
the condensed version shown in Figures 6-3 and 6-4 for analyzing cash flow 
from operating activities (instead of plowing through the more detailed formal 
statement of cash flows). As long as the change in NSTOP is reasonably 
consistent with the change in sales revenue over last year, it probably isn’t 
worth the time and attention of top-level managers to go into details. On the 
other hand, if the change in NSTOP were wildly out of step with the change in 
sales revenue, this discrepancy would serve as a red flag to top management 
to look into the reasons more closely. This approach illustrates the “manage­
ment by exception” principle. Managers should assiduously allocate their time 
to the most important problems and issues, not waste their valuable time on 
the trivial and unimportant.
Developing Benchmarks for Cash Flow
A large number of ratios and other benchmarks are used in analyzing profit 
performance and financial condition, which are reported in the income 
statement and balance sheet. We explain many of these yardsticks in other 
chapters (see Chapters 5 and 7 in particular). You may be surprised to 
discover that ratios and benchmarks are used sparingly for analyzing the 
cash flows of a business. The statement of cash flows is in a kind of no man’s 
land for financial analysts.
Nevertheless, you do see with some regularity certain ratios and other types 
of interpretation in the financial analysis literature. How widely they’re 
actually used by financial analysts is hard to tell. The handful of cash-flow 
ratios is nothing like the manifold ratios and benchmarks used for analyzing 
profit performance and financial condition. But these cash-flow ratios and 
comparisons are useful for understanding cash flow, and business managers 
would be well advised to consider using these analytics.
Comparing cash flow with 
sales revenue momentum
To explore how sales revenue affects cash flow, in this section we rely on the 
business example introduced earlier in the chapter and illustrated with the 
income statement (Figure 6-1), condensed balance sheet (Figure 6-3), and the 
changes in financial condition from earning profit (Figure 6-4). These statements 
constitute the point of departure for looking ahead to the coming year.

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
Suppose sales revenue surges 25 percent in the coming year, which is a 
sizable rate of growth, to be sure. (We make the increase in sales revenue 
fairly dramatic in order to arrest your attention and to make the impact on 
cash flow from operating activities sizable.) Of course, the first thing most 
business managers, lenders, and investors would do is look at the growth in 
profit at the 25 percent–higher sales level.
	
Profit does not move in lock step with increases and decreases in sales 
revenue. Or putting it another way, expenses seldom change by the same 
exact percent as sales revenue. Therefore, profit probably would increase 
more or less than 25 percent. (You can read more about profit behavior in 
our books How To Manage Profit and Cash Flow and Small Business Financial 
Management Kit For Dummies [both published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.].)
However, to keep the business example simple, assume that its net income 
also increases 25 percent, from $2,642,000 to $3,302,500 in the coming year. 
And assume depreciation expense in the coming year is $825,000, which is 
higher than for the most recent year. (The company increased its investment 
in property, plant, and equipment, causing depreciation expense to increase.) 
So far, you have two of the three critical factors you need to compute cash 
flow from profit (operating activities) in the coming year; that is, profit and 
depreciation. The missing factor is the change in NSTOP (net short-term 
operating position).
	
In general terms, NSTOP should move in close relationship with the change 
in sales revenue. Think about it: Accounts receivable should keep at about 
the same percent of annual sales revenue, so if sales increase 25 percent, 
accounts receivable should increase about 25 percent — unless the company 
makes substantial changes in its customer credit terms or customers begin 
paying sooner or later than normal. And inventory should change at about 
the same percent as sales, unless the business changes its inventory policies. 
Likewise for accounts payable and accrued expenses payable. These two 
short-term operating liabilities should march in close formation with the 
change in sales. Therefore, assume in the example that NSTOP increased 
25 percent in the coming year:
$9,410,000 NSTOP from Figure 6-3 × 25% = $2,352,500 increase in net 
short-term operating position
You now have all the information you need to determine cash flow from 
operating activities for the coming year. The projection for the next year’s 
cash flow is shown in Figure 6-5. Cash flow from profit (operating activities) 
would be $1,775,000, just a little more than half the $3,302,500 net income for 
the year. The gain in profit from sales growth causes a serious reduction in 
cash flow for the year.

 Chapter 6: Digging Deeper into Cash Flow
	
In a high-growth scenario such as this one, the net short-term operating 
position of a business tends to grow as fast as the growth in sales. This 
increase puts a big dent in cash flow, at least in the short-run, as you can see 
in Figure 6-5. The company needs a larger investment in its net short-term 
operating position to support the higher sales level, and this increase has a 
big impact on cash flow in the year of the increase. Business managers, 
lenders, and investors should clearly understand the cash-flow “price” of 
rapid growth.
	
Financial report readers should compare the change in NSTOP against the 
change in sales revenue. The two changes should be reasonably consistent 
with one another. This doesn’t mean that a 10 percent drop in sales, for 
example, should lead to an exact 10 percent decrease in NSTOP. But NSTOP 
should follow sales downward by roughly the same percent. A lag in the 
decrease in NSTOP can indicate that management doesn’t yet have the sales 
decline under full control. For example, the business may not have reduced its 
inventory down to the lower sales level, which means that too much money is 
tied up in excessive inventory.

Deducing the business’s true state of affairs from the statement of cash 
flows is difficult. Lenders and shareowners would appreciate if a business 
explained the change in its net short-term operating position so that they 
could make informed decisions about the creditworthiness and investment 
value of the business. However, in their financial reports, companies generally 
don’t include commentary on their cash flow. Instead, only the statement of 
cash flows is presented.

Using other tools for cash-flow analysis
Cash flow from operating activities is money that the business generates 
itself without having to go to outside sources (lenders and shareowners). A 
business depends on its cash flow from profit (operating activities) for 
several absolutely critical purposes. Without adequate cash flow from profit, 
a business is severely restricted and may end up in a downward spiral that is 
hard to reverse.
Cash flow from profit provides the seed capital for growth. It provides cash 
for replacing long-term operating assets as they wear out over time. It 
provides cash for paying dividends to shareowners. It supplements the 
capital the business raises from debt and equity sources. As important as it 
is, however, analyzing cash-flow profit is not the whole of cash-flow analysis. 
Business managers, lenders, and investors can use other tools to help them 
in interpreting the cash flow of a business.
Putting cash flow on a per share basis — or not
For public companies, earnings per share (EPS) is an extraordinarily important 
number. For example, the current market value of the company’s capital 
stock shares is divided by its EPS to determine the price/earnings ratio. 
Fundamentally, EPS equals total bottom-line net income, or earnings divided 
by the total number of capital stock shares outstanding (in the hands of 
shareowners). For many corporations, the calculation of EPS is anything but 
simple; they may have to report not one, but two EPS amounts — the second 
one being diluted earnings per share that takes into account additional shares 
that the company is committed to issue in the future. Anyway, the basic idea 
of EPS is to put profit on a per-share basis.
You may suppose that cash flow from profit (operating activities) is also 
put on a per-share basis. Suppose that NSTOP increased $322,000 during 
the year. For this scenario, suppose that $2,642,000 net income + $785,000 
depreciation – $322,000 increase in NSTOP = $3,105,000 cash flow from 
operating activities. The computation of cash flow per share would be as 
­follows:
$3,105,000 cash flow ÷ 800,000 capital stock shares (from Figure 6-2) = 
$3.88 cash flow per share
However useful this calculation may seem, you won’t find cash flow per share 
in financial reports. For one thing, the rule-making body of the accounting 
profession has decreed that this particular financial statistic should not be 
reported, at least not in the formal financial statements. The worry was that 
financial statement readers might think that cash flow per share is a better 
measure of profit than the measure of profit according to accrual-basis

 Chapter 6: Digging Deeper into Cash Flow
accounting (which is in conformity with generally accepted practices and 
standards). The rule-making body doesn’t want more than one profit measure 
to appear in the financial statements. Of course financial statement readers 
can compute cash flow per share, but they should understand that it’s not a 
measure of profit.
Expressing cash flow as a ratio to net income, or operating income
	
Financial analysts track cash flow over time by measuring cash flow from 
operating activities as a ratio to bottom-line net income or, alternatively, to 
operating income before interest, income tax, and extraordinary gains and 
losses. The thought behind this ratio is that cash flow should be reasonably 
stable as a ratio to profit. An unusual dip or jump in the ratio may have a 
perfectly logical explanation. But abrupt changes in the ratio of cash flow to 
net income should be investigated.
	
A sudden drop in the ratio of cash flow to net income may be a red flag that 
raises questions about the company’s accounting practices. For example, 
a business may be recording revenue or other income that’s not being 
converted into cash inflow. The revenue or income may consist of a buildup in 
a noncash asset in the balance sheet. The actual cash conversion value of the 
asset compared with the value reported for the asset in the balance sheet may 
be contingent on future events that may or may not take place on time.
Comparing dividends to cash flow
Financial analysts measure dividends as a percent of net income to see what 
proportion of bottom-line profit is distributed to shareowners instead of 
being retained in the business. Alternatively, dividends can be expressed as 
a percent of cash flow from operating activities, which is logical because the 
payment of dividends in cash requires cash, of course. The decision about 
paying dividends is always “competing” with alternative demands on the 
cash flow of a business.
	
Cash flow from operating activities may be needed for building up the cash 
balance of a business, for increasing its net short-term operating position 
(NSTOP), for investing in its long-term operating assets, for reducing its debt, 
and for returning capital to its shareowners. The complement of the percent 
of cash dividends to cash flow tells you what percent was used for other 
purposes. If cash dividends were, say, 30 percent of its cash flow, then the 
business used the remaining 70 percent for the other uses. You can trace 
these uses of the cash flow from operating activities that was not paid out as 
cash dividends in the statement of cash flows. For example, the amount spent 
on capital expenditures for new fixed assets is in the investing activities 
section, and the amount used for redeeming capital stock shares is in the 
financing activities section.

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
Looking at free cash flow and other concepts and measures
Many financial analysis books, articles, and editorials discuss free cash flow. 
Free cash flow refers to cash flow from operating activities minus one or 
more “claims” against the cash flow. For example, free cash flow may be used 
to refer to cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures 
during the year. (Recall that capital expenditures are new investments to 
replace, expand, or modernize the long-term operating assets of a business.) 
The amount of cash flow remaining after deducting capital expenditures is 
thought to be “free” for any other use. Financial analysts sometimes also use 
other definitions of free cash flow, so you have to be careful to determine 
which particular meaning of free cash flow is being used.
	
All of a company’s cash flow from operating activities is free in the sense that 
the business has broad discretion regarding what to do with it and is under no 
constraints or legal requirements (by and large) regarding how to use its cash 
flow. After all, the whole point of generating cash is having the freedom to do 
what you want to with it. So to us, frankly, free cash flow doesn’t seem to be a 
terribly useful measure. In one scenario, however, a measure of free cash flow 
can be very helpful. A business may fall into dire financial straits and come 
under loan restrictions that kick into effect because it’s in default on paying 
interest or principal on its loans. A major portion of its cash flow from operating 
activities may be controlled by the demands of its creditors. Only the remaining 
balance, if any, would be free for the business to use.
When a business is struggling through one or more periods of losses, 
especially large losses, very likely its cash flow is negative. This negative 
number simply means that the business’s total cash outlays for expenses 
is more than its cash inflow from revenue. In these circumstances, carrying 
on operating activities burns up its cash. Financial analysts employ a rather 
drastic measure called the cash burn rate in these situations. The negative 
cash flow per month is calculated and divided into the company’s cash 
balance. The result is a rough estimate of how long the business can survive 
before it uses up all its cash.
The struggling business may be able to raise additional capital and extend 
its survival time. Or the business may be able to break into the profit column 
without going bankrupt. Most start-up ventures go through an initial period 
of losses before they can move up to sustainable profit performance. During 
this period, the managers can use the burn rate to estimate how long they 
have to get the business in the black.

 Chapter 6: Digging Deeper into Cash Flow
	
Another cash-flow based number gets a lot of press, though it doesn’t have 
great importance. This number is not reported in financial reports. In fact, 
financial analysts have to go to some trouble to calculate it. It’s called EBITDA, 
which is the acronym for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and 
amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses are not deducted from 
revenue and income. Part of the reason is that these expenses are arbitrarily 
determined based on crude estimates that are under the control of the 
company’s managers. Furthermore, neither expense involves a cash outlay 
during the period. Not deducting these two expenses may make some sense 
if the assets being depreciated and amortized did not in fact lose any value 
during the period. But in the large majority of cases, assets are depreciated 
and amortized because they do lose value over time.
	
By not recognizing several expenses, EBITDA is a dangerous and misleading 
“alter ego” of profit. In addition to ignoring real depreciation and amortization 
expenses when calculating profit, another problem with EBITDA is that 
interest and income tax are disregarded, despite certainly being expenses.
Frankly, the usefulness of EBITDA as a tool in financial analysis is of doubtful 
validity. However, it may have some value in special situations. But keep in 
mind that it’s far off the beaten path of generally accepted accounting 
standards and practices for reporting profit performance. If you have a lot of 
money at stake in a particular business, this alternative profit measure may 
be worth calculating and comparing with the bottom-line net income in the 
income statement. You would then have two tracks of profit to follow over 
time. Divergences between the two may provide a tip-off to radical changes 
you should know about.
Massaging Cash-Flow Numbers
Managers of a business have certain control over the financial statements 
that the business’s lenders and shareowners, who are on the outside looking 
in, do not. The president or CEO (and perhaps other managers as well) may 
override the regular accounting methods and practices of the business. The 
manager may order the company’s accountant to make changes in how certain 
assets or liabilities are recorded instead of sticking to the company’s established 
accounting procedures. Such intervention by managers is referred to as 
massaging the numbers. It’s also described as doctoring the numbers, 
management of earnings, accounting shenanigans, fiddling with the figures, and, 
as authors’ grandfather and father-in-law (a very successful business owner/
manager in his day) used to call it, “fluffing the pillows.”

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
	
However negative the connotation of the term, massaging the numbers should 
not be confused with cooking the books, which refers to the deliberate 
falsification of the company’s accounting records. Cooking the books amounts 
to accounting fraud. Massaging the numbers can be compared to telling a 
white lie, whereas cooking the books is like committing perjury. Using terms 
from Catholicism, massaging the numbers is like committing a venial sin, 
whereas cooking the books is like a mortal sin. You can go to jail if convicted 
of cooking the books.
The main reasons for massaging the numbers are to make bottom-line 
profit look better and to smooth the trend of reported profits year to year. 
Also, a business may want to make its short-term liquidity look stronger by 
manipulating its reported profit. The income statement and balance sheet 
are not the only two financial statements subject to accounting manipulation. 
A business may massage some of the numbers reported in its statement of 
cash flows.
The statement of cash flows reports cash flow from operating activities, as 
we explain in Chapter 4 and in this chapter. Business lenders and investors 
watch this key number, so managers know the importance of this cash-flow 
metric. Unsurprisingly, then, many managers are tempted to manipulate cash 
flow to make it look better than it really was for the year.
Massaging the cash flow numbers can be done through a wee bit of window 
dressing. For example, the recording of cash receipts from customers in 
payment of their amounts owed to the business may be kept open for a few 
days after the actual close of the year. Suppose a company’s year-end is 
December 31. But the business continues to record cash receipts for the first 
few days of January, as if the money had been received by December 31. This 
maneuver artificially inflates cash flow from operating activities for the year 
and decreases the accounts receivable balance reported at year-end.
You may assume that CPA auditors prevent the manipulation of its accounting 
numbers by a business. But keep in mind that although public corporations 
are legally required to have their annual financial reports regularly audited 
by an independent CPA firm, private businesses in general are not legally 
required to have audits (but many do). And although CPA auditors don’t 
encourage or condone the practice, truth be told, auditors tolerate massaging 
of the numbers by a business — but only up to a certain extent. Unless the 
effect is judged to be material, such that it would cause substantially 
misleading interpretations by readers of the financial statements, the CPA 
auditor doesn’t demand that the business correct the effects of massaging its 
numbers. The CPA auditor gives the business a clean opinion on its financial 
statements even though some numbers in the statements have been 
“manhandled” to some extent.

 Chapter 6: Digging Deeper into Cash Flow
	
Our bottom-line advice to financial report readers is that they shouldn’t 
simply assume that the numbers in financial statements, including the 
statement of cash flows, are the gospel truth. Management may have, as they 
say, “put a little lipstick on the pig.”
Frankly, finding red flags in financial statements that may signal major 
massaging of the numbers is very difficult for the typical financial report 
reader. The only realistic option is to rely on the CPA auditor not to allow 
massaging of the numbers to get out of hand. In contrast, members of the 
company’s board of directors, its lenders, and its major shareowners have 
closer contact with the business and they may have reasons to be suspicious 
about the business and its managers. They can hire a forensic accounting 
specialist to go in and do an investigation, but this is done only in extreme 
situations.

Understanding Liquidity versus 
Available Cash
In This Chapter
▶	Differentiating between solvency and liquidity
▶	Figuring out how to measure liquidity and solvency
▶	Understanding how liquidity can get the best of your business
▶	Exploring ways to increase liquidity
▶	Reviewing the upside and downside of financial leverage
T

he life of a business owner is often fraught with so many pitfalls, road­
blocks, speed bumps, detours, and just about any other obstacle one 
can (or can’t) think of that it’s no wonder that on average, approximately 
80 percent of all small businesses fail within the first five years of operations. 
On top of the endless series of day-to-day business-management issues that 
must be addressed, ranging from internal staff to customers to the endless sea 
of government regulations (just to name a few), a business must constantly 
maintain and manage an appropriate level of available capital resources to 
ensure that ongoing operations don’t miss a beat. That is, a business must 
always ensure that it has enough liquidity — access to cash or the ability to 
quickly turn assets into cash — to pay the bills, cover payroll, remit taxes, 
repay debt, and/or be ready to cough up cash to address whatever surprise 
may come down the road. Due to the Great Recession, being liquid has taken 
on an entirely new meaning and has become an extremely powerful and effec­
tive competitive tool and advantage.
	
Being liquid doesn’t necessarily mean the same thing as being solvent, or able 
to pay all debts. Though the two concepts are closely related and tend to be 
highly correlated (as higher levels of solvency typically go hand in hand with 
increased levels of liquidity), one does not guarantee the other. Understanding 
both concepts is critical when managing a business’s financial affairs.

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
	
When times are good, businesses tend to have enough capital available from 
both internal sources and external partners (such as a bank providing a loan) 
because everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon and share in the success. 
But when the times turn, profits suddenly become losses, and internal finan­
cial pressures mount, you find that your financial partners may begin to 
demand that you perform before they commit. It’s the ultimate Catch-22, 
because before your business can perform, you need them to commit. So 
remember, implementing proper business-planning efforts is the foundation to 
ensuring that your business will always remain solvent and have ample liquid­
ity to manage through both good times and bad.
In this chapter we explore the significance of two simple concepts that help 
you maintain necessary levels of cash:
	
✓	Solvency and liquidity are different and have different implications.
	
✓	Liquidity doesn’t equal available cash (but rather, cash is a component 
of liquidity).
We’ve yet to see a small to medium-size business not have a major liquidity 
squeeze at some point. So in this chapter we also provide tools, insights, and 
strategies on how to manage and improve both liquidity and solvency.
Before you dive into the material in this chapter, we want to quote the 
late Ted Knight in his role as the ever-popular Judge Smealls in the movie 
Caddyshack: “It’s easy to grin when your ship comes in and you have the 
stock market beat. But the man who’s worthwhile is the man who can smile 
when his shorts are too tight in the seat.” Trust us, remembering this simple 
quote when dealing with liquidity and solvency squeezes can be helpful.
Defining Business Solvency and 
Liquidity (Hint: Not the Same Thing)
On the surface, the concept of keeping a business solvent appears to be 
relatively simple if you only consider that the business needs enough capital 
available to meet current obligations and commitments. Though this notion 
isn’t entirely untrue, the problem is that business solvency isn’t so much 
based in managing short-term financial issues and obligations as in how a 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
133
 Chapter 7: Understanding Liquidity versus Available Cash
business manages its long-term business plan in relation to ensuring that the 
appropriate amount and type of capital is readily available to protect its busi­
ness interests.
To truly understand whether a business is solvent, the idea of liquidity must 
be addressed simultaneously. These two financial concepts are highly inter­
dependent, though one doesn’t guarantee the other. A business may appear 
to be solvent yet not have the necessary liquidity to operate another month. 
Or a business may appear to be insolvent yet have more than adequate 
resources available to support ongoing operations.
Examining a thorough explanation of each term can help your understanding:
	
✓	Solvency is best determined by evaluating the apparent (and we use 
this term with caution) financial strength of a business at a point in time 
to measure whether it has the ability to pay or cover all just debts. Are 
current assets greater than current liabilities? Are debt levels reason­
able compared to equity levels? Are the most liquid assets, including 
cash and trade receivables, greater than trade payables? Answering yes 
to these questions suggests solvency, but it doesn’t tell the complete 
solvency story (which can’t fully be understood until available liquidity 
is addressed).
	
✓	Liquidity is best measured by evaluating all business financial infor­
mation, data, facts, resources, and so on available to calculate how 
much total capital resources a company has, in order to determine if a 
business can continue to operate over a period of time (as opposed to 
just at a point in time). Has the company properly structured a lending 
facility to support ongoing operations? Have internal business policies, 
procedures, and/or strategies been changed to improve internal cash 
flow? Again, the desired answer to these questions is yes, but the liquid­
ity question is dependent on far more information than just the current 
financial statements. Liquidity includes having access to all company 
plans, projections, financial disclosures, critical third party documenta­
tion and agreements, and so on.
	
A company’s available cash does not — repeat, does not — equal a company’s 
available liquidity. Cash represents just one component of a company’s total 
available liquidity, which generally includes multiple other sources of, or access 
to, cash. For example, an unused line of credit lending may be available, which 
provides access to cash when needed (but with no current borrowings).

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
By applying business-solvency measurement tools (discussed in detail in the 
next section), you can easily come to the conclusion that ACME Distribution, 
Inc., is basically insolvent as of 12/31/09. The company’s current ratio is less 
than one-to-one and stands at .98 with an even worse quick ratio of .49, only 
$54,131 in cash is available, the company realized a loss of roughly $408,000 
during the year, and only $655,000 of equity remains — compared to total 
liabilities of $2,800,000. All relatively poor signs (no doubt) to an external 
party attempting to understand the financial performance of the company 
and evaluate if ACME has a chance to survive.
	
But this point in the evaluation is where business-solvency measurements 
stop and business-liquidity measurements start. Business liquidity not only 
looks at the current financial position of a company (which looks bleak for 
ACME) but also captures financial information and data that aren’t clearly 
presented in the basic financial statements. For ACME, the following addi­
tional company information would be present in footnotes documenting all 
material and/or critical business relationships and agreements impacting the 
company’s operations. This info needs to be evaluated to determine if enough 
liquidity is available to survive:
	
✓	ACME has structured a line of credit facility that allows the company 
to borrow up to 80 percent of eligible trade receivables and 50 per­
cent of inventory. As of 12/31/09, the company can borrow a total of 
roughly $709,000 (80 percent of $636,000 of receivables plus 50 percent 
of $400,000 of inventory) compared to an outstanding balance of just 
$300,000 (the current balance outstanding on the line of credit borrow­
ings). These calculations reveal an additional $409,000 of borrowing 
capacity left to support the company’s operations.
	
✓	ACME has successfully secured extended payment terms with its ven­
dors and suppliers. The primary shareowner of the company has pro­
vided a personal guarantee (see Chapter 11 for further information on 
PGs) to key vendors and suppliers, which has allowed the company to 
move its payment terms from net 30 days to net 90 days. Vendors and 
suppliers accepted the personal guarantee due to the shareowner’s high 
personal net worth. These terms can be extended to 180 days and pro­
vided an additional $85,000 of extra liquidity as of 12/31/09.
	
✓	The financial performance of ACME in 2009 was negatively impacted 
by the company’s decision to expand its product offerings into a 
high-volume, low-price/profitability product line at the exact same 
time a severe economic recession began. Both sales and gross profits 
decreased as a result of a drop in demand; gross margins suffered 
significantly as too much of the product was purchased and had to 
be sold at discounted prices (to move the inventory). In addition, the

 Chapter 7: Understanding Liquidity versus Available Cash
company was not able to reduce its selling, general, and administrative 
expenses in relation to declining sales levels. By 12/31/09, the com­
pany’s “sins” finally were addressed by management as the product 
line was discontinued. This step drove sales lower but allowed gross 
margin to recover from 23 to 25 percent in 2010 (as well as allowing 
selling, general, and administrative expenses to be reduced). However, 
the company had to take a one-time write-down of $250,000 (reflected 
in other expenses) for obsolete inventory with the product line that 
could not be sold. By cleaning house and refocusing the company’s 
efforts in 2010, ACME had to sacrifice its current financial statements 
to position the company for future growth.
Although the company has struggled the last two years, negatively impact­
ing its current business solvency, ACME secured additional capital to ensure 
that it has enough liquidity to survive and prosper in the coming years. Also, 
you may note that no income tax expense or benefit is present in 2010. The 
reason for this is that the company had net operating loss carry-forwards 
from previous years to offset tax liabilities.
Applying Business-Solvency and 
Liquidity Measurement Tools
The previous section jumped ahead a little bit in terms of presenting 
Figure 7-1 and applying both liquidity and business-solvency measurement 
tools so that you could see the big picture first. In this section, we delve into 
a more complete examination of standard business solvency and liquidity 
measurement tools.
Measuring and monitoring solvency
Business-solvency measurements tend to evaluate data as of a point in time 
(for instance, the fiscal year-end for ACME). This data is then subjected 
to numerous analyses to evaluate how well a company is performing and 
how strong it is financially (including measuring the businesses solvency). 
Figure 7-2 presents basic business-solvency measurement tools that all busi­
ness executives should clearly understand.

 Chapter 7: Understanding Liquidity versus Available Cash
The list of business solvency measurements presented in the figure is by 
no means complete, as the boys on Wall Street would attest (as they have 
a much larger arsenal of measurements available). However, the following 
measurements represent the basics in understanding business solvency:
	
✓	Net working capital: Total current assets less total current liabilities 
equals the net working capital of a business. Generally speaking, busi­
nesses want a positive figure.
	
✓	Current ratio: Total current assets divided by total current liabilities 
equals a company’s current ratio. A ratio of greater than one-to-one is 
desirable.
	
✓	Quick or acid-test ratio: Total current assets is reduced by inventory 
and other current assets (such as prepaid expenses and deposits) and 
then divided by total current liabilities to produce the quick or acid-test 
ratio. The higher the ratio, the better, but having a ratio of less than one-
to-one is common, especially for companies with significant levels of 
inventory.
	
✓	Debt-to-equity ratio: Total debt (current and long term) divided by the 
total equity of the company equals the debt-to-equity ratio. Higher ratios 
indicate that the company has more financial leverage, which translates 
into more risk being present. (Check out the final section of this chapter 
for a discussion on financial leverage.)
	
✓	Days sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable: Trade receivables 
divided by average monthly sales multiplied by 30 days produces the 
days sale outstanding in trade accounts receivable figure. Lower numbers 
with this calculation are usually positive because they indicate that a 
company is doing a good job of managing this asset and not consuming 
excess capital. Note: Companies that are growing rapidly or that have 
significant seasonal sales need to use an average monthly sales figure 
that’s more representative of more recent business activity.
	
✓	Days costs of goods sold outstanding in inventory: Inventory divided 
by average monthly costs of goods sold multiplied by 30 days produces 
the days costs of goods sold outstanding in inventory figure. Lower num­
bers indicate a good job of managing this asset and not consuming 
excess capital. Note: Again, companies that are growing rapidly or that 
have significant seasonal sales need to use an average monthly costs of 
sales figure that’s more representative of more recent business activity.
	
✓	Debt service coverage ratio: Interest and depreciation expense are 
added back to the net income (or loss) of a company, which is then 
divided by the current debt service (defined as interest expense plus the 
current portion of long-term debt plus any outstanding balance with a 
current line of credit facility) to produce the debt service coverage ratio. 
A ratio of greater than one-to-one is desirable because it indicates that a 
company generates enough free cash flow to cover its debt service.

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
Keeping tabs on liquidity
Unlike solvency measurements, which look at a certain point in time, busi­
ness liquidity measurements are meant to evaluate a business’s total liquid­
ity by using both data as presented at a point in time as well as resources 
available to a business (but not necessarily presented in the basic financial 
statements) either today or in the future. The following three liquidity mea­
surement tools are illustrated in Figure 7-3:
	
✓	Available current working capital: Add the current net working capi­
tal (defined in the preceding section) to available capital that can be 
accessed during the next 12 months. Then adjust the figure to account 
for any other factors that impact the company’s liquidity (such as 
extended vendor terms), and the result is the available current working 
capital.
	
	In the example provided in Figure 7-3, two points are important. First, 
in 2008, the available borrowing capacity was reduced to account for 
$250,000 of obsolete inventory. In this example, the bank became con­
cerned about the value of this inventory and decided to eliminate it 
from the company’s ability to borrow. Second, in 2009, $85,000 was 
added back to account for the fact that the company was able to secure 
extended payment terms from vendors for the coming year. In effect, the 
company secured a “permanent” source of capital for the year from the 
vendors providing extended terms (and thus providing more capital to 
operate the business).
	
✓	Cash burn rate: This rate calculates the average negative cash flow 
(defined as net income or loss plus depreciation and other noncash 
expenses) the company is experiencing on a periodic basis (usually 
monthly). Burn rates represent key data points for investors attempting 
to understand how long it takes until a company becomes cash-flow 
positive. This indicator then drives how much capital is needed to 
­support the company during the negative cash burn periods.
	
	For ACME, the company’s cash burn rate was approximately $13,000 a 
month in 2009 (the worst performing year over the past three).
	
✓	Liquidity availability analysis: Calculating the potential available liquid­
ity that can be tapped from company assets and comparing it to the 
total current outstanding debt (secured with the assets) lets you evalu­
ate if any “untapped” sources of capital are available on the balance 
sheet.
	
	In the example provided for ACME in Figure 7-3, roughly $439,000 of 
potential and actual liquidity is available (even though the solvency 
measurements paint a much more difficult situation). (See the second 
highlighted line.)

These three liquidity measurement tools represent just a small sample of the 
entire list of potential liquidity measurements, tools, and analyses available. 
Unlike the business-solvency measurements noted in the preceding section, 
liquidity measurements tend to be customized for specific company and indus­
try issues (in order to properly manage and understand liquidity at any point 
in time). The key concept, however, is the same for both types of measures: 
You must always have a clear understanding of what capital and liquidity is 
available to your company (at any time) in order to properly manage your 
business interests.
Looking at the actual results of ACME, the company’s strongest year over the 
period (as measured by profitability) for the period of 2008 through 2010 was 
2008, during which it earned a net pre-tax profit of $341,000, yet as of 12/31/08, 
the company had the least amount of liquidity ($297,000 compared to $709,000 
at 12/31/10; see the first highlighted row). Now, this added liquidity didn’t

come without a price — the $85,000 of extended vendor terms required a per­
sonal guarantee, and $250,000 of subordinated debt (from the owners) was 
secured to strengthen the balance sheet. But the important fact is that the 
company was able to secure ample amounts of liquidity in 2010 to operate the 
business and hopefully grow in future years.
	
Understanding both business-solvency and liquidity measurements concepts 
is important when managing your business. Solvency measurements by them­
selves don’t often tell a company’s entire story or indicate whether it has the 
ability to survive as a going concern.
The fictitious financial performance provided for ACME in Figures 7-1 through 
7-3 presents a company that appears to be insolvent. But upon further review 
of the company’s operations (information derived from analyzing the foot­
notes attached to the financial statements and from undertaking management 
inquiries), we find that the company has additional liquidity to operate the 
business and has implemented operational changes to support its return to 
profitability. Conversely, we could have just as easily presented a company 
that’s highly profitable with strong solvency measurements but that, as a 
result of poor planning, has run out of cash (with no borrowing facilities 
structured to support continued growth) and has pushed its vendors and 
suppliers to the limit. Due to the lack of understanding of liquidity and poor 
planning, this company could even be at greater risk of failing (as the ven­
dors and suppliers may cut off the flow of products to sell, thus causing a 
chain reaction of events causing the company to implode). This scenario is 
discussed in more detail in “Avoiding Liquidity Traps” later in this chapter.
Finding out where cash fits into liquidity equation
This book is focused on managing cash, but we 
haven’t yet addressed where cash fits into the 
discussion on business solvency and liquidity. 
Well, the answer is easy — cash represents just 
one component of business-solvency measure­
ments and liquidity calculations. As discussed 
in the previous sections, cash is one of the four 
primary components comprising working capi­
tal (the others are trade receivables, inventory, 
and other current assets), and working capital 
represents a critical element in measuring busi­
ness solvency. Likewise, net working capital 
(including cash) represents a critical element 
of calculating available liquidity.
Unlike a company such as Apple, which sits 
on billions of dollars of cash with basically no 
liabilities and is constantly trying to figure out 
what to do with all its riches, the cash compo­
nent of working capital is usually relatively small 
(20 percent or less of current assets) for most 
businesses. It’s kept small by numerous factors, 
ranging from lack of access to anywhere near 
the capital markets large corporations have, to 
the need to constantly deploy cash in the busi­
ness to finance growth. As such, simply focus­
ing on only a company’s available cash balance 
to evaluate its financial strength and ability to 
support continued operations is generally very 
misleading and can quickly lead to incorrect 
conclusions. Cash is king, no doubt about it, but 
having ample liquidity to support your business 
is, as they say, priceless.

 Chapter 7: Understanding Liquidity versus Available Cash
Avoiding Liquidity Traps
After you know the basics of business liquidity and solvency, why it is impor­
tant, and how to measure it (all discussed in the previous sections), your 
attention can turn to how businesses tend to get into trouble and uninten­
tionally find themselves in liquidity traps. Liquidity traps come in a variety 
of shapes, sizes, and forms and to a certain extent result from business- or 
industry-specific factors. However, when the liquidity traps are viewed from 
a generalized perspective, the primary liquidity traps are typically in the 
following areas: tying up cash in company assets, using debt inappropriately, 
assuming that growth is always good, and assuming that shrinking is “
always bad.
As we discuss in the following sections, the volume and complexity of liquid­
ity traps are extensive and vary from business to business. You would be 
amazed at how many liquidity traps can occur and how quickly they can con­
sume your business. One day everything is fine, and then 180 days later the 
market’s turned, new product releases have been delayed, sales have soft­
ened, and the bank is all over you. (The words of Cousin Eddie in the movie 
Vacation come to mind: “The bank’s been after me like flies on a rib roast.”) 
To be quite honest, having to manage a liquidity trap is more a matter of 
when than if, so the better prepared you are to deal with liquidity traps (and 
understand the primary causes of the liquidity traps), the better you will be 
at managing a problem when it arises.
	
Having access to capital (whether debt or equity) represents one of the most 
important elements of executing a business plan, especially when a business 
is turning the corner and is ready to grow rapidly, because this is the point 
when the demand for capital is the greatest. As one of our business mentors 
says, “I don’t need access to capital going into a recession or downturn, but 
I sure as heck need access to capital as I come out of a recession and begin 
to grow quickly again.” Not managing the liquidity traps discussed in the fol­
lowing sections can prevent you from positioning a business to pursue new 
market opportunities. And this blunder often leads to one of the largest losses 
a company will ever realize (but never see): lost market opportunity.
Tying up cash in company assets
A company needs assets on which to execute its business plan and gener­
ate revenue. Some assets are highly liquid and represent attractive vehicles 
through which to secure financing (for example, trade accounts receivable 
that a bank may use as collateral to extend a loan or new equipment that a 
leasing company may use as collateral to provide a long-term lease).

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
Other assets, however, are not nearly as attractive to a lender, including 
certain inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, and the like. The 
main reason for this lack of interest is the difficulty the lender will face when 
liquidating the asset (and repay the loan) in the event the company doesn’t 
survive. The more liquidation value the asset has, the higher lenders’ interest 
is in providing financing. The following list of asset-investment liquidity traps 
are examples of when “good assets go bad”:
	
✓	Trade receivables: Trade receivables are usually very liquid assets that 
can be utilized to secure financing. Certain trade receivables, however, 
are not as attractive to financing sources. For example, trade receivables 
that are 90 days past due often are excluded by a lender from being able 
to borrow against because the age of the receivable indicates that the 
customers are having trouble paying their bills. Whether or not this is 
the case, the lender usually assumes the worst and excludes the trade 
receivable.
	
	In addition to old trade accounts receivable, other receivables that can 
create problems include receivables generated from foreign customers, 
governmental entities, and related parties/entities. Also (and as strange 
as this may sound), receivable concentration issues may produce prob­
lems if too many of your company’s trade receivables are centered in 
too few accounts. In this case the lender gets nervous because if one big 
customer tanks, it may take the entire company down.
	 	
	Make sure that you have a complete understanding of what comprises 
your trade accounts receivable balance to have a clear understanding 
of what is available to borrow against at any point in time. Though the 
balance sheet may state that your company has $1,000,000 (of which 
the company can borrow 80 percent, or $800,000), you may find that 
$400,000 of the receivables are ineligible (meaning the company can’t 
borrow against them). In this case, only $600,000 of good receivables are 
left to borrow against, meaning only $480,000 of financing is available.
	
✓	Inventory: You may think that inventory is a sound asset on which to 
secure financing because if a company’s product has a readily available 
market, there should be no problem liquidating the products in case the 
worst should happen. Right? Nope. Financing sources tend to be very 
nervous and skittish about lending against inventory, because if the 
worst happens, taking possession of the inventory and attempting to sell 
or liquidate it lead to all kinds of problems. Financing sources are just 
not prepared to handle this function.
	
	When all potential liquidation factors are considered with inventory, 
including identifying and disposing of obsolete items, having to pay a liq­
uidator to sell the inventory, watching the market hammer the value of 
the inventory as it becomes available (that is, the going-out-of-business 
sale), and so on, the lender will be lucky to receive 40 to 50 percent on

the dollar. Hence, lenders tend to shy away from extending loans against 
inventory, and when they do extend loans, lending rates are usually well 
below 50 percent.
	
	Besides potentially draining a business’s liquidity, tying up cash in 
excessive inventory can also create problems on numerous other fronts.
 
• For every dollar of inventory increase, a lending source may 
only provide 40 percent of the cash necessary to support the 
added investment (leaving 60 percent to be supported by internal 
resources). So cash that could be invested in other business opera­
tions, such as research and development, is left sitting in inventory.
 
• The risk of inventory obsolescence increases because the slower 
the inventory moves, the older it becomes, which generally forces 
the company into taking inventory write-off “hits” on the financial 
statements. As most business owners know, in today’s rapidly 
changing market, inventory can become obsolete in as little as 
three months.
 
• Excessive inventory is expensive to maintain because it must be 
stored, insured, tracked, protected from theft, and so on. Quite 
often, inventory maintenance expenses can run up to 10 percent of 
the inventory’s cost on an annual basis.
	
✓	Property, equipment, and other fixed assets: The concept of consum­
ing liquidity in fixed assets is similar to purchasing a new car (but even 
worse). The day you purchase a new car and drive it off the lot, it may 
lose up to 25 percent of its value. For fixed assets such as new equip­
ment, computers, furniture, and fixtures, within 90 days of purchase 
the value is based on a “used” status (and you will be lucky to get 
50 percent on the dollar). Compounding this problem is that if you do 
need to secure financing against the fixed assets (which are now used), 
the financing will be expensive (that is, have higher interest rates) com­
pared to acquiring the fixed assets when new.
	
	The time to obtain financing with fixed assets is at the point of purchase. 
At this point, the asset value is the highest and the most financing 
sources are available to obtain competitive pricing and terms. When the 
equipment becomes used, the market for financing sources shrinks and 
becomes much more expensive.
Using debt inappropriately
The second major liquidity trap is at its core centered in not keeping your 
balance sheet in balance. The imbalance we’re referring to comes from using 
short-term debt, such as a line of credit structured to support trade accounts

146
Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
receivable, to finance a purchase of a long-term asset. The following example 
explains how this issue can create significant problems for a company.
	
A company had structured a line of credit financing agreement or loan where 
it could borrow up to 80 percent of eligible or qualified receivables. The com­
pany was growing quickly and had increased its trade accounts receivable to 
roughly $2 million in total, of which 90 percent were eligible to borrow against. 
Altogether, the company borrowed $1.4 million, which was within the financ­
ing-agreements limit ($2 million of total accounts receivable, of which $200,000 
were ineligible to borrow against, leaving a net borrowing base balance of $1.8 
million, producing a total borrowing capacity of $1.44 million). Of the $1.4 mil­
lion, $400,000 was used to purchase fixed assets and $1 million was used to 
support the trade accounts receivable.
Within six months, the company’s trade accounts receivable decreased 
to $1.5 million, while at the same time the ineligible percent increased to 
20 percent (as a result of certain trade accounts receivable becoming 90 days 
past due). This change reduced the company’s ability to borrow to $960,000 
($1.5 million of trade accounts receivable times 80 percent eligible times 
80 percent advance rate). Unfortunately, the company used the cash gener­
ated from the $500,000 decrease in trade accounts receivable to reduce trade 
payables and cover operating losses (as well as pay down the loan). The com­
pany was only able to pay down the loan by $200,000, leaving an outstanding 
balance of $1.2 million against an available borrowing of $960,000. Needless to 
say, the financing source requested the company “cure” this over-advanced 
position, but the company could not (leading to a very interesting round of 
discussions and the financing source placing additional restrictions on the 
company). By not properly financing the fixed-asset purchase, the company 
fell into a very common and painful liquidity trap.
The exact opposite problem can happen as well, if, for instance, a loan pay­
able with a repayment term of three years is used to support a current asset 
(such as trade accounts receivable). Although the asset (trade accounts 
receivable) may be growing as a result of increased sales, the debt is being 
reduced over a three-year period. Just when the company needs capital to 
finance growth, capital is flowing out of the organization to repay debt.
A proper balance of capital to asset type must be maintained to better 
manage the balance sheet. The following three very simple rules guide 
matching capital or financing sources with asset investments:
	
✓	Finance current assets with current debt. Current assets, such as trade 
accounts receivable or inventory, should be financed with current debt, 
such as trade vendors or suppliers and a properly structured lending 
facility.

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
147
 Chapter 7: Understanding Liquidity versus Available Cash
	
✓	Match the cash-flow stream to the financing stream. The general con­
cept here is that a fixed asset produces earnings or cash flow over a 
period of greater than one year. Therefore, fixed assets, such as equip­
ment, furniture, computers, and technology, should be financed with 
longer-term debt, such as term notes payable (having, for example, a 
five-year repayment period) or operating or capital leases.
	
✓	Use debt financing sources to provide capital for tangible assets and 
use equity financing for losses or “soft” assets. Assets that are consid­
ered “soft” (including intangibles such as patents, trademarks, certain 
investments, and prepaid expenses) and company net losses need to be 
supported from equity capital sources, including the internal earnings of 
the company.
Assuming that business 
growth is always good
Now we come to one of the most common, but least understood, liquidity 
traps:
Congratulations on your business’s rapid revenue growth, but remem­
ber: Growth does not always translate into business success!
Remember that rapidly growing businesses require significant amounts of 
capital to support ongoing operations (because the balance sheet tends to 
expand relatively quickly). As revenue (and hopefully profitability) levels 
grow, so do assets and the need to finance the assets. Further compounding 
this event is the additional problem that rapidly growing companies run into 
with getting caught up in the seemingly endless new-market opportunities 
being presented and the need to “invest” earnings from profitable operations 
into the expansion of the new operations (which tend to lose money during 
the start-up phase). This strategy, if properly managed, can be very effec­
tive as long as management keeps a keen eye on the distribution of earnings 
between supporting new operations versus strengthening the balance sheet.
No set rule dictates how much of your earnings should be used to reinvest in 
new operations versus strengthening the balance sheet. The real key lies in 
the ability to keep your debt-to-equity ratio (refer to “Measuring and moni­
toring solvency,” earlier in this chapter) manageable so that if the company 
hits a speed-bump or pothole, resources are available to see you through the 
difficult times. One thing is for sure, however: Pushing your company to the 
limit by leveraging every asset (with debt financing) and reinvesting internal

148
Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
earnings in new operations (that lose money during start-up) is a recipe for 
failure. Businesses must constantly manage the growth versus available capi­
tal trade-off issue to ensure that its interests are not exposed to unnecessary 
risks that quite often carry extremely expensive outcomes.
	
In the business world, you may hear the saying that someone is “growing him­
self out of business.” This expression means that rapidly growing businesses 
may fail as a result of running out of liquid assets (cash or access to cash) if a 
proper plan has not been developed to support the growth. Business assets 
such as trade receivables, inventory, and equipment can increase so quickly 
in a rapidly expanding business that before you know it, all the company’s 
cash has been consumed and vendors and suppliers have begun to cut off 
credit (effectively killing the business).
Assuming that a shrinking business 
always represents trouble
Another very common but little-understood liquidity event represents the 
alter ego of a rapidly growing business.
Wow, your business revenue levels have decreased during the year, 
resulting in a small loss, so you must be in financial distress. Nope! 
Most businesses, at one point or another, experience losses that should 
not be interpreted as a failure.
A rapidly growing business usually is accompanied by an expanding balance 
sheet because both assets and liabilities tend to increase (with assets gener­
ally increasing faster than liabilities, thus consuming cash). The opposite 
occurs when a business shrinks via decreasing revenue, closing a division, 
selling a business unit, closing stores, and/or undertaking similar types of 
transactions. When a company shrinks, it usually is the result of either a poor 
economic environment (case in point, the period from 2008 through 2010) or 
a management decision to exit underperforming markets and/or focus on the 
most profitable operations. The second scenario carries the following dual 
benefits:
	
✓	First, even though revenue levels may be decreasing, the company’s 
operating performance generally improves as expenses are eliminated 
and management focuses on more lucrative opportunities with stronger 
profit potential. These changes have the effect of improving internal 
operating results, profits, and hopefully cash flows to improve liquidity 
and strengthen the balance sheet.

149
 Chapter 7: Understanding Liquidity versus Available Cash
	
✓	Second, and of greater assistance to improving business liquidity, 
downsizing a business has the effect of contracting the balance sheet at 
both the asset and liability levels. So as long as the asset contraction is 
greater than the liability contraction, cash is freed up, which should (if 
properly managed) improve business liquidity levels.
	
Obviously, in a number of situations, shrinking revenue levels do represent 
a significant problem, especially if expenses can’t be reduced fast enough in 
relation to lower revenue levels, resulting in accumulating losses that may 
eventually lead to severe financial distress. However, jumping to the conclu­
sion that a decrease in a company’s top line must mean financial troubles is 
inappropriate. Management may be very well ahead of the game and actually 
undertaking a plan to improve the financial strength of the business.
Discovering Untapped 
Sources of Liquidity
If you’ve read all the previous sections in this chapter, you now understand 
what liquidity is, why it’s so valuable, how to measure it, and where the 
traps are. But you may be thinking, “Great, but to be quite honest, Authors, 
your chapter is a little too late. I’ve run out of cash, have no more ability to 
borrow, and my suppliers are breathing down my neck.” Well, now the real 
fun begins. It’s now up to the executive management team to identify sources 
of capital to work through the troubled times. The purpose of this section is 
to identify potential capital sources (to provide liquidity) that can assist your 
business in times of need.
Liquidating assets
The first option is relatively straightforward but easier said than done. 
Liquidating assets is often proposed by management as a quick and easy 
method to raise capital. This practice makes sense because if a company has 
unneeded or underutilized assets, selling them can help ease a cash crunch. 
Following are some examples of prime assets that can be liquidated:
	
✓	Old trade accounts receivable: Certain older, problematic trade 
accounts receivable can possibly be sold to collection companies to 
secure cash. Various companies specialize in this area, with some of the 
largest and most successful operations purchasing past-due consumer 
debt such as credit cards, auto loans, and so on (which, needless to say, 
has been very big business since 2008). But be prepared to take a signifi­
cant discount when selling receivables, because these operations don’t 
come cheap.

Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
	
✓	Slow-moving or obsolete inventory: Slow-moving and obsolete inven­
tory is often targeted for liquidation for two reasons. First, it’s tying up 
cash that could be used for other business purposes. Second, manag­
ing and maintaining inventory (that is, paying rent to store it, providing 
insurance coverage, and other necessary measures) is expensive, reach­
ing up to 10 percent or more of the inventory value on an annual basis. 
Bulk buyers of obsolete or slow-moving inventory have developed into 
a large industry (as evidenced by Overstock.com) over the past decade, 
with specialty business models developed for different types of products.
	
✓	Property, equipment, furniture, and so on: There’s probably not a 
company operating that doesn’t have some type of property, equipment, 
or furniture that’s not being used and can possibly be turned into cash. 
The issue with this asset class is not supply or availability but rather 
price, demand, and obsolescence (ever try to sell a computer that’s 
three years old?). That is, since 2007, supply has been excessive and 
demand limited, which has driven the value of this asset class very low. 
However, you may be surprised by what businesses are willing to pur­
chase; an entire cottage industry has developed that does nothing but 
facilitate the liquidation of business fixed assets.
	
✓	Other assets: Depending on a company’s operating situation, various 
other assets may be available for sale, including any intellectual prop­
erty the company may own (such as patents or trademarks), cash value 
that has built in certain life insurance policies, securities or investments 
held, and others. The pros and cons of liquidating each asset should be 
weighed prior to determining the feasibility of selling the assets (espe­
cially related to intellectual property).
Liquidating assets does represent a viable alternative, but be careful of the 
following pitfalls with this strategy:
	
✓	Values received: If you plan on moving older, slow-moving inventory in 
bulk or selling some old equipment that’s not being used, be prepared 
to take some significant value hits (well below cost). Although the cash 
received is great, the losses taken will have to be explained (to inves­
tors, lending sources, and others).
	
✓	Collateral support: Remember that certain assets represent collateral 
for loans extended to the company. If you liquidate the assets, not only 
may you be violating your loan agreement, but you may also be reducing 
your ability to borrow (as the asset base is reduced, so is the borrowing 
capacity).

 Chapter 7: Understanding Liquidity versus Available Cash
	
✓	Future growth: Liquidating assets that may not be needed in the short 
term but will be needed to support longer-term growth objectives can 
be very expensive. This cost is especially high in the event crucial intel­
lectual property is sold that represents a critical component of the busi­
ness’s ability to generate future sales and profit.
	
✓	Management time: Liquidating assets often takes much more time and 
effort than anticipated, which means that the parties responsible for this 
function are being distracted from their regular duties.
Leveraging assets
As an alternative to selling assets, another option is to leverage the inherent 
value in certain assets to generate cash. The biotechnology industry provides 
a classic example. Biotechnology companies in an early development stage 
often retain the rights to very promising research but lack the current capi­
tal and/or access to funds to continue to support the development through 
to selling the final product to consumers. These companies look to larger, 
well-established pharmaceutical organizations to structure a licensing agree­
ment whereby in exchange for an upfront payment (and potentially future 
milestone payments), the pharmaceutical organization secures an exclusive 
right to market the drug per terms and conditions established (with future 
revenue split).
A company that leases prime real estate but doesn’t currently use all the 
space (and tenant improvements associated with the space) can be another 
good example of leveraging an asset. In order to reduce overhead costs and 
free up cash, a portion of the space can be subleased to another company. 
An underutilized asset (unused space) then generates positive cash flow.
Countless other opportunities and situations exist to leverage assets. In most 
cases, the leveraged asset tends to be intangible in nature. And in almost 
any asset-leveraging transaction, multiple parties are involved, which makes 
execution more complicated and time consuming. Therefore, you must be 
creative and flexible and have the ability to think outside the box when struc­
turing deals to leverage assets for cash.
	
When pursuing a strategy of leveraging assets, always remember to secure 
proper professional counsel and support to structure the agreements. This 
counsel normally includes both financial and legal experts in addition to sub­
ject-matter experts when needed. The damage associated with not structuring 
a deal correctly can be extremely expensive.

A company that designs, manufactures, and regionally retails fine jewelry is look­
ing to structure a design agreement with a large product supplier to address the 
needs and resources of both parties. The product supplier gets access to a high-
quality designer with ample resources to produce a private-label product for sale 
in non-overlapping and international markets (thus not having to invest capi­
tal in a design studio, which would take both substantial time and money). 
The jewelry designer generates an upfront fee to produce the initial designs by 
leveraging its previous investments made in the company’s internal design 
studio capabilities and equipment (with no additional cost outlays) and tap years 
of jewelry design experience and knowledge (or trade secrets). Furthermore, the 
jewelry designer has the ability to generate future “evergreen” revenue streams 
from receiving a royalty on product sales it designed.
Relying on available lending sources
Your company’s primary lending sources, such as banks, asset-based lend­
ers, leasing companies, and the like, represent a potential source of quick 
capital if needed. The key in approaching these sources is to have solid 
information available for review and a clear action plan on how the additional 
capital will be repaid (in a reasonable time frame). But of course, as the old 
saying goes, “There’s no such thing as a free lunch,” so be prepared to pay 
when requesting changes to lending agreements.
In general, because these groups have a vested interest in seeing your busi­
ness survive, you should be able to leverage the relationship. The following 
three examples show how capital can be squeezed from these sources to 
obtain added liquidity:
	
✓	Loan advance rates: Lenders base your borrowing capacity on the 
value of the asset the loan is secured with. For example, banks com­
monly advance 80 percent on eligible trade accounts receivable. During 
a particularly tight period (for example, your business is dealing with 
increased seasonal demand), you may be able to get the lender to 
advance 85 to 90 percent of the eligible receivables (to free up some 
capital). If your bank doesn’t want to work with you, then an asset-based 
lender may be a better financial partner. As covered in Chapter 9, asset-
based lenders offer more-aggressive loan facilities in exchange for higher 
rates and tighter reporting (to compensate for the higher risk present). 
Asset-based lenders understand the importance of having access to 
capital in relation to businesses operating in challenging times.
	
✓	Asset sale lease-back: Asset sales may represent a source of quick capital 
to your business but come with a number of potential problems. You may 
want to consider executing an asset sale lease-back in which you sell the 
asset to a leasing company that in turn immediately leases it back to you. 
You achieve your goal of freeing up short-term liquidity, and the leasing 
company doesn’t have to worry about finding a new lessee for the asset.

153
 Chapter 7: Understanding Liquidity versus Available Cash
Similar to working with an asset-based lender, leasing companies that sup­
port these types of transactions are more expensive.
	
✓	Restructure notes payable: You may want to consider restructuring 
any long-term notes payable with the lender to lengthen the repayment 
period (thus reducing the current monthly payment), move it to an 
interest-only note for a short period (like 12 months), stagger principal 
payments to be lower in early years and higher in later years, or request 
a reduction in the fees and interest rates being charged. The goal is to 
reduce the capital outflow with the note agreement to better match it 
with the ability for your company to generate internal cash flows (to 
service the debt).
If you find that your company has to work with financing sources that 
aren’t traditional banks or low-risk leasing companies, you can expect to 
be charged higher interest rates and more fees. Although there are no set 
rules, on average you can expect to pay at least 3 to 6 percent more in over­
all interest costs. If the bank is charging prime rate plus 1 percent, then you 
can expect to pay at least prime rate plus 4 percent. In addition, be prepared 
to incur additional costs for asset appraisals, collateral examinations, and 
administrative fees, which can quickly increase your borrowing rate to the 
low teens (a range that is not uncommon for risk-based financing sources).
	
With that higher cost in mind, if the difference between your business making 
money and losing money is 4 percentage points, then you probably have 
deeper rooted problems present than just a short-term liquidity squeeze. 
Access to the capital is the key, so paying 4 percent more (on the capital) 
should be far cheaper than the alternative, which includes lost business 
growth opportunities or, worse yet, having the business fail.
Approaching creditors, customers, 
and other partners
Your vendors, suppliers, and yes, even your customers can be “tapped” from 
time to time to assist your business with managing potential liquidity issues. 
After all, these parties are already in bed with you and stand to lose the most 
if your company fails. In addition, vendors and suppliers stand to gain quite a 
bit if your business continues to grow and prosper (which means more busi­
ness for everyone).
	
✓	Customers: Having customers step up with an advance payment, deposit 
on a large project, or similar payment can help ease a liquidity squeeze. 
Also, providing customers with incentives to pay quicker (for example, 
giving a 1 percent discount if paid within ten days) can also be used. If 
customers have ample cash resources available that are earning them a

154
Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
measly 1 percent, why not offer an incentive that provides a chance to 
save three times that much? This type of strategy has some pitfalls, but 
in certain situations customers can be leveraged to accelerate payment 
delivery (thus providing capital to your business).
	
✓	Vendors and suppliers: If you haven’t figured this out by now, vendors 
and suppliers offer a relatively cheap and easily accessible source of 
capital to your company. Various strategies are available and range 
from requesting extended payment terms during a high sales period 
to “terming out” a portion of the balance due the vendors to be repaid 
over a longer period (for instance, instead of paying the entire balance 
in 60 days, paying it over 12 months in equal installments with a nominal 
interest rate attached).
	
✓	Internal employees: When needed, your internal employees can be 
evaluated to determine if added liquidity can be secured. In tight times, 
you may ask your senior management team to defer a portion of their 
compensation, which will then be paid when the company hits certain 
milestones. If they are resistant to this suggestion, at least you know 
where they stand in terms of their commitment to the company. Also, if 
you pay commissions on sales when they’re booked, you may want to 
restructure this program to pay commissions when the sales are actu­
ally received (in cash) to better match cash outflows with cash inflows.
	
You must remember to be careful when using customers, vendors, and sup­
pliers to provide some additional capital resources. Pushing these sources 
within the normal course of business is acceptable, but be careful not to 
appear desperate. If you convey desperation, you may actually find that pay­
ment terms tighten up and customers get nervous (thus delaying orders), 
which then produces the exact opposite of what you were trying to achieve.
Using equity and off-balance-sheet 
sources of capital
The previous sections help you look for additional capital from internal rela­
tionships and sources — assets you can leverage or tap, relationships you 
can push, and so on, to free up capital. But remember that a number of exter­
nal capital sources are also available to provide additional liquidity during a 
bind. Following are a few examples of outside options (but they really only 
scratch the surface of potential sources):
	
✓	Owner personal financial strength: Business owners and key execu­
tives are sometimes asked to step up and provide additional capital to 
support their business. If your lenders, vendors, suppliers, customers, 
and employees are all onboard, why not the owners of the business? 
Business owners with ample personal wealth are often asked to pledge 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
155
 Chapter 7: Understanding Liquidity versus Available Cash
some of this wealth for the benefit of the company. Since the Great 
Recession that began in late 2007 to early 2008, this source of capital has 
become one of the most widely utilized, as credit availability contracted 
at near record rates.
	
✓	FF&CBAs: Chapter 10 identifies FF&CBAs (family, friends, and close 
business associates) as natural sources to secure capital for a busi­
ness. During a liquidity squeeze, these sources may be able to provide a 
“bridge” loan to get the company through a tight period. Though nobody 
likes to have to ask family members for money, when your business life 
depends on it, you may have no other choice available.
	
✓	Off-balance-sheet assets: Your business may have various assets that 
aren’t included in the balance sheet or are restricted in nature. For 
example, the building your company leases may actually be owned 
by a group of investors with close ties to the company (including the 
owners of the company). Over a period of time, the building may have 
appreciated in value and thus can be refinanced, with the proceeds then 
loaned to your company from the legal entity that owns the building. 
Conversely, if the legal entity that owns the building has the resources, 
the lease payments from your company can be reduced or deferred for a 
period of time to free up cash.
	
Business owners and key executive management team members have the 
most to gain if a business succeeds and the most to lose if it fails. Stepping up 
on the capital front provides for much more than simply helping with a liquid­
ity squeeze. Rather, it displays creditability to other parties that the manage­
ment team and business owners believe in the business and are willing to 
stand behind it (in good times and in bad).
Financial Leverage: The Good, the Bad, 
and the Downright Ugly
Financial leverage is best measured by a business-solvency measurement 
tool: the debt-to-equity ratio (as discussed earlier in “Measuring and monitor­
ing solvency”). That is, the higher the amount of debt your company has in 
relation to your equity, the higher the ratio is, which indicates that your com­
pany is operating with a greater degree of financial risk. As such, financial 
leverage can be broken down into the good, the bad, and the downright ugly.
The good
If properly managed, financial leverage can enhance your company’s profit­
ability and improve earnings per share. These increases allow the company 
to secure less equity-based capital (because the appropriate amount and

156
Part II: Using Financial Statements to Assess Cash Health 
type of debt-based capital is secured), providing the business owners with 
greater ownership control of the entity. In order to achieve the good, you 
must remember to keep the balance sheet in balance and avoid leverag­
ing your assets too high. Companies always need to remember to keep a 
war chest available to manage both business problems and opportunities. 
The challenge is to find the ideal balance between equity and debt capital 
sources.
The bad
Financial leverage can often produce a certain amount of business and per­
sonal stress during the down times. The creditors of your company tend 
to be more interested in getting repaid during the down times than provid­
ing additional capital (to support a new growth opportunity). Companies 
that have strong equity levels can afford some missteps along the way and, 
therefore, have more leeway in pursuing new markets than companies oper­
ating under heavy debt loads. Although you may survive a down period and 
manage to get your company’s debt under control, a stronger competitor 
may have seized the moment and captured new market opportunities that 
you didn’t have the resources to pursue.
The downright ugly
Financial leverage gets downright ugly when it’s so excessive (or high) that 
you’ve tapped out every asset and have nothing left to work with. In this sce­
nario, your debt-financing sources may push the company into bankruptcy 
or, worse yet, into an involuntary liquidation (covered in our book Small 
Business Financial Management Kit For Dummies [John Wiley & Sons, Inc.]). 
Basically, you reach a point of no hope in terms of being able to repay the 
debt and turn around your operations. The remaining option is then to lose 
control of your company and watch others dismantle it to settle the obliga­
tions due.
	
So in order to avoid becoming the downright ugly poster child, adhere to 
three pieces of advice: Have a clear understanding of your company’s finan­
cial condition at all times (translation: Understand your financial statements), 
always have a strong business plan and a clear understanding of where your 
business is headed, and always use debt and equity appropriately.

Getting Intimate 
with Your Company’s 
Cash Flow Needs

In this part . . .
T

his part of the book gets down to the nitty-gritty of 
managing cash flow in the present “real world” of 
business — which is characterized by capital sources 
applying tighter and tighter scrutiny and tougher and 
tougher standards to businesses. If a business comes 
across as inexperienced or superficial about its cash-flow 
management skills, its chances of getting a loan or equity 
capital quickly drop to zero.
The four chapters in this part follow a logical path along 
the road to business success, starting with formulating a

T

o start this chapter, we make a statement that should resonate loud and 
clear: No Plan = No Cash. Looking at the point from a different perspec­
tive, if you were a potential investor or lending source, would you provide 
cash (in the form of a purchase of stock or by providing a loan) to a company 
without having a clear understanding of the amount and when and in what 
structure or form the cash is required? Or would you, as a CEO or division 
president, commit cash to support a growing business segment without 
knowing how much is required and how the cash will be deployed? The 
answer to these questions (hopefully) is no. Whether a business is a start-up 
or a mature operation, developing a clear and concise business plan repre­
sents an essential tool to assist businesses with securing cash, managing 
their operations, and protecting their business interests.
This chapter provides the basic understanding and tools needed to develop a 
viable business plan, which is translated into economic value via the produc­
tion of financial forecasts and projections. The planning process described 
in this chapter includes numerous elements ranging from obtaining current 
market information (on the potential demand for a new product and what 
price the market will support) to evaluating personnel resources (to ensure 
that proper professionals are available to support a business) to determin­
ing how great operational constraints (like manufacturing space availability 
or environmental regulations) may be in terms of expanding into a new geo­
graphical location.

The overall planning process, including the production of projections or fore­
casts, does not represent a “chicken or the egg” riddle. From a financial per­
spective, the preparation of budgets, forecasts, and projections (all terms that 
are used interchangeably throughout this chapter) represent the end result of 
the entire planning process. Hence, you must first accumulate the necessary 
data and information on which to build a forecasting model prior to producing 
projected financial information. Trying to create a forecast before looking at 
past performance, present conditions, and future expectations will result in a 
budget that doesn’t capture your company’s true economic structure.
Outlining the Basic Business Plan
Before aspiring entrepreneurs and corporate-ladder climbers can effec­
tively pursue their business interests, they must develop a business plan. 
All too often, companies proceed with strategies of “We’ve always done it 
like that” or “This is how the industry has operated for the past umpteen 
years” instead of really evaluating and investigating the economic markets in 
which they operate. The business plan represents management’s foundation 
and justification for birthing, growing, operating, and/or selling a business 
based on the economic environment present. Without it, management is left 
to operate a business in the dark, attempting to guess or use their intuition 
about the best course of action to pursue.
Business plans come in a variety of shapes, sizes, forms, and structures and 
often take on the characteristics of the business founder(s). No, the busi­
ness plan won’t be brunette or enjoy hiking, but it can resemble its creators 
by emphasizing certain traits or areas of expertise the founders may have. 
For instance, a type-A personality may use a number of bold adjectives to 
describe the massive, huge, unlimited, exceptional (you get the point) poten­
tial of the market opportunity present. As for unique areas of expertise, 
different sections of the business plan may be developed in depth, whereas 
other sections may be presented in quasi-summary format because the 
needed information isn’t readily available (for presentation).
	
Herein lies the first lesson of developing a business plan: The business plan 
should be built from the outside looking in so that any reasonable party can 
clearly and quickly understand the business concept.
The business plan can come in a multitude of formats and include all types 
of information, data, graphs, charts, analyses, and more. The basis of every 
business plan, however, is in four main sections, which we cover in the fol­
lowing sections.

 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Plan to Secure Cash
The executive summary
First and foremost in a typical business plan is the presentation of the execu­
tive summary. The executive summary is a brief overview of the business 
concept in terms of the market opportunity present, the operational logistics 
required to bring a product and/or service to market, the management team 
that’s going to make it happen, and the eventual potential economic return 
available, including the amount of capital needed to execute the plan. This 
section of the business plan is really nothing more than a condensed sum­
mary of the entire business concept, presented in a neat and tidy overview 
of usually not more than five pages (and hopefully fewer). The general idea is 
that the executive summary should capture the critical content of each of the 
three primary areas of the business plan in a very efficient and easy to digest 
manner.
	
Although the meat of the business plan resides in the remainder of the docu­
ment, this section is the most critical in terms of attracting interest from 
capital sources and/or management. Basically, the reader of the business plan 
must be able to conceptualize, understand, and justify the business concept 
from the information presented in the executive summary. This section must 
gain the reader’s interest, generate some type of excitement, and move him 
with a sense of urgency to pursue the business opportunity at hand.
The market assessment
The second section of the business plan is generally dedicated to the market 
for the product or service being offered. Yes, we know that you may have 
trouble believing that the authors of this book, being accountants, would 
place marketing above finance and accounting issues. But the fact of the 
matter is that without a viable market, the only thing to account for is losses 
(and you know how much capital/financing sources and management love 
these). The marketing assessment segment of the business plan is often the 
most important because it substantiates the need for a product and/or ser­
vice that’s not being filled in the current economic environment.
	
You support the business concept by quantifying the size of the market in 
coordination with qualifying the market need, but that step is only half the 
battle (and often the easier of the two halves). Beyond providing informa­
tion and supporting data on the market size, characteristics, and trends, the 
market assessment must also present a clear understanding of the business’s 
competitive niche, target market, and specific marketing strategies. Identifying 
the specific niche and target market and developing an effective marketing 
strategy to capitalize on the opportunity present is often more challenging 
and critical to the future success of the business. And to top it all off, locating

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
reliable and meaningful data essential to supporting your conclusions on the 
market opportunity can often be difficult.
	
All marketing sections should include a summary of the competition that 
savvy entrepreneurs or business managers can use to their advantage in sev­
eral ways:
	
✓	By including an overview of the competition, the business establishes 
credibility with the readers (because it indicates that you’ve done your 
homework).
	
✓	By reading in-depth competitor assessments, managers may identify 
weaknesses in competitors’ plans that can be exploited.
	
✓	By evaluating competitors’ strengths and weaknesses, managers can 
better understand business risks.
The operational overview
Following the market segment of the business plan is a well-developed com­
pany operating overview. This segment of the business plan addresses a 
number of operational issues, including personnel requirements, technologi­
cal needs, locations (for offices, production/manufacturing, warehouses/
distribution centers, and so on), company infrastructure requirements, 
international considerations, professional/expert counsel resources, and the 
like. This segment drives various business-operating elements in terms of the 
resources needed to implement and execute the business plan. For example, 
if a company is planning on expanding into new foreign markets where the 
local government still “influences” the distribution channels, then the operat­
ing segment needs to address how the product will be distributed and what 
international partners will be essential to the process.
	
Business plans often dedicate a large portion of the operational overview to 
providing an overview of the management team in terms of the members’ past 
credentials as well as their responsibilities with the new business concept 
moving forward. The market may be ripe and capital plentiful, but without a 
qualified management team, the business concept will, more times than not, 
sink. In today’s challenging economic environment, management qualifica­
tions and credibility have taken on an entirely new level of importance, given 
the heightened sensitivity to management accountability and transparency.
	
The management team responsible for executing the business plan is, in 
effect, the business plan. Initially, financing and capital sources are lured in 
by business plans and may turn over any concept in the plan to a slew of 
professionals for further due diligence, reviews, evaluations, and critique. For

 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Plan to Secure Cash
example, if a capital source has concerns over the technological basis within 
a biomedical company, then medical- or technology-based professionals can 
be brought in to complete additional due diligence and either approve or can 
the idea. However, the management team standing behind the business plan 
and its execution is really what the capital and financing sources invest in. The 
integrity, qualifications, experience, determination, passion, and commitment 
displayed by the management team are of utmost importance. Any concerns 
in this area, and the capital and financing sources have their out.
The financial summary: Performance 
and required capital (Cash)
Finally, the financial segment of the business plan is developed. In a sense, 
the financial summary brings all the elements of the business plan together 
from an accounting and/or financing perspective. In the financial summary, 
financial forecasts are prepared to project the anticipated economic perfor­
mance of the business concept based on the information and data presented 
earlier in the business plan:
	
✓	The market segment tends to drive the revenue portion of the forecasts, 
because the information accumulated and presented there substantiates 
items such as potential unit sales growth (in relation to the size of the 
market), pricing, and revenue sources by product and service.
	
✓	The operational overview drives the expense element of the forecast 
because it addresses the business cost structure in terms of personnel, 
assets, company infrastructure, and so on.
When all the elements of the business plan are put together in this segment, 
not only is the forecast profit and loss or income statement produced but, 
just as importantly, the projected balance sheet and cash-flow statement are 
generated as well. And you guessed it: With all this information now in hand, 
the capital (or cash) required to execute the business plan should be readily 
quantifiable.
Developing a Business Plan
As coauthor John has pointed out on many occasions (and in numerous 
books he has published), accounting represents more of an art than a sci­
ence. This concept also holds true with the planning process, and more than 
a few accounting Picassos and Rembrandts have been created during the 
preparation of a business plan. We dive into some more-complex forecasting 
concepts in Chapter 9, but for now we stick to planning basics. We start by 
determining where you begin the process of creating a business plan.

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
	
The preparation of business plans should not be reserved for new companies 
just starting out or an existing business looking at launching new products. All 
companies should implement formal business-planning processes to ensure 
that their business interests are properly managed and protected.
Outlining your plan by using 
BOTE, WAG, and SWAG
The real start of developing any business plan is coming up with the initial 
concept, idea, or thought. This starting point applies equally to a long-standing 
business evaluating the costs and benefits of outsourcing a product manufac­
turing process and to a newly launched social-media company targeting the 
aging Baby Boomer population.
	
Okay, so what do the acronyms in the preceding heading stand for?
	
✓	BOTE: Back of the envelope
	
✓	WAG: Wild-ass guess
	
✓	SWAG: Scientific wild-ass guess
These terms represent the progression many business plans go through as 
they are developed. We offer these acronyms on developing business plans 
and projections somewhat in jest, but at the same time, they do help you 
understand the evolution of a business plan and projection model from how 
an idea is born to how the idea is communicated in an economic format/fash­
ion to various parties.
	
Whether you apply these acronyms and follow this logic or rely on another 
creation and development cycle, the same key concept holds. Business plans 
and projection models should continue to evolve, improve, and strengthen 
over time as more and more effort is invested to bring the idea to life.
BOTE
BOTE usually represents the very first financial projection developed for 
a business plan: back of the envelope (or maybe in this day and age of 
advanced technology a more appropriate acronym would be 4GSS, or fourth-
generation screen shot). Yes, even the majority of the most astute and expe­
rienced business professionals and entrepreneurs can attest to jotting down 
the basic concepts, needs, potential sales, costs, and profits of a business 
idea or concept on a random piece of paper (or with a simple mobile commu­
nication device application). Sometimes you need to get it out of your head 
and down in writing just to see if it makes any sense to begin with. You would 
be amazed at how often BOTE estimates are used.

165
 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Plan to Secure Cash
WAG
If the idea passes the BOTE test, the next step in the evolution of the plan­
ning process is the ever-present WAG (or wild-ass guess). The WAG is 
somewhat more sophisticated than the BOTE in that it tends to incorporate 
more thought and some basic research. WAGs are usually produced using 
software tools such as Excel and incorporate the basic economic structure 
of the business, starting with sales and then moving through the remainder 
of the income statement by capturing costs of sales, operating expenses, and 
overhead or general and administrative costs. You can then draw two simple 
conclusions:
	
✓	How profitable the idea will be
	
✓	More importantly, how much capital or cash the idea needs in order to 
achieve success
These conclusions aren’t overly sophisticated, but they’re a very early 
attempt to put some financial logic behind the idea.
SWAG
If your idea has passed both the BOTE and WAG stages, congratulations are 
in order because you now can use the much more powerful tool, SWAG (sci­
entific wild-ass guess) to further the development of your business plan. In 
other words, the business plan and supporting projection model are actually 
getting some serious attention and logical consideration. The idea can actually 
start to be substantiated and corroborated by external sources (or from third-
party data/information). The first real form to the business plan and projection 
models are taking shape. You may be incorporating the use of technology tools 
to draft the business plan (for example, Microsoft Word), to build version 1.0 of 
the projection model (perhaps with Microsoft Excel), and to begin to prepare a 
presentation to summarize the plan (for example, with Microsoft PowerPoint).
Getting the process going
After the business’s executive management teams or new company found­
ers have decided that the concept for the new business endeavor has merit 
(which is by no means a small task), drafting of the business plan can begin. 
You can prepare a draft by following four simple steps:
	
✓	Delve into historical business information. In order to start the budget­
ing process, you should have a very good understanding of your com­
pany’s prior financial and operating results. Review as much history as 
is available and relevant to the current idea, whether it stretches back 
three months, one year, five years, or longer. Of course for newly formed 
businesses, the availability of internal historical information is limited, 
but plenty of external information is usually available from like busi­
nesses and competitors and can be utilized to develop a business plan.

166
Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
	
	Remember that although the history of a company may provide a basic 
foundation on which to develop a budget, it by no means is an accurate 
predictor of the future.
	
✓	Involve key management. You must ensure that all key management 
team members are involved in the planning process, covering all critical 
business functions, to produce a projection that can be relied upon. The 
accounting and financial departments actively participate in the plan­
ning (and rightfully so, as these are the people who understand the num­
bers the best) and they produce the final forecast. But the data on which 
the projection model is based comes from numerous parties, sources, 
and business functions. Just like you wouldn’t have a regional sales 
manager prepare a fixed asset schedule (tracking all asset additions, dis­
posals, and depreciation expense), you wouldn’t have your accountant 
estimate sales volumes by product line during the holiday season (and 
what prices the products may fetch). Critical business data comes from 
numerous parties, all of whom must be included in the planning process 
to produce the most reliable information possible.
	
✓	Gather reliable data. The availability of quality market, operational, 
and accounting data represents the basis of the budget. A good deal of 
this data often comes from internal sources. For example, when a sales 
region is preparing a budget for the upcoming year, the sales manager 
may survey the direct sales representatives on what they feel their cus­
tomers’ demand for products and services will be in the coming year 
(after all, who better to accumulate this information than the people in 
the field with the direct relationships?). With this information, sales vol­
umes, personnel levels, wages rates, commission plans, and so on can 
all be determined.
	
	The internal information will certainly be of value, but it represents only 
half the battle because external information and data are just as critical 
to accumulate. Having access to quality and reliable external third-party-
produced information is absolutely essential to the overall business 
planning process and the production of reliable forecasts. Market forces 
and trends that aren’t apparent in internal data may be occurring and 
set to impact your business over the next 24 months.
	
✓	Coordinate the planning timing. Most companies tend to start the 
planning process for the next year in the fourth quarter of their current 
calendar year. This way, they have access to recent financial results on 
which to support the budgeting process moving forward.
	
	The nearer-term the projection, the more detailed the information and 
results being produced. If you prepare a budget for the coming fiscal 
year, then you can reasonably include monthly financial statement fore­
casts (with more detailed support available). Looking two or three years 
out, you can produce quarterly financial statement projections (with 
more summarized assumptions used), and so on.

GIGO, or garbage in, garbage out, definitely applies to the planning process. If 
you don’t have sound data and information at the core of the planning process 
(or if the data and information are poor in quality), the output produced will 
be of little value to the management team. When preparing your company’s 
budgets, try to use data and information that’s as complete, accurate, reliable, 
and timely as possible. Though you can’t be 100 percent sure about the data 
and information accumulated for your plan (because by definition, you’re 
attempting to predict the future with a projection), with proper resources 
(including appropriate internal management, external subject-matter experts 
or consultants, and allocating financial resources to secure critical informa­
tion that’s not readily available or free) dedicated to the process, you can 
avoid large information “black holes.”
	
All too often, we come across budgets and forecasts that were prepared from 
an outdated business economic model. Just ask any retailer that formerly 
relied on brick-and-mortar stores and print-based advertising campaigns how 
the Internet and e-commerce have reshaped the business models. Though 
management has put forth the effort to restructure the company’s operations 
in a changing market environment, a plan based on an old projection model 
with outdated assumptions doesn’t capture the essence of the new economic 
realities. Remember, the planning process represents a living, evolving thing 
that must constantly be updated and adapted to changing market conditions. 
What worked two years ago may not provide management with the necessary 
information today on which to make appropriate business decisions.
Using two simple but powerful 
tools: SWOT and KISS
As described in the preceding sections, the heart of the planning process 
is the initial business idea or concept (that the plan is being developed 
around), which is then substantiated by accumulating what may seem like 
never-ending volumes of information and data. If you’re not careful, the data-
accumulation process can engulf the entire planning effort; if you get too 
much data, you can’t digest it or draw any type of meaningful conclusion. But 
fret not, friends, because two simple but powerful planning tools are avail­
able to help manage data overload: SWOT and KISS.
The SWOT analysis
Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats: A SWOT analysis is a 
very effective planning and budgeting tool used to keep businesses focused 
on critical issues that may lead to wonderful successes or horrible failures. 
The SWOT analysis should be as comprehensive as possible and capture 
both relevant information for the specific idea as well as incorporating more 
broad-based data about the company, the industry, and the competition. The 
simple SWOT analysis (or matrix) in Figure 8-1 provides a better understand­
ing of how it works.

(Potential competitive, economic, or environmental factors 
that may hurt your business)
 
External 
A SWOT analysis is usually broken down into a matrix containing four seg­
ments. Two of the segments are geared toward positive attributes (for 
instance, what are our strengths and what are the opportunities) and two 
towards negative attributes (what are our weaknesses and what are the 
threats). In addition to illustrating these categories, Figure 8-1 makes refer­
ence to the terms internal versus external. This distinction highlights the fact 
that certain attributes tend to come from internal company sources (namely, 
strengths and weaknesses) and other attributes from external, or outside of 
the company sources (typically opportunities and threats).
	
If used correctly, a SWOT analysis not only can provide invaluable informa­
tion to support the planning process but also (and more importantly) can 
help identify what type of management a business has in place. The responses 
received from the management team engaged in the planning process provide 
invaluable information as to whether the party completing the SWOT analysis 
is nothing more than a frontline manager (that is, a captain needing direction)

 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Plan to Secure Cash
or a bona fide business person (the colonel leading the charge). When busi­
ness plans are developed and launched, ultimately their success is dependent 
on having the right leaders driving the bus to take the opportunity from a con­
cept to reality. Frontline managers can assist with this process but are gener­
ally not qualified to lead.
SWOT analyses may be completed by a variety of different parties. In a larger or 
well-established business, the SWOT analysis may be delegated to the manage­
ment team assigned a project or opportunity to complete. The SWOT analysis 
is then evaluated and interpreted by the company’s executives, who consider 
whether it’s viable and whether the right people are in place. On the other hand, 
two founders just starting a business may complete a SWOT analysis (so the 
concept of senior management evaluations is not relevant, although external 
investors may have a keen interest in the SWOT analysis). The key concept here 
is that the parties responsible for preparing the SWOT analysis should be heav­
ily vested in the opportunity and be willing to take possession and responsibility.
Remember to KISS
You know what KISS stands for: Keep it simple, stupid. Used in the market­
ing world for years, the concept of KISS also applies to the planning process 
every bit as much. Key company management should be involved in the 
process of planning, but these executives tend not to be well educated in the 
world of accounting and finance. So rather than confuse these poor souls 
with technical accounting and financial jargon, the goal should be to provide 
guidance and support that allows them to accumulate the information that 
can easily be translated into accounting and financial results.
	
If you’re an executive or owner of a business, you must be able to understand 
the big picture and your company’s key economic drivers in order to prepare 
proper business plans, strategies, and, ultimately, forecasts. The ability to 
understand and positively affect the key economic drivers of your business and 
empower the management team to execute the business plan represents the 
end game. Getting lost in excessive amounts of detail (“Why did you spend an 
extra $500 on the trip to Florida?”) is generally not the best use of senior man­
agement’s time, because every level of detail adds more and more complexity to 
the plan, which can get overwhelmed with TMI (too much information).
Incorporating Third-Party 
Information into Your Plan
When building reliable and credible business plans, the importance of accu­
mulating data and information from reliable (and we want to emphasize 
reliable) independent third parties (including various trade and industry 
sources) cannot be underestimated. In this section, we expound on this sub­
ject to clarify why it’s so important.

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
Gathering the info
To start, the process of actually gathering independent third-party infor­
mation, data, and reports needs to be addressed. The Internet is, without 
question, one of the most powerful data- and information-gathering tools 
available. In the dark ages, valuable market, industry, and technological infor­
mation was gathered via such archaic methods as researching in a library, 
subscribing to trade journals and magazines, and attending seminars or edu­
cational trade shows. Today, most of the information you need is available 
electronically over the World Wide Web, which has improved the efficiency 
of accumulating information significantly. Most industries’ trade organiza­
tions now regularly produce and provide content via the web, but you have 
to be prepared to pay for it, because quality and reliable information costs 
money.
	
Incorporate trade shows, seminars, and educational events into your efforts to 
accumulate third-party data. Not only can these events offer a great source of 
information, but they also (and potentially more importantly) can be places to 
make contacts with potential future employees, vendors, customers, and fund­
ing sources who can assist with the execution of the business plan.
The third-party information you gather should cover multiple aspects of 
your business. Following are three examples of data sources for a jewelry 
company:
	
✓	The World Gold Council provides an excellent overview of consumer 
gold-buying trends and patterns by price points, types of jewelry, and 
different sales channels. This information can support the marketing 
segment of the business plan.
	
✓	If the production of jewelry is required, then information on available 
manufacturing sources is needed. Because a large majority of jewelry is 
produced globally (from Southeast Asia to Europe to Central America), 
the company needs to make sure that it has a good handle on the politi­
cal, social, and economic stability of any foreign suppliers.
	
✓	In addition, if the jewelry company is going to sell products through 
retail storefronts, then an overview of commercial real estate rental 
rates, trends, and so on can be incorporated (for a specific geographical 
area) to support a critical expense driver in the business.
Using only reliable info
A significant additional benefit of obtaining and incorporating independent and 
reliable third-party information is that it carries added weight/credibility with 
readers. Readers see proof that the management team isn’t just making up the 
story in the business plan. In fact, hard facts are available from independent 
sources supporting the objectives and conclusions of the business plan.

 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Plan to Secure Cash
We can’t emphasize enough the importance of securing reliable third-party 
or external information. The quality and reliability of your data is way more 
important than quantity. While the web has become an incredibly powerful 
data-accumulation and distribution tool, it also has become just as powerful 
in distributing worthless and/or distorted information. Face it, 99 percent 
of the information available on the web is just noise or clutter and must be 
properly evaluated to ensure that the most appropriate and reliable infor­
mation is accessed. So beware of the data source, because nothing is more 
embarrassing than finding out you’ve referenced unreliable third-party infor­
mation in your business plan.
	
Any party reading your business plan expects you to be an industry expert, 
so if you’re not an industry expert, you had better become one very fast. You 
don’t need to have an answer for every question and understand every busi­
ness topic from top to bottom (professional advice can be secured for addi­
tional support), but the management team responsible for the business plan 
should have strong knowledge of at least 80 percent of the topics presented in 
the plan.
Riding the CART Concept: Complete, 
Accurate, Reliable, and Timely
During the whole planning process, you’ll do well to remember the impor­
tance of data that is CART: complete, accurate, reliable, and timely. Actually, 
the concept of CART should be applied to all business segments; whether 
you’re developing a business plan, analyzing periodic operating results, or 
evaluating a employee benefit plan, business owners and managers must 
have complete, accurate, reliable, and timely information to make appropri­
ate business decisions. Whether the information and data is coming from 
internal or external sources, from the marketing or manufacturing depart­
ments, and is presented in terms of the number of “heads” needed or by the 
total wages to be paid, the basis of the budget is having access to complete, 
accurate, reliable, and timely information.
	
✓	Complete: When financial statements are produced for a company, they 
include a balance sheet, income statement, and a statement of cash 
flows. All three are needed in order to understand the entire financial 
picture of a company. If a projection model is incorporating an expan­
sion of a company’s manufacturing facility in a new state (to keep up 
with rising demand), all information related to the new facility needs 
to be accumulated to prepare the budget. This info includes the cost of 
the land and facility, how much utility costs run in the area, what poten­
tial environmental issues may be present, whether a trained workforce 
is available and, if not, how much the training cost will be, and so on. 
Overkill is not the objective; having access to all “material” information 
and data is.

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
	
✓	Accurate: Incorporating accurate data is absolutely essential for prepar­
ing the business plan. Every business plan needs to state the price your 
company charges for the goods or services it sells, how much employ­
ees are paid, what the monthly office rent is, what evolving patterns 
exist in sales channels, and every other relevant detail. Accumulating 
accurate information, whether from internal sources or external third 
parties, represents a critical and ongoing management endeavor.
	
✓	Reliable: The concepts of reliability and accuracy are closely linked, but 
they differ as well. A piece of information may be accurate without being 
reliable. For example, you may conduct some research and find that the 
average wage for a paralegal in San Diego, California, is $24 per hour. 
This data sounds accurate, but if the business model you’re developing 
requires paralegals with special training who demand $37 per hour, the 
information is not reliable.
	
✓	Timely: Finally, the information and data must be accumulated in a 
timely fashion. Data provided six months after it was needed doesn’t do 
management much good. Companies live and die by having access to 
real-time information on which to make business decisions and change 
course (and forecasts) if needed.
An old phrase that’s often quoted, “Put the cart before the horse,” means to 
reverse the accepted order of things. However, the CART principle is a case 
in which the “cart” always needs to come first. You must put the CART infor­
mation and data before the horse (the business plan). If you attempt to offer 
a business plan that hasn’t been created through CART data, the end result 
will be nothing short of disastrous.

Models to Manage Cash
In This Chapter

▶	Putting your forecasts to good use
C

hapter 8 focuses on developing a business plan to substantiate an 
opportunity and, for all intents and purposes, to identify how much 
capital (cash) is needed to execute the opportunity. The financial summary 
segment of the business plan pulls together all the parts of the plan from an 
economic perspective via the preparation of financial forecasts or projec­
tions. In this chapter, we now turn our attention to building financial fore­
casts, or projection models, to quantify the business plan.
	
The forecasting process is much easier to undertake (and ultimately under­
stand) if the majority of the relevant data needed is accumulated beforehand 
because you’ll have the big picture in mind. Remember the Boy Scouts’ motto 
and “be prepared.” The better prepared you are with the basics of the busi­
ness plan and key assumptions, the easier it is to build financial projection 
models that are credible and reliable.
Rounding Up Resources to 
Build Financial Forecasts
The first thing you want to consider in preparing financial forecasts is identi­
fying and securing the appropriate resources: personnel to complete the pro­
jections and software to prepare flexible and adaptable projection models. 
On the personnel front, the budgeting task tends to fall on the accounting 
and finance department because these are the people in the organization 
who seem to work best with “the numbers.”

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
	
The accounting and finance department may prepare the actual budget, but 
the base information required for completion of the budget comes from all the 
critical operations of the organization.
On the software front, the following two choices are readily available to com­
plete company projections:
	
✓	Stand-alone software: The ever-popular Microsoft Excel is very flexible 
and relatively easy to use, for both nonfinancial types who simply want 
to do addition and multiplication and financial types who use the pro­
gram’s more-sophisticated features, like macros and lookup tables. Excel 
is extremely versatile and can be found in use in companies as small as 
the local deli to billion-dollar-a-year organizations. If a little more sophis­
tication is desired, then financial-forecasting software is available, such 
as Alight Planning Enterprise and Budget Maestro (which tend to be 
geared toward the middle market or companies with annual revenues in 
excess of $100 million).
	
✓	The budgeting component of accounting software: Most accounting soft­
ware packages (QuickBooks, Great Plains, and others) include a budgeting 
module to support this function, but in general these modules aren’t as flex­
ible as Excel (and are a little more difficult to use). Note: Most accounting 
software packages easily interface with Excel, so a combination of strate­
gies may be used. For example, you may create the base projection model 
in Excel and export the results into the accounting software module.
Planning with the Big Picture in Mind
After getting your personnel and software resources in place, one last task needs 
to be tackled before a basic financial projection model can be structured. You 
need to take a step back from the mounds of information of data that’s been 
accumulated and take a look from the 20,000-foot level at what you’re attempting 
to accomplish. In other words, make sure that the financial projection model will 
give you the critical output needed in order to clearly and concisely summarize 
the economic proposition presented in the business plan.
Deciding on a top-down versus 
bottom-up projection strategy
Financial forecasts are usually built on one of two logic structures — from 
the top down or the bottom up.
Top-down projection models build the logic in the model from sales and rev­
enue expectations first (as in the income statement, sales are always listed 
first), which then drive the cost structure of a business. Key sales information

 Chapter 9: Building Best-in-Class Projection Models to Manage Cash
related to unit volumes, price points, different types of revenue (for example, 
for a technology company, sales can be driven from technology licensing, 
system integration fees, and other related fees), different sources of revenue 
(a technology company may sell technology to the government market, which 
is very different from a manufacturing company), and other factors. This infor­
mation is then used to build out the cost structure of the business as various 
expenses are calculated or determined based on projected revenue levels. The 
following example shows how a top-down projection works:
Top down: In the business plan, the long-term objective of a sales team 
is for each sales representative to be responsible for generating $1 mil­
lion per year in sales, starting at $500,000 in year one and growing to $1 
million by year three. So the projection model calculates the number 
of sales representatives needed based on the revenue being generated 
during a given period. If sales of $6 million are expected in year two and 
the average sales representative is responsible for $750,000 of sales, eight 
sales representatives are needed. If each sales representative is paid a 
base salary of $50,000 and earns a commission of 5 percent of sales, then 
the total sales representative compensation expense of $700,000 can be 
easily calculated from the logic in the projection model. The math is as 
follows:
8 sales representatives × $50,000 salary = $400,000
5% commission × $6 million in sales = $300,000
$400,000 in salaries + $300,000 in commissions = $700,000 in total com­
pensation
	
This example is rather simplistic, as it assumes that all sales representatives 
would be working from day one for the entire year. In reality, sales and related 
expenses tend to build over time and not in a linear fashion. So when building 
a financial projection model, a clear understanding of variable, semivariable, 
and fixed expenses needs to be obtained and incorporated to produce more 
accurate output.
So if a top-down projection focuses on sales and revenue levels, then you can 
probably guess that a bottom-up projection model is driven by cost/expense 
information first, which then predicts sales and revenue results. Though 
this type of financial projection model isn’t as widely used as the top-down 
variety, a number of businesses and industries rely on it, as in the following 
example.
Bottom up: Government defense contracting businesses usually generate 
revenue from one of two types of contracts — fixed fee or cost plus. In 
a cost-plus contract, all costs associated with a specific project (as sup­
ported by a contract executed with the government) are accumulated 
and then billed to the government with overhead rates applied and a con­
tract profit margin attached. Hence, revenue is determined based on the 
actual costs incurred, which are accumulated and billed to the govern­
ment on a periodic basis. But before the government executes a contract, 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
176
Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
it needs an estimate of the anticipated total cost of the contract, which is 
often based on a financial projection. So in this environment, costs need 
to be accumulated first to assist with calculating the total value of the 
contract (that the government will be responsible for paying). Or in other 
words, the costs drive the sales.
	
More-sophisticated financial projection models often incorporate elements of 
both top-down and bottom-up strategies. Certain components of the financial 
projection model may very well be built on top-down assumptions (such as 
sales and direct costs of sales, which vary directly with sales levels), whereas 
various fixed-cost functions within a business are built from the bottom up.
In the end, both projection-modeling strategies end up focusing on the most 
critical element of every business plan: sales. That is, without sales, the busi­
ness isn’t going to last very long because nobody wants to support a money-
losing operation for very long. And of course, the need for sales ties back to 
the business plan, which at its heart addresses how your business’s products 
or services will satisfy a market need or demand.
Identifying your critical business 
economic drivers
Most businesses or business units/divisions of larger companies have numer­
ous moving parts that on first glance may appear to be very complex and 
overly detailed. Looking at all the information from these different areas and 
then attempting to build a financial projection model to capture every line 
item of detail can, needless to say, be a very daunting task. So when you get 
overwhelmed, remember to revisit your 20,000-foot view by taking a step 
back and identifying and understanding what the key economic drivers of 
your business are.
Key economic drivers vary from business to business. What may be a key 
driver in the personnel staffing industry (which is very sensitive to employee 
wages) is very different from what drives a technology manufacturing com­
pany (which is very sensitive to supporting a high fixed-cost manufacturing 
facility). But though the drivers may be different, the big picture is basically 
as follows:
	
✓	For most companies, economic life or death is usually centered on a half 
dozen or fewer critical economic drivers. Roughly four to six key items 
determine whether you make money or lose money.
	
✓	The critical economic drivers account for the majority of financial activ­
ity, transactions, and management attention within the business. This 
point should make perfect sense because there’s no point investing 
countless hours tracking down every credit card receipt supporting an 
employee expense report to confirm whether an $18 charge was valid.

177
 Chapter 9: Building Best-in-Class Projection Models to Manage Cash
Rather, time and effort should be invested in areas that have the best 
chance to improve operating results.
	
✓	The allocation of key economic drivers is usually split 50/50 between 
sales and expenses. For example, in a professional service firm (such 
as a law firm), billable hours per period represents a critical operating 
metric at the sales level. On the expense side of life, the average wage 
paid to each professional is extremely important. If the firm charges 
a market-accepted bill rate, then if the professional has billed enough 
hours, the firm generates profits.
	
A high-technology manufacturing company made a significant investment 
in its production facility to support large volumes of low-cost technologi­
cal products (through the year 2000). Over the course of the next five years, 
market conditions changed, with low-cost, high-volume production moving to 
cheaper foreign markets, leaving only the advanced-technology, higher-cost, 
and lower-volume products to be produced in the United States. During this 
transition period, the company’s investment in its production facility did not 
change, because it represented a fixed cost that doesn’t vary with production 
levels.
In order to survive and generate profits on lower sales volumes, significant 
price increases were required on a per-unit basis to offset the loss in revenue 
and profits. So the key economic drivers for this business boiled down to two 
primary items: what price was needed per unit (based on lower volumes) 
to cover the company’s high production-facility fixed costs, and what costs 
(generally variable or semivariable in nature because they’re easier to reduce 
over a shorter time period) could be decreased to help the company lower 
its break-even point and improve profitability. As for the first item, the com­
pany’s average price per unit increased by over 300 percent over a five-year 
period to drive additional earnings. As for the second item, unproductive 
personnel (related to the older business model) were eliminated to reduce 
expenses.
As this example helps illustrate, each business owner or manager has the 
responsibility of clearly understanding what really drives the company’s 
financial performance. When these drivers are clearly understood, top busi­
ness owners and managers can quickly decipher and translate this data to 
determine whether a company made money or lost money. If you know your 
revenue level (over a period of time, such as a month) by types of products 
and services sold, you should already know whether you made money or lost 
money.
	
Well-run businesses often use the periodic production of financial statements 
to simply confirm what they already know or suspect rather than gain new 
info. If you’re relying on monthly financial statements to relay the perfor­
mance of your company, which is always something new, unexpected, and/or 
a surprise, then you’re behind the curve.

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
Building the Basic Projection Model
The best way to dive into preparing a projection is to start by reviewing 
Figure 9-1, which represents a yearly budget for ACME Distribution, Inc.
When reviewing the projection prepared for the company, take note of the 
following key issues (which correspond to the topics discussed in this 
chapter):
	
✓	The most recent year-end financial information is included in the first 
column to provide a base reference point to work from. As noted in 
Chapter 8 on planning, gaining a thorough understanding of your com­
pany’s historical operating results is an important factor in forecasting 
the future. Also, by having this base information, a consistent reporting 
format can be developed so that the format of your financial statements 
is consistent with your projections (for ease of understanding).
	
✓	The projections are “complete” from a financial statement perspec­
tive. That is, the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of 
cash flows are all projected to assist management with understanding 
the entire financial picture of the company. The forecasts prepared 
for ACME Distribution, Inc., indicate that the line of credit will be used 
extensively through the third quarter, because between having to 
finance increases in trade accounts receivable and inventory levels (to 
support high seasonal sales levels in the third quarter) and reducing 
trade accounts payable levels, the company will need to ensure that its 
line of credit is large enough to handle the expected “cash demand” for 
the third quarter. By the end of the fourth quarter, borrowings on the 
line of credit are substantially lower because the balance sheet con­
tracts after the seasonal sales rush.
	
✓	The projections are presented with quarterly information. We nor­
mally recommend that projections for the next fiscal year be prepared 
on a monthly basis to provide management with more frequent informa­
tion. However, for ease of presentation (in this book), quarterly informa­
tion was prepared. If we continued, looking several years or more out, 
we would use annual projections because longer projections mean less 
precision. A good general rule of thumb to use is to prepare monthly 
projections for the next 12-month operating period, quarterly projec­
tions for the two years after the first 12-month operating period, and 
then annual projections thereafter.

 Chapter 9: Building Best-in-Class Projection Models to Manage Cash
	
✓	The projections are prepared and presented in a summary format. 
Instead of including a lot of detail, groups of detail are combined into 
one line item. For example, sales may originate from ten different com­
pany divisions or branches. Individual budgets are prepared to support 
each division or branch, but when a companywide forecast is com­
pleted, all the sales are rolled up onto one line item.
	
	Budgets prepared in a summary format are best suited for review by 
external parties and top company executives, who all tend to be big-pic­
ture people who want to first start with understanding the macro-level 
forecasts to complete a quick sanity check on whether they make sense 
or not. Furthermore, in revealing too much detail to external parties, 
you may risk disclosing confidential information that’s not appropriate 
for external consumption. And providing too much information to out­
side parties can sometimes result in the outside parties asking too many 
questions (so remember to KISS — keep it simple, stupid).
	
✓	Certain key or critical business economic drivers are highlighted in 
the projection model. First, the company’s gross margin is called out, 
because it increases from 22.5 percent in the first quarter to 28 percent 
in the third quarter. The increase was the result of the company increas­
ing prices in the second quarter and then accelerating the increases in 
the third quarter to capture higher anticipated demand from customers 
ramping up for the holidays. Second, the company’s pre-tax net income, 
for the entire year, improves significantly because the company’s 
fixed overhead and corporate infrastructure (expenses) didn’t need to 
increase nearly as much to support the higher sales (as a result of real­
izing the benefits of economies of scale). In addition, the company didn’t 
have to absorb an inventory write-off of $50,000 (as with the preceding 
year).
	
	You may ask why the company has no income tax expense forecast, 
despite having positive net pre-tax profits. In this example, ACME identi­
fied a deferred tax asset the previous year, which was of no value as of 
the end of that year. (We discuss this scenario in Chapter 5.) Because 
the company was able to generate a profit in the most recent year, the 
deferred tax asset now is anticipated to be of value, and any income tax 
expense anticipated can be offset against the deferred tax asset (produc­
ing a net income tax expense of zero for the year). For cash-flow plan­
ning purposes, this concept is very critical because the last thing you 
want to do is overpay income taxes, unnecessarily consuming cash.
The basic budget presented in Figure 9-1 is fairly simplistic but nevertheless 
very informative. It captures the macro-level economic structure of the com­
pany in terms of where it is today and where it expects to be at the end of 
next year.

 Chapter 9: Building Best-in-Class Projection Models to Manage Cash
Making the Most of Your Projections
The previous sections of this chapter focus on actually producing a business 
plan and corresponding projection as opposed to utilizing the projections as 
an active management tool. Just like any other piece of financial information 
generated from the company, the real key lies in management being able to 
understand the information and then act on it. Producing a plan and projec­
tion that are never fully utilized is simply a waste of everyone’s time. But with 
“Projection 101” under your belt, you can now turn your attention to working 
with more advanced forecasting techniques and concepts that can be utilized 
to achieve the plan.
The concepts presented in this section by no means require PhD-level think­
ing (like applying linear regression analysis to sales trends for the past 20 
years). Rather, the goal here is to provide some additional forecasting tools, 
techniques, and strategies that can assist you in managing your business 
interests. We aim to enlighten you with forecasting strategies that provide 
the greatest value to your organization in terms of managing everyday chal­
lenges, stress, and growing pains.
	
Developing and utilizing financial projections should not be viewed as just an 
annual management process/function. Instead, forecasts should be managed 
proactively and adjusted as needed to adapt to changing business conditions. 
Staying actively connected and involved in the business planning process 
(including utilizing financial forecasts) is essential to remaining competitive in 
today’s economic environment.
Getting familiar with some useful terms
Before we jump into an actual financial projection model, we review some 
basic terminology to help you “speak the language” (that is, accountant-ese 
or finance-ese) a little bit better. The following list is by no means all-inclu­
sive; it’s focused more on terminology that’s used when evaluating financial 
forecasts (based on forward-looking information) as opposed to terminology 
applied to evaluating periodic financial statements (for example, calculating 
the current ratio):
	
✓	Break-even: The break-even point is the level of sales required to pro­
duce operating results with no profits or losses (that is, sales less costs 
of sales less expenses equals zero). For example, if a company has 
$50,000 a month in expenses and generates a gross margin on sales of 40 
percent, it must generate $125,000 a month to break even. Or looking at 
the concept from the top down, sales of $125,000 would generate a gross 
profit of $50,000 (40 percent of $125,000), from which expenses are then 
subtracted, producing a profit of zero.

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
	
✓	Burn rate: The burn rate is the rate at which cash is burned or con­
sumed in a business. For example, if a company’s expenses are $100,000 
per month and sales are $40,000 per month, it is losing, or burning, 
$60,000 per month. If the company has $600,000 in cash, then it basically 
has ten months left to operate.
	
✓	Cap table: A cap table, or capitalization table, simply offers a summary of 
who owns what portion of a company and in what structure. Ownership 
structures are a very sensitive and important issue with third-party 
financing sources.
	
✓	Extending the runway: The idea of extending the runway means that if 
you’re forecasting your cash to run out in four months but a new source 
of cash won’t be available for six months, a company must find a way 
to stretch its cash to reach the next funding date. The idea is to always 
conserve your cash resources and stretch every dollar as far and as long 
as possible.
	
✓	Fume date: Closely related to the burn rate, the fume date simply esti­
mates what date a company will run out of cash and be left running on 
fumes (just like a car that’s running on empty and can only make it a 
little longer).
	
✓	Sustainable growth rate: A company’s sustainable growth rate is based 
on how quickly a company can grow with internal resources alone (that 
is, without securing external capital or cash to support future growth). 
This rate varies depending on the specific business and industry in 
which it operates, but when any company grows at rates in excess of 25 
percent, supporting this growth with internal resources alone is very 
difficult. Hence, a breach of the sustainable growth rate indicates that 
external capital is most likely needed to support the company.
	
✓	Dual bottom lines: A concept that’s becoming more and more important 
in today’s socially responsible environment is that companies often 
measure their results on multiple fronts, also called dual bottom lines. 
For example, in addition to measuring how much profit the company 
generated, a company’s results may also be measured on how much it 
returned to the community in terms of new jobs, charitable contribu­
tions, overall benefits to society, and so on.
	
	When building financial projection models, make sure that your output 
in the models supports all bottom-line objectives. Everyone expects the 
output from a financial projection model to identify how much profit 
will be produced, but generating output reports and information such 
as the number of jobs created, how healthcare costs may be lowered 
(for a healthcare information technology company), and so on are also 
very useful. To a politician who went out of her way to promote your 
business by offering tax breaks, relaying job creation does wonders for 
everyone involved.

 Chapter 9: Building Best-in-Class Projection Models to Manage Cash
Treating forecasts as living, breathing 
management tools
The concept of a living projection model is based in the idea that in today’s 
fiercely competitive marketplace, business models change much quicker 
than they did ten-plus years ago. Though the forecast prepared in the fourth 
quarter of the previous year looked reasonable, six months later the story 
can easily change. Any number of factors may occur, such as losing a key 
sales executive, having a competitor go out of business (opening up new 
opportunities), or experiencing a significant increase in the price of raw 
materials to produce your products, that can cause the best-prepared bud­
gets to be useless by midyear. But if you understand two key forecasting 
practices, you can make sure that your forecasts continue to live and breathe 
throughout the year.
Recasting to avoid surprises
When you hear the term recast used, it generally means a company is going 
to update its original budgets or forecasts during some point of the year to 
update or revise the information through the end of the year. Companies are 
constantly under pressure to provide updated information on how they think 
the year will turn out.
In this economic environment, basically everyone is demanding updated 
information, so at the end of select periods (usually a month end or quarter 
end), the actual results for the company through that period are incorpo­
rated into the original forecast. Using the actual results through the cutoff 
period as the base starting point, the original forecast for the remainder 
of the year is then updated (based on business conditions that may have 
changed), so the operating results for the entire year are a combination of 
actual results and updated projected results and thus have been recast. 
Having access to updated information can greatly assist business owners and 
managers in properly directing the company and adapting to changing condi­
tions, not to mention being able to provide timely updates to key external 
parties (on how the company is progressing).
Remember, nobody likes surprises (especially bad ones), and nothing will get 
an external party such as a bank or investor more fired up than management 
not being able to deliver information on the company’s performance.
Using rolling forecasts
Rolling forecasts are similar to recast financial results with the exception that 
a rolling forecast always looks out over a period of time (for example, the 
next 12 months) from the most recent period end, whereas a recast is simply 
updating the original forecast during the current year to provide a revised 
outlook or forecast for the remainder of the current fiscal year. For example, 
if a company has a fiscal year-end of 12/31/10 and has prepared a projection 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
184
Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
for the fiscal year-end 12/31/11, an updated rolling 12-month forecast may be 
prepared for the period of 4/1/11 through 3/31/12 when the financial results 
are known for the first quarter ending 3/31/11. This way, management always 
has 12 months of projections available to work with.
Rolling forecasts tend to be utilized in companies operating in highly fluid 
or uncertain times that need to always look ahead a certain amount of time. 
However, more and more companies are utilizing rolling forecasts to better 
prepare for future uncertainties.
Understanding the difference between 
internal versus external projections
Businesses produce financial information for use by internal management 
and for external parties. Some businesses overlook the different needs of 
internal and external groups, and the company accountant may prepare 
financial statements from the internal accounting system and simply forward 
the same information to outside parties. Our thought about that approach is, 
to use the famous line from Apollo 13, “Houston, we have a problem.”
The problem is that the information that’s prepared for and delivered to 
external users (such as a financing source, taxing authorities, or company 
creditors) should not be the same as what’s prepared for and utilized inter­
nally in the company. This is not to say that the information for external par­
ties should be fabricated, misleading, or incorrect. The core information is 
still the same, but it’s “conditioned” or formatted for delivery to the various 
parties in the most informative manner possible.
The following examples explain how a business can utilize the same informa­
tion for different objectives:
	
✓	Sales-driven versus accounting-driven budgets: Companies often have 
more than one set of projections completed and used for different pur­
poses. To date, we have yet to see a budget prepared based on sales and 
marketing information that is more conservative than a similar budget 
prepared based from operations or accounting information. By nature, 
sales and marketing personnel tend to be far more optimistic about the 
opportunities present than other segments of the business (which of 
course includes the ultraconservative accountants).
	
	Rather than attempt to have these two groups battle it out over what fore­
cast model is the most accurate, some businesses simply prepare two sets 
of projections. The marketing and sales–based projection can be used as a 
management and motivational tool, whereas a more-conservative projec­
tion can be used for delivery to external financing sources (thus ensuring 
“reasonable” expectations so the company isn’t under enormous pressure 
to hit aggressive plans). Granted, this strategy has to be properly managed

 Chapter 9: Building Best-in-Class Projection Models to Manage Cash
(and kept in balance), because one forecast shouldn’t be drastically differ­
ent from another. You don’t want to have to defend management’s integrity 
by explaining to external parties who happen to get their hands on both 
why the forecasts have a large difference.
	
✓	Drilling down into the detail: Information delivered to external parties 
should contain far less detail than what is utilized internally by man­
agement on a daily basis. This concept, of course, holds true for the 
forecasting process as well. The level and amount of detail at the base 
of the projection model often drills down to the core elements of your 
business. For example, the summary projection in Figure 9-1 displays 
corporate overhead expenses as one line item. This one line item can, in 
fact, be the summation of over 100 lines of data (or more) and capture 
everything from the cost of personnel in the accounting department to 
the current year’s advertising budget. An outside party doesn’t need 
(nor want) to see that level of detail because it tends to only confuse 
matters and lead to unnecessary questions.
	
	However, by being able to drill down into the detail at any given time 
by using the internal information, you can kill two birds with one stone. 
Internally, you have the necessary detail to hold management team 
members responsible for expense and cost control. Externally, if needed 
you can provide real support for financial information presented in the 
budget, strengthening your credibility and giving your partners confi­
dence that the business is being tightly managed.
	
Preparing and presenting different information internally and externally 
applies to a business’s planning and projection documentation just like other 
critical operational and financial reporting. In this day and age of management 
transparency and accountability, you don’t want to be left holding the bag on 
unkept forecasting promises made to external parties (especially investors 
thinking that they have the next Facebook on their hands). The summarized, 
final results aren’t different, but rather the structure and level of detail you 
provide to different parties should be formatted accordingly.
Preparing multiple projection scenarios: 
The what-if analysis
A what-if analysis is just what it sounds like. That is, you consider what the 
impact on your business or the market will be if a particular something hap­
pens. For example, “If I can land this new account, what additional costs 
will I need to incur, and when, to support the account?” Utilizing the what-if 
projection technique is a highly effective business management strategy that 
can be applied to all levels of the forecasting process, from a single division 
to the company as a whole. Figure 9-2 presents the original forecast of ACME 
Distribution, Inc., from Figure 9-1 (the expected case) alongside two other sce­
narios, one of which is a worst-case scenario and the other a best-case scenario.

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
By having the ability to complete what-if projections, ACME provides itself 
with a better understanding of what business decisions need to be made in 
case different operating scenarios are realized.
	
Investing the time and effort into developing a projection model that’s very 
flexible and adaptable and can easily incorporate changes to critical economic 
assumptions is invaluable. If you properly identify, manage, and incorporate 
critical economic drivers into the planning process, your company can quickly 
prepare and evaluate different operating scenarios with limited effort.
Low, medium, and high forecasting
A very worthwhile and valuable exercise to undertake each year is to prepare 
a complete set of projections by using a classic forecasting strategy referred 
to as low, medium, and high (or worst, expected, and best cases):
	
✓	The low forecast scenario is based on somewhat of a worst-case or 
reduced-expectation operating scenario.
	
✓	The medium case is based on a very comfortable and achievable operat­
ing scenario.
	
✓	The high case is based on an operating scenario that’s basically best 
case, in which a number of events, transactions, and so on have to go 
right to hit the projection goals.
No set rules dictate what ranges should be use to determine the difference 
between the three operating scenarios. A good rule of thumb is that when 
a scenario triggers a ±20 percent change in critical operating results (such 
as revenue or net profit levels), a unique projection and operating scenario 
has been achieved that generally produces results that require a material 
or significant management adjustment to be undertaken. As highlighted 
in Figure 9-2, dramatic differences in the company’s pre-tax profit occur 
between the different operating scenarios, which may lead management 
to develop a contingency plan in the worst case (to cut expenses or reduce 
personnel) to creating an added bonus plan if the best case is realized.
Arm forecasting
One additional scenario we often recommend that companies develop is the 
Arm version. Arm is short for Armageddon, and this scenario is basically 
when all hell breaks loose (as a number of companies experienced in 2008 
and 2009 during the Great Recession). The point of the Arm version is to 
always have it available for disaster planning purposes in the event unfore­
seen “shocks” to the business operating model are realized (so that actions 
plans can be enacted to protect your business interests). Although you may 
never have to experience an Arm environment, the Great Recession and the 
devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011 underscore just how 
invaluable these types of plans can be.

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
Integrating forecasts into the active 
management of your business
Thus far in this section of the chapter, we focus on making the most of finan­
cial forecasts from a forward-looking perspective as opposed to actively 
using forecasts on a periodic operating basis (with actual operating results). 
So we now turn our attention to incorporating projections with the active 
periodic management of a business by exploring three additional concepts: 
the variance analysis, operating plan implementation, and management dis­
cussion and analyses.
The variance analysis
An important step in integrating forecasts into operations is taking a look at 
the projection and comparing it to actual results for a period of time. This 
concept, called a variance analysis, is shown for ACME Distribution, Inc., in 
Figure 9-3. It presents a report that compares the budgeted results for the 
quarter against the company’s actual results.
With a quick glance at the company’s profitability, you could easily draw 
the conclusion that the company performed right in line with management’s 
expectations, as the actual net loss of $100,100 is consistent with the fore­
cast net loss of $98,125. But on further review, two problems appear. First, 
the company generated $1.585 million of revenue in the quarter compared 
to a forecast revenue level of $1.450 million. Yet when the company’s gross 
margin is analyzed, the actual gross margin of 20.19 percent is well below the 
forecast gross margin of 22.50 percent. So all that effort to increase sales did 
not produce any improvement in gross profits earned. Obviously, manage­
ment needs to understand what caused the gross margin to decrease (was it 
from lower sales prices, higher product costs, or a different product 
sales mix?).
The second issue is the fact that the company’s trade accounts receivable 
balance was forecasted to reach $725,000 but actually amounted to $815,000, 
or $90,000 higher than expected. This difference appears to make sense in 
light of the increased revenue level, because higher sales generally translate 
into higher trade accounts receivable balances. But the issue to note is that 
the company had to borrow another $100,000 from the line of credit (fore­
cast borrowings of $350,000 compared to actual borrowings of $450,000) to 
finance the increase in trade receivables (coming from higher sales), which 
adds interest expense and increases the leverage of the company.
Of critical importance, however, is that management needs to act on the 
information. If the market is looking for lower prices in general, then the 
company may want to revisit pricing strategies for the second through fourth 
quarters to take advantage of conditions that may allow it to improve the 
company’s annual financial performance.

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
	
Budgets, financial statements, variance analyses, and other prepared state­
ments are pointless if management is not prepared to respond to the informa­
tion they provide.
Operating plan implementation
Beyond the variance report, another obvious use of the forecasts is to sup­
port the implementation of specific plans and action steps. For example, if 
a new production distribution facility is set to open in the third quarter of 
the year, then the staff to support this facility will need to be secured in the 
middle of the second quarter and then trained to ensure that they are ready 
when the new facility opens. The original budget for the new facility should 
also have accumulated and incorporated that info, but the idea is to turn the 
budget into a proactive working document (easily accessible for reference) 
rather than a onetime effort left on the shelf to die.
Management discussions and analyses
The budget plays an important part in helping businesses prepare a financial 
document that most companies ignore (either intentionally or out of igno­
rance): the MDOR (management discussion of operating results), or MDA (man­
agement discussion and analysis).
MDOR and MDA are essentially the same document and serve the same pur­
pose, which is to provide a written narrative of how the company is perform­
ing. These documents translate financial information, results, and numbers 
into written words, strategies, plans, and events. Though this type of docu­
mentation sounds relative easy to complete, the MDOR and MDA can be very 
difficult to prepare because the translation process can be very difficult.
At the base of the MDOR and MDA, when explaining actual results versus 
planned, is a well-developed budget that provides a clear road map to under­
standing operating result variances. You may wonder why a business would 
bother putting together these difficult documents if they simply summarize 
information available elsewhere. We recommend them for the following two 
critical reasons:
	
✓	If you present financial information without explaining it, readers 
(whether internal or external) often come to their own conclusions 
about why the company is performing a certain way. More times than 
not, their conclusions are incorrect, which may lead to adverse deci­
sions that negatively impact your business. Remember, assumptions are 
the mother of all you-know-whats, so the more you can do to eliminate 
assumptions from being made, the better.

 Chapter 9: Building Best-in-Class Projection Models to Manage Cash
	
✓	By being able to clearly relay your company’s financial results, key par­
ties (whether internal or external) will gain more confidence in your 
management abilities, which gives your business more creditability. 
This may not sound like much payoff for the work, but believe us when 
we tell you that management integrity and creditability have saved more 
than a few businesses. For financing sources, credit decisions are easy 
and tend to be based on the financial information. But when a business 
decision needs to be made, management integrity and creditability rise 
to the surface.
Broadening the use of projections 
even further
When preparing projections, you must remember that the base data and 
information accumulated (to prepare the budget) can be used to support 
other business planning and management functions as well. For example, 
a well-developed budget can be used not only to prepare forecast financial 
statements but, in addition, to prepare the estimated taxable income or loss 
of a company. For some companies, the difference between book and tax 
income is small. However for others, the difference can be significant and 
must be anticipated, as the following real world example demonstrates.
	
A large provider of personnel services elected to implement a strategy to self-
fund their workers’ compensation insurance costs. The preliminary analysis 
indicated that an average annual savings of 30 percent or more could be 
achieved if properly managed. At the end of the third year of the self-funded 
workers’ compensation insurance program, the company had established 
an accrued liability for over $1 million to account for potential future claims. 
(That is, workers’ compensation insurance claims for injuries sustained on the 
job, which required subsequent payments to be made over a period of time). 
In total, the claims amounted to $1.2 million, of which $200,000 was paid by 
the end of the year and the expected additional payouts required for medi­
cal services, lost wages, and other damages amounted to another $1 million. 
For book purposes, the $1 million represented an expense recorded in the 
financial statements, which resulted in the company producing net income of 
roughly zero dollars. For tax purposes, the IRS would not allow the expense 
until the claims were actually paid, so the taxable income of the company was 
$1 million (resulting in a tax liability of $400,000). If the company did not prop­
erly budget for this business event, it might have been in for a rude surprise, 
as per the books the company made nothing yet owed $400,000 in taxes. You 
can be assured that this is not the type of surprise an executive wants to expe­
rience on short notice.

The budget can be used for other purposes as well, ranging from preparing 
information for specialized needs from external parties (such as governmental 
agencies that require information to be prepared in a specific format) to train­
ing a new division manager on the basic economics of how his division should 
perform. The better the forecasts are designed and structured from the begin­
ning, the more uses and value they provide your business down the road.

O

ver the past 100 years, the face of the United States has been shaped by 
waves of industrial visionaries, technology giants, and innovative entre­
preneurs who were in the right place at the right time. From Ford, Carnegie, 
Mellon, and Vanderbilt to Hewlett Packard, IBM, Google, and Facebook, the 
most prosperous companies have certain characteristics in common. The 
ultimate success of companies is based in a combination of the ability to 
secure all the essential ingredients needed to build a business (including 
leadership, vision, talent, planning, determination, and more) at the most 
opportune time, with a little luck, combined with the all-important element 
of securing the proper amount and type of capital (cash) to support the busi­
ness concept.
Whether big or small, public or private, foreign or domestic, or 1 month new 
or 20 years old, securing and managing capital resources represents the 
lifeline of any company looking to operate in today’s challenging economic 
climate. In this chapter you get a quick look at why capital is so important 
before delving into the details of one of the two types of capital, equity. We 
explain how equity works, what sources are available, and how you can go 
about securing them. And to make sure that your newly acquired capital 
works hard for you, we discuss how capital should be used and what you 
should know about the capital markets.

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
Getting a Grip on the Capital Concept
	
Securing capital for a company represents one of the most painstaking and 
time-consuming efforts a business undertakes. Getting a party interested in 
providing capital to your organization is one thing; actually receiving the com­
mitment and securing the capital is an entirely different thing. Securing capital 
represents a full-time job requiring the undivided attention of a company’s 
senior management team and ultimately the CEO, because that’s where the 
buck stops.
Countless technical and/or theoretical definitions are available (to peruse at 
your leisure) on what capital actually is, but to keep it simple, when manag­
ing a business opportunity, you really only need to consider one expression 
to understand the real essence of capital: It takes money to make money. 
Launching any new business concept, from the aspiring entrepreneur design­
ing a new software product from his home office to an executive of a multi­
national corporation looking to expand foreign distribution channels for new 
product introductions, requires capital (cash, money, greenbacks, or what­
ever you like to call it) as a basis to execute the business plan.
	
One of the most common reasons cited as to why businesses fail is a lack of 
capital, or inappropriately structured capital (to support the needs of the 
business). This problem not only applies to the more easily understandable 
business environment when continued losses consume all of a company’s 
cash, but it also applies (maybe more importantly) when a company grows 
too fast and doesn’t have enough capital or cash to support its growth. 
Companies can literally grow themselves right out of business if the growth 
isn’t properly planned for and managed.
Business capital can basically be classified into one of two primary types: 
debt (loans that must be repaid), or equity (investments that should gener­
ate a return). This chapter explores some of the ways you can raise capital 
through equity. When these opportunities are paired with debt capital, avail­
able from banks and other lenders (and more fully overviewed in Chapter 
11), a savvy and well-informed accountant can find plenty of potential 
sources to raise cash.
Deciding what form of capital, debt or equity, is most suitable for your com­
pany really depends on the company’s stage in terms of its operating history, 
industry profile, profitability levels, asset structure, future growth prospects, 
and general capital requirements, all considered in relation to where the 
sources of capital lie. After exploring potential sources of capital in this chap­
ter (on equity) and Chapter 11 (on debt), analyzing your company’s financial 
condition in Chapter 7, and considering future requirements in Chapters 8 
and 9, you’ll be ready to answer this question and (hopefully) secure your 
financial future.

 Chapter 10: Identifying and Securing External Sources of Capital
	
Keep in mind that capital should not be perceived as just the amount of cash 
on hand but rather the amount of financial resources available to support the 
execution of a business plan. This point is clearly illustrated throughout this 
chapter’s discussion of raising/securing capital.
Understanding the Basics 
of Equity Capital
Equity-based capital is money provided to a company in the form of an 
investment in the business, which is looking for the generation of a return 
(such as a dividend being paid on stock you might own). This capital doesn’t 
have set repayment terms but does have a right to future earnings. Unlike 
debt, equity investors may be provided dividends or distributions if profits 
and cash flows are available. For example, a software technology company 
requires approximately $2 million in capital to develop and launch a new 
Internet-based software solution. A niche venture capitalist group invests the 
required capital under the terms and conditions present in the equity offer­
ing, including what their percentage ownership in company will be, rights to 
future earnings, representation on the board of directors, preferred versus 
common equity status, conversion rights, antidilution provisions, and so 
on. Under this scenario, the company receiving the equity is not required to 
remit any payments to the capital source per a set repayment agreement, but 
it has given up a partial right to ownership (which can be even more costly).
Equity is best evaluated by understanding its two most important character­
istics: preference and management influence.
Equity preference
Preference refers to the fact that certain types of equity have priority over 
other types in collecting earnings and, if needed, company assets. For 
example, a Series A preferred stock may be issued to investors that have an 
interest in making an equity investment but want to protect or prioritize their 
investments in relation to the common shareholders or another series of pre­
ferred stock. A Series B preferred stock may hold a lower preference to the 
Series A preferred stock in terms of asset liquidations but may have a slightly 
higher dividend yield attached or offered with a warrant that allows it to pur­
chase common shares at a later date at a favorable price.
Actually, the features built into preferred stock are almost endless and can 
create a large number of different types of preferred stock (A through Z). 
For common equity, so too can preferences exist. Common stock Type A 
may have full voting rights and dividends (after the preferred shareholders 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
196
Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
receive their dividend), whereas a common stock Type B may only have 
rights to dividends and not voting. To list all the potential preferences and/or 
features built into equity instruments (including the ability to convert, antidi­
lution provisions, cumulative versus noncumulative dividends, voting rights, 
acceleration clauses, liquidation criteria, and more) is well beyond the scope 
of this book.
	
The key point in understanding equity preferences is that equity investors 
attempt to secure as many preferences and features that protect their inter­
ests as possible. Though this strategy may be good for them, it may not be in 
the best interests of the company, and it may restrict the company’s ability to 
operate farther down the road.
Equity and management influence
The concept of management influence is centered in the fact that when 
equity capital is raised, the provider of the capital is considered an owner 
or shareowner of the company. By its very nature, this involvement entitles 
the shareowner to have a say in the company’s operations (unless otherwise 
restricted) with the ability to vote with the board of directors and on other 
critical matters (for example, on approving the company’s external auditor or 
allocating equity to be distributed to company management). This manage­
ment influence can be extended significantly when preferences are factored 
into the equation.
In the end, the old adage of “Money talks and you-know-what walks” really 
applies in today’s economic environment as it relates to management influ­
ence. When investors with big money come to the show, they tend to have 
a significant influence on not only the composition of a company’s board of 
directors but even on the actual management team running the business daily.
	
If you remember only one thing when raising equity capital, it should be this: 
Be prepared to co-manage the business with your new best friends — the 
equity investors — because for the business to run smoothly and efficiently, 
your dictatorship must give way to a democracy.
Starting to Look for Capital
In the movie Jerry Maguire, Cuba Gooding Jr. utters the now-somewhat-
infamous line, “Show me the money.” These four words sum up the capital-
raising process as well as any, because until you have the money in hand, 
a business concept is really nothing more than the paper the business plan 
is written on. And as author Tage’s dad (who is in fact the coauthor of this 
book) has always told him, that and one dollar should get you a cup of coffee.

 Chapter 10: Identifying and Securing External Sources of Capital
To make that business plan worth something, you need to look at the poten­
tial sources of capital available to launch your new business, open a new 
product/service niche within a corporate conglomerate, or acquire a pesky 
competitor. The sources listed in this section are by no means all-inclusive, 
but they provide an overview of the variety of avenues available to raise capi­
tal and the pluses and minuses associated with each one.
Looking in the mirror
First up, the business founders need to look no farther than themselves to 
secure initial capital to launch or support a company. Their assistance may 
range from tapping their own savings to selling personal assets and holdings 
(to raise cash) to leveraging their creditworthiness with debt such as home 
equity loans, credit cards, and/or other sources. The bottom line is that just 
about every business venture starts with some type of initial capital or cash 
contribution being made by the founders.
Providing this preliminary (seed) capital is critical for two reasons. First, and 
most obviously, the new business venture needs cash to launch its opera­
tions, including covering the costs to legally form the company, supporting 
the initial operating expenses and payroll, and so on. Second, and just as 
important, most external capital sources want to see that the founders have 
actually invested some of their own hard-earned cash and effort into the busi­
ness. If you haven’t stepped up with the capital needed to launch a business, 
your lack of financial participation may raise a question about your real com­
mitment to the business.
	
Retirement accounts, including 401(k)s, company-sponsored profit-sharing 
plans, IRAs, SEPs, and the like, are often considered as a source of cash by 
individuals when starting a business. Though tempting, a complete and full 
understanding of the risks and added costs associated with using these funds 
should be considered. For instance, significant additional tax burdens may 
arise from using these funds if not properly planned for and managed. And 
don’t forget that this is your retirement money, so it should go without saying 
that tapping this capital source should be done with the utmost caution.
	
Sweat equity is the amount of time, effort, and energy an individual invests 
in a company in lieu of actual cash contributions. For example, if you work 
for free during the first year the business is formed but have a market worth 
of $100,000 in annual compensation, then that amount is considered sweat 
equity. Most likely, external capital sources are not going to assign significant 
value to this component, but it’s a very important number to calculate and 
quantify when negotiating equity investments.

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
Turning to family, friends, and 
close business associates
Family, friends, and close business associates (or FF&CBAs) have been one of 
the primary capital sources to launch new business concepts since the begin­
ning of time and will most likely continue to fill this role in the future. The 
involvement of FF&CBAs ranges from the founders of a business having mom 
and dad offer up the initial ante to a trusted business associate stepping in 
with the needed seed money to launch the company.
Generally, this type of capital tends to be for low dollar amounts, be geared 
toward equity as opposed to debt (given the uncertain nature of the business 
and higher risks present in terms of generating cash flow), and be provided 
to closely held and/or family operated businesses. However, debt can be 
effectively utilized with more mature businesses generating solid profitability 
with some type of security present (such as real estate).
The good news is that raising capital from FF&CBAs can often be completed 
quickly and without a significant amount of legal paperwork and/or similar 
investor creditability issues. The bad news is threefold:
	
✓	The amount of capital available from these sources is often restricted. 
Pulling together a couple of hundred thousand dollars is one thing, but 
when a business concept needs a million or two, not too many FF&CBAs 
have this type of liquidity available (unless maybe your last name is 
DuPont, Getty, Gates, or Buffett).
	
✓	The recent economic turmoil experienced in the United States from 2008 
through 2010 has made this source of capital more difficult to access 
because personal wealth has eroded via decreasing real estate values, 
reductions in savings/investment values, and lost employment income, 
and many people are very nervous about protecting their nest egg. And 
given that traditional sources of capital (like from banks) have become 
scarce, many people among your FF&CBA may want to conserve cash 
for their own business interests.
	
✓	Having unsophisticated FF&CBAs provide capital to a business carries 
unforeseen risks and volatile emotional elements. Reporting back to 
a seasoned investor that a business concept didn’t work and that his 
investment is worthless may not be the most pleasant task in the world, 
but at least the investor was aware of the risks. Telling your aunt and 
uncle that you’ve just blown through their nest egg may get your name 
replaced with something nasty when spoken at subsequent family gath­
erings. The costs of losing a family member’s investment can be much 
greater than the actual amount of capital invested.

 Chapter 10: Identifying and Securing External Sources of Capital
	
Be very wary of FF&CBA capital sources and the subjective costs that are 
often attached. Only FF&CBA sources who clearly understand the investment 
process and business in general, as well as can afford the potential loss, 
should be approached and evaluated as capital sources. Nothing is worse than 
having a business fail and then watching the family disintegrate as a result of 
the failed business.
Seeking Equity Sources of Capital
When your business has reached a point where external equity is needed to 
support its growth, a large number of private capital sources are available 
and generally fall into one of the four following primary sources: angel inves­
tors, venture capitalists, private equity groups, and other private investment 
groups.
These sources of private capital come in a variety shapes, sizes, and forms, 
but all tend to gravitate toward a common set of criteria:
	
✓	The dollar size of the capital commitment is generally larger than with 
FF&CBAs. These groups are comprised of highly trained and sophisti­
cated professionals responsible for managing large pools of capital and, 
as such, frequently apply the concept of economy of scale (that is, they 
will spend the same amount of time and energy on evaluating an oppor­
tunity that needs $1 million of equity funding versus an opportunity that 
needs $10 million of equity money, with the latter providing a greater 
chance of turning into a much bigger and more valuable business).
	
✓	These groups tend to be more risk-based capital sources and look 
for higher returns from equity-driven transactions (as well as expect 
additional involvement in the management of the business, usually at 
the board level). These groups are comfortable making equity invest­
ments in relatively early-stage businesses without proven profitability 
(but with significant potential) or structuring risk-based debt facilities 
to support a higher-risk business opportunity (for example, the debt is 
secured by nothing more than goodwill). Just remember, higher invest­
ment returns will be expected for taking on the added risk.
	
✓	These groups are generally not looking to invest in a company with a 
revenue potential in the ballpark of only $5 million after five years (such 
as regionally based construction subcontracting company). With the 
types of capital these groups have available, the business opportunity 
must be relatively grand to pique their interest. Though you don’t need 
to be the next Microsoft, you do need to provide a solid opportunity to 
produce in excess of $50 million in annual revenue (over a reasonable 
time), generate solid profits, and have an efficient exit strategy.

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
So the good news with private capital is that larger capital amounts are avail­
able, the groups are generally very sophisticated and can provide invaluable 
management support, and the capital is often equity based so that aspiring 
businesses in needs of large capital infusions have a resource. The bad news 
is that these groups tend to ask for (and receive) a higher ownership stake in 
the business and thus can exert a significant amount of management control 
and influence. In addition, these groups retain highly trained professionals 
who are very demanding when undertaking their due diligence.
	
Due diligence is the process by which a capital source evaluates, examines, 
tests, audits, and otherwise reviews the business information being provided 
from a company looking to secure capital. Or in other words, and for lack of a 
better comparison, due diligence is basically the equivalent of your business 
receiving a colonoscopy.
In the following sections, the ordering of these private capital sources is 
presented from most willing to assume and accept risk to least willing (with 
angel investors often taking on more risk and more-immature business oppor­
tunities and private equity groups looking for lower risk and more-mature 
business opportunities).
Angel investors
Angel investors typically are high-net-worth individuals that have ample finan­
cial resources to invest in new ventures. In addition, based on their past expe­
riences or own curiosity, angel investors tend to have a strong interest in the 
business concept, product, technology, or service of the company seeking 
capital, and they’re not afraid to invest in a business at more of a “conceptual” 
stage (that is, the early stage or before revenue is generated). Angel investment 
groups come in all shapes, sizes, and forms ranging from geographically based 
(for instance, a group of high-net-worth individuals who all live in the same 
city) to interest based (experts with a specific investment interest brought 
together virtually from around the globe). Capital availability from angel 
investors, however, tends to be lower than other private capital sources, with 
investment levels often in the six-figure to low-seven-figure range.
	
The very important term accredited investor (as defined by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, or SEC) basically represents an individual who has 
the appropriate financial strength and business acumen to understand the 
risks of the investment and bear the brunt of any potential economic loss. 
The SEC has established a very clear set of tests and criteria to qualify inves­
tors as accredited, and you should follow these criteria when pursuing angel 
investors. The reason for this diligence is simple: If you raise capital from 
nonqualified parties, the risk of legal action against the owners of the business 
increases, especially if an investor complains. Trust us when we say that the 
last thing anyone wants to deal with is the combination of the capital source, 
the source’s attorneys, and the SEC all pounding on the company at once.

 Chapter 10: Identifying and Securing External Sources of Capital
Venture capitalists (VCs)
Next up in the risk-appetite order are venture capitalists, or VCs. VCs, similar 
to angel investors, come in groups of varying size and form but are generally 
aligned along a specific industry expertise or interest. For example, certain 
VCs have a strong interest and knowledge in the biotech industry, whereas 
others specialize in social media or green/clean energy.
Capital availability from VCs tends to come in much larger increments, with 
most VCs looking for investment minimums of $5 million (although some will 
go lower, depending on your industry and region). In addition to having funds 
to invest, VCs generally have other significant resources at their disposal, 
including decades of combined business management experience, in-depth 
industry knowledge, and well-developed contacts and business relationships. 
However, this level of funding and support carry with them higher levels of 
management involvement and much tighter due-diligence efforts.
Note: The V (or venture part of the name) in VC has become noticeably scarcer 
over the past decade, particularly since 2007. VCs are tending to hedge their 
risk and are looking for later-stage opportunities with proven management 
teams and solid revenue traction that are in need of working capital to support 
growth rather than innovate new products, technologies, or concepts. The 
days of VCs funding two guys in a garage with an idea are long gone.
	
VCs have significant resources at their disposal with professionals and experts 
available to address any issue, question, or concern that may arise. If your 
business isn’t properly prepared to undertake the rigors of a detailed VC 
examination, then don’t. If your presentation or pitch for capital fails, a VC is 
unlikely to give you a second chance.
Private equity groups (PEGs)
Private equity groups or (PEGs) offer sources of capital in a similar strategy 
to VCs in that they look for specific industries that they possess an expertise 
within. Capital availability from PEGs covers a wide range, with lower limits in 
the $5 to $10 million range and upper limits well into the hundreds of millions 
of dollars.
PEGs operate in just about every type of industry you can think of and tend 
to look for slightly different opportunities than VCs. Whereas a VC looks to 
invest in a newer concept with significant growth potential, a PEG tends to 
be more focused on mature businesses that have untapped potential that the 
PEG can help unlock. For example, a large regional distribution company may 
have reached its operating limit as a result of outgrowing the management 
team’s capabilities and capital resources available. A PEG may recognize that 
by consolidating this operation with others, the combined operation (on a 
national or even global scale) can expand more efficiently and leverage all 
the acquired resources into a very large and highly profitable company.

202
Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
PEGs can be attracted to untapped potential in financially sound businesses 
just as often as in troubled, financially weak, and/or poorly managed compa­
nies. PEGs may be able to unlock the economic value of many kinds of busi­
nesses just by bringing in new management and providing adequate capital.
	
Be very careful with how the E (or equity part of the name) in PEG is created. 
PEGs often use both equity and debt when structuring their deals in an effort 
to utilize the internal cash flow of a company to service the debt. As we note 
in Chapter 11, debt cuts both ways: It can greatly enhance an investment’s 
return, but the added leverage can also increase the operating risk of the busi­
ness. So though E was plentiful in the PEGs from 2003 through 2007 (when the 
economy was expanding), a number of PEGs experienced a very quick evapo­
ration of E when the economy turned south in 2008.
	
Similar to VCs, PEGs have significant resources at their disposal with profes­
sionals and experts available to address any issue, question, or concern that 
may arise. So like a good Boy Scout, be prepared when working with PEGs.
Other private investment groups
In the United States, capital formation and deployment can be achieved rela­
tively quickly and efficiently. When a new market opportunity presents itself, 
capital will find a way to exploit it (as long as the investment returns are 
appropriate). A case in point is how capital is moving to take advantage of 
the economic turmoil realized from 2008 through 2010. A variety of new pri­
vate investment groups that can best be described as having a cross section 
of characteristics from VCs, PEGs, and lending sources have been formed to 
pursue opportunities in specific industries. For lack of a better term, I refer to 
these private investment groups as pirate funds, because they tend to look for 
promising but distressed situations and provide debt- and equity-based capi­
tal (with limited management support or involvement).
	
But although capital markets can form and deploy funding quickly, these 
types of investment groups also need to be approached with an added level 
of caution, because they tend to be very expensive when all their fees, costs, 
requirements, and demands are considered. This isn’t to say that these 
groups are just looking to exploit the situation. A number of the groups are 
very well structured and provide invaluable resources. But understanding 
why these groups demand higher returns (in relation to the risks they take) 
and when they should be used is important.
For example, a business may need to secure $1 million of longer-term capital 
to execute a turnaround, pay off some pesky secured creditors (such as a 
bank), and provide working capital to cover short-term losses. A pirate fund 
may step in and provide this financing in the form of lower-priority debt 
at a relatively high interest rate, but which also carries an equity kicker to 
sweeten the deal and improve the investment return.

 Chapter 10: Identifying and Securing External Sources of Capital
	
An equity kicker, a right or grant provided to a third party (providing higher-
risk debt to a business) in the form of future upside earnings that may be real­
ized from improved cash flows, the sale of a business, or the like, is usually 
provided to a third party as a way of improving the potential return on an 
investment in recognition of increased risks being taken. Taking the above 
example, if an investment group provides a $1 million loan to a business 
against inferior collateral (like intangible assets, such as goodwill, or intellec­
tual property, such as patents or trade names), an interest rate in the mid to 
high teens (16 percent) should be expected along with a warrant attached to 
purchase 10 percent of the company at a very low price. So not only does the 
source providing the $1 million of capital earn 16 percent on the loan, but if 
the company is successful in executing its business plan and sells down the 
road for a handsome price, the investment group then also has an opportunity 
to participate in the increased value of the business. Numerous types of equity 
kickers are used, but the objective remains the same — to enhance an invest­
ment return in a high-risk transaction.
In terms of capital availability, these types of private investment groups have 
a significant bandwidth in deal size, which may range from as low as $500,000 
to $1 million to the hundreds of millions of dollars. It just depends on the size 
of the investment fund and industry specialty.
Accessing Public Sources of Capital
Almost every business owner, professional, and manager is aware of the 
public markets for trading stocks and bonds, including the New York Stock 
Exchange, NASDAQ, and similar venues (that is, Wall Street). Instruments of 
both equity (such as the common stock of Microsoft) and debt (like United 
States Treasury Bills) are actively traded in these open markets. Though the 
allure of the public markets is very appealing to business owners and often is 
viewed as the end game (“I took my company public and now am worth X mil­
lion dollars”), the reality of operating in a public market can be very different. 
As such, public capital sources have developed a unique set of qualifications 
in terms of making it the most appropriate capital source to pursue.
	
✓	Think big. Public markets are better suited for companies thinking in 
hundreds of millions or billions than in millions.
	
✓	Think public. Basically, all your company’s information, financial 
records, activities, and so on will be available for public viewing. You 
must not only be prepared to disclose the information, but also make 
sure that the disclosure is prepared in the proper format.
	
✓	Understand risk. Are the returns and rewards for being public adequate 
in relation to the risks you and your business assume?

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
Public capital market’s positive attributes include having access to extremely 
large capital levels that can tap the widest range of sources available 
(stretching the globe). As the national debt of the United States clearly dis­
plays, no deal is too big for public markets. The liquidity that public markets 
offer (allowing investments to be efficiently bought, sold, and traded), the 
ability to establish fair-market values almost instantaneously, and access to 
both debt and equity sources are also positive attributes.
But as everyone knows, no capital source is perfect, so there must be a 
downside to public capital as well:
	
✓	Cost: Staying in compliance with all the public reporting requirements 
can be extremely expensive and only continues to increase as investors 
demand more disclosures and the government looks to protect inves­
tors further (for example, with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2003).
	
✓	Management exposure: Even when fraud isn’t present, investors in 
public debt and equity instruments can turn into a company’s worst 
nightmare when things aren’t going as planned. The additional burden 
placed on the management team can be extensive and distract the com­
pany from actually running its business.
	
✓	Misconception about liquidity: Just because your company is publicly 
traded doesn’t mean that it has liquidity. Stocks of smaller companies 
(with less than $100 million of market capitalization) are often not 
actively traded on the open market, which can make selling or buying 
a large block of stock more difficult (not to mention the scrutiny the 
company insiders, original founders, large equity owners, management, 
board members, officers, and similar parties receive when undertaking 
these transactions).
	
This discussion on public markets is fairly short, but the topic of accessing 
public capital markets could fill a book by itself. However, the long and short 
of public markets is fairly straightforward: Though plenty of small companies 
are publicly traded, public markets are generally best suited for the big boys 
of corporate America.
Putting Your Capital to Good Use
Raising or securing capital is without question one of the most difficult and 
time-consuming tasks the senior management team of a company undertakes. 
Preparing, packaging, marketing, negotiating, and closing the deal can easily 
consume 80 to 100 percent of an executive’s time, depending on the stage of 
the company. For a start-up operation, chief executive officers (CEOs) and 
other senior executives often find themselves closing on one round of

 Chapter 10: Identifying and Securing External Sources of Capital
financing, resting for a day or two, and then starting the process all over 
again, looking for the next financing source. For chief financial officers (CFOs) 
of publicly traded companies, the majority of their time may be consumed in 
preparing information for the capital sources and markets and then managing 
the capital sources expectations, inquiries, and/or other needs. To a certain 
degree, managing the capital sources after the capital is secured can be even 
more challenging and difficult than raising the capital itself.
Managing this element of capital risks is somewhat intangible in nature 
because it’s geared toward relationships and communication efforts as 
opposed to hard financial and accounting data. With that said, we now turn 
our attention toward the more tangible elements of managing capital risks, 
from both the accounting and financial perspectives. Check out Figure 10-1 to 
see these capital risks illustrated.
As you can see in Figure 10-1, all elements of this business are exactly the 
same, with the exception of how the business was capitalized. Under the 
equity scenario, a total of $1 million of capital was raised, all in the form 
of equity. Under the debt scenario, a total of $200,000 of equity was raised 
and $800,000 of debt was secured (of which $200,000 is due over the next 12 
months and is thus classified as a current liability in the balance sheet). The 
income statements are exactly the same with the exception of the fact that 
the debt scenario has interest expense present.
The quick financial analysis highlights the key differences and indicates that, 
by using debt, the company was able to generate better returns for the equity 
owners in 2008 as follows:
	
✓	Returns: The debt scenario produces a return on equity of 16.65 percent 
compared to a return on equity of 11.84 percent with the equity scenario. 
The return on assets is almost identical for both scenarios.
	
✓	Earnings: The debt scenario generates earnings per share of roughly 
4.5 times that of the equity scenario ($1.20 per share compared to 
$0.27 per share).
	
✓	Leverage: The only real downside to the debt scenario lies in the fact 
that this scenario has a much higher debt-to-equity ratio (1.09) com­
pared to for the equity scenario (.34) in addition to having a debt service 
coverage ratio of approximately 1.16. Although using debt was benefi­
cial in terms of enhancing returns, it also has placed the company in a 
higher risk status due to the amount of debt leverage used. This risk will 
be clearly illustrated when the next year’s operating results are realized, 
as presented in Figure 10-2.

 Chapter 10: Identifying and Securing External Sources of Capital
Now we fast-forward to 2009 (as presented in Figure 10-2), during which time the 
company has gone from having a robust year (in 2008) with strong margins and 
profitability to now having to deal with the Great Recession driving sales lower 
by 25 percent and reducing gross margins as a result of having to lower prices 
(to stay competitive). Whereas the selling, general, and administrative expenses 
were reduced as result of the difficult times, the reduction wasn’t enough to 
enable the debt company to generate a profit. Now the equity-financed company 
is able to generate a small profit and produce positive returns on assets and 
equity and the debt-financed company incurs a loss and negative returns.
Making matters even worse is that the debt-financed company may now be in 
violation of certain debt covenants and in default of the loan agreement. For 
example, the loan agreement may read that the company needs to maintain a 
debt service coverage ratio of at least 1 and/or produce profitable results on 
an annual basis (both common covenants for lending sources). Because the 
company has violated both, it is in technical default on the loan, which will 
require a fair amount of management attention moving forward.
And just to add a little more insult to injury, the real damage may not be real­
ized until 2010 and beyond. While the equity-financed company has a strong 
balance sheet and ample cash to expand after the recession ends, the debt-
financed company is stuck with restructuring its balance sheet to please its 
creditors. Thus, it may miss significant growth opportunities in 2010 and 
beyond, costing the company sales and profits.
	
In summary, debt- and equity-financing strategies cut both ways. Although 
debt-financing strategies can enhance returns, they also increase the com­
pany’s operating risks by leveraging its assets. In good times, when profits 
and cash flows are ample and everyone’s making a buck, debt-financing strate­
gies look great. When the tide turns, profits dry up, and cash flows become 
restricted, debt financing can look like the evil stepchild that nobody wants 
around but which must be fed (usually at the expense of some good kids). 
Remember, debt-financing sources are focused on providing loans that gener­
ate sound returns and are repaid in a reasonable time frame. You won’t get 
much sympathy from a bank if you ask them to suspend debt payments in 
order to keep a business unit open on the hopes of an eventual rebound.
Conversely, equity capital offers a chance to strengthen the balance sheet 
and help manage the company’s operating risks through good times and bad. 
Maintaining a strong balance sheet can really provide a competitive weapon 
when expanding a business into new markets or exploring a unique business 
opportunity. However, having too much equity without being able to gener­
ate adequate returns can dampen investor enthusiasm and produce a rather 
restless group of shareholders and board members. Remember, equity-
financing sources do not invest capital to watch it generate below-average 
returns. Equity capital, although representing a lower perceived risk to the 
company, is by its nature a higher-risk capital source (to the providers) and 
must produce a satisfactory investment return. If not, the equity capital will 
find an opportunity that does provide the necessary return.

 Chapter 10: Identifying and Securing External Sources of Capital
Looking at the Reality of the 
Current Capital Markets
Raising capital really does represent the ultimate sale: You have to convince 
a capital source to actually believe in your business and then fork over the 
money. Terms such as nerve-racking, frustrating, euphoric, riding a roller 
coaster and the like become common in addition to the experiences of hair 
loss, stress, and joy. And the economic turmoil experienced across the globe 
from 2007 through 2010 has only made the capital-raising process even more 
challenging. So as a friendly reminder to help you with this challenge, we 
summarize ten key capital-raising tips along with five critical realities of the 
capital markets.
Ten tips for raising capital
As you navigate the complicated job of raising capital, keep the following 
advice in mind:
	
✓	Be prepared. Always be prepared for anything and everything. Capital 
sources expect and demand the highest quality information, plans, and 
underlying support be made available when evaluating an investment 
opportunity.
	
✓	Be persistent. Capital sources are just looking for reasons to say no. The 
attributes of persistence and determination can’t be emphasized enough 
when pursuing and securing capital.
	
✓	Qualify the capital sources. Make every effort to qualify your capital 
sources to ensure that the most appropriate avenue is pursued in rela­
tion to the operating status of your business. Don’t waste your time or 
theirs, and by all means make sure that the capital source is capable and 
accredited to support the request.
	
✓	Give yourself plenty of time. Raising capital can be a painstakingly slow 
process, so make sure you plan well in advance and use one simple rule: 
If you need money in three months, plan on needing twice that long to 
obtain it.
	
✓	Communicate. Communication efforts are critical to successfully secur­
ing and managing capital. To keep capital sources happy, you absolutely 
must keep them up-to-date with all relevant information, good or bad.
	
✓	Document and disclose. Do not underestimate the importance of 
properly documenting all capital-raising activities, from the initial com­
munications to final agreements. In addition, full and complete disclo­
sures are a must in today’s hostile economic environment and are often

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
referred to as “representations and warranties.” These disclosures 
include, but are not limited to, stating that the company has the rights 
to all intellectual property claimed as owned, no legal actions or law­
suits are present (and if they are present, they must be disclosed), is a 
company in good standing (has the right to legally conduct business), 
has executed the following material contracts or commitments, and 
on and on and on. Basically, representations and warranties cover just 
about every aspect of the business.
	
✓	Keep your options open. Having more than one financing option avail­
able is always helpful. Although it may not be feasible for every busi­
ness, keeping more than one iron in the fire is important in this era of 
economic uncertainty.
	
✓	Treat capital sources as partners. Whether a business’s source of capital 
is debt or equity, the party providing the capital represents a key partner 
to a company’s current and future success. So by including the capital 
source in active and appropriate elements of the business, they are more 
likely to stay engaged, offer support, and advise to assist the company.
	
✓	Have exit strategies. Remember, all capital sources want their money 
back with a solid return at some point. Offer clear and reasonable exit 
strategies to assure the capital sources that a light will be present at 
the end of the tunnel (and that it’s not a freight train barreling down the 
other direction).
	
✓	Balance the risk/reward relationship. To a capital source, equity invest­
ments carry more risk than debt investments, and as such the return 
realized on the investment must be higher. To a business, debt can 
expose the company to greater risks but also higher returns. The trick 
is to find the right balance between the two so returns are enhanced 
(with the equity source being happy) but not overleverage the company 
(which would place the entire livelihood of the business at risk). As with 
the so-called “stress tests” undertaken by banks in the United States in 
2010 to evaluate how well they could hold up under adverse economic 
conditions, a similar stress test should be performed on your company 
to evaluate where its key tipping points may be.
Five realities of the current 
capital markets
As if capital sourcing wasn’t difficult enough in the best of times, the current 
economic environment has made your job harder. Knowing the following 
unfortunate facts about today’s capital markets will prepare you to deal with 
the current climate and reassure you that everyone is facing the same tall 
hurdles.

 Chapter 10: Identifying and Securing External Sources of Capital
	
✓	Longer lead times: Plain and simple, securing capital takes much longer 
today than it did five to ten years ago. With fewer sources, added scru­
tiny, and increased regulations, all businesses should be prepared for a 
much longer sales or securing cycle.
	
✓	More expensive: Almost all forms of capital, debt or equity, are more 
expensive for most businesses than a decade ago. The current low-
interest-rate environment should not be used as a basis when determin­
ing the cost of capital, because unless your company name is Apple, 
McDonald’s, or Microsoft, access to cheap capital will not be available.
	
✓	Fewer sources: The Great Recession of 2007 through 2009 definitely 
thinned the herd in terms of available sources of capital. Bank fail­
ures were well documented, but other sources of capital, including 
VCs, PEGs, alternative lending sources, and even FF&CBAs, also saw 
contractions. There just aren’t as many choices today compared to a 
decade ago.
	
✓	Stringent underwriting: As noted throughout this chapter, capital 
source underwriting and due-diligence efforts are as detailed, thorough, 
and intense as ever. The heightened concerns involving accountability 
and transparency have amplified the need for additional underwriting 
procedures.
	
✓	Tighter reporting and management: When capital is secured, you have 
to be prepared for much tighter management and reporting controls by 
the capital source. As the capital sources are under more pressure to 
manage their resources more efficiently, this requirement simply works 
down the food chain.

W

hen discussing the concept of debt in today’s economy, a very seri­
ous and unfortunate misconception needs to be clarified. That is, 
contrary to popular belief, the term debt is not a four-letter word. Although 
the excesses of the debt housing binge have been well documented since the 
housing market started to crash in 2007 and conjure up numerous horror 
stories at the neighborhood barbeque, the crash really just highlighted how 
dangerous debt is — when used inappropriately.
	
If you remember one concept from this chapter, it should be this: Debt is most 
appropriately used when an asset is available to support the eventual repay­
ment of the debt. Whether the asset is tangible (such as equipment used in 
a manufacturing process), paper based (such as a trade accounts receivable 
where a valid claim is present against a third party), or centered in the abil­
ity to reliably predict a positive cash-flow stream, the business must have a 
clearly identifiable asset that can, if needed, be validated by an independent 
third party.
The goal of this chapter is to pick up where Chapter 10 (on securing capital 
from equity sources) left off by beginning our discussion on debt with a more 
complete overview of its key attributes and characteristics.

Understanding the Basics 
of Debt Capital
Debt-based capital is money given to the business in the form of a loan. It 
represents a liability or obligation to a business because it’s generally gov­
erned by set repayment terms as provided by the party extending credit and 
accompanied by a claim against specific assets. For example, suppose a bank 
lends $2 million to a company to purchase additional production equipment 
to support the expansion of a manufacturing facility. The bank establishes 
the terms and conditions of the debt agreement, including the interest rate 
(for instance, 8 percent), repayment term (say, 60 months), the periodic pay­
ment, collateral required, and other elements of the agreement. The company 
must adhere to these terms and conditions or run the risk of default.
But debt is not limited to just loans, leases, notes payable, and/or other simi­
lar agreements. Countless other sources of debt are used by a company to 
support daily operations. Examples of these sources include using payment 
terms (for example, due in 30 days) provided by vendors when purchasing 
products or services, leveraging customers to provide advances or deposits 
against future purchases, or remitting commissions to employees when the 
cash for a sale is received compared to when the actual sale is made.
Debt is best evaluated by understanding its two primary and critical charac­
teristics: maturity and security.
Debt maturity
Debt maturity refers to the length of time the debt instrument has until the 
maturity date, which is the date the debt becomes due and payable. For 
example, in the case of trade accounts payable, vendors commonly extend 
credit terms of 30 days to their customers, which means payment is due within 
30 days of receipt of the product or service. Any debt instrument requiring 
payment within one year or less is classified as current (short-term) in the bal­
ance sheet. Logic then dictates that long-term debt is any obligation with a pay­
ment due beyond one year. For example, mortgage loans provided by banks 
for real estate purchases are often structured over a 30-year period. Hence, the 
portion of the debt due past the first year is considered long term in nature.
Debt security
Debt security refers to the type of asset the debt is supported by or secured 
with. If a bank lends $2 million to support the expansion of a manufacturing 
facility, the bank takes a “secured position” in the assets acquired with the

215
 Chapter 11: Knowing When to Use Debt to Finance Your Business
$2 million loan. That is, the bank issues a public notice (generally through 
the issuance of a Uniform Commercial Code [UCC] document) that it has 
lent money to the manufacturing company and that it has a first right to the 
equipment financed in the case of a future default. This security provides the 
bank with additional comfort that if the company can’t cover its debt service 
obligations, a tangible asset can be retrieved and liquidated to cover the 
outstanding obligation. Other forms of security also include intangible assets 
(like a patent or rights to intellectual property), inventory, trade accounts 
receivable, real estate, and future cash-flow streams (for example, a future 
annuity payment stream that guarantees X dollars to be paid each year).
You may assume, logically, that most organizations that provide credit to busi­
nesses prefer to be in a secured status to reduce the inherent risks present. 
However, for the majority of a company’s transactions related to the periodic 
purchases of goods and services, this arrangement is logistically almost impossi­
ble due to the sheer volume of transactions being executed on a day-to-day basis 
(as filing paperwork with the state on a per-transaction basis to note a secured 
position is present is incredibly inefficient and would overwhelm the system).
	
Hence, the secured creditors are usually the ones focused on a company’s 
infrequent or nonrecurring transactions, such as a bank. They tend to be associ­
ated with formal credit extension agreements (such as a lease or equipment loan), 
which are both relatively large from a dollars-committed standpoint and cover 
longer periods of time. Because the dollar amounts committed are large (and thus 
the risk is higher) and these transactions are less frequent, the secured creditors 
(such as a bank) are more than willing to prepare and file the necessary paper­
work to “secure” their position with the asset they’ve loaned money against.
So in general, the majority of creditors actually turn out to be unsecured. 
This type of creditor tends to be the mass of vendors that provide basic 
goods and services to a company for general operating requirements. 
Examples of these vendors are professional service firms, utility and tele­
communication companies, material suppliers, and general office services. 
Unsecured creditors obviously take on more risk in that a specific company 
asset is not pledged as collateral to support the repayment of the obligation. 
This risk is mitigated by the fact that unsecured creditors tend to extend 
credit with shorter repayment terms (for instance, the invoice is due on net 
30-day terms) and in lower dollar amounts. In addition, if unsecured creditors 
are concerned about getting paid, then they may use other strategies includ­
ing requiring the company to make a deposit or a prepayment.
	
When lenders refer to security interest or position, they’re discussing the 
legal documentation (for example, a UCC) that’s prepared and filed with the 
respective governmental authorities (usually a state commission) to publicly 
place on notice that the lenders have the first right to the asset to which they 
extended a loan against. This arrangement is very similar to a lender provid­
ing a first deed of trust against real estate to which it helped finance the pur­
chase of. A similar process is used with business assets such as equipment, 
machines, inventory, trade accounts receivables, and other assets.

Other debt attributes
Beyond the maturity and security elements of debt are a number of addi­
tional attributes. Debt capital may involve the following distinctions and 
arrangements:
	
✓	Personal guarantees: A party outside the company guarantees the 
repayment of a debt, similar to how a cosigner on a debt instrument 
works.
	
✓	Priority creditors: Certain creditors to a business may maintain a prior­
ity status due to the type of obligation present, such as payroll taxes 
withheld for the IRS, which by law overrides almost all other liabilities.
	
✓	Subordination agreements: A creditor may specifically take a secondary 
position to a secured lender.
	
✓	Default provisions: In the event of a loan default, set provisions indicate 
what the remedies of the parties involved are.
	
✓	Lending agreement covenants: The business must perform at a certain 
level to avoid triggering a default.
	
Before you structure and execute any type of loan, lease, note payable, and/
or set terms and conditions with a creditor, professional counsel should be 
secured and utilized to make sure that you clearly understand the agreement 
and risks present and protect your company’s business interests.
Determining When Debt 
Is Most Appropriate
For almost any debt-based need, some type of lender is usually available 
in the market. On one end of the spectrum are traditional banks and credit 
unions, which tend to be the most conservative lenders but also provide some 
of the best rates. On the other end of the spectrum are investment funds that 
specialize in providing high-risk loans, but of course loans from these sources 
tend to carry the highest rates. And in between are a slew of lenders that all 
have a unique niche in the market, depending on the credit risks, and that 
carry interest rates appropriately matched to the associated risks.
	
Businesses often secure capital from more than one source on a periodic 
basis. For instance, risk-based capital (in the form of equity) may be secured 
to develop a new product and support the initial launch into the marketplace, 
whereas debt-based capital may be secured to support an increase in inventory

217
 Chapter 11: Knowing When to Use Debt to Finance Your Business
and to carry trade accounts receivable as customers purchase the products. 
Not only are both forms of capital appropriate for this company’s needs, but in 
addition the lenders may be more willing to step forward and provide the neces­
sary capital knowing that another partner has made a commitment. The “herd” 
mentality holds true for capital sources because they view the opportunity in a 
more positive light (by assuming a higher degree of success) if they know that 
the right amount and types of capital have been secured.
Debt-based lenders, similar to equity sources discussed in Chapter 10, tend 
to look for a common (but different) set of characteristics when extending 
capital in the form of debt. Different lending sources give different weight to 
each characteristic in each unique business environment, but some definite 
deal killers apply to each. The three primary characteristics are discussed in 
the following sections.
When you can offer security or collateral
The business seeking a loan must offer primary and secondary sources of 
security or collateral (for example, a pledged asset or personal guarantee). 
If the amount of loan required is in excess of the collateral or security being 
pledged, then securing a loan will be very difficult (unless additional collat­
eral is pledged).
	
The best scenario for securing a loan is a company that’s highly profitable, 
has sound collateral, and offers a strong secondary repayment source. Of 
course, you may ask why debt would be needed in this scenario. The answer 
is that a company may want to use debt appropriately to enhance economic 
returns and results (because when all factors are considered, debt is cheaper 
than equity).
When business is stable
Lenders only want to get involved in stable business environments. The 
company must have been in business for an extended period of time, have 
a proven track record, and have a solid management team at the helm. This 
is not to say that businesses must generate a profit to secure debt financing, 
but it certainly helps expand the number of sources available and can help 
secure lower rates.
	
If the lending sources in any way, shape, or form become concerned with the 
credibility of the management team and/or stability of the business operation, 
then chances are that the lending source will pass on extending a loan. The 
last thing any lender wants to do is provide a loan and then, 90 days later, see 
the loan go into default and require collection actions.

218
Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
When you have financial strength
Debt-capital sources are generally more conservative in nature than equity 
sources. Their goal is to ensure that the debt can be repaid, while generating 
an adequate return. Therefore, the company’s ability to maintain solid finan­
cial returns and strong ratios is more important than its likelihood of dou­
bling in size. Again, the same concept applies with financial strength as with 
business stability. The stronger the financial condition, the lower the interest 
rates. The weaker the financial condition, the higher the interest rates.
Some businesses, even if adequate collateral is available to secure the loan 
and no business credibility issues are present, may be just too financially 
“stressed” to extend a loan. In this situation, a lender may evaluate the com­
pany from its ability to survive a shock to the operating structure in terms of 
having enough financial resources to manage through turbulent times. If the 
lender becomes your last chance at survival, then its interest level generally 
falls off unless alternative financial resources can be secured to prop up the 
business.
Using Loans, Leases, and 
Other Sources of Debt
After you conclude that your business meets the security, stability, and 
financial strength requirements for appropriately using debt-based capital 
(discussed in “Determining When Debt Is Most Appropriate”), you can turn 
your attention to evaluating the different sources of debt and when each is 
generally used in a business.
	
No matter what source you choose, we can’t stress enough the importance of 
qualifying the capital source. Nothing is worse than wasting your time in pur­
suing a loan that has no chance of being funded.
Borrowing from banks
Looking to secure capital from banks in the form of loans is one of the most 
tried and proven sources of capital. The old (and, yes, outdated) image of a 
business looking to grow and in need of a loan to expand, hire new employ­
ees, and increase sales and profitability has always been a mantra of the 
banks. Sorry to spoil the party, but we’re here to explain why, due to the cri­
teria they use to underwrite the loan, banks are not ideally suited to handle a 
good portion of business-loan needs in today’s economy.

 Chapter 11: Knowing When to Use Debt to Finance Your Business
	
When a bank or any type of lender refers to underwriting a loan, it basically 
means the same concept of a private capital source performing due diligence. 
The lender undertakes a detailed review of the loan applicant’s financial and 
business information to ensure that the borrower is credit worthy.
Banks do provide an important source of debt-based capital to some busi­
nesses, but they require five key criteria to be met before they consider pro­
viding a loan:
	
✓	Positive earnings: In most cases, a company must generate positive 
cash flow or earnings to secure a loan. Banks are cash-flow lenders, 
which basically means that for any type of debt they offer, internal cash 
flows must be adequate to repay the debt. So if a business has historical 
losses or is forecasting losses in the future, strike one.
	
✓	Sound collateral: Banks lend against assets to protect their loans. So 
every business looking to secure a bank loan needs to have sound collat­
eral available (to repay the loan in case the business cannot). Generally, 
banks like to lend against the most liquid and best-performing assets, 
such as trade accounts receivable. They tend to be more cautious when 
asked to accept collateral such as inventory (which can become obso­
lete quickly and also carries the risk of simply disappearing from a busi­
ness) and equipment (which can depreciate in value very quickly and is 
expensive to liquidate if needed). So the preference with banks is to lend 
primarily against trade receivables and, if needed, then offer reduced 
loans or lending facilities against higher risk assets such as inventory. If 
you don’t have quality collateral or the right collateral, strike two.
	
✓	Solid financial performance: The strength of a company’s balance sheet 
is just as important as positive earnings when requesting a loan. When a 
business has excessive leverage (too much debt compared to too little 
equity), its business risks increase and a bank’s interest decreases. So if 
your business is too leveraged, strike three.
	
✓	Secondary repayment: For most smaller- to medium-size businesses 
(the vast majority operating in America), banks generally look for a 
secondary source of repayment to ensure that the debt gets paid. Or in 
other words, if internal cash flow is not adequate and the collateral (if 
liquidated) doesn’t cover the debt obligation, the bank needs to turn to 
another source of repayment to cover the debt. This secondary source 
generally falls back on the personal assets of the company’s owners, 
which may range from real estate to personal savings to retirement 
accounts to other business interests owned (by offering a personal guar­
antee). If no secondary repayment sources are available, strike four.
	
	A personal guarantee (or PG) pretty much means what it implies. That 
is, if your business can’t repay a loan, then the lender will pursue the 
assets of the individual who signed the PG to ensure that full payment 
is received. Needless to say, PGs should be executed with the utmost 
caution and understanding, but at the same time, you also keep an 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
220
Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
important concept in mind: If you elect to not execute a PG, then the 
bank views your reluctance as a sign that you, the owner or founder, do 
not have faith in the business. So why would a bank lend money if the 
owners aren’t willing to stand behind the company (even if all the other 
criteria is met)?
	
✓	Business plan: To get a bank loan, your company needs a solid business 
plan with a highly experienced and credible management team. These 
requirements reassure the bank that their cash is being turned over to a 
third party who knows how to run a business and generate profits. Any 
plan that a bank reviews that is short on these items will certainly lead 
to strike five.
Since 2007, just about every bank (notice it’s a four-letter word) has been 
maligned, fairly or not (and been referred to in the same sentence with just 
about every other unflattering four-letter word). The frustration with the 
banking industry, at both the personal and business levels, has been well 
documented and has really reshaped the banking industry’s role in the capi­
tal markets. For example, prior to 2007, a bank might have been able to bend 
a little when extending credit to a good business that had some flaws (such 
as a relatively high debt-to-equity ratio). However, businesses are now being 
treated to a new normal that makes securing loans much more challenging. 
Banks still play a very important and vital role in the capital markets, but 
businesses must clearly understand when a bank can provide debt-based 
capital and when it cannot.
	
If your business meets the five criteria outlined previously, then approach­
ing a bank is appropriate. Banks are always looking for A/A+ deals, and if 
your business qualifies, then taking advantage of this source of debt capital 
is advantageous because it usually carries far lower fees and interest rates 
than other forms of debt-based capital. However, if just one of the five criteria 
is not met, then banks may lose interest, so it’s imperative that businesses 
understand the alternative forms of debt-based capital available. And if you 
fail two or more of the criteria, then bank financing options will likely be very 
limited, so the next step in evaluating securing financing is to explore the 
­wonderful world of asset-based lending.
Making friends with asset-based lenders
Asset-based lending utilizes the same criteria as banks but with one critical 
difference. Asset-based lenders (ABLs) focus on the quality of the asset (such 
as trade accounts receivable or inventory) being offered as collateral first and 
the company’s financial performance and strength second. In fact, ABLs often 
look past one or two years of poor financial performances and are more com­
fortable with weak balance sheets because they understand that businesses 
sometimes experience problems (look no farther than the 2009 recession and

its impact on businesses). However, similar to banks, the need for sound col­
lateral, solid secondary repayment support, and a well-developed business 
plan are essential to secure a loan.
	
But ABLs have a hidden benefit that a business should exploit when appro­
priate: ABLs may extend higher borrowing levels against certain assets than 
banks. For example, banks tend to be more conservative in nature and may 
only advance 75 percent against eligible trade accounts receivable, so if you 
have $1 million of eligible trade receivables, you can borrow a maximum of 
$750,000. If the collateral strength of the trade receivables is strong, an ABL 
may lend 80 or even 85 percent against the eligible trade receivables, which 
would allow a company to borrow $800,000 to $850,000. The additional bor­
rowing availability may not seem like much, but when cash is tight, having an 
extra few dollars of liquidity available is invaluable.
So you may ask, why not skip the bank and simply secure financing from an 
ABL? Well, ABLs are more expensive. Period! From the interest rates charged 
on the loans to the fees assessed to manage the relationship, the cost of 
ABL-provided financing is much higher than traditional banks. As a general 
reference point, it’s safe to say that ABLs will be about double what the bank 
costs “all in all” or when all costs, fees, and expenses are accounted for. 
(If bank-provided financing costs roughly 6 percent, then an ABL is around 
12 percent). This source may appear expensive, but remember, an ABL 
absorbs additional risks with weaker companies and thus requires a higher 
rate of return.
Another downside of an ABL is that you need to be prepared to implement 
much tighter management reporting requirements than you would with 
a bank. Whereas a bank may require monthly reports and information, 
ABLs often look for weekly or, in some cases, daily reporting procedures to 
be implemented to properly track and manage the assets they’re lending 
against.
Leasing as a source of capital
Leasing or renting an asset is an effective source of debt-based capital. The 
most common example is leasing office space. Instead of tying up cash in pur­
chasing a building or investing in leasehold improvements, most companies 
simply execute a lease with a landlord.
	
An e-commerce retail company was growing rapidly and needed additional 
warehouse and distribution space for the company’s products. Adjacent 
space was available but needed a number of improvements to be workable. 
Instead of making the improvements itself, the retail company negotiated 
with the landlord to make the improvements and then simply increased the 
rent proportionately to cover the additional costs. This arrangement allowed

222
Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
the retail company to utilize cash internally and finance the building improve­
ments over the life of the lease (which was at a very reasonable rate).
Leases are most commonly structured with assets that have an extended life, 
such as buildings and capital equipment (like manufacturing equipment, fur­
niture, computers, and autos). Structuring leases for capital equipment are 
also used extensively in the business community and provided by numerous 
financing or leasing companies. But before a business dives headfirst into 
leasing, the following key concepts and risks should be understood:
	
✓	Risk of ownership: Most equipment leases are structured to transfer 
the risk of ownership to the lessee, so insurance, property taxes, mainte­
nance, and so on all fall on the shoulders of the party leasing the equip­
ment. But in the same breath, remember that the leasing company has a 
secured interest in the asset being leased (to protect their interests). In 
other words, in most cases the leasing company retains legal title to the 
assets being leased. If the business defaults on terms of the lease, the 
owner (the lessor) can repossess the asset.
	
✓	Real financing cost: Understanding the internal cost of a lease in terms 
of the implied interest rate being charged is very important. Leasing 
companies use all types of tricks and tactics to improve their returns, 
including requiring payments to be made in advance (for example, on 
the first day of the month rather than the last), having the first and last 
months’ lease payments made in advance, structuring fair-market value 
buyout options, and so on.
	
✓	Used versus new equipment: Leasing is best utilized when the equip­
ment is new rather than used, because the interest rate charged and the 
amount of lease financing provided will be most favorable to the lessee. 
Attempting to secure lease financing on used equipment is both very dif­
ficult and expensive.
The bottom line in equipment leasing is the same with securing other forms 
of debt. The leasing companies generally take on higher levels of risk than 
a bank and, as such, demand higher returns (so leasing tends to be more 
expensive than other forms of debt). But though more expensive, leasing 
companies often extend leases based on 90 to 100 percent of the equipment’s 
new value, so instead of having to place 20 percent down on the asset (with a 
traditional bank loan), more cash can be conserved inside the business when 
using leases.
	
In every debt-based financing decision, the borrower needs to make a critical 
decision based on the trade-off between higher financing costs and access 
to additional capital or cash. Or in other words, if the excess cash can be 
invested or used in the business to generate returns greater than the costs 
of the financing, then using more-expensive and flexible financing programs 
is appropriate. One mistake commonly made by businesses is that they’re so 
consumed with making sure they get the lowest interest rate available that

223
 Chapter 11: Knowing When to Use Debt to Finance Your Business
they don’t consider the impact the loan facility may have on restricting avail­
able borrowing levels and access to cash. In a number of cases, paying a little 
extra for higher loan balances and/or access to cash is well worth the added 
expense.
Tapping government programs 
and the SBA
Government lending programs, at both the state and federal levels, are 
accessible for businesses. The most popular program at the federal level is 
provided through the Small Business Administration, or SBA, which offers 
programs geared toward real estate (for owner-occupied buildings) and gen­
eral business working-capital requirements. Contrary to popular belief, the 
government is not handing out free cash (which we know is hard to believe) 
and in fact applies basically the same stringent underwriting criteria as the 
banks.
	
The government relies heavily on the banking industry to market and under­
write SBA loans. As such, the common perception that loans from the SBA are 
readily available and easy to obtain is a myth. In fact, securing an SBA loan can 
be more time consuming and challenging than a traditional bank loan.
In addition to the federal government’s SBA program, various states also 
have lending programs to assist small businesses. The availability of these 
programs has declined over the years as state and local governments strug­
gle with large budget deficits and limited financial resources. Turn to the 
later section “Leveraging Uncle Sam for Cash” for a more thorough discus­
sion on tapping the government for cash.
Using other sources of debt-based capital
Numerous other forms of debt-based capital are available, and two common 
sources are particularly worth highlighting:
	
✓	Factoring receivables: When trade accounts receivable are factored, 
technically the receivable is sold to a third party who becomes the 
owner of the receivable (as cash is paid to the seller). Unlike banks and 
ABLs that lend against an asset (and thus the asset remains the property 
of the company), in this case, the asset is actually sold to a third party. 
When the customer pays, the cash goes to the factoring company and 
the transaction is completed. Factoring financing agreements are used in 
a wide range of industries, and as with all forms of debt financing, they 
carry both pros (high advance rates and quick turnarounds) and cons 
(they’re relatively expensive).

224
Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
	
	Factoring trade accounts receivable involves selling an asset to a third 
party who then may notify your customer that the receivable has been 
sold (and where to properly remit payment). Needless to say, this may 
send a negative message to your customer in terms of the financial 
strength of your business (they may wonder, are you that desperate for 
cash?). When factoring agreements are used, you must properly commu­
nicate the transaction with customers to prevent misunderstandings or 
misinterpretations. The last thing you want to do is surprise your 
customers by introducing an unknown third party into the business 
relationship.
	
✓	Subordinated debt: Quite often, parties with a vested interest in a busi­
ness may provide loans in the form of subordinated debt. The loan 
often comes from an owner or related third party. Subordinated debt 
has terms and conditions established just like other types of debt but is 
offered a lower security position in company assets than senior lenders. 
That is, if a company liquidates, the last creditors in the pecking order 
in terms of having claims against company assets are the subordinated 
debt holders.
Getting Creative with Capital
Banks, leasing companies, and other lenders are all viable and accessible 
sources of debt-based capital, with specific characteristics that give each 
source competitive strengths and weaknesses. However, the discussion of 
sources of capital wouldn’t be complete if we didn’t look a little deeper into 
some more-creative capital sources that can often be overlooked.
The number of creative capital sources is endless, so rather than attempt to 
cover every trick of the trade, we present a diversified list of examples to pro­
vide you with a sense of how businesses manufacture capital.
Generating internal cash flow
The primary concept of this book is educating business owners and manag­
ers on understanding, generating, and managing internal cash flow. To be 
quite honest, the best way to get capital is to look internally and manage 
business operations more efficiently to produce additional capital. Positive 
internal cash flow is both readily available and logistically much easier to 
secure. However, you need to keep in mind that positive internal cash flow 
must be managed and invested appropriately within the best interests of the 
company and its shareowners.

 Chapter 11: Knowing When to Use Debt to Finance Your Business
Leveraging unsecured creditors
Beyond generating additional cash from internal management efforts, a busi­
ness is often afforded the opportunity to utilize creative forms of unsecured 
financing from vendors, partners, and customers. Following are three such 
examples:
	
✓	Require customers to prepay 20 percent of their order as a require­
ment to start the production and future delivery process. In addition, 
terms such as 20 percent down, 30 percent upon half completion, and 
the remainder due upon delivery can also be utilized. Companies that 
produce and sell customized products often use this strategy because 
active alternative markets are generally not present for “one of a kind” 
items.
	
✓	Ask key product suppliers to grant extended terms from 30 days to 90 
days during certain seasonal periods (for example, to support higher 
sales during the holiday season). After the determined period, terms 
are brought back to 30 days when the cash flow from the increased sales 
catches up. Retailers often use this strategy during the holiday season 
as inventory levels are built up from October through November (with 
cash receipts realized in December and then used to repay the extended 
credit granted from its suppliers).
	
✓	Work with a downstream customer to obtain funding to develop a new 
product or technology that can greatly improve the customer’s future 
performance. For example, a hardware technology company may need 
to ensure that software is available for use with its new products. Hence, 
a capital infusion into the software supplier to develop the technology 
for which it receives a royalty from future sales may be warranted.
Going after government 
aid, gifts, and grants
Governments, universities, and nonprofit organizations have resources 
available in the form of grants, low-interest-rate loans (with limited down­
side risk), incentive credits, gifts, and so on that are intended to be used for 
special interests or purposes. The general idea is to provide this capital to 
organizations that will use it in the best interest of the general public. For 
instance, biotechnology companies often secure research grants for work 
being completed on disease detection, prevention, and possible cures. 
Educational organizations may receive grants that help retrain a displaced 
group of workers or poorly educated work force.

Partnering up
A vast array of other creative capital sources is available to companies. In 
this section we summarize one such source, a partnership, in an example.
	
A software company was in the process of developing a new fraud-protection 
system for use in the banking system. Not only did the development of the 
system need to be capitalized, but the initial marketplace launch also required 
additional capital to ensure that the end customers, mainly banks, could 
review, test, evaluate, and implement the systems. Internally, the company 
didn’t have enough capital to support this project, so they completed an 
acquisition of a sister company (which was related through partial common 
ownership) that was producing strong internal cash flows to support the 
project. The company issued its equity in exchange for all the assets of the 
target company (which in effect was the future cash-flow stream). This trade 
provided the company with enough ongoing cash flow (from the acquired 
businesses product sales) to both fund the system development and market it 
to the banks.
Leveraging Uncle Sam for Cash
This discussion on using debt to secure cash for your business ends most 
appropriately with tapping the government to assist with improving cash 
flows. However, before we dive into this topic and discuss specific strategies, 
two critical concepts should be noted.
First, we want to debunk the myth that the federal government simply hands 
out free cash. Yes, the bailouts provided to various banks, General Motors, and 
other companies during the Great Recession appeared to be rather generous, 
but these bailouts carried very specific terms and conditions and were due to 
extreme economic conditions. The federal government does have cash available 
for businesses, but as previously noted in the section “Tapping government pro­
grams and the SBA,” it is looking to provide this cash to viable business opera­
tions with specific and somewhat strenuous terms and conditions.
Second, keep in mind that the strategies offered in this section of the chap­
ter are fully endorsed and accepted by the federal government but carry a 
number of rules and regulations (the fine print). If you don’t properly manage 
and comply with the rules, you can create unforeseen problems and head­
aches for your business.
You may wonder why we elected to incorporate a discussion on the impact 
of taxes in the chapter on using debt in a business. The simple answer is 
that taxes represent an expense and liability to a business (or debt), either 
short term or long-term in nature, and debt represents a source of cash for

227
 Chapter 11: Knowing When to Use Debt to Finance Your Business
businesses. If tax obligations and liabilities can be managed more effectively, 
this in turn can help improve cash flows. But in order to capture the benefits 
of increased cash flows on the taxation front, the following four key points 
should be kept in mind:
	
✓	Securing professional support: Proper professional counsel, including 
CPAs, attorneys, and other taxation experts, should be secured and 
actively utilized to assist with appropriately managing tax liabilities and 
improving cash flows. Given the complexity of the tax laws, combined 
with how frequently tax rules and regulations are changed, high-quality 
tax professionals are usually worth their weight in gold. They often are 
aware of tax breaks, credits, and/or strategies that can save significant 
dollars.
	
✓	Complying with all tax requirements: Tax compliance can be a very 
frustrating, time- consuming, and expensive endeavor. But as the old 
saying goes, don’t be penny-wise and pound-foolish. Skipping on the 
front end will ultimately cost far more down the road when the taxing 
authorities finally catch up to you.
	
✓	Deferring tax obligations: Most tax savings opportunities (and related 
improvements in cash flow) come from deferring tax liabilities rather than 
eliminating them altogether. Granted, tax credits represent a permanent 
method of reducing tax liabilities, but the vast majority of tax strategies, 
including utilizing the cash method to report taxable income, leveraging 
flow-through entities, and taking advantage of accelerated deductions, are 
based more on strategies of timing, offering the ability to delay paying the 
tax. Sometimes they also offer the possibility of deferring some taxable 
income to a future period when the tax rate may be lower.
	
✓	Basing economic decisions on tax factors: Business decisions should be 
based on sound economic and financial considerations first and tax fac­
tors a distant second. You always want to consider how you can struc­
ture business transactions to capture tax benefits, but the tax benefits 
should be the icing on the cake used to enhance the economic return 
(rather than the sole reason an economic return is even realized).
Four government-endorsed strategies 
to help improve cash flow
The number and variety of tax savings opportunities offered by the fed­
eral government are extensive and are generally designed to encourage or 
direct third parties toward undertaking a specific activity or transaction. For 
example, when the housing market and economy collapsed between 2007 and 
2009, the government provided a first-time homebuyer tax credit to encour­
age the purchase of residential property. The government also encourages 
businesses to invest in various activities (such as research and development 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
228
Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
and alternative or clean energy) by providing a variety of tax credits. Of 
course, the majority of the opportunities are not applicable for most busi­
nesses, given the uniqueness of certain tax deductions, credits, and other 
savings opportunities. So rather than attempt to list every potential tax sav­
ings opportunity, we summarize the primary avenues available for small busi­
nesses to leverage Uncle Sam for some cash in the following four sections.
Reporting taxable income on a cash basis
One of the most common strategies utilized by small businesses to manage 
tax liabilities (and associated cash payments to the government) is electing 
to report taxable income by using cash-based as opposed to accrual-based 
accounting for profit. Most businesses are required to prepare periodic 
financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), 
which require financial information to be prepared on an accrual basis. (You 
can find out the details in Chapter 2.) Though this basis is without question 
the most appropriate method to prepare, report, analyze, and distribute the 
financial results of a business, the IRS allows companies that meet certain 
conditions to report taxable income on a cash basis.
What does this switch to cash basis mean? Well, to explain it as simply as 
possible, we look at the two main drivers that create differences between 
accrual- and cash-based taxable income — sales and expenses:
	
✓	Sales: Under the accrual method, sales are recognized and reported 
in the financial statements when fully earned, whether or not cash has 
been collected for the sale. Under the cash method, sales are only recog­
nized and reported when cash is actually received.
	
✓	Expenses: What’s good for the goose is good for the gander, so on the 
expense side of the accrual method, expenses also can be recognized 
and reported in the financial statements when fully incurred (with an 
obligation present), whether or not cash has been distributed to a third 
party. Under the cash method, expenses can only be recognized and 
reported when cash is actually distributed.
Figure 11-1 provides an example of how taxable income can be lowered by 
using the cash method as compared to the accrual method. The significance 
of using the cash method to report taxable income is that it allows for the 
deferral of tax obligations and payments to the government, which translates 
into more cash being retained in the business.
	
The IRS has a number of rules and regulations established to determine if a 
business qualifies to use cash-basis reporting. Thoroughly review these rules 
and regulations with help from professional counsel to make sure that your 
business qualifies to report taxable income using the cash method.

$75,000 relates to direct costs of good sold and $25,000 to corporate

because they were not paid as of the end of the year.
	
Remember that when using cash-based accounting to report taxable income, 
the taxes are not being eliminated but rather deferred or delayed to a future 
period, allowing a company to manage cash resources more efficiently and 
remit tax payments when cash is available. Eventually, income tax obligations 
will be realized when cash is received; so don’t make a very common and 
often fatal mistake of spending the deferred taxable income inappropriately 
and having bare pockets when the tax bill comes due.
Structuring the business to impact cash resources
You can also manage income tax obligations and improve cash availability by 
utilizing the most appropriate legal structure to manage your business opera­
tions. Basically, IRS rules and regulations provide for the following two main 
types of legal structures when it comes to taxation:
	
✓	Flow-through taxable entities: Flow-through taxable entities allow tax­
able income or loss generated by the entity to be taxed not at the entity 
level but rather at the personal level when it flows through to the indi­
vidual owners of the entity. So any tax liability and related cash require­
ment is an obligation of the individuals and not the legal entity. General 
partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and sub­
chapter S corporations are all flow-through entities.

230
Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
	
✓	Regular taxable entities: Regular taxable entities, which include C cor­
porations, among others, are taxed at the entity level with no impact on 
the individual owners. So any tax liability and related cash requirement 
is an obligation of the legal entity, not the individual owners.
	
So how exactly can the legal formation impact tax obligations and cash 
resources? An example can help explain. Two entrepreneurs coming out of 
Corporate America formed and launched a new technology business in the 
middle of the year. In the first six months of the year, both owners had worked 
and generated significant earnings that they were going to use to launch the 
business. They initially formed the company as a flow-through entity, so the 
losses from the new venture in the second half of the year, which amounted 
to over $200,000, flowed through to the owners’ individual tax returns. The 
owners then could offset and reduce roughly $250,000 of regular earnings from 
the first half of the year.
The net effect was that their adjusted gross income was reduced to $50,000, 
which carried less than $5,000 of tax liabilities, compared to having to report 
$250,000 of gross income with resulting tax liabilities of over $60,000. By man­
aging the legal form of the new company, they were able to reduce personal 
tax obligations, which resulted in increased cash availability (via not having 
to remit tax payments to the government). If the company had been formed 
as a regular C corporation (a non-flow-through entity), the loss in year one 
would have been “trapped” inside the legal entity and only available for use 
against future earnings of the company.
Flow-through entities can help lower and/or defer tax liabilities in countless 
other ways. The main point to understand is that the use of flow-through tax 
entities, if properly planned for and correctly structured, can enhance and 
improve cash flows by lowering or deferring income tax obligations. And as 
with all the topics presented on leveraging Uncle Sam, once again we can’t 
emphasize enough the importance of securing proper professional counsel 
when evaluating the most appropriate legal form for your business.
	
As the old saying goes, “Never let the tax tail wag the economic dog,” and you 
certainly shouldn’t let the tax implications be your sole guide when deciding 
on what legal entity to utilize for your company. Numerous other factors may 
impact the economic viability of your company. For example, subchapter S 
corporations have restrictions on the number of parties that can own a por­
tion of the company and must generally be individual persons (and not other 
legal entities, such as a C corporation). If your business is formed as a sub­
chapter S corporation and is looking to secure an investment to fund opera­
tions, certain investors may be eliminated if they don’t qualify.
	
A number of businesses formed initially as a tax-flow-through entity (such as 
a subchapter S corporation) later transition into a regular taxable entity (such 
as a C corporation) when business conditions dictate the need for change. 
This switch allows for these companies to maximize the benefits of being a tax-
flow-through entity in the early years of the business (similar to the real-world 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
231
 Chapter 11: Knowing When to Use Debt to Finance Your Business
example offered previously) and then transition into a regular taxable entity, 
which allows for more flexibility when securing financing. For most businesses, 
the transition from a subchapter S corporation to a regular C corporation is far 
easier and efficient than attempting to undertake the reverse.
Managing owner wages and business earnings
Another area that warrants a discussion on properly managing tax obliga­
tions to improve cash flows concerns how small businesses manage owner 
wages and business earnings. More specially, you want to consider the two 
basic strategies of estimating tax payments and reducing owner W-2 earnings.
Estimated tax payments
Most businesses (or the owners of the businesses, for flow-through entities) 
are required to make estimated taxes on a quarterly basis to cover antici­
pated income tax obligations throughout the year. For example, if a business 
anticipates generating $200,000 of taxable income throughout the year, it 
reasonably assumes that one-fourth, or $50,000, would be earned each quar­
ter. If the business operates in a 25 percent federal government marginal tax 
bracket, then $12,500 is due each quarter.
Although this arrangement is relatively easy to understand, most businesses 
don’t operate in a perfect utopia of guaranteed quarterly performances that 
will always produce a quarterly tax liability in equal amounts (plus or minus 
5 percent). Rather, most businesses have to deal with issues that can create 
rather significant changes between quarterly operating performances (such 
as seasonal sales patterns, nonrecurring large projects, sales and expense 
timing in relation to cash receipts and disbursements, and so on).
So in order to properly manage estimated tax payments on a quarterly basis, 
the company’s actual quarterly financial results should be used as the basis 
for calculating annualized net taxable income levels and resulting tax obliga­
tions. In other words, the quarter-by-quarter profit of the business may fluc­
tuate widely. The busy season of the year may show large profits, which are 
offset by low profit numbers or even losses in other quarters. In short, the 
company may have relatively large swings in quarterly estimated payments. 
Be sure to properly calculate and document the financial results used as the 
basis for the estimated tax payments (in case an inquiry is ever made).
	
Don’t overpay your estimated tax payments! Whether at the business or 
personal level, properly calculating and remitting estimated tax payments 
should be completed on a quarterly basis to avoid making the ever-so-popular 
statement, “I’m getting a big tax refund back.” Not only have you let the gov­
ernment use your money at no cost, but you’ve also more than likely parked

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
	
When possible, individuals should take advantage of the IRS’s safe harbor 
rules. Though generally not available at the state level, the IRS provides for a 
simple way to pay estimated tax payments at the personal or individual on a 
quarterly basis. You take your previous-year tax obligation and multiply by 
110 percent, and then use the resulting amount as the basis of your current-
year tax obligation. For example, if your prior-year tax obligation was $20,000, 
you would multiply by 110 percent, which results in $22,000. As long as you 
make tax payments of $22,000 during the year, the IRS doesn’t tack on penal­
ties or interest charges if in fact you end up owing $40,000 in taxes that year. 
Granted, the difference or shortfall of $18,000 would still be due on the tax-
reporting deadline, but by using the safe harbor rules, you’ve been able to 
defer paying the tax obligation and use that cash for a 6- to 12-month period 
for other purposes.
Using the safe harbor rules to keep cash in the business is generally most 
effective during a period of continued net earnings growth and increases 
in tax obligations because, in effect, the added income tax obligations are 
pushed out to the next year (for payment).
Owner W-2 earnings versus distributions of earnings
One decision every business must make is what compensation rate to set for 
senior management. In large companies, the decision is usually dictated by a 
number of factors, including the competition, board/shareholder approvals, 
and other factors. For smaller, closely held companies that are structured as 
pass-through entities, the decision is somewhat more arbitrary and is often 
influenced by tax savings opportunities (not to mention the performance of 
the company).
These types of companies often keep owners’ taxable wages relatively low 
to deflate or reduce traditional W-2 wages to reduce the amount of Social 
Security and Medicare, taxes the company must pay. The current tax rules 
and regulations dictate that for regular W-2 wages, Social Security taxes (at 
a rate of 6.2 percent) are assessed on the first $106,800 (for 2011, unchanged 
from 2010) of W-2 wages with preliminary estimates of $110,100 being the 
base for 2012, whereas Medicare taxes (at a rate of 1.45 percent) are assessed 
on all W-2 wages. These taxes are important to understand, because they’re 
not only withheld from the employee’s pay but also matched by the company 
paying the wages. So if W-2 wages are deflated or reduced, the amount of 
taxes paid is reduced as well.
Figure 11-2 reflects the impact of using this strategy on total taxes paid, 
reduced tax expense, and increased cash flows:

 The maximum wage level (or base) in 2010 subject to Social Security taxes as
set by the IRS was $106,800. This base is adjusted each year by the IRS to 
account for inﬂation. 
W-2 wages are treated as an expense to the company, which reduces taxable 
income. So if W-2 wages are reduced, taxable income is increased, which 
results in larger amounts of taxable income being passed through to the 
owners of the company. However, the savings from reduced Social Security 
and Medicare taxes are large enough to offset the increased tax on the net 
business income passed through. The owner’s total income remains about 
the same whether earned as W-2 wages or passed through as taxable earn­
ings from the company, but when applying a constant marginal tax rate, 
the strategy of reducing W-2 wages and increasing taxable income, as in the 
example in Figure 11-2, results in tax savings of $5,481.

Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
This particular strategy can become very complex very quickly and contains 
a number of potential traps to unsuspecting business owners, so you should 
use it with an abundance of caution. However, when used at the optimal time 
(especially when a company is struggling with limited profits and tight cash 
flows), it can help lower tax liabilities and improve cash flows by directing 
more cash into the business as opposed to the government.
	
The W-2 wages can’t be reduced to an amount that’s unrealistically low for 
the job and that particular field, and the IRS is targeting owners who arti­
ficially deflate regular W-2 earnings to lower Social Security and Medicare 
taxes. For instance, if a partner in a law firm pays herself $80,000 a year in W-2 
wages, with the going rate for similar paid professionals in other law firms at 
$300,000, not to mention that the partner’s law firm generated taxable income 
of $1,000,000, the IRS will most likely challenge the W-2 wages paid (as being 
too low). The key in managing this issue is to make sure that the W-2 wages 
paid are reasonable, given the operating performance of the company and 
comparable wages earned by similar workers. Remember that the term reason­
able provides for a fair amount of latitude, so again, if you’re uncertain what is 
reasonable, consult professional counsel.
Finding hidden tax gems: Tax credits, accelerated 
deductions, and other incentives
The fourth government “hand-out” assists businesses with reducing expenses 
and improving cash flows by offering special tax credits, accelerated deduc­
tions, and other specialized incentives. We don’t even attempt to summarize 
all the potential tax savings opportunities governments offer, because they 
could fill an entire book. Rather, we summarize these issues in three primary 
topics: tax credits, accelerated deductions, and other incentives:
	
✓	Tax credits: The most commonly used tax credits by businesses are 
offered for R&D (research and development) activities, clean and green 
investments (like solar power), and focused hiring in disadvantaged 
employment groups (such as the WOTC, or work opportunity tax credit). 
Tax credits are a great tool to utilize when available and appropriate 
because unlike tax deductions, tax credits represent a dollar-for-dollar 
offset of tax liabilities. For example, if a company has taxable income 
of $100,000 before claiming an accelerated deduction of $20,000, the 
company reports taxable income of $80,000. At a tax rate of 25 percent, 
the company then has a tax liability of $20,000. However, if a tax credit 
of $20,000 is obtained as a result of R&D efforts, quite a different result 
is achieved. Using the same $100,000 figure, which now represents the 
taxable income, and applying a 25 percent tax rate, the tax liability is 
$25,000. Then applying the tax credit of $20,000, the net tax liability is 
reduced to just $5,000. So it’s no wonder why companies look to secure 
and utilize tax credits so aggressively.

235
 Chapter 11: Knowing When to Use Debt to Finance Your Business
	
✓	Accelerated deductions: The government aggressively encourages busi­
nesses to invest in new property, plant, and equipment by providing 
for accelerated deductions when qualified assets are purchased. The 
idea is that by providing an accelerated deduction, increased purchase 
activity in qualified assets will help stimulate the economy. The most 
common example of this encouragement is in equipment purchases. In 
a normal year, the IRS may allow a depreciation deduction of 20 percent 
of the equipment’s purchase price in the first year, but during a targeted 
period (such as 2009, when the economy fell off a cliff), the deduction 
can be increased to 50 percent during the first year. For an asset that 
cost $100,000, the increased depreciation expense of $50,000 instead of 
$20,000 reduces taxable income by $30,000 and thus reduces the compa­
ny’s tax liability by an additional $7,500 (assuming a 25 percent tax rate).
	
	The benefits of accelerated deductions are often maximized in a highly 
profitable operating year for a business. That is, if a company is in a 
high marginal tax bracket, say at 35 percent, the deduction saves far 
more taxes than if the company is in a low marginal tax bracket (say 15 
percent). Proper tax planning becomes an important element of knowing 
when accelerated deductions give you the most bang for your buck.
	
✓	Specialized incentives: Government legislation is littered with all types 
of specialized incentives, awards, grants, and/or other types of windfalls 
that can be obtained if the right criteria are met. For example, the gov­
ernment supports a number of grant programs designed to encourage 
investments in desirable markets, such as the healthcare industry. The 
government also gives preferential treatment to women-, minority-, and 
disadvantaged-owned businesses in securing contracts when conduct­
ing business with the government.
	
The list of incentives at both the state and federal government levels is exten­
sive, but we offer words of caution: To have any hope of securing specialized 
incentives, you must be very patient, persistent, and well prepared because 
the qualifications can sometimes be extremely rigid. Although the govern­
ment generally has good intentions when providing incentives, remember that 
you’re dealing with the largest bureaucracy in the world.
Don’t forget the SALT: State 
and local taxation
Probably every Baby Boomer who has visited the doctor recently has been 
told three things: Exercise, watch your weight, and eat right (with a special 
emphasis on cutting down your salt consumption). Well, businesses may also 
want to reduce their SALT intake — that is, your state and local taxation. The 
fact of the matter is that with most states, counties, cities, and municipalities 
being strapped for cash, the exact opposite is happening. State and local gov­
ernments are not only looking for ways to generate revenue from just about 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
236
Part III: Getting Intimate with Your Company’s Cash Flow Needs 
any source of SALT they can but also implementing policies to accelerate 
payments from these types of taxes.
We use the term SALT to refer to the plethora of taxes applied and adminis­
tered at the state and local level, including property taxes, sales and use taxes, 
state income taxes, unclaimed property taxes, environment fees or taxes, new 
and expanded business licensing fees, employee head taxes, and the list goes 
on and on. Whether these expenses are actually called a tax or a fee doesn’t 
change the fundamental principle: Your business is going to pay more.
	
The state of California now requires every business generating over $100,000 
a year in revenue to complete an annual use-tax return. For a quick refresher 
course, use taxes are due from businesses that buy and consume tangible per­
sonal property that was acquired without paying sales tax (to the seller). For 
instance, a business may purchase technology equipment over the Internet 
from a supplier in Texas that’s not required to collect and remit taxes in 
California (because it delivers the goods via a common carrier). So although 
the supplier isn’t required to collect and remit the sales tax, the purchaser, 
or user, is required to report the purchase on a use-tax return and remit the 
appropriate tax to the state of California. It’s probably not too hard to figure 
out why states are targeting this issue, given the explosion of Internet pur­
chases and the loss of associated sales tax revenue.
The impact of SALT really hammers businesses on three fronts. First, existing 
tax rates, government-mandated fees, and so on are increasing. Second, new 
taxes and government-mandated fees are being created. And third, govern­
ments are looking for more ways to accelerate the collection of taxes and 
fees to “pull forward” these revenue sources into current budgetary years. 
Though we would love to summarize our discussion on SALT with ways to 
improve cash flows, our advice on SALT and cash flows is to make sure your 
business properly administers and complies with all SALT-related matters in 
your operating jurisdiction to avoid very nasty and problematic assessments.
	
In real estate, location, location, and location mean everything. For SALT, com­
pliance, compliance, and compliance mean everything. With state and local gov­
ernments pursuing every dollar they can (going as far as multiple states setting 
up tax-auditing groups in other states to ensure proper tax compliance), proac­
tively managing this issue is imperative in order to avoid incurring added costs 
and management efforts to clean up old compliance issues (with will undoubt­
edly carry past penalties and interest charges, which aren’t cheap).
	
The concept of nexus is very closely related to SALT. In the business world, 
nexus means that a company has established a business operating presence in 
another governmental jurisdiction, which in turn triggers the need to comply 
with all SALT reporting requirements there. Nexus can be established by 
having an office in that jurisdiction with employees or even by having simply

 Chapter 11: Knowing When to Use Debt to Finance Your Business
a piece of property with no office or employees located there. Even if a com­
pany has only one employee covering the sales efforts of an entire state, nexus 
has been established. And remember, the state and local taxing authorities 
talk to one another, so if you’re paying payroll taxes in a state, then the state 
is going to look for income tax returns, property tax returns, sales and use tax 
returns, and so on to be filed.
The pros and cons of debt
To help you remember how you can effectively 
use debt in a business as a source of capital or 
cash, look at debt from both ends of the spec­
trum: the pros and cons.
The advantages of using debt as a source of 
cash can be best summarized in following three 
attributes:
	✓	Flexibility: Debt covers a broad spectrum 
of financing requirements, ranging from as 
little as $50,000 (a niche factoring or leas­
ing company providing capital to small busi­
nesses) to billions of dollars (the world’s 
largest banks providing financing for a 
multibillion-dollar public-company buyout). 
In addition, numerous sources of debt are 
available from the market, covering just 
about every type of risk scenario.
	✓	Management/ownership 
control: 
Management and ownership control is not 
relinquished, because debt providers gen­
erally don’t have a direct say in ongoing 
business matters.
	✓	Economic returns: Economic returns can 
be enhanced when debt is used appro­
priately by leveraging this source of cash. 
Instead of being limited by the amount of 
equity (ownership) capital a business can 
raise, it can leverage or multiply its total 
capital by adding debt on top of the equity 
capital that should provide a larger base for 
sales and to earn more profit.
But unfortunately, you can’t have your cake 
and eat it too when using debt, so here are the 
primary disadvantages when debt is used as a 
source of capital:
	✓	Secured interest: Security in some form 
of asset, guarantee, or pledge is usually 
required, which places the business’s 
assets (and potentially the personal assets 
of its owners) at risk. If the business 
defaults on the loan, these assets may have 
to be used to repay the debt if other means 
are not available to satisfy the obligation.
	✓	Debt must be repaid, with interest: The 
debt must be repaid per the terms and con­
ditions established, regardless of whether 
the company’s performance allows for 
the repayment. Unlike equity investments, 
which tend to only generate a distribution 
of earnings or dividend if the company’s 
performance dictates, debt repayment 
terms are rigid and must be adhered to. If 
not, the company suffers the wrath of its 
creditors demanding repayment.
	✓	Business restrictions: Although direct 
management and ownership in a business 
is not sacrificed, debt sources often place 
restrictions on certain business activities 
(in the form of loan covenants), which may 
limit a company’s ability to undertaken 
business transactions. Whether you like it 
or not, debt sources are partners that can 
influence management decisions.

T

he chapters in this part of the book get down to day-
to-day cash-flow matters that business managers have 
to deal with (or make sure that other employees in the 
business are doing well). Chapter 12 leads off with an in-
depth discussion of fundamentals of bank accounts and 
the key features you should pay attention to. The chapter 
also provides valuable advice for managing cash in the 
digital, electronic-funds-transfer age and explains the 
importance of cash budgeting.
Chapter 13 discusses an unpleasant but necessary topic: 
preventing and minimizing cash losses from many kinds 
of embezzlement and fraud. Unfortunately, some 
customers, vendors, employees, and managers may seize 
any opportunity to steal from the business or otherwise 
take advantage of their positions for their personal benefit 
at a high cost to the business.
In Chapters 14 and 15, we shift to more positive topics. 
These two chapters explain improving cash flow in the 
basic cycles of selling and disbursements. These two 
fundamental business operations are often overlooked 
from the cash-flow point of view.

ou’ve probably heard the following clichés a thousand times over: 
“Cash is king,” “He who has the gold makes the rules,” and, in the infa­
mous words of Warren Buffett, “When the tide goes out, we’ll see who’s left 
standing naked on the beach.” But all these sayings are 100 percent accurate, 
because most businesses spend the better part of their lives either attempt­
ing to secure and create as much cash as possible (hopefully from the ability 
of generating real profits) or, after this goal is achieved, turning their atten­
tion to managing and protecting this invaluable and unique asset.
Looking at the uniqueness of cash from another perspective, a business 
works its tail off to increase and improve its cash levels, but after it does so, 
the business is going to then have to work its tail off attempting to keep other 
parties from grabbing it. Whether shareowners are looking for increased 
dividends, the government is looking for its share of tax receipts, vendors are 
wanting to be paid quicker, employees are feeling underappreciated (that is, 
underpaid), or management simply feels like all that cash is burning a hole in 
its pocket, the list of uses for perceived excess cash balances is endless.
Cash, just like every other business asset, must be properly managed, pro­
tected, and controlled by management. However, given the extremely liquid 
nature of this asset and the fact that cash can easily “disappear” without a 
trace, the types of controls required to properly manage and protect this 
asset take on an entirely different level of thinking and attention.

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
One theme that we hope to drive home in this chapter is that minding, con­
trolling, and managing cash is basically a real-time event that requires active, 
timely, and appropriate (that is, senior-level) management involvement. 
Given the speed at which business moves in today’s economy, gone are the 
good old days of evaluating a business’s performance on a monthly basis. 
That system must be supplemented by very timely and highly relevant infor­
mation reporting. And as part of that reporting, cash availability represents 
an invaluable internal management data point to evaluate a company’s over­
all health and performance.
Managing the Unique Characteristics 
of Cash
When cash is evaluated from the perspective of reviewing the balance sheet, 
it really just looks like another business asset listed before trade receivables, 
inventory, and other assets. But when cash is really understood, its unique­
ness begins to stand out based on the following characteristics. First, cash 
is very liquid and transportable (not to mention highly susceptible to fraud 
or theft). Second, cash really does represent the circle of life in a business as 
basically all business transactions either start or end with cash. Third, cash 
can be exchanged for basically any good or service required by a business. 
And fourth, cash not only represents the circle of life of a business but, more 
importantly, is also the lifeblood of all businesses, because it is imperative to 
maintain proper amounts of cash to support ongoing operations.
Understanding that cash ends up being 
one side of almost every transaction
One of the unique elements of cash (unlike trade accounts receivable or 
inventory) is that eventually it ends up being on one side of almost every 
business transaction executed. The following two examples explain how cash 
becomes a side of any transaction:
	
✓	Sales cycle: ACME Distribution, Inc., sells $10,000 worth of widgets to 
a customer on credit. The customer eventually remits payment. The 
series of entries shown in Figure 12-1 would occur in the accounting 
system.
	
✓	Payables cycle: ACME Distribution, Inc., purchases $6,000 of raw 
material to manufacture its widgets, initially receiving 30-day payment 
terms and then eventually pays the vendor in cash for the product 
(see Figure 12-2).

Although both of the examples are relatively simple, the point is that for 
most businesses cash represents the end game (either in the form of an 
eventual receipt or disbursement). In fact, when cash flows and balances are 
properly understood, they are the best management assessment tools avail­
able to capture the essence of a business’s performance, and they offer a 
great benchmark on which to assess a company’s health.
	
Certain transactions do not involve cash, such as recording depreciation 
expense on owned equipment or having to write off a trade receivable as 
bad debt that’s uncollectable. However, these transactions tend to be less 
frequent in nature, are for lower dollar amounts (in total), and are generally 
accounted for at a specific point in time (for example, monthly or quarterly), 
so they tend to have a reduced role in the business’s overall health. This is 
not to say that these types of transactions are not important to recognize in 
the financial statements, because full accrual-based financial statements pro­
duced by using GAAP require these types of transactions to be recorded. But 
the real economic value and “meat” of a business’s viability should be based 
in transactions that eventually produce or consume cash.

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
Tuning in to the constant cash hum
Because basically all company transactions, in one form or another, end up 
in cash, cash creates a somewhat unique flow and rhythm depending on 
the specific attributes associated with your business. No two businesses 
are exactly the same, so the hum and rhythm of cash flows differ between 
businesses, but, as unique as businesses may be, most have to manage and 
understand three primary types of cash flows: routine, nonroutine, and 
shocks:
	
✓	Routine cash flows: Routine cash flows are generally driven from a com­
pany’s internal normal operating cycle of selling products or services, 
collecting cash, purchasing materials or incurring expenses, and paying 
for these purchases or expenses (which includes the company’s pay­
roll). This type of cash flow tends to be very frequent (or routine, if you 
like, such as the restaurant serving the lunch crowd each day), highly 
predictable (the restaurant has a solid understanding of what the aver­
age ticket for each customer should be) and transacted in much higher 
volumes with a relatively low average transaction level. McDonalds 
offers a perfect example of routine cash flows because they have great 
data on when customers will make purchases, what they will buy, how 
much they will spend, and the volume of customers expected.
	
✓	Nonroutine cash flows: Nonroutine cash flows tend to be driven by a 
number of factors, including seasonal business trends, extraordinary 
events (such as acquiring a business), and/or timing-related events asso­
ciated with the fiscal year-end of a business (like making estimated tax 
payments). For the most part, nonroutine cash flows can be anticipated 
and incorporated into the budgeting and forecasting process because 
though they’re far less frequent in occurrence, they tend to occur in the 
same period during a given fiscal operating year. (For example, the final 
estimated tax payment for a regular C corporation using a fiscal year-
end of December 31 falls in the last month of the year).
	
✓	Shocks: Even less routine than nonroutine cash flow is the occasional 
and cruel need for most businesses to manage sudden shocks to cash 
resources. Events that would fall into this category are natural disasters, 
potential adverse litigation outcomes, and a large and long-standing cus­
tomer terminating a contract without warning. The good news associ­
ated with these events is that they are fairly rare. However, these events 
also tend to be very large and can significantly impact a company’s cash 
position with little or no warning.
	
Having a properly structured and available lending facility to assist with 
managing the periodic uncertainties of cash flows is an extremely important 
tool (to have readily available) for most businesses. Unless you’re the likes

 Chapter 12: Covering the Basics of Cash and Cash Activity
of Apple or IBM, sitting on literally billions of dollars of excess cash, you 
should always make sure your company has a rainy-day fund to tap in case of 
unexpected events. Working with financing sources (such as a bank or other 
lender) to make sure ample cash backs your rainy-day fund availability is a 
prudent management decision.
Deciding what a normal 
cash balance should be
It’s the $10 million question: What should a normal cash balance be? Well, 
the answer to this question varies significantly based on the following four 
key operating issues.
Stage of business
Businesses just launching or starting up need a lot of available cash in order 
to cover projected operating expenses during the period prior to revenue 
being generated and converted to cash. For mature businesses with highly 
predictable revenue/sales patterns, cash availability can be lower because 
management has a much greater level of confidence related to periodic cash 
inflows and cash outflows.
The business stage also affects cash flow related to growth. For slower 
growth in more mature businesses (for example, a utility company), again, 
lower cash levels are needed. For rapidly expanding businesses (typically 
newer companies or businesses operating in highly competitive, rapidly 
changing, and/or innovative environments), higher cash availability is 
needed to support the anticipated growth.
	
Newly launched businesses must understand two key operating issues in 
order to determine how much cash is needed.
	
✓	First, the monthly cash burn rate (discussed in Chapter 7) indicates how 
fast the business is using up cash. For example, if your business gener­
ates $25,000 revenue and cash receipts but spends $100,000 a month to 
cover base operating expenses, your burn rate is $75,000 per month.
	
✓	Second, the revenue or selling cycle must be understood and managed 
to find out when cash will be received from eventual product or ser­
vice sales. For some start-ups, this amount of time may be a little as six 
months, while for others (such as a biotechnology company developing 
a new drug), it may be ten years. Chapter 14 delves into the revenue 
cycle and how it can be managed to improve cash flows.

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
	
The selling cycle almost always takes longer than a company thinks. Business 
owners and entrepreneurs (who are often sales and marketing driven) are by 
nature optimistic and almost always think the market will accept their prod­
ucts or services in a very efficient and timely manner. So although optimism is 
welcome and encouraged, business plans should always double any best-case 
scenario time estimates for implementation to actual sales being realized.
By understanding these two critical issues, managers can determine the 
amount of cash needed to support the business operations over a set period 
of time. This number represents a base minimum level of cash the company 
needs to operate.
Type of business
Your business type has a significant impact on what’s considered a normal 
cash balance. The cash resources needed for a retail business that sells 
directly to customers and generally doesn’t generate trade receivables is 
very different from the cash resources needed for a construction company 
that builds bridges, highways, and other massive projects. For companies 
that are more affected by large projects, lengthy business decisions and 
operating cycles, and downstream influences (for example, a defense con­
tractor waiting for Congress to approve a new military program), higher 
levels of cash are generally required to manage the ebb and flow of expenses 
versus receipts. For a long-standing fast food restaurant that deals only in 
cash, credit cards, and debit cards, the need for readily available cash tends 
to be reduced.
Access to cash
Although having available cash on the balance sheet is always important, 
having access to cash when needed is often far more valuable to a business. 
This access may come in the form of an established relationship with a lend­
ing facility you can tap when needed, or you may be able to access funds 
from investors who have committed funds to be released over a period of 
time. For companies with access to external available cash resources, lower 
levels of cash are required. For companies that don’t have this luxury, higher 
levels of cash are needed.
	
Securing funding or cash for a business to operate is one of the most time-
consuming, intensive, frustrating, and lengthy processes senior management 
undertakes. Planning for cash needs well in advance is absolutely critical 
to ensure that cash is available when needed. Prior to the Great Recession, 
which started in December 2007 (per the National Bureau of Economic 
Research), you could assume that planning three to six months in advance 
was sufficient (depending on where the cash was going to be secured from). 
Now you should double that estimate. With fewer sources of funding/cash 
available, more competition, and more stringent underwriting criteria, secur­
ing funding takes much longer in today’s market.

Market stability
A company must always be evaluating its market and customer base to exe­
cute its business plan. In markets that are very stable and display a high level 
of predictability (for instance, we know X customers will purchase our prod­
ucts and pay in Y days, regardless of the state of the economy), operating 
risks are lower and thus cash balances can be kept lower. A good example of 
this market is liquor stores — whether times are good or bad, people tend to 
drink. On the opposite end of this spectrum are companies operating in mar­
kets that are highly competitive and fluid. For example, a video game manu­
facturer may have the best-selling title in the current year but miss the mark 
altogether in the next year. Ensuring that ample cash resources are available 
to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions is essential to a business’s 
long-term strategic plan.
Your operating conditions
After you have a sense of where your business falls in the preceding four 
categories, you can go back to the original question of what a normal cash 
balance is. Obviously, the answer still varies on a business-by-business basis, 
but you can use the following three operating scenarios as general rules of 
thumb:
	
✓	Mature/highly predictable business with stable markets and access to 
alternative sources of cash: In this scenario, available cash balances can 
be lowered given the highly stable nature of the business. Many such 
companies use a three- to six-month operating expense metric to deter­
mine how much cash should be available. For example, if a company 
incurs $100,000 a month in operating expenses and always wants to 
have three months of cash on hand to cover every expense in the event 
that not one dime comes in from sale (highly unlikely), then the cash 
balance needed would be $300,000. Business types that fall into this sce­
nario include grocery stores, gas stations, utility companies, larger retail 
operations (such as Walmart and McDonald’s).
	
✓	Older business operating in an unstable and evolving market with 
limited access to alternative sources of cash: In this scenario, cash 
resources need to be increased to address a multitude of issues, includ­
ing potentially having to support operating losses during a turnaround 
period, adapt marketing and sales strategies to changing markets and 
customers, and account for the fact that during the business turnaround 
phase, access to financing and cash will be limited. In this environment 
and using the operating expense metric, a minimum of 12 months of 
cash availability should be available and most likely more. The reason 
more money is better is that company turnarounds
 
• Usually take longer to implement than planned
 
• Cost more than anticipated

248
Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
 
• Tend to be met with a large amount of skepticism from financ­
ing sources (that is, the source wants proof before it will provide 
financing, whereas you need financing in order to prove it)
	
	So having extra cash available when operating in this environment is 
always recommended to help absorb the unforeseen roadblocks and 
speed bumps that will inevitably appear. If the monthly operating 
expense level if $100,000, then at least $1.2 million would be needed. A 
perfect example of a business operating in this environment was General 
Motors — and for that matter, the auto industry in its entirety. This 
industry underwent a major restructuring since 2008 and, if it wasn’t for 
the United States Government, was going to fail due to large losses com­
bined with limited access to capital.
	
✓	Start-up or newly formed business penetrating a new market with 
no current revenue or real customers: In this scenario, the operating 
expense metric needs to be at least 12 months, and in a number of cir­
cumstances should be closer to 2 years. So if a start-up company incurs 
$100,000 a month in operating expenses, it should have at least $1.2 mil­
lion and maybe up to $2.4 million in available cash. The reason for this 
high level should be clearly evident — no real revenue is being gener­
ated (so no inflow of cash is occurring), and securing financing or cash 
from third parties often takes a long time (based in the fact that bank 
loans aren’t available while a company is losing money, so equity needs 
to be secured, a much more time-consuming process).
	
The bottom line with cash availability is simple and straightforward: The 
higher the risk and business uncertainty, the higher level of available cash 
needed to support operations. One of the single biggest reasons small busi­
nesses fail is the lack of capital or, more specifically, the failure to develop a 
realistic business plan (ensuring that enough capital is available to execute 
the plan given multiple operating scenarios).
Can having too much cash be a problem?
The answer is yes, because too much cash 
indicates that the company isn’t deploying 
assets in the most profitable manner possible. 
In today’s economic environment, excess cash 
has limited earnings potential. Whether a com­
pany invests the cash in a bank CD (earning 1 
to 2 percent) or United States T-bills or bonds 
(earning from less than 1 to 4 percent), the 
ability to generate any type of real earnings is 
limited, which is why you see shareowners of 
corporations always placing pressure on man­
agement with excess cash to either “use it or 
lose it.” The goal is to redeploy internal earn­
ings that sit in cash into business opportunities 
that can achieve much higher returns than 1 to 
4 percent. And if that growth isn’t possible, then 
management can at least increase dividends to 
return the excess cash to the shareowners (the 
rightful owners of the cash).

 Chapter 12: Covering the Basics of Cash and Cash Activity
And one final thought that needs to be considered is that the available cash 
balances presented in this section are based on ideal levels. In today’s econ­
omy, ideal is often far different from actual. Most strong, stable companies 
tend to have more cash than is needed, whereas most new and struggling 
companies tend to have far less cash than needed. The balance of this book 
is geared toward helping manage available cash to these ideal targets to 
ensure that your company has the necessary resources to prosper.
Implementing Fundamental Cash 
Management Practices
In one sense, cash is just like every other company asset. Similar to inven­
tory, fixed assets, or patents, it needs to be proactively managed, controlled, 
and evaluated on a periodic basis to protect the economic interests of a 
company. On the other hand, cash represents a very unique and extremely 
liquid asset that requires additional management attention, not just from the 
standpoint that cash can quickly disappear due to fraud but, more important, 
because it truly represents the lifeblood of a business. This section focuses 
on the fundamental management issues associated with cash, from the begin­
ning (setting up cash accounts) to the end (assessing and evaluating cash as 
an asset).
	
The same concept that applies with all other company assets also applies to 
cash. The goal is to utilize each company asset as efficiently as possible to 
improve operating results and increase the enterprise’s economic value.
Establishing cash and bank accounts
When a business is initially formed, the first step usually undertaken (after 
the legal formation) is setting up bank and cash accounts. For the purposes 
of our discussion, bank and cash accounts are generally assumed to mean 
the same thing because for most companies the majority of business in cash 
is usually maintained in bank accounts. Even for businesses that maintain 
active on-hand cash balances (such as retail stores that need to have cash 
available to transact with consumers), the original source of this cash and 
the eventual destination are bank accounts.
In order to establish company bank accounts, you need to consider the type 
of bank accounts required, get approval for those accounts from the compa­
ny’s owners or governing board, and then determine who has signing author­
ity (to make withdrawals and deposits). These subjects are discussed in the 
following sections.

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
Bank account types
First, a company must decide what types of bank accounts it requires to con­
duct business. The following types are most commonly used:
	
✓	General operating account: This account is used to process the major­
ity of a business’s normal and customary transactions, such as paying 
vendors and receiving customer payments. Thus the name general.
	
	Some companies establish a master general operating account and then 
establish smaller operating accounts for a business division or segment 
that needs to have ready access to a bank account to conduct business. 
For example, a recycling company that buys large amounts of material 
probably doesn’t want to have cash on hand to purchase the items but 
yet needs to pay third parties on the spot. This company establishes 
a smaller operating account for this division, funded with lower cash 
levels, which can be used to pay third parties as needed. The account is 
then replenished periodically (in some cases, daily) based on the actual 
or anticipated needs. This type of structure represents a control proce­
dure at two levels. First, it limits the amount of cash in an account that 
may be more susceptible to fraud (because normally this account has 
numerous check signers). Second, the division is forced to produce man­
agement information frequently in order to ensure that the bank account 
is properly funded.
	
✓	Payroll account: Quite often, businesses establish a separate bank 
account to process periodic payroll activity. Payroll-related activity 
is usually reviewed by a number of additional parties (like the human 
resource department, outside payroll processing services, and others). 
So to limit access to potentially confidential information, such as total 
company-wide cash levels, a payroll account is only funded with just 
enough cash to cover the next payroll.
	
✓	Investment account: Various names are used for this type of bank 
account, including savings, money market, interest bearing, and others, 
but the idea is always that when a company has excess cash balances, 
the cash is parked in an account that can generate interest earnings.
	
✓	Restricted cash accounts: A restricted cash account can be any number 
of different, unique bank accounts that hold cash for a particular use. It 
can be a certificate of deposit used as collateral (for example, a landlord 
may require a deposit on leased space, so instead of giving the landlord 
cash, the lessee makes a deposit with the bank and pledges it as col­
lateral). It may be a trust account set up to segregate cash that can only 
be used for a specific purpose. For instance, a business was sold with 25 
percent of the purchase price held back for one year to ensure that the 
company’s performance met predetermined targets. When the company 
met those targets, the funds were released to the seller. The reason for 
the trust account was that the seller wanted to make sure the funds 
would be available.

 Chapter 12: Covering the Basics of Cash and Cash Activity
	
The general rule of thumb is that the smaller the company, the fewer bank 
accounts needed. In some cases, the company may be so small (for instance, a 
one-location retail store with four employees) that all its banking needs can be 
addressed with one general bank account. However, managers at companies 
of all sizes should remember that the more cash is consolidated into fewer 
bank accounts, the higher the risk for large losses to occur. Thus, internal 
­policies, procedures, and controls need to be that much tighter and stronger 
when fewer bank accounts are used.
	
Currently, the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) insures bank 
accounts for up to $250,000. If your business has $400,000 in a bank account 
and the bank fails, your business is at risk for $150,000. Although cash losses 
such as these from failed banks are rare, all business owners need to under­
stand that this risk does exist. Companies with large amounts of cash often 
diversify it across multiple banks and account types to help manage this con­
centration risk.
Bank account approval
After the number and type of bank accounts have been determined, the 
actual process of legally establishing the bank accounts must be undertaken. 
Companies are required to obtain proper approval from their governing 
board or membership group to legally open and operate a bank account. 
For a corporation with a board of directors, board authorization must be 
obtained in order to open and begin to use the bank account. Similar autho­
rizations are also required for other business legal forms, such as LLCs, 
partnerships, and nonprofits. You can usually get a boilerplate form (for each 
legal entity type) from the bank to ensure that the proper language is used 
and documentation is prepared to establish a bank account.
Bank account signers
The following statement may seem unusual or even out of place coming from 
authors who are both accountants/financial professionals by training and 
trait, but we hope you will remember it above all else in this chapter:
	
The first and foremost control that needs to be placed on cash is that your 
senior-most accounting and financial personnel or staff should not be 
granted check-signing authority (or the ability to transfer funds outside 
of the company).
Why not, you ask? Well, in just about every business, the party most adept 
and qualified to commit fraud is the same party that’s responsible for prepar­
ing the financial statements, reports, and/or other financial-based manage­
ment tools used. So who is better situated and has the knowledge to commit 
fraud and hide it in the financial statements? The senior accounting and 
finance personnel! Don’t allow the coyote to guard the hen house.

252
Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
Of course, not all accounting and financial personnel are coyotes, and the 
intent of this statement is not to implicate them as being the primary source 
of fraud in a business. But we do want to reinforce a key financial control, 
segregation of duties, in which the objective is to separate the parties that 
prepare information from the parties that control/manage company assets to 
implement a simple yet very effective check and balance. The goal is to avoid 
being a victim of one of those classic stories we’ve all heard too often where 
the accountant of 20 years (you know, the little old bookkeeper), as reliable 
and dedicated as you could ever hope, has just made off with tens of thou­
sands of your hard-earned dollars.
The last issue that needs to be addressed before opening an account is deter­
mining who in the business will have check-signing authority. Consider two 
key concepts when making this decision. First, the signers on the accounts 
should be independent from the parties preparing and processing the docu­
mentation requiring payments. The accounting department usually prepares 
and processes the documentation, so personnel in that department (the 
bookkeeper, controller, CFO, and others) should not have check-signing 
authority. This separation is an internal control to help protect company 
assets by reducing the opportunity for fraud. Second, the signers on the 
account should be in senior roles to ensure that proper review and approval 
are being completed before checks are signed.
	
Most companies employ a dual check-signing requirement when payments 
are above a certain level. For example, when payments exceed $10,000, two 
signatures are required to ensure that the expense is properly reviewed and 
approved. Getting two sets of eyes on large payments provides an additional 
level of control to safeguard company assets against large or material errors 
or irregularities.
	
Being a signer on a bank account represents a significant responsibility that 
carries with it additional exposure and potential liabilities. For example, if 
a company fails to remit payroll taxes, the IRS will look to all parties who 
were responsible for remitting the taxes to pursue collection efforts, which 
includes company officers, senior management, and potentially all signers on 
bank accounts. So before you choose parties to act as signers or accept this 
responsibility, think carefully, because this function is best left to the owners, 
officers, and/or senior management team (the parties within the business with 
the most to gain, the most at risk, and the most business experience).
Controlling cash and bank accounts
After the bank accounts have been established, the next order of business is 
to make sure proper controls have been established to protect and safeguard 
this business asset. The following list of basic cash and bank account con­
trols outline the bare minimum of controls needed:

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
253
 Chapter 12: Covering the Basics of Cash and Cash Activity
	
✓	Securing bank instruments and documentation: At all times, all bank 
instruments — account numbers, blank checks, facsimile signature 
stamps, statements, original agreements, and/or any other type of docu­
mentation — should be kept under lock and key, accessible only by 
authorized company personnel.
	
✓	Performing periodic bank reconciliations: On a periodic basis (usually 
monthly), an independent party should reconcile all bank account state­
ments against the general ledger. In addition, a member of senior man­
agement should then review and approve the reconciliation.
	
✓	Auditing and balancing cash activity: In situations where cash is 
actively used in the business (like a retail business), a daily balancing of 
cash on hand against a sales report can control the physical handling of 
cash. The party handling the cash (for instance, a checkout employee) 
balances the cash in her drawer against a computer report generated for 
the period of time she worked to make sure that the cash sales reported 
agree with the cash in the draw (accounting for beginning balances and 
other adjustments). By implementing a frequent balancing procedure, 
any discrepancies can be quickly identified and addressed.
	
✓	Monitoring petty cash: Most companies have a small petty cash fund 
for use on discretionary purchases (like if the office manager wants to 
buy everyone lunch for a job well done). Although petty cash balances 
tend to be small, parties that have access to them tend to use the petty 
cash as their own personal slush fund. To manage this misuse, first, give 
access to petty cash only to responsible parties. Second, require that 
all disbursements from petty cash be supported by a receipt. And third, 
order a periodic audit/reconciliation of petty cash to make sure that 
leakage is not occurring.
	
✓	Implementing flash reports: Flash reports, high-frequency reports that 
provide a quick snapshot or summary of critical business information 
and results, are a very effective tool for managing and controlling cash. 
A simple example of flash reporting is having a sequenced bank report 
setup whereby all activity for a period of time (say, a week) is reported 
to management, independent of the accounting function. Managers can 
then review the report and, if needed, compare it against internal com­
pany information to determine if it’s reasonable. Before the digital age, 
this type of control wasn’t efficient to implement, but today pushing 
critical information out in a real-time fashion is easy and encouraged by 
banks to help prevent and detect fraud.
	
✓	Limiting access to bank accounts and information: In the digital era we 
all live and operate within, bank accounts and information are available 
at the touch of a button (just like about everything else). Keeping tight 
control on who has access to the bank account information and requir­
ing passwords to be changed on a frequent basis are necessary controls.

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
254
Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
	
✓	Using other basic controls as relevant: Other basic controls may be 
appropriate for your company, depending on what kind of business you 
engage in. For instance, many companies use lock-box accounts through 
which customers remit payments directly to a bank, which then receives 
the check, deposits it, and reports the payment information back to the 
company (to update the accounting records). This control prevents 
company personnel from handling (or mishandling) customer checks. 
Also, stop payments are basically used by most companies at one time 
or another to request that the bank stop payment on an issued check 
before it is cashed (or relieved from the bank account). These occur for 
various reasons (for example, a customer never received payment for 
invoices that were lost in the mail, so a new check is issued) but should 
be administered by the appropriate personnel.
	
The digital age has pushed banking into real time. Gone are the days of issu­
ing checks and knowing that you have seven business days before they clear 
(to use the float or retain the luxury of issuing a stop-payment request on 
the check). Today, check information is captured and processed extremely 
quickly, so businesses must establish controls to make sure that when a 
check or payment is made, it is valid and has little or no chance of needing to 
be changed. These days, after the check or money has left the house, it isn’t 
coming back.
Maximizing your business’s cash
Generally, most businesses don’t sit on large stockpiles of cash wondering 
what to do with their vast riches. But when excess cash does become avail­
able, you can use a number of strategies, including the four that follow, to 
help improve and enhance operating results:
	
✓	Compensating balances: Just about every business incurs bank fees in 
one fashion or another. One way to help reduce bank fees is by main­
taining what’s called a compensating balance. That is, if a general operat­
ing account (that doesn’t earn any interest) is kept at a certain level, the 
bank calculates what the cash in the account would have earned and 
then credits your bank fees by this amount. These compensating bal­
ances can help reduce bank fees when slightly higher balances are kept 
in non-interest-bearing accounts (such as a general operating account or 
payroll account). To determine if a compensating balance agreement for 
your business makes sense, you should approach your bank and request 
that an analysis be completed. If it looks like it will save you money, then 
ask your friendly banker to set this service up.
	
	Banks are constantly looking for new revenue sources, and bank fees 
have been a prime tool over the past three years. Today, banks charge 
for just about everything, ranging from issuing fees for online banking 
and electronic payments to charging for each check that clears. But 
remember, these fees are often negotiable, so don’t be bashful about 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
255
 Chapter 12: Covering the Basics of Cash and Cash Activity
approaching the bank about reducing the fees. For strong customers, 
the banks make a significant amount of money from managing your cash 
and bank accounts, so requesting discounts on fees is reasonable.
	
✓	Implementing sweep accounts/ZBAs (zero balance accounts): Sweep 
accounts and ZBAs are often used by larger, slightly more sophisticated 
companies with multiple locations and bank accounts. A sweep account 
allows a business to “sweep” excess cash from multiple operating 
accounts into a centralized account. This sweeping event then usually 
produces excess cash, which can be used to either pay down borrow­
ings on a line of credit (to reduce interest expense) or invested in a 
money-market account (to earn interest). In coordination with using a 
sweep account, ZBAs are frequently used as well. A ZBA basically keeps 
the balance of the account at zero per the bank. Any time a check or 
payment clears the account, money is swept in from the central account 
to cover the obligation. ZBAs provide the dual assistance of using inter­
nal cash as efficiently as possible and providing an additional internal 
control: Fraud and theft are less likely when the account appears to 
have zero cash available.
	
✓	Leveraging the float: A cash float occurs when a business issues checks 
on Friday that don’t clear until the next Friday. In theory, the business 
has the use of these funds for a short period of time until the recipient 
actually cashes the checks. If $20,000 of checks have been issued but 
not yet cleared the bank, cash float explains why the company’s cash 
balance per its books may state that $15,000 is available whereas the 
bank balance shows $35,000 available. Years ago, numerous businesses 
used this strategy to help finance their operations — they had using the 
float down to an art form. Today, using the float is more difficult. Given 
the advent of digital technology, check information is now captured 
much quicker and clears the issuing company’s bank account must 
faster. However, in certain industries the float is alive and well and used 
actively to help finance business operations.
	
✓	Using lock boxes: As discussed in “Controlling cash and bank accounts,” 
companies can use bank-provided lockboxes to process checks paid to 
the company and eliminate internal handling. Lockboxes also provide 
another advantage in that they can often result in customer’s payments 
being received and processed more quickly (thus providing your busi­
ness with the use of cash sooner). Although the processing may be only 
a day or two sooner, for larger companies, having access to the extra 
cash quicker can result in improved operating performances.
Understanding Cash in the Digital Age
The digital age has truly transformed how businesses operate in today’s highly 
competitive business environment. The practice in the good old days of call­
ing your accounting department to prepare a report and then providing a fax

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
number to send the information has been replaced by accessing an app (or 
application) on your 4G cellphone or tablet computer that lets you obtain 
and manage critical business data (in as close to real time as possible). Okay, 
this example may be a slight exaggeration, as most businesses still operate by 
using the old brick-and-mortar method of e-mailing reports or files over the 
Internet for access in a computing environment. But the evolution and innova­
tion of technology will without question push the distribution of accounting 
and financial information to an entirely new level over the next decade.
And yes, digital advances will have a profound impact on cash, both in terms 
of how cash payments and transactions are processed and, more important, 
in how cash and bank accounts need to be managed and controlled. In the 
digital age, when an electronic payment is processed, it basically is gone 
from your account at that moment, so if it is incorrect, you’ve just given cash 
to a third party (and out of your control). In the olden days, if a check was 
cut on Friday and did not clear the bank until the middle of the next week, 
you still had 72 hours to react and potentially place a stop payment on the 
check. If you let your guard down, just for a moment, cash can, per the words 
of Warden Norton in The Shawshank Redemption, “Vanish like a fart in the 
wind.”
	
Most businesses rely on external professionals to support, maintain, and 
manage complex business issues (for example, taxation issues are usually best 
supported by a qualified and experienced CPA firm). Understanding cash in 
the digital age is one of those complex issues. The complexities surrounding 
electronic cash transactions are numerous. One of the best sources of advice 
and support for managing electronic cash transactions are banks, given their 
experience with and knowledge about processing just about every type of 
cash-based transaction used by businesses today. Your company should work 
closely with its primary bank to ensure that cash is both protected and man­
aged as effectively as possible.
Moving and processing cash 
transactions electronically
With the exception of using cold, hard cash in a business transaction, the 
first thing to remember about cash is that basically every other type or form 
of cash payment, from wires to credit cards, represents an electronic trans­
action. Even the use of checks has moved into the electronic age; the critical 
information provided on a check, such as the payee, payer, amount, check 
number, date, and bank account information, is now often captured electroni­
cally by various parties involved in the process (from the end recipient to the 
banks processing the check).

type of electronic payment are listed.
Table 12-1	
Types of Electronic Payment
Type of 
Payment
Pros/Uses
Cons
ACH (auto­
mated clearing 
house)
Most commonly used to sup­
port bulk or batch payment 
processing. Best suited for 
larger organizations with 
high volumes of payment 
transactions to process (like 
government-initiated payments 
for Social Security, which pro­
cess millions of payments each 
month without actually issuing 
a check but uses ACH to credit 
the recipient’s bank account).
A somewhat more-com­
plicated system, basically 
administered by Federal 
Reserve Banks. Not 
well suited to individual 
electronic payments for 
infrequent or one-time 
payments, because it 
takes a little more effort to 
set up and establish the 
payment logistics.
EFT (electronic 
funds trans­
fer), including 
direct deposits 
and electronic 
checks
Efficient, easy to use after 
established with the bank, 
and reduces expenses with 
traditional check writing. Often 
used with recurring disburse­
ments (such as direct deposit 
for the weekly payroll).
Debits or reduces the pay­
er’s account immediately, 
reducing the ability to use 
the float. Added controls 
required to ensure that 
access is limited to appro­
priate personnel. 
Wires (a form 
of electronic 
funds transfer)
Offers increased controls 
because each transaction 
tends to be individualized. 
Generally used for nonrecur­
ring transactions and foreign-
payment processing.

Type of 
Payment
Pros/Uses
Cons
Credit cards
Offer ease of processing, 
an easy way to finance pur­
chases, fraud protection and 
payment return services, and 
a chance to earn “points” (for 
example, for travel). They’re 
widely accepted, and, on the 
receipt side, they accelerate 
customer payments.
For businesses that 
accept credit card pay­
ments: Fees range from 
2 to 4 percent, liability is 
increased due to the need 
to keep information (like 
card numbers) confiden­
tial, establishing merchant 
accounts with financial 
institutions can be time 
consuming, and personal 
guarantees are required 
to protect against fraudu­
lent charges.
Debit cards
Easy to use and, unlike credit 
cards, limit purchasers to 
spending only what’s avail­
able in their checking account. 
Ideally suited to companies 
that sell to consumers and 
need to accept debit cards as 
an alternative form of payment.
Same as the cons for 
credit cards. In addition, 
has increased risks asso­
ciated with giving other 
parties direct access to 
bank account. Generally 
not used extensively in the 
business community to 
process payments. 
A number of new and innovative types of electronic payment processing 
are becoming imbedded in the mainstream including using PayPal and pre­
paid (and rechargeable) debit cards, and, soon to be appearing at a store 
near you, swiping your cellphone to process payment. These forms of elec­
tronic payment are still emerging and tend to be based more in the BtoC 
ecommerce market (business to consumer) rather than BtoB (business to 
business). However, there can be no doubt that these forms of electronic 
payments will continue to grow in popularity, so adapting your business to 
accept these types of payments should be undertaken. (But be sure to work 
with only the most reputable third-party clearing companies and have a clear 
understanding of the fees charged.)
	
If your business hasn’t already done so, now is the time to fully embrace the 
use of electronic cash. Developing and implementing the systems, controls, 
policies, and procedures to handle any form of electronic cash carries the fol­
lowing three critical advantages:

 Chapter 12: Covering the Basics of Cash and Cash Activity
	
✓	Reduced expenses: Internal costs associated with security, supplies, 
mailings, and so on can be reduced.
	
✓	Improved performance and efficiency: Cash can generally be received 
and put to use quicker when electronic payment systems are properly 
implemented and utilized.
	
✓	Lowering fraud: When properly implemented and managed, electronic 
payments can reduce fraud by limiting the number of parties handling 
cash and by utilizing advanced fraud protection features available in the 
electronic environment.
	
Banks are starting to require businesses to implement fraud prevention tools 
to lower overall risks. Businesses may be held liable for fraudulent transactions 
if the bank has provided the tools necessary to prevent fraud but the business 
either doesn’t elect to incorporate the tools or doesn’t properly use the tools. 
Granted, this type of legal action is rare, but business owners need to be aware 
of the risks associated with not evolving with the market.
Considering the use of checks
The trend in business is definitely away from checks and toward electronic 
cash as a means to improve business efficiencies, reduce fraud, and lower 
business risks. In Corporate America, electronic cash has become the norm, 
so if you’re looking to conduct any type of significant business with the 
Fortune 500 companies, be prepared to accept and remit by using electronic 
methods.
Even in the general population, the use of checks has greatly diminished over 
the past decade, with more customers using online electronic checks, debit 
cards, credit cards, and other forms of electronic cash (like PayPal) to pro­
cess payments. Most small- to medium-size businesses will have to continue 
processing payments by check for the foreseeable future because some cus­
tomers are still paying with checks. But the message is loud and clear: You’d 
better already be on the electronic-cash train, ’cause it has left the station.
Establishing cash controls in electronic-
based accounting systems
Ten years ago, I would have titled this section of the book “Establishing cash 
controls in computer-based accounting systems,” because the concepts of 
cloud computing, virtual companies, freely portable accounting systems, 
and the like really didn’t exist. At the turn of the millennium, the world was 
really just being introduced to the dot-com boom-and-bust cycle and was 
busy working through Y2K issues, while social media, mobile networking, and

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
cloud computing were concepts left for science fiction writers. What a differ­
ence ten years makes. Today, the dot-com era represents a distant memory 
(or for some, a forgettable nightmare) replaced by the world of instant 
mobile communication, cloud computing, and highly portable/on-demand 
information.
	
To begin this discussion on establishing controls over cash in an electronic 
environment, you need to understand that the same fundamentals of controls 
apply whether you’re controlling cash in a traditional manual environment or 
in an electronic environment. (Refer to the earlier section “Controlling cash 
and bank accounts” for an overview of the fundamental practices.) Beyond 
these basic fundamentals, companies actively use the following additional 
controls, policies, and procedures to manage and protect cash in an electronic 
environment:
	
✓	Access to and use of passwords: Password protection in the digital 
age is absolutely critical to ensure that vital/confidential information is 
properly protected. Passwords should also limit who can access and 
manipulate company bank accounts and process payments. Require 
frequent password updates. In addition, your business should also set 
up logs or run reports that track logins, implementation of positive con­
firmation on password changes, and the location of the accessing com­
puter or mobile source. Banks and financial institutions aggressively use 
algorithms to monitor and track unusual activity in bank accounts and 
credit cards, and your business should tap that source when the situa­
tion warrants.
	
✓	Flash and exception reports (testing the system): Various reporting 
tools are available to help manage and control bank accounts and cash 
levels. Just like a weekly sales flash report is generated to report on how 
the company performed during the past week, the same type of report 
can be generated to monitor cash levels (focusing on activity out of 
the norm). In addition, exception reporting can be used to identify any 
trends or activity that may indicate a problem. For example, manage­
ment may want to be informed of any changes in employee compensa­
tion levels from the prior period (as provided by a payroll service) to 
ensure all changes were approved. With bank accounts, reports can be 
generated and provided that list any check over, say, $5,000 that cleared 
the bank account. Needless to say, these reports are unique to each 
business in terms of what information is critical and/or at the highest 
risk for fraud or mismanagement. Management should determine what 
information is needed and then develop and implement proactive tools 
to prevent problems from arising.
	
✓	Positive pay and other bank tools: Banks offer a number of tools and 
resources to help manage electronic cash transactions. One such tool 
that a number of companies use is most commonly referred to as posi­
tive pay. Positive pay reports to the bank all checks a company gener­
ated from its system in real time. Software sits on top of your company’s 
accounting system and captures any check and payment information

261
 Chapter 12: Covering the Basics of Cash and Cash Activity
processed (so the bank has a record of what you approved). When 
checks or payments are presented to the bank for payment, the check 
is matched against the positive pay report to ensure that the check is 
valid. If not, the bank notifies your company of the discrepancy and the 
company indicates whether the check should be accepted or rejected. 
Other examples of bank management tools include using “push” reports 
(reports generated by the bank and pushed out to the customers) to 
notify customers of the latest electronic scams and fraud schemes and 
developing complex algorithms which track customer payment trends 
and credit card charges habits (to identify anything out of the ordinary 
which may indicate that fraud has been committed).
	
✓	Advanced controls for checks: While the electronic age continues to 
transform the movement of cash, the tried-and-true method of using 
checks isn’t going away anytime soon. However, generating checks 
has evolved in the electronic age. Formerly, businesses would order 
preprinted checks from a supplier or the bank and then insert them 
into the printer when checks needed to processed. Today, blank check 
stock is received from the supplier, and when checks are printed, all the 
vital information is printed at the same time (such as the bank routing 
and account numbers, payee, payer, and check number). The check is 
printed with special MICR toner (that is, magnetically readable toner 
that the bank’s computers can read and process) on special fraud-
prevention paper (using watermarks and other distinctive features). 
Not only do these steps help with fraud prevention (because now a pre­
printed check can’t be stolen and filled out with fraudulent information), 
but they also improve the bank’s efficiency in reading and processing 
checks (because all the information has been magnetically encoded).
	
	An even further advancement in the check printing world is to use 
remote check printing. This feature allows a company to pay its vendor 
by processing a check payment that actually prints at the customer’s 
site (on their printer), using a computer generated signature or fac­
simile. This strategy is best used for larger relationships where frequent 
payments are made and carries numerous advantages including reduc­
ing costs (no mailing required) and handling risks.
	
✓	Using prepaid debit cards: Prepaid debit cards are a growing form of 
control over electronic cash. One of their most common uses is for 
employee paychecks in cases where the employee doesn’t have a bank 
account. Surprisingly, roughly 20 percent of the population doesn’t 
use regular bank accounts and direct deposit but rather receives a live 
check, cashes it, and then pays bills with either cash or by purchasing 
money orders. Prepaid debit cards allow the employee to have his card 
“recharged” on the pay date so that the card carries a balance that can 
be spent. The card is safer than carrying cash because if the card is lost 
or stolen, it can be cancelled and another card issued (as long as the 
PIN is protected). Prepaid cards can also be used in a number of other 
areas, such as parents providing a set level of spending for their college 
student (usually quickly reached).

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
What should be clear from these bullet points is that working with your bank 
is very important in terms of implementing the proper controls, policies, and 
procedures to protect cash in an electronic environment. Fraud (including 
bad checks and credit card theft) remains a significant expense for banks and 
financial institutions, resulting in billions of dollars of losses over the years. 
And if fraud is costing the bank money, then it’s costing you money, because 
the bank makes up for these losses or expenses by either charging your busi­
ness higher fees or paying lower interest rates (on investable cash balances).
	
Managing and controlling cash in the electronic age requires a partnership 
between you, your bank, and critical customers and creditors. Your business 
needs to be proactive in implementing necessary controls because you can’t 
assume that a bank is going to protect your interests at all times. The banks 
are smart, but the crooks are usually smarter (and often one step ahead when 
committing theft and fraud). Assuming that a third party is going to protect 
your business interests is often the source of unnecessary heartburn and the 
mother of all headaches.
Working with Cash as a 
Key Business Indicator
Chapters 8 and 9 of this book provide an in-depth discussion and overview 
of the business-planning process, including developing financial projection 
models — which, of course, includes forecasting critical cash information 
(that is, sources, uses, and available balances). Keep in mind that when bud­
geting cash, it tends to become a “forced” number in the financial forecasts. 
That is, after all other assumptions have been built into company projections 
and forecasts — items such as how long it will take to collect receivables, 
how much needs to be invested in fixed assets, whether the business will 
need to borrow from a bank this year, and so on — cash levels or balances 
are forced into the balance sheet so that it can balance. For example, a 
jewelry retailer will ramp inventory levels and gear up promotional efforts 
to support the holiday selling season which starts in mid to late November 
and runs through the end of the year. So cash balances tend to be very low 
at the end of October as the company has deployed cash for the benefit of 
the holiday season (so a low cash balance is expected or forced into the bal­
ance sheet). However, by the end of December, cash balances should reach 
extremely healthy levels as inventory has been reduced via high holiday 
sales levels (thus the high cash balance is forced into the balance sheet). The 
key isn’t so much that cash balances went from extremely low levels in late 
October to the highest level of the year in late December but rather did the 
cash perform as expected against management’s internal forecasts.

263
 Chapter 12: Covering the Basics of Cash and Cash Activity
Of course, the forced cash balance may or may not be a desirable outcome; 
it may be too low or even negative (relative to the desired cash levels needed 
to operate a business). If cash levels are too low, your business should imme­
diately view it as a red flag in terms of making sure management has a plan 
developed to address any potential cash squeezes that may occur.
	
Think ahead, very far ahead, when developing a plan to make sure that plenty 
of cash or access to cash will be available to support your business. In today’s 
unsettled and competitive capital markets, securing cash from external 
sources (such as banks and investors) to support your business operations 
is a very time-consuming and lengthy process that can easily take three to six 
months or longer, depending on the source of the cash.
Knowing the seasonal 
ebb and flow of cash
Most financial projections prepared by businesses tend to follow a fairly 
similar pattern. Unless the economy is crashing (a la 2009), the goal for most 
businesses is to increase sales and improve profits. For example, a business 
unit may set a target of increasing sales by 15 percent for the year and profits 
by 20 percent in order to meet senior management’s expectations. Instead 
of diving into all the fundamentals and strategies associated with preparing 
financial forecasts (covered extensively in Chapters 8 and 9), this section 
focuses on various seasonal factors and events (when viewed on an annual 
basis) that can significantly impact short-term cash flows and availability. Or 
looking at it from another perspective, if proper planning is not completed 
and adequate cash resources are not available to build inventory and pro­
mote sales (during a busy season), then sales will be negatively impacted (by 
not having the proper inventory available), which in turn will result in lower 
profits.
Very few if any businesses experience linear increases (or, for that matter, 
decreases) in sales, profitability, and cash flows over a 12-month period. This 
perfect world just doesn’t exist for 99 percent of businesses, because they 
are always encountering events, transactions, external influences, and so on 
that have a material effect on cash flows and cash availability on a quarterly, 
monthly, or in some cases weekly basis. So because cash levels can vary 
significantly in a very short period of time, your business should always be 
prepared for trouble.
Recognizing the events that cause cash-flow variation
Although a number of factors and events can impact cash flows and availabil­
ity over a year, most fall into one of the following three categories:

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
264
Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
	
✓	The four seasons: A large number of companies build their business 
models around the four seasons of the calendar year, and changes in the 
season can significantly impact cash levels. For a jewelry company, the 
Christmas holiday rush, which last about six weeks a year, can produce 
as much as 35 percent of the entire sales for the year. In late October, 
just prior to the Christmas holiday season, cash levels decrease because 
cash has been spent on inventory that needs to be on the shelves for 
consumers to buy. However, in late December or early January, cash bal­
ances skyrocket due to the Christmas buying binge. To an uneducated 
party evaluating cash positions at these two points in time, the company 
looks to be in trouble in October, whereas at the end of December, the 
company looks to be very strong.
	
✓	The government: Rules and regulations established by the government 
can often create significant short-term impacts on cash flows and avail­
ability. A perfect example is the timing of quarterly estimated income 
tax payments. For regular C corporations, these tax payments fall on 
the 15th of the 4th, 6th, 9th, and 12th month of the corporation’s fiscal 
year end. (For example, a calendar-year-ending fiscal year would make 
estimated payments on 4/15, 6/15, 9/15, and 12/15.) So for two months 
during the quarter, no estimated income tax payments are due, but in 
the third month, a large payment is made. Other examples of how the 
government can impact short-term cash flows and availability include 
unemployment insurance (due on the last day of the month following 
each calendar quarter end), remittances for sales and use taxes col­
lected (which may vary from monthly to annually, depending on how 
much is due), and paying for licenses and permits in advance.
	
	A very distinct trend is taking hold in states, cities, counties, and local 
municipalities in the United States. If you haven’t heard, most of these 
entities are out of money. So not only are they looking for ways to 
increase revenues (for example, by raising sales tax rates), they are also 
looking for ways to accelerate payments (from businesses to govern­
ments). Paying more and quicker is a trend that you should anticipate to 
continue for years to come, so when creating a financial forecast, incor­
porate events that will accelerate the flow of cash from your business to 
the government.
	
✓	The company itself: Most businesses over a period of time develop spe­
cific policies, procedures, and operating structures that create peaks and 
valleys of cash flows and availability. Some companies may look to retool 
with new equipment during a particularly slow period. Other companies 
may accrue employee bonuses during the year and then pay them in a 
lump sum around Christmas of each year. Some companies may have a 
significant loan payment due as a result of a note payable executed three 
years earlier. The list of company-specific influences on cash are endless, 
but the same basic management concept applies to all: Managers who 
prepare the budget must have a clear understanding of these influences 
and must account for them in the annual budgeting process.

 Chapter 12: Covering the Basics of Cash and Cash Activity
Staggering cash flow
Staggering is a practice that attempts to budget cash needs on a more even 
basis during the year. Staggering cash inflows and outflows to smooth them 
out on an annual basis can be a very effective management tool.
For example, if a business has to commit cash for new equipment purchases, 
it should plan to do it at a time when business won’t be disrupted by the cash 
drain. The business can even out cash flows by budgeting for the purchase 
in a month that doesn’t require other significant cash outlays (for example, 
not when the business has to build inventory levels to support seasonal sales 
and pay estimated taxes).
Business can also stagger cash flows when paying commissions. Rather than 
pay commissions when the sale has occurred, a number of companies pay 
commissions when the cash is actually received from the customer. Not only 
does this staggering help match the cash outflow with the cash inflow, but 
it also gives sales representatives an incentive to make sure that customers 
pay in a timely fashion.
Setting periodic cash level benchmarks
A very simple cycle to remember is that starting a business takes cash. The 
cash, when secured, is then deployed in the business via realizing expenses, 
investing in assets, generating sales, paying obligations, and hopefully 
producing net earnings or profit. The goal is to have the profits eventually 
turned back into cash so the cycle can start all over again. This cycle con­
firms the discussion at the beginning of this chapter about how basically 
all business transactions eventually end up in cash (either increasing or 
decreasing). So cash is a logical critical internal management benchmark 
on which to evaluate a company’s performance. However, like most bench­
marks, this one should be used with other critical benchmarks to properly 
evaluate a business’s performance.
	
Businesses use all kinds of operating metrics as benchmarks to evaluate their 
performance. Classic examples include comparing a weekly sales report trend­
ing the last four weeks to a report from the like period for the prior year, cal­
culating inventory turnover ratios for each company product and comparing 
the turns to the prior year, and so on. However, most small companies don’t 
use cash benchmarks to help evaluate and manage their businesses. Seeing 
that most small businesses struggle with even putting together a statement 
of cash flows, it’s no wonder that using cash as a critical benchmark is quite 
often overlooked.

266
Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
When using cash as a benchmark, two underlying concepts are important to 
understand to extract the most value from this benchmark to assist in man­
aging your business:
	
✓	Use cash as a canary in the coal mine. Cash is a great tool to use in 
the capacity of a canary in the coal mine (that is, as an early warning 
system), because if cash levels are significantly different than expected, 
it almost always indicates that a more significant issue or problem 
exists with the performance of other assets, liabilities, or the company’s 
profitability.
	
	When cash benchmarks are established, they’re generally based on 
either internal or external data points. External benchmarks (that is, 
comparing your business’s cash to that of other businesses in the same 
industry) should be used with an abundance of caution. Even with com­
panies operating in the same industry, capital structures, strategic busi­
ness plans, and internal policies can differ greatly, having a significant 
impact on cash flows and cash availability. So although “best-in-class” 
external benchmarks for cash can be informative, avoid drawing conclu­
sions based on this benchmark alone. Internal benchmarks are often 
much more informative. Cash benchmarks have the most value when 
they’re driven from asking why cash balances or internal cash flows may 
be varying so significantly from budgeted levels.
	
✓	Implement cash flash reporting at all costs. Every business owner and 
manager needs to monitor operating performances with the use of infor­
mation provided through reports. Traditional reports such as monthly 
financial statements or sales by product lines are helpful but incom­
plete. The implementation of high-frequency flash reporting is becoming 
more and more important for businesses so that key operating metrics 
can be monitored very closely. Cash is especially important to monitor 
frequently because having a solid handle on weekly (or in some cases, 
daily) cash inflows and outflows can highlight a problem much quicker 
(allowing management to respond faster) than waiting until the end of 
the month.

Preventing Cash Losses from 
Embezzlement and Fraud
In This Chapter

▶	Checking out the internal control checklist
▶	Realizing the limits of internal controls
W

hen the infamous bank robber Willie Sutton was asked why he 
robbed banks, he’s reputed to have said, “Because that’s where the 
money is!” The cash flows of a business are a natural target for schemers who 
see an opportunity to siphon off some cash from these streams of money. 
The grandfather and father-in-law of the authors — who was a very success­
ful businessman — told us that there’s a little bit of larceny in everyone’s 
heart. Well, perhaps not everybody — but enough people that a business 
should be worried.
Making a profit is hard enough as it is. There’s no excuse for letting some of 
your profit slip away because you didn’t take appropriate precautions. You 
don’t leave the keys in your car, do you? You lock your car and make it dif­
ficult to steal. Likewise, you shouldn’t leave the keys to your business’s cash 
flow lying around. This chapter discusses controls and preventive measures 
that a business should consider adopting in order to prevent and mitigate 
cash losses from dishonest schemes by employees, customers, and other 
parties it deals with.
	
This chapter is directed to business managers; it is not a detailed reference 
for accountants. The chapter takes the broader management view, whereas 
accountants take a narrower view. Accountants focus on preventing errors 
that may creep into the accounting system of the business and quickly detect­
ing errors if they get by the first line of controls. In addition to these internal 
accounting controls, the accounting department typically has responsibility 
for many of the other controls discussed in this chapter, as we cover in the 
sections that deal with particular controls.

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
Setting the Stage for Protection
We start with the reasonable premise that the large majority of people are 
honest most of the time. You can argue that some people are entirely honest 
all the time, but realistically this assumption is too risky when running a busi­
ness. In short, a business has to deal with the dishonesty of the few. A busi­
ness cannot afford to assume that all the people it deals with are trustworthy 
all the time. Fraud against business is a fact of life. One function of business 
managers is to prevent fraud against their business, and it should go without 
saying that managers should not commit fraud on behalf of the business. 
(But some do, of course.)
A business is vulnerable to many kinds of fraud from many directions — 
customers who shoplift, employees who steal money and other assets from 
the business, vendors who overcharge, managers who accept kickbacks and 
bribes, and so on. The threat of fraud is ever present for all businesses, large 
and small. No one tells a business in advance that they intend to engage 
in fraud against the business, and compounding the problem is that many 
people who commit fraud are pretty good at concealing it.
So every business should institute and enforce internal controls that are 
effective in preventing fraud. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of 
cure. Keep in mind the difference between controls designed primarily to 
stop fraud (such as employee theft) versus procedures designed to prevent 
errors from creeping into the accounting system. Both types of precau­
tions are important. Even if it prevents theft, a business may lose money if 
it doesn’t have accounting controls to ensure that its financial records are 
accurate, timely, and complete.
On the police TV series Hill Street Blues, the last thing the desk sergeant 
would tell the patrol officers before they went out to their beats each night 
was, “Be careful out there.” Good advice too for a business and its internal 
controls!
Preventing loss with internal controls
The procedures and processes that a business uses to prevent cash losses 
from embezzlement, fraud, and other kinds of dishonesty go under the gen­
eral term internal controls. Internal means that the controls are instituted and 
implemented by the business. Many internal controls are directed toward the 
business’s own employees to discourage them from taking advantage of their 
positions of trust and authority in the business to embezzle money or to help 
others cheat the business.

269
 Chapter 13: Preventing Cash Losses from Embezzlement and Fraud
	
Many internal controls are directed toward the outside parties that the busi­
ness deals with, including customers (some who may shoplift) and vendors 
(some who may double bill the business for one purchase). In short, the term 
internal controls includes the whole range of preventive tactics and proce­
dures used by a business to protect its cash flows and other assets.
Some businesses put the risk of cash losses from fraud near the bottom of 
their risk ranking. They downgrade these potential cash seepages to a low 
priority. Accordingly, they are likely to think that internal controls take too 
much time and cost too much. Most businesses, however, take the middle 
road and assume that certain basic internal controls are necessary and 
cost effective — because without the controls, the business would suffer far 
greater losses that the cost of the internal controls.
	
Some companies boldly assume that the company’s internal controls are 100 
percent effective in preventing all embezzlement and fraud. A more realistic 
approach is to assume that some theft or fraud can slip by the first line of 
internal controls. Therefore, a business should install an additional layer of 
internal controls that come into play after transactions and activities have 
taken place. These after-the-fact internal controls serve as safety valves to 
catch a problem before it gets too far out of hand. The principle of having 
both kinds of controls is to deter and detect.
	
Certain internal controls are designed such that two or more persons would 
have to collude to commit and conceal the fraud. Collusion may or may not be 
an effective deterrent. The deterrent value of collusion may be compromised 
when two persons have a personal relationship unbeknownst to the business — 
for example, the two may be in a sexual relationship, or one may be buying 
drugs from the other, or one may be a cousin of the other. The ultimate deter­
rent to fraud is knowing that you will be caught if you do it. Even so, desperate 
people still take their chances of being caught, so if the collusion requirement 
doesn’t derail their plans, you can still try to detect them.
Recognizing the dual purpose of 
internal accounting controls
Many internal accounting controls consist of required forms that must be 
used and procedures that should be followed in authorizing and executing 
transactions and operations. A business’s accounting department records 
the financial activities and transactions. So, naturally, the accounting depart­
ment is put in charge of designing and enforcing many core internal controls. 
The accounting profession has a long history of involvement with internal 
controls.

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
	
Many accounting internal controls have both an accounting reliability purpose 
and an antifraud purpose. The business gets two for the price of one from 
these particular controls. For example, employees can be required to punch 
their timecards on a work clock as they start and end each day, or they can 
have their hours entered in a payroll log signed by their supervisor. This sort 
of internal control helps prevent employees from being paid for time they 
didn’t work. Also, the procedure tells the accountant which expense account 
to charge for their work and produces a record of the transaction that helps 
eliminate (or at least minimize) errors in capturing, processing, storing, and 
retrieving wage data needed for financial records. The accounting system of a 
business keeps track of the large amount of information needed in operating a 
business, and these internal controls are designed to ensure the accuracy, 
completeness, and timeliness of information held in the accounting system.
Internal accounting controls need to be kept up-to-date with changes in a 
business’s accounting system and procedures. For example, an entirely new 
set of internal controls had to be developed and installed as businesses con­
verted to computer-based accounting systems. Before then, the word hacker 
referred to a poor golfer, or duffer, not software code breakers who pose 
very sinister threats to companies’ computer systems. The transition to com­
puter and Internet-based accounting systems brought about a whole new set 
of internal accounting controls, to say nothing of all the other internal con­
trols a business had to install to protect its databases and communications.
Struggling with fraud committed 
by the business
There’s fraud against a business, and then there’s fraud by a business. The 
first type of fraud can be classified by who does it, and unfortunately, a busi­
ness is vulnerable to all kinds of fraud attacks from virtually everyone it 
deals with. This side of the coin includes all kinds of schemes and scams by 
vendors, employees, customers, and even one or more of the business’s own 
mid-level managers. The other side of the coin is the conscious behavior of 
the business itself that is sanctioned by top-level owner/managers.
Frankly, most discussions of business internal controls skirt around this sen­
sitive issue. Most articles and books assume that the business is as honest 
as the day is long. The discussion frames the business as an innocent target 
of employees, customers, and others who want to steal its money or other 
assets. But the truth of the matter is that some companies carry on unethi­
cal practices as their normal course of business, including bribing govern­
ment and regulatory officials, knowingly violating laws covering product and 
employee safety, failing to report information that is required to be disclosed, 
misleading employees regarding changes in their retirement plans, conspir­
ing with competitors to fix prices and divide territories, advertising falsely, 
treating employees with discrimination, and so on.

 Chapter 13: Preventing Cash Losses from Embezzlement and Fraud
Frauds perpetrated by businesses may very well be illegal under state and 
federal statutes and common law. Restitution for damages suffered from the 
fraud can be sought under the tort law system. The evidence is clear that 
many businesses deliberately and knowingly engage in fraudulent practices, 
and that their managers do not take action to stop it. Basically, managers are 
complicit in the fraud if they see fraud going on in the business but look the 
other way. The managers may not like it and not approve of it, but they often 
live with it due to unspoken pressure to follow the “three monkey” policy — 
see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.
The lenders and shareowners of a business should keep aware of the pos­
sibility of financial reporting fraud. The managers of a business may cook the 
books, resulting in seriously misleading financial reports. Independent CPA 
auditors test a company’s internal accounting controls that are designed to 
prevent financial reporting fraud. However, audits don’t catch all incidents 
of financial reporting fraud. This issue is beyond the scope of this chapter. 
For more on financial reporting fraud, refer to John A. Tracy’s How to Read a 
Financial Report, 7th Edition (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
	
If you ask a CPA to audit your financial statements, the CPA may have to 
refuse you as a new client (or dump you if you’re already a client) if your 
internal controls are inadequate. If your internal controls are too weak, the 
CPA auditor can’t rely on your accounting records, from which your financial 
statements are prepared. And the CPA may have to withdraw from the engage­
ment if the auditor discovers high-level management fraud. Both authors have 
worked on audits in which serious management fraud was discovered. Our 
CPA firm walked off the audit (and immediately sent a bill to the ex-client). 
CPAs cannot knowingly be associated with crooks and businesses that oper­
ate with seriously weak internal controls.
	
Even businesses that routinely engage in shady practices should implement 
internal controls. In fact, operating on the wrong side of the road may make 
the business more aware of the need for internal controls, and it makes the 
business more vulnerable to fraud. Employees, customers, and others the 
business deals with are not fools; they’re generally aware of what’s going on. 
And fraud begets fraud. If employees or people doing business with the com­
pany see fraudulent practices sanctioned by top-level managers, the natural 
inclination is to respond in kind, adopting an attitude of entitlement and doing 
some fraud of their own. And they may be very good at it.
In the following discussion of internal controls, we assume that the business 
is behaving ethically, that the people it conducts business with (employees, 
customers, and so on) are treated fairly, and that the managers have not 
cooked the books. We assume that the business is not facing a generally 
hostile or “let’s get even” attitude on the part of its employees, customers, 
vendors, and so on. In other words, we assume that the business faces the 
normal sort of risks of cash losses from fraud that every business encoun­
ters. We don’t discuss extraordinary safety measures that a business operat­
ing in a high-crime area may have to use (like armed guards at doors).

Putting Internal Controls to Work
In this section we discuss important steps and guideposts that apply to virtu­
ally all businesses in establishing and managing internal controls. You find 
out both what kinds of tools are available to protect your business and what 
particulars you need to consider when choosing and using them.
Because this chapter is directed to business managers, not accountants, 
we don’t delve into the details of internal accounting controls. If you or 
your accountant wants to find out more about internal controls, we recom­
mend that you go to the websites of the Institute of Internal Auditors (www.
theiia.org) and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
(www.aicpa.org). Both of these professional associations publish an exten­
sive number of books on internal controls.
	
In this chapter, we use the term fraud in its most comprehensive sense; the 
word covers the waterfront. It includes all types of cheating, stealing, and dis­
honest behavior by anyone inside the business and by anyone outside that the 
business deals with. Examples range from petty theft and pilferage to divert­
ing millions of dollars into the pockets of high-level executives. Fraud includes 
shoplifting by customers, kickbacks from vendors to a company’s purchasing 
managers, embezzlements by trusted employees, padded expense reports 
submitted by salespersons, deliberate overcharging of customers, and so on. A 
comprehensive list of business fraud examples would fill an encyclopedia.
Going down the internal controls checklist
Businesses have a large and diverse toolbox of internal controls to choose 
from. The following sections provide a checklist for managers in deciding on 
internal controls for their business.
Watching over high-risk areas
Strong and tight controls are needed in high-risk areas. Managers should 
identify which areas of the business are the most vulnerable to fraud against 
the business. The most likely fraud points in a business usually include the 
following areas (some businesses have other high-risk areas, of course):
	
✓	Cash receipts and disbursements
	
✓	Payroll (including workers’ compensation insurance fraud)
	
✓	Customer credit and collections, and writing off bad debts
	
✓	Purchasing and storage of inventory

 Chapter 13: Preventing Cash Losses from Embezzlement and Fraud
Separating duties
Where practicable, two or more independent employees should be 
involved in the authorization, documentation, execution, and recording of 
transactions — especially in the high-risk areas. This arrangement is called 
separation of duties, and the idea is to force collusion of two or more persons 
to carry out and conceal a fraud. For instance, two or more signatures should 
be required on checks over a certain amount. For another example, the 
employee preparing the receiving reports for goods and materials delivered 
to the company should not have any authority for issuing a purchase order 
and should not make the accounting entries for purchases. Concentration of 
duties in the hands of one person invites trouble. Duties should be divided 
among two or more employees, even if it causes some loss of efficiency.
Performing surprise audits
Making surprise counts, inspections, and reconciliations that employees 
cannot anticipate or plan for is very effective. Of course, the person or group 
doing these surprise audits should be independent of the employees who 
have responsibility for complying with the internal controls. For instance, 
a surprise count and inspection of products held in inventory may reveal 
missing products, unrecorded breakage and damage, products stored in the 
wrong locations, mislabeled products, or other problems. Such problems 
tend to get overlooked by busy employees, but inventory errors can also 
be evidence of theft. Many of these errors should be recorded as inventory 
losses but may not be if surprise audits are not done.
Letting employees blow the whistle
Encourage employees to report suspicions of fraud by anyone in the busi­
ness (which has to be done anonymously in most situations). Admittedly, 
this policy is tricky. You’re asking people to be whistle-blowers. Employees 
may not trust upper management; they may fear that they will face retaliation 
instead of being rewarded for revealing fraud. Employees generally don’t like 
being spies on each other, but on the other hand they want the business to 
take action against any employees who are committing fraud.
	
The business has to adopt procedures to safeguard anonymity that are con­
vincing to potential whistle-blowers. It also has to convince employees that 
they will not be ostracized if they report their suspicions. Frankly, a business 
may have to offer financial incentives to whistle-blowers to get them to take 
such a drastic action that could have serious repercussions over their future 
career with the company.
Leaving audit trails
Insist that good audit trails be created for all transactions. The documenta­
tion and recording of transactions should leave a clear path that can be 
followed back in time when necessary. Supporting documents should be 
organized in good order and should be retained for a reasonable period of

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
time. The Internal Revenue Service (www.irs.gov) publishes recommended 
guidelines for records retention, which are a good point of reference for a 
business.
Limiting access to accounting records and end-of-year entries
Access to all accounting records should be strictly limited to accounting per­
sonnel, and no one other than the accounting staff should be allowed to make 
entries or changes in the accounting records of the business. Of course, man­
agers and other employees may ask questions of the accounting staff, and 
they may ask for special reports on occasion. The accounting department 
can provide photocopies or scanned images of documents (purchase orders, 
sales invoices, and so on) in response to questions, but the accounting 
department should not let original source documents out of its possession.
Checking the background of new employees
Before any new employee is hired, management should have a thorough 
background check done on him, especially if he will be handling money and 
working in the high-fraud-risk areas of the business. Letters of reference from 
previous employers may not be enough. Databases are available to check 
on a person’s credit history, driving record, criminal record, workers’ com­
pensation insurance claims, and life insurance rejection record, but private 
investigators may have to be used for a thorough background check.
	
A business should consider doing more extensive background and character 
checks when hiring mid- and high-level managers. Studies have found that 
many manager applicants falsify their résumés and list college degrees that 
they in fact have not earned, and any dishonesty could very well be a bad 
omen about future conduct.
Periodically reviewing internal controls
Consider having an independent assessment done on your internal controls 
by a CPA or other professional specialist. This step may reveal that certain 
critical controls are missing, or, conversely, that you’re wasting money on 
ineffectual controls. If your business has an annual financial-report audit, the 
CPA auditor evaluates and tests your business’s internal controls. But you 
may need a more extensive and critical evaluation of your internal controls 
that looks beyond the internal accounting controls. See the earlier section 
“Struggling with fraud committed by the business” for more on the benefits 
and possible consequences of hiring an outside CPA.
Appraising key assets regularly
You should schedule regular “checkups” of your business’s receivables, 
inventory, and fixed assets. Generally speaking, over time these assets 
develop problems that are not dealt with in the daily hustle and bustle 
of activities and the time pressures on managers and other employees. 
Receivables may include seriously past-due balances, but these customers’

 Chapter 13: Preventing Cash Losses from Embezzlement and Fraud
credit may not have been suspended or terminated. Some products in inven­
tory may not have had a sale in months or years. Some items in fixed assets 
may have been abandoned or sold off for scrap value, yet the assets are still 
on the books and being depreciated.
One principle of accounting is that losses from asset impairments (damage, 
aging, salability, abandonment, and so on) should be recorded as soon as the 
diminishment in value occurs. The affected assets should be written off or 
the recorded (book) value of the assets should be written down to recognize 
the loss of economic value to the business. The decrease in asset value is 
recorded as a loss, which reduces profit for the period, of course. Generally, 
fraud isn’t lurking behind asset impairments — although it can be. In any 
case, high-level managers should approve and sign off on asset write-downs.
Implementing computer controls
Computer hardware and software controls are extremely important, but most 
managers don’t have the time or expertise to get into this area of internal 
controls. Obviously, passwords and firewalls should be used, and managers 
know about the possibility of hackers breaking into their computers, as well 
as the damage that viruses can cause. Every business should adopt strict 
internal controls over e-mail, downloading attachments, updating software, 
and so on.
If the business isn’t large enough for its own IT (information technology) 
department, it has to bring in outside consultants. The business accounting 
and enterprise software packages available today generally have strong secu­
rity features, but you can’t be too careful. Extra precautions help deter fraud.
Curbing indifference to internal controls
Internal controls may look good on paper. However, the effectiveness of 
internal controls depends on how judiciously employees execute the con­
trols day in and day out. Internal controls may be carried out in a slipshod 
and perfunctory manner. Managers often let it slide until something serious 
happens, but they should never tolerate a lackadaisical attitude regarding the 
performance of internal controls by employees.
	
Sometimes a manager may be tempted to intervene and override an internal 
control, not out of indifference but because bypassing the control will be more 
efficient or serve another purpose. This break in procedure, however well 
meant, sets an extremely bad example. And in fact in some cases it may be evi­
dence of fraud by the manager.
Special rules for small businesses
The lament of many small business owners/managers is, “We’re too small for 
internal controls.” But even a relatively small business can enforce certain 
internal controls that are very effective. Here are basic guidelines for small 
business owners/managers:

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
276
Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
	
✓	Sign all checks: The owner/manager should sign all checks, including 
payroll checks. This precaution forces the owner/manager to keep a 
close watch on the expenditures of the business. Under no conditions 
should the accountant, bookkeeper, or controller (chief accountant) of 
the business be given check-signing authority. These people can easily 
conceal fraud if they have check-writing authority.
	
✓	Mandate long vacations: The owner/manager should require that 
employees working in the high-risk areas (generally cash receipts and 
disbursements, receivables, and inventory) take vacations of two weeks 
or more and, furthermore, make sure that another employee carries out 
their duties while they’re on vacation. To conceal many types of fraud, 
the guilty employee needs to maintain sole control and access over the 
accounts and other paperwork used in carrying out the fraud. Another 
person who fills in for the employee on vacation may spot something 
suspicious.
	
✓	Get two sets of eyes on things: Although separation of duties may not 
be practicable, owners/managers should consider implementing job 
sharing in which two or more employees are regularly assigned to one 
area of the business on alternate weeks or some other schedule. 
With this arrangement, the employees may notice if the other is 
committing fraud.
	
✓	Watch out for questionable spending: Without violating their privacy, 
owners/managers should keep watch on the lifestyles of employees. If 
the bookkeeper buys a new Mercedes every year and frequently is off to 
Las Vegas, you may ask where the money is coming from. The owners/
managers know the employees’ salaries, so they should be able to esti­
mate what sort of lifestyles the employees can afford.
Considering some important 
details of internal control
Even when you know what internal controls you want to use, you must take 
care to implement them in ways that are legal, practical for the company, 
and effective. And you also need to know what to do if the controls fail and 
you have a case of fraud on your hands. The following sections address these 
important details that you may overlook in your eagerness to place controls 
and get back to business.
Considering legal implications
Pay careful attention to the legal aspects of internal controls and the enforce­
ment of them. For example, controls should not violate the privacy rights 
of employees or customers (for example, no strip searches), and a business 
should be very careful in making accusations against an employee suspected 
of fraud. At the other extreme, the absence of basic controls can possibly

277
 Chapter 13: Preventing Cash Losses from Embezzlement and Fraud
expose a manager to legal responsibility on grounds of reckless disregard 
for protecting the company’s assets. For example, a business may not have 
instituted controls that limit access to its inventory warehouse to authorized 
personnel only, with the result that almost anyone can enter the building and 
steal products without notice. The manager could be accused of neglecting 
to enforce a fundamental internal control for inventory. You may need to get 
a legal opinion on your internal controls, just to be safe.
Evaluating cost effectiveness
One obvious disadvantage of internal controls is their costs — not just in 
money but also in the time it takes employees to perform the internal con­
trols. Internal controls are an example of “managing the negative,” which 
means preventing bad things from happening as opposed to making good 
things happen. Rather than spending time on internal controls, employees 
could be making sales or doing productive activities. But putting it a more 
palatable way, internal controls are needed to manage certain unavoidable 
risks of doing business.
	
The mantra you often hear is that internal controls should be cost effective, 
meaning that the collective benefits of a company’s internal controls should 
be greater than the sum of their costs. But measuring the cost of a particular 
internal control or the total cost of all internal controls isn’t very practical, 
and the benefits of internal controls are difficult to estimate in any quantita­
tive manner. In general, basic internal controls are absolutely necessary and 
worth the cost. In the last analysis, the manager has to make a judgment call 
on what level of internal controls to implement to achieve a reasonable bal­
ance between the costs and the benefits.
Hiding internal controls
Generally, internal controls should be as unobtrusive as possible to the out­
side parties the business deals with. Ideally, your customers and vendors 
should not take notice of them. If you’re not very careful, internal controls 
can give the impression that you don’t trust your employees, customers, or 
vendors. People are sensitive about accusations (real or imagined) that you 
think they may be crooks. Then again, people accept all kinds of internal 
controls, probably because they have become used to them. For example, 
bookstore customers hardly notice the small electronic chip placed in books, 
which is deactivated at the point of sale. On the other hand, bookstore cus­
tomers probably would object to having to show a detailed receipt as they 
leave the store for all the books they have in their bag.
The exception to this rule is when a business wants to make an internal con­
trol obvious to help deter crime or to remind employees and customers that 
the business is watching them to help prevent fraud. For example, surveil­
lance cameras may be positioned to make them clearly visible to customers 
at check-out counters. If you’ve been to Las Vegas, you probably noticed sev­
eral internal controls in the casinos. But these controls are only the ones you 
can see. Casinos use many other internal controls they don’t want you to see.

Following procedure when fraud is discovered
The main advice offered in the professional literature on fraud against a busi­
ness is to establish and vigilantly enforce preventive controls. The literature 
has considerably less advice to offer regarding what course of action manag­
ers should take when an instance of fraud is discovered, other than recom­
mending that the manager plug the hole that allowed the fraud to happen. 
The range of options facing managers upon the discovery of fraud, assuming 
that the facts are indisputable, include
	
✓	Beginning an investigation, which may require legal advice regarding 
what you can and cannot do
	
✓	Immediately dismissing employees who commit fraud or putting the 
person on paid leave until a final decision is made
	
✓	Starting legal action, at least the preliminary steps
	
✓	If applicable, notifying the relevant government regulatory agency or 
law enforcement
Recognizing Limitations 
of Internal Controls
A good deal of business is done on the basis of trust. Internal controls can be 
looked at as a contradiction to this principle. On the other hand, in a game of 
poker among friends, no one takes offense at the custom of cutting the deck 
before dealing the cards. Most people see the need for internal controls by a 
business, at least up to a point. The previous sections of this chapter discuss 
the need for and various aspects of internal controls. In conclusion, this final 
section offers two final thoughts for managers: the need to maintain manage­
ment control over internal controls, and ways of finding fraud that is not 
detected by the internal controls of the business.
Don’t forget about security measures
In addition to internal controls, most businesses 
need what are generally referred to as security 
measures. Some of these are obvious, such as 
locking the doors when the business is closed 
and limiting access to areas where products are 
stored. Other measures may or not be needed, 
such as security guards, surveillance cameras, 
motion detectors, ID cards for employees, 
security tags and devices on products, and so 
on. Generally, these controls are not under the 
authority of the accounting department. Larger 
businesses employ a director or chief of secu­
rity. In a smaller business, the general manager 
may have to take on this duty.

 Chapter 13: Preventing Cash Losses from Embezzlement and Fraud
Keeping internal controls under control
Many businesses, especially smaller companies, adopt the policy that some 
amount of fraud has to be absorbed as a cost of doing business and that insti­
tuting and enforcing an elaborate set of internal controls isn’t worth the time 
or money. This mind-set reflects the fact that business by its very nature is a 
risky venture. Despite taking precautions, you can’t protect against every risk a 
business faces. But on the other hand, a business invites trouble and becomes 
an attractive target if it doesn’t have basic internal controls. Deciding how 
many different internal controls to put into effect is a tough call.
Internal controls aren’t free. They take time and money to design, install, 
and use. Furthermore, some internal controls have serious side effects. 
Customers may resent certain internal controls, such as checking backpacks 
before entering a store, and take their business elsewhere. Employees may 
deeply resent entry and exit searches, which may contribute to low morale.
So even if your business can afford to implement every internal control you 
know of, remember that more is not always better. Limiting the business to a 
select number of most effective controls may provide a good balance of pro­
tection and customer and employee tolerance.
Finding fraud that slips through the net
	
Internal controls are not 100 percent foolproof. A disturbing amount of fraud 
still slips through these preventive measures. In part, these breakdowns in 
internal controls are the outcome of taking a calculated risk. A business may 
decide that certain controls are not worth the cost, which leaves the business 
vulnerable to certain types of fraud. Clever fraudsters can defeat even seem­
ingly tight controls used by a business.
	
Internal controls should be designed to quickly detect a fraud if the first line of 
internal controls fails to prevent it. Of course, responding to this detection is 
like closing the barn door after the horse has escaped. Still, discovering what 
happened is critical in order to close the loophole.
In any case, how can you find out if fraud is taking place? Well, the managers 
or owners of the business may not discover it. Frauds are discovered in many 
ways, including the following:
	
✓	Alarms that call attention to suspicious activities may be raised in the 
normal internal reports to managers, such as unusually high inventory 
shrinkage for the period that has no obvious cause.
	
✓	An internal audit may find evidence of fraud.
	
✓	Employees may blow the whistle to expose fraud.

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
280
Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
	
✓	Customers may give anonymous tips pointing out something wrong.
	
✓	Customer complaints may lead back to discovery of fraud.
	
✓	A vendor may notify someone that they have been asked for a kickback 
or some other under-the-table payment for selling to the business.
	
In financial statement audits, the CPA tests internal controls of the business. 
The auditor may find serious weaknesses in the internal controls system of 
the business, or instances of material fraud. In this situation, the CPA auditor 
is duty bound to communicate the findings to the audit committee or to other 
high-level executives of the business.
Large businesses have one tool of internal control that is not practical for 
smaller businesses — internal auditing. Most large businesses, and for that 
matter most large nonprofit organizations and governmental units, have 
internal auditing departments with broad powers to investigate any of the 
organization’s operations and activities and report their findings to the high­
est levels in the organization. Small businesses can’t afford to hire a full-time 
internal auditor. On the other hand, even a relatively small business should 
consider hiring a CPA to do an assessment of its internal controls and make 
suggestions for improvement. In fact, hiring a CPA for this job may even be 
of more value than having an independent CPA audit the business’s financial 
statements.

F

or most businesses, cash inflows are derived from two primary sources. 
First, as discussed in Chapters 10 and 11, cash or capital can be secured 
from external sources including investors, banks, and/or other lending 
sources. Transactions to secure this type of cash tend to be nonrecurring 
and focused on special needs or events (for example, securing seed capital 
when a business is first formed and launched or taking new loans to support 
a significant business expansion).
The second and more important source of cash is what’s generated internally 
from the selling cycle. Unlike during the dot-com era of the late 1990s (when, 
for the briefest of moments, the markets discounted the importance of actu­
ally generating sales), businesses today do in fact need to generate real sales 
that can be quickly and efficiently turned into cash. This chapter focuses on 
how you can use the selling cycle to maximize cash inflows.
	
Generating cash from the selling cycle can and should be actively controlled 
and managed with internal resources. External sources of cash, which still 
must be managed, are often unpredictable and influenced by unforeseen or 
uncontrollable forces and events (which make them more difficult to manage 
and, thus, the predictability of securing cash from external sources is more 
challenging). Remember, proactive management of the selling cycle is a func­
tion that can be controlled internally and often can produce more-reliable 
sources of cash (than finding yourself always waiting on the decision of 
another party).

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
Understanding the Entire Selling 
Cycle: Start to Finish
The concept of the selling cycle can be looked at from many perspectives 
but basically boils down into one of two views: the accounting/financial 
perspective versus the strategic view. In this section we give you an overview 
of both.
The accounting/financial view
The accounting/financial perspective of the selling cycle is generally fairly 
narrow. In this view, the selling cycle typically starts when a “hard” transac­
tion is executed — that is, when an actual sales order or contract is received 
from the customer and an agreement has been entered that stipulates terms 
and conditions of when the requested goods or services will be delivered 
and the need for any credit review and approval. After these items have 
been addressed, this accounting sales cycle continues through delivery of 
the goods or services and eventually collection of the balance due. In some 
cases, the accounting cycle can be as quick as less than one hour (just think 
of a customer purchasing products in Walmart) or may last six months or 
longer (say, in the case of a defense contractor such as Boeing building and 
delivering planes).
	
The key point with the accounting selling cycle is that it is very narrow in 
scope and doesn’t properly capture the true or real amount of cash required 
to support the entire selling cycle (from customer identification through to 
customer retention).
The strategic view
The alter ego of the accounting/financial selling cycle is the strategic point of 
view, which looks at how a business operates and generates sales from the 
very beginning (conducting market research on target customers and devel­
oping a sales pipeline) to the very end (managing customers’ expectations 
and providing additional support and service well after the sale).
Customers just don’t magically appear when a business opens its doors 
and begin ordering goods and services. Instead, the process of identifying, 
courting, securing, managing, and retaining customers is a far more complex 
and management-intensive process than some people realize. For example, 
for a company like Boeing, the process of actually securing a contract from 
the Department of Defense to build planes can take years to finalize and will 
undoubtedly involve multiple parties within Boeing, including engineers (to

 Chapter 14: Managing the Selling Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
support design requirements), legal personnel (to support contractual obli­
gations), manufacturing employees (to address production capabilities), and 
even accountants (to quote and support overhead rate calculations).
Even a small retail business that opens in the local strip mall must develop 
an economically viable business model that ensures a product or service 
of value is offered at a competitive price to its target customers, reached 
via efficient marketing, promotional, and advertising efforts. So although a 
customer may enter this retail business, browse, and spend $100 on a prod­
uct, all within a half hour, the time and effort required to actually bring that 
customer into the store more than likely took months and multiple times the 
amount of money spent during the first visit.
Why the sales cycle is the 
biggest consumer of cash
An old but very true saying in the restaurant business is that you always 
lose money on a customer’s first visit because the profit generated off the 
first visit in no way even comes close to covering the costs of the entire sell­
ing cycle — accounting for all the costs incurred to get the customer in the 
door (the first time). This axiom really holds true for almost all businesses, 
because without repeat customers, failure is almost always guaranteed. 
Therefore, when a company develops its strategic business plan, it must 
understand the concept of the entire selling cycle to ensure that adequate 
cash resources are secured and managed from start to finish.
The sales cycle is a big consumer of cash because of the concept of com­
pounding: the accumulation of all efforts of the sales cycle that must be com­
pleted in sequential steps, throughout which any delay in one element of the 
sales cycle slows down the entire sales cycle. The advertising campaign must 
wait until the product or service is developed into a commercially viable 
status. And this wait for the advertising campaign delays the point at which 
customers can be reached, which causes a lag to work its way through the 
entire sales cycle by delaying quotes, sales orders, goods or services deliv­
ery, invoicing, customer payments, and eventually, being able to generate 
repeat business from the customer. And all along the way and with basically 
every step, cash is being consumed, until that magical day when the first 
dollar is actually received (which is immediately framed and placed on dis­
play for everyone to see).
So when managing the sales cycle, utilize the following three strategies to 
help maximize cash flows derived from the selling cycle:
	
✓	Develop, implement, and manage proper policies, procedures, and 
­controls throughout the entire selling cycle.
	
✓	Know your customers and your selling cycle inside and out.

✓	Remaining adaptable, flexible, and retaining some creativity when 
working with customers can go a long way to improve cash flows.
	
✓	Understand how cash can be generated or “manufactured” during the 
selling cycle through the windows and opportunities that present 
themselves.
You may wonder why we focus on the entire selling cycle so intently. Well, 
for almost every business we’ve ever worked with, the selling cycle always 
takes longer than the business’s managers think it will. And mishandling the 
selling cycle and running out of cash is a good way to go belly up in a hurry. 
So with this warning in mind, the remainder of this chapter focuses on bring­
ing in cash from the selling cycle quickly and possibly driving sales higher by 
turning your accounting function into a sales resource and tool.
Implementing Basic Controls in the 
Selling Process to Manage Cash
Every business has a selling cycle that’s unique to that company. Some 
companies, such as retail stores or ecommerce sites, rely heavily on point-
of-sale customer purchases (via accepting cash, credit cards, debit cards, or 
other forms of electronic payments) to realize the end of the selling cycle (at 
least from a cash perspective). Others, such as manufacturing companies or 
distributors, generally invoice or bill their customers, who then remit pay­
ments via checks or by using electronic forms of payments. But no matter the 
specifics of each sales cycle, all businesses must establish a standard set of 
basic sales controls to ensure that the entire selling cycle is optimized both 
from the net-profit and cash-flow-generation perspectives. In this section we 
walk you through these typical and necessary controls.
Qualifying the customer
The concept of qualifying customers goes well beyond simply identifying 
customers who will be able to pay for goods and services purchased. Rather, 
customers need to be evaluated from the broad perspective of how much 
profit they generate in relation to the amount of capital your company must 
invest to support them. For example, if you have a relatively small customer 
who demands frequent support and service, takes 60 days or more to pay, 
and is constantly looking for price discounts and/or other sales perks, the 
actual profitability from this customer may be quite low. Your business may 
prefer to work with other customers who generate you more earnings.

 Chapter 14: Managing the Selling Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
Another example of properly qualifying a customer is looking at the “repu­
tation” risk associated with doing business with a specific customer (and 
the damage your business’s image may sustain). Enron was considered one 
of the most successful businesses through the early 2000s, but when the 
company imploded, not only did a number of vendors lose money from not 
collecting receivables, but they also had to deal with the Enron association 
factor (was your business aware of and a party to the fraud?).
	
Businesses need to understand that the amount of invested capital required 
to support customers goes well beyond the simple calculation of determining 
how long it takes for the customer to pay (which we discuss in Chapter 5). 
The profitability of a customer encompasses numerous factors, which range 
from how the customer was initially obtained to what efforts are required to 
ensure that a repeat customer is present. Businesses really need to complete 
a more thorough review on potential customers by completing a number of 
steps as follows:
	
1.	After a customer has been identified, management should focus on 
whether the customer fits into the ideal business target or profile 
(established in the business plan) in terms of potential annual revenue 
levels, specialized product or service requests, and similar subjective 
factors. Experience and industry knowledge are critical to support­
ing this process because, while the numbers are important, there’s no 
replacing extensive experience (when qualifying customers).
	
2.	Management needs to evaluate the financial strength of the customer 
to assess whether they can even pay (by reviewing their financial 
statements and credit reports), and if they can, how long payment will 
take. Also, establishing customer credit limits should be considered at 
this stage as well.
	
3.	With the customer identified as being valid and quantified as being 
viable, ongoing assessments of the customer’s real economic return 
need to be completed. For example, customers may play the partner­
ship and “win-win” game at the start of the relationship, but if they are 
simply short-term, price-sensitive customers that will move to a new 
supplier at the drop of a hat (versus long-term, value-orientated custom­
ers), then the termination of the relationship needs to be considered.
These three steps are not meant to be all-inclusive of every step a business 
can take to qualify a customer, but the steps do highlight the basic logic in 
the qualification process. First, is the customer a proper fit in relation to 
the business plan? Second, is the customer’s financial strength adequate to 
ensure that your business is paid? Third, does the customer really represent 
a valued long-term relationship or a pain in the butt who eats into operating 
margins (which usually can’t be determined until the relationship has devel­
oped over a period of time)?

Customers can be disqualified for any number of reasons specific to a situa­
tion. For example, a large staffing company supported numerous customers 
from a wide variety of industries. As part of its business model, the staffing 
company paid workers’ compensation insurance for all the workers it sent out 
to fill open positions at customer companies. Workers’ compensation insur­
ance is determined by numerous factors, one of which is a company’s specific 
experience with losses. One of this staffing company’s customers had a partic­
ularly bad safety record, which caused injuries to the temporary employees 
provided to the customer, impacting the workers’ compensation rate for the 
entire company and increasing premiums for all employees. The staffing com­
pany had to terminate this customer, because its negative impact on the over­
all business was far greater than the profit generated from the single account.
Being prudent with credit 
review and approval
All businesses should implement proper policies, procedures, and controls 
for extending credit. Even retail businesses, which derive most of their sales 
from POS (point-of-sale) transactions, make sure to obtain proper credit 
approval by getting authorization for electronic forms of payments (credit 
and debit cards, PayPal, and sometimes even checks) before the sale is com­
pleted. However, for most businesses, a more formal and proactive credit 
review and approval process is required to ensure that after you make a sale, 
you actually get paid.
	
Establishing initial credit is one thing, but applying proper credit review and 
approval processes on an ongoing basis is something completely different. Credit 
defaults occur more often from a failure to continuously apply credit policies and 
procedures than from poor initial efforts. Remember, economic conditions can 
change quickly at both the macro and micro levels, so constant revisions and 
evaluations of customer credit are essential to limiting future losses.
The following sections cover basic credit review and approval policies and 
procedures that your business should use to prevent losses. We present the 
simpler efforts first and then move to more-extreme measures you may want 
to take.
Utilizing credit agencies and other external 
reporting/informational bureaus
A number of credit reporting agencies, such as Dun & Bradstreet, provide 
credit reports and other information on potential customers (for a price, of 
course). These sources are easily accessible and provide solid information 
and credit ratings on potential customers. The downside to these sources 
is that sometimes the data being provided can become stale, or outdated, 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
287
 Chapter 14: Managing the Selling Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
because getting timely information from businesses can be a challenge and 
business conditions can change quickly. Credit agencies are an important 
tool, but they should be used as part of the entire credit process and not as a 
stand-alone resource.
	
Leveraging a network of local contacts and professional references is a great 
way not only to generate business but also, more importantly, to obtain 
market financial information on potential customers. Joining a trade organiza­
tion in your business’s region or niche with a specific market interest can be 
a great way to secure information on potential customers, because a number 
of trade organizations offer credit and business referral data. Better Business 
Bureaus are another external resource that can be tapped to support the 
credit review and approval process.
Processing internal credit applications and references
Businesses often utilize internal credit applications that request numerous 
pieces of information from customers, ranging from where they bank to how 
they’re performing to who their largest creditors are. Whether this data is 
obtained from an actual credit application or through other means (customer 
websites, publicly reported financial data on file with government organiza­
tions, or other sources), your business should accumulate it for all customers 
and keep it up-to-date. Not only is this info essential to have in the event a 
customer defaults on payment obligations (to track down the customer and 
pursue collection efforts), but it can also provide vital information on the cus­
tomer that your business may be able to mine to generate additional sales.
Your customers should always be willing to provide references, including 
banks or financial institutions they utilize or other suppliers they conduct 
business with, which your business can use as needed. References are not 
designed to obtain actual financial information but rather are geared more 
toward securing information on the nature of the relationship (such as easy 
to work with, professional, communicate well, and so on). When customers 
balk at providing references, the red flags should go up.
	
A customer data sheet can gather the same information as a credit application 
and may be viewed in a less hostile manner by the customer. Some customers 
view the process of applying for credit as an insult or waste of time, so rather 
than battling with the customer, developing a customer data sheet that’s 
structured in a manner that emphasizes the long-term relationship and future 
sales potential may be received more favorably (and may help generate addi­
tional sales). It should be noted that the final decision to extend credit can be 
based on the credit application, the data sheet, both, or neither, because the 
final credit decision may take into account other considerations that are not 
disclosed in these documents. The idea with these documents is to support or 
enhance the credit decision process rather than to be used as the only source 
of information to make a credit decision.

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
Implementing the use of electronic forms of payments
When your business has concerns about a customer’s creditworthiness, 
establishing multiple forms of electronic payment functionality is often 
very prudent. For instance, you may want to accept credit cards (including 
having a customer’s credit card on file to charge if needed) and also set up 
ACH (automated clearing house) or EFT (electronic funds transfer) options 
such as PayPal to allow for processing payments in the new digital age. In 
some cases, credit card payments may not work given the size of the trans­
action being processed or the type of card the customer uses (for example, 
American Express is not accepted by your company), so having backup or 
alternative forms of receiving electronic payments is prudent. Even though 
your company may have to pay fees to process electronic payments, the 
fees pale in comparison to the time, effort, and losses realized from custom­
ers not paying.
	
The ability to process payments electronically not only assists with collection 
efforts and reduces bad debts but in addition may potentially increase sales. 
Larger corporations now basically insist that all their vendors accept elec­
tronic forms of payments. These payments may still take a while to receive 
(large corporations are notorious for slow payments), but by being able to 
accept electronic payments, your company may have the opportunity to 
expand business with certain customers.
Completing more-detailed financial reviews
In some situations you may require a more thorough credit evaluation of a 
customer, including a complete review of the customer’s financial statements 
and operating performance. These types of efforts are generally reserved for 
customers who will be engaging in very large transactions and that in a sense 
may be more of a partner than a customer. Of course, each situation varies, 
but consider completing more-comprehensive financial reviews for custom­
ers who drive 10 percent or more of your annual revenue. The trade-off is the 
time, effort, and cost associated with completing a detailed review in relation 
to the value gained (or loss prevented) from undertaking this type of effort.
Obtaining collateral or guarantees (corporate or personal)
A credit-review and approval policy being used more and more by businesses 
is obtaining collateral and/or guarantees in exchange for extending credit. A 
very common form of guarantee relates to parent-subsidiary business struc­
tures where the parent company is financially solid with ample resources, 
but the subsidiary (the parent owns) is relatively young with a limited oper­
ating history. Under this scenario, a supplier to the subsidiary may request 
a parent guarantee for a year or two until the subsidiary’s financial strength 
and operating history improves.

 Chapter 14: Managing the Selling Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
The Great Recession has changed the environment related to requesting 
collateral or guarantees, making them a more acceptable control against 
potential bad debts, especially for customers who have experienced financial 
difficulties, who demonstrate slow payment patterns, and/or who request a 
significant increase in credit. The good news with using this type of strategy 
is that payment is all but guaranteed (in one form or another) and your cus­
tomer displays a commitment to the business relationship. The bad news 
is that this control is still considered an extreme measure, and to be quite 
honest, not many of your customers will happily provide collateral or offer 
a guarantee to receive credit. These types of requests can often rub the cus­
tomer the wrong way. Another downside is that you’ll generally require the 
involvement of professional counsel to make sure that the proper documen­
tation is prepared and executed.
	
One strategy to consider when requesting collateral or guarantees is to allow 
the customer to remove these requirements when certain milestones are met. 
For instance, if a customer needs increased credit for only a 90-day period, 
the guarantee or collateral may only be required during this period. After the 
customer returns to normal credit and payment patterns, the collateral and/
or guarantees can be removed. Displaying a willingness to work with custom­
ers provides the dual benefit of gaining loyalty and sending a message to your 
customer of being an astute business person.
Setting proper terms and conditions
While conducting the credit review and approval process, you want to simul­
taneously establish customer terms and conditions. For each customer, 
consider the following key questions and then clearly communicate your 
answers to the customer if you approve the credit request:
	
✓	How much credit will your business extend? The answer to this ques­
tion depends on the credit review and approval process discussed in 
the preceding section and varies by company and with each customer. 
So a better way to skin this cat is to ask yourself another question: How 
much can my business afford to lose on a bad debt without damaging 
operations significantly? If your credit review and approval efforts were 
limited to the first two strategies noted in the previous section (relying 
on reports from credit agencies and internal credit applications and ref­
erences), then a safe range of credit may be no more than 1 percent to 
2 percent of your total sales. So if your business generates $10,000,000 a 
year in revenue, extending credit of $200,000 to a single customer would 
be reasonable.
	
	For most businesses, diversifying the customer base so no more than 
one customer accounts for 2 percent to 3 percent of total revenue is 
difficult. Businesses tend to observe the 80/20 rule, which says that 80 
percent of sales come from 20 percent of customers. With this reality

290
Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
in mind, businesses often extend credit levels well in excess of 5 per­
cent of total company annual sales to support larger customers. If your 
business engages in significant credit extensions, be sure to undertake 
added credit review and approval processes to support and assess the 
added risks associated from potential large defaults.
	
✓	What are the payment terms? After the amount of credit has been 
determined, the actual payment terms need to be set. Probably the most 
common payment term utilized by businesses extending credit is net 
30, which means that the customer has 30 days from the invoice date 
to pay. The variety of payment terms are extensive and are often tai­
lored to the tendencies of a specific industry. However, the general rule 
of thumb is that for higher-credit-risk customers, payment terms are 
shorter and monitored very closely to limit potential losses. (In other 
words, keep these customers on a short leash.) For stronger, more-
established customers, payment terms can be extended.
	
	When establishing payment terms, make sure you understand the 
customer’s paying habits and cycles to properly manage cash flows. 
Extremely large companies, including the biggest corporations operat­
ing in America, often leverage their supplier’s payment terms. If you 
offer net 30, they will pay in net 60. If you offer a discount if they pay in 
10 days, they will still take the discount if they don’t pay for 45 days. Be 
prepared to make allowances for big customers. Of course, by stretching 
or changing the payment terms, you could easily assume that they have 
defaulted. Well, good luck in pursuing any action, because in the end, 
they will use their size and deep pockets to leverage payment terms to 
their liking. You may not consider it fair, but “it is what it is,” and large 
corporations are going to leverage the relationship to their advantage.
	
✓	Where will the customer take possession of the products sold? Your 
business must determine which party is responsible for transporting 
products from your location to the customer. If you opt for FOB (free 
on board) at your company’s dock, then the customer is responsible for 
either picking up the product from your dock/location or arranging for 
a common carrier to transport the goods. If you use the terms FOB [the 
customer’s dock/location], then your business is responsible for shipping 
the goods to the customer. Although your business would probably like 
to determine the FOB status, in a number of cases (and especially with 
large customers), the customer will dictate this term.
	
	Both strategies have pros and cons:
 
• For FOB your dock, you pass the shipping responsibility, risk of 
loss, fees, and so on to the customer at your dock. In addition, 
your business can invoice the customer earlier (rather than wait 
until receipt by the customer). The downside to this strategy is the 
customer service aspect, because this requirement may irritate 
the customer with having to manage additional tasks (for example, 
coordinating shipment).

291
 Chapter 14: Managing the Selling Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
 
• FOB customer’s dock is a much more attractive proposition for the 
customer but requires more effort on your part to coordinate the 
shipment. Your business also assumes additional risk of loss (if 
something were to happen during the shipment) and must wait to 
invoice until the shipment has been received. In addition, the cost 
of shipment or freight may become an issue, because if the cus­
tomer doesn’t want to pay for the freight, you will most likely have 
to eat this expense.
	
✓	What legal matters need to be disclosed? Clearly stating all critical legal 
terms and conditions is very important in the terms of credit extension. 
Legal matters to address include when the risk of loss is transferred (for 
example, upon delivery or at final customer acceptance), any warranty 
information, return policies (including any restocking fees), and various 
other matters (which tend to be driven by the unique or specific issues 
associated with different industries).
Supplying CART — complete, accurate, 
reliable, and timely — invoices
One of the most tried-and-proven strategies resulting in improved cash flows 
from the selling cycle is as basic and as simple as it sounds: Apply the con­
cept of CART by producing complete, accurate, reliable, and timely invoices. 
When invoices properly agree with and match the terms and conditions 
established in the original customer purchase orders (which represent your 
sales orders), you reduce the risk of customers rejecting the invoices for 
payment.
	
If the invoice isn’t complete, accurate, and reliable, the customer’s payable 
system kicks out the invoice and cycles it through an exception process 
within their accounting system to resolve the discrepancies. Customers that 
are experiencing financial difficulties may be eager to use inaccurate invoices 
as an opportunity to delay payments. In the end, the invoice will probably be 
approved and paid, but the delay may range from a couple of days to months 
(slowing down your cash flows).
As for the timely aspect, quickly producing and forwarding your invoice 
to your customer for processing should result in your business receiving 
speedier payments. So if you can process monthly invoices on the first of 
the following month and not wait until the fifth business day of the following 
month, then cash receipts should accelerate as well. To help the system run 
smoothly, develop a billing system that ensures the required information 
needed to bill customers in a timely manner is readily available (and doesn’t 
take days to accumulate).

Reviewing the basic accounting and operational controls, policies, and proce­
dures to ensure that your business produces CART invoices is beyond the 
scope of this chapter. However, you can take a big step in the right direction 
by making every effort to ensure that the terms and conditions set in the cus­
tomer’s purchase order, sales contract, or internal sales order generated are 
consistent with the invoice generated.
Managing past-due accounts 
and collection efforts
The final basic procedure of the selling cycle is management of the sale after 
it has occurred. Up to this point, the customer has been qualified, subjected 
to a credit review and approval process, given sale terms and conditions, 
and provided with a CART invoice. All these events occur prior to and at the 
point of actual sale — and, in some cases, after the point of sale (for example, 
a customer may be billed once a month for a number of purchases made 
during the month, which are accumulated on one invoice for easier reading 
and processing). Now we turn our attention to how past-due accounts can be 
managed to improve cash flows and limit losses.
Managing collection efforts is an ongoing and critical function that should 
be addressed on a periodic basis. A number of companies implement weekly 
reporting requirements that highlight all collection efforts, provide updates 
on how receivables are performing or trending, and note any significant 
problems that may be brewing. Building management discipline (periodic 
and timely review of receivable reports by the appropriate management team 
members) into your collection processes will enhance future results.
When customers delay payments, management needs to implement proactive 
efforts to collect the outstanding receivable. You can implement two strate­
gies for collecting the balance due: internal efforts and external efforts.
Internal collection efforts
Internal collection efforts vary by company and situation, but all businesses 
should use the same basic steps to improve the collection results without 
impairing or damaging a customer relationship:
	
1.	Positive confirmation: Check that the customer received the invoice 
and verify all information, terms, and conditions. If the customer 
claims not to have received the invoice, forward a copy via certified mail 
or e-mail. (If you e-mail, ask for positive confirmation of receipt by the 
customer.) When the customer has received the invoice, immediately 
confirm when it will be paid.
	
	 Keeping open lines of communications and a professional and positive 
approach are very important. At the same time, firmly and clearly let the

293
 Chapter 14: Managing the Selling Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
customer know that past-due invoices will not be tolerated. As the old 
saying goes, if you give an inch, they’ll take a mile, so you must condi­
tion your customers to pay on time. To stay on top of potential prob­
lems, we recommend that you undertake positive confirmation efforts 
within seven days of the invoice becoming past due.
	
2.	Secondary contact: If the initial positive confirmation efforts are not 
fruitful, make an effort to work with the customer by establishing a 
payment plan, confirming when payments will be made, offering alter­
native methods for payment, and/or looking to resolve the outstand­
ing balance due with other creative strategies (such as collateral). You 
may attempt these more forceful and direct collection efforts from as 
soon as 14 days past due to as late as 60 days past due (depending on 
the customer). Regardless of when you begin offering various options, 
keep up constant customer contact. Remember, sometimes the best 
collection strategy is simply being a pest — but keep your pestering 
friendly and positive.
	
	 Get the sales representative who consummated the initial sale actively 
involved in the collection effort. This strategy can be very helpful for 
a couple of reasons. First, the sales representative has an established 
relationship with the customer and therefore can speak to contacts in a 
manner that may be more effective. Second, if the sales representative 
earns a commission based on when cash is received from the sale, then 
he or she has a vested financial interest to collect and will make collec­
tion a priority.
	
3.	 Final contact: If payment still doesn’t arrive, present the customer 
with an ultimatum to pay or suffer the consequences. Consequences 
may include placing the customer on COD (cash on delivery) terms for 
future transactions, restricting future sales, turning over the account 
to a collection agency, and/or threatening legal action (a threat can 
sometimes be as fruitful as actually pursuing legal action). The idea with 
these consequences is to strongly encourage payment instead of pursu­
ing a course that actually forces a payment.
	
	 When the point of final contact is reached, document your company’s 
position and clearly relay it, with positive receipt confirmation, to the 
customer. If the customer begins to default on previously agreed-to pay­
ment plans (generally structured during the secondary contact stage), 
ceases communications, and/or undertakes a disinformation campaign, 
then it’s time to raise the red flag and consider more-aggressive collec­
tion tactics (including moving from threatened legal action to actual 
legal action or turning the account over to a third-party collection 
agency to secure payment).
	
	 In summary, the consequences are really used as the first option in the 
final contact stage and is designed to strongly encourage payment (but 
not force payment). The second option then really becomes forced col­
lection action, which is usually pursued in the form of retaining collec­
tion agencies (for smaller and more-routine matters) or attorneys (for 
larger and more-complex matters).

Document all collection efforts in writing with letters, e-mail, collection effort 
notes in an electronic system, or whatever other means available. Having a 
documented trail of collection efforts can greatly assist in the recovery effort, 
especially when third parties are secured to help resolve a dispute (because 
the party that is better prepared with quality supporting documentation gen­
erally receives more-favorable outcomes).
External collection efforts
Every company must determine at what point the collection effort must be 
turned over to external resources. That point may be 30 days past due, 60 
days past due, or even longer (and is really dictated on a case-by-case basis, 
depending on the industry you operate within and potential unique issues 
with the customer). Be aware, though, that when external resources are 
used, the relationship with the customer will be damaged. In fact, when you 
employ external collection resources, you can pretty much kiss the customer 
goodbye.
External collection efforts are outside professional services and resources 
used to secure payment. Basically, external efforts boil down to the two fol­
lowing options:
What if your customer goes bankrupt?
Most businesses that extend credit do so in 
an unsecured fashion, meaning that they don’t 
obtain security in the customer’s assets or take 
collateral. An unsecured position is generally 
the worst spot to be in when the customer 
experiences financial problems and can’t pay 
everyone. The secured creditors and priority 
credits get paid first, and then whatever cash 
is left over gets divided up between the unse­
cured creditors. In bankruptcy proceedings, the 
unsecured creditors usually get hammered and 
receive (if they’re lucky) 25 percent of the bal­
ance owed. So the trick to improving collection 
results is finding a way to move your claim from 
unsecured to priority.
One example of how a creditor was able to 
move up the priority ladder is a staffing com­
pany that provided staff and paid payroll of the 
staff to the company. The staffing company was 
able to move up the priority ladder by success­
fully claiming that 70 percent of their invoices 
to the company were for payroll and payroll 
taxes (and not general services). In bankruptcy 
proceedings, unpaid payroll and payroll taxes 
represent priority obligations that need to be 
paid before unsecured creditors are paid. So by 
moving up the priority ladder, the staffing com­
pany received 70 percent of their claim rather 
than the 10 percent it would have gotten other­
wise from the trust of assets set aside for allo­
cation to the various creditors (from liquidating 
the bankrupt company’s assets). Although this 
example is somewhat unique, the primary point 
we want to drive home is that in order to move 
up the priority ladder, you must have a very 
strong case and set of circumstances to sup­
port why your claim should receive preference. 
Clearly, the dangers of being an unsecured 
creditor are significant in a bankruptcy pro­
ceeding, but options do exist (although limited) 
to improve your chances of collection outstand­
ing balances due.

✓	Collection agencies: Countless collection services are available to 
choose from when you need to retain a third party to secure payment. 
Most collection agencies work on a commission; if you don’t get paid, 
they don’t get paid. The good news with collection services is that 
they’re very knowledgeable about their trade and have a wide range of 
resources available to help secure payment. Plus, the collection service 
takes care of the dirty work of playing the bad guy to collect money due. 
The bad news with collection services is that their fees can often exceed 
25 percent of the amount collected, and their tactics tend not to be cus­
tomer friendly.
	
	Collection agencies offer a full range of services and are very competi­
tive, so we recommend that you do some comparison shopping. Certain 
agencies may offer a broader range of services, including providing 
support on pursuing collections through taking actions to small claims 
court. When evaluating the effectiveness of collection agencies, consider 
the trade-off between price and range of collection tools.
	
✓	Professional resources: For larger or more-complex collection issues, 
securing professional resources in the form of legal and/or financial 
advice generally becomes a necessary step. Missteps with large or 
complex issues can often prove to be very costly, so protecting your 
business and financial interests with professional counsel needs to be 
evaluated from a cost-versus-benefit standpoint.
	
1.	The first step with securing professional resources is to deter­
mine if the cost of retaining professional counsel (such as an 
attorney) is reasonable compared to the expected payout from 
the customer. If an attorney is going to cost $25,000 and the 
expected customer payment is, at best, $15,000, there’s not much 
point in pursing this course of action.
	
2.	The second step is to determine if the matter is better resolved 
through an independent third-party settlement or arbitration 
proceeding (a qualified and independent third party agreed to 
by both parties to settle a matter) versus actually pursuing legal 
action in the form of a lawsuit. Arbitration proceedings are com­
monly used in today’s environment to avoid the added time, effort, 
and money it takes to actually take a collection case to court.
	
3.	The last step is to pursue a collection matter with an actual law­
suit (whether processed in small claims court or through regular 
court channels). Needless to say, the lawsuit or “court” route 
should only be used with very large and complex collection mat­
ters (and really represents the exception rather than the rule).
When applying a cost-versus-benefit analysis on a collection issue, remember 
to incorporate all critical facts and data. For instance, if you’re owed $100,000 
but professional legal counsel is going to cost $25,000 to secure payment (in 
the form of representing your company in a settlement proceeding or law 
suit), you may quickly conclude that the $75,000 of net receipts is more than

enough to pursue legal action and cover the $25,000 of costs. However, if you 
estimate that your company only has a 33 percent chance of collecting the 
balance due and that internal management resources will be consumed to 
support the process, the expected net receipts begin to drop considerably 
and may not be worth it.
Getting Creative to Improve 
Sales-Related Cash Flows
After you get a solid handle on the basics of cash flow in the sales cycle, 
addressed in previous sections of this chapter, you’re ready to turn your 
attention to utilizing more-creative sales-cycle policies and procedures. On 
one hand, these procedures can accelerate or improve cash flow, but on the 
other hand, they do come with a price (usually in the form of added interest 
costs or one-time fees or charges). The list of ideas in this section is by no 
means complete, but it does provide a sampling of the types of strategies 
your company can use to accelerate the receipt of cash from the sales cycle.
Using discounts: The double-edged sword
A very commonly used payment term, net 30, gives customers 30 days from 
the invoice date to pay. This payment term is often expanded by providing 
the customer a discount such as 2 percent 10, net 30. What this payment 
term means is that payment is due in 30 days but a 2 percent discount will 
be provided if it is paid within 10 days. This offer sounds great and can really 
improve cash flows, because if all invoices are paid within 10 days, receivable 
balances can be kept to a minimum. Another popular tactic is to offer 3 per­
cent on receipt, net 30, in which a 3 percent discount is offered if customers 
pay as soon as they receive the invoice (with payment otherwise due in full 
in 30 days).
But you can’t have your cake and eat it too: Offering discounts brings two 
significant risks. First, larger customers may simply take the discount but 
still pay you in 30 to 45 days. They can use their leverage (banking on the fact 
that you don’t want to lose a large customer) to extract the discount from 
your company even if they technically aren’t abiding by the terms. Second, as 
highlighted in Table 14-1, offering discounts when translated into an effective 
interest rate can be very expensive indeed.

So before you jump headfirst into using discounts, think closely about the 
trade-offs that will be realized. Although the discounts are not reflected 
as interest expense in the financial statements, your business will need to 
reflect the customer discounts taken as a reduction from gross sales to 
reflect a net sales figure earned. In the above example, if a customer took a 
$20 discount for paying within ten days, then the company’s net sales would 
be $980 (and not $1,000) so in effect, the company has realized a $20 expense 
to accelerate the receipt of cash.
Offering creative payment terms
Payment terms come in all shapes, sizes, and forms and may range from 
requiring prepayments or deposits (to cover a portion of a large project) to 
extending payment terms to two years or more (for example, in the case of 
payments made when a lawsuit is finally settled). The real battle with becom­
ing creative with payment terms is the balancing act you must undertake 
between using these terms to improve cash flows while at the same time 
structuring terms to improve customer satisfaction and increase sales oppor­
tunities (which generally require longer payment terms).
The following three examples of creative payment strategies highlight vari­
ous alternatives that address both objectives:
	
✓	Covering out-of-pocket “hard costs” first: When companies sell goods 
or services, the invoice to the customer should cover both the cost of 
providing the goods or services and a profit (if not, you’re not going 
to be in business very long!). So one strategy to help manage risks is 
to structure dual payment terms that ensure your hard costs are paid 
within 30 days while letting your profit be paid with slightly more-
favorable terms. This type of strategy is not appropriate to use for the 
masses, (such as a business that cannot separate hard costs from prof­
its easily, or a high-volume, low-selling-price business such as a retailer),

298
Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
but it can be effective with larger or unique situations. Floating the prof­
its can help manage your company’s cash needs, while at the same time 
providing some flexibility to your customers.
	
	An example of when this strategy may be appropriate is for a research 
and development project. The project may require additional external 
costs to be incurred as well as increasing the number of employees 
to support the project. These added hard costs can be quantified and 
billed to the customer in advance or early in the project, whereas the 
overhead and profit component of the project can be billed later.
	
✓	Letting your customers pay when they get paid: In some industries, 
such as construction, customers pay invoices from creditors when their 
own invoices are paid. In other words, “When I get paid, you get paid.” 
So instead of extending an actual grace period for customers to pay 
(such as net 30 days), you may want to select a date for payment that 
you know relates to when your customer is getting paid (which generally 
you would obtain directly from your customer via verbal confirmation 
or in some cases, documentation in an executed contract noting when 
payments will be received). Proper coordination of payments should be 
pursued to avoid getting bumped to the next month.
	
✓	Adjusting when the customer gets the products (and pays the bill): A 
number of customers place blanket purchase orders to secure products 
over a period of time. In some cases, the purchase order requests the 
majority of the products be delivered over a short period of time (for 
example, by November 10 to support the holiday season). Although this 
arrangement may be ideal for the customer, the supplier can get trapped 
into delivering products in an unlevel manner. A strategy to help manage 
this requirement is requesting level loading delivery schedules with 
associated invoicing occurring at the same time. Instead of delivering 
9,000 units of a 10,000-unit order over a 30-day period, a request could 
be made to deliver 2,000 units over five like periods and bill accordingly. 
This proposal can be further expanded by offering free storage and ship­
ping in the event the customer doesn’t have the capacity to accept the 
products until a specific date.
	
The variety of payment terms available for use are endless and often are 
heavily influenced by industry trends and norms. For example, consigned 
inventory programs are actively utilized in the jewelry industry in order to 
make sure that adequate product levels are on the store shelves for the criti­
cal shopping seasons. When the product is sold, then the supplier looks for 
payment within seven days. But remember, if your business uses creative 
payment terms, make sure that any lending facility established that advances 
funds against customer invoices is properly structured to account for these 
terms. For further information on this topic, refer to the section “Managing the 
Lending Agreement in Relation to Your Sales Cycle” later in this chapter.

 Chapter 14: Managing the Selling Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
Using deposits, advances, 
and prepayments
Companies have been using deposits, advances, and prepayment require­
ments for decades as a means to accelerate the receipt of cash and have the 
customers share in the risk (so to speak). Pre–Great Recession, this type 
of strategy worked well for a number of industries, including construction, 
defense, and research, in which it made perfect sense to receive a portion 
of the costs upfront to support a large project with a relatively long delivery 
timeline. The classic approach of requesting 30 percent down, 30 percent on 
achieving the first milestone, 30 percent on the second milestone, and 10 per­
cent upon completion is a tried-and-proven business strategy that continues 
to be used successfully throughout the economy.
But since the Great Recession of 2007 through 2009, the use of deposits, 
advances, and prepayments has taken on an entirely new meaning that goes 
well beyond the classic purpose of these payment tools. The reason for the 
increase in popularity is centered in the fact that traditional sources of credit 
from banks and other lenders have decreased as a result of tightened and 
much stricter underwriting standards (so businesses must look elsewhere 
for credit).
Arrangements these days offer new benefits, both for the customer and your 
business:
	
✓	Benefits to the customer: The largest and strongest corporations sit 
on mounds of cash — Apple alone has over $60 billion of cash, cash 
equivalents, and short-term investments. And these companies are 
probably earning no more than 2 percent on their cash balances. So one 
significant benefit to these companies is that by providing a substantial 
prepayment to a vendor (that is, your business), they may be able to 
secure a discount (say 5 to 10 percent). This return is higher than they’d 
get investing the cash, and with corporations always looking to reduce 
expenses, what better solution is available?
	
✓	Benefits to your business: Let’s face it; America was spoiled rotten 
prior to the Great Recession, as credit was readily available and free 
flowing. That credit situation changed dramatically when the financial 
industry melted down in 2008 and 2009 as a result of the real estate 
market collapse. Today (contrary to what media is reporting), credit is 
still very tight and expensive for small businesses. So tapping a strong 
customer for cash upfront by providing a reasonable discount can not 
only strengthen the relationship with the customer but also provide a 
relatively cheap source of financing for your business.

If you’re going to approach customers with this type of strategy, do so with 
the utmost caution in order to avoid the perception that your company is 
struggling financially. This strategy can quickly backfire if the customer’s per­
ception of the request is one of financial weakness (thus the customer needs 
to find another supplier) versus strategic value. Packaging the request or offer 
is of critical importance when using large prepayment requests. Proper pack­
aging ideas tend to center around highlighting the benefit the customer will 
receive with committing upfront or prepayments including guaranteeing 
timely delivery, clearly noting how much upfront costs your business will be 
required to cover to support a project (which they did not have to initially 
cover), and related “benefits.” The customer must be sold on the fact that pro­
viding a prepayment is truly in their best interests.
	
Prepayments, deposits, and advances can greatly improve a customer’s “buy-
in” and commitment to your business, because when customers have “skin 
in the game” (or in other words, have committed real money or capital to a 
specific endeavor or project), their interest and commitment levels tend to 
increase rather quickly. A very effective spin that businesses use to secure 
prepayments is the concept of sharing the risk. The point to make to your cus­
tomer is very straightforward: “We’re putting forth significant efforts and com­
mitting resources to meet your demands, so receiving a like commitment from 
you is more than reasonable”.
Accepting alternative forms of payment
Over the past decade, electronic payment has clearly established itself as 
the new norm, so accepting electronic forms of payment is important for 
improving cash flows. Following is a review of the most common (and not so 
common) forms of payments your business may want to accept:
	
✓	Checks: Checks are still widely used today to process payments, but 
they continue to diminish in popularity. If your business still accepts 
checks (which most do), you can use two strategies to accelerate the 
speed at which your bank clears the check to your bank accounts (thus 
improving cash flows):
 
• If volumes are large enough, you can use a bank lockbox, which 
allows customer payments to be made directly to the bank, 
which can then process them sooner than if your company had to 
receive, process, and deposit the payments first. This strategy also 
provides an additional control procedure in that your internal staff 
doesn’t handle vital financial documents, which could be lost, dam­
aged, and/or stolen.
 
• Banks now support a very effective service that allows your busi­
ness to scan customer checks on a special printer and automati­
cally deposit them via electronic transmission of the key data. This 
strategy also improves speed, accuracy, and safety.

 Chapter 14: Managing the Selling Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
	
✓	ACH (automated clearing house), EFT (electronic funds transfer), 
and wires: Companies both small and large are using these types of elec­
tronic payments to conduct business (refer to Chapter 12 for a further dis­
cussion). Most companies rely on a “push” strategy in which the customer 
initiates the request to remit payment electronically and then pushes the 
payment to the vendor. A strategy that can improve cash flows is to request 
that your customers provide you the right to initiate and “pull” a payment 
from their bank accounts on a specific date and/or according to other 
predetermined criteria). Granted, most customers aren’t overly receptive 
to this type of arrangement, but in certain cases (for example, if they have 
poor credit), it can be used to improve cash flows.
	
✓	Credit, debit, and prepaid cards: The use of credit, debit, and prepaid 
cards as a form of payment continues to expand throughout the coun­
try. If a business is operating in the retail industry, acceptance of credit, 
debit, and prepaid cards is absolutely essential (and these businesses 
should have a merchant account set up from day one).
	
	Businesses whose customers traditionally don’t rely on cards to pro­
cess payments are also looking at setting up merchant accounts to 
accept customer payments, because the customers’ financing sources 
are changing these days. Small-business financing requirements rang­
ing from $25,000 to $250,000 are now actively supported by credit card 
companies that base credit decisions on electronic credit scores, as 
opposed to being supported by the old brick-and-mortar method of 
obtaining a loan from a small community bank. Because your customers 
are likely to use a business credit card instead of cash obtained through 
a loan, your business needs to accept those credit cards. Even though a 
fee of between 2 to 3 percent must be absorbed to process a credit card 
transaction (by your business, because the party accepting credit card 
payments absorbs the fee), it beats having to track down the customer 
and pester them for payment.
	
	Being sensitive to your customer’s billing cutoff dates on credit cards 
can pay off. For example, if your customer’s credit card has a billing 
cutoff date of the 24th of each month, charging the customer’s card on 
the 25th can give the customer an extra 20 to 30 days to pay. Using this 
scenario, if a charge is made on the 24th, the customer is required to 
pay it by the 20th of the following month (or roughly 25 days in a normal 
grace period). By charging it on the 25th, the charge doesn’t post to 
the credit card and appear on the statement until the next billing cycle, 
requiring payment 25 days after that. The benefit to the customer is that 
she receives an extra 25 days to pay the balance due basically interest 
free (assuming that the entire balance on the credit card is paid). The 
benefit to you as a business owner is that you can receive payment 
for the outstanding invoice (improving cash flow) before the end of 
the month to keep the trade accounts receivable aging in good shape 
(because it helps prevent invoices from getting older and increasing the 
days sales outstanding calculation).

✓	Evolving electronic forms of payment: The speed at which technol­
ogy is moving in today’s economy is nothing short of breathtaking. 
Seemingly just yesterday, PayPal established itself as a new and inno­
vative method of processing payments; $71 billion total payment was 
processed in 2009. Today, the largest financial service companies in 
the country are teaming with Google and other technology companies 
to turn your cellphone into a payment-processing tool. Staying on top 
of these trends is extremely important to capture the benefit of both 
improved cash flows (by being able to accept every type of payment 
a customer is offering) and increased sales (because nobody wants to 
turn down a sale because a specific type of payment is not accepted).
	
✓	Trades, offsets, and barters: Due to the economic upheaval experienced 
in recent years, the use of trades, account offsets, and even barter trans­
actions is expanding.
 
• Trades may be utilized when a customer has a specific asset of 
value and wants to exchange it for a balance due. As long as the 
asset is deemed valuable to your company, then getting something 
is better than nothing.
 
• Account offsets apply to customers and suppliers that conduct 
business back and forth. A customer may purchase goods or ser­
vices from your business but at the same time also sell other items 
back to your business. In this case, account offsets can be used 
to simply net a balance due against a balance owed (avoiding the 
need to exchange cash).
	
	Unlike trades or account offsets (which tend to occur after the 
fact), bartering tends to occur before the transaction, with both 
parties agreeing to a predetermined deliverable. For example, a 
CPA firm may offer to complete an advertising company’s annual 
income tax reporting requirements in exchange for the advertising 
company developing and launching a promotional campaign for 
the CPA firm. If barter transactions are used, just make sure that 
they are completed as an arm’s-length transaction (a transaction 
completed at fair market value between two independent parties 
without any undue duress or coercion) and properly documented.
	
Utilizing trade, offset, and barter agreements can be effective, but remember 
to watch out for the tax man. In the eyes of the taxing authorities, these types 
of agreement represent arm’s-length transactions that generate taxable sales 
and expenses. But unlike your business, the tax man does not like to accept 
alternative forms of payment, so be careful not to get trapped by accepting 
too many assets that can’t be efficiently converted into cash.

 Chapter 14: Managing the Selling Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
Managing seasonality in the selling cycle
Almost all companies, in one form or another, have to manage seasonal sell­
ing issues with customers. If your business targets the youth clothing market, 
then be prepared to ramp up before the back-to-school selling season. For 
outdoor furniture, you need to gear up early in the calendar year so large 
customers have products on the floor in the spring for their customers to use 
in the summer.
The ebb and flow of seasonal selling cycles is a fact of life most companies 
simply have to live with, so rather than attempt to significantly influence or 
alter your customer’s buying and paying habits (just to improve your internal 
cash flow), the burden on managing cash flows during the seasons really falls 
on your business. The following strategies can assist with managing impacts 
on cash flows from seasonal factors:
	
✓	Securing additional financial support: A widely used strategy in numer­
ous industries is leveraging financing sources through the busy season 
to improve liquidity and cash availability. Whether your business has 
a lending agreement with built-in features to extend additional credit 
during the peak selling season or you secure and use specialized lending 
sources only during the peak season, working with lending sources is 
one of the most effective ways to support cash needs during this period. 
Factoring groups (see Chapter 11) can offer a flexible financial resource 
Accepting other forms of currency, 
including gold and silver
Companies should be fully prepared to accept 
payment in the form of different world cur­
rencies ranging from the Japanese yen to the 
Chinese yuan to the European euro. Establish 
a proper banking relationship to facilitate the 
acceptance and conversion of global curren­
cies into the almighty U.S. dollar.
Some companies are also finding that they may 
need to be prepared to accept payment in gold 
and silver. In 2011, Utah began allowing gold 
and silver to be legally recognized as a form 
of currency. Gold and silver have been out of 
favor over the past 100 or more years because 
they have been viewed as being an inefficient 
method to conduct business. But the eco­
nomic turmoil since 2007 has shaken the faith 
of people, business, and governments, and as 
a result, gold and silver have regained favor in 
terms of supporting transactions.
Although we’re not prophesying a return 
to gold- and silver-based currency (highly 
unlikely), the development in Utah illustrates is 
how important it is to remain flexible and adapt­
able in accepting different forms of payments to 
improve sales, your business results, and cash 
flows.

to support operations by structuring specialized seasonal lending pro­
grams to support your business (for example, predetermined customer 
accounts are targeted for factoring at set rates). The next section of this 
chapter delves into this issue in more detail.
	
✓	Leveraging your vendors and employees: Chapter 15 dives into this 
subject in more detail, but the general concept is that if your business 
has to manage seasonal peaks and valleys, so should your vendors and 
your employees. For example, you can request extended payment terms 
for a 90-day period from your vendors, and you can pay employee com­
missions on a cash-received-plus-15-days basis.
	
✓	Business planning: Cash and management resources tend to be 
stretched very thin running up to and during the seasonal sales crush. 
After the season ends and business returns to normal operating levels, 
with cash receipts at a peak (from collecting on seasonal sales), the 
opposite tends to occur. As such, business-planning efforts and associ­
ated infrastructure improvements or capital investments are best sched­
uled during this off-peak period in order to help smooth annual cash 
flows and to ensure that management has time to give those improve­
ment and investments the proper amount of attention. Really, how many 
companies in the midst of a seasonal sales crunch want to implement a 
new computer information system?
Managing the Lending Agreement 
in Relation to Your Sales Cycle
A critical concept often overlooked by companies is the way your lending 
agreement is structured in relation to your sales cycle. Your setup can have a 
profound impact on improving cash availability and liquidity.
	
Lending agreements need to be structured in anticipation of the selling cycle 
and not adapted or adjusted during the selling cycle. Financing sources are 
notoriously more difficult to work with when a change is needed mid-stream 
and on short notice, because banks and other lending sources don’t like sur­
prises. So be a good Boy Scout by being prepared and planning well ahead to 
get the most out of your lending agreement. In this section we tell you how to 
prepare in advance and what to look for in a lending agreement.
Defining eligible receivables
Banks define eligible receivables as customer receivables that are available to 
borrow against, not the total receivables owed to a company. Following are 
the most common types of ineligible receivables:

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
305
 Chapter 14: Managing the Selling Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
	
✓	Receivables over 90 days past due (because the bank may think they’re 
uncollectable)
	
✓	Foreign receivables
	
✓	Certain governmental receivables (for example, receivables generated 
from the federal government, which lending sources may not be able to 
legally obtain a secured interest in)
	
✓	Customer receivables with excess concentration levels
	
✓	Related or affiliated party receivables
	
✓	Cross-aged receivables (explained in the “Watching for hidden time 
bombs in your lending agreement” section of this chapter)
The goal for most businesses is to maximize the number of eligible receiv­
ables to maximize the amount of borrowing capacity. Of course, from a 
lender’s perspective, the opposite holds true, as they tend to be more con­
servative (imagine that) and look to reduce eligible receivables.
	
In the context of receivables, the term concentration means that an inordi­
nately high level of sales or receivables is associated with few customers or a 
single customer. Financing sources generally get nervous about high levels of 
concentration because if that customer encounters a problem, the risk of non­
payment and defaulting on the lending agreement increases. Thus, you often 
see a provision in a lending agreement that states that any amount of receiv­
ables above 10 percent of the total receivables associated with one customer 
will be ineligible. So if total receivables are $1,500,000 and one customer com­
prises $300,000 of the balance (or 20 percent), $150,000 (the 10 percent over 
the 10 percent limit) is ineligible to borrow against.
	
Referring to the discussion on the credit review and approval process in 
“Implementing Basic Controls in the Selling Process to Manage Cash,” the ben­
efits of completing a more-thorough credit review flow through to the lending 
agreement. If the financing source can document and support that a large 
customer is financially sound, you can negotiate with the financing source to 
increase the concentration limit for the best and strongest customers (thus 
reducing ineligible receivables and increasing access to liquidity or cash) from 
say 10 percent to 15 or 20 percent. So the extra credit review and approval 
efforts has the dual benefit of providing more confidence in getting paid as 
well as structuring a strong lending arrangement.
Understanding advance rates and dilution
After you determine eligible receivables (and, hopefully, maximize them 
for your company), you next need to manage advance rates. The advance 
rate represents the maximum amount of borrowings that can be secured 
against the eligible receivables. A very typical advance rate is 80 percent, but 
this rate can be negotiated for your business needs or, conversely, may be

306
Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
lowered by the financing source if adverse trends develop, such as increas­
ing levels of dilution or deteriorating collection rates. (In the later section 
“Driving a lending agreement to improve liquidity and access to cash,” 
Figure 14-1 provides an example of how the advance rate works and how 
important it is to manage both eligible receivables and the advance rate to 
increase liquidity and access to cash.)
	
Dilution is a relatively simple ratio calculation all financing sources utilize to 
help determine advance rates. The denominator in the equation is sales fig­
ures over a period of time (such as a year). The numerator is the sum of all 
billing or invoice adjustments made during the same period for transactions 
such as sales returns, discounts offered, bad debts, billing adjustments, and 
other items. For example, if annual sales amount to $6,000,000 and the total 
of all returns, discounts, bad debts, and/or other adjustments is $400,000, the 
dilution rate is 6.67 percent ($400,000 ÷ $6,000,000 × 100). The general rule 
of thumb is that for each 5 percent increase in dilution, the advance rate is 
decreased by 5 percent (from a base rate of 80 percent). So in this situation, 
the advance rate is reduced to 75 percent because 6.67 percent is above the 
first 5 percent dilution increment.
	
Producing CART invoices is critical to getting the most out of your lending 
agreement. (If you need a reminder about CART, refer to the earlier section 
“Supplying CART — complete, accurate, reliable, and timely — invoices.”). 
Lending sources don’t like to see numerous adjustments and changes made 
to invoices after issuance. Changes make them nervous and raise questions 
about the strength of your internal policies and procedures. Something as 
simple as a billing address error (which requires the original invoice to be 
voided and a new invoice to be issued) increases the amount of adjustments 
as calculated by the bank, which in turn drives the numerator higher and the 
dilution rate higher (thus lowering the advance rate). Even if all other informa­
tion is correct, this one simple adjustment shows up as a billing correction, 
which can influence the lending agreement.
Watching for hidden time bombs 
in your lending agreement
A number of other terms and conditions within your lending agreement need 
to be understood, and probably managed, to improve available liquidity. 
Following are some of the more common terms and conditions to be sensi­
tive to and manage:
	
✓	Cross-aging factor: A term and condition usually buried within lending 
agreements that can be very nasty is a cross-aging factor. In its simplest 
form, a cross-aging factor is applied on a customer basis and states that 
if X percent of a customer’s balance due is more than Y days old (60 or 
90 days are common), then the entire receivable is ineligible to borrow 
against. Common cross-aging factors range from 20 to 25 percent, but

 Chapter 14: Managing the Selling Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
note that if the test is applied and fails by even the slightest amount 
(20.1 percent past 60 days with the limit of 20 percent established), you 
get no margin for error (and the total of the receivable will be deemed 
ineligible).
	
	You can probably see where we’re going with this tip: Managing your 
slow-paying customers to somehow always having a cross-aging factor 
calculation of just below the limit established (say 18 percent compared 
to a 20-percent limit as set by the bank) can keep your eligible receiv­
able levels higher and thus access to cash higher. By working closely 
with customers to make sure that just enough older invoices are paid 
and processing adjustments to older invoices in a timely fashion, you 
can meet the target. Just double check that the calculations are accurate 
and supportable, because the last thing your business needs is for a 
bank auditor to challenge your reporting.
	
✓	Financial covenants: Lending sources use financial covenants to ensure 
that the borrower’s financial strength remains above predetermined 
levels to support the ability to repay the loan. These covenants come 
in all sizes, shapes, and forms and are generally based on the financial 
information presented by the borrower to secure the loan. Understand 
two key concepts about financial covenants:
 
• If you violate a financial covenant, the lending relationship will 
become strained. The normal reaction from the lending source is 
to tighten up your ability to borrow (restricting liquidity and cash 
availability).
 
• You don’t want to let the lending source dictate the financial 
covenants according to generic standards applied by banks and 
other lending sources. Every business has a unique selling and 
operating cycle, which can result in widely varying financial perfor­
mances between different times of the year. Lending sources tend 
to be relatively conservative and narrow minded when establish­
ing financial covenants, so you need to educate them on expected 
business operating performances.
	
	A bank wanted to establish a minimum quarterly profitability financial 
covenant for a staffing company requiring that a positive profit be real­
ized each quarter. Given the seasonality of the staffing industry, with 
the first and fourth quarters being relatively poor and the second and 
third quarters being stronger, the covenant was changed to generat­
ing a positive profit on a rolling four-quarter basis. With these terms, a 
weaker quarter that produced a loss would not cause a violation of the 
covenant.
	
✓	Reporting requirements: Financing sources normally place a signifi­
cant amount of reporting requirements in the primary loan agreement, 
including providing annual tax returns, monthly or quarterly financial 
statements, monthly borrowing base certificates, annual personal finan­
cial statements (for the owners of the business), trade receivable and 
payable agings, and other reports as deemed necessary. Complying with

308
Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
all reporting requirements is important to ensure that you maintain a 
healthy relationship with your lending sources.
	
	In recent years, banks and other financing companies have come under 
increasing pressure from external auditors, examiners, the government, 
and/or other parties to improve the quality of the loans extended. One 
surefire way to cause problems and damage your ability to borrow is to 
fail to comply with all reporting requirements.
	
✓	Other borrowing restrictions: Quite often, financing sources place 
restrictions on the maximum amount of other loans that can be obtained 
while the current lending facility is in force. For example, a company 
may want to secure a loan (from another financing source) to purchase 
additional property and equipment that’s not part of the lending agree­
ment with the primary financing source. Assuming that this loan is 
below the amount established in the lending agreement, the company 
can secure the loan with no ramifications. If the loan is greater than the 
maximum amount established, a waiver from the primary lender needs 
to be obtained (to avoid defaulting on the agreement).
	
	The problem with this type restriction is that it can limit the ability for 
a company to secure cash from other sources of nontrade debt (thus 
impairing a potential source of cash). Give careful consideration to 
structuring this term in the primary lending agreement.
	
✓	Hidden fees and charges: The list of additional fees and charges financ­
ing sources can think up is endless. To start, a loan-origination fee may 
be charged, which is nothing more than a percentage charge the financ­
ing source earns to originate the loan. A 1 percent loan-origination fee 
is very common — but remember that you can negotiate, so countering 
with 0.5 percent would not being unreasonable. Then be prepared to 
pay for a collateral exam completed by either the financing source or 
an external third party. In order to confirm the assets you intend to use 
as collateral are sound, they must be audited. Also be prepared to pay 
the legal fees incurred by the financing source to draft the agreement. 
So even before the loan is accessible, substantial expenses have already 
been racked up.
	
	After you’ve closed, you may still incur fees. Say you’re using 65 per­
cent of the loan on average for the year. That’s not bad, but be careful, 
because some loans incorporate an unused loan charge for the average 
amount of the loan not used during the year. Imagine that; you’ve done 
a great job minimizing the use of the loan and lower interest charges, 
but you still get stung with a fee to the financing source for just provid­
ing the commitment. And finally, to add insult to injury, if you secure a 
better lending facility before the initial term of the original loan expires, 
you can most likely expect an early termination or prepayment fee to 
be charged.

 Chapter 14: Managing the Selling Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
	
Financing sources have to compete for your business like everyone else, so 
when securing financing, get competitive bids. The hidden fees and charges 
are negotiable, so take advantage of opportunities to push back on pricing 
when presented. Remember, financing sources are going to get you coming 
and going, so any terms and conditions that can be structured to lower the 
overall cost of the loan should be pursued.
As the saying goes, the devil is in the details, especially for lending agree­
ments. If you don’t make an effort to read and understand all the terms and 
conditions (the fine print), something in the agreement will undoubtedly 
come back to bite you in the rear end.
Driving a lending agreement to improve 
liquidity and access to cash
Figure 14-1 displays a typical lending agreement, with limited-active manage­
ment compared to a proactively managed and structured lending agreement 
in relation to a company’s selling cycle. The impact on available borrowings 
and access to cash are significant, both in added cash available ($162,000) 
and as a percentage increase (15.76 percent).
For the purposes of Figure 14-1, limited-active management equates into the 
column titled standard bank terms, which basically means that the bank is 
setting the terms of the lending agreement based on their boilerplate offer­
ings. The proactively managed column is headed by the description of com­
pany structured terms and basically indicates that the company has actively 
and aggressively negotiated with the bank to establish the terms and condi­
tions of the lending agreement. This document would most likely be prepared 
by the company securing the financing to properly evaluate and compare 
what the bank is offering versus what the company needs (and has hope­
fully, successfully structured) and to evaluate if the added availability of cash 
would come at any additional costs.
The last section of the figure shows a simple analysis on the impact hidden 
fees and charges may have on the transaction. In this example, the company 
was able to reduce the loan origination fee from 1 percent to 0.5 percent, 
place a cap on examination and legal fees of $5,000 (versus higher actual), 
and remove the unused loan-commitment fee (which the financing source 
was attempting to charge at a rate of 0.25 percent for the year). These more-
favorable terms helped reduce the hidden fees and charges by almost half, 
from roughly $21,000 to $11,000.

C

hapter 14 evaluates how a business can manage its relationship with cus­
tomers throughout the selling cycle to improve cash flows and liquidity. 
In this chapter, we evaluate the exact opposite of the selling cycle — the dis­
bursement (that is, expenditure) cycle. We explore how a business working 
with creditors can squeeze cash from the disbursement cycle. Throughout, 
we note numerous similarities between the two chapters, which of course is 
logical, because a business paying money from its disbursement cycle repre­
sents a part of someone else’s selling cycle (in terms of receiving cash).
	
To gain a better understanding of the disbursement cycle in terms of how 
cash flows can be improved, first read Chapter 14 on the selling cycle so that 
you can simply think about those points from a different perspective. If dis­
counts are offered to customers to accelerate payments, think of how your 
business can utilize any discounts being offered from suppliers to improve 
operating results. Or if a supplier is placing pressure on your business to pay 
obligations, confirm lending agreement terms to see how making just enough 
payments at the right time keeps their lending facility maximized.
Tracing the Entire Disbursement Cycle
The concept of the disbursement cycle can be looked at from the same two 
perspectives as the selling cycle: the accounting/financial view versus the 
strategic view.

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
The accounting/financial disbursement cycle generally starts when a commit­
ment is made to purchase goods or services. For larger companies, the com­
mitment is supported by the generation of a purchase order, which identifies 
the type, quantity, price, technical specifications, delivery dates, and other 
terms and conditions of the goods or services to be purchased.
For smaller companies without a formal purchase order system, another 
form of positive confirmation (such as an e-mail, fax, or even a simple phone 
call) is generally used to support the purchase request. The accounting/
financial cycle then proceeds with the receipt of the goods or services pur­
chased and then finishes when final payment is made. Similar to the sales 
accounting/financial cycle, the disbursement accounting/financial cycle is 
fairly narrow in scope and is based on “hard” transactional documentation.
From a strategic perspective, the disbursement cycle is much broader 
in scope and starts from the initial point of planning, running all the way 
through managing vendors and suppliers well after payments have been 
made. For example, a technology company that has developed a new acces­
sory for a personal computer must develop a production plan that starts well 
before the first purchase order is ever issued. Suppliers must be identified 
and qualified as part of the overall production plan to ensure that forecast 
commitments can be satisfied (as the accessory is rolled out to the market). 
These suppliers may range from a manufacturer of a key component to an 
advertising firm retained to market the accessory.
On the tail end of the disbursement cycle, the management of vendors and 
suppliers continues well after their last invoice is paid, as invaluable business 
information is generated from managing the follow-up process proactively. 
Even after the primary thrust of the advertising and promotional campaign 
has been undertaken and the bills paid, the company can mine data related 
to customer purchasing trends, feedback, what worked, and what didn’t 
work. Accumulating valuable business intelligence from vendors and suppli­
ers is part of the ongoing and management-intensive disbursement process 
that extends well past the last invoice payment.
	
Looking at the disbursement cycle through the strategic view emphasizes how 
much cash is required and consumed well before the first purchase order is 
executed and well after the vendor/supplier is paid. If these cash requirements 
are not properly planned for, then you to will most likely experience the pain 
and suffering of not securing enough cash (or capital) to properly operate 
your business.

 Chapter 15: Managing the Disbursement Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
Taking Critical Steps in the Disbursement 
Cycle to Manage Cash
The most important difference between managing the selling cycle to 
improve cash flows compared to working the disbursement cycle for cash 
is also the simplest to understand: You control cash in the disbursements 
cycle, whereas your customer controls the cash in the selling cycle. This dif­
ference is no doubt significant, but in most other ways the cycles are very 
similar in the way they relate to establishing basic accounting policies, proce­
dures, and controls to protect all business assets (including cash). The three 
critical steps explained in the following section — qualifying suppliers and 
vendors, establishing proper controls, and managing creditors — provide 
you with a better understanding of the basics of the disbursement cycle.
Qualifying suppliers and vendors
Good vendors and suppliers are essential to the ongoing profitable opera­
tions of your business. In fact, qualifying suppliers and vendors is just as 
important, if not more so, than qualifying customers. Whether a vendor pro­
vides a critical raw material component in the final finished good or simply 
sells your company the proper insurance coverage, you want that vendor to 
be reliable and provide the highest quality product or service.
Numerous resources and procedures are available to help you properly qual­
ify suppliers and vendors. Following are some of the more popular strategies:
	
✓	Request sample or trial runs. Before a significant commitment is made 
with a vendor or supplier, companies often request a trial period, during 
which a reduced level of business is conducted so that both parties can 
properly evaluate the feasibility of a larger and longer relationship. The 
old saying of learning to walk before you run can definitely apply to new 
vendor relationships.
	
✓	Tap industry and third-party references. Countless resources are 
available for access from both trade and regional sources to obtain 
references on vendors and suppliers. From contacting the local Better 
Business Bureau (BBB) to reading online reviews to attending industry 
trade events, the basic concept always remains the same. Use available 
public and private resources to do your homework and follow through 
on references.
	
✓	Put it in writing. Making sure that clear and concise terms, conditions, 
and relationship expectations are established in advance serves a 
couple of purposes. First, both parties will be able to set expectations 
on which to operate and support the relationship. Second, you’ll get a 
red flag if a vendor or supplier remains vague and noncommittal about 
relationship expectations.

314
Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
	
✓	Trust your instinct. Successful business owners usually have a great 
instinct when it comes to establishing relationships with third parties, 
so always taking a moment to step back to assess a vendor or supplier is 
usually very helpful.
	
Don’t be consumed with using price as the only decision point. Sure, a vendor 
or supplier may offer the best price, but if the product or service quality is 
substandard and delivery times are unreliable, the ultimate price your busi­
ness may pay will be far greater than saving a few percentage points.
Establishing proper disbursement 
cycle controls
When establishing proper disbursement cycle controls, keep in mind the con­
cept of CART (complete, accurate, reliable, and timely). Just like in the selling 
cycle, disbursement cycle failures, inefficiencies, and/or errors will ultimately 
have a negative impact on cash flows and cash availability (over the long 
run). Management should make the same effort in establishing proper dis­
bursement-cycle controls, policies, and procedures as with the selling cycle, 
because cash leakage potential represents an even greater risk.
Establishing, implementing, and maintaining proper accounting policies, 
procedures, and controls varies by company and industry but should encom­
pass the following basics:
	
✓	Utilize a purchase-order system. Although implementing a formal pur­
chase-order system isn’t practical for every business, using some sort 
of system that ensures proper review, approval, and authorizations for 
purchases of goods and services are made prior to making a firm com­
mitment should be adhered to. The idea is to avoid errors and mistakes 
before they happen (which are often very costly) by making sure that 
the appropriate management team members approve and authorize 
transactions.
	
	Smaller businesses generally don’t have resources available to imple­
ment a formal purchase-order system. But the lack of resources should 
not prevent even the smallest business from making sure that purchases 
or goods and/or services are properly approved and authorized. Senior 
management, and quite often the founder, president, and CEO, should 
explicitly instruct both internal employees and external vendors and 
suppliers that they (that is, senior management and others) are the only 
parties who can authorize purchases. Always establish and utilize a very 
simple internal policy that clearly relays authority levels.

315
 Chapter 15: Managing the Disbursement Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
	
✓	Implement proper approval and authorization procedures. Proper 
approval and authorization levels among the senior management team 
should be established and reviewed/updated on a periodic basis. For 
example, a purchasing manager may be given the authority to purchase 
$20,000 worth of raw materials, but if the order exceeds this level, then 
the manufacturing general manager’s approval is required. Further, if 
the order exceeds $100,000, then the company’s president would be 
required to approve the purchase. The greater the risk to the company, 
the higher the level of authorization that should be required.
	
	Business contracts related to real property leases, lending agreements, 
credit card processing, bank account access, and the like should almost 
always be executed by a legal officer of the company, because most 
third parties require an officer’s signature to properly bind the contract. 
These types of financing-based agreements differ from more-traditional 
purchase agreements because the risks to both the company and third 
parties is far greater, which in turn requires the need for actual officer 
approvals and signatures.
	
✓	Match, check, and verify. Businesses should always make a concerted 
effort to match vendor and supplier invoices again original issued pur­
chase orders (if utilized), receiving reports, executed contracts, and/
or any other information available to ensure that the vendor invoice is 
correct. If you assume that every vendor or supplier invoice received 
is accurate, then you are going to be in for a rude awakening. Various 
sources estimates that two to four percent of all invoices contain errors, 
and in some industries such as healthcare, the error rate is closer to 30 
to 40 percent. 
	
✓	Segregate duties. If your business has the resources available, segregate 
different disbursement cycle functions among different employees. For 
instance, if material is received in the warehouse, have the warehouse 
staff be responsible for verifying the amount, quality, specifications, and 
so on of the material against the original purchase order. If correct, this 
information should then pass to the accounting department, which can 
verify the price on the vendor’s invoice against the original purchase 
order and, if accurate, proceed to process the vendor invoice.
	
	Smaller businesses may not have the luxury of having multiple depart­
ments that can assume different duties, so making sure that at least a 
couple of relatively independent parties are reviewing and approving 
vendor invoices will help improve accuracy, reduce errors, and avoid 
processing incorrect payments. For instance, an accounting manager 
may receive, review, and input a vendor invoice in the accounting 
system (for subsequent payment processing). When the invoice is 
selected for payment, a senior management team member with payment 
authority should review the invoice again prior to finalizing the payment.

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
	
✓	Control the last line of defense — payment authorization. Finally, the 
last line of defense for most businesses in the disbursement cycle is at the 
final check-signing stage (or, in this electronic age, before the send button 
is hit). A final review and approval of all disbursements should be under­
taken by only the most senior management team members to ensure that 
when payments are processed, they are as accurate as possible.
	
One final thought we want to share, and a statement that may surprise you, 
is a warning to never allow your senior accounting and finance personnel to 
process payments. The reason why not is very logical when you ask your­
self one simple question: “Who is best able to commit and conceal fraud in a 
business?” Everyone’s heard the story about the bookkeeper of 30 years, so 
dedicated to the company and always so reliable and trustworthy until the 
unthinkable is discovered — the bookkeeper has been bilking the company 
over the years. By implementing a simple segregation of duty policy of requir­
ing a senior manager independent of the accounting and finance group to 
review and process final payments, you can often be very effective in prevent­
ing your business from becoming a poster child for this kind of theft.
Managing external creditors
The overview of the accounting-based perspective of the disbursement cycle 
ends in the previous section, because after the vendor has been paid, the 
cycle is for the most part complete. But strategically, the management of 
external creditors, ranging from vendors and suppliers to lending sources 
such as banks, is an ongoing process with a direct impact on cash flows and 
cash availability.
Probably the most important component of managing external creditors is 
keeping lines of communication open. Speaking from experience, nothing is 
worse than failing to communicate with a bank and then delivering a very 
unwelcome financial or operating performance “surprise.” The same can hold 
true for critical vendors as well, because if they are blindsided by unexpected 
events or requests, not only will they become nervous about getting paid 
but they also may feel somewhat slighted and change their attitude toward 
your business, shifting from being a partner (and willing to work with you) to 
being nothing more than another creditor. Be sure to communicate clearly 
and proactively about both good and bad news because creditors want to 
have an opportunity to proactively manage a potential problem, as well as to 
participate in your success.
But even with a solid communication plan in place, not all business informa­
tion should be provided to the creditor, because the vast majority of the info 
is either irrelevant or confidential. Make sure that just the most appropriate 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
317
 Chapter 15: Managing the Disbursement Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
and relevant business information is provided to the creditor. In addition, 
smaller and less-important creditors don’t require the same type of commu­
nication effort and plan as key creditors do. For example, you’re not going to 
provide the same information to the company watering the office plants as 
you do to the bank providing your financing.
	
Make a concerted effort to properly edit, cleanse, scrub, package, and/or 
prepare business information that will be distributed externally. There is a 
significant difference between financial and operational information used 
for internal management purposes and information distributed to external 
parties for review and evaluation. Externally provided information is usually 
presented in a more summarized format, focused on more general/macro-level 
issues, and avoids disclosing confidential data. Furthermore, a notice that the 
information is proprietary and confidential should always accompany it.
	
In the business world you often hear NDA, which stands for a nondisclosure 
agreement, and CA, which stands for confidentiality agreement. These agree­
ments are used when confidential business information must be shared 
between parties in order to support a specific transaction or relationship. 
The basic idea with these agreements is to ensure that any information being 
shared between the parties remains confidential, and if one party violates 
the agreement, then damages may result. We recommend that you work with 
professional counsel (such as lawyers) to draft these agreements when critical 
and confidential business information is shared.
Establishing open lines of communications between your business and its 
vendors and suppliers is a great way to harvest invaluable and, to a certain 
extent, nonpublic market and industry information. Chances are, one of your 
suppliers also supports one of your competitors, so although the supplier 
may not intentionally disclose useful information, it never hurts to keep your 
ears and eyes open to information that may be of keen interest.
	
Communication with and management of creditors is often critical to your 
own business’s health. In one situation, a large contractor relied on multiple 
suppliers and vendors to source products for an end product sold to the gov­
ernment. One supplier of critical importance (this supplier provided a highly 
technical component that could not be readily provided by other parties) 
experienced financial difficulties and began to experience delivery problems. 
By having strong communications between the parties, delivery problems 
were averted because the contractor was able to step in and provide addi­
tional financial support (to ensure no disruption to the supply chain). If the 
contractor had not stepped forward, a single component, comprising less than 
2 percent of the total end product, would have caused significant delivery 
delays and resulted in reduced cash flows (as without product delivery, no 
customer payments would be received).

Getting Creative to Improve Cash Flows 
from the Disbursement Cycle
Most businesses don’t have the luxury of General Motors (having Uncle Sam 
available with billions of dollars of emergency cash) and banks (structur­
ing TARP, or Troubled Asset Relief Program, to provide emergency liquid­
ity during the financial crisis of the Great Recession) or of being too big to 
fail (we just had to make reference to that term at least once in the book). 
Rather, most businesses have to operate under the context of TSTC — too 
small to care. The government really never came running to the thousands of 
struggling small businesses with any type of financial rescue program. When 
faced with economic difficulty, the majority of businesses have to buckle 
down and return to their entrepreneurial roots not only to develop a survival 
strategy but also to identify new and creative ways to generate cash. Within 
these cases, a primary target is squarely placed on the disbursement cycle. 
Honestly, if your sales have decreased and your customers are taking longer 
to pay, then what better way to generate cash than turning about and taking 
longer to pay your own vendors?
	
When utilizing more-creative strategies to improve cash flows from the dis­
bursement cycle, understand the following two key concepts:
	
✓	First, being creative does not mean being dishonest or manipulative. In 
fact, when creative strategies are used to improve cash flow from the 
disbursement cycle, just the opposite occurs, as working with vendors 
and suppliers (to improve cash flows) requires the utmost management 
and business credibility.
	
✓	Second, using creative disbursement-cycle strategies to improve cash 
flows almost always comes at a cost. It may be an outright interest 
charge from the vendor, a higher lease payment, increased material 
costs, or something else, but in one form or another, an added cost is 
going to be present. The key is understanding the trade-off between 
improving cash flows and the increased cost.
Leaning on vendors and suppliers
When looking for ways to generate additional cash from the disbursement 
cycle, the starting point is with your vendors and suppliers that have pro­
vided goods or services to your business and are now looking for payment. 
Vendors and suppliers are in business, too, have most likely experienced 
some form of past cash-flow problems (and have felt your pain), and they 
don’t want to lose you as a customer. Therefore, you should have some room 
for negotiation.

319
 Chapter 15: Managing the Disbursement Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
Leaning on vendors and suppliers is widely used when a little extra support 
is needed and can be particularly effective when critical vendors are lever­
aged. Every business has both critical and noncritical vendors and suppliers. 
Critical vendors and suppliers tend to be deeply engrained in your business 
by providing large amounts of goods or services that are essential to the sell­
ing cycle. In addition, critical vendors also tend to have very strong and long-
lasting business relationships that can be leveraged from time to time based 
on past trust, business volumes, and friendships.
	
A word of caution, however: Looking to critical vendors for a break should 
really be the exception rather than the rule. Constantly going back to the well 
for support will eventually lead to deeper concerns by the critical vendor 
about your business, and this strategy could eventually backfire if the vendor 
restricts credit. So when you absolutely need to rely on this strategy, make 
sure to stay proactively engaged with the critical vendors and keep communi­
cation lines open and clear.
Another vendor strategy that businesses often look to utilize is to establish 
relationships with multiple like suppliers. By doing this, multiple benefits 
may be realized, including increasing total available credit (because if you get 
$50,000 in credit from each of four suppliers as opposed to two, the amount 
of potential credit is doubled), ensuring price competition, and maintaining 
a reliable supply chain. However, downsides exist as well in terms of realiz­
ing lost purchase-volume discounts (because if you split your orders among 
four vendors instead of using just one, you may lose pricing leverage), added 
administrative and management time requirements to support multiple ven­
dors, and so on.
Using staffing companies
Employees are expensive (which we’re sure 
is not news to anyone). On top of their base 
compensation, employers have to pay benefits 
galore. And to add insult to injury, employees 
don’t offer payment terms — they must be paid 
regularly and on time. An entire section of this 
chapter is dedicated to leveraging employ­
ees for cash, but the first tip or strategy that 
businesses can use to help manage the cash 
requirements associated with employees is to 
use personnel staffing companies (or temps) 
when the opportunity is right.
For a fee, the personnel staffing company will 
handle all the employment issues associated 
with an employee and bill your company as 
agreed. Using personnel staffing companies 
not only transfers the risks and management 
responsibilities of the employees to the staffing 
company but also may give you the opportunity 
to secure payment terms of net 15 to net 30 
(meaning that you have 15 or 30 days to pay the 
staffing company from the date of the invoice). 
By basically turning the personnel staffing com­
pany into a bank, you can increase cash flows.

Using JIT payment strategies
You can hold on to cash as long as possible by relying on JIT payment strate­
gies. JIT stands for just in time. In Chapter 14 we discuss how you can work 
with your customers to ensure that payments are received just at the right 
time to maximize available liquidity from a lending facility. In the disburse­
ment cycle, the same logic holds (but in reverse): By understanding your 
vendor’s financing programs, you know when they require your payments or 
face liquidity issues or problems on their end. Needless to say, your vendors 
are going to continue to keep the pressure on you to adhere to the payment 
terms extended, but if your business experiences a tight period of cash flow, 
having the knowledge of just how far you can push your vendors without cre­
ating any management headaches is often a very helpful piece of data.
Of course getting your vendors to cough up this information is much easier 
said than done because most would prefer to keep this piece of data confi­
dential. So a few strategies can be used to obtain the information:
	
✓	First, if your business has a strong relationship with the vendor’s senior 
management team, then asking about the vendor’s financing terms, at a 
general level, is not unreasonable.
	
✓	Second, having good contacts and industry resources that your busi­
ness can leverage about what current market terms and conditions are 
for financing agreements can be used as a general reference point.
	
✓	Finally, look to your company’s financing relationship for a reference 
point. Chances are, if they are tightening your terms based on economic 
conditions, the same will hold for other financing companies.
	
Originally, the concept of JIT was applied to the inventory supply chain. In 
order to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, waste, and losses, supply 
chains were structured to ensure the right amount and type of inventory was 
always available to support downstream sales. The use of JIT business strate­
gies has been expanded to other areas as well, including JIT financing (for 
start-ups that receive funding just in time) and JIT employees (working aggres­
sively with temporary staffing companies to make sure that the right amount 
and type of employees are needed just at the right time).
Grading your vendors and suppliers
When times are tight (translation: cash resources are very limited), knowing 
which vendors have to be paid and which vendors can wait may mean the 
difference between survival and failure. When your business experiences a 
cash crunch, you can determine which vendors and suppliers get paid first 
by assigning a “grade” to identify their relative importance to the ongoing 
operations of a business. The higher the grade, the more critical a vendor or 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
321
 Chapter 15: Managing the Disbursement Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
supplier is to the business. The lower the grade, well, those vendors and sup­
pliers will get paid when cash becomes available.
Here we present a simple A-through-D grading system, but companies may 
use number schemes, color-coding, and/or other measurement systems 
as preferred.
	
✓	Grade A: These vendors represent the highest level of importance in 
terms of keeping the lights on, the doors open, and ensuring that sales 
continue to be made. In addition, these vendors tend to retain leverage 
on your business in one fashion or another. A critical product compo­
nent supplier, bank or financing company, and landlord tend to fall into 
this group.
	
✓	Grade B: Grade B vendors tend to have a number of similarities to the 
grade A vendors but can be pushed around a little bit (for example, you 
can ask for another 15 to 30 days to pay) and don’t have quite as much 
leverage (because replacement vendors are available, for instance). 
Noncritical product component suppliers and some professional service 
providers tend to fall into this group.
	
✓	Grade C: The grade C vendors are the first group that can really be 
stretched on the payment front, because they don’t provide essential 
and/or critical goods or services to the company (that is, they aren’t 
needed on a daily basis to operate). An example of a grade C vendor is a 
temporary staffing company that your business no longer needs but that 
has past-due bills outstanding.
	
✓	Grade D or F (if you like): At the bottom of the barrel are the grade D 
or F vendors. These vendors tend to have no leverage, provide goods 
and services that are not needed, and really have no long-term strategic 
importance to the business. As much as these vendors would hate to 
admit it, they fall into the prime category of potentially receiving a “hair­
cut” or “cram down” when payments are made. An example of these 
vendors is an advertising agency (supporting a terminated promotional 
campaign) or a material supplier for a discontinued product line.
	
The terms haircut and cram down essentially mean that the vendor, supplier, 
or even a creditor is not going to receive 100 percent of the balance they’re 
owed. Haircuts are usually voluntary, in that the creditor understands that a 
loss will be realized and works toward achieving the best outcome possible 
(for example, 70 percent on the dollar). A cram down tends to be delivered in 
a harsher context via the debtor “cramming down” a settlement to the credi­
tor. Call it what you may, if you believe that your business is graded as a D or 
F by one of your customers, be prepared to settle for what you can and move 
on with life. Although you will most likely never know what “grade” your busi­
ness has been assigned, astute business owners can usually quickly figure out 
where they fall on the food chain in terms of determining just how valuable 
they are to their customer.

The grading of vendors and suppliers is highly confidential information that 
should be guarded very closely internally. Nothing is worse than letting this 
information slip out to vendors and suppliers and then having to respond to 
the angry C and D rated vendors and suppliers.
Floating along
Years ago, in the good old business days when most payments were pro­
cessed via check and the banks hadn’t fully embraced digital technology, 
a tried-and-proven method of improving cash flow was to use the float. For 
example, a company would process vendor payments on Friday of each week 
and drop the checks in the mail (of course, after the last post office pickup 
of the day). Vendors would then receive payment early the following week, 
deposit the funds in their bank accounts, and wait for the banks to clear the 
checks, which could result in a payment taking as long as a week to transfer 
from the business to vendors. The issuing company therefore had a little 
extra time (a week) to work on customer payments to cover outstanding 
checks. This strategy truly defined the old saying, “The check’s in the mail.”
Now welcome to the 21st century. Between the advances in technology and 
the adoption of electronic payment processing, the float has almost entirely 
disappeared in terms of having any type of material impact on cash flows. A 
week of float has now turned into a day of float as modern technology greatly 
improves payment-processing efficiency as well as helping to reduce fraud.
But float strategies are still available for creative companies, just in a differ­
ent capacity. A prime example of using the float relates to processing pay­
ments with credit cards. If your business regularly pays certain vendors by 
using credit cards, you can realize benefits by setting payments to occur one 
day after the billing cutoff date. If your business’s credit card has a cutoff 
date on the 20th of each month (due on the 15th of the next month), process­
ing a vendor payment on the 22nd rolls this charge into the next billing cycle 
and provides another 30+ days to pay.
	
Utilizing the credit card payment cutoff date doesn’t mean that a higher credit 
balance is available. Rather, the goal is to simply buy an extra 30 to 40 days 
of interest-free financing to support your business operations. Of course, this 
strategy assumes (and it’s a big assumption) that discipline is maintained and 
credit card balances are paid in full each month. If not, the interest charges 
on the outstanding credit card balances can quickly turn this strategy into a 
money-losing event.
	
This tip may be overkill, but we recommend getting to know your vendor pay­
ment-processing habits and trends in order to try to identify which vendors 
still are slow to deposit/process payments and which utilize the most 
advanced techniques to quickly process payments. For some businesses, 
every little bit of cash flow helps.

 Chapter 15: Managing the Disbursement Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
Creating cash from inventory
Manufacturing, stocking, maintaining, purchasing, and managing inventory is 
often one of the worst offending areas within a business in terms of consum­
ing excess cash. Left unattended, inventory quickly becomes the ultimate 
black hole in terms of sucking cash right off the balance sheet. Proactive 
management of inventory (that is, actively managing inventory product lines 
to identify and reduce or eliminate slow-moving, obsolete, and/or poor-
performing items to improve inventory turnover rates) is without question 
the best strategy available to avoid incurring additional risk of loss with both 
obsolete inventory and tied-up cash. However, alternative strategies are also 
available to help turn inventory into cash (as described in the following two 
real-world examples).
	
A manufacturer of high technology products required fairly expensive raw 
materials and chemicals in the production process. In order to improve avail­
ability and reliability of certain key products, a primary vendor agreed to 
store the inventory on the manufacturer’s site, which was accessed on an “as 
needed” basis. When the raw material was accessed and used, a report was 
generated once a week, invoices produced, and the manufacturer was pro­
vided net 30 days to pay. This strategy worked well for the vendor because 
the manufacturer was a large customer that it wanted to provide the highest 
value service to. In addition, the vendor had excess financial resources avail­
able to support this strategy. For the manufacturer, not having to purchase, 
warehouse, and manage this raw material provided the ultimate opportunity 
to utilize a JIT inventory strategy. (If you missed it, the earlier section “Using 
JIT payment strategies” describes the JIT concept.)
	
Here’s another helpful example: A jewelry retailer required a large amount of 
inventory in the form of precious metals and stones to ensure that enough 
products were on the store shelves for the all-important holiday selling 
season. A primary supplier of precious stones agreed to consign the stones 
over half a karat and accept 14-day payment terms after the consigned inven­
tory was sold. By consigning the inventory, the supplier technically remained 
the legal owner of the large stones but, at the same time, made sure that its 
large stones were available for sale (improving operating results). For the jew­
elry retailer, having the right product available at the right time improved its 
operating results as well.
These inventory strategies by no means represent a complete listing of all the 
options available. However, when using these types of strategies, remember 
the key point: There’s no such thing as a free lunch. If your business is going 
to use these types of strategies, somewhere and somehow, your vendors or 
suppliers will build in added costs in the price of the materials to compen­
sate for your business using their cash and assets.

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
Tapping vendor-provided financing
Probably the most common type of credit extended from vendors and sup­
pliers is net 30, which means that the payment is due within 30 days of the 
invoice date. Countless other vendor credit terms are available and range 
from due in advance (for rent payments) to net 90 days or more (to support 
seasonal sales). Following are two more opportunities available to tap vendor-
provided financing to improve cash flows:
	
✓	Insurance: Insurance premiums for general liability, umbrella, auto, 
directors and officers, and other forms of annual coverage requirements 
are usually billed 100 percent in advance (for the entire year). Inquiring 
with the broker or insurance company about financing options is worth­
while, though, because for financial strong companies, very attractive 
payment plans are often available. (For example, you may get 20 percent 
down with the balance due in nine equal installments at 4 percent per 
annum).
	
✓	Leasehold improvements: Most businesses at one point or another 
lease real property to support their operations. As the business evolves, 
expands, and/or market conditions change, updates to the leased space 
may be required. If the landlord doesn’t want to make these leasehold 
improvements or updates on his nickel (which is most often the case), 
you will be responsible for paying for the leasehold improvements. 
One strategy to consider is to go back to the landlord and ask whether 
he will absorb the leasehold improvement costs and then adjust the 
rental rate moving forward. If the increase is reasonable, then instead of 
coming out of pocket from day one to cover the leasehold improvement 
costs, the costs can be amortized over the life of the lease.
	
For larger and more-infrequent transactions, it never hurts to ask about 
financing options. Most larger, astute, and savvy vendors and suppliers will 
already be working with third-party financing sources to make your life (as 
their customer) as easy as possible.
Leveraging Your Employees for Cash
The majority of this chapter has been focused on managing the disburse­
ment cycle to improve cash flows from the perspective of external third par­
ties such as material suppliers, corporate vendors, and professional service 
providers. At this point, we want to explore how companies leverage their 
employees and manage the payroll and compensation cycle to improve cash 
flows without violating the plethora of rules, regulations, and laws designed 
to protect employees.

325
 Chapter 15: Managing the Disbursement Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
	
Federal and state laws alike have been designed to protect employees and 
ensure that they are paid in a timely manner (in addition to ensuring that all 
payroll taxes and other payroll associated obligations are paid in a timely 
manner as well). Although opportunities are present to leverage the payroll 
and compensation cycle to improve cash flows, they aren’t numerous given 
the relatively stringent regulatory environment.
Timing commissions and bonuses
One of the most effective and legitimate strategies used by businesses to 
properly match cash receipts with disbursements is to structure commission 
and bonus plans in a consistent manner with the receipt of cash from sales.
	
✓	Commissions: The simplest strategy to use with commissions is to defer 
the payment of any sales commission earned until the cash has been 
received from the customer. For instance, if a sales representative gen­
erated $100,000 in sales in April and earns a 5 percent commission on all 
sales, the commission of $5,000 would be recognized as an expense in 
April by accruing the obligation due. However, if the customer doesn’t 
pay until June, then the commission of $5,000 isn’t paid until June as 
well (to match the cash receipt with the payment of the commission). 
This strategy can be further leveraged to improve cash flows by imple­
menting a policy such as paying all commissions on the 10th day of the 
month following customer payment. So if the customer doesn’t pay until 
June, the commission could actually be delayed until July 10.
	
	Structuring a commission plan that remits commissions when the 
customer pays encourages the sales representatives to stay actively 
engaged with the customer to ensure that payments are received 
(because if the customer doesn’t get paid, the sales representative 
doesn’t either).
	
✓	Bonuses: Bonus plans are generally tied to specific business goals and 
objectives established for a company’s operating performance overall 
(as opposed to a commission paid on sales). To maximize cash flows, 
the ideal scenario is to pay bonuses during a period of the year when 
cash balances are usually higher (for example, 90 days after the com­
pany’s primary selling season so that sales can turn into cash from cus­
tomer payments) and/or to pay the bonuses after the operating period 
on which the bonus is based has been properly evaluated (to ensure 
that an accurate bonus is calculated and paid).

Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
	
All compensation plans that include bonuses, commissions, and/or other simi­
lar types of payouts should be properly structured and approved by either an 
internal human resources department or by external professional counsel. 
The last thing any business needs is to run afoul of state or federal laws per­
taining to employee compensation.
Connecting compensation to performance
It should go without saying that all compensation plans need to be structured 
with a clear correlation between objectives and rewards. A perfect example 
of this link is the classic sales compensation and commission plan whereby 
a sales representative earns 5 percent of all sales generated up to $1,000,000 
and then 6 percent on all sales above $1,000,000. The company’s objective 
is to drive sales, and the reward is a higher commission for the sales repre­
sentative. But this type of simple compensation structure has gotten more 
than a few businesses in trouble because although sales were being driven, 
the company forgot to ask whether the sales were profitable and collections 
were being received.
A more relevant and worthwhile sales representative compensation and 
commission plan expands on the above base program by adding the following 
features:
	
✓	All sales commissions are paid when cash is received, for cash received 
within 90 days of the invoice date. Commission payment is then 
matched with the actual receipt of cash and also ensures that custom­
ers pay within a timely manner (by keeping the sales representative 
engaged).
	
✓	The base minimum gross margin required on all sales is 20 percent. For 
sales that generate a gross margin of less than 20 percent, no commis­
sion is earned (unless approved by management). The goal with this 
requirement is to keep the sales representative focused on selling profit­
able goods or services and avoiding the trap of “buying” sales by offer­
ing deep discounts or special deals.
	
This sales commission example is very basic and is offered merely to highlight 
the types of compensation plan features and structuring options that can be 
utilized to achieve desired results (which for a business is generating profits 
and for an employee is earning fair and reasonable compensation). The key 
issue is that compensation plans need to be properly aligned with business 
operating objectives to produce the desired results.
The sales compensation and commission plan example provided is based 
on a top-line approach, which looks at the top line of the income statement 
(which is first revenue or sales) and then the next critical line of gross profit. 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
327
 Chapter 15: Managing the Disbursement Cycle to Improve Cash Flows
The top line — in this case, net revenue — can be used as the basis to calcu­
late a commission for an individual sales representative that produced $2 mil­
lion in sales and earns a 5 percent commission, or $100,000. The top line can 
also be used to calculate a bonus for the sales and marketing team, such as 
paying a bonus of 3 percent if the company’s top line exceeds $10 million for 
the year (thus providing $300,000 to be split between the team in the form of 
a bonus). Top-line compensation programs represent only a portion of most 
businesses’ employee compensation because in addition to top-line commis­
sions, bottom-line bonuses — that focus on the last lines of the income state­
ment, which are typically net profits — are also widely used by businesses.
The same logic applied to structuring commission programs also applies to 
structuring bonus programs, as a clear correlation between the reward being 
offered and the desired business objective needs to be developed. In addi­
tion, identifying what method will be used to measure the bottom line should 
be incorporated into the bonus program (for the benefit of all parties). One 
of the most common methods employed is to simply structure the financial 
measurements based on GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles). 
It’s both reliable and independent.
	
Don’t be consumed with structuring bonus programs strictly on the income 
statement alone. For senior management, keeping the business on sound 
financial footing with a solid balance sheet and strong cash flows is just as 
important as generating high profit levels. The higher the level of senior 
management, the more broad-based the objectives should be, factoring in 
data from all financial statements, including both quantitative and qualitative 
targets. Remember, one of senior management’s primary responsibilities is to 
think strategically, which usually involves developing and implementing long-
term business plans. So senior management should be incentivized appro­
priately for achieving critical objectives that don’t necessarily contribute to 
current-year profits but lay the foundation for higher profits three years down 
the road.
Utilizing noncash forms of equity 
compensation for employees
A number of noncash forms of compensation are available for use by employ­
ers that can supplement the employee’s earning potential over the long run. 
One of the most widely used forms of a noncash-compensation program is 
an incentive stock-option plan. Diving into the details of stock-option plans 
is well beyond the scope of this book, but the general idea is to provide 
employees with a grant of stock options (which represent equity ownership 
in the company) that they can earn or vest over a period of time.

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
328
Part IV: Managing Your Business with Cash Flow in Mind 
Start-up companies often use stock-option plans for a number of reasons, 
including to attract high-quality employees. Because the start-up company 
doesn’t have the resources to match cash-compensation programs of larger 
businesses, they sweeten the pot with offers of equity. Start-ups may also use 
stock-option plans as a means to conserve cash (trading cash compensation 
for potential equity appreciation at a later date) and to make sure that the 
employee stays committed to the company for an extended period (as the 
stock-option grant is earned over a period of, say, three to five years). For 
employees, the trade-off is usually straightforward in that lower near-term 
compensation is earned with the hope that the start-up becomes the next 
Google and stockholders will exit with millions.
	
If your company is considering implementing an incentive stock-option plan, 
obtain proper legal counsel to ensure that it’s structured and managed cor­
rectly. The technicalities with these types of plans are significant and best left 
to the experts.
Another type of noncash equity compensation is often referred to as phantom 
equity. Under these plans, an employee is provided upside earnings poten­
tial upon a future event being achieved (and is compensated at that time). 
For example, a key employee may be provided a phantom-equity incentive 
of 2 percent of the company’s value when it is sold. The advantage to the 
business owners is that they don’t actually have to give up any equity (thus 
having another shareowner with voting and other rights to account for). The 
advantage to the employee is that she has an incentive plan with significant 
upside when the event is realized (although some tax disadvantages are 
present). The variety of colors and flavors with phantom-equity plans are 
extensive, but they all provide the employee with significant earnings poten­
tial upside (like an incentive stock-option plan) but without actually issuing 
equity. Withholding equity may be particularly favorable for businesses that 
are family owned, tightly controlled, structured as subchapter S corpora­
tions, and/or have other ownership structures that limit the ability to 
issue equity.
	
Providing equity in lieu of cash compensation can be expensive. Companies 
need to understand that although cash can be conserved, giving up equity 
represents a real cost of conducting business. The trade-offs of giving up own­
ership interests in exchange for securing the employee need to be carefully 
evaluated.
Checking out other benefit 
strategies and ideas
Finally, a couple of other employee-compensation strategies may be relevant 
in terms of improving cash flows, controlling expenses, and reducing the risk 
of fraud.

✓	Use it or lose it vacation policies: Encouraging all employees to use 
accrued vacation within a certain time period or lose it can help 
improve cash flow by limiting the potential of having to actually pay 
accrued vacation balances if the employee leaves. The idea is to avoid 
building up multiple years of accrued vacation by strongly encourag­
ing employees to take vacation (thus reducing outstanding balances). 
In addition, having employees take vacation achieves a significant 
internal control by providing an opportunity to have another indepen­
dent employee cover the workload of the employee on vacation. This 
employee brings a fresh set of eyes to the job, which can uncover fraud, 
waste, and/or other inefficiencies.
	
✓	Employee allowances versus expense reports: Employers for years 
have used allowances as an additional form of employee compensa­
tion to cover directly incurred expenses for such items as mileage, 
auto, travel, phones, and so on. Although relatively easy to administer, 
using allowances also creates problems for the employee and employer 
alike. Employees are generally required to report allowances as earned 
income on their tax returns, because the IRS tends to view allowances 
as additional compensation. For the employer, allowances tend to be 
paid at the same time as payroll (thus accelerated) and may be inflating 
expenses (because employees may be taking advantage of the allowance 
if their actual direct costs are much lower).
	
	To manage this issue, requiring employees to prepare and submit 
expense reports not only keeps the employee honest with expenses 
but also can buy the employer a little time in remitting payment (for 
instance, employees must submit expense reports within 10 days after 
the month end and will be paid on the 25th of the following month). 
Furthermore, direct reimbursements of employee expenses from an 
expense report is generally not considered additional income to the 
employee by the IRS.

f cash could talk, it might quote Tony Montana in the movie Scarface, who 
states, “I always tell the truth, even when I lie.” Even when the income 
statement and balance sheet are “lying” (that is, misrepresenting the facts), 
the cash-flow statement always tells the truth about the state of the busi­
ness’s cash. Simply put, the cash-flow statement is one of the best manage­
ment tools to help determine if your income statement and balance sheets 
are lying.
	
We’ve said it before, but it’s worth mentioning again here: In the black, but 
where’s the green? Translation: Just because your company generates a profit 
doesn’t mean it’s generating positive cash flow.
So with this relatively simple but extremely important concept in mind, this 
chapter provides you with ten tips for managing cash flow so your business 
always has enough cash available when opportunities occur or disasters 
strike. These tips have all been discussed in the book and range from the 
basics of understanding your financial statements to the importance of man­
aging your critical cash inflow and outflow cycles to working with the won­
derful world of financing sources, but they all circle back to Tony Montana’s 
quote. That is, if the cash-flow statement displays relatively poor cash flow 
but large profits, then chances are your business may have an issue (some 
asset or liability is consuming cash) to address in the balance sheet and 
income statement.

Respect and Understand 
Financial Statements
Small businesses are notorious for not maintaining proper accounting books 
and records. According to some surveys, 25 percent of businesses don’t 
even maintain accounting records (let alone produce financial statements), a 
number that still stuns us. And when financial statements are produced, most 
small businesses generally tend to focus on the income statement first and 
foremost. They may then take a crack at the balance sheet (sometimes with­
out a clue as to what it’s really saying), but most business managers leave the 
statement of cash flows for the bean counters to deal with.
The bottom line for small businesses is simple. If you don’t make an effort to 
prepare, review, and completely understand your financial statements, then 
you need to ask yourself why you’re in business in the first place. And this 
especially holds true for the statement of cash flows, because an abundance 
of invaluable information is available from this most commonly overlooked 
and mismanaged financial statement.
	
You know your mom was right when she constantly harped on you to always 
eat your fruits and vegetables. So if you must, think of all the financial state­
ments as fruits and vegetables. Although you may not want to eat them, in the 
end, you will be stronger and extremely thankful you did. You can get started 
understanding all three important financial documents in Chapter 3.
Plan, Do Projections, 
and Plan Some More
Proper planning is essential to the launch, growth, management, and ultimate 
success of your business as measured by the ability to generate profits and, 
just as important, to avoid running out of cash. Dedicating resources to this 
all-important function cannot be underestimated in today’s rapidly changing 
and complex marketplace. Having access to sound financial plans structured 
for different operating scenarios is an absolute must.
During the planning process, keep in mind these two critical elements:

✓	Financial planning starts with identifying, obtaining, and evaluat­
ing reliable business, operational, and market data and information 
(both from internal and external sources). Yes, you may be surprised 
that the authors of this book (both being accountants) acknowledge the 
importance of accumulating nonfinancial and accounting data first, but 
we’re not dealing with “the chicken or the egg” riddle — data must come 
before any financial forecasts or projections can be completed. Reliable 
internal and external data and information are the basis of any sound 
business plan and forecast.
Chapters 8 and 9 walk you through the background work necessary for plan­
ning, help you create a viable business plan, and provide the basis for building 
best in class projection models.
Focus on Capital and Cash: The 
Lifeblood of Any Business
You must secure the proper amount, type, and structure of capital to provide 
your business with the necessary financial resources to execute the business 
plan. One of the most common reasons small businesses fail is that they lack 
adequate cash or capital, not only to survive difficult times, but also (and 
more important) to prosper during growth opportunities. Although having a 
war chest to tap during down times is important, having the proper amount 
and type of capital available to support a rapid-growth period is even more 
critical, because although surviving is nice, most companies are in business 
to create wealth and value to the owners. Face it; in a capitalist economic 
system, wealth creation is of paramount importance, and wealth is created 
most often by not treading water and staying afloat but by riding the mon­
ster wave when it arrives. So be prepared. Raising capital has been and will 
continue to be one of the most critical and time-consuming tasks business 
owners and managers ever undertake, and its importance should never be 
underestimated.
	
Remember, one of the greatest losses a small business can realize is that of 
lost opportunity, which has its roots in not being prepared to properly capital­
ize on market opportunities. The harsh reality is that this great loss is never 
accounted for or presented in any way, shape, or form on the business’s finan­
cial statements. Rather, missed market and business opportunities lurk in the 
background, haunting the business owner, manager, or entrepreneur with the 
torturous thought, “Imagine what I could have achieved!” Chapters 10 and 11 
can help you understand how to secure capital as needed so you won’t ever 
have to face this regret.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Understand Your Selling Cycle
From an accounting perspective, the selling cycle basically commences 
with the initiation of a sales order, which then turns into the issuance of an 
invoice, which, of course, eventually results in the receipt of payment. The 
accounting cycle, although relatively easy to define, is only one element 
of the entire selling cycle that starts with conducting proper planning and 
market research and doesn’t end until the customer’s needs are completely 
satisfied (to ensure the customer returns). The length of the complete sell­
ing cycle is often much longer than the aspiring entrepreneur projects and/
or wants to believe. And if not properly managed, the selling cycle generally 
becomes one of the largest consumers of cash in a business (as sales goals 
and objectives are not met, capital is depleted more rapidly than forecasted, 
and management’s creditability is impaired). Without fail, almost every aspir­
ing business owner, at one point or another, will experience delays in the 
selling cycle.
	
The selling cycle involves more than selling a product or service and collect­
ing the cash. Rather, the selling cycle in its entirety spans the time from the 
very start of the process when a product or service is first visualized and 
developed (that customers may actually purchase) to supporting customers 
after the sale and developing additional products or services that may be in 
demand (thus completing the circle). The lesson learned from understanding 
the complete selling cycle can and should also be applied to almost any busi­
ness function, from raising capital to securing management to developing new 
products. Make sure you apply the concept of the selling cycle to every aspect 
of your business to ensure that you develop proper plans and secure capital 
resources to handle the inevitable bumps in the road that will come. Chapter 
14 can help you on your way.
Manage Your Disbursements Cycle
The selling cycle is generally the largest consumer of cash for most busi­
nesses. To counteract this cash consumption machine, businesses need to 
understand that the disbursement cycle (managing expenditures and cash 
payments to vendors, employees, and other creditors) can be leveraged 
and managed to be a primary source of cash for your business. You may be 
thinking, “What, have the authors lost it? Everyone knows that sales produce 
cash and disbursements consume cash!” Well, at the end of each of these 
cycles, your objection is absolutely correct, but in 90 percent of the activity 
and transactions that occur prior to the end of each cycle, you can manage 
things to alter how cash is consumed and generated. Chapters 14 and 15 
offer detailed tips on how to improve cash flows, ranging from structuring

 Chapter 16: Ten Keys to Managing Cash Flows in a Small Business
customer payment terms to entice customers to pay quicker to developing 
relationships with vendors and understanding how much time you can really 
buy before you have to pay outstanding invoices, to approaching financing 
sources on how to squeeze more money from lending agreements.
	
When at all possible, invoke one of the most important accrual-based account­
ing principles — the matching principle. That is, similar to properly matching 
revenue and expenses to ensure that an accurate measurement of a business’s 
profit or loss is obtained, you should be able to match cash inflows and out­
flows. This effective management tool is used in a wide range of environments 
and is best understood by taking a closer look at paying sales commissions. 
Generally, sales representatives earn commissions when sales occur. If the 
commission is paid in the same month the sale is recorded (regardless of if 
the customer has paid), then cash outflows may be accelerated. However, 
if the commission is paid when the customer pays, the cash inflow from the 
customer is matched with the cash outflow to the sales representative.
Be Creative to Generate Cash
Small businesses must continually (and quickly) innovate, create, adapt, and 
adjust to have a chance at competing against the corporate behemoths that 
dominate so many markets. Deep pockets are a luxury that most small busi­
nesses generally don’t have, as sitting on mounds of cash is a problem that 
most companies would love to have but few will ever experience. To stay 
afloat, small businesses should apply to accounting the same business cre­
ativity they use when developing new products or services, figuring out how 
to reach customers more efficiently, or structuring employee compensation 
plans to retain the best talent available.
The following three areas offer significant opportunities for creativity when 
looking to improve cash flows:
	
✓	Turn your assets over quicker. Assets consume cash. The quicker 
you can turn over assets, the quicker they turn into cash. It’s as simple 
as that.
	
✓	Leverage your vendors, suppliers, and financing sources. These busi­
nesses are your vendors, but, more important, you are their customer. 
They don’t want to lose your business, so placing just the right amount 
of leverage on these groups can result in enhanced cash flows because 
liabilities offer a source of cash. Looking at it from another perspective, 
if a vendor offers your company 30-day payment terms that you can 
stretch into 45 days, in effect, you have 15 extra days to remit payment 
(and thus keep cash with your company longer).

Part V: The Part of Tens 
	
✓	Manage external sources of cash proactively. You can proactively 
manage your relationships with banks, leasing companies, and even the 
federal government to ensure that cash is made available when needed. 
If you give an inch with these groups, they most likely will take a mile, so 
be sure your business takes the lead with managing these types of exter­
nal parties.
Balance the Balance Sheet
Many businesses overlook the concept of properly managing the financial 
structure of their balance sheet, which has gotten more than a few busi­
nesses in trouble. Your business needs to strike a proper balance between 
making sure that current assets (on the left side of the balances sheet) are 
financed or supported with current liabilities (on the right side of the balance 
sheet) and making sure that long-term assets are financed (again, on the left 
side of the balance sheet) or supported with long-term sources of capital 
(such as a five-year note payable or equity). Every business should strive to 
achieve a financial condition that ensures constant maintenance of adequate 
levels of both solvency (the ability to pay all just debts) and liquidity (the 
ability to quickly access cash to support business operations).
	
For a case study on how to fail at financing, look no farther than the federal 
government. The problem is not only that the federal government is running 
enormous deficits that it’s funding with debt, but also that the composition of 
the debt in relation to the federal government’s expenditures is out of balance 
(and problematic). The federal government is currently utilizing more and 
more short-term treasury bills (30, 90, or 180 days until maturity) to finance 
long-term structural expenditures (such as the military). Although implement­
ing this strategy helps reduce interest expense (because the interest rates on 
short-term debt are less than 1 percent compared to ten-year rates of closer to 
3 percent), this type of imbalance increases potential financing risks down the 
road: If short-term rates rise or market conditions change dramatically (and 
selling the debt becomes more difficult), access to cash to fund ongoing gov­
ernment operations may become a very big problem, very quickly.
Understand External Capital Markets
Business owners love to quote two old sayings when it comes to banks: 
Banks always have money available to lend when you don’t need it, and 
banks love to say yes, yes, yes, yes — and then, when it’s time to make the 
commitment, no! To be fair, these statements also apply to basically all types 
of external sources of capital, ranging from investors to alternative lending 
sources. The following key concepts help you understand how to prepare for 
and deal with external sources of cash or capital:

339
 Chapter 16: Ten Keys to Managing Cash Flows in a Small Business
	
✓	Think well ahead. In today’s economic climate, it takes a long time to 
identify external sources of capital (because fewer choices are avail­
able) and to secure them (because the review or underwriting process 
is very stringent, not to mention that more businesses are competing for 
capital). So plan well ahead to make sure that you’ll have cash available 
when needed, because it’s not a process you can rush.
	
✓	Think expensive. For the biggest companies, like Apple and McDonald’s, 
money is still cheap (in fact, extremely cheap). For the balance of the 
business community, money is expensive (often very expensive). Being 
realistic on how expensive money is and what source is most appropri­
ate for your business should be understood from the beginning so that 
you can avoid sticker shock and properly plan for financing related 
costs (making sure that your projections are as accurate as possible and 
that cash will be available to meet loan obligations).
	
✓	Think colonoscopy. Examinations, reviews, audits, evaluations, due 
­diligence — however you refer to it, the bottom line is that when you 
pursue external capital, the process undertaken to verify your business’s 
information is going to be very detailed, broad, time consuming, and 
lengthy. So if you’re not properly prepared for the underwriting process, 
then don’t bother, because the end result will be easily predictable.
	
Also think internal by scrubbing the balance sheet to find hidden cash and 
sources of capital. When appropriate, external sources of capital should be 
pursued to secure cash to finance a business (and we discuss these sources 
and scenarios in Chapters 10 and 11). But businesses need to remember that 
countless internal sources of cash may be available to support the operation 
and maybe, just maybe, alleviate the need for loans or outside investments.
Protect Cash at All Times
Cash represents an asset just like trade accounts receivables, inventory, 
and equipment, and like those assets it must be controlled, managed, and 
protected at all times. However, cash has a very unique characteristic unlike 
these other assets that makes it highly susceptible to additional risk of loss: 
Cash is an extremely liquid and marketable asset.
Most assets require a series of transactions or steps in order to be converted 
into cash. Sometimes those steps can protect businesses from fraud. For 
example, if theft occurs with inventory, it first must be taken from the busi­
ness and then converted into cash from some type of fraudulent transac­
tion. Furthermore, the party purchasing the inventory usually knows that 
the transaction isn’t legitimate and will deeply discount their purchase to 
account for increased risk. So inventory that may sell for $100 in a store and 
has a cost of $50 may actually only sell for $20 in this type of environment. 
Needless to say, $20 isn’t much of an incentive to steal the item. The problem

340
Part V: The Part of Tens 
with cash, however, is that it doesn’t require a conversion transaction, and 
when it’s stolen, it retains its face value.
So the basic rule of thumb for all assets (and particularly cash) is that with 
a higher level of convertibility and net-realizable face value, the higher the 
level of controls, policies, procedures, and management attention that needs 
to be applied.
	
Advances in the digital or Internet age have had significant influences on 
the management of cash, both positive and negative. Although improving 
business efficiencies and lowering the risk of handling actual cash receipts 
(including checks), they have also opened the door to an entirely new type of 
electronic fraud and theft. Utilizing technology to manage cash receipts and 
disbursements is definitely the wave of the future, but it should be accom­
panied by the appropriate accounting policies, procedures, and controls to 
manage the increased risks.
Always Think of CART
If you remember one acronym from this book, remember CART — complete, 
accurate, reliable, and timely. Your company’s financial and accounting infor­
mation system needs to produce complete, accurate, reliable, and timely 
financial information, reports, data, and so on, which management can use 
to make informed business decisions. Without CART, a business cannot 
function properly, nor can it make informed and timely business decisions. 
Furthermore, CART is essential to improving cash flows because a direct cor­
relation links improved CART and improved cash flows.
	
Without producing CART invoices for your customers, payments will be 
delayed. Without having CART financial statements or reports, your chances 
of securing a loan from a bank will be significantly impaired. And without pro­
viding CART data to shareowners or the board of directors, you can kiss your 
job goodbye (and your ability to generate positive cash flow).

Ten Tales of Cash-Flow Woes
In This Chapter
▶	Consuming cash in underperforming assets
▶	Utilizing loans, debt, and liabilities incorrectly
▶	Being caught off guard by changing market conditions
▶	Making management mishaps, mistakes, and mayhem
T

ime and time again, business gurus write articles and reports on the 
most common reasons small businesses fail. At the top of the list, you 
almost always find the issue of undercapitalization, or lack of enough cash to 
support the operating strategy. This chapter provides ten other tales of how 
companies got into to severe cash-flow crunches by not attending to critical 
accounting, financial, and operational issues properly.
	
An underlying trend with almost every cash-flow woe is poor management. 
Yes, the economy crashed, but management in many cases was not prepared. 
Yes, market conditions changed, but management often didn’t understand the 
competitive forces to begin with. The point is that just as poor management 
can make a difficult situation even worse, solid management can help offset 
the damage of a number of cash-flow sins.
Misunderstanding Trade 
Account Receivables
The number of cash-flow woes that can be attributed to mismanaging trade 
accounts receivable are endless. One specific, extremely problematic issue 
we’ve encountered over the years is centered in what a business considers 
a legitimate trade receivable, because financing sources don’t lend against 
receivables with certain characteristics. Examples of problem receivables 
include federal government sales, foreign sales, related/affiliated party sales, 
concentrated sales, receivables subject to future discounts/adjustments, and 
others. (See Chapters 11 and 14 for further information on why these types of 
receivables present lending problems.) These receivables may be completely

Part V: The Part of Tens 
legitimate and eventually be collected, but from a financing source’s perspec­
tive, they’re too risky to lend against. The following examples demonstrate 
how businesses can go wrong with accounts receivable:
	
✓	A professional service firm was pursuing a large contract that it felt 
assured of receiving. Although it hadn’t obtained a signed contract, it 
established billing jobs and codes to capture the initial work and invoice 
the customer. When the contract fell through, the invoices became 
uncollectible, which resulted in the receivables being written off and the 
company taking a loss. Furthermore, when the receivable dropped from 
the borrowing facility (that is, the receivable extended past 90 days from 
the original due date before it was written off, which made the receiv­
able no longer eligible to borrow against), access to available cash was 
reduced because the company couldn’t use this receivable as collateral 
to borrow against.
	
✓	A medical device distribution company sold various medical equipment 
and supplies to customers throughout the country. The company’s stan­
dard practice was to match any competitor price if pressured by cus­
tomers. An audit of the business determined that the average discount 
offered and subsequent billing adjustment was 20 percent. Prior to the 
audit, the financing source had been lending at a rate of 80 percent 
against eligible receivables. Subsequent to the audit, the lending rate 
was reduced to 65 percent as a result of the high billing discounts and 
adjustments provided to the customers. In order to remain in compli­
ance with the lending facility, the company had to pay down the line of 
credit, which reduced cash levels very quickly.
	
Always obtain a true understanding of the real value of your trade receivables 
by making sure that proper reserves are established for potential bad debts, 
product returns, and/or other billing adjustments. Establish proper reserves 
in a prudent and objective manner based on analyzing reliable sales and 
trade receivables data, reports, and information to calculate correct reserve 
amounts. Don’t trick yourself into believing that 100 percent of all customer 
invoices will eventually be received — we have yet to see a business achieve 
this objective.
Letting Good Inventory Go Bad
The reality of the economy is that industries and markets can move so fast 
that today’s highly successful products can quickly become obsolete in less 
than six months. Just ask anyone operating in the consumer electronics busi­
ness, such as Apple, Sony, or RIMM, because without a constant product-
development and market-introduction strategy, these companies can move 
from Hero to Zero in the blink of an eye.

 Chapter 17: Ten Tales of Cash-Flow Woes
Of course, the consumer electronics market isn’t the only industry that can 
suffer from inventory obsolescence issues. The distribution company in the 
following example learned that lesson quickly.
	
A distributor of both domestic and imported picture and mirror framing and 
molding products had operated a successful business for over 25 years. The 
company amassed a large inventory of specialty and unique products sold 
primarily to niche framing and molding retail shops located throughout the 
country. Unfortunately, two events occurred that quickly turned good inven­
tory into worthless wood:
	
✓	First, the company never properly evaluated and managed specific 
inventory lines or items in relation to how quickly the products were 
turning over into sales. In some cases, the company had over a two-year 
supply of certain products.
	
✓	Second, the company’s customer market was dramatically reshaped over 
a ten-year period as the smaller niche retail stores it relied on for the 
majority of its revenue decreased from an estimated 40,000 shops to less 
than 15,000 due to competition by big box retailers (such as Michaels).
In the end, the company’s inventory problem created two cash problems: 
Cash was used to purchase inventory that was taking more than a year to 
sell, and having the excess inventory required storage, maintenance, and 
administrative support, which resulted in higher operating expenses. In this 
situation, for every $100 of inventory owned, these added costs amounted 
to 10 percent annually. And finally, to add insult to injury, the inventory’s 
value wasn’t even 50 percent of the original cost due to styles changing and 
storage-related damage.
One of the simplest ways to avoid these types of inventory-management 
problems is to generate frequent inventory performance reports by product 
line and SKU (or individual product) to determine how quickly products are 
selling, what gross margins are being generated, and other potential trending 
information. If management stays on top of these reports, inventory prob­
lems can quickly be identified with corrective action taken (such as simply 
reducing purchases of slow-moving items).
Improperly Investing in Soft Assets
When the term soft assets is used, it usually refers to some type of intellec­
tual property such as patents, trademarks, trade names, publications, trade 
secrets, and/or some other type of proprietary business asset that generates 
earnings (or cash flows). For example, the formula of Coca-Cola is one of the 
most valuable and highly guarded assets in the world, but yet no tangible 
or hard asset is present. However, soft assets can quickly turn into cash-
guzzling machines, as the following situation highlights.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
	
A sports nutrition company developed and sold a highly successful muscle-
building nutrient that produced strong revenues and profits (as well as cash 
flows). To leverage this success, the company elected to develop and publish 
a bimonthly fitness magazine, which required significant cash investments 
upfront to produce all the content needed for the magazine (as well as to pub­
lish the initial edition of tens of thousands of copies). A cash problem arose 
before one dollar of cash was actually received from subscription or rack 
sales, and a total of only four editions were produced and published. The 
problem was that the parties handling both the subscription and rack sales 
used magazine sales remittance strategies (customary in the industry) that 
stretched the end customer sales (the point at which a consumer would pur­
chase a magazine from a retailer such as a grocery store) out roughly eight 
months. If the consumer purchased the magazine for $5 in March, the com­
pany didn’t receive actual payment for their share until November. To com­
pound this problem, in an attempt to keep from overloading readers with 
endless amounts of advertising, the fitness magazine didn’t secure advertising 
revenue from third parties in the original editions.
Needless to say, the company’s mismanagement of both the receivables cycle 
and advertising potential in the magazine quickly changed (via watching cash 
levels quickly fall) after this painful cash lesson was learned.
	
Soft assets can have a double-negative impact on cash. First, an investment 
in the soft asset needs to be made (which consumes cash). And second, cash 
receipts driven from soft-asset-generated sales can often take much longer to 
materialize than a more traditional manufacturing or service-based business.
Falling into the Taxable Income Trap
The number of potential problems and pitfalls with taxes are so exten­
sive that providing a complete discussion would warrant an entire book. 
However, one tax trap has created grief more than a few times. The distri­
bution of taxable income from flow-through entities (that is, subchapter S 
corporations, limited liability companies, and partnerships) has a negative 
impact on personal income tax obligations all too often.
	
A manufacturing company aggressively used tax incentives, including accel­
erated depreciation on equipment purchases and the cash method, when 
reporting taxable income for a number of years. During these years, book 
income was positive but taxable income was neutral to negative. Cash bal­
ances built during these years were subsequently distributed to the owners 
who, in turn, used the majority of the cash for personal expenditures. 
Eventually, the business’s reportable sizable taxable earnings as accelerated 
depreciation deductions were eliminated and the benefit of the cash method 
of reporting flattened out. When the business reported the taxable income, 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
345
 Chapter 17: Ten Tales of Cash-Flow Woes
which flowed through to the owners, the owners had not set aside the appro­
priate amount of cash from the earlier years to cover the tax liabilities. To pay 
the bill, they tapped the business for cash, which produced two negative side 
effects. First, cash the business needed to reinvest and support growth was 
not available. Second, when the cash was distributed to the owners, it had the 
effect of reducing the business’s net equity, triggering a subsequent increase 
in its debt-to-equity ratio (because debt remained constant but equity 
decreased), creating a covenant default with a bank loan.
	
Entities that are legally structured to allow taxable income to flow through to 
owners don’t report income tax expense and aren’t obligated to report income 
tax obligations. Rather, these responsibilities fall on the owners of the busi­
ness. Business managers and owners must always have a clear understanding 
of any potential income tax obligations that are outstanding and take care to 
reserve the appropriate amount of cash for these obligations (at either the 
company or individual level). Remember, most tax rules and regulations are 
structured to enable a company to defer income taxes, not eliminate or avoid 
income taxes, so eventually cash will be required.
	
Given the complexity of tax issues that most business have to operate under 
(at the federal, state, and local levels), securing professional tax assistance is 
essential to avoid getting some nasty surprises down the road. The tax envi­
ronment is only going to get worse and more complicated as every govern­
ment entity expands its search for tax revenue, so staying on top of tax issues 
early and complying with all rules and regulations should be a top priority.
Misapplying Available 
Debt-Based Capital
The best way to highlight how misapplying available debt-based capital can 
wreak havoc on a business’s available cash is with the following two rather 
simple but devastating real-world examples:
	
✓	A wholesale food producer secured a working capital line of credit to 
support anticipated receivables growth from recently acquired large 
customers. The line of credit was designed to be used to purchase raw 
materials and finance increases in trade receivables. The company 
elected to draw on the line of credit to invest in property leasehold 
improvements and repay some old debt. Unfortunately, when the 
growth opportunity arrived, the company had used its remaining cash 
and available borrowing capacity on the line of credit and didn’t have 
any liquidity left to purchase raw materials and support new orders. 
Needless to say, the discussion between the bank and the company was 
very lively, and the management team immediately lost credibility with 
the bank. So the wholesale food producer missed out on a wonderful 
growth opportunity.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
	
✓	Company X was profitable, with strong earnings and a solid balance 
sheet. The founders of Company X then became part owners in a new 
business operation that required periodic cash infusions to support its 
launch and subsequent growth. Company X advanced or loaned cash 
to the new company, which used the money for general operating pur­
poses. As you may have guessed, Company X then found itself in need of 
the cash to cover various obligations, but the new business was unable 
to repay (because it was sunk in start-up costs and other illiquid assets). 
Not much longer after this, the ownership of the companies changed 
dramatically as trust between the owners disintegrated.
	
Just because cash is available doesn’t mean that your company has a green 
light to spend it, loan it, distribute it, or use it in another capacity. Exercise 
extreme caution and care with excess cash because it has a tendency to disap­
pear very quickly.
Failing to Prepare for the 
Economic Hard Landing
We doubt that many businesses want to revisit the problems created cour­
tesy of the Great Recession (from late 2007 through early 2010). In fact, most 
companies would just as soon block this time period from memory, given 
the severity of the economic contraction. But a number of invaluable lessons 
were learned during this period that relate to managing cash and liquidity. 
Following are two of these critical items:
	
✓	Companies that didn’t maintain a strong balance sheet with ample 
liquidity quickly became casualties. The combination of both the 
speed and depth of the economic contraction caught a number of busi­
nesses off guard. As for speed, businesses witnessed sales evaporate in 
a matter of months, not years. The depth of the economic contraction 
also stunned businesses, as expected 10 to 15 percent revenue reduc­
tions experienced over a 12- to 18-month period (in a normal recession) 
were replaced by 30-plus percent sales decreases experienced over a 6- 
to 12-month period. The bottom line is that businesses simply couldn’t 
adjust and adapt their economic operating models fast enough, which 
resulted in significant negative operating losses (translating into large 
cash losses as well).
	
✓	Companies without multiple operating plans to cover potential 
disaster scenarios had to scramble quickly and redeploy business 
resources just to survive. Business managers and owners tend to 
become very complacent when economic times are more robust. Added 
bonuses are paid, questionable asset investments are made (based on 
assuming that growth will continue), cash that may in fact be needed 
down the road is used to repay debt, and so on. But economic “hard

347
 Chapter 17: Ten Tales of Cash-Flow Woes
landings” can quickly underscore how important it is to have multiple 
operating plans and forecasts available to support timely business deci­
sion making. Companies learned that they should have multiple operat­
ing plans/projection models ready to go in the event that rapid and rash 
decisions have to be made. Simply having the “expected” operating case 
to work with was not nearly adequate, because what most companies 
needed was access to a “disaster” plan in order to properly evaluate and 
implement the choices available.
As we write this book, Corporate America (that is, the Fortune 500) sits on 
over $2 trillion of cash with record earnings being reported over the past 
year. Hardly the type of statistics you’d expect coming out of what’s con­
sidered the second-worst economic contraction America has experienced, 
but representative of how financially strong these companies are and how 
well they plan. Or as Warren Buffett stated, “When the tide goes out, we’ll 
see who’s left standing naked on the beach.” For businesses that were fully 
clothed (having solid plans and being well prepared with strong balance 
sheets and high liquidity), when the tide went out, the pain was far less 
severe and recoveries were very robust. And the market quickly disposed 
of businesses that found themselves wearing nothing but their birthday suit 
during this same period.
Getting Left in the Cold by Changing 
Market Conditions
The economy goes through natural periods of expansion and contraction, 
which can be very painful (as summarized in the preceding section). In addi­
tion, competitive forces throughout the economy are constantly reshaping 
industries, whether or not the overall economy is growing or contracting. 
During the Great Recession, most industries were contracting, yet pawn­
shops saw an increase in demand. And today, the technology industry is 
expanding by leaps and bounds, but certain niches within the industry are 
looking at the end. (For example, are DVD players even needed anymore?). 
The following example illustrates how even a very mature industry can be 
reshaped by competitive market forces.
	
A single-branded oil and gas distributer operated a family-owned business 
serving a secondary market (that is, not a major market in a metropolitan area 
such as Atlanta or Chicago but a smaller, rural market with a wider geographi­
cal reach). Over the years, a number of large oil and gas suppliers determined 
that supporting the secondary markets was far more efficient if the local 
distributors began carrying multiple brands to improve their operating effi­
ciency (such that delivery equipment could then be used at a 90-plus percent 
efficiency ratio). After this strategy was enacted, the multibranded local dis­
tributors then passed on lower costs to their retail customers, who could then

charge a lower price for gas and oil. This change placed significant competi­
tive pressure on retail customers supplied by the single-branded distributor 
and forced price decreases as well. In the end, the single-branded distributor’s 
operating performance moved from generating profits to producing losses, 
which drained the company’s cash reserves and ultimately forced its sale (at a 
deep discount).
Making Overly Optimistic 
Sales Forecasts
We harp on our concerns about the selling cycle throughout this book, and 
here we once again call out a way that this cycle can drain cash.
Back in the 1990s when the dot-com craze was in full swing, a number of com­
panies built business plans for delivering products or services through stand-
alone, electronic kiosks. To provide a frame of reference, these kiosks looked 
and operated somewhat like Redbox (which distributes DVDs) and Coinstar 
(which counts coins and exchanges them for cash or gift certificates) but 
suffered the following fatal flaws as a result of not understanding the selling 
cycle adequately:
	
✓	Unreliable kiosks: Every selling cycle needs to ensure not only that 
sales are made but also that the customer experience and the service 
provided guarantee repeat business. In this case, the kiosks proved to 
be unreliable, which turned customers off very quickly. Improvements 
were made, but by that time, customers were lost and the economic 
model no longer worked because management had underestimated the 
amount of repairs and maintenance needed to ensure properly operat­
ing kiosks.
	
✓	Unrealistic volume expectations: Even when the kiosks worked and 
were rolled out on time and customers purchased products, the miss 
in the selling cycle was on volume, because transactions took longer to 
process and customer participation rates were lower than anticipated. 
With a relatively high fixed operating cost, the kiosks could not generate 
enough profit to cover expenses and thus drained the company of its 
remaining cash.
	
✓	Inability to compete in technologies and pricing: Kiosks that were 
based on the distribution of information were quickly displaced by 
more-efficient and reliable competing technologies that generally pro­
vided a better product at a lower price.

 Chapter 17: Ten Tales of Cash-Flow Woes
	
Remember, the selling cycle can drain cash in countless ways, ranging from 
purchase timing to volumes to price to product/service reliability. 
Understanding all critical aspects of the selling cycle is essential to calculating 
just how much cash will be consumed.
Robbing Peter to Pay Paul
Small-business owners are by nature entrepreneurs and, generally, forever 
optimists. Their spirit is often best measured in the satisfaction they receive 
from providing a product or service of value to the market and not just based 
in the amount of money they make. Although this trait is admirable, it can also 
be a flaw because entrepreneurs often stop at nothing to see their ideas suc­
ceed and business survive for decades. Engaging in business and ensuring its 
ultimate survival, at any cost without looking at the big picture, is where the 
blacks and whites of running a business often turn gray and transaction legiti­
macy comes into question. Business owners often become some consumed in 
whether they can do something (which in this case means keeping the busi­
ness afloat by overstepping critical boundaries) that they forget to ask the 
more important question related to whether they should be doing this.
	
A manufacturing company experienced a sharp downturn in sales as a result 
of a number of confluencing factors. The company developed a turnaround 
plan but had run out of cash, so it began using partial, advance, and pre-billing 
strategies to process invoices before the products were actually shipped. 
Instead of waiting to access cash against the receivable when the complete 
shipment and sale occurred (30 days in the future), they robbed the future 
by accessing the cash today to pay current outstanding obligations. These 
invoices were provided to the manufacturing company’s financing source, 
which in turn advanced cash (assuming a valid receivable was present) to 
finance the company’s turnaround. The company initially intended to use this 
strategy as a stop-gap measure on a limited basis. In the end, the strategy was 
used much longer and more extensively than planned. Eventually, the prob­
lem was rectified, but the impact on cash (not to mention management cred­
ibility) was significant, because cash was repeatedly pulled forward and used 
for historical needs with nothing left to support future needs.
	
Business owners typically want to believe the best about their businesses, 
so although their intent is not to commit fraud, they often undertake small 
accounting “adjustments” to buy another week or month — a practice that 
can soon accumulate into a major problem. By robbing Peter (accelerating a 
sale set for the next month to the current month) to pay Paul (using the sale to 
meet a current target), all you do is make the next month’s targets even more 
challenging to achieve. And if this practice continues for a long period of time, 
eventually the weight of the problem implodes on the business. Forming strong 
boards of directors or advisory boards that actively participate in the business 
can help provide the proper insight and guidance to avoid falling into this trap.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Growing Yourself Out of Business
Companies that simply grow themselves out of business are a good example 
of the dangers of equating profits with cash flow. In one particular case, 
entrepreneurs launched an ecommerce-based retail business that specialized 
in selling consumer goods. The company was highly successful as measured 
by annual revenue growth, which in year one was less than $500,000 but 
exploded to over $12 million in five years. The primary problem this com­
pany faced was that the suppliers of the consumer goods generally required 
payments upon delivery (to secure the best pricing) for products that would 
be marketed over a period of 6 to 12 months (as a result of seasonality sales 
strategies). The company assumed that financing would be available from 
either primary or secondary lending sources (to support the growth), but 
given the nature of the product, the age of the company, and the status of the 
financial information, securing external financing proved to be a significant 
challenge.
This cash-flow tale of caution doesn’t end too badly: The company continued 
to operate profitability albeit at a much lower growth rate. But the cash-flow 
woe does highlight the importance of securing proper amounts and types of 
financing to support rapid-growth scenarios.
	
Rapidly growing industries or markets are going to attract the interest of 
numerous competitors. By not having a plan in place with the proper amount 
of capital or cash, companies leave the door open to bigger and stronger 
competitors that will take market share and may ultimately force smaller and 
weaker businesses out of the market.
