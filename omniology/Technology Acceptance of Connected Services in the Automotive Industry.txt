Foreword 
Connected Services constitute a very recent development in many industries and bridge 
service and product offerings. In the consumer business, one of the most prominent examples 
is “TeleServices” in the automotive industry: through a mobile data connection, diagnoses, 
maintenance, and also repair tasks can be performed on the vehicle while being on the road. 
Efficiency and security gains for both the driver and the manufacturer of the vehicle make 
such services a highly attractive development. Nevertheless, research and also practical 
experience on the acceptance and usage of such services is very limited, especially in the B2C 
area.  
The work of Clemens Hiraoka therefore contributes to the academic and managerial of 
technology-intensive services in at least three ways: First, the rich body of technology 
acceptance model (TAM) research is analyzed and consequently extended for its application 
on Connected Services in B2C. The theoretical framework is expanded to also include the 
role of traditional marketing elements such as branding and pricing. Second, this doctoral 
dissertation bases all quantitative analyses on a large sample of real customers, with both 
motivation and usage data combined. Although the risks associated with self-reported usage 
data (common method bias) are well known in research, very few authors are able to address 
it as Clemens Hiraoka does in his work, using both attitudinal and behavioral data. From 
there, structural equation modeling (SEM) is applied to uncover the relevant factors for 
accepting and using Connected Services. The dataset also allows comparing consumers over 
time, i.e. from being a potential customer to accepting and increasing the usage level to finally 
becoming a renewing or canceling customer. Likewise, usage behavior over time and its 
influence on retention is shown. The third contribution of this work lies in the holistic and 
extensive analysis on the new field of Connected Services, mainly based on the extensive 
explorative research. It scrutinizes the entire customer lifecycle and also uncovers the 
challenges and importance of customer touchpoints in the Marketing & Sales process – before 
the actual decision and acceptance process takes place.  
Overall, this work does not only provide an important contribution for the academic and 
managerial world. In the project setting with a major automotive OEM as a partner, Clemens 
Hiraoka has also shown the value – if not to say the necessity – of partnerships between both 
worlds for generating substantial results. This work clearly demonstrates this fruitful synthesis 
and should therefore be recommended to any academic fellow and practitioner interested in 
technology marketing and service management alike.

Preface 
It is now more than twenty years since Fred D. Davis, a doctoral candidate at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, published his thesis with a model to predict the 
acceptance of technology (Davis 1986). At that time, IT hardware and applications had 
moved slowly from isolated computing centers into the offices of white-collar workers of big 
corporations. The calculated benefits from efficiency gains were very promising, but very 
often companies had to realize that only fractions of the expected benefits of the computers 
were realized in daily business. Davis addressed the right questions at the right time – 
questions about what factors drive or hinder employees’ intention to leverage technologies at 
their work space. Two publications and three years later (Davis 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, and 
Warshaw 1989), the technology acceptance model (TAM) not only constituted a reference 
model in IS literature, but it established a new stream of research. The goal of this thesis is to 
add another contribution to a field of research that Davis began, and which continues despite 
the claims of numerous researchers that TAM has been fully developed and cannot be 
significantly enriched (Hirschheim 2007 and other articles in this MISQ special issue on 
TAM; Venkatesh et al. 2003). Substantial reasons support my conviction that more research 
on TAM is justified – indeed, is needed – and that I shall accomplish such research in the 
context of this dissertation project.  
I strongly believe that research and practice should always enrich and extend each other in 
fruitful ways. In my case, the thesis came into existence within a PhD program from a 
premium automotive OEM. Within this program, I worked concurrently on relevant 
Connected Services projects in daily business and on my research project. Therefore, the 
OEM not only stimulated research questions by representing a challenging field to work in, 
but also funded and supported this research project in a direct way. 
Obviously, my interaction with the OEM relied heavily on work with people who directly 
supported my efforts during this time. At the risk of diminishing the help of others, I wish to 
highlight three mentors who challenged me, but also encouraged me in the content of my 
project and on a personal level. I offer my gratitude to Lars Beulke, Dr. Andreas Heider, and 
Axel Möring. Furthermore, I want to thank Simon Euringer, Richard Jacobi, Monika Sippel, 
and Dr. Eckard Steinmeier for believing in me and my project. Likewise, I want to mention 
Dr. Beate Massmann at the corresponding telematics service provider. 
For giving me the time and emotional support necessary for this extended research, I sincerely 
thank my wife Barbara.

As well, two persons from the academic community contributed greatly to the genesis of this 
doctoral dissertation. Nancy Wünderlich was always responsive to my questions and served 
as an intellectual sparring partner in the context of the research project “ExFeD”. This thesis 
project would also not have been possible without the Federal Ministry of Education and 
Research (BMBF: Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung), which supported the 
project 
"ExFeD 
- 
Export 
ferngelenkter 
Dienstleistungen" 
(FKZ 
01HQ0553; 
http://www.exfed.de, see also (Schumann 2008)). Professor Florian von Wangenheim has 
been not only an inspiring and encouraging doctoral advisor, but was an easily approachable 
and insightful mentor throughout the process.  
I gratefully acknowledge and will long appreciate the efforts of these persons to assist me 
with this work.

Disclaimer 
The author of this dissertation acknowledges every intention to diminish any socially 
discriminating language. Nevertheless, ease of readability was of high priority in this work. 
Hence, pronouns follow the previously conventional practice of using male terms for 
universal conditions (e.g., the consumer searches for products satisfying his demands).  
For confidentiality issues, some of the absolute numbers have been transformed to index 
figures. Such transformations are mentioned again in the relevant sections. Due to the still 
very limited number of players in the market, otherwise common approaches of sanitizing the 
real identity of the company were not possible in this case. On the other hand, revealing the 
identity allows very specific description of the context which – hopefully – makes the thesis 
pmore understandable and interesting to read.

1.1 
“TAM Reloaded” or why it becomes ever more important 
“Any customer can have a car painted any colour that he wants so long as it is black.” 
Remark of Henry Ford about the Model T in 1909, published in his autobiography My Life 
and Work (1922), Chapter IV 
At the beginning of research on technology acceptance two decades ago, the degree of 
technology in our daily lives was quite limited: consumer electronics had just begun to get 
digitalized with the introduction of the Compact Disc in 1982, one year later Motorola 
introduced the first commercial “mobile” phone model “DynaTAC” at a weight of 0.8 
kilogram and a dimension of 33x5x9 centimeters, and the Internet in the form of the World 
Wide Web was not even developed.  
From that time to the present, two major trends have emerged for consumers and businesses, 
and need to be reflected when discussing technology acceptance: on the one hand, we see an 
increasing level of (digital) “technification,” and on the other hand, we recognize that the shift 
from the primary and secondary sectors to the tertiary, service sector is still developing. Both 
trends are visible and valid for most industries, but in the automotive sector they are 
especially relevant and will become even more important in the future. The following three 
examples 
clearly 
demonstrate 
this 
development: 
the 
German 
research 
institute 
“Kraftfahrtwesen und Fahrzeugmotoren Stuttgart” predicts that electric and electronic features 
already account for 30% of the value creation of a middle class vehicle and will deliver 90% 
of the future automotive innovations (Grimm 2007). Furthermore, the share of system 
innovations (i.e., innovations based on connected technologies and features) will rise 
compared to individual, singular innovations (Wyman 2007). To make these quite abstract 
figures more concrete, consider the number of available options increasing from 14 on a 1986 
BMW 7 series to 92 options in the 2006 model (Wyman 2007) or the current VW Phaeton 
with 45 control units connected through 3.860 meters of cable at a weight of 64 kilograms 
(Grell 2003).  
With regard to the sectors of the economy, industrialized countries today generate most of 
their gross domestic product from the service sector, e.g., reaching almost 70% in Germany 
2007 (BMWI 2008). In this economic reality, companies in various industries are extending 
their value chain from hardware production into adjacent services. Examples in the B2B 
sector can be found in the IT industry, where IBM – historically starting as a typewriter 
producer – nowadays generates 55% of its turnover from the services business unit (IBM 

 1 Introduction to Connected Services 
2 
Annual Report 2007, page 23), or in the energy sector, where wind energy producers move 
into the maintenance and repair business, even for windmills of other brands. In the B2C 
sector, the automotive industry is once more a good case in point. At the very beginning, 
original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) only focused on the sales of their vehicles, and 
customers were welcome again only if they intended to buy a new one (see also the quote on 
customer orientation from 1909 at the beginning of this chapter). This has obviously changed 
very much, and today 60% of revenues and 80% of profit of a vehicle over lifetime originate 
from 
the 
so-called 
downstream 
business, 
i.e., 
finance, 
insurance, 
accessories, 
maintenance/repair and fleet management (Dannenberg 2005, p.41). OEMs are trying to 
capture a significant portion of the after-sales, maintenance, and repair business through their 
own (or licensed) sales networks. This shift from hardware sales to service is also reflected in 
the business models and their cash flow streams over time. OEMs are offering leasing to 
businesses and individuals – also increasingly through their own financial services 
departments – and bundle vehicles with all-in service contracts to gain repeat-customer 
contacts. In the most extreme form, examples from other industries like telecommunication 
providers become so-called “continuous service providers” (Bolton 1998), which generate 
revenues only as long as customers maintain the contractual relationship with the company. 
Recently, however, entrepreneur and former SAP executive Shai Agassi transformed this 
concept in the automotive space by presenting his project “Better Place” for introducing 
electric cars to the Israeli market (Congress 2007, see also http://www.betterplace.com/). 
According to his plans, customers do not buy those vehicles, but finance the subsidized 
hardware through the purchase of batteries and electricity services only. This concept would 
represent the final shift from a hardware-selling OEM to a mobility solution provider. But 
even today, success of all offerings finally depends on carefully managing relationships with 
customers after the initial purchase. Understanding customers’ motivations and decision 
criteria for entering such relationships is a necessary (but not sufficient) prerequisite to 
customer relationship management (CRM). This requirement becomes especially valid at the 
unification of the previously-mentioned trends of technification and increasing importance of 
the service sector. I refer to this point of unification – when services are delivered by 
technologically-powered mechanisms – as “Connected Services.” 
Both trends, individually but even more in their combined form as Connected Services, 
strengthen the need to understand technology acceptance and usage. Consumers are required 
to deal with an ever-ascending level of products and services enabled by technology. 
Corporations, on the other hand, need to develop those products and services in such a way 
that acceptance and usage is not hindered by the technology itself. The business relevance is, 
of course, based on the following implicit assumption: only acceptance can lead to 
satisfaction (and usage), and only then can satisfaction lead to loyalty as a main lever for

profitable business. Consequently, any service or product failing to be accepted by consumers 
will also fail to generate all subsequently expected benefits to the company.  
In a general business context, and not limited to any specific industry, the difficulty of 
introducing new products and services in the market has been acknowledged in various 
market studies, reporting failure rates to be in the range from 40% up to 90% (Leenders and 
Voermans 2007). In those cases, products are withdrawn from the market within only one 
year and have – for various reasons – obviously not been accepted by consumers. 
Remembering the previously described trends, two examples from different industries show 
the ongoing relevance of this topic. 
The first example deals with the telecommunication service providers in Europe, which are 
still struggling with the acceptance and market penetration of UMTS (Universal Mobile 
Telecommunications System), the third generation (3G) network standard and successor 
standard of GSM. UMTS does provide much higher bandwidth (up to 7.2 MBit vs. 220KBit 
of GSM), which enables video calls via mobile phones or mobile broad band connections. 
Network operators were eager to participate in the bid for network licenses at high prices – 
especially in Germany, where six network operators each paid about 8 billion of Euros in 
2000. Hutchinson launched a network provider in Austria named “3” in 2003 and was one of 
the first players in the market to offer handsets to consumers leveraging the new features. 
However, the declared goal of half a million customers by the end of 2005 was clearly 
missed, and only barely reached before “3” was in the market for five years (Sokolov 2004). 
By the end of 2003, two of the German bidders lost or returned their licenses to the regulatory 
authority. Currently, the search for so-called “killer applications” focuses on data 
transmission as a potential candidate to amortize the previously-made investments, because 
no other mass market offering was found in the meantime. By 2003, president of the UMTS 
forum Bernd Eylert had already concluded that “for profits we reasonably assume a period of 
seven to ten years” (Knape 2003). While several providers slowly started to (only) market 
data cards for mobile Internet access on computers, the launch of the second generation of 
Apple’s iPhone in mid-2008, with several features dependent upon a continuous and fast 
Internet access, might ultimately bring the required number of customers and revenue per 
customer into place. But even if this development is able to save the UMTS business of the 
mobile network operators, it is interesting to note that they were not, on their own, able to 
manage, and convince customers of, their new technology.  
The software industry in general (and both Apple and Microsoft in particular) provides 
another example of how critical technology acceptance is for the success of a business. Two 
aspects demonstrate this statement: The 90/10 rule assumes that users spend 90% of their time 
on only 10% of the features available in software applications (Kendrick 2008), for example 

 1 Introduction to Connected Services 
4 
in Microsoft Office. But while this “only” reduces the perceived capability of the products, 
Microsoft reported that “in a recent customer survey, we asked users what features they 
wanted from the new version of Microsoft Office. More than 90 percent asked for features 
that were already available in Office” (Microsoft 2006). On the other hand, the high perceived 
usability of Apple software and products seems to result from Apple’s approach to focus its 
development efforts on those 10% of features which are dominantly used (Kendrick 2008). 
If we now consider the automotive industry, the “historic” goal of simply selling the car to 
customers has been enriched by the process of selling options. The challenge to bring 
complex technological features to customers (and to make them pay for it) has been 
highlighted in a recent study on car innovations: based on a buying simulation with 14 
innovations, only 17% make their way into customers’ vehicles (Wyman 2007). The 
development of a new vehicle currently costs up to one billion Euros: e.g., the already 
mentioned VW Phaeton required an estimated minimum investment of 670 Mio. Euros for the 
development and production process (Hofmann 2002). Given the magnitude of the financial 
investment, innovations that do not deliver their calculated take-rates cannot amortize their 
investment, and have a severe impact on the profitability of OEMs. That said, the acceptance 
(and usage) of technologies is critical not only to the direct financial effect, but also to “soft 
factors” like satisfaction and loyalty, which – in the long run – also contribute to business 
success or failure. 
Within this automotive context, this thesis is focused on “Connected Services” rendered 
through technologies. For a better understanding of the particularities of such services, I first 
describe two illustrative examples that are known as “Teleservice” and “Emergency Call.” In 
essence, both services are based on a remote, bi-directional data connection between vehicle 
and service center, via mobile networks. This infrastructure enables Teleservice scenarios 
such as automatic notification of a dealer when a maintenance need is detected by the vehicle, 
remote diagnosis in a breakdown situation or, in the most advanced stage, the installation of 
software updates and repairs without the need to bring the vehicle to the dealer for service.  
The Emergency Call service (E-Call) enables a vehicle involved in an accident to 
automatically send its last location to an emergency call center, which in turn can dispatch 
emergency services such as paramedics if the driver is not able to confirm his condition via an 
automatically-established voice connection. This feature has prompted recent interest in 
Connected Services on political and legislative levels. The European Commission plans to 
make E-Call mandatory for every new vehicle sold in the European Union from September 
2010. But while discussions of the implementation and standardization efforts are ongoing 
and seem to postpone enacting the law by at least one year, offerings by OEMs have been in 
place for several years.  

 1.1 “TAM Reloaded” or why it becomes ever more important 
5
For example, General Motors’ “OnStar” system in the US market recently reported serving 
more than 5 million customers (GeneralMotors 2007), revealing a clear demand for such 
services from the market side. At the January 2009 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las 
Vegas, Alan Mulally, CEO of Ford, further raised the awareness of Connected Services with 
two notable statements. First, together with development partner Microsoft, he introduced the 
news that Ford will offer an enhanced version of its telematic offering (called Ford Sync) in 
its full vehicle lineup beginning in 2010, with plans to expand beyond the North American 
market. While Ford has already sold 1 million vehicles with the first generation of Sync, a 
music-player and mobile phone connection, the new generation product includes a GPS 
receiver, and adds traffic, direction, and information services (Pope 2009). Second, Mulally 
claims that vehicles equipped with Sync sell almost twice as fast as non-equipped vehicles, 
creating hope for connectivity as a stimulus during difficult times in the industry (Hannemann 
and Matting 2009). 
Such market developments prove the relevance of this field of research, and further spurred 
my interest in a subject that is still largely untapped in the academic literature. Whether the 
product is C2C Communication, E-Call, or any other offering in this product area, acceptance 
of the technology by the consumer is required from the start.  
Although the stream of research on technology acceptance is extensive and after two decades 
may even have reached some limits, there are still a number of significant gaps in the 
literature. These can be at least partly attributed to the original setting of Davis’ work: he 
tested the acceptance of (business) software applications such as word processing and chart-
generating programs with white-collar employees of IBM and MBA students (Davis 1989). 
Therefore, model and study inherently focused on B2B and, primarily, mandatory usage 
settings, whereas the context of this thesis is clearly focused on end-use consumers in a 
completely voluntary setting. The consumer-oriented research is supported by Baron, 
Patterson, and Harris’s conclusion that, in the context of consumers, whose behavior might be 
counter-intuitive, “derivation of adapted theory constitutes worthwhile research” (Baron, 
Patterson, and Harris 2006, p.111).  
In the B2C setting, it is generally assumed that consumers are following the principles of the 
homo oeconomicus (Hirschman and Stern 1999). This, in turn, makes inevitable the inclusion 
of price-performance ratio as an implicit consequence of choice (between alternatives). The 
influence of pricing on the acceptance of technology has not, to the best of my knowledge, 
been researched until now.  
On the other hand, consumers do not always follow this principle of “maximization of their 
own benefit.” The rejection of the purely rational consumer is also reflected in TAM due to its 
heritage in behavioral models like “Theory of Reasoned Action” (Ajzen and Fishbein 1980). 

 1 Introduction to Connected Services 
6 
Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw (1992) added the construct of “Perceived Enjoyment” as a 
small but significant extension in a later version of TAM that emphasized this behavioral 
aspect. In this research as well, however, Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw’s focus was on 
applications of software in the workplace, i.e., in a mandatory setting. According to a 
classification of Chitturi and Mahajan (2008), the advantage of adopting technology in such a 
mandatory setting clearly results in utilitarian benefits. On the other hand, and not 
surprisingly, enjoyment was also confirmed as a determinant in applications with inherently 
hedonic contexts, such as websites, video games, or SMS/MMS (Bart et al. 2005; Lee, 
Cheung, and Zhaohui 2007; Okazaki, Skapa, and Grande 2007; Turel, Serenko, and Bontis 
2007). The question that arises is whether enjoyment is also relevant to Connected Services, 
which are either utilitarian or hedonic, or, as in most cases, satisfy both aspects 
simultaneously. While the E-Call is clearly a utilitarian-use case, acquiring information on the 
nearest Italian restaurant also serves a hedonic demand.  
Analysis of the Apple iPod, as one of the most important product introductions in consumer 
electronics over the last years, hints toward another potential factor for the acceptance of 
technology. Apple in general, and the iPod in particular, fascinates people because of the 
product simplicity and the brand recognition. While simplicity is a key factor in the 
enjoyment (and ease of use), the branding influence on technology acceptance and usage 
deserves separate examination. The role of brands has, for a long time, been established as a 
guide for consumers, both when selecting products or services in situations of incomplete 
information, and as a declaration of inclusion in a specific community or style group (Kotler 
and Bliemel 1999, p.690f). Considering the transfer of the role of brands to the acceptance of 
technologies reveals the existence of alternatives and the significance of prestige as support or 
even prerequisite for consumer’s choices. While the meaning of alternatives was mentioned in 
the context of pricing considerations, the influence of prestige is implicitly referred to in the 
innovation diffusion literature, where Rogers accounts observability – the “degree to which 
the results of an innovation are visible to others,” as one of the five main innovation attributes 
(Rogers 2003, p.16). Assuming that brands have an influence on the technology acceptance 
process, can Connected Services, as an attachment to a core product with an existing brand 
reputation, leverage this fit, i.e., can Connected Services benefit from a brand stretch? Again, 
research has not analyzed this relation between brands, prestige, and technology acceptance. 
From this perspective, one aim of, and justification for, this research project develops from 
the synthesis of these introduced aspects, which previously were only looked at in an isolated 
way or in different disciplines.  
From a methodology perspective, this thesis contributes to the ongoing discussion of the 
strength of the relationship between intention and actual behavior. The largest portion of 
studies in this field use “intention to use” as their dependent variable as an approximation of 

 1.2 Research questions and objectives of the thesis 
7
actual usage (Benbasat and Barki 2007; Straub Jr. and Burton-Jones 2007), and very often 
derive data from simulations with students or other participants who are not actual users of 
the researched product or service. Subsequently (and perhaps also inherently caused by the 
name of research stream, technology acceptance) research does not offer explanations or 
models on the transition from technology acceptance to technology usage. For example, 
research has shown significantly different evaluations of systems and buying decisions on the 
appropriate number of features in mobile audio-/video players, and has highlighted the 
increasing importance of usability over time (Rust, Thompson, and Hamilton 2006). As 
shown in the examples of new business models in the service industry, understanding of this 
change is particularly important for corporations in order to support customers in their 
transition from accepting a service to using and benefiting from that service on a long-term 
basis. Hence, more research is needed on subjects where behavioral and socio-demographic 
consumer data is triangulated and extended with actual acceptance and longitudinal usage 
data.  
Following the depicted process from acceptance to usage, the link from usage to satisfaction 
and loyalty evolves naturally. While loyalty is at the center of a separate and wide stream of 
research in marketing, a holistic evaluation of the influence on technology acceptance and 
usage as antecedents of referral and (re-)buying intentions represents a promising yet 
untapped approach.  
1.2 
Research questions and objectives of the thesis 
The automotive context of this thesis was triggered by two considerations. On one hand, the 
trends described in the previous section show a clear demand from the business side, but also 
indicate an opportunity for the academic research. On the other hand, the organizational 
setting of working with and within an automotive OEM during this dissertation project 
allowed me access to internal knowledge, to experts, and to a customer base which would not 
have been possible in any other way. Fortunately, research interests and support from the 
OEM matched very well in the in the scope of Connected Services, where the OEM is one of 
the leading providers in the market. The relevant services in the automotive context are 
widely known and are consolidated under the term “telematics.”  
Overall, the organizational construct of this dissertation is based on following a prototypical 
customer through the product life-cycle, with the intention of developing an understanding of 
the customer acceptance. With a focus on acceptance and usage, challenges and pitfalls from 
daily business and their relevance for academic research need to be uncovered. At the same 
time, managerial implications drawn from a well-established framework of theory and 
methodology should help to further strengthen the bridge between research and practice.  

 1 Introduction to Connected Services 
8 
The aim of the dissertation can be precisely formulated in five research questions: 
1. What are the relevant factors leading customers to accept Connected Services? 
2. In which way do these factors differ, when customers use those previously accepted 
Connected Services? 
3. Is there an influence of the brand image of the OEM and the product brand itself on 
acceptance and usage of Connected Services? 
4. Do technology acceptance and usage influence loyalty in terms of renewal rates and 
referral behavior? 
5. In the end-to-end model of the customer lifecycle with Connected Services, which 
challenges and pitfalls further influence success in daily business? 
The first research question directly targets the extensive literature available on the field of 
technology acceptance. Important issues to consider are which factors are relevant to the 
decision to accept, or at least the intention to accept, Connected Services, the strength of each 
of these factors, and how much variance can be explained through a model based on these 
factors? In this specific context, acceptance is ultimately measured through the rate of 
vehicles where Connected Services has been selected as an option (the take-rate) and for 
which the contract has been activated, i.e., registered via a dedicated website, fax, or mail. 
Investigation of an example from B2B can potentially identify differences to the B2C market, 
and can thereby add further support for analyzing the B2C sector separately.  
Consequently, the second research question of technology usage only becomes relevant if 
acceptance of the technology has been established. The comparison of the factors and changes 
in the relevance evolves naturally if data on both groups are available for analysis. In other 
words, how does usage moderate the evaluation criteria for Connected Services? This 
question will first be analyzed on a dichotomous level, i.e., asking whether users are different 
from non-users in their expectations and motivations. Secondarily, a multi-group analysis 
between users of different usage levels might reveal further idiosyncrasies. Usage for 
Connected Services is measured in intensity (number of usages per month) and width 
(number of services used) through an 11-month period.  
The third research question, on the role of brand images, is particularly motivated from a 
marketing perspective. If brands are able to guide consumers who are purchasing goods and 
services, does this also hold true for complex, technology-based services? In this context, the 
question becomes multi-faceted, because Connected Services obviously constitute a by-
product of the vehicle or, more specifically, of the underlying in-vehicle central computer – 
the so-called “head unit.” To the customer, the head unit is primarily recognized (and 
selected) for the navigation system and entertainment features. Assuming that brands are at all 

 1.3 Research design and thesis structure 
9
relevant in this setting, do customers then differentiate between those “levels” (vehicle brand 
vs. service brand) of offerings? If so, what correlations can be found, i.e., can Connected 
Services leverage a positive brand spillover effect from the OEM brand, and can those 
services in turn strengthen the core brand of the OEM?  
Loyalty is at the center of the fourth research question, and is predominantly targeted at the 
loyalty for Connected Services. The OEM is offering Connected Services with an initial trial 
phase, extending contracts on a yearly basis afterwards. From a loyalty standpoint, the 
customer decisions on renewing or canceling the contract are “moments of truth,” because 
customers do not reveal their appreciation for the services until then. Two approaches to the 
questions posed by loyalty issues are suitable, and both are implemented in order to uncover 
relationships between technology usage and renewal rates: a multi-group comparison of 
customers with a contract versus customers who had recently canceled their contracts, and 
analysis of usage patterns. This analysis includes overall usage behaviors of the two customer 
groups, as well as usage at specific points in time such as the very beginning or near the end 
of the contract period.  
Loyalty with the OEM because of Connected Services is another interesting analysis, if for no 
other reason than for the business case of such services. However, two obstacles set this issue 
outside the focus of this dissertation. First, the question of causality will always be a major 
challenge, and second, a longitudinal study with data points beyond the average vehicle 
lifetime with the first owner would be required. Even when limiting the analysis to business 
customers with lease contract lengths of only three years, reliable results would necessitate a 
timeframe of six-plus years to cover three vehicle decisions.  
The fifth and final research question aims to broaden the view on Connected Services by 
looking beyond the pure methodological- and theory-based analysis. It also intends to reflect 
my personal experience of more than two years, working on bringing customers and telematic 
services together. I believe there are further challenges and pitfalls a company must overcome 
when trying to deliver Connected Services to customers. While one might note that those 
issues are “only” daily business issues, I would argue that special consideration of the 
particularities of marketing Connected Services is necessary for designing and interpreting 
reliable academic research, which in turn allows for marketable managerial implications.

Research design and thesis structure 
This thesis is based on both qualitative and quantitative methods. Exploratory research has 
been necessary at the beginning since the area of Connected Services, especially in the 
automotive industry, constitutes an emerging market which inherently has been untapped by

Chapter 2 opens with a definition and classification of Connected Services, and then 
addresses the rich body of IS literature on technology acceptance. Next, the foundations and 
current status of technology acceptance models are summarized. Review of previously 
isolated aspects of hedonic use, the influence of branding, and the role of pricing are allow the 
integration of research from other disciplines such as consumer behavior and marketing into 
the research. Chapter 2 closes with a critical appreciation of the progress made to date, and a 
statement of gaps in the existing literature.  
Chapter 3 begins with a description of the conceptual framework of this thesis. The research 
design of the qualitative section, as well as the idiosyncrasies of the automotive industry and 
their consumers are discussed. At the heart of this chapter are three case studies. The first is 
about “BMW ConnectedDrive,” BMW’s telematic offering which is centered on convenience 
and security features. The second case study deals with “BMW TeleServices,” which allows 
for preventive diagnosis and data exchange in the event of a breakdown. Within this case 
study, a comparative look at a technically similar offering of a service provider for 
commercial vehicles highlights differences and commonalities. The third case study analyzes 
entertainment features in the vehicle, which are based on telematic infrastructure. A prototype 
of “BMW Personal Radio,” which has already been introduced to the public, sheds further 
light on the research scope. Chapter 3 ends with a cross-case analysis highlighting need for 
and implications of further research. 

 1.3 Research design and thesis structure 
11
The review of the status quo of research in Chapter 2 and the introduction of the conceptual 
framework of this research project in Chapter 4 create the path toward the proposition of a 
working model for Connected Services in the automotive industry. Chapter 4 further merges 
theory with practice related to the thesis project: rationality and hypothesis on the introduced 
model parameters are exposed consecutively.  
Chapter 5 centers on the quantitative analyses based on a customer survey and corresponding 
usage data from the BMW ConnectedDrive case study. The methodology for deriving the data 
is followed by several analyses based on a larger sample of vehicles with actual usage data. 
Survey and usage data are then analyzed with the help of structural equation modeling (SEM). 
First, non-users are tested for any intention to accept Connected Services. Second, users and 
former users (i.e., customers who recently canceled their contract,) constitute the base for the 
technology usage model. Third, those users are categorized based on their usage intensity and 
are compared by a multi-group SEM analysis. Fourth, multi-group SEM is also used to 
identify differences among customers with active contracts versus those who recently 
canceled their relationships with the service provider. This model is supplemented with 
analyses on usage behavior of those groups. An overall comparison completes chapter 5.  
Chapter 6 summarizes and deliberates on the findings from case studies and from modeling a 
holistic examination of the long-tail innovation adoption and diffusion process. From that 
review, academic and managerial implications for scholars and practitioners dealing with 
complex, technology-based services like Connected Services are derived. The chapter closes 
with an outlook toward future research needs, and toward opportunities in this and adjacent 
areas. 

 
2 Scoping the research focus through theoretical foundations 
2.1 
Connected Services – definition, differentiation, and state of affairs 
This section provides a definition of “Connected Services,” but also categorizes and 
differentiates the construct from other terms used in the service area. However, this 
clarification is preceded by a foundational consideration of the most important literature in the 
fields of (general) services, self-service technologies, and remote services (or remote objects).  
2.1.1 
Services are peculiar products 
The recognition of services as an separate stream of research in marketing only gained wider 
popularity in the 1980s (Meffert 1994; Rust and Tuck Siong 2007; Schlissel and Chasin 
1991). In a meta analysis, Rust and Chung (2007) point out that in the 1982 inaugural issue of 
Marketing Science three out of five contributions dealt with the goods sector and no article was 
explicitly devoted to the service sector. By the Fall 2004 issue, none of the ten articles 
covered the goods sector. Obviously, the rise of the service sector to become the primary 
contributor to today’s industrialized economy’s gross domestic product has spurred this shift 
of interest.  
Despite the establishment of services in research, an ultimate definition is still missing, 
discussed at length by Meffert (1994). This might also be seen as an indicator of the service 
industry dynamics, and has lead some authors to offer several service definitions 
(Fitzsimmons and Fitzsimmons 2001, p.5). Nevertheless, the main and most commonly 
agreed upon characteristics of services, as listed in Kotler and Bliemel (1999), are the 
following: 
 
Immateriality refers to the non-tangibility of a service, distinguishing it from a 
physical good. To absorb potential insecurity of the buyer, qualifying elements like 
friendly personnel, reachable places of delivery, and modern equipment should be 
used by the service provider, as should informative communication material, and 
appropriate names and logos.  
 
Integration of an external factor requires some object or the buyer himself to be 
available to the service provider. Therefore, integration also demands a synchronous 
contact between customer and the person providing the service.  
 
Implicitly stated in the characteristic of integration, services are perishable and cannot 
be stored for later consumption. Service providers must deal with this restriction in 
terms of capacity management on the one hand, and quality management on the other 

 2 Scoping the research focus through theoretical foundations 
14 
hand, which is noted as a separate particularity in the management of services by 
Kotler and Bliemel.  
As depicted in the introductory chapter, the trend of “technification” (in the sense of an 
overall increase of technology across all areas of life) also influences the service sector and its 
occurrences, such as self-service technologies or remote services.  
2.1.2 
Self-service technologies  
Across industries, an historical trend toward technification could be seen. Consequently, 
service providers were affected by this “technology infusion” (Bitner, Brown, and Meuter 
2000), and self-service technologies (SST) emerged as a new type of services. In this case, 
technology not only supports but replaces altogether the direct contact with the service 
provider employee. Meuter et al. define self-service technologies as “technological interfaces 
that enable customers to produce a service independent of direct services employee 
involvement,” and cite “automated teller machines, automated hotel checkout, banking by 
telephone and services over the Internet” as examples (Meuter et al. 2000, p.50). Their 
findings reveal that the major sources of satisfaction are the easy accessibility of SST, the 
relative advantage compared to service employees in terms of time and ease of use, and the 
fulfillment of the expected task in the way it was intended. On the negative side, all types of 
failure from the technology – a poor process, a poor design, or customer-driver failures – are 
potential sources of dissatisfaction. Bürg and Mandl (2004) cover E-Learning in companies as 
another example of SST, and already hint at the challenge of acceptance rates, which several 
studies indicate are not more than 50%. In the past decade, modern-form research on these 
specific types of services has increased (in contrast to early applications on hotel vending 
machines versus room service), with subjects including the influence of individual consumer 
traits and situational factors (Dabholkar and Bagozzi 2002), the role of technology anxiety 
(Meuter et al. 2003), the availability of alternative service delivery modes such as phone, web, 
or counters (Meuter et al. 2005), the influence of technology readiness on online stock trading 
systems (Lin, Shih, and Sher 2007), and the role of design features such as comparative 
information and interactivity (Zhu et al. 2007).  
SST offer many advantages to customers. From another perspective, its deployment by 
companies is mainly motivated by the potential savings and the increased or continuous 
quality, compared to employees delivering the service, as well as the attempt to lure new 
customers (Parasuraman and Grewal 2000). Consequently, its usage is expected to grow or to 
be introduced along most service providers. An additional type of services – remote services – 
has recently developed. 

 2.1 Connected Services – definition, differentiation, and state of affairs 
15
2.1.3 
Remote services and objects 
Remote services combine the strong reliance on technology from self-service technologies 
with the “traditional” service employee mainly rendering the service to the customer. 
Wünderlich et al. propose remote services as “services, which are delivered through a 
technologically initiated process between service provider and customer independently of the 
spatial distance and where the remote service object is modified through a bi-directional 
control unit.” (2007, p.7) They cite as examples remote surgery and, in the mechanical 
engineering industry, remote maintenance and diagnosis. In the first scenario, a surgeon 
utilizes a monitor and force-feedback input devices to control a remote robotic system 
connected through a dedicated line (delivering the necessary bandwidth requirements). In the 
second scenario, a data connection from the OEM to the customer’s machine, e.g., a printing 
machine, allows for regular checks of parameters and software. In the case of an error, the 
service technician can also connect to the machine for troubleshooting and to resolve software 
problems. In the event of a hardware defect, the service employee might fix the error together 
with the help of the client service employee, guided through the remote connection and/or 
telephone.  
Both examples constitute one main difference to the self-service technologies described here: 
with remote services, technology does not replace the “production factor man,” but rather 
supports and extends his reach. Wünderlich et al. (2007, p.12) perceive the “special form of 
integration of the external factor,” referring to the modification of the remote service object, 
as one constitutive element of remote services. Following an analysis by Diller and Kusterer 
(1988), the other element of remote services is a restriction of the interaction levels. While 
services with a local and physical counterpart also involve an organizational level, a political 
level, and a human and emotional level, remote services are limited to the rational level, i.e., 
to the factual fulfillment of the task. Therefore, the supplier of remote services needs to 
satisfy the other levels through alternative means, and/or during other stages than the 
rendering of the service, such as the sales pitch before or at aftercare operations.  
Further literature on the specific area of remote services is scarce to date, although predictions 
on the rise of services, where “producer and client interact remotely” were made as early as 
1997 (Kasper 1997, p.38). While the term “remote services” was not coined in the article, 
Kasper remarks on the risk of “negative consumer behavior because consumers fail to do 
what the innovator expects them to” (p.39).

Connected Services 
The previous definitions of self-service technologies on the one hand, and remote services on 
the other hand, paved the way to introduce “Connected Services” as a proposal for an 
integrated view. While there are several use cases justifying and even requiring a specific 
separation, the research focus of this dissertation includes services from both worlds. In 
anticipation of the explorative research exposed in the next chapter, service providers and 
customers in the automotive context seem to follow a similar, conjoined perception of the 
services. I therefore suggest the following working definition for the term “Connected 
Services”: 
“Connected Services are services rendered for the customer from any place of the world, 
which alter the current state of the service object with the help of a technical infrastructure. 
This infrastructure provides a two-way communication and data channel from the object to 
the service provider. Services can be generated by automated processes as self-service 
technologies, but can also be delivered by service employees utilizing the same 
infrastructure.”

An example from an automotive OEM (which will later be elaborated in the qualitative 
research section) illustrates the required and optional processes of Connected Services with 
two use cases. In the first scenario, which represents a self-service technology, the user 
searches for a free parking lot for his vehicle that is close to his destination, which the user 
already inputted to his navigation system. By initiating the search through a browser in the 
central information display in his vehicle, the request with the destination coordinates is sent 

 2.2 Theoretical bases of technology acceptance from IS research 
17
to the data center of the service provider through a mobile network data connection. The 
result of the database query on parking spaces and the current number of free parking lots is 
then transferred back to the vehicle. The driver selects a destination from the results list and 
the navigation system is automatically provided with the new input. In the second scenario, 
which represents a remote service, the driver faces a breakdown of his vehicle. He deploys a 
Teleservice call from within the vehicle, which institutes a voice connection, over an 
integrated GSM connection, to a motor mechanic of the OEM. After a first verbal check, data 
on the current status of the vehicle are transferred to the data center, visible to the mechanic 
for further analysis. Finally, control commands are dispatched from the service employee over 
the data center and the network connection back to the vehicle, where a control unit is reset 
and the (software) problem is solved.  
This doctoral dissertation investigates consumers acceptance and use of such Connected 
Services. To this point, considerable efforts have been made to explain technology 
acceptance. Frameworks and models have been developed, validated, and refined for the area 
of technology-based products, but self-service technologies have been evaluated also. Despite 
the idiosyncrasies of Connected Services, the research literature stream on technology 
acceptance from Information Research offers several approaches which are relevant to this 
research project. 
2.2 
Theoretical bases of technology acceptance from IS research 
The origin and development of the technology acceptance literature constitutes a major issue 
in information systems (IS) research. Because the goal of this dissertation is to gain an 
understanding of how and why consumers use, and thereby accept, technologies, the focus is 
on the stream of research which makes intention to use or usage the dependent variable. 
Therefore, alternative concepts such as the task-technology fit (Goodhue and Thompson 
1995) or the organizational implementation success1 are not explicitly presented here.  
Figure 3 represents a general framework, which formulates the basic idea constituted in all 
successive models. It is interesting to note that Venkatesh et al. (2003) also include a direct 
path from the individual reaction to actual usage, and allow for inclusion of previous usage 
experience into the (next) reaction to the system, as indicated through the dotted feedback 
line:

Figure 3: Basic conceptual framework (Venkatesh et al. 2003, p.427) 
This generic description applies to all of the subsequent acceptance models, and can be traced 
back to origins in the Theory of Reasoned Action model. Despite extensions in the Theory of 
Planned Behavior, in the well-known Technology Acceptance Model, or even in the latest 
unifying approach of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, the basic 
logic can always be retrieved, as the following sections demonstrate. 
2.2.1 
The antecedents TRA and TPB 
Although already introduced to social psychology by Fishbein alone in 1967, the refined 
model together with Ajzen (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975) gains most attention as a fundamental 
theory of human behavior. As such, it forms the basis for various other models. The core 
assumption of Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) lies in the rationality of humans, i.e., 
“people consider the implications of their actions before they decide to engage or not engage 
in a given behavior” (Ajzen and Fishbein 1980, p. 5). Given this assumption, the actual 
behavior is determined and can be predicted by the intention to perform (or not to perform). 
The authors find “attitude towards the behavior” and “subjective norm concerning the 
behavior” to be the two determinants of “intentions to perform the behavior,” and finally of 
the behavior itself (presented in Appendix 1). For both determinants, “attitudes are a function 
of beliefs” (Ajzen and Fishbein 1980, p.7), and are either behavioral beliefs preceding a 
person’s attitude, or are normative beliefs which form the basis for the perceived subjective 
norm. With regard to a range of external variables such as personality characteristics or socio-
demographic factors, the authors deny the direct influence on behavior. Rather, they propose 
those external variables as moderators of a person’s beliefs or of the relations from attitude 
and subjective norms to intention. 
Ajzen later extends TRA to “Theory of Planned Behavior” (TBP), with the construct of 
behavior control (Ajzen 1985). This measures whether the required skills, resources, and 
other prerequisites are in place to perform the intended behavior (Ajzen 1991), i.e., the ease or 
difficulty of performing the behavior is considered as a moderator between intention and 
actual behavior (shown in Appendix 2). For the prediction of this additional factor, in which 
the direct measurement is very sophisticated, “perceived behavioral control” serves as a proxy 
to actual behavioral control. In an analogy to “behavioral beliefs” and “attitude toward 

 2.2 Theoretical bases of technology acceptance from IS research 
19
behavior,” perceived behavioral control is also determined by beliefs, which are called 
“control beliefs.” 
In a review on the use of TPB, Ajzen himself (1991) found several studies applying this 
framework to the prediction of intention and behavior in varying contexts. Recent studies in 
the technology acceptance and usage setting concentrate on the extension of the model with 
new factors (Khalifa and Ning Shen 2008; Meng-Hsiang and Chao-Min 2004; Morris, 
Venkatesh, and Ackerman 2005) or on integrative approaches with TAM (Chen, Fan, and 
Farn 2007; Pavlou 2002). Taylor and Todd make two empirical comparisons: on the one 
hand, they find TPB to be of equal power compared to the original TRA, and superior when 
the belief structures where further decomposed (Taylor and Todd 1995a), and on the other 
hand they confirm the predictive power of usage to be comparable to the TAM of Davis 
(Taylor and Todd 1995b), which is regarded as a derivation of TRA and TPB to the more 
specific space of information technology.  
2.2.2 
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) 
The Technology Acceptance Model is not only one of the most cited references,2 but it 
constitutes a separate research stream. First described in Davis’ doctoral dissertation (1986), 
his publication in MIS Quarterly (Davis 1989) and especially his work with Bagozzi and 
Warshaw (Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1989) attracted the attention of numerous 
researchers and practitioners. At that time, information technology for the first time promised 
substantial efficiency gains for companies, but many users seemed to reject the new systems 
in the workplace, leading Davis to the motivation “aside from their theoretical value, better 
measures for predicting and explaining system use would have great practical value, both for 
vendors who would like to assess user demand for new design ideas, and for information 
systems managers within user organizations who would like to evaluate these vendor 
offerings” (1989, p.319).  
The original model, as drafted by Davis (1989; 1986) and also tested in Davis, Bagozzi, and 
Warshaw (1989), is shown in Figure 4. The main determinants of the model for computer 
acceptance behavior were labeled “perceived usefulness” (PU) and “perceived ease of use” 
(EOU).

Figure 4: Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1989, p.985) 
Davis defined “perceived usefulness” as “the degree to which a person believes that using a 
particular system would enhance his or her job performance” from the general sense of useful 
as “capable of being used advantageously” (Davis 1989, p.320). The quite narrow definition 
of PU becomes understandable in the light of the empirical studies performed by Davis: on 
the one hand, users of the IBM Toronto Development Laboratory were investigated on their 
evaluation and (self-reported) usage with an Email application and a file editor software. On 
the other hand, MBA students were surveyed on two PC applications for the generation of 
business graphs, charts, and graphics. In the same line, Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 
scrutinized the handling of a word processing program by students during their fourteen-week 
MBA semester. All in all, perceived usefulness seems to matter to users and to subsequently 
increase their likelihood of accepting and using computer systems when their job performance 
is improved and, in the long run, helps them to achieve higher bonuses or promotions.  
The second antecedent of attitude, intention, and actual use is “perceived ease of use,” defined 
as “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of 
effort,“ following the idea of ease as “freedom from difficulty or great effort” (Davis 1989, 
p.320). The usage of computer systems might be complicated by a user interface in multiple 
ways, e.g., by complex menu structures, long process chains to reach get to frequently used 
outputs, or commands which are hard to learn and remember. All those matters are in the 
focus of usability and, depending on the definition, are in the focus of ergonomic research. In 
Davis’s model, EOU is expected to have a direct positive effect on attitude, but also to 
positively influence (the resulting) perceived usefulness. In the same paper, Davis also refers 
to the cost-benefit paradigm from behavioral decision theory which postulates users to weight 
benefits (usefulness) and costs (ease or difficulty to use). In contrast to TRA, where all beliefs 
are summed up, TAM does acknowledge PU and EOU as related, but distinct, constructs. 
Empirical results (described later) indeed suggest that users do not consider benefits and costs 
to have the same importance, i.e., their relative importance is weighted differently.   
For the dependent variable “actual system use,” TAM suggests “behavioral intention” (BI) as 
a determinant, which in turn is the result of a positive “attitude towards using” the system and 
thereby proceeds fully in line with the TRA model. But TAM is divergent from TRA in two 

 2.2 Theoretical bases of technology acceptance from IS research 
21
dimensions: first, TAM does propose a direct effect of PU to BI and, second, it does not 
include the factor “subjective norms.” To complete the model description, external variables 
are introduced as a link to “the various individual differences, situational constraints and 
managerially controllable interventions” (Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1989, p.988). Despite 
this claim, the empirical studies of the same paper do not further analyze the effects of 
external variables.  
The results from the reported empirical studies can be summarized in five points as follows: 
first, the hypothesized relations of PU and EOU as determinants were consistently confirmed, 
but the correlation between usefulness and usage behavior was significantly greater than that 
of ease of use (Davis 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1989). Second, in the longitudinal 
study, the significance of the direct effect from EOU to BI at the beginning of the study 
diminished to a non-significant contribution after fourteen weeks. At that time, users seemed 
to value EOU only indirectly through PU, which brings the authors to the practical but 
plausible conclusion that “although ease of use is clearly important, the usefulness of the 
system is even more important and should not be overlooked. Users may be willing to tolerate 
a difficult interface in order to access functionality that is very important, while no amount of 
ease of use will be able to compensate for a system that doesn't do a useful task” (Davis, 
Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1989, p.1000). Third, with regard to attitude, only a partial mediation 
through PU could be supported. Fourth, empirical data also supported the model in the 
relation from behavioral intention, to use, to actual system use if measured at the same time 
(correlated at 0.63), but also from intention after a one-hour introduction to usage fourteen 
weeks later, despite a lower correlation of 0.35. Fifth, subjective norms from the TRA model, 
which were tested in parallel, did not have a significant influence in this technology context. 
As an overall implication from these outcomes, Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw (1989, p. 997) 
identify a “more parsimonious causal structure that is powerful for predicting and explaining 
user behavior based on only three theoretical constructs: behavioral intention, perceived 
usefulness and perceived ease of use,” as depicted in Figure 5. In this reduced model, the 
influence on BI at the beginning of the study was  = 0.62 from PU and  = 0.20 from EOU. 
After fourteen weeks, only PU remained at  = 0.79, with EOU only indirectly accounting for 
 = 0.24. Overall, 45% and 57% of the intention variance was explained at the beginning and 
end of the study.

Figure 5: Simplified Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1989) 
This model formed the basis for most applications, extensions and adaptations made by other 
researchers, and also for later models from the authors themselves, e.g., in the work on 
extrinsic and intrinsic motivations to use computers in the workplace (Davis, Bagozzi, and 
Warshaw 1992).  
In this publication, the authors integrated TAM with the motivational model, a model drawn 
also from psychology3, which differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic motivations to 
drive a person’s behavior. In the words of Davis, Bagozzi and Warshaw, extrinsic motivation 
fosters usage “because it is perceived to be instrumental in achieving valued outcomes that are 
distinct from the activity itself, such as improved job performance, pay, or promotions,” while 
intrinsic motivation leads to usage “for no apparent reinforcement other than the process of 
performing the activity per se” (Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1992, p.1112). The TAM 
model was therefore enriched with the intrinsic construct of “perceived enjoyment” (PE) and 
the extrinsic factor of “perceived output quality.” The results re-confirmed the dominance of 
usefulness in determining intentions by a factor of four to five, compared to the also 
significant role of enjoyment. As well, a positive interaction was found between PU and PE, 
which suggests the increasing importance of enjoyment if usefulness of a system is also 
considered high. Furthermore, the outcomes showed ease of use and output quality as 
antecedents of PU and PE, i.e., those factors were only indirectly affecting intentions through 
PU and PE. Finally, a measure of task importance – an indicator for the relevance of the 
system to the user’s workspace – was tested and found to moderate ease of use and output 
quality on usefulness, but not on perceived enjoyment.  
According to an extensive study on the origin and development of technology acceptance 
literature, Lee, Kozar, and Larsen (2003) divide the evolution into four stages with 
overlapping timeframes. The first phase of the literature concentrated on “model introduction”

Motivation,” in Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (29), M. Zanna (ed.), Academic Press, New York, 1997, 
pp. 271-360 as suggested in Venkatesh et al. (2003, p.428) 

 2.2 Theoretical bases of technology acceptance from IS research 
23
and, as described earlier, started with TAM (Davis 1986). From 1992 to 1996, a period of 
“model validation” engaged most researchers. In the third stage, defined by Lee, Kozar and 
Larsen to last from 1994 to 2003, the stage of “model extension” dominated the research 
publications. Finally, the “model elaboration” phase started in 2000 with the TAM 2 model 
and ended in 2003 with the introduction of an integrative model called UTAUT.  
2.2.3 
Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM 2) 
Venkatesh and Davis recognized the need to better understand the main determinants, PU and 
EOU, and the factor beliefs which moderate and mediate them. To their regret, however, most 
researchers concentrated on perceived ease of use (e.g. Venkatesh 2000), despite its much 
lower influence on behavioral intention. The development of the technology acceptance 
model 2 (TAM 2), therefore, claimed to, and did, fill this gap by adding social influence 
processes (subjective norm, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job 
relevance, output quality, research demonstrability and perceived ease of use) (Venkatesh and 
Davis 2000). The entire model is presented in Figure 6.

Figure 6: Technology Acceptance Model 2 (Venkatesh and Davis 2000, p.188) 
Subjective norm was already in discussion in the development and testing of TAM, when 
Davis, Bagozzi and Warshaw found no significant influence on intention, but their study also 
acknowledged the need “to investigate conditions and mechanisms governing the impact of 
social influences on usage behavior” (Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1989, p.999). 
Alternatively, a significant influence could be seen from work in other settings (Taylor and 
Todd 1995b) and was later confirmed in a meta-analysis of 63 studies (Schepers and Wetzels 
2007). The following description of the TAM 2 factors follows the argumentation and 
empirical validation of Venkatesh et al. (2000), if not noted otherwise: 

 2 Scoping the research focus through theoretical foundations 
24 
The factor voluntariness was also researched by Hartwick and Barki (1994), showing that 
social influences are indeed not significant in voluntary settings, but become relevant in 
mandatory settings, e.g., when the use of computer systems is decided on and required by the 
management of a company. Variance in intention was therefore assumed to be moderated by 
voluntariness and included in TAM 2, despite the existence of users, who trigger variance by 
refusing to comply in an enforced system usage context. On the other hand, the process of 
internalization can result in mediation of subjective norms on intention through usefulness. In 
this case, the (believed) opinion of a significant reference person is internalized as the 
subject’s own opinion and ultimately (indirectly) impacts the behavioral intention (Venkatesh 
and Davis 2000).  
The last element of the social influence processes was image, which originated in innovation 
diffusion research by Moore and Benbasat. They define image in the sense of prestige, more 
specific as the “degree to which use of an innovation is perceived to enhance one’s … status 
in one’s social system” (Moore and Benbasat 1991, p.195). In TAM 2, image was transferred 
to the workspace context, where subjective norms set the framework for behavior being 
regarded as an upvaluation or depreciation of image in the social group. Therefore, Venkatesh 
et al. suspect subjective norms to effect image. Image, in turn, acts on perceived usefulness 
because the higher position within the group and the resulting increase of power indeed 
increases productivity. Ultimately, this complies with the definition of perceived usefulness.  
In the same line, experience mediates the influence of subjective norms. During the roll-out 
and launch phases of a new technology, half knowledge and rumors are widespread. 
Consequently, there is a higher likelihood to rely on information and evaluation of role 
models in the group. Over time, personal experience replaces the dependence on others, and 
the influence of subjective norms decreases.  
The additional cognitive instrumental processes were all drawn on research, which also 
formed the basis for the original version of TAM, and consisted of job relevance, output 
quality and result demonstrability. While the first two parameters were already introduced and 
described in earlier TAM models (Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1992), the latter is also 
derived from Moore and Benbasat, described there as “the tangibility of the results of using 
the innovation” (Moore and Benbasat 1991, p.203). A system delivering relevant output to the 
user in a non-understandable form will not reveal its usefulness, or will do so to only a limited 
degree.  
2.2.4 
Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) 
In the classification of Lee, Kozar, and Larsen (2003), the last development phase to date in 
technology acceptance research culminated in the unified approach of Venkatesh et al. (2003). 

 2.2 Theoretical bases of technology acceptance from IS research 
25
Therein, the authors propose a new, integrative model of eight previous models, including 
TRA, TPB, TAM/TAM 2 and the motivational model underlying the extension of TAM 
(Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1992). Their combined model claimed to reduce the difficulty 
of selecting the appropriate model for applied research by transferring the strengths of the 
previous models while trying to circumnavigate the respective weaknesses and limitations.  
Their proposition, called “Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology” (UTAUT), 
is depicted in Figure 7:

Intention

Expectancy
Voluntariness

Figure 7: Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (Venkatesh et al. 2003, p.447) 
In the remainder of this section, which presents the factors and key moderators of UTAUT, 
arguments and quotes are taken directly from Venkatesh et al. (2003). From an empirical 
comparison of the eight models analyzed, seven factors prove to be significant. The authors 
then hypothesize attitude toward using the technology, self-efficacy and anxiety not to be 
direct factors of intention, based on previous research results and empirical validations of 
those concepts. The remaining four factors were re-labeled to avoid connotations or 
confusions with earlier theories. In addition, gender, age, experience and voluntariness are 
expected to moderate some of the relations between factors and behavioral intention or use 
behavior.  
The most influential predictor, performance expectancy, is circumstantiated as “the degree to 
which an individual believes that using the system will help him or her to attain gains in job 
performance” (p.447). On the moderation effects, men and younger workers are expected to 
attach higher importance to performance expectancy.  
Effort expectancy is described as “as the degree of ease associated with the use of the system” 
(p.450) and is expected to be a stronger influence for women, older workers and less-
experienced persons. 
Social influence is defined as “as the degree to which an individual perceives that important 
others believe he or she should use the new system” (p.451). On the role of voluntariness, 

 2 Scoping the research focus through theoretical foundations 
26 
Venkatesh et al. (2003) find social influence to be significant only in mandatory settings, and 
especially in the early phase of usage, i.e., when experience with the system is still low. 
Furthermore, and consistent with the previous propositions, women and older workers seem 
to give more attention to other’s opinions, although this effect declines with increasing levels 
of experience. 
Finally, facilitating conditions are introduced as “the degree to which an individual believes that 
an organizational and technical infrastructure exists to support use of the system” (p.453), and 
do not influence behavioral intention, but directly become significant on use behavior. This 
effect is determined to increase with experience of the user, because only then is he able to 
fully access and leverage the support. Age is again suspected to be a positive moderator to the 
relation. 
Empirical data from a longitudinal study with a timeframe of six months and actual usage 
data from system logs are used to predict usage of web-conference video tools, database 
applications, portfolio analyzers and account systems. The findings support the hypothesis as 
described previously, with two limitations: both social influence and facilitation conditions 
become non-significant if the proposed moderators are excluded, i.e., both factors only matter 
in the respective occurrence of the moderators. For the predictive power of behavioral 
intention, UTAUT is able to exceed all of the integrated single models by explaining 70% of 
the usage intention variance. This result leads the authors to the assumption that “it is possible 
that we may be approaching the practical limits of our ability to explain individual acceptance 
and usage decisions in organizations” (Venkatesh et al. 2003, p.471). 
2.2.5 
Applications of TAM models 
As indicated earlier, the technology acceptance model was validated in many studies across 
different contexts. It seems that the TAM factors perceived usefulness and ease of use indeed 
have predictive power on system usage, which is further increased by the inclusion of 
motivational determinants. The limited number of independent variables contributed 
definitively to the success of the model by offering an “ease of application” across all kinds of 
technical systems. At the same time, the frugality of the model also triggered criticism, e.g., 
on the missing implications for the design of more acceptable systems (Schlögl 2006). A good 
overview on the major areas of progress, including representative examples and key cites, can 
be found in Venkatesh et al. (2007, p. 271). In the same publication, the authors also reference 
comprehensive meta-analyses of technology adoption research (Mahmood, Hall, and 
Swanberg 2001; Premkumar 2003). Likewise, Lee, Kozar, and Larsen (2003) review 101 
articles that include their respective reference set, and categorize the analyzed target systems 
into communication systems, general-purpose systems, office systems, and specialized 

 2.3 Theoretical bases from other relevant research streams 
27
business systems. In acknowledgement of the laborious efforts of those authors, this 
dissertation refrains from including a direct replication of the results, and instead refers the 
interested reader directly to the continuative cites listed above. 
Because UTAUT was not published until 2003, articles applying this model (Hennington and 
Janz 2007; Wang and Shih 2009) have appeared only recently, and have not been considered 
in the referenced meta-analyses. Therefore, despite the claim of Venkatesh et al., efforts have 
already been made to extend the model with further factors (Bandyopadhyay and Fraccastoro 
2007; Neufeld, Dong, and Higgins 2007).  
The theoretical base of the TAM offers a rich starting point for research in the field of 
Connected Services. But TAM does pose some shortcomings in explaining acceptance and 
usage. Some of these can be mitigated, however, through findings of other research streams, 
which are assumed to be of relevance to the field of Connected Services. Most of the concepts 
had no current linkage to the area of technology acceptance and usage, while some were 
already used in conjunction with IS literature. Some other TAM shortcomings are inherent 
and require different remedies. The necessary overall discussion of the research status quo 
follows at the end of this chapter.

Branding from marking to marketing 
The generally agreed upon definition of a brand is provided by the American Marketing 
Association (NN 2009): “A name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies 
one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers. The legal term for brand is 
trademark. A brand may identify one item, a family of items, or all items of that seller. If used 
for the firm as a whole, the preferred term is trade name.” Historically, the distinction of a 
good can be traced back to the ancient world, where archeological excavations in Pompeii 
revealed oil lamps made of clay, which were produced in numerous lots and featured the 
name of the producers on the outside of the base (Schweiger and Schrattenecker 2001). 
Schweiger and Schrattenecker also provide a definition for brands from a consumer point of 
view, as “an individual, delimitable network of associations in the heads of consumers” 
(p.78).  
The two definitions already point toward the roles of brands, which are different for 
consumers and for suppliers of products and services. Following the focus of this thesis, only 
consumer benefits from Schweiger and Schrattenecker (2001) are reviewed:

28 
 
Security and trust: strong brands are associated with implicit quality standards and 
guarantees, which secure buyers, especially if inexperienced 
 
Guidance for orientation and decision: brands represent rational and emotional 
claims or associations in the most distilled form, which in turn supports consumers in 
finding their desired attributes in the variety of products and services offered 
 
Means of self-expression: brands also convey images, which demonstrate 
consumers’ orientations and differentiates them from other groups of consumers 
The second and third features of brands require further elaboration in the context of this 
research project. Chaudhuri and Holbrook (2002) find that brand trust and brand affect are the 
intervening variables to economic outcomes like market share or the effectiveness of 
advertising budgets. In their nomenclature, brands can help customers to overcome perceived 
risks in utilitarian sense through rational features such as product performance or safety 
(brand trust), and in the hedonic sense through affective features such as status or 
compatibility with social class (brand affect). In means of communication, a unique selling 
proposition (USP) can therefore be derived from both aspects. In the context of technology 
products services, the Apple iPod makes a case in point for products and services with a 
dominance of hedonic arguments over utilitarian aspects. Apple’s marketing approach 
intended to gain prestige and desirability from the “coolness factor” of the product and its 
brand. A particularity was the success of transferring the iPod to the mass market “without 
diminishing the products’ cool factor” (Olson, Czaplewski, and Slater 2005, p.14), which 
normally runs counter to the association of coolness with exclusivity. But the real surprise 
comes from the analysis of the utilitarian side, which reveals clear deficits compared to 
offerings of competitors, as an evaluation of “the iPod phenomenon” (Reppel, Szmigin, and 
Gruber 2006) showed.  
Image as the third function of brands to consumers has already appeared in the TAM 2 model 
(Venkatesh and Davis 2000) in a workspace context. Obviously, the higher number of 
available alternatives in non-work or consumer settings further increases the importance of 
this aspect to consumers. Research even acknowledges the existence of so-called prestige-
seeking consumers, and categorizes their motivations into a framework of five types 
(addressable by marketing) related to self-consciousness and visibility of price perceptions, 
namely veblenian, snob, bandwagon, hedonist and perfectionist (Vigneron and Johnson 
1999). 
Research on branding often deals with the cross-relations of products and services, and an 
introduction to the concepts and interdependence of this research is useful. A commonly used 
construct is the family or umbrella brand, where new products or services are introduced 
under an already established brand, thereby saving market launch costs and stimulating initial 

 2.3 Theoretical bases from other relevant research streams 
29
purchases. Baiersdorf and the umbrella of Nivea represents a fast-moving consumer goods 
example for this strategy (Kotler and Bliemel 1999, p.705). When introducing a new product, 
another option lies in the “brand transfer,” which tries to leverage “spill-over effects” from the 
existing brand associations to the new product sold under the same brand. There are several 
examples of successful brand transfers, but the literature also reports cases where negative 
effects diminished the core product (Kotler and Bliemel 1999, p.709). Consequently, single 
products or service can take the role of “brand shapers,” defined as the capability to develop 
covetousness, establish emotional connections, comprehensively represent the brand, and 
therefore positively charge the brand (Wichert 2005). In the (German) automotive context, 
vehicle models such as the Mercedes SL class, the Volkswagen Golf or the BMW 7 series do 
fulfill this role of a brand shaper, and thereby positively contribute to the image of the OEM 
brand (Burkhardt 2006). In the technology acceptance setting, the question arises as to 
whether innovations can fulfill the same brand shaper function, or at least positively 
contribute to brands. Aaker (2007) arrives at the conclusion that innovations deserve and even 
require branding: “When a transformational innovation that creates a new subcategory is 
involved, a brand can help to define, position, and dominate that new subcategory,” and, even 
more important in the context of this research, “in addition, a strong branded innovation can 
affect the reputation of the parent organizational brand” (p.23). An example cited by Aaker is 
IBM and the introduction of the ThinkPad brand which, despite being a small part of the IBM 
product and service portfolio, increased the overall IBM brand. Finally, customers are capable 
of separating their satisfaction with dealer interaction from satisfaction with the vehicle itself 
(Herrmann et al. 2007) and, contrary to a common belief in the automotive industry, do 
indeed evaluate the dealer and the OEM brand as a separate entities (Huber and Herrmann 
2001). Transferred to the branding aspect, this challenges the possibilities of a positive spill-
over effect from the OEM brand to other aspects associated with, but distinct from, the 
product itself. On the other hand, the risks of negative transfers seem also to be limited in the 
case of critical incidents.  
On the economic effects of branding, two aspects on brand loyalty close this section: On the 
one hand, “unshared brand loyalty” refers to the optimum state of a consumer drawing all re-
purchases from the same brand, whereas consumers fulfilling “shared brand loyalty” 
continuously distribute their spending across a limited set of brands (Schweiger and 
Schrattenecker 2001). On the other hand, brand loyalty also increases the potential of cross-
promotions and, ultimately, of cross-selling through higher levels of brand trust (Chaudhuri 
and Holbrook 2001b).

2.3.2 
Hedonic and utilitarian usage motivations 
The previous section has shown that consumers benefit from brands in their aggregation of 
several rational and/or emotional attributes into one single denominator. Those categories of 
product and service attributes can also be mapped on utilitarian and hedonic motivations, 
which have consequences on technology acceptance and loyalty.  
The term “hedonic consumption” dates back to two articles published in 1982 (Hirschman 
and Holbrook 1982; Holbrook and Hirschman 1982), where this concept is described as 
“those facets of consumer behavior that relate to the multi-sensory, fantasy and emotive 
aspects of one's experience with products” (Hirschman and Holbrook 1982, p.92). In other 
words, and in the context of technology acceptance, van der Heijden explains the value of 
hedonic systems as “a function to the degree the user experiences fun when using the system 
(van der Heijden 2004, p.696). Two further articles (Hirschman and Stern 1999; Holbrook et 
al. 1984) elaborate the idea of extending consumers’ motivations beyond the cognitive aspects 
traditionally employed in marketing sciences.  
Childers et al. (2001) first applies the idea of hedonic and utilitarian settings to the technology 
acceptance research. In two studies on e-commerce, they found enjoyment to be a strong and 
constant factor for attitude toward online shopping. Nevertheless, this factor tended to be 
stronger for hedonic websites, while consumers were more strongly influenced by perceived 
usefulness for the usage of utilitarian websites. Van der Heijden (2004) replicates the result 
with another study on hedonic websites and found perceived enjoyment to be the strongest 
determinant, followed by perceived ease of use, and only then perceived usefulness. While 
additional publications appeared in similar hedonic settings such as online apparel shopping 
(Kim and Sandra 2007) and online ticket shopping (Cyr et al. 2007) with comparable 
outcomes, an analysis by Chitturi, Raghunathan, and Mahajan (2008) makes interesting 
contributions in relation to different effects on satisfaction and loyalty derived from utilitarian 
and hedonic expectations.  
Their research extended the timeframe considered from technology acceptance to usage, and 
yet further to the point of repurchase. In the pre-consumption decision, earlier research 
outcomes are quoted which show the greater importance of hedonic demands, if the hygienic 
role of utilitarian needs is satisfied, i.e., if a certain level of functionality is reached. Chitturi, 
Raghunathan, and Mahajan then concentrated on the post-consumption phase through a 
survey on owners and users of cell phones, laptops and cars, who were familiar with the 
attributes and benefits of the products. The authors find that satisfaction (or anger) is caused 
by the fulfillment (or non-compliance) of utilitarian, preventive goals such as a car that 
features anti-lock brakes and vehicle stability assist. The respective antecedents of satisfaction 
are confidence and security. However, delight (or dissatisfaction) is associated with the 

 2.3 Theoretical bases from other relevant research streams 
31
expectations met (or missed) on hedonic, promotion goals such as a car with a sunroof or a 
high-quality audio system. Here, cheerfulness and excitement determine promotion emotions. 
Finally, their empirical results reveal that “delighting customers improves customer loyalty as 
measured by word-of-mouth and repurchase intent compared to merely satisfying them” 
(Chitturi, Raghunathan, and Mahajan 2008, p.48). 
The importance of emotions, especially for the evaluation and the early phase of innovations, 
was also confirmed in an analysis by Wood and Moreau (2006). Their results show that 
emotions influence customers’ notions of the initial experience of new products or services, 
and are not reflected in considerations of the rational benefits. This also holds true for the 
notion of pricing fairness.  
2.3.3 
Pricing transparency and fairness 
A pragmatic taxonomy of bundling variants (Rickard 2008) structures the following review of 
the research on pricing that is relevant to the context of Connected Services: 
 
Bundling of products with after-sales services (e.g., cars with maintenance services) 
 
Bundling of products with parts or consumables (e.g., cars with gas vouchers) 
 
Bundling of products with complementary products (e.g., cars with winter tires) 
 
Bundling of products with alternative products or services (e.g., online shops 
offering express or economical shipping) 
The classification of Connected Services into the first category already indicates two pricing 
issues, namely the idiosyncrasies of pricing services (versus goods) on the one hand, and 
pricing bundles on the other hand. Research on the concept of pricing fairness in relation to 
consumer evaluations and loyalty is another area of consideration.  
In the long tradition of research on marketing in general, and on pricing in particular, almost 
every article in this field implicitly assumes a focus on tangible goods. In one of the first 
articles on pricing of services, Schlissel and Chasin (1991) find only two articles preceding 
their own research in 1977 and 1985. Interestingly, three years later a publication by Simon 
(1994) appears on pricing in the specific context of industrial services, where the B2B setting 
and common (business) sense reinforces customers’ prevalent notion of services being free or 
included in the base price. Some of the specifics for service pricing found by the author arise 
from the characteristics of services: intangibility hinders quality tests or impressions before 
the purchase, which increases the role of price as a quality indicator. Perishability fosters the 
implementation of temporal or spatial price differentiation because customers cannot buy 
services on stock or source them from far away, at least in the time before Connected 
Services. Based on non-transferability of services, price differentiation by customer and the 

 2 Scoping the research focus through theoretical foundations 
32 
control of bulk discount is fostered. As well, services are very often complementary goods to 
a core product. While the total cost of ownership (TCO) view has become widely known and 
marketed in recent years, pricing elasticity (i.e., the response of demand to price changes) is 
often lower for corresponding services (Simon 1994). Simon also laments the missing 
professionalism in pricing which does not match its significance in the economy, or for most 
companies. Tung and Capella (1997) try to provide an answer by adapting and synthesizing 
classical pricing approaches to the service setting, and argue for a price corridor based on a 
cost-plus price on the lower end and a “market premium service price” on the upper end. In 
more recent years, researchers seem to acknowledge the differences in pricing of goods and 
services, and have moved on to the elaboration phase (Avlonitis and Indounas 2007; Danaher 
2002; Docters et al. 2004; Lee, Yu, and Kim 2006). 
With regard to the progress on bundling, a variety of researchers have worked on the pricing 
theme. Literature on the first category of the taxonomy (from the beginning of this section) is 
less prevalent, as Bharadwaj and Ter Hofstede note in their introduction (Bharadwaj and Ter 
Hofstede 2006). They found that profitability for what they call “augmented products” could 
be increased by two strategies: first, integration, i.e., the conjoint development of prices for 
products and services, and/or second, customization, i.e., customer- (group-) specific pricing. 
Important to durable customer relationships, a “service transfer effect, in which previous 
service sales impact future product purchases” was confirmed, which is especially recognized 
because “supplementary services can provide the basis for differentiation as products have 
become increasingly commoditized” (Bharadwaj and Ter Hofstede 2006, p.22). Though not 
specific to services, an article by Naylor and Frank (2001) examines the effect of price 
bundling on the perception of overall value. Their results suggest that customers accepting the 
offering for the first time, and only those customers, do indeed favor bundled prices and 
dislike the segregation of prices to different points of time, which is consistent with findings 
of Johnson, Herrman, and Bauer (1999) based on the principles of mental accounting4. The 
outcomes of Naylor and Frank, therefore, suggest the considerable role of pricing for 
customers to be able to evaluate and finally accept offerings of any kind, including 
technology-based products and services.  
The concept of price fairness is also significant to this study. As Nagle and Holden (2002) 
state, the concept bedeviled marketers for ages’ as early as the Dark Ages, “merchants were 
                                                 
4 The concept was first named in the work of Thaler, Richard (1980) "Towards a positive theory of consumer choice,” 
Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 1, p.39-60. The mental accounting principles suggest that overall value 
perceived by consumers is enhanced when benefits are separated or communicated separately, while disadvantages (e.g. 
costs) should be integrated. Johnson et al. (1998) provides further research on this topic. 

 2.3 Theoretical bases from other relevant research streams

put to death for exceeding public norms regarding the ‘just price’” (p.97). Today, fairness has 
been described as “a judgment of whether an outcome and/or the process to reach an outcome 
are reasonable, acceptable, or just” (Xia, Monroe, and Cox 2004, p.1). But the authors 
immediately note that price evaluations in general, including price fairness, are comparative 
and subjective, and can also be based on non-cognitive elements. They therefore propose a 
price fairness definition as “a consumer’s assessment and associated motions of whether the 
difference (or lack of difference) between a seller’s price and the price of a comparative other 
party is reasonable, acceptable, or justifiable” (p.3). As antecedents, Xia, Monroe, and Cox 
propose customers’ comparative perception and the degree of customers’ trust of the 
company, as an end in itself but also as an approximation for the (in-) equality of cost-profit 
distribution. In addition, social norms and metaknowledge about the marketplace influence 
customers’ perception. In a subsequent publication, Hermann et al. (2007) analyze and 
empirically validate the influence of price fairness on customer satisfaction, besides a direct 
influence of price perceptions per se (as well as the experience with the product itself and the 
dealer). In their framework, price fairness is determined by procedural and distributive 
components, which are correlated but distinct. While distributive fairness relates to the 
outcome, e.g., a (perceived) good price for a car, procedural fairness is formed on the way to 
the result, e.g., by transparent and complete information of the sales representative for options 
and discounts that constitute the final quote. With regard to the procedural fairness, product 
familiarity or experience seems to have a similar moderating role, as with price bundling. 
Shehryar and Hunt (2005) find that unfamiliar users look more closely at procedural fairness 
than do familiar users in order to back up their purchasing intention. An, users not 
experienced with the product (class) also take procedural price fairness as a proxy for 
perceived quality.  
2.3.4 
Loyalty as a potential outcome of usage  
The introduced technology acceptance and usage models all define usage or usage intention as 
their dependent variable. No model captures the consequences of usage or non-usage in a 
wider, economic context. Because this research project aims at a holistic analysis, the concept 
of loyalty is established in conjunction with technology acceptance and usage. Inherently, 
loyalty can only take place once a consumer accepted a product or service and has become a 
customer, or in the nomenclature of this thesis, a user. Despite the label, a user does not 
necessarily show active usage.  
Loyalty refers to a customer who generally wants to remain with a specific product, service, 
or more abstractly, with the product or OEM brand. In a classical definition, brand loyalty is 
"(1) the biased (i.e., nonrandom) (2) behavioral response (i.e., purchase) (3) expressed over 

 2 Scoping the research focus through theoretical foundations 
34 
time (4) by some decision-making unit (5) with respect to one or more alternative brands out 
of a set of such brands and (6) is a function of psychological (decision-making, evaluative) 
process" (Jacoby and Chestnut 1978, p.2). As Shoemaker (2003) reflects, loyalty is viewed in 
research from an emotional side or a behavioral side of the customer, or from both. The 
author quotes Shoemaker and Lewis (1999) with a definition from the emotional side: “the 
customer feels so strongly that you can best meet his or her relevant needs that your 
competition is virtually excluded from the consideration set and the customer buys almost 
exclusively from you” (Shoemaker 2003, p.272). 
From an economical perspective, the “reason why” for loyalty is commonly clear, because 
“the best customers, we're told, are loyal ones. They cost less to serve, they're usually willing 
to pay more than other customers, and they often act as word-of-mouth marketers for your 
company. Win loyalty, therefore, and profits will follow as night follows day” (Reinartz and 
Kumar 2002). As a side note, and as implicitly stated in the definition, the empirical findings 
of Reinartz and Kumar challenge or restrict the relationship from loyalty to profitability. They 
argue for disaggregating “the” customer into four groups along the axes of loyalty and 
profitability, and call for practitioners to prioritize their efforts on the correct customer group. 
Besides this outcome, the general notion is still well accepted and the role of loyalty has 
become even more critical to innovative (and mostly technological) products and services 
which rely on network effects. When the value of the product or service increases for 
everybody along the number of the users, and when the market diffusion relies on innovators 
and early adopters as multiplicators, the “true value of a lost customer” (Hogan, Lemon, and 
Libai 2003) is even higher. Hogan, Lemon and Libai clearly demonstrate that the common 
notion of lost future revenues from a defected or disadopted customer only accounts for the 
direct effects, and overlooks the indirect effect of lost future effects from word of mouth, 
imitations and other social effects.  
On the key drivers of customer loyalty, Parasuraman and Grewal (2000) trace the antecedents 
back to three main constructs, as displayed in Figure 8:  
Product Quality
Perceived Value
Customer Loyalty
Service Quality
Price
 
Figure 8: Key drivers of customer loyalty (Parasuraman and Grewal 2000, p.169) 

 2.4 Critical gaps in the literature and the need for further research 
35
The validity of this notion is also confirmed – with perceived value replaced by the term 
satisfaction – in the (price-focused) research results of Hermann et al. (2007). Wangenheim 
and Bayon (2007) analyze the chain even further, with customer satisfaction as the starting 
point for loyalty expressed through word-of-mouth referral behavior. Word-of-mouth then 
leads to the acquisition of new customers. In this work, the authors also conclude that 
satisfaction and (service) quality will ultimately increase profitability. In the automotive 
context, another study of Huber and Hermann demonstrates that “customer satisfaction can be 
considered the central determinant in all phases of the contact chain” (Huber and Herrmann 
2001, p.117). Satisfaction, in turn, is defined as “the result of an evaluation process 
comparing the difference between the service the individual expect and the actual service they 
perceive they have received” (p.99). Once more, the literature is not clear about whether 
satisfaction is derived more strongly from cognitive or from emotional aspects, though there 
is a tendency toward the latter. Along the generic automotive buyer life cycle, satisfaction can 
appear during the pre-purchasing, purchasing, product and after-sales stage, although 
empirical data declines the effect of pre-purchasing satisfaction on customer loyalty (Huber 
and Herrmann 2001). Therefore, their model focuses on product, dealer and complaint 
satisfaction for determining (OEM) brand and dealer loyalty. It is not surprising, then, that 
Bolton (1998) finds satisfaction and price to be major determinants of contract length. 
In any case, satisfaction is not easily achieved, especially in the context of technologies, as 
“ensuring customer satisfaction is a more weighty challenge for a technology-based product 
or service. Once consumers adopt, they must grapple with an unfamiliar and often more 
complex approach to satisfying their needs. Customers of technology-based offerings require 
education and support.” (Parasuraman and Colby 2001, p.7) 
Hogan and Lemon (2003, p.205) articulate a critical summary of the status quo and the need 
for further research, because “results suggest that investing additional resources early on in 
the product life cycle in programs designed to facilitate consumers’ use and acceptance of 
technological innovations that have been incorporated into the product or purchase experience 
and investing in postpurchase customer service could lead to improvements in overall firm 
profitability.” 
2.4 
Critical gaps in the literature and the need for further research  
Roughly two decades after research on technology acceptance became a key research stream 
within information systems research, a special issue with the title “Quo Vadis TAM” 
appeared in the Journal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS) in 2007. Despite 
the intentionally provocative title and a call for controversial papers, three articles raised 
questions and limitations.  

 2 Scoping the research focus through theoretical foundations 
36 
The main argument in the article of Benbasat and Barki (2007) lies in the deep reliance and 
continuance of the research stream on one single line of argument, thereby creating an 
“illusion of cumulative tradition” (p.213). Too much focus and replication of the models has 
diverted researchers’ focus from other alternative models. The authors therefore propose a 
return to origins of the model, namely TRA and the extension TPB, and a need for research at 
different temporal stages of acceptance and usage. Two further propositions are made in 
Goodhue’s (2007) commentary on this article. While he generally defends the progress made 
to date as important contributions, the question of “what is usefulness” and “how should it be 
conceptualized or measured” are acknowledged as two areas for improvement. Although this 
issue has also been recognized in the development of TAM 2 (Venkatesh and Davis 2000), 
Goodhue argues for the use of the task-technology fit (Goodhue and Thompson 1995), which 
aims at the more general dependent variable of user performance instead of technology usage 
as an end in itself. A different article in this special issue by Straub and Burton-Jones (2007) 
raises the question of “common method bias” – I will elaborate this point at the end of this 
section as a methodological gap in the existing literature. A last point taken from Benbasat 
and Barki (2007) constitutes the status quo of the TAM research in the continued reliance on 
the roots of the first articles, namely IT systems in an organizational setting, while the type 
and form of IT applications – and inherently also their use – has changed over time. 
Technification in the workspace, but especially in non-business contexts, requires adaptation 
and the integration of new concepts. Consequently, aspects which relate to the specifics of 
consumer technology applications must be considered. 
Mick and Fournier (1998) find that consumers can face the interesting notion of technology 
paradoxes when using technologies. While they report a total of eight paradoxes, the paradox 
of freedom/enslavement illustrates the concept in the context of Email: in the workspace, this 
means of communication offers the potential for fast, inexpensive and always accessible 
collaboration. At the same time, users can also feel restrained by the technology, due to the 
(perceived) need to be constantly available and to answer requests immediately. Along all 
technology paradoxes, users or potential customers might, therefore, have conflicting views 
on the usefulness and disadvantages of the technology, which – contrary to traditional view of 
the “homo oeconomicus” and the cost/benefit paradigm – are not netted but coexist in 
parallel.  
The concept of considering consumers not always (only) behaving on rational motivations has 
also captured other research disciplines. While common in the marketing literature, the 
application in areas such as economics is a new but enriching approach (Cox 2005). In Cox’s 
viewpoint, the contribution lies in a diversity of approaches, which ultimately leads to 
understanding consumer behavior – in his context, in terms of pricing. With regard to the 
research on technology acceptance and usage, several factors have been introduced and tested. 

 2.4 Critical gaps in the literature and the need for further research 
37
Despite the original notion of perceived enjoyment (as one determinant) that was set in a 
workspace context (Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1992), most subsequent TAM applications 
and extensions focused on inherently hedonic settings such as mobile video games (Okazaki, 
Skapa, and Grande 2007), MMS (Lee, Cheung, and Zhaohui 2007) or online apparel shopping 
(Kim and Sandra 2007). Consequently, research in mixed settings of applications serving both 
utilitarian and hedonic needs seems a promising yet untapped area of focus. 
Setting the focus on the B2C context also reveals further arguments for investing effort in this 
area. While TAM and its variants provide an excellent starting point, I argue for the need to 
integrate undervalued or new factors from other disciplines in order to consider the 
idiosyncrasies of Connected Services applications, a notion also supported by the findings of 
Baron, Patterson, and Harris (2006) on understanding consumer practice. For the sake of 
completeness, the TPB model can also be leveraged, although the concepts of habits and 
emotions are not considered therein (Benbasat and Barki 2007). Returning to the proposed 
extensions in the consumer setting, I call for the following four ideas to be scrutinized: first, 
the holistic integration of hedonic consumer motivations from an intrinsic view (perceived 
enjoyment) but also from an extrinsic perspective (image or prestige); second, the analysis of 
brand influences, when deciding or declining specific technology-based offerings; third, the 
inclusion of pricing fairness as a factor for consumer’s evaluation; and fourth, risks and 
disadvantages, which should be regarded as different constructs. Finally, a scientific view on 
B2C applications in the field of Connected Services has not taken place at all, at least in the 
subset of remote services, and especially not in the automotive context. 
As already remarked, there is also a significant methodological issue to be addressed in 
consecutive work on technology acceptance and usage, namely common method bias. As 
early as 1986 Podsakoff and Organ (1986) conclude that several problems are associated with 
the commonly applied, self-reported usage in organizational and management research, such 
as common method variance, consistency motif, and social desirability. As an example in the 
TAM setting, a user as a respondent is asked about the usefulness of the IT system evaluated 
(independent variable). Only afterwards is the user probed about the usage behavior (intention 
or previous usage level), resulting in high cognitive dissonance if not compatible with the 
evaluation made just before. Consequently, a system assessed not to be useful will not be used 
by a reasonable person, or at least will this person not claim to do so (Straub Jr. and Burton-
Jones 2007).  
Szajna’s empirical validation of a revised TAM model further emphasizes the risk of common 
method bias, because “the results from this research discourage the substitution of self-report 
usage for actual usage” (Szajna 1996, p.91). Interestingly, Venkatesh et al. (2003) do not 
highlight the fact that their empirical data is drawn from computer log files, thereby 

 2 Scoping the research focus through theoretical foundations 
38 
overcoming the common method bias risk. On the contrary, they state only that “the role of 
intention as a predictor of behavior (e.g., usage) is critical and has been well-established in IS 
and the reference disciplines” (p.427), without referencing the potential but inherent 
challenges when self-reported usage and intention are used. But Straub Jr. and Burton-Jones 
allude to the meta-analysis of Lee, Kozar and Larsen (2003) which concludes “that self-
reported usage is the most critical limitation of TAM studies” (Straub Jr. and Burton-Jones 
2007, p.225). In addition, Straub Jr. and Burton-Jones report on the outcome of another meta-
analysis on TAM studies by Sharma, Yetton, and Crawford (2004), which reveals 
significantly weaker linkages in those studies leveraging actual usage data, compared to the 
group of studies relying on self-reports. In conclusion, they found common method variance 
to account for 27% of the variance in TAM and that “relationships between PU and Use and 
between Intention to Use and Use are significant and strong only when the variables are 
measured with the same method over all the studies examined; these relationships were 
insignificant when the variables were measured with different methods” (Straub Jr. and 
Burton-Jones 2007, p.225). To give a full view, the authors cite another recent article by 
Malhotra, Kim, and Patil (2006) which claims that common method variance reduces 
correlations by only 6 percent, but at the same time the authors question their methodological 
approach as associated with conceptual and empirical problems.  
Overall, I follow the proposal of Straub Jr. and Burton-Jones on using different measurement 
methods for independent and dependent variables which completely control common method 
variance. Despite acknowledging their cautionary note that a systematic devaluation of the 
true effects might result from the specific problems of each method that can sometimes 
intensify rather than counterbalance the effects (Straub Jr. and Burton-Jones 2007, p.226), I 
am convinced that more research based on actual usage data will contribute to this issue and 
to the progress of TAM research in general. 
This critical acclaim of the status quo demonstrates the existence of research gaps, which this 
thesis intends to address. Nevertheless, the widely unexplored field of Connected Services 
makes an explorative, qualitative approach a necessary prerequisite for sound research results. 
Only then, and in the synthesis of findings from previous research (as discussed in this 
chapter) with implications from primary research on the specific research scope (as 
introduced in the next chapter), are concrete hypotheses generated.

3.1 
Research design of the qualitative aspects 
At present, academic research in the area of Connected Services is scarce (Holtbrügge, 
Holzmüller, and von Wangenheim 2007) and does not exist at all in the automotive context. 
This makes an initial explorative research stage indispensable in order to both qualify the 
adaptation of existing methods and outcomes, and also to justify the need to create new 
concepts. The exploratory, qualitative research is mainly founded on the pillars of expert 
interviews and call listening in customer interaction center5.  
A total of 18 interviews were conducted in summer and fall of 2007. They were carried out as 
semi-structured, open-ended interviews based on an interview guideline, and lasted between 
one and two hours. All interview partners granted permission to record the conversations, but 
not for transcriptions, by mutual consent of confidentiality. Therefore, the recording was used 
to review the interview notes and to collect quotes. Eleven interview partners came from 
across all business units and functions that were working on Connected Services at our 
partner OEM, including management, marketing and sales, product development and 
research. Another 6 interviews were conducted with car dealers of our partner OEM in 
Germany that were selling the already marketed services. Finally, one telephone interview 
was conducted with the manager of the support team of a telematics service provider for 
commercial vehicles.  
Two call listening sessions at different times of the day were conducted to get to know the 
customer in real use-case scenarios. One session took place in the inbound customer care unit, 
supporting existing and prospective customers of Connected Services. Requests included 
product information, billing and activation, as well as technical issues. In the second session, 
an outbound call project was performed to reach customers who had recently acquired their 
vehicles but had not yet activated the services. The aim of this project was to provide 
information on the product and to support customers on the activation process.  
Before describing the results of the qualitative research in the form of three case studies, the 
next section highlights the particularities of the automotive industry for consumers and 
thereby OEMs. 
                                                 
5 Obviously, the work on several projects in the area of Connected Services during my time in the PhD program at the partner 
OEM also contributed to this research project. The experience from this time generated additional information and was 
especially valuable for the generation and first evaluation of hypothesis.

3.2 
Automotive industry as research object 
While this chapter centers on the research focus within the automotive industry, a 
comparative review of the consumer electronics industry reveals several common 
characteristics and developments for technology acceptance. This already hints toward the 
validity of a generalization from the research object to other areas fulfilling the subsequent 
attributes. For the following section, the term OEM refers to companies in both automotive 
and consumer electronics space, where consumer electronics for this analysis also includes 
products and services from information and communication technology (ICT) such as 
notebook and handheld computers, and mobile phones.  
At the very beginning, customers have to face an increasing level of complexity through 
technologies, but also must cope with the ever increasing pace of such innovations. While it 
took more than 38 and 13 years to establish 50 million users of radio and television, 
respectively, the Internet surpassed this threshold within only 5 years (BCG 2000). This 
development is, of course, not limited to the OEMs in scope, but affects them significantly 
and in a way which is highly visible to their consumers. The increasing pace of progress is 
also depicted by the shortening lifecycles of vehicles, from roughly 10 years in the 1980s to 
only 6 years in the 2000s (Dannenberg 2005, p.37)  
Another characteristic trait of both industries lies in the product features: while there is 
definitely competition on innovation in every new generation, the implementation and quality 
of their core functionalities is coming closer across competitors. As a result, the USP is only 
seldom derived from core product features. This is both caused by, but also spurring, another 
conjoint development, namely the reduction in depth of added value. Especially in 
development and production, companies are increasingly outsourcing their activities. Because 
there are very often oligopoly market structures along the suppliers, competitive products 
feature the same technology and parts underneath. While the technical details are not known 
by most customers and seldom of interest to them, it makes the choice of the right product an 
even more demanding process. As a consequence, companies are increasingly concentrating 
their value chain activities on branding and customer management. In the same line, services 
do also serve as a differentiation from other, similar (hardware) products (Bharadwaj and Ter 
Hofstede 2006). Besides, companies are adapting standardized parts, software and 
technologies to their (customers’) needs, e.g., in the brand- or model-specific chassis setup of 
a vehicle build on standard parts or on platform components. While an average of 35% of the 
value chain remains with the automotive OEMs today, the share is expected to fall further to 
22% by 2015 (Gottschalk, Kalmbach, and Dannenberg 2005), and the example of “badging” 
shows that the trend can indeed be further continued. In this form of cooperation between two 
or more OEMs, vehicles such as the Toyota Aygo, the Citroen C1 and the Peugeot 107 are 

 3.2 Automotive industry as research object 
41
produced in the same plant and are only differentiated by the brand elements like logos and 
minor design modifications on the front and rear bumpers.  
As indicated, product and service choices of customers are more than ever influenced by 
brands and emotions. While product performance is still fundamental, it is sometimes reduced 
to a hygienic factor, and OEMs – and in the end consumers also – focus less on purely 
rational attributes. In other words, the selection and also the final purchase decision is often 
highly irrational, as one of the interview partners cites in an example of a premium 
automotive buyer: “The last time he was at the service counter of his Mercedes dealership, 
they did not offer him coffee while he waited. The next time he became a BMW customer.”  
From a different angle, (corporate) architecture also highlights the similar constellation in 
automotive and consumer electronics industries: Apple or Sony, for example, introduce their 
flagship store concept all over the world and transform shops from simple point-of-sales to 
brand orchestrations and customer experience worlds. Naturally, the target groups are not 
only first buyers of their brand but are also returning loyal customers and visitors who are not 
yet planning to make a purchase. The automotive OEMs pursue similar intentions, and recent 
projects such as the “Autostadt” of Volkswagen in Wolfsburg, the “BMW World” in Munich 
or the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart show the importance OEMs place on such brand 
moderators.  
As a consequence of the trends described before – increasing product complexity, converging 
product USPs across competitors, a strengthened role of brands and emotions – OEMs are 
also extending their business scope from hardware to software and from products to services. 
This transformation acknowledges the importance of remaining in touch with the customer 
after (and also before) the initial purchase. Three examples document this mutuality across 
industries. First, Apple’s synthesis of audio/video-players (iPod) and a music sales platform 
(iTunes) represents a perfect eco-system where users move seamlessly from one purchase and 
touchpoint with Apple to the next. As long as iTunes was limited to the Mac world, the power 
of this continuous customer contact system was even stronger and was also perceived as a 
benefit by the users because no (in-) compatibility issues arose with other systems or devices. 
As a second example, gaming consoles like the Sony Playstation 3 also feature Internet access 
through their devices. But besides the pure additional product feature, this infrastructure 
allows for the establishment of (Sony) user communities and finally, a gateway to customers’ 
wallet with opportunities ranging from subscriptions to online gaming. As a third example, 
automotive OEMs have started to offer all-in leasing contracts through their own financial 
services departments, where monthly payments cover the leasing rate for the vehicle but also 
include insurance, taxes and all maintenance costs (besides fuel). Customers, and especially 

 3 Experiencing Connected Services in the automotive industry 
42 
businesses, benefit from a clear calculation base. OEMs not only secure additional parts of the 
downstream business, but also increase the likelihood for additional customer touchpoints.  
Deliberating the intention of OEMs on the number of customer interactions actually reveals 
an urgent need for action: Three aspects brought the number of average customer touchpoints 
over the vehicle-life cycle down to about 1.3 per year (Brandt, Spengel, and Schnurrer 2005, 
p.89). First, as one car dealer and service workshop owner explains, “vehicles are constantly 
getting better and require less visits at the repair shop – which is bad for those who want to 
sell new cars” (Wilhelm 2008). Second, individuals are increasingly price-sensitive and bring 
their cars to third-party repair shops, especially after the warranty period of new vehicles has 
ended. Third, the average age of vehicles on the road is also on the rise, i.e., people postpone 
the purchase decision to a later point in time. Looking at Germany, the average age of 
passenger cars has climbed from 6.3 in 1990 to 6.9 in 2000, and reached 8.1 years in 2007 
(Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt 2008). Overall, there are several good reasons for automotive OEMs 
to manage, optimize and leverage their customer relationships, and for research to contribute 
to this topic. 
A last distinctiveness of the automotive industry is the intensity of the relationship of the 
consumers to their object of desire. No other producer of durable good is able to catch the 
same level of attraction, involvement and very often emotions in the mind of customers. 
Obviously, when it comes to design evaluations, personal likes or dislikes play an important 
role for the judgment of favor or disfavor, but even measurable product features are not free 
from beliefs, brands and even prejudices, as Gottschalk explains in the preface of a book on 
brand management in the automotive industry, quoting Friedrich Schiller’s “encounter with 
the form” as the first interaction with a vehicle for almost all consumers (Gottschalk, 
Kalmbach, and Dannenberg 2005, p.19).  
Understandably, the marketing and sales process meets a challenge to merge all those 
customer traits with economic calculations and requirements of customer relationship 
management. But the next sections first cover the case studies of Connected Services in the 
automotive industry, only then followed by an excerpt on the marketing and sales challenge to 
pave the way for consumers to move from understanding to finally accepting sophisticated, 
technology-enabled products and services like Connected Services. 
3.3 
Case study BMW ConnectedDrive 
The telematic offering of BMW named “ConnectedDrive” refers to the status in September 
2007, which is covered in the interview and survey period. Screenshots shown in this section 
therefore also refer to the MMI (Man Machine Interface) before the latest relaunch in 
September 2008.  

 3.3 Case study BMW ConnectedDrive

3.3.1 
Product offering 
The product offering in Germany under the name BMW ConnectedDrive (here abbreviated 
with BCD) consists of the three clusters: BMW Assist, BMW Online, and BMW TeleServices 
(which is dealt with as a separate case study in the next section). The summaries of the main 
features of the services within each cluster can be extended through further information at the 
website: http://www.bmw.de/connecteddrive 
BMW Assist is focused around voice-based services such as automatic and manual 
emergency calls, where a collision-detector or the manual push of the SOS button (for getting 
help for other motorists) (Figure 9) sends the exact position of the vehicle to an emergency 
center and establishes a voice connection. If necessary, relief units are dispatched by the agent 
in the emergency center, based on the current GPS position of the vehicle. Roadside 
assistance (breakdown call) and a concierge services are leveraging the same technology and 
offer information such as directory assistance, restaurant rankings or table reservations 
(information call). Found contact data (or already known addresses) are then sent into the 
vehicle to allow direct navigation to the address, or calling the phone number without the 
need to re-enter the data. This feature is also available through Google Maps (see 
http://maps.google.de), where found addresses can then directly “send to vehicle” and be used 
as input for navigation or telephone of the vehicle. Furthermore, BMW Assist includes traffic 
information data that is more accurate and has higher coverage than the freely available TMC 
service.  
 
Figure 9: SOS button of BMW Assist 
BMW Online is an information portal in the vehicle, accessed via online connection, iDrive 
controller and a browser in the central information display. For a better understanding, Figure 
10 presents a screenshot from the central information display in the vehicle. The portal offers 
driving-related content such as weather reports, news, available parking spots, ski webcams, 
an Email and contact book client, and a yellow pages search via Google Local Search. Again, 

 3 Experiencing Connected Services in the automotive industry 
44 
found contact data can be used directly as an input for the navigation system or the telephone 
unit. Most information is available through both channels, BMW Assist and BMW Online, to 
serve different customer needs or use cases. While some customers prefer to find an address 
on their own through the browser, others (or in other situations) favor calling an agent to find 
and send exactly the same data.  
 
Figure 10: Screenshot of BMW Online in the vehicle  
BMW TeleServices features the transmission of vehicle diagnosis data to the dealership, 
which allows for a better preparation in advance through less diagnosis time and earlier 
availability of required spare parts. The transmission starts automatically, if the need for 
maintenance (e.g., an oil change or replacement of breaking pads) is recognized by the 
vehicle. The dealer then calls the owner of the vehicle to make an appointment. In breakdown 
situations this features also allows for a more accurate remote diagnosis or even remote repair 
for some electronic faults. BMW TeleServices (discussed in a separate case study) currently 
belongs to the service portfolio of BMW ConnectedDrive. 
All services use a "Telematics Control Unit" (TCU) representing an internal mobile phone 
including a personal SIM card, and a GPS receiver. Therefore, all services are available 
independent of a customer mobile phone, which is especially important for emergency calls, 
but also allows for all communication costs to be charged directly to BMW. Only Volvo also 
offered a comparable, autonomously working solution in Europe at the time of the research 
study – all other competitors required a customer mobile phone or a customer SIM card to be 
installed before the system could be used. (For a more detailed description of the technical 
architecture see Appendix 4.)  
Besides being accessible in the vehicle, most services and content are also available through 
an internet portal. Customers of BCD can log into the portal and search for POIs, send contact 
information into their vehicles or synchronize their address books. In addition, some services 
are also offered through a mobile phone, e.g., by sending a map with the vehicle parking 
position to the personal mobile.  

 3.3 Case study BMW ConnectedDrive

Operations are handled by Telematic Service Providers (TSP), mobile network operators and 
content providers as partners of BMW. Those companies are responsible for the back-end 
infrastructure, i.e., servers, mobile network, call centers, and the end-stage information 
provided through BMW Assist and Online. Still, a whole team at BMW is working on the 
integration and monitoring of partners, product development and customer handling 
operations such as activation, billing, de-activation of accounts, hotlines, and complaint 
management.  
The product offering strategy for BMW ConnectedDrive in Germany changed in September 
2007, making BCD available at different (hardware) price levels across the whole vehicle 
portfolio. Until then, the services were only offered as options to the customer as a bundle of 
navigation system professional, handsfree set and voice control at a price of roughly EUR 
4,000. BMW Assist was then included with a trial period of 6 months, at a cost of EUR 175 
per year thereafter. BMW Online was additionally available as an option for EUR 250, also 
including a 6- month trial period and EUR 175 cost per year afterwards.  
Since September 2007 all BMW ConnectedDrive services are always included when the 
vehicle is equipped with one of the two navigation systems (Business and Professional) and a 
handsfree set (options for a total of ca. EUR 3,000 and 4,000). The bundle includes BMW 
Assist, Online and TeleServices, with a free trial period of 6 and 36 months respectively and a 
yearly renewal fee of EUR 250 thereafter. In addition, an entry solution option at ca. EUR 
800 was introduced with a handsfree set and BMW Assist services only (with a trial period of 
also 6 months and a yearly rate of EUR 175). The new strategy is regarded to be less complex 
and more transparent for customers, and matches the product offering strategy in other 
markets.  
3.3.2 
Development within the telematics market 
In 1993 BMW introduced the new 7 series (internal code E38). It was the first vehicle with an 
integrated navigation system, developed together with Siemens VDO and NAVTEQ. Over the 
next years, this platform provided the base for the first telematic services with the partners 
Mannesman Autocom (having become, since, the telematic service provider ATX) and 
Siemens VDO. Presented in September of 1999 on the “International Automobil Austellung” 
(IAA) in Frankfurt/Main, BMW Assist was introduced to the market in the 7 series as a 
European premiere, as a technically separate solution was already offered in the USA in 1998. 
BMW Assist offered emergency call, breakdown call, traffic information and information 
call. The service required the BMW navigation system and car phone because no TCU was 
available at that time. Voice and data communication utilized and charged the customer’s 
SIM card, although SMS charges were soon abandoned for the customers through reverse 

 3 Experiencing Connected Services in the automotive industry 
46 
charging to BMW. At that time no other OEM or after-market supplier offered any similar 
product. Two years later at the IAA 2001, BMW Online was introduced as an additional 
service, together with the premiere of the next 7 series (E65). At the same time, Mercedes-
Benz launched their service "TeleAid" with emergency, breakdown and information call, plus 
an in-vehicle online portal together with the partner T-Online, a subsidiary of Deutsche 
Telekom. But due to limited success, both products were discontinued in 2005, except in 
North America. OEMs like Jaguar or Volkswagen also appeared on the market for a short 
time. Only in North America were other OEMs able to stay on the market. The most 
prominent offering, GM’s "OnStar," features a service portfolio comparable to BMW Assist, 
and by May 2007 was serving more than 5 million customers (GeneralMotors 2007). 
BMW had only a low five-figure number of customers at the end of 2002. But three factors 
helped to boost the number of subscribers to more than 500,000. First, by 2001 BMW 
recognized BCD and telematic services as a major area of innovation, and they realized that 
internal acceptance and commitment were of major importance to further growth. Second, 
there was a wave of expansion in terms of internationalization (see Appendix 3) and product 
availability (roll-out of the BMW 5 series in 2004 and BMW 3 series in 2005). Third, 
technological advancements allowed the installation of a TCU with a BMW SIM card, 
thereby removing all telecommunication charges from the customer. The data rates for BMW 
Online were continuously increased, and an entry solution with telephone and radio only (no 
navigation system) to offer BMW Assist without BMW Online was prepared. 
In 2006 the whole topic of telematics for passenger vehicles gained momentum – very much 
driven by the success of portable navigation devices. Ford and Microsoft announced a 
cooperation agreement to offer a platform for telematics and entertainment called "Sync" in 
most Ford models from model year 2008 onwards. At the same time, Microsoft and Fiat 
developed "Blue and Me" – bringing Windows Automotive into the mass market for the first 
time. In the original stage, this product offered only the integration and voice control of mp3-
players and mobile phones via Bluetooth, at a relatively low price of about EUR 350, in 
several models of Fiat, Lancia, Alfa Romeo and Maserati. The roadmap for "Blue and Me" 
showed plans for telematic extensions in the later stages. Fiat also offered a navigation system 
with emergency call, and later on the PSA brands (Peugeot, Citroen) and Volvo launched 
similar systems, although none of the competitors’ offerings matched BMW ConnectedDrive 
in depth and breadth of the services (see also Appendix 6). Very recently, Ford’s 
announcement of an international roll-out of it enhanced, telematic-capable “Ford Sync” 
(Pope 2009), but also introductions for Toyota and Lexus in the U.S. market (Schweinsberg 
2009), significantly increased the pace of the telematics market.  

 3.3 Case study BMW ConnectedDrive 
47
New competition also arose from Telematic Service Providers, which tried to extend their role 
from pure suppliers to white label, full-solution providers for OEMs. A press release of 
Hughes Telematics in January 2007 (Hughes-Telematics 2007) stated that not only had they 
won the Chrysler Group as a new customer, but they will outsource the complete business 
from development to operations in the future.  
3.3.3 
Trends and outlook  
In recent years there has been an ongoing discussion in the commission of the European 
Union about the decrease of accident victims. Their declared goal was to halve the annual 
number of road fatalities from 50,000 to 25,000 by 2010 (base year 2001, see 
http://www.esafetysupport.org). One assisting measure included the compulsory introduction 
of manual and automatic emergency call systems for all new vehicles in order to shorten 
response times of relief units.  
But the latest act of the Intelligent Car Initiative - "Raising Awareness of ICT for smarter, 
safer and cleaner vehicles" from February 15, 2006, has already been delayed by one year, so 
that the compulsory introduction is expected to be no earlier than September, 2010. In any 
case, it is not yet clear whether a system with an autonomous GSM connection will be 
required or whether the usage of the customer mobile will also be sufficient.  
Another significant development derives from the market of portable navigation devices 
(PND), because customers can only use the full service portfolio of BMW ConnectedDrive if 
the vehicle also features one of the (pre-fitted) navigation systems and a handsfree set. The 
distribution of BCD is therefore limited by the acceptance or take-rate of options which, 
especially in the smaller vehicle classes (BMW 1 series, BMW 3 series), represents a 
significant share of the total vehicle price. But in 2005 the alternative of autonomous mobile 
navigation devices started to break into the mass markets with prices ranging from EUR 300 
to 600. These devices mainly belonged to the PND category, while solutions based on 
Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) did not match in terms of installation and ease-of-use. By 
2006 the European market had already reached more than 9 million PNDs, and the forecast 
for 2007 promised a turnover of 16 million units. The North American market lagged behind 
somewhat, with 3 and 7 million devices respectively. Overall, those figures surpassed even 
the most optimistic market forecasts from previous years, which repeatedly postponed the 
breakthrough in the past (see Appendix 5). That said, at least in the smaller vehicle classes 
PNDs quite often substitute integrated navigation systems and thereby also reduce the base 
for BMW ConnectedDrive. At the same time, PNDs also extend their feature set with 
telematic applications like Location Based Services (LBS), as seen in the automatic 
notification of friends in the closer proximity (TomTom Buddies), partial online map updates 

 3 Experiencing Connected Services in the automotive industry 
48 
(TomTom Map Share) or local emergency contacts (TomTom and Garmin). The year 2008 
finally saw the launch of devices with an integrated SIM card to offer vehicle/traffic-related 
services (TomTom or Mio), but also the platform for further applications like Yahoo! Local 
Search (e.g., Dash Express, see http://www.dash.net). A further growth of this segment is 
expected despite inherent advantages of OEM-fitted systems ("deep integration") such as a 
bigger screen, safer handling, more accurate positioning or a seamless optical integration. 
Looking forward, most market forecasts predict a strong growth of mobile navigation using 
mobile phones and smart phones in the next years. The Apple iPhone, introduced in 2007, is a 
case in point. Although it only offered GPS until the second generation one year later, its 
integration into the vehicle offers the customer mobile infotainment with its integrated iTunes 
client and Internet browser. Together with the widening service portfolio of dictionary service 
numbers like "11 88 0" (offering not only yellow pages but claiming to find almost every type 
information required) such multi-media devices, if integrated effectively into the vehicle, 
appeal to many customers as well as most BMW ConnectedDrive services. Apple, Blackberry 
and Nokia are, therefore, examples of new competitors to OEMs. At the same time, their 
devices also provide another software platform for Internet players to offer mobile office 
applications, content and search engines. Companies like Google, Yahoo and MSN have 
started to extend their Internet and PC programs and services to the mobile space. Google also 
pioneers a wide portfolio of services for mobile devices, such as mobile (and increasingly 
localized) search, Email access with synchronization to the existing account (GMail), Maps or 
upload of videos to YouTube. Yahoo offers "Yahoo! Go" as a separate application and user 
interface for mobile devices with widgets, location-based search, Email access, photo 
communities and information portals for news, weather, sports or movie programming (for a 
simulation see http://mobile.yahoo.com/go/emulator). Customers buying a new vehicle are 
now able to experience several equivalent (or partially equivalent) services from BCD without 
the need for dedicated hardware. Although such solutions do not offer the advantages of a 
fully integrated system like the direct use of POIs sent into the car, these mobile services are 
not limited to the use in vehicle (e.g., allowing use by pedestrians or cyclists).  
BMW, in turn, focuses on inherent advantages with the BMW Assist extension through 
additional services like “Remote Lock/Unlock,” which began in September 2008. The 
customer can now call the call center agent to remotely lock the vehicle if he is unsure about 
having done so beforehand, or to unlock the vehicle if the key is inside the car or completely 
lost. Two more features show the continuous development of BCD: BMW Internet allows for 
access to the World Wide Web in the vehicle (with no trial period included at 150 EUR/year), 
and BMW Routes enables users to download recommended tracks from BMW (such as a 
scenic tour of the Alps) to their navigation system through an online connection.  

 3.3 Case study BMW ConnectedDrive 
49
3.3.4 
Behavioral customer segmentation 
Most BMW ConnectedDrive users are suspected to belong to one of three, not mutually 
exclusive, clusters that are classified by their motivations to select and use the services: 
 
The first group is comprised of safety-oriented customers. Especially in North 
America or Australia, which have long distance routes and low levels of 
infrastructure along those roads, the emergency and breakdown call feature has 
strong customer appeal. Such customers regard BCD as insurance which they hope 
they will never need. 
 
The second group is made up of customers with a generally strong interest in 
innovations and technologies. Participants of this group are fascinated by the 
technical feasibility of BCD and other innovative features in their vehicle, and 
clearly belong to the group of “early adopters.” 
 
The last group consists of business users. These customers value every service which 
leads to time savings in their daily lives (like traffic information or automatic 
maintenance notification), or which increase their convenience (like information call 
and BMW Online on trips in foreign cities). 
In anticipation of the customer survey results (discussed in the later chapters), the clusters 
described here have been validated ex post (n=1.643) and highlight the fact that only one out 
of ten customers falls in one of the first two groups respectively, while roughly five out of ten 
belong to the group of business users.  
The usage analysis of the three clusters depicts the knowledge that technology users (index of 
1.57) surpass business users (index 1.36) over safety users (index 0.38). But the most active 
customers do belong to the conjunction of both the technology and business clusters, with an 
index figure of 2.67. This shows that even for users with a high affiliation to complex 
products and services, technology is not an end in itself, but requires a use-case or has to 
deliver a benefit on a regular base. In contrast, the safety group contains roughly twice as 
many customers who did not use the (activated) services at all, which re-confirms the 
characteristics of this cluster, but also foreshadows the idea that usage intensity is not an 
appropriate measurement of satisfaction for every customer groups.  
The review of the clusters also suggests another differentiator along the three groups, namely 
the share of female users. While the number of women in the safety customer group is 50% 
above the average of the full customer base, it is 50% below in the business cluster and falls 
to almost zero in the technology cluster.  
According to the expert interviews, but also supported by some free text answers from the 
survey, there also seems to exist a group of deniers, whose users are capable and knowledge 

 3 Experiencing Connected Services in the automotive industry 
50 
about technologies, but who deliberately search for pure, simplified solutions. As an extreme, 
one interview partner claims that such customers completely live the claim of BMW “sheer 
driving pleasure” and would even disclaim the radio, if possible. They often just drive for fun 
and do not want to be distracted from this experience by anything not absolutely essential. In 
the same line, but by a different motivation, are those users who see their car as the last 
bastion where they are free from modern means of communication – no phone, no TV, no 
Email. 
Summarizing, the data analysis also reveals a significant portion of customers who do not 
fulfill any of the selection criteria, and who thereby represent a very heterogeneous group of 
customers with individual needs and motivations, a tendency also labeled “individualization 
of consumption” (Meffert, Twardawa, and Wildner 2001). Indications for such factors to 
accept and use BCD were also suggested in the expert interviews. 
3.3.5 
Individual customer traits for technology acceptance  
Additional aspects have been assumed to influence acceptance and usage of BMW 
ConnectedDrive by the interview participants. Those customer traits consistently re-appeared 
across expert interviews and are presented here in the order of appearance. The quotes of this 
section are all taken from those expert interviews.  
For some customer groups, enjoyment and emotions are supposed to be important fostering 
criteria in the usage of the services. Online communities and forums are indicators for the 
involvement and commitment of some persons with the product and service offering. A short 
review of such web sites indicates a group of users who spend a significant amount of time 
discussing only news, questions and difficulties with regard to BMW in general and BMW 
ConnectedDrive in particular. It can be noted that high proficiency with the topics 
corresponds to high demands and expectations, but also to fair and realistic feedback to 
criticism of other users.  
Along the same line, and perhaps regionally limited to Asian and Middle Eastern countries, is 
the role of vehicles as openly displayed status symbols. Buyers in those countries very often 
select fully loaded vehicles, i.e., they order every option offered, and favor features which 
they can show to other people. There is the anecdote of two business partners returning from 
their golf clubhouse to the parking lot. Shortly before arriving at his new vehicle, the owner 
presses a button on the remote and the trunk opens automatically, accompanied by his 
comment: “Does your car also have this feature”? This story shows that innovative features or 
options of the vehicle are indeed able to represent status or prestige.  

 3.3 Case study BMW ConnectedDrive 
51
A high degree of technology affinity and expertise with other technological products and 
features is also suspected to be a positive moderator of technology acceptance and usage. 
Variance across users is also recognized, because “some users handle technologies and 
devices in a playful way.” 
On the side of the barriers to technology acceptance and usage, complexity was mentioned 
numerous times, but from different angles. In one interview, complexity was regarded “more 
of an issue to dealers than to customers,” because dealers had to guide customers through a 
registration and activation process which required in-depth knowledge of the services. In 
another interview, complexity of the product hampered the communication and sales process, 
and thereby also complicated user acceptance and, consequently, innovation diffusion: “A 
feature offered by companies will not always be welcomed by customers. The customer has to 
learn the feature first. Without help, without explanations, he does not see the added value.” 
In at least one dimension, complexity has already been recognized as relevant in daily 
operations, namely as a potential source of driver distraction. Although not required by law in 
the UK, BMW Online services are faded to black as soon as the vehicle approaches a speed of 
more than 5 kilometers per hour. Complexity is also understood to be a barrier to older 
people, making age a relevant factor for product development and communication strategy. 
Furthermore, a complex pricing structure, i.e., missing pricing transparency, is also regarded as 
a hurdle to customers. This is documented by a customer who, according to a dealer, “did not 
want to activate the services in the trial period because of the fear of being locked in 
afterwards.” But transparency is also required because the frequent (but inaccurate) notion of 
variable costs (pay-per-use) seems to distract customers from leveraging the benefits of the 
system. In the current offering, the initial trial period and the subsequent subscription 
represent a flat rate, i.e., there are no costs per usage, although some customers claim to prefer 
a pay-per-use pricing structure. A short test in the U.S. market that simultaneously offered a 
yearly flat rate next to a transactional model with pay-per-use showed that, in the light of 
vehicle price of $40k or more, customers felt that “BMW is nickel-and-diming me to death”. In 
addition, the incorporated higher administration costs for such a model led the pricing strategy back to 
a flat rate with even longer periods up to 4 years, which represents a front-loading of costs. Finally, 
subscription models were not conveying the general premium entitlement of the BMW brand.  
The brand of the core product also fulfills the role of a guarantee to customers when referring 
to data protection and security. As with many other new technologies, some customers also 
consider the data abuse or data manipulation risks. But in line with the outcomes of research 
in the B2B sector (Holtbrügge, Holzmüller, and von Wangenheim 2007, p.103), certificates 
and third party tests are reassuring to customers, making the brand image a hygienic factor: 
the notion or reference to the trusted OEM closes all questions or worries, but does not 

 3 Experiencing Connected Services in the automotive industry 
52 
constitute a sales pitch argument in its end. This also holds true for the sometimes postulated 
risk of the vehicle being continuously tracked by the OEM. While this perceived disadvantage 
can be mitigated with a reference to BMW as a trust partner and the technical architecture, 
which does not allow the query of positioning data from outside the car (i.e., only the driver 
can initialize data transmissions with GPS positioning data), it shows that perceived critical 
issues should be addressed proactively.  
In the case study on BMW ConnectedDrive, one interview participant claimed a quite 
surprising hypothesis in the context of “Big brother is watching you.” He acknowledged the 
generally positive effect of the experience with adjacent products like navigation systems, 
mobile phones and Internet usage. But at least in the context of BCD, the feeling of risk takes 
course on a U-shaped curve, as depicted in Figure 11: while customers with no experience at 
all are simply not concluding the (theoretical) risks, very experienced customers are fully 
aware of the low likelihood, the technical restrictions and the existence of similar risks in 
daily life when using mobile phones and credit cards. Remaining are the customers in the 
middle, who are worried because of half knowledge based on incomplete information or 
information taken from other context. There is one more aspect supporting this correlation of 
experience with acceptance: customers who are very experienced with systems from this and 
adjacent areas such as mobile phones, mobile computing, and gaming consoles also have high 
expectations and use the system at its upper limit. Naturally, they will come to limitations of 
the services, which are designed to meet the needs of the broad market. On the other end of 
the continuum, users without prior experience will not be constrained by those technical 
limitations, but at the same time will miss the potential benefits.

3.4 
Case Study BMW TeleServices 
BMW TeleServices is marketed as the service pillar of BMW ConnectedDrive in Germany 
since September 2007, and is also by industry standards and in customer perspective allocated 
to the field of telematics. The reflection in a separate case study is founded on three reasons. 
First, it confirms many of the findings from the BMW ConnectedDrive case study and 
therefore allows for a tight review. Second, there are some specifics like the pricing structure 
and analogies from other areas which foster acceptance by customers. Third, the use of 
telematic services for monitoring a vehicle’s status has been established in the B2B market for 
commercial vehicles (trucks) at the same time and allows for a comparative analysis on 
differences to the technology acceptance in B2C settings. 
3.4.1 
Use cases, motivations, and success factors in B2C  
BMW TeleServices, as of model year 2008, features three use cases, which are based on the 
same technology and infrastructure as BMW Assist or BMW Online: a Telematics Control 
Unit with an integrated SIM card (or a connection to the customer mobile phone) in the 
vehicle, the network service provider for data transmission and voice calls, a telematics 
service provider to handle the data exchange from and to the vehicle and, finally, a call center. 
In this case, the call center is staffed with motor mechanics to directly support and guide 
customers in the case of a breakdown situation.  
The automatic TeleServices call is based on the vehicle self-diagnosis system called 
Condition Based Service (CBS). CBS monitors the most important wear parts of the vehicle, 
such as engine oil, brake fluid and brake pads, or air filter. Based on the monitoring data, a 
prediction of the remaining life span of the parts is calculated and displayed in the vehicle, as 
Figure 12 shows. If one part falls below a defined remaining period (time or mileage), the 
relevant service data is aggregated and transmitted automatically to the respective car 
dealership. The dealer then informs the customer through a phone call (on his preferred 
number) and arranges for an appointment. The customer benefits from the reminder and 
shorter service times due to more precise time and spare part planning, and the OEM can 
safeguard more of its downstream business because in this part of the value chain, as one 
interview participant explained, “first contacts secures business.”  

 3 Experiencing Connected Services in the automotive industry 
54 
 
Figure 12: Screenshot of Condition Based Service in the vehicle 
The same process can also be manually initiated in the vehicle by the customer. This manual 
TeleServices call, based on a service need recognized by the driver or just for arranging an 
appointment when changing to winter tires, represents the second use case. 
The third use case concerns any breakdown situation where assistance is required. Also 
initiated by the driver in the vehicle, the information from CBS and some extra data including 
the level of fuel tank and the GPS position, are then sent to a customer service center with 
motor mechanics, where a voice connection is established. While in some cases the problem 
can already be diagnosed, e.g., the driver was running out of gas, in other cases an extended 
data query (remote diagnosis) is started and has to be confirmed by the driver in the vehicle. 
For some situations it is then possible to repair the problem remotely, saving the customer a 
stop at the repair shop. In other situations, a mobile service unit of BMW might be 
dispatched, using the already retrieved information on the vehicle and its precise location, 
also saving time and costs to BMW and the customer.  
The required options in the vehicle are similar to the requirements of BMW Assist, i.e., a 
control display with Radio Professional and mobile phone handsfree set, or in the case of the 
BMW 1 and 3 series, a navigation system with the handsfree set. Depending on the market, 
there might be some costs charged to the customers’ mobile for sending data or for calling the 
service center. But acceptance of those costs is generally high based on an logic that if 
customers did not have TeleServices, they would be required to make a call at their own 
expense to reach the nearest repair shop or the roadside service. Consequently, a service at 
similar costs but with higher benefits is, in general, accepted to be fair.  
At this point, OEMs need to be aware of the risks associated with TeleServices. 
Paradoxically, the benefits to the customer – fewer and shorter stops at the dealer – also 
mitigate the OEM due to the simultaneous reduction in number of customer touchpoints 
(Holtbrügge, Holzmüller, and von Wangenheim 2007, p.17). 

 3.4 Case Study BMW TeleServices 
55
There are two more analogies helping customers to understand the functionality, benefits and 
risks of the service in the first place, and to decide on acceptance in the second place. One 
comparison is with the use of telematics in motor sports, most visibly to consumers in the 
Formula One racing series. Leveraging data transmission to recognize and prepare box stops 
during a race can be easily remembered and also transferred to the personal use case of 
vehicle owners. The other comparison requires some additional expertise with the use of 
computers, but is also on the rise in numerous workplaces: automatic software updates for 
applications of the operating system, and also the remote help feature, allowing staff from IT 
support to take over control of the local computer for troubleshooting. In general, experiences 
from such examples also encourage the acceptance of services in adjacent areas of life. 
During the development process, these analogies have also been confirmed through customer 
labs. Differences among customers have been identified as well. Drivers of larger cars, with 
higher mileages and business use, tended to favor the service because of the convenience 
aspect, perceived as “one more thing you don’t have to care about.” Drivers of smaller car 
classes, on the other hand, also mentioned the assumed risks of data protection and security. 
Both examples confirm the equation which customers seem to calculate: perceived benefits 
minus perceived risks equals net value. Once more, the reference to the possibility of locating 
mobile phones with a granularity of 30 meters in the city is rejected or diminished by the high 
benefit of accessibility, and by the objectively irrelevant argument of “all others use it as 
well.” Interestingly, customers in the U.S. seemed to be more prepared to provide their data, 
subject to an acceptable service quality level. Regarding the preferred pricing structure, 
customer lab participants declared two contrasting wishes, depending on their assumed usage 
profile. Drivers of bigger cars privileged flat rates, while those of smaller vehicles generally 
voted for transactional costs, i.e., pay-per-use models.  
Compared to the first case study, the prestige effect was another recurring theme for some 
customer groups, such as talks between business people on the experience that “my service 
representative called yesterday to notify me of my car’s maintenance schedule.” These 
customers are also predominantly from the middle of the experience curve, i.e., they are no 
technical experts but they like to discuss such features at length. Overall, some influence of 
social effects cannot be denied.  
The widely visible trend of technification, along with the increasing complexity of products 
and services, does help in the argumentation of BMW TeleServices, at least for those 
customers who recognize that “even in earlier times it was not easy to explain what a problem 
of a car as a complex product is. And it did not get easier.” Consumers who understand this 
tendency also sense the benefits of the services offered, as a tool to manage complexity it the 
case of a system failure. This is also supported by the fact that customers have already learned 

 3 Experiencing Connected Services in the automotive industry 
56 
to accept some loss of control when it comes to vehicle repairs that more frequently involve 
electric and electronic causes (Holtbrügge, Holzmüller, and von Wangenheim 2007, p.18). 
3.4.2 
Telematics in B2B for commercial vehicles 
BMW ConnectedDrive is clearly a B2C application of telematics. The justification for 
underlining the differences to B2B also in the area of technology acceptance is revealed 
through the comparison with a B2B application of telematics: A producer of commercial 
vehicles began a project about ten years ago with the aim of expanding to new revenue 
streams, but also for differentiating itself in the market of full-service leasing providers. The 
product consists of a black box installed in vehicles with GPS, GSM and connection to the 
vehicle electronic, and supports three clusters of services: 
 
Vehicle management: the use of an OEM-standardized interface allows for reading 
and transmitting a basic set of data such as driving times and break periods, but also 
consumption and wear profiles of the current truck driver based on speed and on 
accelerating and braking behavior. Installing the black box in vehicles of the own 
OEM brand (in contrast to the use in vehicles of other OEMs) allows for accessing 
much more detailed data from the vehicle, including diagnosis, check control (error) 
messages and the need for maintenance.  
 
Transport management / logistic support services: the main focus of these services is 
on the integration of the vehicles in the dispatch processes, e.g., through the upload 
of order data and corresponding GPS data of the destination.  
 
Capacity planning: tachographs, which are still manually edited and/or copied into 
the IT systems, can be replaced with the black box to reduce process costs.  
In contrast to the telematic services in the passenger car market, a continuous connection from 
the vehicle to the back-end is used. Consequently, customers of the services do have access to 
an Internet portal, where the GPS position of the vehicle and the data transmitted are 
permanently shown. The required hardware for the services is sold for about 2,500 EUR, and 
a yearly subscription fee of roughly 500 EUR per vehicle is added.  
Customers of the services are mainly fleet managers in the freight forwarding business. Most 
companies do utilize at least two OEMs in their fleet, but are interested in unified 
administrative systems, ideally from one provider. In the B2B area, telematics is well known 
to most customers and also leads to a high brand awareness of the service provider. That said, 
the challenge moves from a general technology acceptance to the usage, where discussions 
are mainly focused on the amortization of the services, i.e., on usefulness and price. There are 
only a few new customers or smaller businesses which have not been using telematic systems 

 3.4 Case Study BMW TeleServices 
57
and which are not fully aware of the possibilities: “Well, I just want to see the location of my 
vehicles on the Internet.” Those customers tend to compare the services to solutions from the 
B2C business, especially when the price for a map update surpasses the price of a consumer 
PND. Actually, producers of such PNDs like TomTom or Garmin are increasingly targeting 
the lower end of the B2B business by developing specific software and service solutions 
based on their devices which were initially targeted to consumers only. Returning to the 
customer description, there are also customers who are very demanding and who calculate 
very sophisticated business cases in order to select only a very few services out of the 
portfolio. 
For all customers, the decision to utilize telematic services is, as already indicated, based on 
95% rational considerations. The economic gains are derived from both the monitoring and 
management of driving behavior but also from training for the truck drivers, where 
improvements can be easily controlled. Savings of 10% are possible and represent a high 
lever, because roughly 70% of all costs during an average 4-year usage period arise from 
variable costs like fuel, maintenance, personnel and depreciation/leasing rates. Additional 
savings can be calculated from decreasing insurance rates for the company, based on lower 
numbers of accidents and liability claims. The remaining 5% of the decision to implement 
telematic services are indeed of non-rational nature, but are decreasing over time, because 
only “at the beginning were most customers impressed with what is possible in vehicle 
management.” 
However, emotion responses are strong when plans for equipping trucks with telematic 
services are unveiled. Truck drivers and labor unions are seldom comfortable with the idea of 
permanent observation. But in most cases, the winning strategies are then based on incentive 
systems for the truckers, i.e., variable payment parts or bonuses based on competitions for the 
most efficient and economical driving style. In the same line, leasing providers for 
commercial vehicles might also offer contracts with leasing rates, including discounts, linked 
to driving styles that are gentle on the vehicle.  
An issue which is requested often deals with data security and protection. In contrast to the 
B2C segment, customers are more worried about intentional attacks by hackers, putting at risk 
systems that are critical for their daily operations and subsequent orders. Similar to the end 
consumer experience, however, this topic seems to be a hygienic factor which can be satisfied 
with transparent security standards, but even more through subcontracting well-known data 
processing centers.

3.5 
Case study BMW Personal Radio (Prototype) 
The third case study focuses on BMW Personal Radio, a prototype developed by the research 
department BMW Forschung und Technik GmbH. Original concepts of this prototype reach 
back to the year 2003, to a joint project on the distribution of time-shifted media content 
through satellites with the European Space Agency (ESA). Further momentum was created in 
the middle of the last decade, when technologies like RSS, Podcasts and Vidcasts gained 
popularity with users, and in the press. A separate project on automotive entertainment was 
then started, and soon revealed a first prototype service named “BMW Personal Radio,” most 
recently seen on the automotive exhibitions in Geneva and on the IAA in Frankfurt in 2007. 
Details can be found in the press release (BMW 2007), but are summarized here. 
The service is focused around a personalized entertainment program in the vehicle, allowing 
the driver to listen to his favorite program at anytime and anywhere. Two of the use cases 
already presented explain the idea to leverage the connection of the vehicle with a back-end 
infrastructure. The first scenario allows the driver to compile a program of local sources in the 
vehicle, i.e., FM/AM radio, CD, DVD, and mp3, together with sources from the Internet like 
podcasts or radio stations from all over the world. A program for the morning drive to work 
might be defined as 15 minutes of the latest CNN news, followed by 30min of classical 
music, and ending with sports news from the local radio station. The one-time setup then 
delivers new, up-to date content every other day. Based on this content from various sources, 
the second scenario allows for automatically generated playlists based on semantic analysis of 
one ore more reference songs. The feature called “Find Similar” enables the driver to use a 
song he is listening to as a trigger to program a “station” which plays songs of the same 
mood, style, and speed from local content. and also from the Internet, thereby including new 
songs. This technology is already available to customers on the PC through the Internet; 
especially popular in the U.S. are services like Rhapsody, Pandora and Last.fm. In all 
scenarios, the service can track users’ preferences and thus make future suggestions.  
Knowledge from this case study in the context of technology acceptance were derived from 
expert interviews with members of the project team, but also from direct customer feedback 
on the IAA 2007. Compared to the first case study on BMW ConnectedDrive, there are a 
number of recurring themes which further support the development of hypotheses. As well, 
some best practice examples which offer further insights are derived from the close consumer 
electronics context of this case study.  
Customers’ first reaction after an introduction to the services is mostly on the rational benefit 
of the product, compared to alternative means. If consumers are not interested in the topic, the 
integration of audio players like an Apple iPod into the vehicle seems to offer the same 
functionality as any other audio system. Looking into the details, there are actually even 

 3.5 Case study BMW Personal Radio (Prototype) 
59
distinct features of BMW Personal Radio representing a USP. But there are three additional 
arguments on the user interface, which consumers endorse. First, integrated solutions 
represent the approach of a premium brand in terms of optical and haptic experience. Second, 
the bigger vehicle screen, the ergonomic and familiar input device and operating logic all 
contribute to the expected ease of use. Third, there is a safety aspect when using the device or 
service while driving. This argument is valid for most consumers, but is also being 
increasingly considered by regulatory authorities, e.g., some U.S. states – California, for 
instance – prohibits any portable devices mounted on the windshield area.  
These factors are expected to foster acceptance not only in this case, but, according to one 
interview participant from the technology office in Palo Alto, California, they have 
constituted a key success factor for major innovations in the consumer electronics industry 
space. He referred to the Apple iPhone and the Nintendo Wii as two breakthrough 
innovations, or even paradigm shifts, within their markets. The Apple iPhone is a mobile 
phone which features an interface completely based on a touchscreen. The iPod’s one-
button/one ring interface was new to the market at its launch, as well. The Nintendo Wii, 
likewise, offers an innovative interface through its motion-based controller, allowing for 
sports-games or car racing with “full-body application.” Both products were given strong 
marketing efforts that supported their introduction and sale. In addition, innovation leaders 
and peer groups were heavily targeted, showing the significance and potential for verbal 
marketing. Thereby, the desirability of the device because of social influence became a USP 
itself. Nevertheless, "novelty wears off pretty quickly," so both products have, underneath, a 
compelling, thoughtful and seamless user interface to keep users attracted over time. The 
expert interview participant also confirmed both factors through a negative example: while 
Windows Mobile-based Smartphones are quite comparable to the iPhone from a purely 
technical viewpoint, and even offers some unique and useful features, they are neither very 
desirable nor easy to use. Consequently, those devices have not been very successful in the 
market. Turning back to the focus of the case study, BMW Personal Radio does indeed 
consider usability, although its direct user interface is restricted, so as to be compatible and 
consistent with the general MMI of the vehicle. But its way of giving customers access to 
their entertainment libraries and to additional previously unknown content is actually a new 
user interface. 
The second question about the prototype from consumers is generally on costs. It is 
interesting to note that the common opinion of “on the Internet everything is available for 
free” has slowly changed into some degree of willingness to pay for content and services. 
Several developments seem to support this tendency of “from free to fee,” and are also 
reflected in changing business models of online content and service providers as analyzed by 
Pauwels and Weiss (2008). Most notable, the offerings nowadays also reach the mass market 

 3 Experiencing Connected Services in the automotive industry 
60 
with customers more accustomed to paying for content from the offline world, while at the 
beginning download channels like “peer-to-peer networks” were only used by some early 
adopters. At the same time, the technical requirements like adequate broadband connections 
with flat rates and, foremost, the availability of legal platforms like Apple iTunes for music, 
have only recently been fulfilled. Overall, even for hedonic consumption, rational thoughts on 
the expected benefits and costs are a concern of customers. 
Opinions on the role of previous experience were two-fold: on the one hand, experience was 
attributed to be and aid to understanding the advantages and benefits of the offering. On the 
other hand, too-close relations to and from the PC world also comprise the risk of negative 
connotations on the complexity, stability or usability of the services. As a result, 
communication is much more concentrated on the use case and benefit for the customer than 
on the purely technological novelty of BMW Personal Radio. As a whole, this observation 
makes another point in the case for the n-shaped influence of experience on technology 
acceptance (as depicted in Figure 11). The communication strategy to focus on use cases and 
generic claims rather than on detailed explanations of the technology is also used by Audi, 
whose German strapline “Vorsprung durch Technik” has not only been used since 1984, but 
is also played across all countries in the original German version. In the same line, and as an 
answer to the current environmental concerns, BMW now concentrates its communication 
efforts on the Efficient Dynamics program (Hudson 2008).  
As a last topic, two quite diametric shapes of user clusters, which make no claim to be 
complete, have been recognized. The first segmentation is performed along age, although the 
exception proves the rule. Generally, from the age segment of 60+, there are customers who 
reject new, unknown technologies and information on those per se: “This is all too much for 
me.” On the contrary, younger consumers react very positively to such new features. But they 
are also not easy to win as customers, because their high expectations from other areas 
decrease the perceived innovation value: "The service represents just a logical step. Why has 
this not been available up to now?” Apart from structure according to age, there are also the 
two groups of professional users and late adopters. The former are mainly business customers 
who spend a significant amount of their time on the road and in the vehicle. For them, the 
expected high level of usage makes them less price sensitive than other occasional users. Late 
adopters are, like the older group of rejecters, generally disinterested in new technologies. But 
– and this differentiates late adopters from the older users – when technologies get established 
as everyday products and services, they react to the implicit social pressure from others, as 
happened with mobile phones or Email.

Cross-case study comparison, or what it all means to TAUM 
The analysis of the case studies on Connected Services in the automotive industry, namely 
BMW ConnectedDrive, TeleServices and Personal Radio, has revealed several potential 
determinants of customers’ decision on the acceptance and subsequent use of technologies. 
While most of those factors are documented in the literature stream on TAM, some new 
aspects previously not regarded in this context were also extracted.  
In a very precise format, the following themes appear most relevant and consistent across 
different examples: 
 
Rational evaluation of the usefulness of a service, considering the expected future 
setting of deployment 
 
Independent analysis of the associated risks and drawbacks, i.e., aside, and not netted 
with the expected benefits 
 
Economic assessment in the light of the first two points, i.e., price adequacy or 
fairness, also in relation to (perceived) competitive offerings 
 
Usability, either as a positive and significant factor, or as a hygienic factor when it 
must not be perceived as so complex that it completely disqualifies the technology 
 
Enjoyment, not in the sense of hedonic consumption, but intrinsically from 
performing a task with the help of the service or technology 
 
Prestige and social desirability as extrinsic motivational influences 
 
Brands as aggregated promises of product and service attributes, either in a desirable 
way or as an insurance and trust credit, e.g., on data security concerns 
 
Data security and privacy concerns are only relevant to a small group of customers, 
related to the level of general expertise on (Connected) service technologies 
 
Experience with and affinity to technologies are mainly helpful for understanding 
new services, and can also turn into negative 
Finally, some arguments have not been considered in research, presumably because they arise 
in the process before decisions on the acceptance of technologies take place. They are, 
therefore, highlighted in the Apostille.

Apostille: Marketing & Sales of complex technology-based products and services 
A report by Oliver Wyman on car innovations (Wyman 2007) includes a buyer simulation, 
performed in Germany and USA, on 14 technology options which are not intuitive or self-
explaining, like 4Matic (four-wheel drive from Mercedes-Benz) or HCCI (Homogeneous 
Charge Compression Ignition). The breakdown from offering to interest before and after the 
price is known to actual take rates is depicted in Figure 13: 
 
Figure 13: Sales success of innovations (Wyman 2007, p.16) 
The outcome might not surprise marketers and researchers citing explanations like the AIDA 
model (Attention - Interest - Desire - Action, e.g., in Kotler and Bliemel (1999, p.935f)) or 
pre-acquisition avoidance (ignorance, refusal and delay) as a behavioral coping strategy for 
consumers who feel incompetent about new technologies (Mick and Fournier 1998). 
Therefore, the validation and significance of each step for the acceptance of technologies 
must not be underestimated. Acknowledging the significance of a profoundly managed R&D 
portfolio of innovations in the first place, and the adequate attention on the marketing and 
sales process including an appropriate pricing strategy afterwards, are prerequisites and, 
thereby, key success factors for technology acceptance. The special relevance of the ramp-up 
and launch phase was analyzed also in the context of automotive telematic services by Lenfle 
and Midler (2008). 

 3.7 Apostille: Marketing & Sales of complex technology-based products and services 
63
The following observations and conclusions are mainly based on the qualitative expert 
interviews with car dealers in Germany. The details can be summarized into three areas, 
namely complexity, competition of innovations and lack of time. These identified barriers for 
customers can be found across industries, but will now be elaborated by the example of 
Connected Services for the vehicle. 
Consumers feel overwhelmed by complexity when choosing a new car in the sense of 
numerous options and combinations of models, engines, and body designs, with features from 
exterior, interior, safety, comfort, and infotainment choices. Particularly, technical features 
are often branded with different names and abbreviations across different OEMs, although 
their core functionality does not differ significantly. Generally, those options are 
communicated through their technical superiority and details, but not by telling customers 
about their use-cases. All in all, the purchase of most modern vehicles demands a substantial 
level of commitment from customers, i.e., willingness to invest time and effort. OEMs must 
not forget about the dealers, who are still an important source of trust for many buyers. 
Dealers are not only required to be perfectly informed about the vehicles they are selling, but 
are also expected to have an overview on the competitive offerings.  
 At the same time, there is also an internal competition between the ever growing numbers of 
innovations with every new model introduced. This rivalry starts in the R&D portfolios of 
OEMs, is continued in the selected focuses of communication and training materials, and ends 
at the dealer’s showroom. The dealer is then required to concentrate in the sales process on 
those features which are – according to his judgment or personal belief – the most promising 
ones. What this means for the individual technology and the customer is best explained in the 
next step, when lack of time is added to the process, as is shown in Figure 14. 
 
Figure 14: Marketing & Sales process in the automotive industry 
Considering a generic customer without prior experience from Connected Services, he 
experiences the following steps: At first, the prospective buyer might already have been 
subject to mass media communication, and consequently represents a fully informed, mature 
consumer. Because in this example there has been little or no above-the-line communication, 
there is a very limited pull-effect from the market, and the potential unique selling proposition 
cannot be leveraged. As a side-note, the use of abbreviations, OEM-specific naming and the 
creation of English terms has to be carefully considered. Appendix 7 further elaborates this 
issue with a study on the use and efficiency of twelve English brand claims in Germany. 
Customers were first asked whether they knew the meaning of the tested claims and, 
secondly, whether they could give a translation. The answers are amusing for the reader, but

64 
not for the client. Even the best performing slogan did not achieve more than 55% of 
customers who understood the claim correctly (Endmark 2006)6. Although demographics 
generally confirm the assumed profile of younger, higher educated, and technology-oriented 
customers, dealer experiences warn about generalizing those prototypes to the mass market: 
"For the understanding of advertisements there should be no need for thinking twice and an 
English course.” When the potential customer now meets the dealer representative, no 
previous knowledge can be assumed and, in theory, every feature and specific attribute of the 
available technologies and services requires detailed explanations.  
In practice, however, consumer and sales rep have limited time. In addition, most consumers 
are also struggling with the sheer amount of information or are simply not willing to make 
such a deep dive into the detailed specifications of the car. What happens in most cases is, 
therefore, a prioritization of time and effort by the dealer on the most promising technologies: 
those features get promoted which are presumed to either trigger a purchase decision or to 
increase the end price of the vehicle as basis of the representative’s personal bonus. 
Consequently, dealers are quite open about the likelihood of bringing complex features like 
Connected Services into their sales pitch: “Actually, we are under so much pressure that we 
avoid doing such things.” Besides the pretense of low benefit, sales reps even see a risk of 
losing the customer altogether in such conversations – if the customer is not convinced of 
parts of the package, he might discard it completely: “I don’t understand it – therefore I don’t 
need it.” In light of these statements, the following finding of another study across sales 
representatives of major OEM brands becomes understandable: more than 70% of the 
respondents evaluated complex technical innovations to be of “little or no relevance” (Becker 
2008). 
Demonstrations in the vehicle and hands-on experience have proven to be the most intuitive 
and enduring ways to convey complex technologies and services to customers. Unfortunately, 
lack of time once more hinders the next natural possibility to inform and convince customers 
of Connected Services. At the test drive, the hand-over process for the vehicle is often done in 
the evening after work, when customers are taking the car home overnight. They are eager to 
drive the car and experience its core functionalities without being delayed by lengthy 
instructions from the sales representative. The chance to educate consumers after the test 
drive the next morning should be very promising, because a basic knowledge can now be 
taken for granted and paves the way for further, advanced information. At the same time, 
                                                 
6 In the last survey from 2006, Ford performed best with its claim “Feel the difference” being fully understood by 55% of 
respondents (n=1.072). The most missed translations, which are by no means representative, were “Feel the differential,” 
“A lot of differential” and “Deduct the difference”.

chances are very limited because customers once more are in a rush to get to their work. 
Therefore, the influence and potential for a subtle diffusion of the service through lead users, 
but also through friends and colleagues, is promising. The customer survey backs the 
significance of viral marketing with an average of 8 and 5 times of telling and showing (in the 
vehicle) Connected Services to other people. Recent outcomes of research on word-of-mouth 
state that the ratio of positive to negative incidents is 3 to 1 (East, Hammond, and Wright 
2007). In line with these findings, there is also a positive correlation between satisfaction and 
viral intensity in the case of Connected Services. The Toyota Prius is another automotive 
example for highly successful word-of-mouth, and it shows that even durable goods are not 
always decided on by purely rational considerations: In California, with a focus on Los 
Angeles, this first mass-market hybrid vehicle has gained a “green” but also cool image, 
especially with celebrities like Cameron Diaz, Tom Hanks and other trendsetters. The Prius 
has been said to be the alternative choice to the BMW Mini Cooper S, which shows that the 
Prius is, at least for a non-trivial share of customers, purchased not only because of rational 
efficiency or ecological aspects. To complete this example, the allowance for Prius drivers to 
use the car pool lanes on California freeways even if driving the car alone, definitely supports 
its popularity while completely thwarting the promoted ecological effect of the auto.  
There might be the counterargument that consumers are living in a technified world and no 
longer need “brick and mortar” shops. But the economic imperative to carefully integrate 
dealers is also shown from an analysis on the information channels used by customers on 
ConnectedDrive. For two out of three customers, the first contact with the services happens at 
the dealer’s showroom, one out of three also utilize product brochures and, despite the high 
affinity with the Internet, only one in five customers researches the offering on the web site 
(customer survey with n=1.643 and multiple answers allowed). These results further 
emphasize the significance of dealers, despite – or maybe because of – the increasing number 
of technology-enabled products and services. Barbier 2003 (quoted in Lenfle and Midler 
2008, p.3) also adds another dimension to their key role, highlighting the meaning of the 
“salesman performance in the theatrical sense of the word” through an ethnographic analysis 
of automotive dealers. Barbier depicts a sophisticated process very much based on 
improvisation, which makes attempts to rationalize this customer touchpoint very demanding.  
Now, assuming the customer has decided to purchase or order the vehicle with the required 
options for Connected Services, there is another chance to introduce him to the services at the 
delivery of the vehicle. But the restrictions of complexity and a lack of time continue to hold 
true for both parties: dealers already extended their delivery process to two hours, but 
customers are still only able to cope with a limited amount of information. Owner manuals of 
500 and more pages clearly demonstrate that a two-hour introduction can only give a first 

 3 Experiencing Connected Services in the automotive industry 
66 
glance of the vehicles full capabilities. In a very extreme form, one sales rep stated about the 
delivery process: “I’m glad if the customer is able to start the engine to drive off lot.”  
Finally, the process guidelines for new vehicles require sales representatives to call their 
customers some weeks later, to check their satisfaction or deal with open questions. Some 
reps use this call very intentionally to inform their customers on the availability of Connected 
Services for the first time. This seems to be a promising approach because, on the one hand, 
the new car owners are still involved and engaged, but on the other hand they have already 
gained some hands-on experience with their vehicles. Overall, they are receptive to, but also 
capable of, processing further information. On the negative side, this process neglects the 
chance to build on the USP in the sales pitch and thereby does not foster such complex 
technical products and services to become pull-products in the end.  
As a whole, the marketing and sales process for sophisticated technology-based products and 
services has to find the optimum balance between complexity and time restrictions of dealers 
and consumers. Support, training and appreciation of the work “at the grass-root level” are 
needed from OEMs, not only in the automotive industry. Consumers need to understand basic 
information on the offering and the personal use case out of this technology as a first 
milestone – everybody left behind this initial barrier will not enter the subsequent processes 
for technology acceptance and usage at all. 
As a completely different approach, Rust, Thompson, and Hamilton (2006) analyze the 
number of features available as a determinant for initial sales performance and long-term 
customer satisfaction, leading them to the term “feature fatigue.” Their research utilizes a 
mobile audio-/video player with a varying number of features. In their buying simulations 
(keeping price considerations aside), students initially prefer devices with more features 
despite their acknowledgement of a decreasing ease of use. Favoring capability over usability 
only changed over time, when customers got to use their product choice. Given the chance to 
change their initial decision, the majority of test persons finally switch to a device with fewer 
features. This leads Rust, Thompson and Hamilton to the conclusion that a high number of 
features initially supports sales, but frustrates customers in the long run. On the other hand, a 
low number of features will decrease sales performance in the beginning but lead to customer 
satisfaction and loyalty. The economic optimum can therefore be found (and calculated) in the 
middle of the two extremes. While the authors derive their recommendation mainly from the 
customer perception perspective, the outcomes of my expert interviews not only support their 
results but also add another dimension previously not considered. A customer who is not 
knowledgeable about the product or service might be tempted by the richness of features, but 
only if the required information can be passed in a clear way and in a manageable period of 
time. In that sense, the “ease of selling” factor probably further decreases the ideal number of 

 3.7 Apostille: Marketing & Sales of complex technology-based products and services 
67
features for complex products and services. The number of features becomes even more 
important if increased operative costs for more complex trainings, sales literature, and support 
in the marketing and sales process are considered. This dimension also holds true for a wide 
array of products and services across industries.

Bridging theory and practice into a research model  
After having reviewed the relevant research literature from several disciplines in Chapter 2 
and after the explorative research phase as described in Chapter 3, this chapter intends to 
synergize those two areas. As is true throughout this dissertation project, the suggested 
research model claims to be valid for all Connected Services rendered to consumers, with a 
special denotation to the automotive environment. The proposed “Technology Acceptance 
and Usage Model” (TAUM) in its two variants for nonusers and for users deploying 
technology is depicted in Figure 15:

Figure 15: Technology Acceptance and Usage Model (TAUM) 
While TAUM was first drafted as a single model, the universal approach of covering both 
nonusers and users required a model split with minor modifications. This split then reflected 
the inherent peculiarities of consumers at two stages: on the one hand there are those who 
have no experience with the services and are “only” able to evaluate their intention to buy and 
use the services in the future. Because they have, by definition, never been customers of 
Connected Services, they also have not induced any data on the OEM side. On the other hand, 
there are those customers who contracted and activated Connected Services, were able to use 
them for a longer period of time, and therefore also generated usage data with the OEM. The 
notion of different motivations for accepting and using technology is also concluded by 
Bhattacherjee (2001).

4.2 
Rationale for proposed model factors 
4.2.1 
Perceived usefulness 
The factor of perceived usefulness (PU) dates back to the introduction of TAM in the doctoral 
dissertation of Fred Davis (1986), and has consistently reappeared in applications and 
technology acceptance model validations or adaptations ever since. Reflecting the original 
goal of predicting software application usage in corporate settings, Davis defined perceived 
usefulness as “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would 
enhance his or her job performance” (Davis 1989). In contrast to Davis, this dissertation 
focuses on consumers, i.e., in a voluntary context with effects on leisure time (because even 
company cars are typically also used privately). For this reason, the items of usefulness were 
adapted from Kulviwat et al. (2007) who also focus on consumers by evaluating a Personal 
Digital Assistant (PDA). Survey items were modified to capture the specific use cases and 
benefits from telematic services like emergency call or breakdown call, as suggested by 
Goodhue and Thompson (1995) in the task-technology fit concept, as Figure 23 and Figure 30 
show in a complete list of survey items for nonusers and users, respectively. At the partner 
OEM, the factor of perceived usefulness was naturally recognized in all communication 
measures and recurred throughout expert interviews, being summarized by a dealer: “After 
the ‘light bulb moment’ from experiencing the system in action, and given a fit with the 
personal use-case, the path to becoming a customer is only a formality or a question of time.” 
H 1: 
Perceived usefulness is expected to constitute a major factor on attitude 
toward/satisfaction with the system for nonusers/users.  
4.2.2 
Perceived criticalness 
Perceived Criticalness (PC) has, to my knowledge, not yet been used in this research area. It 
comprises specific retentions consumers might have when refusing to accept or use 
Connected Services, such as limited mobile usage of the system (on the bike, in other cars) or 
the fear of being under surveillance, as one customer stated while considering the activation 
of the system on the phone: “Ah, and then you always know where I am currently driving!” 
Items in the survey, therefore, arise from consumer statements and dealer and expert 
interviews. I deliberately chose to separate those aspects from perceived usefulness, since 
Mick and Fournier (1998) show with their technology paradoxes that users can have positive 
and negative feelings toward the same technology at the same time without netting those 
evaluations (e.g. in Baron, Patterson, and Harris 2006). In that sense, perceived criticalness 
cannot be regarded as the direct inverse factor of perceived usefulness. Related theory 
concepts which also influence the formulation of this factor include technology anxiety (e.g. 

 4.2 Rationale for proposed model factors 
71
in Meuter et al. 2003) and the reversion of relative advantage (e.g. in Dabholkar and Bagozzi 
2002; Kulviwat et al. 2007; Moore and Benbasat 1991).  
H 2: 
Perceived criticalness is supposed to have a negative influence on attitude 
toward/satisfaction with the system for nonusers/users.  
4.2.3 
Perceived ease of use  
Perceived ease of use (EOU) is the second “traditional” factor in TAM and is defined as “the 
degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort” 
(Davis 1989). In the same study, perceived ease of use had a small but significant correlation 
with usage intention. In another, longitudinal study with Bagozzi and Warshaw (Davis, 
Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1989), a diminishing influence over time has been recognized. The 
importance of EOU, especially in the consumer (electronics) market, has been summarized by 
one of our expert interview partners from a technology office in the U.S.: “In the last two 
years there have been two devices that have really been kind of paradigm shifters in 
interaction […]: Apple iPhone and Nintendo Wii.” The importance in the automotive market 
has also shown up very strongly, when BMW presented the new 7-series in 2001 with a new 
HMI concept called iDrive, featuring only one central controller replacing most hard keys. 
The concept was quite revolutionary at that time but – at best – it polarized consumers and 
press: “Even if a modern automobile is essentially a mobile computer, its operator’s first 
concern is to keep it from crashing” (Cobb 2002). Survey items were taken from Walczuch, 
Lemmink, and Streukens (2007).  
H 3: 
Perceived ease of use is assumed to have a positive influence on attitude 
toward/satisfaction with the system for nonusers/users.  
4.2.4 
Technology readiness and innovation valuation 
The construct technology readiness originates from a 36-item survey aiming to aggregate two 
supporting (optimism and innovativeness) and two hindering (discomfort and insecurity) 
attitudes with regard to the general adoption of new technologies. Parasuraman defines 
technology readiness as “people’s propensity to embrace and use new technologies for 
accomplishing goals in home life and at work” (Parasuraman 2000). Besides the original item 
battery, Parasuraman also developed a 10- and 6-item scale, which was favored due to survey 
space. In all cases, the authors of the instrument calculate a technology readiness index (TRI) 
ranging from -16 to +16. Several studies have integrated the technology readiness construct in 
their application on technology acceptance (Walczuch, Lemmink, and Streukens 2007; Zhu et 
al. 2007), identifying innovative users (Matthing et al. 2006) or technology acceptance model 

 4 Forming the conceptual framework into a research model 
72 
extensions (Lin, Shih, and Sher 2007). In a non-academic context, technology readiness came 
up in several instances throughout qualitative research. One dealer representative claimed the 
generic heavy user to be highly aligned to technologies in general: “Those who have all of 
their data also on the Blackberry, and always have the latest notebook computer at home – 
those are also candidates [for Connected Services]. Those who don’t are consequently no 
candidate for it.”  
H 4: 
It is presumed that technology readiness fosters attitude toward/satisfaction 
with the system for nonusers/users. 
In addition, the general relevance of innovativeness for the vehicle selection was measured 
though a single-item question. Although the average driver of this OEM is assumed to be 
generally interested in owning the latest technologies and innovations in the vehicle, variance 
in the valuation is predicted. Connected Services are assumed to satisfy a customer’s wish for 
innovative features in the vehicle. 
H 5: 
Car innovation valuation is predicted to positively contribute to attitude 
towards/satisfaction with the system for nonusers/users. 
4.2.5 
Prestige 
In the literature, the factor prestige is mostly referred to as image. Moore and Benbasat (1991) 
quote the definition of Tornatzky and Klein (1982), saying that image is “the degree to which 
use of an innovation is perceived to enhance one's image or status in one's social system.” 
Image as a driver of innovations – like telematic services – is also referenced by Rogers 
(2003) who states that “undoubtedly one of the most important motivations for almost any 
individual to adopt an innovation is the desire to gain social status.” An influence has also 
been reported in the context of mobile phones for young students (Lin, Shih, and Sher 2007) 
or the application of PDAs in a company’s field sales force to create professionalism 
(Snowden et al. 2006). Two items were derived from Moore and Benbasat’s scale and two 
more items were added to indirectly measure the importance of prestige by aiming at the 
general wish for automotive innovations and the non-technical benefits of technical devices. 
This construct is labeled prestige because this is a common idea in the automotive space, e.g., 
when referring to premium brands. In line with Rogers, observability is acknowledged as “the 
degree to which the results of an innovation are visible to others" and therefore represents an 
important moderator of prestige. Usage of telematic services is less observable than xenon 
headlights or big wheels. Yet it appears to have similarities with mounted screens of 
navigation systems or the more discreet application when presenting the capabilities of the car 
to a colleague or neighbor (as mentioned in the expert interviews).  

 4.2 Rationale for proposed model factors 
73
H 6: 
Prestige is believed to account for a positive contribution on attitude 
toward/satisfaction with the system for nonusers/users. 
4.2.6 
Perceived enjoyment 
Perceived Enjoyment (PE) can be attributed to internal motivational factors. Its influence on 
playing computer games has been recognized early on (e.g. Holbrook et al. 1984), but Davis, 
Bagozzi, and Warshaw (1992) first contributed to the validation of this construct in the 
workplace setting. They defined perceived enjoyment in this context as “the extent to which 
the activity of using the computer is perceived to be enjoyable in its own right, apart from any 
performance consequences that may be anticipated.” Their original three-item scale is 
employed in the customer survey. Applications of the construct have repeatedly been 
performed in the area of online shopping (Childers et al. 2001; Cyr et al. 2007; Kim and 
Sandra 2007) and mobile phones (Lee, Cheung, and Zhaohui 2007; Turel, Serenko, and 
Bontis 2007). Van der Heijden (2004) differentiates web sites into utilitarian (productivity-
oriented) and hedonic (pleasure-oriented) approaches with the latter being more strongly 
predicted by enjoyment and ease-of-use than by perceived usefulness. The analyzed 
implementation of Connected Services offers both hedonic and utilitarian elements. This is 
also supported by internal marketing research of the OEM from 2006, where some customers 
claimed “play instinct” as their motivation to buy the system, besides “just owning the latest 
developments in vehicle technology.” 
H 7: 
A positive influence of perceived enjoyment on attitude toward/satisfaction 
with the system for nonusers/users is predicted.  
4.2.7 
Brand reputation of OEM and Connected Services  
To my best knowledge, brand reputation has not been included in technology acceptance 
literature yet. Brands, in general, represent a promise in the utilitarian sense – does the 
product perform as expected? – but also on the hedonic dimension – does it make me feel 
good? (Chaudhuri and Holbrook 2002). But while brands already play an important role in 
guiding consumers when deciding on the purchase of their next car, Connected Services are 
services, which are non-tangible by definition. Furthermore, after the sales process of the car 
itself, the services are completely free of any physical representation; therefore, customers 
“have more difficulty (sometimes to the point of futility) of reasonably assessing the potential 
harm and good will of others” for trust in an remote setting (Friedman, Kahn, and Howe 
2000, p.40). Features like emergency calls, which might save customer’s health and life, 
further increase the need for the supporting role of the brand in guiding such significant 
decisions. The OEM brand is also recognized as an indicator for the quality of information 

 4 Forming the conceptual framework into a research model 
74 
distributed (through the call-center or the browser portal), as interviews with customer 
showed: “To know the source [of information, e.g., Michelin Green Guide for restaurants] is 
not absolutely essential, because a supplier chosen by the OEM is in itself a guarantee of 
reliability" (internal marketing research). Friedman, Kahn, and Howe (2000) describe similar 
mechanisms of brands as trust generators in the online world. Very concretely stated in the 
automotive context, Richard Hudson, marketing director at BMW in the UK, concludes that 
“if the branding fails to capture consumers’ imaginations, BMW’s many technological 
advancements may come to nothing” (Brownsell 2008, p.23). On the other hand, there are 
customers who support the notion of BMW as an innovative brand when describing the 
relevance of Connected Services to them as “must have, although I actually do not need 
them” (internal marketing research of the OEM, 2005). 
In the context of this research project, a differentiation between the brand of the OEM and the 
name of the telematic product offering itself was introduced for three reasons. First, it is of 
interest whether customers do regard services as a separate entity, as a co-product of the car or 
whether they see product and service as one. Second, the separation is needed in order to 
investigate the potential spill-over effect from the OEM brand to the service reputation. Third, 
is there an influence the other way round: does the service evaluation influence the overall 
brand reputation? Put in a more general sense, can bundled services pay into their umbrella 
brand? Items for the OEM brand were selected from the company’s own brand measurement 
scales in the relevant categories. Items for brand trust were taken from Chaudhuri and 
Holbrook (2001a), while my own scales were developed for the product reputation based on 
the official communication style and strapline of the partner OEM.  
H 8: 
A positive influence of the service brand reputation is expected on attitude 
toward/satisfaction with the system for nonusers/users. 
H 9: 
A positive influence of the OEM brand reputation is expected on attitude 
toward/satisfaction with the system for nonusers/users. 
4.2.8 
Technology hedonism 
Because the exploratory research suggested several behavioral customer clusters, and 
variances in the usage activity level were anticipated, differences in the relevance of 
utilitarian and hedonic motivations are also expected. Some customers might regard 
technology very rationally as a tool to support or enable a concrete task. Others are also 
attracted by hedonic and not inherently required aspects like design, lifestyle appearance or 
image, which significantly contributed to the success of products from Apple (Olson, 
Czaplewski, and Slater 2005; Reppel, Szmigin, and Gruber 2006). A single item measured the 

 4.2 Rationale for proposed model factors 
75
degree of technology hedonism, which is assumed to be provided by the Connected Services 
analyzed.  
H 10: Technology hedonism is forecasted to positively influence attitude 
towards/satisfaction with the system for nonusers/users. 
4.2.9 
Price transparency and fairness 
The meaning of price fairness is commonly referred to as “a judgment of whether an outcome 
and/or the process to reach an outcome are reasonable, acceptable, or just” (Xia, Monroe, and 
Cox 2004). The influence of both price offer (as an outcome) and price procedure – as direct 
factors and simultaneously as indicators for the construct price fairness – on customer 
satisfaction has also been validated in the automotive context recently (Herrmann et al. 2007). 
The similar idea of a value-for-money construct has also proven significant in the context of 
SMS usage on mobile phones (Turel, Serenko, and Bontis 2007). There are good reasons to 
believe that price transparency precedes price fairness and was therefore measured through an 
additional single-item question in the survey, while pricing fairness was adapted to the 
situational context from Sweeney and Soutar (2001). Avlonitis and Indounas (2007) show in a 
cross-service industry analysis that service pricing strategies need customization in terms of 
different service, organizational and environmental characteristics. Also within the field of 
telematic services, pricing models are not yet determined: “The Skyway Systems’ aftermarket 
telematics service offering, available for most new Ford/Lincoln/Mercury vehicles and 
expected to see a wider dealer deployment later this year, is $20/month. Skyway executives 
say, however, that most customers are opting to pay on an annual basis at $199/year or to 
finance up to a five-year subscription as part of the new car purchase, including a free first 
year” (NN 2008). A trend toward flat rates as a risk mitigation (of higher prices) by the OEMs 
to promote trust building is also recognized in the wider area of remote services (Holtbrügge, 
Holzmüller, and von Wangenheim 2007, p. 131).  
H 11: Price fairness will positively influence attitude toward/satisfaction with the 
system for nonusers/users.  
4.2.10 
Attitude and satisfaction 
The concept of satisfaction is regarded as a central one for service companies for two reasons. 
First, it aggregates every experience and belief a user made with the offering throughout every 
stage of the customer lifecycle. In general, the idea of integrating customer satisfaction 
literature with IS research on technology acceptance and usage has been proposed only quite 
recently (Adamson and Shine 2003; Au, Ngai, and Cheng 2008; Wixom and Todd 2005). 

 4 Forming the conceptual framework into a research model 
76 
Second, satisfaction is a main prerequisite for continued use in voluntary usage settings as 
discussed here (Huber and Herrmann 2001; Keaveney and Parthasarathy 2001). Obviously, 
the treatment of non-users with no experience requires an adaptation and can only report 
customers’ attitude towards the service based on their knowledge from presentations, 
readings, referrals and such. For the measurement of this construct, I fell back on the 
satisfaction scale of Keaveney and Parthasarathy and adapted it for the measurement of 
“attitude towards the service.”  
H 12: A positive influence of a) attitude toward the system on intention to buy for 
nonusers and b) satisfaction with the system on intention to buy for nonusers is 
forecasted.  
In terms of mediation, I propose that attitude and satisfaction are able to account for a high 
share of variance, but not for all of it. Therefore, a partial mediation is hypothesized for both 
nonusers and users. The previously-stated hypotheses are expected to influence the respective 
dependent variables in the same way they influence the mediator. 
H 13: Partial mediation of a) attitude toward the system on intention to buy for 
nonusers and b) satisfaction with the system on intention to buy for users is 
hypothesized.  
4.3 
Hypothesis on (multi) group differences 
In terms of differences between nonusers and users, only two predictions for the main 
elements of TAM (Davis 1989), usefulness and ease of use, are made. Although Davis, 
Bagozzi, and Warshaw (1989) only cover users at their survey at time 0 and 14 weeks later, 
their findings support both predications: Also, in accordance with the findings of Rust, 
Thompson, and Hamilton (2006), usability will be of stronger influence for users than for 
nonusers. Ease of use only serves as a hygienic factor for nonusers, i.e., it might be a criterion 
for exclusion to some consumers, and a factor that will be only quickly evaluated by the rest 
of consumers. On the contrary, for users with product or service experience, usability can 
determine satisfaction and, in the long run, loyalty, or dissatisfaction and rejection. On 
perceived usefulness, an increasing influence of this factor for users compared to nonusers is 
suspected, in line with Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw (1989). It is also supplemented by the 
explorative research results, which portend to the full understanding of the personal use-case 
only after hands-on experience.  
H 14: Perceived ease of use will be of higher importance to users than nonusers. 
H 15: Perceived usefulness will be of higher importance to users than nonusers. 

 4.3 Hypothesis on (multi) group differences 
77
Usage, also serving as a proxy for experience, will further increase the relevance of perceived 
usefulness because experience fosters better understanding and a higher interest of more or 
more advanced features of the product or service. Naturally, a better fit with the personal 
requirements, or simply additional use-cases, will result.  
H 16: Perceived usefulness will be of higher importance to users with higher usage 
levels. 
Along the last two hypotheses, usefulness is also expected to be even stronger in the case of 
customers who recently canceled their contractual relationship with the OEM. The ultimate 
decision on actively ending the usage of Connected Services is therefore also seen as the 
result of a more rational than hedonic process.  
H 17: Perceived usefulness will be of higher importance to users who canceled the 
contract recently.

Data acquisition and preparation methodology 
The scope of this dissertation project required initial exploratory analysis to gain potential 
factors and measures from qualitative research, primary and secondary sources before 
quantitatively testing hypothesis. While chapter 3 reported on the results of the exploratory, 
qualitative research phase and chapter 4 synthesized those outcomes together with the 
findings of the respective literature streams, the present section describes the methodology of 
data acquisition. 
The initial questionnaire included items to cover all potential factors from literature review, 
but also from expert interviews and customer statements derived from personal exploratory 
research or from marketing research conducted by the partner OEM. In addition, the 
questionnaire featured themes like brand awareness, contract details and statistical data on 
driver and vehicle, totaling a maximum of 126 questions (depending on the classification into 
groups of users/canceled users/nonusers and their respective paths). Besides 8 open-ended 
text fields, close-ended questions with a Likert-5 scale with the anchors 1 = “fully agree” and 
5 = “fully disagree” and the statement “Don’t know” were used. Comprehensibility and 
required time were tested with 19 candidates from all user samples. The partner OEM 
requested the questionnaire to be completed in 15 minutes on average. Therefore, the final 
version of the questionnaire was shortened to a maximum of 83 items, including 6 open-
ended questions.  
Depending on a filter question on the experience with the system, active and canceled users 
and nonusers were guided through three versions of the questionnaire. Naturally, questions on 
cancellation or self-reported usage only appeared for the appropriate respondent groups. 
Furthermore, wording was slightly adapted to reflect users’ experience, e.g., “Based on your 
experience, how strong do you agree with the following statement: The usage of BMW 
ConnectedDrive was easy to learn,” whereas nonusers only referred to their attitude, e.g., 
“Please indicate how strong the following statement would apply to you: I think the usage of 
BMW ConnectedDrive would be easy to learn for me.” A list of the questionnaire items for 
users and nonusers is presented in the respective sections  5.5.2 and  5.6.2. 
All respondents were owners or users of a vehicle of our partner OEM in Germany and had 
vehicles no older than 3½ years. Key account customers and non-customer vehicles like test 
or demonstration cars were excluded. The sample was randomly drawn from the OEM 
database of four consumer groups:  

 5 Winning insights from quantitative data analysis 
80 
 
Customers having an active relationship through a contract with our partner OEM for 
telematic services  
 
Customers who canceled their contract, most of them recently, i.e., generally within 
the last 6 months before the survey, but some up to 15 months before (and one single 
case of 20 months) 
 
Customers who did not have a contract currently or in the past, but owned a vehicle 
capable of using telematic services, i.e., vehicles equipped with the necessary 
hardware installed 
 
Customers with a vehicle which was not capable of using telematic services. 
Email invitations were sent out in two stages in July 2008. An account of our partner OEM 
and the corporate design were utilized to stimulate customer responses. The invitation 
included a link to an online survey which, besides the survey itself, contained a short 
introduction with text, MMI screenshots and videos of the telematic product. This explanation 
was mandatory for respondents who had never used the system in their vehicle, but was also 
open to all others, i.e., customers with an active or canceled contract.  
As an incentive, respondents who finished the survey were entered into a drawing for three 
one-day driver trainings of our partner OEM. To foster quick responses, 50 USB sticks were 
additionally allotted for all responses within two days. Finally, out of 6.188 valid invitations 
(invalid email addresses, full email accounts or the like already deducted), 1.643 usable 
responses (fully completed and checked for logical validity and outliers) were received, 
resulting in a response rate of 27%. Given that web-surveys on average yield an 11% lower 
response rate than other modes (Manfreda et al. 2008), the result seemed very acceptable for a 
consumer survey. 
The web-survey was set to require all questions on a page to be answered before the 
respondent could continue to the next page, with the exception of open-ended comment fields 
and demographic/”cargraphic” questions. For this reason and because only fully completed 
questionnaires were proceeded, no missing values occurred in the core data set. A mean of 
3.23 questions were answered with “Don’t know,” with 1 as the median. Those values were 
replaced with the “series mean” method of SPSS 14.0.  
For the computation of the “Technology Readiness Index,” the raw data of the respondents to 
the 6-item scale were sent to the authors of the instrument, Parasuraman and Colby. They then 
provided the index value, the corresponding percentile of the 2007 U.S. sample, as well as the 
assignment to one of the five types of technology customer, as is described in their book on 
“techno-ready marketing” (Parasuraman and Colby 2001), which is thankfully acknowledged 
by the author.  

 5.1 Data acquisition and preparation methodology 
81
Actual usage data was derived from system log files of the service provider. The information 
was provided on a monthly basis per vehicle per service and 12 sub-services. As an example, 
5 information calls were performed in April 2008 from the vehicle with the vehicle 
identification number (VIN) E0476267, a 17-digit (or 7-digit in the short form), internationally 
standardized serial number of the vehicle. Information on the number of E-Call and B-Call 
occurrences was available but obviously such usage did not derive from a voluntary user 
decision. Likewise, the number of (automatically) received traffic messages did not involve 
any task of the driver. Consequently, these numbers were all excluded from further analysis, 
i.e., aggregated usage data indicating the number of activities per month only included 
requests which were deliberately initiated by the user. Activities of the BMW Online service 
were calculated as the number of sessions, i.e., how often the user activated the network 
connection and browser in the display of the vehicle. Since the TCU in the vehicle 
disconnected from the network after an inactivity period of five minutes, this measure can 
serve as a proxy of usage intensity. For the Internet portal usage, users have to log in to the 
portal with their user name and password. Therefore, the number of logins was taken as usage 
indicator.  
In total, a period of 11 months from September 2007 to July 2008 was retrieved, if the user 
did not cancel the contract in that period or a new user started later on. Usage data were then 
joined with survey data on the basis of the VIN. Besides the technical requirement, this 
method was compatible with the obligation to observe confidentiality, since no personal data 
was conveyed. In order to mitigate the risk of significant variations between respondents of 
the survey and the actual user, an item of the survey asked for the percentage of personal 
vehicle usage. The mean of 92.89 percent of personal vehicle usage of the respondents shows 
only a low risk of a systematic distortion.  
Actual usage data in depth (number of requests) and width (number of services used) were 
normalized to an index based on the average usage from a bigger sample of 29,676 vehicles. 
The absolute values were fabricated for two reasons. First, the transformation algorithm made 
every user in the sample comparable to each other, because not all users had subscribed (or 
had the technical prerequisites to use) all services provided. Second, the partner OEM 
obviously required measures to guarantee data confidentiality. As noted earlier, the small 
number of players in this market segment did not allow for other types of sanitizing the real 
identity of the OEM. Consequently, the figures used and referenced in this doctoral 
dissertation do not reveal any information which a competitor might exploit. As a matter of 
                                                 
7 The information on this specific vehicle can be revealed since this is the vehicle used by the author himself at that time.

82 
course, the power of statistical and modeling analyses remained unchallenged by any 
transformations applied.  
The tests for normal distribution revealed the majority of variables to showing non-normality. 
Consequently, difference tests were based on the Kruskal-Wallis method, since a better 
performance than the ANOVA test is especially noted with larger sample sizes (Khan and 
Rayner 2003), which is clearly the case here. For the structural equation modeling, an 
estimator considering non-normality was used. For the following analyses, SPSS 14.0 and 
Mplus version 5.1 were utilized.  
5.2 
Descriptive statistics of the sample 
This section intends to give a short overview on the descriptive side of the sample data. Basic 
information on the respondents, their evaluation of the system, and some analysis in 
conjunction with actual usage data are provided before the next section deals with structural 
equation modeling on the data set.  
5.2.1 
“The” average Connected Services customer  
All respondents were scrutinized on their demographic- and vehicle-related data in order to 
answer two questions: does the sample in general show differences to the overall population 
of this OEM, and are there differences within the sample, namely between nonusers, active 
users, and canceled customers? 
In terms of age (answers were given in six age brackets), respondents averaged about three 
years below the average age of new vehicle buyers of this brand. On the gender distribution, 
the share of women among respondents was only half of the equivalent for the OEM. 
Concerning the highest completed education, the share of the sample with a university degree 
was 30% higher than the OEM reference. All demographic OEM data originates from the 
(confidential) “National Car Buyer Survey” (NCBS) of 2007 for Germany, with n=3,295 for 
the OEM. Because raw data of the NCBS was not available, no tests of significance could be 
performed. But in any case, an overall tendency of Connected Services customers being 
younger, and to a higher share being male and better educated, can be noted, which 
corresponds to the arguments and hypotheses from the expert interviews.  
The average mileage of the vehicles of the survey was 25% above the average OEM value for 
kilometers per year, with some data points even exceeding 100,000 kilometers. Finally, the 
questionnaire asked for an indication of private versus business usage of the vehicle, which 
averaged at 56% business share across all respondents, who consisted of private and business 
individuals. Both attributes, mileage and business usage, support the behavioral customer 

 5.2 Descriptive statistics of the sample 
83
clustering introduced in Chapter 3: a considerable amount of customers’ usage seems to be 
motivated by profession and/or high vehicle usage. This assumption is further backed up by a 
Kruskal-Wallis difference test (K-W test) with the factor “usertype”: there are highly 
significant differences between users (active and canceled, n=934) and nonusers (n=709) of 
Connected Services, with the latter showing lower mileage and business usage shares. Maybe 
because of the lower business usage, which still exhibits a predominance of male employees, 
the share of women was also lower in the subsample users, with the difference also being 
highly significant. Age and education showed no significant differences between users and 
nonusers. 
To complete the picture, an analysis of the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) was 
performed, revealing an average of 113.2 for nonusers and 117.2 for users. For a grading of 
these results, a value of 100 was defined as the generic average in 1999, which makes values 
above 107 belonging to the upper third of consumers (normal distribution, for a description of 
the characteristics see Parasuraman and Colby (2001)). The comparison with the 2007 TRI 
survey confirms the notion by classifying the subsamples to be in the 65 and 71 percentile 
respectively. Therefore, an above-average technology affinity of all OEM vehicle owners can 
be concluded, and a rejection of Connected Services just because of general retentions 
towards technologies is not supported. 
5.2.2 
Findings on key survey elements 
In this section, some results of the survey and corresponding analyses are presented, with 
consideration of confidentiality issues on the one hand, and the role of being supportive in 
understanding the structural equation modeling section later on the other hand.  
A set of 7 items was used to measure respondents’ attitude towards the OEM brand. The 
means ranged from 1.46 to 2.1, with one item, “The OEM brand makes me happy,” being 
evaluated at 2.53. The K-W test revealed no differences among nonusers, active users, and 
canceled users.  
Three more items were used to capture the evaluation of BMW ConnectedDrive as a separate 
brand, with averages ranging from 1.98 and 2.28. Here, the K-W test derived a pattern which 
also arose from several of the subsequent evaluations and seemed to be plausible: active users 
exhibited the best evaluations, while canceled users were most critical of the system. 
Nonusers, who had no extensive experience with the system held beliefs and attitudes which 
classified somewhere in between active and canceled users. I will, from here on, refer to this 
pattern as typical.  

 5 Winning insights from quantitative data analysis 
84 
One research question, as proposed in the introductory chapter, referred to the correlation 
between the brand of the OEM and the brand of the Connected Services. For the total sample, 
Pearson’s correlation r was calculated for the single items described above, delivering 
significant (<0.01) results between 0.154 and 0.325. Of the 27 correlations, 5 showed values 
below 0.2, 20 were in the range between 0.2 and 0.3, and only 2 above 0.3. According to an 
older classification (Franzblau 1958), correlations between 0.2 and 0.4 may be regarded as 
indicating “a low degree of correlation.” Overall, and across all respondent groups, only a 
little interaction can be noted. Further analysis will be described in the respective SEM 
sections on individual group level. 
With regard to the evaluations towards usefulness and criticalness of the system, one feature, 
namely “In case of an emergency or breakdown situation, BMW ConnectedDrive is useful to 
me,” outperformed the other use-cases by a mean improvement of 0.84 on the Likert-5 scale 
compared to the second priority and a standard deviation, which was 19% lower. 
Additionally, no specific results emerged, i.e., the typical pattern recurred in the K-S tests 
between active and canceled users and nonusers. 
For the usability of the systems, means for three items ranged from 1.82 to 2.03 for the total 
sample. The K-W test revealed a significant (<0.05) and interesting difference for two of the 
items: nonusers displayed the best evaluations, whereas canceled users graded the system’s 
ease of use slightly worse. Eventually, active users were most critical in this dimension. 
Although their ratings still ranged from 1.92 to 2.09, the results support the concept of the n-
shaped correlation of experience and perceived usefulness, at least on a binary level between 
inexperienced and experienced users. In addition, ease of use, on average, seems not to 
alienate nonusers from system acceptance. 
A separate item probed the relevance of innovations in the vehicle (e.g., new features or 
improvements with regard to convenience, security or power train) in the purchase decision 
phase. While active users agreed strongly (mean of 1.48), canceled customers followed very 
closely (mean of 1.52), and nonusers also regarded innovations as important (mean of 1.68). 
Because the difference was highly significant, the outcome also replicated the findings from 
the Technology Readiness Index measurement and further encouraged the view that the 
majority of consumers did not reject BMW ConnectedDrive because of a general technology 
aversion or anxiety, whereas higher affinity fostered acceptance and usage. 
As a last perspective from the descriptive analysis, the potential of word-of-mouth was 
sampled among users. Respondents indicated an average number of 8.28 and 5.11 persons 
whom they have told about BMW ConnectedDrive or to whom they have demonstrated the 
system in the vehicle. Canceled customers displayed a lower but still considerable activity 
level. Because questions did not differentiate for positive and negative statements, the level of 

 5.3 Key analyses of actual usage data 
85
references and demonstrations was plotted against the satisfaction level, averaged from the 
three respective items. As Figure 16 depicts, word-of-mouth and demonstration engagement 
are, in line with common outcomes from research on marketing, generally driven by positive 
evaluations of the system. In addition, the absolute values indicate that customers do feel 
some intrinsic wish to engage with others about the system. Eventually, this might also be 
cause by extrinsic motivations, i.e., the search for prestige and image.  
 
Figure 16: Number of references and demonstrations of BMW ConnectedDrive 
5.3 
Key analyses of actual usage data 
For the following analyses, actual usage data was also drawn on a larger scale from the OEM 
to contrast, extend and validate the database from the survey sample. The covered period, 
selection criteria and data granularity were therefore comparable to the data, as described in 
section  5.1. The total sample included 29,676 active and canceled users.  
The first analysis intended to evaluate the quality of self-reported usage figures from the web-
survey. Customers were asked to indicate their average usage in one of 6 ranges with numbers 
of activities per month, separately for services of BMW Assist, BMW Online and access via 
the corresponding Internet portal on the PC. Because usage data was not available for all of 
the respondents, the sample consisted of 770 users for BMW Assist and the Internet portal 
and of 473 users for BMW Online. Difference between self-reported and actual usage was 
then calculated per user as the percentaged, absolute discrepancy between those two values, 
with percentage referencing to the actual usage value. Finally, the average was calculated 
from all discrepancy percentages. The results reveal the highest average discrepancy for users 
of the voice-based system, BMW Assist, with an average deviation of 437%. In the same line, 
utilization of the Internet portal was overvalued by customer with a deviation of 210%. For 
the online information portal in the vehicle, BMW Online, only a small deviation of 31% 
emerged from the analysis. These outcomes allow for two observations. First, the mean of 

 5 Winning insights from quantitative data analysis 
86 
interaction seems to have a different quality and sustainability in the perception of users. 
Naturally, the typical use case for leveraging BMW Assist is less frequent and very often 
unpredictable, e.g., the search for a restaurant because a business meeting lasted longer than 
expected in an unknown city. In any case, the multi-channel process of interaction through a 
call center agent and the feedback in the form of contact data sent into the car might be more 
strongly impressed in the customer’s mind than the last search activity in the vehicle browser. 
As an example from daily life, the number of calls made to a yellow page directory through 
the mobile phone will, for most people, also be more recognizable (and countable) than the 
number of times the calendar or even the SMS feature was accessed. The second observation 
refers to the validity of self-reported usage: besides the already discussed risk of common 
method variance, the findings from this analysis allow for sounding another note of caution, 
when no actual usage data are available.  
The second analysis aimed at the understanding of the customer groups according to the 
preferred type of service or communication channel. The previous analysis already indicated 
different customer perceptions of BMW Assist as an instance of remote services, and BMW 
Online as an example of self-service technologies. In the same line, a recurring hypothesis in 
the expert interviews was the existence of customer groups, which preferred to only use one 
or the other channel, e.g., because of technology anxiety or a resentment against utilizing or 
speaking to service employees. The usage data on a broad scale allowed scrutiny of usage 
clusters as displayed in Figure 17.

The left side of the figure shows the breakdown of the relevant subsample which had access

Internet. Those users who did not show any usage during the observation period of 11 months 
were labeled “null users” and excluded from analysis. For the remaining active users, average 
usages, which represented the reference values for this analysis, are depicted in the topmost 
block on the right hand side of the figure. The next bar on the left side, and the corresponding 
block on the right side, show that users who leverage all three types of services (representing 
54% of all users) are also the most active users of all. Following are those voice-centric users, 
who only use services of BMW Assist and the Internet portal; while this group is smaller, its 
usage of BMW Assist is also below the average value of this service, despite its customers’ 
reliance on only this single channel. BMW Online users, on the other hand, are an even 
smaller group, and their average usage matches neither the average of all users nor the 
average of the group which leverages all services. Finally, a negligible group of customers 
only uses the services via the Internet portal. As a conclusion, the existence of user groups 
favoring or completely focusing on one type of services or communication can be confirmed, 
whereas their relevance in terms of customer share and usage intensity does not exceed the 
group of customers who turn on the complete portfolio.  
The third analysis also contributes to the notion of Schwarz and Chin (2007), who argue for a 
wider definition and incorporation of usage than the commonly used measure of extent or 
frequency of use. The data set involved a representative sample of 10,415 users, where their 
usage behavior was disaggregated on the level of 12 individual services, whereas 5 services 
(in this case including E-/B-Call) were attributed to BMW Assist, 6 services to BMW Online, 
and the Internet portal was a service on its own. The covered usage period was 6 months.

The chart shows that in both groups roughly ¾ of the users utilize 1/3 of the services offered 
on a regular basis, which was defined as more than once every two months. The next question 
arises immediately, namely whether the just-described majority of customers also show the 
highest usage intensity. Figure 19 plots the correlation between number of services used on 
the x-axis and the average number of activities per month (i.e., usage intensity) for customers 
with Assist and web services access (on the left side) and users with access to all services (on 
the right side).

Figure 19: Correlation between usage intensity and width 
Both graphs and the strength of the correlation signify a relation from the width of the utilized 
service portfolio to the intensity of usage. This corresponds to the notion of Schwarz (2007) 
that, particularly, users with intrinsic motivations will not only show high usage intensity but 
also a high level of explorative usage. Although there are good reasons to believe the 
causality goes from width to intensity, intensity in the sense of frequency of requests seems to 
be a plausible proxy usage in modeling technology acceptance. 
The fourth analysis looks at vehicle types as a proxy of potential moderators for usage 
intensity and also for loyalty. Figure 20 depicts the different vehicles series with the x-axis 
representing the base price of the cheapest model of each series and the average usage 
intensity shown on the y-axis. The size of the bubbles stands for the loyalty of this customer 
group as measured by the ratio of customer share of this vehicle series divided by the share of 
this vehicle series’ canceled customers. Consequently, a ratio of 1 would represent the fair 
share of canceled customers, as it is almost the case for the 3-series vehicles. A ratio above 1, 
in a bigger bubble, is shaded in dark green and indicates a loyalty above average, whereas a 
ratio below 1, in a smaller bubble, is colored in light green and shows a disproportionately 
high share of canceled customers.

Figure 20: Moderators of actual usage intensity (n=29,676) 
Three comments arise from the figure: on the one hand, there seems to be a negative 
correlation between price of the vehicle and usage intensity. I argue for age and “relative 
investment” or “decision commitment” as underlying, causal factors. Price only serves as a 
proxy for spending power, which in turn is generally highly correlated with age, which will be 
separately evaluated in the next analysis. The decision for the required hardware to use BMW 
ConnectedDrive is, financially speaking, a fundamental one, especially if the base price of the 
vehicle is in the lower end. The full package (full featured navigation and handsfree set) 
amounts to almost 20% of the base price for a buyer of a 1-series vehicle, whereas it only 
represents 4% for a 7-series buyer, and even less if the top-range model with the largest 
engine is selected. Therefore, if a buyer of a lower-priced vehicle nonetheless selects 
telematic services, a higher involvement in the pre-purchase phase can be assumed. This 
assumption is also supported by the cost-benefit paradigm, which, ceteris paribus, requires a 
high expected benefit to compensate for the costs. Eventually, a benefit can only be realized 
and assessed after an information search has been performed. As an extreme example on the 
other hand, buyers of a high-priced vehicle sometimes simply decide on the full-fledged 
vehicle, i.e., they select all options available, without too much involvement upfront. I label 
this attribute the “decision commitment” effect. For the completeness of this argument, the 
change of the product offering from being sold separately, to an integrated bundling with the 
navigation/handsfree system, might diminish the predictive power of “decision commitment,” 
because a clear distinction between buyers who became customers because the services were 
simply integrated, and buyers who intentionally selected the service, is no longer possible. 
The second comment on the figure concerns loyalty which, besides the outstanding figure for 
1-series vehicles, seems not to be correlated with price (as a proxy of age). Finally, the last 
comment is directed towards the dependent variable of technology acceptance models: the 
figure is a strong argument for extending the acceptance view towards continuous usage. All 

 5 Winning insights from quantitative data analysis 
90 
customers shown on the chart have previously accepted the services, but significantly differ in 
terms of usage and, ultimately, loyalty with the service. 
With regards to age as a potential moderator, its influence has been tested as a factor in a K-W 
test on the evaluative items of the questionnaire. Out of 39 items, 27 items were tested 
significantly (<0.05) and 12 items, including all on satisfaction or attitude toward the 
system, showed no significant influence of age. The descriptive analysis confirmed the 
expected, negative correlation, i.e., older respondents indeed valued the attributes of the 
system less favorably, with one notable exception: on most instances, survey respondents of 
the oldest age bracket (66 years and above), and sometimes even on the age bracket before 
(56-65 years) represented a turning point with their evaluations getting slightly better, 
although not matching the next younger group’s value. Time constraints of the working 
generation until their retirement might be an explanatory factor, though it could not be further 
analyzed in this thesis project. 
The preceding analysis already referred to loyalty in terms of renewal rates. The fifth analysis 
on actual usage data further scrutinizes usage behavior from a longitudinal perspective. More 
specifically, the timeframe of 6 months before, and in the case of renewing customer, also in 
the 3 months after the “moment of truth,” where the contractual relationship was either 
dissolved or renewed by the customers, was reviewed. While the data set allowed for a very 
solid base for the canceled customers (n=5.149) at the month 0, only 60 instances of 
customers were derived due to the tight selection criteria of a 9-month time frame out of an 
11-month coverage period. Consequently, the analysis described in Figure 21 requires a word 
of caution on the validity of generalized conclusions at the beginning.

 5.3 Key analyses of actual usage data 
91
The orange data lines with bubbles refer to customers who canceled at the month 0, the 
“moment of truth,” whereas the blue lines with the squares designate customers who then 
renewed their contract. The left axes of all three diagrams describe the average monthly usage 
intensity, whereas the right axis of the left diagram refers to the corresponding share of null 
users, i.e., customers who did not utilize the system in the respective month. The left diagram 
shows decreasing usage intensity among both groups towards the month 0, with a higher 
usage level of those customers who later renewed. But the average intensity is obviously 
influenced by the level of null users, which reveals a much higher share among canceled 
customers throughout the whole time period, as depicted on the second axis. Correcting for 
the level of null usages or users (which inherently reduces the sample sizes) derives two 
graphs on the right hand side, the upper with the average intensity measured without any null 
values, the lower with the less restrictive exclusion of those customers, who did not show any 
activity throughout all 6 or 9 months of observation. In any case, no clear difference between 
loyal customers and customer at risk can be found from the level of usage intensity. But there 
is a highly significant difference in the level of “total null users,” which amounts to 23% for 
renewal customers but up to 49% for canceled customers. Overall, it seems that in this context 
of Connected Services, a binary attribute of usage or no usage during the customer lifecycle is 
a better predictor of customer churn than the absolute level of usage. As well, it seems that the 
stimulation or reminder of the customer through the information six weeks before the renewal 
point, and the decision for the contract prolongation, trigger higher usage intensity, as seen by 
the decreasing usage intensities in the months after such customer touchpoints with the OEM. 
The sixth and last analysis very briefly looked at the role of critical incidents as another type 
of stimulation of customers’ loyalty. More concretely, the role of emergency and breakdown 
calls as moderators of loyalty were tested. A crosstabulation between active and canceled 
customers on the one hand, and on the activation of at least one E-/B-call, revealed an 
influence of the breakdown call. The cancellation rate of customers who used the breakdown 
service in the past (n=1,683) was 62%, a highly significant reduction, below the rate of 
customers who did not use the feature throughout the observation period (n=several 10,000). 
With regard to the effect of the emergency call service, no significant influence was found. 
This outcome might be attributed to the very low sample size of 23 occurrences on the one 
hand, and to the assumed severity of the emergency situations on another. This hypothesis is 
supported by the fact that 48% of the service contracts of those vehicles were canceled within 
6 months and ¾ thereof even within 3 months after the E-call was deployed, indicating a sale 
or return of the repaired or destroyed vehicle. Obviously, both findings cannot be translated 
into direct marketing measures, but they show how important it is to make customers or 
respondents fully understand, and in the best case to experience by trial, the use-cases and 
benefits. This notion is valid for both academics and practitioners for their methodology

Fundamentals of Structural Equation Modeling 
“Structural equation modeling” (SEM) has gained popularity since the beginning of the 80s 
and the publication of two separate articles from Bentler and Bagozzi (Bagozzi 1980; Bentler 
1980). While the methods were originally used for the adjustment from measurement errors in 
psychology and social sciences research, its wider application in marketing, organizational 
and management research can be recognized in recent years, since the results from SEM 
generally promise higher validity than regression analyses, if applied correctly (Hildebrandt 
and Temme 2005). SEM is sometimes also referred to as “causal modeling” or “covariance 
structure modeling,” which might be deceptive in the first case and not completely exhaustive 
in the latter case. According to philosophy of science, causality can only be tested in 
controlled experiments and not though statistical methods (Ilzarbe 2004, p.30), and the model 
not only handles covariance but can also include means of factors or observed variables. 
Likewise, the name “Lisrel-models” is also defined too narrowly: one of the first and most 
popular programs was called LISREL, an abbreviation for LInear Structural RELations. 
Today, structural equation models do not need to be linear, and several other programs 
including AMOS, CALIS, EQS or Mplus have been established on the market (Baumgartner 
and Homburg 1996; Hox and Bechger 1998).  
The generic concept of SEM relies on customers’ evaluation of product- or company specific 
attributes (“factor indicators”) as measurements for underlying factors, also called “latent 
factors,” which in turn are relevant determinants of an economic target parameter, e.g., sales 
or usage of a product or service. Within this use-case, SEM, on the one hand, allows for the 
validation of the measurement model, and on the other hand for testing the hypothesis on how 
determinants impact the dependent variable, the “structural model” (Hildebrandt and Temme 
2005). 
For a short and non-technical introduction, the article of Hox and Bechger is a good starting 
point and also includes a reference set on introductory and advanced books and journals (Hox 
and Bechger 1998). An exhaustive and syntactically stringent description of structural 
equation models can be found in the doctoral thesis of Ilzarbe (2004). The article of Homburg 
and Giering (Homburg and Giering 1996) addresses the challenges of reliability and validity 
when measuring complex constructs, and proposes a stepwise approach in the 
conceptualization and implementation. The authors also cover the evaluation of the observed 
variables and factors of the model, as the next section will report on. For the evaluation and 

 5.5 Modeling technology acceptance for nonusers 
93
recommendations on the model fit indices, the publication of Hu and Bentler (1998) will be 
followed.  
In terms of meta-analyses on the application of SEM, the work of Baumgartner and Homburg 
on SEM in marketing and consumer research (Baumgartner and Homburg 1996) reviewed 
145 journal contributions from 1975 to 1994. While the authors found several problem areas 
in terms of specification, data screening and estimation and testing issues (and give respective 
recommendations), they conclude that “on balance researchers have put the powerful 
capabilities of SEM to good use and that empirical work has benefited from the application of 
this methodology” (p.159). In continuation of this meta-analysis, Hildebrandt and Temme 
(2005) survey the most important German-speaking journals in the wider area of business 
research. Their findings on 45 articles from 1990 to 2003 are critical with regard to a 
transparency that is sometimes lacking or a reckless application of minimum sample sizes, 
used estimator methods and corresponding underlying data distributions, and reported fit 
indices. These findings underpin the double-sided impact of the SEM development: while 
computing power and relatively user-friendly software made the application of structural 
equation models manageable, which “can have a positive impact on substantive research […] 
they also make it more easy to misuse these techniques” (Hox and Bechger 1998, p.14). With 
these words of caution in mind, the next section describes the application of SEM on the 
quantitative data from web survey and corresponding usage data in the context of automotive 
Connected Services.

5.5.1 
Data preparation 
For all subsequent modeling analyses, the data set generated through the web survey 
(n=1,643) was split into two groups: nonusers and users, because different motivations for 
acceptance and usage were assumed (Bhattacherjee 2001), and were also considered in the 
questionnaire design. The allocation was based on the self-report of customers on the status of 
the core service bundle, BMW Assist. Respondents who never had access to this service 
bundle or did not even know the name of it were classified as nonusers (n=709), whereas 
active (contractual) and former (canceled) customers of the service bundle were classified as 
users (n=934). The selection of the BMW Online was not relevant for the classification 
because this service bundle was only distributed on top, i.e., BMW Assist was a prerequisite 
to use BMW Online. Some respondents did not fulfill the selection criteria of the usage logs, 
which were queried independently and in parallel to the customer survey. Therefore, for those 

 5 Winning insights from quantitative data analysis 
94 
188 customers no usage data could be joined to the survey data, leaving 746 users where the 
data set also included actual usage data for the previous 11 months.  
Before an explorative factor analysis was performed, three tests were executed to ensure that 
the extraction of factors was possible at all. First, normality assumption of the data was tested 
through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test with the null hypothesis of normal distribution. As 
expected, and as indicated earlier, the null hypothesis was rejected for all variables in the 
nonuser data set. Second, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was 
calculated as an index, which compares the magnitudes of the observed correlation 
coefficients to the magnitudes of the partial correlation coefficients. The result showed a 
satisfactory level of 0.890, which still falls in the category “in the 80s” and attributed as 
“meritorious” by Kaiser himself (Kaiser 1974, p.35). Third, as an additional criterion for the 
relationship strength between the variables, Bartlett's test of sphericity was employed. The 
check for the null hypothesis that all variables in the population correlation matrix are 
uncorrelated was rejected at the 0.1% significance level.  
5.5.2 
Deriving a factor structure  
The individual indicators, as measured through the multiple items of the survey, are 
hypothesized to be related with the underlying constructs. Therefore, empirical validation is 
required to ensure the appropriate measurement (Schnell, Hill, and Esser 1999, p.125ff). The 
explorative factor analysis (EFA) offers the evaluation of these relations without requiring a-
priori hypothesis about the factor structure (Homburg and Giering 1996, p.8). The method 
compresses the separate indicators to factors, which allows for a first evaluation of convergent 
and discriminant validity by reviewing the strength of the factor loadings. All indicators of a 
factor are required to load at a satisfactory level of 0.4 or above, while the loadings on all the 
other factors have to be relatively low to avoid cross-loadings (Homburg and Giering 1996, 
p.8). For the nonuser sample, some items were excluded from further analysis because they 
failed to fulfill this criterion, e.g., the use-case of emergency and breakdown calls. This factor 
indicator was also conspicuous compared to the evaluation of the other use-cases in terms of 
mean and variance, as described in the descriptive statistics section. 
The explorative factor analysis for the nonuser sample results in a 6-factor solution, according 
to the suggested cutoff point for the Eigenvalue of 1.0 (Kaiser 1974). The solution, which was 
rotated with the Promax algorithm, and the corresponding Eigenvalues, are shown in Figure 
22.

The solution does confirm the measurement of the factors as expected, with the exception of 
the items of the assumed factors prestige and perceived enjoyment, which are not separated in 
the 6-factor solution. A separation into two factors is therefore derived from the calculation of 
an explorative factor analysis with 7 factors. The outcome is depicted in Appendix 8 and, 
together with the theoretical separation of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, approves the 
break-up of the factor structure, which will be used for the subsequent analyses and reliability 
evaluation. The used variables and potential moderator variables are listed in

To ensure the internal consistency reliability of the indicators allocated to one factor, the 
coefficient or Cronbach’s alpha is used. Computed values range from 0 to 1, with high 
reliability denoted by proximity to one. While an often referenced source (Nunnally 1978, 
p.245) offers a minimum threshold of 0.7, newer references lower the requirement to 0.6 
(Peter 1997, p.180), especially if the factor consists of only two or three indicators. Figure 24 
depicts the pool of indicators and Cronbach’s alpha for the corresponding factors, which all 
surpass the suggested minimum values of 0.6 and, with the exception of “Perceived 
Criticalness,” even match the stricter recommendation of 0.7.

Figure 24: Nonuser EFA quality criteria 
Figure 24 also exhibits the “item-to-total” (ITT) correlation for all indicators, which is defined 
as the correlation between one indicator and the sum of all other indicators allocated to the 
same factor. According to Bearden, Netemeyer, and Teel (1989, p.475), the item-to-total 
correlation should reach or exceed 0.5. If factors do not meet Cronbach’s alpha, the 
indicator(s) with the lowest ITT should be excluded to raise the coefficient alpha (Enders 
2004, p.92). For the nonuser sample with 26 indicators, 22 exceed the suggested minimum 
value, while the remaining 4 slightly miss the threshold, but are legitimized by the previously 
satisfied Cronbach’s alpha value. 
Finally, the “squared multiple correlation” evaluates the indicator reliability, i.e., how well the 
latent factor is described by each individual indicator (Zinnbauer and Eberl 2004, p.7). The 
authors list two references for a rule of thumb: on the one hand, Bagozzi and Baumgartner 
(1994, p. 402) suggest 0.5 as minimum value, but Balderjahn (1986, p.117) decreases the 
hurdle to the minimum range of 0.1 to 0.2 when working with large samples (n>1,000). In the 
light of these suggestions, the evaluation of the nonuser sample fulfills the 0.5 threshold for 
the majority of indicators, whereas seven items only meet the lower of the suggested 
thresholds (Balderjahn 1986), despite the sample size being somewhat below the indicated 
1,000 cases.  

 5.5 Modeling technology acceptance for nonusers

5.5.3 
Confirming the factor structure 
In the next step, the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) reviews the remaining indicators and 
factors from the previous steps. In contrast to the exploratory factor analysis, hypothesis about 
the factor structure and the corresponding indicators are inputted to the analysis. The CFA 
produces a measurement model, where the model parameters are estimated in the best way to 
align the generated covariance matrix with the covariance matrix of the empirical data 
(Enders 2004).  
For this calculation, an appropriate estimator method had to be selected from the wide range 
of estimators available in today’s software packages. In their meta-analysis of SEM 
applications, Baumgartner and Homburg (1996) find a clear dominance of the “maximum 
likelihood” (ML) technique with about 95% of the 184 studies using this estimator. The 
authors highlight the requirement of normal distribution, whose existence they question for 
most of the reviewed applications. But “asymptotically distribution-free” methods (like 
“weighted least square”) are acknowledged not to be preferable to the maximum likelihood 
estimator. In the same line, in an earlier publication (Homburg and Baumgartner 1995b, 
p.1102), they also see ML clearly superior to the “unweighted least squares” (ULS) method. 
The newer meta-analysis of Hildebrandt and Temme, which finds the ULS method to be 
widely distributed, seems therefore to be a particularity of the reviewed German-speaking 
research literature (Hildebrandt and Temme 2005, p.60). The used statistical program Mplus 
in the version 5.1 also offers an estimator called “MLR,” a maximum likelihood parameter 
which “estimates with standard errors and a chi-square test statistic (when applicable) that are 
robust to non-normality and non-independence of observations” (Muthén and Muthén 2007, 
p.484).  
The results of the confirmative factor analysis for the nonuser sample are exhibited in Figure 
25. The first columns show the standardized, estimated factor loadings together with the 
standard error of estimation, which allows for the calculation of the also shown significance 
of loadings. Those t-values are used for testing the convergent validity with the value required 
to reach or exceed 1.96 at the common 5% significance level (Backhaus et al. 2003, p.74). All 
indicators from the sample clearly match the requirement even at the 0.1% significance level 
(t  3.3).

Figure 25: Nonuser CFA including quality criteria 
With the CFA results, the previously analyzed reliability of the individual indicators can now 
be replicated on the factor level with the “factor reliability” and the “average variance 
extracted” indices. Both fit indices are measures of the adaptation, i.e., how well the factor is 
measured by the allocated indicators (Enders 2004, p.100), and range from 0 to 1 representing 
the optimum value with zero variance of all measurement errors. Homburg and Giering 
(Homburg and Giering 1996, p.13) postulate a minimum threshold of 0.6 and 0.5. For the 
nonuser sample, factor reliability turns out to be satisfactory for all factors, whereas average 
variance extracted falls below the recommendation in three cases.  
To complete the analysis of reliability and validity, discriminant validity indicates how 
independent the developed factors are from each other, based on empirical data support. The 
test, therefore, shows whether different factors do indeed measure different aspects of the 
model. While the Chi² test is often referenced, the Fornell-Larcker test or ratio is more 
rigorous (Enders 2004; Zinnbauer and Eberl 2004) and therefore is applied first. The test 
requires the average variance extracted to be higher than any squared correlation of this factor 
with all other factors. Dividing the latter value by the first one reveals a ratio which is 
therefore required to be below 1 (Fornell and Larcker 1981, p.46). Because all factors of the 
nonuser data set conform to the Fornell-Larcker ratio, the less severe Chi² test is not required 
for this sample.

Model validation and results 
The structural equation model builds on the previously performed CFA, with the notable 
difference that the SEM requires the specification of directional relations between the factors. 
Based on this specification, the corresponding factor loadings, path coefficients and 
variances/covariances are estimated, in this case again based on the MLR estimator. The 
output of Mplus also includes the standard errors and the critical ratio, which results from 
dividing the estimate by its standard error, and the corresponding two-tailed p-value. In the 
following path diagram, standardized path coefficients and their standard errors are exhibited 
on the arrows. Significance levels of 10%, 5%, 1% and 0.1% are marked with +, *, **, and 
*** respectively, whereas path coefficients below the 10% threshold are marked with n.s. (not 
significant). Furthermore, the mean of the factors is displayed directly in the constructs.  
The dependent variables “attitude towards the system” and “intention to buy” and the factors 
“price transparency,” “price fairness,” “car innovation valuation” and “technology hedonism” 
were measured through single-items in the customer survey, and can be reviewed in  
Figure 23. In a recent publication, Bergkvist and Rossiter (2007) compare the predictive 
validity of multiple-item (three items) versus single-item measures and find no difference for 
brand and advertising attitude as concrete and singular objects. The authors even suggest that 
the findings “should generalize to other concrete attributes, such as beliefs of perceptions, 
intentions, and satisfaction” (Bergkvist and Rossiter 2007, p.183).  
Figure 26 shows the structural equation model for the nonuser sample and derives five factors 
to be of significant influence for attitude towards the system. While PU rendered to be the 
strongest factor with 0.251, the other factors follow closely. Because partial mediation was 
expected, there are also paths from the significant factors to “intention to buy,” with the one 
from CS brand being not significant and therefore not shown in the diagram. In terms of 
prediction power, the model accounts for 0.516 of the observed variance from attitude, and 
0.524 of intention to buy. A discussion of the outcomes, together with the results from the 
user sample and the subsequent multi-group models, follows at the end of this chapter.

Figure 26: Nonuser structural equation model  
The fit indices of the previous sections covered reliability and validity of the indicators or 
factors and are therefore considered “local fit indices.” For the evaluation of the overall 
structural model, “global fit indices” are leveraged. The basic concept of all global criteria is 
to compare the variance/covariance matrix generated by the model with the 
variance/covariance matrix of the empirical sample. The lower the difference between those 
matrices, the better the corresponding global fit index (Zinnbauer and Eberl 2004).  
In general, there are a wide array of global fit indices available in software packages and 
respective publications on SEM (Hildebrandt and Temme 2005; Homburg and Giering 1996; 
Hox and Bechger 1998). Homburg and Baumgartner also provide a good overview and 
classification of most fit indices (Homburg and Baumgartner 1995a, p.165). For the 
evaluation of the subsequent models, this doctoral thesis relies on the indices as recommended 
by Hu and Bentler (1998). The authors analyzed the sensitivity of fit indices, whereas most 
previous studies on fit indices assumed that the model is also correct. According to Hu and 
Bentler, “a good index should approach its maximum under correct specification but also 
degrade substantially under misspecification” (Hu and Bentler 1998, p.424), a characteristic 
which they call sensitivity. Their findings suggest that with maximum likelihood methods, the 
use of SRMR together with TLI, CFI and RMSEA is preferred. 
The commonly referred Chi² test is almost always rejected (with a p-value < 0.05) if sample 
sizes are sufficiently large (Hox and Bechger 1998; Zinnbauer and Eberl 2004). The test has 
also other shortcomings, which is discussed at length in various studies (Bagozzi and 
Baumgartner 1994; Förster et al. 1984; Homburg and Giering 1996). Consequently, this 
criterion is not further evaluated. On the contrary, the standardized fit index will be included 

 5.5 Modeling technology acceptance for nonusers 
103
as suggested by Jöreskog and Sörbom (1982, p.408), the developers of the SEM model and 
software LISREL. This index results from dividing the chi² value by the degrees of freedom 
of the model. In terms of the recommended threshold, Zinnbauer and Eberl call on a 
publication by Wheaton et al. (1977) for a cutoff value of 5. Homburg and Giering state a 
stricter threshold, which requires the Chi²/df-ratio to be smaller than 3 (Homburg and Giering 
1996, p.13).  
The remaining fit indices all consider the degree of freedom, since neglecting this influence 
might tolerate over-parameterization and therefore significantly limit their evaluative power 
(Zinnbauer and Eberl 2004, p.11). RMSEA (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation) was 
originally developed by Steiger and Lind (1980) and converges to zero when indicating a 
good approximation between hypothesized model and observed reality. Hu and Bentler 
suggest “a cutoff value close to 0.06 for RMSEA” (Hu and Bentler 1998, p.449), although 
they also quote the commonly used range from 0.05 to 0.08 of Browne and Cudeck (1993) as 
reasonable, and values below 0.05 as a close fit. SRMR (Standardized Root-Mean-square 
Residual) was developed by Bentler (1995) and the values are also tending to zero for a good 
model fit. For SRMR, Hu and Bentler suggest “a cutoff value close to 0.08” (1998, p.449).  
The NNFI (Non-Normed Fit Index) is also referred to as TLI (Tucker-Lewis Index), named 
after its authors (Tucker and Lewis 1973). An acceptable threshold for this index is 0.9 
(Baumgartner and Homburg 1996, p.153). Finally, the CFI (Comparative Fit Index) was 
developed by Bentler (1990; 1995), the developer of the SEM software EQS. While Homburg 
and Baumgartner consider values of 0.9 or higher as a good model fit (Homburg and 
Baumgartner 1995a, p.170), they also see the general evaluative power of CFI as weak, as it 
incrementally compares the fit to a base model which features an intentionally low fit, 
because all variables are assumed to be uncorrelated (Zinnbauer and Eberl 2004). Zinnbauer 
and Eberl also find application and interpretation of TLI to be questioned in other research 
projects.  
After the introduction of these global fit indices, and the local fit indices in the previous 
sections, a recommendation on accepting, modifying or rejecting the proposed model can be 
derived. However, there are only rules of thumb – no absolute thresholds for acceptance or 
rejection exist to replace the researcher’s final judgment (Ilzarbe 2004). With this word of 
caution, Fritz (1995, p.143) proposes a framework wherein the global fit indices represent the 
first hurdle. Models where those values are not fulfilled should be rejected. Local fit indices 
represent the second hurdle: if they are completely fulfilled, the model should be accepted; if 
fulfilled for the majority of indices (>50%), the model should be accepted tentatively and 
modifications might be applied; and in the case of non-fulfillment of 50% or more, the model 
should be rejected. Overall, structural equation models should naturally try to fulfill all global

104 
and local fit indices. Nevertheless, small deviations can be overlooked because, in the end, the 
whole picture – guided by theory and hypothesis, and supported by a variety of fit indices – 
accounts for a good modeling approach (Homburg and Giering 1996; Sträter 2008).  
For the nonuser sample, Figure 27 displays all fit indices discussed above. All indices clearly 
surpass both recommended minimums, but also the more restrictive thresholds, and therefore 
indicate an adequate fit of the overall model.

Figure 27: Nonuser global fit indices 
In the proposed model, as previously shown in Figure 26, the determinants are influencing the 
dependent variable “intention to buy” in a direct manner, but also as mediated through 
“attitude towards the system.” Mediation is defined as a “function of a third variable, which 
represents the generative mechanism through which the focal independent variable is able to 
influence the dependent variable of interest” (Baron and Kenny 1986, p.1173). The direct and 
indirect influence in the model therefore represents a partial mediation. For the validation of 
this assumption, Baron and Kenny propose a method in four steps, as described in their article 
on moderator and mediator effects (Baron and Kenny 1986). In their notion, (1) the check for 
whether the independent variable (IV) has a significant influence “c0” on the dependent 
variable (DV) is not mentioned, but discussed in recent considerations. Step (2) checks for 
significance of the path “a” from the IV to the mediator. Step (3) requires the path “b” from 
the mediator to the dependent variable to be significant. The final step (4) then checks 
whether the path “c’” from the IV to the DV is zero (or non-significant) for a full mediation. 
If “c” does not become zero (or non-significant), a decrease from c0 to c’ supports a partial 
mediation. Figure 28 shows the test results for the nonuser sample and confirms the 
assumption of partial mediation of all determinants.

Different from mediation, there are also various potential moderators of the paths from the

Figure 29: Nonuser moderation tests 
Of the moderating variables, three relationships should be highlighted. First, the factor vehicle 
class strengthens the notion of a proxy for buying power and age: nonusers tend to devalue 
the Connected Services brand and are more concerned about critical issues (measured on a 
reversed scale). In contrast, and not aligned with recent research findings, older vehicle 
owners agree more strongly with the statements on perceived enjoyment from using the 
system. Second, women evaluate the usefulness of the system higher than do men, and they 
are also less alienated by critical issues. Third, an increasing share of business usage 
negatively influences the notion of the Connected Services brand and of the perceived 
enjoyment, and also raises the concerns on critical issues. These moderations seem plausible 
in the light of the more rational motivations of those customers, and a generally higher 
sensibility for (data) risks in a business context.  
In section  5.2.2 the correlation between the brand on the OEM and service level was analyzed 
and found to be weak, at best, on the total sample level. For the nonuser sample, a correlation 
of 0.354 (see Appendix 12) between the latent constructs is somewhat higher, but still 
indicates “a low degree of correlation” (Franzblau 1958).

Modeling technology acceptance and usage for users 
While the previous section described at length the structural equation model of the nonuser 
subsample, this section covers the user sample (n=934) very precisely. Unless otherwise 
noted, the methodology and assumptions from the nonuser sample are replicated and can be 
referred to in the previous section.

5.6.1 
Data preparation 
The evaluation of the data set for normality with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test was rejected 
for all variables. The KMO measure of sampling adequacy derived a very satisfactory level of 
0.916, which Kaiser attributes as “marvelous” (Kaiser 1974, p.35). Bartlett's test of sphericity 
clearly rejected the null hypothesis of no correlations in the sample correlation matrix.  
5.6.2 
Deriving a factor structure 
The same items as in the nonuser sample were leveraged for the explorative factor analysis of 
the user sample, besides the additional three satisfaction items, which replaced the nonusers’ 
attitude item. The corresponding output with the factor loadings is shown in Appendix 9. All 
items loaded with a value of 0.4 or higher with the exception of the three indicator measures 
for the construct “perceived criticalness,” which did not load on a separate factor, or on any of 
the other factors. The item which denotes the complexity of the system (PC_Compl) loaded 
on the “ease of use” construct. Because the item describes the inverted idea of this construct, 
it was further included in the analysis, despite its loading of -.375 being somewhat below the 
suggested threshold. Similar to the nonuser sample, the split of “prestige” and “perceived 
enjoyment” was backed up by the 7-factor solution, which is presented in Appendix 10. The

Confirming the factor structure 
The results of the confirmative factor analysis as the successive analysis step can be reviewed 
in Appendix 11. All p-values of the factor loadings indicate a 0.01% significance level and all 
factor reliability values surpass the suggested threshold of 0.6 (Homburg and Giering 1996, 
p.13), while the factor “OEM brand” remains below the recommendation of 0.5 from the 
same reference with a value of 0.426. For the discriminant validity, the Fornell-Larcker 
ration, which should result in a value smaller than 1 (Fornell and Larcker 1981, p.46), the 
factor “perceived usefulness” does not achieve the recommendation with a ratio of 1.006 with 
the factor “satisfaction.” Therefore, the commonly used but less stringent Chi²-difference test 
is applied as described from Homburg and Giering (1996, p.11). The test shows that a model 
with the correlation between the two factors fixed to one does worsen, i.e., increase the chi² 
value. The declination at one degree of freedom supports the discriminant validity between 
the two constructs at a significance level of 0.01%.

Model validation and results 
The SEM factor structure is first defined for a plain, parsimonious model with satisfaction as 
the dependent variable, because this model is subsequently extended and used for multi-group 
analyses. The model is shown in Figure 32 and reveals four latent and one observed factors to 
be significant. A comparative discussion with the results of the nonuser model follows as the 
last section of this chapter.

Figure 32: User “plain” structural equation model 
The global fit indices, as illustrated in Figure 33, point to a good approximation of the model 
to the empirical data. All indices conform to the thresholds and rules of thumb as described in 
the user model section. The chi²/df ratio of 3.589 does fall short of the stricter suggestion of 
 3 (Homburg and Giering 1996, p.13), but clearly satisfies the recommendation of  5 
(Wheaton et al. 1977). Overall, and in compliance with the framework of Fritz (1995, p.143), 
acceptance of the model can be confirmed.

Figure 33: User “plain” global fit indices 
Based on the model as shown in Figure 32, the inclusion of the actual usage intensity was 
scrutinized as an extension. From the sample of 934 respondents, an actual usage data record 
for 746 vehicles was available, and aggregated into a normalized index. The index in the user 
sample ranged from 0, indicating a null user, to the maximum of 54.840 with a mean of 1.653. 
Excluding the null users resulted in a mean of 2.119. The usage index also showed a high 
level of skewness (7.080 with a standard error of .090) and especially kurtosis (70.110 with a 

 5 Winning insights from quantitative data analysis 
110 
standard error of .179). To fit the Likert-5 scale level of the variables from the customer 
survey, while accounting for the usage index distribution, a rescaling was performed by 
introducing four cutoff values of 0, 1, 2, and 4. Thereby, five clusters of usage intensity were 
created, with each increase of the scale by 1 representing a doubling of the (mean) usage. The 
resulting structural equation model is exhibited in Figure 34.

Usage
 
Figure 34: User “mediated” structural equation model 
Two peculiarities arise from the user model with the usage variable. On the one hand, the 
corresponding R² value of usage is only 0.095, indicating that only a small share of the 
variance of actual usage is accounted for, which I will refer to later on in the discussion. On 
the other hand, the path coefficient from satisfaction to usage is a positive value. This 
combines an increase of usage with a higher evaluation value of satisfaction, which 
corresponds to an inferior rating due to the anchor points, with 1 being the best and 5 the 
worst grade. This effect is assumed to be caused by multicollinearity, because “wrong signs of 
the coefficients” are also “telltale signs of multicollinearity” (Grewal, Cote, and Baumgartner 
2004, p. 521). The authors conclude, based on two Monte Carlo simulations, that Type II 
errors might occur as a consequence of multicollinearity in structural equation modeling, 
while “none of the approaches for managing multicollinearity seems entirely satisfactory” 
(Grewal, Cote, and Baumgartner 2004, p.521). For a classification of the error risk, the 
correlation matrix for the latent variables, as shown in Appendix 13, is reviewed and shows 5 
correlations in the range from 0.6 to 0.8, which does not constitute a problem per se, since 
“correlations in the 0.7 or 0.8 range are fairly common” (Grewal, Cote, and Baumgartner 
2004, p.528). The authors finally find that multicollinearity from 0.6 to 0.8 can considerably 
cause Type II errors but, “as reliability improves (0.80 or higher), R² reaches 0.75, and the 
sample becomes relatively large (ratio of 6:1), Type II error rates become negligible (below 

 5.6 Modeling technology acceptance and usage for users 
111
5%)” (p.527). The inspection of the corresponding user sample values shows that reliability 
(>0.8) and sample size requirement (ratio of 934 observations to 76 estimated parameter = 
12.3 : 1) are clearly fulfilled, which seems to indicate a low risk of Type II errors. For the 
inverted path coefficient, two more approaches are followed to support the general validity. 
First, the correlation matrix also shows that all correlations with the factor usage have the 
coefficient sign as “expected” in terms of interpretation. Second, the next section takes a 
different angle on integrating actual usage as the clustering attribute within a SEM multigroup 
analysis. 
In terms of the global fit indices, almost no difference with the less restricted, “plain” model 
can be noticed in Figure 35. The minor decrease in the CFI and TLI indices still allows for 
reaching the suggested thresholds. The overall review of the local and global fit indices 
therefore leads to the acceptance of the model.

Figure 35: User “mediated” global fit indices 
With regard to satisfaction as a mediator for usage, the test procedure after Baron and Kenny 
(1986) was re-run on the user sample. Figure 36 displays the corresponding results, which 
confirm a partial mediation for the two factors “CS brand” and “PC,” although the direct path 
from CS brand to usage became non-significant in the model. Price fairness can be regarded 
as fully mediated by satisfaction and does not directly influence usage. PU and PE, on the 
other hand, did not pass the mediation tests and are therefore not influencing usage indirectly 
through satisfaction.

Figure 37: User moderation tests 
In terms of the moderating influence of variables, customers of larger vehicles felt the 
usability of Connected Services to be weaker. This is consistent with older customers, who 
also devalued the usefulness of the system. Finally, higher educated customers regarded ease 
of use of the system more positively. 
The already reference correlation matrix (Appendix 13) also shows that the correlation 
between OEM and Connected Services brand is 0.454. This strength is classified in the range 
of 0.41 to 0.60 as “moderate degree of correlation” (Franzblau 1958).  
5.7 
User multigroup comparison by usage 
As an alternative to ANOVA tests, structural equation models can be extended with the 
inclusion of means and the test for differences across multiple groups simultaneously (Hox 
and Bechger 1998, p.13). These multigroup comparisons allow the evaluation, if there are 
differences in the path coefficients and means in subgroups of a sample. For the significance 
of the differences, a “chi² test for competing models” is applied, where equality constraints, 
e.g., similar path coefficients for both subgroups are imposed on a model. Consequently, 
additional degrees of freedom are gained, while at the same time the constraint also increases 
the chi² value of the model. The formal testing procedure now requires the difference between 
the chi² values of the restricted and the unrestricted (base) model to be compared against the 
critical chi² value for the difference of the degrees of freedoms (Li and Kishore 2006, p.186). 
If the chi² difference exceeds the critical value (at the desired significance level), the overall 
fit of the base model decreases and justifies the existence of different model parameters for 
different subgroups. Therefore, group differences are accepted as being not derived by 
chance, quod erat demonstrandum.  
For the least restrictive model, “the baseline model which provides the basis for future 
comparison of subgroup models, should fit the data” (Li and Kishore 2006, p.186), which is 
the case for the “plain” model as introduced in chapter  5.5.4. As a grouping attribute, the 
standardized usage index (as described previously) was employed. Three subgroups were 
analyzed. The first group consisted of users who did not show any usage across the 
observation period, i.e., their average usage intensity was zero. The second and third groups 
represented the groups of average users and heavy users, with a cutoff value of 2.11, which 

 5.7 User multigroup comparison by usage 
113
was the mean of all active users. The “security” customer group, i.e., customers who were 
attracted by the services only because of the emergency and breakdown call features, was 
excluded from the sample because their planned intention to use the system was inherently 
converging to zero. The resulting subsample sizes were 148, 416, and 142 respectively.  
In accordance with the multi-group analyses by Bart et al. (2005, p.141), three models were 
estimated in order to run the respective Chi² tests:  
(1) Every parameter was restricted to be equal across the three subgroups of Null, Average 
and Heavy users, resulting in a model fit of Chi² = 9,531.943 with df = 1,436; 
(2) Every parameter except path coefficients was restricted to be equal across the three 
subgroups, resulting in a model fit of Chi² = 2,344.355 with df = 1,289; 
(3) Every parameter except path coefficients and factor loadings was restricted to be equal 
across the three subgroups, resulting in a model fit of Chi² = 2,333.167 with df = 1,250. 
The null hypothesis of no significant differences could therefore be rejected for the path 
coefficients, while for the factor loadings invariance had to be accepted. Figure 38 shows the 
now validated, differing path coefficients and the mean differences as a delta to the baseline 
model. The outcome will be discussed some paragraphs later.

Figure 38: Multigroup SEM by usage 
Once more, the correlation matrices were reviewed and demonstrated a correlation of 0.479 
for the null user group, 0.498 for the Average user group and 0.547 for the Heavy user 
subsample. While all values still fall in the category of a “moderate degree of correlation,” 
this tendency is a notable finding for one of the research questions.

5.8 
User multigroup comparison by contractual status 
The structural equation modeling multigroup procedure was also applied to another grouping 
attribute, namely contract status. While 755 users were still in an active, contractual 
relationship with the OEM, 178 respondents of the user sample recently had terminated their 
contract. Also for this multigroup analysis, the Chi² difference test was employed to confirm 
that the differing parameters for the two groups were not derived by chance. Again, the 
methodology with three models was based on Bart et al. (2005, p. 141): (1) every parameter 
restricted derived a Chi² of 11,259.390 at 955 degrees of freedom; (2) no restrictions on path 
coefficients resulted a Chi² of 2,026.273 with df = 846; and (3) no restrictions on path 
coefficients and factor loadings tested Chi² to be 2,026.767 with 827 degrees of freedom. 
Once more, the Chi² difference at the corresponding difference of degrees of freedom rejected 
the null hypothesis of no significant differences for the path coefficients of the two groups, 
whereas no difference across factor loadings could be confirmed. Figure 39 depicts the path 
diagrams for active and canceled users and their relative means. Standardized factor loadings 
and their standard errors are exhibited on the arrows. Significance levels of 10%, 5%, 1% and 
0.1% are marked with +, *, **, and *** respectively, whereas factor loadings below the 10% 
threshold are marked with n.s. (not significant).

Discussion of the structural equation modeling results 
This section completes the chapter on quantitative and SEM analysis with a discussion of the 
findings from the latter. Models on technology acceptance with nonusers, on technology 
usage with users and models depicting the differences along the customer groups (or customer 
stages, in a temporal view) of null, average and heavy users and also for active and canceled 
customers were presented.  
The nonuser sample consisted of customers who had not selected or activated the Connected 
Services offering in their vehicles. Consequently, their path to becoming a customer of the 
services stopped at the level of technology acceptance. Customers’ overall evaluation of the 
system is foremost affected by the utilitarian motivations of perceived usefulness, and only 
slightly less important, by perceived criticalness. On the other hand, the hedonic components 
“Connected Services brand” and, slightly below, “perceived enjoyment” are almost as 
influential as the utilitarian factors. The notion of price fairness is mainly comprised of 
rational aspects and is the weakest predictor for the attitude toward the system. With regard to 
the imaginary situation which allows buying the services now, the intention to do so is almost 
equally influenced by the overall attitude, perceived enjoyment and price fairness. The 
rational components behave differently: while perceived usefulness becomes the strongest 
factor, perceived criticalness is less of an issue on the buying intention relative to the other 
factors and relative to its influence on attitude. Overall, the rational aspects, and especially 
PU, significantly contribute to technology acceptance, while the influences of hedonic 
components and pricing must not be neglected. With regard to the hypothesis stated in chapter 
4, the following Figure 40 summarizes the results for the nonuser sample.

Figure 40: Nonuser hypothesis review 
The user models, on the other hand, consisted of customer in an active or canceled contractual 
relationship, and therefore all passed the (first) technology acceptance hurdle. Based on their 
experience with the system, the modeling of the factors for satisfaction with the system, and 

 5 Winning insights from quantitative data analysis

the inclusion of actual usage behavior, represented more of an explanation of technology 
acceptance and usage. In this sense, two main differences between nonusers and users, despite 
not being formally comparable in a strict methodological sense, were revealed by the SEM 
models. First, the factor perceived criticalness was exchanged for ease of use. This change 
was already indicated from the decreasing importance of PC in the nonuser sample from the 
path on attitude toward the path on intention to buy, if these two relations are regarded as 
sequential. This change seems plausible in the light of the observations reported in the 
qualitative part of this thesis. The imagination of the system usability is a challenge for an 
inexperienced consumer and only becomes relevant after some time of actual usage. This 
development is also confirmed by the multigroup comparison, where EOU is a significant 
factor only for the group of customers with average usage intensity. As a second particularity 
of the user models, PU, which was already the strongest factor of the nonuser SEM, now 
becomes a dominant factor for the user sample on the path to satisfaction. This evolvement is 
even enhanced when the usage multigroup model is reviewed, where PU increases from .297 
to .445 to .570 on the way from null to average to heavy usage. Nevertheless, and ranked by 
their influential power, perceived enjoyment and the brand of Connected Services are still 
relevant hedonic factors for the evaluation of satisfaction with the services, complemented by 
the factors ease of use and price fairness. 
The usage multigroup model revealed three more results. First, contrary to the rise of 
perceived usefulness along the dimension of actual usage, perceived enjoyment loses its 
influence on satisfaction and even becomes non-significant for heavy users. Second, for null 
users the general appreciation of technology hedonism in the sense of valuing non-utilitarian 
elements like image and design negatively influences satisfaction with Connected Services. 
This might also indicate that the tested implementation of Connected Services in the vehicle 
does not convey or communicate these product attributes at the level of customers’ 
expectations. Third, the group of heavy users is on the one hand very rationale through the 
dominant effect of perceived usefulness, but on the other hand also hedonically oriented 
through the influence of both Connected Services brand and OEM brand. This outcome is 
also supported by the highest correlation between those constructs among all subsamples of 
the overall survey.  
The multigroup comparison between active and canceled customers discloses that usefulness 
was also the main contributor to the (dis-)satisfaction of canceled customers with Connected 
Services. Furthermore, all other relevant criteria for contractual customers became non-
significant with this subsample, with the notable exception of the attitude towards the brand 
of the services. The resulting hypothesis table of the user group is depicted in Figure 41.

With regard to moderating variables, age influenced a total of six paths, supported in the 
interpretation by three paths from vehicle class, which was assumed to be a proxy for age 
through buying power. In all cases, a negative influence was noticed, i.e., older consumers or 
customers with a larger (more expensive) vehicle regarded several factors as more critical, 
with the exception of older nonusers who, contrary to older users, valued the paths from 
perceived enjoyment more positively. As well, female nonusers perceived a higher usefulness, 
whereas critical issues were regarded as less important. The usage of the vehicle in business 
settings devalued nonusers’ view of the service brand, PE and PC. Finally, the user group’s 
education level positively affected the usability evaluation.

6.1 
Reflections along the customer life cycle 
This doctoral dissertation attempts to shed additional light on the consumer experience of the 
process of accepting and using Connected Services. The scope of analysis ranged from an 
introduction to Connected Services, to the decision about using the services and then to the 
actual use of them, and ultimately to the stage of becoming a renewing and loyal customer. 
Therefore, from both qualitative and quantitative analyses, the primary findings of this 
research project should be reflected along the generic life cycle of a Connected Services 
customer, as depicted in Figure 42.

Figure 42: Connected Services customer lifecycle  
The geographic scope of this research was the German market, where vehicle owners and 
buyers even now lack a general awareness of telematic services, the most common Connected 
Services in the automotive industry. The limited number of vehicles offered and sold with 
such services is both cause and result of the degree to which Connected Services is a 
commodity. In spite of the lack of customer awareness, Connected Services providers in 
Germany display only a low level of classical “above-the-line” advertising activities such as 
television, newspaper, or billboard advertisements. The customer survey revealed that there is 
a considerable base of customers to leverage the potential of word-of-mouth referrals (see 
chapter  5.3). However, the full power of word-of-mouth as a marketing instrument will unfold 
only when a critical mass of customers is installed in the market. For now, the first process 
step in the customer lifecycle, “communication,” still yields a customer with little or no 
knowledge of, and experience with, Connected Services.  
When this generic customer enters the “sales process” with a dealer, each of the subsequent 
customer touchpoints has to be balanced between two extremes (see chapter  3.7). On the one 
hand, customers have cognitive and time-related restrictions, but on the other hand, minimum 

 6 Developing Connected Services today and tomorrow 
120 
efforts in terms of information and trials are necessary to convey service characteristics and 
benefits. Together, both dimensions represent a continuum from time restrictions (but with no 
information communicated to the customer) on the one end, to extensive and informative 
customer consulting on the other hand (which requires a significant investment in time), 
where every customer interaction with the dealer or OEM – such as sales ‘pitch’, test drives, 
vehicle delivery, and after-sales processes – can be, or must be, assigned to a point/value on 
the continuum. Dealer interviews in the exploratory research stage revealed that the 
continuum applies to both parties – consumer and dealer representative. Using the example of 
the sales pitch, the customer must commit some cognitive effort and must invest time in order 
to understand the personal use cases and benefits of Connected Services. Because there is 
little knowledge from previous experiences, neglecting the cognitive and time investments 
will significantly reduce the likelihood of understanding and accepting such complex, 
technology-based products and services. Alternatively, dealer representatives also must 
balance between tight time restrictions (as a consequence of demanding sales targets) and 
providing the necessary relevant information, in the required intensity. As well, the (internal) 
competition of innovations makes the distribution of each individual product or service even 
more of a challenge. The overall sales process, consequently, will foster acceptance of 
Connected Services only if the customer has previous knowledge or if the dealer positively 
evaluates the time-benefit-risk ratio of this feature in order to convince or upgrade the 
customer. Looking at the hard facts, a study by Oliver Wyman (2007) found that only 17% of 
the offered innovations actually find their way into customers’ vehicles.  
On behavioral customer segmentation, survey data supported the findings from qualitative 
research. Whereas there are three clusters of business-, safety-, and technology-oriented 
customers, a considerable number of customers do not fall into one of those three segments 
(see chapter  3.3.4). In addition to the latter two segments being relatively small, the analysis 
of actual usage data revealed that the highest usage intensity appears when technology affinity 
meets everyday use-cases in the form of high mileages driven, i.e., typically, business-related 
trips. Technology is therefore not an end in itself but is, rather, a notion that is confirmed by 
the technology readiness index as measured in the survey. Although there is a positive 
correlation of this index with the three survey subsamples of nonusers, cancellations, and 
active users, all groups are above the average index value for the general population. As a 
result, the TRI instrument does not become significant in any of the technology acceptance, in 
line with being of only low influence on TAM in other research (Walczuch, Lemmink, and 
Streukens 2007). Furthermore, technology readiness also does not constitute a distinctive 
element for separating technology acceptors from technology rejecters per se. 
The third process step in the customer lifecycle, “registration and activation,” can represent a 
separate, additional barrier for customers to “implement” technology acceptance, because 

 6.1 Reflections along the customer life cycle 
121
usage of Connected Services in the vehicle requires the upfront activation of the contract 
through Internet, fax, or mail. Due to the scope of this research, this step was integrated into 
the perspective and model of technology acceptance. This model was based on the nonuser 
sample of the survey, i.e., respondents who did not own or use the services in their vehicle 
(see chapter  5.5). The results of the structural equation model showed that the utilitarian 
factors “usefulness” and “criticalness,” as two separate constructs, are similarly as influential 
on the attitude toward the system as are the hedonic components “Connected Services brand” 
and “enjoyment.” “Price fairness” follows closely, whereas its contribution to the buying 
intention becomes stronger. Likewise, usefulness and enjoyment are becoming more relevant 
for the actual buying decision than the other factors, and more relevant than on attitude. 
Every respondent on the web survey who was still using or had recently canceled the services, 
and every vehicle from the larger sample of Connected Services users, has passed the 
lifecycle step of registration and activation. Because those users had at least once accepted 
and activated the services, the analyses with those data sets dealt with technology acceptance 
and usage (TAUM, see chapter  5.6). At first, the SEM model for this subsample revealed that 
the criticalness dissolved as an individual factor, and only the item “complexity of the 
services” merged into the newly appearing factor “ease of use.” Owing to the methodology of 
the survey (trial or product clinic simulations were not feasible for a sample of 709 nonusers), 
usability only became relevant for customers once they experienced it on their own. For the 
acceptance of Connected Services, usability therefore becomes “only” a hygienic factor, if 
trial is not implemented as a central element in the communication and sales processes. 
Second, the weights of the influencing factors shifted, with perceived usefulness almost 
doubling its influence in comparison to the nonuser sample, which also highlights and 
supports the earlier remark on the importance of a personal use-case being recognized by the 
driver for continuous usage.  
The inclusion of actual usage data allowed several findings (see chapter  5.3), whose analyses 
all fall into the customer lifecycle process steps of “contract period and potential usage.” As 
the wording already indicates, acceptance in the sense of buying and activating the system 
does not necessarily translate into actual usage. As well, the multigroup analysis with null 
users, i.e., users who showed no usage activity throughout the observed period of 11 months, 
versus average users, versus heavy users, also revealed significant differences among those 
groups. Along the usage profiles from null to average to heavy users, perceived usefulness 
increases to the dominant factor, while the influence of perceived enjoyment develops 
reciprocally. This development depicts the rational, utilitarian view as a major driver of 
continuous usage. The individual usage clusters indicated three further aspects. First, null 
users are also negatively influenced by their search for hedonic technology, i.e., they value 
technology also on non-utilitarian attributes such as lifestyle, image, and design. Although 

 6 Developing Connected Services today and tomorrow 
122 
technology hedonism is the least influential factor, together with the prevalence of perceived 
enjoyment, it at least supports the indication for a group of customers that is dissatisfied and 
is not using the system because those hedonic expectations were not fulfilled. Second, the 
relevance of ease of use only for the average usage group fosters the thesis of the n-shaped 
experience-benefit model as proposed in Figure 11. Usability is not important to customers 
with no experience at all, because the missing imagination prevents those customers from 
thinking about usability, in line with Rust, Thompson, and Hamilton (2006). Heavy users are 
generally experienced users and have either fully accepted the user interface, or have rejected 
the system completely. The remaining customers are the users in the middle, who might 
sometimes be delighted by ease of use, but more often are at risk of being alienated by 
negative usability experiences. The third finding from the multigroup SEM analysis covers 
the branding aspect for heavy users. Not only does the Connected Services brand still have a 
significant influence on satisfaction with the system, but it is also accompanied by the OEM 
brand as another contributing factor. Moreover, the correlation between those two constructs 
was found to be the highest among all subsamples, being regarded as having at least a 
moderate degree of correlation. While the (generally favorable) attitude toward the OEM 
brand has no influence on attitude or satisfaction for all other subsamples, in the case of heavy 
users the desired spillover effects and a close fit between core and co-product take place. 
The direct prediction of actual usage with the proposed TAUM model showed that variance of 
usage behavior is also accounted for by several non-identified elements (see chapter  5.6.4). 
This might also be related to the fact that many of the Connected Services use cases represent 
irregular use and are stimulated externally. However, the inclusion of actual usage allows for 
analyses that are helpful in the identification of patterns and differences among those 
subsamples. Furthermore, actual usage data supports the prediction of churn. From the usage 
behavior data set of the survey sample, but especially from the even larger vehicle sample, 
more results could be derived. Quantitative analyses confirm the negative and moderating 
roles of age and buying power on usage intensity. As well, a positive correlation between the 
number of services used and the intensity in terms of activities per month is evidenced on the 
usage intensity. In the same line, the existence was validated for user groups who fully rely on 
self-service or voice-based channels (with a call center agent) and neglect the other channel. 
But the size of those user groups is much smaller than the number of users who spread their 
usage across all channels. In addition, the usage intensity of those “restricted users” is below 
the averages of all other groups. Theses findings lead to the last process step in the customer 
lifecycle before the moment of truth. 
Each time a customer arrives at the moment of truth, the culminated effects of all previous 
stages and touchpoints with the OEM and dealer allow the customer to decide on further 
engaging, or on rejecting, the contractual relationship. While the previous outcomes affect 

 6.2 Research and managerial implications 
123
customer management in the period before the moment of truth, two more results from this 
doctoral dissertation directly uncover potential early indicators for churn (see chapter  5.3). 
The observation of usage patterns of cancellations and renewal customers directly before (and 
after) the moment of truth reveals the most significant difference to be not usage intensity, but 
the share of null users. Almost every second customer in the group of cancellations was a null 
user during that period, while in the group of renewing customers not even every fourth 
instance showed a complete lack of activity. As another outcome, the rate of cancellations 
was almost two thirds lower in the group of customers who experienced the breakdown call 
feature during their contract period. Although practical implications may be difficult to derive 
from this second finding, it leads back to the beginning of the customer lifecycle: the claim 
for ensuring the transfer of information and understanding to the customer as an elementary 
prerequisite to unfold the whole value functional chain can be emphasized once again.  
In total, Connected Services require an extended view when analyzing factors of their 
diffusion and success. While “traditional” technology acceptance research “only” focused on 
the initial sales or implementation of products and services, the expected business case – and 
also the marketing results – of Connected Services are only beginning at the point of 
acceptance. Consequently, a more holistic approach such as the introduced customer lifecycle 
is recommended for these types of services. 
6.2 
Research and managerial implications 
The most relevant direct implications of this research project on the worlds of academics and 
practitioners are essential considerations. Despite most of the results being simultaneously 
valid for both worlds, the following segments are structured along the lines of academic and 
business relevancy.  
While Connected Services, as a conjunction of self-service technologies and remote services, 
have already been in the marketplace for a while, and solutions and implementations from a 
technical perspective have been discussed in the academic sphere, a gap in the holistic, 
business-oriented research remains (Holtbrügge, Holzmüller, and von Wangenheim 2007). 
Therefore, this work contributes to the theoretical understanding of an underrepresented type 
of service. Moreover, the specific occurrence of Connected Services in the automotive 
industry has not been subject to technology acceptance and usage research at all, which also 
contributes to the value of these findings for practitioners.  
From a methodology point of view, this project supports those researchers who are calling for 
consideration of the risk of common method variance (Benbasat and Barki 2007; Goodhue 
2007; Straub Jr. and Burton-Jones 2007). The comparison of self-reported usage with the 
actual usage figures from system log files revealed that customers generally overstate their 

 6 Developing Connected Services today and tomorrow 
124 
usage behavior, although the deviation differs considerably by the type of media used (voice-
based versus self-service/Internet). Furthermore, the integration of actual usage in the 
structural equation models evidences that only 10% of the variance was accounted for by the 
model, despite a R² for satisfaction of more than 0.7.  
Traditional TAM research is enriched through this dissertation in manifold ways, besides 
fulfilling the “simple” call for further validation and extension for new technology 
applications and “additional theoretically motivated moderating influences” (Venkatesh et al. 
2003, p.470). The new approach of brand attitude as an additional factor, but also the role of 
pricing fairness, contribute to technology acceptance research, as well as representing another 
justification for dealing individually with the idiosyncrasies of B2C settings. While the strong 
or even dominant role of perceived usefulness across all models supported the results from the 
original work on TAM (Davis 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1989), the extension with 
actual usage data also allowed for more detailed segment views. Assuming the path from null 
to average to heavy usage as a proxy for experience with the system, this research also 
follows another call by Venkatesh et al. (2003) by evaluating the moderating role of 
experience on technology acceptance. In the end, the findings suggest that the view on 
technology acceptance might often be too narrow in terms of predicting technology diffusion 
or of predicting the success of product and service introductions, as considered by 
Bhattacherjee (2001). This notion supports but also goes beyond the publication by Lenfle 
and Midler (2008), who called for (also) considering the launch-phase for innovative, 
product-related services as an important success factor. A considerable number of customers 
who – in the traditional understanding – accepted technology do not leverage the services (or 
products) at all, although the first hurdle has been passed. The validation of the subsequently 
higher risk of customer churn is therefore another case in point for the “continuous service 
provider” model (Bolton 1998). The different models for nonusers and users, and their 
distinct influences on the overall service evaluation, further point toward differences between 
customers at different stages of their lifecycles. Consequently, future research needs to 
consider the resulting, inherent limitations of static models that try to cover an apparently 
dynamic process of technology acceptance and usage.  
Considering those differences between potential and actual customers when managing 
customer touchpoints is the most relevant implication of this research project for an OEM or 
for practitioners in general. As noted previously, a holistic view of Connected Services is 
required in order for academics to understand and predict customer behavior. For managers, 
the underlying business models make the adaptation to different customer motivations, 
lifecycle, and process stages an imperative. At the same time, changes in the economic 
framework are fundamental in the automotive industry, which for decades focused their 
product development, business operations, marketing and sales, customer relationship 

 6.2 Research and managerial implications 
125
management, and, ultimately, their business cases, on the “one-time” distribution of products 
and, to much lower extent, distribution of services. This change is also recognized in the 
keynote address of Alan Mulally, CEO of Ford, at the latest CES in Las Vegas: “We are a car 
company, but we are learning to act like an electronics company.” (Hannemann and Matting 
2009) Failing to adhere to the specific principles of Connected Services might lead to severe 
economic consequences for two reasons. On the one hand, research results validated the long 
process from sales, to technology acceptance and technology usage, to loyalty. On the other 
hand, a general rise in Connected Services can be predicted and is already being noticed 
across industries. Consequently, these implications are not limited to the primary focus of this 
research, the automotive industry, but should be generalized to every provider of complex, 
technology-based products and services.  
Overall, the findings of this research should be regarded as a call for a holistic, end-to-end 
analysis from product or service development to the targeted success factors like loyalty, 
positive charging of the brand, or simple business economics. In addition to this generic yet 
demanding implication, several of the findings can also be translated into more concrete 
managerial recommendations. To that end, the three elements of marketing and sales, cross-
sectional adaptation, and longitudinal adaptation are described more in detail.  
The marketing and sales process represents a necessary but insufficient precondition for 
successfully marketing innovative and complex technology-based products and services. 
When products are not yet a commodity in the market, their understanding requires 
commitment of time and effort on the part of both consumers and sales representatives. 
Despite the high affinity of Connected Services with the Internet, the majority of consumers 
still rely on a human counterpart for explanations and recommendations in order to determine 
the personal use-case and, finally, the acceptance of such technologies. Therefore, managers 
must not define their potential customers too narrowly: any person and process which 
represents a customer touchpoint at various stages of the marketing and sales process must be 
included. For example, a salesperson needs to be considered as an important collaborator, 
because he can only excite customers if, in the first place, the sales representative is confident 
with and convinced of Connected Services. In addition, the effort and time required to 
appropriately communicate product characteristics, benefits, and the perceived risks to 
consumers must not be underestimated. For some evaluation attributes like usability, 
customers are not able to determine the relevance before they gain hands-on experience with 
the product or service (Rust, Thompson, and Hamilton 2006). But even for the “simple” 
comprehension of product features, when complex products and services are concerned, 
qualitative research strongly calls for fostering trial and first-hand experience of consumers. 
As well, addressing nonusers must take all utilitarian and hedonic buying criteria into 

 6 Developing Connected Services today and tomorrow 
126 
account, with a slight focus on the usefulness of Connected Services. For all aspects, there are 
consumer clusters that are more or less receptive to the arguments leveraged. 
Managers should therefore concentrate their efforts on the most promising target groups, and 
adapt their work cross-sectionally. The outcomes of this dissertation suggest cross-sectional 
adaptation in two dimensions. On the one hand, behavioral customer segments like safety-, 
technology-, or business-oriented drivers show and require individual needs to be satisfied. 
On the other hand, the level of expertise, which also runs across these behavioral clusters, can 
also serve as criteria for clustering and, subsequently, for adaptation. The introduced n-shaped 
model illustrates a simple but practical tool for deriving the relevance of arguments like 
perceived usefulness, criticalness, or enjoyment for each customer segment. On the 
operational level, appropriate adaptation might be exercised on various aspects such as 
communication, product, or portfolio management, or also in terms of pricing, to name just a 
few. Adaptations are suggested not only in the cross-sectional view, but also in a longitudinal 
dimension. 
Longitudinal adaptation denominates the recommended reactions to the changes – the 
customer experiences along his service life-cycle. Most notably, the transition from being 
only a prospective customer, i.e., a nonuser of Connected Services, to the contractual 
relationship with the OEM as a user, also entails a change of influencing factors for 
satisfaction with the system. Moving one step further in the timeline, users might increase 
their usage activity and changes should be accounted for from a management point of view. 
Without diminishing the value of the other findings, the ever increasing relevance of 
perceived usefulness for customers gives a clear indication in terms of practical implications. 
While usefulness forms the basis for all other positive evaluation criteria to contribute 
positively, failing to satisfy this utilitarian dimension cannot be recovered by any other 
attribute. Furthermore, the share of null users, which more than doubles in the cancellation 
group versus the renewal group, reinforces the role of usefulness, if usage is equated with a 
positive evaluation of usefulness. With this relationship, and not until this relationship, the 
functional chain drawn at the beginning of this section is completed, and is eventually also 
valid from a purely economic point of view. Once again, and as a closing argument of this 
section, practitioners should always bear in mind the long road from product development, to 
marketing and sales, to technology acceptance, to usage, and finally to loyalty.  
6.3 
Outlook on (research on) Connected Services in the future 
As with virtually every study in such fields of research, limitations associated with the results 
represent, at the same time, opportunities for future research. First, the results of this study are 
valid for customers in Germany. Although there are good reasons to believe that the findings 

 6.3 Outlook on (research on) Connected Services in the future 
127
can be extended to most European countries, there have been clear statements in the 
explorative research phase, and indications from recent market developments, that the U.S. 
market differs significantly. Besides the higher diffusion of Connected Services in the 
automotive industry, with General Motors’ “OnStar” presently servicing more than five 
million customers (GeneralMotors 2007), a different service culture has been noted. 
Customers are said to be less contained in utilizing and also in demanding services, whereas 
German customers, especially, were frequently considered to be reluctant to service offerings 
where a call center agent has “to be bothered.” Although this voice-channel avoiding 
customer group has been found to be of less importance in the total user sample, its existence 
cannot be denied, and makes another point for replicating this doctoral dissertation in other 
countries, with special focus on the U.S. and the Asian market.  
Second, the usage data observation period of this research project was 11 months, which 
allowed for reliable and valid analyses. Nevertheless, a significantly longer time period might 
enable further outcomes on two dimensions. On the one hand, such a longitudinal study could 
accompany one specific set of customers throughout their whole customer lifecycle, which 
would facilitate even more accurate and detailed dynamic insights. On the other hand, a time 
period beyond the average vehicle owning period (at least above the one for business users) 
would support the possibility of revealing the causal effects between the brand influence of 
Connected Services at the stages of the vehicle buying decision and the first-time services, the 
usage period, the service renewal, and finally the feedback to the OEM brand when the 
customer ultimately chooses the brand of the next vehicle.  
Besides encouraging fellow and future researchers through the promises of those two 
suggestions, there are good reasons to believe in a general increase in awareness of and 
interest in the field of Connected Services. As is the case with young and therefore dynamic 
industries, these changes are another argument for extending and repeating research efforts 
within a short time-frame in order to validate timeless findings and to capture new aspects 
alike. Coming primarily from the viewpoint of the automotive field, but being expandable to 
other technology-related industries, three observations form the basis for the correctness of 
this prediction. First, OEMs are always in need for differentiating features, especially in B2C 
markets. As shown in the earlier chapters, product features are currently becoming less of a 
USP, which paves the way for services taking over this role. The ubiquitous technification 
and the increasing wish, or need, to keep hardware-based products updated, are further 
aspects that will serve as promoters of Connected Services. The introduction of the Lexus 
“audio broadcast service,” which will conveniently inform drivers in the vehicle (utilizing the 
telematics infrastructure) about brand- and vehicle-related news and events (Schweinsberg 
2009), finally shows the acknowledgment of CRM as a base for continuously successful 
business. Second, (and this point may differentiate this forecast from others made in the 

 6 Developing Connected Services today and tomorrow 
128 
Internet bubble around the year 2000), OEMs like GM and BMW have proven that stable 
business models are feasible if the engagement is planned on a long-term basis. Third and 
finally, a range of new players are appearing on the market, which will stimulate the market 
development. In a narrow view, companies from adjacent industries like personal navigation 
devices (PND) or Smartphones with an integrated Internet connection have already launched 
first offerings, with Connected Services as a substantial part of the product offering. While 
some companies provide the platform for technology-oriented customers who want to 
leverage the full portfolio of services10, others serve the market with services, which are very 
limited but are easy to communicate and to understand11. But in addition, there are also 
companies from previously unrelated industries like Microsoft, which is providing automotive 
software platforms, or Google, which is strongly investing in the opportunities of location-
based services. For these reasons, I conclude that Connected Services is a demanding but a 
very promising field to work in for practitioners and academics alike. 
                                                 
10 For example, the startup company Dash (see http://ww.dash.net) introduced a navigation platform called Dash Express in 
beginning of 2008 in the US market. The integrated Internet access is positioned as an infrastructure platform, which 
allows users (and other software and service providers) to customize the solution to their needs, e.g. by integrating search 
services of “Yahoo!Go,” weather reports of “WeatherBug” or real estate listings of “Coldwell Banker Home Search”. 
11 For example, TomTom launched some of its Personal Navigation Devices with an integrated SIM card to offer customers
