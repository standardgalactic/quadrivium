Preface
Like many other textbooks the present one is based on a lecture course given
by the author for master students of the RWTH Aachen University. In spite
of a somewhat diﬃcult matter those students were able to endure and, as far
as I know, are still ﬁne. I wish the same for the reader of the book.
Although the present book can be referred to as a textbook one ﬁnds only
little plain text inside. I tried to explain the matter in a brief way, neverthe-
less going into detail where necessary. I also avoided tedious introductions and
lengthy remarks about the signiﬁcance of one topic or another. A reader in-
terested in tensor algebra and tensor analysis but preferring, however, words
instead of equations can close this book immediately after having read the
preface.
The reader is assumed to be familiar with the basics of matrix algebra
and continuum mechanics and is encouraged to solve at least some of numer-
ous exercises accompanying every chapter. Having read many other texts on
mathematics and mechanics I was always upset vainly looking for solutions to
the exercises which seemed to be most interesting for me. For this reason, all
the exercises here are supplied with solutions amounting a substantial part of
the book. Without doubt, this part facilitates a deeper understanding of the
subject.
As a research work this book is open for discussion which will certainly
contribute to improving the text for further editions. In this sense, I am very
grateful for comments, suggestions and constructive criticism from the reader.
I already expect such criticism for example with respect to the list of references
which might be far from being complete. Indeed, throughout the book I only
quote the sources indispensable to follow the exposition and notation. For this
reason, I apologize to colleagues whose valuable contributions to the matter
are not cited.
Finally, a word of acknowledgment is appropriate. I would like to thank
Uwe Navrath for having prepared most of the ﬁgures for the book. Fur-
ther, I am grateful to Alexander Ehret who taught me ﬁrst steps as well
as some “dirty” tricks in LATEX, which were absolutely necessary to bring the

manuscript to a printable form. He and Tran Dinh Tuyen are also acknowl-
edged for careful proof reading and critical comments to an earlier version
of the book. My special thanks go to the Springer-Verlag and in particular
to Eva Hestermann-Beyerle and Monika Lempe for their friendly support in
getting this book published.

Vectors and Tensors in a Finite-Dimensional
Space
1.1 Notion of the Vector Space
We start with the deﬁnition of the vector space over the ﬁeld of real numbers
R.
Deﬁnition 1.1. A vector space is a set V of elements called vectors satisfying
the following axioms.
A. To every pair, x and y of vectors in V there corresponds a vector x + y,
called the sum of x and y, such that
(A.1) x + y = y + x (addition is commutative),
(A.2) (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) (addition is associative),
(A.3) there exists in V a unique vector zero 0, such that 0 +x = x, ∀x ∈V,
(A.4) to every vector x in V there corresponds a unique vector −x such that
x + (−x) = 0.
B. To every pair α and x, where α is a scalar real number and x is a vector in
V, there corresponds a vector αx, called the product of α and x, such that
(B.1) α (βx) = (αβ) x (multiplication by scalars is associative),
(B.2) 1x = x,
(B.3) α (x + y) = αx + αy (multiplication by scalars is distributive with
respect to vector addition),
(B.4) (α + β) x = αx + βx (multiplication by scalars is distributive with
respect to scalar addition),
∀α, β ∈R, ∀x, y ∈V.
Examples of vector spaces.

2) The set of all directional arrows in two or three dimensions. Applying the
usual deﬁnitions for summation, multiplication by a scalar, the negative
and zero vector (Fig. 1.1) one can easily see that the above axioms hold
for directional arrows.
3) The set of all n-tuples of real numbers R:

1.2 Basis and Dimension of the Vector Space
Deﬁnition 1.2. A set of vectors x1, x2, . . . , xn is called linearly dependent if
there exists a set of corresponding scalars α1, α2, . . . , αn ∈R, not all zero,
such that
n
	
i=1
αixi = 0.
(1.1)
Otherwise, the vectors x1, x2, . . . , xn are called linearly independent. In this
case, none of the vectors xi is the zero vector (Exercise 1.2).
Deﬁnition 1.3. The vector
x =
n
	
i=1
αixi
(1.2)
is called linear combination of the vectors x1, x2, . . . , xn, where αi ∈R (i
= 1, 2, . . ., n).
Theorem 1.1. The set of n non-zero vectors x1, x2, . . . , xn is linearly depen-
dent if and only if some vector xk (2 ≤k ≤n) is a linear combination of the
preceding ones xi (i = 1, . . . , k −1).
Proof. If the vectors x1, x2, . . . , xn are linearly dependent, then
n
	
i=1
αixi = 0,
where not all αi are zero. Let αk (2 ≤k ≤n) be the last non-zero number, so
that αi = 0 (i = k + 1, . . . , n). Then,
k
	
i=1
αixi = 0 ⇒xk =
k−1
	
i=1
−αi
αk
xi.
Thereby, the case k = 1 is avoided because α1x1 = 0 implies that x1 = 0
(Exercise 1.1). Thus, the suﬃciency is proved. The necessity is evident.
Deﬁnition 1.4. A basis of a vector space V is a set G of linearly independent
vectors such that every vector in V is a linear combination of elements of G.
A vector space V is ﬁnite-dimensional if it has a ﬁnite basis.
Within this book, we restrict our attention to ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces.
Although one can ﬁnd for a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space an inﬁnite number
of bases, they all have the same number of vectors.

4
1 Vectors and Tensors in a Finite-Dimensional Space
Theorem 1.2. All the bases of a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space V contain
the same number of vectors.
Proof. Let G = {g1, g2, . . . , gn} and F = {f 1, f 2, . . . , f m} be two arbitrary
bases of V with diﬀerent numbers of elements, say m > n. Then, every vector
in V is a linear combination of the following vectors:
f 1, g1, g2, . . . , gn.
(1.3)
These vectors are non-zero and linearly dependent. Thus, according to The-
orem 1.1 we can ﬁnd such a vector gk, which is a linear combination of the
preceding ones. Excluding this vector we obtain the set G′ by
f 1, g1, g2, . . . , gk−1, gk+1, . . . , gn
again with the property that every vector in V is a linear combination of the
elements of G′. Now, we consider the following vectors
f 1, f 2, g1, g2, . . . , gk−1, gk+1, . . . , gn
and repeat the excluding procedure just as before. We see that none of the
vectors f i can be eliminated in this way because they are linearly independent.
As soon as all gi (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) are exhausted we conclude that the vectors
f 1, f 2, . . . , f n+1
are linearly dependent. This contradicts, however, the previous assumption
that they belong to the basis F.
Deﬁnition 1.5. The dimension of a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space V is the
number of elements in a basis of V.
Theorem 1.3. Every set F = {f 1, f 2, . . . , f n} of linearly independent vec-
tors in an n-dimensional vectors space V forms a basis of V. Every set of
more than n vectors is linearly dependent.
Proof. The proof of this theorem is similar to the preceding one. Let G =
{g1, g2, . . . , gn} be a basis of V. Then, the vectors (1.3) are linearly dependent
and non-zero. Excluding a vector gk we obtain a set of vectors, say G′, with
the property that every vector in V is a linear combination of the elements
of G′. Repeating this procedure we ﬁnally end up with the set F with the
same property. Since the vectors f i (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) are linearly independent
they form a basis of V. Any further vectors in V, say f n+1, f n+2, . . . are thus
linear combinations of F. Hence, any set of more than n vectors is linearly
dependent.
Theorem 1.4. Every set F = {f 1, f 2, . . . , f m} of linearly independent vec-
tors in an n-dimensional vector space V can be extended to a basis.

1.3 Components of a Vector, Summation Convention
5
Proof. If m = n, then F is already a basis according to Theorem 1.3. If
m < n, then we try to ﬁnd n −m vectors f m+1, f m+2, . . . , f n, such that all
the vectors f i, that is, f 1, f 2, . . . , f m, f m+1, . . . , f n are linearly independent
and consequently form a basis. Let us assume, on the contrary, that only
k < n −m such vectors can be found. In this case, for all x ∈V there exist
scalars α, α1, α2, . . . , αm+k, not all zero, such that
αx + α1f 1 + α2f 2 + . . . + αm+kf m+k = 0,
where α ̸= 0 since otherwise the vectors f i (i = 1, 2, . . ., m + k) would be
linearly dependent. Thus, all the vectors x of V are linear combinations of
f i (i = 1, 2, . . . , m + k). Then, the dimension of V is m + k < n, which con-
tradicts the assumption of this theorem.
1.3 Components of a Vector, Summation Convention
Let G = {g1, g2, . . . , gn} be a basis of an n-dimensional vector space V. Then,
x =
n
	
i=1
xigi,
∀x ∈V.
(1.4)
Theorem 1.5. The representation (1.4) with respect to a given basis G is
unique.
Proof. Let
x =
n
	
i=1
xigi
and
x =
n
	
i=1
yigi
be two diﬀerent representations of a vector x, where not all scalar coeﬃcients
xi and yi (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) are pairwise identical. Then,
0 = x + (−x) = x + (−1) x =
n
	
i=1
xigi +
n
	
i=1

−yi
gi =
n
	
i=1

xi −yi
gi,
where we use the identity −x = (−1) x (Exercise 1.1). Thus, either the num-
bers xi and yi are pairwise equal xi = yi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) or the vectors gi are
linearly dependent. The latter one is likewise impossible because these vectors
form a basis of V.
The scalar numbers xi (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) in the representation (1.4) are called
components of the vector x with respect to the basis G = {g1, g2, . . . , gn}.
The summation of the form (1.4) is often used in tensor analysis. For this
reason it is usually represented without the summation symbol in a short form
by

(1.5)
referred to as Einstein’s summation convention. Accordingly, the summation is
implied if an index appears twice in a multiplicative term, once as a superscript
and once as a subscript. Such a repeated index (called dummy index) takes
the values from 1 to n (the dimension of the vector space in consideration).
The sense of the index changes (from superscript to subscript or vice versa)
if it appears under the fraction bar.
1.4 Scalar Product, Euclidean Space, Orthonormal Basis
The scalar product plays an important role in vector and tensor algebra. The
properties of the vector space essentially depend on whether and how the
scalar product is deﬁned in this space.
Deﬁnition 1.6. The scalar (inner) product is a real-valued function x · y of
two vectors x and y in a vector space V, satisfying the following conditions.
C. (C.1) x · y = y · x
(commutative rule),
(C.2) x · (y + z) = x · y + x · z (distributive rule),
(C.3) α (x · y) = (αx) · y = x · (αy)
(associative rule for the multiplica-
tion by a scalar), ∀α ∈R, ∀x, y, z ∈V,
(C.4) x · x ≥0 ∀x ∈V,
x · x = 0 if and only if x = 0.
An n-dimensional vector space furnished by the scalar product with properties
(C.1-C.4) is called Euclidean space En. On the basis of this scalar product
one deﬁnes the Euclidean length (also called norm) of a vector x by
∥x∥= √x · x.
(1.6)
A vector whose length is equal to 1 is referred to as unit vector.
Deﬁnition 1.7. Two vectors x and y are called orthogonal (perpendicular),
denoted by x⊥y, if
x · y = 0.
(1.7)
Of special interest is the so-called orthonormal basis of the Euclidean space.
Deﬁnition 1.8. A basis E = {e1, e2, . . . , en} of an n-dimensional Euclidean
space En is called orthonormal if
ei · ej = δij,
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n,
(1.8)
where

denotes the Kronecker delta.
Thus, the elements of an orthonormal basis represent pairwise orthog-
onal unit vectors. Of particular interest is the question of the existence of
an orthonormal basis. Now, we are going to demonstrate that every set of
m ≤n linearly independent vectors in En can be orthogonalized and nor-
malized by means of a linear transformation (Gram-Schmidt procedure).
In other words, starting from linearly independent vectors x1, x2, . . . , xm
one can always construct their linear combinations e1, e2, . . . , em such that
ei · ej = δij (i, j = 1, 2, . . ., m). Indeed, since the vectors xi (i = 1, 2, . . ., m)
are linearly independent they are all non-zero (see Exercise 1.2). Thus, we can
deﬁne the ﬁrst unit vector by
e1 =
x1
∥x1∥.
(1.10)
Next, we consider the vector
e′
2 = x2 −(x2 · e1) e1
(1.11)
orthogonal to e1. This holds for the unit vector e2 = e′
2/∥e′
2∥as well. It
is also seen that ∥e′
2∥=

e′
2 · e′
2 ̸= 0 because otherwise e′
2 = 0 and thus
x2 = (x2 · e1) e1 = (x2 · e1) ∥x1∥−1 x1. However, the latter result contradicts
the fact that the vectors x1 and x2 are linearly independent.
Further, we proceed to construct the vectors
e′
3 = x3 −(x3 · e2) e2 −(x3 · e1) e1,
e3 =
e′
3
∥e′
3∥
(1.12)
orthogonal to e1 and e2. Repeating this procedure we ﬁnally obtain the set
of orthonormal vectors e1, e2, . . . , em. Since these vectors are non-zero and
mutually orthogonal, they are linearly independent (see Exercise 1.6). In the
case m = n, this set represents, according to Theorem 1.3, the orthonormal
basis (1.8) in En.
With respect to an orthonormal basis the scalar product of two vectors
x = xiei and y = yiei in En takes the form
x · y = x1y1 + x2y2 + . . . + xnyn.
(1.13)
For the length of the vector x (1.6) we thus obtain the Pythagoras formula
∥x∥=

x1x1 + x2x2 + . . . + xnxn,
x ∈En.

1.5 Dual Bases
Deﬁnition 1.9. Let G = {g1, g2, . . . , gn} be a basis in the n-dimensional Eu-
clidean space En. Then, a basis G′ =

g1, g2, . . . , gn
of En is called dual to
G, if
gi · gj = δj
i ,
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(1.15)
In the following we show that a set of vectors G′ =

g1, g2, . . . , gn
satisfying
the conditions (1.15) always exists, is unique and forms a basis in En.
Let E = {e1, e2, . . . , en} be an orthonormal basis in En. Since G also
represents a basis, we can write
ei = αj
igj,
gi = βj
i ej,
i = 1, 2, . . ., n,
(1.16)
where αj
i and βj
i (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) denote the components of ei and gi, respec-
tively. Inserting the ﬁrst relation (1.16) into the second one yields
gi = βj
i αk
j gk,
⇒
0 =

βj
i αk

gk,
i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(1.17)
Since the vectors gi are linearly independent we obtain
βj
i αk
j = δk
i ,
i, k = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(1.18)
Let further
gi = αi
jej,
i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
(1.19)
where and henceforth we set ej = ej (j = 1, 2, . . . , n) in order to take the
advantage of Einstein’s summation convention. By virtue of (1.8), (1.16) and
(1.18) one ﬁnally ﬁnds
gi·gj =


αj
l el
= βk
i αj
l δl
k = βk
i αj
k = δj
i ,
i, j = 1, 2, . . ., n. (1.20)
Next, we show that the vectors gi (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) (1.19) are linearly indepen-
dent and for this reason form a basis of En. Assume on the contrary that
aigi = 0,
where not all scalars ai (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) are zero. The scalar product of this
relation with the vectors gj (j = 1, 2, . . . , n) leads to a contradiction. Indeed,
we obtain in this case
0 = aigi · gj = aiδi
j = aj,
j = 1, 2, . . ., n.
The next important question is whether the dual basis is unique. Let G′ =

g1, g2, . . . , gn
and H′ =

h1, h2, . . . , hn
be two arbitrary non-coinciding
bases in En, both dual to G = {g1, g2, . . . , gn}. Then,

1.5 Dual Bases
9
hi = hi
jgj,
i = 1, 2, . . ., n.
Forming the scalar product with the vectors gj (j = 1, 2, . . ., n) we can con-
clude that the bases G′ and H′ coincide:
δi
j = hi · gj =

hi
kgk
· gj = hi
kδk
j = hi
j
⇒
hi = gi,
i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Thus, we have proved the following theorem.
Theorem 1.6. To every basis in an Euclidean space En there exists a unique
dual basis.
Relation (1.19) enables to determine the dual basis. However, it can also be
obtained without any orthonormal basis. Indeed, let gi be a basis dual to
gi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n). Then
gi = gijgj,
gi = gijgj,
i = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(1.21)
Inserting the second relation (1.21) into the ﬁrst one yields
gi = gijgjkgk,
i = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(1.22)
Multiplying scalarly with the vectors gl we have by virtue of (1.15)
δi
l = gijgjkδk
l = gijgjl,
i, l = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(1.23)
Thus, we see that the matrices [gkj] and

gkj
are inverse to each other such
that

gkj
= [gkj]−1 .
(1.24)
Now, multiplying scalarly the ﬁrst and second relation (1.21) by the vectors
gj and gj (j = 1, 2, . . . , n), respectively, we obtain with the aid of (1.15) the
following important identities:
gij = gji = gi · gj,
gij = gji = gi · gj,
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(1.25)
By deﬁnition (1.8) the orthonormal basis in En is self-dual, so that
ei = ei,
ei · ej = δj
i ,
i, j = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(1.26)
With the aid of the dual bases one can represent an arbitrary vector in En by
x = xigi = xigi,
∀x ∈En,
(1.27)
where
xi = x · gi,
xi = x · gi,
i = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(1.28)
Indeed, using (1.15) we can write

10
1 Vectors and Tensors in a Finite-Dimensional Space
x · gi =

xjgj

· gi = xjδi
j = xi,
x · gi =

xjgj
· gi = xjδj
i = xi,
i = 1, 2, . . ., n.
The components of a vector with respect to the dual bases are suitable for
calculating the scalar product. For example, for two arbitrary vectors x =
xigi = xigi and y = yigi = yigi we obtain
x · y = xiyjgij = xiyjgij = xiyi = xiyi.
(1.29)
The length of the vector x can thus be written by
∥x∥=

xixjgij =

xixjgij =

xixi.
(1.30)
Example. Dual basis in E3. Let G = {g1, g2, g3} be a basis of the
three-dimensional Euclidean space and
g = [g1g2g3] ,
(1.31)
where [• • •] denotes the mixed product of vectors. It is deﬁned by
[abc] = (a × b) · c = (b × c) · a = (c × a) · b,
(1.32)
where “×” denotes the vector (also called cross or outer) product of vectors.
Consider the following set of vectors:
g1 = g−1g2 × g3,
g2 = g−1g3 × g1,
g3 = g−1g1 × g2.
(1.33)
It seen that the vectors (1.33) satisfy conditions (1.15), are linearly indepen-
dent (Exercise 1.11) and consequently form the basis dual to gi (i = 1, 2, 3).
Further, it can be shown that
g2 = |gij| ,
(1.34)
where |•| denotes the determinant of the matrix [•]. Indeed, with the aid of
(1.16)2 we obtain
g = [g1g2g3] =

where the orthonormal vectors e1, e2 and e3 are numerated in such a way
that they form a right-handed system. In this case, [e1e2e3] = 1.
On the other hand, we can write again using (1.16)2
gij = gi · gj =

The latter sum can be represented as a product of two matrices so that

Since the determinant of the matrix product is equal to the product of the
matrix determinants we ﬁnally have
|gij| =

(1.38)
With the aid of the permutation symbol (1.36) one can represent the identities
(1.33) by
gi × gj = eijk g gk,
i, j = 1, 2, 3,
(1.39)
which also delivers
[gigjgk] = eijk g,
i, j, k = 1, 2, 3.
(1.40)
Similarly to (1.34) one can also show that (see Exercise 1.12)

g1g2g32 =
gij = g−2.
(1.41)
Thus,
gi × gj = eijk
g gk,

(1.42)
which yields by analogy with (1.40)

gigjgk

i, j, k = 1, 2, 3.
(1.43)
Relations (1.39) and (1.42) permit a useful representation of the vector prod-
uct. Indeed, let a = aigi = aigi and b = bjgj = bjgj be two arbitrary vectors
in E3. Then,
a × b =

For the orthonormal basis in E3 relations (1.39) and (1.42) reduce to
ei × ej = eijkek = eijkek,
i, j = 1, 2, 3,
(1.45)
so that the vector product (1.44) can be written by

1.6 Second-Order Tensor as a Linear Mapping
Let us consider a set Linn of all linear mappings of one vector into another
one within En. Such a mapping can be written as
y = Ax,
y ∈En,
∀x ∈En,
∀A ∈Linn.
(1.47)
Elements of the set Linn are called second-order tensors or simply tensors.
Linearity of the mapping (1.47) is expressed by the following relations:
A (x + y) = Ax + Ay,
∀x, y ∈En,
∀A ∈Linn,
(1.48)
A (αx) = α (Ax) ,
∀x ∈En,
∀α ∈R,
∀A ∈Linn.
(1.49)
Further, we deﬁne the product of a tensor by a scalar number α ∈R as
(αA) x = α (Ax) = A (αx) ,
∀x ∈En
(1.50)
and the sum of two tensors A and B as
(A + B) x = Ax + Bx,
∀x ∈En.
(1.51)
Thus, properties (A.1), (A.2) and (B.1-B.4) apply to the set Linn. Setting in
(1.50) α = −1 we obtain the negative tensor by
−A = (−1) A.
(1.52)
Further, we deﬁne a zero tensor 0 in the following manner
0x = 0,
∀x ∈En,
(1.53)
so that the elements of the set Linn also fulﬁll conditions (A.3) and (A.4) and
accordingly form a vector space.

1.6 Second-Order Tensor as a Linear Mapping
13
The properties of second-order tensors can thus be summarized by
A + B = B + A,
(addition is commutative),
(1.54)
A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C,
(addition is associative),
(1.55)
0 + A = A,
(1.56)
A + (−A) = 0,
(1.57)
α (βA) = (αβ) A,
(multiplication by scalars is associative),
(1.58)
1A = A,
(1.59)
α (A + B) = αA + αB,
(multiplication by scalars is distributive
with respect to tensor addition),
(1.60)
(α + β) A = αA + βA,
(multiplication by scalars is distributive
with respect to scalar addition),
∀A, B, C ∈Linn, ∀α, β ∈R.
(1.61)
Example. Vector product in E3. The vector product of two vectors in
E3 represents again a vector in E3
z = w × x,
z ∈E3,
∀w, x ∈E3.
(1.62)
According to (1.44) the mapping x →z is linear so that
w × (αx) = α (w × x) ,
w × (x + y) = w × x + w × y,
∀w, x, y ∈E3,
∀α ∈R.
(1.63)
Thus, it can be described by means of a tensor of the second order by
w × x = Wx,
W ∈Lin3,
∀x ∈E3.
(1.64)
The tensor which forms the vector product by a vector w according to (1.64)
will be denoted in the following by ˆw. Thus, we write
w × x = ˆwx.
(1.65)
Example. Representation of a rotation by a second-order tensor.
A rotation of a vector a in E3 about an axis yields another vector r in E3. It
can be shown that the mapping a →r (a) is linear such that
r (αa) = αr (a) , r (a + b) = r (a) + r (b) , ∀α ∈R, ∀a, b ∈E3.
(1.66)
Thus, it can again be described by a second-order tensor as
r (a) = Ra,
∀a ∈E3,
R ∈Lin3.
(1.67)
This tensor R is referred to as rotation tensor.

Fig. 1.2. Finite rotation of a vector in E3
Let us construct the rotation tensor which rotates an arbitrary vector a ∈
E3 about an axis speciﬁed by a unit vector e ∈E3 (see Fig. 1.2). Decomposing
the vector a by a = a∗+ x in two vectors along and perpendicular to the
rotation axis we can write
˜a = a∗+ x cos ω + y sin ω = a∗+ (a −a∗) cos ω + y sin ω,
(1.68)
where ω denotes the rotation angle. By virtue of the geometric identities
a∗= (a · e) e = (e ⊗e) a,
y = e×x = e×(a −a∗) = e×a = ˆea, (1.69)
where “⊗” denotes the so-called tensor product (1.75) (see Sect. 1.7), we
obtain
˜a = cos ωa + sin ωˆea + (1 −cos ω) (e ⊗e) a.
(1.70)
Thus the rotation tensor can be given by
R = cos ωI + sin ωˆe + (1 −cos ω) e ⊗e,
(1.71)
where I denotes the so-called identity tensor (1.84) (see Sect. 1.7).
Example. The Cauchy stress tensor as a linear mapping of the
unit surface normal into the Cauchy stress vector. Let us consider a
body B in the current conﬁguration at a time t. In order to deﬁne the stress
in some point P let us further imagine a smooth surface going through P and
separating B into two parts (Fig. 1.3). Then, one can deﬁne a force Δp and
a couple Δm resulting from the forces exerted by the (hidden) material on

one side of the surface ΔA and acting on the material on the other side of
this surface. Let the area ΔA tend to zero keeping P as inner point. A basic
postulate of continuum mechanics is that the limit
t =
lim
ΔA→0
Δp
ΔA
exists and is ﬁnal. The so-deﬁned vector t is called Cauchy stress vector.
Cauchy’s fundamental postulate states that the vector t depends on the sur-
face only through the outward unit normal n. In other words, the Cauchy
stress vector is the same for all surfaces through P which have n as the nor-
mal in P. Further, according to Cauchy’s theorem the mapping n →t is linear
provided t is a continuous function of the position vector x at P. Hence, this
mapping can be described by a second-order tensor σ called the Cauchy stress
tensor so that
t = σn.
(1.72)
On the basis of the “right” mapping (1.47) we can also deﬁne the “left”
one by the following condition
(yA) · x = y · (Ax) ,
∀x ∈En,
A ∈Linn.
(1.73)
First, it should be shown that for all y ∈En there exists a unique vector yA ∈
En satisfying the condition (1.73) for all x ∈En. Let G = {g1, g2, . . . , gn}
and G′ =

g1, g2, . . . , gn
be dual bases in En. Then, we can represent two
arbitrary vectors x, y ∈En, by x = xigi and y = yigi. Now, consider the
vector
yA = yi

gi ·

Agj
gj.
It holds: (yA) · x = yixj

gi ·

Agj
. On the other hand, we obtain the same
result also by

16
1 Vectors and Tensors in a Finite-Dimensional Space
y · (Ax) = y ·

xjAgj
= yixj

gi ·

Agj
.
Further, we show that the vector yA, satisfying condition (1.73) for all x ∈En,
is unique. Conversely, let a, b ∈En be two such vectors. Then, we have
a · x = b · x ⇒(a −b) · x = 0, ∀x ∈En ⇒(a −b) · (a −b) = 0,
which by axiom (C.4) implies that a = b.
Since the order of mappings in (1.73) is irrelevant we can write them
without brackets and dots as follows
y · (Ax) = (yA) · x = yAx.
(1.74)
1.7 Tensor Product, Representation of a Tensor with
Respect to a Basis
The tensor product plays an important role since it enables to construct a
second-order tensor from two vectors. In order to deﬁne the tensor product
we consider two vectors a, b ∈En. An arbitrary vector x ∈En can be mapped
into another vector a (b · x) ∈En. This mapping is denoted by symbol “⊗”
as a ⊗b. Thus,
(a ⊗b) x = a (b · x) ,
a, b ∈En, ∀x ∈En.
(1.75)
It can be shown that the mapping (1.75) fulﬁlls the conditions (1.48-1.50) and
for this reason is linear. Indeed, by virtue of (B.1), (B.4), (C.2) and (C.3) we
can write
(a ⊗b) (x + y) = a [b · (x + y)] = a (b · x + b · y)
= (a ⊗b) x + (a ⊗b) y,
(1.76)
(a ⊗b) (αx) = a [b · (αx)] = α (b · x) a
= α (a ⊗b) x,
a, b ∈En, ∀x, y ∈En, ∀α ∈R.
(1.77)
Thus, the tensor product of two vectors represents a second-order tensor.
Further, it holds
c ⊗(a + b) = c ⊗a + c ⊗b,
(a + b) ⊗c = a ⊗c + b ⊗c,
(1.78)
(αa) ⊗(βb) = αβ (a ⊗b) ,
a, b, c ∈En, ∀α, β ∈R.
(1.79)
Indeed, mapping an arbitrary vector x ∈En by both sides of these relations
and using (1.51) and (1.75) we obtain
c ⊗(a + b) x = c (a · x + b · x) = c (a · x) + c (b · x)
= (c ⊗a) x + (c ⊗b) x = (c ⊗a + c ⊗b) x,

1.7 Tensor Product, Representation of a Tensor with Respect to a Basis
17
[(a + b) ⊗c] x = (a + b) (c · x) = a (c · x) + b (c · x)
= (a ⊗c) x + (b ⊗c) x = (a ⊗c + b ⊗c) x,
(αa) ⊗(βb) x = (αa) (βb · x)
= αβa (b · x) = αβ (a ⊗b) x,
∀x ∈En.
For the “left” mapping by the tensor a⊗b we obtain from (1.73) (see Exercise
1.19)
y (a ⊗b) = (y · a) b,
∀y ∈En.
(1.80)
We have already seen that the set of all second-order tensors Linn repre-
sents a vector space. In the following, we show that a basis of Linn can be
constructed with the aid of the tensor product (1.75).
Theorem 1.7. Let F = {f 1, f 2, . . . , f n} and G = {g1, g2, . . . , gn} be two
arbitrary bases of En. Then, the tensors f i ⊗gj (i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n) represent
a basis of Linn. The dimension of the vector space Linn is thus n2.
Proof. First, we prove that every tensor in Linn represents a linear combi-
nation of the tensors f i ⊗gj (i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n). Indeed, let A ∈Linn be an
arbitrary second-order tensor. Consider the following linear combination
A′ =

f iAgj
f i ⊗gj,
where the vectors f i and gi (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) form the bases dual to F and G,
respectively. The tensors A and A′ coincide if and only if
A′x = Ax,
∀x ∈En.
(1.81)
Let x = xjgj. Then
A′x =

f iAgj
f i ⊗gj

xkgk
=

f iAgj
f ixkδk
j = xj

f iAgj
f i.
On the other hand, Ax = xjAgj. By virtue of (1.27-1.28) we can repre-
sent the vectors Agj (j = 1, 2, . . . , n) with respect to the basis F by Agj =

f i ·

Agj
f i =

f iAgj
f i (j = 1, 2, . . . , n). Hence,
Ax = xj

f iAgj
f i.
Thus, it is seen that condition (1.81) is satisﬁed for all x ∈En. Finally,
we show that the tensors f i ⊗gj (i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n) are linearly independent.
Otherwise, there would exist scalars αij (i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n), not all zero, such
that
αijf i ⊗gj = 0.
The right mapping of gk (k = 1, 2, . . ., n) by this tensor equality yields then:
αikf i = 0 (k = 1, 2, . . ., n). This contradicts, however, the fact that the vec-
tors f k (k = 1, 2, . . . , n) form a basis and are therefore linearly independent.

18
1 Vectors and Tensors in a Finite-Dimensional Space
For the representation of second-order tensors we will in the following use
primarily the bases gi ⊗gj, gi ⊗gj, gi ⊗gj or gi ⊗gj (i, j = 1, 2, . . ., n). With
respect to these bases a tensor A ∈Linn is written as
A = Aijgi ⊗gj = Aijgi ⊗gj = Ai
·jgi ⊗gj = A j
i·gi ⊗gj
(1.82)
with the components (see Exercise 1.20)
Aij = giAgj,
Aij = giAgj,
Ai
·j = giAgj,
A j
i· = giAgj,
i, j = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(1.83)
Note, that the subscript dot indicates the position of the above index. For
example, for the components Ai
·j, i is the ﬁrst index while for the components
A i
j·, i is the second index.
Of special importance is the so-called identity tensor I. It is deﬁned by
Ix = x,
∀x ∈En.
(1.84)
With the aid of (1.25), (1.82) and (1.83) the components of the identity tensor
can be expressed by
Iij = giIgj = gi · gj = gij,
Iij = giIgj = gi · gj = gij,
Ii
·j = I j
i· = Ii
j = giIgj = giIgj = gi · gj = gi · gj = δi
j,
(1.85)
where i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n. Thus,
I = gijgi ⊗gj = gijgi ⊗gj = gi ⊗gi = gi ⊗gi.
(1.86)
It is seen that the components (1.85)1,2 of the identity tensor are given by
relation (1.25). In view of (1.30) they characterize metric properties of the
Euclidean space and are referred to as metric coeﬃcients. For this reason, the
identity tensor is frequently called metric tensor. With respect to an orthonor-
mal basis relation (1.86) reduces to
I =
n
	
i=1
ei ⊗ei.
(1.87)
1.8 Change of the Basis, Transformation Rules
Now, we are going to clarify how the vector and tensor components transform
with the change of the basis. Let x be a vector and A a second-order tensor.
According to (1.27) and (1.82)
x = xigi = xigi,
(1.88)

With the aid of (1.21) and (1.28) we can write
xi = x · gi = x ·

gijgj

xi = x · gi = x ·

gijgj
= xjgji, (1.90)
where i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Similarly we obtain by virtue of (1.83)
Aij = giAgj = giA

i· gkj = gilAlkgkj,
(1.92)
where i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n. The transformation rules (1.90-1.92) hold not only for
dual bases. Indeed, let gi and ¯gi (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) be two arbitrary bases in
En, so that
x = xigi = ¯xi¯gi,
(1.93)
A = Aijgi ⊗gj = ¯A
ij¯gi ⊗¯gj.
(1.94)
By means of the relations
gi = aj
i ¯gj,
i = 1, 2, . . ., n
(1.95)
one thus obtains
x = xigi = xiaj

⇒
¯xj = xiaj

1.9 Special Operations with Second-Order Tensors
In Sect. 1.6 we have seen that the set Linn represents a ﬁnite-dimensional
vector space. Its elements are second-order tensors that can be treated as
vectors in En2 with all the operations speciﬁc for vectors such as summation,
multiplication by a scalar or a scalar product (the latter one will be deﬁned
for second-order tensors in Sect. 1.10). However, in contrast to conventional
vectors in the Euclidean space, for second-order tensors one can additionally
deﬁne some special operations as for example composition, transposition or
inversion.

20
1 Vectors and Tensors in a Finite-Dimensional Space
Composition (simple contraction). Let A, B ∈Linn be two second-
order tensors. The tensor C = AB is called composition of A and B if
Cx = A (Bx) ,
∀x ∈En.
(1.98)
For the left mapping (1.73) one can write
y (AB) = (yA) B,
∀y ∈En.
(1.99)
In order to prove the last relation we use again (1.73) and (1.98):
y (AB) x = y · [(AB) x] = y · [A (Bx)]
= (yA) · (Bx) = [(yA) B] · x,
∀x ∈En.
The composition of tensors (1.98) is generally not commutative so that AB ̸=
BA. Two tensors A and B are called commutative if on the contrary AB =
BA. Besides, the composition of tensors is characterized by the following
properties (see Exercise 1.24):
A0 = 0A = 0,
AI = IA = A,
(1.100)
A (B + C) = AB + AC,
(B + C) A = BA + CA,
(1.101)
A (BC) = (AB) C.
(1.102)
For example, the distributive rule (1.101)1 can be proved as follows
[A (B + C)] x = A [(B + C) x] = A (Bx + Cx) = A (Bx) + A (Cx)
= (AB) x + (AC) x = (AB + AC) x,
∀x ∈En.
For the tensor product (1.75) the composition (1.98) yields
(a ⊗b) (c ⊗d) = (b · c) a ⊗d,
a, b, c, d ∈En.
(1.103)
Indeed, by virtue of (1.75), (1.77) and (1.98)
(a ⊗b) (c ⊗d) x = (a ⊗b) [(c ⊗d) x] = (d · x) (a ⊗b) c
= (d · x) (b · c) a = (b · c) (a ⊗d) x
= [(b · c) a ⊗d] x,
∀x ∈En.
Thus, we can write
AB = AikB j
k·gi ⊗gj = AikBkjgi ⊗gj
= Ai
·kBk
·jgi ⊗gj = A k
i· Bkjgi ⊗gj,
(1.104)
where A and B are given in the form (1.82).
Powers, polynomials and functions of second-order tensors. On
the basis of the composition (1.98) one deﬁnes by

k, l = 0, 1, 2 . . .

(1.108)
g (A): Linn →Linn represents a tensor function mapping one second-order
tensor into another one within Linn. By this means one can deﬁne various
tensor functions. Of special interest is the exponential one

(1.109)
given by the inﬁnite power series.
Transposition. The transposed tensor AT is deﬁned by:
ATx = xA,
∀x ∈En,
(1.110)
so that one can also write
Ay = yAT,
xAy = yATx,
∀x, y ∈En.
(1.111)
Indeed,
x · (Ay) = (xA) · y = y ·

ATx

= yATx = x ·

yAT
, ∀x, y ∈En.
Consequently,

ATT = A.
(1.112)
Transposition represents a linear operation over a second-order tensor since
(A + B)T = AT + BT
(1.113)
and
(αA)T = αAT,
∀α ∈R.
(1.114)
The composition of second-order tensors is transposed by

22
1 Vectors and Tensors in a Finite-Dimensional Space
(AB)T = BTAT.
(1.115)
Indeed, in view of (1.99) and (1.110)
(AB)T x = x (AB) = (xA) B = BT (xA) = BTATx,
∀x ∈En.
For the tensor product of two vectors a, b ∈En we further obtain by use of
(1.75) and (1.80)
(a ⊗b)T = b ⊗a.
(1.116)
This ensures the existence and uniqueness of the transposed tensor. Indeed,
every tensor A in Linn can be represented with respect to the tensor product
of the basis vectors in En in the form (1.82). Hence, considering (1.116) we
have
AT = Aijgj ⊗gi = Aijgj ⊗gi = Ai
·jgj ⊗gi = A j
i·gj ⊗gi,
(1.117)
or
AT = Ajigi ⊗gj = Ajigi ⊗gj = Aj
·igi ⊗gj = A i
j·gi ⊗gj.
(1.118)
Comparing the latter result with the original representation (1.82) one ob-
serves that the components of the transposed tensor can be expressed by

AT
ij = Aji,

ATij = Aji,
(1.119)

AT j
i· = Aj
·i = gjkA l

lowing steps

ATi
·j = giATgj = gjAgi = gj


gi = gjkAk

According to (1.119) the homogeneous (covariant or contravariant) compo-
nents of the transposed tensor can simply be obtained by reﬂecting the matrix
of the original components from the main diagonal. It does not, however, hold
for the mixed components (1.120).
The transposition operation (1.110) gives rise to the deﬁnition of symmet-
ric MT = M and skew-symmetric second-order tensors WT = −W.
Obviously, the identity tensor is symmetric
IT = I.
(1.121)
Indeed,
xIy = x · y = y · x = yIx = xITy,
∀x, y ∈En.

1.9 Special Operations with Second-Order Tensors
23
Inversion. Let
y = Ax.
(1.122)
A tensor A ∈Linn is referred to as invertible if there exists a tensor A−1 ∈
Linn satisfying the condition
x = A−1y,
∀x ∈En.
(1.123)
The tensor A−1 is called inverse of A. The set of all invertible tensors Invn =

A ∈Linn : ∃A−1
forms a subset of all second-order tensors Linn.
Inserting (1.122) into (1.123) yields
x = A−1y = A−1 (Ax) =

A−1A

x,
∀x ∈En
and consequently
A−1A = I.
(1.124)
Theorem 1.8. A tensor A is invertible if and only if Ax = 0 implies that
x = 0.
Proof. First we prove the suﬃciency. To this end, we map the vector equation
Ax = 0 by A−1. According to (1.124) it yields: 0 = A−1Ax = Ix = x. To
prove the necessity we consider a basis G = {g1, g2, . . . , gn} in En. It can be
shown that the vectors hi = Agi (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) form likewise a basis of En.
Conversely, let these vectors be linearly dependent so that aihi = 0, where not
all scalars ai (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) are zero. Then, 0 = aihi = aiAgi = Aa, where
a = aigi ̸= 0, which contradicts the assumption of the theorem. Now, consider
the tensor A′ = gi ⊗hi, where the vectors hi are dual to hi (i = 1, 2, . . ., n).
One can show that this tensor is inverse to A, such that A′ = A−1. Indeed,
let x = xigi be an arbitrary vector in En. Then, y = Ax = xiAgi = xihi
and therefore A′y = gi ⊗hi 
xjhj

= gixjδi
j = xigi = x.
Conversely, it can be shown that an invertible tensor A is inverse to A−1 and
consequently
AA−1 = I.
(1.125)
For the proof we again consider the bases gi and Agi (i = 1, 2, . . ., n). Let
y = yiAgi be an arbitrary vector in En. Let further x = A−1y = yigi in
view of (1.124). Then, Ax = yiAgi = y which implies that the tensor A is
inverse to A−1.
Relation (1.125) implies the uniqueness of the inverse. Indeed, if A−1 and

A−1 are two distinct tensors both inverse to A then there exists at least one
vector y ∈En such that A−1y ̸= 
A−1y. Mapping both sides of this vector
inequality by A and taking (1.125) into account we immediately come to the
contradiction.

24
1 Vectors and Tensors in a Finite-Dimensional Space
By means of (1.115), (1.121) and (1.125) we can write (see Exercise 1.37)

A−1T =

AT−1 = A−T.
(1.126)
The composition of two arbitrary invertible tensors A and B is inverted by
(AB)−1 = B−1A−1.
(1.127)
Indeed, let
y = ABx.
Mapping both sides of this vector identity by A−1 and then by B−1, we obtain
with the aid of (1.124)
x = B−1A−1y,
∀x ∈En.
On the basis of transposition and inversion one deﬁnes the so-called orthogonal
tensors. They do not change after consecutive transposition and inversion and
form the following subset of Linn:
Orthn =

Q ∈Linn : Q = Q−T
.
(1.128)
For orthogonal tensors we can write in view of (1.124) and (1.125)
QQT = QTQ = I,
∀Q ∈Orthn.
(1.129)
For example, one can show that the rotation tensor (1.71) is orthogonal. To
this end, we complete the vector e deﬁning the rotation axis (Fig. 1.2) to
an orthonormal basis {e, q, p} such that e = q × p. Then, using the vector
identity (see Exercise 1.15)
p (q · x) −q (p · x) = (q × p) × x,
∀x ∈E3
(1.130)
we can write
ˆe = p ⊗q −q ⊗p.
(1.131)
The rotation tensor (1.71) takes thus the form
R = cos ωI + sin ω (p ⊗q −q ⊗p) + (1 −cos ω) (e ⊗e) .
(1.132)
Hence,
RRT = [cos ωI + sin ω (p ⊗q −q ⊗p) + (1 −cos ω) (e ⊗e)]
[cos ωI −sin ω (p ⊗q −q ⊗p) + (1 −cos ω) (e ⊗e)]
= cos2 ωI + sin2 ω (e ⊗e) + sin2 ω (p ⊗p + q ⊗q) = I.

1.10 Scalar Product of Second-Order Tensors
25
It is interesting that the exponential function (1.109) of a skew-symmetric
tensors represents an orthogonal tensor. Indeed, keeping in mind that a skew-
symmetric tensor W commutes with its transposed counterpart WT = −W
and using the identities exp (A + B) = exp (A) exp (B) for commutative ten-
sors (Exercise 1.27) and

AkT =

ATk for integer k (Exercise 1.35) we can
write
I = exp (0) = exp (W −W) = exp

W + WT
= exp (W) exp

WT
= exp (W) [exp (W)]T ,
∀W ∈Skewn.
(1.133)
1.10 Scalar Product of Second-Order Tensors
Consider two second-order tensors a⊗b and c⊗d given in terms of the tensor
product (1.75). Their scalar product can be deﬁned in the following manner:
(a ⊗b) : (c ⊗d) = (a · c) (b · d) ,
a, b, c, d ∈En.
(1.134)
It leads to the following identity (Exercise 1.39):
c ⊗d : A = cAd = dATc.
(1.135)
For two arbitrary tensors A and B given in the form (1.82) we thus obtain
A : B = AijBij = AijBij = Ai
·jB j
i· = A j
i·Bi
·j.
(1.136)
Similar to vectors the scalar product of tensors is a real function characterized
by the following properties (see Exercise 1.40)
D. (D.1) A : B = B : A (commutative rule),
(D.2) A : (B + C) = A : B + A : C (distributive rule),
(D.3) α (A : B) = (αA) : B = A : (αB) (associative rule for multiplica-
tion by a scalar),
∀A, B ∈Linn, ∀α ∈R,
(D.4) A : A ≥0 ∀A ∈Linn,
A : A = 0 if and only if A = 0.
We prove for example the property (D.4). To this end, we represent the tensor
A with respect to an orthonormal basis (1.8) in En as: A = Aijei ⊗ej =
Aijei ⊗ej, where Aij = Aij, (i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n), since ei = ei (i = 1, 2, . . ., n).
Keeping (1.136) in mind we then obtain:
A : A = AijAij =
n
	
i,j=1
AijAij =
n
	
i,j=1

Aij2 ≥0.
Using this important property one can deﬁne the norm of a second-order
tensor by:

26
1 Vectors and Tensors in a Finite-Dimensional Space
∥A∥= (A : A)1/2 ,
A ∈Linn.
(1.137)
For the scalar product of tensors one of which is given by a composition we
can write
A : (BC) =

BTA

: C =

ACT

(1.138)
We prove this identity ﬁrst for the tensor products:
(a ⊗b) : [(c ⊗d) (e ⊗f)] = (d · e) [(a ⊗b) : (c ⊗f)]
= (d · e) (a · c) (b · f) ,

(c ⊗d)T (a ⊗b)

: (e ⊗f) = [(d ⊗c) (a ⊗b)] : (e ⊗f)


(a ⊗b) (e ⊗f)T

= (b · f) [(a ⊗e) : (c ⊗d)]
= (d · e) (a · c) (b · f) .
For three arbitrary tensors A, B and C given in the form (1.82) we can write
in view of (1.120) and (1.136)

(1.139)
Similarly we can prove that
A : B = AT : BT.
(1.140)
On the basis of the scalar product one deﬁnes the trace of second-order tensors
by:
trA = A : I.
(1.141)
For the tensor product (1.75) the trace (1.141) yields in view of (1.135)
tr (a ⊗b) = a · b.
(1.142)
With the aid of the relation (1.138) we further write
tr (AB) = A : BT = AT : B.
(1.143)
In view of (D.1) this also implies that
tr (AB) = tr (BA) .
(1.144)

1.11 Decompositions of Second-Order Tensors

1.11 Decompositions of Second-Order Tensors
Additive decomposition into a symmetric and a skew-symmetric
part. Every second-order tensor can be decomposed additively into a sym-
metric and a skew-symmetric part by
A = symA + skewA,
(1.145)
where
symA = 1
2

A + AT
,
skewA = 1
2

A −AT
.
(1.146)
Symmetric and skew-symmetric tensors form subsets of Linn deﬁned by
Symn =

M ∈Linn : M = MT
,
(1.147)
Skewn =

W ∈Linn : W = −WT
.
(1.148)
One can easily show that these subsets represent vector spaces and can be
referred to as subspaces of Linn. Indeed, the axioms (A.1-A.4) and (B.1-B.4)
including operations with the zero tensor are valid both for symmetric and
skew-symmetric tensors. The zero tensor is the only linear mapping that is
both symmetric and skew-symmetric such that Symn∩Skewn = 0.
For every symmetric tensor M = Mijgi ⊗gj it follows from (1.119) that
Mij = Mji (i ̸= j, i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n). Thus, we can write
M =
n
	
i=1
Miigi ⊗gi +
n
	
i,j=1
i>j
Mij (gi ⊗gj + gj ⊗gi) ,
M ∈Symn. (1.149)
Similarly we can write for a skew-symmetric tensor
W =
n
	
i,j=1
i>j
Wij (gi ⊗gj −gj ⊗gi) ,
W ∈Skewn
(1.150)
taking into account that Wii = 0 and Wij = −Wji (i ̸= j, i, j = 1, 2, . . ., n).
Therefore, the basis of Symn is formed by n tensors gi ⊗gi and 1
2n (n −1)
tensors gi⊗gj +gj ⊗gi, while the basis of Skewn consists of 1
2n (n −1) tensors
gi ⊗gj −gj ⊗gi, where i > j = 1, 2, . . . , n. Thus, the dimensions of Symn
and Skewn are 1
2n (n + 1) and 1
2n (n −1), respectively. It follows from (1.145)
that any basis of Skewn complements any basis of Symn to a basis of Linn.
Obviously, symmetric and skew-symmetric tensors are mutually orthogo-
nal such that (see Exercise 1.43)
M : W = 0,
∀M ∈Symn, ∀W ∈Skewn.
(1.151)
Spaces characterized by this property are called orthogonal.

28
1 Vectors and Tensors in a Finite-Dimensional Space
Additive decomposition into a spherical and a deviatoric part.
For every second-order tensor A we can write
A = sphA + devA,
(1.152)
where
sphA = 1
ntr (A) I,
devA = A −1
ntr (A) I
(1.153)
denote its spherical and deviatoric part, respectively. Thus, every spherical
tensor S can be represented by S = αI, where α is a scalar number. In turn,
every deviatoric tensor D is characterized by the condition trD = 0. Just like
symmetric and skew-symmetric tensors, spherical and deviatoric tensors form
orthogonal subspaces of Linn.
1.12 Tensors of Higher Orders
Similarly to second-order tensors we can deﬁne tensors of higher orders. For
example, a third-order tensor can be deﬁned as a linear mapping from En to
Linn. Thus, we can write
Y = Ax,
Y ∈Linn,
∀x ∈En,
∀A ∈Linn,
(1.154)
where Linn denotes the set of all linear mappings of vectors in En into second-
order tensors in Linn. The tensors of the third order can likewise be repre-
sented with respect to a basis in Linn e.g. by
A = Aijkgi ⊗gj ⊗gk = Aijkgi ⊗gj ⊗gk
= Ai
·jkgi ⊗gj ⊗gk = A j
i·kgi ⊗gj ⊗gk.
(1.155)
For the components of the tensor A (1.155) we can thus write by analogy with
(1.139)
Aijk = Aij
··sgsk = Ai
·stgsjgtk = Arstgrigsjgtk,
Aijk = Ar
·jkgri = Ars
··kgrigsj = Arstgrigsjgtk.

Vector and Tensor Analysis in Euclidean Space
2.1 Vector- and Tensor-Valued Functions, Diﬀerential
Calculus
In the following we consider a vector-valued function x (t) and a tensor-valued
function A (t) of a real variable t. Henceforth, we assume that these functions
are continuous such that
lim
t→t0 [x (t) −x (t0)] = 0,
lim
t→t0 [A (t) −A (t0)] = 0
(2.1)
for all t0 within the deﬁnition domain. The functions x (t) and A (t) are called
diﬀerentiable if the following limits
dx
dt = lim
s→0
x (t + s) −x (t)
s
,
dA
dt = lim
s→0
A (t + s) −A (t)
s
(2.2)
exist and are ﬁnite. They are referred to as the derivatives of the vector- and
tensor-valued functions x (t) and A (t), respectively.
For diﬀerentiable vector- and tensor-valued functions the usual rules of
diﬀerentiation hold.
1) Product of a scalar function with a vector- or tensor-valued function:
d
dt [u (t) x (t)] = du
dt x (t) + u (t) dx
dt ,
(2.3)
d
dt [u (t) A (t)] = du
dt A (t) + u (t) dA
dt .
(2.4)
2) Mapping of a vector-valued function by a tensor-valued function:
d
dt [A (t) x (t)] = dA
dt x (t) + A (t) dx
dt .
(2.5)

3) Scalar product of two vector- or tensor-valued functions:

(2.6)
d
dt [A (t) : B (t)] = dA

(2.7)
4) Tensor product of two vector-valued functions:
d

dt ⊗y (t) + x (t) ⊗dy
dt .
(2.8)
5) Composition of two tensor-valued functions:
d

dt B (t) + A (t) dB

(2.9)
6) Chain rule:
d

(2.12)
where ∂/∂u denotes the partial derivative. It is deﬁned for vector and
tensor valued functions in the standard manner by
∂x (u,v)
∂u
= lim
s→0
x (u + s,v) −x (u,v)
s
,
(2.13)
∂A (u,v)
∂u
= lim
s→0
A (u + s,v) −A (u,v)
s
.
(2.14)
The above diﬀerentiation rules can be veriﬁed with the aid of elementary
diﬀerential calculus. For example, for the derivative of the composition of two
second-order tensors (2.9) we proceed as follows. Let us deﬁne two tensor-
valued functions by
O1 (s) = A (t + s) −A (t)
s
−dA
dt ,
O2 (s) = B (t + s) −B (t)
s

dt .
Bearing the deﬁnition of the derivative (2.2) in mind we have
lim
s→0 O1 (s) = 0,
lim
s→0 O2 (s) = 0.

2.2 Coordinates in Euclidean Space, Tangent Vectors
Deﬁnition 2.1. A coordinate system is a one to one correspondence between
vectors in the n-dimensional Euclidean space En and a set of n real numbers
(x1, x2, . . . , xn). These numbers are called coordinates of the corresponding
vectors.
Thus, we can write
xi = xi (r)
⇔
r = r

x1, x2, . . . , xn
,
(2.15)
where r ∈En and xi ∈R (i = 1, 2, . . ., n). Henceforth, we assume that the
functions xi = xi (r) and r = r

x1, x2, . . . , xn
are suﬃciently diﬀerentiable.
Example. Cylindrical coordinates in E3. The cylindrical coordinates
(Fig. 2.1) are deﬁned by
r = r (ϕ, z, r) = r cos ϕe1 + r sin ϕe2 + ze3
(2.16)
and
r =

(r · e1)2 + (r · e2)2,
z = r · e3,
ϕ =
⎧
⎨
⎩
arccos r · e1
r
if r · e2 ≥0,
2π −arccos r · e1
r
if r · e2 < 0,
(2.17)
where ei (i = 1, 2, 3) form an orthonormal basis in E3.

Fig. 2.1. Cylindrical coordinates in three-dimensional space
The vector components with respect to a ﬁxed basis, say H = {h1, h2, . . . ,
hn}, obviously represent its coordinates. Indeed, according to Theorem 1.5 of
the previous chapter the following correspondence is one to one
r = xihi
⇔
xi = r · hi,
i = 1, 2, . . ., n,
(2.18)
where r ∈En and H′ =

h1, h2, . . . , hn
is the basis dual to H. The compo-
nents xi (2.18)2 are referred to as the linear coordinates of the vector r.
Let xi = xi (r) and yi = yi (r) (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) be two arbitrary coordinate
systems in En. Since their correspondences are one to one, the functions
xi = ˆxi 
y1, y2, . . . , yn
⇔yi = ˆyi 
x1, x2, . . . , xn
, i = 1, 2, . . ., n (2.19)
are invertible. These functions describe the transformation of the coordinate
systems. Inserting one relation (2.19) into another one yields
yi = ˆyi 
ˆx1 
y1, y2, . . . , yn
,
ˆx2 
y1, y2, . . . , yn
, . . . , ˆxn 
y1, y2, . . . , yn
.
(2.20)

rule

i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n.

(2.22)
The determinant
∂yi/∂xk on the right hand side of (2.22) is referred to as Ja-
cobian determinant of the coordinate transformation yi = ˆyi 
x1, x2, . . . , xn
(i = 1, 2, . . . , n). Thus, we have proved the following theorem.
Theorem 2.1. If the transformation of the coordinates yi = ˆyi 
x1, x2, . . . , xn
admits an inverse form xi = ˆxi 
y1, y2, . . . , yn
(i = 1, 2, . . . , n) and if J and
K are the Jacobians of these transformations then JK = 1.
One of the important consequences of this theorem is that
J =

∂yi
∂xk
 ̸= 0.
(2.23)
Now, we consider an arbitrary curvilinear coordinate system
θi = θi (r) ⇔r = r

θ1, θ2, . . . , θn
,
(2.24)
where r ∈En and θi ∈R (i = 1, 2, . . . , n). The equations
θi = const, i = 1, 2, . . . , k −1, k + 1, . . . , n
(2.25)
deﬁne a curve in En called θk-coordinate line. The vectors
gk = ∂r
∂θk ,
k = 1, 2, . . ., n
(2.26)
are called the tangent vectors to the corresponding θk-coordinate lines (2.25).
One can verify that the tangent vectors are linearly independent and form thus
a basis of En. Conversely, let the vectors (2.26) be linearly dependent. Then,
there are scalars αi ∈R (i = 1, 2, . . . , n), not all zero, such that αigi = 0. Let
further xi = xi (r) (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) be linear coordinates in En with respect
to a basis H = {h1, h2, . . . , hn}. Then,
0 = αigi = αi ∂r
∂θi = αi ∂r
∂xj
∂xj
∂θi = αi ∂xj
∂θi hj.
Since the basis vectors hj (j = 1, 2, . . ., n) are linearly independent
αi ∂xj
∂θi = 0,
j = 1, 2, . . . , n.

38
2 Vector and Tensor Analysis in Euclidean Space
This is a homogeneous linear equation system with a non-trivial solution
αi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n). Hence,
∂xj/∂θi = 0, which obviously contradicts re-
lation (2.23).
Example. Tangent vectors and metric coeﬃcients of cylindrical
coordinates in E3. By means of (2.16) and (2.26) we obtain
g1 = ∂r
∂ϕ = −r sin ϕe1 + r cos ϕe2,
g2 = ∂r
∂z = e3,
g3 = ∂r
∂r = cos ϕe1 + sin ϕe2.
(2.27)
The metric coeﬃcients take by virtue of (1.24) and (1.25)2 the form
[gij] = [gi · gj] =
⎡
⎣
r2 0 0
0 1 0



= [gij]−1 =
⎡

⎦.
(2.28)
The dual basis results from (1.21)1 by
g1 = 1
r2 g1 = −1
r sin ϕe1 + 1
r cos ϕe2,
g2 = g2 = e3,
g3 = g3 = cos ϕe1 + sin ϕe2.
(2.29)
2.3 Coordinate Transformation. Co-, Contra- and Mixed
Variant Components
Let θi = θi (r) and ¯θi = ¯θi (r) (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) be two arbitrary coordinate
systems in En. It holds
¯gi = ∂r
∂¯θi = ∂r
∂θj
∂θj
∂¯θi = gj
∂θj
∂¯θi ,
i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(2.30)
If gi is the dual basis to gi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n), then we can write
¯gi = gj ∂¯θi
∂θj ,
i = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(2.31)
Indeed,
¯gi · ¯gj =
%

∂¯θj = δi
j, i, j = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(2.32)

2.3 Co-, Contra- and Mixed Variant Components
39
One can observe the diﬀerence in the transformation of the dual vectors (2.30)
and (2.31) which results from the change of the coordinate system. The trans-
formation rules of the form (2.30) and (2.31) and the corresponding variables
are referred to as covariant and contravariant, respectively. Covariant and
contravariant variables are denoted by lower and upper indices, respectively.
The co- and contravariant rules can also be recognized in the transforma-
tion of the components of vectors and tensors if they are related to tangent
vectors. Indeed, let
x = xigi = xigi = ¯xi¯gi = ¯xi¯gi,
(2.33)
A = Aijgi ⊗gj = Aijgi ⊗gj = Ai
·jgi ⊗gj
= ¯Aij¯gi ⊗¯gj = ¯A
ij¯gi ⊗¯gj = ¯A
i
·j¯gi ⊗¯gj.
(2.34)
Then, by means of (1.28), (1.83), (2.30) and (2.31) we obtain
¯xi = x · ¯gi = x ·
%
gj
∂θj
∂¯θi
&

(2.35)

(2.39)
Accordingly, the vector and tensor components xi, Aij and xi, Aij are called
covariant and contravariant, respectively. The tensor components Ai
·j are re-
ferred to as mixed variant. The transformation rules (2.35-2.39) can similarly
be written for tensors of higher orders as well. For example, one obtains for
third-order tensors
¯Aijk = ∂θr
∂¯θi
∂θs
∂¯θj
∂θt
∂¯θk Arst,
¯Aijk = ∂¯θi
∂θr
∂¯θj
∂θs
∂¯θk
∂θt Arst, . . .
(2.40)
From the very beginning we have supplied coordinates with upper indices
which imply the contravariant transformation rule. Indeed, let us consider
the transformation of a coordinate system ¯θi = ¯θi 
θ1, θ2, . . . , θn
(i = 1, 2,
. . . , n). It holds:
d¯θi = ∂¯θi
∂θk dθk,
i = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(2.41)

40
2 Vector and Tensor Analysis in Euclidean Space
Thus, the diﬀerentials of the coordinates really transform according to the
contravariant law (2.31).
Example. Transformation of linear coordinates into cylindrical
ones (2.16). Let xi = xi (r) be linear coordinates with respect to an or-
thonormal basis ei (i = 1, 2, 3) in E3:
xi = r · ei
⇔
r = xiei.
(2.42)
By means of (2.16) one can write
x1 = r cos ϕ,
x2 = r sin ϕ,
x3 = z
(2.43)
and consequently
∂x1
∂ϕ = −r sin ϕ = −x2,
∂x1
∂z = 0,
∂x1
∂r = cos ϕ = x1
r ,
∂x2
∂ϕ = r cos ϕ = x1,
∂x2
∂z = 0,
∂x2
∂r = sin ϕ = x2
r ,
∂x3
∂ϕ = 0,
∂x3
∂z = 1,
∂x3
∂r = 0.
(2.44)
The reciprocal derivatives can easily be obtained from (2.22) by inverting the
matrix

∂xi
∂ϕ
∂xi
∂z
∂xi
∂r

according to Theorem 2.1. This yields:
∂ϕ
∂x1 = −1
r sin ϕ = −x2
r2 ,
∂ϕ
∂x2 = 1
r cos ϕ = x1
r2 ,
∂ϕ
∂x3 = 0,

2.4 Gradient, Covariant and Contravariant Derivatives
Let Φ = Φ

θ1, θ2, . . . , θn
, x = x

θ1, θ2, . . . , θn
and A = A

θ1, θ2, . . . , θn
be, respectively, a scalar-, a vector- and a tensor-valued diﬀerentiable function
of the coordinates θi ∈R (i = 1, 2, . . . , n). Such functions of coordinates are
generally referred to as ﬁelds, as for example, the scalar ﬁeld, the vector ﬁeld
or the tensor ﬁeld. Due to the one to one correspondence (2.24) these ﬁelds
can alternatively be represented by
Φ = Φ (r) ,
x = x (r) ,
A = A (r) .
(2.46)

derivative of the scalar function Φ = Φ (r)

(2.48)
where s1 and s2 are assumed to be functions of s such that s1 = s and s2 = s.
With the aid of the chain rule this delivers

(2.50)
Thus, comparing (2.49) and (2.50) with the properties of the scalar product
(C.2) and (C.3) we can represent the directional derivative by

d


s=0
= gradΦ · a,
∀a ∈En,
(2.51)
where the vector gradΦ ∈En is referred to as gradient of the function Φ =
Φ (r).
Example. Gradient of the scalar function ∥r∥. Using the deﬁnition
of the directional derivative (2.47) we can write

∥r∥.
Comparing this result with (2.51) delivers
grad∥r∥=
r
∥r∥.
(2.52)
Similarly to (2.51) one deﬁnes the gradient of the vector function x = x (r)
and the gradient of the tensor function A = A (r):
d
dsx (r + sa)

s=0
= (gradx) a,
∀a ∈En,
(2.53)
d

(2.54)
Herein, gradx and gradA represent tensors of second and third order, respec-
tively.
In order to evaluate the above gradients (2.51), (2.53) and (2.54) we rep-
resent the vectors r and a with respect to the linear coordinates (2.18) as
r = xihi,
a = aihi.
(2.55)
With the aid of the chain rule we can further write for the directional deriva-
tive of the function Φ = Φ (r):

2.4 Gradient, Covariant and Contravariant Derivatives
43
Comparing this result with (2.51) and bearing in mind that it holds for all
vectors a we obtain
gradΦ = ∂Φ
∂xi hi.
(2.56)
The representation (2.56) can be rewritten in terms of arbitrary curvilinear co-
ordinates r = r

θ1, θ2, . . . , θn
and the corresponding tangent vectors (2.26).
Indeed, in view of (2.31) and (2.56)
gradΦ = ∂Φ
∂xi hi = ∂Φ
∂θk
∂θk
∂xi hi = ∂Φ
∂θi gi.
(2.57)
According to the deﬁnition (2.51) the gradient is independent of the choice
of the coordinate system. This can also be seen from relation (2.57). Indeed,
taking (2.31) into account we can write for an arbitrary coordinate system
¯θi = ¯θi 
θ1, θ2, . . . , θn
(i = 1, 2, . . ., n):
gradΦ = ∂Φ
∂θi gi = ∂Φ
∂¯θj
∂¯θj
∂θi gi = ∂Φ
∂¯θj ¯gj.
(2.58)
Similarly to relation (2.57) one can express the gradients of the vector-valued
function x = x (r) and the tensor-valued function A = A (r) by
gradx = ∂x
∂θi ⊗gi,
gradA = ∂A
∂θi ⊗gi.
(2.59)
Henceforth, the derivatives of the functions Φ = Φ

θ1, θ2, . . . , θn
, x =
x

θ1, θ2, . . . , θn
and A = A

θ1, θ2, . . . , θn
with respect to curvilinear coor-
dinates θi will be denoted shortly by
Φ,i = ∂Φ
∂θi ,
x,i = ∂x
∂θi ,
A,i = ∂A
∂θi .
(2.60)
They obey the covariant transformation rule (2.30) with respect to the index
i since
∂Φ
∂θi = ∂Φ
∂¯θk
∂¯θk
∂θi ,
∂x
∂θi = ∂x

∂A
∂θi = ∂A
∂¯θk
∂¯θk

(2.61)
and represent again a scalar, a vector and a second-order tensor, respectively.
The latter ones can be represented with respect to a basis as
x,i = xj|i gj = xj|i gj,
A,i = Akl|i gk ⊗gl = Akl|i gk ⊗gl = Ak
· l|i gk ⊗gl,
(2.62)
where (•)|i denotes some diﬀerential operator on the components of the vector
x or the tensor A. In view of (2.61) and (2.62) this operator transforms with
respect to the index i according to the covariant rule and is called covariant

44
2 Vector and Tensor Analysis in Euclidean Space
derivative. The covariant type of the derivative is accentuated by the lower
position of the coordinate index.
On the basis of the covariant derivative we can also deﬁne the contravariant
one. To this end, we formally apply the rule of component transformation
(1.90)1 as (•)|i= gij (•)|j. Accordingly,
xj|i= gikxj|k,
xj|i= gikxj|k,
Akl|i= gimAkl|m,
Akl|i= gimAkl|m,
Ak
· l|i= gimAk
· l|m .
(2.63)
For scalar functions the covariant and the contravariant derivatives identically
coincide with the partial one:
Φ,i = Φ|i= Φ|i .
(2.64)
In view of (2.58-2.60), (2.62) and (2.64) the gradients of the functions Φ =
Φ

θ1, θ2, . . . , θn
, x = x

θ1, θ2, . . . , θn
and A = A

θ1, θ2, . . . , θn
take the
form
gradΦ = Φ|i gi = Φ|i gi,
gradx = xj|i gj ⊗gi = xj|i gj ⊗gi = xj|i gj ⊗gi = xj|i gj ⊗gi,
gradA = Akl|i gk ⊗gl ⊗gi = Akl|i gk ⊗gl ⊗gi = Ak
· l|i gk ⊗gl ⊗gi
= Akl|i gk ⊗gl ⊗gi = Akl|i gk ⊗gl ⊗gi = Ak
· l|i gk ⊗gl ⊗gi.
(2.65)
2.5 Christoﬀel Symbols, Representation of the Covariant
Derivative
In the previous section we have introduced the notion of the covariant deriva-
tive but have not so far discussed how it can be taken. Now, we are going to
formulate a procedure constructing the diﬀerential operator of the covariant
derivative. In other words, we would like to express the covariant derivative in
terms of the vector or tensor components. To this end, the partial derivatives
of the tangent vectors (2.26) with respect to the coordinates are ﬁrst needed.
Since these derivatives again represent vectors in En, they can be expressed
in terms of the tangent vectors gi or dual vectors gi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) both
forming bases of En. Thus, one can write
gi,j = Γijkgk = Γk
ijgk,
i, j = 1, 2, . . ., n,
(2.66)
where the components Γijk and Γk
ij (i, j, k = 1, 2, . . . , n) are referred to as the
Christoﬀel symbols of the ﬁrst and second kind, respectively. In view of the

2.5 Christoﬀel Symbols, Representation of the Covariant Derivative
45
relation gk = gklgl (k = 1, 2, . . ., n) (1.21) these symbols are connected with
each other by
Γk
ij = gklΓijl,
i, j, k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(2.67)
Keeping the deﬁnition of tangent vectors (2.26) in mind we further obtain
gi,j = r,ij = r,ji = gj,i ,
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(2.68)
With the aid of (1.28) the Christoﬀel symbols can thus be expressed by
Γijk = Γjik = gi,j ·gk = gj,i ·gk,
(2.69)
Γk
ij = Γk
ji = gi,j ·gk = gj,i ·gk,
i, j, k = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(2.70)
For the dual basis gi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) one further gets by diﬀerentiating the
identities gi · gj = δi
j (1.15):
0 =

δi
j

,k =

gi · gj

,k = gi,k ·gj + gi · gj,k
= gi,k ·gj + gi ·

Γl
jkgl

= gi,k ·gj + Γi
jk,
i, j, k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Hence,
Γi
jk = Γi
kj = −gi,k ·gj = −gi,j ·gk,
i, j, k = 1, 2, . . . , n
(2.71)
and consequently
gi,k = −Γi
jkgj = −Γi
kjgj,
i, k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(2.72)
By means of the identity
gij,k = (gi · gj) ,k = gi,k ·gj + gi · gj,k ,
i, j, k = 1, 2, . . ., n
(2.73)
and in view of (2.67-2.69) we ﬁnally obtain
Γijk = 1
2 (gki,j +gkj,i −gij,k ) ,
(2.74)
Γk
ij = 1
2gkl (gli,j +glj,i −gij,l ) ,
i, j, k = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(2.75)
It is seen from (2.74) and (2.75) that all Christoﬀel symbols identically vanish
in the Cartesian coordinates deﬁned with respect to an orthonormal basis as
r = xiei.
(2.76)
Indeed, in this case
gij = ei · ej = δij,
i, j = 1, 2, . . ., n
(2.77)
and hence

46
2 Vector and Tensor Analysis in Euclidean Space
Γijk = Γk
ij = 0,
i, j, k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(2.78)
Example. Christoﬀel symbols for cylindrical coordinates in E3
(2.16). By virtue of relation (2.28)1 we realize that g11,3 = 2r, while all other
derivatives gik,j (i, j, k = 1, 2, 3) (2.73) are zero. Thus, eq. (2.74) delivers
Γ131 = Γ311 = r,
Γ113 = −r,
(2.79)
while all other Christoﬀel symbols of the ﬁrst kind Γijk (i, j, k = 1, 2, 3) are
likewise zero. With the aid of (2.67) and (2.28)2 we further obtain
Γ1
ij = g11Γij1 = r−2Γij1,
Γ2
ij = g22Γij2 = Γij2,
Γ3
ij = g33Γij3 = Γij3,
i, j = 1, 2, 3.
(2.80)
By virtue of (2.79) we can further write
Γ1
13 = Γ1
31 = 1
r ,
Γ3
11 = −r,
(2.81)
while all remaining Christoﬀel symbols of the second kind Γk
ij (i, j, k = 1, 2, 3)
(2.75) vanish.
Now, we are in a position to express the covariant derivative in terms of
the vector or tensor components by means of the Christoﬀel symbols. For the
vector-valued function x = x

θ1, θ2, . . . , θn
we can write using (2.66)
x,j =

xigi

,j = xi,j gi + xigi,j
= xi,j gi + xiΓk
ijgk =

xi,j +xkΓi
kj

gi,
(2.82)
or alternatively using (2.72)
x,j =

xigi
,j = xi,j gi + xigi,j
= xi,j gi −xiΓi
kjgk =

xi,j −xkΓk
ij

gi.
(2.83)
Comparing these results with (2.62) yields
xi|j= xi,j +xkΓi
kj,
xi|j= xi,j −xkΓk
ij,
i, j = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(2.84)
Similarly, we treat the tensor-valued function A = A

θ1, θ2, . . . , θn
:
A,k =

Aijgi ⊗gj

,k
= Aij,k gi ⊗gj + Aijgi,k ⊗gj + Aijgi ⊗gj,k
= Aij,k gi ⊗gj + Aij

⊗gj + Aijgi ⊗

Aij,k +AljΓi

gi ⊗gj.
(2.85)

47
Thus,
Aij|k= Aij,k +AljΓi
lk + AilΓj
lk,
i, j, k = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(2.86)
By analogy, we further obtain
Aij|k= Aij,k −AljΓl
ik −AilΓl
jk,
Ai
·j|k= Ai
·j,k +Al
·jΓi
lk −Ai
·lΓl
jk,
i, j, k = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(2.87)
Similar expressions for the covariant derivative can also be formulated for
tensors of higher orders.
From (2.78), (2.84), (2.86) and (2.87) it is seen that the covariant derivative
taken in Cartesian coordinates (2.76) coincides with the partial derivative:
xi|j= xi,j ,
xi|j= xi,j ,
Aij|k= Aij,k , Aij|k= Aij,k , Ai
·j|k= Ai
·j,k ,
i, j, k = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(2.88)
Formal application of the covariant derivative (2.84) and (2.86-2.87) to the
tangent vectors (2.26) and metric coeﬃcients (1.85)1,2 yields by virtue of
(2.66), (2.67), (2.72) and (2.74) the following identities referred to as Ricci’s
Theorem:
gi|j= gi,j −glΓl
ij = 0,
gi|j= gi,j +glΓi
lj = 0,
(2.89)
gij|k= gij,k −gljΓl
ik −gilΓl
jk = gij,k −Γikj −Γjki = 0,
(2.90)
gij|k= gij,k +gljΓi
lk + gilΓj
lk = gilgjm (−glm,k +Γmkl + Γlkm) = 0, (2.91)
where i, j, k = 1, 2, . . ., n. The latter two identities can alternatively be proved
by taking (1.25) into account and using the product rules of diﬀerentiation
for the covariant derivative which can be written as (Exercise 2.6)
Aij|k= ai|k bj + aibj|k
for
Aij = aibj,
(2.92)
Aij|k= ai|k bj + aibj|k
for
Aij = aibj,
(2.93)
Ai
j|k = ai|k bj + aibj|k
for
Ai
j = aibj,
i, j, k = 1, 2, . . ., n.

For the integration we consider a curvilinear parallelepiped with the edges
formed by the coordinate lines θ1, θ2, θ3 and θ1 +Δθ1, θ2 +Δθ2, θ3 +Δθ3 (Fig.

Example. The momentum balance in Cartesian and cylindrical
coordinates. Let us consider a material body or a part of it with a mass
m, volume V and outer surface A. According to the Euler law of motion the
vector sum of external volume forces fdV and surface tractions tdA results in
the vector sum of inertia forces ¨xdm, where x stands for the position vector
of a material element dm and the superposed dot denotes the material time
derivative. Hence,
'

¨xdm =

tdA +

(2.104)

(2.105)
Dividing this equation by V and considering the limit case V →0 we obtain
by virtue of (2.95)
ρ¨x = divσ + f,
(2.106)
where ρ denotes the density of the material. This vector equation is referred
to as the momentum balance.
Representing vector and tensor variables with respect to the tangent vec-
tors gi (i = 1, 2, 3) of an arbitrary curvilinear coordinate system as
¨x = ¨xigi,
σ = σijgi ⊗gj,
f = f igi
and expressing the divergence of the Cauchy stress tensor by (2.103) we obtain
the component form of the momentum balance (2.106) by
ρ¨xi = σij|j +f i,
i = 1, 2, 3.
(2.107)
With the aid of (2.86) the covariant derivative of the Cauchy stress tensor can
further be written by
σij|k= σij,k +σljΓi
lk + σilΓj
lk,
i, j, k = 1, 2, 3
(2.108)
and thus,
σij|j= σij,j +σljΓi
lj + σilΓj
lj,
i = 1, 2, 3.
(2.109)
By virtue of the expressions for the Christoﬀel symbols (2.81) and keeping in
mind the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensors σij = σji (i ̸= j = 1, 2, 3) we
thus obtain for cylindrical coordinates:
σ1j|j = σ11,ϕ +σ12,z +σ13,r +3σ31

σ2j|j = σ21,ϕ +σ22,z +σ23,r +σ32

σ3j|j = σ31,ϕ +σ32,z +σ33,r −rσ11 + σ33

(2.110)
The balance equations ﬁnally take the form
ρ¨x1 = σ11,ϕ +σ12,z +σ13,r +3σ31

ρ¨x2 = σ21,ϕ +σ22,z +σ23,r +σ32

2.6 Applications in Three-Dimensional Space: Divergence and Curl

In Cartesian coordinates, where gi = ei (i = 1, 2, 3), the covariant derivative
coincides with the partial one, so that
σij|j= σij,j = σij,j .
(2.112)
Thus, the balance equations reduce to
ρ¨x1 = σ11,1 +σ12,2 +σ13,3 +f1,
ρ¨x2 = σ21,1 +σ22,2 +σ23,3 +f2,
ρ¨x3 = σ31,1 +σ32,2 +σ33,3 +f3.

(2.116)
Treating the vector ﬁeld in the same manner as the tensor ﬁeld we can write
divt = t,i ·gi = ti|i
(2.117)
and in view of (2.65)2
divt = tr (gradt) .
(2.118)
The same procedure applied to the curl (2.115) leads to
curlt = gi × t,i .
(2.119)
By virtue of (2.62) and (1.42) we further obtain (see also Exercise 2.7)
curlt = ti|j gj × gi = ejik 1
gti|j gk.
(2.120)
With respect to Cartesian coordinates with gi = ei (i = 1, 2, 3) the divergence
(2.117) and curl (2.120) simplify to

divt = ti,i = t1,1 +t2,2 +t3,3 = t1,1 +t2,2 +t3,3 ,

= (t3,2 −t2,3 ) e1 + (t1,3 −t3,1 ) e2 + (t2,1 −t1,2 ) e3.
(2.122)
Now, we are going to discuss some combined operations with a gradient, diver-
gence, curl, tensor mapping and products of various types (see also Exercise
2.11).
1) Curl of a gradient:
curl gradΦ = 0.
(2.123)
2) Divergence of a curl:
div curlt = 0.
(2.124)
3) Divergence of a vector product:
div (u × v) = v · curlu −u · curlv.
(2.125)
4) Gradient of a divergence:
graddivt = curl curlt + div gradt,
(2.126)
graddivt = div (gradt)T .
(2.127)
The combined operator div gradt appearing in (2.126) is known as the
Laplacian and is also denoted by Δt.
5) Divergence of a (left) mapping
div (tA) = A : gradt + t · divA.
(2.128)
6) Divergence of a product of a scalar-valued function and a vector-valued
function
div (Φt) = t · gradΦ + Φdivt.
(2.129)
7) Divergence of a product of a scalar-valued function and a tensor-valued
function
div (ΦA) = AgradΦ + ΦdivA.
(2.130)
We prove, for example, identity (2.123). To this end, we apply (2.65)1, (2.72)
and (2.119). Thus, we write
curl gradΦ = gj ×

Φ|i gi
,j = Φ,ij gj × gi + Φ,i gj × gi,j
= Φ,ij gj × gi −Φ,i Γi
kjgj × gk = 0
(2.131)

taking into account that Φ,ij = Φ,ji, Γl
ij = Γl
ji and gi × gj = −gj × gi
(i ̸= j, i, j = 1, 2, 3).
Example. Balance of mechanical energy as an integral form of
the momentum balance. Using the above identities we are now able to
formulate the balance of mechanical energy on the basis of the momentum
balance (2.106). To this end, we multiply this vector relation scalarly by the
velocity vector v = ˙x
v · (ρ¨x) = v · divσ + v · f.
Using (2.128) we can further write
v · (ρ¨x) + σ : gradv = div (vσ) + v · f.

obtain the relation

expressing the balance of mechanical energy. Indeed, the ﬁrst and the second
integrals on the left hand side of (2.132) represent the time rate of the kinetic
energy and the stress power, respectively. The right hand side of (2.132) ex-
presses the power of external forces i.e. external tractions t on the boundary
of the body A and external volume forces f inside of it.
Example. Navier-Stokes equations for a linear-viscous ﬂuid in
Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates. A linear-viscous ﬂuid (also called
Newton ﬂuid or Navier-Poisson ﬂuid) is deﬁned by a constitutive equation
σ = −pI + 2ηD + λ (trD) I,
(2.133)
where
D = 1

gradv + (gradv)T

denotes the spatial strain rate tensor, p is the hydrostatic pressure while η
and λ represent material constants referred to as shear viscosity and second
viscosity coeﬃcient, respectively. Inserting (2.134) into (2.133) and taking
(2.118) into account delivers

gradv + (gradv)T
+ λ (divv) I.
(2.135)
Substituting this expression into the momentum balance (2.106) and using
(2.127) and (2.130) we obtain the relation
ρ ˙v = −gradp + ηdiv gradv + (η + λ) graddivv + f
(2.136)
referred to as the Navier-Stokes equation. By means of (2.126) it can be rewrit-
ten as
ρ ˙v = −gradp + (2η + λ) graddivv −ηcurl curlv + f.
(2.137)
For an incompressible ﬂuid characterized by the kinematic condition trD =
divv = 0, the latter two equations simplify to
ρ ˙v = −gradp + ηΔv + f,
(2.138)
ρ ˙v = −gradp −ηcurl curlv + f.
(2.139)
With the aid of the identity Δv = v,i|i (see Exercise 2.13) we thus can write
ρ ˙v = −gradp + ηv,i|i +f.
(2.140)
In Cartesian coordinates this relation is thus written out as
ρ˙vi = −p,i +η (vi,11 +vi,22 +vi,33 ) + fi,
i = 1, 2, 3.
(2.141)
For arbitrary curvilinear coordinates we use the following representation for
the vector Laplacian (see Exercise 2.15)
Δv = gij

ij vk,m +Γk

(2.142)
For the cylindrical coordinates it takes by virtue of (2.28) and (2.81) the
following form

Curves and Surfaces in Three-Dimensional
Euclidean Space
3.1 Curves in Three-Dimensional Euclidean Space
A curve in three-dimensional space is deﬁned by a vector function
r = r (t) ,
r ∈E3,
(3.1)
where the real variable t belongs to some interval: t1 ≤t ≤t2. Henceforth, we
assume that the function r (t) is suﬃciently diﬀerentiable and
dr
dt ̸= 0
(3.2)
over the whole deﬁnition domain. Specifying an arbitrary coordinate system
(2.15) as
θi = θi (r) ,
i = 1, 2, 3,
(3.3)
the curve (3.1) can alternatively be deﬁned by
θi = θi (t) ,
i = 1, 2, 3.
(3.4)
Example. Straight line. A straight line can be deﬁned by
r (t) = a + bt,
a, b ∈E3.
(3.5)
With respect to linear coordinates related to a basis H = {h1, h2, h3} it is
equivalent to
ri (t) = ai + bit,
i = 1, 2, 3,
(3.6)
where r = rihi, a = aihi and b = bihi.
Example. Circular helix. The circular helix (Fig. 3.1) is deﬁned by

Fig. 3.1. Circular helix
r (t) = R cos (t) e1 + R sin (t) e2 + cte3,
c ̸= 0,
(3.7)
where ei (i = 1, 2, 3) form an orthonormal basis in E3. For the deﬁnition of
the circular helix the cylindrical coordinates (2.16) appear to be very suitable.
Indeed, alternatively to (3.7) we can write
r = R,
ϕ = t,
z = ct.
(3.8)
In the previous chapter we deﬁned tangent vectors to the coordinate lines. By
analogy one can also deﬁne a vector tangent to the curve (3.1) as
gt = dr
dt .
(3.9)
It is advantageous to parametrize the curve (3.1) in terms of the so-called arc
length. To this end, we ﬁrst calculate the length of a curve segment between
the points corresponding to parameters t1 and t as
s (t) =
r(t)
'
r(t1)
√
dr · dr.
(3.10)

3.1 Curves in Three-Dimensional Euclidean Space
59
With the aid of (3.9) we can write dr = gtdt and consequently
s (t) =
t
'
t1
√gt · gtdt =
t
'
t1
∥gt∥dt =
t
'
t1

gtt (t)dt.
(3.11)
Using this equation and keeping in mind assumption (3.2) we have
ds
dt =

gtt (t) ̸= 0.
(3.12)
This implies that the function s = s (t) is invertible and
t (s) =
s
'
s(t1)
∥gt∥−1 ds =
s
'
s(t1)
ds

gtt (t)
.
(3.13)
Thus, the curve (3.1) can be redeﬁned in terms of the arc length s as
r = r (t (s)) =
⌢r (s) .
(3.14)
In analogy with (3.9) one deﬁnes the vector tangent to the curve
⌢r (s) (3.14)
as
a1 = d
⌢r
ds = dr
dt
dt
ds =
gt
∥gt∥
(3.15)
being a unit vector: ∥a1∥= 1. Diﬀerentiation of this vector with respect to s
further yields
a1,s = da1
ds = d2 ⌢r
ds2 .
(3.16)
It can be shown that the tangent vector a1 is orthogonal to a1,s provided
the latter one is not zero. Indeed, diﬀerentiating the identity a1 · a1 = 1 with
respect to s we have
a1 · a1,s = 0.
(3.17)
The length of the vector a1,s
κ (s) = ∥a1,s ∥
(3.18)
plays an important role in the theory of curves and is called curvature. The
inverse value
ρ (s) =
1
κ (s)
(3.19)

60
3 Curves and Surfaces in Three-Dimensional Euclidean Space
is referred to as the radius of curvature of the curve at the point
⌢r (s). Hence-
forth, we focus on curves with non-zero curvature. The case of zero curvature
corresponds to a straight line (see Exercise 3.1) and is trivial.
Next, we deﬁne the unit vector in the direction of a1,s
a2 =
a1,s
∥a1,s ∥= a1,s
κ (s)
(3.20)
called the principal normal vector to the curve. The orthogonal vectors a1
and a2 can further be completed to an orthonormal basis in E3 by the vector
a3 = a1 × a2
(3.21)
called the unit binormal vector. The triplet of vectors a1, a2 and a3 is referred
to as the moving trihedron of the curve.
In order to study the rotation of the trihedron along the curve we again
consider the arc length s as a coordinate. In this case, we can write similarly
to (2.66)
ai,s = Γk
isak,
i = 1, 2, 3,
(3.22)
where Γk
is = ai,s ·ak (i, k = 1, 2, 3). From (3.17), (3.20) and (3.21) we imme-
diately observe that Γ2
1s = κ and Γ1
1s = Γ3
1s = 0. Further, diﬀerentiating the
identities
a3 · a3 = 1,
a1 · a3 = 0
(3.23)
with respect to s yields
a3 · a3,s = 0,
a1,s ·a3 + a1 · a3,s = 0.
(3.24)
Taking into account (3.20) this results in the following identity
a1 · a3,s = −a1,s ·a3 = −κa2 · a3 = 0.
(3.25)
Relations (3.24) and (3.25) suggest that
a3,s = −τ (s) a2,
(3.26)
where the function
τ (s) = −a3,s ·a2
(3.27)
is called torsion of the curve at the point
⌢r(s). Thus, Γ2
3s = −τ and
Γ1
3s = Γ3
3s = 0. The sign of the torsion (3.27) has a geometric meaning and
remains unaﬀected by the change of the positive sense of the curve, i.e. by
the transformation s = −s′ (see Exercise 3.2). Accordingly, one distinguishes
right-handed curves with a positive torsion and left-handed curves with a neg-
ative torsion. In the case of zero torsion the curve is referred to as a plane
curve.

3.1 Curves in Three-Dimensional Euclidean Space
61
Finally, diﬀerentiating the identities
a2 · a1 = 0,
a2 · a2 = 1,
a2 · a3 = 0
with respect to s and using (3.20) and (3.27) we get
a2,s ·a1 = −a2 · a1,s = −κa2 · a2 = −κ,
(3.28)
a2 · a2,s = 0,
a2,s ·a3 = −a2 · a3,s = τ,
(3.29)
so that Γ1
2s = −κ, Γ2
2s = 0 and Γ3
2s = τ. Summarizing the above results we
can write

Fig. 3.2. Rotation of the moving trihedron
A useful illustration of the Frenet formulas can be gained with the aid of a
skew-symmetric tensor. To this end, we consider the rotation of the trihedron
from some initial position at s0 to the actual state at s. This rotation can be
described by an orthogonal tensor Q (s) as (Fig. 3.2)

62
3 Curves and Surfaces in Three-Dimensional Euclidean Space
ai (s) = Q (s) ai (s0) ,
i = 1, 2, 3.
(3.32)
Diﬀerentiating this relation with respect to s yields
ai,s (s) = Q,s (s) ai (s0) ,
i = 1, 2, 3.
(3.33)
Mapping both sides of (3.32) by QT (s) and inserting the result into (3.33)
we further obtain
ai,s (s) = Q,s (s) QT (s) ai (s) ,
i = 1, 2, 3.
(3.34)
Diﬀerentiating the identity (1.129) Q (s) QT (s) = I with respect to s we have
Q,s (s) QT (s) + Q (s) QT,s (s) = 0, which implies that the tensor W (s) =
Q,s (s) QT (s) is skew-symmetric. Hence, eq. (3.34) can be rewritten as (see
also [3])
ai,s (s) = W (s) ai (s) ,
W ∈Skew3,
i = 1, 2, 3,
(3.35)
where according to (3.31)
W (s) = τ (s) (a3 ⊗a2 −a2 ⊗a3) + κ (s) (a2 ⊗a1 −a1 ⊗a2) .
(3.36)
By virtue of (1.130) and (1.131) we further obtain
W = τ ˆa1 + κˆa3
(3.37)
and consequently
ai,s = d × ai = ˆdai,
i = 1, 2, 3,
(3.38)
where
d = τa1 + κa3
(3.39)
is referred to as the Darboux vector.
Example. Curvature, torsion, moving trihedron and Darboux
vector for a circular helix. Inserting (3.7) into (3.9) delivers
gt = dr
dt = −R sin (t) e1 + R cos (t) e2 + ce3,
(3.40)
so that
gtt = gt · gt = R2 + c2 = const.
(3.41)
Thus, using (3.13) we may set
t (s) =

R2 + c2 .

c < 0 and becomes a circle for c = 0. For the Darboux vector (3.39) we ﬁnally
obtain
d = τa1 + κa3 =

of two real variables t1 and t2 referred to as Gauss coordinates. With the aid
of the coordinate system (3.3) one can alternatively write

where ei (i = 1, 2, 3) again form an orthonormal basis in E3. With the aid of

Fig. 3.3. Coordinate lines on the surface, normal section and tangent vectors
one deﬁnes a curve on the surface (3.52). In particular, the curves t1 = const
and t2 = const are called t2 and t1 coordinate lines, respectively (Fig. 3.3).
The vector tangent to the curve (3.60) can be expressed by
gt = dr

represent tangent vectors to the coordinate lines. For the length of an in-
ﬁnitesimal element of the curve (3.60) we thus write

referred to as the ﬁrst fundamental form of the surface. The latter result can

where and henceforth within this chapter the summation convention is implied
for repeated Greek indices taking the values from 1 to 2. Similar to the metric

3 Curves and Surfaces in Three-Dimensional Euclidean Space
coeﬃcients (1.85)1,2 in n-dimensional Euclidean space gαβ (3.64) describe the
metric on a surface. Generally, the metric described by a diﬀerential quadratic
form like (3.66) is referred to as Riemannian metric.
The tangent vectors (3.62) can be completed to a basis in E3 by the unit
vector
g3 =
g1 × g2
∥g1 × g2∥
(3.67)
called principal normal vector to the surface.
In the following, we focus on a special class of surface curves called normal
sections. These are curves passing through a point of the surface r

t1, t2
and
obtained by intersection of this surface with a plane involving the principal
normal vector. Such a plane is referred to as the normal plane.
In order to study curvature properties of normal sections we ﬁrst express
the derivatives of the basis vectors gi (i = 1, 2, 3) with respect to the surface
coordinates. Using the formalism of Christoﬀel symbols we can write
gi,α = ∂gi
∂tα = Γiαkgk = Γk
iαgk,
i = 1, 2, 3,
(3.68)
where
Γiαk = gi,α ·gk,
Γk
iα = gi,α ·gk,
i = 1, 2, 3,
α = 1, 2.
(3.69)
Taking into account the identity g3 = g3 resulting from (3.67) we immediately
observe that
Γiα3 = Γ3
iα,
i = 1, 2, 3,
α = 1, 2.
(3.70)
Diﬀerentiating the relations
gα · g3 = 0,
g3 · g3 = 1
(3.71)
with respect to the Gauss coordinates we further obtain
gα,β ·g3 = −gα · g3,β ,
g3,α ·g3 = 0,
α, β = 1, 2
(3.72)
and consequently
Γ3
αβ = −Γ3βα,
Γ3
3α = 0,
α, β = 1, 2.
(3.73)
Using in (3.68) the abbreviation
bαβ = bβα = Γ3
αβ = −Γ3αβ = gα,β ·g3,
α, β = 1, 2,
(3.74)
we arrive at the relations
gα,β = Γρ
αβgρ + bαβg3,
α, β = 1, 2
(3.75)

3.2 Surfaces in Three-Dimensional Euclidean Space

called the Gauss formulas.
Similarly to a coordinate system one can notionally deﬁne the covariant
derivative also on the surface. To this end, relations (2.84), (2.86) and (2.87)
are speciﬁed to the two-dimensional space in a straight forward manner as
f α|β= f α,β +f ρΓα
ρβ,
fα|β= fα,β −fρΓρ

βγ,
α, β, γ = 1, 2.
(3.77)
Thereby, with the aid of (3.76)2 the Gauss formulas (3.75) can alternatively
be given by (cf. (2.89))
gα|β= bαβg3,
α, β = 1, 2.
(3.78)
Further, we can write
bβ
α = bαρgρβ = −Γ3αρgρβ = −Γβ
3α,
α, β = 1, 2.
(3.79)
Inserting the latter relation into (3.68) and considering (3.73)2, this yields the
identities
g3,α = g3|α= −bρ
αgρ,
α = 1, 2
(3.80)
referred to as the Weingarten formulas.
Now, we are in a position to express the curvature of a normal section. It
is called normal curvature and denoted in the following by κn. At ﬁrst, we
observe that the principal normals of the surface and of the normal section
coincide in the sense that a2 = ±g3. Using (3.13), (3.28), (3.61), (3.72)1 and
(3.74) and assuming for the moment that a2 = g3 we get
κn = −a2,s ·a1 = −g3,s · gt

By virtue of (3.63) and (3.66) this leads to the following result
κn = bαβdtαdtβ
gαβdtαdtβ ,
(3.81)
where the quadratic form
bαβdtαdtβ = −dr · dg3
(3.82)
is referred to as the second fundamental form of the surface. In the case
a2 = −g3 the sign of the expression for κn (3.81) must be changed. Instead of

68
3 Curves and Surfaces in Three-Dimensional Euclidean Space
that, we assume that the normal curvature can, in contrast to the curvature
of space curves (3.18), be negative. However, the sign of κn (3.81) has no
geometrical meaning. Indeed, it depends on the orientation of g3 with respect
to a2 which is immaterial. For example, g3 changes the sign in coordinate
transformations like ¯t1 = t2, ¯t2 = t1.
Of special interest is the dependence of the normal curvature κn on the
direction of the normal section. For example, for the normal sections passing
through the coordinate lines we have
κn|t2=const = b11
g11
,
κn|t1=const = b22
g22
.
(3.83)
In the following, we are going to ﬁnd the directions of the maximal and mini-
mal curvature. Necessary conditions for the extremum of the normal curvature
(3.81) are given by
∂κn
∂tα = 0,
α = 1, 2.
(3.84)
Rewriting (3.81) as
(bαβ −κngαβ) dtαdtβ = 0
(3.85)
and diﬀerentiating with respect to tα we obtain
(bαβ −κngαβ) dtβ = 0,
α = 1, 2.
(3.86)
Multiplying both sides of this equation system by gαρ and summing up over
α we have with the aid of (3.79)

(3.89)
The maximal and minimal curvatures κ1 and κ2 resulting from this quadratic
equation are called the principal curvatures. One can show that directions of
principal curvatures are mutually orthogonal (see Theorem 4.5, Sect. 4). These
directions are called principal directions of normal curvature or curvature
directions (see also [25]).
According to the Vieta theorem the product of principal curvatures can
be expressed by

(3.92)
For the arithmetic mean of the principal curvatures we further obtain
H = 1
2 (κ1 + κ2) = 1
2bα
α.
(3.93)
The values K (3.90) and H (3.93) do not depend on the direction of the
normal section and are called the Gaussian and mean curvatures, respectively.
In terms of K and H the solutions of the quadratic equation (3.89) can simply
be given by
κ1,2 = H ±

H2 −K.
(3.94)
One recognizes that the sign of the Gaussian curvature K (3.90) is deﬁned
by the sign of b (3.91). For positive b both κ1 and κ2 are positive or negative so
that κn has the same sign for all directions of the normal sections at r

t1, t2
.
In other words, the orientation of a2 with respect to g3 remains constant. Such
a point of the surface is called elliptic.
For b < 0, principal curvatures are of diﬀerent signs so that diﬀerent normal
sections are characterized by diﬀerent orientations of a2 with respect to g3.
There are two directions of the normal sections with zero curvature. Such
normal sections are referred to as asymptotic directions. The corresponding
point of the surface is called hyperbolic or saddle point.
In the intermediate case b = 0, κn does not change sign. There is only one
asymptotic direction which coincides with one of the principal directions (of
κ1 or κ2). The corresponding point of the surface is called parabolic point.
Example. Torus. A torus is a surface obtained by rotating a circle about
a coplanar axis (see Fig. 3.4). Additionally we assume that the rotation axis
lies outside of the circle. Accordingly, the torus can be deﬁned by
r

t1, t2
=

R0 + R cos t2
cos t1e1
+

R0 + R cos t2
sin t1e2 + R sin t2e3,
(3.95)
where R0 is the radius of the circle and R is the distance between its center
and the rotation axis. By means of (3.62) and (3.67) we obtain
g1 = −

R0 + R cos t2
sin t1e1 +

R0 + R cos t2
cos t1e2,

g2 = −R cos t1 sin t2e1 −R sin t1 sin t2e2 + R cos t2e3,
g3 = cos t1 cos t2e1 + sin t1 cos t2e2 + sin t2e3.
(3.96)
Thus, the coeﬃcients (3.64) of the ﬁrst fundamental form (3.65) are given by
g11 =

R0 + R cos t22 ,
g12 = 0,
g22 = R2.
(3.97)
In order to express coeﬃcients (3.74) of the second fundamental form (3.82)
we ﬁrst calculate derivatives of the tangent vectors (3.96)1,2
g1,1 = −

R0 + R cos t2
cos t1e1 −

R0 + R cos t2
sin t1e2,
g1,2 = g2,1 = R sin t1 sin t2e1 −R cos t1 sin t2e2,
g2,2 = −R cos t1 cos t2e1 −R sin t1 cos t2e2 −R sin t2e3.
(3.98)
Inserting these expressions as well as (3.96)3 into (3.74) we obtain
b11 = −

R0 + R cos t2
cos t2,
b12 = b21 = 0,
b22 = −R.
(3.99)
In view of (3.79) and (3.97) b2
1 = b1
2 = 0. Thus, the solution of the equation
system (3.88) delivers
κ1 = b1
1 = b11
g11
= −
cos t2
R0 + R cos t2 ,
κ2 = b2
2 = b22
g22
= −R−1.
(3.100)
Comparing this result with (3.83) we see that the coordinate lines of the torus
(3.95) coincide with the principal directions of the normal curvature. Hence,
by (3.90)

R (R0 + R cos t2).
(3.101)
Thus, points of the torus for which −π/2 < t2 < π/2 are elliptic while points
for which π/2 < t2 < 3π/2 are hyperbolic. Points of the coordinates lines
t2 = −π/2 and t2 = π/2 are parabolic.
3.3 Application to Shell Theory
Geometry of the shell continuum. Let us consider a surface in the three-
dimensional Euclidean space deﬁned by (3.52) as
r = r

t1, t2
,
r ∈E3
(3.102)
and bounded by a closed curve C (Fig. 3.5). The shell continuum can then be
described by a vector function
r∗= r∗
t1, t2, t3
= r

t1, t2
+ g3t3,
(3.103)
where the unit vector g3 is deﬁned by (3.62) and (3.67) while −h/2 ≤t3 ≤
h/2. The surface (3.102) is referred to as the middle surface of the shell.
The thickness of the shell h is assumed to be small in comparison to its other
dimensions as for example the minimal curvature radius of the middle surface.
Every ﬁxed value of the thickness coordinate t3 deﬁnes a surface r∗
t1, t2
whose geometrical variables are obtained according to (1.40), (3.62), (3.64),
(3.79), (3.80), (3.90), (3.93) and (3.103) as follows.

The force and couple vectors (3.109) are usually represented with respect
to the basis related to the middle surface as (see also [1])
f α = f αβgβ + qαg3,
mα = mαβg3 × gβ = g e3βρmαβgρ.
(3.116)
In shell theory, their components are denoted as follows.
f αβ - components of the stress resultant tensor,
qα
- components of the transverse shear stress vector,
mαβ - components of the moment tensor.
External force variables. One deﬁnes the load force vector and the load
moment vector related to a unit area of the middle surface, respectively by
p = pigi,
c = cρg3 × gρ.
(3.117)
The load moment vector c is thus assumed to be tangential to the middle
surface. The resulting force and couple can be expressed respectively by

Since the latter condition holds for all shell elements we infer that

(3.121)
which leads by virtue of (2.98) and (3.73)2 to
f α|α +p = 0,
(3.122)
where the covariant derivative is formally applied to the vectors f α according
to (3.76)1.
In a similar fashion we can treat the moment equilibrium. In this case, we
obtain instead of (3.121) the following condition
[g (mα + r × f α)] ,α +gr × p + gc = 0.
(3.123)
With the aid of (3.62) and keeping (3.122) in mind, it ﬁnally delivers

In order to rewrite the equilibrium conditions (3.122) and (3.124) in compo-
nent form we further utilize representations (3.116), (3.117) and apply the
product rule of diﬀerentiation for the covariant derivative (see, e.g., (2.92-

middle surface of the shell is a plane (3.55) for which
bαβ = bα

Eigenvalue Problem and Spectral
Decomposition of Second-Order Tensors
4.1 Complexiﬁcation
So far we have considered solely real vectors and real vector spaces. For the
purposes of this chapter an introduction of complex vectors is, however, nec-
essary. Indeed, in the following we will see that the existence of a solution of
an eigenvalue problem even for real second-order tensors can be guaranteed
only within a complex vector space. In order to deﬁne the complex vector
space let us consider ordered pairs ⟨x, y⟩of real vectors x and y ∈En. The
sum of two such pairs is deﬁned by [14]
⟨x1, y1⟩+ ⟨x2, y2⟩= ⟨x1 + x2, y1 + y2⟩.
(4.1)
Further, we deﬁne the product of a pair ⟨x, y⟩by a complex number α + iβ
by
(α + iβ) ⟨x, y⟩= ⟨αx −βy, βx + αy⟩,
(4.2)
where α, β ∈R and i = √−1. These formulas can easily be recovered assuming
that
⟨x, y⟩= x + iy.
(4.3)
The deﬁnitions (4.1) and (4.2) enriched by the zero pair ⟨0, 0⟩are suﬃcient to
ensure that the axioms (A.1-A.4) and (B.1-B.4) of Chap. 1 are valid. Thus, the
set of all pairs z = ⟨x, y⟩characterized by the above properties forms a vector
space referred to as complex vector space. Every basis G = {g1, g2, . . . , gn}
of the underlying Euclidean space En represents simultaneously a basis of the
corresponding complexiﬁed space. Indeed, for every complex vector within
this space
z = x + iy,
(4.4)
where x, y ∈En and consequently

80
4 Eigenvalue Problem and Spectral Decomposition of Second-Order Tensors
x = xigi,
y = yigi,
(4.5)
we can write
z =

xi + iyi
gi.
(4.6)
Thus, the dimension of the complexiﬁed space coincides with the dimension
of the original real vector space. Using this fact we will denote the complex
vector space based on En by Cn. Clearly, En represents a subset of Cn.
For every vector z ∈Cn given by (4.4) one deﬁnes a complex conjugate
counterpart by
z = x −iy.
(4.7)
Of special interest is the scalar product of two complex vectors, say z1 =
x1 + iy1 and z2 = x2 + iy2, which we deﬁne by (see also [4])
(x1 + iy1) · (x2 + iy2) = x1 · x2 −y1 · y2 + i (x1 · y2 + y1 · x2) .
(4.8)
This scalar product is commutative (C.1), distributive (C.2) and linear in
each factor (C.3). Thus, it diﬀers from the classical scalar product of complex
vectors given in terms of the complex conjugate (see, e.g., [14]). As a result,
the axiom (C.4) does not generally hold. For instance, one can easily imagine a
non-zero complex vector whose scalar product with itself is zero. For complex
vectors with the scalar product (4.8) the notions of length, orthogonality or
parallelity can hardly be interpreted geometrically.
However, for complex vectors the axiom (C.4) can be reformulated by
z · z ≥0,
z · z = 0
if and only if
z = 0.
(4.9)
Indeed, using (4.4), (4.7) and (4.8) we obtain z · z = x · x + y · y. Bearing in
mind that the vectors x and y belong to the Euclidean space this immediately
implies (4.9).
As we learned in Chap. 1, the Euclidean space En is characterized by
the existence of an orthonormal basis (1.8). This can now be postulated for
the complex vector space Cn as well, because Cn includes En by the very
deﬁnition. Also Theorem 1.6 remains valid since it has been proved without
making use of the property (C.4). Thus, we may state that for every basis in
Cn there exists a unique dual basis.
The last step of the complexiﬁcation is a generalization of a linear mapping
on complex vectors. This can be achieved by setting for every tensor A ∈Linn
A (x + iy) = Ax + i (Ay) .
(4.10)
4.2 Eigenvalue Problem, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Let A ∈Linn be a second-order tensor. The equation

4.2 Eigenvalue Problem, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
81
Aa = λa,
a ̸= 0
(4.11)
is referred to as the eigenvalue problem of the tensor A. The non-zero vector
a ∈Cn satisfying this equation is called an eigenvector of A; λ is called an
eigenvalue of A. It is clear that any product of an eigenvector with any (real
or complex) scalar is again an eigenvector.
The eigenvalue problem (4.11) and the corresponding eigenvector a can
be regarded as the right eigenvalue problem and the right eigenvector, respec-
tively. In contrast, one can deﬁne the left eigenvalue problem by
bA = λb,
b ̸= 0,
(4.12)
where b ∈Cn is the left eigenvector. In view of (1.110), every right eigenvector
of A represents the left eigenvector of AT and vice versa. In the following,
unless indicated otherwise, we will mean the right eigenvalue problem and the
right eigenvector.
Mapping (4.11) by A several times we obtain
Aka = λka,
k = 1, 2, . . .
(4.13)
This leads to the following (spectral mapping) theorem.
Theorem 4.1. Let λ be an eigenvalue of the tensor A and let g (A) =
(m
k=0 akAk be a polynomial of A. Then g (λ) = (m
k=0 akλk is the eigenvalue
of g (A).
Proof. Let a be an eigenvector of A associated with λ. Then, in view of (4.13)
g (A) a =
m
	
k=0
akAka =
m
	
k=0
akλka =

k=0

a = g (λ) a.
In order to ﬁnd the eigenvalues of the tensor A we consider the following
representations:
A = Ai
·jgi ⊗gj,
a = aigi,
b = bigi,
(4.14)
where G = {g1, g2, . . . , gn} and G′ =

g1, g2, . . . , gn
are two arbitrary mu-
tually dual bases in En and consequently also in Cn. Note that we prefer here
the mixed variant representation of the tensor A. Inserting (4.14) into (4.11)
and (4.12) further yields
Ai
·jajgi = λaigi,
Ai
·jbigj = λbjgj,
and therefore

gi = 0,

gj = 0.
(4.15)

4 Eigenvalue Problem and Spectral Decomposition of Second-Order Tensors
Since the vectors gi on the one side and gi (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) on the other side
are linearly independent the associated scalar coeﬃcients in (4.15) must be
zero. This results in the following two linear homogeneous equation systems

vector b, respectively. A non-trivial solution of these equation systems exists
if and only if
Ai
·j −λδi
j
 = 0,
(4.17)
where |•| denotes the determinant of a matrix. Eq. (4.17) is called the char-
acteristic equation of the tensor A. Writing out the determinant on the left
hand side of this equation one obtains a polynomial of degree n with respect
to the powers of λ
pA (λ) = λn −λn−1I(1)
A + . . . + (−1)k λn−kI(k)
A + . . . + (−1)n I(n)

(4.18)
referred to as the characteristic polynomial of the tensor A. Thereby, it can
easily be seen that
I(1)
A = Ai
·i = trA,
I(n)
A =
Ai
·j
 .
(4.19)
The characteristic equation (4.17) can brieﬂy be written as
pA (λi) = 0.
(4.20)
According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree n
has n complex roots which may be multiple. These roots are the eigenvalues
λi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) of the tensor A.
Factorizing the characteristic polynomial (4.18) yields
pA (λ) =
n
+
i=1
(λ −λi) .
(4.21)
Collecting multiple eigenvalues the polynomial (4.21) can further be rewritten
as
pA (λ) =
s
+
i=1
(λ −λi)ri ,
(4.22)
where s (1 ≤s ≤n) denotes the number of distinct eigenvalues, while ri is
referred to as an algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue λi (i = 1, 2, . . . , s). It
should formally be distinguished from the so-called geometric multiplicity ti,
which represents the number of linearly independent eigenvectors associated
with this eigenvalue.

ent in the case of simple shear. In simple shear, the deformation gradient

Writing out this determinant we obtain
(1 −λ)3 = 0,
which yields one triple eigenvalue

The associated (right) eigenvectors a = aiei can be obtained from the equa-
tion system (4.16)1 i.e.

Fi
·j −λδi

aj = 0,
i = 1, 2, 3.
In view of (4.23) it reduces to the only non-trivial equation
a2γ = 0.
Hence, all eigenvectors of F can be given by a = a1e1 + a3e3. They are linear
combinations of the only two linearly independent eigenvectors e1 and e3.
Accordingly, the geometric and algebraic multiplicities of the eigenvalue 1 are
t1 = 2 and r1 = 3, respectively.
4.3 Characteristic Polynomial
By the very deﬁnition of the eigenvalue problem (4.11) the eigenvalues are
independent of the choice of the basis. This is also the case for the coeﬃ-
cients I(i)
A (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) of the characteristic polynomial (4.18) because they
uniquely deﬁne the eigenvalues and vice versa. These coeﬃcients are called
principal invariants of A. Comparing (4.18) with (4.21) and applying the Vi-
eta theorem we obtain the following relations between the principal invariants
and eigenvalues:

A = λ1λ2 . . . λn.
(4.24)
The principal invariants can also be expressed in terms of the so-called princi-
pal traces trAk (k = 1, 2, . . ., n). Indeed, by use of (4.13), (4.19)1 and (4.24)1
we ﬁrst write
trAk = λk
1 + λk
2 + . . . + λk
n,
k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(4.25)
Then, we apply Newton’s formula (see e.g. [9]) relating coeﬃcients of a poly-
nomial to its roots represented by the sum of the powers in the form of the
right hand side of (4.25). Taking (4.25) into account, Newton’s formula can
thus be written as

4.4 Spectral Decomposition and Eigenprojections
The spectral decomposition is a powerful tool for the tensor analysis and
tensor algebra. It enables to gain a deeper insight into the properties of second-
order tensors and to represent various useful tensor operations in a relatively
simple form. In the spectral decomposition, eigenvectors represent one of the
most important ingredients.
Theorem 4.2. The eigenvectors of a second-order tensor corresponding to
pairwise distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent.
Proof. Suppose that these eigenvectors are linearly dependent. Among all pos-
sible nontrivial linear relations connecting them we can choose one involving
the minimal number, say r, of eigenvectors ai ̸= 0 (i = 1, 2, . . . , r). Obviously,
1 < r ≤n. Thus,

86
4 Eigenvalue Problem and Spectral Decomposition of Second-Order Tensors
r
	
i=1
αiai = 0,
(4.34)
where all αi (i = 1, 2, . . . , r) are non-zero. We can also write
Aai = λiai,
i = 1, 2, . . . , r,
(4.35)
where λi ̸= λj, (i ̸= j = 1, 2, . . ., r). Mapping both sides of (4.34) by A and
taking (4.35) into account we obtain
r
	
i=1
αiAai =
r
	
i=1
αiλiai = 0.
(4.36)
Multiplying (4.34) by λr and subtracting from (4.36) yield
0 =
r
	
i=1
αi (λi −λr) ai =
r−1
	
i=1
αi (λi −λr) ai.
In the latter linear combination none of the coeﬃcients is zero. Thus, we have
a linear relation involving only r −1 eigenvectors. This contradicts, however,
the earlier assumption that r is the smallest number of eigenvectors satisfying
such a relation.
Theorem 4.3. Let bi be a left and aj a right eigenvector associated with
distinct eigenvalues λi ̸= λj of a tensor A. Then,
bi · aj = 0.
(4.37)
Proof. With the aid of (1.73) and taking (4.11) into account we can write
biAaj = bi · (Aaj) = bi · (λjaj) = λjbi · aj.
On the other hand, in view of (4.12)
biAaj = (biA) · aj = (biλi) · aj = λibi · aj.
Subtracting one equation from another one we obtain
(λi −λj) bi · aj = 0.
Since λi ̸= λj this immediately implies (4.37).
Now, we proceed with the spectral decomposition of a second-order tensor
A. First, we consider the case of n simple eigenvalues. Solving the equa-
tion systems (4.16) one obtains for every simple eigenvalue λi the compo-
nents of the right eigenvector ai and the components of the left eigenvector
bi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n). n right eigenvectors on the one hand and n left eigen-
vectors on the other hand are linearly independent and form bases of Cn.

4.4 Spectral Decomposition and Eigenprojections
87
Obviously, bi · ai ̸= 0 (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) because otherwise it would contradict
(4.37) (see Exercise 1.8). Normalizing the eigenvectors we can thus write
bi · aj = δij,
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(4.38)
Accordingly, the bases ai and bi are dual to each other such that ai = bi
and bi = ai (i = 1, 2, . . ., n). Now, representing A with respect to the basis
ai ⊗bj (i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n) as A = Aijai ⊗bj we obtain with the aid of (1.83),
(4.11) and (4.38)
Aij = aiAbj = biAaj = bi · (Aaj) = bi · (λjaj) = λjδij,
where i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n. Thus,
A =
n
	
i=1
λiai ⊗bi.
(4.39)
Next, we consider second-order tensors with multiple eigenvalues. We assume,
however, that the algebraic multiplicity ri of every eigenvalue λi coincides with
its geometric multiplicity ti. In this case we again have n linearly independent
right eigenvectors forming a basis of Cn (Exercise 4.3). We will denote these
eigenvectors by a(k)
i
(i = 1, 2, . . . , s; k = 1, 2, . . . , ri) where s is the number of
pairwise distinct eigenvalues. Constructing the basis b(l)
j
dual to a(k)
i
such
that
a(k)
i
· b(l)
j
= δijδkl, i, j = 1, 2, . . ., s; k = 1, 2, . . . , ri; l = 1, 2, . . . , rj (4.40)
we can write similarly to (4.39)
A =
s
	
i=1
λi
ri
	
k=1
a(k)
i
⊗b(k)
i
.
(4.41)
The representations of the form (4.39) or (4.41) are called spectral decompo-
sition in diagonal form or, brieﬂy, spectral decomposition. Note that not every
second-order tensor A ∈Linn permits the spectral decomposition. The tensors
which can be represented by (4.39) or (4.41) are referred to as diagonalizable
tensors. For instance, we will show in the next sections that symmetric, skew-
symmetric and orthogonal tensors are always diagonalizable. If, however, the
algebraic multiplicity of at least one eigenvalue exceeds its geometric multi-
plicity, the spectral representation is not possible. Such eigenvalues (for which
ri > ti) are called defective eigenvalues. A tensor that has one or more defec-
tive eigenvalues is called defective tensor. In Sect. 4.2 we have seen, for ex-
ample, that the deformation gradient F represents in the case of simple shear
a defective tensor since its triple eigenvalue 1 is defective. Clearly, a simple
eigenvalue (ri = 1) cannot be defective. For this reason, a tensor whose all
eigenvalues are simple is diagonalizable.

88
4 Eigenvalue Problem and Spectral Decomposition of Second-Order Tensors
Now, we look again at the spectral decompositions (4.39) and (4.41). With
the aid of the abbreviation
Pi =
ri
	
k=1
a(k)
i
⊗b(k)
i
,
i = 1, 2, . . ., s
(4.42)
they can be given in a uniﬁed form by
A =
s
	
i=1
λiPi.
(4.43)
The generally complex tensors Pi (i = 1, 2, . . ., s) deﬁned by (4.42) are called
eigenprojections. It follows from (4.40) and (4.42) that (Exercise 4.4)
PiPj = δijPi,
i, j = 1, 2, . . ., s
(4.44)
and consequently
PiA = APi = λiPi,
i = 1, 2, . . . , s.
(4.45)
Bearing in mind that the eigenvectors a(k)
i
(i = 1, 2, . . . , s; k = 1, 2, . . ., ri)
form a basis of Cn and taking (4.40) into account we also obtain (Exercise
4.5)
s
	
i=1
Pi = I.
(4.46)
Due to these properties of eigenprojections (4.42) the spectral representation
(4.43) is very suitable for calculating tensor powers, polynomials and other
tensor functions deﬁned in terms of power series. Indeed, in view of (4.44)
powers of A can be expressed by
Ak =
s
	
i=1
λk
i Pi,
k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(4.47)
For a tensor polynomial it further yields
g (A) =
s
	
i=1
g (λi) Pi.
(4.48)
For example, the exponential tensor function (1.109) can thus be represented
by
exp (A) =
s
	
i=1
exp (λi) Pi.
(4.49)

4.4 Spectral Decomposition and Eigenprojections
89
With the aid of (4.44) and (4.46) the eigenprojections can be obtained without
solving the eigenvalue problem in the general form (4.11). To this end, we ﬁrst
consider s polynomial functions pi (λ) (i = 1, 2, . . ., s) satisfying the following
conditions
pi (λj) = δij,
i, j = 1, 2, . . ., s.
(4.50)
Thus, by use of (4.48) we obtain
pi (A) =
s
	
j=1
pi (λj) Pj =
s
	
j=1
δijPj = Pi,
i = 1, 2, . . . , s.
(4.51)
Using Lagrange’s interpolation formula (see, e.g., [5]) and assuming that s ̸= 1
one can represent the functions pi (λ) (4.50) by the following polynomials of
degree s −1:
pi (λ) =
s
+
j=1
j̸=i
λ −λj
λi −λj
,
i = 1, 2, . . . , s > 1.
(4.52)
Considering these expressions in (4.51) we obtain the so-called Sylvester for-
mula as
Pi =
s
+
j=1
j̸=i
A −λjI
λi −λj
,
i = 1, 2, . . . , s > 1.
(4.53)
Note that according to (4.46), P1 = I in the the case of s = 1. With this
result in hand the above representation can be generalized by
Pi = δ1sI +

4 Eigenvalue Problem and Spectral Decomposition of Second-Order Tensors
4.5 Spectral Decomposition of Symmetric Second-Order
Tensors
We begin with some useful theorems concerning eigenvalues and eigenvectors
of symmetric tensors.
Theorem 4.4. The eigenvalues of a symmetric second-order tensor M ∈
Symn are real, the eigenvectors belong to En.
Proof. Let λ be an eigenvalue of M and a a corresponding eigenvector such
that according to (4.11)
Ma = λa.
The complex conjugate counterpart of this equation is
M a = λ a.
Taking into account that M is real and symmetric such that M = M and
MT = M we obtain in view of (1.110)
a M = λ a.
Hence, one can write
0 = aMa −aMa = a · (Ma) −(aM) · a
= λ (a · a) −λ (a · a) =

λ −λ

(a · a) .
Bearing in mind that a ̸= 0 and taking (4.9) into account we conclude that
a · a > 0. Hence, λ = λ. The components of a with respect to a basis G =
{g1, g2, . . . , gn} in En are real since they represent a solution of the linear
equation system (4.16)1 with real coeﬃcients. Therefore, a ∈En.
Theorem 4.5. Eigenvectors of a symmetric second-order tensor correspond-
ing to distinct eigenvalues are mutually orthogonal.
Proof. According to Theorem 4.3 right and left eigenvectors associated with
distinct eigenvalues are mutually orthogonal. However, for a symmetric tensor
every right eigenvector represents the left eigenvector associated with the same
eigenvalue and vice versa. For this reason, right (left) eigenvectors associated
with distinct eigenvalues are mutually orthogonal.
Theorem 4.6. Let λi be an eigenvalue of a symmetric second order tensor
M. Then, the algebraic and geometric multiplicity of λi coincide.
Proof. Let ak ∈En (k = 1, 2, . . ., ti) be all linearly independent eigenvectors
associated with λi, while ti and ri denote its geometric and algebraic multi-
plicity, respectively. Every linear combination of ak is again an eigenvector
associated with λi. Indeed,

(4.57)
According to Theorem 1.4 the set of vectors ak (k = 1, 2, . . ., ti) can be
completed to a basis of En. With the aid of the Gram-Schmidt procedure
described in Chap. 1 (Sect. 1.4) this basis can be transformed to an or-
thonormal basis el (l = 1, 2, . . ., n). Since the vectors ej (j = 1, 2, . . ., ti) are
linear combinations of ak (k = 1, 2, . . ., ti) they likewise represent eigenvec-
tors of M associated with λi. Further, we represent the tensor M with
respect to the basis el ⊗em (l, m = 1, 2, . . . , n). In view of the identities
Mek = λiek (k = 1, 2, . . . , ti) and keeping in mind the symmetry of M we
can write:
M = λi
ti
	
k=1
ek ⊗ek +
n
	
l,m=ti+1
M′
lmel ⊗em.
(4.58)
Thus, the characteristic polynomial of M can be given as
pM (λ) =
M′
lm −λδlm
 (λi −λ)ti ,
(4.59)
which implies that ri ≥ti.
Now, we consider the vector space En−ti of all linear combinations of the
vectors el (l = ti + 1, . . . , n). The tensor
M′ =
n
	
l,m=ti+1
M′
lmel ⊗em
represents a linear mapping of this space into itself. The eigenvectors of M′
are linear combinations of el (l = ti + 1, . . . , n) and therefore are linearly in-
dependent of ek (k = 1, 2, . . ., ti). Consequently, λi is not an eigenvalue of
M′. Otherwise, the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue λi would be
linearly independent of ek (k = 1, 2, . . ., ti) which contradicts the previous as-
sumption. Thus, all the roots of the characteristic polynomial of this tensor
pM′ (λ) =
M′
lm −λδlm

diﬀer from λi. In view of (4.59) this implies that ri = ti .
As a result of this theorem, the spectral decomposition of a symmetric second-
order tensor can be given by

4.6 Spectral Decomposition of Orthogonal
and Skew-Symmetric Second-Order Tensors
We begin with the orthogonal tensors Q ∈Orthn deﬁned by the condition
(1.129). For every eigenvector a and the corresponding eigenvalue λ we can
write
Qa = λa,
Qa = λ a,
(4.63)
because Q is by deﬁnition a real tensor such that Q = Q. Mapping both sides
of these vector equations by QT and taking (1.110) into account we have
aQ = λ−1a,
aQ = λ
−1a.
(4.64)
Thus, every right eigenvector of an orthogonal tensor represents its left eigen-
vector associated with the inverse eigenvalue. Hence, if λ ̸= λ−1 or, in other
words, λ is neither +1 nor −1, Theorem 4.3 immediately implies the relations
a · a = 0,
a · a = 0,
λ ̸= λ−1
(4.65)
indicating that a and consequently a are complex (deﬁnitely not real) vectors.
Using the representation
a =
1
√
2 (p + iq) ,
p, q ∈En
(4.66)
and applying (4.8) one can write
∥p∥= ∥q∥= 1,
p · q = 0.
(4.67)
Now, we consider the product aQa. With the aid of (4.63)1 and (4.64)2 we
obtain
aQa = λ (a · a) = λ
−1 (a · a) .
(4.68)
Since, however, a · a = 1/2 (p · p + q · q) = 1 we infer that

4.6 Spectral Decomposition of Orthogonal and Skew-Symmetric Tensors
93
λλ = 1.
(4.69)
Thus, all eigenvalues of an orthogonal tensor have absolute value 1 so that we
can write
λ = eωi = cos ω + i sin ω.
(4.70)
By virtue of (4.69) one can further rewrite (4.64) as
aQ = λa,
aQ = λa.
(4.71)
Summarizing these results we conclude that every complex (deﬁnitely not real)
eigenvalue λ of an orthogonal tensor comes in pair with its complex conjugate
counterpart λ = λ−1. If a is a right eigenvector associated with λ, then a is
its left eigenvector. For λ, a is, vice versa, the left eigenvector and a the right
one.
Next, we show that the algebraic and geometric multiplicities of ev-
ery eigenvalue of an orthogonal tensor Q coincide. Let ˜ak (k = 1, 2, . . . , ti)
be all linearly independent right eigenvectors associated with an eigenvalue
λi. According to Theorem 1.4 these vectors can be completed to a basis
of Cn. With the aid of the Gram-Schmidt procedure (see Exercise 4.11)
a linear combination of this basis can be constructed in such a way that
ak · al = δkl (k, l = 1, 2, . . ., n). Since the vectors ak (k = 1, 2, . . . , ti) are
linear combinations of ˜ak (k = 1, 2, . . ., ti) they likewise represent eigenvec-
tors of Q associated with λi. Thus, representing Q with respect to the basis
ak ⊗al (k, l = 1, 2, . . ., n) we can write
Q = λi
ti
	
k=1
ak ⊗ak +
n
	
l,m=ti+1
Q′
lmal ⊗am.
Comparing this representation with (4.58) and using the same reasoning as
applied for the proof of Theorem 4.6 we infer that λi cannot be an eigenvalue of
Q′ = (n
l,m=ti+1 Q′
lmal ⊗am. This means that the algebraic multiplicity ri of
λi coincides with its geometric multiplicity ti. Thus, every orthogonal tensor
Q ∈Orthn is characterized by exactly n linearly independent eigenvectors
forming a basis of Cn. Using this fact the spectral decomposition of Q can be
given by
Q =

p = 1, 2, . . . , r−1. Using the representations (4.66) and (4.70) the spectral
decomposition (4.72) can alternatively be written as

(4.74)
Now, we turn our attention to skew-symmetric tensors W ∈Skewn as deﬁned
in (1.148). Instead of (4.64) and (4.68) we have in this case
aW = −λa,
a W = −λ a,
(4.75)
aWa = λ (a · a) = −λ (a · a)
(4.76)
and consequently
λ = −λ.
(4.77)
Thus, the eigenvalues of W are either zero or imaginary. The latter ones come
in pairs with the complex conjugate like in the case of orthogonal tensors.
Similarly to (4.72) and (4.74) we thus obtain
W =

Orthogonal tensors in three-dimensional space. In the three-dimen-
sional case Q ∈Orth3, at least one of the eigenvalues is real, since complex
eigenvalues of orthogonal tensors appear in pairs with the complex conjugate.
Hence, we can write
λ1 = ±1,
λ2 = eiω = cos ω + i sin ω,
λ3 = e−iω = cos ω −i sin ω. (4.79)

4.6 Spectral Decomposition of Orthogonal and Skew-Symmetric Tensors
95
In the case sin ω = 0 all three eigenvalues become real. The principal invariants
(4.30) take thus the form
IQ = λ1 + 2 cosω = ±1 + 2 cosω,
IIQ = 2λ1 cos ω + 1 = λ1IQ = ±IQ,
IIIQ = λ1 = ±1.
(4.80)
The spectral representation (4.72) takes the form
Q = ±a1 ⊗a1 + (cos ω + i sin ω) a ⊗a + (cos ω −i sin ω) a ⊗a,
(4.81)
where a1 ∈E3 and a ∈C3 is given by (4.66) and (4.67). Taking into account
that by (4.73)
a1 · a = a1 · p = a1 · q = 0
(4.82)
we can set
a1 = q × p.
(4.83)
Substituting (4.66) into (4.81) we also obtain
Q = ±a1 ⊗a1 + cos ω (p ⊗p + q ⊗q) + sin ω (p ⊗q −q ⊗p) .
(4.84)
By means of the vector identity (1.130) and considering (1.65) and (4.83) it
ﬁnally leads to
Q = cos ωI + sin ω ˆa1 + (±1 −cos ω) a1 ⊗a1.
(4.85)
Comparing this representation with (1.71) we observe that any orthogonal
tensor Q ∈Orth3 describes a rotation in three-dimensional space if IIIQ =
λ1 = 1. The eigenvector a1 corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 speciﬁes the
rotation axis. In this case, Q is referred to as a proper orthogonal tensor.
Skew-symmetric tensors in three-dimensional space. For a skew-
symmetric tensor W ∈Skew3 we can write in view of (4.77)
λ1 = 0,
λ2 = ωi,
λ3 = −ωi.
(4.86)
Similarly to (4.80) we further obtain (see Exercise 4.13)
IW = 0,
IIW = 1
2 ∥W∥2 = ω2,
IIIW = 0.
(4.87)
The spectral representation (4.78) takes the form
W = ωi (a ⊗a −a ⊗a) = ω (p ⊗q −q ⊗p) ,
(4.88)
where a, p and q are again related by (4.66) and (4.67). With the aid of the
abbreviation

96
4 Eigenvalue Problem and Spectral Decomposition of Second-Order Tensors
w = ωa1 = ωq × p
(4.89)
and bearing (1.130) in mind we ﬁnally arrive at the representation (1.64)
W = ˆw.
(4.90)
Thus, every skew-symmetric tensor in three-dimensional space describes a
cross product by its eigenvector w (4.89) corresponding to the zero eigenvalue.
The vector w is called in this case the axial vector of the skew-symmetric
tensor W.

For x = 0 it is trivial, so we suppose that x ̸= 0. Consider the vectors

(4.94)
Note that 1 ≤k ≤n. If k ̸= n we can complete the vectors yi (i = 1, 2, . . . , k)
to a basis yi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) of En. Let A = Ai
·jyi ⊗yj, where the vectors yi
form the basis dual to yi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n). By virtue of (4.93) and (4.94) we
can write

Fourth-Order Tensors
5.1 Fourth-Order Tensors as a Linear Mapping
Fourth-order tensors play an important role in continuum mechanics where
they appear as elasticity and compliance tensors. In this section we deﬁne
fourth-order tensors and learn some basic operations with them. To this end,
we consider a set Linn of all linear mappings of one second-order tensor into
another one within Linn. Such mappings are denoted by a colon as
Y = A : X,
A ∈Linn, Y ∈Linn, ∀X ∈Linn.
(5.1)
The elements of Linn are called fourth-order tensors.
Example. Elasticity and compliance tensors. A constitutive law of a
linearly elastic material establishes a linear relationship between the Cauchy
stress tensor σ and Cauchy strain tensor ϵ. Since these tensors are of the
second-order a linear relation between them can be expressed by fourth-order
tensors like
σ = C : ϵ
or
ϵ = H : σ.
(5.2)
The fourth-order tensors C and H describe properties of the elastic material
and are called the elasticity and compliance tensor, respectively.
Linearity of the mapping (5.1) implies that
A : (X + Y) = A : X + A : Y,
(5.3)
A : (αX) = α (A : X) ,
∀X, Y ∈Linn, ∀α ∈R, A ∈Linn.
(5.4)
Similarly to second-order tensors one deﬁnes the product of a fourth-order
tensor with a scalar
(αA) : X = α (A : X) = A : (αX)
(5.5)

100
5 Fourth-Order Tensors
and the sum of two fourth-order tensors by
(A + B) : X = A : X + B : X,
∀X ∈Linn.
(5.6)
Further, we deﬁne the zero-tensor O of the fourth-order by
O : X = 0,
∀X ∈Linn.
(5.7)
Thus, summarizing the properties of fourth-order tensors one can write simi-
larly to second-order tensors
A + B = B + A,
(addition is commutative),
(5.8)
A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C,
(addition is associative),
(5.9)
O + A = A,
(5.10)
A + (−A) = O,
(5.11)
α (βA) = (αβ) A,
(multiplication by scalars is associative),
(5.12)
1A = A,
(5.13)
α (A + B) = αA + αB,
(multiplication by scalars is distributive
with respect to tensor addition),
(5.14)
(α + β) A = αA + βA,
(multiplication by scalars is distributive
with respect to scalar addition),
∀A, B, C ∈Linn, ∀α, β ∈R.
(5.15)
Thus, the set of fourth-order tensors Linn forms a vector space.
On the basis of the “right” mapping (5.1) and the scalar product of two
second-order tensors (1.136) we can also deﬁne the “left” mapping by
(Y : A) : X = Y : (A : X) ,
∀X, Y ∈Linn.
(5.16)
5.2 Tensor Products, Representation of Fourth-Order
Tensors with Respect to a Basis
For the construction of fourth-order tensors from second-order ones we intro-
duce two tensor products as follows
A⊗B : X = AXB,
A⊙B : X = A (B : X) ,
∀A, B, X ∈Linn. (5.17)
Note, that the tensor product “⊗” (5.17)1 applied to second-order tensors
diﬀers from the tensor product of vectors (1.75). One can easily show that the
mappings described by (5.17) are linear and therefore represent fourth-order
tensors. Indeed, we have, for example, for the tensor product “⊗” (5.17)1

5.2 Tensor Products, Representation of Fourth-Order Tensors
101
A ⊗B : (X + Y) = A (X + Y) B
= AXB + AYB = A ⊗B : X + A ⊗B : Y,
(5.18)
A ⊗B : (αX) = A (αX) B = α (AXB)
= α (A ⊗B : X) ,
∀X, Y ∈Linn, ∀α ∈R.
(5.19)
With deﬁnitions (5.17) in hand one can easily prove the following identities
A ⊗(B + C) = A ⊗B + A ⊗C,
(B + C) ⊗A = B ⊗A + C ⊗A, (5.20)
A ⊙(B + C) = A ⊙B + A ⊙C,
(B + C) ⊙A = B ⊙A + C ⊙A. (5.21)
For the left mapping (5.16) the tensor products (5.17) yield
Y : A ⊗B = ATYBT,
Y : A ⊙B = (Y : A) B.
(5.22)
As fourth-order tensors represent vectors they can be given with respect to a
basis in Linn.
Theorem 5.1. Let F = {F1, F2, . . . , Fn2} and G = {G1, G2, . . . , Gn2} be two
arbitrary (not necessarily distinct) bases of Linn. Then, fourth-order tensors
Fi ⊙Gj

i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n2
form a basis of Linn. The dimension of Linn is
thus n4.
Proof. See the proof of Theorem 1.6.
A basis in Linn can be represented in another way as by the tensors
Fi ⊙Gj

i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n2
. To this end, we prove the following identity
(a ⊗d) ⊙(b ⊗c) = a ⊗b ⊗c ⊗d,
(5.23)
where we set
(a ⊗b) ⊗(c ⊗d) = a ⊗b ⊗c ⊗d.
(5.24)
Indeed, let X ∈Linn be an arbitrary second-order tensor. Then, in view of
(1.135) and (5.17)2
(a ⊗d) ⊙(b ⊗c) : X = (bXc) (a ⊗d) .
(5.25)
For the right hand side of (5.23) we obtain the same result using (5.17)1 and
(5.24)
a ⊗b ⊗c ⊗d : X = (a ⊗b) ⊗(c ⊗d) : X = (bXc) (a ⊗d) .
(5.26)
For the left mapping (5.16) it thus holds
Y : a ⊗b ⊗c ⊗d = (aYd) (b ⊗c) .
(5.27)
Now, we are in a position to prove the following theorem.

102
5 Fourth-Order Tensors
Theorem 5.2. Let E = {e1, e2, . . . , en}, F
= {f 1, f 2, . . . , f n}, G =
{g1, g2, . . . , gn} and ﬁnally H = {h1, h2, . . . , hn} be four arbitrary (not nec-
essarily distinct) bases of En. Then, fourth-order tensors ei ⊗f j ⊗gk ⊗hl
(i, j, k, l = 1, 2, . . ., n) represent a basis of Linn.
Proof. In view of (5.23)
ei ⊗f j ⊗gk ⊗hl = (ei ⊗hl) ⊙(f j ⊗gk) .
According to Theorem 1.6 the second-order tensors ei ⊗hl (i, l = 1, 2, . . . , n)
on the one hand and f j⊗gk (j, k = 1, 2, . . ., n) on the other hand form bases of
Linn. According to Theorem 5.1 the fourth-order tensors (ei ⊗hl)⊙(f j ⊗gk)
and consequently ei⊗f j ⊗gk⊗hl (i, j, k, l = 1, 2, . . ., n) represent thus a basis
of Linn.
As a result of this Theorem any fourth-order tensor can be represented by
A = Aijklgi ⊗gj ⊗gk ⊗gl = Aijklgi ⊗gj ⊗gk ⊗gl
= Aij
· ·klgi ⊗gj ⊗gk ⊗gl = . . .
(5.28)
The components of A appearing in (5.28) can be expressed by
Aijkl = gi ⊗gl : A : gj ⊗gk,
Aijkl = gi ⊗gl : A : gj ⊗gk,
Aij
· ·kl = gi ⊗gl : A : gj ⊗gk,
i, j, k, l = 1, 2, . . ., n.
(5.29)
By virtue of (1.104), (5.17)1 and (5.22)1 the right and left mappings with a
second-order tensor (5.1) and (5.16) can thus be represented by
A : X =

Aijklgi ⊗gj ⊗gk ⊗gl

: (Xqpgq ⊗gp) = AijklXjkgi ⊗gl,
X : A = (Xqpgq ⊗gp) :

Aijklgi ⊗gj ⊗gk ⊗gl

= AijklXilgj ⊗gk.
(5.30)
We observe that the basis vectors of the second-order tensor are scalarly mul-
tiplied either by the “inner” (right mapping) or “outer” (left mapping) basis
vectors of the fourth-order tensor.
5.3 Special Operations with Fourth-Order Tensors
Similarly to second-order tensors one deﬁnes also for fourth-order tensors some
speciﬁc operations which are not generally applicable to conventional vectors
in the Euclidean space.
Composition. In analogy with second-order tensors we deﬁne the com-
position of two fourth-order tensors A and B denoted by A : B as

5.3 Special Operations with Fourth-Order Tensors
103
(A : B) : X = A : (B : X) ,
∀X ∈Linn.
(5.31)
For the left mapping (5.16) one can thus write
Y : (A : B) = (Y : A) : B,
∀Y ∈Linn.
(5.32)
For the tensor products (5.17) the composition (5.31) further yields
(A ⊗B) : (C ⊗D) = (AC) ⊗(DB) ,
(5.33)
(A ⊗B) : (C ⊙D) = (ACB) ⊙D,
(5.34)
(A ⊙B) : (C ⊗D) = A ⊙

CTBDT
,
(5.35)
(A ⊙B) : (C ⊙D) = (B : C) A ⊙D,
A, B, C, D ∈Linn.
(5.36)
For example, the identity (5.33) can be proved within the following steps
(A ⊗B) : (C ⊗D) : X = (A ⊗B) : (CXD)
= ACXDB = (AC) ⊗(DB) : X,
∀X ∈Linn,
where we again take into account the deﬁnition of the tensor product (5.17).
For the component representation (5.28) we further obtain
A : B =

Aijklgi ⊗gj ⊗gk ⊗gl

:

Bpqrtgp ⊗gq ⊗gr ⊗gt
= AijklBjqrkgi ⊗gq ⊗gr ⊗gl.
(5.37)
Note that the “inner” basis vectors of the left tensor A are scalarly multiplied
with the “outer” basis vectors of the right tensor B.
The composition of fourth-order tensors also gives rise to the deﬁnition of
powers as
Ak = A : A : . . . : A



k times
,
k = 1, 2, . . . ,
A0 = I,
(5.38)
where I stands for the fourth-order identity tensor to be deﬁned in the next
section. By means of (5.33) and (5.36) powers of tensor products (5.17) take
the following form
(A ⊗B)k = Ak⊗Bk, (A ⊙B)k = (A : B)k−1 A⊙B, k = 1, 2, . . . (5.39)
Simple composition with second-order tensors. Let D be a fourth-
order tensor and A, B two second-order tensors. One deﬁnes a fourth-order
tensor ADB by
(ADB) : X = A (D : X) B,
∀X ∈Linn.
(5.40)
Thus, we can also write
ADB = (A ⊗B) : D.
(5.41)

104
5 Fourth-Order Tensors
This operation is very useful for the formulation of tensor diﬀerentiation rules
to be discussed in the next chapter.
For the tensor products (5.17) we further obtain
A (B ⊗C) D = (AB) ⊗(CD) = (A ⊗D) : (B ⊗C) ,
(5.42)
A (B ⊙C) D = (ABD) ⊙C = (A ⊗D) : (B ⊙C) .
(5.43)
With respect to a basis the simple composition can be given by
ADB = (Apqgp ⊗gq)

Dijklgi ⊗gj ⊗gk ⊗gl

(Brsgr ⊗gs)
= ApiDijklBlsgp ⊗gj ⊗gk ⊗gs.
(5.44)
It is seen that expressed in component form the simple composition of second-
order tensors with a fourth-order tensor represents the so-called simple con-
traction of the classical tensor algebra (see, e.g., [41]).
Transposition. In contrast to second-order tensors allowing for the
unique transposition operation one can deﬁne for fourth-order tensors various
transpositions. We conﬁne our attention here to the following two operations
(•)T and (•)t deﬁned by
AT : X = X : A,
At : X = A : XT,
∀X ∈Linn.
(5.45)
Thus we can also write
Y : At = (Y : A)T .
(5.46)
Indeed, a scalar product with an arbitrary second order tensor X yields in
view of (1.140) and (5.16)

Y : At
: X = Y :

At : X

= Y :

A : XT
= (Y : A) : XT = (Y : A)T : X,
∀X ∈Linn.
Of special importance is also the following symmetrization operation resulting
from the transposition (•)t:
Fs = 1
2

F + Ft
.
(5.47)
In view of (1.146)1, (5.45)2 and (5.46) we thus write
Fs : X = F : symX,
Y : Fs = sym (Y : F) .
(5.48)
Applying the transposition operations to the tensor products (5.17) we have
(A ⊗B)T = AT ⊗BT,
(A ⊙B)T = B ⊙A,
(5.49)
(A ⊙B)t = A ⊙BT,
A, B ∈Linn.
(5.50)

5.4 Super-Symmetric Fourth-Order Tensors
105
With the aid of (5.26) and (5.27) we further obtain
(a ⊗b ⊗c ⊗d)T = b ⊗a ⊗d ⊗c,
(5.51)
(a ⊗b ⊗c ⊗d)t = a ⊗c ⊗b ⊗d.
(5.52)
It can also easily be proved that
ATT = A,
Att = A,
∀A ∈Linn.
(5.53)
Note, however, that the transposition operations (5.45) are not commutative
with each other so that generally DTt ̸= DtT.
Applied to the composition of fourth-order tensors these transposition op-
erations yield (Exercise 5.6):
(A : B)T = BT : AT,
(A : B)t = A : Bt.
(5.54)
For the tensor products (5.17) we also obtain the following relations (see
Exercise 5.7)
(A ⊗B)t : (C ⊗D) =

ADT
⊗

CTB
t
,
(5.55)
(A ⊗B)t : (C ⊙D) =

⊙D.
(5.56)
Scalar product. Similarly to second-order tensors the scalar product of
fourth-order tensors can be deﬁned in terms of the basis vectors or tensors.
To this end, let us consider two fourth-order tensors A⊙B and C⊙D, where
A, B, C, D ∈Linn. Then, we set
(A ⊙B) :: (C ⊙D) = (A : C) (B : D) .
(5.57)
As a result of this deﬁnition we also obtain in view of (1.134) and (5.23)
(a ⊗b ⊗c ⊗d) :: (e ⊗f ⊗g ⊗h) = (a · e) (b · f) (c · g) (d · h) .
(5.58)
For the component representation of fourth-order tensors it ﬁnally yields
A :: B =

Aijklgi ⊗gj ⊗gk ⊗gl

::

Bpqrtgp ⊗gq ⊗gr ⊗gt
= AijklBijkl.
(5.59)
Using the latter relation one can easily prove that the properties of the scalar
product (D.1-D.4) hold for fourth-order tensors as well.
5.4 Super-Symmetric Fourth-Order Tensors
On the basis of the transposition operations one deﬁnes symmetric and super-
symmetric fourth-order tensors. Accordingly, a fourth-order tensor C is said
to be symmetric if (major symmetry)

106
5 Fourth-Order Tensors
CT = C
(5.60)
and super-symmetric if additionally (minor symmetry)
Ct = C.
(5.61)
In this section we focus on the properties of super-symmetric fourth-order ten-
sors. They constitute a subspace of Linn denoted in the following by Ssymn.
First, we prove that every super-symmetric fourth-order tensor maps an ar-
bitrary (not necessarily symmetric) second-order tensor into a symmetric one
so that
(C : X)T = C : X,
∀C ∈Ssymn,
∀X ∈Linn.
(5.62)
Indeed, in view of (5.45), (5.46), (5.60) and (5.61) we have
(C : X)T =

X : CTT
= (X : C)T = X : Ct = X : C = X : CT = C : X.
Next, we deal with representations of super-symmetric fourth-order tensors
and study the properties of their components. Let F = {F1, F2, . . . , Fn2} be
an arbitrary basis of Linn and F′ =
1
F1, F2, . . . , Fn22
the corresponding
dual basis such that
Fp : Fq = δq
p,
p, q = 1, 2, . . ., n2.
(5.63)
According to Theorem 5.1 we ﬁrst write
C = CpqFp ⊙Fq.
(5.64)
Taking (5.60) into account and in view of (5.49)2 we infer that
Cpq = Cqp,
p ̸= q; p, q = 1, 2, . . . , n2.
(5.65)
Mapping (5.64) with the dual tensors Fr further yields
C : Fr = (CpqFp ⊙Fq) : Fr = CprFp,
r = 1, 2, . . ., n2.
(5.66)
Let now Fp = Mp (p = 1, 2, . . ., m) and Fq = Wq−m

q = m + 1, . . . , n2
be
bases of Symn and Skewn (Sect. 1.9), respectively, where m = 1
2n (n + 1). In
view of (5.45)2, (5.61), (5.62) and (5.66) we conclude that
Cpr = Crp = 0,
p = 1, 2, . . ., n2; r = m + 1, . . . , n2
(5.67)
and consequently
C =
m
	
p,q=1
CpqMp ⊙Mq,
m = 1
2n (n + 1) .
(5.68)

5.5 Special Fourth-Order Tensors
107
Keeping (5.65) in mind we can also write by analogy with (1.149)
C =
m
	
p=1
CppMp ⊙Mp +
m
	
p,q=1
p>q
Cpq (Mp ⊙Mq + Mq ⊙Mp) .
(5.69)
Therefore, every super-symmetric fourth-order tensor can be represented
with respect to the basis 1
2 (Mp ⊙Mq + Mq ⊙Mp), where Mq ∈Symn and
p ≥q = 1, 2, . . . , 1
2n (n + 1). Thus, we infer that the dimension of Ssymn is
1
2m (m + 1) = 1
8n2 (n + 1)2 + 1
4n (n + 1). We also observe that Ssymn can be
considered as the set of all linear mappings within Symn.
Applying Theorem 5.2 we can also represent a super-symmetric tensor by
C = Cijklgi⊗gj ⊗gk ⊗gl. In this case, (5.51) and (5.52) require that (Exercise
5.8)
Cijkl = Cjilk = Cikjl = Cljki = Cklij.
(5.70)
Thus, we can also write
C = Cijkl (gi ⊗gl) ⊙(gj ⊗gk)
= 1
4Cijkl (gi ⊗gl + gl ⊗gi) ⊙(gj ⊗gk + gk ⊗gj)
= 1
4Cijkl (gj ⊗gk + gk ⊗gj) ⊙(gi ⊗gl + gl ⊗gi) .
(5.71)
Finally, we brieﬂy consider the eigenvalue problem for super-symmetric fourth-
order tensors. It is deﬁned as
C : M = ΛM,
C ∈Ssymn,
(5.72)
where Λ and M ∈Symn denote the eigenvalue and the corresponding eigen-
tensor, respectively. The spectral decomposition of C can be given similarly
to symmetric second-order tensors (4.60) by
C =
m
	
p=1
ΛpMp ⊙Mp,
(5.73)
where again m = 1
2n (n + 1) and
Mp : Mq = δpq,
p, q = 1, 2, . . ., m.
(5.74)
5.5 Special Fourth-Order Tensors
Identity tensor. The fourth-order identity tensor I is deﬁned by
I : X = X,
∀X ∈Linn.
(5.75)

108
5 Fourth-Order Tensors
It is seen that I is a symmetric (but not super-symmetric) fourth-order tensor
such that IT = I. Indeed,
X : I = X,
∀X ∈Linn.
(5.76)
With the aid of (1.86), (5.17)1 or alternatively by using (5.29) the fourth-order
identity tensor can be represented by
I = I ⊗I = gi ⊗gi ⊗gj ⊗gj.
(5.77)
For the composition with other fourth-order tensors we can also write
I : A = A : I = A,
∀A ∈Linn.
(5.78)
Transposition tensor. The transposition of second-order tensors repre-
sents a linear mapping and can therefore be expressed in terms of a fourth-
order tensor. This tensor denoted by T is referred to as the transposition
tensor. Thus,
T : X = XT,
∀X ∈Linn.
(5.79)
One can easily show that (Exercise 5.9)
Y : T = YT,
∀Y ∈Linn.
(5.80)
Hence, the transposition tensor is symmetric such that T = TT. By virtue of
(5.45)2 and (5.75), T can further be expressed in terms of the identity tensor
by
T = It.
(5.81)
Indeed,
It : X = I : XT = XT = T : X,
∀X ∈Linn.
Considering (5.52) and (5.77) in (5.81) we thus obtain
T = (I ⊗I)t = gi ⊗gj ⊗gi ⊗gj.
(5.82)
The transposition tensor can further be characterized by the following iden-
tities (see Exercise 5.10)
A : T = At,
T : A = ATtT,
T : T = I,
∀A ∈Linn.
(5.83)
Super-symmetric identity tensor. The identity tensor (5.77) is sym-
metric but not super-symmetric. For this reason, it is useful to deﬁne a special
identity tensor within Ssymn. This super-symmetric tensor maps every sym-
metric second-order tensor into itself like the identity tensor (5.77). It can be
expressed by

5.5 Special Fourth-Order Tensors
109
Is = 1
2 (I + T) = (I ⊗I)s .
(5.84)
However, in contrast to the identity tensor I (5.77), the super-symmetric iden-
tity tensor Is (5.84) maps any arbitrary (not necessarily symmetric) second-
order tensor into its symmetric part so that in view of (5.48)
Is : X = X : Is = symX,
∀X ∈Linn.
(5.85)
Spherical, deviatoric and trace projection tensors. The spherical
and deviatoric part of a second-order tensor are deﬁned as a linear mapping
(1.153) and can thus be expressed by
sphA = Psph : A,
devA = Pdev : A,
(5.86)
where the fourth-order tensors Psph and Pdev are called the spherical and
deviatoric projection tensors, respectively. In view of (1.153) they are given
by
Psph = 1
nI ⊙I,
Pdev = I −1
nI ⊙I,
(5.87)
where I ⊙I represents the so-called trace projection tensor. Indeed,
I ⊙I : X = ItrX,
∀X ∈Linn.
(5.88)
According to (5.49)2 and (5.50), the spherical and trace projection tensors are
super-symmetric. The spherical and deviatoric projection tensors are further-
more characterized by the properties:
Pdev : Pdev = Pdev,
Psph : Psph = Psph,
Pdev : Psph = Psph : Pdev = O.
(5.89)
Example. Elasticity tensor for the generalized Hooke’s law. The
generalized Hooke’s law is written as
σ = 2Gϵ + λtr (ϵ) I = 2Gdevϵ +
%
λ + 2
3G
&
tr (ϵ) I,
(5.90)
where G and λ denote the so-called Lam´e constants. The corresponding super-
symmetric elasticity tensor takes the form
C = 2GIs + λI ⊙I = 2GPs
dev + (3λ + 2G) Psph.

Analysis of Tensor Functions
6.1 Scalar-Valued Isotropic Tensor Functions
Let us consider a real scalar-valued function f (A1, A2, . . . , Al) of second-
order tensors Ak ∈Linn (k = 1, 2, . . ., l). The function f is said to be isotropic
if
f

QA1QT, QA2QT, . . . , QAlQT
= f (A1, A2, . . . , Al) ,
∀Q ∈Orthn.
(6.1)
Example. Consider the function f (A, B) = tr (AB). Since in view of
(1.129) and (1.144)

∀Q ∈Orthn,
this function is isotropic according to the deﬁnition (6.1). In contrast, the func-
tion f (A) = tr (AL), where L denotes a second-order tensor, is not isotropic.
Indeed,
f

QAQT


QAQTL

̸= tr (AL) .
Scalar-valued isotropic tensor functions are also called isotropic invariants
of the tensors Ak (k = 1, 2, . . ., l). For such a tensor system one can construct,
in principle, an unlimited number of isotropic invariants. However, for every
ﬁnite system of tensors one can ﬁnd a ﬁnite number of isotropic invariants
in terms of which all other isotropic invariants can be expressed (Hilbert’s
theorem). This system of invariants is called functional basis of the tensors
Ak (k = 1, 2, . . ., l). For one and the same system of tensors there exist many

112

functional bases. A functional basis is called irreducible if none of its elements
can be expressed in a unique form in terms of the remaining invariants.
First, we focus on isotropic functions of one second-order tensor
f

QAQT

∀Q ∈Orthn,
A ∈Linn.
(6.2)
One can show that the principal traces trAk, principal invariants I(k)
A
and
eigenvalues λk, (k = 1, 2, . . ., n) of the tensor A represent its isotropic tensor
functions. Indeed, for the principal traces we can write by virtue of (1.144)

∀Q ∈Orthn.
(6.3)
The principal invariants are uniquely expressed in terms of the principal traces
by means of Newton’s formula (4.26), while the eigenvalues are, in turn, de-
ﬁned by the principal invariants as solutions of the characteristic equation
(4.20) with the characteristic polynomial given by (4.18).
Further, we prove that both the eigenvalues λk, principal invariants I(k)
M
and principal traces trMk (k = 1, 2, . . ., n) of one symmetric tensor M ∈
Symn form its functional bases (see also [45]). To this end, we consider two
arbitrary symmetric second-order tensors M1, M2 ∈Symn with the same
eigenvalues. Then, the spectral representation (4.60) takes the form
M1 =
n
	
i=1
λini ⊗ni,
M2 =
n
	
i=1
λimi ⊗mi,
(6.4)
where according to (4.62) both the eigenvectors ni and mi form orthonormal
bases such that ni · nj = δij and mi · mj = δij (i, j = 1, 2, . . ., n). Now, we
consider the orthogonal tensor
Q =

(6.6)
Hence,
f (M1) = f

QM1QT
= f (M2) .
(6.7)
Thus, f takes the same value for all symmetric tensors with pairwise equal
eigenvalues. This means that an isotropic tensor function of a symmetric
tensor is uniquely deﬁned in terms of its eigenvalues, principal invariants or
principal traces because the latter ones are, in turn, uniquely deﬁned by the
eigenvalues according to (4.24) and (4.25). This implies the following repre-

By means of (6.8) this function can be expressed by
ψ (C) =

trC, trC2, trC3

(6.10)
where λi denote the so-called principal stretches. They are expressed in
terms of the eigenvalues Λi (i = 1, 2, 3) of the right Cauchy-Green tensor
C = (3
i=1 ΛiPi as λi = √Λi. For example, the strain energy function of
the so-called Mooney-Rivlin material is given in terms of the ﬁrst and second
principal invariants by
ψ (C) = c1 (IC −3) + c2 (IIC −3) ,
(6.11)
where c1 and c2 represent material constants. In contrast, the strain energy
function of the Ogden material [29] is deﬁned in terms of the principal stretches
by
ψ (C) =

where μr, αr (r = 1, 2, . . . , m) denote material constants.
For isotropic functions (6.1) of a ﬁnite number l of arbitrary second-order
tensors the functional basis is obtained only for three-dimensional space. In or-
der to represent this basis, the tensor arguments are split according to (1.145)
into a symmetric and a skew-symmetric part respectively as follows:
Mi = symAi = 1
2

Ai + AT
i

,
Wi = skewAi = 1
2

Ai −AT
i

.
(6.13)
In this manner, every isotropic tensor function can be given in terms of a
ﬁnite number of symmetric tensors Mi ∈Sym3 (i = 1, 2, . . ., m) and skew-
symmetric tensors Wi ∈Skew3 (i = 1, 2, . . ., w) as
f = ˆf (M1, M2, . . . , Mm, W1, W2, . . . , Ww) .
(6.14)
An irreducible functional basis of such a system of tensors is proved to be
given by (see [2], [32], [40])

(6.15)
For illustration of this result we consider some examples.
Example 1. Functional basis of one skew-symmetric second-order tensor
W ∈Skew3. With the aid of (6.15) and (4.87) we obtain the basis consisting
of only one invariant
trW2 = −2IIW = −∥W∥2 .
(6.16)
Example 2. Functional basis of an arbitrary second-order tensor A ∈

6.2 Scalar-Valued Anisotropic Tensor Functions
A real scalar-valued function f (A1, A2, . . . , Al) of second-order tensors Ak ∈
Linn (k = 1, 2, . . . , l) is said to be anisotropic if it is invariant only with respect
to a subset of all orthogonal transformations:
f

QA1QT, QA2QT, . . . , QAlQT
= f (A1, A2, . . . , Al) ,
∀Q ∈Sorthn ⊂Orthn.
(6.20)
The subset Sorthn represents a group called symmetry group. In continuum
mechanics, anisotropic properties of materials are characterized by their sym-
metry group. The largest symmetry group Orth3 (in three-dimensional space)
includes all orthogonal transformations and is referred to as isotropic. In con-
trast, the smallest symmetry group consists of only two elements I and −I
and is called triclinic.
Example. Transversely isotropic material symmetry. In this case
the material is characterized by symmetry with respect to one selected direc-
tion referred to as principal material direction. Properties of a transversely
isotropic material remain unchanged by rotations about, and reﬂections from
the planes orthogonal or parallel to, this direction. Introducing a unit vector
l in the principal direction we can write
Ql = ±l,
∀Q ∈gt,
(6.21)
where gt ⊂Orth3 denotes the transversely isotropic symmetry group. With
the aid of a special tensor
L = l ⊗l,
(6.22)
called structural tensor, condition (6.21) can be represented as
QLQT = L,
∀Q ∈gt.
(6.23)

116
6 Analysis of Tensor Functions
Hence, the transversely isotropic symmetry group can be deﬁned by
gt =

Q ∈Orth3 : QLQT = L

.
(6.24)
A strain energy function ψ of a transversely isotropic material is invariant with
respect to all orthogonal transformations within gt. Using a representation in
terms of the right Cauchy-Green tensor C this leads to the following condition:
ψ

QCQT
= ψ (C) ,
∀Q ∈gt.
(6.25)
It can be shown that this condition is a priori satisﬁed if the strain energy
function can be represented as an isotropic function of both C and L so that
ˆψ

QCQT, QLQT
= ˆψ (C, L) ,
∀Q ∈Orth3.
(6.26)
Indeed,
ˆψ (C, L) = ˆψ

QCQT, QLQT
= ˆψ

QCQT, L

,
∀Q ∈gt.
(6.27)
With the aid of the functional basis (6.19) and taking into account the iden-
tities
Lk = L,
trLk = 1,
k = 1, 2, . . .
(6.28)
resulting from (6.22) we can thus represent the transversely isotropic function
in terms of the ﬁve invariants by (see also [42])
ψ = ˆψ (C, L) = ˜ψ

trC, trC2, trC3, tr (CL) , tr

C2L

.
(6.29)
The above procedure can be generalized for an arbitrary anisotropic sym-
metry group g. Let Li (i = 1, 2, . . ., m) be a set of second-order tensors which
uniquely deﬁne g by
g =

Q ∈Orthn : QLiQT = Li, i = 1, 2, . . . , m

.
(6.30)
In continuum mechanics the tensors Li are called structural tensors since they
lay down the material or structural symmetry.
It is seen that the isotropic tensor function
f

QAiQT, QLjQT
= f (Ai, Lj) ,
∀Q ∈Orthn,
(6.31)
where we use the abbreviated notation
f (Ai, Lj) = f (A1, A2, . . . , Al, L1, L2, . . . , Lm) ,
(6.32)
is anisotropic with respect to the arguments Ai (i = 1, 2, . . ., l) so that

6.2 Scalar-Valued Anisotropic Tensor Functions
117
f

QAiQT
= f (Ai) ,
∀Q ∈g.
(6.33)
Indeed, by virtue of (6.30) and (6.31) we have
f (Ai, Lj) = f

QAiQT, QLjQT
= f

QAiQT, Lj

,
∀Q ∈g.
(6.34)
Thus, every isotropic invariant of the tensor system Ai (i = 1, 2, . . . , l), Lj
(j = 1, 2, . . ., m) represents an anisotropic invariant of the tensors Ai (i =
1, 2, . . . , l) in the sense of deﬁnition (6.20). Conversely, one can show that
for every anisotropic function (6.33) there exists an equivalent isotropic func-
tion of the tensor system Ai (i = 1, 2, . . . , l) , Lj (j = 1, 2, . . ., m). In order to
prove this statement we consider a new tensor function deﬁned by
ˆf (Ai, Xj) = f

Q′AiQ′T
,
(6.35)
where the tensor Q′ ∈Orthn results from the condition:
Q′XjQ′T = Lj,
j = 1, 2, . . ., m.
(6.36)
Thus, the function ˆf is deﬁned only over such tensors Xj that can be obtained
from the structural tensors Lj (j = 1, 2, . . ., m) by the transformation
Xj = Q′TLjQ′,
j = 1, 2, . . ., m,
(6.37)
where Q′ is an arbitrary orthogonal tensor.
Further, one can show that the so-deﬁned function (6.35) is isotropic.
Indeed,
ˆf

QAiQT, QXjQT
= f

Q′′QAiQTQ′′T
,
∀Q ∈Orthn,
(6.38)
where according to (6.36)
Q′′QXjQTQ′′T = Lj,
Q′′ ∈Orthn.
(6.39)
Inserting (6.37) into (6.39) yields
Q′′QQ′TLjQ′QTQ′′T = Lj,
(6.40)
so that
Q∗= Q′′QQ′T ∈g.
(6.41)
Hence, we can write
f

Q′′QAiQTQ′′T
= f

Q∗Q′AiQ′TQ∗T
= f

Q′AiQ′T
= ˆf (Ai, Xj)
and consequently in view of (6.38)
ˆf

QAiQT, QXjQT
= ˆf (Ai, Xj) ,
∀Q ∈Orthn.
(6.42)
Thus, we have proved the following theorem [49].

118
6 Analysis of Tensor Functions
Theorem 6.1. A scalar-valued function f (Ai) is invariant within the sym-
metry group g deﬁned by (6.30) if and only if there exists an isotropic function
ˆf (Ai, Lj) such that
f (Ai) = ˆf (Ai, Lj) .
(6.43)
6.3 Derivatives of Scalar-Valued Tensor Functions
Let us again consider a scalar-valued tensor function f (A) : Linn →R. This
function is said to be diﬀerentiable in a neighborhood of A if there exists a
tensor f (A) ,A ∈Linn, such that
d
dtf (A + tX)

t=0
= f (A) ,A : X,
∀X ∈Linn.
(6.44)
This deﬁnition implies that the directional derivative (also called Gateaux
derivative)
d
dtf (A + tX)

t=0
exists and is continuous at A. The tensor
f (A) ,A is referred to as the derivative or the gradient of the tensor func-
tion f (A).
In order to obtain a direct expression for f (A) ,A we represent the
tensors A and X in (6.44) with respect to an arbitrary basis, say gi ⊗
gj (i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n). Then, using the chain rule one can write
d
dtf (A + tX)

Comparing this result with (6.44) yields
f (A) ,A = ∂f

gi⊗gj =
∂f
∂Aij
gi⊗gj =
∂f
∂Aij gi⊗gj =
∂f
∂A j
i·
gi⊗gj. (6.45)
If the function f (A) is deﬁned not on all linear transformations but only
on a subset Slinn ⊂Linn, the directional derivative (6.44) does not, however,
yield a unique result for f (A) ,A. In this context, let us consider for example
scalar-valued functions of symmetric tensors: f (M) : Symn →R. In this case,
the directional derivative (6.44) deﬁnes f (M) ,M only up to an arbitrary skew-
symmetric component W. Indeed,
f (M) ,M : X = [f (M) ,M +W] : X,
∀W ∈Skewn, ∀X ∈Symn. (6.46)
In this relation, X is restricted to symmetric tensors because the tensor M+tX
appearing in the directional derivative (6.44) must belong to the deﬁnition
domain of the function f for all real values of t.

6.3 Derivatives of Scalar-Valued Tensor Functions
119
To avoid this non-uniqueness we will assume that the derivative f (A) ,A
belongs to the same subset Slinn ⊂Linn as its argument A ∈Slinn. In
particular, for symmetric tensor functions it implies that
f (M) ,M ∈Symn
for
M ∈Symn.
(6.47)
In order to calculate the derivative of a symmetric tensor function satisfy-
ing the condition (6.47) one can apply the following procedure. First, the
deﬁnition domain of the function f is notionally extended to all linear trans-
formations Linn. Applying then the directional derivative (6.44) one obtains a
unique result for the tensor f,M which is ﬁnally symmetrized. For the deriva-
tive with respect to a symmetric part (1.146) of a tensor argument this pro-
cedure can be written by
f (A) ,symA = sym [f (A) ,A ] ,
A ∈Linn.
(6.48)
The problem with the non-uniqueness appears likewise by using the com-
ponent representation (6.45) for the gradient of symmetric tensor functions.
Indeed, in this case Mij = Mji (i ̸= j = 1, 2, . . . , n), so that only n (n + 1) /2
among all n2 components of the tensor argument M ∈Symn are independent.
Thus, according to (1.149)
M =
n
	
i=1
Miigi ⊗gi +
n
	
i,j=1
j<i
Mij (gi ⊗gj + gj ⊗gi) ,
M ∈Symn.
(6.49)
Hence, instead of (6.45) we obtain
f (M) ,M = 1

i,j=1

∂f
∂Mij
(gi ⊗gj + gj ⊗gi) ,
M ∈Symn.
(6.50)
It is seen that the derivative is taken here only with respect to the independent
components of the symmetric tensor argument; the resulting tensor is then
symmetrized.

Example 5. Derivatives of the eigenvalues λi. First, we show that
simple eigenvalues of a second-order tensor A are diﬀerentiable. To this end,
we consider the directional derivative (6.44) of an eigenvalue λ:
d
dtλ (A + tX)

t=0
.
(6.62)
Herein, λ (t) represents an implicit function deﬁned through the characteristic
equation
det (A + tX −λI) = p (λ, t) = 0.
(6.63)
This equation can be written out in the polynomial form (4.18) with respect
to powers of λ. The coeﬃcients of this polynomial are principal invariants of
the tensor A + tX. According to the results of the previous example these
invariants are diﬀerentiable with respect to A + tX and therefore also with
respect to t. For this reason, the function p (λ, t) is diﬀerentiable both with
respect to λ and t. For a simple eigenvalue λ0 = λ (0) we can further write
(see also [26])
p (λ0, 0) = 0,
∂p (λ, 0)
∂λ

λ=λ0
̸= 0.
(6.64)
According to the implicit function theorem (see, e.g., [5]), the above condition
ensures the diﬀerentiability of the function λ (t) at t = 0. Thus, the directional
derivative (6.62) exists and is continuous at A.
In order to represent the derivative λi,A we ﬁrst consider the spectral
representation (4.43) of the tensor A with pairwise distinct eigenvalues
A =

trAl =

l = 1, 2, . . ., n.

(6.68)
Comparing the linear equation systems (6.66) and (6.68) we notice that

Finally, the Sylvester formula (4.54) results in the expression

It is seen that the solution (6.70) holds even if the remainder eigenvalues

(6.70) transforms to

A tensor-valued function g (A1, A2, . . . , Al) ∈Linn of a tensor system Ak ∈
Linn (k = 1, 2, . . . , l) is called anisotropic if

(6.72)
For isotropic tensor-valued tensor functions the above identity holds for all
orthogonal transformations so that Sorthn = Orthn.
As a starting point for the discussion of tensor-valued tensor functions we
again consider isotropic functions of one argument. In this case,
g

QAQT
= Qg (A) QT,
∀Q ∈Orthn.
(6.73)
For example, one can easily show that the polynomial function (1.108) and
the exponential function (1.109) introduced in Chap. 1 are isotropic. Indeed,
for a tensor polynomial g (A) = (m

(6.74)
Of special interest are isotropic functions of a symmetric tensor. First, we
prove that the tensors g (M) and M ∈Symn are coaxial i.e. have the eigen-
vectors in common. To this end, we represent M in the spectral form (4.60)
by
M =
n
	
i=1
λibi ⊗bi,
(6.75)
where bi · bj = δij (i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n). Further, we choose an arbitrary eigen-
vector, say bk, and show that it simultaneously represents an eigenvector of
g (M). Indeed, let
Q = 2bk ⊗bk −I = bk ⊗bk +
n
	
i=1
i̸=k
(−1) bi ⊗bi
(6.76)
bearing in mind that I = (n
i=1 bi ⊗bi in accordance with (1.87). The tensor
Q (6.76) is orthogonal since
QQT = (2bk ⊗bk −I) (2bk ⊗bk −I) = 4bk⊗bk−2bk⊗bk−2bk⊗bk+I = I
and symmetric as well. One of its eigenvalues is equal to 1 while all the other
ones are −1. Thus, we can write

126
6 Analysis of Tensor Functions
QM = (2bk ⊗bk −I) M = 2λkbk ⊗bk −M = M (2bk ⊗bk −I) = MQ
and consequently
QMQT = M.
(6.77)
Since the function g (M) is isotropic
g (M) = g

QMQT
= Qg (M) QT
and therefore
Qg (M) = g (M) Q.
(6.78)
Mapping the vector bk by both sides of this identity yields in view of (6.76)
Qg (M) bk = g (M) bk.
(6.79)
It is seen that the vector g (M) bk is an eigenvector of Q (6.76) associated
with the eigenvalue 1. Since it is the simple eigenvalue
g (M) bk = γkbk,
(6.80)
where γk is some real number. Hence, bk represents the right eigenvector of
g (M). Forming the left mapping of bk by (6.78) one can similarly show that
bk is also the left eigenvector of g (M), which implies the symmetry of the
tensor g (M).
Now, we are in a position to prove the following representation theorem
[35], [45].
Theorem 6.2. A tensor-valued tensor function g (M), M ∈Symn is isotropic
if and only if it allows the following representation
g (M) = ϕ0I + ϕ1M + ϕ2M2 + . . . + ϕn−1Mn−1 =
n−1
	
i=0
ϕiMi,
(6.81)
where ϕi are isotropic invariants (isotropic scalar functions) of M and can
therefore be expressed as functions of its principal invariants by
ϕi =

I(1)
M , I(2)
M , . . . , I(n)
M

,
i = 0, 1, . . ., n −1.
(6.82)
Proof. We have already proved that the tensors g (M) and M have eigenvec-
tors in common. Thus, according to (6.75)
g (M) =
n
	
i=1
γibi ⊗bi,
(6.83)

6.4 Tensor-Valued Isotropic and Anisotropic Tensor Functions
127
where γi = γi (M). Hence (see Exercise 6.1(e)),
g

Since the function g (M) is isotropic we have

=
n
	
i=1
γi (M) Q (bi ⊗bi) QT,
∀Q ∈Orthn.
(6.85)
Comparing (6.84) with (6.85) we conclude that
γi

QMQT
= γi (M) ,
i = 1, . . . , n,
∀Q ∈Orthn.
(6.86)
Thus, the eigenvalues of the tensor g (M) represent isotropic (scalar-valued)
functions of M. Collecting repeated eigenvalues of g (M) we can further
rewrite (6.83) in terms of the eigenprojections Pi (i = 1, 2, . . . , s) by
g (M) =
s
	
i=1
γiPi,
(6.87)
where s (1 ≤s ≤n) denotes the number of pairwise distinct eigenvalues of
g (M). Using the representation of the eigenprojections (4.55) based on the
Sylvester formula (4.54) we can write
Pi =
s−1
	
r=0
α(r)
i
(λ1, λ2, . . . , λs) Mr,
i = 1, 2, . . ., s.
(6.88)
Inserting this result into (6.87) yields the representation (suﬃciency):
g (M) =
s−1
	
i=0
ϕiMi,
(6.89)
where the functions ϕi (i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., s −1) are given according to (6.8)
and (6.86) by (6.82). The necessity is evident. Indeed, the function (6.81)
is isotropic since in view of (6.74)

Example. Constitutive relations for isotropic materials. For iso-
tropic materials the second Piola-Kirchhoﬀstress tensor S represents an
isotropic function of the right Cauchy-Green tensor C so that
S

QCQT
= QS (C) QT,
∀Q ∈Orth3.
(6.91)
Thus, according to the representation theorem
S (C) = α0I + α1C + α2C2,
(6.92)
where αi = αi (C) (i = 0, 1, 2) are some scalar-valued isotropic functions of C.
The same result can be obtained for isotropic hyperelastic materials by con-
sidering the representation of the strain energy function (6.10) in the relation
(see, e.g., [29])
S = 2 ∂ψ
∂C.
(6.93)
Indeed, using the chain rule of diﬀerentiation and keeping in mind that the
tensor C is symmetric we obtain by means of (6.52)

so that αi (C) = 2 (i + 1) ∂˜ψ/∂trCi+1 (i = 0, 1, 2).
Let us further consider a linearly elastic material characterized by a linear
stress-strain response. In this case, the relation (6.92) reduces to
S (C) = ϕ (C) I + cC,
(6.95)
where c is a material constant and ϕ (C) represents an isotropic scalar-valued
function linear in C. In view of (6.15) this function can be expressed by
ϕ (C) = a + btrC,
(6.96)
where a and b are again material constants. Assuming that the reference con-
ﬁguration, in which C = I, is stress free, yields a+3b+c = 0 and consequently
S (C) = (−c −3b + btrC) I + cC = b (trC −3) I + c (C −I) .
Introducing further the so-called Green-Lagrange strain tensor deﬁned by
˜E = 1

The material described by the linear constitutive relation (6.98) is referred
to as St.Venant-Kirchhoﬀmaterial. The corresponding material constants 2b
and 2c are called Lam´e constants. The strain energy function resulting in the
constitutive law (6.98) by (6.93) or equivalently by S = ∂ψ/∂˜E is of the form

For isotropic functions of an arbitrary tensor system Ak ∈Linn (k =
1, 2, . . . , l) the representations are obtained only for the three-dimensional
space. One again splits tensor arguments into symmetric Mi ∈Sym3 (i =
1, 2, . . . , m) and skew-symmetric tensors Wj ∈Skew3 (j = 1, 2, . . ., w) ac-
cording to (6.13). Then, all isotropic tensor-valued functions of these tensors
can be represented as linear combinations of the following terms (see [32],
[40]), where the coeﬃcients represent scalar-valued isotropic functions of the
same tensor arguments.

(6.101)
For anisotropic tensor-valued tensor functions one utilizes the procedure
applied for scalar-valued functions. It is based on the following theorem [49]
(cf. Theorem 6.1).
Theorem 6.3. (Rychlewski’s theorem) A tensor-valued function g (Ai) is
anisotropic with the symmetry group Sorthn = g deﬁned by (6.30) if and
only if there exists an isotropic tensor-valued function ˆg (Ai, Lj) such that
g (Ai) = ˆg (Ai, Lj) .
(6.102)

130
6 Analysis of Tensor Functions
Proof. Let us deﬁne a new tensor-valued function by
ˆg (Ai, Xj) = Q′Tg

Q′AiQ′T
Q′,
(6.103)
where the tensor Q′ ∈Orthn results from the condition (6.36). The further
proof is similar to Theorem 6.1 (Exercise 6.12).
Example. Constitutive relations for a transversely isotropic elas-
tic material. For illustration of the above results we construct a general
constitutive equation for an elastic transversely isotropic material. The trans-
versely isotropic material symmetry is deﬁned by one structural tensor L
(6.22) according to (6.24). The second Piola-Kirchhoﬀstress tensor S is a
transversely isotropic function of the right Cauchy-Green tensor C. According
to Rychlewski’s theorem S can be represented as an isotropic tensor function
of C and L by
S = S (C, L) ,
(6.104)
such that
S

QCQT, QLQT
= QS (C, L) QT,
∀Q ∈Orth3.
(6.105)
This ensures that the condition of the material symmetry is fulﬁlled a priori
since


QCQT, QLQT
= QS (C, L) QT, ∀Q ∈gt. (6.106)
Keeping in mind that S, C and L are symmetric tensors we can write by
virtue of (6.28)1 and (6.100)
S (C, L) = α0I + α1L + α2C
+ α3C2 + α4 (CL + LC) + α5

C2L + LC2

(6.107)
The coeﬃcients αi (i = 0, 1, . . ., 5) represent scalar-valued isotropic tensor

(6.108)
For comparison we derive the constitutive equations for a hyperelastic trans-
versely isotropic material. To this end, we utilize the general representation
for the transversely isotropic strain energy function (6.29). By the chain rule
of diﬀerentiation and with the aid of (6.52) and (6.54) we obtain
S = 2 ∂˜ψ

and ﬁnally
S = α0I + α1L + α2C + α3C2 + α4 (CL + LC) .
(6.110)
Comparing (6.107) and (6.110) we observe that the representation for the
hyperelastic transversely isotropic material does not include the last term in
(6.107) with C2L+LC2. Thus, the constitutive equations containing this term
correspond to an elastic but not hyperelastic transversely isotropic material.
The latter material cannot be described by a strain energy function.
6.5 Derivatives of Tensor-Valued Tensor Functions
The derivative of a tensor-valued tensor function can be deﬁned in a similar
fashion to (6.44). A function g (A) : Linn →Linn is said to be diﬀerentiable
in a neighborhood of A if there exists a fourth-order tensor g (A) ,A ∈Linn
(called the derivative), such that
d


t=0
= g (A) ,A : X,
∀X ∈Linn.
(6.111)
The above deﬁnition implies that the directional derivative d


t=0
exists and is continuous at A.
Similarly to (6.45) we can obtain a direct relation for the fourth-order
tensor g (A) ,A. To this end, we represent the tensors A, X and G = g (A)
with respect to an arbitrary basis in Linn, say gi ⊗gj (i, j = 1, 2, . . ., n).
Applying the chain rule of diﬀerentiation we can write

(6.113)
For functions deﬁned only on a subset Slinn ⊂Linn the directional deriva-
tive (6.111) again does not deliver a unique result. Similarly to scalar-valued
functions this problem can be avoided deﬁning the fourth-order tensor g (A) ,A

as a linear mapping on Slinn. Of special interest in this context are symmet-
ric tensor functions. In this case, using (5.47) and applying the procedure

The calculation of the derivative of tensor functions can be simpliﬁed by
means of diﬀerentiation rules. One of them is the following composition rule.
Let G = g (A) and H = h (A) be two arbitrary diﬀerentiable tensor-valued
functions of A. Then,
(GH) ,A = G,A H + GH,A .

of the deformation gradient F respectively by
C = FTF,

Of special interest in continuum mechanics is the derivative of these tensors
with respect to F. With the aid of the product rule (6.123) and using (5.42),
(5.77), (5.82), (5.83)1, (6.118) and (6.121) we obtain
C,F = FT,F F + FTF,F = TF + FTI = (I ⊗F)t + FT ⊗I,
(6.125)
b,F = F,F FT + FFT,F = IFT + FT = I ⊗FT + (F ⊗I)t .

Further product rules of diﬀerentiation of tensor functions can be written
as
(fG) ,A = G ⊙f,A +fG,A ,
(6.127)
(G : H) ,A = H : G,A +G : H,A ,
(6.128)
where f = ˆf (A), G = g (A) and H = h (A) are again a scalar-valued and two
tensor-valued diﬀerentiable tensor functions, respectively. The proof is similar
to (6.123) (see Exercise 6.14).
Example 5. With the aid of the above diﬀerentiation rules we can eas-
ily express the derivatives of the spherical and deviatoric parts (1.153) of a

(6.131)
where ˜E denotes the Green-Lagrange strain tensor deﬁned in (6.97). For hy-
perelastic materials this deﬁnition implies in view of (6.93) the representation
C =

(6.132)
For a hyperelastic isotropic material we thus obtain by virtue of (6.119),

(6.135)
represents a universal relation connecting powers of a second-order tensor
A with its principal invariants. Similar universal relations connecting several
second-order tensors might also be useful for example for the representation of
isotropic tensor functions or for the solution of tensor equations. Such relations
are generally called Rivlin’s identities.
In order to formulate the Rivlin identities we ﬁrst diﬀerentiate the Cayley-
Hamilton equation (6.135) with respect to A. With the aid of (6.58), (6.117)
and (6.127) we can write

Analytic Tensor Functions
7.1 Introduction
In the previous chapter we discussed isotropic and anisotropic tensor func-
tions and their general representations. Of particular interest in continuum
mechanics are isotropic tensor-valued functions of one arbitrary (not neces-
sarily symmetric) tensor. For example, the exponential function of the velocity
gradient or other non-symmetric strain rates is very suitable for the formula-
tion of evolution equations in large strain anisotropic plasticity. In this section
we focus on a special class of isotropic tensor-valued functions referred here
to as analytic tensor functions. In order to specify this class of functions we
ﬁrst deal with the general question how an isotropic tensor-valued function
can be deﬁned.
For isotropic functions of diagonalizable tensors the most natural way is
the spectral decomposition (4.43)
A =
s
	
i=1
λiPi,
(7.1)
so that we may write similarly to (4.48)
g (A) =
s
	
i=1
g (λi) Pi,
(7.2)
where g (λi) is an arbitrary (not necessarily polynomial) scalar function de-
ﬁned on the spectrum λi (i = 1, 2, . . ., s) of the tensor A. Obviously, the so-
deﬁned function g (A) is isotropic in the sense of the condition (6.73). Indeed,

where we take into account that the spectral decomposition of the tensor

Example. Generalized strain measures. The so-called generalized
strain measures E and e (also known as Hill’s strains, [15], [16]) play an im-
portant role in kinematics of continuum. They are deﬁned by (7.2) as isotropic
tensor-valued functions of the symmetric right and left stretch tensor U and
v and are referred to as Lagrangian (material) and Eulerian (spatial) strains,
respectively. The deﬁnition of the generalized strains is based on the spectral
representations by
U =
s
	
i=1
λiPi,
v =
s
	
i=1
λipi,
(7.5)
where λi > 0 are the eigenvalues (referred to as principal stretches) while Pi
and pi (i = 1, 2, . . . , s) denote the corresponding eigenprojections. Accord-
ingly,
E =
s
	
i=1
f (λi) Pi,
e =
s
	
i=1
f (λi) pi,
(7.6)
where f is a strictly-increasing scalar function satisfying the conditions f (1) =
0 and f ′ (1) = 1. A special class of generalized strain measures speciﬁed by
E(a) =

(7.8)
are referred to as Seth’s strains [39], where a is a real number. For example, the
Green-Lagrange strain tensor (6.97) introduced in Chap. 6 belongs to Seth’s
strains as E(2).
Since non-symmetric tensors do not generally admit the spectral decompo-
sition in the diagonal form (7.1), it is necessary to search for other approaches
for the deﬁnition of the isotropic tensor function g (A) : Linn →Linn. One of
these approaches is the tensor power series of the form
g (A) = a0I + a1A + a2A2 + . . . =

(7.10)
For example, the exponential tensor function can be deﬁned in terms of the
inﬁnite power series (7.9) by (1.109).
One can show that the power series (7.9), provided it converges, repre-
sents a generalization of (7.2) to arbitrary (and not necessarily diagonalizable)
second-order tensors. Conversely, the isotropic tensor function (7.2) with g (λ)
analytic on the spectrum of A can be considered as an extension of inﬁnite
power series (7.9) to its non-convergent domain if the latter exists. Indeed, for
diagonalizable tensor arguments within the convergence domain of the tensor
power series (7.9) both deﬁnitions coincide. For example, inserting (7.1) into
(7.9) and taking (4.47) into account we have
g (A) =

so that

(7.13)
The above mentioned convergence requirement vastly restricts the deﬁni-
tion domain of many isotropic tensor functions deﬁned in terms of inﬁnite
series (7.9). For example, one can show that the power series for the logarith-
mic tensor function
ln (A + I) =
∞
	
r=1
(−1)r+1 Ar
r
(7.14)
converges for |λi| < 1 (i = 1, 2, . . . , s) and diverges if |λk| > 1 at least for some
k (1 ≤k ≤s) (see, e.g., [12]).
In order to avoid this convergence problem we consider a tensor function
deﬁned by the so-called Dunford-Taylor integral as (see, for example, [24])
g (A) =
1
2πi
7
Γ
g (ζ) (ζI −A)−1 dζ

taken on the complex plane over Γ, where Γ represents a closed curve or
consists of simple closed curves, the union interior of which includes all the
eigenvalues λi ∈C (i = 1, 2, . . ., s) of the tensor argument A. g (ζ) : C →C
is an arbitrary scalar function analytic within and on Γ.
One can easily prove that the tensor function (7.15) is isotropic in the
sense of the deﬁnition (6.73). Indeed, with the aid of (1.127) and (1.128) we
obtain (cf. [33])

It can be veriﬁed that for diagonalizable tensors the Dunford-Taylor integral
(7.15) reduces to the spectral decomposition (7.2) and represents therefore its
generalization. Indeed, inserting (7.1) into (7.15) delivers

where we keep (4.46) in mind and apply the the Cauchy integral formula (see,
e.g. [5]). Using this result we can represent, for example, the generalized strain
measures (7.6) by
E = f (U) ,
e = f (v) ,
(7.18)
where the tensor functions f (U) and f (v) are deﬁned by (7.15).
Further, one can show that the Dunford-Taylor integral (7.15) also repre-
sents a generalization of tensor power series (7.9). For this purpose, it suﬃces
to verify that (7.15) based on a scalar function g (ζ) = ζk (k = 0, 1, 2, . . .)
results into the monomial g (A) = Ak. To this end, we consider in (7.15) the
following identity [24]

7.2 Closed-Form Representation for Analytic Tensor Functions
145
g (ζ) I = (ζI)k = (ζI −A + A)k = (ζI −A)k + . . . + Ak.
(7.19)
Thereby, all terms except of the last one have no pole within Γ and vanish
according to the Cauchy theorem (see, e.g., [5]), so that
g (A) =

dζ = Ak.
(7.20)
Isotropic tensor functions deﬁned by (7.15) will henceforth be referred to
as analytic tensor functions. The above discussed properties of analytic tensor
functions can be completed by the following relations (Exercise 7.3)
g (A) = αf (A) + βh (A) ,
if
g (λ) = αf (λ) + βh (λ) ,
g (A) = f (A) h (A) ,
if
g (λ) = f (λ) h (λ) ,
g (A) = f (h (A)) ,
if
g (λ) = f (h (λ)) .
(7.21)
In the following we will deal with representations for analytic tensor functions
and their derivatives.
7.2 Closed-Form Representation for Analytic Tensor
Functions and Their Derivatives
Our aim is to obtain the so-called closed form representation for analytic
tensor functions and their derivatives. This representation should be given
only in terms of ﬁnite powers of the tensor argument and its eigenvalues and
avoid any reference to the integral over the complex plane or to power series.
We start with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem (4.91) for the tensor ζI −A
n
	
k=0
(−1)k I(k)
ζI−A (ζI −A)n−k = 0.
(7.22)
With the aid of the Vieta theorem (4.24) we can write
I(0)
ζI−A = 1,
I(k)
ζI−A =
n
	
i1<i2<...<ik
(ζ −λi1) (ζ −λi2) . . . (ζ −λik) ,
(7.23)
where k = 1, 2, . . ., n and the eigenvalues λi (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) of the tensor A
are counted with their multiplicity.
Composing (7.22) with the so-called resolvent of A
R (ζ) = (ζI −A)−1
(7.24)
yields

(7.32)
The Cauchy integrals in (7.32) can be calculated with the aid of the residue
theorem (see, e.g.,[5]). To this end, we ﬁrst represent the determinant of the
tensor ζI −A in the form

ζI−A = det (ζI −A) =

(7.33)
where λi denote pairwise distinct eigenvalues with the algebraic multiplicities
ri (i = 1, 2, . . . , s) such that
s
	
i=1
ri = n.
(7.34)
Thus, inserting (7.30) and (7.33) into (7.32) we obtain

(7.35)
where p = 1, 2, . . ., n −1.
The derivative of the tensor function g (A) can be obtained by direct
diﬀerentiation of the Dunfod-Taylor integral (7.15). Thus, by use of (6.122)
we can write
g (A) ,A =

7 Analytic Tensor Functions
7.3 Special Case: Diagonalizable Tensor Functions
For analytic functions of diagonalizable tensors the deﬁnitions in terms of
the Dunford-Taylor integral (7.15) on the one side and eigenprojections (7.2)
on the other side become equivalent. In this special case, one can obtain
alternative closed-form representations for analytic tensor functions and their
derivatives. To this end, we ﬁrst derive an alternative representation of the
Sylvester formula (4.54). In Sect. 4.4 we have shown that the eigenprojections
can be given by (4.51)
Pi = pi (A) ,
i = 1, 2, . . . , s,
(7.41)
where pi (i = 1, 2, . . . , s) are polynomials satisfying the requirements (4.50).
Thus, the eigenprojections of a second-order tensor can be considered as its
analytic (isotropic) tensor functions. Applying the Dunford-Taylor integral
(7.15) we can thus write
Pi =
1
2πi
7
Γ
pi (ζ) (ζI −A)−1 dζ,
i = 1, 2, . . ., s.
(7.42)
Similarly to (7.31) and (7.35) we further obtain
Pi =
n−1
	
p=0
ρipAp,
i = 1, 2, . . ., s,
(7.43)
where
ρip =
s
	
k=1

(rk −1)! lim
ζ→λk
! drk−1
dζrk−1 [pi (ζ) αp (ζ) (ζ −λk)rk]
$
(7.44)
and αp (p = 0, 1, . . ., n −1) are given by (7.30). With the aid of polynomial
functions pi (λ) satisfying in addition to (4.50) the following conditions
dr
dλr pi (λ)

λ=λj
= 0
i, j = 1, 2, . . ., s; r = 1, 2, . . . , ri −1
(7.45)
we can simplify (7.44) by
ρip =
1
(ri −1)! lim
ζ→λi
! dri−1
dζri−1 [αp (ζ) (ζ −λi)ri]
$
.
(7.46)
Now, inserting (7.43) into (7.2) delivers
g (A) =

p=0
ρipAp.
(7.47)

7.3 Special Case: Diagonalizable Tensor Functions

In order to obtain an alternative representation for g (A) ,A we again consider
the tensor power series (7.9). Direct diﬀerentiation of (7.9) with respect to A
delivers with the aid of (6.117)
g (A) ,A =
∞
	
r=1
ar
r−1
	
k=0
Ar−1−k ⊗Ak.
(7.48)
Applying the spectral representation (7.1) and taking (4.47) and (7.12) into
account we further obtain (see also [18], [48])
g (A) ,A =

(7.43) yields
g (A) ,A =

7 Analytic Tensor Functions
Finally, let us focus on the diﬀerentiability of eigenprojections. To this end,
we represent them by [24] (Exercise 7.4)
Pi =
1
2πi
7
Γi
(ζI −A)−1 dζ,
i = 1, 2, . . . s,
(7.54)
where the integral is taken on the complex plane over a closed curve Γi the
interior of which includes only the eigenvalue λi. All other eigenvalues of A lie
outside Γi. Γi does not depend on λi as far as this eigenvalue is simple and does
not lie directly on Γi. Indeed, if λi is multiple, a perturbation of A by A+tX
can lead to a split of eigenvalues within Γi. In this case, (7.54) yields a sum of
eigenprojections corresponding to these split eigenvalues which coalesce in λi
for t = 0. Thus, the eigenprojection Pi corresponding to a simple eigenvalue
λi is diﬀerentiable according to (7.54). Direct diﬀerentiation of (7.54) delivers
in this case
Pi,A =
1
2πi
7
Γi
(ζI −A)−1 ⊗(ζI −A)−1 dζ,
ri = 1.
(7.55)
By analogy with (7.38) we thus obtain
Pi,A =
n−1
	
p,q=0
υipqAp ⊗Aq,
(7.56)
where
υipq = υiqp =
1
2πi
7
Γi
αp (ζ) αq (ζ) dζ,
p, q = 0, 1, . . . , n −1.
(7.57)
By the residue theorem we further write
υipq = lim
ζ→λi
! d
dζ

αp (ζ) αq (ζ) (ζ −λi)2$
,
p, q = 0, 1, . . . , n −1. (7.58)
With the aid of (7.49) one can obtain an alternative representation for the
derivative of the eigenprojections in terms of the eigenprojections themselves.
Indeed, substituting the function g in (7.49) by pi and taking the properties
of the latter function (4.50) and (7.45) into account we have
Pi,A =
s
	
j=1
j̸=i
Pi ⊗Pj + Pj ⊗Pi
λi −λj
.
(7.59)
7.4 Special case: Three-Dimensional Space
First, we specify the closed-form solutions (7.31) and (7.38) for three-dimen-
sional space (n = 3). In this case, the functions αk (ζ) (k = 0, 1, 2) (7.30) take
the form

7.4 Special case: Three-Dimensional Space
151
α0 (ζ) = ζ2 −ζIζI−A + IIζI−A

(7.60)
Inserting these expressions into (7.35) and (7.40) and considering separately
cases of distinct and repeated eigenvalues, we obtain the following result [22].

where superposed Roman numerals denote the order of the derivative.
Example. To illustrate the application of the above closed-form solution
we consider the exponential function of the velocity gradient under simple
shear. The velocity gradient is deﬁned as the material time derivative of the
deformation gradient by L = ˙F. Using the representation of F in the case of
simple shear (4.23) we can write
L = Li

where


⎡
⎣

(7.68)
We observe that L has a triple (r1 = 3) zero eigenvalue
λ1 = λ2 = λ3 = λ = 0.
(7.69)
This eigenvalue is, however, defect since it is associated with only two (t1 = 2)
linearly independent (right) eigenvectors
a1 = e1,
a2 = e3.
(7.70)
Therefore, L (7.68) is not diagonalizable and admits no spectral decomposition
in the form (7.1). For this reason, isotropic functions of L as well as their
derivative cannot be obtained on the basis of eigenprojections. Instead, we
exploit the closed-form solution (7.31), (7.38) with the coeﬃcients calculated
for the case of triple coalescence of eigenvalues by (7.66) and (7.67). Thus, we
can write

For diagonalizable tensor functions the representations (7.31) and (7.38)
can be simpliﬁed in the cases of repeated eigenvalues where the coeﬃcients
ϕp and ηpq are given by (7.64-7.67). To this end, we use the identities
A2 = (λi + λ) A −λiλI for the case of double coalescence of eigenvalues
(λi ̸= λj = λk = λ) and A = λI, A2 = λ2I for the case of triple coalescence
of eigenvalues (λ1 = λ2 = λ3 = λ). Thus, we obtain the following result well-
known for symmetric isotropic tensor functions [7].

Finally, we specify the representations for eigenprojections (7.43) and their

ρip (7.46) and υipq (7.58) can be obtained from the representations for ϕp

7.5 Recurrent Calculation of Tensor Power Series and
Their Derivatives
In numerical calculations with a limited number of digits the above presented
closed-form solutions especially those ones for the derivative of analytic tensor
functions can lead to inexact results if at least two eigenvalues of the tensor
argument are close to each other but do not coincide (see [19]). In this case,
a numerical calculation of the derivative of an analytic tensor function on
the basis of the corresponding power series expansion might be advantageous
provided this series converges very fast so that only a relatively small number
of terms are suﬃcient in order to ensure a desired precision. This numerical
calculation can be carried out by means of a recurrent procedure presented
below.
The recurrent procedure is based on the sequential application of the
Cayley-Hamilton equation (4.91). Accordingly, we can write for an arbitrary
second-order tensor A ∈Linn
An =
n−1
	
k=0
(−1)n−k+1 I(n−k)
A
Ak.
(7.86)
With the aid of this relation any non-negative integer power of A can be
represented by
Ar =
n−1
	
k=0
ω(r)
k Ak,
r = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(7.87)
Indeed, for r ≤n one obtains directly from (7.86)

ω(n)
k

A
,
r, k = 0, 1, . . ., n −1.
(7.88)
Further powers of A can be expressed by composing (7.87) with A and rep-
resenting An by (7.86) as
Ar+1 =
n−1

With the aid of representation (7.87) the inﬁnite power series (7.9) can thus
be expressed by (7.31)

Thus, the inﬁnite power series (7.9) with the coeﬃcients (7.13) results in
the same representation as the corresponding analytic tensor function (7.15)
provided the inﬁnite series (7.91) converges.
Further, inserting (7.87) into (7.48) we obtain again the representation

recurrent formulas (7.88), (7.89) and (7.97). The results of the calculation are
summarized in Table 7.1.
Considering these results in (7.90), (7.91), (7.92) and (7.96) we obtain the
representations (7.73) and (7.74). Note that the recurrent procedure delivers
an exact result only in some special cases like this where the argument tensor
is characterized by the property (7.75).

Applications to Continuum Mechanics
8.1 Polar Decomposition of the Deformation Gradient
The deformation gradient F represents an invertible second-order tensor gen-
erally permitting a unique polar decomposition by
F = RU = vR,
(8.1)
where R is an orthogonal tensor while U and v are symmetric tensors. In
continuum mechanics, R is called rotation tensor while U and v are referred to
as the right and left stretch tensor, respectively. The latter ones have already
been introduced in Sect. 7.1 in the context of generalized strain measures.
In order to show that the polar decomposition (8.1) always exists and
is unique we ﬁrst consider the so-called right and left Cauchy-Green tensors
respectively by
C = FTF,
b = FFT.
(8.2)
These tensors are symmetric and have principal traces in common. Indeed, in
view of (1.144)
tr

.
(8.3)
For this reason, all scalar-valued isotropic functions of C and b such as prin-
cipal invariants or eigenvalues coincide. Thus, we can write
C =
s
	
i=1
ΛiPi,
b =
s
	
i=1
Λipi,
(8.4)
where eigenvalues Λi are positive. Indeed, let ai be a unit eigenvector asso-
ciated with the eigenvalue Λi. Then, in view of (1.73), (1.99), (1.110) and by
Theorem 1.8 one can write

162
8 Applications to Continuum Mechanics
Λi = ai · (Λiai) = ai · (Cai) = ai ·

FTFai

=

aiFT
· (Fai) = (Fai) · (Fai) > 0.
Thus, square roots of C and b are unique tensors deﬁned by
U =

C =

i=1

ΛiPi,
v =

b =
s

Λipi.
(8.5)
Further, one can show that
R = FU−1
(8.6)
represents an orthogonal tensor. Indeed,
RRT = FU−1U−1FT = FU−2FT = FC−1FT
= F

FTF
−1 FT = FF−1F−TFT = I.
Thus, we can write taking (8.6) into account
F = RU =

RURT
R.
(8.7)
The tensor
RURT = FRT
(8.8)
in (8.7) is symmetric due to symmetry of U (8.5)1. Thus, one can write

RURT2
=

RURT 
RURTT
=

FRT 
FRTT
= FRTRFT = FFT = b.
(8.9)
In view of (8.5)2 there exists only one real symmetric tensor whose square is
b. Hence,
RURT = v,
(8.10)
which by virtue of (8.7) results in the polar decomposition (8.1).
8.2 Basis-Free Representations for the Stretch and
Rotation Tensor
With the aid of the closed-form representations for analytic tensor functions
discussed in Chap. 7 the stretch and rotation tensors can be expressed directly
in terms of the deformation gradient and Cauchy-Green tensors without any
reference to their eigenprojections. First, we deal with the stretch tensors

8.2 Basis-Free Representations for the Stretch and Rotation Tensor
163
(8.5). Inserting in (7.61) g (Λi) = √Λi = λi and keeping in mind (7.31) we
write
U = ϕ0I + ϕ1C + ϕ2C2,
v = ϕ0I + ϕ1b + ϕ2b2,
(8.11)
where [44]
ϕ0 =
λ1λ2λ3 (λ1 + λ2 + λ3)
(λ1 + λ2) (λ2 + λ3) (λ3 + λ1),
ϕ1 = λ2
1 + λ2
2 + λ2
3 + λ1λ2 + λ2λ3 + λ3λ1
(λ1 + λ2) (λ2 + λ3) (λ3 + λ1)
,
ϕ2 = −
1
(λ1 + λ2) (λ2 + λ3) (λ3 + λ1).
(8.12)
These representations for ϕi are free of singularities and are therefore generally
valid for the case of simple as well as repeated eigenvalues of C and b.
The rotation tensor results from (8.6) where we can again write
U−1 = ς0I + ς1C + ς2C2.
(8.13)
The representations for ςp (p = 0, 1, 2) can be obtained either again by (7.61)
where g (Λi) = Λ−1/2
i
= λ−1
i
or by applying the Cayley-Hamilton equation
(4.91) leading to
U−1 = III−1

(8.14)
where
IU = λ1 + λ2 + λ3,
IIU = λ1λ2 + λ2λ3 + λ3λ1,
IIIU = λ1λ2λ3. (8.15)
Both procedures yield the same representation (8.13) where
ς0 = λ1λ2 + λ2λ3 + λ3λ1
λ1λ2λ3

(λ1 + λ2 + λ3)2
(λ1 + λ2) (λ2 + λ3) (λ3 + λ1),

,
ς2 =
λ1 + λ2 + λ3
λ1λ2λ3 (λ1 + λ2) (λ2 + λ3) (λ3 + λ1).
(8.16)
Thus, the rotation tensor (8.6) can be given by
R = F

ς0I + ς1C + ς2C2
,
(8.17)
where the functions ςi (i = 0, 1, 2) are given by (8.16) in terms of the principal
stretches λi =
√
Λi, while Λi (i = 1, 2, 3) denote the eigenvalues of the right
Cauchy-Green tensor C (8.2).

8.3 The Derivative of the Stretch and Rotation Tensor
with Respect to the Deformation Gradient
In continuum mechanics these derivatives are used for the evaluation of the
rate of the stretch and rotation tensor. We begin with a very simple represen-
tation in terms of eigenprojections of the right and left Cauchy-Green tensors
(8.2). Applying the chain rule of diﬀerentiation and using (6.125) we ﬁrst write
U,F = C1/2,C : C,F = C1/2,C :

(I ⊗F)t + FT ⊗I

.
(8.27)
Further, taking into account the spectral representation of C (8.4)1 and keep-
ing its symmetry in mind we obtain by virtue of (7.49-7.50)
C1/2,C =
s
	
i,j=1
(λi + λj)−1 (Pi ⊗Pj)s .
(8.28)
Inserting this result into (8.27) delivers by means of (5.33), (5.47), (5.54)2 and
(5.55)
U,F =
s
	
i,j=1
(λi + λj)−1 
(Pi ⊗FPj)t + PiFT ⊗Pj

.
(8.29)
The same procedure applied to the left stretch tensor yields by virtue of
(6.126)

166

v,F =
s
	
i,j=1
(λi + λj)−1 
pi ⊗FTpj + (piF ⊗pj)t
.
(8.30)
Now, applying the product rule of diﬀerentiation (6.123) to (8.6) and taking
(6.122) into account we write
R,F =

FU−1
,F = I ⊗U−1 + FU−1,U : U,F
= I ⊗U−1 −F

U−1 ⊗U−1s : U,F .
(8.31)
With the aid of (7.2) and (8.29) this ﬁnally leads to
R,F = I ⊗

s
	
i,j=1
[(λi + λj) λiλj]−1 
(Pi ⊗FPj)t + PiFT ⊗Pj

.
(8.32)
Note that the eigenprojections Pi and pi (i = 1, 2, . . ., s) are uniquely deﬁned
by the Sylvester formula (4.54) or its alternative form (7.43) in terms of C and
b, respectively. The functions ρip appearing in (7.43) are, in turn, expressed
in the unique form by (7.81), (7.83) and (7.85) in terms of the eigenvalues
Λi = λ2
i (i = 1, 2, . . ., s).
In order to avoid the direct reference to the eigenprojections one can obtain
the so-called basis-free solutions for U,F, v,F and R,F (see, e.g., [8], [13],
[17], [37], [46], [48]). As a rule, they are given in terms of the stretch and
rotation tensors themselves and require therefore either the explicit polar
decomposition of the deformation gradient or a closed-form representation for
U, v and R like (8.11) and (8.17). In the following we present the basis-free
solutions for U,F, v,F and R,F in terms of the Cauchy-Green tensors C and
b (8.2) and the principal stretches λi =
√
Λi (i = 1, 2, . . ., s). To this end, we
apply the representation (7.38) for the derivative of the square root. Thus, we
obtain instead of (8.28)
C1/2,C =
2
	
p,q=0
ηpq (Cp ⊗Cq)s ,
b1/2,b =
2
	
p,q=0
ηpq (bp ⊗bq)s ,
(8.33)
where the functions ηpq result from (7.62) by setting again g (Λi) = √Λi = λi.
This leads to the following expressions (cf. [17])

(8.38)
where ςp and ηpq (p, q = 0, 1, 2) are given by (8.16) and (8.34), respectively.
The third and fourth powers of C in (8.38) can be expressed by means of the
Cayley-Hamilton equation (4.91):
C3 −ICC2 + IICC −IIICI = 0.
(8.39)
Composing both sides with C we can also write
C4 −ICC3 + IICC2 −IIICC = 0.
(8.40)
Thus,
C3 = ICC2 −IICC + IIICI,

8.4 Time Rate of Generalized Strains
Applying the chain rule of diﬀerentiation we ﬁrst write
˙E = E,C : ˙C,
(8.48)
where the superposed dot denotes the material time derivative. The derivative
E,C can be expressed in a simple form in terms of the eigenprojections of E
and C. To this end, we apply (7.49-7.50) taking (7.18) and (8.5) into account
which yields
E,C =

A basis-free representation for E,C can be obtained either from (8.49) by

directly by using the closed-form solution (7.38) with (7.62), (7.78) and (7.80).

8.5 Stress Conjugate to a Generalized Strain
Let E be an arbitrary Lagrangian strain (7.6)1. Assume existence of the so-
called strain energy function ψ (E) diﬀerentiable with respect to E. The sym-
metric tensor
T = ψ (E) ,E
(8.56)
is referred to as stress conjugate to E. With the aid of the chain rule it can
be represented by
T = ψ (E) ,C : C,E = 1
2S : C,E ,
(8.57)
where S = 2ψ (E) ,C denotes the second Piola-Kirchhoﬀstress tensor. The
latter one is deﬁned in terms of the Cauchy stress σ by (see, e.g., [45])
S = det (F) F−1σF−T.
(8.58)
Using (8.56) and (7.7) one can also write
˙ψ = T : ˙E = S : 1
2
˙C = S : ˙E(2).
(8.59)
The fourth-order tensor C,E appearing in (8.57) can be expressed in terms of
the right Cauchy-Green tensor C by means of the relation
Is = E,E = E,C : C,E ,
(8.60)
where the derivative E,C is given by (8.49-8.50). The basis tensors of the latter
representation are
Pij =

(Pi ⊗Pi)s
if i = j,
(Pi ⊗Pj + Pj ⊗Pi)s
if i ̸= j.
(8.61)
In view of (4.44), (5.33) and (5.55) they are pairwise orthogonal (see Exercise
8.2) such that (cf. [47])
Pij : Pkl =

Pij
if i = k and j = l or i = l and j = k,
O
otherwise.
(8.62)

8.6 Finite Plasticity Based on the Additive
Decomposition of Generalized Strains
Keeping in mind the above results regarding generalized strains we are con-
cerned in this section with a thermodynamically based plasticity theory. The
basic kinematic assumption of this theory is the additive decomposition of
generalized strains (7.6) into an elastic part Ee and a plastic part Ep as
E = Ee + Ep.
(8.70)
The derivation of evolution equations for the plastic strain is based on the
second law of thermodynamics and the principle of maximum plastic dissipa-
tion. The second law of thermodynamics can be written in the Clausius-Planck
form as (see, e.g. [45])
D = T : ˙E −˙ψ ≥0,
(8.71)
where D denotes the dissipation and T is again the stress tensor work conju-
gate to E. Inserting (8.70) into (8.71) we further write
D =
%
T −∂ψ
∂Ee
&
: ˙Ee + T : ˙Ep ≥0,
(8.72)
where the strain energy is assumed to be a function of the elastic strain as
ψ = ˆψ (Ee). The ﬁrst term in the expression of the dissipation (8.72) depends
solely on the elastic strain rate ˙Ee, while the second one on the plastic strain

174
8 Applications to Continuum Mechanics
rate ˙Ep. Since the elastic and plastic strain rates are independent of each other
the dissipation inequality (8.72) requires that
T = ∂ψ
∂Ee
.
(8.73)
This leads to the so-called reduced dissipation inequality
D = T : ˙Ep ≥0.
(8.74)
Among all admissible processes the real one maximizes the dissipation (8.74).
This statement is based on the postulate of maximum plastic dissipation (see,
e.g., [28]). According to the converse Kuhn-Tucker theorem (see, e.g., [6]) the
suﬃcient conditions of this maximum are written as
˙Ep = ˙ζ ∂Φ
∂T,
˙ζ ≥0,
˙ζΦ = 0,
Φ ≤0,
(8.75)
where Φ represents a convex yield function and ˙ζ denotes a consistency pa-
rameter. In the following, we will deal with an ideal-plastic isotropic material
described by a von Mises-type yield criterion. Written in terms of the stress
tensor T the von Mises yield function takes the form [31]
Φ = ∥devT∥−
8
2
3σY ,
(8.76)
where σY denotes the normal yield stress. With the aid of (6.51) and (6.130)
the evolution equation (8.75)1 can thus be given by
˙Ep = ˙ζ ∥devT∥,T
= ˙ζ ∥devT∥,devT : devT,T = ˙ζ devT
∥devT∥: Pdev = ˙ζ devT
∥devT∥.
(8.77)
Taking the quadratic norm on both the right and left hand side of this identity
delivers the consistency parameter as ˙ζ = || ˙Ep||. In view of the yield condition
Φ = 0 we thus obtain
devT =
8
2
3σY
˙Ep
999 ˙Ep
999
,
(8.78)
which immediately requires that (see Exercise 1.46)
tr ˙Ep = 0.
(8.79)
In the following, we assume small elastic but large plastic strains and spec-
ify the above plasticity model for ﬁnite simple shear. In this case all three
principal stretches (8.21) are distinct so that we can write by virtue of (7.6)

3
	
i=1
f ′ (λi) ˙λiPi +
3
	
i=1
f (λi) ˙Pi.
(8.80)
By means of the identities trPi = 1 and tr ˙Pi = 0 following from (4.61) and
(4.62) where ri = 1 (i = 1, 2, 3) the condition (8.79) requires that
3
	
i=1
f ′ (λi) ˙λi = 0.
(8.81)
In view of (8.21) it leads to the equation
f ′ (λ) −f ′ 
λ−1
λ−2 = 0,
∀λ > 0,
(8.82)
where we set λ1 = λ and consequently λ2 = λ−1. Solutions of this equations
can be given by [21]
fa (λ) =
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪
⎩
1
2a (λa −λ−a)
for a ̸= 0,
ln λ
for a = 0.
(8.83)
By means of (7.6)1 or (7.18)1 the functions fa (8.83) yield a set of new gen-
eralized strain measures

for a = 0,
(8.84)
among which only the logarithmic one (a = 0) belongs to Seth’s family (7.7).
Henceforth, we will deal only with the generalized strains (8.84) as able to
provide the traceless deformation rate (8.79). For these strains eq. (8.78) takes
the form
devT⟨a⟩=
8

3σY
˙E⟨a⟩
999 ˙E⟨a⟩
999

(8.85)
where T⟨a⟩denotes the stress tensor work conjugate to E⟨a⟩. T⟨a⟩itself has
no physical meaning and should be transformed to the Cauchy stresses. With
the aid of (8.57), (8.58) and (8.60) we can write

fourth-order tensor is super-symmetric (see Exercise 5.11), so that T⟨a⟩: Pa =
Pa : T⟨a⟩. Thus, by virtue of (1.152) and (1.153) representation (8.86) can be
rewritten as

plasticity model considers neither softening nor hardening and is restricted to
small elastic strains a constant shear stress response even at large plastic
deformations is expected. It is also predicted by a plasticity model based on
the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient (see, e.g., [21]
for more details). The plasticity model based on the additive decomposition
of generalized strains exhibits, however, a non-constant shear stress for all
examined values of a. This restricts the applicability of this model to moderate
plastic shears. Indeed, in the vicinity of the point γ = 0 the power series

arithmic strain (a = 0) by γ4 ≪1 and for other generalized strain measures

∀x ∈V.
(e) If, on the contrary, α ̸= 0 and x ̸= 0, then according to (b), (B.1), (B.2):
0 = α−10 = α−1 (αx) = x.

1.5 (A.4), (C.2), (C.3), Ex. 1.1 (d):
0 · x = [x + (−x)] · x = [x + (−1) x] · x = x · x −x · x = 0.
1.6
Let on the contrary (m
i=1 αigi = 0, where not all αi (i = 1, 2, . . ., m)
are zero. Multiplying scalarly by gj we obtain: 0 = gj · ((m
i=1 αigi). Since
gi · gj = 0 for i ̸= j, we can write: αjgj · gj = 0 (j = 1, 2, . . ., m). The fact
that the vectors gj are non-zero leads in view of (C.4) to the conclusion that
αj = 0 (j = 1, 2, . . . , m) which contradicts the earlier assumption.
1.7 (1.6), (C.1), (C.2):
∥x + y∥2 = (x + y) · (x + y)
= x · x + x · y + y · x + y · y = ∥x∥2 + 2x · y + ∥y∥2 .
1.8
Since G = {g1, g2, . . . , gn} is a basis we can write a = aigi. Then,
a · a = ai (gi · a). Thus, if a · gi = 0 (i = 1, 2, . . ., n), then a · a = 0 and
according to (C.4) a = 0 (suﬃciency). Conversely, if a = 0, then (see Exercise
1.5) a · gi = 0 (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) (necessity).
1.9 Necessity. (C.2): a · x = b · x ⇒a · x −b · x = (a −b) · x = 0, ∀x ∈En.
Let x = a −b, then (a −b) · (a −b) = 0 and according to (C.4) a −b = 0.
This implies that a = b. The suﬃciency is evident.

1.13 In view of (1.33), (1.36) and (1.38) the left and right hand side of (1.39)
yield for the case

Solutions
i = j:
gi × gi = 0,
eiikggk = 0,
∃k such that ijk is an even permutation of 123:
gi × gj = [g1g2g3] gk,
eijlggl = [g1g2g3] gk,
∃k such that ijk is an odd permutation of 123:
gi × gj = −gj × gi = −[g1g2g3] gk,
eijlggl = −[g1g2g3] gk.
Using the result of the previous exercise one proves in the same manner (1.42).
1.14 (a) δijeijk = δ11e11k + δ12e12k + . . . + δ33e33k = 0.
(b) Writing out the term eikmejkm we ﬁrst obtain
eikmejkm = ei11ej11 + ei12ej12 + . . . + ei33ej33
= ei12ej12 + ei21ej21 + ei13ej13 + ei31ej31 + ei32ej32 + ei23ej23.
For i ̸= j each term in this sum is equal to zero. Let further i = j = 1.
Then we obtain ei12ej12 + ei21ej21 + ei13ej13 + ei31ej31 + ei32ej32 + ei23ej23 =
e132e132 + e123e123 = (−1) (−1) + 1 · 1 = 2. The same result also holds for the
cases i = j = 2 and i = j = 3. Thus, we can write eikmejkm = 2δi
j.
(c) By means of the previous result (b) we can write: eijkeijk = 2δi
i = 2(δ1
1 +
δ2
2 + δ3
3) = 6. This can also be shown directly by
eijkeijk = e123e123 + e132e132 + e213e213 + e231e231 + e312e312 + e321e321
= 1 · 1 + (−1) · (−1) + (−1) · (−1) + 1 · 1 + 1 · 1 + (−1) · (−1) = 6.
(d) eijmeklm = eij1ekl1 + eij2ekl2 + eij3ekl3. It is seen that in the case i = j
or k = l this sum as well as the right hand side δi
kδj
l −δi
lδj
k are both zero. Let
further i ̸= j. Then, only one term in the above sum is non-zero if k = i and
l = j or vice versa l = i and k = j. In the ﬁrst case the left hand side is 1 and
in the last case −1. The same holds also for the right side δi
kδj
l −δi
lδj
k. Indeed,
we obtain for k = i ̸= l = j: δi

k = 1 · 1 −0 = 1 and for l = i ̸= k = j:
δi

k = 0 −1 · 1 = −1.

1.16 (A.2-A.4), (1.48):
0 = Ax + (−Ax) = A (x + 0) + (−Ax) = Ax + A0 + (−Ax) = A0.
1.17 (1.49), Exercises 1.1(c), 1.16: (0A) x = A (0x) = A0 = 0, ∀x ∈En.
1.18 (1.61), Ex. 1.17: A + (−A) = A + (−1) A = (1 −1) A = 0A = 0.
1.19 Indeed, a scalar product of the right-hand side of (1.80) with an arbitrary
vector x yields [(y · a) b]·x = (y · a) (b · x). The same result follows also from
y · [(a ⊗b) x] = (y · a) (b · x) , ∀x, y ∈En for the left-hand side. This implies
that the identity (1.80) is true (see Exercise 1.9).
1.20 For (1.83)1 we have for example
giAgj = gi 

gj = Akl

and (1.75)
Wx = w × x =

wigi

×

xjgj

= eijkgwixjgk = eijkgwi 
x · gj

Comparing the left and right hand side of this equality we obtain
W = eijkgwigk ⊗gj,
(S.1)
so that the components of W = Wkjgk ⊗gj can be given by Wkj = eijkgwi
or in the matrix form as
[Wkj] = g

It is seen that the tensor W is skew-symmetric because WT = −W.
1.22 According to (1.71) we can write
R = cos αI + sin αˆe3 + (1 −cos α) (e3 ⊗e3) .
Thus, an arbitrary vector a = aiei in E3 is rotated to Ra = cos α

Thus, A commutes with B while B also commutes with D.
1.26 Taking into account commutativeness of A and B we obtain for example
for k = 2
(A + B)2 = (A + B) (A + B) = A2 + AB+ BA+ B2 = A2 + 2AB+ B2.
Generalizing this result for k = 2, 3, . . . we obtain using the Newton formula

2.2 The connection between the linear and spherical coordinates (2.144) can
be expressed by
x1 = r sin ϕ sin φ,

∂x1
∂φ = r sin ϕ cos φ,
∂x1
∂r = sin ϕ sin φ,
∂x2
∂ϕ = 0,

With the aid of the identities

,l ·gl = 0 (j = 1, 2, 3) following from

keeping (1.36), (2.68) and (2.84)2 in mind.
2.8 We begin with the covariant derivative of the Cauchy stress components

r2 + 2σ12 s2
r3 ,
σ3j|j= σ31,r +σ32,s +σ33,z .
The balance equations (2.107) become

Exercises of Chapter 3
3.1 (C.4), (3.18): a1 = dr/ds = const. Hence, r (s) = b + sa1.
3.2 Using the fact that d/d (−s) = −d/ds we can write by means of (3.15),
(3.18), (3.20), (3.21) and (3.27): a′
1 (s) = −a1 (s), a′
2 (s) = a2 (s), a′
3 (s) =
−a3 (s), κ′ (s) = κ (s) and τ′ (s) = τ (s).
3.3 Let us show that the curve r (s) with the zero torsion τ (s) ≡0 belongs to
the plane p

t1, t2
= r (s0) + t1a1 (s0) + t2a2 (s0), where a1 (s0) and a2 (s0)
are, respectively, the unit tangent vector and the principal normal vector at
a point s0. For any arbitrary point we can write using (3.15)
r (s) = r (s0) +
r(s)
'
r(s0)
dr = r (s0) +
s

s0
a1 (s) ds.
(S.11)
The vector a1 (s) can further be represented with respect to the trihedron at s0
as a1 (s) = αi (s) ai (s0). Taking (3.26) into account we observe that a3,s = 0
and consequently a3 (s) ≡a3 (s0). In view of (3.23)2 it yields a1 (s)·a3 (s0) =
0, so that a1 (s) = α1 (s) a1 (s0) + α2 (s) a2 (s0). Inserting this result into
(S.11) we have
r (s) = r (s0) + a1 (s0)

of exp A. On use of (4.24) and (4.26) we can thus write: det [exp (A)] =
n;
i=1
exp λi = exp
% n(

= exp (trA).

In a similar way, one veriﬁes the Sylvester formula also for i = 2 and i = 3.

IIIA = 54.

Solutions
207
Multiplying the ﬁrst equation by two and subtracting from the second one
we get a2 = 2a1 and consequently a3 = 2a1. Additionally we require that the
eigenvectors have unit length so that

Further, setting in the equation system (S.18) λ = −3 we obtain only one
independent linear equation
a1 + 2a2 + 2a3 = 0
(S.20)
with respect to the components of the eigenvectors corresponding to this dou-
ble eigenvalue. One of these eigenvectors can be obtained by setting for ex-
ample a1 = 0. In this case, a2 = −a3 and in view of (S.19)

Requiring that the eigenvectors a(1)

4.11
Since linearly independent vectors are non-zero it follows from (4.9)
that ci · ci ̸= 0 (i = 1, 2, . . ., m). Thus, the ﬁrst vector can be given by
a1 =
c1
√c1 · c1
,
such that a1 · a1 = 1. Next, we set
a′
2 = c2 −(c2 · a1) a1,
so that a′
2 · a1 = 0. Further, a′
2 ̸= 0 because otherwise c2 = (c2 · a1) a1 =
(c2 · a1) (c1 · c1)−1/2 c1 which implies a linear dependence between c1 and c2.
Thus, we can set a2 = a′
2/

a′
2 · a′
2. The third vector can be given by
a3 =
a′
3

a′
3 · a′
3
,
where
a′
3 = c3 −(c3 · a2) a2 −(c3 · a1) a1,
so that a3 · a1 = a3 · a2 = 0. Repeating this procedure we ﬁnally obtain the
set of vectors ai satisfying the condition ai · aj = δij, (i, j = 1, 2, . . ., m). One
can easily show that these vectors are linearly independent. Indeed, otherwise
(m
i=1 αiai = 0, where not all αi are zero. Multiplying this vector equation
scalarly by aj (j = 1, 2, . . . , m) yields, however, αj = 0 (j = 1, 2, . . . , m).
4.12
Comparing (4.63)1 with (4.71)1 we infer that the right eigenvectors
a(k)
i
(k = 1, 2, . . ., ti) associated with a complex eigenvalue λi are simulta-
neously the left eigenvalues associated with λi. Since λi ̸= λi Theorem 4.3
implies that a(k)
i

i
= 0 (k, l = 1, 2, . . ., ti).
4.13 Taking into account the identities trWk = 0, where k = 1, 3, 5, . . . (see

(S.21)
Setting ﬁrst λ = 1 we obtain a homogeneous equation system
a1 (cos α −1) −a2 sin α = 0,
a1 sin α + a2 (cos α −1) = 0,
leading to a1 = a2 = 0. Thus, a1 = a3e3, where a3 can be an arbitrary real
number. The unit length condition requires further that
a1 = e3.
Next, inserting λ = cos α ± i sin α into (S.21) yields
a2 = ∓ia1,
a3 = 0.
Thus, the right eigenvectors associated with the complex conjugate eigenvalues
λ2/3 are of the form a2/3 = a1 (e1 ∓ie2). Bearing in mind that any rotation
tensor is orthogonal we infer that a2/3 = a3/2 = a1 (e1 ± ie2) are the left
eigenvectors associated with λ2/3. Imposing the additional condition a2 ·a2 =
a2 · a3 = 1 (4.38) we ﬁnally obtain
a2 =

Exercises of Chapter 5
5.1 By using (1.101)1, (D.2) and (5.17) one can verify for example (5.20)1
and (5.21)1 within the following steps
A⊗(B + C) : X = AX (B + C) = AXB+AXC = (A ⊗B + A ⊗C) : X,
A ⊙(B + C) : X = A [(B + C) : X] = A (B : X + C : X)
= A (B : X) + A (C : X)
= (A ⊙B + A ⊙C) : X,
∀X ∈Linn.
The proof of (5.20)2 and (5.21)2 is similar.
5.2 With the aid of (5.16), (5.17) and (1.138) we can write
(Y : A ⊗B) : X = Y : (A ⊗B : X) = Y : AXB = ATYBT : X,

5.3 Using the deﬁnition of the simple composition (5.40) and taking (5.17)
into account we obtain

A (B ⊙C) D : X = A (B ⊙C : X) D = A [B (C : X)] D

∀X ∈Linn.

respectively.
5.5 Using (5.51) and (5.52) we obtain for the left and right hand sides diﬀerent
results:
(a ⊗b ⊗c ⊗d)tT = (a ⊗c ⊗b ⊗d)T = c ⊗a ⊗d ⊗b,

Ct =

t = Cijklgi ⊗gk ⊗gj ⊗gl

According to (5.60) and (5.61) CT = Ct = C. Taking also into account that
the tensors gi ⊗gj ⊗gk ⊗gl (i, j, k, l = 1, 2, . . . , n) are linearly independent
we thus write
Cijkl = Cjilk = Cikjl.
The remaining relations (5.70) are obtained in the same manner by applying
the identities C = CTtT and C = CtTt.
5.9 With the aid of (1.140), (5.16) and (5.79) we get
(Y : T) : X = Y : (T : X) = Y : XT = YT : X,
∀X, Y ∈Linn.
5.10 On use of (5.31), (5.45)2 and (5.79) we obtain

(T : T) : X = T : (T : X) = T : XT = X = T : X,
∀X ∈Linn.
5.11 C possesses the minor symmetry (5.61) by the very deﬁnition. In order
to prove the major symmetry (5.60) we show that C : X = X : C, ∀X ∈Linn.
Indeed, in view of (5.17)1, (5.22)1 and (5.48)
C : X = (M1 ⊗M2 + M2 ⊗M1)s : X = (M1 ⊗M2 + M2 ⊗M1) : symX
= M1 (symX) M2 + M2 (symX) M1,
X : C = X : (M1 ⊗M2 + M2 ⊗M1)s

= sym (M1XM2 + M2XM1) = M1 (symX) M2 + M2 (symX) M1.

(c) For the super-symmetric counterpart of the deviatoric projection tensor

Thus, the eigenvalues of Ps
dev are Λ1 = 0, Λq = 1 (q = 2, 3, . . . , 6). The cor-
responding eigentensors are again given by (S.23).
(d) With respect to the orthonormal basis (S.22) the elasticity tensor (5.91)

The eigentensors of C are the same as of Psph and Ps
dev and are given by (S.23).
The eigenvalues are as follows: Λ1 = 2G+3λ, Λq = 2G (q = 2, 3, . . . , 6). They
can be obtained as linear combinations of those ones of Psph and Ps

(b) Since the components of A are related to an orthonormal basis we can
write
f (A) = A11 + A22 + A33 = A1
·1 + A2
·2 + A3
·3 = Ai
·i = trA.
Trace of a tensor represents its isotropic function.
(c) For an isotropic tensor function the condition (6.1) f(QAQT) = f (A)
must hold on the whole deﬁnition domain of the arguments A and ∀Q ∈
Orth3. Let us consider a special case where
A =
⎡
⎣
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
⎤
⎦ei ⊗ej,
Q =
⎡
⎣
0 1 0
−1 0 0
0 0 1
⎤
⎦ei ⊗ej.
Thus,
A′ = QAQT =
⎡
⎣
0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0
⎤
⎦ei ⊗ej
and consequently
f (A) = A11 + A12 + A13 = 1 ̸= 0 = A′11 + A′12 + A′13 = f

QAQT
,
which means that the function f (A) is not isotropic.
(d) detA is the last principal invariant of A and represents thus its isotropic
tensor function. Isotropy of the determinant can, however, be shown directly
using the relation det (BC) = detBdetC. Indeed,
det

QAQT
= detQ detA detQT = detQ detQTdetA

QQT
detA = detI detA = detA,
∀Q ∈Orthn.
(e) Eigenvalues of a second-order tensor are uniquely deﬁned by its principal
invariants and represent thus its isotropic functions. This can also be shown
in a direct way considering the eigenvalue problem for the tensor QAQT as

QAQT
a = λa.
Mapping both sides of this vector equation by QT yields

QTQAQT
a = λQTa.
Using the abbreviation a′ = QTa we ﬁnally obtain
Aa′ = λa′.

216
Solutions
Thus, every eigenvalue of QAQT is the eigenvalue of A and vice versa. In
other words, the eigenvalues of these tensors are pairwise equal which imme-
diately implies that they are characterized by the same value of λmax. The
tensors obtained by the operation QAQT from the original one A are called
similar tensors.

Finally, trA4 should be expressed in terms of the principal traces trAi (i
= 1, 2, 3) presented in the functional basis (6.18). To this end, we apply the
Cayley-Hamilton equation (4.91). Its composition with A yields
A4 −IAA3 + IIAA2 −IIIAA = 0,
so that
trA4 = IAtrA3 −IIAtrA2 + IIIAtrA,
where IA, IIA and IIIA are given by (4.29). Thus, all the invariants of the
functional basis (6.17) are expressed in a unique form in terms of (6.18).

Using the relation

Li = I
(S.26)
one can further write
tr (C) = C : I = C : (L1 + L2 + L3)

In the same manner we also obtain

Thus, the invariants trC and trC2 are redundant and can be excluded from

Alternatively, a functional basis for the orthotropic material symmetry can be
obtained in the component form. To this end, we represent the right Cauchy-

Any orthotropic function S (C) is an isotropic function of C and

representation (6.29). Finally, considering (6.146) in the latter relation we
obtain the isotropic strain energy function of the form (6.99) as
ψ

˜E

= 1
2λtr2 ˜E + Gtr˜E2.
6.12 The tensor-valued function (6.103) can be shown to be isotropic. Indeed,
ˆg

QAiQT, QXjQT
= Q′′Tg

Q′′QAiQTQ′′T
Q′′,
∀Q ∈Orthn,
where Q′′ is deﬁned by (6.39). Further, we can write taking (6.41) into account
Q′′Tg

Q′′QAiQTQ′′T
Q′′ = Q′′Tg

Q∗Q′AiQ′TQ∗T
Q′′
= Q′′TQ∗g

Q′AiQ′T
Q∗TQ′′ = QQ′Tg

Q′AiQ′T
Q′QT
= Qˆg (Ai, Xj) QT,
which ﬁnally yields
ˆg

QAiQT, QXjQT
= Qˆg (Ai, Xj) QT,
∀Q ∈Orthn.
Thus, the suﬃciency is proved. The necessity is evident.

7.3 The proof of the ﬁrst relation (7.21) directly results from the deﬁnition
of the analytic tensor function (7.15) and is obvious. In order to prove (7.21)2
we ﬁrst write
f (A) =
1
2πi
7
Γ
f (ζ) (ζI −A)−1 dζ, h (A) =
1
2πi
7
Γ ′ h (ζ′) (ζ′I −A)−1 dζ′,
where the closed curve Γ ′ of the second integral lies outside Γ which, in turn,
includes all eigenvalues of A. Using the identity
(ζI −A)−1 (ζ′I −A)−1 = (ζ′ −ζ)−1 
(ζI −A)−1 −(ζ′I −A)−1
valid both on Γ and Γ ′ we thus obtain
f (A) h (A) =

Since the function f (ζ) (ζ −ζ′)−1 is analytic in ζ inside Γ the Cauchy theorem
(see, e.g. [5]) implies that

Γ
f (ζ)
ζ −ζ′ dζ = 0.
Noticing further that

we obtain

Γ
g (ζ) (ζI −A)−1 dζ = g (A) .
Finally, we focus on the third relation (7.21). It implies that the functions
h and f are analytic on domains containing all the eigenvalues λi of A and
h (λi) (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) of B = h (A), respectively. Hence (cf. [24]),
f (h (A)) = f (B) =
1
2πi
7
Γ
f (ζ) (ζI −B)−1 dζ,
(S.31)
where Γ encloses all the eigenvalues of B. Further, we write
(ζI −B)−1 = (ζI −h (A))−1 =
1
2πi
7
Γ ′ (ζ −h (ζ′))−1 (ζ′I −A)−1 dζ′,
(S.32)
where Γ ′ includes all the eigenvalues λi of A so that the image of Γ ′ under h
lies within Γ. Thus, inserting (S.32) into (S.31) delivers
f (h (A)) =

7.4 Inserting into the right hand side of (7.54) the spectral decomposition in

This immediately leads to (7.54).
7.5 By means of (7.43) and (7.83) and using the result for the eigenvalues of
A by (S.17), λi = 6, λ = −3 we write
P1 =

(λi −λ)A = 1

Taking symmetry of A into account we further obtain by virtue of (7.56) and
(7.84)
P1,A =

The eigenprojection P2 corresponds to the double eigenvalue λ = −3 and for
this reason is not diﬀerentiable.
7.6
Since A is a symmetric tensor and it is diagonalizable. Thus, taking
double coalescence of eigenvalues (S.17) into account we can apply the repre-
sentations (7.77) and (7.78). Setting there λa = 6, λ = −3 delivers
exp (A) = e6 + 2e−3

which coincides with the result obtained in Exercise 4.9.
7.7 The computation of the coeﬃcients series (7.89), (7.91) and (7.96), (7.97)
with the precision parameter ε = 1 · 10−6 has required 23 iteration steps and
has been carried out by using MAPLE-program. The results of the compu-
tation are summarized in Tables S.1 and S.2. On use of (7.90) and (7.92) we
thus obtain
exp (A) = 44.96925I + 29.89652A + 4.974456A2,
exp (A) ,A = 16.20582Is + 6.829754 (I ⊗A + A ⊗I)s + 1.967368 (A ⊗A)s

Taking into account double coalescence of eigenvalues of A we can further
write
A2 = (λa + λ) A −λaλI = 3A + 18I.
Inserting this relation into the above representations for exp (A) and exp (A) ,A
ﬁnally yields
exp (A) = 134.50946I + 44.81989A,
exp (A) ,A = 64.76737Is + 16.59809 (I ⊗A + A ⊗I)s + 3.87638 (A ⊗A)s .
Note that the relative error of this result in comparison to the closed-form
solution used in Exercise 7.6 lies within 0.044%.
