Introduction
S
o you’re going to Germany. Wunderbar! But what parts of 
Deutschland (Germany) do you want to visit? Because of this coun-
try’s many offerings, answering that question isn’t always easy. Germany 
isn’t a huge country — on a superfast train you can buzz from Berlin in 
the north to Munich in the south in about seven hours — but exciting 
cities and scenic sightseeing possibilities pack the terrain.
Situated in the very heart of Europe, Germany stretches from the Alps in 
the south to Denmark and the Baltic and North seas in the north. France 
bounds Germany to the southwest, with Luxembourg, Belgium, and the 
Netherlands to the west and the Czech Republic and Poland to the east.
Dramatic regional differences exist in the German landscape. The sunny 
southwest is where you find the Bodensee (Lake Constance), one of the 
largest lakes in Europe, and the forested hills of the scenic Schwarzwald 
(Black Forest). In the west, every crag in the Rhine Valley seems to have 
its own romantic legend — or carefully tended vineyard. Drive or take 
the train a couple of hours east and you’re in the Bavarian Alps, where 
the peaks are tipped with snow until May. In the far north, the location 
of the country’s great ports, you find a flat maritime landscape.
Regional differences also extend to food and architecture. The sober 
brick architecture that predominates in the far north gives way to exu-
berant baroque churches and palaces in the south. In the southwest, 
which shares a border with France, French cuisine is a major part of the 
dining scene. In the north, near Germany’s coastline, the emphasis is on 
fresh seafood. Every city or region has its own version of sausage and its 
favorite local wines and beers. Discovering the special regional differ-
ences within Germany will help to deepen your understanding and expe-
riences of the country.
So what cities, regions, or specific attractions do you want to see? Berlin, 
the exciting new capital of a reunified republic? Elegant, fun-loving Munich, 
the city where most Germans would live if they could? The great port 
city of Hamburg? The romantic university town of Heidelberg? Are there 
specific landscapes you want to see, such as the Bavarian Alps or the 
Rhine Valley? Did you know that one of the most beautiful scenic drives 
in Europe is along Germany’s aptly named Romantic Road? What castles 
and cathedrals would you like to visit? The fairy-tale castles built by 
King Ludwig of Bavaria are the most famous and popular attractions in 
Germany. The sheer size of Cologne Cathedral, the largest church north 
of the Alps, will dazzle your senses, too. And how about other historic 
sites? Do you want to visit Weimar, where Goethe lived, or Leipzig, 

Germany For Dummies, 4th Edition 
2
where Bach conducted? Do you want to stroll down Frankfurt’s Zeil, the 
busiest shopping street in Germany? Are you interested in seeing east-
ern Germany now that the border is open between east and west? The 
eastern city of Dresden, after all, is one of the great art cities of Europe.
Germany, as you can see, has an embarrassment of riches. In this book, I 
help you choose from among its many highlights to create the best trip 
for you. Together, you and Germany For Dummies can plan a wunder-
schöne Reise (wonderful journey).
About This Book
This is a selective guidebook to Germany. From an enormous list of pos-
sibilities, I chose only what I consider to be the best and most essential 
places for visitors. If you’re new to this part of the world, this guidebook 
is for you.
I exclude places that other, more exhaustive guidebooks routinely 
include. Germany has so much worth seeing that you don’t need to 
waste your time with the second rate, the overrated, or the boring. In 
this guide, I bypass places that are difficult to reach or are of interest 
only to scholars or specialists.
Use Germany For Dummies as a reference guide. You can, of course, start 
at the first page and read all the way through to the end. But, if you’ve 
already been to Germany and know the basics of international travel, 
you can flip to the specific part you need or home in on one specific 
chapter.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any 
time — and this is especially true of prices. Therefore, I suggest that you 
write or call ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans. The 
author, editors, and publisher cannot be held responsible for the experi-
ences of readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us, however, so 
we encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your surroundings. Keep a 
close eye on your camera, purse, and wallet, all favorite targets of thieves 
and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
I recently tried to extract some information from a guidebook and felt 
that I needed training in hieroglyphics to interpret all the different sym-
bols. I’m happy to report that the user-friendly Germany For Dummies is 
not like that. The use of symbols and abbreviations is kept to a minimum.
I include abbreviations for commonly accepted credit cards. Take a look 
at the following list for an explanation of each:

 Introduction 3
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
I also include some general pricing information to help you decide 
where to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. In addition to 
giving you exact prices, I employ a system of dollar signs ($) to show a 
range of costs for one night in a hotel (double room, year-round) or a 
meal at a restaurant (appetizer, entree, and dessert). Check out the fol-
lowing table to decipher the dollar signs:
Cost 
Hotel 
Restaurant
$ 
$150 or less 
$20 or less
$$ 
$151 to $200 
$21 to $35
$$$ 
$201 to $250 
$36 to $45
$$$$ 
$251 or more 
$46 or more
Prices in this guide for hotels, restaurants, attractions, and services are 
given in euros (€), the currency that replaced the Deutsche Mark in 
2002, and then converted into dollars. The exchange rate used through-
out is 1€ = $1.35.
I first give the name of a sight in German, followed by an English transla-
tion. If the word is one that you might use, I also provide a phonetic 
pronunciation.
Foolish Assumptions
I make some assumptions about you, lieber Leser (dear reader), 
including:
 
✓ You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to 
explore Germany and wants expert advice when you finally do get a 
chance to enjoy the place.
 
✓ You may be an inexperienced traveler (but you’re definitely not a 
Dummkopf) who is looking for guidance when determining whether 
to take a trip to Germany and how to plan for it.
 
✓ You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information 
available about Germany or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or 
attraction. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses on the 
places that will give you the best or most unique experience in 
Germany.

Germany For Dummies, 4th Edition

If you fit any of these criteria, then Germany For Dummies gives you the 
information you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
The book is broken down into five parts. The first two parts deal with 
trip planning and organization; they provide information, advice, and 
suggestions that can help you map out a wonderful holiday. The next 
two parts of the book are devoted to the major sights and cities within 
northern and eastern Germany and western and southern Germany, 
respectively. All the parts can be read independently, so if you want 
to zero in on a specific city or area — Munich, say, or the Romantic 
Road — you can turn right to that part.
Part I: Introducing Germany
This first part introduces Germany and gives you some excellent rea-
sons for going there. This overview gives you the big picture. The indi-
vidual chapters help you decide when to visit and what to see. I help you 
to understand and deepen your knowledge of the culture; tell you about 
German food, wine, and beer; provide a calendar of events; and present 
you with some possible itineraries.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany
This part helps take some of the wrinkles out of the trip-planning stage. 
I talk about handling money and give you some sound advice on plan-
ning a realistic budget; lay out your options for airlines and how to get 
the best airfares and book money-saving package tours; and explain the 
kinds of guided tours that are available. This part helps you to decide 
what form of transportation (train, rental car) to use to get around the 
country and explains what kind of accommodations you can expect for 
your money. I provide special tips for Germany-bound travelers who 
may have special needs or interests: families, seniors, travelers with dis-
abilities, and gay and lesbian travelers. I also deal with pretrip loose 
ends, from passports to buying medical insurance.
Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany
All you need to know about Berlin, Germany’s capital and most exciting 
city, is contained in this part. Along with providing a basic orientation, I 
point out the best hotels and restaurants and the top attractions to the 
east and west and all around this remarkable city, including the palace 
of Sanssouci in Potsdam. Northern Germany, bordering on the Baltic and 
North seas, is also where you find Hamburg, Germany’s largest port 
city. I hit the Hamburg highlights, from the mighty harbor to the lurid 
Reeperbahn (where uncoverage may better describe the sights). Then I 
tell you about side-trip options from Hamburg: Lübeck, a picturesque 
city of Gothic church spires and ancient brick buildings, and Bremen, a 
bustling city that offers an array of historic sights.

 Introduction 5
In this part, I also cover the great eastern German cities of Dresden, 
Leipzig, and Weimar. Difficult to visit during the Communist years, 
these remarkable showcases of art and culture are now open for busi-
ness. I tell you how to take a boat trip from Dresden into a scenic region 
called Saxon Switzerland. I also include a description of the memorial at 
Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar and an overview of tour-
ing options in the Thuringian Forest.
Part IV: Southern and Western Germany
Munich, Germany’s “secret capital” and most popular big city, gets a big 
chapter of its own. I provide information on how to get there, how to get 
around, and what to see, plus a selection of great hotels and special res-
taurants. I also include an easy trip to Nymphenburg Palace and the 
moving memorial at Dachau. The next chapter goes beyond Munich but 
stays in Bavaria. Here, I describe the principal cities and attractions 
found along the Romantic Road, a scenic driving tour that begins in 
Würzburg and ends at Neuschwanstein, King Ludwig of Bavaria’s fairy-
tale castle in the Bavarian Alps. I also introduce you to the Bavarian 
towns of Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Oberammergau, with an addi-
tional side trip to Linderhof, another castle fantasy of King Ludwig.
Staying south but moving west, I cover three important cities in south-
western Germany: Heidelberg, with the oldest university in Germany 
and the brooding ruins of a mighty castle; Stuttgart, the region’s cultural 
capital; and Nuremberg (Nürnberg), one of Germany’s most attractive 
cities. From the southwest I head farther north, to the lively Rhine-side 
city of Cologne (Köln), with its world-famous cathedral and array of 
first-class museums. Side-trip options from Cologne include boat rides 
down the mighty Rhine, with its castles and vineyards, and down the 
equally picturesque Mosel River, one of Germany’s principal winegrow-
ing areas. Frankfurt, with the busiest international airport in Germany, 
gets a chapter of its own. You find plenty to see and enjoy in “Mainhattan,” 
as Frankfurt is known, from designer skyscrapers and great museums to 
distinctive apple-wine taverns.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens enables me to focus a little more attention on extra-special 
places, topics, and sights I want you to know about. My “tens” include ten 
lessons on the German language, ten great hotels, and ten things to know 
about German wine.t
Easily found on the yellow pages at the back of this book is your Quick 
Concierge, with an A-to-Z list of fast facts, like how the telephone system 
works and what numbers to call in an emergency. In the Quick Concierge, 
you also find a list of toll-free telephone numbers and Web sites for air-
lines, car-rental agencies, and hotel chains serving Germany, as well as 
resources for locating additional information on specific cities or areas. 
All this is followed by a few helpful worksheets to help make your trip 
planning easier.

Icons Used in This Book
In the margins, you find six different icons, little pictures that point out 
helpful trip-planning details or items that are just for fun:
 
 Bargain Alert is my favorite icon, and I suspect it may be yours, too. I’m 
not cheap, but I love to save money. You see this icon every time I tell you 
about something that can save you cash.
 
 The Best of the Best icon highlights the best the destination has to offer 
in all categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, 
and nightlife.
 
 This icon points out tidbits about German culture, personalities, and 
places of special interest.
 
 I’m not an alarmist, so you won’t find too many of these icons. If you do 
see one, I want you to be aware of something such as a scam that can cost 
you money, or a hazardous situation.
 Traveling with children? Keep your eyes peeled for this icon, which points 
out hotels, restaurants, or attractions that welcome kids or that kids actu-
ally enjoy.
 
 The Tip icon highlights useful bits of information that can save you time 
or enhance your travel experience. 
Where to Go from Here
To Germany, of course! How you want to use this guide is up to you. You 
can start at the beginning and read the book straight through to the end. 
Or you can start anywhere in between and extract information as you 
want or need it. I hope you’ll think of me as your guide or companion on 
this journey to Germany, which is sure to be wunderbar.

Part I
Introducing 
Germany

In this part . . .
W
here to begin? This part lays the groundwork for your 
trip to Germany. Chapter 1 introduces you to the best 
Germany has to offer — the most exciting cities, the most 
scenic landscapes, and the most interesting attractions. 
Chapter 2 helps you to understand the country and its cul-
ture by giving an overview of its history, an introduction to 
its architecture and cuisine, and a list of recommended books 
and movies. In Chapter 3, I tell you more about the places 
included in the book and discuss scheduling your trip so you 
can decide where and when to go. In Chapter 4, I present four 
possible itineraries for visitors who want to sample a wide 
range of sights.

Chapter 1
Discovering the 
Best of Germany
In This Chapter
▶ Experiencing the greatest cities
▶ Exploring romantic landscapes
▶ Discovering legendary castles and palaces
▶ Visiting smaller towns and cities
▶ Enjoying world-class classical music, opera, and ballet
G
ermany holds a special fascination for travelers. This land of con-
trasting cities, landscapes, and moods appeals to visitors for many 
different reasons. Perhaps you, like millions of others, have German 
ancestors, and you want to explore their home turf. Or maybe you have 
an image of Germany in your mind — a castle on a hilltop, an Alpine vil-
lage, a palace in a landscaped garden, or a giant beer hall with an oom-
pah-pah band — and you want to check it out for yourself. Then there’s 
the culture: Every midsize to large German city has at least one art 
museum, a symphony orchestra, and an opera house, making a visit to 
Germany a feast for those who enjoy art and music. Clubbers, too, will 
find that the club/bar/disco scene in Germany is hot, not only in large 
cities like Berlin and Munich but also in smaller university towns like 
Cologne, Leipzig, and Heidelberg. Some visitors come for the chance to 
drink full-bodied German beer; others come to enjoy a cosmopolitan 
cafe culture where coffee, cake, and conversation are afternoon staples. 
And don’t forget the retail: Great shopping opportunities abound year-
round in Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, and Cologne. During the Christmas 
season, the main squares in virtually all of Germany’s cities and towns 
glitter and glow with the lights, food, and gift stalls of Christmas mar-
kets, a tradition that dates back hundreds of years. You’ll find as many 
different reasons to visit Germany as there are tourists who arrive daily, 
by the thousands, at the airports in Frankfurt, Munich, or Berlin.
 
 This chapter is designed as an at-a-glance reference to the absolute best — 
the Best of the Best — that Germany has to offer. In the categories that I 
outline, you’ll find some of the things that make traveling in Germany such 
a fascinating experience. I discuss each of these places and experiences 

Part I: Introducing Germany 
10
in detail later in this book; you can find them in their indicated chapters, 
marked with — what else? — a Best of the Best icon.
Discovering the Best Big German Cities
Germany’s top cities offer a wealth of diversions, as simple or as sophis-
ticated as you want. You’ll find world-class museums, music, cuisine of 
all kinds, great shopping, and plenty of nightlife. You’ll also find elegant 
boulevards, riverside promenades, enormous parks and green spaces, 
bustling pedestrian-only quarters, fascinating architecture, and plenty 
of picturesque corners just waiting to be discovered. And thanks to 
Germany’s excellent public-transportation systems, you can easily reach 
it all by subway, streetcar, or bus.
 
✓ With its endlessly dramatic history and cache of cultural and artis-
tic riches, Berlin (Chapters 11 and 12) is always brimming with 
major-league buzz. But since 1989, when the wall separating East 
Germany and West Germany came down, Germany’s largest city 
and restored capital has become an international superstar. The 
pulse of Berlin is felt throughout Europe, and when you’re walking 
down Berlin’s two most famous avenues, the Kurfürstendamm and 
Unter den Linden, you’ll feel it, too.
 
✓ Munich (Chapter 15) is a southern German city where the urban 
pleasures are as soft and sweet as Schlagsahne (whipped cream) on 
a rich slab of cake or as exuberant as an oom-pah-pah band in a 
giant beer hall during Oktoberfest. The capital of Bavaria is sensu-
ous, sophisticated, and fun-loving, with countless cultural diver-
sions and a kind of urban magic that snares the hearts of millions 
of visitors each year.
 
✓ Hamburg (Chapter 13), Germany’s second-largest city after Berlin, 
has the liveliness and lustiness of a big port and the sophistication 
of a wealthy European metropolis. The “Queen of the North” pre-
sides over a beautiful setting on the Alster Lake but is notorious for 
her erotically charged entertainment district called the Reeperbahn.
 
✓ Dresden (Chapter 14) reigns as the treasure house of eastern 
Germany. The old capital of Saxony is where you find the world-
famous Zwinger palace/museum complex, the riches of the Green 
Vault, and the reconstructed Frauenkirche, Germany’s most amaz-
ing architectural reconstruction effort.
 
✓ Cologne (Chapter 19), with its soaring cathedral, first-rate muse-
ums, and Rhine-side setting, is one of the most attractive and 
intriguing cities in western Germany. Cologne’s carnival is the big-
gest and brashest in the country, and its vibrant contemporary-arts 
scene gives it a hefty dose of sophistication.
 
✓ Frankfurt (Chapter 20), with its bevy of designer skyscrapers, yields 
plenty of pleasant surprises, including a fine lineup of museums and 
great shopping on Germany’s busiest shopping street, the Zeil.

 Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Germany 11
Roaming the Most Romantic Landscapes
Landscapes of fabled beauty and scenic splendor are found throughout 
Germany, and views of them are accessible by train, boat, and car. From 
the majesty of the Bavarian Alps in the south to the sandy beaches of 
the Baltic Sea in the north, and from the winegrowing Rhine Valley in the 
west to the high, rocky cliffs along the Elbe in the east, Germany offers a 
wealth of sightseeing possibilities.
 
✓ From Dresden you can easily explore a scenic region called Saxon 
Switzerland (Chapter 14), where rocky cliffs rise dramatically 
above the Elbe River.
 
✓ The Romantic Road (Chapter 16) is the most romantic byway of all, 
offering a remarkable medley of small medieval towns set within a 
gorgeous Bavarian landscape of river valley and mountain meadow.
 
✓ Perhaps the most dramatic of all German landscapes is the Bavarian 
Alps. The country’s highest mountain, the Zugspitze, towers above 
the Alpine resort town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen (Chapter 16).
 
✓ Sophisticated health spas and recreational activities abound in the 
tree-clad mountains of the Schwarzwald (Black Forest; Chapter 
17), where you find lakes, hiking trails, and scenic lookouts.
 
✓ The Bodensee (Lake Constance; Chapter 17), an enormous lake 
near Germany’s sunny southwestern border, is like a bit of the 
Mediterranean, with semitropical gardens and an almost Italian 
languor.
 
✓ Cruises down the mighty River Rhine (Chapter 19) take you past 
castle-crowned crags and legendary sights, such as Lorelei rock.
 
✓ The Mosel Valley (Chapter 19), between Trier and Koblenz, is a 
scenic winegrowing region encompassing thousands of acres of 
vineyards, Roman ruins, medieval castles, and riverside towns with 
cobbled streets and half-timbered houses.
 
✓ With its fruit trees and vineyards growing on sunny, sheltered 
slopes, the Rhine Valley (Chapter 19), from Koblenz south to 
Alsace, is like a northern extension of Italy.
 
✓ The Rheingau wine district (Chapter 19), found along a lovely 
45km (27-mile) stretch of the Rhine, west of Mainz and Wiesbaden, 
has been a wine-producing region for upwards of 2,000 years.
Marveling over the Best Castles and Palaces
At one time, Germany was a conglomeration of regional kingdoms, duchies, 
and vast estates, ruled over by an assortment of kings, dukes, princes, and 
prince-bishops. As a result, Germany is loaded with a fascinating collection 
of castles and palaces, both great and small, many of them full of art trea-
sures, and all of them open to the public. 

Part I: Introducing Germany 
12
 
✓ Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin (Chapter 12) is home to several 
museums and staterooms that can be visited on guided tours.
 
✓ Sanssouci (Chapter 12), Frederick the Great’s 18th-century rococo 
palace in Potsdam, is remarkable, in part, because it suffered 
almost no damage during World War II. You can easily visit 
Sanssouci and its beautiful grounds on a day trip from Berlin.
 
✓ Carefully reconstructed after World War II, the amazing Zwinger 
Palace in Dresden (Chapter 14) is now an unparalleled showcase 
for old master paintings and porcelain treasures.
 
✓ Nymphenburg Palace on the outskirts of Munich is another king-
size showplace, as is the gigantic Residenz, right in the heart of the 
city (see Chapter 15 for both). With their precious paintings, porce-
lains, and furniture, these stately homes reveal aspects of German 
life and the monarchy that lasted until 1918.
 
✓ For sheer, over-the-top opulence, nothing can compare to the fairy-
tale castles built in the 19th century by Ludwig II of Bavaria. 
Neuschwanstein and Linderhof (see Chapter 16 for both) are pre-
served almost exactly as they were during Ludwig’s lifetime.
 
✓ Used by the powerful prince-bishops until 1806, the Residenz in 
Würzburg (Chapter 16) is famed for its superb ceiling frescoes by 
Tiepolo.
 
✓ A palace that doubled as a fortress, the Marienburg crowns the 
vineyard-covered slopes above Würzburg and today houses the 
Mainfränkische Museum (Chapter 16), featuring brilliant 
Renaissance-era woodcarvings by Tilman Riemenschneider.
 
✓ Perched on its crag high above Heidelberg, Heidelberg Castle 
(Chapter 18) suffered from war and fire, but it remains an impres-
sive sight even in its semiruined state.
 
✓ For many visitors, the quintessential image associated with 
Germany is a castle on a hilltop. You do, indeed, find castles scat-
tered throughout the country. Ruined castles dot the landscape of 
the Rhine (Chapter 19) and enhance its romantic appeal.
Exploring the Best Small Towns and Cities
Germany is remarkable for its attractive smaller towns and cities, scat-
tered like gemstones around the country. In these historic hamlets, 
many of them located less than an hour’s train ride from a major 
metropolis, you’ll find a very different Germany. Brimming with the fla-
vors of the past, you can easily savor them as day trips.
 
✓ An easy day trip from Hamburg, lovely Lübeck (Chapter 13) epito-
mizes the maritime culture and redbrick architecture of northern 
Germany. So many architectural gems are located here that the 
entire Old City is a UNESCO World Heritage Site — a place judged 

 Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Germany 13
to be of exceptional cultural value, according to the United Nations 
agency that promotes education and the arts.
 
✓ Weimar (Chapter 14), in eastern Germany, was a cradle of the 
German Enlightenment of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. 
This small, unspoiled hamlet was home to Goethe and Schiller, 
among others, and provides a glimpse into 18th-century German 
life and culture within an urban townscape of unparalleled grace.
 
✓ Rothenburg ob der Tauber (Chapter 16), a major highlight along 
the Romantic Road, is a walled medieval city loaded with pictur-
esque charm. You can walk along the old city walls of this perfectly 
preserved gem and stroll down streets that haven’t changed much 
in hundreds of years.
 
✓ A stop on the Romantic Road or an easy day trip from Munich, 
Augsburg (Chapter 16) is full of historic panache and architectural 
surprises, including Renaissance-era palaces and the oldest alms-
house in Germany.
 
✓ Located in the Bavarian Alps near Neuschwanstein Castle, Füssen 
(Chapter 16) invites you to stroll along its cobblestone streets past 
stone houses and a rushing mountain river.
 
✓ Lindau (Chapter 17), a marvelous little island-city in the Bodensee 
(Lake Constance), has a sunny, flower-filled charm that’s perfect 
for lazing away a day or two. The garden-island of Mainau is a short 
ferry ride away.
 
✓ One of the most sophisticated spa towns in Europe, Baden-Baden 
(Chapter 17) offers an extraordinary range of spa treatments during 
the day and elegant gaming rooms at night.
 
✓ Heidelberg (Chapter 18), an old university town on the Neckar 
River, enchants visitors with its romantic setting, historic streets, 
and enormous castle.
 
✓ Stuttgart (Chapter 18), a 40-minute train ride from Heidelberg, is 
the arts and culture capital of southwestern Germany, with major 
art collections, intriguing architecture, and the second-largest beer 
festival after Munich.
 
✓ Nuremberg (Chapter 18) was an important center of the German 
Renaissance that later became an infamous locale for huge, Nazi-
era rallies. Remnants and reminders from both eras are plentiful in 
Nuremberg, one of the most attractive midsize German cities.
Enjoying the Best in Music, Opera, and Ballet
You don’t need to know German in order to enjoy a performance in one 
of Germany’s wonderful array of opera houses and concert halls. Lovers 
of classical music, ancient music, pop music, opera, and ballet will find 
that Germany is a gold mine. Tickets for musical events, including grand 

Part I: Introducing Germany

opera, are reasonably priced, and the quality of musical performance is 
extraordinarily high.
 
✓ Berlin (Chapter 12) is home to three major symphony orchestras, 
including the famed Berlin Philharmonic, conducted by Sir Simon 
Rattle, and three opera houses that share their stages with resident 
ballet companies. Club and concert venues pulse nightly through-
out the city.
 
✓ A visit to Dresden (Chapter 14) can be made even more memorable 
by an evening at the Semperoper (Semper Opera House), one of 
the world’s great opera houses, or hearing a concert by the 
Dresden Philharmonic.
 
✓ Up north, Hamburg (Chapter 13) plays host to the Hamburgische 
Staatsoper (Hamburg State Opera), the Hamburg Ballet, and three 
highly regarded orchestras.
 
✓ The city of Leipzig (Chapter 14) is home to the world-renowned 
Gewandhaus Orchestra and the acclaimed Leipzieger Oper 
(Leipzig Opera). Leipzig celebrates its most famous citizen — the 
composer Johann Sebastian Bach, who lived and worked in the city 
for more than 40 years — with the yearly Bachfest.
 
✓ In Munich (Chapter 15), one of the great cultural centers of 
Germany, the brilliant Bayerischen Staatsoper (Bavarian State 
Opera) shares the National Theater stage with its ballet company, 
while the magnificent Münchner Philharmoniker (Munich 
Philharmonic Orchestra) performs in the Philharmonic Hall.
 
✓ The Stuttgart Ballet in Stuttgart (Chapter 18) hit international star-
dom in the 1970s when John Cranko took over the company. 
Cranko is gone, but the company still performs at the State 
Theater, and so does the Staatsoper (State Opera).
 
✓ For a city of its size, Cologne (Chapter 19) has an amazing array of 
musical offerings. Major artists appear at the Oper der Stadt Köln 
(Cologne Opera), the Rhineland’s leading opera house, and two fine 
orchestras — the Gürzenich Kölner Philharmoniker (Cologne 
Philharmonic) and the Westdeutscher Rundfunk Orchestra (West 
German Radio Orchestra) — perform in the Kölner Philharmonie 
concert hall. The group Musica Antiqua Köln is one of the world’s 
foremost early-music ensembles. And thanks to its huge student 
population, Cologne is home to a throbbing club and pop-music 
scene.
 
✓ Opera Frankfurt/Ballet Frankfurt gives a big musical boost to 
Frankfurt (Chapter 20), as does the Frankfurt Philharmonic.

▶ Discovering German food, beer, and wine
▶ Finding books and movies about Germany
T
his chapter helps you find out more about Germany and deepens 
your experience of the country. I distill the essence of Germany’s 
complicated and tumultuous past so you can get a clear, quick sense of 
the major epochs. I highlight the main architectural trends, whet your 
appetite with a primer on German food and drink, and recommend some 
excellent books and movies about Germany.
The Main Events: Tracking Germany’s History
Germany’s long and tumultuous history remains clouded by the horrors 
of World War II. How a civilized European nation slipped into the state of 
barbaric inhumanity that existed during Nazism’s rise and the war that 
followed is a question that continues to occupy historians and survivors 
and haunt the Germans themselves. The following list highlights the 
main trends in German history:
 
✓ Early history: Prehistoric humans hunted in the Rhine and Neckar 
valleys of present-day Germany. By the first century a.d., the 
Roman sphere of influence extended well into the borders of pres-
ent-day Germany, with garrisons established at Cologne (Chapter 
19), Koblenz, Mainz, and Trier. Following the Roman withdrawal 
from Germany in a.d. 400, the empire of the Franks represented the 
transition from a loose conglomeration of German tribes into what 
eventually would become the German Empire. Charlemagne (Karl 
der Grosse; 768–814) was responsible for the earliest large-scale 
attempt to unite the lands of Germany under one ruler.

Part I: Introducing Germany 
16
 
✓ The Middle Ages: The power struggles and invasions of the 
Middle Ages continually disrupted the unity hammered out by 
Charlemagne. Because of the weakness of central authority, various 
German tribal duchies sought to build their own autonomy, and 
until the demise of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Germany 
remained a collection of small principalities and free cities. An 
upswing in international commerce from the 11th to 13th centuries 
led to the foundation of “Free Imperial Cities” like Hamburg and 
Lübeck (see Chapter 13 for both).
 
✓ The Reformation, the Enlightenment, and Napoleon: The 16th 
century was a time of social unrest and religious upheaval through-
out Germany. Martin Luther (1483–1546) battled against the excesses 
of the Catholic Church, and his work had far-reaching implications. 
As Protestant Reformation spread, the Catholic Church launched a 
Counter-Reformation that culminated in the bloody Thirty Years’ 
War (1618–1648), pitting the Protestant north against the Catholic 
south and affecting the whole of Europe. Under Frederick the 
Great (Friedrich der Grosse; 1740–1786), Prussia gained status as a 
great European power. During this period, the works of German art-
ists, writers, composers, and philosophers ushered in the Age of 
Enlightenment. After defeating the Austrian and Prussian armies, 
Napoleon occupied several German cities and abolished the Holy 
Roman Empire in 1806. In 1813, Prussian, Austrian, and Russian 
armies fought the French emperor in Leipzig, which was followed 
by the decisive Battle of Waterloo.
 
✓ Revolution and the Reich: Following Napoleon’s defeat, the coun-
try’s military and political rulers were determined to return to a 
system of absolute monarchy. The question of independence and 
national unity finally came to a head in the 1848 revolution. When 
that effort failed, the Austrian Hapsburg monarchy reimposed its 
sovereignty over Prussia and other parts of Germany. Prussian 
statesman Otto von Bismarck (1815–1898) advocated consolida-
tion of the German people under Prussian leadership. After tri-
umphs in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), Bismarck 
succeeded in winning over southern German states and, in 1871, 
became first chancellor of the German Empire (Reich).
 
✓ World War I and Weimar: For many observers, the Great War 
(1914–1918) represented a German attempt to dominate Europe. 
Military conflict on the eastern front resulted in the defeat of 
Russia, while fighting on the western front ultimately led to German 
defeat and the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Although the war 
wasn’t fought on German soil, it resulted in severe food shortages 
throughout the country and intensified political unrest. In its 
attempt to establish a democratic and republican government, the 
so-called Weimar government (1919–1934) represented a break in 
dominant traditions of German history. Residual issues from war 
and hostility from conservative groups conflicted with reformist 
and radical impulses of the left and with the cultural avant-garde.

 Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Germany 17
 
✓ The rise of Nazism and World War II: Economic crisis in Germany 
was a major factor in the rise of the Nazi movement, but old author-
itarian, nationalistic, and imperialistic attitudes also provided a 
ripe environment for the National Socialist Party to take control. As 
the brutal anti-Semitic political agenda of Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) 
became apparent, thousands of German Jews, including many 
prominent artists, scientists, and politicians, fled the country to 
escape persecution. Millions of Jews and other “undesirable” 
minorities throughout Germany and the rest of Nazi-occupied 
Europe were systematically exterminated in one of the most horri-
fying chapters in world history. At the end of the war, with its 
major cities in smoldering ruins, Germany ceased to exist as an 
independent state.
 
✓ The two Germanys: Intending at first to govern conquered Germany 
as one unit, the war’s victors divided it into two states as the Cold War 
intensified. The Federal Republic of Germany in the western half of 
the country had its capital in Bonn, and the Soviet-ruled German 
Democratic Republic (GDR) in the eastern half had its capital in East 
Berlin. Two Germanys developed with highly different political, eco-
nomic, and social systems. In 1948, West German recovery got under-
way with U.S. assistance in the form of the Marshall Plan. The Soviet 
blockade of West Berlin resulted in the Anglo-American Berlin airlift, 
which continued until 1949. In 1961, the Berlin Wall was constructed, 
sealing off East Berlin from West Berlin.
 
✓ Germany reunited: The opening of the Berlin Wall in 1989 marked 
for East Germany the culmination of a wave of previously sup-
pressed revolutionary sentiment across central and eastern 
Remembering the Nazi-era past
Germany’s Nazi-era past and the enormity of crimes committed during World War II 
are facts that can’t be glossed over or overlooked. The most wrenching memorials of 
that gruesome chapter of German history are the concentration camps Buchenwald 
(Chapter 14), near the eastern German town of Weimar, and Dachau (Chapter 15), 
northwest of Munich. Berlin (Chapter 12) is particularly rich in memorials commem-
orating the hundreds of thousands of Jews, gays, Gypsies (Sinta, in German), and 
other groups that were persecuted and murdered by the National Socialists between 
1933 and 1945. In Berlin, walking tours focus on the city’s Nazi and Jewish past. In 
Nuremberg (Chapter 18), the site of Nazi-architect Albert Speer’s enormous Congress 
Hall has been reclaimed as the Dokumentationszentrum Reichsparteitagsgelände 
(Nazi Rally Grounds Documentation Center) with a brilliantly informative exhibit that 
chronicles the rise and fall of the National Socialists. You can also visit the courtroom 
in Nuremberg where Nazi officials were tried after the war. Germany’s Jewish past is 
the subject of Berlin’s remarkable Jüdisches Museum (Jewish Museum), the most 
comprehensive of its kind.

Part I: Introducing Germany 
18
Europe. Reforms by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and under-
ground, grassroots communication between citizens in East Germany 
led to massive demonstrations against the repressive, Stalinist govern-
ment of the GDR. In 1990, with East and West Germany united under 
one government, Berlin was made the nation’s new capital. In 2006, 
Angela Merkel became Germany’s first female chancellor.
Building Blocks: Looking at Local Architecture
Buildings that you can visit on a trip to Germany span some 1,200 years 
of architectural history and were created in a number of different styles. 
(The Porta Nigra, a 1,800-year-old arched gateway in Trier, is Germany’s 
only remaining Roman-era structure of any significance.) Bombing raids 
in World War II left much of the country’s rich architectural heritage in 
ruins. Some areas escaped damage, such as the medieval towns along 
the Romantic Road (see Chapter 16), but the overall devastation affected 
nearly the entire country. Many historic buildings are painstaking post-
war reconstructions. Here are examples from around Germany of the 
major architectural trends:
 
✓ Romanesque (10th–12th centuries): Simple, clear forms, thick 
walls, and rounded arches signal Romanesque architecture, a build-
ing style adapted from much earlier Roman models. Many interest-
ing examples of Romanesque architecture are found in western 
Germany, particularly in Cologne (Chapter 19). The Dom St. Kilian 
in Würzburg (Chapter 16), built from 1045 to 1188, is one of the 
largest Romanesque churches in Germany.
 
✓ Gothic (13th–16th centuries): Cologne Cathedral (Chapter 19) is 
Germany’s greatest example of Gothic architecture. Compared to 
Romanesque, this style is slender and daring, with pointed arches, 
soaring vaults and spires, and enormous windows. A simpler and 
more monumental kind of Gothic architecture, built of brick, predomi-
nates in northern Germany in cities such as Lübeck (Chapter 13).
 
✓ Renaissance (late 15th–17th centuries): Augsburg (Chapter 16) is 
one of the best cities in Germany to see Renaissance architecture, a 
style characterized by calm precision, orderly repeating lines, and 
classical decoration over windows and doors. Renaissance archi-
tecture was imported from Italy.
 
✓ Baroque (17th–18th centuries): A decorative exuberance in curvy 
baroque architecture sets it apart from the more sober Renaissance 
style. The baroque flourished in Catholic, Counter-Reformation 
areas in the south of Germany. The Residenz in Würzburg (Chapter 
16) and palace of Sanssouci in Potsdam (Chapter 12) are two of the 
best examples of baroque architecture in Germany. Munich 
(Chapter 15) abounds in the baroque.
 
✓ Rococo (18th century): Notch up the elements of baroque and you 
have rococo, exemplified by curving walls and staggering amounts 

 Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Germany 19
of gilded and stucco decoration. One of the most famous examples 
of flamboyant rococo architecture in Germany is the Wieskirche 
(Chapter 16) in Bavaria.
 
✓ Neoclassical/Neo-Gothic (mid 18th–19th centuries): The neoclassical 
style was meant to be a rebuke to the excesses of baroque and rococo, 
and it was most popular in Berlin (see Chapter 12), where the archi-
tect Schinkel created a whole neoclassical avenue (Unter den Linden) 
and island of museums. As the century wore on, neoclassicism gave 
way to the more ponderous Neo-Gothic style. This faux-medievalism is 
what Ludwig’s Neuschwanstein (Chapter 16) is all about.
 
✓ Jugendstil (early 20th century): Jugendstil is the German name for Art 
Nouveau, an early 20th-century European movement that emphasized 
flowing, asymmetrical, organic shapes. The famous Mädlerpassage 
arcade in Leipzig (Chapter 14) shows Jugendstil influence, and so do 
many houses in the Schwabing district of Munich (Chapter 15).
 
✓ Bauhaus (1913–1933): A rigorously modern style, free of frills and 
unnecessary decoration, Bauhaus was championed by Walter Gropius 
(1883–1969), who founded the Bauhaus school to create functional 
buildings and furnishings. The Bauhaus style predominates in the 
Weissenhofsiedlung area of Stuttgart (Chapter 18), created for a 1927 
building exhibition. Bauhaus museums are found in Weimar (Chapter 
14) and Berlin (Chapter 12). The school was banned by the Nazis 
because it didn’t promote “German-looking” architecture.
 
✓ Modernism (1948–): A major housing shortage and rebuilding effort 
in bombed cities in Germany followed the devastation of World War 
II. If you walk down the streets or pedestrian zones in just about any 
major German city, you’ll see modernist buildings all around you. It’s 
a simple, functional style with straight lines and square windows.
 
✓ Postmodernism (1980s–): Postmodernism is a style practiced by 
architects who plunder the past and apply old styles to the build-
ings of today. James Stirling’s Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart 
(Chapter 18) is a reminder of just how clunky, uninspired, and 
unappealing most postmodern buildings are.
Essen und Trinken: Eating and 
Drinking in Germany
German cooking tends to be hearty and filling, with many regional varia-
tions and specialties. Seasonal specialties include Spargel (white aspar-
agus) in May and June, Matjes (white herring) in June and July, Erdbeeren 
(strawberries) in spring, Forelle (trout) in the summer, Reh (venison) in 
the fall, and Gans (goose) in late fall and early winter. In the country as 
a whole, you can taste about 150 different types of sausage; Berlin, Munich, 
and Nuremberg all have their own special kinds. When it comes to baked 
goods — bread and pastries — Germany has more variety than any 

Part I: Introducing Germany 
20
country in the world, with about 300 different types of bread and 1,200 
varieties of biscuits and cakes.
 
 Ratskellers, traditional cellar restaurants beneath a city’s Rathaus (town 
hall), always serve good and fairly inexpensive traditional food, beer, and 
wine. And there’s been some good news for diners: In 2008, Germany 
enacted a new nonsmoking policy in public places. You can now enjoy a 
smoke-free meal in any German restaurant.
 
 Although not kind to the waistline, the German tradition of afternoon 
Kaffee und Kuchen (coffee and cake) is alive and well. Look out for regional 
specialties, too. Lübeck (Chapter 13), for example, is the capital of marzi-
pan (almond paste), and Nuremberg (Chapter 18) is famous for its 
Lebkuchen (spice cakes). German wines (Chapter 23), mostly from grapes 
grown in the scenic Rhine and Mosel valleys (Chapter 19), provide excel-
lent accompaniments to any meal. And German beers are legendary. Each 
city has its own local favorites.
Sampling German beer
Bier (pronounced beer) remains a vital part of German culture, so much so that the 
right to drink beer is written into some labor contracts, and a beer with lunch in the 
factory cafeteria is taken for granted. The traditional Biergarten (beer garden), with 
tables set outdoors under trees or trellises, is still very popular, especially in southern 
Germany. A Bräuhaus (broy-house) serves its own brew along with local food.
When you order a beer in Germany, you have many choices. The range of beer variet-
ies includes Altbier, Bockbier, Export, Kölsch, Lager, Malzbier, Märzbier, Pils, Vollbier, 
and Weizenbier. The ratio of ingredients, brewing temperature and technique, alco-
holic content, aging time, color, and taste all contribute to a German beer’s unique 
qualities. A German law adopted in 1516 dictates that German beer may contain no 
ingredients other than hops, malt (barley), yeast, and water.
Dark and sweet Malzbier (maltz-beer; malt beer) contains hardly any alcohol. Vollbier 
(foal-beer; standard beer) has 4 percent alcohol, Export has 5 percent, and Bockbier has 
6 percent. Pils, or Pilsener, beers are light and contain more hops. Weizenbier (vi-tsen-
beer), made from wheat, is a Bavarian white beer. Märzbier (maertz-beer), or “March 
beer,” is dark and strong. The most popular beer in Germany is Pils, followed by Export.
To order a beer, decide whether you want a dunkles Bier (dune-kles beer; dark beer, 
brewed with darkly roasted malt fermented for a long period of time) or a helles Bier 
(hell-less beer; light beer, brewed from malt dried and baked by the local brewery). 
You ask for ein Grosses (ine grow-ses), for a large, or ein Kleines (ine kly-nis), for a 
small, and tell the waiter or tavernkeeper whether you want ein Bier vom Fass (ine 
beer fum fahss; from the barrel) or in a Flasche (flah-shuh; bottle). The beer is always 
served cold, but not too cold, in an appropriate beer glass or mug, with a long-lasting 
head of white foam. A proper draft beer, according to the Germans, can’t be poured 
in less than seven minutes to achieve the proper head.

Movies
As with literature, World War II and the Holocaust have dominated the 
subject matter of recent films about Germany — so much so that German-
made films about contemporary German life rarely get a showing outside 
of Germany unless they win a top prize at a film festival. My recommended 
list includes a selection of German and Germany-themed films.

▶ Flipping through the country’s calendar of events
W
hat do you want to see when you visit Germany, and when do 
you want to go? In this chapter, I help you to narrow your focus 
so you can start planning your trip in earnest. This chapter points out 
highlights of each region and gives you the lowdown on the weather so 
you can determine the best destinations and time of year for your visit. I 
also include a calendar of events so you can time your trip to coincide 
with, or avoid, special festivals and events.
Going Where You Want to Be
Germany For Dummies, 4th Edition, is a selective guidebook, geared to 
savvy travelers who want to know more about Germany’s leading sights. 
I don’t cover every state, region, and city in Deutschland, only the essen-
tial highlights. My aim in this book is to introduce you to the best cities, 
historic towns, special sights, and scenic regions that Germany has to 
offer. To figure out which regions to visit during your trip, check out the 
following thumbnail sketches and find details of the best places 
Germany has to offer in Chapters 1 and 2. For locations, see the “Regions 
in Brief” map in this chapter.
Discovering northern Germany
Northern Germany is a different world from southern Germany. 
Architecturally, the north’s sober redbrick Gothic churches and build-
ings lack the ornate baroque decorations found in the Catholic south. 
The food is plainer, too, with an emphasis on fish. The climate in the 
north, which is influenced by the Baltic and North seas, often is wet or 
misty, and this maritime atmosphere is part of its overall appeal.

 Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 25
After Berlin, Hamburg is the second-largest city in Germany, and its 
harbor, one of the biggest in the world, is a major tourist attraction; so 
are the breezy Alster Lakes in the center of the city. In Hamburg, you 
can explore beautiful 19th-century neighborhoods, such as Altona, now 
a lively area with restaurants, cafes, and bars, and visit the Hamburger 
Kunsthalle (Fine Arts Museum), which houses an outstanding, multifac-
eted collection of art. Lübeck, an easy day trip from Hamburg, has so many 
medieval brick buildings that UNESCO designated it a World Heritage 
Site — a place judged to be of exceptional cultural value, according to 
the United Nations agency that promotes education and the arts. In the

Part I: Introducing Germany 
26
Altstadt (Old City), you see examples of Lübeck’s 900-year-old history 
everywhere you turn, from the Gothic Rathaus (town hall) to the church 
spires that dominate the skyline. In Bremen, another easy day trip from 
Hamburg, you find a historic center with a day’s worth of sightseeing 
possibilities. For the scoop on Hamburg, Lübeck, and Bremen, turn to 
Chapter 13.
Exploring eastern Germany
Now that Germany is reunited, you have an opportunity to visit sections 
of eastern Germany that for 45 years were inaccessible, or at least diffi-
cult to visit, under the Communist regime of the former German Democratic 
Republic (GDR). Dresden, on the Elbe River and only two hours from 
Berlin by train, has treasures beyond measure in the Zwinger Palace 
and the Residenzschloss. Leipzig, on the other hand, has been less 
interested in restoring its past than looking toward the future. The 
peaceful revolution of 1989 began there, and the city seems to be work-
ing overtime to come to grips with its GDR legacy: The Museum in der 
Runden Ecke is devoted to the role the Stasi (East Germany’s secret 
police) played in the lives of citizens. Similarly, the Zeitgeschichtliches 
Museum (Contemporary History Museum) chronicles the history and 
artifacts of the GDR years. Leipzig’s rich musical and artistic heritage is 
showcased in Bach Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts.
The small, quiet, eastern town of Weimar is in a category of its own. It 
suffered little damage during the war and was the home of Germany’s 
greatest writer, the poet and dramatist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe 
(1749–1832), and to the playwright Friedrich Schiller (1759–1805). The 
homes of these two literary giants are Weimar’s most popular tourist 
attractions. The small Bauhaus Museum exhibits paintings, textiles, pot-
tery, furniture, and drawings from the Bauhaus school, which began 
here in 1919. A visit to the Buchenwald Memorial, the site of a Nazi-run 
concentration camp just outside of Weimar where at least 56,000 people 
died, can be an intense and profoundly moving experience. You find 
complete coverage of Dresden, Leipzig, and Weimar in Chapter 14.
Big, brash Berlin was the capital of the old German Reich for 70 years 
before it was divided into two cities — one capitalist, one Communist — 
after World War II. It has stitched itself back together to become the cap-
ital (and largest city) of a reunified Germany and now reigns as one of 
the most fascinating cities in the world. Does the Berliner Luft (Berlin air) 
account for Berlin’s endless and ongoing fizz of excitement, as some people 
claim? With world-class museums, top performing-arts venues, historic 
reverberations, and striking new architecture, Berlin is where everything 
is happening in Germany right now. You find comprehensive coverage of 
Berlin — including a day trip to Frederick the Great’s charming 18th-cen-
tury palace of Sanssouci in Potsdam — in Chapters 11 and 12.
Savoring southern Germany
Southern Germany is worlds apart from the north. Bavaria, Germany’s 
largest and most prosperous Land (state), is a place that’s tailor-made 

 Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 27
for tourists. Munich, the capital (and Germany’s third-largest city after 
Berlin and Hamburg), is cultured and elegant, with an upscale chic, but 
it’s also boisterous, even raucous: Millions pour into the city during 
Oktoberfest to experience Munich’s renowned giant beer halls and beer 
gardens. Ranking right up there with the offerings of Berlin are Munich’s 
museums, crammed with old masters, 19th-century greats, and major 
20th-century artists. The city’s most popular museum is the Deutsches 
Museum, the largest science-and-technology museum in the world. In 
the center of town sits an enormous palace, the Residenz, used by the 
rulers of Bavaria from the 14th century up to 1918. You also find lovely 
churches with sober Gothic and exuberant baroque interiors. Munich’s 
musical life is the envy of many cities, with year-round opera, sym-
phony, and concerts of all kinds. Chapter 15 is devoted to the many 
delights of Munich.
Bavaria is full of scenic splendor and picturesque charm. You’ll find 
plenty of both along the Romantic Road, the most beautiful driving tour 
in Germany. This enchanting route winds south from Würzburg to 
Neuschwanstein, Ludwig’s fairy-tale castle in the Bavarian Alps, with 
stops at several perfectly preserved medieval towns along the way. 
From Munich, the day trip to the mountain resort town of Garmisch-
Partenkirchen is an easy one, and it’s close to the Zugspitze, Germany’s 
highest peak, which is accessible by cable car. This Alpine region, where 
cowbells clang in the meadows and classic chalets nestle in picturesque 
valleys, also is where you find Oberammergau, a town that’s famous for 
its woodcarvers and for the Passion play performed there every ten 
years (the next is in 2010) — a tradition dating back to the 17th century. 
The Romantic Road and day trips in Bavaria are covered in Chapter 16.
Southern Germany also includes the Bodensee (Lake Constance), and 
the famous Schwarzwald (Black Forest). Both areas offer great natural 
beauty and plenty of recreational opportunities. Germany’s largest lake, 
the Bodensee, sits in a sun-drenched basin with a view of the Alps to the 
south; semitropical gardens flourish on Mainau, an island in the lake, 
and vineyards and fruit trees grow around its shoreline. Lindau, an 
island-city connected to the mainland by a causeway, is the best spot to 
stay. In the Schwarzwald, the lively and lovely city of Freiburg is a 
delight. From there you can explore the surrounding forest or hunt for a 
cuckoo clock, one of the traditional industries of the Schwarzwald 
region. Farther north is the city of Baden-Baden, with its famous mineral 
baths and glamorous casino. Details about the Bodensee and the 
Schwarzwald are in Chapter 17.
Wending through western Germany
Western Germany is a densely populated area with an ancient history 
and cities with vibrant personalities all their own. Heidelberg is for 
many people the quintessential romantic German town. Sitting on the 
Neckar River amid green hills, Heidelberg’s enormous ruined castle 
oversees its picturesque Altstadt (Old City). Stuttgart, only 40 minutes 
by train from Heidelberg, reigns as the cultural capital of southwestern 

Part I: Introducing Germany 
28
Germany, with major painting collections and the fabulous Neue Galerie, 
an art museum housed in a striking glass cube. Little more than a pile of 
smoldering rubble at the end of World War II, Nuremberg (Nürnberg) 
was rebuilt in a style that evokes the medieval era. Nuremberg has as 
many romantic corners as Heidelberg, in addition to the country’s larg-
est museum of art and culture, the Germanisches Nationalmuseum 
(German National Museum), and a delightful Spielzeugmuseum (Toy 
Museum). The city’s past dark side as a center for Nazi rallies is docu-
mented in the harrowing exhibit at the Dokumentationszentrum 
Reichsparteitagsgelände (Nazi Party Rally Grounds Documentation 
Center) created within Albert Speer’s Nazi Congress Hall. Nuremberg’s 
Christmas Market is the oldest in Germany; Stuttgart’s is one of the larg-
est. Heidelberg, Stuttgart, and Nuremberg are covered in Chapter 18.
Cologne (Köln), which occupies a prime spot on the Rhine River, comes 
as a wonderful surprise to many visitors. This lively, sophisticated, 
and good-natured city, the fourth-largest in Germany, offers more than 
enough to keep you busy for a couple of days. Its chief glory is its awe-
inspiring Dom (cathedral), the largest Gothic structure north of the Alps. 
Cologne was an important Roman town during a period that is wonder-
fully interpreted in the Römisch-Germanisches Museum (Roman-Germanic 
Museum). By contrast, Cologne also is one of the contemporary-art capi-
tals of Germany. Chief among its many outstanding museums are the 
Wallraf-Richartz Museum, one of Germany’s best for art from the 
Middle Ages to the 19th century, and the Museum Ludwig, one of the 
top modern-art museums in Europe.
The Rhine and Mosel valleys in western Germany form one of Europe’s 
top wine-producing areas. River cruises originating in Cologne and many 
other cities in the area take you through valleys of neatly clipped vine-
yards soaking up sunlight on steep hillsides. You can also visit many 
wine towns by train. For more on Cologne and side trips into Germany’s 
wine country, see Chapter 19.
Frankfurt probably is the best-known metropolis in western Germany, 
in part because it’s the point of entry for most visitors who fly into the 
country. The banking capital of Germany and the European Union, Frankfurt 
has a modern, business-oriented buzz and a skyline pierced by designer 
skyscrapers. Among its many cultural offerings are several important 
museums, all described in Chapter 20.
Scheduling Your Time
If you’re flying into the country from outside of Europe, your airport 
choices for direct international flights are Frankfurt, Munich, and Berlin.
 
 Frankfurt airport has its own train station, so it’s possible to hop on a fast 
train at the airport and arrive almost anywhere in Germany within five 
hours of your arrival. If a driving tour along the Romantic Road is part of 

 Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 29
your itinerary, rent a car at Frankfurt airport and drive to the beginning of 
the scenic route in Würzburg, an easy 90-minute drive away (see Chapter 
16 for more details).
If you want to explore all parts of the country, consider centering your 
itineraries in Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, and Cologne.
 
✓ From Berlin, you have easy access to the cities of Dresden, 
Leipzig, and Weimar in eastern Germany.
 
✓ From Hamburg, the northern German cities of Lübeck and Bremen 
are a short train ride away.
 
✓ From Munich, you can easily reach places in the Bavarian Alps, 
including Neuschwanstein, Füssen, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and 
Oberammergau, in addition to Augsburg, Nuremberg, and Lindau 
on the Bodensee (Lake Constance).
 
✓ From Cologne, all the major cities of western Germany — Heidelberg, 
Stuttgart, and Baden-Baden — are never more than three hours 
away by train. You can also arrange for boat trips on the Rhine and 
visit the winegrowing regions by car or train.
 
 Keep German holidays in mind when scheduling your trip. Many museums 
and attractions close on the following public holidays: January 1 (New 
Year’s Day), Easter (including Good Friday and Easter Monday), May 1 
(Labor Day), Ascension Day (ten days before Pentecost/Whitsunday, the 
seventh Sun after Easter), Whitmonday (day after Pentecost/Whitsunday), 
October 3 (Day of German Unity), November 17 (Day of Prayer and 
Repentance), and December 25 to 26 (Christmas). In addition, the follow-
ing holidays are observed in some German states: January 6 (Epiphany), 
Corpus Christi (ten days after Pentecost), August 15 (Assumption), and 
November 1 (All Saints’ Day).
Revealing the Secret of the Seasons
How do you decide what time of year to travel to Germany? This section 
presents the pros and cons of each season, so you can choose the best 
time for your visit.
Traveling during high and low seasons
Roughly speaking, the high season for travel in Germany is from Easter 
to the end of September with another peak in December (for the 
Christmas markets). The country is most crowded during the months of 
May and June. July and August may be less expensive because that’s 
when Germans take off on their own holidays, and many hotels conse-
quently offer lower summer rates. October and November and January 
through March are the low seasons.

Part I: Introducing Germany 
30
 
 In general, crowds and prices tend to rise during big trade fairs. Nearly all 
large German cities have a Messe, or convention center/fairground, with a 
year-round schedule of major trade shows in all industries. These trade 
fairs can put a real squeeze on hotel rooms. Prices also rise, and rooms 
become scarce, during seasonal events such as Munich’s Oktoberfest 
(held mid-Sept to early Oct) and Cologne’s Carnival (especially the three 
days just before Easter).
In the winter months, generally from October through March, museums, 
castles, and tourist offices have shorter hours and may be closed certain 
days of the week. Most castles and palaces can be visited daily year-
round, but from April through September, the lines for major attrac-
tions, like Neuschwanstein and Linderhof castles in Bavaria, or the 
Reichstag dome in Berlin, may be more than two hours long.
Watching those unpredictable skies
 
 Before I write about the weather in Germany, I think a disclaimer is in 
order. As in many parts of the world, the weather in Germany has become 
less predictable than in the past. In northern Germany, for instance, locals 
say that they now receive less snow and more rain than in decades past. 
In southern Germany, some report a hotter and drier climate. So, although 
I can give you a very broad overview of general weather patterns in 
Germany, be prepared for variations. Recent summers brought record-
breaking heat waves and even in autumn many parts of Germany can be 
warmer than expected.
Overall, Germany has a predominantly mild, temperate climate. Average 
summer temperatures range from 72°F to 80°F (20°C–30°C). The average 
winter temperature hovers around 32°F (0°C). That said, bear in mind 
that the climate is constantly affected by colliding continental and mari-
time air masses from the Baltic and North seas, resulting in plenty of 
unpredictable weather, especially in the north. For average tempera-
tures and rainfalls, see Table 3-1 for Berlin in the north and Table 3-2 for 
Frankfurt in the south.

 If your trip includes northern Germany, consider visiting in April and May, 
the months that are least cloudy. Even with clear skies, though, the 
weather up north can remain, shall we say, invigorating. In the interior of 
Germany, the least-gray months usually are June and September.
Blossoming in spring
Spring comes earliest in the south and in the Rhine Valley. The Föhn, a 
dry south wind from the Alps, heralds the approach of spring around 
the giant Bodensee (Lake Constance) and in the river valleys of the 
Schwarzwald (Black Forest) and throughout southwestern Germany.
Here are some of the season’s highlights:
 
✓ The warmth of springtime sun coaxes out the new vines in 
Germany’s Rhineland wine country.
 
✓ Blossoms appear on the fruit trees grown around the Bodensee and 
the Rhine.
 
✓ In towns around the Bodensee, an early spring means that tables 
are set up in sunny squares and life begins to move outdoors.
 
✓ The carefully tended parks and gardens in German cities show off 
their first spring flowers.
 
✓ May and June is Spargel (white asparagus) season throughout 
Germany; you find asparagus specialties on menus everywhere.
 
 But keep in mind these springtime pitfalls:
 
✓ Cold, rainy weather can last well into early summer in Berlin and 
other northern cities.
 
✓ The snow in the Alps usually melts by April, leaving May as an “in-
between” off-month: The weather in the Alps tends to be soggy and 
foggy at this time.

Part I: Introducing Germany 
32
 
✓ During school holidays, especially around Easter, major attractions 
in cities throughout Germany tend to be more crowded.
Shining (and raining) in summer
From April through September, you can generally count on warm, mild 
weather in southern Germany. However, around Cologne and even as far 
north as Berlin, mid- and late-summer days can become hot, humid, and 
thundery, which also can be the case in Dresden, Leipzig, and the land-
locked eastern portion of the country. Summer weather in the Bavarian 
Alps is extremely variable and changes according to altitude, local 
winds, and the orientation of individual valleys to the sun. Summer in 
the north comes later and remains variable because of maritime influ-
ences from the Baltic and North seas.
Some summer perks to consider:
 
✓ Prices for hotels often are lower in July and August.
 
✓ Warm summer nights stay light much longer, until 10 p.m. or some-
times later.
 
✓ Outdoor musical performances and street fairs take place in many 
cities and regions.
 
✓ Lakes in the Alps, the Schwarzwald (Black Forest), and Berlin 
become more inviting as warm weather settles in.
 
✓ Many attractions are open longer hours.
 
✓ You can dine outdoors in most German cities.
 
 But keep in mind:
 
✓ Airfare tends to be higher during summer months.
 
✓ In traffic-jammed cities like Berlin, Munich, and Frankfurt, gasoline 
exhaust can create air pollution on hot, windless days.
 
✓ Heat and humidity can make for sticky sightseeing throughout cen-
tral and southern Germany.
 
✓ Air-conditioning is not common in Germany; hotels and concert 
halls can be broiling.
 
✓ Getting into top attractions like Neuschwanstein Castle and 
Linderhof Palace can take two hours or more.
Glowing in autumn
Fall is one of the best times to visit Germany. Autumn days are beautiful 
in scenic Bavaria, making this a perfect time to explore the Romantic 
Road. The deciduous trees in the Black and Thuringian forests and along 
the Rhine, Neckar, and other river valleys turn golden as the days grow 
shorter. In southern and western Germany, after the grape harvest, vines 

 Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 33
turn yellow. Indian summer, or what the Germans call Altweibersommer 
(old women’s summer), frequently makes a welcome appearance during 
October and November. In the north, autumn is likely to be rainy and 
blustery, heralding gray, wet winters.
A few advantages of autumn:
 
✓ Summer crowds have thinned out by the end of September.
 
✓ Airfares usually drop.
 
✓ Germany’s cultural calendar of opera, symphony, and other events 
swings into high gear.
 
✓ Scenic areas like the Schwarzwald (Black Forest), the Bavarian 
Alps, and the Rhineland glow with autumn hues.
 
✓ Giant beer festivals transform Munich and Stuttgart.
 
✓ The smell of new wine fills the old streets of winegrowing towns, 
where many festivals are held to celebrate the harvest.
 
 This season has only one real drawback: Autumn may be gray and rainy, 
especially in the north.
Welcoming winter
Snow can fall anywhere in Germany, lending a special air to the country’s 
many Christmas markets. But with winter temperatures hovering right 
around freezing, snow doesn’t stay on the ground for long, and often turns 
into sleet. This story is different in the Bavarian Alps and the Schwarzwald 
(Black Forest), where the winter weather is colder and snow adds to the 
beauty of the mountain and forest landscapes. Both the Alps and the 
Schwarzwald are known for their fine skiing and winter sports.
Winter can be wonderful because:
 
✓ In December, cities throughout the country set up magical outdoor 
Christmas markets where you find tree ornaments, handcrafted 
goods, hot mulled wine, and baked delights.
 
✓ When the snow starts to fall in the Alps and the Schwarzwald, 
skiers head for the slopes and cross-country trails.
 
✓ In the weeks before Lent, Cologne and Munich celebrate with city-
wide carnivals known as Fasching.
 
 But winter has its downside:
 
✓ Brrr. The cold can be raw, numbing, and seemingly endless, espe-
cially in the north.
 
✓ Daylight drops dramatically: Darkness falls as early as 4 p.m.
 
✓ Almost everything shuts down on December 25 and 26 and New 
Year’s Day.

Perusing a Calendar of Events
Germany hums year-round with festivals and special events of all kinds. 
Verifying dates beforehand with the German National Tourist Board is a 
good idea. Check its Web site (www.germany-tourism.de), or call for 
a free calendar of events. See the Quick Concierge for the tourist board’s 
contact information.
 
 Many German Web sites do not end with .com but .de (for “Deutschland”). 
If you are looking up a German Web site and don’t speak German, look for 
a tab marked English or Englisch on the home page. There may be only a 
flag icon; if so, the icon for English is more likely to be the British flag (the 
Union Jack) than the American flag.
January
New Year’s Day International Ski Jumping, in Garmisch-Partenkirchen

Following an Itinerary: 
Four Great Options
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing Germany’s top attractions in one or two weeks
▶ Discovering Germany with your kids
▶ Planning trips for wine aficionados
P
utting together a good itinerary is one of the hardest parts of any 
trip. If you haven’t visited a destination before, how do you know 
what’s worth seeing and what isn’t? In this chapter, I lay out some sug-
gested travel itineraries for those with limited time or with special 
interests.
Although you can reach all the destinations in this chapter by train or 
public transportation, some of these itineraries are more enjoyable if 
you have a car. For details on getting around the country, see Chapter 7.
Just the Highlights: Germany in One Week
This seven-day itinerary, beginning in Munich and ending in Berlin, 
shows you the contrasts between southern Germany and northern 
Germany and introduces you to the country’s two greatest cities. I 
include two of King Ludwig II’s castles and a brief stop in Cologne, on 
the Rhine. For more information about the sights that I mention, see 
Chapter 15 for Munich, Chapter 16 for the Bavarian Alps and its castles, 
Chapter 19 for Cologne, and Chapter 12 for Berlin.
Spend Day 1 in marvelous Munich. Shake out your plane-cramped legs 
by taking to the streets for some general exploration. Head first for 
Marienplatz, the city’s main square. You can go up to the top of the 
Rathaus tower for a bird’s-eye view, watch the Glockenspiel, and visit 
the nearby Frauenkirche, Munich’s largest church. Then walk over to 
the adjacent Viktualienmarkt, one of the greatest food markets in 
Europe. Browse around and find a place for lunch from among the 
dozens of possibilities in the area. Afterward, make your way to the 
Asamkirche for a glimpse of the baroque ornamentation for which 

 Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 39
southern Germany is famous. In the afternoon, choose a museum to 
visit. If you’re an art lover, you may want to see the priceless collection 
of old masters at the Alte Pinakotheke. If you’re interested in science 
and technology, make your way to the famous Deutsches Museum. If 
you’re in the mood for oom-pah-pah, have dinner at the fun-loving 
Hofbräuhaus. Munich is one of Germany’s top cultural capitals, so you 
may want to end your evening at a concert or the opera.
Start Day 2 in a palace. You need the entire morning to wander through 
the enormous Residenz in central Munich. Or make an easy excursion to 
beautiful Schloss Nymphenburg, which you can reach by streetcar. If 
you choose Nymphenburg, allow some extra time to wander through the 
gardens, and be sure to visit the collection of carriages, which includes 
the ornate sleighs and coaches used by King Ludwig II of Bavaria, cre-
ator of Linderhof Palace and Neuschwanstein Castle. Have lunch near 
Marienplatz. In the afternoon, choose another museum to visit. Three 
possibilities are the Neue Pinakothek, a showcase for 19th-century 
German and European art; the new Pinakothek Moderne Kunst, which 
displays an international collection of 20th-century masterpieces; and 
the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, the location for Bavaria’s greatest 
historic and artistic treasures. At some point, fit in a stroll in the bucolic 
Englischer Garten, Munich’s largest and prettiest park. Bring a picnic or 
order a meal at the park’s famous beer garden.
On Day 3, head to the Bavarian Alps, just south of Munich. If you rent a 
car, you can easily explore some of the sights along the Romantische 
Strasse (Romantic Road). Or you can take a train to Garmisch-
Partenkirchen and ascend the Zugspitze, Germany’s highest peak, for a 
spectacular view of the Alps. Special cog railways and cable cars take 
you up and bring you back down.
On Day 4, make your way by train or car to Füssen, the town closest to 
Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau castles. Make Neuschwanstein 
your top priority; as Germany’s most popular tourist attraction, this 
castle quickly fills up with tourists as the day wears on. If you’re without 
a car, you can easily get a bus from Füssen for the 6.5km (4-mile) trip to 
the castle. Tours of King Ludwig II’s fairy-tale castle take about one hour. 
You can dine near the parking area below Neuschwanstein. Then, if 
you’re still in a “royal” mood, visit adjacent Hohenschwangau Castle, 
Ludwig’s childhood home. Spend the night in Füssen, and be sure to 
take time to stroll around the lovely historic district of town. If you’re 
driving, you can make an easy excursion to the Wieskirche (Church in 
the Meadow), a beautiful baroque masterpiece located just a few miles 
north of Füssen.
If you have your car for a two-day rental, you may be able to return the 
vehicle in Füssen, or you can drive back to Munich and return it there. 
From either city, hop on the train and make your way to Cologne for 
Day 5. (By fast train, the trip from Munich takes about 51⁄2 hours; the fast-
est train from Füssen takes about 7 hours.) You’ll see Cologne’s greatest 
sight — the enormous Gothic Dom (cathedral) — as you step out of the 

Part I: Introducing Germany 
40
train station. Enjoy the afternoon in this lively Rhine-side city by visiting 
the cathedral and one of its many fine museums, such as the Römisch-
Germanisches Museum (Roman-Germanic Museum), dedicated to the 
Romans who made Cologne one of their strategic forts nearly 2,000 
years ago; the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, displaying old and modern 
masters; and Museum Ludwig, entirely devoted to 20th-century and 
contemporary art. You can also take a sightseeing boat ride along the 
Rhine. Stay overnight in Cologne and have dinner at one of the city’s 
famous beer halls (be sure to sample Kölsch, Cologne’s delicious beer). 
The city has an excellent music scene, too, so you may want to see an 
opera or attend a concert.
On the morning of Day 6, take one of the sleek, super-fast trains to 
Berlin (the trains depart from the Cologne Hauptbahnhof; for train infor-
mation and schedules, call German Rail at % 11861). The trip from 
Cologne is under 41⁄2 hours. Huge, sophisticated Berlin has endless things 
to do. Settle into your hotel and then take one of the sightseeing bus 
tours of the city — otherwise you’ll see only a fraction of this enormous 
metropolis. To book a bus tour, contact Severin + Kühn, Kurfürstendamm 
216 (% 030/880-4190; www.berlinerstadtrundfahrten.de). After 
your tour, make your way over to Potsdamer Platz, the new quarter 
where the Berlin Wall once stood. From Potsdamer Platz, you can walk 
to the Brandenburg Gate, the symbol of the city, and the Reichstag, the 
country’s parliamentary headquarters. Take the elevator up to the new 
dome on top of the Reichstag — the dome is open late, so come back 
later if the line is long. Then walk east down Unter den Linden to 
Museumsinsel (Museum Island), and stop in at the Pergamon Museum 
or the Altes Museum with their fantastic collections of antiquities. (The 
most famous piece in the Altes Museum is the 2,500-year-old bust of 
Egyptian queen Nerfertiti.) Berlin is famed for its nightlife, so when dark-
ness falls, you may want to attend an opera, a concert, or a cabaret.
Here’s hoping your flight home departs sometime in the afternoon on 
Day 7, so you can take advantage of the morning by going over to the 
western side of the city to stroll down the renowned Kurfürstendamm, 
better known as the Ku-Damm, before making your way to the airport.
East Side, West Side: Germany in Two Weeks
What a treat — two weeks to take in the sights! This suggested itinerary 
makes a clockwise circuit of Germany. For detailed information on the 
cities and sights that I mention, check out Chapter 12 for Berlin and 
Potsdam; Chapter 14 for Dresden, Leipzig, and Weimar; Chapter 15 for 
Munich; Chapter 16 for Bavaria and its castles; Chapter 17 for the 
Schwarzwald (Black Forest) and the Bodensee (Lake Constance); and 
Chapter 18 for Heidelberg and Nuremberg.
Berlin, Germany’s capital and largest city, is the starting point on Day 1 
of your two-week tour of Deutschland. Berlin is an enormous city, so 

 Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 41
start the morning by taking one of the sightseeing bus tours; to book 
one, contact Severin + Kühn, Kurfürstendamm 216 (% 030/880-4190; 
www.berlinerstadtrundfahrten.de). Devote your afternoon to 
exploring eastern Berlin, the most historic part of the city. Start at 
Potsdamer Platz, then head over to the Reichstag and take the elevator 
up to the new dome for a view of the city. Afterward, walk to the 
Brandenburg Gate and head east down Unter den Linden, the most 
famous boulevard in this part of the city. Eastern Berlin has numerous 
attractions: Make sure that you stop at the Gendarmenmarkt, a beauti-
ful neoclassical square, before you head up to the Museumsinsel 
(Museum Island) to visit the Pergamon Museum and/or the Altes 
Museum. From Museumsinsel, you can walk to Friedrichstrasse, the 
upscale shopping street.
Spend Day 2 on the western side of the city. Head over to the 
Charlottenburg neighborhood for a tour of Schloss Charlottenburg 
(Charlottenburg Palace) and a stroll through the palace gardens. Head 
back to the Ku-Damm, the most famous boulevard in western Berlin, for 
lunch or to find a cafe for Kaffee und Kuchen (coffee and cake). Stop by 
the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche (Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial 
Church), left as a colossal ruin after the devastation of World War II. 
Then spend a while strolling in the Tiergarten, Berlin’s most famous 
park. Have something fun lined up for the evening: Berlin has opera 
houses, major symphony orchestras, cabarets, and, of course, countless 
bars and clubs.
Spend the morning of Day 3 at Schloss Sanssouci in Potsdam, an easy 
trip from Berlin by S-Bahn. You want to give yourself at least four hours 
for this excursion, which includes a tour of Frederick the Great’s rococo 
palace and a walk through the landscaped grounds. You can eat near the 
palace or back in Berlin. In the afternoon, visit one of Berlin’s great 
museums, such as the Gemäldegalerie (Painting Gallery) or the new 
Jüdisches Museum (Jewish Museum). Plenty of entertainment options 
exist for the evening.
On Day 4, you see a different side of Germany (literally) in the eastern 
cities of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), which was 
ruled by the Communists until 1990. Dresden, on the Elbe River about 
two hours south of Berlin by train, is one of the great art cities of 
Germany. In Dresden, focus your attention on the Albertinum, a vast 
collection of treasures accrued by Saxon rulers; the Residenzschloss, 
the new home of the famed treasury known as the Green Vault; and the 
Zwinger, a restored royal palace that is home to four museums, the 
most important being the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (Old Masters 
Gallery). Make it a point to see the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady), 
which reopened in 2006 after being painstakingly restored. If you’re an 
opera lover, you won’t want to miss seeing a performance at the Semper 
Opera House. Spend the night in Dresden.
From Dresden on Day 5, you may want to take an excursion boat along 
the Elbe into the area known as Saxon Switzerland. From April through 

Part I: Introducing Germany 
42
September, 3- to 41⁄2-hour trips take place daily. Otherwise (or after-
ward), hop on a train for Leipzig, only an hour away. Leipzig is a busy, 
bustling city with a long musical tradition. Johann Sebastian Bach was 
the choirmaster of the famous Thomaskirche (St. Thomas Church), 
where he is buried, and the Bach Museum is dedicated to his life and 
works. If you love symphonic music, be sure to reserve a seat to hear 
the world-famous Gewandhaus Orchestra.
The city has two unusual museums that shed light on the GDR era: The 
Museum in der Runden Ecke documents the methods of the dreaded 
Stasi, East Germany’s secret police, and the Zeitgeschichtliches Forum 
Leipzig (Contemporary History Forum) examines all aspects of life in the 
GDR from 1945 to 1989. In 2005, the Museum der Bildenden Künste 
(Museum of Fine Arts) moved into a new building close to Marktplatz, 
the town’s liveliest square. Enjoy a dinner of regional food in the famous 
Auerbachs Keller, a vaulted underground restaurant.
From Leipzig, fast trains take less than an hour to reach Weimar, your 
destination for Day 6. This small, pretty city, filled with leafy parks and 
neoclassical buildings, is one of Germany’s literary meccas. Johann 
Wolfgang von Goethe and his friend, the great German dramatist 
Friedrich Schiller, lived here. Goethes Wohnhaus (Goethe’s House), por-
tions of which have been left much as they were in his lifetime, is the 
town’s most visited site. Weimar was one of Germany’s great centers of 
art and culture during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Visit the 
scene of Duchess Anna Amalia’s glittering salons in the Wittumspalais, a 
“city palace” near Goethe’s house, or the rococo library she endowed. In 
the early 20th century, the Bauhaus School of Art and Design operated 
in Weimar; today, you can visit the small Bauhaus Museum. Weimar has 
its dark side, too. Not far from the city center, on the site of a Nazi-era 
concentration camp, is the Gedenkstätte Buchenwald (Buchenwald 
Memorial). Stay overnight in Weimar, or take the train to Munich, the 
next stop on this itinerary; the journey takes about five hours.
Your destination for Day 7 is delightful Munich, Germany’s “secret capi-
tal.” With only two days, you have to make some decisions about what 
to see. Start your explorations at Marienplatz, the city’s main square, 
and then head over to the adjacent Viktualienmarkt to wander through 
this wonderland of an outdoor market. Choose a museum you’d espe-
cially like to visit: Most visitors make the Alte Pinakothek (Old Masters 
Gallery) their top priority, but the Deutsches Museum, devoted to sci-
ence and industry, is one of the most popular museums in the country. 
Stay overnight in Munich. You have innumerable ways to spend the eve-
ning in this cultural mecca: opera, symphony, pop concerts, theater, 
beer halls, beer gardens, and clubs.
Start Day 8 with a self-guided tour of the Residenz, Munich’s gigantic “in 
town” palace. You need at least two hours to visit the entire complex. 
After lunch near Marienplatz, stroll in the lovely Englischer Garten and 
stop for a drink or a meal at the park’s famous beer garden. At night, 

 Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 43
sample one of the city’s many entertainment options. Stay overnight in 
Munich.
On Day 9, you may want to consider renting a car for the next four days, 
but doing so is not essential. By car or train, from Munich make your 
way to Füssen, 6.5km (4 miles) from the most famous tourist attraction 
in all of Germany: Ludwig II’s Neuschwanstein Castle. Give yourself 
some leeway with time because the crowds (in summer) can be dense. 
You can also visit neighboring Hohenschwangau Castle, where Ludwig 
spent his childhood. If you have a car, visit the nearby Wieskirche 
(Church in the Meadow), a world-famous baroque masterpiece. If you’re 
without a car, stay overnight in Füssen or return to Munich. But first, 
enjoy a stroll through Füssen’s lovely historic quarter. If you have a car, 
you can continue on to Lindau, exploring the Bavarian Alps along the 
Deutsche Alpenstrasse (German Alpine Road). Some small Bavarian vil-
lage with a cozy Gasthaus (guesthouse) may catch your fancy.
From Munich or Füssen, the trip to Lindau for Day 10 is about three 
hours by train. Even if you’re driving from Füssen, travel time is about 
the same. Germany’s sunny southwestern corner comes as a surprise to 
many visitors. Here you find the Bodensee, the country’s largest lake 
and one of the largest bodies of water in Europe. Spend the day strolling 
in the sun (if the sun cooperates), sitting under an umbrella at a cafe, 
swimming, or taking a boat ride on the lake to the garden island of 
Mainau. Lindau’s sunny charms are reminiscent of Italy. The area has no 
important museums, so just take it easy.
You’ve no doubt heard about the Schwarzwald, your destination on Day 
11. This scenic area of forested hills, valleys, and mountains in the 
southwestern corner of Germany is famed for its health resorts, its 
hiking and recreational sports facilities, and its cuckoo clocks. Take 
your pick of cities to stay in. The charming and lively university town of 
Freiburg is about three hours by train from Lindau. In Freiburg, you can 
happily spend a few hours strolling through old streets lined by Bächle 
(little streams). Freiburg’s lovely Münster (Cathedral) and its surround-
ing square constitute the main sights in town. This wine town has vine-
yards nearby and yearly wine festivals. Baden-Baden, about 11⁄2 hours 
farther north by train, is one of Germany’s premier spa towns. This 
upscale, resort-oriented town offers fine hotels and restaurants, many 
expensive shops, and a famous casino. If you opt for Baden-Baden, be 
sure to “take the waters” at Friedrichsbad, a 125-year-old mineral-bath 
establishment; the experience takes about 31⁄2 hours.
On Day 12, make your way to Heidelberg, which is less than an hour by 
train from Baden-Baden or 21⁄2 to 3 hours from Freiburg. Everyone seems 
to love this ancient university town on the Neckar River. The Altstadt 
(Old City) is where you want to stay and where you want to wander. 
Hike or take the funicular train up the hillside to the famed Heidelberg 
Castle for a stunning view of the town and the river valley. The castle is 
mostly in ruins, but you can tour some of the restored rooms. Then take 
a relaxing boat ride down the Neckar. Stop in at the Kurpfälzisches 

Part I: Introducing Germany 
44
Museum (Museum of the Palatinate) for a look at Tilman Riemenschneider’s 
powerfully carved altarpiece. The museum’s restaurant is one of the 
nicest places to dine in Heidelberg.
On Day 13, hop on the Bahn (train) in Heidelberg and in 31⁄2 to 4 hours, 
you’re in Nuremberg, one of the most attractive towns in Germany. As 
in many German cities, the entire Altstadt is a pedestrian zone. You find 
squares with lovely fountains, a picturesque area alongside the Pegnitz 
River, the Kaiserburg (Imperial Castle), and fine Gothic churches. Give 
yourself at least two hours to visit the Germanisches Nationalmuseum 
(German National Museum), which covers the entire spectrum of 
German fine arts from its prehistoric beginnings to the present day. And 
then, if you’re in the mood, stop at the Spielzeugmuseum (Toy Museum) 
for a glimpse of the toys for which this city has long been famous.
On Day 14, head back to Berlin, where your tour began, to catch your 
flight home. The train ride from Nuremberg is about 51⁄2 hours. (Alterna-
tively, you can fly home from Frankfurt, which is a little more than 2 hours 
by train from Nuremberg, or you can depart from Munich, which is just 
under 2 hours from Nuremberg.) Sit back and enjoy the scenery. If you 
have time in any of these cities before your flight departs, find a cafe in 
which to sit and people-watch while you plan your next trip to Germany.
Discovering Germany with Kids
Face it: Traveling with kids isn’t always easy. You experience difficulties 
in the basic areas of food choices and sightseeing options. No kid I know 
wants to spend two hours wandering around a museum admiring old 
master paintings, or seated in a quiet, formal restaurant awaiting the 
main course. Luckily, some aspects of traveling in Germany — taking a 
train, for example, or visiting a castle — appeal to kids just because of 
the novelty. I slant this very general itinerary toward outdoor activities 
and give other options only when they seem relevant. Some hotels let 
children stay for free in their parents’ rooms; at the ones that don’t, you 
can pay a few euros more and request an extra bed. When it comes time 
to eat, look for casual bistros, cafes, or even outdoor food stands (yes, 
you’ll also find American-style fast-food restaurants in all midsize and 
large cities). Public transportation is a priority in every German city, 
with reduced rates for kids.
Spend Day 1 in Munich. The entire inner city is a car-free pedestrian 
zone where you and your kids can stroll with ease. You can find plenty 
of outdoor cafes around Marienplatz, the city’s main square; while 
there, be sure to catch the Glockenspiel show at 11 a.m. on the spire of 
the Rathaus. Right next to Marienplatz is the Viktualienmarkt, the best 
outdoor market in Germany and a great place to have a casual lunch. 
Later, you may want to take a train or subway over to the Englischer 
Garten (English Garden), one of the largest and most beautiful city parks 
in Europe, where you can wander along the tree-shaded walks, dance in 

 Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 45
the meadows, or sit in the famous beer garden (nonalcoholic refresh-
ments available for the kids). Alternatively, head over to the kid-friendly 
Deutsche Museum, the largest science-and-technology museum in the 
world. It’s loaded with interesting stuff for kids and adults.
On Day 2, Schloss Nymphenburg is on the top of your list. The Schloss 
(palace) is a breeze to get to (it’s right in the city on the streetcar line), 
and 500-acre Nymphenburg Park is grand and inviting, with formal, 
French-style gardens behind the palace and an English-style park with 
quiet meadows, forested paths, and some intriguing buildings, including 
an 18th-century swimming pool and a baroque hunting lodge. If you 
didn’t make it to the Deutsches Museum the day before, you can head 
over there in the afternoon.
On Day 3, you can rent a car or take the train to Garmisch-Partenkirchen 
in the Bavarian Alps south of Munich. Here you’re going to ascend the 
Zugspitze, Germany’s highest peak (2,960m/9,720 ft.). A cog railway and 
a cable car take you up and bring you back — a fascinating treat for kids. 
The view from the summit is — what else? — spectacular. If you’re a 
dedicated hiker, the area around Garmisch-Partenkirchen is magnificent 
hiking country. Most hikes take an energetic four to five hours, but some 
of them are shorter and easy enough for children. Stay overnight in 
Garmisch. Good skiing and ice-skating are available all winter.
Drive or take the train to Füssen on Day 4, and then drive or take a bus 
to Neuschwanstein, “Mad” Ludwig’s fairy-tale castle. Germany’s most-
visited tourist attraction perches on a rocky spur that requires a good 
uphill hike to reach. You also can reach the castle by bus or horse-
drawn cab. The forested hills all around Neuschwanstein and neighbor-
ing Hohenschwangau Castle are full of excellent hiking paths. Stay 
overnight in Füssen and explore the charming old town on foot.
Bodensee (Lake Constance) is your destination for Day 5. By car or train 
make your way to Lindau, a sunny flower-filled resort town that sits on 
its own small island in the Bodensee. Lindau is virtually car-free, so you 
and the kids can easily walk everywhere. The area around Bodensee is 
Germany’s sunniest corner, and the lake is clean enough for swimming. 
You can bike along the shore or relax on an excursion boat ride to the 
island of Mainau, a plant-lover’s paradise. Spend the night in Lindau.
Ride the train or drive north to Freiburg, your headquarters in the 
Schwarzwald (Black Forest) on Day 6. If you’re traveling by train, I sug-
gest that you rent a car for just one day. From Freiburg you can make an 
easy 145km (90-mile) circuit through a scenic part of the Schwarzwald, 
with stops for short hikes and cable-car rides to the top of the Belchen, 
a famous mile-high peak with spectacular views of the Rhine plain, and 
to the 1,450m (4,750-ft.) summit of a peak called Seebuck. On this drive, 
you can stop at two Schwarzwald lakes, the Schluchsee and Titisee.
On Day 7, make your way back to Frankfurt or Munich for the trip home. 
How about that — the kids actually had a good time!

Part I: Introducing Germany

Prosit! Germany for Wine Lovers
When you raise a glass of wine in Germany, the toast often is a simple 
“Prosit!” (pronounced prohst). This itinerary takes you to the wine 
regions in western Germany. The trip begins and ends in Frankfurt. You 
may want to incorporate this four-day itinerary into a longer trip. For 
more information, see Chapter 17 for the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) 
and the Bodensee (Lake Constance) and Chapter 19 for Cologne and 
sights along the Rhine.
From Frankfurt airport, you can hop on a train on Day 1 and be in 
Freiburg in about two hours. Or you may want to rent a car in Frankfurt 
for the duration of the trip. Freiburg, a lively university town in the 
Schwarzwald, is surrounded by more vineyards than any other city in 
Germany. On the last weekend in June, the city celebrates with a four-
day wine festival that includes public tastings. Weinkost is another 
wine-tasting event in mid-August. Most of the grapes grow on the lower 
slopes of the nearby Kaiserstühl (Emperor’s Throne), a volcanic massif. 
The young, light Silvaner wine is an ideal accompaniment to Spargel 
(white asparagus) in May. For a great meal with regional wines, dine at 
Zum Roten Bären, the oldest inn in Freiburg.
Head to Cologne on the River Rhine for Day 2. The train trip from 
Freiburg takes about four hours. From Cologne, by car or boat, you can 
explore the neighboring wine country. In the Rheingau wine district, a 
45km (27-mile) stretch of the Rhine between the towns of Biebrich and 
Bingen, wine has been produced since Roman times. Rheingau Rieslings 
rank among the best white wines made anywhere. You can drive 
through this area on a day trip from Cologne. Or you can take a Rhine 
cruise between Koblenz and Mainz, a scenic winegrowing region.
The Mosel Valley, southwest of Cologne, is another scenic winegrowing 
region and your destination on Day 3. The valley follows the course of 
the Mosel River for more than 160km (100 miles) between Trier and 
Koblenz. Beautiful scenery and fine wines make this a prime area for lei-
surely exploration. The easiest way to enjoy a cruise down the Mosel 
River is to take a train to Koblenz. Between late April and the third week 
in October, cruises depart daily from Koblenz to Cochem, a picturesque 
wine village surrounded by vineyards and a popular spot for wine tast-
ings and festivals. Mosel-Wein-Woche (Mosel Wine Week), which takes 
place the first week in June, celebrates the region’s wines with tasting 
booths and a street fair; Weinfest takes place the last weekend of 
August. The half-timbered Alte Thorschenke in Cochem, both a hotel 
and a wine restaurant, is one of the oldest and best-known establish-
ments along the Mosel.
From Cochem, Cologne, or Freiburg, make your way back to Frankfurt 
on Day 4. If you have a few more days, you can continue your tasting 
tour of Germany. Wherever you go, look for the local Weinstube (wine 
tavern), a convivial spot to sample Germany’s many fine vintages.

Planning Your Trip 
to Germany

In this part . . .
T
his part helps you with the practical details of planning 
your trip to Germany. In Chapter 5, I get into the nitty-
gritty of Geld (money) so you have an approximate idea of 
what things cost and how to use ATMs, credit cards, and trav-
eler’s checks. In Chapter 6, I go over the transportation 
options for getting you to Germany, including information on 
which airlines fl y into Germany, guided and package tours, 
and how to get the best fare. In Chapter 7, I tell you about 
traveling through Germany by train, car, plane, and boat. In 
Chapter 8, I discuss all the various accommodations options, 
outlining the kinds of hotels and guesthouses that you’ll fi nd, 
explaining what hotel rack rates are, and offering suggestions 
for landing the best room at the best price. In Chapter 9, I 
offer advice and tips for visitors with special needs and inter-
ests: families, seniors, travelers with disabilities, and gay and 
lesbian travelers. I load Chapter 10 with information about 
getting a passport, buying travel and medical insurance, using 
cellphones and e-mail in Germany, and adhering to airport 
security measures.

S
o, you want to go to Germany. You’re excited and eager to pack. But 
can you really afford the trip? At this point, a financial reality check 
is in order. That’s why this chapter is all about Geld (pronounced gelt, 
meaning money). You may have heard that Germany is an expensive 
country — but just how expensive? What does a hotel in Munich cost? 
How much does a train ticket cost for travel from Berlin down to Bavaria, 
for instance? And how much is a meal in a nice restaurant after you get 
there? This chapter points you toward all the answers.
 
 Although you may think a trip to Germany is prohibitively expensive 
because of the transatlantic flight, you can often find bargain airfares to 
Frankfurt and Munich, the two German airports with several direct inter-
national flights. Adding everything up, your trip to Germany — even if you 
visit Munich and/or Berlin, the two most expensive German cities — can 
actually cost less than a trip to New York, San Francisco, or Los Angeles.
Planning Your Budget
Planning a budget for your trip to Germany isn’t as difficult as you may 
think. To come up with a workable figure, you need to break down your 
trip into its various components: airfare, transportation while there, 
hotels, meals, entertainment, and so on. In the following sections, I pro-
vide vital clues on how to create a realistic budget that works for you.
Transportation costs
Your first big outlay is going to be for airfare. In Chapter 6, I tell you 
about flying to Germany and help you with some strategies for finding 
the cheapest airline fares. Based on my own experience, I can tell you 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany 
50
that finding a nonstop, round-trip fare from a major city on the West 
Coast of the U.S. to Frankfurt is possible for about $700 to $900 during 
low season and $1,000 to $1,200 during high season. From New York or 
Boston, you probably can find flights for $600 to $800 in low season and 
$700 to $1,000 in high season. Please note that these are ballpark figures 
for economy-class seats found by using every cost-saving trick in the 
book, including advance purchase. Finding flights that cost less is quite 
possible, but so is finding flights that cost a whole lot more. Fares fluctu-
ate constantly, so be on the lookout for special deals from cities with 
direct flights to Germany.
Your travel costs within Germany depend on how you plan to travel 
around the country after you arrive.
 
 Here’s some good news: You won’t need to rent a car in any German city 
because public transportation is so good. That saves you a bundle. You 
can also tour by train throughout the whole of Germany without ever rent-
ing a car. Keep in mind, however, that in some areas, such as Bavaria and 
the Schwarzwald (Black Forest), having a car makes exploration of the 
countryside much easier. For more information on renting a car in 
Germany, see Chapter 7.
Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Munich all have subway sys-
tems called the U-Bahn (short for Untergrundbahn, or underground 
train). U-Bahns are fast, convenient, and easy to use. The same cities 
also have light-rail or aboveground trains called the S-Bahn and a 
system of trams or streetcars and buses. Special reduced-price transpor-
tation passes are good for a full day (Tageskarten) or longer on all forms 
of public transportation. The passes make getting around German cities 
fairly inexpensive (approximately $7–$10 per day). The savings are even 
greater if two or more people, or a family with kids, are traveling 
together, using a Gruppenkarte (group ticket). Additionally, many cities 
in Germany sell special passes that include public transportation and 
free or reduced-price admission to various attractions. I mention these 
money-saving cards in the city sections of this guide whenever they’re 
available and worthwhile.
In smaller towns and cities of Germany, you can walk almost every-
where, because city centers are so compact and close to the train sta-
tions. The historic inner-city area of German cities nearly always is 
called the Altstadt (Old City). If you don’t want to walk, you can hop on a 
bus or tram. If you’re traveling by train and want to see some of 
Germany’s great castles, such as Neuschwanstein in Bavaria, you may 
need to take a local bus or taxi from the nearest town (Füssen, for 
Neuschwanstein) to the castle.
 
 If you’re planning to travel around Germany by train, you can save money 
by buying a German Rail Pass before you leave home. I talk more about 
these cost-cutting train passes and the popular Eurailpass in Chapter 7. 
You can order them through a travel agent or by calling Rail Europe at

Lodging expenses
A big chunk of your budget will be the cost of your hotel or other accom-
modations. That cost will be higher in Munich and Berlin than anywhere 
else in Germany. Overall, however, you’ll find that hotels throughout 
Germany are reasonably priced (and practically a bargain when com-
pared to prices in other European countries).
 
 Nearly all hotels throughout Germany (except for boutique or five-star 
luxury hotels) include a buffet breakfast as part of the room rate.
As a general rule, you can always find a double room in a good hotel in 
Germany for less than 150€ ($203) a night and sometimes for less than 
100€ ($135) a night. But because rates vary from one hotel to the next, 
depending on their respective government-appointed categories (one-
star, two-star, and so on), giving a reliable average is difficult. For the 
recommendations in this guide, however, the rates at inexpensive hotels 
in Munich or Berlin, the major cities, generally are less than 125€ ($169), 
moderate hotels run from 126€ to 175€ ($170–$236), and expensive 
hotels cost from 176€ to 225€ ($238–$304). After that, you hit the high 
end of 226€ ($305) and up. As you can see, German hotel prices are a rel-
ative bargain when compared to hotel prices in the U.S. and in other 
European countries. See Chapter 8 for information on what to expect in 
each price range and for a discussion of your lodging options and how 
to get the best rate.
Outside of Munich and Berlin, hotel rates are lower, generally from 80€ 
to 150€ ($108–$202) per double room per night, including breakfast. But 
you can still find plenty of opportunities to drop a king’s ransom for a 
hotel, especially in some of the truly elegant five-star properties. Make 
sure to ask about special deals wherever you stay. Many hotels in the 
Bavarian countryside, for instance, offer bed, breakfast, lunch, and a full 
dinner at bargain prices. Throughout the country, hotels offer special 
price breaks for weekends (Wochenende) and during the summer (gen-
erally July and Aug). In some cases, the price drops so dramatically that 
you can stay in a double room at a five-star luxury hotel for less than 
175€ ($236) per night.
Dining expenses
Food in Germany often is characterized as heavy. Although that may 
be true, traditional German food also is ganz schmackhaftig (very tasty). 
In nearly every town and village throughout Germany, you can find a 
Ratskeller (restaurant beneath a town hall), a beer hall, a Weinstube 
(restaurant where wine is the primary beverage served), or some other 
kind of nonfancy restaurant where you can dine inexpensively and well 
and where you can enjoy your meal among the locals. Traditional food, 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany 
52
however, isn’t the only cuisine you’ll find in Germany. In recent years, 
large cities like Berlin and Munich have emerged as international food 
capitals. Of course, eating at top restaurants, no matter where you are, 
is going to cost, but you’ll find that many of the best restaurants in 
Berlin, Munich, and elsewhere offer special fixed-price meals that can be 
real bargains.
As with hotels, food is more expensive in big cities like Berlin and 
Munich. When eating lunch and dinner at moderately priced restaurants 
in Berlin, you can expect to pay from 35€ to 50€ ($47–$67) per person 
per day (assuming your hotel rate includes breakfast), and that doesn’t 
include beer or wine. Outside of Berlin or Munich, unless you splurge on 
really high-priced restaurants, expect your daily food cost to be about 
25€ to 40€ ($34–$54). Throughout most of Germany, dinner for two at a 
good, mid-priced restaurant averages about 35€ ($47) including beer.
If you eat breakfast at a cafe rather than your hotel, and you’re content 
with coffee and a roll at a stand-up counter (or a Starbucks), expect to 
pay about 4€ to 7€ ($5.40–$9.45) anywhere in the country. But remem-
ber, a buffet breakfast nearly always is included in your hotel cost. Only 
at luxury hotels do you have to pay extra for breakfast — usually 18€ to 
26€ ($24–$35) — but the buffet breakfast invariably is fabulous and so 
filling that you can skip lunch or get by with just a snack. Afternoon 
Kaffee und Kuchen (coffee and cake) sets you back about 7€ or 8€ ($9.45 
or $11) anywhere in Germany.
Sightseeing expenses
 
 Your budget for admission fees depends, of course, on what you want to 
see. Fortunately, sightseeing in Germany is fairly inexpensive. Finding 
a museum that costs more than 8€ ($11) is rare. And some of the top 
sights — such as the Reichstag in Berlin or the Frauenkirche and 
Englischer Garten in Munich — are free. Admission to Neuschwanstein, 
the Bavarian castle that is Germany’s top attraction, costs only 9€ ($12). 
In addition, if you’re a senior or a student, you can often get a reduced-
price admission. The major cities — Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, for exam-
ple — sell special “Welcome” cards that get you into several museums for 
a reduced rate (and may include public transportation as well).
 
 Strolling down Berlin’s great avenues, Kurfürstendamm or Unter den 
Linden, or viewing the Brandenburg Gate, is kostenlos (free). In fact, 
exploring by foot in almost any German town is a good way to soak up the 
local culture free of charge.
As a general rule, expect to pay from 3€ to 7€ ($4.05–$9.45) for admis-
sion to museums and local attractions outside of the big cities. In some 
locations, the top attraction is a cable car that can whisk you to the top 
of a famous peak for a spectacular view. The most expensive ride is to 
the top of the Zugspitze, Germany’s highest mountain, and back again; 
the cost for adults is 45€ ($61). Most cable cars cost much less, gener-
ally around 6€ ($8.10) round-trip. Sightseeing boat excursions typically 

 Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 53
are 8€ to 15€ ($11–$20), depending on the duration of the trip. City sight-
seeing tours by bus cost from 10€ to 25€ ($14–$34).
Shopping and nightlife costs
Shopping and entertainment are the most flexible parts of your budget. 
You don’t have to buy anything at all, and you can go for an evening 
stroll instead of going to a concert or dancing at a club. You know what 
you want. Flip through the shopping and nightlife options of each desti-
nation chapter. If anything strikes you as something you can’t do with-
out, budget accordingly. Keep in mind that a large glass of beer sets you 
back about 3€ to 4€ ($4.05–$5.40), a glass of good German wine about 5€ 
($6.75), and an opera ticket in either Berlin or Munich anywhere from 
10€ to 100€ ($43–$135). Berlin, especially, is a late-night city, so you may 
want to check out the club scene while you’re there; cover charges 
rarely are more than 5€ ($6.75), but drinks other than beer can be pricey.
Tables 5-1 and 5-2 give you an idea of what things typically cost in Berlin 
and the rest of the country. Keep in mind that the hotel rates I quote 
here are rack rates, the highest undiscounted rate charged by a hotel. At 
mid-priced and luxury hotels you can almost always find a lower rate 
than the one listed here simply by checking the hotel’s Web site and 
booking in advance.

Handling Money
In January 2002, Germany’s unit of currency changed from the Deutsche 
Mark to the euro. One euro is divided into 100 cents. Coins come in 
denominations of 1¢, 2¢, 5¢, 10¢, 20¢, 50¢, 1€, and 2€. Notes are available 
in 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 denominations. As with any unfamiliar 
currency, euros take a bit of getting used to. The coins have different 
sizes, shapes, and weights according to value. Each bank-note denomi-
nation has its own color.
The exchange rate, which fluctuates daily, is the rate you get when you 
use your own currency to buy euros. In general, 1€ = $1.35. I use this 
approximate exchange rate for prices in this book. (If the U.S. price is 
less than $10, I round it off to the nearest nickel; if more than $10, to the 
nearest dollar.)
 
 When you’re about to leave on your trip, check with your bank or look in 
the newspaper to find out the current rate. You also can check currency 
conversions online at www.xe.com.

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany 
56
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an auto-
mated teller machine (ATM). In German cities, you find 24-hour ATMs 
(often called Geldautomat) in airports, train stations, and outside banks. 
Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com) and PLUS (% 800-
843-7587; www.visa.com) are the most popular networks; look at the 
back of your bank card to see which network you’re on, then call or 
check online for ATM locations at your destination.
 
 Make sure you know your personal identification number (PIN) before 
you leave home, and be sure to find out your daily withdrawal limit before 
you depart. At some banks, the amount you can withdraw must be in a 
checking (not a savings) account. Also keep in mind that many banks 
impose a fee every time your card is used at a different bank’s ATM, and 
that fee can be higher for international transactions (up to $5 or more) 
than for domestic ones. In addition, the bank from which you withdraw 
cash may charge its own ATM fee. For international withdrawal fees, ask 
your bank.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conve-
nient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively 
good exchange rates. You also can withdraw cash advances from your 
credit cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve 
forgotten yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on 
the back of your credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually 
takes five to seven business days, though some banks provide the 
number over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or 
some other personal information.
 
 Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad, many banks now 
assess a 1 percent to 3 percent “transaction fee” on all charges you incur 
abroad. But credit cards still may be the smart way to go when you factor 
in things like high ATM fees and higher traveler’s check exchange rates 
and service fees.
 
 I strongly recommend that you notify your credit card company of any 
impending trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when the 
card is used numerous times in a foreign destination and block your 
charges (I speak from experience here). Even if you don’t call your credit 
card company in advance, you can always call the card’s toll-free emer-
gency number if a charge is refused — a good reason to carry the phone 
number with you. But perhaps the most important lesson here is to carry 
more than one card with you on your trip; a card may not work for any 
number of reasons, so having a backup is the smart way to go.
 
 In smaller German towns and villages, many pensions (bed-and-break-
fasts) with one to three guest rooms operate on a cash-only basis, as do 
some restaurants. Don’t assume that every business in Germany will 

 Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 57
accept your credit card. Because of the worldwide credit crisis, some 
German businesses (mostly restaurants) no longer accept U.S. credit cards.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because every city in 
Germany has 24-hour ATMs that enable you to withdraw cash (in euros) 
as you need it. Cashing traveler’s checks is more time-consuming and 
can end up costing more because you must go to a bank or money-
exchange service and pay a check-cashing fee.
American Express (% 800-807-6233 or % 800-221-7282 for card holders — 
this number accepts collect calls, offers service in several foreign lan-
guages, and exempts Amex gold and platinum cardholders from the 1 
percent fee); Thomas Cook (% 0871-895-0060 in the U.K.), Visa (% 800-
732-1322); and MasterCard (% 800-223-9920).Visa, and MasterCard 
offer foreign currency traveler’s checks, useful if you’re traveling to 
Germany and other European countries that use the euro. These checks 
don’t have to be changed at a bank or currency exchange; they’re 
accepted at many locations just as cash would be.
 If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their 
serial numbers separate from your checks in case they’re stolen or lost. 
You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a lost or stolen wallet
Be sure to contact all your credit card companies the minute you discover 
that your wallet has been lost or stolen, and file a report at the nearest 
police precinct. Your credit card company or insurer may require a police 
report number or record of the loss. Most credit card companies have 
emergency toll-free numbers to call if your card is lost or stolen; your 
credit card company may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately 
or deliver an emergency credit card in a day or two. Visa’s emergency 
number is % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994. American Express cardhold-
ers and traveler’s check holders should call % 800-221-7282. MasterCard 
holders should call % 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111. For other credit 
cards, call the toll-free number directory at % 800-555-1212.
Changing your currency in Germany
You can easily change your noneuro cash or traveler’s checks by using a currency-
exchange service called a Geldwechsel or bureau de change. These services are avail-
able in German airports, any branch of a major bank, all major rail stations, post offices 
countrywide, many tourist information offices, and American Express offices. Currency-
exchange windows in airports and rail stations generally are open daily from 6 a.m. to 
10 p.m. Banks generally are open weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2:30 to 4 p.m.

If you need emergency cash over the weekend, when banks are closed, 
you can have money wired to you via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; 
www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet, 
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and 
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately; 
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability 
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are 
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your 
airline and explain the situation; the airline may allow you to board the 
plane if you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy 
of the police report you’ve filed.
Taking Taxes into Account
Germany’s version of a sales tax, called the Mehrwertsteuer (abbrevi-
ated MWST) or value-added tax (VAT), amounts to 16 percent. This 
hefty percentage is automatically figured into the total prices of con-
sumer goods and hotel and restaurant bills. (The general hotel and res-
taurant prices in this book include VAT.) This tax isn’t a hidden expense, 
and you can’t avoid paying it.
 
 If you’re not a resident of the European Union, you can get a VAT refund 
on purchases made in Germany (excluding hotel and restaurant bills). To 
receive a refund, shop at stores displaying a tax-free shopping sign. Most 
stores have a minimum amount that you must spend to qualify for the 
refund. When you make a qualifying purchase, you receive a tax-free 
voucher, which must be completed by the store and must have a copy of 
your sales receipt attached to it. Before checking your luggage upon your 
departure from Germany, have the voucher stamped by German Customs 
to confirm that the goods have been exported. Then redeem the voucher 
for cash (euros or dollars) at a Europe Tax-Free Shopping window, 
located at all major airports, border crossings, ferry ports, and railroad 
stations.
A Tip about Tipping
 
 As a general rule, Germany isn’t a country where you must tip excessively, 
unless, of course, you’re staying in an expensive luxury hotel with porters 
who carry your bags (1€/$1.35 per bag carried), maids who service your 
room (3€–5€/$4.05–$6.75 per day), and doormen who hail you a cab 
(1€/$1.35 per successful hail). Otherwise, service charges are included in 

 Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 59
the bill. If you’re paying for a cab, round the fare up to the next euro and 
add another euro for good measure. Likewise in restaurants: Round the 
bill up to the next euro, and if the service has been very good, you can add 
5 percent.

N
ow that you’ve decided to visit Deutschland (Germany, that is), 
you need to find a way to get there. You may be flying internation-
ally or arriving by train or boat from another destination in Europe. In 
this chapter, I discuss getting you to Germany. What are your options 
for direct, nonstop flights? How can you save money on your flight (and 
your hotel)? What are the pros and cons of taking an escorted tour? You 
find answers to your basic travel questions here.
Finding Out Which Airlines Fly Where
In Germany, an airport is called a Flughafen (floog-haf-en). Germany has 
several airports, but direct flights from the United States fly only into 
Berlin, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, and Munich. You can also fly to Cologne, 
Nuremberg, Stuttgart, and other cities in Germany, but if you’re coming 
from the United States, these routes require a change of planes — usu-
ally in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, London, or Paris. See the 
Quick Concierge at the back of this book for a list of the main interna-
tional carriers with direct flights into Germany from the United States, 
Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia.
Flying into Frankfurt
Frankfurt airport, called Flughafen Frankfurt Main, is Germany’s main 
international hub. The following airlines offer direct flights:
 
✓ Lufthansa, Germany’s national carrier (now partnered with United 
Airlines and Air Canada), has direct flights to Frankfurt from Atlanta, 
Boston, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, 
Miami, Newark, JFK, Philadelphia, Portland (Oregon), San Francisco, 
and Washington, D.C., as well as from Toronto and Vancouver.

 Chapter 6: Getting to Germany 61
 
✓ American Airlines has nonstop service to Frankfurt from Dallas/
Fort Worth, Chicago, and Miami.
 
✓ Delta Air Lines (now partnered with Northwest Airlines) has daily 
nonstops from Newark and Atlanta.
 
✓ Northwest Airlines (partnered with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and 
Delta) flies nonstop to Frankfurt from Boston, Chicago, 
Minneapolis/St. Paul, and Washington, D.C.
 
✓ United Airlines offers nonstop service to Frankfurt from Chicago 
and Washington, D.C.
 
✓ British Airways flies direct to Frankfurt from London.
 
✓ Qantas flies to Frankfurt from Melbourne and Sydney, Australia.
Flights to other cities in Germany from Frankfurt rarely take more than 
11⁄2 hours. The airport has its own train station, so you can fly in, hop on 
a train, and be off to your first destination. For more information on the 
Frankfurt airport, see Chapter 20.
Flying into other German airports
Here’s a brief rundown of other major airports in Germany and some of 
the airlines that fly into them. In each city section of this guide, I give 
you more specific information about how to get into the city from the 
airport.
 
✓ Munich: Franz Josef Strauss International Airport, located 29km 
(18 miles) northeast of the city center, is Germany’s second-largest 
airport. Opened in 1992, this airport is among the most modern and 
efficient in the world and is completely accessible for the disabled. 
Lufthansa flies nonstop to Munich from Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, 
Newark, JFK, San Francisco, Washington D.C., and London; Delta 
flies nonstop from Atlanta; United flies nonstop from Chicago and 
Washington D.C.; and British Airways flies nonstop from London. 
See Chapter 15 for more about flying into Munich.
 
✓ Berlin: Berlin has two airports, but you probably will fly into Tegel, 
which is quite small but has easy public transportation into central 
Berlin. From Berlin, you can easily reach other cities in eastern 
Germany by train, especially Dresden, Leipzig, and Weimar (all cov-
ered in Chapter 14), and you’re close to Hamburg and the northern 
Hanseatic cities (see Chapter 13). Delta currently has a direct flight 
to Berlin from JFK; Continental has one from Newark; British 
Airways flies direct from London. See Chapter 11 for a complete 
description of Berlin’s airports.
 
✓ Cologne: Konrad-Adenauer-Flughafen Köln/Bonn is a good spot to 
land whenever you’re planning to tour western Germany and the 
Rhineland wine country. Excursion boats leave from Cologne for 
trips on the Rhine and other German rivers (see Chapter 19). 
Although no direct flights are scheduled from the U.S., British 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany 
62
Airways and British Midland fly direct to Cologne from the United 
Kingdom. Direct flights also are scheduled from most major 
European cities.
 
✓ Düsseldorf: Although I don’t cover Düsseldorf in this guidebook 
(the closest city that I cover is Cologne in Chapter 19), you never-
theless can use the airport in Düsseldorf as an alternative to Cologne. 
From Düsseldorf, reaching the Rhine Valley is easy. Lufthansa and 
Continental offer direct flights from Newark. Aer Lingus flies non-
stop from Dublin. British Midland has flights from London.
 
✓ Hamburg: Direct flights to Flughafen Hamburg-Fuhlsbüttel are sched-
uled from most major European cities, but none arrives directly from 
the United States. Delta offers service from Atlanta via Paris.
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other indus-
try. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a coach seat is 
a coach seat is a . . .), and yet prices can vary by hundreds of dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility of being able to buy their 
tickets at the last minute and changing their itineraries at a moment’s 
notice — and who want to get home before the weekend — pay a pre-
mium rate, known as the full fare.
 
 If you can book your ticket far in advance, you stay overnight Saturday, 
and you’re willing to travel midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can qual-
ify for the least-expensive price — usually a fraction of the full fare. 
Obviously, planning ahead pays.
Search the Internet for cheap fares. The most popular online travel agen-
cies are Travelocity (www.travelocity.com or www.travelocity.
co.uk); Expedia (www.expedia.com, www.expedia.ca, or www.
expedia.co.uk); and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com). In the U.K., go to 
Travelsupermarket.com (% 0845/345-5708), a flight search engine that 
offers flight comparisons for the budget airlines. Other Web sites for 
booking airline tickets online include Cheapflights.com, SmarterTravel 
(www.smartertravel.com), Priceline.com, and Opodo (www.opodo.
co.uk). Meta search sites (which find and then direct you to airline and 
hotel Web sites for booking) include SideStep (www.sidestep.com) 
and Kayak (www.kayak.com) — the latter includes fares for budget car-
riers like JetBlue and Spirit as well as the major airlines. Lastminute.com 
is a great source for last-minute flights and getaways. In addition, most 
airlines offer online-only fares that even their phone agents know noth-
ing about.
Watch local newspapers for promotional specials or fare wars, when 
airlines lower prices on their most popular routes. Also keep an eye on 
price fluctuations and deals at Web sites such as Airfarewatchdog.com 
and Farecast (www.farecast.com).

 Chapter 6: Getting to Germany 63
The airlines also periodically hold sales in which they lower the prices 
on their most popular routes, such as those to Frankfurt and Munich. 
These fares have advance-purchase requirements and date-of-travel 
restrictions, but you can’t beat the prices. As you plan your vacation, 
keep your eyes open for these sales, which tend to take place in seasons 
of low travel volume: October through November and January through 
March in Germany.
Frequent-flier membership doesn’t cost a cent, but membership may 
entitle you to better seats, faster response to phone inquiries, and 
prompter service if your luggage is stolen or your flight is canceled or 
delayed, or if you want to change your seat (especially after you’ve racked 
up some miles). And you don’t have to fly to earn points; frequent-flier 
credit cards can earn you thousands of miles for doing your everyday 
shopping. With more than 70 mileage awards programs on the market, 
consumers have never had more options. Investigate the program details 
of your favorite airlines before you sink points into any one. Consider 
which airlines have hubs in the airport nearest you, and, of those carri-
ers, which have the most advantageous alliances, given your most common 
routes. To play the frequent-flier game to your best advantage, consult 
the community bulletin boards on FlyerTalk (www.flyertalk.com) or 
go to Randy Petersen’s InsideFlyer (www.insideflyer.com). Petersen 
and friends review all the programs in detail and post regular updates 
on changes in policies and trends.
Arriving by Other Means
Germany is accessible by land and by sea, and from all directions, so it’s 
easy to include as part of a larger European trip.
Traveling by train
Germany is extremely well connected by train to the rest of Europe. 
Perhaps you’re flying into Paris and from there going on to Berlin or 
Heidelberg as part of your European dream vacation. Have no fear. You 
can reach all major German cities by train with ease. Trains are very 
much a part of the German (and European) travel ethic. EuroCity (EC) 
trains connect Germany with neighboring countries, and sleek, high-
speed Thalys trains link Cologne and Düsseldorf with Paris and Brussels. 
When you’re traveling between countries, border formalities, such as 
passport checks, are taken care of onboard the train. Major cities, such 
as Berlin and Hamburg, have more than one station, but you almost 
always find one main or central inner-city station called a Hauptbahnhof 
(howpt-bahn-hof). In every city section of this guide, I tell you how to get 
into the city center from the train station, which usually is conveniently 
located.
In Chapter 7, I discuss traveling around Germany by train and the various 
rail passes that can cut down on transportation costs. For more informa-
tion about trains in Europe, contact Rail Europe (% 888-382-7245 in the 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany 
64
U.S. or 800-361-7245 in Canada; www.raileurope.com); its Web site 
provides useful trip-planning information on train schedules and travel 
times, promotional offers, fares, and rail-pass prices.
Arriving by boat
Germany’s northern coast lies along the Baltic and North seas. International 
ferry services are available from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, 
Poland, Russia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. DFDS Seaways (% 800-
533-3755, ext. 114, in the U.S. and Canada; www.seaeurope.com) pro-
vides ferry service from Harwich, England, to Hamburg; the journey 
takes 20 hours. Silja Lines (same telephone and Web site as for DFDS 
Seaways) sails from Helsinki across the Baltic to Rostock in northern 
Germany.
Joining an Escorted Tour
Some travelers to foreign destinations prefer escorted tours. The tour 
company takes care of all the details and tells you what to expect on 
each leg of your journey. You know your costs upfront, so you don’t 
encounter many surprises. Escorted tours can take you to the maximum 
number of sights in the minimum amount of time with the least amount 
of hassle.
 
 If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially when the tour operator asks you to pay 
upfront. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour opera-
tor doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you paid 
for, you have no reason to think that it’ll fulfill its insurance obligations 
either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (See Chapter 
10 for more on travel insurance.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you 
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few 
simple questions before you buy:
 
✓ What is the cancellation policy? How late can you cancel if you 
can’t go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? Do you get a refund if 
the operator cancels?
 
✓ How jampacked is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit 
25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to relax 
or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not returning to your 
hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. sounds like a grind, certain escorted tours 
may not be for you.
 
✓ How big is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you 
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators 
may be evasive about providing this fact, because they may not 
know the exact size of the group until everybody has made their 
reservations, but they should be able to give you a rough estimate.

 Chapter 6: Getting to Germany 65
 
✓ What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may be 
required to get yourself to and from the airports at your own 
expense. A box lunch may be included in an excursion, but drinks 
may be extra. Beer may be included but not wine. How much flexi-
bility does the tour offer? Can you opt out of certain activities, or 
does the bus leave once a day, with no exceptions? Are all your 
meals planned in advance?
Several companies offer escorted tours to Berlin, Munich, and destina-
tions in the rest of Germany (or include Germany in a Europe-wide tour). 
Many escorted-tour companies cater to special interests, such as castles 
on the Rhine or the 2010 Oberammergau Passion play, while others are 
more general. A good travel agent can help you find a tour that suits 
your particular interests. The following companies offer escorted tours 
to Germany:
 
✓ Brendan Worldwide Vacations (% 800-421-8446; www.brendan
vacations.com) offers escorted grand and highlight tours that 
cover most of Germany, including Berlin, Cologne, Leipzig, Munich, 
Neuschwanstein, and the Schwarzwald (Black Forest), plus an 
escorted tour of German Christmas markets.
 
✓ Brennan Vacations (% 800-237-7249; www.brennanvactions.
com) offers Rhine cruises and provides escorted tours of German 
towns and vineyards along the way.
 
✓ Contiki Holidays (% 866-266-8454; www.contiki.com) provides 
escorted tours for 18- to 35-year-olds and has offices in the United 
States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Its offerings 
change yearly, but there’s usually a multi-country tour that includes 
stops in the Rhine Valley and Munich, and an escorted seven-day 
Berlin–Prague trip.
 
✓ Globus (www.globusjourneys.com) offers the most comprehen-
sive introductory tours of Germany, including a 12-day “German 
Highlights” and a 15-day “Best of Germany” itinerary with stops in 
Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt, Nuremberg, and the Schwarzwald (Black 
Forest).
 
✓ Maupintour (www.maupintour.com) has an eight-day escorted 
tour of German Christmas Market Towns and in 2010 will be offer-
ing an escorted tour that includes the Oberammergau Passion play.
Choosing a Package Tour
For many destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In many 
cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to 
and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book 
yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators, 
who then resell them to the public.

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany 
66
Every package tour is different. Some offer a better class of hotels than 
others; some provide the same hotels for lower prices; and many let you 
choose the hotel category you want. Some book flights on scheduled air-
lines; others sell charters. In some packages, your choice of accommo-
dations and travel days may be limited. Some let you choose between 
escorted vacations and independent vacations; others allow you to add 
on just a few excursions or escorted day trips (also at discounted 
prices) without booking an entirely escorted tour.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday 
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines, such as 
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler. 
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584; www.libertytravel.com) is 
one of the biggest packagers in the Northeast and usually boasts a full-
page ad in Sunday papers.
Several big online travel agencies — Expedia, Lastminute.com, Orbitz, 
and Travelocity — also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re unsure 
about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the Better Business 
Bureau in the city where the company is based, or go online to www.bbb.
org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t fly with it.
Other good sources of package deals are the airlines. The following U.S. 
airlines offered cost-cutting air/hotel packages to Berlin, Frankfurt, and 
Munich from the United States in 2009:
 
✓ Continental Airlines Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.
covacations.com)
 
✓ Delta Vacations (% 800-221-6666; www.deltavacations.com)
 
✓ Northwest Airlines World Vacations (% 800-800-1504; www.
nwaworldvacations.com)
 
✓ United Vacations (% 800-800-1504 www.unitedvacations.com)
 
 Airline packages don’t always include airport taxes and surcharges, which 
typically amount to about $80. The total cost of an air/hotel package 
varies depending on your departure city.

trip, go to www.frommers.com/planning.

I
n this chapter, you find out more about your travel options within 
Germany — that is, the mode of travel best suited to your needs and 
itinerary. Compared with the United States, Australia, and Canada, 
Germany is a fairly small country. With the area added by reunification, 
Germany (356,734 sq. km/137,735 sq. miles) is smaller than the state of 
Montana (but with more than 82 million people). By fast train or car, you 
can get from Berlin, in the north, to Munich, in the south, in seven or 
eight hours. Many historic towns and castles in Germany are manage-
able day trips from larger cities.
If you want to get a feel for the country, consider exploring at least a 
portion of Germany that has nothing to do with huge urban Berlin or 
Munich. When you get out of the cities and into the countryside, where 
you can sip wine in a small Rhineland village or explore a scenic region 
like Bavaria, you’ll experience the best of the country’s atmospheric 
charms. You’ll notice fascinating differences in culture, customs, food, 
and language as you travel from one part of Germany to another.
Weighing the Options: Train or Car?
Because of Germany’s comparatively small size and easy-access train 
and road networks, the country is a snap to explore. From Berlin you 
can reach Dresden or Leipzig in about two hours. The train trip between 
Hamburg and Lübeck is less than an hour. From Munich, the trip to 
Garmisch-Partenkirchen in the Bavarian Alps is only an hour by car and 
less than 90 minutes by train. The cities in western Germany — Cologne, 
Heidelberg, Nuremberg, and Stuttgart — usually are no more than two 
or three hours apart by car or train.
So should you rent a car or take the train? In almost all cases, I recom-
mend train travel for its convenience, speed, and fun. However, having a 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany 
68
car in scenic areas, such as the Schwarzwald (Black Forest; Chapter 17) 
or the Romantic Road in Bavaria (Chapter 16), enables you to explore 
the countryside more easily.
Taking the Train: The Easy Way to Go
In Germany, a train is called an Eisenbahn (eye-sen-bawn) or a Zug (zoog). 
I recommend traveling by train above all other forms of transportation — 
especially if you’re a first-time visitor to Germany. Traveling by train is 
fast, fun, and convenient.
 
 The railway system in Germany is operated by Deutsche Bahn (DB; 
German Rail). If you need any kind of train-related information while 
you’re in Germany — from timetables to fares and special services — call 
DB’s general information number at % 11861. (From outside Germany, 
call % 49-1805-996633; regular calling charges apply for both numbers.) 
Someone who speaks English will be available to help you. You also can 
access train information online, in English, at DB’s Web site (www.bahn.de).
Heading to the Hauptbahnhof
A German city’s Hauptbahnhof (howpt-bahn-hof), or main train station, 
rarely is more than a few minutes’ walk from the historic town center 
and all the main attractions. The station always serves as a main link in 
the city’s public transportation system, so you can continue your local 
explorations by subway, light-rail, tram, or bus from there.
German train stations in major cities offer all kinds of services, including 
currency exchange, food and beverages, newsstands, and usually a tour-
ist information office. Hotels are always close at hand. If you’re arriving 
in a city for sightseeing only, and not spending the night, you can check 
your Gepäck (geh-peck; luggage) at a luggage checkroom. At larger sta-
tions, porters (recognized by their red or blue uniforms) can transport 
your luggage, or you can use self-service luggage trolleys.
Beginning basic training
Throughout Germany, long-distance and local train timetables are coor-
dinated to minimize waiting for connections. And, yes, German trains 
almost always run on time — they’re among the most reliable trains in 
Europe.
 
 Like other European trains, the German train system works on a 24-hour 
clock. Midnight always is listed as 0:00 hours and noon is 12:00. Therefore, 
train times can be 13:00 (1 p.m.), 14:00 (2 p.m.), 15:00 (3 p.m.), and so on, 
up to 23:59 (11:59 p.m.). If your train leaves at 4:20 p.m., the time on the 
schedule reads 16:20; if it leaves at 8:20 a.m., the schedule reads 08:20.
The federally owned and operated Deutsche Bahn has been modernizing 
and upgrading its trains steadily while integrating two different systems 

 Chapter 7: Getting Around Germany 69
(Deutsche Bundesbahn in western Germany and Deutsche Reichsbahn 
in eastern Germany) into a single network. You may be surprised by the 
bright-red, high-tech look of the newest trains.
Here’s a rundown of the trains that you find within Germany:
 
✓ InterCity (IC) passenger trains offer express service between all 
major German cities at intervals of one or two hours. IC trains have 
adjustable cushioned seats, individual reading lights, and tele-
phone service. Speisewagen (shpy-zuh-vahg-en; dining cars) and 
cafe or bistro cars (for lighter snacks) are on all trains. On IC trains, 
you can choose whether to sit in a compartment with six seats or 
in an open saloon coach.
 
✓ InterCity Express (ICE) trains, which connect major cities on heav-
ily traveled routes, are among the fastest in Europe, reaching 
speeds of 300kmph (186 mph). ICE trains run from Hamburg to 
Munich, from Frankfurt to Munich, and from Berlin to Munich. Each 
train makes stops at cities along the way. ICE significantly reduces 
travel time, enabling passengers to cross the entire country in only 
a few hours. ICE trains have telephones, a restaurant, and a high 
standard of comfort in both first and second classes. If you’re trav-
eling on Friday or Sunday or during German holidays (for a list, see 
Chapter 3), it’s a good idea to reserve a seat on long-distance ICE 
trains, even if you have a Eurail Pass.
 
✓ The CityNightLine (CNL) is one of the most comfortable night 
trains in Europe. This train operates between Berlin and Zurich 
(stopping at Frankfurt, Baden-Baden, and Freiburg, among other 
towns), Berlin and Dresden, Hamburg and Zurich, and Dortmund 
and Vienna. The CNL offers four different categories. Sleeping 
accommodations in Deluxe include compartments with a shower 
and toilet, key cards, phones for wake-up service, and a panoramic 
window with blinds. Comfort Single or Double gives you a single- 
or double-bed compartment with washing facilities. Economy pro-
vides a four-bed compartment with washing facilities; you can book 
this class as a single or double. The Ruhesessel (sleeper chair) cat-
egory offers open saloon seating with reclining seats. The CNL 
includes a restaurant and cafe car. Advance reservations are man-
datory for all sleeping accommodations. Eurail and German Rail 
pass holders are accepted on this train but have to pay extra for 
the seat or sleeper reservation.
 
✓ DB Nachtzug (Night Train) service is available between many cities 
in Germany and continues on to Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, 
Prague, and Copenhagen. The night trains have comfortable 
couchettes (basic sleeping compartments) and some more deluxe 
sleeping compartments with showers. Couchettes must be 
reserved, even if you’re traveling with a Eurail Pass.
 
✓ For shorter local trips, usually within a suburban area around a 
large town, S-Bahn (urban light-rail) trains are used. For some 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany 
70
out-of-the-way places, you may need to transfer to a RegionalBahn 
(RB) train to reach your destination. RegionalExpress (RE) trains 
link rural areas to the long-distance rail network.
 
✓ If you want to avoid long-distance driving but need a car after you 
arrive at your destination, you can take yourself and your car on an 
overnight car-sleeper Auto Train. You ride in a sleeper compart-
ment on the train while your automobile, stowed elsewhere, comes 
along for the ride. When you reach your destination, you can pick 
up your car and go. Although less common, daytime automobile 
trains also operate.
An announcement is made before the train arrives at each station. 
Station stops are short, so have your luggage in hand and be ready to 
disembark when the train comes to a halt. In new high-speed trains, you 
must press a well-marked button to open the door. In other trains, you 
may need to open the door by pulling up on a handle.
Buying your ticket
You can buy your tickets at any German train station ticket counter, 
from a DB-authorized travel agency, from vending machines in most 
stations, by phone (% 11861 within Germany, % 49-1805-996633 out-
side Germany), online (register at www.bahn.de and you can print out 
your purchased tickets), or on the train (where you’ll pay an extra 
charge).
German trains have a two-tiered ticket system: Erste Klasse (first class) 
and Zweite Klasse (second class), which now sometimes is called stan-
dard class. First-class tickets cost about one-third more than second 
class. The first-class cars have roomier seats and a more luxurious feel, 
but you can travel very comfortably in second class. You may appreci-
ate the difference on long-distance journeys — from Berlin to Munich, 
say, when you’re onboard the train for seven hours or more.
First-class service on InterCity Express (ICE) trains includes a higher 
standard of personal service; you can order beverages and snacks that 
are brought to your seat. First- and second-class passengers otherwise 
use the same dining cars and cafe cars for buying sandwiches and 
drinks. On some trains, an employee comes through both first- and sec-
ond-class cars with a food-and-beverage trolley. Local and commuter 
trains don’t have food service.
Reserving your seat
 
 On most trains in Germany you can travel without a seat reservation. But 
if you’re traveling for any distance, and especially if you’re traveling on 
national or school holidays, or on a Friday or Sunday, reserving a seat is 
a really good idea, even if you have a Eurail Pass or German Rail Pass. If 
you don’t reserve, the only free seat you find may be out in the hallway 
between cars. You can make a Platz (plotz; seat) reservation and buy 

 Chapter 7: Getting Around Germany 71
Fahrkarten (far-karten; train tickets) at any train station. In larger stations, 
look for the Reisezentrum (travel center). In smaller stations, make your 
booking at the ticket counter. In larger stations, the staff speaks English 
and can answer any questions you have. If you have a German Rail Pass 
or a Eurail Pass (see “Saving time and money with rail passes,” later in this 
chapter), the seat reservation costs 5€ ($6.75) for first class, 3€ ($4.05) for 
second class. You’re issued a ticket that lists the Wagen (car) number and 
the Platz number.
 
 All German trains are divided into smoking (rauchen, pronounced rau-kin) 
and nonsmoking (nicht rauchen, pronounced nickt rau-kin) sections. 
Specify your preference when reserving your seat. On IC and ICE trains 
you can also reserve a seat in a quiet (no cellphone) zone, a window seat, 
a seat with a table, a seat in an area with better cellphone access, or, if 
you’re traveling with children, seats in a special parent-child area.
Getting off on the right track
After arriving at the station and purchasing your ticket, you need to 
find the right Gleis (glice; track) for your departing train. In large cities, 
prominently placed departure and arrival boards list train numbers, 
arrival or departure times, final destinations, and track numbers. This 
information also is posted as a printed schedule in the station. The 
German word for arrival is Ankunft (on-koonft); departure is Abfahrt 
(ob-fahrt).
If you have a reserved seat, your ticket lists the car and seat number. 
Trains can be very long, so you want to be near the appropriate area 
for boarding when your train pulls into the station. Diagrams posted on 
the platform show the layout of first-class, second-class, and restaurant 
cars. Each Wagen (vah-ghen; car), is numbered. The Wagen numbers 
correspond with numbers or letters on the platform, usually 1 to 6 or 
A to G. Check the diagram and then make your way to the appropriate 
area of the platform before the train arrives. If you have a Eurail Pass, 
and you’re traveling without a seat reservation, make your way to the 
platform areas where the first- or second-class cars will stop.
 
 In many German train stations, you can take an elevator to the track level. 
But in others, you must climb stairs, which sometimes have a ramp for 
luggage trolleys and baby carriages. If you’re loaded down with several 
large, heavy bags, getting to your track without help may be difficult (just 
another way of saying, “Don’t overpack”).
Saving time and money with rail passes
Rail passes are tickets that enable you to travel for a certain number of 
days without buying a ticket for each leg of your journey. They help you 
save time (ticket lines can be long) and, usually, money. You must pur-
chase most rail passes before you leave home; you can’t buy them after 
you arrive in Germany or the rest of Europe.

 Before you buy a rail pass, do a little research to find out whether it’s 
going to save you money. At Rail Europe’s Web site (www.raileurope.
com), you can click on Fares and Schedules and get an estimated cost (in 
U.S. or Canadian dollars) of fares between destinations within Germany. 
You can also find exact fares on Deutsche Bahn’s Web site (www.bahn.de).
Travel agents throughout the United States and Canada sell all the rail 
passes described here, but the biggest supplier is Rail Europe (% 877-
257-2887 in the U.S. or 800-361-7245 in Canada; www.raileurope.com), 
which allows you to order by phone or online.
Many different rail passes are available in the United Kingdom for travel 
in Germany and continental Europe. You can check out passes and prices 
at Rail Europe’s U.K. Web site (www.raileurope.co.uk), or stop in at 
the Rail Europe Travel Centre, 178 Piccadilly, London WI (% 08708/
371-371 in the U.K). Some of the most popular passes, including InterRail 
and Euro Youth, are available only to travelers 25 years of age and 
younger; these passes allow unlimited second-class travel through most 
European countries.
German Rail passes: For Deutschland only
 
 The German Rail Pass allows for four to ten consecutive or nonconsecu-
tive days of travel in one month within Germany. A four-day pass costs 
$354 first class or $274 second class.
An even bigger bargain is the German Rail Twin Pass, for two adults 
(they don’t have to be married and can be of the same sex) traveling 
together in first or second class. The second pass represents a 50 per-
cent savings over single prices. Sample prices per person: $275 for four 
days first class or $203 for second class.
A German Rail Youth Pass is valid only for persons younger than 26 
years of age and is available only in second class. Sample prices: $227 
for four days, $321 for ten days.
 German Rail Passes for kids ages 6 to 11 are half the adult price. Children 
5 and younger travel free.
A German Rail Pass also entitles the bearer to free or discounted travel 
on selected bus routes operated by Deutsche Touring/Europabus, 
including destinations not serviced by trains, and free travel on KD 
German Line steamers (day trips only) along the Main, Mosel, and 
Rhine rivers.
German Rail passes are most conveniently available from Rail Europe 
(% 877-257-2887 in the U.S. or 800-361-7245 in Canada); you can pur-
chase the passes online at www.raileurope.com. Rail Europe also 
provides cost-effective Rail ’n Drive packages that combine a certain 
number of days on the train with a certain number of days in a rental 
car. For instance, you can ride the train from Frankfurt to Munich, spend 

 Chapter 7: Getting Around Germany 73
three days exploring the city, and then rent a car for a two-day excur-
sion into the Bavarian Alps to see Ludwig’s castles.
Eurail Global Pass: For travel throughout Europe
 
 The Eurail Global Pass is one of Europe’s best bargains. With a Eurail 
Global Pass you can enjoy unlimited first-class rail travel in 20 countries, 
including Germany. Passes are for periods as short as 15 days or as long 
as 3 months. These passes are for consecutive days of travel. The 15-day 
Eurail Global Pass costs $734 ($367 for children 6–11).
If you’re 25 or younger, you can purchase a Eurail Global Pass Youth, 
entitling you to unlimited second-class travel for $477 for 15 days, $618 
for 21 days, $768 for 1 month, $1,085 for 2 months, or $1,341 for 3 months.
A host of different Eurail Global Pass options are available, including the 
Eurail Global Pass Flexi, good for first-class travel for 10 or 15 days in a 
2-month period, and Eurail Global Pass Saver for two to five people 
traveling together. There’s also the Eurail Select Pass, allowing travelers 
to select three, four, or five adjoining countries linked by rail or ferry.
Eurail passes can be bought and used only by non-European residents. 
Seat reservations are required on some trains, and extra charges apply 
for travel in couchettes (sleeping cars) on night trains.
Touring by Car: Autobahns, 
Tankstellen, and Benzin
I’m a Zug (train) nut. To me, nothing is more pleasant than sitting in a 
train and watching the countryside roll by. However, Germany has 
scenic regions — the Romantic Road, the Bodensee (Lake Constance), 
and the Schwarzwald (Black Forest), for example — where even I suc-
cumb to car rental to explore the countryside.
 
 If you’re going to tour Germany by car, you may want to pick up a copy of 
Frommer’s Germany’s Best-Loved Driving Tours (Wiley).
Renting a car in Germany
Renting a car is fairly easy in Germany. Drivers from the United States, 
Canada, Australia, and other non–European Union countries must have a 
valid driver’s license, but no other special license is required. I recom-
mend that you make all the arrangements before you leave home. You 
can pick up your car at most airports and major train stations, or at an 
office within German cities. You can often rent a car in one German city 
and return the vehicle in another city for no additional charge.
 
 Prepaying rentals in dollars before leaving the United States offers some 
advantages. You get an easy-to-understand net price (which you have to 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany 
74
prepay by credit card), the rental process is more streamlined, and you 
can avoid unpleasant surprises caused by sudden unfavorable changes in 
currency exchange rates. Remember, however, that if you opt to prepay 
and your plans change, you have to go through some rather complicated 
paperwork (and, in some cases, have to pay a penalty of around $25) for 
changing or canceling a prepaid contract. Whenever you rent, keep in 
mind that you may get a better rate if you reserve the car at least seven 
days in advance.
In addition to the standard rental prices, other optional charges (and 
some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes) apply to most car rentals. 
The Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which requires you to pay for 
damage to the car in a collision, is covered by many credit card compa-
nies. Check with your credit card company before you go so you can 
avoid paying this hefty fee (as much as $20 a day).
The car rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you 
harm others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm 
yourself or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your lug-
gage is stolen from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at home 
probably covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, if your 
own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have auto 
insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your car 
rental agent for more information). Unless you’re toting around the 
Hope diamond, and you don’t want to leave that in your car trunk 
anyway, you can probably skip the personal effects insurance, but driv-
ing around without liability or personal accident coverage is never a 
good idea. Even if you’re a good driver, other people may not be, and lia-
bility claims can be complicated.
Some companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for your 
initial full tank of gas upfront, and can return the car with an empty gas 
tank. The prices can be competitive with local gas prices, but you don’t 
get credit for any gas remaining in the tank. If you reject this option, you 
pay only for the gas you use, but you have to return the car with a full 
tank or face high charges for any shortfall. If you usually run late and a 
fueling stop may make you miss your plane, you’re a perfect candidate 
for the fuel-purchase option.
Several international car-rental firms rent cars in Germany. See the 
Quick Concierge for a list of names and contact information.
You can also rent a car through Rail Europe (% 877-257-2887 in the 
U.S. or 800-361-7245 in Canada; www.raileurope.com) at the same 
time you book your German Rail Pass or Eurail Pass (see “Saving time 
and money with rail passes,” earlier in this chapter). They offer a 
German Rail ’n Drive option that gives you two days of unlimited train 
travel (first or second class) and two days of Hertz car rental within one 
month. You can purchase extra days for both train travel and car rental.

 Chapter 7: Getting Around Germany 75
Taking the roads less traveled
The roads that make up the Autobahn (otto-bahn) form Germany’s main 
long-distance highway network. In theory, the Autobahn does not have a 
speed limit (in the left, fast lane), but many drivers going too fast report 
that they’ve been stopped by police and fined on the spot. So exercise 
reasonable caution. A German driver on the Autobahn can be like one 
possessed, so you may prefer the slower, right lane. The government 
recommends an Autobahn speed limit of 130kmph (80 mph).
The Bundesstrassen (state roads) vary in quality from region to region. 
The Bundesstrassen in the major touring areas of the Romantic Road 
in Bavaria, the Rhine Valley, and the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) are 
smoothly paved and kept in good repair. In eastern Germany, some sec-
ondary and local roads are not in such good shape.
 
 Michelin publishes the best regional maps, which are available at all major 
bookstores throughout Germany. Hallweg also produces good road maps. 
However, in general, finding your way by looking for directional signs 
rather than highway number signs is easier. In this book, individual auto-
bahns are indicated by the letter A followed by a number (for example, 
A96), and Bundesstrassen, by the letter B (for example, B31). Germany’s 
road signs are standard international signs. See Table 7-1 for a few impor-
tant words that you should know.

Following the rules of the road
If you’re going to drive in Germany, you need to know a few general facts:
 
✓ Signs show distances and speed limits in kilometers (km) and 
kilometers per hour (kmph). A kilometer is 0.62 mile, and a mile 
is 1.62km.
 
✓ Unless posted differently, speed limits are
 
• 50kmph (31 mph) in towns
 
• 100kmph (62 mph) on regular highways
 
• 130kmph (81 mph) on autobahns
 
✓ On autobahns, the left lane is the fast lane. And I mean fast. Do not 
drive in this lane unless you’re passing another car.
 
✓ You can pass other vehicles only on the left. German motorists 
generally flash their lights if they want you to move over so they 
can pass.
 
✓ The law requires that all passengers wear seat belts. Children 11 
and younger must sit on booster seats in the back so that regular 
seat belts can be used safely. Children 3 and younger must ride in a 
car seat.
 
✓ You must use low-beam headlights at night and during fog, heavy 
rain, and snowfalls.
 
✓ Parking in the center of most big towns is difficult, expensive, or 
just plain impossible, because most historic town centers are for 
pedestrians only. Look for parking lots and parking garages outside 
the center; they’re always identified by a large P. In some larger 
cities, signs on the way into town indicate how much space is avail-
able in various lots or parking garages. Most parking lots use an 
automated ticket system. You insert coins (or credit cards) to pur-
chase a certain amount of time.
 
✓ You must stop for pedestrians in crosswalks; they have the right 
of way.
 
 
✓ Driving while intoxicated and drinking while driving are very seri-
ous offenses in Germany. If you’ve had more than a glass of wine or 
beer, don’t risk driving.
Handling a roadside emergency
The major automobile club in Germany is Allgemeiner Deutscher 
Automobile Club (ADAC), Am Westpark 8, 81373 München (% 089/
76760). If you have a breakdown on the Autobahn, you can call ADAC 
from an emergency phone. On the Autobahn, you find emergency phones 

 Chapter 7: Getting Around Germany 77
every 2km (about 11⁄4 miles); the point of the black triangle on posts 
alongside the road indicates the direction of the nearest phone. If you 
don’t belong to an auto club, call ADAC’s breakdown service at % 01802/
222222. In English, ask for “road service assistance” (Strassenwachthilfe). 
Emergency assistance is free, but you pay for parts and materials.
Fill ’er up, bitte (please)
Gasoline, called Benzin (ben-seen), is readily available throughout 
Germany, and gas stations, called Tankstelle (tonk-shtel-leh), appear fre-
quently along autobahns. The posted price you see is per liter, not per 
gallon (3.8 liters = 1 gallon). The cheapest gasoline is at stations marked 
sb-tanken (Selbstbedienung, or self-service). But remember that gas is 
always much more expensive than in the United States (about $6 per 
gallon at press time). Filling up the tank of a medium-size car can easily 
set you back 70€ ($94).
The self-service process is basically the same as that in the United 
States. You fill your tank and pay inside at the counter. The types of 
gasoline are Normal Bleifrei (regular unleaded), Super Bleifrei (super 
unleaded), Super Plus Bleifrei (supreme unleaded), and diesel.
Sailing through Germany: River Cruises
Germany’s major river is the Rhine, which flows through the heart of 
Europe from the Alps to the North Sea. Through the centuries, more cas-
tles were built in the Rhine Valley than in any other valley in the world. 
This area has great appeal to visitors. The Main flows from the Danube, 
past Frankfurt, and enters the Rhine at the city of Mainz. The Elbe, 
which begins in the Czech Republic, cuts through Germany’s eastern 
border in a beautiful area called Saxon Switzerland (see Chapter 14), 
flows past the great art city of Dresden, and continues northeastward; 
situated on tributaries of the Elbe are Berlin and Hamburg.
Viking KD River Cruises and Peter Deilman EuropAmerica Cruises offer 
several cruises along these three great waterways. Itineraries range 
from 2 to 20 nights, mostly between April and October but with some 
in December. If you’re looking for an unusual and relaxing way to see 
Germany, you may want to consider this option. For more information, 
contact Viking KD River Cruises of Europe, 21820 Burbank Blvd., 
Woodland Hills, CA 91367 (% 877-668-4576; www.rivercruises.
com), or Peter Deilmann EuropAmerica Cruises, 1800 Diagonal Rd., 
Suite 170, Alexandria, VA 22314 (% 800-348-8287; www.deilmann-
cruises.com).
In the city and regional chapters of this guidebook, I tell you about river 
excursions along the Mosel and Neckar rivers and local sightseeing 
cruises in Berlin, Cologne, Dresden, Frankfurt, and Heidelberg.

Flying Around Germany: A Good Idea?
Flying from city to city within Germany makes sense if you’re traveling 
from, say, Hamburg or Berlin in the north to Munich in the south, or 
from Cologne in the west to Leipzig in the east. A trip that normally 
takes seven or eight hours by train or car takes about an hour by plane. 
The downside is that you won’t see the countryside.
Flying doesn’t make much sense if you’re traveling short distances 
between cities that are connected by high-speed trains. The train from 
Frankfurt to Stuttgart, for example, takes 1 hour and 20 minutes. You can 
fly this route, but when you factor in time spent getting to the airport, 
going through security, waiting for your departure, and then getting into 
the city after your plane lands, you can already be there, in the city 
center, by train.
Lufthansa (% 800-645-3880 in the U.S. and Canada, 9639-6499 in 
Australia, 01803/803-803 in Germany; www.lufthansa.com or www.
lufthansa.de) offers the most extensive and frequent flights within 
the country, but other European carriers are increasing their German 
domestic routes.

T
his chapter deals with that age-old question asked by every traveler 
going to an unfamiliar country or city: Where should I spend the 
night? Everyone travels differently, and every country offers its own 
lodging possibilities. In the following pages, you find out about German 
hotels — how to find them, what to expect in each category, how to 
book a room online, and how to get the best deal for your money.
In Germany’s large cities, like Berlin and Munich, booking your hotel 
room ahead is essential — especially if you’re going to be in Munich 
during Oktoberfest. Throughout the year, Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt, 
Munich, and other major cities play host to large trade fairs and special 
events that make hotel rooms scarce. From April through September, and 
again in December (the period that constitutes high season), hotels in the 
inexpensive-to-moderate range are always the first to be snapped up.
Booking ahead isn’t as important in the rest of Germany, but I still rec-
ommend doing so — particularly when you’re going to be spending a 
Friday or Saturday night in a major tourist spot like Dresden or Füssen, 
near Ludwig’s castles. Hotels in popular tourist areas, such as the 
Schwarzwald (Black Forest), the Mosel and Rhine valleys, and the 
Bodensee (Lake Constance), also fill up quickly during high season. 
During off season, especially in the middle of winter, you won’t have a 
problem booking a room on the spot, wherever you are. In a small vil-
lage, finding a room may be as simple as spotting a sign in a house 
window that reads zimmer frei (room available).

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany 
80
 
 Tourist information centers, located in or near the main train stations in 
all German cities and towns, can help you find a room. Charges for this 
service vary. Some places charge nothing; others charge a small fixed fee 
(usually no more than 4€/$5.40); and others charge 10 percent of the first 
night’s hotel rate, but you get that back at the hotel, so the service ends 
up costing nothing. Most tourist information centers also have a free 
directory of local accommodations.
Finding the Place That’s Right for You
Germany has very high standards for hotels and inns. You find all types 
of lodging, from luxury old-world palaces and super-high-tech showoffs 
to hip boutique hotels, small family-run hotels, cozy inns, chain hotels, 
rustic guesthouses, and simple rooms in private homes and apartments. 
You won’t find a speck of Schmutz (dirt) in any of them. Hotel associa-
tions, regional tourist associations, and local tourist boards control 
standards in all categories of accommodations. Even the smallest pen-
sion (bed-and-breakfast) must open its doors for inspection to be able to 
list and rent rooms.
These same state agencies and tourist boards rate hotels according to a 
star system. The system isn’t used to recommend hotels but rather 
simply to categorize them according to their amenities. A one-star hotel 
is basic and inexpensive. A five-star hotel is a luxury property with an 
on-site spa or pool and a rate at the top end of the price spectrum. I 
don’t use that star-rating system in this book; instead, I try to give you 
the best options in different price categories.
Frühstück (breakfast) always is included in the price of a room, except 
at some boutique and high-end luxury hotels. In a pension, breakfast 
may be coffee, a roll with butter and jam, an egg, and some cold cuts. At 
hotels, depending on the size and degree of luxury, breakfast is more 
likely to be a self-serve buffet with juice, cereal, yogurt, fruit, pastries, 
fresh bread, eggs, cold cuts, and smoked fish or pickled herring.
Smoke-free rooms and smoke-free floors finally are catching on in 
Germany. You’re most likely to find them in midrange to high-end hotels. 
But remember that Europeans in general are not as committed to smoke-
free environments as are Americans. The term for “no smoking” is nicht 
rauchen (nickt rau-kin).
 
 In all types of accommodations in Germany, you find a Decke (deck-uh) on 
the bed. A Decke is what Americans call a comforter or duvet. This light, 
feather-filled covering, buttoned within a sheet, takes the place of blankets. 
If two beds are joined to make a double, you find a Decke on each side.
In Germany, you have several different kinds of hotels and accommoda-
tions from which to choose. In the following sections, I describe each 
type, beginning with the most expensive.

 Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 81
Luxury hotels
Germany’s grand luxury hotels are usually large properties with 250 or 
more rooms. Public spaces in luxury hotels are sophisticated and ele-
gant. The staff is unusually welcoming and the service impeccable. 
Porters are available to take your luggage up to your room (tip 1€/$1.35 
per bag). The rooms themselves are generally spacious and beautifully 
furnished with amenities such as a minibar, a couple of phones, cable 
and satellite TV, high-speed and wireless Internet access, and bathrobes. 
Bathrooms are large and well equipped with magnifying mirrors, tubs 
(often with whirlpools) and showers, and high-quality toiletries. Your 
bed is turned down at night, 24-hour room service is available, and the 
property has an on-site health club, usually with a sauna and pool. The 
hotel has at least two fine gourmet restaurants, which often are the 
best restaurants in town (sometimes Michelin-starred). What you don’t 
get is a free breakfast. Charges for the (fabulous) breakfast buffet are 
anywhere from 18€ to 26€ ($24–$34). Some brand-name hotel chains — 
Hyatt, Kempinski, Le Meridien, and Steigenberger, in particular — have 
properties in this luxury category; the Hotel Excelsior Ernst in Cologne 
and the Kempinski Hotel Adlon in Berlin (both found in Chapter 22) are 
two of the most luxurious luxury hotels. Expect to pay 175€ ($236) and 
up, but also look for special weekend rates on the hotels’ Web sites, 
which you can find in every chapter’s hotel listings and in the Quick 
Concierge.
Boutique hotels
Think of these as small luxury hotels. Boutique hotels generally have 
fewer than 70 rooms and offer a unique ambience and high level of per-
sonalized service. Each one has its own personality. The Mandarin 
Oriental in Munich (Chapter 22) is like a small, luxurious palace; the 
Bleibtreu in Berlin (Chapter 11) is big on hip, contemporary design; 
Hotel Brandenburger Hof in Berlin (Chapter 11) emphasizes a sleek, clas-
sic Bauhaus style; Der Kleine Prinz in Baden-Baden (Chapter 17) is built 
around old-fashioned luxury. These establishments often are part of 
hotel associations, such as Relais & Châteaux, Small Luxury Hotels, and 
Romantic Hotels. Rooms and bathrooms are not always large, but 
they’re beautifully fitted out. Boutique hotels always have a fine-dining 
restaurant (often with a Michelin star) and a bar. Amenities typically 
include brand-name toiletries, a minibar, telephone, high-speed and 
wireless Internet access, satellite TV, and bathrobes. Breakfast may or 
may not be included. Most boutique hotels are too small to have a pool 
or health club, but they may have an arrangement with a nearby facility. 
Pricewise, they generally cost 150€ ($202) and up.
Chain hotels
Best Western, Holiday Inn, Radisson SAS, Ramada, Sheraton — names 
you probably know — all have hotels in Germany. German, European, 
and international chains include Accor, InterCity Hotels (always near 
train stations), Inter-Continental, Mercure, Mövenpick, Park Plaza/

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany 
82
art’otel, Ringhotels, Swissôtel, Travel Charme, and Treff Hotels. For the 
most part, chain hotels offer brand-name familiarity and dependable ser-
vice. They also tend to be newish, enormous, and somewhat anony-
mous. Tour packagers and convention planners often house their groups 
in chain hotels.
The rooms are smaller and have a more standardized décor than rooms 
in luxury and boutique hotels. Amenities include a telephone, cable TV, 
and sometimes a minibar. Bathrooms are smaller and less glamorous 
than the ones in a luxury or boutique hotel property. Room service is 
available, and the hotel often has an on-site pool or health club with 
sauna. You generally find different room categories, some with breakfast 
included. Prices vary greatly for chain hotels, depending on the time of 
year and the presence of trade shows or conventions. In general, expect 
to pay anywhere from 110€ to 175€ ($148–$236). Shopping around on the 
Web may net you some big savings.
Smaller independent hotels
Many small and medium-size hotels in Germany are family owned and 
operated. Properties like Hotel Jedermann in Munich (Chapter 15) or 
Hotel-Garni Brugger in Lindau (Chapter 17) offer basic, comfortable 
rooms without much personality but at hard-to-beat prices. In these 
hotels, which typically are given a two- or three-star rating by the local 
tourist authority, you find a telephone and cable TV. Rates at small and 
midsize properties always include a buffet breakfast. Prices for a small 
to midsize independent hotel range from 85€ to 175€ ($115–$236).
 
 Garni, a word sometimes attached to a hotel’s name, means that break-
fast is the only meal the hotel serves.
Guesthouses
A guesthouse, called a Gasthaus (gahst-house) or a Gasthof (gahst-
hofe), is basically an inn with a restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, 
and dinner to hotel guests and outside patrons. You’re more likely to 
find guesthouses in small towns, in medium-size cities, or in the country 
than in large cities. The ambience tends to be rustic and cozy, and many 
of the properties are older and located in the oldest and most pictur-
esque quarters of the city. The restaurant occupies the main or first 
floor, and the upper floors, usually no more than three total, have just a 
few rooms. Most guesthouses don’t have an elevator. Some rooms have 
small private bathrooms with showers or bathtubs; other rooms have 
sinks but share bathrooms and showers in the hallway. The rooms 
themselves often are charming — what you’d typically expect in an old-
world inn. You probably won’t find a telephone in your room or too 
many amenities, but your rate will include breakfast. The inn may also 
offer a special rate for dinner or lunch and dinner. The Greifensteiner 
Hof in Würzburg and Feriengasthof Helmer in Schwangau (see Chapter 
16 for both) are examples of this kind of accommodations. Rates are typ-
ically from 65€ to 110€ ($88–$148) for a double room.

 Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 83
Pensions
 
 The pension (pronounced pen-see-own in Germany) has long been the 
backbone of budget travel in Germany. A pension is the same as a bed-
and-breakfast (B&B): a room in a private home or apartment, with break-
fast included in the price. Some half a million beds are available in private 
homes across the country, often advertised with a simple sign: zimmer 
frei (room available). You may luck out and find a place with a private 
bathroom, or you may have to share the bathroom. Breakfast always is 
included in the price, and in some cases, you can also use the kitchen. 
Amenities vary from place to place, so you may or may not have a TV, but 
you generally won’t have a phone. In smaller towns, rooms start around 
30€ ($41) per person per night; prices are higher in large cities. Hotel-
Pension Elegia in Berlin (Chapter 11) is a good big-city pension. Keep in 
mind that many pensions operate on a cash-only basis.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate that a hotel charges for a room. It’s 
the rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the 
night. You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency-exit 
diagrams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always 
do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surpris-
ingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be 
pleasantly surprised. Prices often aren’t negotiable at smaller hotels, 
pensions, and guesthouses, although some of these properties do offer 
special rates for longer stays.
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room 
depends on many factors — chief among them being how you make your 
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with 
certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the hotel 
often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his business 
toward that hotel.)
 
 Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number also may result in 
a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the central 
reservations number may not know about discount rates at specific loca-
tions, or special Internet rates. Your best bet is to check the Web site and 
then call both the local number and the toll-free number to see which one 
gives you a better deal.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy 
rates rise and fall. If you travel in the high season (Apr–June, Sept, and 
Dec), you’ll probably pay more. In Germany, hotel rates usually go down 
in July and August, considered high season elsewhere in Europe. (See 
Chapter 3 for more information on Germany’s different seasons.) But 
even within a given season, room prices are subject to change without 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany

notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be different from the actual 
rate you receive when you make your reservation.
 
 When you’re booking a room at an international chain hotel (such as a 
Ramada or a Hyatt), be sure to mention membership in AAA, AARP, fre-
quent-flier programs, and any corporate rewards programs you belong to. 
You never know when the affiliation may be worth a few euros off your 
room rate. This tip doesn’t apply to smaller hotels and pensions.
For more tips about how to get the best room rate, see the information 
on package tours in Chapter 6. Package tours generally include airfare 
and hotel, and the savings can be enormous.
Surfing the Web for Hotel Deals
Shopping online for hotels generally is done one of two ways: through 
the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking agency (or 
a fare-service agency like Priceline.com). These Internet hotel agencies 
have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, competing for the 
business of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations around 
the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to consumers who have 
the patience and time to shop for and compare the online sites for good 
deals — but shop they must, because prices can vary considerably from 
site to site and from day to day. And keep in mind that hotels at the top 
of a site’s listing may be there for no other reason than that they paid 
money to get the placement.
In addition to the online travel booking sites Travelocity (www.
travelocity.com or www.travelocity.co.uk), Expedia (www.
expedia.com, www.expedia.ca, or www.expedia.co.uk), Orbitz 
(www.orbitz.com), Priceline.com, and Hotwire (www.hotwire.com), 
you can book hotels through Hotels.com, Quikbook (www.quikbook.
com), and Travelaxe (www.travelaxe.net).
HotelChatter (www.hotelchatter.com) is a daily Webzine offering 
smart coverage and critiques of hotels worldwide. Go to TripAdvisor 
(www.tripadvisor.com) or HotelShark (www.hotelshark.com) for 
helpful independent consumer reviews of hotels and resort properties.
It’s a good idea to get a confirmation number and make a printout of 
any online booking transaction. Reservations made through online hotel 
booking agencies can be lost or misplaced.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline.com is even better for book-
ing hotels than it is for booking flights; you’re allowed to pick the neigh-
borhood and quality level of your hotel before offering up your money. 
Priceline is much better at getting five-star lodging for three-star prices 
than at finding anything at the bottom of the scale. On the downside, 
many hotels stick Priceline guests in their least desirable rooms. Be 
sure to go to BiddingForTravel.com before bidding on a hotel room on 

 Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 85
Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date list of hotels that Priceline uses 
in major cities. For Priceline, you pay upfront, and the fee is nonrefund-
able. Note: Some hotels don’t provide loyalty-program points or other 
frequent-stay amenities when you book a room through opaque online 
services like Priceline.
Although the major travel booking sites (Expedia, Orbitz, and Travelocity) 
offer hotel booking, you may be better off using a site devoted primarily 
to lodging. You often find properties not listed with more general online 
travel agencies. Some lodging sites specialize in a particular type of 
accommodations, such as B&Bs, which you won’t find on the more main-
stream booking services.
The following list includes sites that enable you to make online reserva-
tions at hotels throughout Germany:
 
✓ DiscountHotels.com lists bargain rates at hotels throughout 
Germany. Call its toll-free number (% 888-254-0637) if you want 
more options than the Web site lists.
 
✓ InnSite (www.innsite.com) provides B&B listings for inns in 
dozens of countries around the globe, including Germany. You can 
find a B&B in Berlin or the Schwarzwald (Black Forest), look at 
images of the rooms, check prices and availability, and then e-mail 
the innkeeper if you have questions.
 
✓ Worldhotels (www.worldhotels.com) has about 450 hotels 
worldwide, including first-class and resort hotels throughout 
Germany. You can check for special discounted and weekend rates 
at many great German hotels.
 
✓ Travelweb (www.travelweb.com) lists more than 16,000 hotels 
worldwide, including hotels in Germany, and focuses on chains 
such as Hilton and Hyatt. You can book almost 90 percent of these 
accommodations online. Its Click-It Weekends, updated each 
Monday, offer weekend deals at many leading chains.
If you can read German, you may also want to check out the following 
sites:
 
✓ HotelOnline.de features independent hotels throughout Germany 
and northern Europe that are a good value for your money.
 
✓ Landidyll Hotels & Restaurants (www.landidyll.de) focuses on 
family hotels all across Germany that are managed according to 
ecological principles and have gastronomic flair.

Needs or Interests
In This Chapter

▶ Discovering discounts and special tours for seniors
▶ Locating wheelchair-accessible attractions
▶ Finding lesbigay communities and special events
M
any of today’s travelers have special interests or needs: Parents 
traveling with children, seniors looking for discounts or tours 
designed especially for them; people with disabilities who need barrier-
free itineraries, gays and lesbians seeking welcoming places and special 
events; and Jewish visitors who want to visit Holocaust memorials and 
worship in a synagogue. In this chapter, I offer advice and resources for 
all these travelers.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Germany is a pretty kid-friendly country, but traveling anywhere with 
Kinder (kin-der; children), from toddlers to teens, is a challenge — no 
doubt about it. If you have enough trouble getting your kids out of the 
house in the morning, dragging them thousands of miles away to a coun-
try where a different language is spoken may seem like an insurmount-
able challenge. But family travel can be immensely rewarding, giving you 
new ways of seeing the world through smaller pairs of eyes and opening 
those little eyes to the larger world.
The German National Tourist Office’s Web site (www.germany-tourism.
de or www.cometogermany.com), with its section on family travel, is a 
good place to begin researching your trip.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from 
sites like the Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com), a 
comprehensive site that offers customized trip planning; Family Travel 
Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com), an award-winning site that 

 Chapter 9: Catering to Special Needs or Interests 87
offers travel features, deals, and tips; TravelWithYourKids.com, a com-
prehensive site that offers customized trip planning; and FamilyTravelFiles.
com, which offers an online magazine and a directory of off-the-beaten-
path tours and tour operators for families. For a list of more family-
friendly travel resources, visit www.frommers.com/planning.
For information on passport requirements for children, see Chapter 10.
 Look for the Kid Friendly icon as you flip through this book. I use it to 
highlight hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are particularly family 
friendly. Zeroing in on these places can help you plan your trip more 
quickly and easily.
 
 Admission prices for attractions throughout Germany are reduced for 
children ages 6 to 14. Kids younger than 6 almost always get in for free. If 
you’re traveling with children, always check to see whether the attraction 
offers a money-saving family ticket, which considerably reduces the 
admission price for a group of two adults and two or more children. The 
same is true for public transportation: Low-priced family or group tickets 
usually are available. On trains, children ages 6 to 11 pay half the adult 
fare, and children younger than 6 travel free.
Locating family-friendly businesses
Most German hotels happily accommodate your family if you reserve 
your rooms in advance and make the staff aware that you’re traveling 
with kids. The establishment may bring in an extra cot or let you share a 
larger room; these types of arrangements are common. Smaller pen-
sions, or bed-and-breakfasts (B&Bs), may present problems, such as 
cramped rooms and shared toilet facilities. Ask questions before you 
reserve.
Berlin, Munich, and midsize German cities have American-style and 
American-brands fast-food places. You won’t, however, find these food 
chains in smaller villages and towns. Younger teens traveling in Berlin 
and Munich may want to check out the Hard Rock Cafe in those cities. 
In larger cities, you can keep costs down by eating at low-key, local 
restaurants.
 
 Expensive, high-toned restaurants in Germany are not particularly wel-
coming toward young children. The menus aren’t geared to the tastes of 
U.S. youngsters, and the staff can be less than welcoming to children who 
are not well behaved. In fact, in Germany you don’t see many families 
dining in expensive restaurants, even when the place welcomes kids.
 
 When considering museums, bear in mind that most German museums 
don’t translate their signage and texts into English. Therefore, a trip to a 
museum may try the patience of those children who can’t understand 
what they’re reading. However, many of the top museums offer audio 
guides in English.

 You can spur your kids’ interest (and your own) by buying a German 
language tape or checking one out from the library. In the evening, every-
one can spend an hour together, listening to the tape, and familiarizing 
themselves with the sounds of the German language and learning at least 
a few words.
Hiring a baby sitter in Germany
What you really need is an exciting evening at the opera and a romantic 
late dinner with a glass of fine German wine. But you can’t take Junior 
along on this special evening. What are your options? Ask your hotel 
staff whether they can recommend a local baby-sitting service. Most of 
the hotels marked with a Kid Friendly icon in this book can help arrange 
baby-sitting.
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
Germany won’t present any problems for you if you’re a senior who gets 
around easily. If you have trouble getting around, be aware that not all 
hotels — particularly smaller, less-expensive pensions and guesthouses — 
have elevators. The staircases in some places are a test for anyone with 
luggage. When you reserve a hotel, ask whether you’ll have access to an 
elevator or a Fahrstuhl (far-shtool), as they’re called in Germany.
 
 Being a senior may entitle you to some terrific travel bargains, such as 
lower prices for German Rail passes and reduced admission at museums 
and other attractions. Always ask, even if the reduction isn’t posted. 
Carrying an ID with proof of age can pay off in all these situations. Note: 
In Germany, you may find that some discounts are available only for 
German or European Union (EU) residents.
The sources in the following list can provide information about dis-
counts and other benefits for seniors:
 
✓ AARP (formerly known as the American Association of Retired 
Persons; % 866-687-2277; www.aarp.org) offers member dis-
counts on car rentals and hotels. With a annual membership of $13 
(anyone 50 or older can join), AARP offers members a wide range of 
The best of the Wurst
Your time in Germany will be a good opportunity to introduce your kids to some dishes 
that they’ve never tried. Germany’s ever-present Wurst (voorst; sausage) is 100 per-
cent meat with no filler. For something more familiar, kids can choose from a selection 
of cereals at most buffet breakfasts in hotels; however, the selection may not include 
as many sweetened varieties as in the United States.

 Chapter 9: Catering to Special Needs or Interests 89
benefits, including discounts on US Airways flights to Frankfurt and 
Munich from several U.S. cities and discounts on escorted tours 
from Globus and Cosmos, major tour operators offering trips to 
Germany.
 
✓ Elderhostel (% 877-426-8056) offers people 55 and older a variety 
of university-based education programs in Berlin and throughout 
Germany. These courses are value-packed, hassle-free ways to 
learn while traveling. The price includes airfare, accommodations, 
meals, tuition, tips, and insurance. And you’ll be glad to know that 
you won’t be graded. Popular Germany offerings in 2008 included 
“Art and Culture in Germany and Switzerland (Women Only),” 
“Berlin and Munich: Two German Capitals,” “Opera and Classical 
Music: Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden,” “Discovering German Roots,” and 
“Bavaria to Berlin: Baroque, Bauhaus, and Beyond.”
 
✓ Grand Circle Travel (% 800-959-0405; www.gct.com) offers pack-
age deals and escorted tours for the 50-plus American market, 
mostly of the tour-bus variety but also including river cruises along 
the Mosel and Rhine.
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts 
for seniors include: the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.
travel50andbeyond.com); Travel Unlimited: Uncommon Adventures 
for the Mature Traveler (Avalon); and Unbelievably Good Deals and 
Great Adventures That You Absolutely Can’t Get Unless You’re Over 
50, by Joann Rattner Heilman (McGraw-Hill).
Accessing Germany: Advice for 
People with Disabilities
The German word for disabled is behindert (bee-hin-dert). A disability 
needn’t stop anybody from traveling to Germany, because more options 
and resources are available than ever before. In fact, Germany is one of 
the more advanced countries in Europe when it comes to accessibility 
for disabled travelers.
Locating resources
 
 The German National Tourist Office’s Web site (www.germany-tourism.
de or www.cometogermany.com), with its section on travel for the dis-
abled, is a good place to begin researching your trip. Here are some other 
helpful resources in the United States:
 
✓ The Moss Rehab Hospital (www.mossresourcenet.org) pro-
vides general information on accessible travel.
 
✓ The Society for Accessible Travel & Hospitality (SATH; % 212-
447-7284; fax: 212-725-8253; www.sath.org) offers a wealth of 
travel resources for all types of disabilities and informed

recommendations on destinations, access guides, travel agents, 
tour operators, vehicle rentals, and companion services.
 
✓ AirAmbulanceCard.com is now partnered with SATH and allows 
you to preselect top-notch hospitals in case of an emergency.
 
✓ Mobility International USA (% 541-343-1284; www.miusa.org) 
publishes Survival Strategies for Going Abroad, and a newsletter, 
Over the Rainbow, both available through its Web site.
 
✓ The American Foundation for the Blind (% 800-232-5463; www.
afb.org) provides information on traveling with Seeing Eye dogs.
British travelers with disabilities may want to contact the Royal 
Association for Disability and Rehabilitation (RADAR; 12 City Forum, 
250 City Rd., London EC1V 8AF; % 020/7250-3222; fax: 020/7250-0212; 
www.radar.org.uk), which publishes vacation “fact packs,” containing 
information on trip planning, travel insurance, specialized accommoda-
tions, and transportation abroad.
For more information specifically targeted to travelers with disabilities, 
the community Web site iCan (www.icanonline.net/channels/
travel/index.cfm) has destination guides and several regular col-
umns on accessible travel. Also check out the quarterly magazine 
Emerging Horizons (www.emerginghorizons.com) and Open World 
Magazine (published by SATH).
If you can read German, you may want to use one of these resources:
 
✓ Nationale Koordinationsstelle Tourismus für Alle (NatKo; national 
Tourism Coordination Agency for All People, Kirchfeldstrasse 149, 
40215 Düsseldorf; % 0211/33-68-001; fax: 0211/33-68-760; www.
natko.de) is the central organization in the country for all inqui-
ries concerning barrier-free travel. On the Web site, under Reiseinfos 
(Travel Information), you can find special offers and a list of German 
tour operators offering special tours and travel opportunities.
 
✓ The Web site You-Too (www.you-too.net) has information on the 
accessibility of public buildings throughout Germany, accessible 
accommodations, and accessible activities.
Several organizations offer tours designed to meet the needs of travelers 
with disabilities. Tour operators with trips to Germany include
 
✓ Accessible Journeys (% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339; www.
disabilitytravel.com)
 
✓ S E Unlimited Travel (% 800-552-9798 in the U.S. and Canada, or 
605-366-0202; fax: 605-334-0000; www.seunlimitedtravel.com)
Touring in a Rollstuhl (wheelchair)
Traveling in a Rollstuhl (roll-shtool; wheelchair) presents unique chal-
lenges. For many wheelchair-bound travelers, an escorted tour is a 

 Chapter 9: Catering to Special Needs or Interests 91
necessity. But others want the adventures of being on their own. Thanks 
to its comprehensive accessibility, Germany offers both options.
The international airports in Munich and Frankfurt are wheelchair 
accessible.
Deutsche Bahn (German Rail) offers transportation service for the dis-
abled, including free seating reservations for travelers in wheelchairs. 
Some 385 train stations throughout the country have lifting aids or 
mobile ramps. You can reserve your seat in advance and get information 
about traveling with a disability by calling the special Deutsche Bahn 
number for disabled travelers in Germany at % 01805/512-512. You 
can also find information (in English) for disabled travelers on its Web 
site (www.bahn.de; click on Handicap).
 
 Not all U-Bahn (subway) stations have wheelchair access. However, in 
larger cities, public buses are generally wheelchair accessible.
Many hotels in Berlin, Munich, and the rest of Germany (more in the 
western part than the east) have rooms for the disabled (these tend to 
be in larger, more modern hotels). Most of the older and less expensive 
pensions and guesthouses don’t have elevators, or they may not be wide 
enough for a wheelchair. Ask about this issue before you reserve, or use 
one of the travel agencies that specializes in travel for people with dis-
abilities (see the preceding section).
Although not all restaurants provide wheelchair ramps, most restau-
rants are happy to accommodate people with disabilities.
Most of the top sights in the country are wheelchair accessible, although 
calling ahead to make arrangements and getting directions to special 
entrances and/or elevators always is a good idea. Larger theaters and 
performing-arts venues are often wheelchair accessible, too (again, call 
first). Also keep in mind that in older, historical areas, you have to deal 
with cobblestones.
If you’re interested in gliding down the Mosel and Rhine rivers, looking 
at vineyards and castles, the Köln-Düsseldorfer (KD) line has wheel-
chair-accessible boats. (See Chapter 19 for more about KD and Rhine 
journeys.)
Following the Rainbow: Resources for 
Gays and Lesbians
Germany is one of the most “developed” countries in the world when 
it comes to gay pride, gay culture, and gay tourism. If you are schwul 
(shwool; gay) or lesbisch (lez-bish; lesbian), you’ll find plenty to do in 
Deutschland. Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Munich all have 
large gay communities, but gay life flourishes outside the big cities, too. 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany 
92
A network of gay or gay-friendly restaurants, cafes, stores, bars, dance 
clubs, and community centers exists throughout the country, in small 
towns and large.
 Gay and lesbian couples (or friends) qualify for family tickets on public 
transportation in many Germany cities. With most family, or Gruppen 
(group), tickets, all that matters is that two (or more) individuals travel 
together.
Celebrating gay pride in Germany
Every summer, parades and special events celebrate gay pride. Lesbigay 
travelers may want to time their visits to coincide with these big 
festivals:
 
✓ Berlin holds its annual Gay & Lesbian Street Festival in mid-June, 
celebrates its Christopher Street Day and Parade around the third 
weekend in June, and stages its famous Loveparade in mid-July. 
Find information on the Web at www.berlin.de.
 
✓ Munich celebrates Christopher Street Day in mid-July.
 
✓ Hamburg celebrates with a Gay Pride Parade and Festival around 
June 8 to 10.
 
✓ Cologne’s Christopher Street Weekend usually is the first weekend 
in June.
 
✓ Frankfurt’s Christopher Street Weekend takes place around the 
third weekend in July.
Pride and politics
Perhaps some of the openness of gay life in Germany today has to do with the murder-
ous anti-homosexual policies of the Nazis, leading up to and during World War II. 
Between 1933 and 1945, at least 55,000 homosexuals were deemed criminals, 
arrested, and sent to labor camps, where as many as 15,000 of them died. Those who 
survived never received any form of compensation from postwar German govern-
ments for the persecution they endured. That may explain why German gays and 
lesbians today are so politically active and determined not to tolerate discrimination. 
In 2008, Berlin’s openly gay mayor and the German Minister of Culture unveiled a new 
600,000€ ($870,000) memorial to the homosexual victims of Nazi persecution. Located 
between Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate, in Tiergarten park across from 
the memorial for the 6 million victims of the Holocaust, the simple concrete structure 
has a window with a continuous film loop showing two men kissing.

 Chapter 9: Catering to Special Needs or Interests 93
Finding gay-friendly travel agents and tour operators
If you want to keep your hard-earned travel money pink, you can use a 
gay travel service. The International Gay & Lesbian Travel Association 
(IGLTA; % 800-448-8550; www.iglta.org) maintains a worldwide net-
work of gay and lesbian travel-agent professionals who can help you 
plan your trip. For information on the nearest IGLTA travel agent and 
gay-friendly resources in Germany, contact IGLTA.
Unfortunately, Germany seems to fall below the radar screen of most 
gay tour operators (too bad, because Berlin is such a great destination 
for gay tours).
Researching German lesbigay life on the Web
The German National Tourist Office’s Web site (www.germany-tourism.
de or www.cometogermany.com), with its section on gay and lesbian 
travel, is a good place to begin researching your trip. The following are 
just a few of the other Web sites you may want to check out as you begin 
to plan your trip to Germany:
 
✓ PinkPassport (www.pinkpassport.com): This site is a destination 
service provider for international gay travelers. You can select a 
city in Germany and find out pertinent travel-related information.
 
✓ www.gay-web.de: One of the best all-purpose gay sites — albeit 
the Web site is in German — for lesbigay travelers planning a trip 
to Germany, this site enables you to access a lesbigay guide for 
each city you want to visit.
 
✓ Specific city Web sites: Try the following Web sites for information 
on specific cities: www.berlin.gay-web.de, www.munich.gay-
web.de, www.hamburg.gay-web.de, www.frankfurt.gay-
web.de, www.koeln.gay-web.de, and www.gaykoeln.com.

D
o you have an up-to-date passport? Have you taken steps to meet 
your health needs while on your trip? Are you wondering how to 
use a cellphone or access e-mail while in Germany? This chapter gives 
you the information you need.
Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around the 
world. You can’t cross an international border without one. If you’re a citi-
zen of the United States, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand, you must have a 
valid passport to enter Germany; U.K. residents need a European Union (EU) 
identity card. Getting a passport is easy, but the process takes some time.
Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport, follow these steps:
 
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport 
office; a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office.
 
 To find your regional passport office, either check the U.S. State 
Department passport Web site (http://travel.state.gov/
passport) or call the National Passport Information Center 
(% 877-487-2778) for automated information.
 
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship.
 
 Bringing along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or Social 
Security card also is a good idea.

 Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 95
 
3. Submit two identical passport-size photos, measuring 2 inches by 
2 inches in size.
 
 You often find businesses that take these photos near a passport 
office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a photo-vending machine 
because the pictures aren’t identical. You may submit digital 
photos that have been printed on your printer at home, but they 
must meet the same requirements for all passport photographs. 
In addition, the digital photographs must have a continuous-tone 
image that looks very photolike; grainy-looking photos composed 
of visible dots are not acceptable.
 
4. Pay the fee.
 
 For people 16 and older, a passport is valid for ten years and costs 
$100. For those 15 and younger, a passport is valid for five years 
and costs $85.
 
 Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; processing 
normally takes three weeks, but it can take longer during busy periods 
(especially spring).
If you have a passport in your current name that was issued within the 
past 15 years and you were older than 16 when it was issued, you can 
renew the passport by mail for $75. Whether you’re applying in person 
or by mail, you can download passport applications from the U.S. State 
Department passport Web site (http://travel.state.gov).
American Passport Express (% 800-455-5166; www.americanpassport.
com) is a service that can expedite the processing of your first-time pass-
port application. Using this service, and paying the appropriate fees, you 
can receive your passport in as little as 24 hours.
Applying for other passports
The following list offers more information for citizens of Australia, 
Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom:
 
✓ If you’re an Australian, you can pick up an application from your 
local post office or any branch of Passports Australia, but you 
must schedule an interview at the passport office to present your 
application materials. Call the Australian Passport Information 
Service at % 131-232, or visit the government Web site at www.
passports.gov.au.
 
✓ Canadians can pick up applications at travel agencies throughout 
Canada or from the central Passport Office, Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G3 (% 800-567-
6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Note: Canadian children who travel must 
have their own passports. However, if you hold a valid Canadian 
passport issued before December 11, 2001, that bears the name of 
your child, the passport remains valid for you and your child until 
it expires.

tion, contact the United Kingdom Passport Service (% 0870-521-
0410; www.ukpa.gov.uk).
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
The types of insurance that travelers are most likely to need are trip-
cancellation insurance and medical insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your 
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking. You can get estimates 
from various providers through InsureMyTrip.com. Enter your trip cost 
and dates, your age, and other information, for prices from more than a 
dozen companies.
U.K. citizens and their families who make more than one trip abroad per 
year may find an annual travel insurance policy works out cheaper. 
Check Moneysupermarket.com, which compares prices across a wide 
range of providers for single- and multi-trip policies.
Most big travel agents offer their own insurance and will probably try to 
sell you their package when you book a holiday. Think before you sign. 
Britain’s Consumers’ Association recommends that you insist on seeing 
the policy and reading the fine print before buying travel insurance. The 
Association of British Insurers (% 020/7600-3333; www.abi.org.uk) 
gives advice by phone and publishes Holiday Insurance, a free guide to 
policy provisions and prices. You might also shop around for better deals: 
Try Columbus Direct (% 0870/033- 9988; www.columbusdirect.net).
Here is my advice on trip-cancellation and medical insurance:
 
✓ Trip-cancellation insurance will help retrieve your money if you have 
to back out of a trip or depart early, or if your travel supplier goes 
bankrupt. Trip-cancellation insurance traditionally covers such events 
as sickness, natural disasters, and State Department advisories.

 Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 97
 
 The latest news in trip-cancellation insurance is the availability of 
“any-reason” cancellation coverage, which costs more but covers 
cancellations made for any reason. You won’t get back 100 percent 
of your prepaid trip cost, but you’ll be refunded a substantial por-
tion. TravelSafe (% 888-885-7233; www.travelsafe.com) offers 
both types of coverage. Expedia also offers any-reason cancellation 
coverage for its air-hotel packages. For details, contact one of the 
following recommended insurers: Access America (% 866-807-
3982; www.accessamerica.com); Travel Guard International 
(% 800-826-4919; www.travelguard.com); Travel Insured 
International (% 800-243-3174; www.travelinsured.com); and 
Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-457-4602; www.travelex-
insurance.com).
 
✓ For travel to Europe, you may want to look into medical insurance. 
Most U.S. health plans (including Medicare and Medicaid) do not 
provide coverage, and the ones that do often require you to pay for 
services upfront and reimburse you only after you return home.
 
 If you require additional medical insurance, try MEDEX Assistance 
(% 410-453-6300; www.medexassist.com) or Travel Assistance 
International (% 800-821-2828; www.travelassistance.com; 
for general information on services, call the company’s Worldwide 
Assistance Services, Inc., at % 800-777-8710).
 
 Canadians should check with their provincial health plan offices or 
call Health Canada (% 866-225-0709; www.hc-sc.gc.ca) to find 
out the extent of their coverage and what documentation and 
receipts they must take home in case they are treated overseas.
 
 Travelers from the U.K. should carry their European Health 
Insurance Card (EHIC), which replaced the E111 form as proof 
of entitlement to free/reduced-cost medical treatment abroad 
(% 0845-606-2030; www.ehic.org.uk). Note, however, that the 
EHIC only covers “necessary medical treatment”; for repatriation 
costs, lost money, baggage, or cancellation, travel insurance from 
a reputable company should always be sought. 
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it. Of 
course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more 
than they probably listen to you.
 
 For information on purchasing additional medical insurance for your trip, 
see the preceding section.
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/
or chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart 
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany 
98
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour 
hotline. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance to 
Travelers (IAMAT; % 716-754-4883 in the U.S., 416-652-0137 in Canada; 
www.iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries 
you’re visiting, and lists of local, English-speaking doctors.
Bring all your medications with you, and prescriptions for more (in generic, 
not brand-name, form) if you worry that you’ll run out. (Remember: 
Current airline security regulations do not allow you to carry on liquids 
in containers larger than 3 ounces; if you need to carry medications with 
you onboard, make sure the box or container has the pharmacy’s label 
with your name on it.) A pharmacy in Germany is called an Apotheke 
(ah-po-tay-kuh). Pharmacies are open regular shopping hours, and they 
take turns staying open all night and on weekends. If you have an emer-
gency and need a prescription filled after-hours or on weekends, go to 
any pharmacy; a notice will be posted in the window providing the 
address and telephone number of the closest on-duty pharmacy.
 
 If you fall ill while traveling, ask the concierge or hotelkeeper to recom-
mend a local Arzt (artst; medical doctor). At night and on weekends, you 
can call the Ärtzlicher Notdienst (Medical Emergency Service) listed in 
the telephone directory. In a life-threatening situation, dial % 112 (a free 
call anywhere in Germany), the number for general emergencies. The 
word for hospital is Krankenhaus (kronk-in-house).
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
The cheapest and easiest way to call home from Germany, I’ve found, is 
to use a prepaid phone card and the hotel phone. If you’re accustomed 
to using a cellphone, keep in mind that your U.S. phone won’t work in 
Germany without a special chip, and renting a phone in Germany, although 
possible, costs a lot. Collecting e-mail is fairly easy in Germany: If you 
can’t do it at your hotel, the staff will be able to direct you to the nearest 
cybercafe. In this section, I provide general information on using cell-
phones and e-mail in Germany.
Using a cellphone outside the U.S.
The three letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities 
are GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that 
makes for easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and 
dozens of other countries worldwide. In the U.S., only a limited number 
of carriers use GSM, so you need to check with your carrier; in Canada, 
Microcell and some Rogers customers are GSM, and all Europeans and 
most Australians use GSM.
If your cellphone is on a GSM system, and you have a world-capable 
multiband phone — many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung models 
are so equipped — you can make and receive calls across Europe. Just 
call your wireless operator and ask for international roaming to be 

 Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 99
activated on your account. Unfortunately, per-minute charges can be 
high — usually $1 to $1.50 in western Europe.
That’s why it’s important to buy an unlocked world phone from the get-
go. Many cellphone operators sell locked phones that restrict you from 
using any removable computer memory phone chip (called a SIM card) 
other than the ones they supply. Having an unlocked phone enables you 
to install a cheap, prepaid SIM card (found at a local retailer) in Germany. 
(Show your phone to the salesperson; not all phones work on all networks.) 
You’ll get a local phone number — and much, much lower calling rates. 
Getting an already-locked phone unlocked can be a complicated process, 
but it can be done; just call your cellular operator and say you’ll be going 
abroad for several months and want to use the phone with a local provider.
 
 If you have an unlocked phone, you can purchase a prepaid German SIM 
card with call credit already incorporated and easily add more talk time 
to the SIM card if needed. However, if you want to purchase a German SIM 
card in Germany, you’ll be asked for proof of residency. For that reason, 
you either need to have a friend or relative in Germany purchase the card 
for you or buy one in North America before your departure.
For many, renting a phone is a good idea. Although you can rent a 
phone from any number of German sites, including kiosks at airports 
and at car-rental agencies, I suggest renting the phone before you leave 
home. That way you can give loved ones and business associates your 
new number, make sure the phone works, and take the phone wherever 
you go — especially helpful for overseas trips through several countries. 
Phone rental isn’t cheap; you’ll usually pay $40 to $50 per week, plus air-
time fees of at least a dollar a minute. If you’re traveling to Europe, 
though, local rental companies often offer free incoming calls within 
their home countries, which can save you big bucks. The bottom line: 
Shop around.
 
 In Germany, a mobile phone is called a Handy.
Two good wireless rental companies are InTouch USA (% 800-872-
7626; www.intouchglobal.com) and Roadpost (% 888-290-1606 or 
905-272-5665; www.roadpost.com). Give them your itinerary, and 
they’ll tell you what wireless products you need. InTouch also will 
advise you for free on whether your existing phone will work overseas; 
simply call % 703-222-7161 between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. EST, or go to 
http://intouchglobal.com/travel.htm.
Voice-over Internet Protocol (VOIP)
If you have Web access while traveling, consider a broadband-based 
telephone service (in technical terms, Voice over Internet protocol, or 
VoIP) such as Skype (www.skype.com) or Vonage (www.vonage.com), 
which allow you to make free international calls from your laptop or in a 
cybercafe. Neither service requires the people you’re calling to also 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany 
100
have that service (though there are fees if they do not). Check the Web 
sites for details.
Accessing the Internet away from home
You have any number of ways to check your e-mail and access the Internet 
on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a personal digi-
tal assistant (PDA) or electronic organizer with a modem — gives you 
the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, you still can 
access your e-mail and even your office computer from cybercafes.
Without your own computer
Finding a city in Germany that doesn’t have a few cybercafes is hard to 
do. Although no definitive directory exists for cybercafes — they are, 
after all, independent businesses — two places to start looking are at 
www.cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
Aside from formal cybercafes, most youth hostels nowadays have at 
least one computer with Internet access, and most public libraries 
around the world offer Internet access free or for a small charge. Some 
business centers in large luxury hotels are free for guests, but others 
charge high rates to go online.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet service provider (ISP) 
whether it has a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail 
account. If your ISP doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free 
mail2web service (www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your 
home e-mail. For more flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-
based e-mail account with Gmail (www.gmail.com) or Yahoo! Mail 
(http://mail.yahoo.com). Your home ISP may be able to forward 
your e-mail to the Web-based account automatically.
With your own computer
If you’re bringing your own computer, the current buzzword in com-
puter access is WiFi (short for wireless fidelity), and more and more 
hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as wireless hotspots where 
you can get high-speed connection without cable wires, networking 
hardware, or a phone line. T-Mobile Hotspot (http://hotspot.
t-mobile.com) serves up wireless connections at more than 1,000 
Starbucks coffee shops. Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.
wayport.com) have set up networks in airports and high-class hotel 
lobbies. iPass (www.ipass.com) providers also give you access to a few 
hundred wireless hotel lobby setups. Best of all, you don’t need to be 
staying at the Four Seasons to use the hotel’s network; just set yourself 
up on a nice couch in the lobby. The companies’ pricing policies can be 
byzantine, with a variety of monthly, per-connection, and per-minute 
plans, but in general you pay around $30 a month for limited access — 
and as more and more companies jump on the wireless bandwagon, 
prices are likely to get even more competitive.

 Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 101
If WiFi isn’t available, most business-class hotels throughout Germany 
offer dataports for laptop modems, and many hotels in Germany now 
offer free high-speed Internet access using an Ethernet network cable. 
Call your hotel in advance to see what your options are.
In addition, major ISPs have local access numbers around the world, 
enabling you to go online by simply placing a local call. Check your ISP’s 
Web site or call its toll-free number and ask how you can use your cur-
rent account in Germany, and how much it will cost. If you’re traveling 
outside the reach of your ISP, the iPass network has dial-up numbers in 
most of the world’s countries. You’ll have to sign up with an iPass pro-
vider, which then tells you how to set up your computer for your desti-
nation. For a list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com and click on 
Individual Purchase. One solid provider is i2roam (% 866-811-6209 or 
920-235-0475; www.i2roam.com).
 
 If you’re taking your laptop with you to Germany, make sure you bring a 
connection kit of the right power and phone adapters, a spare phone 
cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or find out whether your 
hotel supplies them to guests.
Keeping Up with Airline Security
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S. 
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be 
fine as long as you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight 
and two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an 
airline employee, and she’ll probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license 
or passport (for international flights, you’ll need to show your passport 
at check-in). Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security 
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children 17 and under do not 
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for 
international flights to most countries.)
E-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. If you have an 
E-ticket, you can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic 
kiosks or even online check-in. Online check-in involves logging on to 
your airline’s Web site, accessing your reservation, and printing out 
your boarding pass — and the airline may even offer you bonus miles to 
do so. At present, online check-in is available for domestic flights only; if 
you’re flying on to Germany you’ll have to use the “old-fashioned” air-
port check-in at the airline’s ticket counter, and you’ll be required to 
show your passport at that time.
Security-checkpoint lines are getting shorter, but some doozies remain. If 
you have trouble standing for long periods of time, tell an airline employee; 
the airline will provide a wheelchair. Speed up security by not wearing 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Germany 
102
metal objects such as big belt buckles. If you have metallic body parts, a 
note from your doctor can prevent a long chat with the security screen-
ers. Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you 
can’t. Travelers in the U.S. are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a personal 
item, such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can 
stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, 
it’s considered a personal item. The Transportation Security Administra-
tion (TSA) has issued a list of restricted items; go to www.tsa.gov/
travelers/airtravel/prohibited/permitted-prohibited-
items.shtm for details.
The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are okay, and 
food must be passed through the X-ray machine. Bottled water and other 
beverages are not permitted. All liquids and gels that you carry on must 
be in containers holding 3 ounces or less, in a clear 1-quart re-sealable 
plastic bag, and removed from your carry-on luggage before it goes 
through the X-ray screener. (Go to www.tsa.gov/311/index.shtm for 
more information.)
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be 
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that enable 
screeners to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is neces-
sary. Look for Travel Sentry–certified locks at luggage or travel shops 
and Brookstone stores (or online at www.brookstone.com). These 
locks are approved by the TSA and can be opened by luggage inspectors 
with a special code or key. If you use something other than TSA-
approved locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent 
needs to hand-search your luggage.

Part III
Northern and 
Eastern Germany

In this part . . .
H
istory has left its mark throughout northern and east-
ern Germany, and nowhere more so than in Berlin, the 
country’s “new” capital. I devote two chapters to Berlin. 
Chapter 11 fi lls you in on all the Berlin basics: getting there, 
getting around, and fi nding the best hotels and restaurants. I 
devote Chapter 12 to exploring the largest and most exciting 
city in Germany.
Northern Germany, bordering the Baltic and North seas, is 
the focus of Chapter 13. I tell you all about Hamburg, the 
region’s largest city and greatest port. From Hamburg you 
can make an easy side trip to beautiful Lübeck, with so many 
historic buildings that UNESCO recognizes the city as a World 
Heritage Site, or Bremen, full of proud reminders of its seafar-
ing past. All three of these cities were members of the power-
ful Hanseatic League that ruled the seas and dominated trade 
in northern Europe for hundreds of years.
Since reunifi cation in 1990, eastern Germany has been in the 
midst of a major building and rebuilding boom. In Chapter 14, 
I introduce you to the best places to visit: Dresden, with its 
superb museums, historic panache, and location on the Elbe 
River; Leipzig, a busy business city where the “peaceful revolu-
tion” began; and Weimar, city of Goethe and one of Germany’s 
cultural jewels. In Chapter 14, I also tell you about visiting the 
Thuringian Forest and taking a boat trip into the scenic region 
known as Saxon Switzerland.

B
erlin is, for my money, the most exciting city in Europe, and I would 
urge anyone visiting Germany to spend at least a couple of days 
there. A sense of immediacy permeates Berlin because everything is 
happening at once — past, present, and future meet and meld and col-
lide all over the place. You can dive into Berlin on many levels, even if 
you don’t speak German. Your experiences can be as sophisticated, cul-
tured, or raunchy as you want them to be.
Berlin has a kind of inexhaustible energy, a fizz and a flair and a drive 
that you find nowhere else in Germany. Berliners, perhaps because 
they’ve been through so much, both triumph and tragedy, have always 
been a breed apart. Their cosmopolitan live-and-let-live attitude, laced 
with sharp-edged humor and sarcastic irreverence, gives the city an 
added bite. When you’re in Berlin, you see a city in transition, part of the 
reason why a visit here is so intriguing.
But, even as the city reinvents itself yet again, “Berlin bleibt doch Berlin.” 
That old song lyric meaning “Berlin always remains Berlin” still holds 
true. This city has seen it all — Prussian power, artistic brilliance, end-
less political upheaval, and Nazi terror — and survived to tell the tale. 
By the end of World War II, most of Berlin was reduced to smoldering 
rubble. The city was divided into U.S., British, French, and Russian sec-
tors. Later, during the Berlin Airlift of 1948, food and supplies had to be 
flown in because the Soviets blockaded the city. The wall went up in 
1961, and for almost 30 years, Berlin was split in two, physically and 
politically. Now, with the wall down and Deutschland reunited, Berlin 
once again is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany. In many 
ways it’s an entirely new city — and yet, “Berlin bleibt doch Berlin.”

106
Getting There
You can arrive in Germany’s capital and largest city by plane, train, 
or car.
By plane
Continental and Delta are the only U.S. airlines to offer direct flights to 
Berlin from within the United States. (Continental flies from Newark to 
Berlin Tegel; Delta flies from JFK to Berlin Tegel.) On all other flights 
from the United States, you have to change planes in Frankfurt or 
another European city, depending on which airline you use. Berlin has 
two airports, both with easy public-transportation connections to the 
city at standard public fares.
Arriving at Berlin International Airport in Tegel
Tegel (TXL) airport (% 0180/5000-186; www.berlin-airport.de), 
Berlin’s main and most convenient airport, is on the outskirts of central 
Berlin in Reinickedorf, 8km (5 miles) from the city center. Inside the ter-
minal, you find currency-exchange windows and a small branch of the 
tourist information center (no phone; open daily 7:30 a.m.–7 p.m.) 
where you can pick up free city-transit maps and general-interest bro-
chures and buy a bus ticket into town.
To get into central Berlin from Tegel, you can take a bus or taxi, both 
found in clearly marked spots right outside the airport terminal. On the 
bus, use euro coins (no bills) to buy your ticket from the driver. Four 
buses run from the airport into central Berlin; tickets for each of them 
cost 2.10€ ($2.80), the regular two-zone A/B fare. (For information on 
public transportation, see “Getting Around Berlin,” later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Jet Express TXL Bus runs about every ten minutes between the air-
port and Alexanderplatz, Unter den Linden, and the Hauptbahnhof 
(main train station) in Mitte, the center of Berlin.
 
✓ Bus X9, another express bus, connects to the Jakob-Kaiser-Platz 
U-Bahn (underground train) station. From there you can change to 
the subway and reach any destination. The X9 also goes to the 
Bahnhof Zoologischer Garten (Zoo Station), the central train sta-
tion in the western part of the city near Kurfürstendamm. The X9 
takes about 20 minutes to reach Zoo Station.
 
✓ Bus 109 also goes to Zoo Station; it travels down Kurfürstendamm 
and takes about 30 minutes. At the train station, you can connect to 
the U-Bahn or the S-Bahn (elevated train). Berlin’s main tourist 
information center is at the nearby Neues Kranzler Eck (see 
“Finding Information after You Arrive” later in this chapter).
 
✓ Bus 128 connects to the U9 U-Bahn stop at Osloer Strasse.
A taxi ride to central Berlin (east or west) costs 16€ to 20€ ($22–$27) and 
takes about 20 minutes.

 Chapter 11: Settling Into Berlin 107
Arriving at Berlin-Schönefeld
Schönefeld (SXF; % 01805/000-186; www.berlin-airport.de), 
located about 18km (11 miles) southeast of the city, is the old East 
Berlin airport, now mostly used for low-cost airlines and European char-
ter flights. The easiest way to get into town from this airport is by 
Airport Express, an S-Bahn that leaves the Flughafen Berlin-Schönefeld 
station every 30 minutes for central Berlin, stopping at Alexanderplatz 
and Fredrichstrasse in Berlin Mitte (eastern Berlin), and Bahnhof Zoo 
(about a 30-minute journey) in the western part of Berlin. The S-Bahn 
station is a ten-minute walk from the airport terminal, or you can take 
Bus 171, a shuttle service that runs from the airport to the S-Bahn sta-
tion and on to the Rudow U-Bahn station. From the U-Bahn station, you 
can take the U7 subway to Bahnhof Zoo in about 50 minutes. Bus, 
U-Bahn, or S-Bahn fare is 2.80€ ($3.80).
A taxi ride to the Alexanderplatz area in Mitte takes 45 to 60 minutes and 
costs about 28€ ($38). Taxis wait outside the terminal.
By train
You can reach Berlin by train from everywhere in Europe. All long-
distance trains now arrive and depart from the spectacular new 
Hauptbahnhof (main train station). The Hauptbahnhof and all of Berlin’s 
smaller railway stations (for regional service) are connected to public 
buses, subways (U-Bahn), and elevated trains (S-Bahn).
 
 For 24-hour train information, call Deutsche Bahn (% 11861) or visit the 
Web site www.bahn.de, which has information in English.
Arriving at Berlin’s Hauptbahnhof
All long-distance high-speed trains now arrive at and depart from the 
Hauptbahnhof, Europa Platz 1 (% 0800-1507090 for train schedules; 
A tale of three airports
Tempelhof, built in the 1920s, was Berlin’s main airport during the Third Reich. The air-
port also was the base for the Berlin Airlift in 1948, when U.S. and other Allied forces 
brought food and supplies to the city during the Soviet blockade. During the Cold War, 
the U.S.-built Tegel airport served West Berlin, while another airport, Schönefeld, 
served travelers to the city’s Communist, eastern sector.
As part of a new plan for Berlin airports, Tempelhof was closed in October 2007 (it will 
be turned into a park) and a massive $4-billion expansion of Schönefeld airport now is 
underway. When the project is completed, in 2011, Tegel also will close. All air traffic 
will then be consolidated into a single hub called Berlin Brandenburg International 
Airport.

www.hbf-berlin.de), Europe’s newest and largest train station. Until 
2006, when this spectacular travel hub opened, reunified Berlin was 
served by several smaller stations. Now, for the first time in its history, 
Berlin has one central station. Unless you arrive by a local, regional 
train, you’ll be pulling into this remarkable, user-friendly terminal.
Hauptbahnhof is an enormous place, but it’s been designed to facilitate 
up to 300,000 travelers every day with a minimum of confusion. Trains 
arrive and depart on the lowest level (track numbers easily identified); 
elevators (the entire station is barrier-free) or escalators carry you up to 
the first and second floors, where you find dozens of shops and food 
vendors. On the main floor at the north end of the station there’s a 
BERLIN infostore (open daily 8 a.m.–10 p.m.), the name given to Berlin’s 
tourist information centers. Here you can use the hotel booking service; 
buy the Berlin Welcome Card (described under “Getting Around Berlin,” 
later in this chapter); the SchauLUST-MuseenBERLIN museum pass (see 
Chapter 12); maps and Berlin-related books; and tickets to all of Berlin’s 
opera houses, concert venues, and theaters (half-price tickets are sold 
for performances that day). The station has two travel centers, where 
you can purchase train tickets and make seat reservations (both centers 
open daily 6 a.m.–10 p.m.).
Whether you’re staying in western or eastern Berlin, getting to your 
hotel from the Hauptbahnhof couldn’t be easier. The entrance to the 
S-Bahn (marked by a green S) is on the second floor of the station; the 
entrance to the U-Bahn (marked by a U) is on the first floor.
By car
Four autobahn (freeway) routes enter Berlin from western Germany; 
three enter from the east. The drive from Frankfurt or Munich takes 
about eight hours, depending on traffic. After you’re in Berlin, however, 
a car is a nuisance. In fact, you’ll want to keep the car parked at your 
hotel or in a garage. Unless you know this huge city well, getting around 
by public transportation is far easier than by car. (See “Driving a car,” 
later in this chapter, for general driving tips in the city.)
The fate of Bahnhof Zoologischer Garten
Usually called Bahnhof Zoo (Zoo Station; Hardenbergplatz 11; % 01805/996-633), this 
was the main western train station until the Hauptbahnhof opened in 2006. Located 
close to Kurfürstendamm, the main artery in western Berlin, it’s now used only for 
regional trains but remains a busy hub for local U-Bahn and S-Bahn trains. Inside the 
old station, the train travel office Reisezentrum Bahnhof Zoo (% 030/19419) is open 
daily from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. to handle train tickets and information. At the BVG-Pavilion 
outside the station, you can pick up a free public-transportation map and buy tickets 
and special passes for buses, underground trains (U-Bahn), and elevated trains 
(S-Bahn); the pavilion is open daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.

 Chapter 11: Settling Into Berlin 109
Finding Information after You Arrive
At a BERLIN infostore, you can find information or book a hotel room. 
You can also buy the Berlin Welcome Card (see “Transportation basics,” 
later in this chapter), the SchauLUST-MuseenBERLIN museum pass (see 
Chapter 12), bus and subway tickets, and half-price music and theater 
tickets. Berlin has five walk-in infostores:
 
✓ The main office in western Berlin is in the shopping “passage” 
called Neues Kranzler Eck, Kurfürstendamm 21 (at Joachimstaler 
Strasse), close to Bahnhof Zoo (U-/S-Bahn: Zoologischer Garten). 
The office is open April through October Monday through Saturday 
from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; November 
through March daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
 
✓ In eastern Berlin, you find infostore branches in the south wing of 
the Brandenburg Gate (U-/S-Bahn: Unter den Linden), open daily 
from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; in the Hauptbahnhof (see “Arriving at 
Berlin’s Hauptbahnhof,” earlier in this chapter); and in the Berlin 
Pavilion at the Reichstag, Scheidermannstrasse. It’s open daily 
from 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
 
✓ Another infostore is located under the Fernsehturm (Television 
Tower) at Alexanderplatz. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
The infostores operate one information line (% 030/25-00-25), open 
Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., weekends 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
It costs a minimum of 0.40€ (50¢) per minute.

is available in English.
Orienting Yourself in Berlin
Covering some 60 square miles, Berlin is one of the world’s largest cities. 
For first-time visitors, getting a handle on this sprawling, complex 
metropolis can be difficult. Even though the wall has been down since 
1989, the first and simplest way to understand Berlin is still to think in 
terms of the old political boundaries of West and East. (See the “Berlin 
Neighborhoods” map in this chapter.)
Introducing western Berlin
From 1961 to 1989, West Berlin was an island of capitalism inside 
Communist East Germany. West Berlin was richer, showier, and wilder 
than its drab eastern counterpart. The city’s main attractions now are 
spread almost evenly across the whole city.
West Berlin’s glitziest artery was — and remains — the 4km-long (21⁄2-
mile) boulevard known as Kurfürstendamm, or the Ku-Damm for short.

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
112
The train station Bahnhof Zoologischer Garten, or Bahnhof Zoo for 
short, near the Ku-Damm, is the major transportation hub on the west-
ern side of the city and a good landmark for orienting yourself. The zoo 
itself is part of the Tiergarten, a beautiful park stretching east and 
ending at the cultural center known as the Kulturforum, near Potsdamer 
Platz.
Charlottenburg
The district known as Charlottenburg is the wealthiest and most com-
mercialized in western Berlin. Along the famous Ku-Damm, which runs 
through it, you find the best concentration of hotels, restaurants, the-
aters, cafes, nightclubs, shops, and department stores. The 22-story 
Europa Center, a shopping center and entertainment complex, rises just 
across the plaza from the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtnis Kirche (Memorial 
Church) near the Ku-Damm and Zoo Station. Charlottenburg’s regal cen-
terpiece is Schloss Charlottenburg (Charlottenburg Palace), with its 
lovely gardens and nearby museums: the Bröham Museum and the 
Berggruen Sammlung (Collection). Charlottenburg also is the home of 
the Deutsche Oper Berlin (German Opera House), one of Berlin’s three 
opera houses. Upscale shops, restaurants, and cafes fill the neighbor-
hood around Savignyplatz, a tree-lined square a short walk north of 
Kurfürstendamm. Charlottenburg, which has plenty of hotels and pen-
sions (bed-and-breakfasts), makes a convenient base for visitors.
Dahlem
Now the university district, Dahlem originally was established as an 
independent village to the southwest of Berlin’s center. Until reunifica-
tion, Dahlem was the site of western Berlin’s major museums; however, 
most of them have now moved into the city. This neighborhood no 
longer is a convenient place to stay, but you may want to come here to 
visit the Brücke Museum or the Ethnologisches Museum (Ethnology 
Museum).
Kreuzberg
Filled with 19th-century tenement buildings (called Hinterhöf, because 
they have an interior courtyard) constructed for the workers of a rapidly 
industrializing Prussia, Kreuzberg traditionally has been the poorest and 
most crowded of western Berlin’s districts. Today, about 35 percent of 
its population is composed of Gastarbeiter (guest workers) from Turkey, 
the former Yugoslavia, and Greece, many of whom have now lived here 
for 30 years or more. Starting in the 1960s and 1970s, the district became 
home to the city’s artistic countercultural scene. Although gentrification 
is taking place, the neighborhood remains funky around the edges, with 
lots of bars and clubs. Kreuzberg is where you find the new Jüdisches 
Museum (Jewish Museum) and the small museum called Mauermuseum 
Haus am Checkpoint Charlie, dedicated to the history of divided Berlin. 
The area is more residential than hotel-oriented.

 Chapter 11: Settling Into Berlin 113
Schöneberg
Like Kreuzberg, Schöneberg developed in the 19th century as an inde-
pendent suburb for workers. After World War II, the area was rebuilt as 
a middle-class neighborhood. The borough is centrally located, close to 
the Ku-Damm, with good U-Bahn connections and many hotels and pen-
sions. Berlin’s densest concentration of gay bars and clubs is in 
Schöneberg between Nollendorfplatz and Victoria-Luise-Platz.
Tiergarten
The name Tiergarten means “Animal Garden,” and it refers both to west-
ern Berlin’s massive urban park and a business-residential district of the 
same name. The Tiergarten park, originally intended as a backdrop to 
the grand avenues laid out by the German kaisers, contains the Berlin 
Zoo in its southwest corner. The Hansaviertel (Hansa Quarter), occupy-
ing the northwest section of Tiergarten, contains a series of residential 
buildings designed in the late 1950s by different architects, including Le 
Corbusier, Walter Gropius, and Alvar Aalto. The Tiergarten neighbor-
hood also contains the Kulturforum, home of the Philharmonie 
(Philharmonic Hall), the famed Gemäldegalerie (Painting Gallery), the 
Neue Nationalgalerie (New National Gallery), and other museums. 
Tiergarten also is where you find the Brandenburg Gate and the 
Reichstag (Parliament) building. Tiergarten is one of the best areas in 
Berlin for hotels and restaurants.
Wilmersdorf
The huge park called the Grünewald (groo-nuh-vald) takes up the west-
ern portion of this borough. This 38-sq.-km (15-sq.-mile) lake-filled forest 
begins just beyond the western edge of the Kurfürstendamm and is 
Berlin’s largest uninterrupted wooded area. Wannsee is the most popu-
lar lake for swimming and boating. Closer in, toward the Ku-Damm, 
Wilmersdorf is a quiet residential neighborhood filled with an excellent 
assortment of hotels and pensions and plenty of low-key restaurants and 
cafes. All in all, Wilmersdorf is a very pleasant borough in which to stay.
Introducing Berlin-Mitte (Berlin Center)
Berlin-Mitte, also called Stadtmitte (City Center) or just plain Mitte 
(Center), is the new name of the central section of former East Berlin. 
Before the war and the division of the city, this area was, in fact, the 
center of Berlin. The oldest and most historic part of Berlin, Berlin-Mitte 
has numerous attractions. I recommend giving this fascinating area at 
least a full day of your time.
Berlin-Mitte symbolically begins at Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg 
Gate, on the east side of Tiergarten park. Both areas formerly stood 
behind the Berlin Wall and now are full of new buildings. The grand 
boulevard called Unter den Linden, which starts at the Brandenburg 
Gate and extends east, is lined with 18th- and 19th-century palaces 
and monuments. The Staatsoper Unter den Linden is the main

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
114
opera house in eastern Berlin. (The Komische Oper, Berlin’s third opera 
house, also is in Berlin-Mitte.) The beautiful neoclassical square called 
Gendarmenmarkt, just off Unter den Linden, is where you find the mag-
nificently restored early-19th-century Schauspielhaus (Theater), now 
called Konzerthaus am Gendarmenmarkt and used for concerts. At the 
eastern end of Unter den Linden, you find the marvelous Museumsinsel 
(Museum Island), site of four major museums.
Friedrichstrasse, which intersects Unter den Linden, has regained its 
prewar reputation as Berlin’s preeminent shopping street. Luxury bou-
tiques and department stores crowd the street. U-Bahn and S-Bahn lines 
converge at Friedrichstrasse train station, the transportation hub of 
Berlin-Mitte.
Alexanderplatz, a square named for Russian Czar Alexander I, was the 
center of activity in the Soviet era. It’s now being completely redone, 
and not to everyone’s liking: Eight skyscrapers will eventually surround 
Alexanderplatz and reduce the prominence of the Soviet-era Fernsehturm 
(TV tower), at 368m (1,207 ft.), one of the highest structures in Europe.
The Nikolaiviertel (Nicholas Quarter), just south of Alexanderplatz 
along the Spree River, is a charming area restored to look as it did (with 
some contemporary touches) in Berlin’s medieval and baroque eras. 
Period taverns and riverside restaurants make this quarter ideal for a 
leisurely and picturesque stroll.
Prenzlauer Berg, northeast of Mitte, is now the hippest neighborhood in 
eastern Berlin and a favored spot for young Berliners to live. Except to 
check out the ongoing gentrification, short-term travelers will find little 
of interest. Gay and lesbian visitors may want to explore Prenzlauer 
Berg’s burgeoning gay cafe and club scene.
Getting Around Berlin
Berlin is a huge city, and even dedicated walkers won’t be able to cover 
it entirely on foot. Luckily, Berlin has a comprehensive public-transpor-
tation system. The following sections describe the various options you 
have for getting from place to place.
Going public: U-Bahn, S-Bahn, bus, and Strassenbahn
Berlin’s excellent public-transportation system makes getting around 
fast, convenient, safe, and relatively inexpensive. The system consists of 
the U-Bahn (underground train), the S-Bahn (surface or elevated train), 
buses, ferries on the lakes, and a few Strassenbahnen (streetcars) that 
still operate in eastern Berlin only. This well-integrated public-transport 
system is run by BVG, Berlin’s Transport Authority (% 030/19449 
24-hour information line; www.bvg.de). For a map of Berlin’s U-Bahn 
and S-Bahn, see the inside back cover of this book.

 Chapter 11: Settling Into Berlin 115
Transportation basics
You can buy your ticket at any U-Bahn station (at windows or machines 
that have English translations) or from a bus driver. You can also buy 
tickets and passes (and receive a free transportation map) at the BVG-
Pavillion on Hardenbergplatz, directly outside Zoo Station; the office is 
open daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.
The fare is based on three zones (A, B, and C). One ticket enables you to 
change from U-Bahn to S-Bahn and to a bus or streetcar during a two-
hour period. All your sightseeing within the Berlin city limits will be in 
zones A and B. Zone C extends far beyond the city’s borders, all the way 
to Potsdam.
A regular Normaltarif or Einzelfahrscheine (one-way fare), good for 
two hours in zones A and B is 2.10€ ($2.80).
For short hops (three consecutive U- or S-Bahn stops or six stops on a 
bus or streetcar), you can get a Kurzstrecke (short-stretch) ticket for 
1.30€ ($1.75).
 
 When purchasing tickets for public transportation, you have several 
money-saving options, including the following:
 
✓ A Tageskarte (day ticket) is good on all forms of transportation 
from validation until 3 a.m. the following day and costs 6.10€ 
($8.25) for zones A and B.
 
✓ If you’re in Berlin for two days, consider the Berlin Welcome Card, 
which costs 17€ ($22) for 48 hours or 22€ ($30) for 72 hours. The 
card is good for all public transportation in central Berlin (zones A 
and B) and provides price reductions of up to 50 percent at many 
tourist attractions in Berlin. If you’re going to Potsdam to see Sans 
Souci, the same card is available for zones A, B, and C.
 
✓ The 7-Tageskarte (seven-day ticket) costs 26€ ($35) for zones A 
and B.
 
 The entire transportation system runs on an honor system — you won’t 
find turnstiles or ticket collectors. You must validate your ticket by stick-
ing it into one of the validation boxes on all U-Bahn and S-Bahn platforms 
or inside buses and streetcars. Long-term tickets are validated only once, 
before your first trip. Ticket inspectors may suddenly appear to check 
everyone’s ticket. If yours hasn’t been validated, you’re guilty of 
Schwarzfahren (black travel) and fined 75€ ($101) on the spot.
U-Bahn (underground train)
The subway in Berlin is called the U-Bahn. Nine lines crisscross the 
city in all directions and extend to the far reaches of Brandenburg. A 
large U in a blue box identifies each station, and the routes are clearly 
marked in all stations and in the trains. Service is fast and efficient, but 
after midnight only two lines — U9 and U2 — run on a limited schedule; 

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
116
they intersect at Bahnhof Zoo. In each car, you find a map of the stops, 
which are announced.
S-Bahn (elevated train)
The venerable elevated train system in Berlin is called the S-Bahn. 
Thirteen lines cover most of central Berlin; each car contains a map of 
the stops, which are announced. A large S in a green circle identifies 
each station. S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations sometimes overlap, so you can 
change from one to the other. Service is basically nonexistent after 
midnight.
 
 The S-Bahn is particularly handy if you’re going from Bahnhof Zoo east to 
the Friedrichstrasse/Unter den Linden area or southwest to Grünewald 
and the lakes.
Bus
Riding atop one of Berlin’s double-decker buses (single-deckers also 
operate) is a fun way to see the city. A green H (for Haltstelle, or stop) in 
a yellow circle identifies each stop. Regular service begins about 5 a.m. 
and ends about midnight. Night buses (designated with an N) leave 
every half-hour, going west and east, from Bahnhof Zoo and Bahnhof 
Hackescher Markt (near Alexanderplatz in eastern Berlin).
 
 One of the best and cheapest sightseeing routes is on bus no. 100 or 200, 
which leave from Bahnhof Zoo and travel through the Tiergarten, passing 
Bellevue Palace (the Berlin residence of the German president), the 
Reichstag, and the Victory Column all the way to the Brandenburg Gate, 
Unter den Linden, Museum Island, and Alexanderplatz.
Strassenbahn (streetcar)
Streetcars, called Strassenbahnen, run in eastern Berlin only. Because 
you can get practically everywhere on the U-Bahn or S-Bahn, you proba-
bly won’t be using the streetcar. Ticket prices are the same as for the 
U-Bahn, S-Bahn, and buses.
Taking a taxi
Thousands of ivory-colored taxis cruise Berlin’s main streets. Hailing 
one during the day is easier than at night. The fare starts at 3€ ($4.05) 
and costs 1.60€ ($2.20) per kilometer (1⁄2 mile). For short distances, flag 
down a taxi and ask for the Kurzstretckentarif: a special rate (3.50€/$4.70) 
for a short lift of up to 2km (11⁄2 miles). To order a taxi, call % 44-33-22 
or 0800-22-22-55. Tip taxi drivers by rounding up to the nearest euro and 
adding an additional euro.
Driving a car
I don’t recommend renting ein Auto in Berlin. Local drivers tend to be 
aggressive, and the street system itself can be fiendishly difficult to navi-
gate. The public-transport system gets you everywhere you want at a 

 Chapter 11: Settling Into Berlin 117
fraction of the cost. If you’re out very late, you can grab a cab to get 
back to your hotel. The only time a car may be useful is when you 
want to explore the surrounding countryside. The offices for Hertz 
(Budapester Strasse 37; % 030/262-1053) and Avis (Budapester Strasse 
43; % 030/230-9370) are close to Bahnhof Zoo.
 
 If you drive in town, be aware that the right lanes in inner-city areas are 
often reserved for buses, taxis, and bicycles only. When turning right, you 
must give way to any vehicle (including bikes) in that lane. Some right-
hand lanes are reserved for buses at stated times and otherwise can be 
used by cars. Also remember that in Germany, using a cellphone while 
driving is against the law.
 
 In Berlin and throughout Germany, cars can park only on the right side of 
the road. In most inner-city areas, you must obtain a parking ticket at one 
of the street-side ticket machines to display on your dashboard. The 
police quickly tow cars that violate these laws. If that happens, you can go 
to any police station to find out where your car is. The whole process 
costs more than 150€ ($203) — and a great deal of time. Parking garages 
are more expensive than street parking, but they save you the potential 
hassle of getting towed.
Staying in Style
Finding a hotel room in Berlin is easy, unless a big trade fair or soccer 
match is happening in town. Prices generally are lower than in other 
major European cities. (You can find a good hotel in Berlin for less than 
150€/$203 a night.) I do, however, strongly recommend that you reserve 
your room before you arrive.
 
 If you arrive in Berlin without a hotel room, you can go to one of the 
BERLIN infostores (for locations and opening hours see “Finding 
Information after You Arrive,” earlier in this chapter), where the staff will 
help you find a room. You can also book hotels by calling % 030/25-00-25 
or going online to www.visitberlin.de.
For locations of the hotels in this chapter, see the “Western Berlin 
Accommodations and Dining” and “Berlin-Mitte Accommodations and 
Dining” maps.
The top hotels
Also see Chapter 22 for details on two of the city’s best hotels, Grand 
Hyatt Berlin ($$$$) and Hotel Adlon Kempinski ($$$$).
 
 Arco Hotel
$ Schöneberg
This small hotel is housed in a four-story turn-of-the-century building on 
a quiet street near the Ku-Damm. Most of the 21 fairly large rooms have

 Artemisia
$ Charlottenburg
Located on the top floors of a large apartment building, Artemisia is an 
excellent hotel for women only. The rooms are large, light, and free of frou-
frou but still have a warm ambience heightened by splashes of color. Ten 
of the 12 rooms have toilets and small showers. You can save money by

 Bleibtreu Hotel
$$–$$$$ Charlottenburg
If you’re looking for chic, central, contemporary digs near the Ku-Damm, 
this 60-room boutique hotel is the place for you. The rooms aren’t particu-
larly large but are artfully designed and furnished. The furniture coverings 
are hypoallergenic, and no chemicals of any kind are used for cleaning. 
The small, stylish bathrooms have sinks of carved stone. Other features 
include remote-control-operated lights, wireless phones, fax machines in 
every suite, and electric awnings over street-facing windows. The hotel 
has a Wellness Center where you can take a pore-cleansing sauna. Deli 31, 
near the small lobby, lays out a healthy breakfast buffet (an extra 17€/$23) 
and morphs into a New York–inspired deli that serves sandwiches and 
burgers as well as traditional German specialties. Children 11 and under 
stay free in their parents’ rooms.

Hotel Alsterhof Berlin
$–$$$$ Wilmersdorf
Location — just a few minutes’ walk from Bahnhof Zoo and the Ku-Damm — is 
this hotel’s greatest asset. If you’re in Berlin on business and need a reason-
ably priced full-service hotel in a central location, this place fills the bill. The 
200 rooms are comfortable and quiet, and have plenty of extra amenities 
(trouser press, safe, minibar, hair dryer), although they aren’t particularly 
stylish. A pool and sauna are on the sixth floor. The breakfast buffet costs 
16€ ($22).

Hotel Brandenburger Hof
$$$$ Charlottenburg
The beautifully appointed, 86-room Hotel Brandenburger Hof offers supe-
rior service, an on-site spa, and one of the top restaurants in Berlin. 
Centrally located in western Berlin, this hotel is close to the Ku-Damm and 
the Tiergarten. The guest rooms are unusually large for Berlin and fur-
nished in an elegant Bauhaus style that is rarely encountered in other 
hotels. Bathrooms have wood and granite finishes. You can enjoy the 
sumptuous breakfast buffet, included in the price of the room, in a glass-
walled conservatory built around a Japanese garden. The hotel’s gourmet 
restaurant, Die Quadriga, earned a Michelin star (see “Dining Out,” later 
in this chapter).

Hotel Domus
$$–$$$ Wilmersdorf
Set in an unusually pretty section of Wilmersdorf, down the street from St. 
Ludwig’s Church and within walking distance of the Ku-Damm, this 
modern 73-room hotel has a calm, appealing simplicity. The spacious 
rooms are quiet (thanks to soundproof windows) and tastefully decorated 
with high-quality contemporary furniture (lots of light-colored wood). 
Rooms face the inner courtyard or the street. The bathrooms are unusu-
ally large and have either a shower or a tub. Breakfast is served in a lovely 
dining room. Free high-speed Internet service is a nice bonus.

120€–150€ ($162–$202) double. Rates include breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
 
 Hotel-Pension Elegia
$ Charlottenburg
This modest pension ideally situated in Charlottenburg is one of the best 
deals in western Berlin. The 12 rooms, all on the second floor of a turn-of-the-
century apartment building (no elevator), are simple and clean. Three street-
facing rooms have balconies; the rooms facing the Hinterhof (courtyard) can 
be a bit dark, but they’re very quiet. There’s also a two-bedroom apartment. 
Breakfast costs an additional 6.50€ ($8.80) and is brought to your room, but 
there are lots of cafes in the area if you’d rather go elsewhere.

Kempinski Hotel Bristol, Berlin
$$$$ Ku-Damm
One of Berlin’s most famous luxury hotels, the 301-room Kempinski Hotel 
Bristol is right in the thick of things on the Ku-Damm in western Berlin. 
This place has high-toned classic styling and impeccable service. Every 
room is unique, but the general color scheme favors dark blues and greens 
enlivened by lustrous wood finishes. The bathrooms are large and have 
double sinks. Amenities include a business center, a fitness center, a big 
pool, and 24-hour room service. Children 11 and under stay free in their 
parents’ rooms. The breakfast buffet costs an additional 25€ ($34).

 Pension Nürnberger Eck
$ Charlottenburg
If you’re seeking an atmospheric old-fashioned pension, try this one on 
the second floor of a building near the Europa Center, a shopping and 
entertainment complex. High-ceilinged rooms with heavy doors open off 
a long, dark hallway. Although the eight rooms are stylistically something 
of a mishmash, with patterned wallpaper, Oriental rugs, and big pieces of 
furniture, the pension does convey an Old Berlin charm. The bathrooms 
are a decent size, and the breakfast room is pleasant.

Savoy Hotel
$$–$$$$ Charlottenburg
The quietly charming Savoy, which opened in 1930, has played host to 
more than a few celebrities through the years. You can’t beat the location, 
just a skip from the Ku-Damm, or the unobtrusively efficient service. The 
125 rooms provide spacious and comfortable accommodations, with large 
bathrooms, but don’t look for any modern design touches here; the hotel 
is completely up-to-date with wireless and cable networks, but the décor 
remains resolutely old-fashioned. There’s a good restaurant, Weinrot, 
serving international and regional dishes, and if your room rate includes 
the breakfast buffet, you’re in for a treat. Nonsmokers may find the linger-
ing cigar fumes from the Times Bar, just off the lobby, bothersome. 
Children 11 and under stay free in their parents’ rooms.

Dining Out
Berlin offers every kind of international cuisine, but the local culinary 
tradition is fairly basic and very filling. Typical Berlin dishes include 
grilled or pickled herring with onions, fried potatoes, and bacon; pickled 
or roast pork (Schweinefleisch) or pork knuckles (Eisbein) with red cab-
bage and dumplings; meatballs (Buletten) with boiled potatoes; and 
pea soup (Erbsensuppe). A plate with various cold meats is called a 
Schlachteplatte (schlock-tuh-plaht-tuh). Game like venison, duck, and wild 
boar appears seasonally, as does goose; carp and trout often are avail-
able. Fancier restaurants often serve what’s called neue Deutsche Küche 
(New German Cuisine), which uses the old standbys as a starting point 
but dolls them up with unusual ingredients and international touches. 
With a few notable exceptions, I’ve tried to keep my restaurants for 
Berlin in the lower to moderate price range.
 
 Restaurant and cafe bills include the service charge and Mehrwertsteuer 
(MWST; sales tax or value-added tax [VAT]), but rounding out the total bill 
with an extra amount as a gratuity is standard practice. If the bill is 6.30€, 
for example, round the total up to 7€ and add another euro if the service 
was especially good.
 
 Scattered all around town are vendors selling Berlin’s classic fast-food 
snacks: Currywurst (sausage with a glob of “curry” sauce) or fried brat-
wurst. Grabbing a Wurst or eating at the stand-up counters of the fast-food 
snack shops (look for signs that read imbiss or schnell-imbiss) is a good 
way to save time and money.
 
 You can always get an inexpensive meal (soup, sandwiches, and lighter 
dishes) at one of Berlin’s plentiful cafes. And speaking of cafes: Don’t 
forget that in Germany, afternoon Kaffee und Kuchen (coffee and cake) is 
a time-honored tradition. I list some good cafe choices at the end of this 
chapter.
For a few recommended brewpubs, places to enjoy a casual meal with a 
freshly drawn beer, see Chapter 12.

The top restaurants
Art
$–$$ Charlottenburg GERMAN/INTERNATIONAL
A restaurant, bar, and cafe rolled into one, Art is tucked beneath the 
S-Bahn track at Fasanenstrasse. Come to this gay-friendly place for an 
English breakfast (bacon, eggs, and beans). For lunch, try a bowl of potato 
soup with sausage or one of the many salads. Dinner choices include 
homemade pasta, duck with cassis sauce, chicken, fish, and a vegetarian 
Maultaschen (stuffed pasta). The staff is friendly, and outdoor seating is 
available in good weather.

 Die Quadriga
$$$$ Wilmersdorf FRENCH
Die Quadriga, the one-star Michelin restaurant (in Michelin’s guides, one 
star means very good) in the beautiful Brandenburger Hof Hotel, offers a 
truly memorable dining experience, but you need to reserve well in 
advance because the elegant restaurant seats only 28 diners. Everything 
is of the finest quality. Dishes are classically French and seasonally fresh. 
The wonderful wine list includes several wines available by the 
half-bottle.

 La Riva
$$ Mitte ITALIAN/SEAFOOD
One of the prettiest buildings in the restored Nikolaiviertel (Nicholas 
Quarter), just south of Alexanderplatz, is the Ephraim-Palais, a richly orna-
mented 1765 mansion. Part of the building is a museum, while another 
section contains this Italian-influenced restaurant, which sits right next to 
the Spree River. You’ll want a table outside if the weather is fine. And 
you’ll probably want to order fish, because that’s what this place does 
best. Choices include salmon with white-wine sauce; grilled trout; sword-
fish with fresh tomatoes, onions, and basil; and grilled or baked crayfish. 
Pasta is made fresh daily, and the good pizzas are kid-pleasing.

Marjellchen
$$–$$$ Charlottenburg EAST PRUSSIAN
Old East Prussian recipes prepared by the owner’s grandmother inspired 
the dishes that are served at this restaurant, which celebrates its 25th 
anniversary in 2010. For an appetizer, try homemade aspic, smoked 
Pomeranian goose, or fried chicken legs. Other starters include 
Beetenbartsch, a delicious red-beet soup with beef strips and sour cream, 
and a tasty potato soup with shrimp and bacon. Main courses are some-
thing of an adventure: stewed pickled beef with green dumplings and 
stewed cabbage, smoked ham in cream sauce, pork kidneys in sweet-and-
sour cream sauce, or roast of elk with chanterelle mushrooms. You also 
find vegetarian dishes, such as broccoli soufflé.

Mommseneck
$–$$ Mitte GERMAN
This is a newer take on that German institution, the beer-restaurant. It’s 
smack-dab in the middle of a major tourist hub around Potsdamer Platz, 
and it draws lots of international customers. If you’re in the area and want 
a hearty and reliable meal, it’s a good place to know about. Order from the 
self-service spot for quick stand-up meals or sit and enjoy potato or pea 
soup with Wurst, Maultaschen (stuffed pasta), a vegetarian strudel, or 
heartier dishes like beef liver with apple and roast onions, or Eisbein (pork 
knuckles). If one of the 10 beers on tap doesn’t appeal to you, you can 
choose from the 100 bottled offerings. An English menu is also available; 
the service is friendly and efficient.

Noodle
$–$$ Mitte JAPANESE/ASIAN
Located right beside the Spree River, across from the giant Berlin cathe-
dral and beneath the Radisson SAS Hotel (of which it’s now a part), this 
Japanese-inspired noodle house offers a good, reasonably priced selec-
tion of sushi, sashimi, and satays (skewers with meat or fish), plus noodle 
soups, fried noodles, and other specialties. Diners mark what they want 
on the menu (an English menu is available) and hand it to the server. The 
dining room has communal tables, or you can dine outside.

Paris Bar
$$–$$$ Charlottenburg FRENCH/AUSTRIAN/MEDITERRANEAN
Since the end of World War II, the Paris Bar, between Savignyplatz and the 
Memorial Church, has been a Berlin institution. In the past couple of 
years, the restaurant has expanded its classic French bistro menu to 
include more upscale Austrian and Mediterranean-inspired dishes. Main 
courses change often. You may find asparagus with hollandaise sauce, 
ham, and new potatoes; risotto with porcini mushrooms; wiener schnitzel; 
fresh fish; or grilled foie gras.

 Restaurant Borchardt
$$–$$$ Mitte FRENCH/INTERNATIONAL
You can recognize Borchardt, directly across from the Gendarmenmarkt, 
by its blood-colored awning and red-sandstone facade. Inside, the restau-
rant is large, spare, and elegant, with marble, gilding, and a bit of French 
attitude. Menu offerings typically include baked tuna fish with Asian veg-
etables, glazed duck breast, saddle of veal with lemon butter, and suckling 
pig. The best bet for lunch is one of the fixed-price specials.

 Trattoria Toto
$–$$ Charlottenburg ITALIAN
Toto is a good place to sit outside on a warm Berlin afternoon and have a 
tasty, inexpensive lunch. The restaurant’s interior, with wooden tables 
and benches, is nothing fancy. You can get a good plate of spaghetti or a 
nice salad. The minestrone soup is filling. Fresh fish, available every 
Tuesday and Friday (market days), includes grilled salmon with butter 
and lemon and grilled crayfish cooked in olive oil. The menu includes a 
nice selection of Italian wines and aperitifs. The casual atmosphere makes 
Toto a good place to bring kids.

Trattoria da Muntagnola
$–$$ Wilmersdorf ITALIAN
This popular Italian place is casually rustic, with braids of garlic hanging 
from the beamed ceiling. The menu is huge and the cooking is reliable, not 
remarkable; however, the menu has several items that kids generally like. 
Some of the pastas are made on the premises. The lasagna is worth trying. 
All kinds of meat dishes and some good seafood (calamari and scampi 
grilled or cooked with radicchio and rosemary in white-wine sauce) round 
out the menu. The pizzas are a good bet, too, particularly the Pizza della 
Mamma with bacon and Parma ham.

 Treffpunkt Alt-Berliner Kneipe
$–$$ Mitte GERMAN/BERLINER
It’s become almost impossible to find a simple, old-fashioned, inexpensive 
Kneipe (neighborhood pub-restaurant) in Mitte, but this one still exists 
and is a great place to visit for a taste of old Berlin. There is no décor to 
speak of — just tables (some of them shared) and the bar. The food is 
simple, hearty, and delicious. The menu is limited to a few traditional 
Berlin favorites: cabbage rolls, pea and lentil soup, herring with onions, 
pickled eggs, Buletten (meatballs), and a few others. Accompany your 
meal with a glass of beer vom Fass (on tap).

 Vau
$$$$ Mitte INTERNATIONAL
This sleek and unabashedly upscale gastronomic showcase, which opened 
near the Gendarmenmarkt in early 1997, has earned a Michelin star for its 
refined cooking. Vau is a very dress-up kind of place for a superfancy 
lunch or dinner. The menu choices are deftly prepared and can be surpris-
ingly unfussy: venison with artichokes and mushrooms, roast duck breast 
with herbs and carrots, classic wiener schnitzel, and various fish choices. 
In this long, rather narrow room with an arched ceiling, everything is very 
modern and very beautiful.

The Grand Hyatt is the best-designed new hotel in Berlin, and its signature

in town, or sit in the spacious see-and-be-seen dining room and dine on 
impeccably prepared international cuisine. The menu changes often, 
emphasizing the best of the season, but might include wood-smoked foie 
gras with chestnut puree, pumpkin gnocchi with autumn truffle and 
chives, and various duck, beef, and fish dishes.

Zur Letzten Instanz
$–$$ Mitte BERLINER
The former East Berlin now has several trendy new restaurants, but I still 
recommend this place, which happens to be Berlin’s oldest restaurant, 
dating from 1525. The restaurant occupies two floors of a much-restored 
baroque building in the Nikolaiviertel (Nicholas Quarter), and the menu is 
as traditional and atmospheric as can be. Main courses include Old Berlin 
staples like grilled herring, meatballs, and braised lamb knuckles with 
green beans and dumplings. For dessert, try the chocolate-covered pan-
cakes filled with blueberries, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream.

Zur Nolle
$ Mitte GERMAN
A hundred years ago, Zur Nolle was a busy working-class beer hall beneath 
the Friedrichstrasse S-Bahn station. The place closed in 1968 (GDR years) 
but reopened in 1993, as a sign of post-reunification nostalgia for a bit of 
Old Berlin. The menu is unpretentious and the portions hearty. Try the 
jacket potatoes with herring, yogurt, apple, or onion fillings. For old time’s 
sake, I recommend the homemade Buletten (meatballs), which come with 
a variety of sauces, spices, and additions (fried egg, bacon, onions, or 
mushrooms), or the roast bratwurst. Wash everything down with a cold, 
foamy beer.

The best cafes
Berlin is a city filled with cafes. These are places to go for breakfast, a 
cup of coffee and a piece of Kuchen (cake), or a light meal or snack. The 
cafes likewise are bars, so you also can get a beer or a glass of wine. 
Bleibtreustrasse (U-Bahn: Savignyplatz), between Savignyplatz and the 
Ku-Damm, is particularly rich in cafes.
 
✓ Café Aedes, Rosenthaler Strasse 40–41 (see map p. 121; % 030/
285-8278; U-Bahn: Weinmeisterstrasse), is trendy, convivial, and 
very hip. The menu usually has dishes like tortellini with cheese 
sauce, soups, and vegetarian salads. Meals range from 7€ to 9€ 
($9.50–$12). The cafe is open daily from 10 a.m. to midnight.
 
✓ Café Bistro Leysieffer, Kurfürstendamm 218 (see map p. 121; 
% 030/885-7480; U-Bahn: Kurfürstendamm), has a pastry and 
candy shop at street level; upstairs, you find an old-fashioned cafe 
with a balcony overlooking the busy Ku-Damm. This place is a good 
one for having an elegant breakfast or light lunch. Meals range from 
10€ to 16€ ($14–$22). The cafe is open daily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
There’s a new branch at Friedrickstrasse 68 (% 030/2064-9715).
 
✓ Café Silberstein, Oranienburger Strasse 27 (see map p. 121; % 030/
281-2095; S-Bahn: Oranienburger Tor), is one of the best places to 
see the “new” eastern Berlin in all its up-to-the-nanosecond trendi-
ness. The cafe is housed in a long, tall, narrow room with original 
1920s wall paintings and modern furniture. On the menu, you find 
sushi, salads, miso soup with noodles, and an all-day breakfast. A 
meal costs around 7€ ($9.45). The cafe is open Monday through 
Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m., Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. 
to 5 a.m.

N
o other city in Germany can match Berlin for the sheer number of 
attractions and diversions it offers. The city is particularly rich in 
museums and you could build your entire trip around visiting them. But 
Berlin the living city is fascinating wherever you go, filled with historic 
monuments, gut-wrenching memorials, picturesque parks and lakes, 
famous avenues and riverside promenades, and lots of amazing new 
architecture. In fact, Berlin has more new buildings than any other city 
in Europe.
Sightseeing in Berlin
Where do you begin? Do you want to spend all your time in Berlin’s 
fabulous museums? Saunter and shop your way down famous avenues 
like Unter den Linden or the Ku-Damm? See historic buildings like the 
Reichstag? Check out the “new” Berlin at Potsdamer Platz and around 
the Brandenburg Gate? You have to make some decisions because the 
possibilities for sightseeing in Berlin are almost endless. The places 
described in this section are my roster of the most important Berlin 
attractions. For locations, see the “Tiergarten-Area Attractions,” 
“Charlottenburg Attractions,” and “Berlin-Mitte Attractions” maps in this 
chapter. Note: The ages for children’s tickets always are 6 to 14, except 
where otherwise indicated; kids 5 and under generally get in for free, 
and at some museums children 15 and under are admitted free of 
charge.
 
 Remember: Nearly all Berlin museums are closed Mondays throughout 
the year. They’re also closed January 1; December 24, 25, and 31; and the 
Tuesday after Easter.

 ✓ Charlottenburg: Across from Charlottenburg Palace are two museums worth vis-
iting: the Museum Berggruen (with Picassos), and the Bröhan Museum (with Art 
Nouveau and Art Deco furniture). Charlottenburg Palace also has museums, 
which you can visit before or after a guided palace tour, and historic buildings in 
the palace gardens.
 ✓ Tiergarten: In or near the Tiergarten, Berlin’s great city park, you find the 
Bauhaus-Archiv, the Hamburger Bahnhof Museum für Gegenwart (with contem-
porary art), and the Reichstag (House of Parliament). On the eastern edge of the 
Tiergarten, close to Potsdamer Platz, is a group of buildings known as the 
Kulturforum (Culture Forum), home to the Gemäldegalerie (Painting Gallery), the 
adjoining Kunstgewerbe (with applied and decorative arts), and the Neue 
Nationalgalerie (with 20th-century art). The Kulturforum area is within walking 
distance of Potsdamer Platz, the newest area of Berlin, where you find the 
Deutsche Kinemathek für Film und Fernsehen (Museum of German Film and 
Television).
 ✓ Museum Island (Museumsinsel): Museum Island in eastern Berlin has four of the 
city’s oldest and most important museums. They include the Altes Museum, 
which now contains the Ägyptisches Museum (with the famous bust of Nefertiti); 
the Alte Nationalgalerie (with 19th-century art); the Pergamon Museum (with the 
giant Pergamon altar and Middle Eastern antiquities), and the newly reopened 
Bode Museum (with German and Italian sculpture and the Museum of Byzantine 
Art). (In 2009 the island’s fifth museum, the Neues Museum, will reopen and parts 
of the Altes and the Pergamon will close for renovation.) A day ticket to visit all 
four museums on Museum Island costs 12€ ($16). In this same vicinity, you can 
also visit the DDR Museum Berlin; the Deutsches Historisches Museum (German 
History Museum); the Brandenburg Gate; Unter den Linden, a grand boulevard; 
Gendarmenmarkt, a baroque square; The Kennedys museum, and the 
Nikolaiviertel (Nicholas Quarter), a restored historic neighborhood.
 ✓ Dahlem: This leafy suburb, just a few S-Bahn stops from central Berlin, is home 
to the fascinating Ethnologisches Museum (Ethnology Museum) with rich collec-
tions of North American Indian art and artifacts and two other museums con-
cerned with world cultures and art. A day ticket to visit all the Dahlem museums 
costs 6€ ($8.10).

museums described in the next section, “Discovering the top attractions 
from A to Z.” You can purchase the SchauLUST museum pass at any of the 
BERLIN infostores (for addresses, see Chapter 11).
All the state museums operated by Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (www.
smb.spk-berlin.de), including the museums on Museum Island in 
Berlin Mitte, in the Kulturforum, and at Charlottenburg Palace, are open 
free to the public on Thursdays, four hours before closing. Children 16 
and under are always admitted free of charge.

 Alte Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery)
Museum Island, Mitte
The Alte Nationalgalerie, which looks like a Corinthian temple and con-
tains a collection of 19th-century painting and sculpture, including works 
by van Gogh, Manet, Monet, Renoir, and Cézanne, sits behind the Altes 
Museum on Museumsinsel. Give yourself at least an hour just for the high-
lights of this rich collection. A free audio tour in English is available.
See map p. 141. Bodestrasse 1–3. % 030/2090-5801. www.smb.museum. U-/S-Bahn: 
Friedrichstrasse (then a 5-minute walk east on Georgenstrasse to Museum Island). 
Admission: 8€ ($11) adults, 4€ ($5.50) children; free Thurs 2–6 p.m. Open: Tues–Sun 
10 a.m.–6 p.m. (until 10 p.m. Thurs).
Altes Museum (Egyptian Museum and Collection 
of Classical Antiquities)
Museum Island, Mitte
Berlin’s famous collection of Egyptian antiquities was housed in western 
Berlin until 2005, when it was moved to the second floor of the beautifully 
restored Altes Museum on Museum Island in eastern Berlin. The greatest 
treasure of the Egyptian Museum is the justly famous bust of Queen 
Nefertiti, dating from around 1340 b.c. If you’re interested in Egyptian 
antiquities, you’ll find enough here to make you linger for at least an hour. 
A superlative collection of Greek, Roman, and Etruscan classical antiqui-
ties, including sculpture, pottery, and objects of gold and silver, is found 
on the first floor. Two of the highlights here are the unique portraits of 
Caesar and Cleopatra. You’ll need at least two hours to cover the basics; 
the free audio tour will help you navigate. Note: the Egyptian Museum will 
be moved to the newly renovated Neue Museum on Museum Island some 
time in 2009.

Berlin Wall
Mitte
The wall that separated Berlin and Germany from 1961 to 1989 is no more, 
but the fragments that remain are grimly essential pieces of Berlin’s 
tumultuous history. By 1990, most of the concrete barrier that divided this 
city into two political entities had been razed. Only two portions of the 
wall (Mauer in German, pronounced mao-er) are left.
The East Side Gallery is a half-mile-long section on Mühlenstrasse on the 
banks of the Spree River in the former East Berlin. An international group 
of artists painted murals on this section in 1990.
The other remaining section of the wall, known as the Gedenkstätte und 
Dokumentationszentrum Berliner Mauer (Berlin Wall Memorial and 
Documentation Center) lies between Bernauer Strasse and 
Invalidenstrasse. The memorial consists of two walls that include frag-
ments of the original wall (much of which was bulldozed away or carried 
off by souvenir hunters), a chapel of reconciliation, and a documentation 
center with photographs and a history of the wall. The mirrorlike stainless 
steel surfaces of the memorial have slits through which visitors can peer. 
A plaque reads: “In memory of the division of the city from 13 August 1961 
to 9 November 1989.” This place is the only one in Berlin where you still 
can see a complete border area.
See map p. 141. East Side Gallery: Mühlenstrasse along the Spree River; U-/S-Bahn: 
Warschauer Strasse. Gedenkstätte Berliner Mauer: between Bernauer Strasse and 
Invalidenstrasse; U-Bahn: Bernauer Strasse.
Bode-Museum (Sculpture Collection, Museum of Byzantine Art)
Museumsinsel, Mitte
The newly modernized Bode-Museum anchoring the north end of Museum 
Island reopened its doors in October 2006. Here you’ll find a rich collec-
tion of German, French, Dutch, and Italian sculpture (marble, wood, 
bronze) from the Gothic to the neoclassical periods. The museum also 
contains galleries with late-antique and Byzantine works and a major coin 
collection. The free audio guide will help you navigate your way through 
the galleries; give yourself at least a full hour just to graze the highlights.
See map p. 141. Monbijoubrücke. % 030/266-3666. www.smb.museum. S-Bahn: 
Hackescher Markt (then a 5-minute walk west along the S-Bahn tracks to the 
Monbijou bridge which leads to the museum). Admission: 8€ ($11) adults, 4€ ($5.40) 
children; free Thurs 6–10 p.m. Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (until 10 p.m. Thurs).
Brandenburger Tor (Brandenburg Gate)
Mitte
Berlin’s most famous and potent symbol, the Branenburg Gate is a neo-
classical triumphal arch completed in 1791 and crowned by the famous 
Quadriga, a four-horse copper chariot drawn by the goddess Victoria. 
The gate has been used as a symbolic gathering place during key moments 
in Germany’s history. When the wall came down, hundreds of thousands

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
138
of East Germans walked freely through the gate into West Berlin for the 
first time since 1961. In the Room of Silence (open daily 11 a.m.–6 p.m.), 
built into one of the guardhouses, visitors still gather to meditate and 
reflect on Germany’s past. (There’s also a Berlin infostore here for tourist 
information.) Berlin’s largest Holocaust memorial, the Memorial to the 
Murdered Jews of Europe, lies just to the south of the Gate; across from 
it, in Tiergarten park, is the Gay Holocaust Victim Memorial.
See map p. 141. Pariser Platz. U-/S-Bahn: Unter den Linden (you see the gate to the 
west). Admission: Free.
 
 Gemäldegalerie (Painting Gallery)
Kulturforum, Tiergarten
The Gemäldegalerie houses Berlin’s greatest collection of European paint-
ing, with an emphasis on medieval German and Dutch art and 16th-century 
Italian and 17th-century Dutch painting. Several Italian masterpieces are 
on display, including Raphael’s Virgin and Child with the Infant St. John and 
Bronzino’s Portrait of Ugolino Martelli. The gallery contains one of the 
world’s largest collections of Rembrandts. This is a huge collection, and 
to see it in any depth you should give yourself at least two hours.
See map p. 137. Matthäiskirchplatz. % 030/2090-5555. www.smb.museum. U-/
S-Bahn: Potsdamer Platz (then a 5-minute walk west on Potsdamer Strasse and 
Margaretenstrasse). Admission: 8€ ($11) adults, 4€ ($5.40) children; free Thurs 6–10 
p.m. Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (until 10 p.m. Thurs).
 
 Gendarmenmarkt
Mitte
Twin churches inspired by Rome’s Piazza del Popolo flank this monumen-
tally graceful baroque square — one of the most beautiful architectural 
ensembles in Berlin. Looking at the square today, it’s hard to imagine that by 
the end of World War II, the Gendarmenmarkt had been reduced to a pile of 
smoldering rubble and remained in ruins until 1977, when East Berlin finally 
began this reconstruction. The square was named for the Gens d’Armes regi-
ment, which had its guardhouse and stables here from 1738 to 1782.
The centerpiece of the square is Friedrich Schinkel’s beautiful neoclassi-
cal Schauspielhaus (Theater), now also called the Konzerthaus (Concert 
House), completed in 1821. (For concert information, see “Raising the cur-
tain on performing arts and music,” later in this chapter.) On the north 
side of the square is the Französicher Dom (French Cathedral; % 030/802-
8146; open Tues–Sun noon to 5 p.m.; half-hour organ concerts Tues and 
Fri at 12:30 p.m.), built for the influx of French Huguenots (Protestants) 
who settled in Berlin after being forced to flee Catholic France in 1685. 
Facing this church like a mirror image on the south side is the Deutscher 
Dom (German Cathedral; % 030/2273-0431; open Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–6 
p.m.). Surrounding the square is a bevy of chic new restaurants.
See map p. 141. U-Bahn: Französische Strasse (then a 2-minute walk east on 
Taubenstrasse).

Hamburger Bahnhof Museum für Gegenwart 
(Museum of Contemporary Art)
Tiergarten
This showcase of contemporary art opened in 1996 in the 19th-century 
Hamburger Bahnhof, the oldest train station in Berlin. The building still 
retains traces of its former use, including the high roof designed for steam 
engines. The modern art on display dates from the second half of the 20th 
century and includes everything from Andy Warhol’s now legendary Mao 
to an audiovisual Joseph Beuys archive. You also find a major collection 
of works by Cy Twombly, Robert Rauschenberg, and Roy Lichtenstein 
together with changing exhibitions. You can see everything in about an hour.
See map p. 137. Invalidenstrasse 50–51. % 030/397-83439. www.hamburger
bahnhof.de. S-Bahn: Hauptbahnhof (then a 3-minute walk northeast on 
Invalidenstrasse). Admission: 8€ ($11) adults, 4€ ($5.40) children; free Thurs 2–6 p.m. 
Open: Tues–Fri and Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Sat 11 a.m.–8 p.m.
 
 Jüdisches Museum (Jewish Museum)
Kreuzberg
One of Berlin’s newer and most interesting museums is located in 
Kreuzberg, just south of Berlin-Mitte. Designed by American architect 
Daniel Libeskind, the building is shaped like a stretched-out Star of David 
and houses Europe’s largest Jewish museum. Items on display include 
ceremonial objects, portraits of prominent Jewish figures, historical 
objects, works of Jewish artists, documents, photos, and memorabilia. 
You follow a chronological pathway occasionally interrupted by deliber-
ately disorienting memorial spaces. This museum has plenty to see. I rec-
ommend that you give yourself at least two hours and rent an audio-guide 
(2€/$2.70).
See map p. 141. Lindenstrasse 9–14. % 030/2599-3300. www.juedisches-
museum-berlin.de. U-Bahn: Hallesches Tor (then a 5-minute walk east on 
Gitschiner Strasse and north on Lindenstrasse). Admission: 5€ ($6.75) adults, 2.50€ 
($3.40) children and students, 10€ ($14) family ticket (2 adults, 2 children). Open: Daily 
10 a.m.–8 p.m. (until 10 p.m. Mon). Closed on Jewish holy days.
Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche (Emperor William 
Memorial Church)
Charlottenburg
One of Berlin’s most famous landmarks, the Gedächtniskirche (Memorial 
Church) is a ponderous neo-Romanesque structure from the late 19th cen-
tury. Built to commemorate the 1871 establishment of the German Empire, 
the church later was blasted by a bomb in World War II, and the ruined 
shell was preserved as a symbol of the ravages of war. You probably won’t 
want to spend more than a few minutes inside. The small modern church 
beside the Gedächtniskirche is an octagonal hall designed by Egon

Kurfürstendamm
Tiergarten
From the start of the 20th century until World War II, the famous avenue 
known as Ku-Damm was the most brilliant, lively, and elegant street in the 
western part of Berlin, filled with legendary cafes and renowned for its 
nightlife. Then, after the war and during the years when East Berlin was 
walled off from West Berlin, the Ku-Damm hogged all the city’s glamour 
because dreary East Berlin had nothing to rival it. Today the Ku-Damm is 
going through a rebuilding phase to spruce itself up and lure people back 
from Friedrichstrasse and Unter den Linden in eastern Berlin. This busy 
commercial artery began as nothing more than a humble log road, built in 
1542 for the Kurfürsten (Prince-Electors) to reach their hunting lodge in the 
Grünewald more easily. The street still is a wonderful place to shop, stroll, 
sit, and people-watch.
See map p. 137. U-Bahn: Kurfürstendamm (you are on the Ku-Damm when you exit 
the station).
Mauermuseum Haus am Checkpoint Charlie (Wall Museum at 
Checkpoint Charlie)
Kreuzberg
If you’re interested in the history of the Berlin Wall, this small museum in 
Kreuzberg is well worth an hour of your time. Located near what once was 
Checkpoint Charlie, the most frequently used traffic crossing into 
Communist East Berlin, the museum documents the wall’s history from its 
construction in 1961 to its fall in 1989 to 1990. The photographs, newspa-
per clippings, and attempted escape devices (chairlifts, false passports,

Neue Nationalgalerie (New National Gallery)
Kulturforum, Tiergarten
The only “old” structure in the aggressively modern Kulturforum complex, 
the New National Gallery was designed in 1968 by famed German architect 
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The museum, an enormous expanse of glass

windows and simple symmetry, contains a small but impressive collection 
of international 20th-century painting and sculpture, including works by 
de Chirico, Dalí, Miró, Mark Rothko, and Frank Stella. Of special interest 
are the paintings by early- to mid-20th-century German artists Max 
Beckmann, Max Ernst, and Otto Dix, and two bitter and brilliant oils by 
George Grosz that capture the decadent despair of the Weimar years in 
the 1920s. The gallery also is used for special traveling exhibitions.

Neues Museum (New Museum)
Museum Island, Mitte
There’s nothing new about this neoclassical building, built between 1843 
and 1855, except that it has undergone a complete renovation/rebuilding 
and is scheduled to open in October 2009 after being closed for over 60 
years. Much of it was destroyed in World War II, but portions of its interior 
survived and have been incorporated into the new design. The museum 
was still closed as of press time, but I’m putting it in the guide because, 
when it opens, it will contain the Egyptian Museum and the Museum for 
Pre- and Early History, as it did before the war.

 Pergamon Museum
Museum Island, Mitte
Of all the museums on Museum Island, the renowned Pergamon Museum 
is the one must-see (along with the bust of Egyptian Queen Nerfertiti in 
the Altes Museum). And what you must see is the Pergamon Altar, con-
sidered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and still holding 
its own today. Part of the enormous Temple of Zeus and Athena, dating 
from 180 to 160 b.c., the altar was discovered in 1876 in western Turkey. 
Another showpiece is the ornate two-storied Market Gate of Miletus, a 
Roman building facade from the time of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (around 
a.d. 165). The Near East Museum in the museum’s south wing contains 
one of the largest collections anywhere of antiquities from ancient 
Babylonia, Persia, and Assyria.
The entire museum, one of the most popular in the city, will undergo an 
internal and external face-lift starting in 2009. When you see its grim 
facade, you’ll understand why. The restorations will be done gallery by 
gallery and parts of the museum will remain open while work is in 
progress.

Potsdamer Platz
Tiergarten
Before World War II, Potsdamer Platz was the busiest spot in Berlin. In 
1961, the square was cut off from the western sector by the wall and 
became an ugly strip of mined no-man’s-land. After reunification, corpora-
tions like Sony and Mercedes-Benz rushed in and bought the entire area. 
Today, Potsdamer Platz is a brand-new, super-modern showcase of cor-
porate glitz, glamorous hotels, government offices, upscale housing, and 
entertainment. To experience the area, stroll along Alte Potsdamer 
Strasse, lined with cafes and restaurants, and have a look in the Potsdamer 
Platz Arcades, where some 140 stores and cafes invite you to shop 
(American mall style) and relax. The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz 
(% 030/2094-5400) has two movie theaters and a viewing area from 
which you can look out over the Philharmonie, the Kulturforum, and the 
Tiergarten. Around newly created Marlene-Dietrich-Platz, you find the 
Stella Musical-Theater, the Grand Hyatt Hotel (see Chapter 22), the Berlin 
Casino, and the Cine-Max cinema center.

Museumsinsel (Museum Island): 
Art by decree
Five museums on an island in the River Spree form the oldest museum complex in 
Berlin and are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. (UNESCO is the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.) The buildings, some dating back to 
the early and mid 19th century, were constructed after Frederick William III issued a 
decree stipulating that the privately owned artwork of the royal family needed to be 
made accessible to the public. The museums were the main attractions in Communist 
East Berlin. After reunification, a complicated process of restoring the buildings and 
reuniting various collections from the East and West began. The domed neo-baroque 
Bode Museum at the far northern end of the island and the Altes Museum with its 
Egyptian and classical antiquities collections reopened in 2005 and 2006, respectively, 
after extensive interior modernization. The Alte Nationalgalerie was the first to 
reopen its doors after undergoing post-reunification refurbishment. Parts of the mas-
sive Pergamon Museum, one of the most popular museums in Berlin, will close in 2009 
for several years while it, too, gets a much-needed makeover; its prize possession, the 
Pergamon Altar, will probably remain on view during some of the renovation period. 
When the Neues Museum reopens in 2009, it will house the Egyptian Museum (cur-
rently in the Altes Museum) and the Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte (Museum 
of Pre- and Early History), currently housed in Charlottenburg.

Reichstag (House of Parliament)
Tiergarten
The Reichstag is the seat of the reunified German Parliament. Built in a 
pompous high-Renaissance style between 1884 and 1894, the building was 
partially destroyed by a fire in 1933 that probably was set by the Nazis, 
who, blaming the fire on the Communists, used the incident as an oppor-
tunity to seize power. Allied bombs destroyed part of the Reichstag in 
World War II. Today, a new glass dome designed by British architect Sir 
Norman Foster crowns the building. After a security check, you take an 
elevator up to the dome, where a sweeping vista of Berlin opens out 
before you. The dome also has an outdoor observation area and a rooftop 
restaurant (reservations % 030/226-2990). I recommend that you arrive 
as early as possible; otherwise, you may have to stand in line for up to two 
hours before getting in.

S-Bahn: Friedrichstrasse (then a 5-minute walk west along the Reichstagufer, the 
street that follows the river). Admission: Free. Open: Dome daily 8 a.m.–10 p.m.
 
 Schloss Charlottenburg (Charlottenburg Palace)
Charlottenburg
The oldest section of this lovely, yellow baroque palace was built in 1695 
as a breezy summer abode for Sophie Charlotte, the wife of Friedrich I. Its 
present form dates from 1790. Much of the palace was destroyed in World 
War II and painstakingly reconstructed.
You can see the palace only on a tour, and to take that tour you have to 
don huge felt slippers (so you’re effectively polishing the wood floors as 
you slide around after the guide). The tour is given only in German (you 
can buy an English-language guidebook at the ticket counter) and includes 
the historical rooms, the living quarters of Friedrich I and Sophie 
Charlotte, the eye-catching porcelain room, and the royal chapel. With a 
combined ticket, you can, on your own, additionally visit the Galerie der 
Romantik, with its fine collection of paintings from the neoclassical, 
Romantic, and Biedermeier periods, and the beautifully landscaped 
Schlossgarten (Palace Gardens). In the Schlossgarten, you find the charm-
ing Schinkel Pavilion, an Italianate summer house designed by Karl 
Friedrich Schinkel, the leading architect of the day, in 1825. At the far end 
of the Schlossgarten, close to the Spree River, is the Belvedere. This former 
royal tea house contains exquisite Berlin porcelain, much of it from the 
1700s. To see the palace and museums, you need at least four to five hours. 
The Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte (Museum of Prehistory and 
Early History), in the Langhansbau wing, displays the famous Schliemann 
collection of antiquities from Troy. You must pay a separate admission of 
3€ ($4.05) adults, 1.50€ ($2) children for this museum, which is open 
Tuesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The museum is scheduled to 
be moved back to its original home in the Neues Museum on Museum Island 
in eastern Berlin in October 2009 (see listing for Neues Museum earlier in 
this section).

Tiergarten
Tiergarten
The popular Tiergarten (literally, “Animal Garden”) covers almost 2.5 sq. 
km (1 sq. mile) and is the most popular green space in central Berlin. 
(Tiergarten also is the name of Berlin’s smallest neighborhood.) With its 
lawns, canals, leafy trees, and more than 23km (14 miles) of meandering 
paths, the Tiergarten park is a great place to stroll and relax. It was origi-
nally laid out by Peter Josef Lenné, one of the great landscape architects 
of the early 19th century, as a private park for the electors of Prussia. The 
park was devastated during and just after World War II, when desperate 
citizens chopped down the trees for fuel. Beginning in 1955, trees were 
replanted and walkways, ponds, and flower beds restored to their original 
patterns. The Berlin Zoo, which is described in the “Zoologischer Garten 
Berlin & Aquarium (Berlin Zoo-Aquarium)” listing later in this chapter, 
occupies the park’s southwestern corner. In the northwestern corner, you 
find the Hansaviertel (Hansa Quarter), a residential area where architects 
were invited to build projects in the 1950s, and pretty Schloss Bellevue 
(Palace Bellevue; S-Bahn: Bellevue), the residence of Germany’s president. 
If you just want to stroll, give yourself a couple of hours.
The Siegessäule (Victory Column), a golden goddess of victory perched 
high atop a red-granite pedestal, is the most famous of the Tiergarten’s 
many monuments. The column stands in the center of the Strasse des 17 
Juni, a wide boulevard that bisects the Tiergarten and is the western 
extension of Unter den Linden. The column’s 48m-high (157-ft.) observa-
tion platform, reached by climbing up a 290-step spiral staircase, is open 
April through October daily from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., November through 
March daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is 2.20€ ($3) adults, 1.50€ 
($2) children 11 and under.

Unter den Linden
Mitte
Laid out in 1647 and extending a bit more than a kilometer (3⁄4 mile) east 
from the Brandenburg Gate, Unter den Linden is one of Berlin’s most 
famous and historically significant streets. The name, which means “under 

 Chapter 12: Exploring Berlin 147
the lindens,” came from the linden trees that were originally planted along 
the street. This boulevard is the oldest and most royal in central Berlin, 
with several monumental buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries.
Friedrich Schinkel’s 1818 Neue Wache (New Watch) served as headquarters 
for the King’s Guard and now contains the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and 
the Tomb of the Unknown Resistance Fighter. The Zeughaus (Armory), 
Berlin’s largest baroque building and the first major building to be constructed 
on Unter den Linden (in 1706), houses the Deutsches Museum (see “Finding 
more cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter). The Staatsoper Unter 
den Linden, the oldest of Berlin’s three opera houses, is also located here. 
The giant Berliner Dom (Berlin Cathedral; Lustgarten; open daily 9 a.m.–8 
p.m.) squats at the end of Unter den Linden. Following reunification, the his-
torically significant buildings along Unter den Linden were spruced up and the 
avenue filled up with souvenir shops, luxury car showrooms, and cafes.
See map p. 141. U-/S-Bahn: Unter den Linden (you’re on the avenue as you exit the 
station).
 Zoologischer Garten Berlin & Aquarium (Berlin Zoo-Aquarium)
Tiergarten
Founded in 1844, Germany’s oldest and Europe’s largest zoo occupies almost 
the entire southwest corner of the Tiergarten. More than 13,000 animals live 
here, many of them in open habitats. The most popular residents are the 
giant pandas and Knut, the polar bear who was rejected by his mother after 
birth in 2007 and raised by zoo staff. (Knut may be moved to another zoo in 
2009.) The zoo also has a modern aviary, with more than 550 species of 
birds. The aquarium is home to more than 9,000 fish, reptiles, amphibians, 
insects, and other creatures. The hippoquarium is a new attraction. With 
kids in tow, you can easily spend half a day in the zoo and aquarium.
The fate of Erich’s lamp shop
As you’re wandering around Berlin-Mitte, you might wonder what used to be in that 
big empty space just south of Museum Island. Until November 2008, it was the site of 
the Palast der Republik (Palace of the Republic), a huge and hideous building con-
structed between 1973 and 1976 by the East German government to serve as a com-
munist congress hall. Nicknamed “Erich’s Lamp Shop” for the hundreds of glittering 
glass chandeliers that lit up Communist chief Erich Honecker and his cronies, the 
Palast der Republik was built on the site of an earlier baroque palace, the Stadtschloss, 
which served as the seat of the Prussian kings until Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated in 
1918. Now plans are underway and controversy is swirling as the German government 
finalizes plans to rebuild the former royal palace. This time around, the building will 
house some of Berlin’s antiquities as well as parts of Humboldt University and the city 
library. Construction is expected to begin in 2010 and be completed by 2014.

Finding more cool things to see and do
Berlin is full of museums, gardens, and many other places to visit — you 
won’t be lacking things to do. Here are additional places that you may 
find of interest:
 
✓ The Bauhaus–Archiv Museum für Gestaltung (Bauhaus Design 
Museum), Klingelhöferstrasse 14 (% 030/254-0020; www.bauhaus.
de; U-Bahn: Nollendorfplatz), is dedicated to the Bauhaus school, 
which sought to combine art, design, and technology. The Bauhaus 
was founded in 1919 at Weimar, moved to Dessau, and finally set-
tled in Berlin, before the Nazis forced the school to disband in 
1933. The museum, completed in 1979, is one of the last works of 
the great Berlin-born architect Walter Gropius. English-language 
texts and audio-guides describing the exhibits are available. You 
need at least an hour to peruse the exhibits. The museum, near the 
Tiergarten, is open Wednesday through Monday from 10 a.m. to 
5 p.m. Admission is 7€ ($9.45) adults, 4€ ($5.40) children 11 and 
under; admission is 1€/$1.35 less Wed–Fri. See map p. 137.
 
✓ Berlin’s Botanischer Garten (Botanical Garden), Königin-Luise-
Strasse 6–8 (% 030/8385-0100; www.botanischer-garten-
berlin.de; S-Bahn: Botanischer Garten; U-Bahn: Dahlem–Dorf), 
located near the Dahlem Museums on the outskirts of Berlin, con-
tains vast collections of European and exotic plants. The Palm 
House is one of the largest in the world. You also find an extensive 
arboretum and several special collections, including a garden for 
blind visitors and another with water plants. A small botanical 
museum, of more interest to dedicated gardeners than the general 
public, is also on the premises. Give yourself an hour or so to stroll 
through the garden itself. Admission is 5€ ($6.75) adults, 2.50€ 
($3.40) children. The garden is open daily from 9 a.m. to dusk. 
See map p. 137.
 
✓ The Bröhan Museum, Schlossstrasse 1A (% 030/3269-0600; www.
broehan-museum.de; U-Bahn: Sophie-Charlotte-Platz), houses one 
of the world’s finest collections of Jugendstil (Art Nouveau), Art 
Deco and “Functionalist” furniture, painting, sculpture, glass, silver-
ware, and crafts, all from 1889 to 1939. A must-see is the Suite 
Emile-Jacques Ruhlman, a completely decorated set of rooms 
from a luxurious private residence of the 1920s and 1930s. The 
museum is small enough that you can see everything in an hour. 
Admission is 5€ ($6.75); free for children 12 and under; free on first 

 Chapter 12: Exploring Berlin 149
Wednesday of every month. Hours are Tuesday through Sunday 10 
a.m. to 6 p.m. See map p. 139.
 
✓ The DDR Museum, Karl-Liebknecht-Strasse 1 (% 030/847-123-731; 
www.ddr-museum.de; S-Bahn: Hackescher Markt), Berlin’s newest 
new museum, offers an interesting, hands-on experience of every-
day life in the Communist DDR (Deutsche Democratische Republik, 
called the GDR, or German Democratic Republic, in English) before 
the fall of the wall in 1989. Visitors can sit in a Trabi, the DDR’s ver-
sion of a car, explore a typical DDR living room, open doors, and 
rummage through drawers and closets. There’s a kind of heartfelt, 
nostalgic charm to many of the exhibits. The museum, located on 
the Spreepromenade directly opposite the Berlin Cathedral, is open 
daily from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. (until 10 p.m. Sat). Admission is 5.50€ 
($7.40). See map p. 141.
 
 
✓ The Deutsche Kinemathek Museum für Film und Fernsehen 
(German Film and Television Museum), Sony Center in 
Potsdamerstrasse 2 (% 030/300-9030; www.filmmuseum-berlin.
de; U-/S-Bahn: Potsdamer Platz), appeals to anyone who has an 
interest in German film or film in general. The entire history of 
German cinema is documented in rare film clips from the silent era 
up to the present. One wing is devoted to the legendary Marlene 
Dietrich, a native Berliner who catapulted to international fame in 
1930 in Josef von Sternberg’s Der Blaue Engel (The Blue Angel) and 
went on to become Germany’s only major star in Hollywood. The 
fascinating Marlene memorabilia includes photos, costumes, props, 
letters, and documents. You need at least an hour here. Admission 
is 6€ ($8) adults, 3€ ($4) students. The museum is open Tuesday 
through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 8 p.m. Thurs). See 
map p. 137.
 
✓ The Deutsches Historisches Museum (German History Museum), 
Unter den Linden 2 (% 030/203040; www.dhm.de; S-Bahn: 
Hackescher Markt), is a new museum housed in the old Zeughaus 
(Armory). Like many German museums, this one is exhaustive and 
can be exhausting because it attempts to cover 2,000 years of 
German history in pictures and documents. The rooms are set up 
chronologically. I recommend that you visit the first-floor galleries 
devoted to World War II; it’s a sobering experience. The museum 
is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission is 5€ ($6.75). See 
map p. 141.
 
✓ The leafy suburb of Dahlem is home to the Museum of European 
Cultures and the Museum of Asian Art, but it’s the Ethnologisches 
Museum (Ethnological Museum), Arnimallee 27 (% 030/8301-438; 
www.smb.museum; S-Bahn: Dahlem-Dorf), that I recommend visit-
ing. Objects from African, Asian, and Australian cultures are on 
view in this attractive museum, but it’s the collection of Native 
American artifacts that is truly outstanding. The museum is open 
Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday and 
Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission is 3€ ($4.05).

✓ The Fernsehturm am Alexanderplatz (Television Tower), 
Panoramastrasse 1a, Alexanderplatz (% 030/242-3333; www.
berlinerfernsehturm.de; U-/S-Bahn: Alexanderplatz), is a 
weird-looking television tower built by the Communists back in the 
1960s. Berliners call it “the speared onion” because of its shape. An 
elevator whisks you up to the top for a stunning panorama. There’s 
a revolving restaurant (the Telecafe) up there, too. The tower is 
open daily from 9 a.m. to midnight (from 10 a.m. Nov–Feb). The ele-
vator to the top costs 9.50€ ($13) adults, 4.50€ ($6.10) children 15 
and under. See map p. 141.
 
✓ The Grünewald (S-Bahn: Grünewald), a 39-sq.-km (15-sq.-mile) forest 
that begins just beyond the western edge of the Kurfürstendamm, 
is Berlin’s largest uninterrupted wooded area. From Heerstrasse, 
the forest stretches some 10km (6 miles) south to the popular 
Wannsee lake. Havelchausee, the forest’s western border, winds 
past several picturesque bays and beaches along the Havel River, 
while the eastern border is roughly marked off by four lakes: 
Schlachtensee, Krumme Lanke, Grünewaldsee, and Schildhorn. 
Loaded with wooded paths and sandy beaches, the Grünewald 
(Green Forest) is a good place to get away from the urban jungle, 
although on weekends you have plenty of company.
 
✓ The Käthe-Kollwitz-Museum, Fasanenstrasse 24 (% 030/882-5210; 
www.kaethe-kollwitz.de; U-Bahn: Uhlandstrasse), is devoted 
to the powerful works of Berlin-born artist Käthe Kollwitz (1867–
1945). The first woman ever elected to the Prussian Academy of the 
Arts, Kollwitz resigned her position in 1933 to protest Hitler’s rise 
to power. The Nazis later banned her works. Many of Kollwitz’s 
works express the sorrow, loss, and deprivations of wartime and 
have a stark, grieving quality. The lower floors of the museum dis-
play woodcuts and lithographs; the upper floors contain sculp-
tures. Admission is 5€ ($6.75) adults, 3€ ($4.05) children and 
students. The museum is open Wednesday through Monday from 
11 a.m. to 6 p.m. See map p. 137.
 
✓ Kunstgewerbemuseum (Arts and Crafts Museum), Matthäiskirchplatz, 
Kulturforum (% 030/2090-5555; www.smb.museum; U-/S-Bahn: 
Mendelssohn–Bartholdy–Park), adjoining the Gemäldegalerie 
(Painting Gallery, see “Discovering the top attractions from A to Z,” 
earlier in this chapter), displays applied arts and crafts from the 
Middle Ages through the present day. The Guelph Treasure, its 
most dazzling exhibit, is a collection of medieval church articles in 
gold and silver. The basement rooms display contemporary design 
from the German Bauhaus school to American Charles Eames and 
the Memphis design group. Admission is 8€ ($11) adults, 4€ ($5.40) 
children; your ticket for the Gemäldegalerie will get you in. The 
museum is open Tuesday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., 
Saturday and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. A nice cafeteria is open from 
opening time to 4:30 p.m. See map p. 137.

 Chapter 12: Exploring Berlin 151
 
✓ Madame Tussauds, Unter den Linden 74 (% 030/4000-4610; 
S-Bahn: Unter den Linden), a fairly new Berlin attraction, has been 
attracting more visitors since its notorious wax figure of Adolf 
Hitler had its head chopped off and had to be moved to a safer 
location. I can’t recommend this place because, in all honesty, I 
absolutely hate looking at inert wax figures of celebrities. Here 
you’ll see the usual dolled-up dummies, some famous Germans 
among them (Marlene Dietrich, Albert Einstein, Steffi Graf) but 
most from Hollywood. And Hitler, of course, now protected behind 
glass. Admission is an outrageous 19€ ($25) adults, 17€ ($23) chil-
dren. Madame Tussauds is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. See 
map p. 141.
 
✓ Museum Berggruen, Schlossstrasse 1 (% 030/3269-5819; U-Bahn: 
Sophie-Charlotte-Platz), a small museum located across from 
Charlottenburg Palace, showcases several important paintings by 
Picasso and works by Klee, Matisse, Braque, and Giacometti. You 
can see the collection in about half an hour. Admission is 8€ ($11) 
adults, 4€ ($5.40) students and children; this ticket is good for all 
the national museums in Charlottenburg, including Charlottenburg 
Palace. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. See map p. 139. 
 
✓ Nikolaiviertel (Nicholas Quarter; U-Bahn: Klosterstrasse), not far 
from the Gendarmenmarkt in Berlin Mitte, is a historic riverside 
quarter restored to resemble its medieval and baroque heyday 
(with a few modern design touches). Reconstructed palaces, period 
taverns, and old churches make this quarter ideal for a leisurely 
and picturesque ramble along the Spree River, down narrow streets 
illuminated by gas lanterns. Named for Berlin’s oldest church, the 
Nikolaikirche (Church of St. Nicholas; Nikolaikirchplatz; % 030/
2472-4529; open Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m.), the quarter was the last 
major reconstruction project of the German Democratic Party that 
ruled former East Germany; the church was restored in time for the 
city’s 750th anniversary in 1987. See map p. 141.
 
✓ The Kennedys, Pariser Platz 4a (% 030/2065-3570; www.the
kennedys.de; S-Bahn: Unter den Linden), located across from the 
Brandenburg Gate, is a must for anyone with an interest in JFK, 
Jackie, Robert, or the Kennedy family in general. The museum fea-
tures a fascinating collection of Kennedy photographs, film clips, 
and memorabilia, including JFK’s briefcase and one of Jackie’s 
famous pillbox hats. The photos span JFK’s life and entire political 
career and are a reminder of the enduring mystique of the Kennedy 
clan. It was in Berlin, at the height of the Cold War, that Kennedy 
gave his famous “Ich bin ein Berliner” (I am a Berliner) speech, a 
moment captured here on film. Admission is 7€ ($9.45) adults, 
3.50€ ($4.70) students and children. The museum is open daily 
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. See map p. 141.

Gay and lesbian Berlin
Berlin has a century-old gay and lesbian history, and the city remains a mecca for 
international gay and lesbian travelers. The city’s gay information center is Mann-o-
Meter, Bülowstrasse 106 (% 030/216-8008; www.mann-o-meter.de; U-Bahn: 
Nollendorfplatz). The center is open Monday through Friday from 5 to 10 p.m. and 
Saturday and Sunday from 4 to 10 p.m. Another good source for information is 
Eisenherz Buchladen, Lietzenburger Strasse 9a (% 030/313-9936; www.prinz-
eisenherz.com; S-Bahn: Wittenbergplatz), one of the world’s oldest and largest 
gay and lesbian bookstores. The store, open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. 
to 8 p.m., stocks a vast array of new and rare fiction, nonfiction, art books, and maga-
zines in German, English, and other languages. The staff is knowledgeable and 
helpful.
Berlin is the only city in the world with a gay museum. The Schwules Museum (Gay 
Museum), Mehringdamm 61 (% 030/6959-9050; www.schwulesmuseum.de; 
U-Bahn: Mehringdamm), is a large gallery-like space in Kreuzberg with changing 
exhibitions on gay life in Germany and around the world. The museum is open 
Wednesday through Monday from 2 to 6 p.m. (until 5 p.m. Sat). Admission is 5€ ($6.75).
Traditionally, lesbian and gay life has centered around Nollendorfplatz (U-Bahn: 
Nollendorfplatz), the so-called Pink (or Gay) Village. A memorial plaque mounted on 
the outside south wall of the Nollendorfplatz subway station, in the heart of what has 
been for decades the gay heart of Berlin, reads, “Totgeschlagen-Totgeschiegen. Den 
Homosexuellen Opfern des National Socialismus” (Killed and Forgotten. The 
Homosexual Victims of National Socialism). The plaque serves as a poignant reminder 
that the Nazis exterminated thousands of homosexuals in addition to millions of Jews, 
Gypsies, and other political victims. Until recently, it was the only gay memorial in 
Berlin. In 2008, Berlin’s openly gay mayor and the German Minister of Culture unveiled 
the Gay Holocaust Victims Memorial, a 600,000€ ($870,000) memorial located in the 
Tiergarten park between Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate, across from the 
Memorial for the Murdered Jews of Europe. The simple concrete structure has a 
window with a continuous film loop showing two men kissing — a reminder, accord-
ing to the memorial text, that even a simple show of affection between men could lead 
to imprisonment and death in Nazi Germany.
In mid-June, Nollendorfplatz is the site of the Lesbisch-Schwules Stadtfest (Lesbian-
Gay Street Fair). The Christopher Street Day parade is an even larger citywide gay 
event that takes place the last week in June; up to 500,000 people congregate for this 
Gay Pride festival. Love Parade/Love Week in July attracts thousands to a huge gay 
party scene.
The gay scene is more international in the area around Nollendorfplatz, which has 
had gay bars since the 1920s. Kreuzberg is another gay-friendly borough with a big 
selection of bars. In the eastern part of the city, Prenzlauer Berg has become the new 
gay area. For my recommended gay and lesbian nightspots, see “Checking out the 
dance clubs and bars,” later in this chapter. More information on gay life in Berlin is 
available at www.berlin.gay-web.de. (For more information, see Chapter 9.)

 Chapter 12: Exploring Berlin 153
 
✓ The Story of Berlin, Ku’damm-Karree, Kurfürstendamm 207–208 
(% 030/8872-0100; www.story-of-berlin.de; U-Bahn: 
Uhlandstrasse), is an enjoyable multimedia museum that uses 
films, photos, sounds, and colorful displays to tell about eight cen-
turies of life in Berlin. Beginning with the city’s founding in 1237, 
the themed exhibits chronicle all the major historical events — 
including the reign of Frederick the Great, the Industrial Revolution, 
the Golden 1920s, and World War II and its aftermath — divided 
Berlin during the Cold War, and the fall of the wall. At the end of 
the tour, a guide takes you down to visit an underground nuclear 
bomb shelter built in the 1970s. Allow at least two hours to see 
everything. This attraction is a good overall introduction to Berlin 
and something that teens may enjoy. Admission is 9.80€ ($13) 
adults, 8€ ($11) students, 3.50€ ($4.70) children, and 21€ ($28) fami-
lies (2 adults, 2 children). The museum is open daily from 10 a.m. 
to 8 p.m. (last admission 6 p.m.).
 
✓ Topographie des Terrors (Topography of Terror), Niederkirchner-
strasse 8 (% 030/2548-6703; www.topographie.de; U-/S-Bahn: 
Potsdamer Platz), located in what once was part of the Nazi SS and 
Gestapo headquarters, is an open-air exhibit detailing how the 
Nazis came to power and the crimes against humanity they com-
mitted under the leadership of der Führer, Adolf Hitler. The exhibit 
is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 8 p.m. May–Sept). 
Admission is free. See map p. 137.
Seeing Berlin by Guided Tour
Taking a Stadtrundfahrt (guided sightseeing tour) can help you to see 
parts of this huge city that you may otherwise miss. You can tour 
Germany’s capital with an experienced guide by bus, on foot, or by boat.
Bus tours
 Severin + Kühn, Kurfürstendamm 216 (% 030/880-4190; www.severin-
kuehn-berlin.de; U-Bahn: Kurfürstendamm), offers a two-hour “City 
Circle Tour” that departs daily every half-hour from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 
3 p.m. Nov–Mar). Tickets cost 20€ ($27) for adults, 10€ ($14) for children. 
The tour passes 14 important stops in Berlin, including the Europa Center, 
the Brandenburg Gate, and Potsdamer Platz. You can get on and off the 
bus at any point during the hour. The same company’s three-hour “Big 
Berlin Tour” departs at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. daily; costs 22€ ($30) adults, 11€ 
($15) children; and covers more sites (and includes add-ons like Potsdam 
or a river cruise). All tours include a guide who delivers commentaries in 
German and English, making them accessible and enjoyable for kids and 
adults. Severin + Kühn also conducts an interesting tour of Potsdam, site 
of the palace of Sanssouci, former residence of Frederick the Great (see 
“Day-tripping to Potsdam and the Palace of Sanssouci” later in this chap-
ter). The price is 37€ ($50) adults, 17€ ($23) children. Departures are daily 

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
154
at 10 a.m., with an additional 2:15 p.m. tour from April through October on 
Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. All tours depart from Kurfürstendamm 
216 at Fasanenstrasse.
 
 Although you don’t get a guide, the cheapest bus tour of Berlin is public 
bus no. 100 or 200, both of which leave from Bahnhof Zoo and pass most 
of the major sites in western and eastern Berlin. You can catch the double-
decker buses in front of Bahnhof Zoologischer Garten (Zoo Station); head 
upstairs to the front seats for the best views.
BVG (% 030/256-2556; www.bvg.de), the city’s transportation agency, 
offers two open-top double-decker bus tours with commentary in 
German and English. The 11⁄2-hour city tour leaves from Kurfürstendamm 
19, in front of Café Kranzler, and costs 20€ ($27) adults, 10€ ($14) chil-
dren. More fun is the 80-minute “Zille Express” tour with costumed 
guides on historic open-top buses that were used in Berlin from 1916 
and 1928; cost is 10€ ($14) adults; free for children 14 an under (riding 
with a parent). Departure point for the “Zille Express” is the 
Brandenburg Gate at Ebertstrasse.
Walking tours
 
 For an excellent introduction to Berlin and its history, try one of 
the English-language walking tours offered by Original Berlin Walks 
(% 030/301-9194; www.berlinwalks.com). “Discover Berlin” is a three-
hour introductory tour that takes you past the Reichstag and the 
Brandenburg Gate, among other major sites. This walk starts daily at 10 
a.m. and 2:30 p.m. (Nov–Mar at 10 a.m. only). “Infamous Third Reich Sites” 
focuses on the sites of major Nazi buildings in central Berlin, such as 
Goebbels’s Propaganda Ministry and Hitler’s New Reichschancellery; this 
tour, available March through October, starts at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, 10 
a.m. on Sunday, with an additional Wednesday 10 a.m. tour from April 
through September (Sat only at 1 p.m. Nov–Mar). “Jewish Life in Berlin” 
takes you through the prewar Jewish community; the tour starts at 10 a.m. 
Mondays from April through October. You don’t need advance reserva-
tions for any of the tours. You meet the guide, who wears a Berlin Walks 
badge, outside the main entrance to Bahnhof Zoologischer Garten (Zoo 
Station), in front of the taxi stand. Tours last from 21⁄2 to 3 hours and cost 
12€ ($16) adults, 10€ ($14) ages 14 to 25, free for children 13 and under. 
Check the Web site for additional tours and information.

 Chapter 12: Exploring Berlin 155
Boat tours
 A boat tour is the most unusual way to see portions of Berlin. Local water-
ways include the Havel and Spree rivers — ranging in size from narrow 
channels to large lakes — in addition to the many canals created in the 
19th century. Stern und Kreisschiffahrt, Pushkinallee 60–70 (% 030/536-
3600; www.sternundkreis.de), the city’s best-known boat operator, 
offers boat trips from April through October. Be aware, though, that all of 
its tours are given only in German. (On most tours, you can request an 
English translation.) For a quick and interesting take on Berlin from the 
water, the one-hour “Inner City” trip (9€/$12), departing from Nikolaiviertel, 
offers good views of the Reichstag, the Pergamon Museum, the Königliche 
Bibliothek (Royal Library), and the monumental heart of the former East 
Berlin. The same company offers other boat tours from Jannowitzbrücke 
in Berlin-Mitte Schlossbrücke near Charlottenburg Palace, and Hafen 
Treptow. Several other companies offer boat tours as well; just walk along 
the Spreepromenade behind the Berlin cathedral, and you’ll find several 
landing docks with waiting boats.
Going underground in Berlin
The 90-minute underground tours offered by Berliner Unterwelten (% 030/4991-0517; 
www.berliner-unterwelten.de) are among the most popular in the city. 
Tour 1 (“Dark Worlds”) takes you into one of Berlin’s last remaining World War II 
air-raid bunkers and explains what life was like for Berliners during the bombing raids 
that destroyed almost 80 percent of the city. The tour departs daily April through 
October (Nov–Mar Thurs–Sun) at 11 a.m. from the ticket office in the southern exit of 
the U8 Gesundbrunnen U-Bahn station. Tour 2 (“From Flak Towers to Mountains of 
Debris”) visits the city’s last remaining World War II anti-aircraft fortresses. It departs 
April through October at 1 p.m. from the Flak Tower in Humboldthain Park across from 
the U8 Gesundbrunnen U-Bahn station. (Note: You must be at least 18 for this one, and 
wear suitable footwear and warm clothing.) Tour 3 (“Subways, Bunkers and the Cold 
War”) descends into two bunkers, one from World War II and one built during the Cold 
War. It departs from the Dokumentartheater, Brunnenstrasse 105 (U-Bahn: U8 to 
Gesundbrunnen). Tickets for all tours are 9€ ($12) adults, 7€ ($10) seniors and students, 
free for children 10 and under (tours 1 and 3). Buy your tickets at the ticket office in 
the park exit of the Gesundbrunnen U-Bahn station and give yourself enough time to 
reach the starting point.

Following an Itinerary
Every visitor to Berlin faces one problem: how to see as much as possi-
ble in a limited amount of time. What do you see if you have only one, 
two, or three days at your disposal? The itineraries in this section are 
common-sense, limited-time suggestions that include the top Berlin 
sights. For descriptions of most of the stops, see “Discovering the top 
attractions from A to Z” earlier in this chapter.
If you have one day in Berlin
Start early. First visit the Reichstag, where the new dome provides a 
marvelous view out over the city. From there you can walk to the 
Brandenburg Gate, symbol of Berlin, then walk down Unter den Linden, 
exploring the nearby Gendarmenmarkt and paying a brief visit to the 
Pergamon Museum to see the Pergamon Altar and/or the Altes Museum 
to view the famous bust of Egyptian Queen Nerfertiti. Return to 
Potsdamer Platz to see the newest section of Berlin, and then go on to 
Schloss Charlottenburg (Charlottenburg Palace) for a palace tour. In the 
evening, walk along the Kurfürstendamm and dine in a local restaurant.
If you have two days in Berlin
On the second day, take a walking or bus tour of Berlin (see “Seeing 
Berlin by Guided Tour,” earlier), followed by a visit to the Gemäldegalerie 
(Painting Gallery) and the Neue Nationalgalerie (New National Gallery), 
both in the Kulturforum. Afterward, head over to the Jüdisches Museum 
in Freuzberg or explore the Tiergarten. In the evening, enjoy an opera, a 
concert, or a cabaret/variety show.
If you have three days in Berlin
Spend half of the third day in Potsdam, visiting the palace of Sanssouci 
and grounds (see “Day-tripping to Potsdam and the Palace of Sanssouci” 
later in this chapter). In the afternoon, stop in at Mauermuseum Haus 
am Checkpoint Charlie, with its Cold War museum, and end with a stroll 
down Unter den Linden or the Kurfürstendamm.
Shopping for Local Treasures
Berlin is a great shopping city and you can find just about anything you 
want. But keep in mind that you’ll pay less for goods made in Germany 
and the European Union than for goods imported to Germany from the 
United States. German porcelain, china, crystal, and cutlery, for exam-
ple, are prized for their quality, and their prices are lower here than in 
the United States.

 Chapter 12: Exploring Berlin 157
Most stores in Berlin are open Monday through Friday from 9 or 10 a.m. 
to 6 or 6:30 p.m. Many stay open late on Thursday evenings, often to 8:30 
p.m. Saturday hours usually are from 9 or 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., though more 
stores are now staying open later on Saturday. Some stores in highly 
trafficked areas (such as the Hauptbahnhof) are open on Sunday, but 
Sunday shopping is otherwise not common.
Don’t expect a lot of “deals” in Berlin, except on the sales racks in the 
department stores. For the two major Trödelmarkts (flea markets), see 
the “Berlin flea markets” sidebar.
Shopping in western Berlin
Throughout the decades when the wall divided Berlin, the only decent 
shopping was in western Berlin, which remains the best place for all-
purpose, all-around shopping. The shopping scene has definitely moved 
east as well, but the stores there tend to be newer, trendier, and more 
expensive.
Neighborhoods and malls
The main shopping boulevard in the western part of Berlin is the famous 
Ku-Damm, short for Kurfürstendamm (U-Bahn: Kurfürstendamm), which 
is currently undergoing a piecemeal renovation/face-lift to bring it up to 
par with eastern Berlin and lure back shoppers. Quality stores, in addition 
to stores carrying cheap souvenirs and T-shirts, line the street. The spe-
cialty stores on the side streets around the Ku-Damm, especially between 
Breitscheidplatz and Olivaer Platz, are good shopping grounds.
Berlin flea markets
A flea market in Germany is called a Trödelmarkt or a Flohmarkt. The Berliner 
Trödelmarkt (no phone; S-Bahn: Tiergarten), adjacent to the Tiergarten S-Bahn sta-
tion near the corner of the Bachstrasse and Strasse des 17 Juni, is the favorite week-
end shopping spot for countless Berliners, who come to find pieces of kitsch, 
nostalgia, sort-of antiques, and used clothing. The market is open every Saturday and 
Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The same times apply to the flea market at Heidestrasse 
(% 030/452-9924; U-Bahn: Reinickendorfer Strasse), but it’s best to come early 
because many traders leave by midafternoon; here you’ll find antiques and collect-
ibles, including books, porcelain, furniture, and records. If you’re in Mitte on Sunday 
between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., check out the flea market at Arkonaplatz (% 030/786-
9764; U-Bahn: Bernauer Strasse), where you can browse for clothing and bric-a-brac. 
If nothing catches your fancy, just take a seat at one of the many cafes around 
Arkonaplatz and enjoy the scene in one of Berlin’s hippest neighborhoods.

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
158
Another good shopping street in western Berlin, close to Ku-Damm, is 
Tauentzienstrasse (U-/S-Bahn: Zoologischer Garten) and its intersecting 
streets: Marburger Strasse, Ranke Strasse, and Nürnberger Strasse. 
This area offers a wide array of stores, many specializing in German 
fashions for women. Stores here often are cheaper than on the fancier 
Ku-Damm. Berlin’s first shopping mall, the Europa Center (% 030/348-
0088), is on Tauentzienstrasse (U-/S-Bahn: Zoologischer Garten); here 
you find around 75 shops joined by restaurants and cafes. But, truth to 
tell, Europa Center has lost much of its allure and looks dated compared 
to the newly opened Neues Kranzler Eck, an upscale, outdoor retail 
“passage” created right on the Ku-Damm at Joachimstaler Strasse 
(U-Bahn: Kurfürstendamm).
The Uhland-Passage, at Uhlandstrasse 170 (U-Bahn: Uhlandstrasse), 
has some of the best boutiques and big-name stores in Berlin. Shoppers 
interested in quality at any price need to head to Kempinski Plaza, 
Uhlandstrasse 181–183 (U-Bahn: Uhlandstrasse), home to some of the 
most exclusive boutiques in the city, including haute-couture women’s 
clothing. You find trendier boutiques along Bleibtreustrasse.
The new Potsdamer Platz Arkaden (U-/S-Bahn: Potsdamer Platz), one of 
the most comprehensive shopping malls in Berlin, contains about 100 
shops, with more being added all the time, scattered over three levels. 
Some of the stores offer cost-cutting clothing and housewares.
Department stores
Kaufhaus des Westens (called KaDeWe [ka-day-vay] for short), 
Tauentzien 21 (% 030/21210; U-Bahn: Wittenbergplatz), is a huge 
department store, known for its six floors of upscale merchandise and 
sixth-floor food department. Wertheim, Kurfürstendamm 231 (% 030/
880-030; U-Bahn: Kurfürstendamm), is good for travel aids and general 
basics: perfumes, clothing for the entire family, jewelry, electrical 
devices, household goods, and souvenirs. Wertheim has a large restau-
rant with a view over half the city.
Fashion
Every big-name designer you can think of has a store in Berlin, but 
here are some lesser-known retail venues that may be of interest to fash-
ionistas. Bleibgrün, Bleibtreustrasse 30 (% 030/885-0080; S-Bahn: 
Savignyplatz), a small, fashionable women’s shoe store with a helpful 
staff. Bogner Zenker-Berlin, Kurfürstendamm 42 (% 030/881-1000; 
S-Bahn: Savignyplatz), is a long-established shop for men’s and women’s 
clothing made in Germany, Austria, and Italy. Chapeaux Hutmode 
Berlin, Bleibtreustrasse 51 (% 030/312-0913; S-Bahn: Savignyplatz), is 
a couture hatmaker inspired by vintage fashion magazines and glamor-
ous movies from the 1930s. Treykorn, Savignyplatz 13 Passage (% 030/
3180-2354; S-Bahn: Savignyplatz), carries the most avant-garde jewelry 
in Berlin, showcasing more than three dozen of the boldest jewelry arti-
sans in the city.

 Chapter 12: Exploring Berlin 159
Perfumes
Harry Lehmann, Kantstrasse 106 (% 030/324-3582; U-Bahn: 
Wilmersdorferstrasse), is a wonderfully old-fashioned parfumerie where 
most of the scents come from old family recipes, distilled from flowers, 
grasses, and leaves. The prices are amazingly reasonable for the quality 
of the perfumes.
Porcelain and china
Königliche Porzellan-Manufaktur (KPM; Royal Porcelain Factory), 
Kurfürstendamm 27 in Kempinski Hotel Bristol (% 030/8867-2110; 
U-Bahn: Uhlandstrasse), sells porcelain pieces hand-painted and hand-
decorated with patterns based on traditional 18th- and 19th-century 
KPM designs. Meissener Porzellan, Charlottenstrasse 34 (% 030/2045-
8166; U-Bahn: Unter den Linden), one of the most famous porcelain man-
ufacturers in Europe, offers an array of Meissen dinner plates, sculptures, 
and chandeliers. Rosenthal, Kurfürstendamm 226 (% 030/885-6340; 
U-Bahn: Kurfürstendamm), is the place to go for contemporary Rosenthal 
porcelain and china from Bavaria.
Shopping in eastern Berlin
The eastern part of the city has undergone major changes in the retail 
sector since reunification. The main street, Friedrichstrasse (U-/S-Bahn: 
Friedrichstrasse), now offers some of Berlin’s most elegant shopping, 
with upmarket boutiques selling everything from women’s fashions to 
Meissen porcelain. The largest shopping mall in eastern Berlin, offering 
a little bit of everything, is at the Berliner Markthalle, at the corner of 
Rosa-Luxemburg-Strasse and Karl-Liebknecht-Strasse (U-/S-Bahn: 
Alexanderplatz).
For more shopping in the eastern part, see “Berlin’s newest old shop-
ping neighborhood: Scheuneviertel,” in this chapter.
Berlin’s newest old shopping 
neighborhood: Scheuneviertel
The newest shopping, arts, and happening neighborhood area is eastern Berlin’s 
Scheuneviertel, or “barn district” (S-Bahn: Hackescher Markt), named for the hay 
barns that once stood here. The area later became Berlin’s Jewish quarter, and, amaz-
ingly, some of its oldest buildings survived the World War II bombing raids that reduced 
most of Berlin to rubble. A grand pre–World War I shopping arcade with intercon-
nected courtyards (Hinterhöfe) occupies most of the block formed by Oranienburger 
Strasse, Rosenthaler Strasse, Grosse Hamburger Strasse, and Sophienstrasse. The 
spaces within the courtyards have now been turned into a series of galleries, studios, 
and theaters. Cutting-edge shops line the streets around the arcade.

Discovering Nightlife in Berlin
You find more going on in Berlin than in any other city in Germany. The 
performing-arts scene is jammed with opera, dance, orchestra and 
chamber concerts, variety shows, and theater performances every night 
of the week. Berlin’s nightlife is legendary, with hundreds of bars, clubs, 
and cabarets appealing to every taste.
Finding out what’s happening
Check the listings in Zitty (www.zitty.de) or Berlin Programm, avail-
able at all newsstands, for the latest schedules of what’s going on where. 
An excellent online source is www.visitberlin.de.
Getting tickets
You can buy tickets at the venue’s box office (the box office is called a 
Kasse, pronounced kah-suh). Tickets can usually be purchased right up 
to curtain time. Alternatively, you can buy tickets from ticket agencies, 
which charge a commission. Tickets for more than 100 venues, including 
opera, classical concerts, musicals, and cabarets are available at 
Hekticket (www.hekticket.de), with outlets in the Deutsche Bank 
foyer at Hardenbergstrasse 29 (% 030/230-9930; U-Bahn: Zoologischer 
Garter) and Karl-Liebknecht-Strasse 12, on the S-Bahn bridge at 
Alexanderplatz (% 030/230-9930; U-/S-Bahn: Alexanderplatz); both are 
open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; the Zoo location 
is also open Sundays from 2 to 6 p.m.
For some of the larger opera, ballet, and classical-music venues, you can 
buy tickets online. If the venue doesn’t have its own Web site, you may 
be able to order tickets online at www.visitberlin.de.
 
 Unsold, day-of-performance tickets for music, dance, and theater venues 
throughout Berlin are sold for up to 50 percent off at the BERLIN infos-
tores; for locations and opening hours, see Chapter 11.
Raising the curtain on performing arts and music
Good news for culture vultures: With three major symphony orchestras, 
three opera houses, ballet companies, and dozens of theaters and caba-
rets, you won’t be lacking for things to do. The newest trend is to start 
performances as early as 6 p.m., so everyone can get home at a reason-
able hour. Whenever possible, I include Web sites in this section so you 
can check performance schedules and ticket information before you 
arrive in Berlin.
 
 A Berlin Welcome Card (see Chapter 11) allows you to buy reduced-price 
tickets (usually 25 percent off) at several major performing-arts venues, 
including the opera houses.

 Chapter 12: Exploring Berlin 161
Opera and ballet
 
 In Charlottenburg, the Deutsche Oper Berlin, Bismarckstrasse 35 (% 030/
343-84-343; www.deutscheoperberlin.de; U-Bahn: Deutsche Oper), is 
the 1950s-era opera house that served the former West Berlin. You can see 
both opera and ballet here in a house with no bad sightlines. The box 
office is open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. up to the time of 
performance and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. You also can buy tick-
ets online. Ticket prices range from about 12€ to 118€ ($16–$159).
The Staatsoper Unter den Linden, Unter den Linden 7 (% 030/20-35-40; 
www.staatsoper-berlin.org; U-Bahn: Unter den Linden), is housed 
in a historic building in Berlin-Mitte; some seats in the upper rings have 
limited views of the stage. The programs feature opera and ballet perfor-
mances. The box office is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 8 
p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 2 to 8 p.m. You can buy tickets 
online. Tickets range from about 15€ to 120€ ($20–$162).
Berlin’s Komische Oper, Behrenstrasse 55–57 (% 030/4799-7400; www.
komische-oper-berlin.de; U-/S-Bahn: Unter den Linden), is a famous 
and well-respected East Berlin house with a unique artistic identity; 
operas, musicals, and symphony concerts are performed here. The box 
office (Unter den Linden 4) is open Monday through Saturday from 9 
a.m. to 8 p.m. and Sunday from 1 p.m. to the time of performance. Prices 
range from 8€ to 93€ ($10–$126).
Symphony orchestras and classical music
 
 In the Kulturforum complex, the renowned Berlin Philharmonic 
Orchestra, under the direction of Sir Simon Rattle, plays in the acousti-
cally outstanding Philharmonie, Matthäikirchstrasse 1 (box office 
% 030/2548-8999; www.berlin-philharmonic.com; U-Bahn: 
Potsdamer Platz). Chamber-music concerts are given at the adjoining 
Kammermusiksaal. The box office is open Monday through Friday from 3 
to 6 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., and one hour before 
performances. Ticket prices range from about 7€ ($9.45) for standing 
room to 110€ ($149). Berlin Phil concerts always sell out, so if you want to 
hear this fabulous orchestra, I suggest you order your tickets online sev-
eral weeks before your trip.
The historic Schauspielhaus in the former East Berlin has undergone a stun-
ning transformation and is now the Konzerthaus am Gendarmenmarkt, 
Gendarmenmarkt (% 030/203-090; www.konzerthaus.de; S-Bahn: 
Unter den Linden). The Berlin Symphony Orchestra and other orches-
tras and classical music groups perform in this glittering, pitch-perfect 
hall. Different ticket prices apply for each event. You can buy tickets at 
the Konzerthaus box office, which is open daily noon to 6 p.m. and an 
hour before performances.

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
162
The city’s third major orchestra, the Konzerthausorchester Berlin 
(www.konzerthaus.de), performs at both the Philharmonie and the 
Konzerthaus am Gendarmenmarkt. Tickets are available at the box 
offices of both venues.
Theater
Berlin’s theater scene is outstanding. The Web site www.visitberlin.de 
has a useful listing of plays and films in English. The Berliner Grundtheater 
(% 030/7800-1497; www.thebgt.de) performs English-language plays 
in different venues around the city. If you don’t speak the language but 
want to experience German theater, I recommend going to see a produc-
tion by the famous Berliner Ensemble, Bertolt-Brecht-Platz 1 (% 030/
2840-8155; www.berliner-ensemble.de; U-Bahn: Friedrichstrasse). 
Playwright Bertolt Brecht formed this group with his wife, Helene Weigel, 
and many theater fans enjoy seeing Brecht’s plays performed in “his” 
theater. The box office is open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 
6 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and one hour before 
performances. Ticket prices range from about 5€ to 30€ ($6.75–$41).
Cabarets and variety shows
 
 Berlin has long been famous for its cabarets and variety shows, and spend-
ing an evening in one can be enjoyable even if you don’t speak a word of 
German.
Die Stachelschweine (The Porcupine), Europa Center, Tauentzienstrasse 
and Budapester Strasse (% 030/261-4795; www.diestachelschweine.
de; U-Bahn: Kurfürstendamm), is a cabaret that’s been poking fun at the 
German and American political scenes for many years now. Part of the 
performance usually involves a selection of popular songs. Shows take 
place Tuesday through Friday at 7:30 p.m. and Saturday at 6 p.m. and 
9:15 p.m. The cover charge is 13€ to 26€ ($18–$35). This cabaret is 
closed in July.
Friedrichstadt-Palast, Friedrichstrasse 107 (% 030/2326-2326; www.
friedrichstadtpalast.de; U-/S-Bahn: Friedrichstrasse), in Mitte, 
is a big theater that features variety acts from around the world. 
Performances take place almost daily (check the Web site or call for 
show times). Ticket prices range from 17€ to 70€ ($23–$94).
Wintergarten Variété, Potsdamer Strasse 96 (% 030/2500-8888; www.
wintergarten-variete.de; U-Bahn: Kurfürstenstrasse), is the largest 
and most nostalgic Berlin cabaret, with a nightly variety show featuring 
magicians, clowns, jugglers, acrobats, and live music. The most expen-
sive seats are on stage level; balconies have conventional theater seats 
(but drinks are sold there, too). Shows begin at 8 p.m. Monday through 
Friday, and Saturday at 6 and 10 p.m. Cover is 25€ to 69€ ($34–$93), 
depending on the show and the day you attend.

Checking out the dance clubs and bars
If you’re into nightlife, you can find something to do all across the city. 
This section includes just a few of the bars and dance clubs in Berlin. 
For more listings, visit www.clubguideberlin.de.
 
 Bars and clubs don’t generally get going until midnight. Many bars now 
have an open-ended closing policy. An empty club may choose to close at 
2 a.m., but a packed club can stay open until 6 a.m. Keep in mind that new 
bars open and bars close all the time; this section includes places that are 
likely to be around for years to come.
Dance clubs
Chip, Berlin Hilton, Mohrenstrasse 30 (% 030/20230; U-Bahn: Stadtmitte), 
is a glossy and popular dance club with a great lighting system, video 
clips, and fog machine. Club hours are Wednesday through Saturday 
from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. Cover is 5.50€ ($7.40).
Delicious Doughnuts, Rosenthalerstrasse 9 (% 030/280-9974; U-Bahn: 
Rosenthaler Platz), has nothing to do with doughnuts (it did sell them 
at the bar at one time) and everything to do with DJs and dancing 
(Brazilian, bossa nova, and funk). The room is red, the dance floor small, 
and it’s open every night from 10 p.m.
Far Out, Kurfürstendamm 156 (% 030/3200-0717; U-Bahn: 
Adenauerplatz), is a large, industrial-looking late-night disco that plays 
mostly high-energy retro rock for a crowd that includes lots of students. 
The club is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The 
cover ranges from 3€ to 8€ ($4.05–$11).
Metropole, Nollendorfplatz 5 (% 030/217-3680; U-Bahn: Nollendorfplatz), 
housed in an old theater with an Egyptian temple interior, draws a 
young 20-something crowd. The club is open Friday and Saturday nights 
from 9:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. Cover is 10€ to 16€ ($14–$22).
SO36, Oranienstrasse 190 (% 030/6140-1306; U-Bahn: Prinzenstrasse), 
in trendy Kreuzberg, has two very large rooms, a stage for floor shows, 
and highly danceable music; the crowd is a hip mixture of gay and 
straight. The club is open most nights from 10:30 p.m. to 4 a.m.; call first 
to verify. Cover usually is about 5€ ($6.75).
Live music
A Trane, Pestalozzistrasse 105 (% 030/313-2550; U-Bahn: Savignyplatz), 
is a small, smoky jazz club featuring musicians from around the world. 
The club is open Monday through Thursday from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m., Friday 
and Saturday from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. Cover is 8€ to 13€ ($11–$18), depend-
ing on the night and who’s playing.

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
164
Knaack-Klub, Greifswalderstrasse 224 (% 030/442-7060; U-Bahn: 
Alexanderplatz), in happening Prenzlauer Berg, is a four-story club with 
live rock shows four nights a week featuring German and international 
touring bands. Show days vary, so call first. You always find dancing on 
Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday nights. Opening hours vary; closing is 
rarely before 4 a.m. Cover is 5€ to 15€ ($6.75–$20), depending on the 
band.
Quasimodo, Kantstrasse 12A (% 030/312-8086; U-Bahn: Zoologischer 
Garten), is Berlin’s top jazz club, where you encounter many different 
styles of music, including rock and Latin jazz. The club is open Tuesday 
through Saturday from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Admission is free on Tuesday and 
Wednesday when local musicians perform; otherwise, it’s 13€ ($18).
Wild at Heart, Wienerstrasse 20 (% 030/611-7010; U-Bahn: Görlitzer 
Bahnhof), is dedicated to hard-core punk, rock, and rockabilly, with 
bands from Germany and elsewhere playing Wednesday through 
Saturday nights. The club is open Monday through Friday from 8 p.m. to 
4 a.m., Saturday and Sunday from 8 p.m. to 10 a.m. Admission is about 
5€ ($6.75) for concerts; otherwise, it’s free.
Popular bars
Later is better if you want to go out bar-hopping and see what’s happen-
ing in Berlin. Expect to pay at least 6€ ($8) for a straightforward drink, 
more for anything exotic, less for a glass of beer. The following bars cur-
rently are popular. These places tend to be fashion-conscious, so you 
may feel out of place if you show up in blue jeans and sneakers.
Bar am Lützowplatz, Lützowplatz 7 (% 030/262-6807; U-Bahn: 
Nollendorfplatz), one of the longest and narrowest bars in Berlin, is hip 
and fun, open daily from 3 p.m. until 4 a.m.
Harry’s New York Bar, Lützowufer 15 in Grand Hotel Esplanade (% 030/
2547-8821; U-Bahn: Nollendorfplatz), with minimalist décor, pop art, and 
photographs of American presidents, has a menu listing almost 200 drinks 
and a limited selection of food. Harry’s is open daily from noon to 2 a.m.
Lore Berlin, Neue Schönhauser Strasse 20 (% 030/2804-5134; U-Bahn: 
Rosenthaler Platz), features cutting-edge design, great dance music, and 
an intriguing mix of people hanging around a long and narrow bar with 
theatrical lighting that makes almost everyone look attractive. Lore 
Berlin is open nightly until 3 a.m.
Reingold, 11 Novalistrasse (% 030/2838-7676; U-Bahn: Friedrichstrasse), 
is chic and elegant, geared toward a very late-night glamour crowd. The 
place is open nightly until 4 a.m.
Times Bar, Savoy Hotel, Fasanenstrasse 9 (% 030/311-030; U-/S-Bahn: 
Zoologischer Garten), quiet, cozy, and intimate, is reminiscent of a wood-
paneled private club in London. The Times Bar isn’t a late-night-scene 

 Chapter 12: Exploring Berlin 165
bar, but rather a place where you can relax in a big leather chair and 
read The Times of London. Times Bar is open daily from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m.
Neighborhood bars: Kneipes and Lokals
Do you want to find a casual, unpretentious spot for a plain old glass of 
bier vom Fass (beer on tap)? What you need is a Kneipe (ka-nigh-puh), a 
cozy place similar to a neighborhood pub in the U.K. or a local tavern in 
the U.S. A small bar like this sometimes is called a Lokal (low-call). Many 
Berliners have a favorite Kneipe where they stop in after work or later in 
the evening for a beer and a chat with their friends. Brewpubs also are 
good places to sample beer, and they offer meals (see the “Sampling 
fresh beer at brewpubs” sidebar in this chapter).
Berlin is home to hundreds of Kneipes and Lokals. A famous one is 
Gaststätte Hoeck, Wilmersdorferstrasse 149 (% 030/341-8174; U-Bahn: 
Bismarckstrasse). Dating from 1892, Gaststätte Hoeck is the oldest 
Kneipe in Charlottenburg and still has its original wood panels with 
inlaid glass on the walls. The bar can be loud, smoky, and raucous. 
Bartenders pour more than a dozen kinds of beer and serve wine by the 
glass. Hours are 8 a.m. to midnight. Traditional food is served in an adja-
cent room Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.; main 
courses run from 5.50€ to 15€ ($7.40–$20).
Sampling fresh beer at brewpubs
Germans have been drinking beer in bars and beer halls for centuries, but microbrew-
eries, where beer is brewed and served on the premises, are a fairly recent develop-
ment. The first Bierhaus (brewpub, or microbrewery) in Berlin, Gasthaus Luisenbräu, 
Luisenplatz 1 (% 030/341-9388; U-Bahn: Richard-Wagner-Platz), opened in 1987 
across the street from Charlottenburg Palace. The house beer is a pale, blond, unfil-
tered, top-fermented beer. You can order beer in a smallish 0.2-liter (6-ounce) glass 
(1.60€/$2.20) or in a 0.4-liter (11-ounce) serving (3.20€/$4.30). The smoky interior of this 
brewpub is comfortably Old Berlin, even though the building is relatively new. You can 
order hearty portions of German food (meat, sauerkraut, dumplings, and salads) to 
accompany your beer. The brewpub is open daily from 9 a.m. until 2 a.m.
Gasthaus Georgenbräu, Spreeufer 4 (% 030/242-4244; U-Bahn: Klostergasse), a 
brewpub in the Nikolaiviertel beside the River Spree, is named after the statue of St. 
George right outside. You can choose between beers brewed on the premises; the 
helles (light) is top-fermented, blond, and unfiltered. The dunkles (dark), also unfiltered 
and top- fermented, has a darkish amber color, a yeasty aroma, and a nice balance of 
hop bitterness and malt flavor. You can also order plates of hearty German food; main 
courses go for 9.50€ to 13€ ($13–$18). The Gasthof is open daily from 10 a.m. to 
midnight.

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany

Day-Tripping to Potsdam and 
the Palace of Sanssouci
Frederick the Great’s Schloss Sanssouci (palace of Sanssouci) in 
Potsdam is the architectural signature of one of Germany’s most domi-
nating personalities. Allow yourself at least half a day to visit this 
remarkable palace and its beautiful grounds. Potsdam, 24km (15 miles) 
southwest of Berlin, a former garrison town on the Havel River, is now 
the capital of the state of Brandenburg. The town celebrated its 1,000th 
anniversary in 1993 and has historic sites of its own, but be sure to make 
the palace of Sanssouci your top priority. (See the “Potsdam” map in 
this chapter.)
Getting there
To get to Sanssouci, you must first get to Potsdam. The trip couldn’t be 
easier: From Berlin, S-Bahn line S7 stops at the Potsdam Hauptbahnhof 
station. Hop on bus no. 695 in front of the station and ride nine stops to 
the Schloss Sanssouci stop. The bus fare is 1.60€ ($2.20). Cross the road, 
turn left, and you’ll almost immediately come to a flight of stairs leading 
up to the palace. If you don’t want to hassle with anything, you can take 
one of the Potsdam–Sanssouci bus tours offered by the sightseeing bus 
companies on Ku-Damm (see “Bus tours” earlier in this chapter); the 
cost is generally about 40€ ($54) for a half-day fast-track tour.
Finding tourist information
Maps, brochures, and inexpensive guidebooks for both the town and 
the palace are available at the Potsdam tourist information office, 
Brandenburger Strasse 3/Am Brandenburger Tor (% 0331/270-9051; 
www.potsdam.de), open Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 
6 p.m. (from 10 a.m. Nov–Mar) and on Saturday and Sunday from 
9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. (until 2 p.m. Sat–Sun in winter).
Discovering the top attractions
Potsdam didn’t gain true importance until the “Great Elector” Friedrich 
Wilhelm (1620–1688) chose the lovely, leafy, lakey area to be his second 
seat of residence outside Berlin. From then on, Potsdam was a royal 
hangout. To escape the rigors of Berlin court life, Friedrich II (called 
Frederick the Great; 1712–1786) built in Potsdam a “small” country 
palace where he could retire sans souci (without a care) and indulge his 
passions for music, poetry, and philosophy.
Schloss Sanssouci (palace of Sanssouci; % 0331/969-4190) is open 
Tuesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (to 4 p.m. Nov–Mar). You 
can see the palace only on a guided tour costing 8€ ($11) adults, 5€ 
($6.75) children and students. Your tour time is printed on your ticket. 
Before setting off on the tour, you’re required to don huge felt slippers 
so you don’t scuff the floors. The tour is given only in German, but 

 Chapter 12: Exploring Berlin 167
information sheets in English are available from the guide, and you must 
ask for them.
 
 A timed-entry system is in effect at Sanssouci. Your ticket tells you what 
time you can enter the palace to begin your guided tour. If you don’t arrive 
early, you may have to wait for a much later tour. Waits in summer months 
can be up to three hours long.
One of the greatest and most beautiful examples of European rococo, 
Sanssouci was built between 1745 and 1747 as Frederick’s summer-
house, a place where he could let his wig down, discuss weighty matters 
with French philosopher Voltaire, and make music with composer Carl 
Philip Emanuel Bach. In short, Sanssouci was a summer resort for an 
enlightened monarch. All kinds of rococo treasures fill the palace; you 
can see them on a tour that lasts about 45 minutes.
Either before or after your tour, spend some time wandering through the 
magnificent landscaped gardens with their bevy of historic buildings.

168
Fred the Great created the original design for the grounds, and his plan-
ning still is evident in the restored vineyard terraces and the area imme-
diately around the palace. All the buildings listed here are signposted so 
you won’t get lost on the grounds.
 
✓ The Bildergalerie (Picture Gallery; % 0331/969-4181), on the east-
ern side of the palace grounds, was completed in 1763 and displays 
a collection of works from the Italian Renaissance and baroque 
eras. The gallery is open Tuesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m. (Nov–Mar until 4 p.m.). Admission is 2€ ($2.70).
 
✓ The Chinesische Teehaus (Chinese Teahouse) is a little gem of a 
rococo building resembling a pagoda. Ornamental “Oriental” build-
ings like this were all the rage in 18th-century Europe. The privi-
leged classes would retire here to drink a new beverage called tea. 
This building is not open to the public.
 
✓ The Neues Palais (New Palace; % 0331/969-4255), the largest 
building in Sanssouci park, was completed in 1769 and used by the 
Hohenzollern royal family. Inside you see rococo rooms filled with 
paintings and antiques. The palace is open Saturday through 
Thursday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 4 p.m. Nov–Mar). Admission is 
8€ ($11) for a grand tour of all the rooms.
 
✓ The mid-19th-century Orangerie (% 0331/969-4280), west of the 
palace, contains copies of paintings by Raphael and features 
ornately decorated salons. The Orangerie is open mid-May to mid-
October, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (closed Thurs). Admission is 3€ ($4.05).
 
✓ Built to look like an English country manor, Schloss Cecilienhof 
(Cecilienhof Palace; % 0331/969-4200) was a royal residence from 
1917 until 1945. At the end of World War II, the palace was used as 
headquarters for the Potsdam Conference attended by the heads of 
the Allied powers, including U.S. President Harry Truman, British 
Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Russian dictator Joseph 
Stalin. Now the palace serves as a hotel and conference center. 
On a guided tour, you can visit the private rooms used by Crown 
Prince Wilhelm and Princess Cecelie. More interesting are the 
rooms used for the Potsdam Conference. The palace is open 
Tuesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 4 p.m. 
Nov–Mar). Admission for the guided tour is 8€ ($11).
Dining at Sanssouci
From May through September, you can grab a quick, inexpensive bite at 
the Biergarten kiosk (no phone; open May–Sept daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.) 
across the road behind the palace of Sanssouci. The food is basic wursts 
with Kartoffelsalat (potato salad). You can eat for under 5€ ($6.75) and 
sit at outdoor tables. In the adjacent pavilion, you find the fancier 
Mövenpick Restaurant “Am Windmühle,” where you can order a com-
plete meal (open year-round daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.).

 Chapter 12: Exploring Berlin 169

Tower) at Alexanderplatz (S-Bahn: 
Alexanderplatz). For hours and other infor-
mation, see Chapter 11.

170
300 terminals; branch locations are in the 
Sony Center and Karl-Marx-Strasse 78.
Maps
The most detailed Berlin map with a com-
plete street index is the fold-out Falk plan, 
available at most newsstands.
Newspapers and Magazines
Newsstands carry Zitty and Berlin-Programm, 
which list events around the city. For more, 
see the Quick Concierge.
Pharmacies
If you need a pharmacy (Apotheke; ah-po-
tay-kuh) at night, go to the nearest one and 
look for a sign in the window giving the 
address of the nearest pharmacy with night-
time hours (such postings are required by 
law). For a centrally located pharmacy, go to 
Europa–Apotheke, Tauentzienstrasse 9–12 
(% 030/261-4142; U-Bahn: Wittenbergplatz), 
located near the Europa Center. In Mitte, 
a few steps from Unter den Linden, is 
the Dorotheenstadtische Apotheke, 
Friedrichstrasse 154 (% 030/204-4817; 
U-Bahn: Friedrichstrasse).
Police
To call the police, dial % 110.
Post Office
The main post office at Joachimstaler 
Strasse 7 (% 030/8870-8611; U-/S-Bahn: 
Zoologischer Garten) is open Monday 
through Saturday from 8 a.m. to midnight, 
Sunday and holidays from 10 a.m. to mid-
night. Regular post office hours are Monday 
through Friday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday 8 
a.m. until noon.
Restrooms
You find public facilities throughout Berlin 
and at all train terminals. Some require 0.50€ 
to get in through a turnstile; in others, if 
there is an attendant, you’re expected to 
leave 0.20€ (25¢) as you depart.
Safety
Berlin is safer than most large U.S. cities. 
As in any large metropolis, use common 
sense and caution when you’re in a crowded 
public area. Single women need to avoid 
the dimly lit streets in Kreuzberg at night. 
Some sidewalk scams have now made an 
appearance; avoid any and all sidewalk 
hucksters.
Taxes
See the Quick Concierge for details.
Taxis
You can hail taxis along Berlin’s major 
streets. Taxis with illuminated roof signs are 
available. For more about fares and where to 
call for a taxi, check out Chapter 11.
Telephones
Finding a coin-operated telephone in Berlin 
is now rare; most accept only Telefonkarte 
(telephone cards), which you can purchase 
in 6€ ($8.10) and 25€ ($34) denominations at 
any post office or news vendor. Many 
phones also accept Visa cards. To make an 
international call, use a call box marked 
inlands und auslandsgespräche. Most have 
instructions in English. You can also make 
long-distance calls from post offices.
Transit Assistance
The Transit Authority (BVG; www.bvg.de) 
provides U-Bahn information (% 030/19449) 
and S-Bahn information (% 030/2974-3333)

Chapter 13
Hamburg, Bremen, 
and Lübeck: Hanseatic 
Cities of the North
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the port city of Hamburg
▶ Touring the ancient city of Bremen
▶ Exploring medieval Lübeck
T
his chapter covers three cities in northern Germany with long histo-
ries of seafaring, trade, and commerce. In medieval times, Hamburg, 
Lübeck, and Bremen were important members of the Hanseatic League, 
the most powerful commercial network in Europe. Hansa cities formed 
trade affiliations that linked northern Germany to the eastern Baltic 
regions and Scandinavia. In fact, Hamburg and Lübeck still retain the 
term Hansestadt (Hanseatic City) in their official titles.
 Don’t expect dry, sunny weather in northern Germany at any time of the 
year. If you’re traveling in the north, even during the summer, an umbrella, 
raincoat, and sweater probably will come in handy.
Hamburg: Germany’s Gateway to the World
 Hamburg, located on the Elbe River about 100km (62 miles) from the 
North Sea, sits amidst a flat, watery landscape that spreads out over 754 
sq. km (294 sq. miles). (See the “Hamburg” map in this chapter.) The ter-
rain is characteristic of northern Germany: low, windswept, often gray and 
misty, but also densely green and filled with trees, marshlands, and lakes. 
A sense of the vast northern seas permeates the city.
Everyone carries away a different impression of bustling, prosperous 
Hamburg, Germany’s second-largest city and also one of the country’s 

 Chapter 13: Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck 173
16 federal states. Some find Hamburg to be a bit smug, even haughty, a 
city of “high culture” and elegance and obsessed with making money. 
For others, Hamburg is sin-city incarnate, land of the lurid Reeperbahn, 
a street where sex is sold over-the-counter, not under. Hamburg has a 
huge, bustling, horn-blaring port, sedate late-19th-century neighbor-
hoods, and is the site of HafenCity (Harbor City), the largest and most 
sophisticated inner-city urban development project in Europe. Much of 
Hamburg was destroyed during World War II, which explains why you 
find historic buildings standing side by side with modern steel-and-glass 
structures. Because of the Elbe and two enormous inner-city lakes, 
you’re as much aware of water as land — Hamburg has more bridges 
than Venice and Amsterdam combined.
Intriguing Hamburg is worth a day or two of your time. If you want to 
explore northern Germany, this city makes a good headquarters. With 
its giant port and strongly international flair, Germans often call it their 
“gateway to the world.”
Getting there
Hamburg is the largest city in northern Germany and is easy to reach by 
train, plane, and car.
By plane
Eight kilometers (5 miles) north of the city center is Hamburg Airport, 
Paul-Baumer-Platz 1–3 (% 040/50750; www.ham.airport.de). Most 
European cities have direct flights to Hamburg. The terminal contains a 
tourist information office (% 040/3005-1300) in the new Airport Plaza 
area between terminals 1 and 2 (open daily 6 a.m.–11 p.m.), an array of 
easily identified banks with currency-exchange windows, and other inde-
pendent currency-exchange services and ATMs.
The easiest way to get into the city is by the Airport Express bus, which 
stops in front of terminals 1 and 4. The bus runs every 15 to 20 minutes 
(5 a.m. to midnight) to the city’s Hauptbahnhof (main train station); the 
journey takes about 25 minutes. The one-way fare is 5€ ($6.75) for adults 
and 2€ ($2.70) for children 11 and under. A taxi from the airport to the 
city costs about 20€ ($27) and takes about 30 minutes, depending on 
traffic. Taxi stands are in front of all the terminals.
By train
Hamburg has two major rail stations. Most trains arrive at the centrally 
located Hamburg Hauptbahnhof, Hachmannplatz 10 (% 040/3918-
3046), and then make a second stop at Hamburg-Altona (% 040/3918-
2387) in the western part of the city. An S-Bahn line connects the two 
stations. Hamburg has train connections with all major German and 
European cities. From Berlin, the trip time is 21⁄2 hours. For train informa-
tion, call Deutsche Bahn (German Rail) at % 11861.

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
176
By car
 
 The A1 autobahn reaches Hamburg from the south and west, the A7 from 
the north and south, the A23 from the northwest, and the A24 from the 
east. A word to the wise: Park your car and use public transportation in 
this busy city.
Finding information
Tourismus-Zentrale Hamburg operates the tourist information office 
(% 040/3005-1300; www.hamburg-tourismus.de) in the main train 
station near the main entrance. The office is open Monday through 
Saturday from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and can 
book a hotel room for you. In the harbor area, you find tourist informa-
tion (% 040/3005-1300) at the St.-Pauli-Landungsbrücken between piers 
4 and 5. This office is open April through October daily from 8 a.m. to 
6 p.m., November through March daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Another good 
online source of information is www.hamburg.de.
Taking a bus tour
 A guided bus tour is the best way to get a feel for Hamburg and its various 
neighborhoods and special areas. Daily tours on double-decker buses 
operated by Hamburger Stadtrundfahrten (% 040/641-3731) leave from 
the Kirchenallee entrance of the main train station. The 90-minute “Top 
Tour” (www.top-tour-hamburg.de) departs every 30 minutes from 
9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (hourly in winter). Cost is 14€ ($19) adults, 7€ ($9.45) 
children 14 and under. The three-hour “Lights of Hamburg” tour (www.
lichter-tour.de) starts at 8 p.m. from May through September and 
includes a visit to the St. Pauli Reeperbahn district and a cruise on the 
Alster. Cost, including two drinks, is 30€ ($37). The two-hour “Maritime 
Tour” includes a visit to the harbor and towns along the Elbe River; buses 
depart daily (Nov–Mar Fri–Sun) at 10 a.m., noon, and 3 p.m. from the St.-
Pauli-Landungsbrüucken. Cost is 14€ ($19) adults, 7€ ($9.45) children. 
Tickets for all tours are available on the bus and all tours have live com-
mentary in English.
Orienting yourself
The Hauptbahnhof is located on the eastern fringe of central Hamburg, the 
city’s commercial and shopping district. Central Hamburg surrounds the 
Alster, a lake rimmed by Hamburg’s most significant buildings. Two 
bridges, the Lombardsbrücke and the Kennedybrücke, divide the Alster 
into the Binnenalster (Inner Alster) and the larger Aussenalster (Outer 
Alster). Pösseldorf, northwest of Aussenalster, is a tree-filled residential 
district with many fine 19th-century villas and Jugendstil (Art Nouveau) 
buildings.
Flanking the Binnenalster on the south is the Jungfernstieg, Hamburg’s 
most vital artery and shopping district. Two canals, Alsterfleet and 
Bleichenfleet, run south from Binnenalster, channeling water from the 

 Chapter 13: Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck 177
Alster to the Elbe. Many of Hamburg’s finest hotels and restaurants clus-
ter around the Binnenalster and the Rathaus (Town Hall), a short dis-
tance to the south. The Hafen (Port) of Hamburg, the world’s seventh-
largest harbor, stretches for nearly 40km (25 miles) along the Elbe River, 
south of Central Hamburg and the Alster. HafenCity, Europe’s largest 
inner-city urban redevelopment project, is rising in the old docklands 
area along the Elbe, east of the harbor. The St. Pauli district, the old 
sailor’s quarter that became the center of Hamburg nightlife, is located 
northwest of the river. The Reeperbahn, a famous neon-lit boulevard 
with cafes, sex shows, bars, discos, and music halls, bisects St. Pauli.
The western district of Altona, formerly a city in its own right, now 
integrated into Greater Hamburg, is the scene of Hamburg’s famous 
Fischmarkt (fish market), which takes place at dawn every Sunday. The 
Altona neighborhood is a great place to explore or have dinner.
Getting around Hamburg
Hamburg is not a compact city and can’t be easily covered on foot. To 
see everything of interest, you have to depend on public transportation 
or taxis. Hamburger Verkehrsverbund (HVV; % 040/19449; www.hvv.
com) operates the U-Bahn (subway), S-Bahn (light rail), A-Bahn (com-
muter rail), buses, and harbor ferries.
 
 The HamburgCard is good for travel on all public transport, admission to 
11 Hamburg museums, and discounts on city tours, guided tours of the 
port, and lake cruises. A one-day card costs 8€ ($11) for one adult and up 
to three children 14 and under. A three-day card costs 18€ ($24) for one 
adult and up to three children. You can buy the card at the tourist infor-
mation offices (see “Finding information,” earlier in this chapter).
The U-Bahn (subway) and buses
Hamburg’s U-Bahn serves the entire central area and connects with the 
S-Bahn light-rail trains in the suburbs. The U-Bahn is the fastest means 
of getting around, but buses offer a good alternative and enable you to 
see more of the city. The fare, which is the same for both U-Bahn and 
bus, depends on how far you travel.
A single one-way fare for both U-Bahn and bus costs 2.50€ ($3.40) within 
Greater Hamburg. Buy your ticket from the bus driver or from automatic 
vending machines at U-Bahn stations and bus stops. A Tageskarte (day 
ticket) for unlimited use of public transportation costs 6€ ($8.10) for an 
adult and includes fare for up to three children traveling with an adult. 
(Note: If you’re going to be sightseeing, you’ll save money by getting the 
HamburgCard, described above.)
Taxis
For a taxi, call % 040/441-011 or 040/666-666. Taxi meters begin at 2.40€ 
($3.25) and rise 1.70€ ($2.30) per kilometer.

Staying in Hamburg
Hamburg is an expensive city with plenty of first-class hotels and a 
limited number of budget accommodations, especially in the center of 
the city. If you arrive without a room, Hamburg’s tourist information 
office in the main train station can help you find accommodations (see 
“Finding information,” earlier in this chapter). You also find hotel-booking 
desks at the airport. You’ll usually find special weekend rates and promo-
tional offers on the hotel Web site.
Also see Chapter 22 for details on the Kempinski Hotel Atlantic 
Hamburg ($$$$).
 Aussen Alster
$$–$$$ Central Hamburg
This small, stylish hotel in a late-19th-century building sits on a quiet resi-
dential street near the Aussenalster lake. The 27 midsize rooms are mini-
malist in terms of décor but very comfortable and meticulously maintained. 
The bathrooms are small with shower-tub combinations. You find an on-
site sauna and solarium, plus an intimate, well-regarded restaurant, the 
Schmilinsky. The hotel can arrange baby-sitting.

able area filled with boutiques, wine bars, shops, and restaurants. Geared 
toward business travelers, the hotel features an array of business-oriented 
in-room amenities. The 227 rooms are priced according to size and degree 
of luxury. The well-done bathrooms have shower-tub combinations. The 
hotel has a day spa and a fitness center with pool and sauna; it can arrange 
baby-sitting.

consists of three adjacent buildings with a total of 255 rooms. The rooms 
vary in size, but most are large with updated modern furnishings; all have 
well-equipped bathrooms with a shower-tub combination. The third and 
fourth floors are nonsmoking. The neighboring ship-shaped Hotel 
Residenz, the Hafen’s modern sister hotel, was built in 1995.

 Hotel Side
$$$$ Central Hamburg
Opened in the spring of 2001, Hotel Side takes high design to new heights. 
A stark white and steel high-tech minimalism is offset by dramatic, glow-
ing colors and contemporary furniture placed as carefully as sculptures. 
Built around a central atrium, the 178 good-sized rooms are quiet and 
comfortable. The luxurious bathrooms have a tub-shower combination. A 
terrace on the eighth floor opens onto panoramic views of Hamburg. 
Amenities include a health club with pool. You may find a bit of attitude, 
but staying here is definitely a memorable experience.

 Park Hyatt Hamburg
$$$$ Central Hamburg
One of the most beautifully designed hotels in Hamburg, the Hyatt occu-
pies a former trading house from 1912 that was transformed into a hotel 
in 1998. Lots of wood and warm-toned fabrics adorn the 252 spacious 
rooms. The large bathrooms have a separate area for Japanese-style soak-
ing tubs. This full-service hotel has virtually every amenity you can imag-
ine, the largest pool in Hamburg, and a fine-dining restaurant called 
Apples (see “Dining in Hamburg,” later in this chapter).

 Pension Helga Schmidt
$ Central Hamburg
This small, traditional, 17-room pension sits right across the street from 
the superdeluxe Kempinski Hotel Atlantic Hamburg (Chapter 22) and 
costs a fraction of the price. You won’t find anything fancy here. But the 
double rooms are of a decent size and have an old-fashioned comfort of 
their own. Some rooms have private bathrooms with showers, others

Wedina
$$–$$$ Central Hamburg
This recently remodeled hotel is in three different buildings painted three 
different colors (red, blue, and yellow). Most of the 42 rooms open onto a 
small, Tuscan-style garden. They range in size from small to medium and 
are individually decorated with modern furnishings. The smallish bath-
rooms have a shower-tub combination. The hotel doesn’t have an eleva-
tor, and to reach rooms on the third floor, you have to climb 55 steps. The 
place is hip without being pretentious.

Dining in Hamburg
It shouldn’t come as any surprise that most of Hamburg’s traditional cui-
sine comes from the sea. On the menus of the city’s many fish restau-
rants, you usually find lobster, shrimp, turbot, plaice, salmon, sole, fresh 
oysters, and eel (Aalsuppe, or eel soup, is a famous Hamburg dish). 
Traditional meat dishes include Stubenküchen (hamburger steak) and 
Labskaus — made with beer, onions, corned beef, potatoes, herring, and 
pickle — which is a hearty, protein-packed dish that sailors and dock-
workers order. Pfannkuchen (pancakes) with cranberries or other fruit 
toppings are popular. Rote Grütze, a local dessert specialty, is a compote 
of red fruits served with vanilla ice cream or cream.
Apples Restaurant
$$$–$$$$ Central Hamburg INTERNATIONAL
Centered around an open kitchen and wood-fired oven, Apples is the 
showcase restaurant of the Park Hyatt Hamburg. The menu, which 
changes according to seasonal availability, features fresh, organically 
grown produce. Appetizers may include ostrich carpaccio or red curry 
soup. As a main course, you may find grilled lobster, char-grilled turbot 
and peppers, saddle of pork, or oven-roasted duck. Fresh specials of the 
day also are available. Come here for an elegant evening out.

With tables tucked along the canal under the fancy shopping arcade that 
lines the Alsterfleet canal (across from the Rathaus, or town hall), this 
cafe/bistro/bar is a chic but casual spot to stop for lunch or an early 
dinner. (You can eat inside, too, but on a nice day, nab a table outside — 
the outside tables are great for people-watching.) I like it because you can 
order something as simple as a salad, but good daily specials are also 
available.

Exploring Hamburg
Surprisingly enough, Hamburg is not a city with many world-class cul-
tural attractions. Sightseeing usually centers on the giant harbor and 
picturesque Alster Lake.
Alster Lake
Sailboats, excursion ferries, windsurfers, and canoes ply the waters of this 
lake that forms the watery heart of central Hamburg. The Alster consists 
of the Binnenalster, a smaller, inner lake with canals running south to the 
Elbe, and the Aussenalster, a larger body of water ringed by fine villas. The 
lake was created in 1235 by damming the meandering Alster River. Walking 
paths and parkland surround the 7km (4 miles) of shoreline. Alsterpark, 
which covers 175 acres on the northwest banks, features beautiful trees, 
flower gardens, and panoramic views of the Hamburg skyline.

 Chapter 13: Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck 185
 Hafen (Harbor)
Hamburg is probably most famous for its busy harbor, one of the largest 
in the world. Its official history dates back to 1189, when the emperor 
Friedrich Barbarossa issued an edict granting free-trading privileges to 
Hamburg. The city still commemorates the event every year in early May 
with three days of huge harborside celebrations, including a windjammer 
parade, fireworks, and hundreds of booths.
The harbor is an open tidal port, in which the North Sea tides influence 
the water level of the Elbe River. Just southeast of Hamburg, where the 
Elbe splits into two arms, there is a giant network of quays, warehouses, 
and dry docks.
Tourist activity centers around the St.-Pauli-Landungsbrücken, a long, 
floating landing stage where you can embark on boat tours of the harbor. 
Docked just east of the landing stage at Pier 1 is the Rickmer Rickmers 
(% 040/319-5959), a 19th-century clipper ship, now a museum of mari-
time history. This former East Indies windjammer is open daily from 10 
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Admission is 3€ ($4.05) adults, 2.50€ ($3.40) children ages 
4 to 12.
 
 The best way to see the port and all its activity is by taking a guided 
harbor tour. Excursion boats operated by Rainer Abicht (% 040/317-
8220; www.abicht.de) leave from St.-Pauli-Landungsbrücken, piers 1 
through 9. Tours depart April through October daily every hour from 10 
a.m. to 6 p.m. (a tour in English departs daily at noon); November through 
March, Saturday and Sunday only from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. The 75-minute 
trip costs 12€ ($16) adults, 6€ ($8.10) children.
See map p. 174. U-Bahn: St.-Pauli-Landungsbrücken (the harbor is right across the 
street).
Seeing the Alster by boat
You can tour both Binnen (inner) and Ausser (outer) Alster by boat. ATG-Alster-
Touristik, Am Anleger Jungfernstieg (% 040/357-4240; www.alstertouristik.
de), offers daily 50-minute trips that depart about every half-hour, late March through 
November, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The steamers leave from the Jungfernstieg quayside 
(U-Bahn: Jungfernstieg). The cost for the tour is 10€ ($14) adults, 5€ ($6.75) children 15 
and under. Commentary is available in English. The same company offers boat tours of 
Hamburg’s canals and along the Elbe.

structed period rooms — from the hall of a 17th-century merchant’s house 
to an air-raid shelter from World War II — illustrate the different eras in 
Hamburg’s history. Give yourself about an hour to browse through the 
exhibits.

Hamburg’s new city within the city
As part of your Hamburg explorations, you might want to take a tour of HafenCity, a 
brand-new district being developed on former dockland islands in the Elbe. It’s the 
largest urban inner-city urban renewal project in Europe and when completed will 
double the amount of available housing in Hamburg, create whole new neighbor-
hoods, and maximize the river as an amenity for urban life with waterside streets, 
plazas, and promenades (plus a new philharmonic hall). HafenCity will also be one of 
the most sustainable building projects in the world. To find out more, visit the 
HafenCity InfoCenter, located in a former power plant at Sandtorkai 30 (% 040/3690-
1799; www.hafencity.de), open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
(until 8 p.m. May–Sept). Free tours of the site are offered year-round on Saturdays at 
3 p.m., and on Thursdays at 6:30 p.m. from May through September. A new viewpoint 
tower overlooks the project. To reach the InfoCenter, take the U3 U-Bahn line to

Rathaus (Town Hall)
Hamburg’s Rathaus, seat of Hamburg’s government, was built in the late 
19th century on a foundation of oak pilings. With some 647 rooms, the 
Renaissance-style structure is the largest of the old buildings in the 
Altstadt (Old City), with a 49m-tall (160-ft.) clock tower overlooking 
Rathausmarkt and the Alsterfleet, the city’s largest canal. The 
Alsterarkaden, across the canal, is an arched passageway with upscale 
clothing shops, jewelry stores, and boutiques. You can combine a visit to 
the Rathaus with a stop at the 16th-century Börse (Stock Exchange), 
Adolphsplatz 1 (% 040/361-3020), which stands back to back with the 
Rathaus. Guides conduct free tours of the Börse on Tuesday and Thursday 
at 11 a.m. and noon. Tours of the Rathaus and the Börse last about 30 to 
45 minutes.

World War II bombings almost completely destroyed the 13th-century 
Gothic St. Jacobikirche. The rebuilt church contains several medieval 
altars, pictures, and sculptures, in addition to one of Hamburg’s musical 
treasures, a baroque organ built in 1693 by Arp Schnitger, a master crafts-
man whose instruments were played by Johann Sebastian Bach. The 
60-register organ at St. James’s is one of only two surviving Schnitger 
organs in Germany.

Tracing your German ancestry
The Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte (see the listing in this chapter) is espe-
cially worth a visit if you have German ancestors and want to do genealogical 
research. The museum’s office of historical emigration contains passenger lists of all 
the people who shipped out of Hamburg from the 1850s to about 1930. On record are 
hundreds of thousands of emigrants’ names including the names of the cities and 
towns in which they originated. To use the service, you need to bring records with you 
that indicate the approximate date that your ancestors left Germany.

St. Michaelis (St. Michael’s Church)
Constructed of brick, like so many other buildings in Hamburg, St. 
Michael’s, completed in 1762, is one of the finest baroque churches in 
northern Germany. The tower, with its hammered-copper roof, is a famous 
Hamburg landmark and the principal reason to visit. Take the elevator or 
climb the 449 steps to enjoy the sweeping view from the top. The crypt, 
one of the largest in Europe, contains the tomb of composer Carl Philipp 
Emanuel Bach. Give yourself about 15 minutes to visit the church and 
tower. One block to the south of the church are the Krameramtswohnungen, 
Hamburg’s last remaining 17th-century brick-and-timber almshouses, 
which have been made into art galleries.

ways. The Alter Botanischer Garten (Old Botanical Garden), south of 
Planten and Blomen, is known for its rare plant specimens and green-
houses filled with tropical flora. The Kleine (small) and Grosse (large)

 Chapter 13: Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck 189
From the Hauptbahnhof, two major shopping streets fan out in a south-
westerly direction toward the Rathaus: the pedestrian-only Spitalerstrasse 
and Mönckebergstrasse. These streets contain some of the city’s less 
expensive stores. Two of the city’s oldest and most prestigious shopping 
streets, Grosse Bleichen and Neuer Wall, run parallel to the canals, con-
nected transversely by Jungfernstieg and Ufer Strasse on the Binnenalster.
Karstadt, Mönckebergstrasse 16 (% 040/30940), is part of a department-
store chain that carries many of the same brands and items as the other 
leading department stores. Less expensive is Kaufhof, Mönckebergstrasse 
3 (% 040/333-070), which offers better deals on merchandise markdowns. 
Alsterhaus, Jungfernstieg 22 (% 040/359-011), carries more-fashionable 
merchandise.

 The performing arts
Hamburgische Staatsoper (Hamburg State Opera), Dammtorstrasse 28

The club, bar, and music scenes
Hamburg is famous for its nightlife. Here’s a small sampling of bars, beer 
halls, nightclubs, dance clubs, and live-music venues:
 
✓ After Shave, Spielbudenplatz 7 (% 040/319-3215; S-Bahn: 
Reeperbahn), a dance club for 20- to 30-year-olds, features funk, 
soul, jazz, and fusion. The club is open Thursday from 11 p.m. to 
4 a.m., Friday from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., and Saturday from 11 p.m. 
to 6 a.m. Cover is 5€ to 9€ ($6.25–$11).
 
✓ Bayrisch Zell, Reeperbahn 10 (% 040/314-281; S-Bahn: Reeperbahn), 
a giant beer hall, is one of the most popular places in the St. Pauli 
district, attracting singles and couples young and old. If someone 
catches your fancy, you can call him or her from the phone on your 
table. The food is okay, too, with meals ranging from 5€ to 15€ 
($6.75–$20). The hall is open daily from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m.
 
✓ Club Grosse Freiheit, Grosse Freiheit 36 (% 040/317-7711; S-Bahn: 
Reeperbahn), in St. Pauli, is where The Beatles performed in their 
earliest days. Today this cultural institution is a free-for-all venue 
with acts that change nightly. Cover is 5€ to 25€ ($6.75–$34).
 
✓ Cotton Club, Alter Steinweg 10 (% 040/343-878; S-Bahn: 
Stadthausbrücke), the oldest and best established of the Hamburg 
jazz clubs, features jazz and Dixieland bands from throughout 
Europe and the U.S. The club is open year-round Monday through 
Saturday from 8 p.m. to midnight; from September through April, 
it’s also open Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Cover charge is 6.50€ 
to 12€ ($8.75–$16), depending on the band.
 
✓ Molotow, Spielbudenplatz 5 (% 040/31-08-45; S-Bahn: Reeperbahn), 
is one of the hottest dance clubs in Hamburg, especially if you’re 
into funk. The club opens at 9 p.m. Wednesday and Sunday and at 
11 p.m. Thursday through Sunday and has no set closing time. 
Cover is 3€ to 15€ ($4–$20).
Gay and lesbian clubs
Hamburg, like Berlin, is one of the major gay centers of Europe, with a 
dense concentration of gay shops, bars, and cafes along Lange Reihe 
just northeast of the train station (U-Bahn: Hauptbahnhof). The free mag-
azine Dorn Rosa, distributed at most gay and lesbian bars, lists the 
city’s many gay and lesbian clubs, restaurants, bars, and events.

 Chapter 13: Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck 191
St. Pauli and the Reeperbahn: 
For adults only
Commercialized sex is a major tourist attraction in Hamburg. The place where it all 
hangs out is the St. Pauli district, just west of the center, along a half-mile thoroughfare 
called the Reeperbahn (ray-per-bahn; S-Bahn: Reeperbahn). The name literally trans-
lates as “Rope Street” and refers to the nautical rope produced there during the 18th 
and 19th centuries. By the mid-1800s, St. Pauli, which is close to Hamburg’s great 
harbor, had become a hangout for sailors and prostitutes, who set up shop with the 
legal sanction of municipal authorities. Many of the prostitutes who work there today 
are licensed and must submit to a medical examination every two weeks.
St. Pauli is a place to visit at night. The area is not exclusively devoted to sex, and you 
do find all kinds of theaters (mostly for musicals and comedies), cabarets, bars, discos, 
and restaurants (although I don’t recommend dining in this area). The district’s sex-
related bars and theaters are up and running by 8 p.m. Between midnight and 5 a.m., 
thousands of “working girls” strut their stuff along the Reeperbahn and through St. 
Pauli’s streets. The most famous street besides the Reeperbahn itself is Herbertstrasse, 
where bordellos line both sides of the street, and the women display themselves behind 
plate-glass windows. Herbertstrasse is open only to men older than 18; metal gates 
block each end of the street. Please note that women are not welcome on 
Herbertstrasse, and may even be doused with a bucket of water if they enter.
Grosse Freiheit, a street whose name appropriately translates as “Great Freedom,” is 
known for its erotic theaters. Municipal regulations forbid prostitution, or overt solicita-
tion, inside erotic theaters. The district also contains the Erotic Art Museum, Nobistor 
10A (% 040/3178-4126), at the corner of Reeperbahn and Grosse Freiheit. Open to those 
older than 16, the museum presents its displays and changing exhibits in a way that’s 
both academic and titillating. The museum is open Sunday through Thursday from noon 
to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday from noon to midnight; admission is 8€ ($11).
Historical Whores Tours (% 01805/125-225; www.hurentours.de) offers one of 
the world’s more unusual walking tours. Led by a professional guide dressed as a 19th-
century Hamburg prostitute (the costume is not what you’d call sexy), the two-hour 
walking tour departs Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m. and takes you to various 
places around the harbor and red-light district and; along the way, you’ll hear the 
whore’s side of the story (tours are in German only). Cost is 25€ ($34) per person, which 
includes a glass of schnapps at tour’s end. You must reserve in advance. The “Red Light 
Tour,” offered at 6 p.m. on Saturday, costs 50€ ($68) and includes a three-course meal 
at the end of your walking tour.

A Side Trip: Bremen
Bremen, 120km (75 miles) southwest of Hamburg, has a history that 
dates back some 1,200 years. (See the “Bremen” map in this chapter.) 
Located on the Weser River, which flows to the North Sea, it was already 
a significant port when it was made an Episcopal see in 787. During the 
Middle Ages, Bremen was one of the strongest members of the Hanseatic 
League, and in 1646, it became a Free Imperial City. Silting of the Weser 
led to the establishment of Bremerhaven, Bremen’s deep-water port at 
the mouth of the Weser, in 1827. With a population of about half a mil-
lion people, Bremen is the second-most important foreign trade location 
in the Federal Republic, after Hamburg. Although it’s mostly an indus-
trial city that was badly damaged in World War II, enough remains in old 
Bremen to make for an intriguing day trip from Hamburg.
Getting to Bremen
By train, the trip time from Hamburg is less than an hour. For train infor-
mation and schedules, call Deutsche Bahn (% 11861). If you’re driving, 
Bremen is a major junction on the A1 autobahn between Hamburg and 
the Rhineland. The airport, Bremen Flughafen (% 0421/55-950), has 
flights from major cities in Germany and Europe.
Finding information and taking a tour
Bremer-Touristik-Zentrale (% 01805/10-10-30; www.bremen-tourism.
de) operates tourist information offices at the Hauptbahnhof (main 
train station; open Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–7 p.m., Sat–Sun 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m.). A 
second branch at Obernstrasse/Liebfrauenkirchhof is open Monday 
through Friday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. If 
you decide to stay overnight in Bremen, this office will help you find a 
hotel or pension.
Guided bus tours, conducted in German and English, depart Tuesday 
through Sunday year-round at 10:30 a.m. from the Central Coach Station 
(Rank M) just behind the tourist information office at the main train sta-
tion. The tour lasts two hours and costs 17€ ($22) for adults and 11€ 
($15) for children younger than 13. Guided walking tours, with English-
speaking guides, depart daily at 2 p.m. from mid-May to early October, 
and Saturdays at 11 a.m. in January and February, from the tourist infor-
mation office at the main train station. They last two hours, and cost 
6.50€ ($8.80), free for children 12 and under. Buy your tickets at the tour-
ist office.
Dining in Bremen
The Ratskeller below Bremen’s Rathaus, Am Markt (% 0421/32-16-76), 
is a wonderfully atmospheric place to try North German regional special-
ties such as Bremer Festtagsuppe (a beef consommé with meatballs, noo-
dles, and vegetables), Bremer Fischtopf (diced salmon, haddock, and red 

 Chapter 13: Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck 193
snapper in a vegetable stock), herring with sour cream and roasted 
potatoes, and Flammkuchen, a pizzalike dish with mushrooms, herbs, 
and cheese. This is also a good place to try a Probierportion (sample por-
tion) of Labskaus, a delicious corned-beef hash mixed with pickled her-
ring, topped with a fried egg, and served with dill pickles and beets. The 
adjoining restaurant, Vor dem Bacchus, serves fresh fish. Main courses 
go for 10€ to 22€ ($14–$30). The restaurants are open daily from noon to 
2:30 p.m. and 7 to 10:30 p.m. All major credit cards are accepted. For 
location, see map p. 193.

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
194
Exploring Bremen
Bremen’s main sights are in the Altstadt, clustered around Marktplatz 
(Market Square), the center of Bremen life for more than a millennium. 
Most of the compact oval Altstadt, with the Weser River along the south 
side and the Stadtgraben canal on the north, is a pedestrian zone and 
can easily be explored on foot. Recent restoration work has brightened 
up the center and its many historic buildings.
From Bahnhofsplatz in front of the train station, head south to 
Herdentor and the bridge that crosses the Stadtgraben canal. To your 
right, in the Wallanlagen, the pretty parkland along the canal (formerly 
the city wall stood here), you’ll see a large Dutch-style windmill. At one 
time, more than a dozen windmills operated in this area.
At the beginning of Sögestrasse (Sow Street), a bronze swineherd and a 
herd of bronze sows and piglets commemorate the street where medi-
eval butchers kept their pigs. A short walk south brings you to the 
Marktplatz, where a 15th-century sandstone statue of Knight Roland, 
the city’s protector, stands guard beside the Rathaus (town hall).
Bremen’s impressive three-story Rathaus (% 0421/36-10) has been 
standing on the Marktplatz for 600 years and was untouched by the 
bombing raids of World War II. The main Gothic structure was built in 
1405, but in 1612 the upper section of the facade was redone in what is 
known as Weser Renaissance style. (Weser Renaissance, a term applied 
to architecture created in and around the Weser River valley between 
1520 and 1620, is characterized by ornate decoration on classically pro-
portioned buildings.) Inside, the upper hall with its beautifully carved 
early-17th-century oak staircase and mural of The Judgment of Solomon 
(1537), was used as council chamber and courtroom. You can visit the 
Rathaus on 45-minute guided tours (generally Mon–Thurs at 11 a.m. and 
noon, plus afternoon tours on weekends; check with tourist office for 
current schedule and to reserve). Admission is 4€ ($5.40) adults, 2€ 
($2.70) children and students. You can dine in the historic Ratskeller 
beneath the building (see “Dining in Bremen,” earlier in this section).
Walk around to the west end of the Rathaus to see Bremen’s most 
famous characters, the Bremen Town Musicians from the Grimm’s fairy 
tale of the same name. Local artist Gerhard Marcks created the bronze 
sculpture of a donkey, dog, cat, and cock in 1951.
Chocolate lovers take note
Hachez, a famous Bremen chocolatier founded in 1890, occupies a charming 18th-
century patrician house near the Rathaus. The shop, Stoevesandt-Diele, Am Markt 1 
(% 0421/50-90-00), is a chocolate-lover’s emporium where you can find sweet spe-
cialties such as chocolate champagne truffles.

 Chapter 13: Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck 195
Directly opposite the Rathaus stands the Schütting, a 16th-century guild-
hall today used by the chamber of commerce (not open to the public). 
Adding a modern architectural touch to the ancient square is the Haus 
der Bürgerschaft, constructed in 1966 and home of Bremen’s Parliament.
At the southeast end of the Marktplatz, towering majestically over the 
entire Altstadt, is St. Petri-Dom (St. Peter’s Cathedral), Sandstrasse 
10–12 (% 0421/36-50-40), originally constructed in 1043 as the archbish-
op’s church and rebuilt in the 16th and 19th centuries. Other than the 
12th-century bronze baptismal font in one of the Romanesque crypts, 
there isn’t much of exceptional interest within the cathedral, which is 
open Monday through Friday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., 
and Sunday 2 to 5 p.m. From Easter through October, you can climb to 
the top of the cathedral towers for a panoramic view of the Altstadt. The 
tower is open Monday through Friday 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Saturday 10 
a.m. to 3:30 p.m., Sunday 2 to 4:30 p.m.; admission is 1€ ($1.35). The 
Dom Museum (Cathedral Museum; % 0421/365-04-41) displays artifacts 
discovered during a restoration of the cathedral in the early 1970s, 
including vestments found in archbishops’ graves and 15th-century wall 
paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder. The museum is open the same 
hours as the cathedral, and admission is free. More interesting than the 
museum is the Bleikeller (Lead Cellar), reached by going outside and 
around to the side of the cathedral. It contains a bizarre collection of 
mummified corpses — 16th- and 17th-century lords, ladies, students, 
and soldiers, plus a cat and a monkey — whose leathery bodies were 
found in graves beneath and around the cathedral. Admission for the 
Lead Cellar is 1.50€ ($2) adults, 1€ ($1.35) students and children; hours 
are Monday, Wednesday, and Friday 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and Thursday 
1:30 to 4 p.m.
The Paula Modersohn-Becker Museum, Böttcherstrasse 6–10 (% 0421/
336-5077), is dedicated to Bremen’s outstanding painter (1876–1907) 
and contains many of her best works, including paintings, drawings, and 
Bells are ringing on Böttcher Street
Böttcherstrasse, running from Marktplatz to the Weser River, is one of the most archi-
tecturally intriguing streets in Germany and one of Bremen’s most noteworthy attrac-
tions. Ludwig Roselius, a rich Bremen merchant who invented decaffeinated coffee, 
paid for the construction of the redbrick buildings that line the street, which was dedi-
cated in 1926 and rebuilt after World War II. Part of the narrow brick-paved street was 
built in an avant-garde German expressionist style; the other part was meant to look 
more traditionally medieval. The street is lined with shops, crafts workshops, restau-
rants, two museums, and galleries. Time your visit to hear the carillon of bells made 
of Meissen porcelain. Every hour between noon and 6 p.m. (Jan–Apr at noon, 3 p.m., 
and 6 p.m.), they play a tune for a full 15 minutes as a sequence of wood-carved 
panels in a revolving tower tells the story of transatlantic aviators.

prints. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
Admission is 5€ ($6.75) adults, 3€ ($4.05) for children. With the same 
ticket, you can visit the nearby Museum im Roselius Haus (same 
address, phone, and hours), a 16th-century merchant’s home filled with 
Ludwig Roselius’s collection of medieval art and furniture.
Böttcherstrasse leads to the Schlachte embankment along the Weser 
River. The riverside promenade is lined with taverns and restaurants 
and serves as the locale for the Weserflohmarkt (Weser Flea Market), 
open every Saturday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Schlachte embankment 
also is where you find guided boat trips (in German only) around the 
harbor. Boats depart from the landing in front of the Martinikirche (St. 
Martin’s Church) daily from March through October at 11:45 a.m., 1:30 
p.m., and 3:15 p.m., on a voyage that lasts about 75 minutes. The cost is 
9€ ($12) adults, 5€ ($6.75) children.
A five-minute walk southeast from the Schlachte brings you to the 
charming albeit touristy Schnoor district, Bremen’s oldest surviving 
quarter. The 16th- and 17th-century cottages in the Schnoor once were 
the homes of simple fishermen. In an effort to revive old arts and crafts, 
they’re now rented to artists and artisans. Sightseers visit not only for 
the atmosphere but also for the unusual restaurants, shops, and art 
galleries.
Lübeck: In a (Hanseatic) League of Its Own
Seven Gothic church spires rise above the picturesque town of Lübeck, 
located 66km (41 miles) northeast of Hamburg in the state of Schleswig-
Holstein. (See the “Lübeck” map in this chapter.) Along the ancient 
streets of its Altstadt you find more buildings from the 13th to the 15th 
centuries than in any other city in northern Germany. Most of the build-
ings, including the churches, are fine examples of the redbrick architec-
ture so characteristic of northern Germany. The city’s architectural 
heritage is so rich that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) placed Lübeck on its World Heritage list 
of international monuments. (UNESCO bestows World Heritage status to 
places judged to have exceptional cultural and historic value.)
From the 13th century on, Lübeck was capital of the Hanseatic League, 
the powerful association of merchants that controlled trade along the 
Baltic as far as Russia. The town still retains the name Hansestadt 
Lübeck.
Lübeck makes a rewarding day trip from Hamburg, less than an hour 
away by train, but its charms may beguile you to stay overnight. With its 
enormous churches, high-gabled houses, massive gates, and historic 
buildings at every turn, Lübeck is a delightful city to explore.

 Chapter 13: Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck 197

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany

By boat, you can take a passenger or car ferry service between Denmark 
(the port of Rødbyhaven) and Lübeck (the port of Puttgarden). ScandLines 
(% 04371/865-161; www.scandlines.com) offers daily departures. TT 
Saga Line (% 04502/80181; www.ttline.de) operates between the 
German port of Travemünde and the Swedish port of Trelleborg.
By car, you can reach Lübeck via the A1 autobahn north and south.
Finding information and taking a walking tour
In the train station, Touristinformation Hauptbahnhof (% 0451/864-675) 
is open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. and from 3 to 
6 p.m. The Lübeck und Travemünde Tourist Service Welcome Center, 
Holstentorplatz 1 (% 0451/8899-700; www.luebeck-tourismus.de), 
across from the Holstentor Museum, is open Monday through Friday 
from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 7 p.m. in summer), Saturday from 10 a.m. 
to 3 p.m.; and Sunday (summer only) from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. This office 
can help you with hotel reservations. Two-hour walking tours (in 
German; 6€/$8.10) of the historic city depart from the Holstentor tourist 
office Monday through Saturday at 2 p.m. (additional walks at 11 a.m. 
May–Oct) and on Sundays year-round at 11 a.m.; in the summer, the 
walk is conducted in English on Saturdays at 11:30.
Lübeck’s Nobel sons
Lübeck has had several famous sons, notably Thomas Mann and Willy Brandt. As a 
young man, Brandt (1913–1992), who later became West German chancellor and won 
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971, opposed the Nazis so vehemently that he had to flee on 
a boat to Norway. At the Willi-Brandt-Haus Lübeck, 21 Königstrasse (€ 0451/122-4250; 
www.willy-brandt-luebeck.de), a permanent exhibition chronicles Brandt’s 
life and legacy from the Weimar Republic to the reunification of Germany, focusing on 
the topics of democracy, human rights, and peace. Public tours are offered Saturday 
and Sunday at 3 p.m.; cost is 4€ ($5.40). The writer Thomas Mann (1875–1955) used his 
hometown of Lübeck as the setting for his novel Buddenbrooks, which catapulted the 
27-year-old author to international fame in 1902. In 1929, Mann won the Nobel Prize for 
literature. The Buddenbrookhaus (described in “Walking through Lübeck,” in this 
chapter), which belonged to Mann’s grandparents, is a place of literary pilgrimage for 
fans of Mann. Günter Grass, author of The Tin Drum, won the Nobel Prize for literature 
in 1999. Although he was not born in Lübeck, he lives nearby. The relationship between 
Grass’s literary output and his artwork is explored in the permanent exhibits at the 
Günther Grass House, Glockengiesserstrasse 21 (% 0451/122-4231; www.guenter-
grass-haus.de), which opened in 2002. Here you can see some of Grass’s paint-
ings, drawings, and sculptures. Grass unleashed a torrent of criticism in 2006 when he 
revealed, in advance of the publication of his autobiography, that he had served in the 
Nazi Waffen SS at age 17; some critics suggested the Nobel Prize committee should 
revoke Grass’s prize. The museum is open daily from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. (closed Mon 
Jan–Mar). Admission is 5€ ($6.75) adults, 2€ ($2.70) students and children.

 Chapter 13: Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck 199
Orienting yourself
The Trave and Wakenitz rivers and other waterways encircle Lübeck’s 
Altstadt, an oval-shaped island a little more than a mile long and less 
than a mile wide. Eight bridges connect the Old City with greater Lübeck 
on the mainland. Only about 12,000 residents (out of about 225,000) live 
on the island, which is where all the major attractions are located.
Getting around Lübeck
The Altstadt and all the major attractions can be reached on foot from 
the train station. You also can take buses 5, 6, 7, 11, 14, or 16 from the 
train station into the Altstadt. The fare is 2€ ($2.70).
 
 A fun and relaxing way to see Lübeck is by water. Excursion boats oper-
ated by MAAK-Linie (% 0451/706-3859; www.maak-linie.de) leave 
from docks on the Trave River just north of the Holstentor. In summer, 
departures are hourly between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. (11 a.m.–4 p.m. the rest 
of the year). The trip (commentary in German with English text available) 
lasts one hour and encircles the entire Altstadt. Cost is 7€ ($9.45) adults, 
5.50€ ($7.40) seniors, and 3€ ($4.05) children.
Staying in Lübeck
Lübeck offers a full range of hotel options, from small inns and pensions 
to modern facilities. To enjoy the ancient, atmospheric charms of 
Lübeck, I recommend that you choose a hotel in the Altstadt. The 
Lübeck and Travemünde Tourist Service (see “Finding information and 
taking a walking tour” earlier in this chapter) also can help you find a 
room.
Klassik Altstadt Hotel
$$ Altstadt
If you want to stay in a smaller, older hotel in the Altstadt, Klassik Altstadt 
Hotel is a good choice. The 28 individually decorated rooms, all named for 
famous Lübeckers, have a pleasant, traditional style. Most of the bath-
rooms have showers; a few have tubs. The on-site restaurant is good and 
moderately priced.
Special events in Lübeck
The Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival, one of the best music festivals in Europe, 
takes place in Lübeck (which has a famed music school) from mid-July until the end 
of August every year. For more information, call % 0800/7463-2002 or log on to www.
shmf.de. A popular Christmas market featuring handmade wares from all across 
northwestern Germany takes place during the three weeks preceding Christmas.

tional 16€ ($20).

Dining in Lübeck
As you may have guessed, fresh seafood from the North and Baltic seas 
is featured on the menus of many restaurants in Lübeck. In this section 
are a few good restaurants where you can dine well in historic 
surroundings.
Historischer Weinkeller
$$–$$$ Altstadt TRADITIONAL NORTH GERMAN
The Historischer Weinkeller, located beneath the 13th-century Heiligen-
Geist-Hospital (see the “Walking through Lübeck” section next), is an 
atmospheric restaurant with an international menu. You can choose from 
several different fixed-priced menus, including a summertime lübsche 
Gasterei (Lübeck hospitality), a seven-course medieval feast. You may 
begin with smoked Norwegian salmon, goose-liver pâté, or a fish-based 
soup. Entrees range from filet of cod with sauerkraut and poached had-
dock in a mustard sauce to meat dishes and vegetarian choices. Note: This 
restaurant is divided into two sections, the Kartoffelkeller (potato cellar) 
and the Weinkeller (wine cellar); of the two, the Weinkeller is the more 
pleasant place to dine.
See map p. 197. Koberg 8. % 0451/76234. Main courses: 15€–22€ ($20–$30); fixed-
price menu 25€–40€ ($34–$54). AE, MC, V. Open: Daily noon to midnight.
Ristorante Roberto Rossi im Schabbelhaus
$$–$$$ Altstadt ITALIAN/TRADITIONAL GERMAN
Occupying two elegant town houses on a lovely medieval street, 
Schabbelhaus serves good Italian cuisine and some classic North German 
dishes. The atmospheric dining room overlooks a small garden. Try the 
crab soup, if available, followed by fresh fish from the Baltic Sea. You also 

 Chapter 13: Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck 201
can get pasta dishes such as tagliatelle with fresh mushrooms or with 
salmon and lemon. The service is attentive, the wine list is excellent, and 
the tasting menus are good value for money.
See map p. 197. Mengstrasse 48–52. % 0451/72011. Main courses: 8€–25€ ($11–$34); 
fixed-price menus 35€–57€ ($47–$77). AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat noon to 2:30 p.m. 
and 6–11 p.m.
 
 Schiffergesellschaft
$$–$$$ Altstadt TRADITIONAL NORTH GERMAN
A popular spot for tourists and locals alike, this historic restaurant is a 
good place to enjoy regional specialties, especially fish. In the front dining 
room, decorated with wooden ship models hanging from the ceiling, you 
sit at wooden tables lit by candlelight; there’s a lighter, more modern 
dining room behind it. The fish here is excellent and recommended. As a 
starter, order “herring three ways” on black bread. Then I’d recommend 
the fish plate, which comes with three different kinds of fish, all delicious. 
An English-language menu is available to help guide your choices, and the 
staff is friendly and professional.
See map p. 197. Breite Strasse 2. % 0451/76776. Reservations recommended. Main 
courses: 15€–25€ ($20–$34). AE, MC, V. Open: Daily 10 a.m. to midnight.
Walking through Lübeck
Concentrate your sightseeing in Lübeck’s remarkable Altstadt, sur-
rounded by the Trave River and its canals. About one-fifth of the Altstadt 
was destroyed in a 1942 bombing, but approximately 1,000 medieval 
buildings still stand within a 5-sq.-km (2-sq.-mile) area around the 
Marktplatz. Builders used brick as the predominant material for houses, 
churches, shops, and guildhalls. The city mandated the use of brick after 
fires in the 13th century destroyed many wooden structures.
What follows are the stops on a walking tour of the Altstadt that begins 
at the Hauptbahnhof (train station). The entire walk, with stops at 
museums, takes about four to five hours.
The sweet side of Lübeck
Lübeck is the world capital of Marzipan, a sweet almond paste. According to legend, 
Lübeckers ran out of flour during a long siege and started grinding almonds to make 
bread. They were so pleased with the sweet results that they’ve been making 
Marzipan ever since. To sample Lübeck’s famous Marzipan, stop in at Cafe 
Niederegger, Breitestrasse 98 (% 0451/53010), located right across from the main 
entrance to the Rathaus since 1806. On the ground floor, you can purchase bars and 
boxes of Marzipan to take away (an excellent gift idea), or you can go upstairs to the 
pleasant cafe for dessert and coffee. Niederegger is open daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
202
 
 Admission to each of Lübeck’s museums is 5€ ($6.75) adults, 2€ ($2.70) 
children and students. If you’re going to visit two or more museums, you’ll 
save money with a Kombi-Ticket “Duo,” good for two museums (7€/$9.45 
adults, 3€/$4.05 children and students, 16€/$22 family); the Kombi-Ticket 
“Trio,” good for three museums (10€/$14 adults, 4€/$5.40 children and 
students, 22€/$30 family); or the “Eine für Alle” (One for All) ticket, valid 
for seven days and good for all the museums (15€/$20 adults, 6€/$8.10 
children and students). Buy the special tickets at the first museum you 
visit.
From the train station, cross the Puppenbrücke (Puppets’ Bridge) and 
head east into the Altstadt. The bridge got its irreverent name from the 
seven statues of classical gods and goddesses that stand on its stone 
railings.
 
1. After you enter the Altstadt, directly in front of you is the 15th-
century Holstentor (Holsten Gate), once the main town entrance. 
Here you’ll find the new tourist Welcome Center and the newly 
revamped Museum Holstentor (% 0451/122-4129), a local history 
museum housed within the gate and exhibiting a model of Lübeck 
as the town appeared in the mid 17th century, models of Hanseatic 
Kogge (cogs, or single-sail vessels), and medieval torture instru-
ments. The museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (11 a.m.–
5 p.m. Jan–Mar Tues–Sun). Admission is 5€ ($6.75) adults, 2€ ($2.70) 
students and children 17 and under. You can see everything in less 
than 30 minutes.
 
2. Just south, across the street from the Holstentor, stand the 
Salzspeicher (Salt Lofts), a group of six gabled Renaissance build-
ings; the oldest dates from 1579, the newest from 1745. Merchants 
stored salt (considered “white gold”) from nearby Lüneburg in 
these buildings before shipping it to Scandinavia, where the salt 
was used to preserve fish.
 
3. Continuing a few blocks east on Holstenstrasse, you reach Lübeck’s 
Rathaus, Rathausplatz (% 0451/122-1005), one of the oldest and 
most beautiful town halls in Germany.
 
 The Rathaus has been rebuilt several times since the first founda-
tion stone was laid in 1230. The present building, topped by slender 
turrets, is a mixture of Gothic and Renaissance styles. Black glazed-
brick courses (horizontal lines) and round panels emblazoned with 
coats of arms adorn the redbrick walls. The building sits on brick 
arcades that allow easy access to the main entrance on Breite 
Strasse. You can see the interior on a guided tour (in German) 
Monday through Friday at noon and 3 p.m.; the cost is 3€ ($4.05) 
adults, 1.50€ ($2) children and students.
 
4. The Rathaus stands on the north and east sides of the Marktplatz, 
a large square filled with meat, fruit, and vegetable stalls every 
Monday and Thursday. In December, the Markt is the site of 
Lübeck’s famous Christmas Market.

 Chapter 13: Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck 203
 
 Towering above the Markt is one of northern Germany’s most out-
standing examples of the brick Gothic style, the twin-towered 
Marienkirche (St. Mary’s Church), Schüsselbuden 13 (% 0451/397-
700). The Marienkirche served as a model for many other churches 
built in the Baltic region. Its central nave, 36m (120 ft.) high, has the 
highest brick vaulting in the world. During a World War II bombing 
attack, the tower bells crashed down into the church and embed-
ded themselves in the stone floor. They still lie there, left as a 
reminder and warning of the horrors of war. Organ concerts take 
place during the summer and fall, carrying on a tradition estab-
lished by St. Mary’s best-known organist and composer, Dietrich 
Buxtehude (1637–1707).
 
5. If you’re a fan of the great German writer Thomas Mann, whose works 
include Death in Venice, The Magic Mountain, and Buddenbrooks, plan 
to spend at least half an hour at Buddenbrookhaus, Mengstrasse 4 
(% 0451/122-4192; www.buddenbrookhaus.de), just north of the 
Marienkirche.
 
 This big, solid, stone-and-stucco house with a gabled roof belonged 
to Mann’s grandparents and was the model for the family home 
Mann wrote about in Buddenbrooks. Inside, you find a comprehen-
sive collection of photographs, letters, and documents chronicling 
Mann’s life, and that of his family, from birth to death. Mann’s 
brother, Heinrich Mann (1871–1950), was the author of Professor 
Unrat, the source of the movie The Blue Angel. On the second floor 
are period rooms and artifacts. The house is open April through 
October daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., the rest of the year daily from 
11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admission is 5€ ($6.75) adults, 2€ ($2.70) 
students.
 
6. An outstanding collection of German Romantic and German 
Impressionist paintings is on view at Museen Behnhaus/Drägerhaus, 
Königstrasse 9–11 (% 0451/122-4148), a few blocks north of the 
Rathaus.
 
 The museum, formed from two 18th-century town houses, also 
displays major 20th-century artists such as Leon Kirchner, Max 
Beckmann, and Ernst Barlach, and has exhibits relating to the city’s 
cultural life in the 18th and 19th centuries. The museum is open 
White gold and black bricks
In Lübeck and in other cities in northern Germany, you’ll sometimes see medieval 
redbrick buildings decorated with black glazed bricks. The black glaze comes from 
salt being sprinkled on the bricks before they were put in the kiln and is a measure of 
the wealth of the builder.

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
204
Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (from 11 a.m. Jan–
Mar). Admission is 5€ ($6.75) adults, 2€ ($2.70) students and chil-
dren 6 to 18.
 
7. The Willi-Brandt-Haus Lübeck, at Königstrasse 21, was the child-
hood home of Willi Brandt, former West German chancellor and 
Nobel Peace Prize winner; for information on visiting, see the side-
bar “Lübeck’s Nobel sons” earlier in this chapter.
 
8. At Glockengiesserstrasse 25, just to the south of the Museen 
Behnhaus/Drägerhaus, is the Füchtingshof, an almshouse built in 
the 17th century for the widows of seamen and merchants. Step 
through the ornamented baroque portal (open 9 a.m. to noon and 
3–6 p.m.) and you enter a tranquil courtyard with houses still occu-
pied by widows.
 
9. Next door, at Glockengiesser 21, you find the Günther Grass Haus 
museum; for information, see the sidebar “Lübeck’s Nobel sons” 
earlier in this chapter.
 
10. The Glandorps-Gang, at no. 41, and the Glandorps-Hof, at nos. 
49–51, are the city’s oldest almshouses, dating from 1612 and built 
for the widows of merchants and craftsmen.
 
11. A short distance to the north stands the Heiligen-Geist-Hospital 
(Hospital of the Holy Spirit), Am Koburg (% 0451/122-2040). This 
building, with its belfry and four turreted spires, is one of the 
oldest social-welfare institutions in Europe, and one of the most 
important monumental buildings of the Middle Ages. Philanthropic 
local citizens founded the hospital in 1230. In the early 19th cen-
tury, when the building was converted to a shelter for elderly 
men and women, 130 tiny wooden cabins without ceilings were 
built within its enormous main hall. The cabins remain intact, 
and you can poke your head inside them (free; open Tues–Sun 
10 a.m.–5 p.m.).
 
12. On the south side of town, you find Lübeck’s Dom (Cathedral), 
Mühlendamm 2–6 (% 0451/74704). Construction on this massive 
edifice began in 1173. The church was destroyed in World War II 
and later rebuilt. Except for its size, the church itself isn’t that 
interesting. The building is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 
13. Two blocks northeast of the Dom, the St.-Annen-Museum, St.-
Annen-Strasse 15 (% 0451/122-4137), is worth a stop. Housed in a 
16th-century Augustinian convent that was later used as an alms-
house and a prison, the museum has a noteworthy collection of 
medieval and Renaissance altarpieces, including a work by Hans 
Memling. You can see everything in about half an hour. The 
museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
(11 a.m.–5 p.m. Jan–Mar). Admission is 5€ ($6.75) adults, 2€ ($2.70) 
students and children 6 to 18.

 Chapter 13: Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck 205
 
14. To round off your tour of Lübeck, head over to the 750-year-old 
Petrikirche (St. Peter’s Church), Schmiedestrasse (% 0451/397-
330), and take the elevator up to the top of its tower for a memora-
ble view of Lübeck and its port. The tower is open daily from 9 a.m. 
to 7 p.m. (from 10 a.m. Oct–Mar). Admission is 3€ ($4.05) adults, 2€ 
($2.70) students and children ages 6 to 18.

S
axony and Thuringia are side-by-side Länder (states) in eastern 
Germany that are well worth visiting. (See the “Saxony and Thuringia” 
map in this chapter.) The cities of Dresden and Leipzig, with their out-
standing museums, historic buildings, and musical heritage, are the larg-
est cities in Saxony. Weimar, associated with Goethe (Germany’s greatest 
writer, author of Faust) and the German Enlightenment of the late 18th 
and early 19th centuries, is the cultural jewel in Thuringia’s crown.
Both states are rich in sightseeing possibilities. In Saxony, the mighty 
Elbe River flows through an area near Dresden known as Saxon 
Switzerland, famed for its river scenery. Thuringia is considered the 
“green heart” of Germany because the Thüringer Wald (Thuringian 
Forest) covers much of its southern portion. Narrow, winding roads lead 
through spruce-covered hills to unspoiled villages that waft you back to 
the Middle Ages.
Dresden: Florence on the Elbe
 Dresden, located 198km (123 miles) south of Berlin and 111km (69 miles) 
southeast of Leipzig, celebrated its 800th anniversary in 2006. Perhaps the 
most important celebratory event was the reopening of the famous domed 
Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady), destroyed in the bombings of World 
War II. The Frauenkirche is a symbol of what Dresden once was — a city 
known as “Florence on the Elbe,” and renowned for its architecture and 
art treasures — and hopes to become again. Dresden became the most 
important city in Saxony when the ruling Wettin Dynasty decided to make 
the city its capital in the late 15th century. Under the rule of Elector

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
208
Augustus the Strong, the preeminent personality in the town’s history, 
Dresden flourished as one of the great cultural centers of Europe.
Then came the night of February 13, 1945, when Allied firebombs 
destroyed three-quarters of Dresden’s Altstadt, the beautiful old core of 
the city. Historic buildings have since been rebuilt, but the work has 
taken decades. The reconstruction of the Frauenkirche, using original 
plans and even some of the original stone (bombed pieces of which were 
found in the Elbe), is the most ambitious reconstruction effort in the 
entire country and marks an important stage in Dresden’s recovery.
After reunification, Dresden emerged as the top contender for tourists in 
the former East Germany. Many visitors come just to visit the museums 
in the Zwinger Palace and to see the treasures of the Grünes Gewölbe 
(Green Vault), in the reopened portion of the Residenzschloss (Palace).
Getting there
Getting to Dresden is easy. This major city has an airport, frequent train 
service, and a good road network.
By plane
Flughafen Dresden (% 0351/881-3360; www.dresden-airport.de), 
the city airport, lies 9km (51⁄2 miles) north of the city center. Lufthansa 
and other international carriers provide regularly scheduled service 
between Dresden and cities throughout Germany and Europe. The 
easiest and least expensive way to get into the city center is by the S2 
S-Bahn (light rail), which runs from the airport to the two main train 
stations. The trip takes about 20 minutes and costs 1.80€ ($2.45). You 
can buy your ticket at the S-Bahn window in the underground station 
beneath the new terminal. A taxi from the airport to the center of 
Dresden costs about 17€ ($23).
By train
Getting to Dresden by train from anywhere in Germany or Europe is easy. 
More than a dozen trains make the daily trip from Berlin (2–21⁄2 hours) 
and Frankfurt (41⁄2 hours). For rail information and schedules, call 
Deutsche Bahn at % 11861 or go to www.bahn.de.
Dresden has two main rail stations. All long-distance trains pull into the 
Hauptbahnhof (main train station), on Wiener Platz on the south side 
of the Elbe, within walking distance of the Altstadt and nearly all of 
Dresden’s major attractions. Dresden-Neustadt, the station on the north 
side of the river, at Schlesischer Park, is used more for regional trains, 
although some trains, including the Airport S-Bahn, stop at both stations.
By car
The A13 autobahn connects Dresden to Berlin. The A4 comes in from 
Leipzig and Bavaria (eventually the A4 will connect Dresden to Prague).

Dresden: Florence on the Elbe

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
210
The highways run along the west side of the city. Four exits (Altstadt, 
Neustadt, Hellerau, and Wilder Mann) lead into the center. 
Finding information
At the Information Center, Prager Strasse (% 0351/491-92100; www.
dresden-tourist.de), near the main train station, you can book a 
hotel room and purchase a map of Dresden and information booklets 
in English. You also can buy theater, opera, or concert tickets. The 
same services are available at the Information Center located in the 
Schinkelwache (Old City Guard House), at Theaterplatz Square. The 
hours for both are Monday through Friday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday 10 
a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sunday (Schinkelwache only) 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
 
 The Dresden Card is good for 48 hours on all trams, buses, and ferries in 
Dresden and admission to all the top museums, including those in the 
Zwinger and the Albertinum. You also get reduced prices for other muse-
ums, city tours, and boat tours in the Dresden area. The cost is 21€ ($28). 
You can buy the Dresden Card at the tourist information centers.
Orienting yourself
The Elbe River divides Dresden more or less in half. On the south side, 
between the Hauptbahnhof (main train station) and the river, you find 
all the major cultural attractions, including art museums, the newly 
restored Frauenkirche, churches in the Altmarkt (Old Market) and 
Neumarkt (New Market) squares, the Zwinger Palace museums, and the 
Semper Opera House. Prager Strasse, a wide pedestrian street lined with 
shops, hotels, and restaurants, is the main thoroughfare (and site of the 
main tourist information office).
Dresden-Neustadt occupies the north side of the river. Pretty 19th-
century houses reconstructed to hold shops, apartments, and restau-
rants line Hauptstrasse and Königstrasse, its main streets. Germany’s 
reunification triggered a real estate and reconstruction boom in this pic-
turesque neighborhood of art galleries, boutiques, and cafes.
Getting around Dresden
If you plan to visit only the historic center of Dresden, you can easily get 
around on foot. The city’s transport authority, Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe 
(DVB; % 0351/857-1011; www.dvbag.de), maintains an extensive 
system of bus and tram lines within the city and far out into the sub-
urbs. Service is limited after midnight, but the major lines continue to 
operate every hour.
The city is divided into fare zones; unless you’re visiting the outskirts 
of Dresden, you only need a one-zone ticket. Purchase your tickets and 
a transportation map from the vending machines (marked fahrkarten) 
outside the train stations, or at DVB service centers inside the 
Hauptbahnhof or at Postplatz; both are open Monday through Friday 

 Chapter 14: Dresden, Leipzig, and Weimar: Jewels of the East 211
from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. A 
single ticket for the bus or tram costs 1.80€ ($2.45) for a one-hour ride 
anywhere in Zone 1. A one-day Tageskarte (day pass) costs 4.50€ ($6.10). 
A Familientageskarte (family day ticket), good for two adults and up to 
four children in one zone, costs 6€ ($8.10). Validate your ticket (by 
stamping the ticket in a machine) upon entering the bus or tram.
Seeing Dresden by guided tour
 
 Stadtrundfahrt Dresden (% 0351/899-5650; www.stadtrundfahrt.
com), offers a daily 90-minute Grosse Stadtrundfahrt (Super Dresden Tour), 
a guided (audio headsets for English translations) bus tour that leaves

Exploring Dresden
You find all of Dresden’s major attractions in the relatively compact 
Altstadt, the historic center.
The Neustadt quarter on the north bank of the Elbe is another area you 
may want to explore. Although you won’t find the museum attractions of 
the Altstadt here, the Neustadt quarter has Germany’s largest concen-
tration of houses from the Gründerzeit (Biedermeier; early 19th-century) 
period.
 
 A money-saving Tageskarte (day ticket) gets you into all four museums 
in the Zwinger complex, the Neues Grünes Gewölbe (Green Vault), and the 
Museum für Sächsische Volkskunst (all described in this section), for 12€ 
($16) adults, 7€ ($9.45) children and seniors, 25€ ($34) families. For more 
information on all of Dresden’s major museums, visit the Web site of the 
Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (State Art Collections) at www.skd-
dresden.de. The Dresden Card, described under “Finding Information,” 
earlier in this chapter, is another money-saving option that includes all 
public transportation as well as admission to museums.
Albertinum
Altstadt
Between 1884 and 1887, the Saxon King Albert converted this former royal 
arsenal into a home for his vast collection of art and precious jewelry. The 
Gemäldegalerie Neue Meister (New Masters Gallery), taking up two 
floors, is a rich collection of 19th- and 20th-century art. The collection 
concentrates on German art, starting with moody works by Caspar David 
Dinner with a view
For a fun, easy, and memorable dining experience, take one of Dresden’s old funicu-
lars (mountain railways) up to the top of a hill in the suburb of Loschwitz and dine in a 
pleasant restaurant overlooking the city. First, take tram no. 8 to Schillerplatz and walk 
across the famous Blaue Wunder bridge. On the other side, at Trachtenbergerstrasse 
40, you’ll see the Standseilbahn, a funicular that began operation in 1895. The funicu-
lar runs from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. and costs 3€ ($4.05) round-trip. Take the funicular to the 
top, a residential area called Weisser Hirsch. Across the street from the station is 
Luisenhof, Bergbahnstrasse 8 (% 0351/214-9960), a restaurant with an outdoor ter-
race offering wonderful panoramic views of the Elbe River and Dresden in the dis-
tance. The German/Saxon menu features traditional dishes such as potato soup with 
sausages, and Sauerbraten with cabbage and dumplings. Main courses go for 10€ to 
17€ ($14–$23). The service can be slow, but relax with a glass of beer or wine and 
enjoy the view of Dresden’s spires. The restaurant is open Monday through Saturday 
from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m., Sunday from 10 a.m. to midnight (brunch 10 a.m.–2 p.m.). The 
restaurant accepts MasterCard and Visa.

Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady)
Altstadt
Built between 1726 and 1743, the Frauenkirche on the southeast side of 
Neumarkt (New Market Square) was the most important Protestant 
church in Germany and had one of the most famous domes in Europe. The 
1945 Allied bombing of Dresden destroyed 80 percent of the city, including 
the Frauenkirche. After the war, the East German government let the 
charred ruin remain as a memorial. A painstaking restoration project 
began in 1993 and was finally completed in 2006. The reopening of the 
church was an event of major symbolic importance. The new golden cross 
atop the dome, an exact replica of the 18th-century original, was built by 
the son of a British bomber pilot who took part in the original bombing 
raid. Once again this baroque church dominates the historic center of 
Dresden; step inside the brilliant white interior to admire the immaculate 
restoration work. Even better, enjoy one of the 3 p.m. Sunday concerts 
(8€/$11); for performance information, see the Web site.

 Grünes Gewölbe (Green Vault)
Altstadt
The fabulous assortment of treasures displayed in the Residenzschloss 
were once part of King Albert’s art collection and were moved from the 
Albertinum to these new galleries in 2004. Two collections are open for 
viewing, each requiring a separate admission. The Neues Grünes Gewölbe 
(New Green Vault) features ten rooms of selected masterworks from the 
huge collection of 16th- to 18th-century objects, including rococo chests, 
ivory carvings, gold jewelry, bronze statuettes, intricately designed mir-
rors, and priceless porcelain. Allow yourself at least an hour to browse 
this treasure-trove (be prepared for crowds), and take advantage of the 
free audio guide.
Unless you’re an objet d’art nut, this dazzling selection of highlights will 
more than satisfy your curiosity. But there’s more, if you want it. In 
September 2006, the Historisches Grünes Gewölbe (Historic Green Vault)

Katholische Hofkirche (Catholic Court Church)
Altstadt
The restored Hofkirche, also known as the Cathedral of St. Trinitas, is the 
largest church in Saxony. Built by the son of Augustus the Strong, 
Frederick Augustus II (ruled 1733–1763), the church was constructed in a 
lavish Italian baroque style with a curving facade and 86m (282-ft.) bell 
tower decorated with statues of saints and apostles. Inside, you can see 
the crypt with the tombs of 49 kings and princes of Saxony. You need 
about 15 minutes to look around.

Saxon Arts and Crafts)
Neustadt
The oldest Renaissance building in Dresden, the 16th-century Jägerhof 
(Hunters Court) houses this fine collection of regional folk art. What you 
see are everyday objects used by the common folk — a far cry from the 
gem-encrusted treasures in the Grünes Gewölbe (Green Vault, described 
earlier). On display are pieces of painted furniture, hand-woven baskets, 
pottery, tableware, and folk costumes. Also shown are toys, carvings, and 
Christmas decorations from the nearby Erzgebirge region.

 Zwinger
Altstadt
Augustus the Strong, elector of Saxony and king of Poland, built this mag-
nificent baroque palace in 1719. He wanted the Zwinger to be his Versailles 
and a place where he could show off his incredible art collections. The 
architect, M. D. Pöppelmann (1662–1736), designed a series of galleries 
and domed pavilions to enclose a large rectangular courtyard with formal 
gardens, fountains, and promenades. The semicircular Wallpavillon at 
the west end and the adjacent Nymphenbad (Bath of Nymphs), with its 

 Chapter 14: Dresden, Leipzig, and Weimar: Jewels of the East 219
graceful fountains and mythological figures, are notable buildings that 
rely on the exuberant sculptures of the Bavarian artist Balthasar Permoser 
(1651–1732). On the northeast side is the Semper Gallery, a Renaissance-
style two-story pavilion linked by one-story galleries; Gottfried Semper 
added the pavilion in 1846. Today, this entire complex of buildings 
contains a stunning collection of museums. They all are open the same 
hours — Tuesday through Sunday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. — but charge separate 
admission prices. If you’re going to visit more than one museum here, you 
save money with a Tageskarte (day ticket), good for all Zwinger muse-
ums, the Green Vault, and the Museum of Saxon Arts and Crafts; it costs 
12€ ($16) adults, 25€ ($34) families.
The most important museum is the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (Old 
Masters Gallery) in the Semper Gallery (entrance at Theaterplatz 1). This 
gallery, one of the best in the world, has as its showpiece Raphael’s Sistine 
Madonna. The collection also includes Flemish, Dutch, and German paint-
ings by van Dyck, Vermeer, Dürer, Rubens, and Rembrandt. In galleries 2 
through 4, you find a series of detailed townscapes of Dresden painted by

Christmas market in Germany. This December event, which began in 
1434, takes place in the Altmarkt and features handmade regional crafts 
and gift items and homemade foods. Look for woodcarvings from the 
Erzgebirge Mountains, indigo-printed cloth and pottery from Lusatia, 
gingerbread from Pulsnitz, filigree lace from Plauen, Advent stars from 
Hermhut, and blown-glass tree decorations from Lauscha.
Discovering nightlife in Dresden
Dresden is the cultural center of Saxony, so many and varied nightlife 
options always are available. Depending on your tastes, you can find 
classical concerts, rock shows, discos, or just a good place to relax with 
a glass of wine or a beer.
 
 Tickets for classical concerts, dance, and opera are available from the 
tourist information centers on Prager Strasse and Theaterplatz.
Opera and classical concerts
 
 The Semperoper (Semper Opera House), Theaterplatz 2 (% 0351/491-
1705; www.semperoper.de; Tram: 4 or 8), is one of the world’s great 
opera houses. Several operas by Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss had 
their premieres in this house, which was built in the mid 19th century and 
twice rebuilt. If you’re an opera buff, seeing a performance by the resident 
company, the Sächsisches Oper (Saxon Opera), can be a highlight of your 
trip. The opera and ballet season lasts from September to mid-July.
The Dresden Philharmonic performs at the Kulturpalast, in the 
Altmarkt (% 0351/48660; www.dresdnerphilharmonie.de; Tram: 3 
or 5). Summer concerts take place in the courtyards of the Zwinger.
The main stage for classical theater in the city is the Schauspielhaus, 
Postplatz (% 0351/491-350; Tram 1, 2, 4, or 7), where actors perform 
dramas by Goethe, Schiller, and Shakespeare. The theater is closed 
during August.
Bars and clubs
Café Hieronymous, Louisenstrasse 10 (% 0351/801-1739; Tram: 7 or 8), 
a small, low-key bar without intrusive music, is open daily from 7 p.m. to 
2 a.m. Die 100, Alaunstrasse 100 (% 0351/801-3957; Tram: 7, 8, or 11), 
is a trendy drinking place set in a cellar and popular with students and 
artists; open daily from 5 p.m. to 3 a.m.

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
222
The upstairs cafe at Planwirtschaft, Louisenstrasse 20 (% 0351/801-
3187; Tram: 7 or 8), is open from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m.; the downstairs bar 
stays open until 3 a.m. on weekends. Although it doesn’t look like much, 
Raskolnikoff, Böhmische Strasse 34 (% 0351/804-5706; Tram: 3, 5, 7, 8, 
or 11), is a hip dive with sand-covered floors. The place is open Monday 
through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m., Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. 
to 2 a.m.
A dance club with room for everyone is DownTown and Groove Station, 
Katherinenstrasse 11–13 (% 0351/802-8801; Tram: 7 or 8). Monday is 
gay and lesbian night, and on Sunday there’s dinner and dancing. The 
club is open daily from 9 p.m. until the last person leaves. Cover is 4€ 
($5.40).
Leipzig: City of Heroes
Historic Leipzig, located at the confluence of the Weisse Elster and 
Pleisse rivers, is called a Heldenstadt, or “City of Heroes,” for its role in 
toppling the former Communist government of East Germany. Visiting 
Leipzig is worth the trip to see a proud East German city rediscovering 
and redefining itself after years of Communist rule. (See the “Leipzig” 
map in this chapter.)
With a population of about 450,000 people, Leipzig is only a little smaller 
than Dresden. Leipzig has long been a major cultural and commercial 
force in Saxony, a center of publishing, and home to a famous university 
with some 20,000 students. For centuries, trade fairs have played an 
important role in the city’s life. Leipzig also is a city with many great 
musical traditions, including the famed Gewandhaus Orchestra. Johann 
Sebastian Bach is closely associated with Leipzig, Mozart and Mendels-
sohn performed here, and Richard Wagner was born in Leipzig in 1813.
Sailing through Saxon Switzerland
If you have the time, I recommend that you take a boat trip along the Elbe River. The 
Sächsische Dampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft (Saxon Excursion Boat Company; % 0351/
866-090) runs several trips on historic paddle-wheelers and modern boats through a 
scenic region known as Sächsisches Schweiz (Saxon Switzerland), where you see 
castle-crowned hilltops, giant rocks, deep gorges, and sheer sandstone cliffs. Other 
routes travel to Meissen and through Bohemia. Elbe cruises leave from the dock 
below Brühl Terrace, the esplanade that runs along the south bank of the river. From 
May into October, daily excursions depart for the Saxon Switzerland route. The round-
trip cost is 21€ ($28) per person. The trips take from 3 to 41⁄2 hours. Food and drink are 
sold onboard. You can check out all the Elbe excursions, in English, online at www.
saechsische-dampfschiffahrt.de.

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
224
Leipzig was heavily bombed by British and American forces in 1943, and 
much of the city is rebuilt. You still find some narrow streets and houses 
dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries, and some Jugendstil (Art 
Nouveau) buildings and arcades from the early 20th century. But people 
in Leipzig are much more interested in looking forward than looking 
back, and its skyscrapers and nightlife give the city a cosmopolitan flair 
that’s unique for this region.
You can easily visit Leipzig as a day trip from Dresden, 111km (68 miles) 
to the northwest, or you may want to spend the night in this lively Saxon 
metropolis.
Getting there
Leipzig has all the transportation options of a major city: an airport, a 
train station, and a good road network. You can easily get there from 
anywhere in Germany or the rest of Europe.
By plane
Several airlines link Leipzig to major German cities, such as Munich 
and Frankfurt, and to other European destinations. Leipzig-Halle 
International Airport (% 0341/224-1155; www.leipzig-airport.de) 
lies 11km (7 miles) northwest of the city center. The Flughafen (Airport) 
Express train runs between the airport and the Leipzig Hauptbahnhof 
(main train station) every 30 minutes from 4:30 a.m. to midnight; trip 
time is 14 minutes. The fare is 8€ ($11). The 25- to 30-minute taxi ride to 
the city center costs about 30€ ($41).
By train
The Leipzig Hauptbahnhof (main train station), Willy-Brandt-Platz, is 
the largest on the Continent. Trains arrive daily from Berlin (21⁄2 hours), 
Dresden (11⁄2–2 hours), and Frankfurt (5 hours). For information and train 
schedules, call Deutsche Bahn at % 11861 or go to www.bahn.de. The 
recently restored Hauptbahnhof is one of the most happening places in 
Leipzig, a new commercial flash point for cafes, shops, and restaurants.
By car
Leipzig is connected to the A9 (Berlin–Munich) and the A14 (Halle–
Dresden) autobahns. A number of federal highways (B2, B6, B87, B95, 
B181, B184) pass by or skirt Leipzig.
Finding information and taking a tour
Pick up a city map at the tourist information office, Richard-Wagner-Strasse 1 
(% 0341/710-4265; www.leipzig.de), open Monday through Friday from 
9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sunday 9:30 a.m. to 
3 p.m. (Nov–Mar the office opens at 10 a.m.). You can also book a hotel 
room here and purchase tickets for concerts and sightseeing tours.

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
226
The tourist office offers a 90-minute city-sightseeing tour daily at 11 a.m. 
for 12€ ($16). The commentary is in German only.
Getting around Leipzig
If you arrive by train for a day trip, you can easily walk from the train 
station to all the attractions in the Altstadt. LVB (% 0172/100-0000; 
www.lvb.de), the public transit authority, runs the city’s tram, S-Bahn 
(surface trains), and bus network. Fares are based on zones. An 
Einzelfahrkarte (single ticket) in “Zone Leipzig” (all of central Leipzig) 
costs 1.90€ ($2.60). You can purchase tickets from automated machines 
at the stops.
Staying in Leipzig
 
 Twice a year, usually the first week in September and the second week in 
March, Leipzig is the site of huge trade fairs that bring in tens of thou-
sands of visitors. If you travel to Leipzig during those periods, booking 
your room in advance is essential.
Hotel Fürstenhof
$$$$ City Center
Housed in a historic 18th-century building, this distinctive luxury hotel 
has 92 rooms redecorated to reflect the original neoclassical styling. The 
rejuvenated rooms are lovely and comfortable; each has a bathroom with 
a combination tub and shower. An on-site health club features a pool and 
sauna. The sumptuous breakfast buffet costs an additional 24€ ($32).

Leipzig Marriott Hotel
$–$$$ City Center
Fans of Marriott hotels won’t find any surprises in this one, but that’s the 
point. The Leipzig Marriott is a good, reliable choice for leisure or busi-
ness travelers. (It tends to attract more business travelers because of the 
array of amenities and executive-level services it offers.) Rooms are com-
fortable and good-size (with beds that beat the Westin’s for comfort), and 
the bathrooms all have tub/shower combinations. The lobby was remod-
eled and all the rooms freshened up in 2007 (the hotel’s tenth anniver-
sary). The friendly, helpful service here is a real recommendation; the 
location, within easy walking distance of the train station and just across 
from the new Museum der Bildenden Künste (Museum of Fine Arts), is a 
major plus; and the breakfast buffet is great.

The Westin Leipzig
$$$–$$$$ City Center
One of the city’s tallest buildings, and one of its finest modern hotels, the 
27-story Westin reflects the Leipzig of today. Westin took over the GDR-era 
building in 2003 and began redecorating the 447 rooms in a sleek, contem-
porary style. The rooms are comfortable but not particularly large; many 
have panoramic views of the city; all have decent-size bathrooms with 
tub/shower combinations. This full-service hotel contains a health club, 
pool, and sauna, and has room service. The restaurant Brühl serves tra-
ditional German food, while Yamato is one of the best places in Leipzig for 
Japanese food. The hotel is a convenient five-minute walk from the train 
station, and within easy walking distance of all the sights in the Altstadt.

Dining in Leipzig
More restaurants are opening in Leipzig all the time, but this city is not 
particularly well known for its culinary scene. Regional cooking favors 
hearty portions and simple, filling ingredients.
Apels Garten
$–$$ Near Altstadt GERMAN/SAXON
This restaurant, in a quiet Leipzig neighborhood close to the Altstadt, is 
known for its home-style German food. Specialties include Saxon potato 
soup with Wurst, roast duck with arugula, and pork steaks. Although more 
robust than refined, the cuisine is good, with some “newer” dishes on the 
menu, and excellent fixed-price menus. The décor is nostalgically old-
fashioned. You can dine out on the porch in warm weather. The restau-
rant is named after one of the old pleasure gardens that used to adorn 
Leipzig.
See map p. 223. Kolonnadenstrasse 2. % 0341/960-7777. Reservations recom-

19€–25€ ($25–$34). AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–11 p.m., Sun 11 a.m.–3:30 p.m.
 Auerbachs Keller
$–$$ Altstadt SAXON/INTERNATIONAL
A group of sculpted bronze characters from Goethe’s play Faust adorns 
the staircase leading down to this famous medieval cellar restaurant 
where Goethe had Faust debate Mephistopheles. Guests have a choice of 
the Historic Rooms (dinner only) or the Big Room (lunch and dinner), with 
its painted ceiling. The menu features regional cuisine of Saxony, such as 
warmes Bratenneckchen (roasted pork on brown bread with a pepper dip), 
along with a selection of international dishes. Kids enjoy the underground 
atmosphere and usually can find something on the menu to their liking.

Paulaner Palais
$ Altstadt GERMAN/BAVARIAN/AUSTRIAN
This large, popular restaurant, housed in an 18th-century rococo building, 
has a restaurant and a more casual pub section, each offering the same 
menu. The summer courtyard within the building is the nicest place to 
dine. The menu emphasizes boiled meats such as Tafelspitz (beef) with 
sauces, but you can also get Saxon Sauerbraten, Weisswurst (steamed pork 
sausage) from Munich, or Rostbratwurst (roasted sausages) from 
Nuremberg. The only beer served here is the Munich-brewed Paulaner 
Bier.

Exploring Leipzig
Bombing in 1943 destroyed about one-quarter of Leipzig. The city has 
placed more of an emphasis on constructing the new than on restoring 
the old. Most of the old and the new Leipzig that has appeal for visitors 
is concentrated in the Zentrum (City Center), a small, easily walked area 
south of the Hauptbahnhof (main train station).
Remnants of old Leipzig have been reconstructed around the Markt, the 
city’s best-known square. On the east side of the square is the long, 
gabled, Renaissance Altes Rathaus (Old Town Hall). Reconstructed on 
the north side of the square is the step-gabled Renaissance Alte Waage 
(Old Weighing House). Across from this house, on the south side of the 
square, is the Königshaus (King’s House), once used by the rulers of 
Saxony as a royal guesthouse. (Peter the Great of Russia and Napoleon 
also stayed there.) In the neighboring Naschmarkt, behind a statue of 
Goethe as a student, stands the yellow-and-white Alte Börse (Old 
Produce Exchange), with curving stairs and stucco garlands above the 
windows; completed in 1687, the Alte Börse was the first baroque build-
ing in Leipzig. To the south of Marktplatz is the Mädlerpassage, a 
famous arcade of shops and restaurants, home of Auerbachs Keller (see 
“Dining in Leipzig” earlier in this chapter). A short walk leads to the 
pastel baroque houses along Katharinenstrasse and the Brühl. Just east 
of the Marktplatz is the 12th-century Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas 
Church), where demonstrators for democracy gathered in 1989. To the 
west rises the high-pitched roof of the 1,000-year-old Thomaskirche (St. 
Thomas Church), where Bach served as choirmaster for 27 years. The 
Universität Leipzig (Leipzig University) occupies the area south of 
Grimmaisch-Strasse.

 Chapter 14: Dresden, Leipzig, and Weimar: Jewels of the East 229
Augustus-Platz, to the east of the Nikolaikirche and the university, 
serves as the cultural heart of modern Leipzig. The opera house occu-
pies the north side of the square; the Neues Gewandhaus concert hall 
stands on the south.
Bach-Museum
This reconstructed house standing in the shadow of the Thomaskirche 
once was home to the Bose family, friends of J. S. Bach. The house (closed 
for renovation until early 2010) contains the largest Bach archive in 
Germany. Many mementos of the composer, including scores and letters, 
are on display. You can see (and hear) everything in this small museum in 
about half an hour; if you love Bach, you’ll be tempted to linger. An excel-
lent audio-guide in English is available. New admission prices and opening 
hours for the renovated house/museum were not available at press time.
See map p. 223. Thomaskirchhof 16. % 0341/964-4133. www.bach-leipzig.de. 
Tram: 21. Call for admission prices and hours.
Grassi Museum
Completed in 1929, the Grassi Museum, on Johannis-Platz just east of the 
Zentrum, houses Leipzig’s arts and crafts, ethnography, and musical 
instruments collections. After years of restoration, the three museums in 
the Grassi complex are once again together in one building. All of the 
exhibit descriptions are in English as well as German.
 
✓ The Museum für Angewandte Kunst (Applied Arts Museum; % 0341/
222-9100) displays an array of handmade objects from the Middle 
Ages up to the early 20th century. You find beautiful examples of 
furniture, porcelain, and glassware. Look for the extremely rare, 
jointed doll dating from 1526.
Bach in Leipzig
The composer Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750) is Leipzig’s most famous citizen. 
He came to Leipzig at the age of 38 to be choirmaster and director of the Thomaskirche’s 
boys’ choir and director of music at Leipzig University, and stayed for the rest of his 
life. Interestingly, Bach was not the town councilors’ first choice for this position but 
the fourth, and he was asked to come to Leipzig only after the first three candidates 
turned down the job. In Leipzig, Bach wrote more than 200 cantatas, the Passion 
According to St. Matthew, and the Mass in B Minor. Bach was the father of no fewer 
than 17 children (4 by his first wife; 13 with his second). Three of his sons, Carl Philipp 
Emanuel, Johann Christian, and Wilhelm Friedemann, also became composers. Every 
June, Leipzig celebrates Bach’s musical legacy with the famous Bachfest (% 0341/
913-7333; www.bach-leipzig.de), during which Bach’s works are performed in 
the Thomaskirche and other venues around town.

Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
Museum der Bildenden Künste (Museum of Fine Arts)
In late 2005, 61 years to the day after its original home was destroyed by a 
bomb in World War II, one of Germany’s most important art collections 
reopened in a new $100-million glass-and-steel, cube-shaped building on 
Sachsenplatz. Founded in 1837, Leipzig’s Museum of Fine Arts is especially 
strong in German painting of the 19th century (including works by that quint-
essential Romantic, Caspar David Friedrich), but it also displays Dutch and 
Flemish art of the 17th century (including a lively Frans Hals), European art 
of the 15th and 16th centuries, and contemporary works. The new building 
is a serenely handsome affair; allow at least an hour to stroll through. A nice 
little cafe is located on the premises (open the same hours as the museum).
See map p. 223. Katharinenstrasse 101 (on Sachsenplatz). % 0341/21-69-90. www.
mdbk.de. Bus: 8. Tram: 3. Admission: 5€ ($6.75) adults, 3.50€ ($4.70) children and 
students; free on second Sun of the month. Open: Tues and Thurs–Sun 10 a.m.–6 
p.m., Wed noon to 8 p.m.
Museum in der Runden Ecke (Stasi Museum)
This chillingly fascinating museum is housed in the building that once was 
the headquarters of the dreaded Stasi (short for Staatssicherheit, or “state 
security”), the East German Ministry for State Security. An exhibition 
called “The Power and Banality of the East German Secret Police” docu-
ments the meticulous and paranoid methods by which Stasi agents moni-
tored every exchange of information in East Germany, confiscating private 
letters and listening in on phone conversations. On the nights of December 
4 and 5, 1989, local citizens took a giant step toward toppling the govern-
ment of East Germany when they seized this building. You may want to 
spend a few minutes here, but be aware that none of the exhibits is trans-
lated into English.

Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas Church)
The present church was built in the 16th century and has a white, neoclas-
sical interior. On this site in 1989, a group of 10,000 demonstrators 

 Chapter 14: Dresden, Leipzig, and Weimar: Jewels of the East 231
gathered with candles and began the peaceful revolution that toppled the 
GDR, East Germany’s Communist government. The movement started as 
a prayer group in the Nikolaikirche in 1982.

Free. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m.
Thomaskirche (St. Thomas Church)
Leipzig’s most famous resident, Johann Sebastian Bach, was choirmaster 
in this church from 1723 until his death 27 years later. His body was 
moved here in 1950 on the 200th anniversary of his death and reburied in 
front of the altar. Bach wrote his great cantatas for the Thomanerchor, the 
church’s famous boys’ choir, first organized in the 13th century. Both 
Mozart and Mendelssohn also performed in the Thomaskirche, and 
Richard Wagner was christened here in 1813. The church was built on the 
site of a 13th-century monastery and was heavily restored after World War 
II and again after reunification. Its high-pitched roof dates from 1496. 
When it isn’t touring, the choir presents concerts every Sunday morning 
and Friday evening.

6, 8, 10, 11, or 13. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.
Zeitgeschichtliches Forum Leipzig (Contemporary History Forum)
I recommend that anyone traveling to Leipzig visit this free multimedia 
exhibition, which opened in 2002. Described as a place of “living remem-
brance,” the exhibit may help you better understand contemporary 
German history, what life was like in Communist East Germany, and the 
events that triggered the fall of the GDR. Set up chronologically, the 
exhibit uses photos, documents, newsreels, audio, and memorabilia to 
guide you through the tumultuous last half-century in eastern Germany. 
Give yourself at least an hour.
See map p. 223. Grimmaische Strasse 6. % 0341/22200. Tram: 2, 4, 6, or 8. Admission: 
Free. Open: Tues–Fri 9 a.m.–6 p.m., Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
Shopping in Leipzig
Exploring the handsomely restored Art Nouveau Arkaden (arcades) 
that thread through the historic core of Leipzig is fun. Mädlerpassage is 
Leipzig’s finest arcade, lined with chic, sophisticated, expensive boutiques.
The Naschmarkt, open Monday through Saturday, is a lively, centrally 
located outdoor market that sells vegetables, plants, cheeses, meats, 
and a bit of everything.
Leipzig’s Hauptbahnhof (main train station) recently was transformed 
into a giant shopping mall, with about 140 shops and cafes that open 
between 6:30 and 9 a.m. and close at 10 p.m. on weekdays and 4 p.m. on 
Saturday.

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany 
232
Open daily in December in front of the Altes Rathaus, Leipzig’s 
Weihnachtsmarkt (Christmas Market) is a tradition dating back to 1767. 
Stalls (open daily 10 a.m.–8 p.m.) sell a variety of craft items and 
Christmas food and drink. Special organ concerts and performances of 
Bach’s Christmas Oratorio and Handel’s Messiah also take place.
Discovering nightlife in Leipzig
Leipzig’s active nightlife offers something for everyone, from opera and 
classical concerts to late-night bars and discos. The area around the 
Markt is full of bars, cafes, and other entertainment options. For a sam-
pling of lively cafes, walk down Barfüssergässchen, just south of the 
Altes Rathaus.
 
 The Neues Gewandhaus, Augustusplatz (% 0341/127-0280; www.
gewandhaus.de; Tram: 4, 5, 12, 13, or 15), a concert hall built in 1981, is 
the home of the world-famous Gewandhaus Orchestra. Founded in 1781, 
the orchestra premiered works by Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Schubert, 
and Brahms. Attending a concert by this great orchestra is a special treat, 
and it’s a good idea to reserve your seats in advance. Ticket prices range 
from 11€ to 50€ ($15–$67).
The Leipzieger Oper (Leipzig Opera) is one of Germany’s most acclaimed 
opera companies. Its home is the Opernhaus, Augustusplatz 8 (% 0341/
126-1261; http://oper-leipzig.de; Tram: 4, 5, 12, 13, or 15), oppo-
site the Neues Gewandhaus. Ticket prices for opera and ballet range 
from 12€ to 75€ ($16–$101).
Leipzig’s main theater, the Schauspielhaus, Bosestrasse 1 (% 0341/
12680; Tram: 1, 2, 4, 6, 15, 17, 21, or 24), is home to several arts compa-
nies that stage a mix of theatrical and musical productions in German. 
Ticket prices range from 10€ to 30€ ($14–$41).
Mephisto Bar, Mädlerpassage (% 0341/216-100; Tram: 4 or 6), which 
honors Goethe and the Faust legend, is one of the hippest bar/cafes in 
Leipzig, great for people-watching. Live music is performed Thursday 
through Saturday, beginning around 8 p.m.
Weimar: Capital of the Enlightenment
Beautiful Weimar (vye-mar), a 1,000-year-old town that once was a center 
of the German Enlightenment, is one of Germany’s greatest cultural 
shrines. Some of the country’s most revered painters, writers, and com-
posers made their homes in this small Thuringian town on the River Ilm, 
or spent portions of their creative lives here. Goethe, considered 
Germany’s greatest literary genius, lived and worked in Weimar for 50 
years. Weimar also is famous in the history of Germany, because the 
German national assembly met here in 1919 to draw up the constitution 
for the ill-fated Weimar Republic, Germany’s first democratic govern-
ment after World War I. The town is well known to architecture buffs

because the first Bauhaus School of Art and Design was founded here in 
1919. During World War II, the Nazis established the concentration camp 
Buchenwald on the outskirts of this city.
Weimar is a joy to explore, in part because its old winding streets are 
sprinkled with the homes (now museums) of famous figures. Unlike 
Dresden and Leipzig, Weimar was not completely destroyed by bombs 
in World War II. Enough of old Weimar remains to give you a good sense 
of what the town was like when Goethe lived here. Weimar is an easy 
day trip from Leipzig or Dresden, but you may want to spend the night 
in this small, lovely, historically resonant city of 62,000 people.
Getting there
Weimar lies 262km (162 miles) southwest of Berlin, 118km (74 miles) 
southwest of Leipzig, and 215km (134 miles) southwest of Dresden. 
Good train connections to Weimar’s Hauptbahnhof (main train station) 
are available from anywhere in Germany. Fast InterCity Express (ICE) 
trains run from Frankfurt, Leipzig, and Dresden, and Weimar is a stop on 
the InterRegio express train between Frankfurt and Berlin. For rail infor-
mation and schedules, call % 11861 or visit the Deutsche Bahn Web site 
(www.bahn.de).
By car, you can reach Weimar via the A4 autobahn linking Frankfurt and 
Dresden, or the A9 autobahn between Berlin and Munich, turning off at 
Hermsdorfer Kreuz for Weimar.
Finding information and taking a tour
Tourist-Information am Markt, Markt 10 (% 03643/7450; www.weimar.
de), in the town’s central marketplace, is open Monday through Saturday 
from 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. (until 6 p.m. Nov–Mar), and Sunday from 9:30 
a.m. to 3 p.m. (until 2 p.m. Nov–Mar). Takt, the local entertainment list-
ings magazine, is available free. A second tourist information office is 
located at Friedenstrasse 1 (same phone and hours apply.
The tourist office offers a two-hour walking tour (in German) of Weimar 
April through October daily at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., November through 
March daily at 11 a.m. The meeting point is the tourist information 
office; the price is 7€ ($9.45) adults, 4€ ($5.40) students, free for children 
13 and under. Buy tickets at the tourist office. If you want a walking tour 
of Weimar with Goethe and Schiller as your guides, rent an I-Guide from 
the tourist information office (7€/$9.45 for 2 hours); this handheld 
device with earphones has commentary in English. The Belvedere 
Express, a two-hour bus tour of Weimar’s main sights on a replica 1925 
city bus, leaves three times a day from Market Square and costs 18€ 
($24) adults, free for children 11 and under.
Staying in Weimar
Since reunification, new hotels have opened throughout Weimar, often 
in historic buildings. The tourist offices listed earlier under “Finding

sion; or call the accommodations hot line at % 03643/745-435.
 
 Hotel Elephant Weimar
$$$–$$$$ City Center
The Hotel Elephant is Weimar’s best and most famous hotel, with a past 
guest roster that includes Bach, Tolstoy, Thomas Mann, even Hitler (the 
wing he dedicated now showcases a work by Otto Dix, one of the artists 
whose works he banned). The elegant late 17th-century facade, fronting 
Weimar’s picturesque marketplace, hides a coolly stylish interior adorned 
with a surprising collection of original contemporary artwork (there’s 
even a gallery on the premises showing works by artists currently working 
in Weimar) and furniture that gives the public rooms a classic 1930s “mod-
erne” look. The 99 rooms come in different sizes but are furnished basi-
cally the same, with pear-wood Biedermeier-style furniture. Bathrooms 
are large; most have a tub/shower combination. The Michelin-starred res-
taurant Anna Amalia (see “Dining in Weimar,” later in this chapter) is one 
of the best in the region, and the hotel bar a great place for a cocktail. The 
lavish breakfast buffet costs an additional 18€ ($24). You won’t find a 
better hotel in a more central location anywhere in Weimar.

 Hotel Kaiserin Augusta

This good, convenient, moderately priced hotel sits right across the street 
from the train station. The 134 rooms are neither large nor luxurious, but 
they are fully equipped, comfortable, and very well maintained. Bathrooms 
are small and have showers only. The staff is friendly, and the buffet 
breakfast is good.

Dining in Weimar
As with Leipzig, Weimar is not a city renowned for its culinary past. 
Since reunification, however, some new restaurants with savvier cooking 
and better ingredients have opened.
 
 Anna Amalia
$$$ City Center INTERNATIONAL
One of two restaurants located in the Hotel Elephant, Anna Amalia is 
modern and airy, a dress-up sort of place with beautifully set tables, a 
garden terrace, exemplary service, and a Michelin star (the only one in all 

Part III: Northern and Eastern Germany

of Thuringia). Its Italian dishes, the best in the region, make use of local 
produce and ingredients.
See map p. 233. Am Markt 19. % 03643/802-639. Reservations recommended. Bus: 10, 
11, or 71. Main courses: 19€–36€ ($26–$49). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Tues–Sat 6:30–11:30 p.m.
Elephantenkeller
$–$$ City Center GERMAN
Down one flight of steps from Anna Amalia in the Hotel Elephant is the 
historic Elephantenkeller (Elephant Cellar), a place for casual dining in a 
rustic atmosphere. In October, when Weimar’s famous Zwiebelmarkt 
(onion market) is open (a tradition dating back to 1653), this restaurant 
serves specialty onion salads. Otherwise, try local specialties such as 
sweet-and-sour Thuringian pot roast with dumplings or Thuringian-style 
grilled bratwurst on sauerkraut with puréed peas.

6€–18€ ($8.10–$24). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–11 p.m.
Gasthaus Scharfe Ecke
$–$$ Altstadt THURINGIAN
This little corner restaurant in a 300-year-old building in the Altstadt has a 
long tradition of serving traditional Thuringian specialties. You won’t find 
many tourists here because it’s slightly off the beaten track and fre-
quented by locals who come to savor the restaurant’s famous handmade 
Klossen (potato dumplings), which accompany many of the dishes or can 
be ordered separately. Look for unique regional and seasonal dishes such 
as pork and onion goulash with sauerkraut, wild-game goulash with red 
cabbage, or roast goose. The service is warm and friendly; most of the 
dishes are available in kleiner portion (smaller portions).

11 a.m.–10 p.m.
Zum Schwarzen Bären
$–$$ City Center THURINGIAN
Located next door to the Hotel Elephant, this restaurant is Weimar’s 
oldest. Nothing is fancy about it, but you can get a good, hefty meal for a 
reasonable cost. Dishes include potato soup with sausage, rump steak, 
Schnitzel with potatoes, and pork medallions with Gorgonzola sauce.

Exploring Weimar
Weimar enjoys a scenic location on the Ilm River, set against the back-
drop of the Ettersberg and Vogtland hills. The Altstadt, with its large 
park, has many historic sights, all of which you can easily see on foot. 
Markt, the town’s main square, remains the lively heart of the Old City. 
Surrounding the Altstadt is the newer Weimar, with broad, tree-lined 
boulevards and many 19th-century buildings.
Bauhaus-Museum
The focus of this museum is the Bauhaus movement, which was founded 
in Weimar in 1919 and sought to unify arts and crafts within the context 
of architecture. The collection of Bauhaus memorabilia includes rugs, 
architectural drawings, furniture, tea sets, and toys collected by the 
school’s director, the architect Walter Gropius. One room showcases the 
work of Henry van de Velde, an important architect-designer of Art 
Nouveau. The museum is fairly compact, so you can see everything in 
about half an hour. After closing for a complete renovation, the museum 
is set to reopen in April 2009 to coincide with the 90th anniversary of the 
founding of the Bauhaus school.
See map p. 233. Theaterplatz. % 03643/564-161. www.weimar-tourist.de. 
Bus: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7. Admission: 4.50€ ($6.10) adults, 3.50€ ($4.75) seniors and stu-
dents. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.
Goethe and the court of Weimar
In 1775, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832) was invited to the duchy of Weimar 
by the teenaged Duke Karl August. Goethe’s fame rested on the novel The Sorrows of 
Young Werther, which had become a sensation throughout Europe for its depiction of 
a suffering, suicidal artist. Duke Karl, Goethe’s patron, wanted to surround himself 
with clever, entertaining people. His mother, Duchess Anna Amalia, set the tone for 
the salons, which were referred to as the “Court of the Muses.” Thanks to Goethe and 
his friends, particularly the playwright Friedrich Schiller, the little duchy of Weimar 
gained renown as a center of the German Erklärung (Enlightenment), which brought 
a new, classically inspired rationalism to German art and literature. In Weimar, Goethe 
wrote the play Faust, the work for which he is most famous.

Goethes Gartenhaus (Goethe’s Garden House)
This simple stone cottage with a high-pitched roof, located in the bucolic 
park on the Ilm River, was Goethe’s first residence when he came to 
Weimar in 1775 as a guest of Duke Karl August. Throughout his life, Goethe 
used the house as a summer retreat. The structure was built as a garden 
house in the 16th century, enlarged in the 17th century, and reconstructed 
in 1996 according to the plans of 1820. You can see the interior, which has 
a few pieces of period furniture, in less than 15 minutes.

3.50€ ($4.75) adults, 2.50€ ($3.40) students and children. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
Goethes Wohnhaus (Goethe House) and Goethe Nationalmuseum
The large baroque house where Goethe lived from 1782 to 1832 is Weimar’s 
most popular attraction. When Goethe returned from Italy, overflowing with 
enthusiasm for all things Italian, he replaced the baroque staircase 
with broad stairs in the style of the Italian Renaissance, filled the house with 
casts of ancient busts and statues, and designed special cabinets to display 
his Italian majolica plates. Believing that colors affect mood, Goethe had his 
dining room painted a sunny yellow, his study a soothing green, and his 
reception room a calming blue. The house has 14 rooms, some of them 
pretty much as Goethe and his wife, Christiane, left them. Goethe died in his 
sparsely furnished bedchamber on March 22, 1832, when he was 82 years 
old. You need about half an hour to see everything, longer if you’re a Goethe 
fan; an audio-guide in English is available. The house is part of the adjoined 
Goethe National Museum, where you find more Goethe memorabilia.

Liszt Museum
Franz Liszt, the Hungarian composer and most famous pianist of the 19th 
century, spent the last period of his life in this house located at the west 
entrance of Park an der Ilm. Liszt, who served as musical director of 
Weimar’s National Theatre (which premiered Wagner’s opera Lohengrin), 
gathered young musicians around him in the high-ceilinged, handsomely 
furnished rooms. Displayed in the red-carpeted salon are one of Liszt’s 
pianos and the portable clavichord he used to exercise his fingers while 
he was traveling. Letters and other personal and musical mementos also 
are on view in a new first-floor exhibition space.

Schillers Wohnhaus (Schiller House)
After his friend Goethe, Friedrich von Schiller (1759–1805) is the greatest 
name in German literature. He lived with his family in this house, located 
just up the street from Goethe’s house, from 1802 to 1805. The house is 
furnished as it would have been in Schiller’s day. In the attic rooms, 
Schiller wrote his last works, including Wilhelm Tell (William Tell). You 
can wander through the entire house in about 15 minutes.

German) 2.50€ ($3.40). Open: Wed–Mon 9 a.m.–6 p.m. (until 4 p.m. Nov–Mar); tours 
Mon 1 p.m.
Schloss Belvedere (Belvedere Palace)
A pretty, baroque château located 3km (2 miles) south of Weimar, 
Belvedere Palace was a favorite retreat of Duchess Anna Amalia and her 
son’s “enlightened” Weimar court. In the château’s two pavilions you find 
a collection of decorative art from the rococo period and two exhibitions, 
one on hunting in the Weimar countryside, another on the culture of gar-
dens during the lifetime of Ernst August, who commissioned the palace. 
The English-style park was laid out between 1814 and 1840. A collection of 
historic carriages is showcased in the former Orangerie. You can visit 
both pavilions and the Orangerie in about two hours.

Open: Apr–Oct Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m. Closed Nov–Mar.
Schlossmuseum (Castle Museum)
This neoclassical structure, begun in 1789 and completed in 1803, replaced 
the royal castle that burned down in 1774. On the ground floor, the 
museum has a small but outstanding collection of paintings by Lucas 
Cranach the Elder and the Younger (including portraits of Martin Luther 
and his wife Katharine) and Hans Holbein. The upper floors contain works 
by lesser-known but interesting German artists of the 19th and 20th cen-
turies displayed in lovely period rooms with ornate parquet floors and 
neoclassical furnishings. Give yourself about an hour to wander through 
the galleries.

 Weimar Haus–Das Geschichtserlebnis (Weimar House–
The Weimar Story)
This multimedia attraction provides a basic introduction to Weimar’s his-
tory. Wax figures, theater sets, and videotaped projections help tell 
Weimar’s story from the earliest settlers in 3,000 b.c. through the time of 
Goethe, Schiller, Luther, and Napoleon. The tour lasts about 30 minutes; 
audio-guides in English are available.

Daily 10 a.m.–7 p.m. (until 6 p.m. Oct–Mar).
Wittumspalais
A short walk along Schillerstrasse from the Schiller House leads to the 
elegant Wittumspalais (vit-ooms-pa-lay). Completed in 1767, the “Widow’s 
Palace” was the residence of the widowed Dowager Duchess Anna Amalia, 
who presided over a “Court of the Muses,” where artists, poets, doctors, 
and philosophers met to discuss issues of science, thought, and art. The 
house, devoted to mementos of the German Enlightenment, has an exten-
sive collection of paintings, silhouettes (all the rage back then), and 
costumes.

Exploring the Thüringer Wald (Thuringian Forest)
Weimar sits in the northeastern corner of the Thüringer Wald 
(Thuringian Forest), long extolled by nature lovers for its scenic beauty. 
Within the forest, spruce-clad mountains rise to about 985m (3,225 ft.), 
old castles crown the tops of hills, and dozens of picturesque medieval 
villages dot the narrow, winding roads. Erfurt, 22km (14 miles) west of 
Weimar, is the oldest town in the region and the capital of Thuringia. 
Just south of Erfurt is picturesque Arnstadt, once the home of Johann 
Sebastian Bach. Ilmenau, a lively university town south of Arnstadt, is 
the starting point of a popular hiking trail known as Auf Goethes Spuren 
(In Goethe’s Footsteps), which leads to places associated with the great 
poet. If you want to explore this picturesque area by car, a 110km (68-
mile) scenic road called the Thuringer Hochstrasse (Thuringian High 
Road) runs from Eisenach to Ilmenau.

Anna Amalia and her beloved library
One of Weimar’s greatest cultural treasures, the Herzogin Anna Amalia Bibliothek 
(Duchess Anna Amalia’s Library), Frauentorstrasse (% 03643/545-102), was severely 
damaged in September 2004 when a fire raged through the 250-year-old library. The 
library is named for Anna Amalia, Duchess of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1739–1807), an 
aristocratic art lover known throughout the city for her love of books (and shoes). 
Anna Amalia regularly overspent her budget when purchasing additions to her 
beloved library, and in 1761 she converted the Grünes Schloss (Green Castle) into a 
library and had the courtly book collection, started by her father, moved there. The 
library was famous for its oval Rococo hall. One of the library’s most famous patrons 
was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who worked there from 1797 to 1832. The fire of 
2004 destroyed some 50,000 books as well as 35 historic paintings and a precious 
musical manuscript collection. It was the largest loss suffered by any library in post-
war German history. Some of the damaged books are being freeze-dried in Leipzig to 
save them from rotting as a result of water damage; one of the saved musical manu-
scripts was discovered to be a previously unknown 1713 aria by Johann Sebastian 
Bach. The library building was restored for $18.2 million and reopened in 2007 (the 
200th anniversary of Anna Amalia’s death) with some 60,000 volumes. You can visit it 
Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.; admission is 6.50€ ($8.75) adults, 3€ 
($4.05) students. There is an ironic twist to this fiery tale: Duchess Anna Amalia, who 
ceaselessly promoted Weimar as a cultural capital, also founded the first fire insur-
ance company in Weimar back in 1768.
Shopping in Weimar
A visit to Weimar’s antiques stores offers a chance to buy porcelain, 
silver, crystal, and furniture that survived the devastation of World 
War II. The most interesting shops include Antikitäten am Palais, 
Schillerstrasse 22 (% 03643/59625), and its immediate neighbor, 
Kaiser Antikitäten, Schillerstrasse 22 (same phone). Also appealing are 
Antikitäten am Schloss, Obereschlossgasse 2 (% 03643/512-993); 
Goethe-Antiquariat, Kaufenstrasse 7 (% 03643/402-567), selling books 
only; and Thiersch Antikitäten, Bräuhausgasse 15 (% 03643/402-540).
Discovering nightlife in Weimar
Weimar’s main performance venue is the Deutsches Nationaltheater 
(German National Theater), Theaterplatz (% 03643/755-334), where 
Franz Liszt and Richard Strauss once conducted. (This building is also 
where, in 1919, the National Congress passed the new democratic con-
stitution that was the basis for the short-lived Weimar Republic.) You 
can buy tickets for opera, dance, and concerts at the tourist information 
centers or the theater box office.

Buchenwald: Remembering the past
About 10km (6 miles) from Weimar, one of the great cities of German art and culture, in 
Buchenwald (beech woods) where Goethe and Schiller once walked, the Nazis set up 
one of their nightmare concentration camps. Bus no. 6 from Weimar’s main train station 
makes the trip northwest of town to Gedenkstätte Buchenwald (Buchenwald Memorial; 
% 03643/4300), the site of the camp. The Nazis confined about a quarter of a million 
Jews, Slavs, Gypsies, homosexuals, political prisoners, prisoners of war, and others in 
this work camp from 1937 until the camp’s liberation by the U.S. Army in 1945. At least 
56,000 people died at Buchenwald, and many thousands of others were sent from here 
to death camps in the east. Later, Soviet occupation forces also used the site as an 
internment camp. Between 1945 and 1951, the Soviets sent thousands of prisoners here 
to die. A memorial with a cluster of larger-than-life people, representing victims of fas-
cism, honors the people from 32 nations who lost their lives at Buchenwald. The 
museum reflects both the Soviet and the Nazi past of the camp. You can visit 
Buchenwald from May through September, Tuesday through Sunday, from 9:45 a.m. to 
6 p.m.; October through April, Tuesday through Sunday, from 8:45 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Admission is free. To reach the memorial, take bus no. 6, marked buchenwald.
Weimar’s bars and outdoor cafes are good places to drink and talk 
into the night. You find a good selection to choose from along

Southern and 
Western Germany

In this part . . .
S
outhern Germany is different from other regions in 
Germany, as you discover in this part. I devote Chapter 
15 entirely to Munich, the beautiful capital of Bavaria. You 
fi nd everything you need to know about Germany’s secret 
capital: how to get there and get around, how to fi nd a fi ne 
hotel or restaurant, and what to see. Going beyond Munich, in 
Chapter 16, I describe additional sightseeing possibilities in 
Bavaria, including the Romantic Road, an ideal driving tour 
loaded with unspoiled medieval towns, bucolic scenery, and 
must-see attractions such as Rothenburg ob der Tauber, 
Germany’s most famous walled medieval city, and Neusch-
wan stein, the most dramatic of Ludwig II’s fairy-tale castles. I 
also tell you about visiting the Alpine resort towns of Garmisch-
Partenkirchen and Oberammergau, famed for its woodcarv-
ers. In Chapter 17, I highlight lovely Lake Constance, known 
as the Bodensee in Germany, and the Schwarzwald (Black 
Forest), one of the most scenically delightful areas in all of 
Deutschland, home to the cities of Freiburg and Baden-Baden.
Western Germany includes the popular and populous 
Rhineland region and many famous cities that are easy to 
reach and fun to explore. Chapter 18 covers three cities in 
western and central Germany: Heidelberg, the romantic town 
on the Neckar River; Stuttgart, the cultural capital of southwest 
Germany; and Nuremberg (Nürnberg), with its picturesque cor-
ners and Gothic churches. Chapter 19 is all about Cologne 
(Köln), a lively city on the Rhine famous for its spectacular 
Gothic cathedral. Easy day trips from Cologne include the 
winegrowing regions of the Mosel Valley and the Rheingau sec-
tion of the Rhine Valley. In case you’re eager to ride the Rhine, 
I tell you about boat trips through the river’s most scenic 
stretches. Chapter 20 is all about Frankfurt, the sophisticated 
city with the huge international airport that is the German port 
of entry for many international visitors.

Chapter 15
Munich: Capital of 
Gemütlichkeit
In This Chapter
▶ Arriving in Munich
▶ Getting around the city
▶ Finding the best hotels and restaurants
▶ Discovering the top attractions
▶ Shopping for fashions, food, and more
▶ Enjoying Munich’s nightlife
M
unich, the capital of Bavaria, is a town that likes to celebrate. 
Walk through the Altstadt (Old City) on a warm, sunny day or a 
balmy night and you see people sitting outside, in every square, drink-
ing, eating, and enjoying life. Oktoberfest, which attracts over 5 million 
revelers, starts in September, and lasts for 16 days. Before Lent, from 
January through February, the city goes into party mode again and cele-
brates Fasching (Carnival), a whirl of colorful parades, masked balls, 
and revelry. Throughout the year, people gather in the giant beer halls 
and beer gardens to quaff liters of beer, listen to the oom-pah-pah 
bands, and have a good time.
Oom-pah-pah aside, Munich also is a rich, elegant, sophisticated city, 
with an unparalleled array of artistic and cultural treasures. World-class 
museums, palaces, concert halls, and theaters are part and parcel of life 
in the Bavarian capital. The city is all about prosperity and good-natured 
Gemütlichkeit, one of those hard-to-translate words that means some-
thing like cozy and/or good-natured. Think of Gemütlichkeit as a kind of 
cozy charm and you’ll get the picture.
If you believe the polls, Munich is the Germans’ first choice as a desir-
able place to live. Many Germans — especially the 1.5 million people 
who live in Munich — think of the city as Germany’s secret capital. 
Munich offers so much to visitors that I recommend you give yourself at 
least three days here.

Getting There
As one of Germany’s major cities, Munich has no lack of transportation 
options. Like Frankfurt, Munich has an international airport, so you can 
fly there directly from the U.S. or the U.K (20 flights a day from London). 
The city is easily accessible from anywhere within Germany or Europe.
By plane
Munich’s Franz Josef Strauss International Airport (% 089/9752-1313; 
www.munich-airport.com) is located 29km (18 miles) northeast of 
the city center. Opened in 1992, the airport is among the most modern 
and efficient in the world. The S-8 S-Bahn (% 089/4142-4344) train con-
nects the airport with the Hauptbahnhof (main train station) in down-
town Munich. Trains leave from the S-Bahn platform beneath the airport 
every 20 minutes daily between about 4 a.m. and 10:45 p.m. (less fre-
quently through the night). The fare for the 40-minute trip is 9.20€ ($12) 
adults, 1.20€ ($1.60) children. If you’re going to be using public transpor-
tation in the city, you’ll save money by buying an All-Zone Tageskarte 
(Day Ticket) for 10€ ($14) and using it to get into the city. The Lufthansa 
Airport Bus (% 0180/583-8426) runs between the airport and the main 
train station in Munich every 20 minutes from 5:10 a.m. to 7:50 p.m. The 
trip takes about 40 minutes and costs 10€ ($14) adults, 5€ ($6.75) chil-
dren. A taxi to the city center costs about 70€ ($95) and can take more 
than an hour if traffic is heavy.
Is this your first Oktoberfest?
The world’s greatest beer festival starts in late September and runs to the first Sunday 
in October. All the trinken und essen (drinking and eating) at this giant, 21⁄2-week party 
takes place at the traditional Theresienwiese (“Wiesn” for short) festival grounds, 
where different beers are sold in 14 different tents, each with its own atmosphere and 
food (sausage and sauerkraut prevails). If you’ve got kids with you (they’’ll love the 
rides), here’s a tip: The Augustiner tent is considered to be the most family-friendly. The 
best food is found at Käfer’s Wiesn’n-Schanke. Oktoberfest beer is delicious but strong, 
with a 5 percent to 6 percent alcohol level, and it’s served in 1-liter (33.8-ounce) por-
tions. Translation: Pace your beer drinking and imbibe plenty of water, or you may find 
yourself on the floor instead of at the table. The Wiesn welcomes millions of visitors but 
only has seats for about 100,000, so if you want to sit, especially on busy weekend 
evenings, it’s best to arrive early — the gates open at 10 a.m. — and claim your space. 
For information on Munich’s spring beer festival, see the sidebar “Starkbierzeit: 
Munich’s other beer festival,” later in this chapter.

 Chapter 15: Munich: Capital of Gemütlichkeit 247
By train
You can easily reach Munich by train from any city in Germany or 
Europe. Daily trains arrive from Frankfurt (33⁄4 hours) and Berlin (7 
hours). Munich’s Hauptbahnhof, on Bahnhofplatz near the city center, 
is one of Europe’s largest train stations, with a hotel, restaurants, shop-
ping, and banking facilities. A train information office on the mezzanine 
level is open daily from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.; you can also call Deutsche Bahn 
(German Rail; % 11861 for train information and schedules [an English 
speaker will be available to help you]; www.bahn.de). Connected to the 
rail station are the city’s extensive S-Bahn (light rail) system and the 
U-Bahn (subway) system.
By car
I don’t recommend driving in Munich. Most of downtown is a pedestrian-
only area — wonderful if you’re a walker, a nightmare if you’re a driver. 
Traffic jams are frequent, and parking spaces are elusive and costly. If 
you plan on making excursions into the countryside, renting a car in the 
city center instead of trekking out to the airport is more convenient. Car-
rental companies with windows at the main train station include Avis 
(% 089/1260-000), Hertz (% 089/1295-001), and Sixt Autovermietung 
(% 089/550-2447).
Finding Information after You Arrive
Munich’s tourist office, Fremdenverkehrsamt München (% 089/233-
96500; www.muenchen.de), operates a tourist information center in 
the main train station (Bahnhofplatz 2, adjacent to the DER Reisebüro/
German Rail Travel Office). You can pick up a map of Munich, get infor-
mation on cultural events, and book a hotel room. The center is open 
Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 10 
a.m. to 6 p.m. Another branch of the tourist office is located in the city 
center at Marienplatz in the Neues Rathaus (New Town Hall); hours are 
Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday from 10 a.m. to 
4 p.m. You can make a hotel reservation online or at the main tourist 
office.
Orienting Yourself in Munich
The Altstadt is an oval-shaped pedestrian-only district on the west bank 
of the Isar River. (See the “Munich Neighborhoods” map in this chapter.) 
Munich’s Hauptbahnhof (main train station) lies just west of the 
Altstadt. Marienplatz, the Altstadt’s most important square, is where 
you find several important churches, the Residenz (former royal 
palace), the National Theater, and the Viktualienmarkt, a wonderfully 
lively outdoor market. Between Marienplatz and the National Theater is 
the Platzl quarter, famed for its nightlife, restaurants, and the landmark 
Hofbräuhaus, the most famous beer hall in the world.

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
250
Odeonsplatz, to the north of Marienplatz, is Munich’s most beautiful 
square. Running west from Odeonsplatz is Briennerstrasse, a wide shop-
ping avenue that leads to Königsplatz (King’s Square). Flanking this 
large square, in an area known as the Museum Quarter, are three neo-
classical buildings constructed by Ludwig I and housing Munich’s antiq-
uities: the Propyläen, the Glyptothek, and the Antikensammlungen. 
Another triad of world-famous art museums — the Alte Pinakothek (Old 
Masters Gallery), the Neue Pinakothek (New Masters Gallery), and the 
Pinakothek Moderne Kunst (Gallery of Modern Art) — also lie in the 
Museum Quarter, just northeast of Königsplatz.
Ludwigstrasse connects the Altstadt with Schwabing, a former artists’ 
quarter located north of the Altstadt and known for its cafes, restau-
rants, and nightlife. Olympiapark, site of the 1972 Olympics, is north-
west of Schwabing. The sprawling park known as the Englischer Garten 
is located east of Schwabing. East of the Isar River lie Bogenhausen and 
Haidhausen, leafy neighborhoods just outside the city center where you 
find some hotels and restaurants. Theresienwiese, site of the annual 
Oktoberfest, and Schloss Nymphenburg (Nymphenburg Palace), one of 
Germany’s most beautiful palaces, are both located west of the Altstadt.
Getting Around Munich
Munich is a large city, only slightly smaller than Berlin or Hamburg. 
The best way to explore is by walking and using the excellent public-
transportation system. Subways (U-Bahn), trams (Strassenbahn), buses, 
and light-rail lines (S-Bahn) make getting anywhere in the city easy. In 
the Altstadt, you can walk to all the attractions — in fact, you have to, 
because the Altstadt is a car-free zone. For information, call the public-
transportation authority, MVV, at % 089/4142-4344, or visit it on the 
Web at www.mvv-muenchen.de.
Using public transportation
You’ll probably use the underground U-Bahn (subway) and the above-
ground (Strassenbahn, or tram) systems most frequently. The same 
ticket entitles you to ride U-Bahn, trams, and buses. Purchase tickets 
from vending machines marked fahrkarten in U-Bahn and S-Bahn sta-
tions; the machines display instructions in English. You also can buy 
tickets in the tram or from a bus driver. Tickets must then be validated 
in the machines found on platforms and in buses and trams; stick your 
ticket into the machine, which stamps it with the date and time. A vali-
dated ticket is valid for two hours. You can transfer as often as you like 
to any public transportation as long as you travel in the same direction.
Munich has four concentric fare zones. Most, if not all, of your sightsee-
ing will take place in Zone 1, which includes the city center. A single 
ticket (Einzelfahrkarte) in Zone 1 costs 2.30€ ($3.10).

Munich U-Bahn and S-Bahn

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
252
 
 
A Tageskarte (day ticket) good for a day of travel within the city limits 
costs 5€ ($6.75) for one adult; a Partner Tageskarte costs 9€ ($12) for up 
to five adults traveling together. A 3-Tageskarte (three-day ticket) costs 
12€ ($17); the Partner 3–Tageskarte, a three-day ticket good for up to five 
people traveling together, costs 21€ ($28). You can buy these cards from 
the ticket vending machines or at station ticket windows.
Catching a cab
Taxis are cream-colored, plentiful, and expensive. You can get a taxi at 
one of the stands located all across the city, or you can hail a cab on the 
street if its rooftop light is illuminated. Taxi fares begin at 2.70€ ($3.65); 
each additional kilometer costs 1.25€ to 1.60€ ($1.80–$2.15), depending 
on the distance; there’s an additional 1€ ($1.35) to order a taxi by phone. 
Call Taxizentrale at % 089/21610 for a radio-dispatched taxi.
Staying in Style
Hotels in Munich are more expensive than elsewhere in Germany, and 
rooms are scarce (and prices higher) during Oktoberfest and when trade 
fairs are in town. I strongly recommend that you book your Munich hotel 
room in advance. I’ve weighted my choices toward hotels in central 
Munich. The highest prices in this section are for rooms during 
Oktoberfest and trade fairs.
 
 The Fremdenverkehrsamt (tourist office) in the main train station (see 
the “Finding Information after You Arrive” section earlier in this chapter) 
can book a room for you and give you a map with instructions for reaching 
it. The service is free, but the office collects a 10 percent deposit of the 
total value of the room; the hotel then deducts this amount from your bill.
For locations, see the “Central Munich Accommodations and Dining” 
map in this chapter.
The top hotels
In this section, I list a variety of great hotels. See also the listing for the 
outstanding Mandarin Oriental Munich ($$$$) in Chapter 22.
Advokat Hotel
$$$–$$$$ Altstadt
You don’t find frills or froufrou in this streamlined 50-room hotel in a 
1930s apartment building. The Advokat is strictly minimalist in approach 
and has an understated elegance. The rooms are medium-size, with clean, 
simple furnishings. Each room comes with a compact bathroom, most 
with tub and shower.
See map p. 254. Baaderstrasse 1, 80469 München. % 089/21-63-10. Fax: 089/216-
3190. www.hotel-advokat.de. S-Bahn: Isartor (then a 5-minute walk south on 

 Chapter 15: Munich: Capital of Gemütlichkeit 253
Zweibrücken Strasse and west on Baaderstrasse). Rack rates: 165€–285€ ($223–
$385) double. Rates include breakfast. MC, V.
An der Oper
$$$–$$$$ Altstadt
This five-story hotel, dating from 1969, is wonderfully situated for sight-
seeing and shopping in the Altstadt. The décor is basic and modern with-
out being particularly distinguished. The 68 rooms are on the small side 
but have double-glazed windows and a small sitting area. The bathrooms 
are small, too, and come with a shower.
See map p. 254. Falkenturmstrasse 11 (just off Maximilianstrasse, near Marienplatz), 
80331 München. % 089/290-0270. Fax: 089/2900-2729. www.hotelanderoper.
com. Tram: 19 to Nationaltheater stop (then a 5-minute walk south on Sparkassen 
Strasse and east on Falkenturmstrasse). Rack rates: 180€–270€ ($243–$364) double. 
AE, MC, V.
 Eden-Hotel-Wolff
$$–$$$$ Near the train station
If you want a nice place right across the street from the train station, this 
is the best. From the outside, this large hotel looks a bit austere, but the 
interior has been redone with a pleasantly modern look. Most of the 211 
rooms are fairly large, and all are decorated in a comfortable, unobtrusive 
style. Bathrooms are larger than average, with tub and shower. One child 
age 5 or under is allowed to stay free in a parent’s room; for an additional 
child, an extra bed can be rented for 44€ ($59).
See map p. 254. Arnulfstrasse 4, 80335 München. % 089/551-150. Fax: 089/5511-5555. 
www.ehw.de. U-/S-Bahn: Hauptbahnhof (the hotel is opposite the north side of the 
train station). Rack rates: 148€–316€ ($200–$427) double. Rates include buffet break-
fast. AE, DC, MC, V.
 
 Gästehaus Englischer Garten
$–$$$ Schwabing
This 25-room guesthouse near the Englischer Garten is quiet, charming, 
and an excellent value. The rooms are small to medium in size and deco-
rated with a homey mixture of antiques, old-fashioned beds, and Oriental 
rugs. The bathrooms are small, with showers only. You can save a few 
euros by renting one of the six rooms that share bathrooms. In an annex 
across the street are 15 small apartments, each with a bathroom and a 
kitchenette. Breakfast costs an extra 9.50€ ($13); on nice mornings, you 
can eat outside in the back garden.
See map p. 254. Liebergesellstrasse 8, 80802 München-Schwabing. % 089/383-9410. 
Fax: 089/3839-4133. www.hotelenglischergarten.de. U-Bahn: Münchener 
Freiheit (then a 10-minute walk east on Haimhäuserstrasse to Erninger Platz and east 
on Liebergesellstrasse). Rack rates: 71€–120€ ($96–$162) double without bathroom; 
120€–180($162–$243) double with bathroom. AE, MC, V.

 Hotel Bristol München
$–$$ Altstadt
Built around 1960 and renovated in 2002, this efficient, modern hotel is a 
congenial, convenient place to stay in central Munich. The 56 rooms are 
fairly small, with simple, serene, comfortable furnishings. Bathrooms are 
compact and have showers. For a quieter room, request one that faces the 
courtyard.
See map p. 254. Pettenkoferstrasse 2, 80336 München. % 089/5434-8880. Fax: 
089/5434-888-11. www.bristol-munich.de. U-Bahn: Sendlinger Tor (then a 
5-minute walk west on Pettenkoferstrasse). Rack rates: 99€–150€ ($134–$202) double. 
Rates include breakfast. AE, MC, V.
Hotel Exquisit
$$$ Altstadt
This small, appealing hotel, built in 1988 in the same vicinity as the Hotel 
Bristol München (see the preceding listing), is located on a quiet residen-
tial street in the heart of Munich. The 50 rooms are large and comfortably 
furnished in an old-fashioned German style. About half of them overlook 
a pretty garden. The small bathrooms contain tiled showers. The staff 
here is unusually pleasant and helpful. The hotel is attached to the famous 
Augustiner beer hall and restaurant (see the “Dining Out” section, later in 
this chapter).

089/5519-9499. www.hotel-exquisit.com. U-Bahn: Sendlinger Tor (then a 
3-minute walk west on Pettenkoferstrasse). Rack rates: 175€ ($236) double. Rates 
include breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
 Hotel Jedermann
$–$$$ Near Train Station
Jedermann means “everyman,” and that translates here into affordable, 
family-friendly prices (including cribs and cots, adjoining rooms, and 
baby-sitting). This pleasant, family-run hotel offers a central location and 
55 comfortable rooms, most with roomy, shower-only bathrooms. Cheaper 
rooms with in-room showers but toilets down the hall also are available; 
14 newly redecorated rooms have air-conditioning. The hotel serves a 
generous breakfast buffet, and you can check your e-mail on the computer 
in the lobby.
See map p. 254. Bayerstrasse 95, 80335 München. % 089/543-240. Fax: 089/5432-
4111. www.hotel-jedermann.de. U-/S-Bahn: Hauptbahnhof (then a 10-minute 
walk west on Bayerstrasse from south exit). Tram: 19 to Herman-Lingg-Strasse (the 
stop across from the hotel). Rack rates: 65€–95€ ($88–$128) double without bathroom; 
75€–189€ ($101–$255) double with bathroom. Rates include buffet breakfast. MC, V.

 Chapter 15: Munich: Capital of Gemütlichkeit 257
Hotel Olympic
$$–$$$ Altstadt
Built as a private villa around 1900, this hotel has a high-ceilinged lobby 
and a large wood-paneled breakfast room that retain much of their origi-
nal late 19th-century detailing. The 38 rooms, however, are white, mini-
malist, and modern. Most of the midsize bathrooms come with shower 
only. The small, stylish hotel is popular with gay travelers, and several gay 
bars and cafes are located nearby.
See map p. 254. Hans Sachs Strasse 4, 80469 München. % 089/231-890. Fax: 
089/2318-9199. www.hotel-olympic.de. U-Bahn: Sendlinger Tor, then tram no. 
18 or 20 east to Hans Sachs Strasse. Rack rates: 155€–200€ ($209–$270) double. Rates 
include breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
 
 Hotel Opera
$$$$ Altstadt
An early 20th-century Italianate building with a courtyard and garden 
houses this small, elegant, boutique hotel. The 25 distinctively decorated 
rooms have country antiques or a cool, modern look. Some of the rooms 
have small balconies. Rooms in the rear on the third and fourth floors are 
quieter but also smaller than those facing the street. The bathrooms have 
a tub and shower. The hotel is a short walk from chic Maximilianstrasse 
and several major attractions.
See map p. 254. St.-Anna-Strasse 10, 80538 München. % 089/210-4940. Fax: 089/2104-
947. www.hotel-opera.de. U-Bahn: Lehel (then a 5-minute walk north on St.-
Anna-Strasse). Rack rates: 195€–275€ ($263–$371) double. Rates include breakfast.

Hotel Prinzregent am Friedensengel
$$–$$$$ Bogenhausen
This quietly charming boutique hotel on the east bank of the Isar has a 
lobby, breakfast room, and 64 guest rooms nicely decorated in a Bavarian-
chalet style with big, comfy beds and lots of wood. The rooms are fairly

Platzl Hotel
$$$–$$$$ Altstadt
Owned by the Ayinger brewery, this reconstructed “medieval” hotel is 
located across from the Hofbräuhaus, Munich’s famous beer hall. If you’re 
looking for a gulp of old-fashioned Bavarian ambience, this is one of the 
best choices in Munich. The 167 rooms tend to be small, but they’re pan-
eled in chestnut and alderwood and furnished with 19th-century repro-
duction antiques. Each comes with a compact tiled bathroom, most with 
a tub-and-shower combination. The rooftop terrace provides a view of 
Munich’s steeples and spires.

 Splendid-Dollmann

A small, beautifully done boutique hotel, the Splendid-Dollman is in the 
same league as Hotel Opera down the street, but not quite as chichi. The 
Splendid-Dollmann’s owners moved the hotel (formerly located about a 
block away) to this building in 2003 and completely redid the interior. No 
two rooms are the same, and some are on the small side, but the overall 
ambience is hard to beat. You can enjoy breakfast, for an additional 13€ 
($17), outside on a patio.

Dining Out
Munich is a city that loves to eat — and eat big. Homemade dumplings 
are a specialty, as are all kinds of sausages and Leberkäse, a large loaf of 
sausage eaten with freshly baked pretzels and mustard. Schweinbraten, a 
braised loin of pork served with potato dumplings and rich brown gravy, 
is Bavaria’s answer to the north’s Sauerbraten (pot- or oven-roasted mar-
inated beef). Fine restaurants, small cafes and bistros, and beer halls 
that serve food are found throughout the city. You can purchase inex-
pensive sausages, soups, and snacks from outdoor stalls all around the 
Viktualienmarkt.
If you want a refreshing nonalcoholic drink, served everywhere, ask for 
Apfelsaftschorle (ap-fell-saft-shor-luh), apple juice mixed with sparkling 
water.

When this century-old restaurant moved to its new location, in a 16th-
century building in the heart of Munich, it brought its wood-paneled inte-
rior with it. The cooking is light and refined, with a French influence, but 
several traditional Bavarian dishes also are on the menu. Special offerings 
include herb-crusted lamb, beef filet, lobster stew in a cream sauce, and 
seasonal dishes with white truffles. The desserts are sumptuous.

game dishes include Rehpfeffer (venison) with egg Spätzle (potato-based 
pasta) or tagliatelle with venison ragout. Grilled meats such as lamb and

The beer is Hofbrau, served by the mass (equal to about a quart and

The best beer gardens
Munich is famed for its Biergartens (beer gardens), where you can sit 
outdoors, quaff Munich’s famous brews, and order hearty Bavarian food 
at reasonable prices. For a glass or mug of beer, expect to pay 3€ to 
6.50€ ($4.05–$8.75), depending on its size. A simple meal generally costs 
around 10€ ($14). Salty pretzels and large white Radl (radishes) are tra-
ditional accompaniments to the beer. Oom-pah-pah bands, zither play-
ers, or accordionists sometimes add to the jovial atmosphere. For two of 
the best beer halls in Munich, see the listings under “The top restau-
rants,” earlier in this chapter, for the Hofbräuhaus am Platzl and 
Augustiner Grossgastätte. The food, drink, and atmosphere are much 
the same in the following two places that I recommend:
 
✓ Biergarten Chinesischer Turm, Englischer Garten 3 (% 089/383-
8720; U-Bahn: Giselastrasse), one of Munich’s largest and most 
popular beer gardens, is located in the Englischer Garten at the 
foot of the Chinesischer Turm (Chinese Tower), an easy-to-find 
landmark. This beer garden is open May through October daily 
from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m.
 
✓ Gaststätte zum Flaucher, Isarauen 8 (% 089/723-2677; bus: 52), 
near the zoo, has tables set in a tree-shaded garden overlooking the 
Isar River. This beer garden is open May through October daily 
from 10 a.m. to midnight; November to April, Friday, Saturday, and 
Sunday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Brezeln und bier (pretzels and beer)
In Munich, a Brezel (bray-zuhl; pretzel) is the traditional accompaniment to ein Glas 
helles (ine glahss hel-les; a glass of light wheat beer). Munich pretzels are delicious, 
with a golden, chewy, not-too-salty crust and a soft, thick interior. In the beer halls, 
you’ll often find pretzels on the table, but keep in mind that you’ll be charged up to 5€ 
($6.75) for every Brezel you eat. At some beer halls and gardens, a pretzel-seller walks 
among the tables selling fresh pretzels.

Sightseeing in Munich
Munich is one of the great sightseeing cities in Germany, offering several 
world-class museums, many fine churches and historic buildings, and 
lovely parks and gardens. For locations, see the “Central Munich 
Attractions” map in this chapter.
Discovering the top attractions from A to Z
Munich is a city bursting with first-rate museums, fascinating architec-
ture, and beautiful places to stroll. Enjoying Munich is easy, but if your 
time is limited, you’ll have to make some difficult decisions.
 
 Alte Pinakothek (Old Masters Gallery)
Museum Quarter
Pinakothek means “painting gallery,” and the nearly 800 paintings on dis-
play in this enormous building represent the greatest European artists of 
the 14th through 18th centuries. The museum is so immense that you can 
easily spend several days exploring the two floors of exhibits. To make the 
most of your time here, pick up a museum guide at the information desk, 
decide which paintings you particularly want to see, and then spend at 
least two to three hours.
 
 A free audio tour in English is available in the lobby. (Note: The audio-
guide costs 4.50€/$6.10 on Sun, when admission to the museum is reduced 
to 1€/$1.35.) When you see a painting you want to know more about, 
punch the corresponding number into your audio-guide to hear a full 
commentary.
Starkbierzeit: Munich’s other beer festival
Munich’s most famous beer festival is Oktoberfest (see the sidebar “Is this your first 
Oktoberfest?”, earlier in this chapter), but the city has another beer-themed festival, not 
as well known, that takes place just as the local beer gardens are reopening in the 
spring. Starkbierzeit (literally, “strong beer time”) is not like the communal mob scene 
of Oktoberfest. It’s more of a local neighborhood affair that happens at all the city’s beer 
gardens and brewery restaurants. The 1-liter servings of malty Starkbier that help 
Munich residents say auf wiedersehen to winter were originally intended to sustain the 
monks during their Lenten fast. One of the best places to celebrate Starkbierzeit is 
the brewery/restaurant/beer garden Paulaner am Nockherberg, 77 Hoch Strasse 
(% 089/14599-130), in southeast Munich. Paulaner serves the original Starkbier, a 
sweet, strong brew called Salvator, and pairs it with a traditional dish of crisp-skinned 
ham hocks served with sharp mustard. Its beer garden is a convivial spot with old 
chestnut trees and a playground for the kids. To reach Paulaner, take the U-Bahn to 
Kolumbusplatz, then bus no. 54 to Silberhornstrasse, and streetcar no. 25 to the 
Ostfriedhof stop.

 Bayerisches Nationalmuseum (Bavarian National Museum)
East of Altstadt
This museum contains three vast floors of sculpture, painting, folk art, 
ceramics, furniture, and textiles, in addition to clocks and scientific instru-
ments. The objects on view are among Bavaria’s greatest historic and 
artistic treasures. A major highlight is the Riemenschneider Room, which 
contains works in wood by the great sculptor Tilman Riemenschneider 
(1460–1531). The museum also contains a famous collection of Christmas 
Nativity cribs from Bavaria, Tyrol, and southern Italy. Give yourself at 
least an hour just to cover the highlights.
See map p. 268. Prinzregentenstrasse 3. % 089/211-2401. U-Bahn: Lehel (then a 
10-minute walk north on Wagmüllerstrasse and east on Prinzregentenstrasse). 
Admission: Tues–Sat 5€ ($6.75) adults, 3€ ($4.05) seniors and students, free for chil-
dren 17 and under; Sun 1€ ($1.35). Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (until 8 p.m. Thurs).
BMW Welt (BMW World)
Olympiapark
If you have any interest in cars, it’s worth the short trip out to Olympiapark 
to see the new BMW Welt showroom. Architecturally, this is a boldly dra-
matic structure with soaring lines and a glass-enclosed hourglass-shaped 
spiral ramp that leads up to a sky bridge to the museum and factory build-
ings that are part of the BMW complex. The interior of the showroom is 
sinuous and sexy, showing off all the latest models. This is BMW’s delivery 
center, and there’s even a gallery where you can watch emotional owners 
picking up the keys to their new BMWs. Have a look around (it’s free), and, 
if you’re interested, buy your ticket for the two-hour tour of the BMW 
Munich Plant — the tour is quite interesting. Then, if you want to see the 
company’s superb collection of vintage vehicles, head over to the over-
priced BMW Museum. It’s organized into categories (history, technology, 
racing efforts, design) and offers a collection of motorcycles and automo-
biles from the company’s beginning in 1929 to a hydrogen-powered road-
ster of the future.

Deutsches Museum (German Museum of Science and Technology)
Museumsinsel
Located on the Museumsinsel, an island in the Isar River, this is the largest 
science and technology museum in the world and one of the most popular 
attractions in Germany. Its huge collection of natural science and techno-
logical treasures includes some 15,000 exhibits in 50 departments. This 
museum has a few interactive exhibits and regular demonstrations on 
glass blowing, papermaking, and how steam engines, pumps, and histori-
cal musical instruments work. Kids will enjoy the model trains and his-
toric toys, and adults will find many items of historic interest, including 
boats and a biplane flown by the Wright brothers in 1908. Unless you have 
a keen interest in science and technology, however, you may find this 
enormous museum enormously uninteresting; most of the objects and 
exhibits are displayed as relics, without much dynamism in their presen-
tation. I recommend instead a visit to the Verkehrszentrum, the muse-
um’s marvelous transportation museum (see listing later in this 
section).
See map p. 268. Museumsinsel 1. % 089/21791. Tram: 18 to Deutsches Museum (the 
tram stops outside the museum). Admission: 8.50€ ($11) adults, 7€ ($9.45) seniors, 17€ 
($23) families. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed major holidays.
 
 Deutsches Museum Verkehrszentrum (Transportation Museum)
Theresienwiese
How have people transported themselves for the last 200 years? You’ll 
find out at this intriguing museum, which deals with mobility and technol-
ogy, travel, and urban transport. A wonderful collection of horse-drawn 
carriages demonstrates just how far we’ve advanced in the past two cen-
turies. You can see “Puffing Billy,” an early steam engine locomotive from 
1814 (used for hauling coal), step into a passenger train from the late 19th 
century, and peer inside a modern ICE train. Some of the bicycles on dis-
play are almost 150 years old. And then there’s the superlative collection 
of historic automobiles, including Daimlers, Opels, Mercedes, Tatas, 
Citroens, and Bugattis. All these vehicles are exhibited in three historic 
exhibition halls dating from 1908 and restored to their original appear-
ance. Give yourself at least an hour to see everything.
See map p. 268. Theresienhöhe 14a. % 089/5008-6140. U-Bahn: U4 or U5 to 
Schwanthalerhöhe (the Deutsches Museum exit is marked in the station and the 
museum is a 3-minute walk from the exit). Admission: 6€ ($8.10) adults, 4€ ($5.40) 
seniors, 12€ ($16) families. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed major holidays.
Englischer Garten (English Garden)
Northwest of Altstadt
Munich’s famous city park is one of the largest (922 acres) and most beau-
tiful city parks in Europe. Established in 1789, the Englischer Garten also 
is the oldest public park in the world. You can wander for hours along the 
tree-shaded walks, streams, and lake, and admire the view of Munich’s 

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
272
Altstadt from the round, hilltop temple called the Monopteros, con-
structed in the 19th century. The banks of the Eisbach, the stream that 
runs through the park, are popular nude-sunbathing spots. A giant beer 
garden (open Apr–Oct) occupies the plaza near the Chinesischer Turm 
(Chinese Tower).
 
 The park is a lovely place to have a picnic. You can pick up expensive 
picnic goodies at Alois Dallmayr (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chap-
ter), or less-expensive fare from the Viktualienmarkt (the produce market 
described later in this section) or at Hertie, the department store across 
from the Hauptbahnhof.
See map p. 268. Bounded on the south by Von-der-Tann Strasse and 
Prinzregentenstrasse, on the west by Königinstrasse, on the east by 
Lerchenfeldstrasse. U-Bahn: Odeonsplatz (then a 10-minute walk northeast through 
the Hofgarten to the park).
Frauenkirche (Cathedral of Our Lady)
Altstadt
Munich’s largest church, completed in the late 15th century, was a pile of 
smoldering rubble at the end of World War II. Only its landmark twin 
onion-domed towers from 1525 remained standing. The rebuilt church is 
strikingly simple and dignified, and the view from the tower is 
spectacular.
See map p. 268. Frauenplatz 12. % 089/290-0820. U-/S-Bahn: Marienplatz (then a 
5-minute walk west on Sporerstrasse to the church). Admission: Church free; tower 
3€ ($4.05) adults, 1.50€ ($2) students. Open: Church Sat–Thurs 7 a.m.–7 p.m., Fri 7 
a.m.–6 p.m.; tower Apr–Oct daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Marienplatz
Altstadt
This large pedestrian-only square in the heart of the Altstadt also is the 
old heart of Munich. Chances are, you’ll return here again and again, 
because many of the city’s attractions are clustered in the vicinity. On the 
north side of Marienplatz is the Neues Rathaus (New Town Hall), built in 
19th-century Gothic style and famous for its Glockenspiel (see the sidebar 
“Watching the Glockenspiel” in this chapter). You can take an elevator to 
the top of the Rathaus’s tower for a good view of the city center. The 
tower is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday and 
Sunday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission is 1.50€ ($2) adults, 1€ ($1.35) 
children 6 to 18.
To the right of the Neues Rathaus stands the Altes Rathaus (Old Town 
Hall), with its plain, 15th-century Gothic tower. Inside is the 
Spielzeugmuseum (% 089/294-001), a historical toy collection, open 
daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is 3€ ($4.05) adults, 1€ ($1.35) 
children.
See map p. 268. In the center of the Altstadt. U-/S-Bahn: Marienplatz.

Münchner Stadtmuseum (Munich City Museum)
Altstadt
This museum chronicles Munich’s history and the everyday lives of its 
residents. The museum’s one must-see exhibit is the Moriskentanzer 
(Moorish dancers), featuring ten carved and brightly painted 15th-century 
wooden figures. The second-floor photo museum traces the early history 
of the camera back to 1839. Children love the third-floor collection of mari-
onettes and hand puppets and the gallery of fairground art, which includes 
the oldest-known carousel horses, dating from 1820. The cafeteria in the 
museum’s main courtyard is open daily from 10 a.m. to midnight.
See map p. 268. St.-Jakobs-Platz 1. % 089/2332-2370. U-/S-Bahn: Marienplatz (then 
a 5-minute walk south on Rindermarkt and Oberanger). Admission: 4€ ($5.45) adults, 
2€ ($2.70) students and children 6–15; free on Sun. Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
 
 Neue Pinakothek
Museum Quarter
Housed in a postmodern building from 1981, this museum is a showcase 
for 19th-century German and European art, starting right around 1800. Not 
quite as daunting as the nearby Alte Pinakothek, this museum still has 
plenty to see. Artists whose works are on view include Thomas 
Gainsborough, Joshua Reynolds, William Turner, Francesco Goya, Caspar 
David Friedrich, Vincent van Gogh, and Paul Gauguin, among many others. 
A tour of the highlights takes a couple of hours; an audio tour in English 
is free with your admission (except on Sun).
See map p. 268. Barer Strasse 27 (across Theresienstrasse from the Alte Pinakothek). 
% 089/2380-5195. Tram: 27 to Pinakothek (the museum entrance on Theresienstrasse 
is across the street). Admission: Tues–Sat 9.50€ ($13) adults, 6€ ($8.10) students and 
seniors; Sun 1€ ($1.35). Open: Wed–Mon 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (until 10 p.m. Wed). Closed 
major holidays.
Watching the Glockenspiel
The best show on Marienplatz takes place daily at 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. (also at noon and 
5 p.m. during the holiday seasons) when the 43-bell Glockenspiel (carillon) on the 85m 
(280-ft.) central spire of the Neues Rathaus goes through its paces. Brightly painted 
mechanical figures reenact two famous events from Munich’s history: the knights’ tour-
nament during the 1586 wedding feast of Wilhelm V and Renate of Lorraine, and, one 
level below, the Schäfflertanz (Coopers’ Dance), first performed in 1683 to express grati-
tude for the end of the plague.

 Chapter 15: Munich: Capital of Gemütlichkeit 275
Peterskirche (St. Peter’s Church)
Altstadt
The bell tower of this 13th-century Gothic church, remodeled during the 
baroque era, is known locally as Old Pete. You get a splendid view from 
the top, but you have to climb (and climb and climb) 306 steps to see it. 
The interior of the church contains baroque-era sculptures, frescoes, and

Residenz (Royal Palace)
Altstadt
This magnificent building was the official residence of the Wittelsbach 
family, the rulers of Bavaria, from 1385 to 1918. Added to and rebuilt 
through the centuries, the palace is a compendium of various architec-
tural styles, including German and Florentine Renaissance, and Palladian. 
Artisans painstakingly restored the Residenz, which was almost totally 
destroyed in World War II. The must-sees are the Residenz Museum, with 
arts and furnishings displayed in some 130 rooms; the Schatzkammer 
(Treasury), with three centuries’ worth of accumulated treasures; and the 
Altes Residenztheater, a stunning rococo theater. You enter both the 
Residenz Museum and the Schatzkammer from Max-Joseph-Platz on the 
south side of the palace. On the north side of the palace is the Italianate 
Hofgarten (Court Garden), laid out between 1613 and 1617. An English-
language audio-guide is free with your admission.

p.m., Oct 16–Mar daily 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Schloss Nymphenburg (Nymphenburg Palace)
Nymphenburg
Schloss Nymphenburg, the Wittelsbachs’ summer residence, is one of the 
most sophisticated and beautiful palaces in Europe. The palace was begun 
in 1664 and took more than 150 years to complete. In 1702, Elector Max 
Emanuel decided to enlarge the original Italianate villa by adding four 
large pavilions connected by arcaded passageways. From central Munich, 
you can easily reach the palace by tram in about 20 minutes. You need at 
least half a day to explore the buildings and grounds.
Inside, you come first to the Great Hall, decorated in a vibrant splash of 
rococo colors and stuccowork. In the south pavilion, you find Ludwig I’s 
famous Gallery of Beauties with paintings by J. Stieler (1827–1850). The 
beauties include Schöne Münchnerin (Lovely Munich Girl) and a portrait of 
Lola Montez, the raven-haired dancer whose affair with Ludwig caused a 
scandal.
To the south of the palace buildings, in the rectangular block of low struc-
tures that once housed the court stables, is the Marstallmuseum, where 
you find a dazzling collection of ornate, gilded coaches and sleighs, includ-
ing those used by Ludwig II. The Porzellansammlung (Porcelain 
Collection; entrance across from the Marstallmuseum) contains superb 
pieces of 18th-century porcelain, including miniature porcelain copies of 
masterpieces in the Alte Pinakothek.
 
 A factory on the grounds of Schloss Nymphenburg still produces the 
famous Nymphenburg porcelain. Porzellan-Manufaktur-Nymphenburg, 
Nördliches Schlossrondell 8 (% 089/179-1970), has a salesroom and exhi-
bition center open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
A canal runs through 500-acre Schlosspark, stretching all the way to the 
so-called grand cascade at the far end of the formal, French-style gardens. 
In the English-style park, full of quiet meadows and forested paths, you 
find the Badenburg Pavilion, with an 18th-century swimming pool; the 
Pagodenburg, decorated in the Chinese style that was all the rage in the 
18th century; and the Magdalenenklause (Hermitage), meant to be a 
retreat for prayer and solitude. Prettiest of all the buildings in the park is 
Amalienburg, built in 1734 as a hunting lodge for Electress Amalia; the 
interior salons are a riot of flamboyant colors, swirling stuccowork, and 
wall paintings.
See map p. 268. Schloss Nymphenburg 1, 8km (5 miles) northwest of the city center. 
Tram: 12, 16, or 17 to Romanplatz (then a 10-minute walk west to the palace entrance). 
% 089/179-080. Admission: Palace grounds free; admission to all attractions 10€ 
($14) adults, 8€ ($11) seniors, free for children 6 and under. Open: Apr–Oct 15 daily 9 
a.m.–6 p.m., Oct 16–Mar daily 10 a.m.–4 p.m. Badenburg and Magdalenenklause

Theatinerkirche (Church of the Theatines)
Altstadt
Named for the Theatines, a group of Roman Catholic clergy, this church is 
Munich’s finest example of Italian baroque architecture. The church was 
begun by Italian architects in 1663 and was completed by German court 
architects about a century later. Fluted columns lining the center aisle sup-
port the arched ceiling of the nave. Every surface appears to be loaded 
with dollops of fanciful white stuccowork. The dome above the transept is 
decorated with an ornate gallery of large statues. Dark wooden pews and 
a canopied pulpit provide the only color in the all-white interior.
See map p. 268. Theatinerstrasse 22. % 089/210-6960. U-Bahn: Odeonsplatz (then a 
2-minute walk south on Theatinerstrasse). Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–1 
p.m. and 1:30–4:30 p.m., Sat 10 a.m.–3 p.m.
Viktualienmarkt (Produce Market)
Altstadt
Located on the square of the same name, close to Marienplatz, the 
Viktualienmarkt has been serving Munich residents for nearly 200 years 
and is a wonderful place to stroll and sniff and take in the scene. In an area 
the size of a city block, you find two dozen butcher shops, five cheese 
sellers, a whole section of bakeries stocked with dozens of different kinds 
of Bavarian breads and rolls, fish sellers, wine merchants, and dozens of 
produce stalls. Most of the permanent stands open at 6 a.m. and stay open 
until 6 p.m. weekdays or until 1 p.m. Saturdays.
 
 
The Viktualienmarkt has a large beer garden. You can buy food at the 
market stalls and eat it in the beer garden if you buy a beer, a soda, water, 
or other beverage at the beer-garden drink stand.
 
 At the Viktualienmarkt, and in other outdoor food markets throughout 
Germany, remember two points: Do not touch the merchandise (doing so 
is against German food laws) and don’t try to bargain for lower prices 
(prices are not negotiable).
See map p. 268. Bounded by Prälat-Zistl-Strasse on the west, Frauen Strasse to the 
south, Heiliggeiststrasse on the east, and Tal on the north. U-/S-Bahn: Marienplatz 
(then a 5-minute walk southeast through the square).
Finding more cool things to see and do
Munich has many important churches and museums in addition to those 
described in the preceding sections. Here are some other places to visit 
as you explore the city:
 
✓ The Antikensammlungen (Museum of Antiquities), Königsplatz 1 
(% 089/599-888-30; U-Bahn: Königsplatz), is an essential stop for 
anyone interested in ancient art. The museum’s five main-floor 
halls house more than 650 Greek vases, from a pre-Mycenaean ver-
sion carved in 3000 b.c. from a mussel shell to large Greek and 
Etruscan vases. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday 

 Chapter 15: Munich: Capital of Gemütlichkeit 279
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 8 p.m. Wed). Admission Tuesday 
through Saturday is 3.50€ ($4.75) adults, 2.50€ ($3.40) seniors and 
students; on Sunday, it’s 1€ ($1.35) for everyone. A joint ticket to 
the Museum of Antiquities and the neighboring Glyptothek 
(included later in this list) is 6€ ($8.10). See map p. 268.
 
✓ The Asamkirche, on Sendlinger Strasse (% 089/260-9357; U-/S-
Bahn: Sendlinger Tor), is a remarkable rococo church built by the 
Asam brothers between 1733 and 1746. Multicolored marbles, gold 
leaf, and silver cover every square inch of this small rectangular 
church with rounded ends. The church is open daily from 8 a.m. to 
5:30 p.m. See map p. 268.
 
✓ Lenbachhaus, Luisenstrasse 33 (% 089/2333-2000; U-Bahn: 
Königplatz), an Italianate villa built by the painter Franz von 
Lenbach between 1887 and 1891 to serve as his residence and ate-
lier, houses an outstanding collection of works by the Blaue Reiter 
(Blue Rider) school of artists working in Munich before World War I. 
Bold colors and abstract forms characterize the work of the artists 
represented, including Wasily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Franz Marc, and 
Gabriele Münter. Major exhibitions are held here and in the adja-
cent Kunstbau. Lenbachhaus is open Tuesday through Sunday from 
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 10 p.m. when major exhibitions are shown). 
Admission is 6€ ($8.10) adults, 3€ ($4.05) students. See map p. 268.
 
✓ The Michaelskirche (St. Michael’s Church), Neuhauserstrasse 52 
(% 089/231-7060; U-/S-Bahn: Marienplatz), a single-nave church 
with a barrel-vaulted ceiling completed in 1597, is the largest 
Renaissance church north of the Alps. The church is open Monday 
through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., Sunday from 6:45 a.m. to 
10 p.m. See map p. 268.
 
✓ Located across from the Antikensammlungen (see the first entry in 
this list), the Glyptothek, Königsplatz 3 (% 089/286-100; U-Bahn: 
Königsplatz), exhibits Germany’s largest collection of ancient Greek 
and Roman sculpture. Here you find sixth-century-b.c. kouroi (stat-
ues of youths), a colossal Sleeping Satyr from the Hellenistic period, 
and a haunting collection of Roman portraits. The museum is open 
Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 8 p.m. 
Thurs). Admission Tuesday through Saturday is 3.50€ ($4.70) 
adults, 2.50€ ($3.40) seniors and students; on Sunday, everyone 
gets in for 1€ ($1.35). See map p. 268.
 
✓ Olympiapark (% 089/3067-2414; U-Bahn: Olympiazentrum), site 
of the 1972 Olympic games, sits at the northwestern edge of 
Munich and is a small city unto itself. Various events, including 
concerts, take place at the colossal 69,000-seat stadium. 
Olympiaturm (% 089/3067-2750), the 293m-high (960-ft.) televi-
sion tower in the center of the park, is open daily from 9 a.m. to 
midnight. A ticket for a ride to the top costs 4.50€ ($6.10) adults, 
2.80€ ($3.80) children 15 and under. On a clear day, the extraordi-
nary view reaches all the way to the Alps. You might consider com-
bining a visit to Olympiapark with a trip to nearby BMW Welt, 

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
280
described in the “Discovering the top attractions from A to Z” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter. See map p. 268.
 
✓ Paintings, sculptures, works on paper, and art installations from 
the mid– to late 20th century are showcased in the striking new 
Museum Brandhorst, Theresienstrasse 35a (% 089/23805-1321; 
Tram: 27 to Pinakotheken), which opened in May 2009. The 
museum houses major works by American artists Cy Twombley, 
Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Alex Katz; the controver-
sial British artist Damien Hirst; and the German painter Sigmar 
Polke; and it features an unusual collection of books illustrated by 
Picasso. Hours are Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 
8 p.m. Thurs). Admission is 7€ ($9.45) for adults, 5€ ($6.75) stu-
dents and seniors; on Sunday, admission is reduced to 1€ ($1.35) 
for all visitors.
Seeing Munich by Guided Tour
You have two choices for orientation bus tours. The one-hour 
Stadtrundfahrt (city sightseeing tour) by Panorama Tours (% 089-
5490-7560; www.autobusoberbayern.de/panorama) is a straight-
forward affair — just hop on in front of the Hauptbahnhof and buy your 
ticket onboard ($13€/$18 adults; 6.50€/$8.80kids). Tours depart every 
20 minutes daily.
Panorama also offers 21⁄2-hour, 18€ ($24) city tours that, take you around 
old and new Munich aboard an open-topped bus. This longer tour 
departs every hour daily.
 
 For a more active experience, you can tour Munich by bicycle with the 
English-speaking ex-pats at Mike’s Bike Tours (% 089/2554-3988 or 
0172/852-0660; www.mikesbiketours.com). Mike’s offers four-hour, 24€ 
($32) spins around the sights of central Munich (including 45 minutes in 
a beer garden). The tours leave March to April 14 and September to 
November 10 daily at 12:30 p.m.; from April 15 through August, tours 
depart daily at 11:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. All tours meet 15 minutes before set-
ting off, under the tower of the Altes Rathaus on Marienplatz. No need to 
reserve, just show up. Tour price includes bike rental and helmet.
Munich Walk Tours (% 0171/274-0204; www.munichwalktours.de), 
conducted in English, are a great way to find out about Munich’s history 
and architecture. The company offers several options; the meeting point 
for all walks is the New Rathaus directly under the Glockenspiel on 
Marienplatz. No need to reserve; you pay the guide (identifiable by a 
yellow sign). The 21⁄4-hour “City Walk Tour” starts daily at 10:45 a.m. 
(with an additional tour at 2:45 p.m. on Sat and during high season). 
“Hitler’s Munich,” lasting about 21⁄2 hours, covers all the important facts 
and sites that played a role in Munich’s Nazi era; this tour departs daily 
at 10 a.m. (10:30 a.m. Nov–Mar). The cost for each tour is 10€ ($14) 
adults, 9€ ($12) for those 14 to 25, free for children 13 and under.

 Chapter 15: Munich: Capital of Gemütlichkeit 281
Shopping for Local Treasures
Munich is the fashion capital of Germany, and when the topic is shop-
ping, Munich ranks right up there with Paris and London. This city is not 
one in which you’re likely to find many bargains, however.
General shopping is less pricey on and around Marienplatz and along 
the main pedestrian streets Kaufingerstrasse and Neuhauser Strasse. 
The biggest concentration of shops selling secondhand goods is on 
Westenriederstrasse.
 
 Sometimes called “the Bloomingdale’s of Germany,” Ludwig Beck, 
Marienplatz 11 (% 089/236-910; U-/S-Bahn: Marienplatz), is Munich’s best 
department store and a good place to shop for handmade crafts from 
all across Germany. Hertie’s, Bahnhofplatz 7 (% 089/55120; U-Bahn: 
Hauptbahnhof), across from the main train station, is a good, all-purpose 
department store.
Dachau: Germany’s first 
concentration camp
In 1933, shortly after Hitler became German chancellor, Himmler ordered the first 
German concentration camp to be set up in Dachau, 19km (12 miles) northwest of 
Munich. Between 1933 and 1945, more than 206,000 prisoners arrived (the exact number 
is unknown), and more than 32,000 died. The first to arrive were political prisoners 
(Communists and Social Democrats), followed soon after by “beggars,” “antisocial ele-
ments,” homosexuals, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and, after 1938, growing numbers of Jews.
In 2002, parts of the KZ-Gedenkstätte Dachau (Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial), 
Alte-Roemar-Strasse 75 (% 08131/1741), were redesigned to focus on the fate of the 
prisoners and to integrate the still-existing historic buildings into the reworked perma-
nent exhibition. Visitors now follow the route of the prisoners, enter rooms in which citi-
zens were stripped of all their belongings and rights, and where, after disinfecting, they 
were given a striped prison uniform. Inscribed boards show the rooms’ original condi-
tions and functions. Captions are in German and English.
Dachau did not have gas chambers. Prisoners died through work, hunger, disease, and 
mass executions by shooting. The names of many of the dead are not known, but dis-
plays showing prisoners’ faces and videos of survivor interviews put a very human face 
on the horrific pain and suffering endured by these ordinary citizens.
To get to the camp, take S-Bahn train S2 from the Hauptbahnhof to Dachau (direction: 
Petershausen), and then transfer to bus no. 724 or 726 to the camp. The camp is open 
Tuesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admission is free.

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
282
The best streets for elegant boutiques and specialty shops are Brienner-
strasse, Maximilianstrasse (which also has the leading art galleries), 
Maffeistrasse, and Theatinestrasse. On these streets, you find branches of 
all the top European couturiers and Germany’s and Munich’s own design-
ers: Jil Sander, Joop, Bogner, Max Dietl, and Rudolph Moshammer. 
Antiques devotees with deep pockets find what they want on Ottostrasse.
Loden-Frey, Maffeistrasse 7–9 (% 089/210-390; U-/S-Bahn: Marienplatz), 
founded in 1842, is the place for all kinds of high-quality loden (a water-
proof wool) wear, such as coats, jackets, and hats. Dirndl-Ecke, Am 
Platzl 1/Sparkassenstrasse 10 (% 089/220-163; U-/S-Bahn: Marienplatz), 
has a large selection of high-quality Bavarian costumes, Dirndls (tradi-
tional German dresses), folk art, and handicrafts.
Discovering Nightlife in Munich
Something is always going on in Munich. As southern Germany’s cultural 
capital, Munich is renowned for its opera, symphony concerts, and theater. 
But you can sit back in a leafy beer garden or in a beer hall, have a beer, and 
enjoy the local scene. (See “The best beer gardens” earlier in this chapter.) 
You also find plenty of bars and dance clubs for late-night partying.
Raising the curtain on performing arts and music
Few cities in Europe can rival Munich for the sheer number of musical 
and theatrical events. To find out what’s playing, pick up a copy of 
Monats-programm from one of the tourist offices. The best way to pur-
chase tickets is to go directly to the venue’s box office, called a Kasse, 
which generally is open during the day and an hour before the perfor-
mance. The tourist information office in the Hauptbahnhof also sells 
tickets.
 
 Altes Residenztheater (Cuvilliés Theater), Residenzstrasse 1 (% 089/
2185-1940; Tram: 19), the jewel-box rococo theater in the Residenz (see 
“Discovering the top attractions from A to Z,” earlier in this chapter) also 
is an important performance venue for plays and operas.
Marienplatz at Christmas
Marienplatz, the main square of the inner city, is the scene of a famous Christkindl 
Markt (Christmas Market). From late November through December, the plaza overflows 
with stalls selling toys, tree ornaments, handicrafts, and a mouthwatering array of tra-
ditional snacks and sweets, including gingerbread, sugarcoated almonds, fruitcakes, 
smoked meats, and piping hot Glühwein, a spiced red wine.

 Chapter 15: Munich: Capital of Gemütlichkeit 283
 
Bayerischen Staatsoper (Bavarian State Opera; % 089/2185-1920; www.
bayerische.staatsoper.de) is one of the world’s great opera compa-
nies. Performances of both opera and ballet take place in the National 
Theater, Max-Joseph-Platz 2 (tram: 19).
The famous Münchner Philharmoniker (Munich Philharmonic Orchestra; 
www.muenchnerphilharmoniker.de) performs from mid-September 
through July in the Philharmonic Hall in the Gasteig Kulturzentrum 
(Cultural Center), Rosenheimerstrasse 5 (% 089/5481-8181; S-Bahn: 
Rosenheimerplatz).
Checking out bars and clubs
Cafes are quiet in the afternoon but pick up noise and steam as the eve-
ning wears on. In a cafe, you can sit with a coffee or a drink and order 
light meals or pastries. Nightclubs in Munich, as in the rest of the world, 
tend to get going around 11 p.m. or midnight.
Bars and cafes
Café Extrablatt, Leopoldstrasse 7 (% 089/333-333; U-Bahn: Universität), 
is a sprawling hangout for writers, artists, and the occasional celeb. The 
cafe is open Monday through Thursday from 8 a.m. to midnight, Friday 
and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m., and Sunday from 9 a.m. to midnight.

lively singles bar fueled by rum-based cocktails. The club hours are 
Monday through Wednesday from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. and Thursday 
through Saturday from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.
Master’s Home, Frauenstrasse 11 (% 089/229-909; U-/S-Bahn: Marien-
platz), is done up like an Edwardian-era London club and attracts an eclec-
tic assortment of locals and tourists. If the munchies strike, you can dine in 
the on-site restaurant. The club is open nightly from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m.
Nachtcafé, Maximilianplatz 5 (% 089/595-900; tram: 49), is one of the most 
happening nightspots in Munich, attracting soccer stars, movie stars, writers, 
and waves of “ordinary” patrons to its bar, restaurant, and stage shows 
(which begin at 11 p.m.). The décor is updated 1950s; the music is jazz, blues, 
and soul. No cover charge. The place is open daily from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Schumanns American Bar, 36 Maximilianstrasse (% 089/229-060; tram: 
19), offers expensive cocktails, mixed and/or invented by the owner, 
Charles Schumann; if you’re looking for a chic spot, this is it. The bar is 
open Sunday through Friday from 5 p.m. to 3 a.m.
Nightclubs
Set within an old factory, Kunstpark Ost, Grafingerstrasse 6 (% 089/4900-
2730; S-Bahn: Ostbahnhof), is a complex of bars, restaurants, and dance 
clubs. You can move from venue to venue according to your interest. All 
the bars open by 8 p.m. (don’t show up before then); discos start around 
10:30 p.m. Cover ranges from 5€ to 10€ ($6.75–$14).

Chapter 16
Going Beyond Munich: 
The Romantic Road and 
Day Trips in Bavaria
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring the medieval towns along the Romantic Road
▶ Discovering Neuschwanstein, the fairy-tale castle of Ludwig II
▶ Visiting the alpine resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen
▶ Day-tripping to Oberammergau and Schloss Linderhof
A
lthough Bavaria’s recorded history dates back some 1,100 years, 
the region didn’t become a kingdom until 1806, by order of 
Napoleon. Bavaria remained a kingdom until 1918, when a German 
republic replaced the Bavarian monarchy. Brief as it was, many 
Bavarians still regard that royal era with nostalgia. When they speak 
wistfully about “the king,” they mean only one: Ludwig II, the legendary 
“dream king” (or “mad king,” depending on your interpretation) whose 
castles at Linderhof and Neuschwanstein draw millions of visitors. 
Ludwig’s castles mark the end of the Romantische Strasse (Romantic 
Road), one of Germany’s most beautiful scenic drives and one of the best 
ways to sample the delights of Bavaria. Oberbayern (Upper Bavaria), the 
southernmost part of Germany, gently rises through foothills covered 
with verdant pastures, lake-splashed countryside, and groves of ever-
greens to the dramatic heights of the Alps that divide Germany and west-
ern Austria. Visitors to this mountainous region find a great deal to enjoy 
in addition to Ludwig’s castles. Bavaria abounds with romantic villages, 
rococo churches, houses with fancifully painted facades, historic build-
ings, world-class ski and winter-sports resorts, and nature on a grand 
scale. Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Oberammergau, both easy day trips 
from Munich, will give you a taste of what Bavaria has to offer.

The Romantic Road: Seeing the Best 
of Bavaria
If I had to recommend only one scenic drive in Germany, it would be 
Bavaria’s Romantische Strasse (Romantic Road). Driving these 290km 
(180 miles) of specially marked lanes and secondary roads, winding from 
the vineyard-clad hills surrounding Würzburg south to the green alpine 
pastures and craggy forested peaks around Neuschwanstein Castle, trav-
elers enjoy an unfolding panorama of surprisingly beautiful rural land-
scapes interspersed with a host of small medieval cities. In three or four 
days of very easy driving, you can hit all the highlights. (See the 
“Romantic Road” map in this chapter.)
If you’re arriving in Frankfurt, renting a car at Frankfurt airport (Chapter 
20) is easy. From there, you can drive southeast 119km (74 miles) to 
Würzburg, the official start of the Romantic Road. From Munich 
(Chapter 15), you can drive 119km (74 miles) southwest to Füssen and 
drive the route in reverse. The major towns for overnight stays are 
Würzburg, Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Augsburg, and Füssen, all of 
which I describe later in this chapter. You also can visit these towns by 
train as day trips from Munich or Frankfurt. For more information, visit 
the Romantic Road’s Web site (www.romantischestrasse.de).
Würzburg: Franconian Fortress
Würzburg on the River Main is a lovely, lively university town surrounded 
by miles of vineyards. The charms of this old, graceful river and wine 
town are most obvious in the Altstadt, the Old City center with its leafy 
squares and historic buildings, many of them rebuilt after World War II.
Though today it’s part of Bavaria, Würzburg was in ancient times an 
important town in the duchy of Franconia, which spread across south-
central Germany. The bishops of Würzburg, who took possession of 
the town in 1050, were also princes of Franconia, and remained so until 
Napoleon ended the power of the church in 1802. The two sights of 
most interest to tourists are the Residenz, the baroque palace of the 
Greetings from Bavaria
In Bavaria, people generally use the greeting grüss Gott (pronounced grease got) rather 
than guten Morgen (good morning) or guten Tag (good day). The saying means, roughly, 
“God greets you.” Goodbye is für Gott (pronounced fear got; for God) or für dich (pro-
nounced fear dikh; for you).

place to sit outside on a warm evening and dine on Franconian special-
ties of the Würzburg area. Try fresh fish in Riesling wine sauce; herring 
filets with apples, onions, and pickles in sour cream; roasted meats; or 
Zwiebelkuchen (zwee-bel-kook-en; an onion tart). Main courses range 
from 8€ to 18€ ($11–$24). The fresh, light, fruity Franconian wines of the

fried potatoes and eggs, or roast beef with fried onions and potatoes make

on the square in good weather, is open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., 
and 5:30 to 10:30 p.m. American Express, MasterCard, and Visa are accepted.
Exploring Würzburg
The town is compact enough so that you can walk everywhere — 
except, perhaps, up to the Festung Marienburg, accessible by a scenic 
footpath or bus no. 9, which will take you right up to the gate. A single 

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
290
fare on the bus or tram costs 2€ ($2.70); for local transportation informa-
tion call % 0931/36-13-52 or visit www.wvv.de.
Considered one of the most important palaces in Europe and a master-
piece of the baroque era, the 345-room Residenz, Residenzplatz 2 
(% 0931/35-51-70), was completed in 1744 by architect Balthasar 
Neuman for Prince-Bishop Johann von Schönborn. The most important 
areas to visit are the vaulted Treppenhaus (stairway), with a ceiling cov-
ered by a huge fresco with mythological allegories painted by Tiepolo; 
the Hofkirche, a court chapel with colored marble columns and two 
important altar paintings by Tiepolo; and the Weisser Saal (White Hall) 
and Gartensaal (Garden Room), both slathered with a riot of fanciful 
stucco work. Behind the palace, the formal and elegant Hofgarten (court 
garden) also is worth visiting. The Residenz is open daily from 9 a.m. to 
6 p.m. (10 a.m.–4 p.m. Nov–Mar); admission is 5€ ($6.75). Guided tours in 
English are given daily at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.
 
 One of the annual highlights of Würzburg’s cultural year is the Mozart 
Festival, which begins at the end of May and continues to the first week 
in July. Many of the concerts by renowned musicians are performed in the 
beautiful baroque rooms of the Residenz. For more information on this 
popular event, call % 0931/37-23-36 or visit the festival’s Web site (www.
mozartfest-wuerzburg.de).
Following Hofstrasse west from the Residenz, you come to the 
Romanesque Dom (Cathedral) St. Kilian, Domstrasse (% 0931/321-
1830), begun in 1040 and rebuilt after extensive damage in World War II. 
Continuing west on Domstrasse from the cathedral, you come to the 
Rathaus (Town Hall), and, just north of it, Marktplatz (Market Square), 
the liveliest square in Würzburg.
Crowning the high slope on the west side of the Main is the Festung 
Marienburg (Marienburg Fortress; % 09317/355-1750), reached by 
crossing the late 15th-century Alte Mainbrücke (Old Main Bridge) and 
following the marked footpath (you can also take bus no. 9 from the 
Residenz to the Festung stop). Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, 
Marienburg Fortress is a huge complex of buildings that includes within 
its walls the eighth-century Marienkirche (St. Mary’s Church), one of the 
oldest churches in Germany, and the Prince’s Building (admission 
4€/$5.40), which contains a not-very-interesting museum. The fortress 
and its historic rooms are closed from November to March 15. Also in 
the Marienburg complex is the Mainfränkisches Museum (% 09317/20-
59-40), open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 4 
p.m. in winter); admission is 3€ ($4.05) adults, 1.50€ ($2) students. The 
one must-see attraction in this local history collection is the room 
devoted to the carved wooden sculptures of Tilman Riemenschneider, 
the great Gothic master woodcarver (see the nearby sidebar, “Tilman 
Riemenschneider: Würzburg’s master woodcarver”).

 Chapter 16: Going Beyond Munich 291
Driving from Würzburg to Rothenburg
From Würzburg, the Romantic Road leaves the River Main and follows 
Route 27 in a southwesterly direction to the town of Tauberbischofsheim 
where you pick up B290 to Bad Mergentheim, 47km (29 miles) south 
of Würzburg. This small, attractive spa town is worth a stop to stroll 
along its pretty cobbled streets and to have a quick look at the 
Deutschordenschloss, a palace used by royal princes and the medieval 
order of Teutonic Knights. Devoted to armor and weaponry, the 
Deutschordensmuseum (Teutonic Knights Museum; % 07931/52212), 
within the palace complex, is open April through October Tuesday 
through Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., November through March 
Tuesday through Saturday 2 to 5 p.m. and Sunday 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Admission is 4.20€ ($5.65) adults, 1.50€ ($2) children 6 to 12.
Another 18km (11 miles) on B19 brings you to Creglingen, worth a stop 
to see the famous carved wooden altar by Tilman Riemenschneider in 
the Herrgottskirche, located on a signposted road about 2km (11⁄2 miles) 
south of Creglingen in Herrgottstal. The church, dating from 1389, was 
built where a farmer plowing his fields claimed to have found a sacred 
host. It quickly became a place of pilgrimage, and between 1505 and 
1510, Riemenschneider, the master woodcarver from Würzburg, created 
an extraordinarily beautiful altar with figures representing the 
Assumption of the Blessed Virgin framed by scenes from her life. The 
church is open February and March Tuesday through Sunday from noon 
to 4 p.m.; April daily from 9:15 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; May through November 
daily from 9:15 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.; it’s closed in January. Admission is 2€ 
($2.70); you buy your ticket at a machine outside the church. Across the 
road from the church is the small Fingerhutmuseum (Thimble Museum; 
% 07933/370), the only museum in the world devoted to the history of 
thimbles. It’s interesting . . . if you’re into that sort of thing. The museum 
is open April through October Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 
12:30 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m.; November through March Tuesday through 
Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. Admission is 1.50€ ($2).
Tilman Riemenschneider: 
Würzburg’s master woodcarver
Tilman Riemenschneider (1460–1531), whose incredibly expressive wood sculptures are 
the highlight of the Mainfränkisches Museum, lived and worked in Würzburg for 48 
years, serving as both a councilor and mayor. During the Peasants’ Revolt of 1525, this 
master woodcarver sided with the rebels and incurred the implacable wrath of the 
prince-bishops. As a result of his political views, Riemenschneider was imprisoned and 
tortured. He died shortly after being released from prison. You can see more work by 
this great artist at the Herrgottskirche near Creglingen on the Romantic Road, described 
in the “Driving from Würzburg to Rothenburg” section of this chapter.

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
292
Rothenburg ob der Tauber: Medieval Memories
 
 Rothenburg, a completely intact walled medieval city located on a high 
promontory above the Tauber River, is one of the major highlights along 
the Romantic Road. The town, just 51km (32 miles) southeast of Würzburg, 
has been a tourist destination for nearly a century, and from May through 
September you’ll likely encounter hordes of visitors. Don’t let that deter 
you from visiting this remarkable reminder of Germany’s medieval past. 
(See the “Rothenburg ob der Tauber” map in this chapter.)
Getting there
If you’re driving the Romantic Road, continue south from Creglingen on 
B290. You also can reach Rothenburg by train from Nuremberg, 
Heidelberg, or Stuttgart, but you need to transfer at Würzburg or 
Ansbach and again at Steinach. For train information, call Deutsche 
Bahn (% 11861; www.bahn.de).
Finding information
Tourist Information, Marktplatz (% 09861/404-800; www.rothenburg.
de), is open May through October Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 
6 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.; November through 
April Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The office can help 
you find a hotel room and offers general information about the city.
Staying in Rothenburg
See Chapter 22 for a description of Hotel Eisenhut ($$–$$$$), 
Rothenburg’s premier hotel.
 
 Everything about the 15-room Burg Hotel, Klostergasse 1–3, 91541 
Rothenburg ob der Tauber (% 09861/94890; www.burghotel.
rothenburg.de), is picturesque, from its half-timbered facade at the end 
of a cobblestone cul-de-sac to its large, prettily decorated rooms with views 
out across the Tauber Valley. Boutique hotel standards prevail, and the 
entire hotel is nonsmoking. Double rooms go for 100€ to 170€ ($135–$229), 
including breakfast; parking costs 7.50€ ($10). American Express, Diners 
Club, MasterCard, and Visa are accepted.
Dining in Rothenburg ob der Tauber
Burgerkeller, Herrngasse 24 (% 09861/2126), housed in a 16th-century 
cellar (with tables outside in nice weather), is a pleasant spot to dine on 
good, basic, local cooking and sample local wines. Standard dishes 
include Maultaschensuppe (stuffed pasta in broth) and Nuremberg sau-
sages on sauerkraut. Expect to pay 6€ to 10€ ($8.10–$13) for a main 
course. The restaurant is open daily except Wednesday from 11:30 a.m. 
to 2 p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m. MasterCard and Visa are accepted.

Rothenburg ob der Tauber
 
 Gasthof Marktplatz, Grüner Markt 10 (% 09861/6722; www.gasthof-
marktplatz.de), on the square to the right of the Rathaus, serves 
hearty, old-fashioned Swabian dishes, such as Käsespätzle (cheese-coated 
noodles) cooked with onions, and Jägerschnitzel (a pork schnitzel with 
cream sauce). It isn’t gourmet by any stretch, more like German comfort 
food. Main courses range from 8.50€ to 14€ ($11–$19). The restaurant is 
open Wednesday through Sunday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m. The 
Gasthof also rents out simple, inexpensive rooms (40€–50€/$54–$67, 
breakfast included), some with a nice view of busy, carless Marktplatz. No 
credit cards are accepted.

The Ratsstube, Marktplatz 6 (% 09861/92411), in the town hall, has a 
tavernlike interior and is a favorite of those who prefer hearty cooking 
(including Sauerbraten and venison) without a lot of fuss and bother. 
American-style breakfasts also are available. Main courses range from 9€ 
to 18€ ($12–$24). The restaurant is open Monday through Saturday from 
9 a.m. to 11 p.m., Sunday from noon to 6 p.m. (closed Jan–Mar). 
MasterCard and Visa are accepted.
Exploring Rothenburg ob der Tauber
 
 Medieval walls encircle almost half of Rothenburg; the other half of the 
town sits on a high ridge above the Tauber River. For an excellent visual 
introduction, take a walk on a portion of the town ramparts from the mas-
sive 16th-century Spitalbastei (a medieval tower-gate at the end of the 
Spitalgasse) to the Klingenbastei (another tower-gate). Then just stroll 
around and soak up the atmosphere in one of Europe’s best-preserved 
medieval cities. As you’re walking, look for a Rothenburg specialty called 
Schneeballen (literally, snowballs) — crisp, round pastries covered with 
powdered sugar. You can buy them in bakeries all across town.
At the center of Rothenburg is the bustling Marktplatz (Market Square) 
dominated by the Rathaus (% 09861/40492), part 13th-century Gothic, 
part 16th-century Renaissance. From the top of its 50m (165-ft.) tower, 
you get a great view of the town (open Apr–Oct 9:30 a.m.–12:30 p.m. and 
1–5 p.m.; admission 1€/$1.35). Adjacent to the Rathaus, and now serving 
as the tourist information office, is the Ratstrinkstube (Councilors’ 
Tavern), an old inn with three clocks on its gabled facade. Windows on 
either side of the lowest clock open at 11 a.m., noon, and 1, 2, 3, 9, and 
10 p.m. to reveal the figures of General Tilly and Herr Nusch, chief pro-
tagonists in the drinking bout that saved Rothenburg.
South of the Rathaus, a 14th-century hospital with Rothenburg’s only 
18th-century baroque facade houses the macabre Mittelalterliche 
Kriminalmuseum (Medieval Crime Museum), Burggasse 3–5 (% 09861/
5359). Medieval crime and punishment are the fascinatingly gruesome 
subjects of the museum’s displays. Here’s a rare chance to see chastity 
belts, shame masks, a shame flute for bad musicians, a dunking basket, 
and an iron maiden. Admission is 3.80€ ($5.15) adults, 2.60€ ($3.50) stu-
dents. The museum is open April through October daily from 9:30 a.m. 
to 6 p.m.; November and January through February daily from 2 to 4 
p.m.; December and March daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The Gothic St.-Jakobskirche (Church of St. James), Klostergasse 15 
(% 09861/700-620), is worth visiting to see the Heiliges-Blut-Altar (Altar of 
the Holy Blood), a masterpiece created by the Würzburg sculptor Tilman 
Riemenschneider. (Riemenschneider’s work also is on view in Würzburg 
and in the Herrgottskirche, described in the “Driving from Würzburg to 
Rothenburg” section, earlier in this chapter.) The fine painted-glass win-
dows in the church choir date from the late Gothic period. Admission is 
1.50€ ($2) adults, 0.50 (65¢) children. The church is open April through 
October daily from 9 a.m. to 5:15 p.m., December daily 10 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., 
November and January through March daily 10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 4 p.m.

 Chapter 16: Going Beyond Munich 295
Just northwest of the Jakobskirche is the Reichsstadtmuseum (City 
Museum), Klosterhof 5 (% 09861/93-9043), which is housed in a 
700-year-old Dominican nunnery with well-preserved cloisters, convent 
hall, and kitchen. It displays medieval panel paintings, a collection of 
gold coins, drinking vessels, armaments, and objects of local interest. 
Admission to the museum is 3€ ($4.05) adults, 2€ ($2.70) students and 
seniors, 1.50€ ($2) children 6 to 18. Open hours are April through 
October daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., November through March daily 
from 1 to 4 p.m.
Rothenburg has plenty of picturesque nooks and crannies to explore. 
One particularly pretty spot with lovely views over the Tauber Valley is 
Castle Gardens, a park on the site of the imperial castle. Also look for 
the photogenic corner known as the Plönlein, where two streets — an 
upper and a lower — converge.
Shopping in Rothenburg
Kunstwerke Friese, Grüner Markt (% 09861/7166), specializes in 
cuckoo clocks and carries Hummel figurines, pewter beer steins, music 
boxes, and dolls. Every day is Christmas at Käthe Wohlfahrt’s 
Weinachtsdorf (Christmas Village), Herrngasse 1 (% 09861/4090), a 
Christmas-related emporium loaded with thousands upon thousands of 
Christmas ornaments.
Driving from Rothenburg to Augsburg
The charm of driving along the Romantic Road is enhanced by the 
bucolic landscapes seen between the villages. North and south of 
Rothenburg, the drive parallels the lovely, leafy Tauber Valley. Driving 
along B25, on the way to Augsburg, you also pass neatly tended farms 
and fields. Two walled medieval towns worth a stop and stroll are 
Dinkelsbühl and Nördlingen. No must-see sights are in either town, just 
the picturesque streets, squares, churches, and houses.
The Master Draught: How Mayor Nusch 
saved Rothenburg
In 1631, during the Thirty Years’ War, General Tilly, commander of the armies of the 
Catholic League, captured the Protestant city of Rothenburg and was given, as victor, 
a 31⁄2-liter (6-pint) tankard of wine. He said he would spare the town from destruction if 
one of the town burghers could down the huge tankard in one draught. Former mayor 
Nusch accepted the challenge and succeeded, thus saving Rothenburg and giving him-
self a three-day hangover. This historical episode was performed as a festival play, 
called Die Meistertrunk (The Master Draught), in 1881. The play forms the centerpiece 
of a weekend festival that takes place every September in Rothenburg, when hundreds 
of citizens dress up in period costumes and re-create the period of the Master Draught.

Augsburg: Reminders of the Renaissance
Augsburg is a city of pleasant surprises. With a population of about 
260,000, it’s the largest town along the Romantic Road and serves as a 
gateway to the Bavarian Alps. The city was founded some 2,000 years 
ago by Roman Emperor Augustus and reached its cultural zenith during 
the Renaissance, under the patronage of the enormously wealthy Fugger 
family. A stroll through Augsburg reveals an attractive urban landscape 
loaded with historic buildings, charming corners, and the lively ambi-
ence of a university town. (See the “Augsburg” map in this chapter.)
Getting there
If you’re driving the Romantic Road, continue on B25 south from 
Rothenburg to Augsburg. Trains from Frankfurt (3 hours) and Munich 
(30 minutes) arrive frequently throughout the day. For train information, 
call German Rail at % 11861 or visit www.bahn.de.
Finding information and taking a tour
The tourist information office, Rathausplatz (% 0821/502-070; www.
augsburg-tourismus.de), open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. (Sun in summer 10 a.m.–
1 p.m.), distributes city maps, dispenses general information, and can 
help you find a room.
The best way to appreciate Augsburg’s architectural and cultural heri-
tage is by taking the walking tour (in German and English) offered by 
the tourist office daily at 2 p.m. from April through October, on 
Saturdays at 2 p.m. the rest of the year (7€/$9.45). The office also offers 
a two-hour bus tour May through October Thursday through Sunday at 
10 a.m. (9€/$12). All tours begin at the Rathaus.
Staying in Augsburg
 
 Romantikhotel Augsburger Hof, Auf dem Kreuz 2, 86152 Augsburg 
(% 0821/34-30-50; www.augsburger-hof.de), is a 36-room boutique-
style hotel located just minutes from central Rathausplatz and all 
Augsburg attractions. Rooms are nicely done with exposed beams in some 
and small but well-designed bathrooms with showers. Larger (and qui-
eter) rooms face an inner courtyard. Service is friendly and efficient. The 
hotel’s restaurant is one of the best in town. Doubles go for 90€ to 140€ 
($121–$189) and include a good breakfast buffet. American Express, 
Diners Club, MasterCard, and Visa are accepted.
The 102-room Steigenberger Drei Mohren, Maximilianstrasse 40, 86150 
Augsburg (% 0821/50360; www.augsburg.steigenberger.de), on 
Augsburg’s most elegant boulevard, is the town’s full-service luxury-
oriented hotel, though the rooms vary in size and level of finesse. The 
best are large and comfortable, with marble-clad bathrooms with big bath-
tubs. Rack rates for a double room range from 110€ to 196€ ($151–$245).

Dining in Augsburg
For fine food and impeccable service in lovely surroundings, dine at 
the restaurant in the Romantikhotel Augsburger Hof, Auf dem Kreuz 2 
(% 0821/34-30-50), where the rear dining room is paneled in pale linden 
wood and the menu contains lots of Bavarian and Swabian specialties. 
Expect to pay 12€ to 25€ ($16–$34) for main courses. The restaurant is 

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
298
open daily for lunch and dinner. The hotel’s Meder’s Bar and Grill serves 
smaller-portion German and international dishes throughout the day.
Fuggerei Stube, Jakoberstrasse 26 (% 0821/30870), an unpretentious 
local eatery, serves generous portions of Swabian food with a few “inter-
national” dishes. Look for potato cream soup with mushrooms; chicken 
breast with curry and rice; calves’ liver with apples, onions, and roast 
potatoes; and vegetarian offerings. Main courses range from 9€ to 18€ 
($12–$24); the fixed-price menu is 20€ ($27). American Express, 
MasterCard, and Visa are accepted. Hours are Tuesday through Saturday 
11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5:30 to 11 p.m., Sunday 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Exploring Augsburg
Augsburg’s main square, Rathausplatz, is dominated by two imposing 
Renaissance-era buildings, both considerably rebuilt after sustaining 
damage in World War II. The Rathaus, Am Rathausplatz 2 (% 0821/324-
9180), designed by Elias Holl and completed in 1620, is one of the most 
significant secular buildings of the German Renaissance. The interior is 
famous for its sumptuous Goldener Saal (Golden Hall), which can be vis-
ited only as part of a Rathaus tour (daily May–Oct, 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.; 
7€/$9.50). The Augustus fountain in front of the Rathaus was dedicated 
on the occasion of the town’s 1,600th birthday in 1594. If you climb to 
the top of the soaring spire of the Perlachturm (Perlach Tower), next to 
the Rathaus, you’ll be rewarded with a marvelous view of the old town 
center. The tower, capped by a distinctive dome called an “Augsburg 
onion” (you’ll see these onion domes on churches all across Augsburg 
and as you head south into Bavaria), is open May through October daily 
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
West of Rathausplatz, on Annahof, stands St. Anna, a former Carmelite 
monastery church dating from 1321. In 1518, Martin Luther stayed in the 
adjoining monastery when he was called to Augsburg to recant his 95 
Theses before a papal emissary. The church, which contains paintings 
by Lucas Cranach and the chapel of the Fugger family, is open Tuesday 
through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Right next to the church, on the 
Annahof, you find the city market with stalls selling flowers, produce, 
pastries, and much more.
Maximilianstrasse, ornamented by three large Renaissance-era fountains 
and lined with shops and fine patrician houses, stretches south from 
Rathausplatz. As you stroll along Augsburg’s most elegant boulevard, 
duck into the courtyard of Maximilianstrasse 36 to have a look at the 
Damenhof (Ladies’ Court) of what was once the Fugger-Stadtpalais 
(Fugger City Palace). A late 18th-century mansion, the Schaezlerpalais, 
Maximilianstrasse 46 (% 0821/324-4125), houses the Bavarian State 
Gallery, noted for its old masters painting collection with works by 
Dürer, Holbein, and Cranach. The museum is open Wednesday through 
Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; admission is 7€ ($9.45). A pair of 
churches, St. Ulrich and St. Afra, both dating from 1500, demarcate the 
southern end of Maximilianstrasse.

 Chapter 16: Going Beyond Munich 299
 
East of Maximilianstrasse, on Jakobsplatz in the old residential quarter of 
town, you’ll find the Fuggerei, one of the most important building com-
plexes in Augsburg. The first almshouses in the world, and still in use 
today, the Fuggerei was built in 1523 by Jacob Fugger the Rich. Surrounded 
by walls and gates (locked 10 p.m.–5 a.m.), the compound looks like a min-
iature town with 67 identical cottages containing 147 small apartments, a 
church, a fountain, and a park. Residents pay an annual rent of 1€ ($1.35; 
equivalent to one old Rhenish guilder) and are expected to pray three times 
a day for the soul of their benefactor. Tiny but fascinating, the Fuggerei 
Museum, Mittlere Gasse 13 (% 0821/319-8810), lets you glimpse the inte-
rior of one of the cottages as it looked in centuries past. It’s open March 
through December daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission is 2€ ($2.70).
Some of the oldest stained-glass windows in Germany, dating from the 
12th century, are found in the south transept of Augsburg’s cathedral, 
Dom St. Maria, Hoher Weg (% 0821/316-6353). Altered during the cen-
turies, the cathedral features Gothic frescoes, paintings by Hans Holbein 
the Elder, and a 14th-century bronze door.
 
 If you’re a fan of Mozart, you may want to take a look at the humble 
Mozarthaus, Frauentorstrasse 30 (% 0821/324-3984), where Wolfgang’s 
father, Leopold, was born. Wolfie’s great-grandfather Franz Mozart, a 
master mason reduced to penury, lived in the Fuggerei almshouse at 
Mittlere Gasse 14. The Brechthaus, Auf dem Rain 7 (% 0821/324-2779) 
was the birthplace of playwright Bertolt Brecht (1898–1956) and today 
serves as a Brecht memorial. The Mozarthaus and the Brechthaus are 
open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admission to each 
is 2€ ($2.70).
The Wieskirche: 
Masterpiece in a meadow
On the stretch of B17 from Augsburg to Füssen, the Romantic Road passes through 
some industrialized areas that aren’t particularly appealing, but then the verdant (or 
snow-covered) pastures of the Bavarian Alps appear. On this segment of the drive, I 
strongly recommend that you make a short detour to Wies, 6km (4 miles) southeast of 
the town of Steingaden off B17, where you find the Wieskirche (% 08862/501), a 
remarkable pilgrimage church in a beautiful Alpine meadow (the name means “church 
in the meadow”). One of the world’s most exuberantly decorated buildings, this rococo 
masterpiece was created by Dominikus Zimmermann (1685–1766), who worked on the 
church with his brother from 1746 to 1754. Behind a rather sober facade, the light-
flooded interior with its enormous cupola shimmers with a superabundance of wood-
carvings, gilded stucco, columns, statues, and bright frescoes. The church is open daily 
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 7 p.m. Apr–Sept). Admission is free. To return to the Romantic 
Road, backtrack to B17 and follow it south to Neuschwanstein, Ludwig II’s famous 
castle in the Bavarian Alps.

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany

Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau: 
Castles in the Air
Located 116km (72 miles) southwest of Munich, the two Bavarian royal 
castles of Hohenschwangau and Neuschwanstein (and the nearby town 
of Füssen) mark the end of the Romantic Road. Hohenschwangau, built 
by Maximilian II in 1836, is the less remarkable and more intimate of the 
two. Neuschwanstein, the most photographed building in Germany, was 
the fairy-tale concoction of Maximilian’s son, King Ludwig II. (See “The 
Romantic Road” map earlier in this chapter.)
 
 The royal castles of Hohenschwangau and Neuschwanstein are the most 
popular tourist attractions in Germany, receiving nearly a million visitors 
a year. Be prepared for long lines (sometimes up to 3 hours) in the 
summer, especially in August. On some days, 25,000 people visit. To save 
yourself time, try to arrive as soon as the castles open in the morning.
Getting there
If you’re driving from Augsburg along the Romantic Road, head south 
along B17 to Schwangau. From there, it’s a 7km (4-mile) drive along a 
signposted road. One parking lot serves both castles; parking costs 4€ 
($5.40). Ten buses a day (no. 9713) arrive from Füssen, the nearest large 
town (described later in this chapter).
Finding information and buying tickets
Information about both castles and the region in general is available in 
Schwangau at the Kurverwaltung (tourist office) in the Rathaus, 
Münchenerstrasse 2 (% 08362/81980), open Monday through Friday from 
7:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 to 5 p.m., Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon.
A ticket office near the parking lot of the castles sells tickets for both 
Hohenschwangau and Neuschwanstein. You can see the castles only on 
guided tours, which last about 35 minutes each. Tours in English are 
available throughout the day. A tour number and entry time are printed 
on your ticket. A digital sign informs you when your tour is ready. When 
the time comes, feed your ticket into the turnstile in front of the respec-
tive castle. The tour guide will meet you inside.
Exploring Hohenschwangau
The castle was a 600-year-old ruin when Ludwig’s father, Maximilian II, 
then Bavaria’s crown prince, bought it in 1832. On the ruins, he built the 
Neo-Gothic castle you see today and used it as a summer holiday resi-
dence. Ludwig II spent much of his joyless childhood at Hohenschwangau 
with his strait-laced father and his mother, Queen Maria of Prussia.
The rooms of Hohenschwangau were designed and furnished in a pon-
derous “Gothic Castle” style that was fashionable in the 1830s and 1840s. 
The Hall of the Swan Knight, named for the wall paintings depicting the 

 Chapter 16: Going Beyond Munich 301
saga of Lohengrin (a Germanic hero associated with the swan), is one of 
the castle’s most attractive chambers. The music room on the second 
floor contains copies of letters between Ludwig II and his musical idol, 
Richard Wagner, and the grand piano on which the two played duets. 
For many years, the extravagant dream king financed Wagner, who was 
first invited to Hohenschwangau by a teenaged Ludwig.
Hohenschwangau, Alpseestrasse (% 08362/81127), is open April 
through September daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., October through March 
daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is 9€ ($12) adults, 8€ ($11) stu-
dents and children 6 to 15. The box office opens for ticket sales one hour 
before the castle opens.
Exploring Neuschwanstein
Reaching the castle entrance involves a steep 800m (1⁄2-mile), 30-minute 
climb from the parking lot at Hohenschwangau Castle. If you don’t want 
to walk, you can take a bus to Marienbrücke, a bridge that crosses over 
the Pöllat Gorge and offers a panoramic view of the castle dramatically 
perched on its crag above. The bus ride, which starts in front of the 
Schlosshotel Lisl near the parking lot, costs 1.80€ ($2.45) going up, 1€ 
($1.35) coming down. From Marienbrücke, the walk to the castle 
entrance includes a steep, 170-step stairway and takes about ten min-
utes. A more picturesque way to reach Neuschwanstein is by horse-
drawn carriage. The carriage ride, which begins at the ticket office, 
costs 5€ ($6.75) for the trip up to the castle entrance and 2.50€ ($3.40) 
for the descent. Be aware that the carriages are sometimes crowded. 
Buy tickets from the bus driver or at the carriage.
Ludwig II: Madman or dreamer?
For some, Ludwig II is “the mad king.” For others, he is “the dream king.” This strange, 
self-obsessed monarch has become one of the legendary figures in Bavarian history. 
Biographies, films, plays, and even a musical have been written about him.
Born in Munich in 1845, Ludwig II was only 18 years old when he was crowned king of 
Bavaria. Tall, handsome, and blue-eyed, Ludwig grew bored with the affairs of state and 
eventually became more and more obsessed with acting out his extravagant fantasies. 
A patron of the composer Richard Wagner, he often had Wagner’s operas performed 
for his own solitary pleasure. At Linderhof, the first palace that he built (see “A side trip 
to Schloss Linderhof: Ludwig’s little Versailles,” later in this chapter), Ludwig went so 
far as to reconstruct the Venus grotto from Wagner’s opera Tannhäuser. The most 
famous of his design efforts is the turreted castle of Neuschwanstein, perched on a 
crag high above the town of Schwangau. Ludwig’s excesses eventually threatened to 
bankrupt the kingdom, and in 1886, at age 41, he was declared insane. Three days later, 
he was found drowned in Lake Starnberg on the outskirts of Munich, along with the 
physician who had declared him insane. Was he murdered or did he commit suicide? 
No one knows. The crypt of the Michaelskirche (St. Michael’s Church) in Munich con-
tains Ludwig’s grave and those of other Wittelsbach royals.

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
302
Ludwig watched the construction of his dream palace through a tele-
scope from neighboring Hohenschwangau. Building began in 1869 and 
continued for some 17 years, stopping only when Ludwig died in 1886. 
Between 1884 and 1886, the king lived in Neuschwanstein on and off for 
170 days. At Neuschwanstein, he received news of his dethronement. 
Three days later he was dead.
The king’s study is decorated with painted scenes from the medieval 
legend of Tannhäuser. Everything from curtains to chair coverings is 
made of silk embroidered with the gold-and-silver Bavarian coat of arms. 
The sumptuous ornamentation seen throughout the castle influenced 
Jugendstil, the German form of Art Nouveau.
The throne room, designed to look like a Romanesque basilica with col-
umns of red porphyry and a mosaic floor, was never completed. A stair-
way of white Carrara marble leads up to the golden apse where the 
king’s throne was to stand. Paintings of Christ looking down on the 12 
Apostles and 6 canonized kings of Europe decorate the walls and ceiling.
The intricate woodcarving in the king’s bedroom took 41⁄2 years to com-
plete. Artisans carved wall panels to look like Gothic windows; a mural 
depicts the legend of the doomed lovers Tristan and Isolde. The ornate 
bed rests on a raised platform with an elaborately carved canopy. 
Through the balcony window you can see the 46m-high (150-ft.) waterfall 
in the Pöllat Gorge, with the mountains in the distance.
Decorated with marble columns and frescoes depicting the life of 
Parsifal, a mythical medieval knight, the Sängerhalle (Singer’s Hall) 
takes up almost the entire fourth floor of the castle. Architects modeled 
the room, another architectural fantasy, after Wartburg castle in 
Eisenach, the site of song contests in the Middle Ages.
 
 In September, concerts of Wagner’s music take place in the Singer’s Hall. 
For information and reservations, contact the Verkehrsamt (tourist 
office) in Schwangau (% 08362/81980). Tickets go on sale in early June 
and always sell out quickly.
After you leave the guided tour, you can make your way down to see the 
enormous kitchens of the castle. A 20-minute film about the life of 
Ludwig II is shown in an auditorium.
Located at Neuschwansteinstrasse 20 (% 08362/81035), the castle 
can be visited year-round by guided tour only. From April through 
September, tours depart every half-hour daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; 
October through March, daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is 9€ 
($12) adults, 8€ ($11) children and students, free for children 6 to 14. 
Neuschwanstein is closed January 1; Shrove Tuesday (the Tues before 
Ash Wed on the Christian calendar); November 1; December 24, 25, 
and 31.

 Chapter 16: Going Beyond Munich 303
Dining near the castles
Neuschwanstein has a pleasant cafe where you can get sandwiches, des-
serts, and beverages. You’ll find other restaurants (some in hotels) right 
around the parking lot near Hohenschwangau. If the weather is fine, you 
can eat outdoors on the terrace of Hotel Müller, where the restaurant 
serves sandwiches, herring, soup, or larger meals. Main courses go for 
8€ to 16€ ($11–$22).
Füssen: End of the (Romantic) Road
Situated in foothills of the Bavarian Alps, 119km (74 miles) southwest of 
Munich and just 3km (2 miles) from Neuschwanstein, the medieval town 
of Füssen marks the official end (or beginning) of the Romantic Road. 
Divided by the Lech River, this town of 15,000 inhabitants has lovely 
squares and narrow cobblestone streets flanked by medieval stone 
houses. Its history dates back to Roman times, when Füssen was a trad-
ing station. Füssen is an atmospheric place to headquarter while explor-
ing the castles of Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau or other places 
in the Bavarian Alps. (See the “Füssen” map in this chapter.)
Getting there
If you’re driving along the Romantic Road from Augsburg, continue 
south on B17. From Munich, take the A8 autobahn west to Landsberg 
and then head south on B17. Trains from Munich (21⁄2 hours) and 
Frankfurt (5–51⁄2 hours) arrive frequently throughout the day. For train 
information, call German Rail at % 11861 or go to www.bahn.de.
Finding information
Füssen Tourismus operates two tourist offices, one at Kaiser-Maximilian-
Platz 1, another in the Rathaus (town hall), Lechhalde 3 (% 08362/
93850 for both; www.fuessen.de). Summer hours are Monday through 
Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon;

Schwangau 
(% 08362/9800; www.hotel-helmer.de), is a traditional Bavarian

only credit card accepted.
Dining in Füssen
Fischerhütte, Uferstrasse 16, Hopfen am See (5km/3 miles northwest of 
Füssen; % 08362/91970), at the edge of a small lake within sight of dra-
matic mountain scenery, specializes in seafood from around the world. 
Menu offerings may include Alaskan salmon, North Atlantic lobster, 
French-style bouillabaisse, fresh local trout, or grilled halibut. A few

Exploring Füssen
Füssen’s main attraction is the Hohes Schloss (High Castle), 
Magnusplatz (% 08362/903-146), reached by a steep lane behind the 
parish church. The powerful prince-bishops of Augsburg used the Hohes 
Schloss, one of the finest late-Gothic castles in Bavaria, as a summer res-
idence. Now the castle is the home of the Staatsgalerie, where you find a 
collection of Swabian artwork from the 1400s to the 1700s. The museum 
is open Tuesday through Sunday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Nov–Mar 2–4 p.m.) 
and charges 3€ ($4.05) for admission.
Immediately below the castle lies the Kloster St.-Mang (Monastery of St. 
Magnus), founded by Benedictine monks in the eighth century on the site 
where an Irish missionary monk named St. Magnus died in 750. In the 
early 18th century, Johann-Jakob Herkomer, a local architect, turned the 
church and monastery into a baroque gem with a strong Venetian influ-
ence. The Romanesque crypt in front of the high altar contains frescoes 
painted around a.d. 1000. Access to the secularized church complex is 
through the Museum der Stadt Füssen (City Museum), Lechhalde 3 
(% 08362/903-145), which occupies the former state apartments of

Garmisch-Partenkirchen: Doing the Zugspitze
Located about 97km (60 miles) southwest of Munich, the twin villages of 
Garmisch and Partenkirchen comprise Germany’s top winter-sports 
resort. (See the “Garmisch-Partenkirchen” map in this chapter.) In 1936, 
the fourth Winter Olympics took place here, and in 1978, the towns played 
host to the World Alpine Ski Championships. Garmisch-Partenkirchen 
enjoys a stunning location at the foot of the Wetterstein range. Two giant 
peaks, the Alpspitze and the Waxensteine, rear up to the south of town, 
hiding Germany’s tallest mountain, the famed Zugspitze.
Despite the commercial, touristy air of the towns, you still find charming 
details: the sound of cowbells in the meadows outside town, and streets 
and lanes (particularly in Partenkirchen) with a quiet, village 
atmosphere.
Getting there
Trains run frequently from all directions to Garmisch-Partenkirchen. 
The trip time from Munich is about 11⁄2 hours. For information and sched-
ules, call German Rail at % 11861 or visit www.bahn.de. To reach 
Garmisch-Partenkirchen by car from Munich, take the A95 autobahn and 
exit at Eschenlohe; the trip takes about one hour.
Finding information
The tourist information office at Richard-Strauss-Platz 2 (% 08821/180-
700; www.garmisch-partenkirchen.de) is open Monday through 
Saturday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sundays and holidays from 10 a.m. to 
noon. The office supplies maps and details of area hikes and attractions.
Getting around Garmisch-Partenkirchen
A free municipal bus runs every 15 minutes between the Bahnhof (train 
station) and Marienplatz, Garmisch’s main square. From Marienplatz, 
you can walk to all the centrally located hotels. The Bayerische 
Zugspitzbahn at Garmisch (% 08821/7970) provides rail service to the 
top of the Zugspitze and other local peaks.

On the slopes at the edge of town is the Olympia-Skistadion (Olympic 
Ski Stadium), with two ski jumps and a slalom course. Like the ice sta-
dium, this ski facility opened in 1936 and remains an integral part of 
winter life in Garmisch. The World Cup Ski Jump takes place here every 
January 1.
Alpine hiking is a major summertime attraction. People come from 
around the world to roam the mountain paths (called Hohenwege, or 
“high ways”), enjoy nature, and watch animals in the forest. One hiking 
destination, 1,688m (5,628 ft.) above Garmisch-Partenkirchen and accessi-
ble only by foot (the climb is strenuous), is the Jagdschloss Schachen 
(% 08821/2996), a hunting lodge built by Ludwig II, the “dream king,” in 
1871. The exterior of the lodge resembles a Swiss chalet, but the king 
insisted on an elaborately fanciful Moorish-style interior. The only way to 
see the lodge is by guided tour (in German only), given at 11 a.m., 1 p.m., 
2 p.m., and 3 p.m. from early June to early October. Admission is 4€ ($5.40) 
adults, free for children 13 and under. You need about four hours to hike 

 Chapter 16: Going Beyond Munich 309
there and back. The tourist office in Garmisch-Partenkirchen (see “Finding 
information” earlier in this section) can supply further details.
Ascending the Zugspitze
 
 For a spectacular view of the Bavarian and the Tyrolean (Austrian) Alps, 
you can go all the way to the summit of the Zugspitze, Germany’s tallest 
mountain (2,960m/9,720 ft.). You can choose between two different ways 
to reach the Zugspitze from the center of Garmisch, both involving a ride 
on a cog railway and a cable car:
 
✓ The first way begins with a trip on the Zugspitzbahn (cog railway), 
which departs from the back of Garmisch’s main railway station 
daily every hour from 8:35 a.m. to 2:35 p.m. The train travels uphill, 
past giant boulders and rushing streams, to the Zugspitzplatte, a 
high plateau with sweeping views. At the Zugspitzplatte, you trans-
fer onto a cable car, the Gletscherbahn, for a four-minute ride 
uphill to the Zugspitzgipfel (summit), where you find extraordinary 
panoramas, a cafe and restaurant, a gift shop, and many alpine 
trails. Total travel time to the top is about 55 minutes.
 
✓ The second way to get to the summit of the Zugspitze is to take 
the Zugspitzbahn for a shorter trip, disembarking 14km (9 miles) 
southwest of Garmisch at the lower station of the Eibsee Sielbahn 
(Eibsee Cable Car). The stop, next to an alpine lake, is clearly 
marked. From here, the cable car carries you to the Zugspitzgipfel. 
The entire trip takes about 40 minutes. The Eibsee Sielbahn 
makes runs every half-hour from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (to 5:30 p.m. 
July–Aug).
 
 A round-trip ticket enables you to ascend one-way and descend the other 
for the widest range of spectacular views. The round-trip fare is 36€ ($49) 
adults, 26€ ($34) ages 16–17, 20€ ($27) children 6 to 15. A family ticket for 
two adults and one child costs 83€ ($112). For more information, contact 
the Bayerische Zugspitzbahn, Olympiastrasse 27, Garmisch-Partenkirchen 
(% 08821/797-900; www.zugspitze.de).
Discovering the local nightlife
 
 From mid-May through September, Bavarian folk music and dancing take 
place every Saturday night in the Bayernhalle, Brauhausstrasse 19. During 
the same season, the Garmisch park bandstand plays host to classical 
concerts Saturday through Thursday. On Friday, these concerts move to 
the Partenkirchen bandstand. Check with the local tourist office (see 
“Finding information” earlier in this section) for details about these pro-
grams. The twin towns also play host to a Folklore Week in early August 
and a five-day Richard Strauss Festival in June; the composer lived in 
Garmisch from 1908 until 1949.

A side trip to Schloss Linderhof: 
Ludwig’s little Versailles
A scenic drive through the Emmertal, a valley flanked by 1,500m to 
1,800m (5,000- to 6,000-ft.) peaks, takes you to Schloss Linderhof 
(% 08822/92030; www.linderhof.de), the most elaborate of King 
Ludwig II’s fairy-tale palaces. Linderhof is open year-round and makes a 
wonderful day trip from Munich or Garmisch-Partenkirchen. (See the 
“Romantic Road” map earlier in this chapter.)
Oberammergau: Woodcarvers 
and Passion plays
An alpine village located 20km (12 miles) north of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, 
Oberammergau has been famous for its woodcarvers and Hinterglas artists since the 
15th century. Hinterglas (behind glass) painting, an art form unique to Bavaria, Croatia, 
and parts of Austria, is painting done directly on glass, and in reverse. In addition, every 
ten years a crowd from around the world converges on Oberammergau to see the 
Passionspiele (Passion play); the next one will be held in 2010.
Competition is fierce for sales of local woodcarvings made in hamlets and farmhouses 
throughout the region. Most of the carvings are of religious scenes, but you also find 
drinking or hunting scenes, animals, and folkloric figures. Know before you buy that 
even some of the most expensive “handmade” pieces may have been carved by 
machine prior to being finished off by hand. If you’re looking for authentic woodcarv-
ings, the following stores are reliable:
 ✓ Holzschnitzerei Franz Barthels, Schnitzlergasse 4 (% 08822/4271), sells a wide 
range of carvings, everything from small figures of saints for 54€ ($73) to jumping 
jacks with movable legs for 36€ ($49).
 ✓ Tony Baur, Dorfstrasse 27 (% 08822/821), has the most-sophisticated inventory of 
woodcarvings crafted from maple, pine, and linden. Prices start around 11€ ($15) 
and go up to 5,110€ ($6,899).
Actors first performed the famous Passion play in Oberammergau in 1634 when the 
town’s citizens took a vow to give thanks for being spared from the plague. Locals have 
performed the 51⁄2-hour, 16-act drama depicting Christ’s journey to the Cross every 
decade since 1680 (the last was in 2000, the next will be in 2010). The cast for this reli-
gious epic numbers in the hundreds. Actors must be natives of or have lived in the town 
for at least 20 years. Performances take place in the Passionspiel Theater, 
Passionswiese 1 (% 08822/92310).
A shuttle bus runs back and forth between Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Oberammergau 
daily. If you’re coming by car from Garmisch-Partenkirchen, take E533 north and turn 
west onto B23 at Oberau.

 Chapter 16: Going Beyond Munich 311
Getting there
If you’re driving from Munich, take the Munich–Garmisch autobahn 
(A95) south, turning west on B23 about 5km (3 miles) toward Ettal, and 
then drive for 13km (8 miles) on the signposted road, passing the hamlet 
of Graswang on the way.
Exploring Schloss Linderhof
In 1869, King Ludwig II decided to redesign this former royal hunting 
lodge to resemble the Petit Trianon at Versailles. The rustic lodge was 
transformed into a small, dazzling-white château overloaded with stat-
ues and decorations derived from many different periods and countries. 
The ornate exterior is actually restrained when compared with the inte-
rior, which is a riot of neo-rococo flashiness, glittering with gold leaf, 
mirrors, and crystal chandeliers. For all its ostentation, Linderhof is not 
without charm, thanks in large part to the beauty of its natural setting in 
the Ammerberge range and its formal French gardens.
 
 Linderhof is an extremely popular tourist attraction, so arrive early or you 
may have a long wait. You can see the palace only by guided tour; tours 
in English are available throughout the day. Your ticket has a specific 
entry time. A sign at the front of the palace tells you which group is cur-
rently being admitted. When your time arrives, feed your ticket through 
the electronic turnstile to gain entrance. A guide will meet your group 
outside the castle.
The park contains several small, fanciful buildings, including the Grotte 
(Grotto), inspired by the famous Blue Grotto at Capri. Built of artificial 
rock, with stalagmites and stalactites dividing the cavelike room into 
three chambers, the Grotto contains an artificial lake fed by an artificial 
waterfall and a stage hung with a backdrop scene of the first act of 
Wagner’s opera Tannhäuser. The original colored-light effects still illumi-
nate the room. On the lake, which had artificial waves, Ludwig kept two 
swans and a gilded, swan-shaped boat, in which he was rowed about the 
lake.
The palace and grounds are open April through October 15 daily from 
9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; October 16 through March, the Grotto and other park 
buildings close, but the castle is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Admission in the summer is 7€ ($9.45) adults, 6€ ($8.10) seniors 65 and 
older and students; in the winter, it’s 6€ ($8.10) adults, 5€ ($6.75) stu-
dents and seniors. The parking fee is 2€ ($2.70).

S
outhwestern Germany is an area rich in scenic splendor. In this 
corner of the country, you find the Bodensee (Lake Constance), one 
of the great lakes of Europe, and the legendary Schwarzvald (Black 
Forest). (See “The Bodensee [Lake Constance]” map in this chapter.) 
Atmospheric old towns such as Freiburg share the forest setting with 
glamorous resorts like Baden-Baden, while towns on the lake bask in an 
almost Mediterranean balminess. Vineyards and fruit orchards thrive in 
the region’s mild, sunny climate.
The Bodensee (Lake Constance)
What is the proper name, you ask: the Bodensee or Lake Constance? 
Both names are correct. In Germany, this 74km-long (46-mile) lake in the 
foothills of the Alps (elevation 395m/1,300 ft.) is called the Bodensee. In 
Switzerland and Austria, the countries that share its 258km (160 miles) 
of shoreline, it’s called Lake Constance.
The Bodensee is Germany’s largest and Central Europe’s third-largest 
lake. The widest point is almost 14km (9 miles) across. Visitors to the 
Bodensee enjoy the warm climate and waterside scenery. On the north 
(German) shore, vineyards slope down to crowded marinas, and charm-
ing old towns bask in the golden sun. Looking south across the lake, you 
see the towering, snow-capped Alps. Fierce winds from the mountains

The Bodensee (Lake Constance)

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
314
occasionally whip up the waters of the Bodensee, but for the most part 
the lake is placid. You even find subtropical vegetation growing in shel-
tered gardens. Lindau, a lovely island city on the northeastern shore, 
makes a good place to stay. Bicyclists take note: This is a great area for 
biking, and the cycling paths around the Bodensee are the most popular 
in Europe.
Lindau: Sunny island charmer
The historic island-town of Lindau, located 179km (111 miles) southwest 
of Munich at the northeastern corner of the Bodensee, was founded in 
the ninth century, and for hundreds of years the town was a center of 
trade between Bavaria, Italy, and Switzerland. The Altstadt (Old City), 
occupies a small island in the lake (accessible by a causeway); the 
newer part of Lindau spreads out to the mainland. A town of pretty, 
flower-bedecked squares and a harborside promenade, Lindau is a popu-
lar tourist destination that feels a bit like an Italian resort. (See the 
“Lindau” map in this chapter.) A profusion of gardens gives the town a 
quasi-Mediterranean air. So many historic buildings line its narrow 
streets that the entire town is a protected landmark.
Getting to Lindau
Lindau is one of the Bodensee’s major transportation hubs. A road 
bridge and a causeway for walkers and trains connect the town to the 
mainland.
By train, you can get direct connections to Lindau from Munich, Basel, 
Prague, and Zurich. Lindau is on a major rail line, and the train station is 
right in the Altstadt across from the harbor. For information and train 
schedules, call German Rail at % 11861 or visit www.bahn.de.
By car from Munich, take the A96 autobahn and then B31 into Lindau. If 
you’re driving from Füssen, follow B310 and B308 west, turning south on 
B12 (Kemptenstrasse). After you cross the causeway, park in one of the 
large car parks outside the Altstadt, because you won’t be able to drive 
into the historic center. Day and overnight tickets for car parks can be 
purchased from ticket machines.
From Lindau, you can travel by boat to towns in Austria and 
Switzerland and to Konstanz on the western side of the lake. Several 
ferries per day link Konstanz with Lindau, stopping at Meersburg and 
Mainau; the entire trip takes three hours. Check with the tourist office 
in Lindau or contact Bodensee-Schiffsbetriebe, Schützingerweg 2, 
Lindau (% 08382/2754-810; www.bsb-online.com), and 
Hafenstrasse 6, Konstanz (% 07531/3640-398).
Finding information and taking a tour
The Lindau tourist information office, Ludwigstrasse 68 (% 08382/260-
031; www.lindau-tourismus.de), across from the train station, is

This welcoming 23-room hotel, located at the end of the causeway, is the 
best budget choice in Lindau. The rooms are up-to-date and furnished in 
a functional, comfortable, modern style with lots of light. Some open onto 
a rear balcony. The small, tiled bathrooms have showers; two rooms have 
tubs and showers. Larger rooms with small sitting areas are in an older 
building (a glass-roofed conservatory connects the two). The location is 
an easy walk from the lake and casino.

Exploring Lindau
Lindau is best enjoyed by simply taking a couple of hours to stroll 
around the Altstadt. (See the “Lindau” map in this chapter.) Located 
almost directly across from the main train station, the town’s famous 
harbor, completed in 1856, is the most attractive on the whole of the 
Bodensee (Lake Constance). Rising from the promenade at the edge of 
the harbor is the 13th-century tower called the Mangturm; the name 
derives from the laundry, or “mangle house,” that once stood beside the 
tower. Flanking the harbor entrance is the 19th-century Neuer 
Leuchtturm (lighthouse) and the Löwenmole, a pillar with a sculpted 
lion (the symbol of Bavaria) looking out over the lake. You can climb up 
the narrow spiral staircase of the lighthouse (open daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; 
admission 1.75€/$2.35) for a panoramic vista of the Swiss and Austrian 
Alps across the water. At night, thousands of lights create a magical 
atmosphere around the harbor.
Located just north of Maximilianstrasse, Lindau’s main pedestrian-only 
thoroughfare, the Diebsturm (Thieves’ Tower), is the city’s most famous 
landmark. Built around 1370 at the most westerly point of the old town 
wall, this round tower with projecting upper turrets and oriel windows 
once served as the town jail (hence, its name). The tower is not open to 
the public. Standing beside the Diebsturm on Schrannenplatz is Lindau’s 
oldest building, the Peterskirche (St. Peter’s Church; open daily 9 a.m.–
5 p.m.). A rectangular building with a flat wooden ceiling and a tall, 
square tower, the church was built around a.d. 1000. The interior walls 
have late-15th-century frescoes by Hans Holbein the Elder. In 1928, the 
church became a war memorial for the fallen soldiers of World War I.
Return to Maximilianstrasse and follow the street eastward to the Altes 
Rathaus (Old Town Hall), erected in 1422 and notable for its grandly 
painted facade of a princely procession. The building’s stepped gables 
are typical of the 15th-century Gothic style, but in the 16th century the 
building received a Renaissance face-lift. Successive eras saw the addi-
tions of other architectural styles. The interior, once used as a council 
hall, houses the centuries-old town library (not open to the general 
public).
Continuing east on Maximilianstrasse and Cramergasse brings you to 
the Marktplatz (Market Square) with a pretty, flower-bedecked fountain 
in the center. The Stadtmuseum (Town Museum; % 08382/944-073) 
occupies a stately 18th-century baroque town house called the Haus 
zum Cavazzen. The museum contains a large collection of furniture 
(ranging from Gothic to Art Nouveau), silverware, glassware, tin and 
ceramic objects, and historical toys, paintings, and sculptures. A special 
attraction is the collection of mechanical musical instruments, including 
barrel organs, orchestral instruments, and mechanical pianos. The 
museum is open April through September Tuesday through Friday from 
11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday from 2 to 5 p.m., and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 
5 p.m. Admission is 2.50€ ($3.40).

 Chapter 17: The Bodensee and the Black Forest 319
On the east side of Marktplatz stand side-by-side Lutheran and Catholic 
churches. St. Stephan, the Lutheran church on the left, has a barrel-
vaulted ceiling and a fairly bare interior. Maria Himmelfahrt (Church of 
the Ascension), the Catholic church on the right, is full of baroque deco-
ration and has a frescoed ceiling. The churches generally are open from 
8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Continuing east from Marktplatz on Schmiedgasse, you come to the 
waterside Stadtpark (City Park) with its modern Spielbank (Casino).
Enjoying lakeside activities
For as little as 10€ ($14) you can rent a Fahrrad (fa-rahd; bike) and go 
cycling along the shores of the Bodensee (Lake Constance). The bike-
rental office, Fahrrad-Station-Lindau (% 08382/21261), in the train sta-
tion, is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2 to 
6 p.m., and Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Lindenhofpark, on the 
mainland, is the most scenic area for biking.
Three lakeside beaches (a beach is a Strandbad, pronounced strahnd-
bod) are open in summer Monday through Friday from 10:30 a.m. to 
7:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. The biggest 
beach is Strandbad Eichwald (% 08283/5539), with a grassy lakeside 
area and three heated swimming pools. The location is about a half-hour 
walk east along Uferweg, on the mainland, or take bus no. 3 to 
Karmelbuckel. Admission to the beach is 3€ ($4.05) adults, 2€ ($2.70) 
children. The Römerschanze (% 08283/6830), a smaller beach popular 
with families, is located next to Lindau harbor in the Altstadt; this beach 
charges 2.50€ ($3.40) adults, 2€ ($2.70) children. The third beach, 
Strandbad Lindenhofbad (% 08283/6637), is located in Lindenhof Park 
on the mainland, west of the causeway. To reach it, take bus no. 1 or 2 to 
Anheggerstrasse, and then bus no. 4 to Alwind. Admission is 2.50€ 
($3.40) adults, 1.50€ ($2) children.
Taking a turn at the tables
At Lindau’s glitzy Spielbank (shpeel-bank; Casino), Chelles Allee 1 
(% 08382/27740), you can play slot machines from noon to 2 a.m. and 
blackjack and roulette from 3 p.m. to 2 a.m. Admission is 2.50€ ($3.40), 
and a passport is required as proof of age. (You must be 21 to gamble.) 
Appropriate attire is a cut above casual: Men should wear a jacket and 
tie, and women, something dressy.
Mainau: A day trip from Lindau
The island of Mainau, famed for its subtropical gardens, makes for a 
pleasant day trip from Lindau. (See “The Schwarzwald [Black Forest]” 
map in this chapter.) If you’re driving through this part of southern 
Germany, you may want to stop at Mainau on your way to or from 
Freiburg in the Schwarzwald (see “Freiburg: Little brooks and lots of 
books,” later in this chapter).

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
320
Getting to Mainau
Bodensee-Schiffsbetriebe, Schützingerweg 2, Lindau (% 08382/2754-810; 
www.bsb-online.com), provides daily passenger service by boat between 
Lindau, Mainau, and Konstanz, the largest city on the Bodensee. A one-way 
fare from Lindau to Mainau is 13€ ($17); a round-trip Kombiticket, which 
includes admission at Mainau, costs 35€ ($47). You can also drive west from 
Lindau to Meersburg, on the lake’s north shore, and catch a car-ferry to 
Mainau. Generally, from 8:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., two ferries per hour make the 
4.2km (21⁄2-mile) crossing (one per hour through the night) to Konstanz; not 
all of them stop at Mainau, so check before boarding. Service is less fre-
quent on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. Contact Autofähre Konstanz-
Meersburg (% 07531/803-666) for information and schedules.
 
 
If you’re driving, you can park and leave your car in Meersburg, hop on 
the ferry, and easily walk through Mainau. This is the best (and only) way 
to see Mainau, because cars are restricted on the island.
Visiting the island of Mainau
The semitropical island of Mainau, where palms and orange trees grow 
and fragrant flowers bloom year-round, lies 6km (4 miles) north of 
Konstanz, in an arm of the Bodensee (Lake Constance) known as the 
Überlingersee. The baroque castle that forms the centerpiece of the 
island once was a residence of the Knights of the Teutonic Order. In 
1853, Grand Duke Friedrich I of Baden purchased the island as a summer 
residence. A passionate plant lover, he laid the foundations for the 
Arboretum, the Rose Garden, and the Orangery, gardens that his great-
grandchild, Count Lennart Bernadotte, the current owner of this 110-
acre botanical wonderland, would later develop. Palms, citrus and fruit 
trees, orchids, azaleas, rhododendrons, tens of thousands of tulips in 
the spring, and roses in the summer fill the gardens. Butterflies from 
throughout the world flit and flutter through the Butterfly House. The 
island has a Mediterranean luxuriance that invites leisurely strolling.
The island’s gardens are open daily year-round. From March 24 through 
October 24, hours are 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.; winter hours are 9 a.m. to dusk. 
Admission is 15€ ($20) adults, 8€ ($11) children, 30€ ($40) families (par-
ents and children 14 and under). Admission includes the gardens, the 
Butterfly House, the Palm House, and an exhibition on the Bodensee 
(Lake Constance) in the castle.
From April through mid-October, several places on the island are open 
daily for dining or a quick snack. The island’s culinary high point is the 
Schwedenschenke (% 07531/303-156; open 11 a.m.–10 p.m.), which fea-
tures seasonal specialties such as asparagus in the spring, chanterelle 
mushrooms in late summer, and game dishes in the fall. Casual dining 
options include the Butterfly Bistro (open 10 a.m.–8 p.m.) and the Castle 
Cafe (open 11 a.m.–6 p.m.)

 Chapter 17: The Bodensee and the Black Forest 321
For more information, call % 07531/3030 or visit www.mainau.de. Give 
yourself at least two hours to explore and enjoy the island.
The Schwarzwald (Black Forest)
Travelers to the Schwarzwald (schvahrtz-vald; Black Forest) come to two 
cities in particular: Baden-Baden, a spa resort with thermal waters and an 
elegant casino, and the medieval university town of Freiburg. (See “The 
Schwarzwald [Black Forest]” map in this chapter.) For the Germans them-
selves, however, the mountainous, legend-filled forest is a favorite place 
to spend holidays outdoors, amid nature. Villages with half-timbered 
buildings, hiking trails, and pretty spots where stressed-out city dwellers 
take die Kur (the cure) at health resorts fill the pine- and spruce-filled 
forest, which dominates the southwestern corner of Germany. The 
Schwarzwald (Black Forest), about 145km (90 miles) long and 40km 
(25 miles) wide, runs parallel to the Rhine, which serves as a boundary 
with Switzerland to the south and France to the west. The Bodensee 
(Lake Constance) adjoins the forest to the east.
Visitors with limited time generally skip the area’s cure and sports 
aspects and focus instead on the scenic pleasures of the Schwarzwald, 
long associated with legends, fairy tales, and cuckoo clocks.
 
 The name “Black Forest” is a translation of the Latin Silva Nigra, the name 
given to the forest by Romans some 2,000 years ago. Why did they call it 
that? Because from a distance the dark green pine and fir trees look black.
You can explore the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) in many ways. You can 
easily reach Baden-Baden and Freiburg, the two towns I recommend for 
overnight visits, by train. Having a car opens up more of the country-
side. One of the most popular auto trips is from Baden-Baden to 
Freudenstadt on the Schwarzwald Hochstrasse (Black Forest High Road; 
B500), which runs almost the entire length of the forest.
From cake to sausage: Black Forest treats
Maybe you’ve heard of that famous thick, chocolaty cake flavored with cherry pre-
serves and called Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte (Black Forest Cherry Cake). The famous 
cake is one of the specialties of a region that’s something of a culinary crossroads. The 
forest’s proximity to France and Switzerland has influenced the cooking you find in 
many Schwarzwald (Black Forest) restaurants. If you want to sample other regional 
specialties, look for Zwetchgentorte (plum pastry), Zwiebelkuchen (onion tart), 
Schwarzwald Schinken (Black Forest smoked ham), meat and fowl dishes with creamy 
sauces, and wild game such as venison and boar. Most restaurants make their own 
Hauswurst (house sausage) and guard the recipe.

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
322
Baden-Baden: Germany’s premier spa town
Baden-Baden is one of the world’s most famous spa resorts. The thermal 
springs bubbling up from beneath the town have been healing aches and 
pains for more than 2,000 years. The composition of the slightly radioac-
tive mineral water is almost the same today as when the Romans built the 
first bath complexes here in the third century. Even the Roman emperor 
Caracalla traveled to this part of the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) to get 
some relief from his arthritis. In the 19th century, European nobility and 
clients such as Queen Victoria and Kaiser Wilhelm I rediscovered Baden-
Baden’s waters, and Napoleon III gave the town a glamorous new aristo-
cratic cachet. The personalities of the day — artists like Berlioz, Brahms, 
and Dostoevsky— also helped to make Baden-Baden the most elegant and 
sophisticated playground in Germany.
Baden-Baden still evokes that aura of 19th-century privilege. The town 
has the most up-to-date spa facilities in Germany, and people still flock 
here to soak and be healed of various ailments and to try their luck in 
the famous casino. If you’re not into a health regimen or interested in 
gambling, you may find Baden-Baden a bit boring-boring.
Located 174km (108 miles) south of Frankfurt in the northern portion of 
the Schwarzwald (Black Forest), Baden-Baden attracts many sports and 
outdoor enthusiasts, who come to hike, golf, play tennis, and ride 
horses. The horseracing season at nearby Iffezheim, one of the summer 
sporting events in Europe, takes place in August. (See the “Baden-
Baden” map in this chapter.)
Getting to Baden-Baden
You can easily reach Baden-Baden by train from anywhere in Germany. 
Trip time from Munich is about four hours; from Frankfurt, about three 
hours. For train information, call German Rail at % 11861 or visit www.
bahn.de. The Bahnhof (railway station) is at Baden-Oos, about 5km 
(3 miles) north of town. To get into the center of town, you take bus 
no. 201 (get on at the train station and get off at Leopoldsplatz; fare is 
2€/$2.70) or a taxi, always available in front of the station (fare is approx-
imately 12€/$16).
For those with a car, the A5 autobahn between Basel and Frankfurt runs 
north–south through the entire region, and the A8 Autobahn runs east–
west, connecting Baden-Baden to Munich. The drive south from 
Frankfurt takes about two hours; from Munich, about four hours.
Finding information
The tourist information office in the Trinkhalle, Kaiser Allee 3 (% 07221/
275-200; www.baden-baden.com), is open Monday through Saturday 
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. It has a complete 
schedule of events and information on town and regional attractions. If 
you’re driving into town, you can easily access a second tourist office

Gasthaus Löwenbräu
$–$$ Altstadt GERMAN/BAVARIAN
This restaurant serves simple, affordable, and well-prepared food in two 
settings: on a romantic terrace beneath linden trees or in an indoor dining 
room with curved glass walls. Many kinds of German sausage are on the 
menu with Bavarian specialties and a wide selection of cheeses. Regional 
devotees order pork knuckles fresh from the grill. For dessert, try the 
apple fritters. The restaurant also has a popular beer garden.

Park-Restaurant
$$$$ Altstadt INTERNATIONAL/RHINELAND
This fancy, high-priced restaurant in the glamorous Brenner’s Park Hotel 
is one of the renowned hotel dining rooms of Europe and received a 
Michelin star in 2006. The emphasis is on French dishes, along with sea-
food and regional Rhine Valley foods. Specialties include sautéed goose-
liver, roast saddle of venison or lamb, and grilled lobster and fish.

Duck into this inexpensive cafe on busy Leopoldsplatz for a breakfast of 
eggs and ham, a slice of pizza, or a lunchtime sandwich. I also recommend 
stopping for a slice of afternoon Kuchen (cake); the coffee (all you can 
drink for 2€/$2.70) is very good. Pete’s can’t be beat for cheap, quickly 
served food, although the atmosphere is like a fast-food restaurant.

Exploring Baden-Baden
When it comes to tourist destinations, Baden-Baden isn’t a demanding 
town, with major museums and important historic sights that you must 
see. (See the “Baden-Baden” map in this chapter.) The pace is relaxed, 
and the streets are geared toward pleasurable strolls and upscale shop-
ping. I recommend that you visit one of the bath complexes (see 
“Bathing in Baden-Baden” later in this chapter) and then spend a couple 
of hours wandering through the Altstadt.
 The City-Bahn (% 07221/991-998; www.citybahn.de) is a sightseeing 
train that makes stops at all of Baden-Baden’s major attractions. Kids are 
delighted by the open-air cars that snake through the city streets, pulled 
by a small truck. The train runs daily from 9:30 a.m. to about 5 p.m., 
making stops at the Kurhaus, Lichtentaler Allee, the Caracalla Baths, and 
other spots; the entire circuit takes about 45 minutes. Tickets cost 5€ 
($6.75) adults, 2.50€ ($3.40) children 5 to 15. English commentary is avail-
able on a headset.
The time-honored center of activity in Baden-Baden is Lichtentaler 
Allee, an elegant park promenade lined with rhododendrons, azaleas, 
roses, and ornamental trees set along the bank of the narrow Oosbach 
River (called the Oos; pronounced ohs). At the north end of the prome-
nade are the formally landscaped grounds of the Kurgarten and the 
neoclassical Kurhaus, one of the town’s most important buildings. 
Originally, the building was a “Promenade House,” where the rich and 
prominent came to see and be seen. In the 1820s, the Kurhaus was 
turned into a “Conversation House,” a place for more formal gatherings 
and events. The site has remained the hub of Baden-Baden’s social 
scene ever since, used for receptions and galas. The Kurhaus does not, 
as you may think, contain spa facilities; the right wing of the building is 
Baden-Baden’s casino (see the next paragraph), and the left wing houses 
a large, lavish restaurant with a terrace overlooking the gardens with 
their shop-lined colonnades, concert shell, and gas lights lit and extin-
guished by hand every day.
Marlene Dietrich, the glamorous German film star, once remarked, “The 
most beautiful casino in the whole world is in Baden-Baden — and I have 
seen them all.” You can see for yourself by visiting the famous Baden-
Baden Spielbank (Casino), Kaiserallee 1 (% 07221/21060), Germany’s 
oldest casino, in operation for more than 200 years. (The Russian writer 
Dostoevsky wrote The Gambler based on his disastrous experience at 
the tables here.) This casino is definitely not the kind of glitzy, informal, 
slot-machine-haven you find in Las Vegas. The various casino rooms 
were designed in the style of an elegant French château. Men must wear 
jackets and ties; women, classy evening wear. Guests can play French 
and American roulette, baccarat, blackjack, poker, and other games. 
Minimum bets are 5€ ($6.75). Maximum bets are 10,000€ ($13,500). To 
enter the casino, you must possess a valid passport and be at least 21 
years old. The casino is open for gambling daily from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
(until 3 a.m. Fri–Sat). Admission is 3€ ($4.05). Slot machines, a very 

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
328
recent addition, are located in the vaulted cellars of the Kurhaus in 
attractive new rooms, which also contain roulette, poker, blackjack, and 
bingo machines.
 
 If you don’t want to gamble, you can take a guided tour of the historic 
gaming rooms daily, every 30 minutes, between 9:30 a.m. and noon 
(10 a.m. to noon Oct–Mar). The tour costs 4€ ($5.40). Arrange in advance 
for tours in English.
In the Kurhaus gardens, you also find the Trinkhalle (Pump Room), 
Kaiserallee 3 (% 07221/275-200), a large hall built in the 1840s, sur-
rounded by an open walkway and decorated with frescoes depicting 
Schwarzwald (Black Forest) legends. The building, where guests once 
sipped the salty, slightly radioactive waters of Baden-Baden, now is used 
as the main tourist office (see “Finding information” earlier in this sec-
tion about Baden-Baden).
The Staatliche Kunsthalle (State Art Gallery), Lichtentaler Allee 8a 
(% 07221/300-763), completed in 1909, showcases visiting contempo-
rary art exhibits. Museum Frieder Burda, a new building designed by 
Richard Meier and opened in 2005, sits adjacent to the Kunsthalle and 
houses an impressive collection of modern paintings and sculptures 
(German expressionists, American abstract expressionists, late works 
by Picasso) bequeathed by Baden-Baden collector Frieder Burda. The 
two buildings are open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
A combination ticket good for admission at both museums is 12€ ($16) 
adults, 7€ ($9.45) students.
The Altes Schloss (Old Palace), a ruined castle originally called 
Hochbaden (High Baden), is located on a hillside above town. From the 
11th to the 15th centuries, Hochbaden was the seat of the margraves of 
Baden. You get a nice view of the town and the Schwarzwald (Black 
Forest) from this fortresslike structure. Admission is free.
Bathing in Baden-Baden
Getting into hot water is what Baden-Baden is all about. At the Caracalla-
Therme (Caracalla Baths), Römerplatz 1 (% 07221/275-940), you decide 
on your own bath regimen. The slightly radioactive water, rich in sodium 
chloride, bubbles up from artesian wells at a temperature of about 160°F 
(70°C). Bathers usually begin in cooler pools, working up to the warm 
water. The baths also have a sauna area. You must wear bathing suits in 
the pools, but the scene is au naturel in the saunas. Medicinal treatments 
include mud baths, massages, and whirlpools. The facility has a bar and a 
cafeteria. Admission is 13€ ($16) for two hours. The baths are open daily 
from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.
 
 Friedrichsbad, Römerplatz 1 (% 07221/275-920), dates back to 1877 and 
follows an ancient Roman-Irish bath method. The complete bath program, 
which takes about three hours, involves a shower, two saunas, a brush 
massage, thermal steam baths, and three freshwater baths ranging from 

 Chapter 17: The Bodensee and the Black Forest 329
warm to 60°F (15°C), followed by a 30-minute period of rest and relaxation. 
After experiencing the Friedrichsbad, you’ll better understand what Mark 
Twain meant when he said, “Here at Baden-Baden’s Friedrichsbad, you 
lose track of time in 10 minutes and track of the world in 20.” Admission 
is 21€ ($28) for three hours without massage, 29€ ($39) with soap-brush 
massage (31⁄2 hours). The baths are open daily from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. (last 
admission is 2 hours before closing). Note: Clothes may not be worn in the 
Friedrichsbad, and women and men share the pools.
Shopping in Baden-Baden
Sophienstrasse and Gernsbacher Strasse, lined with some of the most 
expensive boutiques in Germany, are part of a flower-flanked pedestrian 
zone. This is where you buy those elegant duds required to enter the 
casino. The women’s wear available at Escada Boutique, Sophienstrasse 
18 (% 07221/390-448), is created by one of Germany’s most emulated 
designers. Another shop, Münchner Moden, Lichtentalerstrasse 13 
(% 07221/31090), carries women’s designs in loden-colored wool during 
autumn and winter, and offers Austrian and Bavarian silks, linens, and cot-
tons during warmer months. The best men’s store, Herrenkommode, 
Sophienstrasse 16 (% 07221/29292), is a bit more international, focusing 
on designers Giorgio Armani and Renee Lazard.
Leather goods by Gold Pfiel and other manufacturers are sold at Inka, 
Sophienstrasse 26 (% 07221/23955), where the inventory includes lug-
gage, wallets, and handbags. Cuckoo clocks, puppets, and other locally 
produced items can be found at Boulevard, Lichtentaler Strasse 21 
(% 07221/24495). Schwarzwald Bienen-Honig-Haus, Langestrasse 38 
(% 07221/31453), carries beeswax- and honey-based products such as 
candles, cosmetics, candies, schnapps, and wine, plus many varieties of 
bottled honey.
Discovering the performing arts in Baden-Baden
Baden-Baden’s 2,500-seat Festspielhaus (Festival Hall), Beim Alten 
Bahnhof 2 (% 07221/301-3101; www.festspielhaus.de), opened in 
1998. The building is the second-largest opera and concert hall in 
Europe. The hall presents classical music concerts, operas, and ballets 
throughout the year.
Freiburg: Little brooks and lots of books
With a population of about 200,000 residents (and an additional 30,000 
students), Freiburg is the largest city in the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) 
and considered to be its capital. Only 111km (69 miles) southwest of 
Baden-Baden, this picturesque city with its medieval Altstadt nestles in 
a plain below high mountain peaks. The town is called Freiburg im (in) 
Breisgau to distinguish it from other German and Swiss Freiburgs. 
Breisgau, now part of the German state of Baden-Württemberg but once 
part of the Roman Empire, is a historical region stretching from the 
Rhine to the Schwarzwald (Black Forest).

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
330
Although surrounded by alpine scenery, Freiburg enjoys the benefits of 
warm air currents that come up from the Mediterranean through 
Burgundy. In the summer, the days can get very hot, but a cool moun-
tain breeze called the Höllentaler flows down into the town like clock-
work twice every night between 7 and 7:30 p.m. and 9 and 9:30 p.m., 
cooling things down. The Altstadt’s splashing fountains and shallow, 
fast-flowing streams called Bächle (little brooks) that run alongside the 
streets in stone-lined channels are ancient cooling systems. Freiburg 
bursts with springtime blooms while snow still covers the surrounding 
peaks, and in autumn, the smell of new wine fills the narrow streets even 
as snow is already falling on those nearby summits.
Wine? Yes, surrounding the city are 1,600 acres of vineyards, more than 
you find near any other city in Germany. And winegrowing always 
requires celebrations. In Freiburg, on the last weekend in June, a four-
day public wine-tasting festival takes place in the Münsterplatz, the 
square outside Freiburg’s magnificent Gothic cathedral.
 
 Festivals are a year-round part of life in Freiburg. Their pre-Lenten carnival 
called Fasnet is one of the best in Germany, with bonfires and parades. 
The May Frühlingsmess (Spring Fair) and October Herbstmesse (Autumn 
Fair) both last ten days. Weinkost is a long wine-tasting event in mid-
August. And in June, the city plays host to the two-week-long Zeltmusik 
Festival (Tent Music Festival), with performances in giant outdoor tents.
If you’re traveling in the Schwarzwald (Black Forest), Freiburg makes for 
an atmospheric overnight stay. Although the town was heavily damaged 
during World War II, including a bombing in error by the German 
Luftwaffe, Freiburg’s medieval charm has been preserved. Wandering 
through its ancient streets is a pleasure at any time of year, and explor-
ing the sights in the surrounding Schwarzwald (Black Forest) is easy and 
fun. The large student presence adds a lively, youthful edge to the Old 
City. (See the “Freiburg” map in this chapter.)
Getting to Freiburg
Frequent trains connect Freiburg to Baden-Baden and other cities 
throughout Germany and Europe. The train trip from Frankfurt takes 
about two hours; from Hamburg, about eight hours. For train informa-
tion, call German Rail at % 11861 or go to www.bahn.de.
For those coming by car, the A5 autobahn runs north–south through the 
Schwarzwald (Black Forest), providing access to Freiburg. If you’re driv-
ing from the Bodensee (Lake Constance), take B31 west.
Finding information
The tourist information office, Rotteckring 14 (% 0761/388-1880; www.
freiburg.de), is open Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. (until 
6 p.m. Oct–May), Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (until 2:30 p.m. Oct–

 Zum Roten Bären
$$–$$$ Altstadt
Zum Roten Bären, which means “At the Red Bear,” is the oldest inn in 
Germany, with a pretty painted facade and a list of innkeepers that goes 
back to the 14th century. This wonderfully atmospheric and unpreten-
tious inn has only 25 rooms and one of the best restaurants in Freiburg for 
traditional Schwarzwald (Black Forest) fare and regional wines from the 
nearby Kaiserstühl vineyards (see the next section, “Dining in Freiburg”). 
Rooms in the older section have more charm; those in the modern wing 
have little balconies overlooking leafy gardens and red-tiled rooftops. 
Standing just outside the hotel is one of Freiburg’s medieval gateways, and 
the surrounding neighborhood is wonderfully picturesque.

Dining in Freiburg
Oberkirchs Weinstuben

This historic wine tavern on Freiburg’s busy Münsterplatz (Cathedral 
Square) provides good regional cooking and comfortable rooms. You can 
dine in the Weinstube (wine tavern) with its ceiling-high ceramic stove or 
at a table on the square. This place serves hearty portions of good, old-
fashioned food: tasty soups (bean, pea, or vegetable), meat dishes (veal 
Schnitzel, pork filets in morel cream sauce), poultry, and seasonal dishes 
like venison. Above the Weinstube, 25 rooms all have private bathrooms 
or showers. Doubles range from 146€ to 176€ ($197–$238), including con-
tinental breakfast.

For outdoor summer dining, this Weinstube is the most picturesque and 
romantic spot in Freiburg. The tavern sits on a small square flanked by a 
rushing Bächle (little brook) and horse-chestnut trees. The good food 
arrives in extremely large portions. The chef’s daily recommendation may 
be cream of tomato soup, a salad with smoked lox, or tagliatelle with 
shrimp. This place is a good one for trying Zwiebel (onion) dishes, a spe-
cialty of the region. Zwiebelschmelze is a spinach-and-vegetable-filled ravi-
oli covered with sautéed onions. A simpler Vesperkarte (late-evening 
menu) is available from 10 p.m. to midnight.

The “Red Bear” has one of the best kitchens in Freiburg and one of the

sonal dishes, such as Spargel (white asparagus), available in May and 
June, or roasted goose, served in November and December. The 
Spargelpfannkuchen is asparagus served with a special pancake, cooked 
ham, and Hollandaise sauce. A young Rivaner wine, grown on the nearby 
Kaiserstühl vineyards, is a light, fruity accompaniment. The menu pres-
ents a full array of wonderfully prepared dishes using local ingredients.

Exploring Freiburg
Most of what you want to see is in the Altstadt, an area bounded by the 
Hauptbahnhof (main train station) on the west side of the inner city, the 
Dreisam River on the south, and a wooded hill called the Schlossberg on 
the east. This part of town is medieval Freiburg at its most appealing. 
Give yourself at least two hours to stroll and poke around. (See the 
“Freiburg” map in this chapter.)
All visitors eventually congregate in the Münsterplatz (Cathedral 
Square), site of Freiburg’s rose-colored Münster (Cathedral; % 0761/
202-790; Tram: 4, 5, or 6), one of Germany’s masterpieces of Gothic 
architecture. The cathedral was begun in 1200 in the Romanesque style, 
but by the time the structure was completed in 1620, Gothic elements 
had been incorporated into the design. Its West Tower, a magnificent 
openwork spire atop an open octagonal belfry, is one of the most beauti-
ful in Germany. Gargoyles peer down from the tower’s roof, one of them 
with its backside turned toward the archbishop’s house across the 
square, supposedly a sign of the architect’s contempt for the city

fathers. The cathedral contains some superb stained-glass windows; the 
earliest, dating from the 13th century, are in the south chancel. Admission 
to the cathedral is free. The building is open Monday through Saturday 
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday 1 to 6 p.m.
 
 For a wonderful view of Freiburg and the distant mountains, you can climb 
to the top of the Münster’s famous West Tower. The tower is open Monday 
through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m. (closed 
Mon Nov–Mar).
A trio of historic buildings stands along the south side of Münsterplatz, 
across from the cathedral. The mid-18th-century Erzbischöflisches 
Palais (Archbishop’s Palace) has a pale-yellow facade and an ornate 
wrought-iron balcony. The oxblood-colored Historisches Kaufhaus 
(Historical Merchants’ Hall), a Gothic customs and financial administra-
tion center with protruding, pointed-roof watchtowers and a 16th-century 
gallery decorated with the statues of four Habsburg emperors, is still 
used as the town’s official reception hall. The third building to the left 
of the Historisches Kaufhaus is the baroque Wentzingerhaus, built in 
1761 for a local painter and sculptor and now home to the Museum für 
Stadtgeschichte (Town History Museum; % 0761/201-2515), open 
Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admission is 2€ ($2.70).
Chestnut trees and a fountain add to the charm of Rathausplatz, another 
busy square just west of the cathedral. On the west side of the square is 
Freiburg’s Neues Rathaus (New Town Hall), comprised of two highly 
decorated 16th-century merchants’ houses connected by an arcade.
East of the university stands the Martinstor (St. Martin’s Gate), one of 
two surviving gates from the Middle Ages, when Freiburg was a walled 
city. The Schwabentor (Swabian Gate), the other city gate, dates from 
around 1200 and stands on the southeast edge of the Altstadt, near the 
Schlossberg. Paintings on the tower include one of St. George, the city’s 
patron saint. The neighborhood around the Schwabentor is called the 
Insel (Island) because rushing streams, called Bächle, surround it. The 
Insel is the most picturesque quarter in Freiburg, with narrow cobble-
stone streets and restored houses once used by fishermen and tanner-
ies. A 14th-century Augustinian monastery with a yellow baroque front 
houses the Augustinermuseum (Augustinian Friars Museum), 
Augustinerplatz (% 0761/201-2531), the chief attraction in the Insel 
Quarter. Inside you find a collection of religious art spanning more than 
1,000 years. Admission is free; the museum is open Tuesday through 
Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
From the Schwabentor, a pathway climbs up the Schlossberg, a hill that 
provides good views of the cathedral. You can also ascend the 
Schlossberg by cable car (% 0761/39855) from the Stadtgarten (City 
Gardens). The cable car operates June through September from 10 a.m. 
to 7 p.m., October through January from 11:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. The round-
trip fare is 3€ ($4.05).

 Chapter 17: The Bodensee and the Black Forest 335
Driving through the Upper Black Forest
From Freiburg, you can make an easy 145km (90-mile) circuit through a 
scenic part of the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) and be back in time for 
dinner. Along the way, you pass some of the forest’s highest peaks and 
two of its most beautiful lakes. (See “The Schwarzwald [Black Forest]” 
map in this chapter.)
From Freiburg, head south on Kaiser-Joseph-Strasse to Günterstal and 
follow the narrow, twisting road to Schauinsland. From the parking lot, 
you can climb 91 steps to an observation tower for a panoramic view 
toward the Feldberg, a nearby peak. The area also has easy hiking trails. 
Continue south to the hamlet of Todtnau, where you find a 1.6km-long 
(1-mile) footpath to an impressive series of waterfalls. (You need about 
an hour to get to the falls and back.) From Todtnau, pick up B317 west 
to Utzenfeld and follow the narrow road northwest to the Belchen, a 
famous mile-high peak. An enclosed gondola, the Belchen Seilbahn, 
Belchenstrasse 13 (% 07673/888-280), takes you to the peak for one of 
the most spectacular views in the Schwarzwald (Black Forest). From the 
grassy summit you can see the Feldberg and other nearby mountains, 
green hillside pastures, tile roofs in small villages, and the vast Rhine 
plain to the west. Give yourself about 90 minutes for the gondola ride 
and a stroll on the summit; the cable car operates daily from 9:30 a.m. to 
5 p.m. The round-trip costs 6.50€ ($8.80) adults, 4.50€ ($6.10) children.
From the Belchen, backtrack to Utzenfeld and follow B317 east to 
Feldberg, where another enclosed gondola, the Feldbergbahn (% 07655/
8019), takes visitors to the 1,450m (4,750-ft.) summit of a peak called 
Seebuck. The round-trip takes about an hour, and on a clear day, you can 
see the highest peaks of the Alps to the south. The cable car operates 
daily from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.; the round-trip ride costs 6.80€ ($9.20) 
adults, 4.80€ ($6.50) children.
Continue on B317 east and turn south on B500 to Schluchsee, one of the 
loveliest of the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) lakes. From Schluchsee, head 
back north along B500 to Titisee, another popular Schwarzwald lake. 
From Titisee, you can return to Freiburg by heading west along B31.
The Bächle of Freiburg
To help the town stay cool in the hot summer sun, Freiburg has many lovely old foun-
tains and a unique system of streams called Bächle (little brooks) that date back to the 
12th century. The brooks channel water from the Dreisam River through the old univer-
sity town. They were first devised to keep the city clean and to help fight fires. You can 
see the Bächle running alongside many Altstadt streets. According to local folklore, if 
you step in a Bächle, you will marry a person from Freiburg.

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
336
Discovering nightlife in Freiburg
The Konzerthaus (Concert House) plays host to a variety of events, 
ranging from classical music to theater to pop concerts. In June, huge 
tents house the annual Zeltmusik Festival (Tent Music Festival), which 
emphasizes jazz but includes other musical styles. Summer also brings a 
series of chamber-music concerts to the Historisches Kaufhaus, in 
Münsterplatz, and a program of organ recitals in the Münster, Freiburg’s 
cathedral (described in the “Exploring Freiburg” section, earlier). 
Information about all venues and events, including program schedules 
and ticket sales, is available from the tourist information office (see 
“Finding information” earlier in this section about Freiburg).
With some 30,000 university students, the city also has a thriving bar 
and club scene. Two clubs in one, Crash, Schnewlinstrasse 3 (% 0761/
32475; open Wed–Sat 10 p.m.–3:30 a.m.; Tram: 1, 4, or 5), serves drinks 
Time out: Buying a 
Schwarzwald cuckoo clock
Since 1667, when the first wooden clock was made in Waldau, clocks have been pro-
duced in the Schwarzwald (Black Forest). As early as 1840, Schwarzwald clocks were 
being shipped to China, Russia, Turkey, England, and America.
If you’re looking for a traditional timepiece to take home from the Schwarzwald, Triberg, 
48km (30 miles) northeast of Freiburg on B33, is a good place to go. In addition to cuckoo 
clocks, shops also sell woodcarvings, music boxes, and other traditional crafts. (Note: 
Triberg can be jammed with cuckoo-clock shoppers in the summer.)
You may also want to visit the Haus der 1000 Uhren (House of 1,000 Clocks), An der 
Bundesstrasse 33, Triberg-Gemmelsbach (% 07722/96300), located on B33 between 
Triberg and Hornberg. You can’t miss the shop: A giant cuckoo clock and water wheel 
are in front. Josef Weisser, a painter of clock faces, launched the business in 1824; his 
great-great-grandson is the current owner. The shop is open Monday through Saturday 
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The shop ships to the United States and Canada and takes American 
Express, Diners Club, MasterCard, and Visa.
Clock watchers with time on their hands may want to drive the Deutsche Uhrenstrasse 
(German Clock Road; www.deutsche-uhrenstrasse.de). Triberg is one of the 
stops on this 320km (200-mile) scenic route through the Schwarzwald from Villingen-
Schwenningen to Bad Duerrheim. Along the way, you find all kinds of museums and 
sights related to clocks. One of the most interesting museums on the route is the 
Deutsches Uhrenmuseum (German Clock Museum), Robert-Gerwig-Platz 1, Furtwangen 
(% 07723/920-117). In addition to the world’s largest collection of Schwarzwald clocks, 
the museum has timepieces from all around the world and from all epochs. The museum 
is open April through October daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., November through March daily 
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is 4€ ($5.40) adults, 2.50€ ($3.40) students.

and plays background punk, house, and funk; in the basement, Drifler’s 
Club (no phone; open Thurs–Sat midnight to 4 a.m.) plays house and 
techno for dancers. Neither club charges a cover.
Hausbrauerei Feierling, Gerberau 46 (% 0761/26678; Tram: 1 or 2), a 
brewpub with a popular beer garden across the street, is open daily 
from 11 a.m. to midnight.

Chapter 18
Heidelberg, Stuttgart, 
and Nuremberg: 
Castles and Kaisers
In This Chapter
▶ Visiting romantic Heidelberg
▶ Discovering the cultural delights of Stuttgart
▶ Exploring historic Nuremberg
I
 devote this chapter to three special cities in central Germany. 
Heidelberg, located on the Neckar River in the state of Baden-
Württemberg, is one of Germany’s most romantic cities. Nuremberg, or 
Nürnberg as it’s known in German, is a historic and very attractive city 
in the state of Bavaria. Both are castle-crowned cities worth visiting for a 
day or two. Stuttgart, the cultural center of this region, can easily be vis-
ited as a side trip from Heidelberg.
Heidelberg: Romance on the River
Heidelberg, on the Neckar River, 88km (55 miles) south of Frankfurt, is 
renowned for its castle and its university. (See the “Heidelberg” map in 
this chapter.) According to a song from the operetta The Student Prince, 
which is set in Heidelberg, summertime in Heidelberg is a time for music 
and romance. Today, summer is also a time when droves of visitors from 
around the globe invade this beautiful city. Many Americans know 
Heidelberg because of the nearby U.S. Army base.
Heidelberg is one of the few German cities that was not leveled by air 
raids in World War II, so you still can see original buildings from the 
Middle Ages, Renaissance, baroque, and neoclassical eras. This architec-
ture is certainly a major part of Heidelberg’s appeal. But some of its leg-
endary romantic allure stems from what was basically a 19th-century 
public-relations campaign. The looming ruins of the ancient castle, the 
old lanes and squares, the leafy hills and woodlands beside the Neckar,

and the youthful student population all had great appeal to the German 
Romantics. The great writer Goethe and many other poets, painters, and 
musicians “discovered” Heidelberg in the early 19th century. They 
praised the town in their writings and immortalized it in their music and 
paintings. The town came to symbolize old-world German Romanticism 
at its most picturesque.
Getting there
Heidelberg is easily accessible by train from all major cities in Germany 
and Europe. The train trip to Heidelberg’s Hauptbahnhof (main train 
station) is only one hour from Frankfurt and about three hours from 
Nuremberg. For train schedules and information, call Deutsche Bahn 
% 11861 or go to www.bahn.de.
Finding information
The tourist information office, Willy-Brandt-Plaza 1 (% 06221/19433; 
www.cvb-heidelberg.de), outside the main train station, is open 
Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. (until 6 p.m. Nov–Mar) 
and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (closed Sun Nov–Mar). The office has 
maps and brochures.
 
 The Heidelberg Card, good for two days and available for 14€ ($19) from 
the tourist information office and at many hotels, provides admission to 
Heidelberg Castle and discounts on attractions, walking and boat tours, 
and unlimited use of public transportation.
Taking a guided tour
A two-hour guided walking tour of the city departs from the Lion’s 
Fountain on Universitätsplatz at 10:30 a.m. daily (Mon–Thurs in German, 
Fri–Sat in English) from April through October, and only on Saturday 
from November through March. The cost is 7€ ($9.45) adults, 5€ ($6.75) 
students and children. Purchase your ticket from the tourist information 
office at the train station.
From April through October, guided bus tours of the city (in German 
and English), including the castle, depart from Universitätsplatz on 
Thursday and Friday at 1:30 p.m., Saturday at 1:30 and 4 p.m., and holi-
days at 1:30 p.m.; November through March the tour takes place only on 
Saturday at 1:30 p.m. The cost is 14€ ($19) adults, 10€ ($14) students and 
children. Purchase tickets at the tourist information office at the train 
station.
From Easter through October, Rhein-Neckar-Fahrgastschiffahrt 
(% 06221/20181; www.rnf-schifffahrt.de) offers daily guided boat 
tours (commentary in German and English) on the Neckar River between 
Heidelberg and Neckarsteinach. The round-trip tour lasts about three 

 Chapter 18: Heidelberg, Stuttgart, and Nuremberg 341
hours and costs 10€ ($14) adults, 6€ ($8.10) children. Boats depart from 
the landing stage near the Stadthalle (Conference Center), between the 
Theodor-Heuss-Brücke (bridge) and the Alte Brücke (Old Bridge). A 
shorter, 40-minute trip departs daily at 4 p.m. and costs 4.50€ ($6.10) 
adults, 3€ ($4.05) children.
Orienting yourself
Your first glimpse of “romantic old Heidelberg” as you emerge from the 
Hauptbahnhof on the west side of town may be disappointing. The city, 
like many in Germany and throughout Europe, has a modern and a his-
torical face, and the modern one is what you encounter first. Modern 
Heidelberg centers on Bismarckplatz (streetcar lines 1 and 2 run there 
from the train station), an area of tall buildings and shopping plazas. The 
Altstadt (Old City), to the east, is where you want to focus your sightsee-
ing activities. The Altstadt is a long wedge of slate-roofed buildings along 
the Neckar River, beneath Heidelberg’s Schloss (castle).
Hauptstrasse, a wide, busy pedestrian street with narrow medieval lanes 
on both sides, runs from Bismarckplatz into the compact Altstadt. The 
main squares in the Altstadt are Universitätsplatz, a focal point for famed 
Heidelberg University; Fischmarkt, dominated by the Heiliggeistkirche 
(Church of the Holy Spirit); the Marktplatz (Market Square); and the 
Kornmarkt. The Schloss crowns a hill to the south, above the Altstadt. 
Across the Neckar River is the Philosophenweg (Philosopher’s Way), a 
popular walking trail; a zoo; and a botanical garden.
Getting around Heidelberg
After you arrive in the Altstadt you can walk everywhere. However, the 
Altstadt is about a half-hour’s walk from the train station, so I recom-
mend that you take a streetcar or bus to Bismarckplatz or 
Universitätsplatz to begin your explorations.
Heidelberg is crisscrossed with a network of streetcars and buses oper-
ated by the local transportation department, HSB (% 06221/513-2000). 
Many bus and streetcar lines intersect at Bismarckplatz in the town 
center. Bus nos. 41 and 42 travel between the railway station and 
Universitätsplatz on the west side of the Altstadt. A single fare on the 
bus or tram costs 1€ ($1.35); a 24-hour pass, valid for up to five people 
traveling within a group, costs 8.50€ ($11.50). A Bergbahn (funicular; 
% 06221/22796) runs from Kornmarkt, in the Altstadt, up to the castle, 
between 9 a.m. and 7:40 p.m. daily; the round-trip fare is 4€ ($5.40) 
adults, 2€ ($2.70) children and students.

Das Hotel am Rathaus
$–$$ Altstadt
This hotel is one of Heidelberg’s nicest and most affordable. It’s located 
right in the heart of the city on the Marktplatz. The 17 rooms are small but 
very pleasant, with simple modern furnishings and tiled bathrooms with 
showers. Some larger rooms are suitable for families. The one potential 
drawback: The hotel doesn’t have an elevator.

east side of Marktplatz). Rack rates: 99€–154€ ($134–$208) double. Rates include 
breakfast buffet. AE, DC, MC, V.
 
 Hotel Hirschgasse
$$$–$$$$ North side of the river
Nestled on the hillside of a historic lane adjoining the famous 
Philosophenweg on the north side of the Neckar, this historic hotel enjoys 
a tranquil and romantic setting. The hotel dates from 1472 and has lodged 
such impressive figures as Mark Twain and Bismarck. The 20 rooms are 
all sumptuously comfortable suites equipped with shower-tub-whirlpool 
combinations in the bathrooms. The Mensurstube restaurant is one of the 
most historically atmospheric spots in town (see the “Dining in Heidelberg” 
section, later in this chapter). The Altstadt is a ten-minute walk from the 
hotel.

Hotel Zum Ritter St. Georg
$$$–$$$$ Altstadt
Located right on the Marktplatz on Hauptstrasse, the main street in 
the Altstadt, the Zum Ritter St. Georg is a well-preserved rarity from the 
German Renaissance. Built in 1592 as the home of a cloth merchant, 
the hotel is among Heidelberg’s sightseeing attractions thanks to its highly 
decorated, gabled facade. The hotel doesn’t have public lounges. Many of 
the 40 rooms are modest in size, but the beds are comfortable. Most of the 
rooms contain tiled bathrooms with shower-tub combinations. Although 
they have Romantic Altstadt views, the front rooms also can be noisy 
because of neighboring cafes and restaurants. The dining room special-
izes in duck breast and venison; the breakfast buffet costs 16€ ($22).

$$–$$$ Altstadt
This small (21 rooms), hip hotel, just a couple of minutes’ walk from the 
river, is connected to a microbrewery. The hotel has a cool, minimalist 
style. The medium-size rooms have light-colored hardwood floors and are 
furnished with comfortable beds and large wooden cupboards. Bathrooms 
are adequately roomy with tub-shower combinations; four rooms have 
showers only. Unfortunately, the hotel doesn’t have air-conditioning, and 
courtyard-facing rooms can be noisy in the summer, when tables are set 
up in the microbrewery’s beer garden. Even if you don’t stay here, you 
may want to dine at the on-site restaurant (see “Dining in Heidelberg” later 
in this chapter).

Dining in Heidelberg
 
 Die Kurfürstenstube
$$$$ Altstadt FRENCH
The best dining spot in Heidelberg is the wood-paneled Die Kurfürstenstube 
in the deluxe Der Europäische Hof-Hotel Europa. The menu is in English, 
but the cuisine is mainly French, with fixed-price and a la carte meals. The 
restaurant uses only the highest-quality seasonal ingredients. Look for 
culinary delights such as artichoke and grilled scallop salad with tanger-
ine essence, grilled medallion of herb-crusted beef, pheasant with bacon, 
roasted filet of lemon sole with chive sauce, and filet of turbot with celery 
on saffron foam with coriander tortellini. The dessert menu is equally 
scrumptious, and the wine list is the most impressive in town. The dining 
room closes for two months in the summer during which time the restau-
rant moves into the hotel’s garden room.

Exploring Heidelberg
Heidelberg is a wonderfully pleasant town to explore, and wandering 
through the old lanes and squares of the Altstadt is as essential a part of 
any tour as visiting the tourist attractions. The town has few must-see 
sights, and for many visitors there is only one: the famous Schloss 
(castle) that looks down on the Altstadt.
Visiting the top attraction
Heidelberg Castle
Most visitors reach the huge red-sandstone Schloss on foot, or by taking a 
two-minute cable-car ride from Kornmarkt (see “Getting around 
Heidelberg” earlier in this chapter). Walking is the most rewarding 
approach because of the constantly changing views of the town and sur-
rounding countryside. The easiest and most gradual path begins at the 

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
346
Klingentor; you also find a shorter, steeper path up Burgweg from 
Kornmarkt.
Set amid woodlands and terraced gardens, the enormous ruins of the castle 
are undeniably picturesque. Even in its deteriorated state, it is one of the 
finest Gothic-Renaissance castles in Germany, and one of the most famous 
historic monuments in Europe. Plan to spend about two hours here.
Entering at the main gate, you first come upon the Pulverturm (Gun 
Tower) and a terrace with views of Heidelberg and the Neckar Valley. The 
Elizabethentor (Elizabeth’s Gate), erected by Friedrich V in 1615 for his 
teenage wife (Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of the English king James I) leads 
to the bridge crossing the former moat.
Along the north side of the courtyard stretches the Friedrichsbau (palace 
of Friedrich IV), erected from 1601 to 1607 and less damaged than other 
parts of the castle. Its restored rooms can be seen on guided tours. The 
palace’s terrace offers a magnificent view of Heidelberg and the Neckar 
Valley. At the west end of the terrace, in the 16th-century cellars of the 
castle, sits the Grosse Fass (Great Cask). This enormous wine barrel, the 
largest in the world, was built in 1751 and once held more than 208,000 
liters (55,000 gallons) of wine.
To the east, connecting the palace of Friedrich IV to the Ottheinrichsbau 
(palace of Ottheinrich), is the shell of the Spiegelbau (Hall of Mirrors), 
constructed in 1549. Housed within Ottheinrich’s palace is the 
Apothekenmuseum (Pharmacy Museum; % 06221/25880), re-creating a 
baroque- and rococo-era chemist’s shop with utensils and laboratory 
equipment from the 17th and 18th centuries. The museum is open daily 
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; your castle entrance ticket includes admission.
The Hortus Palatinus (Castle Gardens) were laid out in the 17th century. 
In the southeast corner, you find the remains of a grotto and a sandstone 
sculpture of Father Rhine.
See map p. 339. Schlossberg. % 06221/872-7000. Admission: Castle grounds, free; 
entrance courtyard, Pharmacy Museum, and Great Cask, 3€ ($4.05) adults, 1.50€ ($2) 
children; 1-hour guided tours in English, 4€ ($5.40) adults, 2€ ($2.70) children; audio 
tours 4€ ($5.40). Open: Daily 8 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
The history of Heidelberg Castle
An elevated fortress rose above Heidelberg as early as 1225, but the castle as it stands 
today was built in two main phases. During the first phase, between about 1400 and 
1544, fortifications and living quarters were constructed. The second phase, from 1549 
to 1620, saw the transition from Gothic to Renaissance styles as various prince electors 
of the Palatinate added to the building. The castle was the residence of the prince elec-
tors for centuries until French troops sacked and destroyed it in the late 17th century. 
After it was rebuilt, the castle was struck by lightning. In the 19th century, the ruins of 
the castle became a symbol for the German Romantics and a mecca for tourists from 
around the world.

Touring the Altstadt
Marktplatz (Market Square) is the main square in the Altstadt. On 
market days (Wed and Sat), stalls of fresh flowers, fish, vegetables, 
cheese, meat, and baked goods fill the square. The Rathaus (Town Hall), 
on the east side of the square, is an early-18th-century building recon-
structed in 1908 following a fire.
The late-Gothic Heiliggeistkirche (Church of the Holy Ghost; no phone; 
open daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m.), built around 1400, dominates the west end of 
Marktplatz. For nearly 300 years, the church was the burial place of the 
Palatinate electors. In 1706, a wall was erected to divide the church 
between Roman Catholics and Protestants. The wall has since been 
removed and the church restored to its original plan.
The highly decorated Renaissance mansion, now the Hotel Zum Ritter 
St. Georg (see “Staying in Heidelberg” earlier in this chapter), stands on 
the south side of Marktplatz. A Huguenot cloth merchant who emigrated 
from France to Heidelberg erected the building in 1592. The hotel is 
named for the statue of the Ritter (knight) at the top.
A five-minute walk west from the Marktplatz on Hauptstrasse and south 
1 block on Grabengasse brings you to Universitätsplatz (University 
Square). On the northeastern side is the Alte Universität (Old 
University), a building from the 18th century, and at the south end of the 
square is the Neue Universität (New University), completed in 1932. 
Heidelberg University, founded in 1386, is the oldest in Germany.
A few steps past the Old University, you find the Studentenkarzer 
(Students’ Prison), Augustinerstrasse 2 (% 06221/543-554), where from 
1778 to 1914 generations of students were incarcerated in cramped cells 
for minor offenses. Graffiti and drawings, including portraits and silhou-
ettes, cover the walls and even the ceilings. Admission is 3€ ($4.05) 
adults, 2.50€ ($3.40) students and children 14 and under. The prison is 
open April through October, Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 
6 p.m. (until 4 p.m. Oct); November through March, Tuesday through 
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
A two-minute walk west on Hauptstrasse from Universitätsplatz brings 
you to the Kurpfälzisches Museum (Museum of the Palatinate), 
Hauptstrasse 97 (% 06221/583-402). Housed in a baroque palace, 
Heidelberg’s most noteworthy museum contains a large collection of 
regional painting and sculpture from the 15th to the 19th centuries. The 
one masterpiece on display is Tilman Riemenschneider’s 1509 wooden 
altarpiece showing Christ and the Apostles. You can also see an archae-
ological collection with a cast of the jawbone of the 600,000-year-old 
Heidelberg Man (Homo heidelbergensis), discovered in the vicinity 
nearly 100 years ago, and a section on the history of the Palatinate. Give 
yourself about 45 minutes to browse through the various exhibits. The 
museum restaurant (see “Dining in Heidelberg,” earlier in this chapter) 
is a good choice for lunch or dinner. Admission to the museum is 3€ 

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
348
($4.05) adults, 1.80€ ($2.45) students and children 17 and under. The 
museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Shopping in Heidelberg
The main shopping street is the traffic-free Hauptstrasse, where shops 
are open Monday through Saturday until 7 or 8 p.m. Gätschenberger, 
Hauptstrasse 6 (% 06221/144817), is known for its array of fine linens 
and embroideries for bed, bathroom, and table. Kaufhof, Hauptstrasse 
24 (% 06221/5040) is the city’s best all-round department store. A lively 
outdoor market is open on Wednesday and Saturday at the Marktplatz.
Living it up after dark in Heidelberg
The large student population keeps Heidelberg humming after dark. 
Early evenings often start in the bars along Hauptstrasse; late nights get 
rolling in clubs around Marktplatz.
The performing arts
The main performance stage is Theater der Stadt, Friedrichstrasse 5 
(% 06221/583-502; bus: 41 or 42), where nightly entertainment includes 
plays, opera, and dance productions. For five weeks beginning in late July, 
the Schlossfestspiele festival brings opera, classical music, jazz, and theater 
to venues around the area, including Heidelberg Castle. Contact % 06274/
58352 for tickets or visit www.schlossfestspiele-heidelberg.de.
Historic taverns
Heidelberg’s most famous and revered student tavern, Zum Roten 
Ochsen (Red Ox Inn), Hauptstrasse 217 (% 06221/20977), opened in 
1703. Revelers sit at long oak tables arranged in horseshoe fashion 
around a pianist. As the evening progresses, the songs become louder 
and louder. A mug of beer costs about 2.50€ ($3.40) and up. Meals go for 
10€ to 18€ ($14–$24). The tavern is open April through October, Monday 
through Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. to midnight, 
Sunday 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Next door is Zum Sepp’l, Hauptstrasse 213 (% 06221/23085), filled with 
photographs and memorabilia of old Heidelberg. The building dates 
from 1634. Meals cost 8€ to 13€ ($11–$17). A mug of beer goes for 3€ 
($4.05). A pianist performs nightly. It’s open Monday through Friday 
from 5:30 p.m. to midnight, Saturday and Sunday from noon to 2:30 p.m. 
and 5:30 p.m. to midnight.
A Side Trip to Stuttgart
Located in the Neckar Valley, 115km (71 miles) southeast of Heidelberg, 
Stuttgart is the capital of the federal state of Baden-Württemberg, but 
most of the people who live here still call the area Swabia. For more than 
a century Stuttgart has been a center of German industry, yet it remains

Stuttgart
surprisingly verdant, nestled in gently rolling hills with woods and vine-
yards reaching right down into the city. As a cultural center, Stuttgart 
has no equal in southwestern Germany. Visitors come from across the 
region to enjoy the city’s museums and performing arts. Stuttgart makes 
for a great day trip from Heidelberg. (See the “Stuttgart” map in this 
chapter.)
 
 A visit to Stuttgart can be even more enjoyable when you time your trip 
to coincide with one of the city’s major festivals. All of them take place 
right in the center of town on Marktplatz and Schillerplatz. At the Stuttgart 
Wine Festival in late August, wine lovers converge to taste a selection of 

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
350
more than 350 Württemberg wines and sample regional food specialties. 
The 16-day Stuttgart Beer Festival, the second largest in Germany after 
Munich’s Oktoberfest, begins in late September with a grand procession 
of horse-drawn beer wagons and people in traditional costumes. Dating 
back to 1818, the beer festival features food, rides, and tents for some 
20,000 beer drinkers. Starting in late November, Stuttgart plays host to a 
lively Weihnachtsmarkt (Christmas Market), one of the oldest and largest 
in Europe, with about 230 decorated stalls selling gifts, mulled wine, and 
cinnamon waffles. For dates and more information, visit the city’s Web 
site at www.stuttgart-tourist.de.
Getting to Stuttgart
By train, trip time from Heidelberg is only 40 minutes. For train sched-
ules and information, call Deutsche Bahn (% 11861; www.bahn.de). 
Access by car is via the A8 autobahn east and west or the A81 north and 
south. Stuttgart Airport (% 0711/948-3388), located 13km (8 miles) 
south of the city, serves as a major gateway to southern Germany. From 
the airport’s Terminal 1, you can take the S2 or S3 S-Bahn directly to the 
main train station in central Stuttgart.
Finding information and taking a tour
Located opposite the main train station, the I-Punkt tourist information 
office, Königstrasse 1A (% 0711/222-80; www.stuttgart-tourist.
de), is open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 
6 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (1–6 p.m. Nov–Apr).
The tourist office offers a 21⁄2-hour guided sightseeing bus tour (in 
German and English) daily at 1 p.m. from April through October, and in 
March on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays at 1:30 p.m. The cost is 18€ 
($24) per person. Ninety-minute city walking tours (in German only) are 
offered daily at 10 a.m. for 10€ ($14). Verify times and buy your tickets at 
the I-Punkt tourist information office.
Swabia: Stuttgart’s homeland
Swabia (Schwaben in German) is the name for a medieval duchy now contained within 
the federal state of Baden-Württemberg in southwestern Germany. The name comes 
from Suevi, the original inhabitants, who were conquered by the Franks in the fifth 
century a.d. With Stuttgart as its capital, Swabia has been a leader of German industry 
for decades, but the region also is renowned for its scenic countryside. To the north, 
the Schwäbische Wald (Swabian Forest) stretches to the Schwäbische Alb, a wedge 
of limestone upland south of Stuttgart. Forests sweep south to the Bodensee (Lake 
Constance), also part of Swabia, and west to the Danube River. The smaller Neckar 
River flows past Heidelberg and Stuttgart through a vineyard-covered valley.

 Chapter 18: Heidelberg, Stuttgart, and Nuremberg 351
Dining in Stuttgart
 
 Occupying a section of the Altes Schloss (Old Castle), Alte Kanzlei, 
Schillerplatz 5A (% 0711/29-44-57; U-Bahn: Schlossplatz), specializes in 
traditional Swabian dishes such as Maultaschen (pasta stuffed with ham, 
egg, spinach, or other fillings) and Zwiebelrostbraten (roast beef topped 
with onions). The restaurant has a cafe section where you can get break-
fast and lighter meals, or you can sit out on the terrace and have ice 
cream. Main courses go for 10€ to 20€ ($14–$27). The restaurant is open 
daily from 10 a.m. to midnight (until 1 a.m. Fri–Sat) and accepts American 
Express, Diners Club, MasterCard, and Visa.
Coffee, cake, and light meals are served at Café Königsbau, Königstrasse 
28 (% 0711/290-787), an old-fashioned Konditorei (pastry shop) and a 
new WiFi hotspot located in the colonnade of the Königsbau next to the 
new art museum. The cafe is open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 
7 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Exploring Stuttgart
From the train station, you can reach all the major attractions in the 
Altstadt on foot. (See the “Stuttgart” map in this chapter.) The Mercedes 
Museum and some other sights require the use of public transportation 
or a taxi. Stuttgart has a comprehensive S-Bahn system that links up with 
the U-Bahn (subway). Fares are based on zones; a one-way ticket costs 
1.90€ ($2.55) for one zone. A one-day ticket (Einzel Tageskarte) costs 
5.60€ ($7.55) for two zones. Purchase tickets from the automated 
machines in U-Bahn stations or from the bus driver. For information, call 
the city’s transportation authority VVS (% 0711/66060; www.vvs.de).

Museum of Württemberg), Schillerplatz 6 (% 0711/279-3400; U-Bahn: 
Schlossplatz), is one of Stuttgart’s oldest standing structures, first built 
as a moated castle in the 14th century and later redone in Renaissance 
style. Rebuilt after World War II, the castle now houses a state museum 
tracing the art and culture of Swabia and Württemberg from the Stone 
Age to the present. You’ll see prehistoric stone sculptures, the 
Württemberg crown jewels (in the royal vault), a large collection of 
Swabian sculptures, and treasures found in the tomb of a Celtic prince 
(circa a.d. 530). You can see the highlights in an hour or so. Admission is 
4.50€ ($6.10) adults, 3€ ($4.05) students. The museum is open Tuesday 
through Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 
 It’s worth a trip to Stuttgart just to see the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart 
(Stuttgart Art Museum), Kleiner Schlossplatz 1 (% 0711/216-2188; 
U-Bahn: Schlossplatz), which opened in spring 2005. Designed by Berlin 
architects Hascher and Jehle, the museum is a filigree glass cube sur-
rounding a rough-hewn limestone inner core. The new gallery houses the 
city’s collection of 19th- and 20th-century works by artists from southern 
Germany; the paintings by Otto Dix are particularly compelling. (The 
museum has the most important Otto Dix collection in the world.) The top 

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
352
floor, a cafe open to the public, provides a fabulous panoramic view of 
Stuttgart and its surrounding hills. The museum is open Tuesday through 
Sunday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 9 p.m. Wed and Fri); admission is 5€ ($6.75) 
adults, 3.50€ ($4.75) students.
 
 The Neue Staatsgalerie (New State Gallery), Konrad-Adenauer-Strasse 
30–32 (% 0711/470-400; U-Bahn: Staatsgalerie), the city’s finest art 
museum, exhibits works spanning some 550 years. Highlights include 
Giovanni Bellini’s The Mourning of Christ, Hans Memlings’s Bathsheba at 
Her Bath, and Rembrandt’s St. Paul in Prison. The New State Gallery, 
designed by the British architect James Stirling and completed in 1984, is 
considered an icon of postmodern architecture. In this section, you find 
the 19th- and 20th-century collection, with works of the German expres-
sionists Ernst Kirchner, Ernst Barlach, and Max Beckmann, in addition to 
representatives of the Bauhaus school and Blue Rider group, such as Paul 
Klee and Lyonel Feininger. Some famous examples of European art from 
the late 19th and early 20th centuries also are exhibited, including works 
by Modigliani, Picasso, and Monet. Art lovers will want to give themselves 
a couple of hours here. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday 
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 9 p.m. Thurs). Admission is 4.50€ ($6.10) 
adults, free for children 12 and under; it’s free to all visitors on Wednesday.
 Home to more than 9,000 animals and plants from around the world, 
Wilhelma, Neckartalstrasse, Bad-Cannstatt (% 0711/54020), is the larg-
est zoo and botanical garden in Europe. The park was laid out in 1848 and 
contains a collection of historical buildings in the Moorish style. The 
animal houses and greenhouses are open daily from 8:15 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
(until 4 p.m. Nov–Feb); admission is 11€ ($15) adults, 5.70€ ($7.70) chil-
dren 16 and under. To get there, take U-Bahn line 14 to the Wilhelma stop.
Autosprech (car talk) in Stuttgart
Stuttgart has long been a center for automotive research and manufacturing, and 
anyone who has an interest in cars — vintage or otherwise — will want to visit the 
city’s two excellent car museums. The Mercedes-Benz Museum, Mercedesstrasse 100, 
Stuttgart-Cannstatt (% 0711/173-0000), honors the invention of the motorcar by Carl 
Benz and Gottlieb Daimler. Nearly 75 historical vehicles are on display, including the 
first motorcycle (built in 1885) and the first Mercedes (1902). Give yourself at least an 
hour here; free audio-guides are available in English). To reach the museum, take 
S-Bahn line S1 to Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion, and then follow the signs to DaimlerChrysler 
Werk, Untertürkheim Tor 1 (about a 10-minute walk). The museum, open Tuesday 
through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., charges 8€ ($11) adults, 4€ ($5.40) students. The 
Porsche Museum, Porschestrasse 1 (% 079112-5685), which opened in 2008, displays 
a choice collection of these sleek, stylish cars, the oldest from 1948. Museum hours are 
daily 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. (until 5 p.m. Sat–Sun), and admission is free. To reach the museum, 
take the S-Bahn to Neuwirtshaus/Porscheplatz.

Stuttgart performing arts
 
 Even if you’re staying in Heidelberg, Stuttgart is so close (only 40 minutes 
by train) that you may want to consider spending an evening there at the 
ballet, opera, or concert hall. Listings of the various cultural events and 
tickets are available from the tourist office (see “Finding information and 
taking a tour,” earlier in this section on Stuttgart). The magazine Lift, avail-
able at newsstands, lists all the happenings around Stuttgart. Staatstheater 
(State Theater), Oberer Schlossgarten (% 0711/20-20-90; S-Bahn: 
Hauptbahnhof), is home to the highly regarded Stuttgart Ballet and the 
Staatsoper (State Opera). Classical and other concerts are given in the 
Liederhalle, Schloss-Strasse (% 0711/2167110; U-Bahn: Liederhalle/
Berlinerplatz), home to the Stuttgarter Philharmoniker and the Radio 
Symphony Orchestra. Tickets for all concerts are on sale at the tourist 
information office.
Shopping in Stuttgart
You’ll find department stores and boutiques lining Königstrasse, right 
outside the main train station. But for a special shopping experience, 
head to the Markthalle (Market Hall), Dorotheenstrasse 4 (U-Bahn: 
Schlossplatz), an Art Nouveau building dating from 1914 and full of stalls 
selling local and foreign delicacies.
 
 Serious shoppers, take note: Metzingen, a small town 35km (21 miles) 
south of Stuttgart and easily accessible by train, is the home of Germany’s 
best and most numerous factory-outlet stores. On and around 
Kanalstrasse, you find a selection of international designer outlets selling 
clothing, shoes, sports equipment, tableware, and more.
Classics of modernist architecture
Architecture buffs will want to pay a visit to Weissenhofsiedlung (Weissenhof Estate), 
a housing estate built for a building exhibition in 1927. Walking through the estate you 
see houses created by architects such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (Am Weissenhof 
14–29), Le Corbusier (Rathenaustrasse 1–3), and Hans Scharoun (Hölzweg 1). Many of 
the existing houses represent the functional style that was being promoted by the 
Bauhaus school of art and design. Displays in the small Architektur-Galerie, Am 
Weissenhof 30 (% 0711/257-1434; www.weissenhofgalerie.de), provide infor-
mation about the project and the architects involved; the gallery is open Tuesday 
through Saturday 2 to 6 p.m. and Sunday noon to 5 p.m.; walking tours are available on 
Saturdays at 11 a.m. (call first to confirm). To reach the Weissenhof Estate, take a taxi 
or the U-Bahn line 7 to the Killesberg-Messe stop and walk northeast around the Messe 
into the residential neighborhood. For a private architectural tour by an English-
speaking city guide/taxi driver, call Anselm Vogt-Moykopf at % 0172/740-1138 
(www.stadtrundfahrt-stuttgart.de).

 Chapter 18: Heidelberg, Stuttgart, and Nuremberg 355
Nuremberg: Renaissance and Rebirth
Nuremberg is located in Bavaria, 148km (92 miles) northwest of Munich. 
(See the “Nuremberg” map in this chapter.) This strikingly attractive and 
lively city has about half a million residents. Spending a day or more 
exploring its streets, churches, historic buildings, and museums defi-
nitely is worth it.
“Nourenberc,” as the city originally was known, dates back to about 
1050. In 300 years, the city grew from a fortress and military base in east-
ern Franconia (a medieval duchy of south-central Germany) to a virtu-
ally self-governing Freie Reichsstadt (Free Imperial City). From 1356 
onward, each newly elected emperor of the Holy Roman Empire had to 
convene his first Reichstag, or meeting with the princes of the empire, in 
Nuremberg. The city’s role as capital of the empire, and its location at 
the crossroads of major trade routes, made it one of the wealthiest and 
most important cities in medieval Germany. During the 15th and 16th 
centuries, a cultural flowering made Nuremberg the center of the 
German Renaissance.
But the city fell into decline until, under Hitler, Nuremberg made its 
second, and most infamous, mark on German history. To Hitler, the 
city’s architecture and previous role in the Holy Roman Empire repre-
sented the quintessence of Germany. After he seized power in 1933, 
Hitler made Nuremberg the Nazi Party’s permanent convention and rally 
site. As a result, no other German city, with the exceptions of Dresden 
and Berlin, suffered such wartime devastation. After the war, the Nazi 
war-crimes trials were held here.
In the postwar years, many of Nuremberg’s most important buildings, 
including some of the finest Gothic and Renaissance churches in 
Germany, were restored or reconstructed in the Altstadt, the historic 
center. Nearly every German city has a restored Altstadt, but few have 
been reborn with the kind of evocative grace and charm of Nuremberg’s. 
As you wander through the streets of this ancient capital of the Holy 
Roman Empire, you find reminders of Nuremberg’s brightest period.
Getting there
You can easily reach Nuremberg by train from anywhere in Germany or 
Europe. Travel time from Frankfurt is about 2 hours; from Munich, 1 
hour 40 minutes; from Berlin, less than 5 hours. For information and 
schedules, call Deutsche Bahn (% 11861; www.bahn.de). The city’s 
Hauptbahnhof (main train station) is within walking distance of all the 
major attractions.
For those traveling by plane, connections are available to Nuremberg’s 
small airport, Flughafen Nürnberg (% 0911/93700; www.airport-
nuernberg.de), 6km (4 miles) north of the city center, from major 
German and European cities.

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
356
By car from Munich, take the A9 autobahn north; from Frankfurt, head 
southeast along the A3 autobahn; and from Berlin, take the A9 autobahn 
south.
Finding information and taking a tour
The tourist information office, opposite the train station at 
Königstrasse 93 (% 0911/233-60; www.tourismus.nuernberg.de), is 
open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday from 
9 a.m. to 4 p.m. An additional branch at Hauptmarkt 18 (% 0911/233-
6135) is open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and 
Sunday (May–Sept and Dec only) from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
A guided 21⁄2-hour walking tour of the city center in English departs daily 
(May–Oct and Nov 28–Jan 6) at 1 p.m. from the tourist information office 
at the Hauptmarkt. The tour includes a visit to the Kaiserburg (Imperial 
Castle). The cost is 9€ ($12) adults, free for children 13 and under, plus 
admission to the castle. Buy your tickets from the tourist information 
office or from the guide.
 From mid-March through October and on weekends in November and 
early March, a small sightseeing train operated by Nürnberger 
Altstadtrundfahrten (% 0911/421-919) runs through the Altstadt, pass-
ing all the major sights on a 40-minute tour with commentary in German 
(English translations available). The train departs from the fountain in the 
Hauptmarkt in front of the tourist office several times a day from 10:30 
a.m. to 4 p.m. Cost is 6€ ($8.10) adults, 3€ ($4.05) children.
Orienting yourself
Nearly all that is of interest to the visitor is found in Nuremberg’s 
Altstadt, one of the most successfully restored historic city centers in 
Germany. Roughly oval in shape, the entire Altstadt lies within a double 
wall of medieval fortifications, parts of which still remain and have ram-
part walks and gateway towers.
The Hauptbahnhof lies on the southern perimeter of the Altstadt; 
crowning the northern periphery is the Kaiserburg, the old imperial 
castle. The small, picturesque Pegnitz River bisects the Altstadt. You 
find historic sights both north and south of the river. To the north lies 
the Hauptmarkt, the city’s main market square.
Getting around Nuremberg
Nuremberg’s Altstadt is almost entirely closed to traffic. Although the 
Altstadt is larger than the historic centers in many other German cities, 
all its sights are easily accessible on foot. In 30 minutes, you can walk 
from the Hauptbahnhof to the Kaiserburg through the heart of the city’s 
medieval core and past most of the historic monuments. Walking in the 
Altstadt is easier than using public transportation.

 Le Meridien Grand Hotel Nürnberg
$$$$ Altstadt
At one time, you could find “grand” hotels like this all across Europe. They 
were always close to train stations (because that was how most people 
traveled), and they were always the largest and most glamorous places to 
stay. Built before World War I, this grand hotel escaped destruction in 
World War II and consequently retains much of its unique Art Nouveau 
atmosphere and detailing. The guest rooms, the largest in Nuremberg, 
have spacious, marble-clad bathrooms. Children under 12 stay free in 
their parents’ room and baby-sitting can be arranged. Book on the hotel’s 
Web site for the lowest rates.

Dining in Nuremberg
Nuremberg is in a region called Franconia, known for its hearty and rela-
tively uncomplicated cuisine. The city is famous for its finger-size 
Rostbratwurst made of pork and various spices and then broiled on a 
charcoal grill. You may hear the sausage seller in an open booth on the 
street shouting, “Eins, zwei, drei . . .” (one, two, three . . .) and so on. The 
hungry consumer shouts back the number of bratwursts he wants. The 
locals consider fewer than 6 bratwursts a snack; people typically have 
up to 14 for lunch. Your bratwursts may come with sauerkraut or rye 
bread with very hot mustard. Seasonal game and fish dishes also are sta-
ples in restaurants serving Franconian fare. For two good, inexpensive 
cafes, see Café Treibhaus and Café Ruhestörung under “Living it up 
after dark in Nuremberg,” later in this chapter.
 
 Bratwurst-Häusle
$ Altstadt FRANCONIAN
The Bratwurst Häusle is the most famous bratwurst house in the city, 
located opposite the Rathaus and close to the church of St. Sebald. In 
winter, the open grill in the rustic, wood-paneled dining room warms you; 
in summer, you can dine on a leafy outdoor terrace. Come to sample origi-
nal Nürnberger Rostbratwurst (6, 8, 10, or 12 pieces), served on pewter 
plates. You can also get them zum mitnehmen (to go). A good beer to go 
with your Wursts is Lederer Pils, a beer brewed locally since 1468. Note: 
Those big, delicious-looking Brezeln (pretzels) on your table are not free; 
each one you eat will cost you about 6€ ($8.10).

Essigbrätlein
$$$$ Altstadt FRANCONIAN/CONTINENTAL
The city’s most ancient restaurant, dating from 1550, originally was a 
meeting place for wine merchants. Its upscale Franconian and Continental 
cuisine is inventive and refreshing, with many nouvelle recipes. Look for 
an ever-changing menu based on seasonal availability. The traditional spe-
cialty is Essigbraten, roast loin of beef marinated in vinegar. You’ll want to 
dress up a bit if you’re going to dine here.

Goldenes Posthorn
$–$$ Altstadt FRANCONIAN
No other restaurant in Nuremberg can match the antique atmosphere of the 
Goldenes Posthorn, which claims to be in the oldest wine house in Germany, 
dating from 1498. The restaurant’s kitchen features such old-fashioned but 
satisfying Franconian dishes as grilled bratwurst, Essigbratlein (beef mari-
nated in vinegar), zander filet with buttered potatoes, and liver dumpling 
soup. Daily specials and money-saving fixed-price menus are also available, 
as is a kids’ menu. The wine list features Franconian and Mosel wines.

 Heilig-Geist-Spital
$ Altstadt FRANCONIAN
Nuremberg’s largest historic wine house, in business for 650 years, spans the 
Pegnitz River and is an atmospheric spot to dine. The main dishes are typical 
Franconian fare, hearty and filling. Carp is a specialty, as are pork knuckles and 
Sauerbraten. In season, you can order leg of venison with noodles and berries. 
The wine list is abundant and excellent, with more than 100 vintages.

Kettensteg
$ Altstadt FRANCONIAN/INTERNATIONAL
This restaurant, bar, and beer garden beside the river in a romantic corner 
of the Altstadt is a real scene on warm evenings, when the tables fill up 
fast and everyone stays late, talking and drinking and eating under the 
trees. The menu is limited to just a few dishes, such as curried chicken on 
rice, wiener schnitzel with french fries, and bratwursts. Vegetarians can 
choose from vegetable lasagna or various salads. Kettensteg is a nice 
place to relax and have a good time.
Maxplatz 35. % 0911/221-081. Bus: 36 to Maxplatz. Main courses: 8€–13€ ($11–$18). 
No credit cards. Open: Summer daily 11 a.m.–11 p.m., winter daily 11 a.m.–2:30 p.m. 
and 6–11:30 p.m.
Exploring Nuremberg
You need at least one full day to explore the main attractions of 
Nuremberg, nearly all of which are found in the Altstadt. Most of the his-
toric core is for pedestrians only, so walking is a pleasure.
Albrecht-Dürer-Haus (Albrecht Dürer House)
Albrecht Dürer, one of the great German artists of the Renaissance, lived 
in this house from 1509 to 1528. Built in 1420, it’s the only completely 

 Chapter 18: Heidelberg, Stuttgart, and Nuremberg 361
preserved Gothic house left in Nuremberg. Typical of the well-to-do 
burghers’ houses of the 15th century, the structure has a first floor of 
sandstone surmounted by two half-timbered stories and a gabled roof. 
Exhibits inside the house are devoted to Dürer’s life and works. Furnishings 
in many of the rooms are important historical pieces, original etchings 
and woodcuts, and copies of Dürer’s paintings.
See map p. 357. Albrecht-Dürer-Strasse 39. % 0911/231-2568. Tram: Tiergärtnertor 
(then a 3-minute walk south on Albrecht-Dürer-Strasse). Admission: 5€ ($6.75) adults, 
2.50€ ($3.40) students and children ages 6 through 15; tours 2.50€ ($3.40). Open: Tues–
Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (until 8 p.m. Thurs), Mon (July–Sept only) 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; guided 
tours in English Sat 2 p.m.
 
 Germanisches Nationalmuseum (German National Museum)
Germany’s largest and most important museum of German art and culture 
is the one must-see museum in Nuremberg. It’s a huge place and not laid 
out in an intuitive way, so you need to choose your areas of interest and 
consult the galleries’ map frequently. The collection covers the entire 
spectrum of German craftsmanship and fine arts from their beginnings to 
the present day. The prehistoric and early historical sections contain 
finds from the Stone Age and from the burial sites of the Merovingians (a 
Frankish dynasty ruling from about a.d. 500 to 750). The extensive paint-
ing and sculpture sections include works by Renaissance greats Albrecht 
Dürer and Veit Stoss, a sculptor and woodcarver known for his “nervous” 
angular forms and realism. The world’s first globe, created by Martin 
Behaim, is on display, as is a self-portrait by Rembrandt. Everyday life in 
Germany through the ages is documented with domestic furnishings, folk 
objects, dollhouses, historic musical instruments, weapons, and the heal-
ing arts. Allow at least two hours for a visit here.
See map p. 357. Kartäusergasse 1. % 0911/13310. U-Bahn: Opernhaus (then a 
3-minute walk north on Kartäusergasse). Admission: 6€ ($8) adults, 4€ ($5.50) children 
and students. Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (until 9 p.m. Wed).
Hauptmarkt (Main Market Square)
The cobblestoned Hauptmarkt, just north of the Pegnitz River at the 
northern end of Königstrasse, is Nuremberg’s geographic and symbolic 
heart. Filled with stalls selling fresh flowers, fruits, and vegetables, the 
Hauptmarkt is the most colorful square in the city. In the northwest corner 
stands the Schöner Brunnen (Beautiful Fountain), an 18m-high (60-ft.) 
pyramid-shaped stone fountain from 1396. The 14th-century Frauenkirche 
(Church of Our Lady; % 0911/206-560; open Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun 
12:30–6 p.m.), on the eastern edge of the square, has on its facade a gilded 
16th-century mechanical clock called the Männleinlaufen (a hard-to-trans-
late word meaning “little men running”); every day at noon, figures of the 
seven electors appear and pay homage to Emperor Karl IV. The oldest 
part of the Altes Rathaus (Old Town Hall), on Rathausplatz just off the 
market square, dates from 1340; a later section, completed in 1622, marks 
the architectural transition from Renaissance to baroque style.

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany

Kaiserburg (Imperial Castle)
The Kaiserburg, looming above the city from its hilltop at the northern 
edge of the Altstadt, was the official residence of the German kings and 
emperors from 1050 to 1571. The oldest portion, the 11th-century 
Fünfeckturm (Pentagonal Tower), has been in ruins since a fire destroyed 
it in 1420. Watchmen and guards used the ramparts with their parapet 
walks and secret passages to protect the kings and emperors, who lived 
in the inner core of the castle complex. Most of the buildings were con-
structed during the 12th century. With their heavy oak beams and painted 
ceilings, the great Rittersaal (Knights’ Hall) on the ground floor and the 
Kaisersaal (Imperial Hall) on the second floor look much as they did when 
King Frederick III rebuilt them in the 15th century. The rooms are deco-
rated with period Gothic furnishings.
The council of Nuremberg erected another set of buildings in the 14th and 
15th centuries when its responsibilities expanded to include the protec-
tion of the emperor. The new buildings include the Kaiserstallung 
(Emperor’s Stables), now a youth hostel; the massive bastions of the for-
tress; the Tiefer Brunnen (Deep Well); and the castle gardens. A fine view 
of the roofs and towers of Nuremberg can be seen from its terraces. Allot 
at least an hour to explore the various nooks and crannies of the castle.
The Kaiserburg Museum (% 0911/2009540) contains antique weaponry, 
armor, and paintings, and explains the history of the castle.
See map p. 357. Burgstrasse. % 0911/2446590. Tram: Tiergärtnertor (then a 10-minute 
walk north, following signs). Admission: Combined ticket for all attractions 6€ ($8.10) 
Judgment at Nuremberg
If you’re interested in a famous landmark of World War II, visit the Schwurgerichtssaal 
600 (International Military Tribunal), Fürther Strasse 110 (% 0911/231-5421; U-Bahn: 
Bärenschanze), where the Nuremberg Trials took place. Here, in room no. 600, a spe-
cially remodeled courtroom, 21 of the surviving leaders of the Third Reich stood trial in 
November 1945 for crimes against humanity. Afterward, ten were hanged. The building 
still serves as a courthouse, so tours (in German only) are available only on Saturday 
and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. Admission is 2.50€ ($3.40). Note: The courthouse, including 
room no. 600, closed for repairs in 2008 and is scheduled to reopen in early 2010.
In November 2001, the huge Congress Hall designed by Hitler’s architect, Albert Speer, 
reopened as the new Dokumentationszentrum Reichsparteitagsgelände (Documentation 
Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds), Bayernstrasse 110 (% 0911/231-5666). I strongly recom-
mend a visit here because it provides a compelling overview of the rise of Nazism and its 
subsequent horrors. A glass corridor now pierces the upper level of Speer’s Congress 
Hall, which is larger than the Colosseum in Rome. The corridor houses an exhibition that 
chronicles the ruthless misuse of power under National Socialism. The center is open 
Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; 
the 5€ ($6.75) admission includes an audio-guide (English available). To reach the center, 
take tram no. 6 or 9 or bus no. 36, 55, or 65 to the Docu-Zentrum stop.

 Spielzeugmuseum (Toy Museum)
Nuremberg is a major toy center, and toys — both hand- and machine-
made — fill all three floors of this museum. Some date from medieval 
times. Exhibits include a large collection of dolls and old dollhouses, opti-
cal toys (such as peep shows, magic lanterns, and stereoscopes), and 
model railways and other miniature vehicles. Objects on the top floor 
illustrate the history of toys since 1945, including Barbie dolls and LEGO 
blocks. Kids can play with toys, draw, or do crafts in a supervised play-
room. You don’t have to be a kid, though, to enjoy this acclaimed museum. 
Give yourself at least an hour, more if you have kids in tow.
See map p. 357. Karlstrasse 13–15. % 0911/231-3164. Bus: 36 to Hauptmarkt (then a 
3-minute walk west on Augustinerstrasse and north on Karlstrasse). Admission: 5€ 
($6.75) adults, 2.50€ ($3.40) students and children. Open: Tues–Fri 10 a.m.–5 p.m., 
Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
St.-Lorenz-Kirche (Church of St. Lawrence)
The largest and most beautiful Gothic church in Nuremberg rises above 
Lorenzerplatz. The St.-Lorenze-Kirche was begun in 1270 and took more 
than 200 years to complete. Twin towers flank the west portal with its 
sculptures depicting the theme of redemption, from Adam and Eve 
through the Last Judgment. Inside, soaring pillars adorned with expres-
sive Gothic sculptures line the nave, and a magnificent stained-glass 
rosette window glows above the organ at the west end. The church con-
tains two more remarkable works: The Angelic Salutation (1519), carved in 
linden wood by Veit Stoss, hangs over the entrance to the choir, and, to 
the left of the altar, a stone tabernacle by Adam Krafft (1496) presents 
likenesses of the sculptor and two apprentices.
See map p. 357. Lorenzer Platz 10. % 0911/209-287. U-Bahn: Lorenzkirche (the church is 
on the square as you exit). Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 1–4 p.m.
Love that Lebkuchen
Lebkuchen (layb-koo-kin) is to Nuremberg what Marzipan is to Lübeck. The city’s been 
the capital of Lebkuchen since the early 15th century. These delicious honey-and-spice 
cakes evolved into their round shape in Nuremberg. While jealously guarding their reci-
pes, many places make and sell Lebkuchen. Lebkuchen Frauenholz, Bergstrasse 1 
(% 0911/243-464; U-Bahn: Lorenzkirche), sells Lebkuchen packed in containers resem-
bling half-timbered German houses. Many consider Lebkuchen Schmidt, 
Zollhausstrasse 30 (% 0911/89660; www.lebkuchen-schmidt.com), to be the 
best Lebkuchen store in Nuremberg. Lebkuchen makes a great, inexpensive gift.

St.-Sebaldus-Kirche
Consecrated in 1273, this church dedicated to Nuremberg’s patron saint 
represents the stylistic transition from late Romanesque to early Gothic 
styles. The nave and west choir are Romanesque; the larger east choir, 
consecrated in 1379, is Gothic. Between the two east pillars is a 16th-
century Crucifixion group dominated by a life-size Crucifix by Veit Stoss.
See map p. 357. Sebalderplatz. % 0911/214-2516. U-Bahn: Lorenzkirche (the church 
is on the square as you exit the station). Admission: Free. Open: Mar–May daily 
9:30 a.m.–6 p.m., June–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–8 p.m., Oct–Feb daily 9 a.m.–4 p.m.
Shopping in Nuremberg
Located across from the railway station, the Handwerkerhof (Craftsmen’s 
Courtyard; U-Bahn: Hauptbahnhof) is an enclave of half-timbered shops 
and stalls where artisans create and sell a wide range of handicrafts (along 
with touristy souvenirs). The shops are open weekdays (and Sun in Dec) 
from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Hofman, Rathausplatz 7 (% 0911/204-848; bus: 36), sells painted tin figures of 
soldiers and Christmas decorations. Steiff Galerie, Kaiserstrasse 1–9 (% 0911/
235-5075; U-Bahn: Lorenzerkirche), has classic and collectible Steiff bears.
From Advent Sunday to December 24, Nuremberg’s Hauptmarkt 
becomes the setting for the Christkindlmarkt, the oldest Christmas 
fair in Germany, held here for some 400 years. The fair transforms 
Hauptmarkt into a small town of wood-and-cloth stalls selling tree orna-
ments, handicrafts, candies, fruitcakes, Lebkuchen (see the sidebar 
“Love that Lebkuchen”), and Glühwein (hot red wine spiced with cloves 
and cinnamon). Performances by singers and musicians, as well as the-
ater, dance, and puppet groups, occur daily. The square is especially 
beautiful at night, when the surrounding buildings are floodlit.
Living it up after dark in Nuremberg
The Städtische Bühnen (State Theaters), Richard-Wagner-Platz 2–10 
(% 0911/231-3808; U-Bahn: Opernhaus), is a theater complex offering 
dramatic productions and opera. An artists’ and students’ hangout, Café 
Triebhaus, Karl-Grillenberger-Strasse 28 (% 0911/223-041; U-Bahn: Weisser 
Turm), opens early for big breakfasts (served all day) that run from 4€ to 
18€ ($5.40–$24) and offers soup, salad, and sandwich specials from 5€ to 7€ 
($6.75–$9.45) until 10:30 p.m. The cafe is open Monday through Wednesday 
from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m., Thursday and Friday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., Saturday 
from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m., and Sunday from 9:30 a.m. to 1 a.m.
Café Ruhestörung, Tetzelgasse 21 (% 0911/221-921; U-Bahn: Lorenzkirche), 
has a pleasant patio where you can order a drink or a sandwich. Sandwiches 
and light meals cost 4.50€ to 7€ ($6.10–$9.45). The cafe is open Monday 
through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 1 a.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 
9:30 a.m. to 1 a.m.

Cologne and the Romance 
of the Rhine
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the Rhine-side city of Cologne
▶ Enjoying a boat trip on the Rhine
▶ Exploring the warm wine country of the Rheingau
▶ Taking in the scenery of the lovely Mosel Valley
T
he Rhine is one of the world’s great rivers. Some 1,320km (820 miles) 
long, the river originates in southeastern Switzerland, flows through 
the Bodensee (Lake Constance; see Chapter 17), and forms Germany’s 
southwestern boundary as it continues west, north, and northwest to the 
North Sea.
 
 Through the centuries, the Rhine has inspired many legends, the most 
famous being the one attached to a high rock called the Lorelei (also 
spelled Loreley) towering above the town of St. Goarshausen. Lorelei, so the 
story goes, was a beautiful young woman who threw herself into the Rhine 
in despair over a faithless lover. Transformed into a siren, she sat on the 
rock combing her long, blond hair and taking out her revenge by luring fish-
ermen and ship captains to their destruction. The Rhine also is at the musi-
cal heart of Richard Wagner’s four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen.
For about two centuries now, the mighty Rhine has attracted visitors 
from around the world, who come to enjoy the romantic scenery of 
hilltop castles, medieval towns, and vineyard-covered slopes. The 
Rhineland, the area along the river’s west bank, encompasses roughly 
23,000 sq. km (9,000 sq. miles) and is a treasure-trove for tourists. (See 
“The Rhineland” map in this chapter.)
In this chapter, I give most of the coverage to Cologne, the Rhineland’s 
largest and most important city. Sitting right on the river, this city 
makes a wonderful headquarters for exploring the Rhineland. From 
Cologne, you can drive into the Rheingau, a lovely winegrowing section 
of the Rhine Valley from Koblenz south to Alsace. And although not as 
grand and legend-filled as the Rhine, the Mosel Valley, covered with 
meticulously tended vineyards, is also worth exploring. I describe the 
highlights of all these side trips later in this chapter.

Cologne: Pleasures beside the Rhine
Visitors to this lively metropolis on the Rhine, Germany’s fourth-largest 
and oldest city, are immediately struck by Cologne’s cheek-by-jowl juxta-
position of the very old with the very new. You can see Roman ruins in 
an underground parking garage, a dizzyingly ornate Gothic cathedral 
beside a modern museum complex, and a humble Romanesque church 
wedged in among luxury shops. On a ten-minute walk in Cologne, you 
can traverse 2,000 years of history.
Cologne (pronounced koeln) offers far more than just Germany’s largest 
cathedral, although that is spectacular and reason enough to visit. The 
range of Cologne’s museums and the quality of their collections make it 
one of the outstanding museum cities of Germany. Music, whether it’s a 
symphony concert in the modern philharmonic hall, an opera at the 
highly regarded opera house, or a boisterous outdoor concert in the 
Rheinpark, is likewise a vital component of life here. The city also is 
famous as the birthplace of eau de Cologne.
Cologne traces its beginnings to 38 b.c., when Roman legions set up 
camp here. As early as a.d. 50, the emperor Claudius gave the city 
municipal rights as capital of a Roman province. In addition to its sub-
stantial Roman legacy, the city boasts 12 major Romanesque churches. 
Older than the cathedral, the churches drew medieval pilgrims from all 
across Europe to “Holy Cologne,” one of the most important pilgrimage 
cities in medieval Christendom.
Like Munich, Cologne is a city that likes to have fun, and a huge student 
population keeps it buzzing and vital. The Kölner themselves are refresh-
ingly relaxed and down-to-earth in how they enjoy their city. Every year 
they welcome millions of visitors, many of whom come to attend the giant 
international trade fairs held in the Cologne Messe, or trade-fair grounds. 
Ancient traditions are annually renewed in the city’s raucous pre-Lenten 
Carnival (called Fasching), a time of masked balls, parades, and general 
delirium. When the weather turns warm, visitors and citizens alike stroll 
along the Rhine promenades and flock to outdoor taverns and restaurants 
to enjoy the pleasures of a Kölsch, Cologne’s unique and delicious beer, 
and a substantial meal of typical Rhineland cuisine.
Celebrating carnival in Cologne
Cologne’s Carnival, the city’s “fifth season,” is one of the most eagerly anticipated 
events in Germany. The season officially lasts from New Year’s Eve to Ash Wednesday. 
The city buzzes with masked balls, parades, and general delirium. Natives call this city-
wide celebration Fasteleer or Fastelovend.

Getting there
Cologne is one of the major cities in western Germany, and getting there 
is easy by train, car, or plane.
By plane
Cologne’s airport, Konrad-Adenauer-Flughafen Köln/Bonn (% 02203/
40-40-01; www.airport-cgn.de), is located 14km (9 miles) southeast 
of the city. Direct flights arrive from most major European cities. The 
fastest and simplest way to get into the city is by taking an S-Bahn train 

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
368
(S-13) from the new airport train station directly to the Cologne main 
train station. It runs from 5 a.m. to nearly 2 a.m. The trip takes 20 min-
utes; the fare is 3€ ($4.05). A taxi from the airport to the city center 
costs about 25€ ($34).
By train
Cologne is a major rail hub, so reaching the city from anywhere in 
Germany or the rest of Europe is easy. Frequent daily trains arrive from 
Berlin (51⁄2 hours), Frankfurt (21⁄2 hours), and Hamburg (41⁄2 hours). The 
Cologne Hauptbahnhof is in the heart of the city, next to the cathedral. 
For train information and schedules, call German Rail at % 11861 or 
visit www.bahn.de.
By car
Cologne is easily reached from major German and European cities. The 
A3 autobahn connects the city to the north and south, while the A4 
autobahn travels east and west.
Finding information
The Köln Tourismus Office, Kardinal-Höffner-Platz 1 (% 0221/221-
30400; www.koeln.de/tourismus; U-Bahn: Hauptbahnhof), is located 
just a few steps from the cathedral. The office has city maps, a room-rental 
service, and information on city attractions. The office is open Monday 
through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Getting oriented
The major sights of Cologne, including the mighty cathedral and the 
most important museums, are located in the Altstadt (Old City), the 
restored and much altered medieval core of the city. The Altstadt 
spreads in a semicircle west from the Rhine to a ring road that follows 
the line of the 12th-century city walls (demolished, except for three gate-
ways, in the 19th century). (See the “Cologne” map in this chapter.) The 
center of the Altstadt is the Innenstadt (inner city), the historical heart 
of Cologne, where the Romans built their first walled colony.
The ring road and a greenbelt in the southwest (the location of the uni-
versity) girdle Neustadt, the “new” part of town dating from the 19th 
century. The area across the river, on the Rhine’s east bank, is called 
Deutz. Besides providing the best views of the cathedral-dominated 
Cologne skyline, Deutz is where you find the Cologne Messe (trade-fair 
grounds) and the Rhinepark. The city’s early industrial plants were con-
centrated in Deutz, and many of them are still there.
Getting around
The compact and pedestrian-friendly Altstadt, where you find the cathe-
dral and most of the major attractions, is easily explored on foot. The 
city also has an excellent bus, tram, U-Bahn (subway), and S-Bahn

(light-rail) system. A CityTicket, good for a single one-way fare within 
the inner city is 1.50€ ($2) adults, 0.75€ ($1) children. A day ticket, the 
Kölner Tageskarte, costs 8€ ($11) and enables you to travel throughout 
the city’s transportation network (but the Cologne Welcome Card, 
described under “Exploring Cologne,” later in this chapter, is a better 
deal because it includes public transportation and free or reduced-price 
entry to museums and other attractions). Purchase tickets from the 
automated machines (labeled fahrscheine), from bus drivers, or at the 
stations. Be sure to validate your ticket; validation machines are in sta-
tions and on buses. For information about public transportation, call 
VRS at % 01803/504-030.
Taxi meters start at 2.50€ ($3.40), plus 1€ ($1.35) if you hail a taxi 
from the street; the fare rises 1.35€ to 1.65€ ($1.80–$2.25) per kilometer 
thereafter, depending on time of day. To order a taxi, call Taxi-Ruf at 
% 0221/19410.
Staying in Cologne
Also see Chapter 22 for details on Cologne’s premier hotel, Excelsior 
Hotel Ernst ($$$$).
 
 Das Kleine Stapelhäuschen
$–$$ Altstadt
The two town houses that make up this hotel stand on a corner of a his-
toric square, right on the Rhine in the busiest section of the Altstadt. From 
the wine restaurant on the ground floor (see “Dining in Cologne,” later in 
this chapter), you climb up a curving, wooden staircase (or take the eleva-
tor) to your room. The 31 rooms are fairly basic but comfortable and not 
lacking in a kind of old-fashioned charm; some rooms have beamed ceil-
ings. Each of ten units comes with a small, tiled bathroom with shower.

buffet breakfast.
Hotel Engelbertz
$ Altstadt
This modest, family-run hotel is in a central location close to everything 
in the Altstadt. The hotel has 40 rooms, all with small bathrooms that have

Hyatt Regency Köln
$$–$$$$ Deutz
Located in Deutz, a ten-minute walk across the Rhine from the train sta-
tion, this modern full-service hotel has a pleasant but somewhat corpo-
rate-looking ambience and is a favorite of business travelers coming to the 
many trade shows held at the adjacent Cologne Messe. The 305 rooms are 
comfortably large and stylishly furnished. Many have views across the

range, the Excelsior Hotel Ernst (see Chapter 22) offers far more in terms 
of amenities, style, and charm.

Dining in Cologne
Although several highly rated restaurants have established themselves 
here in recent years, Cologne is not a city particularly known for its 
gourmet dining. Rather, it’s a place for conversation and drinking, gener-
ally over enormous portions of typical Rhineland fare in crowded restau-
rants that are gemütlich (cozy) rather than elegant.
To eat and drink as the Kölner do, visit one of the city’s old tavern-res-
taurants (see listings for Früh am Dom and Bräuhaus Sion, later in this 
section). Local dishes at these and other nongourmet restaurants gener-
ally include Halver Hahn (a rye bread roll with Dutch cheese), Tatar 
(finely minced raw beef mixed with egg yolk, onions, and spices and 
served on bread or a roll), Kölsch Kaviar (smoked blood sausage served 
with raw onion rings), Matjesfilet mit grünen Bohnen (pickled white her-
ring served with green butter beans and potatoes), Hämchen (cured 
pork knuckle cooked in vegetable broth), Himmel und Äd (apples and 
potatoes boiled and mashed together and served with fried blood sau-
sage), and Speckpfannekuchen (pancakes fried in smoked bacon fat).

Bräuhaus Sion
$$ Altstadt KÖLNER/GERMAN
If you want a traditional local Bräuhaus where the beer is good, the wood 
paneling a little smoky with time, and the food portions inexpensive and 
generous, Sion is the place. The main courses are traditional and filling 
Rhineland fare, such as Riesenhämchen (boiled pigs’ knuckles) with sau-
erkraut, Bockwurst (sausage) with potato salad, or Sauerbraten (pot- or 
oven-roasted marinated beef) with an almond-raisin sauce. Sion also has 
a few rooms upstairs that it rents out; a double with bathroom and break-
fast goes for 60€ ($81).

Das Kleine Stapelhäuschen
$–$$ Altstadt GERMAN
This popular wine restaurant (and hotel, see “Staying in Cologne” earlier 
in this chapter) opens onto the old fish-market square and the Rhine, just 
a few minutes’ walk from the cathedral. Although the wine is the main 
reason for coming (the local Rhine wines are that special), the cuisine also 
is very good. You may start with escargots, marinated herring, or stuffed 
mushrooms. Fish main courses include roasted pikeperch on lentils with 
balsamic vinegar and salmon poached in Rhine wine. A Rhineland meat 
specialty is Sauerbraten with almonds, raisins, and potato dumplings. The 
menu also includes vegetarian and pasta dishes.

Kölsch: Cologne’s beer of choice
Even if you don’t like beer, you’ll probably like Kölsch, a dry, delicious, top-fermented 
beer that’s brewed only in Cologne. Kölsch has an alcohol content of about 3 percent. 
(Most other types of German beer have an alcohol content ranging from 4 percent to 6 
percent.) If you go to any of the taverns in town, you can order a Kölsch from one of the 
blue-aproned waiters, called a Köbes. The waiters always serve the beer in a tall, thin 
glass, called a Stangen, which they bring to your table in a special carrier called a 
Kölschkranz. Expect to pay about 1.50€ ($2) for a small glass of Kölsch on tap.

Früh am Dom
$$ Altstadt KÖLNER/GERMAN
This Bräuhaus is the best all-around for atmosphere, economy, and hearty 
portions. You can eat in the upstairs or downstairs dining rooms (upstairs, 
on the ground floor, is better), with a different German specialty offered 
every day of the week. (A menu in English is available.) A favorite dish is 
Hämchen, a Cologne specialty of smoked pork knuckles served with sau-
erkraut and potato purée. Other specialties include Sauerkrautsuppe (sau-
erkraut soup) and Kölsch Kaviar (blood sausage with onion rings). 
Früh-Kölsch, the tavern’s beer on tap, has a 1,000-year-old brewing tradi-
tion. In summer, this tavern also has a beer garden.

 Hanse Stube
$$$–$$$$ Altstadt FRENCH
One of Cologne’s top gourmet restaurants, Hanse Stube offers excellent 
cuisine and service in quiet, elegant surroundings. The menu changes 
daily but may include confit of halibut or goose liver and apple pâté for 
starters. Outstanding main courses include codfish filet on champagne-
saffron spume, medallions of lamb with spinach and roasted tomato

This Bräuhaus, on a narrow street set back from the Rhine, is a good 
choice for atmospheric dining. A step-gabled inn with a black-and-white 
timbered facade, it dates from 1626. The restaurant serves many Rhineland

Exploring Cologne
You find the cathedral and all the major museums in the Innenstadt, the 
roughly half-square-mile area of the original Roman colony. After a day 
of sightseeing, round off your visit with an evening stroll along the Rhine 
promenade in Deutz. Note: Museums in Cologne are generally closed on 
Monday.
 
 The Cologne Welcome Card, available from the tourist office, is good for 
travel on all forms of public transportation and gets you into most muse-
ums for free or at a reduced cost. A one-day card costs 9€ ($12), a two-day 
card costs 14€ ($19), and a one-day family/group card good for two adults 
and two children or three adults costs 18€ ($24).
 
 Dom (Cathedral)
Considering how much time passed during the building of this gigantic 
edifice, the largest cathedral in northern Europe, it’s a wonder that the 
Gothic facade is stylistically coherent. More than 600 years elapsed from 
the laying of the cornerstone in 1248 to the placement of the last finial (a 
decorative element) on the south tower in 1880. Upon completion, the 
Cologne cathedral was the tallest building in the world, its twin filigreed 
spires rising to a height of 157m (515 ft.). Overwhelming is the simplest 
way to describe it.
The Dreikönigschrein (Shrine of the Three Magi), housed in a glass case 
at the end of the choir, is the cathedral’s major treasure. The giant reli-
quary is a masterpiece of goldsmith work dating from the end of the 12th 
century. The choir, which can be visited only on guided tours, is the most 
important part of the cathedral. Consecrated in 1322, the choir contains 
original, richly carved oak stalls, screen paintings, and a series of statues 
made in the cathedral workshop between 1270 and 1290. The famous 
Three Kings windows in the clerestory (the area above the nave) were 
installed in the early 14th century. In addition to some magnificent 

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
376
Renaissance-era stained-glass windows in the north aisle, the cathedral 
really has only two other must-see treasures. The Gero Cross, hanging in 
a chapel on the north side of the choir, is a rare monumental sculpture 
carved in Cologne in the late tenth century and reputedly the oldest-exist-
ing large-scale crucifix in the Western world. On the south side of the 
choir is Stephan Lochner’s altarpiece, Adoration of the Magi, created 
around 1445. The painting is a masterpiece of the Cologne school — Italian 
in format, Flemish in the precision of its execution.
The cathedral’s Schatzkammer (treasury) is rather disappointing, and 
you aren’t missing much if you skip it. If, on the other hand, you’re in rea-
sonably good shape, you can climb the 509 stairs of the 14th-century 
south tower (entry through the Portal of St. Peter) for an inspiring view of 
the city and the Rhine.
You can make a circuit of the interior in about half an hour; the guided 
tours last one hour.

 Kölner-Seilbahn (Cologne Cable Car)
You get the best panoramic view of the city of Cologne by taking the 
Kölner Seilbahn, the first and only cable-car system in Europe designed to 
span a major river. In operation since 1957, the enclosed gondolas cross 
the river beside the Zoobrücke (Zoo Bridge) between the Rheinpark in 
Deutz and the zoo. You get a great view of the cathedral and the river traf-
fic along the Rhine. The trip takes about 15 minutes each way.

Museum für Angewandte Kunst (Museum of Applied Art)
The treasures on display in this museum include furniture, home décor, 
and handicrafts from the Middle Ages to the present day. The Art Nouveau 
room is particularly impressive. On the ground floor and mezzanine, the 
exhibits, exclusively from the 20th century, include rooms and furniture 
by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, German architect Mies van der Rohe, and 
the American designer Charles Eames, among others. Give yourself about 
an hour to see everything.

Museum Ludwig
This museum, dedicated to 20th-century and contemporary art, opened 
in 1986. Exhibits represent nearly every major artist and art movement of 
the 20th century. The Agfa-Foto-Historama, a museum within the museum, 
is devoted to the history of photography. Give yourself at least an hour, 
more if you love modern art.

 Römisch-Germanisches Museum (Roman-Germanic Museum)
Cologne’s history, and the fabric of the city today, is inextricably bound 
with the history of Rome — a legacy that is documented in this fascinating 
museum. Before you enter, look at the section of the Roman North Gate 
preserved on Domplatz in front of the cathedral; on the right side of the 
museum is Hafenstrasse, a street paved with its original stones, which 
once ran down to the Roman harbor. Portions of an original Roman wall 
still stand beneath Domplatz in the underground parking lot.
The Roman-Germanic Museum was built around the magnificent Dionysius 
mosaic, produced in a Rhineland workshop in the third century and dis-
covered in 1941 by workers digging an air-raid shelter. Towering over the 
mosaic, which extols the joys of good living, is the tomb of Lucius 
Poblicius, constructed around a.d. 40 for a Roman officer; it is the largest 
antique tomb ever found north of the Alps.
The exhibits explore themes or types: religious life, trade and industry, 
the cult of the dead, and so on. The museum covers the period that 
extends from the Stone Age to the period of Charlemagne (9th century). 
On the second floor, you can see a superlative collection of Roman glass-
ware and a world-renowned collection of Roman jewelry. On the lowest 
level, devoted to the daily life of the Romans, you find an ancient black-
and-white mosaic floor covered with swastikas. Centuries before the 
symbol became ominously identified with the atrocities of the Third 
Reich, the swastika — probably Indian in origin — was a symbol of good 
luck and happiness, and was known in Latin as the crux gamata. You need 
at least an hour to browse through the entire museum.
The Roman city of Colonia
By 50 b.c., Julius Caesar had extended the borders of the Roman Empire as far as the 
Rhine and established an alliance with the Germanic Ubii tribe on the site of present-
day Cologne. The area became a military garrison with an imperial shrine and eventu-
ally was granted rights as a Roman city called Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium 
(CCAA) in a.d. 50. Cologne’s Roman period lasted until a.d. 401, when the Roman legions 
were recalled from the Rhine frontier.

Schnütgen Museum
The Romanesque church of St. Cäcilien (St. Cecilia, patron saint of music) 
houses one of Cologne’s finest art collections. Try not to miss this small, 
splendid sampling of sacred art from the early Middle Ages to the baroque. 
The relics, reliquaries, crucifixes, and sculpture on display give you an 
idea of the artistic blessings bestowed upon “Holy Cologne.” Outside, 
around the back, a skeleton has been spray-painted on the walled-in west-
ern portal of the church. Called simply Tod (Death), this oddly engaging 
work is by the Zurich graffiti artist Harald Nägele.

 Wallraf-Richartz Museum
The Wallraf-Richartz Museum is one of the country’s greatest repositories 
of art from the Middle Ages to the late 19th century. Opened in 1861, the 
museum also is one of Germany’s oldest. In 2000, the museum moved to a 
new building designed by Cologne architect Oswald Mathias Ungers. The 
new museum nicely shows off the art but somehow feels like an office 
building from the 1950s.
On the first floor, you find an outstanding collection of paintings by the 
medieval Cologne school (most done between 1330 and 1550). Many of the 
paintings and altarpieces depict legends from the lives of martyred saints 
who became identified with the “Holy Cologne” of the Middle Ages. The 
Renaissance section includes works by Albrecht Dürer and Lucas Cranach. 
A memorable collection of 17th-century Dutch and Flemish paintings 
holds pride of place on the second floor. Here you find Rubens’s Self-
Portrait Amidst the Circle of Friends from Mantua. In addition to important 
French and Spanish works, the museum boasts a rich collection of 19th-
century paintings, with major pieces by the German Romantic painter 
Caspar David Friedrich, Gustave Courbet, Edvard Munch, Auguste Renoir, 
and Vincent van Gogh, among scores of others. Give yourself about two 
hours to browse through all the galleries.

Shopping in Cologne
The first Füssgänger (pedestrians-only) shopping zones in Germany origi-
nated in Cologne and present a seemingly endless and interconnected 
conglomeration of shops and shopping arcades.

 Chapter 19: Cologne and the Romance of the Rhine 379
Hohe Strasse, the main north–south street in Roman times, is now 
Cologne’s busiest commercial drag, jammed every day except Sunday 
with shoppers, musicians, organ grinders, snack shops, fruit sellers, and 
endless stores. On Hohe Strasse and its surrounding streets, you find all 
the major international designer-clothing boutiques; stores selling silver, 
fine jewelry, and perfumeries; and the big department stores (most of 
the stores remain open until 8 p.m., except on Sun, when most are 
closed). Schildergasse is where you find international men’s fashions, 
fine leather bags and purses, and designer shoes.
Discovering nightlife in Cologne
One of Germany’s major cultural centers, Cologne offers a variety of fine 
arts and nightlife options. To find out what’s going on in the city, pick up a 
copy of Monats Vorschau (1.50€/$2) at newsstands). You can purchase tick-
ets at a venue’s Kasse (box office), at the Tourist Information Office (see 
“Finding information,” earlier in this chapter), and at Köln MusikTicket,

range from 11€ to 100€ ($15–$135).
The Schauspielhaus, Offenbachplatz (% 0221/8400; U-Bahn: Neumarkt), is 
the site of three theaters, each with its own performances and schedules.
Cologne from Cologne: No. 4711
Any kind of toilet water is now called “eau de Cologne,” or simply “cologne,” but Echt 
Kölnisch Wasser (the original eau de Cologne) remains the official name for the distinc-
tive toilet waters created in the city of Cologne. 4711 Haus, Glockengasse 4711 
(% 0221/925-0450; U-Bahn: Neumarkt), sells the orange-and-lavender-scented water 
first developed in Cologne in 1709 by Italian chemist Giovanni Maria Farina. The Mühlens 
family, another early producer of Kölnisch Wasser, also lived and worked in this house 
at no. 4711. The street number eventually became the trademark name for their product. 
You can buy 4711 cologne in all sizes and shapes, as soap, and even as premoistened 
towelettes. The smallest bottle costs about 5€ ($6.75).

Cruises along the Rhine
Cologne is a major embarkation point for Rhine cruises. Even if you don’t have time for 
a long Rhine cruise, you can enjoy a trip on the river aboard one of the many local boats.
KD (Köln–Düsseldorfer Deutsche Rheinschiffahrt), Frankenwerft 15 (% 0221/208-8318; 
www.k-d.com), offers boat tours of the Rhine from Cologne. The KD ticket booth and 
boarding point is right on the river, a short walk south from the cathedral.
The one-hour Panorama Rundfahrt (round-trip) is a pleasant way to see the stretch of 
Rhine immediately around Cologne. The tour departs from late March through October 
daily at 10:30 a.m., noon, 2 p.m., and 6 p.m. The cost is 7.20€ ($9.70). From March through 
October, a daily Nachmittags (afternoon) cruise with Kaffee und Kuchen (coffee and 
cake) leaves at 3:30 p.m. and returns at 5:45 p.m.; the cost is 10€ ($14). Prerecorded 
commentary in English plays on both of these sightseeing cruises.
If you want to see the most scenic stretch of the Rhine, with the legendary Lorelei rock 
and many hilltop castles, take one of KD’s daylong cruises between Mainz and Koblenz, 
departing Mainz daily at 8:45 a.m. and 9:45 a.m. and returning at 7:20 p.m. and 8:20 p.m.

The Mosel Valley: Great Wines, 
Beautiful Scenery
The Mosel Valley, southwest of Cologne, is a scenic winegrowing region 
like the nearby Rheingau (see the “Sampling the wines of Rheingau” side-
bar in this chapter). Winding through the steep slopes of the Eifel and 
Hunsruck hills in the German state of Rheinland-Palatinate, the Mosel 
Valley follows the course of the Mosel River for more than 160km (100 
miles) between Trier and Koblenz, where the waters flow into the Rhine. 
(See “The Mosel Valley” map in this chapter.)
The valley encompasses thousands of acres of vineyards, a full 10 per-
cent of the national total. Its beautiful scenery, fine wine, Roman ruins, 
medieval castles, and riverside towns with cobbled streets and half-tim-
bered houses make the Mosel Valley a prime area for exploration.
Touring the valley by boat or car
If you’re headquartering in Cologne and want to enjoy a boat cruise 
down the Mosel River, the easiest way is to take a train to Koblenz. From 
there, a boat operated by KD (% 0221/20881; www.k-d.de) sails down 
the Mosel to Cochem, 51km (32 miles) southwest of Koblenz. From late 
April through late October, boats depart daily from Koblenz at 9:45 a.m. 
and arrive in Cochem at 3 p.m. A return boat departs at 3:40 p.m., arriv-
ing in Koblenz at 8 p.m. The round-trip fare is 28€ ($38).
The A49 Autobahn runs between Koblenz and Trier; the prettier A53 
runs alongside the Mosel between Zell and Schweich.

Stopping in Cochem
Cochem, about halfway down the Mosel River from Koblenz, is a medi-
eval riverside town surrounded by vineyards and a popular spot for 
wine tastings and festivals. The tourist information office, Endertplatz 1 
(% 0267/60040; www.cochem.de), is open November through April, 
Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m.; May through 
July, Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m. to 
3 p.m.; August through October, Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m., Sunday 10 a.m. to noon.
 
 
If you’re driving through the Mosel Valley, Cochem is your best choice 
for an overnight stopover between Koblenz and Trier. You can also 
reach Cochem by train from either of those cities.
 
 Mosel-Wein-Woche (Mosel Wine Week), celebrating the region’s wines 
with tasting booths and a street fair, begins the first week of June. The 
similar Weinfest takes place the last weekend of August. From late 
November through December 21, Cochem dresses itself up for the 
Weihnachtsfest (Christmas Festival) that features a daily Christmas 
market. For information, contact the Cochem tourist information office.
Cochem’s biggest attraction is Reichsburg Cochem (% 02671/255), a 
restored 11th-century castle at the top of the hill behind the town. The 
castle, the most famous and photographed sight along the Mosel River, is 
open daily mid-March to November 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission (including 
guided tour) is 4.50€ ($6.10) adults, 2.50€ ($3.40) children and students.
Sampling the wines of Rheingau
The Rhine Valley from Koblenz south to Alsace, with its almond, cherry, fig, and other 
fruit trees and its sunny slopes covered with vineyards, is like a northern extension of 
Italy. This part of the Rhineland not only turns out fine wines but has been fundamentally 
formed by the culture of wine, as reflected in its economy, traditions, and festivals.
The Rheingau wine district (see “The Rhineland” map, p. 367) follows a 45km (27-mile) 
stretch of the Rhine west of Wiesbaden to the attractive Rhine-side town of Bingen. 
Vineyards have produced wine here since Roman times. The wind-sheltered southern 
slopes of the Taunus range, on the river’s northern bank, get plenty of sunshine and 
comparatively little rain, conditions the Romans recognized as perfect for grape-grow-
ing. The Rheingau wine grapes produce a delicately fruity wine with a full aroma. Eighty 
percent of this wine comes from the Riesling grape, and wine fans consider Rheingau 
Rieslings to be among the best white wines made anywhere.
If you take a Rhine cruise between Koblenz and Mainz (see the “Cruises along the 
Rhine” sidebar in this chapter), you sail through this scenic winegrowing region. If 
you’re driving, the B42 highway runs beside the river between Boppard and Eltville, the 
Rheingau’s unofficial capital.

The Mosel Valley
Both a hotel and a wine restaurant, Alte Thorschenke, Brückenstrasse 3, 
56812 Cochem (% 02671/7059; fax: 02671/4202), is one of the oldest and 
best-known establishments along the Mosel. The half-timbered struc-
ture, originally built in 1332, added a modern wing and became a hotel 
in 1960. A creaking wooden staircase (you can also take the elevator) 
leads to most of the 35 rooms. A few of the rooms have four-poster 
beds; all contain tub-shower combinations. Rack rates range from 84€ 
to 105€ ($113–$142) for a double, buffet breakfast included. All major 
credit cards are accepted. For a fine meal, drive to Enterttal, 1.6km 
(1 mile) northwest of Cochem, and dine at Weissmühle im Enterttal, 
Endertstrasse 1 (% 02671/8955). Try the trademark dish of fresh trout 
stuffed with herbs, baked, and kept warm at your table with a hot 
stone. Main courses range from 15€ to 25€ ($20–$34). Diners Club, 
MasterCard, and Visa are accepted. The restaurant is open daily from 
noon to 2 p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m.

Frankfurt am Main: Apple 
Wine and Euros

▶ Getting around the city

▶ Strolling through the Altstadt
▶ Discovering Apfelwein, cabaret, and more
L
ocated on the River Main, and sometimes called “Mainhattan” 
because of its skyscraper-studded skyline, Frankfurt is Germany’s 
fifth-largest city. Because the Frankfurt airport serves as the country’s 
main international hub, many travelers get their first introduction to 
Germany in this city. (See the “Frankfurt am Main” map in this chapter.)
Frankfurt has been a major banking city since the Rothschilds opened 
their first bank here more than 200 years ago. Today, Frankfurt is the 
financial center not only of Germany but also of the entire European 
Union (EU), home of the Bundesbank, Germany’s central bank, and the 
Central Bank of the EU. More banks maintain headquarters here than in 
any other German city, a fact that helps account for all those designer 
skyscrapers (including the tallest building in Europe). The huge € (euro) 
symbol that stands on Willy-Brandt-Platz in front of the new opera house 
can be regarded as the city’s logo.
 
 Frankfurt definitely focuses on business. Millions of visitors descend on 
the city during its trade shows in spring and autumn. The best known is 
the International Book Fair, the most important meeting place in the world 
for the acquisition and sale of book rights and translations.
Leveled during Allied bombing raids in World War II, a small portion of 
Frankfurt’s Altstadt (Old City) was lovingly rebuilt. But Frankfurt is first 
and foremost a modern, cosmopolitan city. Besides being a much-visited 
business center, the city is a tourist destination with fine museums and 
art collections, a rich cultural life, great shopping, and a lively nightlife. 
A very strong American presence still exists in this city on the Main. 
Nearly 40,000 American soldiers were stationed in Frankfurt until 1990.

 Chapter 20: Frankfurt am Main: Apple Wine and Euros 385
Getting There
All roads, rail lines, and air corridors lead to Frankfurt. If you fly into 
Germany from outside of Europe, chances are, you’ll land at the city’s 
airport.
By plane
The city’s airport, Flughafen Frankfurt/Main (% 069/6901; www.
frankfurt-airport.de), lies 11km (7 miles) from the city center. 
Europe’s busiest airport and Germany’s major international gateway, 
this airport serves more than 110 countries worldwide, with direct 
flights from many U.S. and Canadian cities, including Atlanta, Boston, 
Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Miami, Montreal, Newark, New York, 
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Portland (Oregon), Toronto, and Washington, 
D.C. Terminal 1 handles most European flights; Terminal 2 handles inter-
national flights. A people-mover system (called Sky Line) links the two 
airport terminals. 
The airport has a full array of stores, restaurants, banks, and currency-
exchange windows, as well as a bus terminal, several car-rental offices, 
and two railway stations. The long-distance AIRail Terminal links the 
airport to cities throughout Germany and neighboring countries. 
Regional and local trains operate from the Regional Station directly 
below Terminal 1. You can fly into Frankfurt, hop on a train right at 
the airport, and be on your way to any destination in Germany or the 
rest of Europe.
Taking the train into the city
The simplest method for getting into the city from the airport is by 
train. S8 and S9 trains (direction Offenbach or Hanau) to Frankfurt’s city 
center depart about every ten minutes from the regional train station, 
Platform 1. These two S-Bahn lines take you to Frankfurt’s Hauptbahnhof 
(main railway station) in about ten minutes. A one-way ticket costs 4.50€ 
($6.10). Tickets are available from the RMV ticket machines (with 
English translations) at the regional station and at the Deutsche Bahn 
(DB) Travel Center, Terminal 1, Level 0 (% 069/691-844), open daily 
from 6 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. (RMV are the initials of the public transporta-
tion authority.) The RMV ticket machines have special fast-selection but-
tons for the S-Bahn journey to Frankfurt. They are marked einzelfahrt 
frankfurt (single ticket to Frankfurt) and tageskarte frankfurt inkl. 
flughafen (a reduced-price one-day transportation ticket within 
Frankfurt, including the trip from the airport).
Hopping a bus into the city
If you want to travel to the city center by bus, you have many options 
from which to choose. Buses into the city stop in front of Terminal 1 on 
the arrivals level and in front of Terminal 2 on Level 2. Some airlines 
offer special shuttle-bus services to Frankfurt from the airport; check 
when you purchase your ticket.

Catching a cab into the city
A taxi ride from the airport to the city center costs about 20€ ($27) and 
takes about 20 minutes. Taxis are available in front of the terminals.
By train
Frankfurt’s Hauptbahnhof is the busiest train station in Europe, 
with connections to all major German and European cities. Tourist 
Information Hauptbahnhof, opposite the main entrance (% 069/2123-
8800), is open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturday 
and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Currency-exchange windows and bank 
ATMs are located in the station. For travel information, including sched-
ules and fares, call Deutsche Bahn (% 11861; www.bahn.de).
By car
The A3 and A5 autobahns intersect near Frankfurt’s airport. The A3 
comes in from the Netherlands, Cologne, and Bonn and continues east 
and south to Würzburg, Nuremberg, and Munich. The A5 comes from 
the northeast (Hannover) and continues south to Heidelberg and Basel, 
Switzerland. From the west, the A60 connects with the A66, which leads 
to Frankfurt.
Finding Information after You Arrive
You find tourist information in two locations:
 
✓ Tourist Information Hauptbahnhof, opposite the main entrance of 
the train station (% 069/2123-8800; www.frankfurt-tourismus.
de), is open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturday 
and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. This office offers a hotel-booking 
service.
 
✓ Tourist Information Römer, Römerberg 27 (% 069/2123-8800), 
in the Altstadt, is open Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 
5:30 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Orienting Yourself in Frankfurt
The River Main divides Frankfurt. Most of the historic sights and several 
museums are in the Altstadt on the north bank. Concentrated in the city 
center around the Altstadt are hotels, restaurants, and nightlife. The 
Altstadt contains an even older section referred to as the Innenstadt 
(Inner City). The exclusive Westend district, west of the Altstadt, is a 
residential and embassy quarter. It was the only part of Frankfurt that 
was not destroyed during the World War II Allied bombing of the city. 
The huge, modern Frankfurt Messe (trade-fair convention center) is con-
sidered part of the Westend.

 Chapter 20: Frankfurt am Main: Apple Wine and Euros 389
The Hauptbahnhof is located at the western edge of the city center. As 
you walk out of the station, Baselerstrasse is on your right and heads 
south toward the River Main. You have a choice of streets heading east 
to the Altstadt: Münchner Strasse leads directly into Theaterplatz, with 
its opera house; Taunusstrasse goes to three of the major Altstadt 
squares in the southern part of the city — Goetheplatz, Rathenauplatz, 
and the Hauptwache.
Museumsufer, the embankment along the river’s south side, is the site of 
many prominent museums, some of them housed in former riverside villas. 
Sachsenhausen, a district on the south side of the river, is a popular enter-
tainment quarter filled with Frankfurt’s famous apple-wine taverns.
Getting Around Frankfurt
After you arrive in the Altstadt, you can easily get everywhere, including 
the Museumsufer on the opposite bank of the river, on foot. For longer 
distances, you can take the U-Bahn (subway), S-Bahn (tram), or a bus.
Using public transportation
A network of modern subways (U-Bahn), trams (S-Bahn), and buses, 
administered by the Rhein-Main Verkehrsverbund (RMV; % 069/19449; 
www.vgf-ffm.de), links Frankfurt. All forms of public transportation 
can be used interchangeably at a single price based on fare zones. 
Tickets are good for one hour on routes going in the same direction. 
Purchase your Fahrscheine (tickets) at ticket counters or from the coin-
operated machines found in U-Bahn stations and next to tram and bus 
stops. The ticket machines have user screens in English to guide you 
through the process. A one-way single ticket (Einzelfahrkarte) within the 
city center costs 2.20€ ($3) adults, 1.35€ ($1.80) children.
 
 Buy your ticket before you board the U-Bahn or a tram in Frankfurt (on a 
bus you can buy a ticket from the driver). If you’re caught traveling with-
out the proper ticket, you may be fined 40€ ($54) on the spot.
 
 Two special tickets help you save money on public transportation in 
Frankfurt:
 
✓ A 24-hour ticket (Tageskarte), good for unlimited travel inside 
Frankfurt’s central zone, costs 5.60€ ($7.55) for adults and 3.35€ 
($4.50) for children. You can buy this ticket from the ticket 
machines.
 
✓ The Frankfurt Card, available at the city’s tourist offices, allows 
unlimited travel anywhere within the greater Frankfurt area, trans-
port on the airport shuttle bus, a reduction on the tourist office’s 
sightseeing tour (see “Seeing Frankfurt by Guided Tour,” later in 
this chapter), and half-price admission to many of the city’s muse-
ums. The cost is 8.70€ ($12) for a one-day card and 13€ ($17) for a 
two-day card.

Taking a taxi
To call a taxi, dial % 069/230-001. You don’t have to pay a surcharge for 
calling a cab. You can also get a cab at one of the city’s clearly desig-
nated taxi stands, or by hailing one on the street (the car’s roof light will 
be illuminated if it’s available). Taxis charge by the trip and by the car-
load, without extra surcharges for luggage. The initial charge is 2.50€ 
($3.50); each kilometer costs 1.70€ ($2.25).
Staying in Style
During busy trade fairs, finding a room in Frankfurt can be difficult. I rec-
ommend that you book your hotel in advance. If you arrive without a 
room, the tourist office in the main train station can help find you a 
room for a small fee. You can book a room for free by calling % 069/
2123-0808 or by visiting the Web site www.frankfurt-tourismus.de.
 
 Frankfurt is one of two German cities (Munich is the other) with lots of 
air-hotel packages available from major airlines. You can save a bundle 
by booking one of these packages. See Chapter 6 for more information 
on packages to Germany.
Because Frankfurt is such a business-oriented city, hotels tend to be 
more expensive than elsewhere in Germany. Rates generally go up 
during the trade fairs. Many hotels offer lower weekend rates. Always 
check the hotel’s Web site for special promotional offers.
 An Der Messe
$$–$$$$ Westend
This quiet, 46-room charmer is a ten-minute walk from the train station, 
the banking district, and the fairgrounds. Rooms are comfortably large 
and stylishly furnished, each with a different theme or motif (Asian, Art 
Nouveau, French Provincial, and more). The large bathrooms have tub-
shower combos. Rooms in the back, some with balconies, look out onto 
leafy gardens. The hotel can arrange baby-sitting.
See map p. 386. Westendstrasse 104, 60325 Frankfurt am Main. % 800-221-6509 in 
the U.S. or 069/747-979. Fax: 069/748-349. www.hotel-an-der-messe.de. 
U-Bahn: Bockenheimer Warte (then a 5-minute walk south on Senckenberganlage 
and east on Westendstrasse). Rack rates: 130€–395€ ($175–$533) double. Rates 
include breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Art-Hotel Robert Mayer
$$–$$$$ Westend
This artfully decorated hotel is within walking distance of Frankfurt’s 
trade-fair complex. The building dates from 1905, but the rooms were 
completely redone in 1994, when 11 artists were hired to lend their indi-
vidual visions to each of the 11 bedrooms. One room design was inspired

the rooms are comfortable and stylish. Many restaurants are nearby.

 Hilton Frankfurt
$$$$ City Center
With a soaring 12-story atrium and vast expanses of glass, this is one of 
Frankfurt’s newer (it opened in 1998) hotels. It’s located next to the stock 
exchange and close to all the city’s attractions. A sense of hip, high-design 
theatricality prevails in the 342 bedrooms. Prices vary according to size, 
view, and degree of luxury. Rooms overlooking the hotel’s central atrium 
are the least expensive. The hotel has a health club and a pool, a bonus 
for most kids. The staff can also arrange baby-sitting.

or 069/1338-000. Fax: 069/1338-1338. www.hilton.com. U-Bahn: Eschenheimer 
Tor (then a 3-minute walk west on Hochstrasse). Rack rates: 230€–425€ ($310–$574) 
double. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel am Dom
$$–$$$ Altstadt
You couldn’t ask for a more central location: This small, appealing, family-
owned hotel sits directly beside the cathedral in the heart of the Altstadt. 
In terms of style, a simple, European minimalism prevails in the lobby and 
30 guest rooms. Bathrooms are nice but on the small side, with either a 
shower or a tub. Many opera singers stay here when they’re in town. 
Breakfast is the only meal served; museums are at the doorstep.

Fax: 069/28-32-37. www.hotelamdom.de. U-Bahn: Römer (then a 2-minute walk 
to the street behind the cathedral). Rack rates: 120€–199€ ($162–$269) double. Rates 
include breakfast. AE, MC, V.
 
 Hotelschiff Peter Schlott
$ Höchst
Permanently moored in the Frankfurt suburb of Höchst, this 1950s river-
boat has 19 small but evocative rooms. All of them have wash basins, ten 
have tiny showers, but none has a private toilet. Everything is cabin-size 
and basic (some rooms are just a cut above a hostel), but if you love boats 
you’ll enjoy hearing the waters of the Main lapping beneath your window. 
The ship’s narrow and steep staircases are not easy to navigate if you 
have lots of luggage or difficulty walking. A nice cafe and restaurant is 
onboard.

double without shower; 91€ ($123) double with shower. Rates include breakfast. AE, 
DC, MC, V.
 Mozart
$$–$$$$ Westend
Many people consider this to be the most congenial small hotel in 
Frankfurt. The location is a few blocks east of the Palmengarten and south 
of the university, right off the busy Fürstenbergerstrasse. The 35 rooms, 
each with a shower-only bathroom, are small but comfortable. The break-
fast room, with its crystal chandeliers and Louis XV–style chairs, looks 
like an 18th-century salon. Baby cribs and kids’ beds are free for children 
10 and under.

069/156-8061. www.mozart-frankfurt.de. U-Bahn: Holzhausenstrasse (then 
a 10-minute walk south on Landstrasse and west on Fürstenbergerstrasse to 
Parkstrasse). Rack rates: 115€–185€ ($155–$250) double. AE, DC, MC, V. 
 Steigenberger Frankfurter Hof
$$$–$$$$ City Center
The most prestigious hotel in Frankfurt, the Steigenberger Frankfurter Hof 
boasts excellent service and a historic setting that’s central to everything 
in town. The five-story, 332-room flagship of Germany’s elegant 
Steigenberger hotel chain was established in 1872. Public areas are plushly 
elegant. In the older part of the hotel, light floods the large, high-ceilinged 
bedrooms, all gracefully furnished. Rooms in the newer wing have a 
blander look. Bathrooms are large, luxurious, and completely up-to-date, 
with tub-shower combinations. Amenities include an on-site business 
center and a health club with sauna. The staff can arrange baby-sitting. 
The lavish breakfast buffet costs an additional 26€ ($32). Rates are lowest 
on weekends.

steigenberger.de. U-Bahn: Willy-Brandt-Platz (take Willy-Brandt-Platz exit; 
the hotel is a 1-minute walk north on Friedenstrasse). Rack rates: 180€–399€ ($243–
$471) double. AE, DC, MC, V.
The Pure
$$–$$$$ City Center
If you’re looking for the hippest in hotel concept and design, this new city-
center hotel is where you’ll want to stay. The Pure is stripped of all frills 
and froufrou and conveys a sense of minimalist, Zen-like style (or flow). 
All the materials are white or light-colored and illuminated by 

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
394
mood-enhancing lighting. The 50 rooms are equally minimalist, with oak 
floors and lots of white. The bathrooms are predictably modern. In the 
end, no matter how trendy it is, a good hotel must provide efficient service 
and a good bed, and The Pure is a winner there as well.
See map p. 386. Niddastrasse 86, 60329 Frankfurt am Main. % 069/710-4570. Fax: 
069/7104-57177. www.the-pure.de. U-Bahn: Hauptbahnhof (then a 5-minute walk 
northwest on Ludwigstrasse to Niddastrasse). Rack rates: 140€–200€ ($189–$270) 
double. Rates include continential breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V. 
Dining Out
In recent years, Frankfurt has become, along with Berlin and Munich, one 
of Germany’s great dining capitals, with restaurants that offer an array of 
richly varied cuisines. The Apfelwein (ep-ful-vine; apple wine) taverns in 
Sachsenhausen (see the “Sachsenhausen and the apple-wine taverns” 
sidebar later in this chapter), on the south bank of the Main, tend to serve 
traditional Hessian dishes such as Rippchen mit Kraut (pickled pork chops 
with sauerkraut), Haspel (pigs’ knuckles), and Handkäs mit Musik (strong, 
smelly cheese with vinegar, oil, and chopped onions; not for the faint of 
heart or recommended for honeymooners). One dish unique to Frankfurt 
is grüne Sosse, a green sauce made from seven herbs and other season-
ings, chopped hard-boiled eggs, and sour cream, usually served with 
boiled eggs, Tafelspitz (boiled beef), or poached fish.
Exedra
$–$$ City Center GREEK/MACEDONIAN
Behind an ornate 19th-century facade is one of the best Greek restaurants 
in Frankfurt. This large and fairly plain taverna, with big windows over-
looking the street, serves as a cafe-bar in the early mornings. All the menu 
offerings are reliably good. The grilled lamb with feta-cheese sauce and 
grilled sweet peppers, and the pan-fried veal with white-wine and lemon 
sauce are both excellent.
See map p. 386. Heiligkreuzgasse 29. % 069/287-397. U-Bahn: Konstablerwache 
(then a 5-minute walk east on Zeil and north on Kapperfeldstrasse to 
Heiligkreuzegass). Reservations recommended. Main courses: 10€–20€ ($14–$27). 
AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m. to midnight, Sat–Sun 4 p.m. to midnight.
Frankfurter versus hot dog
In Sachsenhausen and taverns around the city, you find real Frankfurters, smoked sau-
sages made from pork and spices. The oldest-known recipe dates from 1487. The local 
product has been labeled “genuine Frankfurt sausage” since about 1900 to distinguish it 
from the American hot dog. (Hot dogs are for sale in Frankfurt, too, but always under the 
name “hot dog.”) Unlike the hot dog, Frankfurters are long, skinny, and always served in 
pairs; like all German sausages, they contain no fillers.

 Chapter 20: Frankfurt am Main: Apple Wine and Euros 395
Haus Wertheym
$–$$ Altstadt GERMAN/HESSIAN
Wertheym operates three old-fashioned, atmospheric restaurants: 
Restaurant Haus Wertheym, a half-timbered house on a cobblestone 
street just west of the Römer; Historix (Saalgasse 19; % 069/29-44-00), an 
apple-wine tavern right across from it; and Römer-Bembel, a larger tavern 
with outdoor tables right on Römer Square (% 069/28-83-83). Wood pan-
eling and antique accessories decorate the interiors of all three, and the 
waiters can be brusque when the places are busy. The menus favor tradi-
tional dishes such as Frankfurter sausages, pork Schnitzels (breaded cut-
lets), Frankfurter Hacksteak (chopped steak), and a good Tafelspitz (boiled 
beef) that comes with the restaurant’s trademark green sauce.
See map p. 386. Fahrtor 1. % 069/28-14-32. U-Bahn: Römer (then a 3-minute walk 
west to Fahrtor). Main courses: 8€–24€ ($11–$32). MC, V. Open: Daily 11 a.m.–11 p.m.
Main Tower Restaurant & Bar
$$$$ City Center INTERNATIONAL
The 53rd floor of one of Frankfurt’s tallest skyscrapers is the setting for 
this classy restaurant with great food and views that extend for miles. The 
cuisine is fresh and reliable, with menus divided into traditional and “new” 
dishes. Main courses may include dishes such as filet of veal with mush-
rooms and leeks, or saddle of lamb. Fish dishes may include halibut with 
melted foie gras or pikeperch ravioli with cooked eel and celery cream. 
Vegetarian dishes are also available.
See map p. 386. Neue Mainzer Strasse 52–58. % 069/3650-4777. U-Bahn: Willy-Brandt-
Platz (then a 5-minute walk north on Neue Mainzer Strasse). Reservations recom-
mended. Main courses: 20€–28€ ($27–$38); fixed-price menu 64€–98€ ($86–$132). AE, 
DC, MC, V. Open: Sun and Tues–Thurs 5:30 p.m.–1 a.m., Fri–Sat 5:30 p.m.–2 a.m.
Restaurant Français
$$$$ City Center FRENCH
For the best in French cuisine, come to this dressy (jackets and ties for 
men), Michelin-starred restaurant in the Steigenberger Frankfurter Hof. 
The contemporary French dishes are beautifully prepared and presented. 
Appetizers may include a gooseliver terrine with an orange compote, beet-
root tart, or quail consommé with truffle-stuffed tortellini. For the main 
course, you may find seasonal specialties such as saltwater crayfish 
served with a vegetable couscous or suckling pig served with stuffed veg-
etables, caramelized garlic, and purple mustard sauce.
See map p. 386. In the Steigenberger Frankfurter Hof, Am Kaiserplatz. % 069/215-
118. U-Bahn: Willy-Brandt-Platz (take the Willy-Brandt-Platz exit; the hotel is a 
1-minute walk north on Friedenstrasse). Reservations required. Main courses: 28€–
40€ ($38–$54); fixed-price menu 118€ ($159). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon to 
1:30 p.m. and 6:30–9:30 p.m.

Part IV: Southern and Western Germany 
396
Tiger Restaurant, Palastbar, and Tiger-Bistrot
$$$$ City Center MEDITERRANEAN/INTERNATIONAL
Come to these three places if you want to check out “the scene” (and be 
seen). The gourmet Tiger Restaurant, in a basement-level dining room 
adjacent to the Tigerpalast, a famous cabaret theater, earned a Michelin 
star. High-powered politicians and celebrities come to dine on seasonal 
Mediterranean cuisine. Expect to find dishes such as sea bass with a 
pepper crust and chanterelles, beef carpaccio with arugula polenta, 
poached beef with potato risotto and fried artichokes, and paella in saf-
fron sauce. Meals in the Palastbar and the Tiger-Bistrot are less elaborate 
and cheaper.
See map p. 386. Heiligkreuzegasse 16–20. % 069/9200-2250. U-Bahn: Konstab-
lerwache (then a 5-minute walk east on Zeil and north on Kapperfeldstrasse to 
Heiligkreuzegasse). Reservations required. Main courses: Tiger Restaurant 25€ –48€ 
($34–$65); Palastbar and Tiger-Bistrot 25€–35€ ($34–$47); Tiger Restaurant fixed-
price menu 49€–100€ ($66–$135). AE, MC, V. Open: Tiger Restaurant Tues–Sat 6 p.m. 
to midnight; Palastbar Tues–Sun 5 p.m.–1 a.m.; Tiger-Bistrot Tues–Sat 5 p.m.–1 a.m.
Weinhaus Brückenkeller
$$$$ Altstadt GERMAN/INTERNATIONAL
Located in the heart of the Altstadt, this leading restaurant harks back to 
the 19th century, both in food and tavernlike décor. A typical meal may 
begin with cream of sorrel soup or gooseliver with green beans, followed 
by a tender saddle of venison or lamb. The Tafelspitz (boiled beef) is the 
best in town. For dessert, try the soufflé of strawberries with vanilla sauce. 
You can choose from an excellent assortment of German wines.
See map p. 386. Schützenstrasse 6. % 069/298-0070. U-Bahn: Römer (then a 
10-minute walk east on Mainkai and Schöne Aussicht and north on Schützenstrasse). 
Reservations required. Main courses: 28€–40€ ($38–$54). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mon–
Sat 6 p.m. to midnight. Closed Dec 20–Jan 8.
Sightseeing in Frankfurt
You can explore Frankfurt’s compact Altstadt and Innenstadt on foot. 
Nearly all the main sights lie within the boundaries of the old town walls 
(which today form a stretch of narrow parkland around the Altstadt) or 
are just across the river along the Museumsufer (Museum 
Embankment).
Allow about a half-day to explore the attractions of the Altstadt, specifi-
cally the Römerberg, the historic core of the Old City; the Kaiserdom; 
and the Goethe House, birthplace of Germany’s greatest writer. At the 
northern edge of the Altstadt is the city’s most important square, called 
An der Hauptwache, named for the old Hauptwache (guardhouse) that 
stands upon it. Give yourself another half- or full-day to visit the muse-
ums on the south bank of the river. The Städelsches Kunstinstitut 

 Chapter 20: Frankfurt am Main: Apple Wine and Euros 397
gallery (called “the Städel” for short) is the most important of the seven 
museums on the Museumsufer.
Walking through the city
Many visitors to Frankfurt are in the city for only one day before heading 
off to other German destinations. If you want to see the city on foot, take 
advantage of the vast network of Fussgängerzonen (pedestrian streets) 
for sightseeing and shopping. For a general walking tour, start at the 
Alte Oper (U-Bahn: Alte Oper), stroll east along Grosse Bockenheimer 
Strasse (better known as Fressgass’s, or Gluttony Lane, because food 
stores and restaurants line the street), and continue to An der Haupt-
wache, Frankfurt’s Times Square. Northwest of the Hauptwache is the 
Börse, Frankfurt’s stock exchange. A block to the north of Hauptwache, 
at the end of Grosse Eschenheimer Strasse, stands the Eschenheimer 
Turm, a restored medieval tower, and the Eschenheimer Tor, a medi-
eval gateway. Running east from An der Hauptwache is the broad Zeil, 
the busiest shopping street in Germany. South of An der Hauptwache, 
via Liebfrauenstrasse and Neue Kräme, the Römerberg and the Kaiser-
dom form the heart of the Altstadt. From there, Limpurgergasse leads to 
the river and the iron footbridge called the Eisener Steg, which crosses 
to the Museumsufer along the south bank of the Main. From the foot-
bridge and the south bank, you have the best views of Frankfurt. Farther 
south, beyond Gartenstrasse, lies the picturesque district of 
Sachsenhausen, famed for its apple-wine taverns.
Discovering the top attractions from A to Z
Deutsches Architektur Museum (German Architecture Museum)
Museumsufer
This museum is for those with an interest in architecture or urban plan-
ning. On display is a collection of 19th- and 20th-century architectural 
plans and models, examples of international modern architecture, and a 
series of exhibits showing how human dwellings have evolved over time 
in different parts of the world. A pair of 19th-century villas house the 
museum, designed by Oswald Matthias Ungers. The museum has a nice 
gift shop.

Goethe-Haus (Goethe House)
City Center
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832), Germany’s greatest writer, was 
born in this spacious, light-filled house and lived here until 1765, when he 
moved to Weimar (see Chapter 14). Reconstructed after wartime damage, 
the ocher-colored house still manages to convey the feeling of a prosper-
ous, tranquil home life in bygone days. The interior decoration reflects the 
baroque, rococo, and neoclassical styles of the 18th century. Paintings of 
friends and family adorn the walls. The room where Goethe wrote is on 
the second floor; the room next door displays one of his most cherished 
childhood possessions, a puppet theater. Annexed to the house is the 
modern, glass-fronted Goethe-Museum. Of interest to Goethe specialists, 
the museum contains a library of books, manuscripts, graphic artworks, 
and paintings associated with Goethe and his works. To see the house and 
museum, give yourself about half an hour.

dents, 1.50€ ($2) children. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
Historisches Museum (Historical Museum)
Altstadt
The exhibits in this large, drab-looking museum at the south end of the 
Römerberg showcase the history and culture of Frankfurt from its earliest 
settlement to the present day. Collections include examples of gold and 
silver plateware and jewelry; pottery and porcelain; and paintings, litho-
graphs, and photographs. On the first floor, have a look at the models of 
the Altstadt at various periods of its development (Middle Ages, end of 
World War II, present day). As you can see from the models, when Allied 
bombs fell on Frankfurt in 1944, one of Europe’s largest medieval 
cityscapes was completely wiped out. You can browse through in half an 
hour if you’re only mildly interested; if history is your thing, expect to 
spend more time.

Kaiserdom (Cathedral)
Altstadt
The famous dome-topped West tower of the Kaiserdom (also known as 
Bartholomäus-Dom/Cathedral of St. Bartholomew) dominates the 
Altstadt. The highly ornamented tower dates from the 15th century and is 
built of red sandstone. Construction on the cathedral began in the 13th 
century and went on to the 15th, but the structure wasn’t entirely com-
pleted until 1877. The church gained cathedral status in the 14th century 
when it became the site of the election of the Kaisers (emperors) of the 
Holy Roman Empire. Later, between 1562 and 1792, the Kaisers also were 
crowned here, so the church became known as the Kaiserdom. Previous 
coronations had taken place in Aachen Cathedral.
Destroyed by Allied bombs in 1944, the cathedral was rebuilt in 1953. The 
layout is a fairly simple Gothic hall-church with three naves and a tran-
sept. The Dom Museum (% 069/1337-6186), in the church’s 19th-century 
cloister, exhibits coronation robes of the imperial electors. The oldest 
vestments date from the 1400s. You can see everything in and around the 
cathedral and museum in about a half-hour.

Liebieghaus (Liebieg Sculpture Museum)
Museumsufer
Housed in a late 19th-century villa, this sculpture museum includes note-
worthy pieces from ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, and from medieval 
and Renaissance Europe. In the medieval section, look for the 11th-cen-
tury carving of the Virgin and Child created in Trier, Tilman Riemen-
schneider’s expressive Madonna, Andrea della Robbia’s altarpiece of the 
Assumption, and the 16th-century Black Venus with Mirror. Give yourself 
about an hour to see the major works.
Stopping for coffee and pastry
For a quick and inexpensive cup of coffee and an excellent piece of pastry, duck into 
Konditorei Hollhorst, Fahntor 1 (% 069/282-769; U-Bahn: Römer), a small bakery directly 
across from the Historisches Museum. A coffee and a delicious Apfelhörnchen (a 
pastry with apple filling) costs about 4€ ($5.40). The Konditorei is open Tuesday through 
Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 6 p.m.

Museumsufer
Two buildings — one an early 19th-century villa, the other a 1985 struc-
ture designed by architect Richard Meier — house this enormous collec-
tion of European, Asian, and Islamic objects. The museum has outstanding 
collections of glassware (including 15th-century Venetian pieces), German 
rococo furnishings, and porcelain. An overview takes about an hour.

Hans Hollein. The massive triangular structure has projecting and reced-
ing window openings. Exhibitions include major artists since the 1950s, 
such as Americans Roy Liechtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and 
George Segal, all from the New York School. Works by modern German 
artists also are on view. You can see the works in about an hour. A cafe-
restaurant is on the premises.

 Chapter 20: Frankfurt am Main: Apple Wine and Euros 401
Römer and Römerberg
Altstadt
The Altstadt centers around three Gothic buildings with stepped gables, 
known collectively as the Römer. These houses, just west of the cathe-
dral, originally were built between 1288 and 1305 and then bought by the 
city a century later for use as the Rathaus (City Hall). After his coronation 
in the Kaiserdom, a new emperor and his entourage paraded westward to 
the Römer for a banquet. In the Kaisersaal (Imperial Hall; % 069/2123-
4814), on the second floor of the center house, you can see romanticized 
images of 52 emperors sculpted in the 19th century to celebrate the thou-
sand-year history of the Holy Roman Empire. The hall is open daily 10 a.m. 
to 1 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m. Admission is 2€ ($2.70).
Medieval city officials and their families watched plays and tournaments 
from a specially built gallery on the Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas Church), 
the small chapel in front of the city hall. The chapel has a 35-bell carillon 
that plays at 9:05 a.m., 12:05 p.m., and 5:05 p.m. Römerplatz, the square 
in front of the Römer, is one of Frankfurt’s most popular spots, with a 
series of rebuilt half-timbered buildings housing cafes and restaurants. In 
December, it becomes the site of Frankfurt’s giant Christmas Market.
The elaborate facade of the Römer, with its ornate balcony and statues of 
emperors, overlooks the Römerberg (Roman Hill). As early as the Stone 
Age, people occupied this high ground that was later settled by the 
Romans. After Germanic tribes conquered the Romans, the settlement fell 
into ruins and was forgotten until construction workers in the 20th cen-
tury stumbled across its remains.

 Städelsches Kunstinstitut/Städische Galerie 
(Städel Art Institute/Städel Gallery)
Museumsufer
Frankfurt’s most important art gallery contains a fine collection of 
European paintings. The first floor features French Impressionists such as 
Renoir and Monet, along with German painters of the 19th and 20th cen-
turies, including Tischbein’s famous Portrait of Goethe in the Campagna in 
Italy. If you’re short on time, the second floor displays an outstanding col-
lection of Flemish primitives, 17th-century Dutch artists, and 16th-century 
German masters, such as Dürer, Grünewald, and Memling. One of the most 
impressive paintings is Jan van Eyck’s Madonna (1433). A large altarpiece 
and an impish nude Venus represent the work of Lucas Cranach. In the 
Department of Modern Art hang works by Francis Bacon, Dubuffet, Tapies, 
and Yves Klein. To get a good sense of what’s on display, you need at least 
two hours.

Seeing Frankfurt by Guided Tour
A very good way to see Frankfurt, especially when your time is limited, 
is by the daily guided tour offered by the city’s tourist offices. The 21⁄2-
hour bus tour, in English, picks up passengers at 2 p.m. from Touristinfo 
Römer (Römerberg 27, in the Altstadt; % 069/2123-8800) and at 2:15 p.m. 
from Touristinfo Hauptbahnhof (opposite the main entrance of the train 
station; % 069/2123-8800). From April through October, an additional 
tour leaves from the Römer at 10 a.m. and from the train station at 
10:15 a.m. The tour covers the entire city and includes a trip to the Goethe 
House and, in the summer, the top of the Main Tower, Frankfurt’s tallest 
skyscraper. The cost is 26€ ($35) adults, 21€ ($28) students, 10€ ($14) 
children ages 6 to 10. You can buy tickets at the tourist offices.
Shopping for Local Treasures
Frankfurt has several shopping areas. The Zeil, a pedestrian zone 
between the Hauptwache and Konstablerwache, is loaded with depart-
ment stores, clothing shops, shoe stores, record stores — in short, just 
about everything. Shoppers generally pack the Zeil, reputedly the busi-
est shopping street in Germany. The Hauptwache, in the center of 
Frankfurt, has two shopping areas, one above and one below ground. 
Schillerstrasse, another pedestrian zone, lies between Hauptwache 
and Eschenheimer Turm, near the stock exchange. Walking from 
Schillerstrasse northeast toward Eschenheimer Tor, you pass many 
Struwwelpeter (Shockheaded Peter)
He’s a memory now, but up until World War II, the image of Struwwelpeter, with his 
enormous shock of hair and Edward Scissorhands–length fingernails, was ingrained in 
the nightmares of every German child and many children throughout the world. 
Published in 1844, Struwwelpeter was the creation of Heinrich Hoffman (1809–1894), a 
Frankfurt physician who wrote gruesomely moralistic children’s stories. Struwwelpeter’s 
grotesque hair and fingernails were the result of his bad-boy behavior. The illustrated 
story became one of the most popular “children’s books” in Germany and was trans-
lated into 14 languages (in England, Struwwelpeter became “Shockheaded Peter”).
The entertaining Struwwelpeter-Museum, Schirn, Römerberg, Bendergass 1 (% 069/
281-333), displays original sketches and illustrations with copies of the book (and its 
classic image of Struwwelpeter) from many different countries. Admission is free; the 
museum, located alongside the Schirn Gallery, is open Tuesday through Sunday 11 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. Struwwelpeter fans also can visit the Heinrich-Hoffman-Museum, 
Schubertstrasse 20 (% 069/747-969; U-Bahn: Westend), the home of Struwwelpeter’s 
creator.

 Chapter 20: Frankfurt am Main: Apple Wine and Euros 403
elegant boutiques and specialty shops. Southwest of the Hauptwache is 
Goethestrasse, with exclusive stores evocative of Paris or Milan.
Shops are generally open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. 
and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. (until 4 or 6 p.m. first Sat of month).
Sachsenhausen and the 
apple-wine taverns
Sachsenhausen, the district south of the River Main, has long been known for its tav-
erns where Apfelwein (pronounced ebb-el-vye, in the local dialect; apple wine), not 
beer, is the special drink. At an apple-wine tavern, everyone sits together at long 
wooden tables and, sooner or later, the singing starts.
Apfelwein is a dry, alcoholic, 12-proof apple cider. The wine always is poured from a 
blue-and-gray stoneware jug into glasses embossed with a diamond-shaped pattern. 
The first sip may pucker your whole body and convince you that you’re drinking vinegar. 
If drinking straight Apfelwein is too much for you, try a Sauergespritzt (sour spritzer), a 
mixture of Apfelwein and plain mineral water, or a Süssgespritzt (sweet spritzer), 
Apfelwein mixed with lemonade-flavored mineral water.
Although available year-round, Apfelwein also comes in seasonal versions. Süsser 
(sweet), sold in the autumn, is the dark, cloudy product of the first pressing of the apple 
harvest. When the wine starts to ferment it’s called Rauscher, which means it’s darker 
and more acidic. You’re supposed to drink Süsser and Rauscher straight, not mixed.
The Apfelwein taverns in Sachsenhausen display a pine wreath outside when a new 
barrel has arrived. The taverns usually serve traditional meals, and hard rolls, salted 
breadsticks, and pretzels for nibbling are on the tables, too. What you eat, including the 
snacks, goes on your tab. The following is a list of a few traditional Apfelwein taverns 
in Sachsenhausen; all of them are Gartenlokale, meaning they move their tables outside 
in good weather:
 ✓ Zum Eichkatzerl, Greieichstrasse 29 (% 069/617-480), open Thursday through 
Tuesday from 3 p.m. to midnight.
 ✓ Fichtekränzi, Wallstrasse 5 (% 069/612-778), open Monday through Saturday from 
5 p.m. to midnight.
 ✓ Zum Gemalten Haus, Schweizer Strasse 67 (% 069/614-559), open Wednesday 
through Sunday from 10 a.m. to midnight. Closed mid-June to the end of July.
On Saturdays, Sundays, and holiday afternoons throughout the year, you can hop on the 
Ebbelwei-Express (% 069/2132-2425), an old, colorfully painted trolley, and ride all 
through Frankfurt and over to the apple-wine taverns in Sachsenhausen. The entire 
route takes about an hour and costs 6€ ($8.10) adults, 3€ ($4.05) children 13 and under. 
The fare includes a glass of apple wine (or apple juice). You can buy tickets from the 
conductor. Catch the trolley at Römer, Konstablerwache, or the main train station; 
service starts about 1:30 p.m. and ends about 5 p.m.

Department stores
Hertie, Zeil 90 (% 069/929-050; U-Bahn: Hauptwache), a Frankfurt shop-
ping tradition, carries clothes and shoes for every budget, has a toy 
department, and operates a food hall in the basement. Kaufhof, Zeil 116–
123 (% 069/21910; U-Bahn: Hauptwache), Hertie’s main competitor, 
stocks just about everything on its seven floors: porcelain, clothes, jew-
elry, glassware, gifts, and gadgets. The top-floor restaurant has pan-
oramic views of Frankfurt.
Porcelain
 
 Höchster Porzellan Manufaktur, Am Kornmarkt/Berliner Strasse 60 
(% 069/295-299; U-Bahn: Römer), contains one of Germany’s largest 
inventories of Höchst porcelain, called “white gold” and manufactured 
for the past 250 years. You can buy a beautiful white porcelain vase for 
as little as 25€ ($34).
Discovering Nightlife in Frankfurt
For details about what’s happening in Frankfurt, pick up Journal 
Frankfurt at newsstands throughout the city. Fritz and Strandgut, both 
free and available at the tourist office, also have listings.
To purchase tickets for major cultural events, go to the venue Kasse 
(box office) or to the Touristinfo office at the main train station or in the 
Römer.
 
 One of the best ways to spend an evening in Frankfurt is at one of the 
apple-wine taverns in Sachsenhausen (see the “Sachsenhausen and 
the apple-wine taverns” sidebar in this chapter).
Raising the curtain on the performing arts
When the Alte Oper (Old Opera House), Opernplatz (% 069/134-0400; 
www.alteoper.de; U-Bahn: Alte Oper), opened in 1880, critics hailed 
the building as one of the most beautiful theaters in Europe. Destroyed 
in World War II, the Alte Oper didn’t reopen until 1981. Today the the-
ater, with its golden-red mahogany interior and superb acoustics, is the 
site of frequent symphonic and choral concerts, but opera is not per-
formed here.
English Theater, Kaiserstrasse 52 (% 069/2423-1620; www.english-
theatre.org; U-Bahn: Hauptbahnhof), presents English-language musi-
cals, comedies, dramas, and thrillers from September through July. 
Tickets range from 20€ to 40€ ($27–$54).
Oper Frankfurt/Ballet Frankfurt, Willy-Brandt-Platz (% 069/134-0400; 
www.oper-frankfurt.de; U-Bahn: Willy-Brandt-Platz), is Frankfurt’s 
premier showcase for world-class opera and ballet. Ticket prices range 
from 10€ to 110€ ($14–$148).

Theater der Stadt Frankfurt, Untermainanlage 11 (% 069/2123-7999; 
U-Bahn: Willy-Brandt-Platz), has three stages. One belongs to the Frank-
furt Municipal Opera, the other two present dramas. A variety theater, 
Kunstlerhaus Mouson Turm, Waldschmidtstrasse 4 (% 069/4058-9520; 
kuenstlerhaus-mousonturm.de; U-/S-Bahn: Merianplatz), hosts 
plays, classical music concerts, and dance programs almost every night 
of the week. Tickets run 10€ to 30€ ($14–$40).
Having fun at a cabaret
 
 Tigerpalast, Heiligkreuzgasse 16–20 (% 069/289-691; www.tiger
palast.de; U-Bahn: Konstablerwache), is the most famous cabaret in 
Frankfurt. Shows take place in a small theater, where guests sit at tiny 
tables to see about eight different acts per show. Each show lasts two 
hours with breaks for drinks (10€/$14) and snacks. You don’t need to 
know German to enjoy the show, which is excellent family-style enter-
tainment. (The cabaret acts are not raunchy or suggestive, but more like 
circus entertainment.) Tickets are 45€ to 55€ ($61–$74), half-price for 
children 11 and under. Three recommended restaurants are part of this 
cabaret (see the Tiger Restaurant, Palastbar, and Tiger-Bistrot listing in 
the “Dining Out” section, earlier in this chapter).
Checking out bars and clubs
 
 If you’re going to paint the town red, be aware that porno movies, sex 
shows, sex shops, and discos teeming with prostitutes line several 
blocks in front of the main train station. This area can be dangerous at 
night, so don’t go there alone. If you’re looking for a night out, plenty of 
clubs, discos, bars, and cafes are across the River Main in the 
Sachsenhausen district. Most gay bars and clubs are located in a small 
area between Bleichstrasse and Zeil.
Bars and cafes

German Hotels
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering Germany’s finest hotels
▶ Finding extraspecial comfort and personal service
▶ Combining atmospheric ambience with delectable dining
E
very hotel that I recommend in this guidebook is a good one, and 
you can stay at any one of them in comfort. However, if you want to 
stay at Germany’s finest hotels, this chapter is for you. (In some of the 
descriptions, I also mention some equally worthy sister hotels.) Each 
one of these places offers something extra in terms of service, comfort, 
and aesthetics. At these hotels you find the highest standards of German 
hotel-keeping — and those standards are very high indeed. All the listed 
hotels are kid-friendly; they can arrange baby-sitting and provide cribs 
or beds for children.
Please take note: Most of these hotels are in the 5-star luxury category, 
but they offer special rates and promotions that can make them surpris-
ingly affordable. Always check the hotel Web site (and other hotel 
search engines) to see what special deals are available.
Der Europäische Hof-Hotel Europa, Heidelberg
The impeccable, family-run Der Europäische Hof-Hotel Europa, Friedrich-
Ebert-Anlage 1, 69117 Heidelberg ($$$$; % 800-223-4541 in the U.S. and 
Canada, or 06221/5150; www.europaeischerhof.com), is the best 
hotel in Heidelberg and the only 5-star hotel in the Rhine-Neckar region. 
Built in 1865 and carefully expanded over the decades, the property has 
a kind of glamorous elegance that few hotels can match. Built around a 
central Hof (garden courtyard), it feels more like a palatial resort than a 
hotel that’s only a couple of minutes’ walk from Heidelberg’s famed 
Altstadt (Old City). The large, traditionally furnished rooms have luxuri-
ously appointed bathrooms. The rooftop pool and sauna area is beauti-
fully designed. The hotel’s restaurant, Die Kurfürstenstube, is the top

gourmet restaurant in Heidelberg. Those in charge have thoughtfully 
taken care of every detail in this service-oriented hotel. See the 
“Heidelberg” map on p. 339 for the hotel’s location.
Der Kleine Prinz, Baden-Baden
In 2002, the readers of Condé Nast Traveler voted the family-owned and 
-operated Der Kleine Prinz, Lichtentaler Strasse 36, 76530 Baden-Baden 
($$$–$$$$; % 07221/346-600; www.derkleineprinz.de), the best 
hotel in Germany. Named for the children’s book character created by 
Antoine de Saint-Exupery, Der Kleine Prinz (The Little Prince) occupies 
two turn-of-the-century mansions. Each of the large, high-ceilinged 
rooms is furnished differently, with hand-chosen furniture and accesso-
ries. Personalized service is the hotel’s strong point. The rates include a 
superlative breakfast buffet and afternoon high tea. Free Internet use is 
another amenity. In the restaurant, you can dine on superbly prepared 
French, regional, and seasonal cuisine. The same impeccably high stan-
dards prevail in the small, sumptuous Hotel Belle Epoque ($$$–$$$$; 
% 07221/300-660; www.hotel-belle-epoque.de), the family’s sister 
hotel located just a block away and created from a villa built in 1870. See 
the “Baden-Baden” map on p. 324 for each hotel’s location.
Excelsior Hotel Ernst, Cologne
Walk out of the train station in Cologne and you stare up, mesmerized, 
at the enormous cathedral, one of the architectural wonders of Europe. 
You can see the cathedral from some of the rooms in the grand Excelsior 
Hotel Ernst, Trankgasse 1–5, 50667 Cologne ($$$–$$$$; % 0221/2701; 
www.excelsiorhotelernst.de), founded in 1863. The exterior looks 
a bit unassuming (it’s a protected building, so the facade can’t be 
altered), but walk inside and you’ll be bowled over by the refined ele-
gance of the place. The lobby and public areas are gleaming and elegant 
with marble floors and beautiful finishes. Guest rooms are spacious and 
beautifully appointed, especially those in the newly refurbished 
Hanseflügel wing. Bathrooms throughout are large and luxurious, but 
the bathrooms in the Hanseflügel wing are truly astounding, with big 
marble-clad tubs and huge rain showers. The hotel’s small fitness center 
has a whirlpool and steam room, and guests have free access to a busi-
ness center with computers and high-speed Internet service. The Hanse 
Stube restaurant is one of Cologne’s top gourmet restaurants, Taku is 
one of the city’s best Asian restaurants, and the breakfast buffet (this is 
one of the few luxury hotels that includes breakfast in the room rate) is 
sumptuous. Hotel Excelsior Ernst really stands out for its incredibly 
friendly and helpful staff (the hotel has one of the highest staff-to-guest 
ratios of any hotel in Germany). They make you feel most welcome, with-
out a hint of snobbery. See the “Cologne” map on p. 369 for the hotel’s 
location.

Grand Hyatt Berlin
The Grand Hyatt Berlin, Marlene-Dietrich-Platz 2, 10785 Berlin. ($$$$; 
% 030/2553-1234; www.berlin.grand.hyatt.com), eschews tradi-
tional design and offers instead a hotel that is excitingly modern and 
wonderfully comfortable. Located smack-dab in the center of all the 
action in the new Potsdamer Platz area, it’s close to everything in 
western and eastern Berlin — you can walk to the Philharmonie and 
Kulturforum museums or be on Unter den Linden in minutes. This big 
hotel, built in 1998 with 342 rooms, is sleek and glamorous throughout, 
with a feng shui sensibility and a refreshing lack of froufrou. The large 
rooms have beautiful wood finishes and marble-clad bathrooms 
designed to be a spa-like part of your room, with soaker tubs and sepa-
rate shower areas. The rooftop pool and spa area is one of the finest in 
Berlin, offering great views and exceptional facilities (including an ice-
cold plunge pool that looks like a giant stainless-steel wine cooler). 
Restaurants include the outstanding Vox, for European cuisine and 
sushi (described in Chapter 11); Tizian, for international classics; and 
Mesa, for casual tapas. See the “Western Berlin Accommodations and 
Dining” map on p. 118 for the hotel’s location.
Hotel Adlon Kempinski, Berlin
The old Adlon, across from the Brandenburg Gate, was the most famous 
and glamorous hotel in prewar Berlin. The new Hotel Adlon Kempinski, 
Unter den Linden 77, 10117 Berlin ($$$$; % 800-426-3135 in the U.S. or 
030/22610; www.hotel-adlon.de), built on part of the original site and 
completed in 1997, recaptures the glory of its legendary predecessor 
and serves as a flash point for the new Berlin. In terms of service, com-
fort, elegance, and location, the Adlon has no peers in Berlin. Everything 
about this property is 5-star deluxe, and staying here truly is an experi-
ence. I love the hustle-and-bustle of the lobby area and the enthusiastic 
commitment to service that you find in everyone from the bellhops to 
the knowledgeable concierges. The Adlon’s 337 rooms are sumptuously 
decorated and impeccably maintained. Large, marble-clad bathrooms 
feature double sinks, soaker tubs, and separate showers. The spa area, 
with a large pool, saunas, and steam rooms, is wonderfully elegant. A 
new day spa, the best in any Berlin hotel, offers massage and all manner 
of esthetic treatments. This is a pampering hotel where every detail 
relating to the guest’s comfort is taken care of. In addition, the hotel’s 
three restaurants — the classic French Lorenz Adlon, the Chinese-
influenced MA Tim Raue, and the Italian Restaurant Gabriele — all 
earned Michelin stars (and toques from Gault Millau) in 2008, an honor 
that is unprecedented among European hotels. See the “Berlin-Mitte 
Accommodations and Dining” map on p. 121 for the hotel’s location.

Hotel am Josephsplatz, Nuremberg
Small, reasonably priced, and ever so charming, the Hotel am Josephs-
platz, Josephsplatz 30–32, 90403 Nürnberg ($–$$$; % 0911/214-470; 
www.hotel-am-josephsplatz.de), is tucked away on a quiet street 
not far from the train station and close to all the sights in Nuremberg’s 
Altstadt. This little gem is sophisticated and up-to-date with all its ame-
nities (you can check your e-mail for free) yet old-fashioned and tradi-
tional in its décor and friendly, personalized service. The 36 individually 
furnished rooms are large and comfy with good-size bathrooms. The 
flower-filled roof terrace is a lovely surprise, and so is the sauna. The 
breakfast buffet is a great way to start your day. See the “Nuremberg” 
map on p. 357 for the hotel’s location.
Hotel Eisenhut, Rothenburg
For sheer historical panache, no other city along the Romantic Road can 
match Rothenburg. Hotel Eisenhut, Herrngasse 3–7, 91541 Rothenburg 
($$–$$$$; % 09861/7050; www.eisenhut.com), is Rothenburg’s only 
luxury-oriented hotel. It has a charming, old-fashioned ambience, the 
largest bedrooms and bathrooms in town, a fine-dining restaurant, and a 
central location right across the street from bustling Marktplatz. The 
hotel is comprised of three interconnected medieval houses with a 
fourth house, the most atmospheric of them all, across the street. All 78 
rooms differ in size and layout, and they’re all decorated differently, in a 
wide range of styles. If you want a historic, service-minded hotel in 
Rothenburg, this is it. Note: The hotel is closed in January and February. 
See the “Rothenburg ob der Tauber” map on p. 293 for the hotel’s 
location.
Kempinski Hotel Atlantic Hamburg
Movie stars, politicians, and royalty stay at Kempinski Hotel Atlantic 
Hamburg, An der Alster 72–79, 20099 Hamburg ($$$$; % 800-426-3135 
or 040/28880; www.kempinski.atlantic.de), with good reason: The 
hotel is the finest in northern Germany. Situated across from Alster 
Lake, this hotel was one of the few buildings to escape wartime destruc-
tion. Age is a real asset for this grande dame because hotels nowadays 
simply don’t have rooms (or hallways) as generously proportioned as 
the ones here, with high ceilings and spacious bathrooms. Everything is 
posh but comfortable. Amenities include an on-site pool and sauna and 
beautiful public spaces. You can even make a grand entrance down the 
staircase into the lobby. See the “Hamburg” map on p. 174 for the hotel’s 
location.

Mandarin Oriental, Munich
Personal service is what the sophisticated, super-classy Mandarin 
Oriental, Neuturmstrasse 1, 80331 München (% 089/290-980; www.
mandarinoriental.com), is all about. Located in the historic heart of 
Munich, the Mandarin Oriental occupies an ornate 19th-century building 
that was turned into a 73-room boutique hotel in 1990 and refurbished in 
2007. Early 19th-century Biedermeier-style furnishings, with fine prints 
and engravings, give the generous-size rooms a traditional elegance 
enhanced by the latest technology (such as Bang & Olufson TVs and 
sound systems). Big marble-tiled bathrooms have separate tub and 
shower areas. Some of the rooms and suites provide lovely views of the 
city, and in the summer the hotel opens its rooftop swimming pool and 
lounge area — from which you can see the entire city with the Alps in 
the distance. The Michelin-starred Restaurant Mark’s offers an innova-
tive approach to classic French-Mediterranean cuisine. Everything here 
is stylish and comforting, and what fun to step outside and be in the 
very heart of Munich. See the “Central Munich Accommodations and 
Dining” map on p. 254 for the hotel’s location.
Steigenberger Hotel De Saxe, Dresden
Opened in 2006, Dresden’s Steigenberger Hotel de Saxe, Neumarkt 9, 
01067 Dresden ($$$$; % 800-223-5652 in the U.S. or 0351/43860; www.
desaxe-dresden.steigenberger.de), enjoys a prestigious location 
right across from the newly restored Frauenkirche and a short stroll 
away from all of Dresden’s major attractions. The hotel is beautifully 
designed and beautifully appointed in a classic, modern style that man-
ages to be both serene and luxurious at the same time. The rooms, some 
with a memorable view across Neumarkt to the Frauenkirche, are large 
and lovely, with superb beds and sleek marble bathrooms. There’s an 
on-site restaurant (where the sumptuous breakfast buffet is served); in 
the summer, tables are set up on the terrace in front for informal dining. 
See the “Dresden” map on p. 209 for the hotel’s location.

Chapter 23
Ten (Or So) Things to Know 
About German Wine
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering German wines
▶ Finding out about table wines and special vintages
W
ine has been part of German life and culture ever since the 
Romans began tending vineyards some 2,000 years ago. The most 
famous vineyards are found in the western and southwestern parts of 
the country, in the Rhine Valley and along the Mosel River (Chapter 19). 
The German practice of harvesting grapes at various stages of ripeness 
(known as selective harvest) determines the official quality category that 
is indicated on the label. Under the German wine law, there are two cate-
gories of quality — Tafelwein and Qualitätswein.
Tafelwein
Tafelwein (taf-fel vine; table wine) is made from normally ripe grapes. 
If you want a simple, inexpensive German table wine, you have two 
choices: Deutscher Tafelwein and Deutscher Landwein.
Deutscher Tafelwein
Deutscher Tafelwein (doy-tcher-toff-el-vine; German table wine) is a 
simple table wine made from normally ripe grapes. It’s meant for every-
day enjoyment and primarily consumed where it’s grown in Germany. 
Deutscher Tafelwein comes from one of five broad Tafelwein regions.
Deutscher Landwein
Deutscher Landwein (doy-tcher-lahnd-vine; special German table wine) is 
a hearty, fresh, regional wine with more body and character than 

Part V: The Part of Tens 
420
Tafelwein because the grapes must be riper at harvest. Dry or semidry, 
Landwein comes from and is named after one of 19 Landwein regions.
 
 If the word Deutsch is missing on the label of a bottle of Tafelwein or 
Landwein, then it is not made solely of German grapes. Instead, it’s a 
foreign wine that may or may not have been blended with German wine. 
It is likely to have been bottled, but not grown, in Germany.
Qualitätswein
Made from ripe, very ripe, or overripe grapes, Qualitätswein (qwal-ee-
tates-vine; quality wine) is divided into two types: Qualitätswein mit 
Prädikat (see the next section) and Qualitätswein bestimmter 
Anbaugebiete (QbA). If you see QbA on the label, it means the wine 
comes from one of the 13 specified winegrowing regions and is made 
from approved grape varieties that have ripened sufficiently to assure 
that the wine will have the style and traditional taste of its region. Light, 
refreshing, and fruity, these wines are meant to be consumed while 
young, for everyday enjoyment or with meals.
Prädikatswein
Qualitätswein mit Prädikat (QmP) includes all the finest wines of 
Germany. Referred to as Prädikatswein (pray-dee-cots-vine), each of 
these wines carries one of six special Prädikat (attributes) on its label. 
Those six attributes are Kabinett, Spätlese, Auslese, Beerenauslese, 
Eiswein, and Trockenbeerenauslese. Each type is explained in the sec-
tions that follow in ascending order of ripeness. The degree of ripeness 
represents the natural sugar content of the grape juice at harvest.
Kabinett
Kabinett (cob-ee-net) wines are fine, usually naturally light, and made of 
fully ripened grapes. The lightest of the Prädikat wines, Kabinett wines 
generally have the lowest alcoholic strength.
Spätlese
Spätlese (spate-lay-zuh) literally means “late harvest.” These superior-
quality wines are made from grapes harvested after the normal harvest. 
Spätlese wines are more intense in flavor and concentration, but not nec-
essarily sweet. They go well with richer, more flavorful foods, or can be 
drunk by themselves.

 Chapter 23: Ten (Or So) Things to Know About German Wine 421
Auslese
Auslese (aus-lay-zuh) is the harvest of select, very ripe bunches. These 
wines are noble, intense in bouquet and taste, and usually (but not 
always) sweet.
Beerenauslese
Beerenauslese (beer-en-aus-lay-zuh) is the harvest of individually 
selected, overripe berries (Beeren) with a high sugar content. These 
are rich, sweet dessert wines.
Eiswein
Eiswein (ice-vine), or “ice wine,” is made from grapes harvested and 
pressed while frozen to concentrate sugar and acidity. Of Beerenauslese 
intensity, Eiswein is truly unique, with a remarkable concentration of 
fruity acidity and sweetness.
Trockenbeerenauslese
Trockenbeerenauslese (trock-en-beer-en-aus-lay-zuh) is made from indi-
vidually selected, overripe berries, dried up almost to raisins. Such 
wines are rich, sweet, and honeylike.

Fast Facts
ATMs
In German cities, you can easily find 
24-hour ATMs in airports, train stations, 
and outside banks. You can get cash 24 
hours a day using your bank card or an 
international credit card. Cirrus (% 800-
424-7787; www.mastercard.com) and 
Plus (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com/
atms) are the most popular networks; 
check the back of your ATM card to see 
which network your bank belongs to. The 
networks’ toll-free numbers and Web sites 
give you locations of ATMs where you can 
withdraw money in Germany.
Business Hours
Most banks are open Monday through 
Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2:30 to 
4 p.m. (to 5:30 p.m. Thurs). Money 
exchanges at airports and train stations are 
generally open daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
Most businesses are open Monday through 
Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on Saturday 
from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Store hours vary from 
town to town, but shops generally are open 
Monday through Friday from 9 or 10 a.m. to 
6 or 6:30 p.m. (to 8:30 p.m. Thurs); however, 
along the main shopping streets in many 
larger cities, stores now stay open until 
8 p.m. Saturday hours generally are from 
9 a.m. to 1 or 2 p.m., except on the first 
Saturday of the month, when stores may 
remain open until 4 p.m. Bakeries, news 
vendors, and florist shops sometimes are 
open on Sunday, as are a few retail outlets 
in major train stations. On the four 
Saturdays prior to Christmas, shops 
throughout Germany are open until 6 p.m., 
sometimes later.
Credit Cards
American Express, Diners Club, 
MasterCard, and Visa are accepted at 
many places throughout Germany, but not 
universally (and with the credit turmoil in 
the U.S., some establishments are only 
accepting European cards or those issued 
by German banks). Smaller pensions 
(B&Bs) and restaurants may not accept 
credit cards. If your credit card is lost or 
stolen, you can call the following numbers 
in Germany: American Express % 954-
503-8850 (collect); Diners Club % 702-797-
5532 (collect); MasterCard % 0800/819-
1040 (toll-free); Visa % 0800/811-8440 
(toll-free) or 417-581-9994 (collect).
Currency Exchange
You find currency exchanges, called 
bureaux de change or Geldwechsel, in air-
ports, railway stations, post offices, and 
many banks. Currency exchange is dis-
cussed in Chapter 5.
Customs
You can bring gifts into Germany duty-free 
up to a total value of 175€ ($236). The fol-
lowing items are permitted into Germany 
duty-free from non–European Union (EU) 
countries: 200 cigarettes; 1 liter of liquor 
above 44 proof, or 2 liters of liquor less 
than 44 proof, or 2 liters of wine; 50 grams 
of perfume and 0.25 liter of eau de 

423
Cologne; 500 grams of coffee; and 100 
grams of tea. Be aware that current secu-
rity restrictions do not permit carrying 
onboard any containers with more than 3 
oz. of liquid.
If you’re traveling from Germany to Australia, 
keep in mind that the duty-free allowance in 
Australia is A$400 or, for those 17 and under, 
A$200. Adult Australian citizens can bring in 
250 cigarettes or 250 grams of loose tobacco, 
and 1.125 liters of alcohol. For more informa-
tion, contact Australian Customs Services, 
GPO Box 8, Sydney NSW 2001 (% 02/6275-
6666 in Australia), or go to www.customs.
gov.au.
If you’re traveling from Germany to 
Canada, you can get a clear summary of 
Canadian rules by requesting the booklet 
“I Declare,” issued by the Canada Customs 
and Revenue Agency (% 800-461-9999 in 
Canada; www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca). 
Canada allows its citizens a C$750 duty-
free exemption, which, for adults, includes 
200 cigarettes, 2.2 pounds of tobacco, 1.5 
liters of liquor, and 50 cigars. In addition, 
you can mail gifts to Canada from abroad 
at the rate of C$60 a day, provided that 
gifts are unsolicited and don’t contain 
alcohol or tobacco. (Write on the package 
“Unsolicited gift, less than $60 value”). 
Note: The C$750 exemption can be used 
only once a year and only after an absence 
of seven days.
If you’re traveling from Germany to New 
Zealand, keep in mind that the duty-free 
allowance for New Zealand is NZ$700. 
Citizens 18 and older can bring in 200 ciga-
rettes, or 50 cigars, or 250 grams of 
tobacco (or a mixture of all three if their 
combined weight doesn’t exceed 250 
grams), plus 4.5 liters of wine and beer, or 
1.125 liters of liquor. Most questions are 
answered in a free pamphlet, available at 
New Zealand consulates and Customs 
offices, called “New Zealand Customs 
Guide for Travellers, Notice No. 4.” For 
more information, contact New Zealand 
Customs, 50 Anzac Ave., P.O. Box 29, 
Auckland (% 09/359-6655; www.
customs.govt.nz).
Citizens of the United Kingdom and Ireland 
who are returning from a European Union 
(EU) country (of which Germany is one) go 
through a separate Customs exit (called 
the “Blue Exit”) especially for EU travelers. 
In essence, there is no limit on what you 
can bring back from an EU country, as long 
as the items are for personal use (this 
includes gifts) and you’ve already paid the 
necessary duty and tax. However, Customs 
law sets out guidance levels of 3,200 ciga-
rettes, 200 cigars, 3 kilograms of smoking 
tobacco, 10 liters of spirits, 90 liters of wine 
(of this not more than 60 liters can be spar-
kling wine), and 110 liters of beer. If you 
bring in more than these levels, you may 
be asked to prove that the goods are for 
your own use. For more information, con-
tact HM Customs & Excise, Passenger 
Enquiry Point, 2nd Floor Wayfarer House, 
Great South West Road, Feltham, Middle-
sex, TW14 8NP (% 0181/910-3744; www.
open.gov.uk).
U.S. citizens returning home from Germany 
can bring back $800 worth of merchandise 
duty-free. A flat rate of 10 percent duty is 
levied on the next $1,000 worth of pur-
chases. You can’t bring fresh foodstuffs 
into the United States — only tinned foods 
and packaged foods. You can mail gifts 
back to people in the United States duty-
free if the value of the entire gift package 
does not exceed $200. For more informa-
tion, contact the U.S. Customs Service, 
1300 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, 
DC 20229 (% 877-287-8867), and request 
the free pamphlet “Know Before You Go,” 
also available on the Web at www.cbp.
gov/travel.

Drugstores
Pharmaceuticals are sold at a pharmacy, 
called an Apotheke (ah-po-tay-kuh); the 
trained staff can recommend over-the-
counter medications for many common ail-
ments. For cosmetics, go to a Drogerie. 
German pharmacies are open regular busi-
ness hours. They take turns staying open 
nights, on Sunday, and on holidays, and 
each Apotheke posts a list of those that 
are open off-hours.
Electricity
The electricity is 220 volts (50 Hz). For any 
U.S. appliances, you need a transformer 
and a converter plug with two round 
prongs for German sockets.
Embassies
All embassies and consulates are located 
in Berlin, Germany’s capital.
The Australian embassy is at Wallstrasse 
76–79 (% 030/880-0880; www.germany.
embassy.gov.au; U-Bahn: Märkisches 
Museum). It’s open Monday, Wednesday, 
and Friday from 9 to 11 a.m.
The Canadian embassy is at Leipziger 
Platz 17 (% 030/203-120; www.berlin.
gc.ca; U-/S-Bahn: Potsdamer Platz). It’s 
open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. 
to 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 to 5 p.m.
The Irish embassy is at Friedrichstrasse 
200 (% 030/220-720; www.embassy
ofireland.de; S-Bahn: Friedrich-
strasse). It’s open Monday through Friday 
from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2:30 to 
4:45 p.m.
The New Zealand embassy is at 
Friedrichstrasse 60 (% 030/206-210; www.
nzembassy.com/germany; U-Bahn:

through Friday from 8 a.m. to noon and 
1 to 4:30 p.m.
The U.S. embassy is at Pariser Platz 2 
(% 030/2385-174; http://berlin.
usembassy.gov/germany; 
S-Bahn: Under den Linden). 
Note: For help with visas and passports, go 
to Clayallee 170 (% 030/832-9223; U-Bahn: 
Oskar-Helene-Heim). It’s open Monday 
through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to noon.
Emergencies
Throughout Germany, the emergency 
number for police is % 110; for fire or to 
call an ambulance, dial % 112.
Holidays
See Chapter 3 for a list of public holidays in 
Germany.
Information
See “Where to Get More Information,” 
later in this Quick Concierge, to find out 
where to get visitor information before you 
leave home. Tourist information offices are 
listed under “Finding Information” in every 
city chapter or section.
Internet Access and Cybercafes
Cybercafes are in all the larger cities in 
Germany. For locations, ask at the local 
tourist office or your hotel.
Liquor Laws
Officially, you must be 18 to consume any 
kind of alcoholic beverage in Germany. 
Bars and cafes may request proof of age. 
Local authorities treat drinking while driv-
ing as a very serious offense.
Germany For Dummies, 4th Edition 

425
Medical Assistance
Most major hotels have a physician on 
staff or on call. If you can’t get hold of a 
doctor and the situation is life-threatening, 
dial the emergency service, % 112, which 
is open day and night. Medical and hospi-
tal services aren’t free, so be sure that you 
have appropriate insurance coverage 
before you travel. See Chapter 10 for more 
information on general medical matters in 
Germany.
Newspapers and Magazines
In Germany, you find daily editions of the 
International Herald Tribune and an inter-
national edition of USA Today. Many new-
stands carry Time magazine as well.
Police
The German word for police is Polizei 
(po-lit-sigh). Throughout the country, dial 
% 110 for emergencies.
Post Offices
The words Deutsche Post identify a post 
office. Post offices are open Monday 
through Friday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., 
Saturday from 8 a.m. to noon. In larger 
cities, the post office in the main train sta-
tion may be open longer hours. Street mail-
boxes are yellow. To find international 
rates and services from Germany, check 
out the Web site for Deutsche Post (www.
deutschepost.de).
Restrooms
Use the word Toilette (twah-leh-teh). A 
women’s Toilette is usually marked with an 
F for Frauen, and a men’s Toilette with an 
H for Herren. Restrooms in train stations 
sometimes require a 0.50€ or 1€ coin to 
enter. Many restrooms have an attendant 
who expects a small tip (never more than 
0.20€); the attendant in a men’s Toilette 
may be female.
Safety
Germany is generally a safe country in 
which to travel, with the usual caveats to 
use common sense and be aware of your 
surroundings. At night, avoid areas around 
the large railway stations in Frankfurt, 
Munich, Berlin, and Hamburg.
Taxes
Germany imposes a Mehrwertsteuer 
(MWST), or value-added tax (VAT), of 16 
percent on most goods and services. The 
prices of restaurants and hotels include 
VAT. Stores that display a tax-free shop-
ping sign can issue you a Global Refund 
Cheque at the time of purchase. See 
Chapter 5 for details on how to obtain your 
refund.
Telephone
The country code for Germany is 49. To 
call Germany from the U.S., dial the inter-
national access code 011, then 49, then the 
city code, then the regular phone number, 
which may have from four to nine digits. 
The phone numbers listed in this book are 
to be used within Germany; when calling 
from abroad, omit the initial 0 in the city 
code.
Local and long-distance calls may be 
placed from post offices and coin-operated 
public telephone booths, though coin-
operated devices are increasingly rare. 
The unit charge is 0.20€. Most phones in 
Germany now require a Telefonkarte (tele-
phone card), available at post offices and 
newsstands in increments of 5€ ($6.75), 10€ 
($14), and 20€ ($26). Telephone calls made 
through hotel switchboards cost signifi-
cantly more than the regular charge at a 
pay phone or post office. To make an inter-
national call from a public phone, look for a 
phone marked inlands und auslandsge-
spräche; most have instructions in English.
 Appendix: Quick Concierge

426
To call the United States or Canada from 
Germany, dial 01, followed by the country 
code (1), then the area code, and then the 
number. Alternatively, you can dial the var-
ious telecommunication companies in the 
States for cheaper rates. From Germany, 
the access numbers are % 0800/225-5288 
for AT&T and % 0800/888-8000 for MCI.
Time Zone
Germany operates on central European 
time (CET), which means that the country 
is six hours ahead of eastern time in the 
United States and one hour ahead of 
Greenwich mean time (GMT). Summer 
daylight saving time begins in April and 
ends in October — there’s a slight differ-
ence in the dates from year to year — so 
there may be a period in early spring and 
in the fall when there’s a seven-hour dif-
ference between eastern time and CET. 
Always check if you’re traveling during 
these periods, especially if you need to 
catch a plane.
Tipping
If a restaurant bill says Bedienung, it 
means a service charge has already been 
added, so just round yours up to the 
nearest euro. If not, add 5 percent to 10 
percent, depending on your satisfaction. 
Round up to the nearest euro for taxis. 
Bellhops get 1€ ($1.35) per bag, as does the 
doorman at a hotel, restaurant, or night-
club. The room-cleaning staff gets a small 
tip in Germany, as do concierges who per-
form special favors such as obtaining the-
ater or opera tickets. Tip hairdressers or 
barbers 5 percent to 10 percent.
Water
Tap water is safe to drink in all German 
towns and cities, but bottled drinking 
water is a way of life. Restaurants do not 
freely offer water with your meal. You 
order Sprudelwasser (shprew-dil-vos-er; 
water with gas) or Still (shtill; noncarbon-
ated water).
Weights and Measures
Germany uses the metric system. Heights 
are given in centimeters (cm) and meters 
(m), distances in kilometers (km), and 
weights in grams (g) or kilograms (kg). 
Temperature is measured in degrees 
Celsius (0°C = 32°F). To translate Celsius 
into Fahrenheit, multiply the number by 1.8 
and add 32.
